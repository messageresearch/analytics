TRANSCRIPT
========================================

still pray for the sick now I remember that that's goes right on with it oh if we can get the the church we're positionally set and and getting order so we can go to work got to get organized get everything together something else just struck my heart a few moments ago that's when a little old veteran man one of his arms almost shot off leg almost shot off he's not around here listen at me just now but a real Prince of a by the name of Roy Roberson Roy Robertson one of our trustees here at the church and one fine Christian gentleman he stepped just and said brother don't forget the president said it made me feel so sorry when he Ste saw on a television him stepping off of the plane the tears coming down his cheeks and his mouth twisting sideways you know he was right over there with battle matter if you're different with me in politics we still our president to me I'm neither Democrat nor republ I'm a chistian I I tell you I've certainly had a great admiration for president Dwight ishow Dwight Asing how sure been one great man in my way of thinking he running again I was Voting I'd vote for him again that's right I don't care if he was he 100 years old I'd still be voting for him because I like him let's remember him in our prayers tonight JT I certainly appreciate that nice meeting you all you and brother Willard had this week if I walked in from the outside

anchored now I just love to see him do that there's brother R up there on the road up to have meeting for him few days have a Revival brother R is and I remember I used to push that little fell around everywhere trying to make him get out in the harness and preach he was so backward he say I just can't talk you already hear him you don't know what you can do till you let the Holy Spirit get a hold of you right brother gming in brother Juni Jun we we consider all them our little sister churches right with us we're all together we don't disagree on our doctrines our our hopes or aims our doctrines are one We Stand Together just everything together we're just one church and we' sure like to have scattered throughout we got some in Africa some in India all around over the country that's where we want them scatter the news I see these young fellas coming on like brother uh JT porell here and brother Willard and when they're coming on young fellas when I'm getting older if there is a tomorrow there'll be that man of tomorrow I don't want this message to never die it just can't it must live on I don't believe we got too much longer to bring it the little baby that they said was going to die see you've had it in church all day today sister that's very fine and we thank the Lord for that the Lord is gracious full of Mercy just keep believing what was told you right here it'll be all right now are you enjoying teaching you like teaching I really think it does US good it gives us a little rest from praying for the sick visions and Divine Healing of course now tonight we at the service we're pray for the sick again tonight we always want to do that baptize anybody at any time how many remembers when I used to walk the power lines well I walked right through the power lines many times had walked 30 miles a day through the wilderness I had 280 mil line to walk I go down through there shirt my hands and all so tired walking through them jungles and green BRS cutting older sat down on the tree and talk to him about being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you say well I've always want to be baptized it ain't very far theck I right down there in the name of Jesus l many time in my work one come right down off of a pole stand up there working across the PO L working across the pole with the man talking to me about say well Billy one of these days I'm coming up to your church and be baptized I said why you want to wait till the for we're right by the river there's plenty of water right there catch him right now that's the time Philip said the UN said to Philip here's one what does us nothing if you're ready that's the time don't let the devil get a chance to Wed something in there amen don't put off for tomorrow the things that you could do today tomorrow might not come for you amen I remember one time I did that learn taught me a lesson I put all something that I should have done one day and the next day was too late now truly I don't want to keep you all this time but I just get so so wound up and I don't know feeling so good I just get beside myself almost I just feel so good let us bow our heads just a moment before we approach the word our heavenly father thou the Living God ever alive the Sun that just went down that same Sun Daniel looked at it when it set Jeremiah looked at it setting Adam looked at it setting Jesus looked at it setting and it's the same world that they lived in and walked in and you still remain the same God tonight there's many requests a man with tumor on the brain a sister fears the same thing you're the only hope Lord there is for that that tumor has become malignant there's nothing can be stopped it's way out of the reach of the hands of the doctor but tonight we go with our little sling shot after that lamb to bring it back to father in the name of the Lord Jesus we direct our prayer to slay the line the tumor the malignancy safely to bring them to the f God do remember tonight our lovely president brother our Dwight Eisenhower know he has gued the land lord he's tried to keep us out of War he promised the Korean War would end if he had any way he could he promise those mothers he'd bring those boys back but he said for me to do it I can't do it I can put my efforts but God Alone will have to do it you with him Lord and now it's all settled up why couldn't they SE that in the first place God I pray that you help him bless that Gallant soul lord and we pray that you'll choose for us the leader that is to be next your predestinated will be done Lord but the one that we are so interested in tonight besides our national Affairs is that great and glorious one that's coming to set up a kingdom that will have no end the lord Jesus thy son then they'll stack arms the Taps will sound there be no more war they'll plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they'll build houses and have them there never be no more trouble than then bless us now as we approach the word father thou knowest the reason that I'm approaching the word from this very scripture here it's because that I feel that you want me to do it this way that it's your Divine will it's in your order it's in the it's the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place be ready for the hour of battle our brother said in his prayer to you not long ago oh you have trained us so long Lord father give us our ranks put us out there to what we're supposed to do so we can be about the father's bus for we ask it in Jesus name thy son amen amen rather a wonderful afternoon this afternoon talking to a famous doctor Lille his nurse must heard about glorious things of the Lord her father as a doctor she came over and sat in my room most the afternoon just come in dropped in wonderful person brother a little hard you know kind of a staunch real Presbyterian to start with but left with tears running down her cheeks God everywhere offices and nurses I don't believe there's a nurse in n's Infirmary Hospital that I didn't testify to about having the Holy Ghost and ask a doctor I come in contact with anywhere tell them about it a got much time brother no matter how hard seems here just wait till you cross that last breath Y and see and you wish you had done it yes sir don't wait till that time let's do it right now this is the hour all they might disagree and F and fuss a little about it but they don't mean it they really don't mean it they're all and they go to fussing at you just just remember they they don't really mean it they don't mean it they just maybe been taught something they just hang to that so you you can see their idea don't fuss with them don't fuss with no one but just love them right into it for well I think we got down to the ninth verse I'm not sure that's a long way from the third chapter isn't it Honey in the Rock to me we were speaking now remember so we can get a little backgr again brother nille you you pull me a little bit now I failed to see the time getting away so I can have prayer for the sick we want to get every little spe that we [Music] can tonight I want an alar call ending up on this which I'll may be able just to read the rest of it but the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into or something that might have you merited somewhere but it's what God did for you himself that you were so good that you went to a church one night that some poor brother LED you up to the altar it wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life when you get there that day no wonder the 4y 24 Elders laid off their crowns everybody laid down their Crown everyone fell on their faces they didn't have one thing that could say no preacher no Elder no nothing all praise to the lamb amen God will gather in him all things at that day or if we' ever know and recognize who that was who they crucify now only we start at the eth ver to get a little background wherein he has abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known to us the mystery of his will the mysteries of his will remember how we hung on that how many was here this morning let's see how we stuck on that the mystery of his will now it is not just a little thing then it's a mystery God's will is a mystery my and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or herself God's my how do we find out was known to him he said he didn't confer with any man no Flesh and Blood he went to no school no Seminary had nothing to do with it but he it was revealed to him by Jesus Christ who met him on the road to Damascus in a a light like a pillar of fire and it called him and he went to Arabia and there dwelt three years oh don't you imagine that brother years down there in Arabia red in a little building somewhere walking up and down the all the old Scrolls they didn't have the new ones PA wrote right these old Scrolls how that God at the beginning predestinated us unto he would Jesus that through this sacrifice we' all have a right to the Tree of Life those called Already Justified those who Justified he already gled God since the beginning of the world predestinated us to the adoption of son now the whole creation gring waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God oh I imagine Paul had a wonderful time I like to been there with him wouldn't you now he said he made to us the myy get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes this afternoon I had all about 30 minutes to study just to look the lesson over maybe not I I'll say half of that 15 minutes between the time and I got run and I thought theery how mysterious and the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament then back over into the new test something together see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of the setting together remember it cannot be taught in any Seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by [Music] theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God [Music] oh

the time we are living in thank you because you are good to us I place myself in your hands I place my interpreter in your hands as so that you may be with us the advice we need this morning it's all in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ am amen and amen before anything else let it go to the word of God Genesis 1is Genesis 1 verse 1 it reads the following way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first [Music] day may God add the blessing to the reading of his word be so kind and please take your seat you all welcome to the house of say God bless you bless them bless your neighbor with a smile brother while I'm still half asleep doesn't matter just smile so you can fully wake up we give thanks to God for this day we give thanks to God because he allows us to be [Music] here according to what our brother Antonio told us is being alive is worth more than $10,000 so then we are millionaires where is it brother well then we got a balance there has to be a balance to learn to Value what we have our pastor finds himself outside of the country he finds himself in Vietnam fighting the good fight tending to the call the call God has placed in his life and we're going to be praying for him I believe they have a 14 hour difference from us so just with that alone is enough to have your thoughts going wild in order to get acquainted kind of difficult when the time is so different than that which we're used to here it's day over there it's night you're over there awake and you're sleeping because over here it's night it's already time to go to sleep over there and you're wi awake because you can't go to sleep because over here and when you're barely getting used to it it's time to go back and you have to get used to once again to where you can say nor so let us continue praying for our pastor is with him we also Place him in our prayers as well may God be with our pastor and strengthen him may he fulfill the purpose for which he made this trip for for what God called him for this trip May the sick be healed and people be delivered people receive the Holy Spirit can they be able to receive what they need God needs a vessel he needs a vessel in order to work if we could make it in a simpler way we put it in the such manner imagine you order pizza you're hungry how many here like pizza however you like I don't like pepperoni to have jalapenos or chili or something like that however you like it now there's even p uh now there's pizzas that aren't flower based they cauliflower so now imagine you order pizza and you're very hungry and where you ordered from he comes and knocks on your door you see that he has the pizza on his he has the pure Pizza on his hand he's burning his hand he's saying hurry up I'm burning I've come to bring you your pizza what is it that you're going to think you would think well first of all did he clean his hands would you eat someone brought the pizza itself on their bare hands and they're giving to you like that I wouldn't eat it brother unless I'm out in the desert but nor the first thing I would think is where is the box where is the pizza box because the Box protects the product so when they bring me the pizza in a pizza box all my heart I accept it and I open the box and I begin to satisfy my need that's in the natural spiritual can't send you the substance unless it comes in flesh the product has to be covered in FL that can satisfy your need because God's Gift has to be in flesh because that is God's plan for the time we are living in how we give thanks and that's the way the best way I can explain what our pastor means to us it is God dressed Ines once again satisfying our needs amen amen so when you think on remember about the pizza without a box it can't be so it has to have a box God has to have a vessel to express his love towards us that's why we will always up our p and also pray for Sita and his family you always have to be strong to stay behind and be supporting as well it's a teamwork let's continue with the topic which corresponds to us the spoken word is the Original Seed we have been listening in a great amount we' have seen the way each one of our brothers have expressed this topic and we're grateful for what they've spoken to [Music] us for which they have expressed what's in their heart and I believe that God has fed us he's been feeding us the important part is that when we come we come with expectations because if we don't come expecting anything then we will leave with exactly that because we expect nothing we will leave with nothing so we go to past Sunday well how many take notes don't raise your hand if you take notes what do you do with your notes is the question don't answer but many times we take notes we say well that what the brother said was tremendous what our brothers expressed last Sunday our brother Anton and our brother of the value of the seed our life is worth more than [Music] money but in order for you to fully enjoy or understand the meaning of song you have to have an experience that you went through the seed went through an experience the Lily was trying to escape for that Merry clay or that swamp to make that effort and search out that light of the Sun that sunlight that's why when we come and we listen to the praise and the songs it's an experience that's why we can worship God in the bad times amen amen in brief that is what was spoken to us last Sunday so then I think that if we don't meditate we don't go back once again to what's been spoken to us so then the essence of the word it doesn't make an impact on our lives because Revelation comes through repetition so God puts us puts everything with so if we didn't take notes and we can always go back watch online and remember what God has for us something something I liked I don't know what it was but I I know I liked it but I don't know what it was God has so much Mercy on us you can go back and watch and listen to exactly what the brother said once again so then we have to take advant Vantage of what we have because in the beginning when God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and void God began to make manifest his thoughts the other scripture we've been reading is Isaiah 5 558 where it says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord verse 10 for as the rain cometh down in the snow from heaven and runneth not thither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall be my word that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it God is manifesting once again what's the process for which you have to go through that the power of the spoken can have effect effect in our lives in what that we can place action what we have been taught brother brandham says God is unchangeable as much as in essence and as infinite in his abilities he knows the beginning and the end he is God therefore the thoughts of God are Eternal they are Eternal thought God tries to reveal them to each one of us he can't do it in the way that we think has to do it the way which he established in his plan that even though our life may be without form or void God has a process he has sh us which he desires to show his thoughts in our lives in that way the prophet says us being Eternal in his thoughts in our due time we become the many members of the seed of the spoken word manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts are now manifest in flesh are the sons of God just as we are called we don't become seed through the new birth we were seed and that's why we were born again because only the chosen can be born again because we were seed for that reason we could be quickened for that reason we could be quickened was in our hearts because there was the etal he deposited with a plan to go into action at a Due Time Each time he had a plan to manifest his that person could not live higher than their very own the revelation of the it was to be not to live higher could speak higher than your thoughts therefore you couldn't leave higher but the time we live God came once again in human flesh in the time we are living in in the age of Revelations behold I am at the door the only age in which Lord Jesus Christ is outside he's knocking to come inside so God is analyzing the situation which laa find itself in is the darkest age of all everyone is claiming their rights where they neither cold nor hot where there is no real commitment with God people are miserable and poor blind naked and they know it not God is trying to come in to the heart of the human being he is knocking but in this age in this door that he is knocking on there's no way to open it from the outside it has to be opened from the inside your heart you have to open it yourself you have to open that door the door that the Lord Jesus Christ may come for what reason to be able to reveal to you what it is that you mean to him he will take you throughout the scriptures he will take you to understand who you are Romans 9:23 says glor and he said and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a prepared unto Glory even us whom he called not the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he said also in ozi I will call them my people which are not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and he shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God in Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and for Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory Ephesians 36 says that the Gentiles should be fellow Heirs of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ by the gospel that us which were not a people which were not Beloved the Lord Jesus Christ came manifest the thoughts God di the cross at Calvary for the pardon of our sins he came to preach he came to express to express God's thoughts but he died and as he died the word had to be ful he resurrected God's thoughts Express at each moment God's plan had to continue Paul comes and says now I have a mystery God has deposited this mystery within I surrendered my life I made myself a prisoner of Christ because I am a prisoner God has given me a vis and with a vision comes Revelation the revelation of he says now the Gentiles are coair the Gentiles are partakers of the same promise not only is it Abraham seed in the natural now it's Abraham's Royal seed in the spiritual and if we are sons of Abraham we have to act like Abraham act and Abraham who became the father of Nations he believed in Hope against hope he became the father of many because it is what the word has said always called called with his word that he is the father of our faith and that same faith has to dwell in us to understand who we are the ones who are not belov are now Beloved the ones who are not people people can be called sons of Liv God God is trying Express his thought so that we can understand what we mean to him that we are beloved of God we're so beloved that he only son to die at cross for us so we would don't always be in the same condition but the riches the richness of his grace of his mercy be deposited in each one of usep Ephesians 17 in whom we have Redemption for his blood in the pardon of sin according to the riches of God's grace epesi Ephesians 1:8 I pray the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the Hope which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance and His holy people understanding this that now the gospel could be preached to the Gentiles and how the Gentiles were partakers of that promise we are part of that promise we are part of that which was revealed being Gentiles being F separated from God now we have the opportunity to return We with Christ when Christ dies being the only begotten Son of God the gra the Earth but when he res res resurrected as amongst many Breen that places us in a quality of children or Sons that's how God is looking at us God sees each one of us why because we are his beloved we are his people we are the reason why he came to Earth Deuteronomy 329 for the Lord's portion is his people and after everything that passed by Paul comes and he tries to get the people to understand this Myst so one way to understand it he talked to them in a term that they could see he says the riches of his grace The Riches of his Mercy now poured out unto the Gentiles Something Rich thinking someone who's wealthy because Grace has been expressed Mercy has been expressed this mystery thees of and pours it out over a people who did not deserve it it's by Grace it's by Grace not by works and God in his love he asked one thing in John 17 how many believe that the Lord Jesus Christ prayed for us the Lord Jesus Christ prayed for me you're so valuable that the Lord Jesus Christ prayed for you no brother how St John 1720 my prayer is not for them alone I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message throughout time by their message Believers have come even getting here with us Lord Jesus Christ said Lord I'm not just praying for those who are here listening but for those who will believe because of them and that's where you and I are included the Lord Jesus Christ prayed for us what a revelation what Revelation it's so simple because if I would have been there with brother BR I would have surrendered to God Jesus Christ would have lived in my time if you would have prayed for me I would have been free well then be free brother Lord Jesus Christ prayed for you what are you waiting for what are you waiting for that all they may be one that's his prayer father you as you are in me and I am may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me the glory you have given them Glory that you gave me so they may be one as we are one I and them and you and me so they may be brought to complete un then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me father I want those you have given me this is what the Lord asked for father I want those you have given me to be where with me where I am I want them to be with me where I am that was his desire he began to express so at that place where he was going those those who were elected by God those who had predestined could have a way back why he prayed and he said Lord he said I'm only asking for one thing that those who you have given unto me those who are mine the ones I'm giving my life for which if you have given to me that where I am they may be also so they can see the glory you because you love me before the creation of the world that was the desire of the Lord Jesus Christ that we could be with him he loved the SE so he understood the value of the SE his life at the cross calary that his desire may the only way his desire desire was that those me can be where I am as well Those whom I love those who were not people people sons of the Living God those who are not beloved I want them to be called my beloved that where I am they may that when they speak it's like I have spoken that is my prayer that is my desire those that are mine can come to where I am as well that's the value of the seed you're worth so much that the desire of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would be where he is at you say well brother it's cuz I'm I'm worthless evaluate yourself to evaluate this is what I'm doing so you can start an evaluation because the Lord Jesus Christ already did he began to analyze the situation in the beginning the Earth was without void but God saw that there was he came to and began to analyze the situation and he found the now he comes to L and begins to analyze situation once again and letting off the pressure we're living in a neurotic age nervous tension everybody's racing here and going there and going nowhere is just at the kind of an age it's a nervous age running from one place to another without really going anywhere stressed they're all stressed they don't know what to do with the pressure of life he says and I know that this church will be plagued with it as everywhere is plagued with it tabernac played with it everywhere the whole world it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90 miles an hour and then to get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready he says that's the time then it's the rushing it gets you to a nervous tension the wife says something a little contrary you want to fly off temper husband says something you'll Pat your foot and you tell him to get in the room he said well now husband I don't want no words with you I don't want to speak with you husband leave get out of here now I know that doesn't happen here amongst us I know that doesn't happen here says that it did happen in brandom Tabernacle why oh I'm so nervous see why what's the matter see all this together this tension building up then the results of it doing something wrong and acting out of place all of this tension causes people to act incorrectly situation once again he telling us what condition we're living in a nervous condition a neotic age where the pressure has has us running like like crazy people from one place to without having a reason to being in and over having to wait because I wait I get mad in the morning I want my coffee by a certain time and if it's not made we're going to have problems because if I don't get my coffee I begin to get jittery and the coffee is what calms me down and the only way I can be well is if I have my coffee last time I was speaking to a person who was talking about somebody who drinks about five cups of coffee by 10 morning and and somebody that works says well what's wrong with with that he says well no he's like I drink seven cups of cfee he says by 6:00 in the morning he said well now I understand why you drive the way you drive many times that's why we're going over we're going too fast we're speeding up our organism in out of external things and that's the condition of the age we live we're too nervous and God is expressing his trying to tell us you are my beloved you are my I'm analyzing the situation I don't want you to do the wrong I don't want you to act I want to give you my wi I want to give you my love but we're so preoccupied we don't have time to listen to word voice we don't have time to see the sacrifice that God did at Calvary for us we're so busy to go to work we're so busy while we're working because the rent is and I have to pay my car I have to do this because I'm bothered with my son because I'm bothered with my daughter my wife made me mad before I left to work we're so preoccupied in our mind that God doesn't have access to our heart depression takes hold of Our Lives because we don't have make contact with the Holy Spirit yes yes brother when God is telling us that he's looking at us and he's seeing us as valuable he's trying to make a deal with us and he comes through Christ word once again God made and he tells us I sent you a messenger seven Angel and he tells he says you are my beloved there will be a different Covenant than in the previous ages you are cors you are with Christ but I'm going to tell you something I'm going to place I'm going to speak about business now I'm going to tell you this way you're an associate of God you're an associate you're an associate partner in a partnership you have the right topr and make decisions depending on the ownership of your partnership on the he says I'm going to put in 50% expects you to place the other 50% but many times we don't understand in order to be partners we have to invest you can't be a partner without inves that's why many times we're ineffective we want to claim our without having paid the price you have to pay the price in order to claim the right of being partners with God you have to give your part which corresponds to so then you have the right to decide over the business in which you're in and God tells us I love you so much that you are my partner everything is PA I already paid the price I already di on the cross for you you are clean you're holy you're sanctified I see you clean before th my eyes now simply act on what I have told you if I told you you're free then be free I want an angel from the Heavens to come down and give me a slap on the face now when he slaps me I can see Thunders and lights and stars the angel already came brother and he already gave you a smack in the face but we were asleep not even that woke us up it's time for us to wake up and see who we really are because this age is a neurotic age we're so busy or preoccupied or so in a rush so then what is the solution if God loves us then we have to love him as well we have to show that we love him how are we going to show that the only way is having the love of God in our lives we have to have the love of God inside of us no brother that's impossible in other time it was difficult had access to that mystery God's thoughts had not been expressed so you could have the love of God in its fullness but comes God comes once again in the darkest age to give us access to to access the love of God God's love in our and when God sent his prophet and he told us he says says be certain that you have it God allow to go beyond the curtain of time he came back to give testimony nothing that doesn't have Divine love can enter God's love in your life be certain that you have it so then if God Express himself exess need God's love to enter in that means that we have access to God's love in our life we have access to experience God's love because us as Gentiles Christ in US this hope of glory Christ in US is the only way God can show his when he comes to us to reveal what he is in an age where everything is in a rush we want everything quick we get mad over any small thing if he doesn't greet me I get mad and if he greets me I also get mad doesn't greet me I'm mad CU he greet me but if he greets me I get mad because why did he greet me that way when someone's in that situation that means they don't have the love of God in their life what does it have to do with anything well in everything we have to reflect the Lord Jesus Christ they made ugly faces to him they rejected him they placed a crown of fors they spit on him how many times he wanted to greet someone and bless them and the pH was said nope he says you're not one of mine you hang around with oh with publicans and sinners I can't greet you because you're going to contaminate me they rejected him many times but he always forgave so one of the ways we express the the glory of God in our lives and when pardon or forgiveness is a characteristic in our lives pardon to forgive ourselves for what we have done and forgive others because constantly We are failing we're offended family is not focused in the word of God the children offend the parents offend the husband does understand the wife doesn't understand the husband the son doesn't understand the mother the daughter doesn't understand the brother father and the son doesn't understand it's a disaster and place all things together is the love God's love in our but God's love is so possible that we can have access to the love of God I have access to God's love what do I have to do do I have to do a certain type of ritual God placed at such a level that anyone can access it because Jesus only asked one thing and that we have fellowship with him he loved us so much that he left because the only way to have fellow with for his love in our heart so then when they ask brother brandham how can a Christian enter more deeply into the love of God now can somebody tell me it's there on the screen what does it say read the word pray brother Bram said he says good thing that God when he called them he didn't call Pure intellectuals he says because if he would called intellectuals I would have been set say he made it so simple that even I can understand it so God plac it so simp that we can enter into have God's love in our lives he says this is the portion that corresponds to you says read the word and pray so in a rush our first excuse is I don't have time I'm tired I can't pray because I got mad with my wife and my prayer doesn't go beyond the roof we always have a reason why we don't we have access to God's love in our lives God made it so simple that even the weakest person even the person with the lowest intellect can elevate a prayer and God will hear that prayer open the Bible they can open the message God can reveal it to that person he made it so simple so that no one would go astray avoids it doesn't let us pray and read the word so then what are we going to do how can a Christian enter deeper into the love of God prayer read the word prayer changes we have problems in the last thing we do is go and pray there's problems in our and first we fight and KS and throw whatever throw our cell phone in order to break yourself it be something really serious to break it why because we lose control that we're so worried in our but the pressure of to act in way that we shouldn't be AC we shouldn't be and that's where the seed loses value because the Devil comes and he brings all his demons from the fourth dimension to surround that person to bring an atmosphere the anointing brings information and that information will be like a USB we will try to come to your mind and give you certain information to give you a new something who you are not you're a child of God the devil wants to make that you're not Son of God you're because you've done the wrong because you fa devil will convince you and he will not stop will convince you that you're worthless until you lose form that's his purpose but God made it so simple so that we can go he only said he said read the word and pray something very important we have to meditate we have to meditate why because we're so busy now I'm going to say this someone tells me well brother I don't have time let me tell you I I don't believe that you don't have time I cannot believe that you can make all the excuses you want but I can't believe if you say you don't have time to pray you can tell me whatever you want you can't tell me that you don't have time to read the word of God you can't tell me that if you tell me that I don't believe it you're tired you're exhausted the pressures of Life are invading you but here there's a key that mer the rich of Mer the rich of the grace of God was poured into you the first person you have to have grace and mercy upon is yourself because the person that judges yourself the most you're supposed to pray and don't do it and because you didn't do it well I do it let me just sit down and watch your movie instead and we watch a movie that's two hours long but we don't have time to pray how many can say Amen giving you the mystery of the revelation of Lord Jesus Christ in the time we're living in the mystery is the mystery revealed is it doesn't matter how busy you are God can still make himself manifest through you all you have is make is to follow the Eternal principles of God oh what such a big word just pray and read the Bible read the message is that difficult it's not the problem is we don't know how to manage our time we don't know how we wake up in the morning and it seems like we're in a rush we walk out of the house without shoes and we got to go back and get it I forgot this I forgot my keys then we go back and then we remember we forgot something else we do about three to five we go back and forth three or four or five times cuz we forget things then we forget our lunch and so then we have to buy something in the afternoon we come like this we're sneaking around because if our wife finds out take our lunch maybe she's going to throw the plate at so let me go before she finds out because we have so much pressure we forget things the other day I was talking with somebody I was on the phone with somebody at work and they tell me he says wait wait hold a minute I'll call you back right now I say okay everything's good is everything good he said yeah I I just can't find my phone we're talking on the phone what do you mean you can't find your phone but he so used that he always has a here that he touched and he said my and he had the phone in his other hand talking to me I tell them when you come right now let me pray for you because we're so busy and we forget that God's Simplicity is what gives us the victory when we pray that connects me with when we read word we Med word that connects me with myself connects me with the value that I have I need a conne come his glory can his anointing can be but the anointing will not take advantage understand who I am that's why I have to meditate on what I read let me tell you another key how can a Christian go deeper into the love of God read the word and pray brother Brown didn't say you have to sit down and pray for an hour how long do you have to read the word for it to make be effectful or make an impact Jeremiah 2911 I know thoughts I have you say the Lord thoughts of good and not of evil for give you an expected end Jeremiah 333 to me and I will answer how much time did I stay on that one minute let's say about a minute Lord you say if I cry unto you you will respond I'm so busy I don't have time when I get home and I fall as I'm falling down to the pillow I'm already falling asleep I'm exhausted I don't have time for this I don't have time for that but I have five minutes to read the word I'm going to take advantage minutes and I will meditate I will read promise and that promise I will make it mine I'm gonna make the word of God effective in my life I'm G make that word cry unto me and I will answer that is my promise God said that he will answer me thank you Lord you take care of me provide my needs than you for my family what you've done in my life for me if I failed you I know that you hear me I know that you love me Great and Mighty thank you Father how long do that take you just don't get it I don't even have time for that so if you don't have five minutes five minutes then take advantage of when you're driving what do you listen to when you're driving oh brother it's cuz the kumas are if the only time you have free to listen to word is while you're driving you have the option do I listen to music or I listen to a preacher I don't think you need to be a scientist to know what decision to make listen to the word listen to the word the music or the word the music is just an instrument to bring for the atmosphere but there's nothing to come and make contact it doesn't matter what atmosphere is there has to be the essence the power it has to be there the word is what has the power I'll be finishing you have to do an analysis of your life because you have the thoughts abook 2 one 22 it says says write down the Revelation write down the Revelation write it down he's telling us to write the vision and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it write down the vision the prophet being Christ the word revealed theed a vision but God told him don't don't keep that Vision write it down write the vision so that whoever reads it may run they may run for the vision is yet appointed for time but at the end it shall speak though it ter wait for it because it will surely come and it will not t that's why brother Bram had to record the message he had to have it recorded because there was a people to come after to capture the vision there had to be a church P clean and without live in the power access to thoughts of God but the vision that's been written down can be made manif unless someone reads in the heart what the word says is real and God wants to use to manifest his glory if he desires God's love to be manifest problems in your home in your matrim read the word claim the promises of God get into the man the promise of God for your life don't stay don't say they just read the word run with that vision run with that word so that God can manifest it after the thoughts come then comes the spoken word in the message Jehovah Gyra God can do nothing for you until first by faith you accept it and believe it and confess it God can do nothing for you you know why he can't because he already did it that's why I can't do nothing and that's the part of the the society or the part he says now I've did my part now you do your part accept it believe it and confess it that's the only way God can act now is when you act first you have to act first you have to pray you have to read to listen to the message you have to read the word because he is the high priest making intercessions on your confession of your faith in his finished work you have to confess the work has been done that's why as we read Genesis Isaiah 55 God made an analysis do analysis in our life as well and God had the thoughts God had the thoughts he had the vision when he had the vision he spoke the word and the word came and made itself manif when we the situation say Lord I need to pray more I need to read the word more we begin to read the word to see that the word speaks about us by his stripes I am healed what he thinks about me I will not leave you nor forsake you that is he's talking about me God is tell me through the prophet that I have to believe it's for me understand it and accept and believe it and confess it my thoughts they begin to become a vision of The Eternity in my life eternity begins to dwell in me I begin to make contact with the Eternal begins to make contact with the Sun so then inside of me a vision comes for it says in habac sorry don't stay with the vision how I'm how am I going to run with it have to start to speak the word of God so it produces the results because the word that I bring forth will not return to me voice because I speak I already understand who I am I understand that God loves me I have grace and mercy with myself I will extend grace and mercy to everyone else I will forgive I will begin to have faith I will begin to do what I'm supposed to so that God May dwell in life and I will begin to manifest the word of God I will begin to speak the word of have contact with the Eternal God so he can May transform my life God placed it at a level that any person can do it he placed it at such level where the wisdoms and the the the people who study they trip over this because the children can walk through there because he made it so simple for us all he said the greatest thing we can have is the love of God in our lives and what do I need to do what I need to do for the god of love can manifest in my life and grow and grow and grow what I have to do pray and read the word who has to make that decision God no I have to make a decision I have to manage my time I have to manage my time to be able to do what I have to do be able to have that Divine fellowship with my creator that is the only way that we can escape the neurotic age it's the only way if we don't do that thetic sooner or later it will absorb us sooner or later it will absorb us and the prophet said says the problem is is just we explode we offend we make excuses and all this gets together the tension builds up the stress builds up builds up the problems build up anxiety builds up nervous nervousness build up and all of this produces a result that someone will act out of place and it will be something incorrect we have the exit of the anointing L is out we can have God's peace in our life we can have God's love in our lives but that's in our hands how can I go deeper into the love of God just read the word and pray it's in our hands God's thoughts He has expressed them and we have access to them all we have to do is make a decision I'm going to make a commitment no matter how tired I am no matter how bothered I am tense or how nervous I feel I'm going to pray when I begin to pray tension begins to leave then the word the word tells me that God loves me so I start to meditate all the bad things done but then God shows me his grace and his mercy and I see that all of God's promises are for me I can't accomplish that unless I meditate on the word if we can please stand the vision was projected we just have to catch it accept it know that it's for us confess it because the most difficult thing to do is especially when that which we want we can't see that is why we are royal Seed of Abraham because Abraham confessed what he didn't see he confessed it as if it was already done and that is what we have to do bring the atmosphere of God whatever we need it can come to our Liv but we have to make a commitment I will not move from there the presence of God until he I will fight with until God's glory is made manifest in my life I will pray I will cry out until God comes and answers the vision will make itself manifest the vision will not car I have to run with that vision because the promise is for us if you want it it's for you you just have to accept it let us pray Lord Jesus we give you thanks holy Heavenly Father you placed that such a simple that anyone can directly come into your presence the neurotic age tries to Tor the neurotic age tries to dece to make us think that we're something that we're not help us that the pressure of life may not change who we are may not change our decisions may be the number one thing in our lives you take the preeminence in our hearts Lord may you come and take complete contr we surrender to the Lord Jesus may we be able to pray something in our Liv we understand that prayer changes the circumstances most powerful thing that you've placed in the hands of the human being the word that you have spoken to us it's the most powerful weapon that you placed in the hands that powerful weapon is in our hands we have to use it Lord we give you thanks help us we're in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen am amen God bless [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
