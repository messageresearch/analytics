[15:04] the letter to the romans bought from
[15:07] paul
[15:08] number
[15:15] this is the 29th message we have on the
[15:17] message subject the letter to the romans
[15:24] i'll start reading from verse 12
[15:28] through verse 16
[15:38] he
[15:49] for as many as have sinned without law
[15:52] shall also perish without law and as
[15:54] many as have sinned in the law shall be
[15:56] judged by the law
[16:07] for not the hearers of the law are just
[16:09] before god but the doers of the law
[16:11] shall be justified
[16:27] for when the gentiles which have not the
[16:29] law do by nature the things contained in
[16:31] the law these having not the law are
[16:34] allah unto themselves
[16:49] which show the work of the law written
[16:52] in their hearts their conscience also
[16:54] bearing witness and their thoughts
[16:57] the mean while accusing or else excusing
[17:00] one another
[17:08] in the day when god shall judge the
[17:10] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[17:12] to my gospel
[17:22] them
[17:25] [Music]
[17:32] all along on the road
[17:35] allah
[17:40] [Music]
[17:47] every step
[17:48] that you take this great eye is awake
[17:53] there's an eye
[17:56] watching you
[17:59] watching you
[18:02] watching you
[18:05] every day
[18:07] mine of course you pursue
[18:12] watching yourself
[18:15] watching you
[18:18] there's an awesome
[18:21] watching
[18:25] [Music]
[18:32] [Music]
[18:41] foreign
[18:48] [Music]
[19:00] [Music]
[19:02] foreign
[19:05] [Music]
[19:23] to the romans
[19:29] and being that this is the 29th take
[19:32] take number 29 on this series
[19:41] that's last sunday we took the eighth
[19:43] message on the manifestation of the sons
[19:45] of god
[19:54] and this morning i'd like to start on a
[19:57] short thought on the series
[20:02] this is going to be my first message
[21:00] is your
[21:13] perhaps if i read it from the greek
[21:19] verse 15 says like this
[21:28] is who demonstrate the work of the law
[21:32] written on their hearts
[21:42] yellow
[21:47] their conscience co-attesting and the
[21:50] reasonings
[21:51] between each other accusing or defending
[21:56] and
[23:06] the
[23:15] in a day when according to my glad
[23:17] tidings
[23:18] god will judge the hidden things of men
[23:21] through christ jesus
[23:27] so the word a test attesting is to give
[23:30] a witness test testify
[23:34] that's why i noticed
[24:16] to draw something
[24:23] i won't be able to refer to the circle
[24:24] this morning because i won't be able to
[24:25] get that far this morning
[24:27] okay that is
[24:42] brother is going to be drawing up three
[24:44] circles
[26:22] another
[26:35] uh
[27:59] uh
[28:42] even though i have the outside body
[28:44] young
[28:46] even though i have a spirit
[28:51] there must be something in the very most
[28:53] inner part of my being
[29:10] for us to line up the three in one
[29:15] but i noticed something yes
[29:19] that the spirit has conscience
[29:23] in order not to confuse us
[29:39] [Music]
[29:47] uh
[30:04] i'd like to re-emphasize what i spoke on
[30:06] last time
[32:24] is
[32:25] that body in itself
[33:37] what was the life we were going to live
[33:38] while we were on the earth
[33:42] because the apostles
[33:44] he explains and tells us like this
[33:48] that is
[34:32] his attributes of savior healer and so
[34:34] forth
[34:38] he permitted sin to enter into the world
[34:44] and being that way we bypass our eternal
[34:46] home
[35:57] name was when we were born our name was
[35:58] written so that we would know what kind
[35:59] of life we were going to live
[36:03] but then there was an end to that
[36:07] then our name surfaces
[36:24] we come to prove to
[36:52] we must grow
[37:06] baby does not
[39:37] i'm following
[40:03] how many of you love god
[40:21] about six hours
[40:36] the book of revelation chapter 50.
[40:39] and the subject is
[40:42] your conscience
[40:45] and the judgment day
[41:33] judgment
[41:36] we understand that the the rights of
[41:38] jesus christ
[41:39] will be there
[41:41] but not being judged
[41:44] rather being standing at the side of the
[41:45] case
[42:13] the hot
[42:14] carriers are the farmers
[42:18] the janitors
[42:20] the welders
[42:22] governors
[42:24] kings presidents presidents
[42:28] are all there
[43:18] [Music]
[43:24] another
[43:45] and the dead were judged out of those
[43:47] things which were written in the books
[43:48] according to their works
[44:34] is
[44:48] son
[45:16] against
[47:06] [Music]
[47:07] page 970
[47:12] and the books were opened
[47:15] the books of the sinners
[47:18] and another book was opened
[47:21] which was the book of life
[47:58] 18.
[48:18] is
[48:25] for i testify unto every man that hears
[48:27] the words of the prophecy of this book
[48:29] if any man shall add unto these things
[48:31] god shall add unto him the plagues are
[48:32] written in this book
[48:45] and if any man shall take away from the
[48:46] words of the book of this prophecy that
[48:48] takes away
[48:49] god shall take away his part out of the
[48:51] book of life
[48:52] because he says
[48:54] this locker it feels dislocated
[48:58] you take away
[49:41] and whosoever was not found written in
[49:42] the book of life was cast into the lake
[49:44] of fire
[49:46] so there's there is a danger
[49:48] for your name
[49:51] to be taken out of the book of life
[50:09] is
[50:52] two first corinthians
[51:05] moreover it is required in stewards that
[51:08] a man be found faithful
[51:20] but with me it is a very small thing
[51:22] that i should be judged of you or a
[51:25] man's judgment yea i judge not my own
[51:27] self
[51:32] i judge not myself i don't even know
[51:33] myself
[52:45] with the hot iron
[52:49] they take like a rod
[52:53] get it really really burning hot and
[52:54] they're serious
[52:57] do away with that
[53:26] for i know nothing
[54:08] god
[54:57] until the lord come who will who both
[55:00] will bring to light the hidden things of
[55:01] the dark side will make manifest the
[55:02] councils of the hearts and that
[55:05] then shall every man have praise of god
[55:07] amen
[55:11] there's something there that goes off
[55:12] into something else and i'll just leave
[55:13] it there
[55:16] have a time next time
