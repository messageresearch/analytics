[37:51] Hebrews chapter 9 verse 15.
[37:59] read the following is
[38:25] 9 15 in Hebrews for this cause he is a
[38:28] mediator of the New Testament that by
[38:31] means of death for the Redemption of the
[38:33] transgressions that were under the first
[38:36] testament they which are called might

[38:40] inheritance
[38:42] amen you may please take your seats
[38:49] once again God bless every one of you
[38:51] this morning
[38:52] for me it's an honor
[38:56] thank our pastor for this privilege okay
[39:00] foreign
[39:46] I'm going to just talk to you for a few
[39:48] moments
[39:51] last time it was my life to speak
[39:55] I spoke for a few minutes
[39:59] we spoke a little bit of what an
[40:01] inheritance is
[40:03] that's why I read the scripture
[40:06] is
[40:08] a complete Plan of Redemption
[40:12] if you read from verses 9 to verse 15.
[40:15] you'll be able to read it all at all
[40:19] but this morning
[40:22] like speak of an eternal inheritance it
[40:25] is yeah
[40:26] inheritance is
[40:30] an effect of inheriting
[40:36] has no beginning nor end
[40:40] Ed
[40:42] before I get too far ahead
[40:48] I'd like to ask what inheritance are we
[40:51] going to leave our sons and daughters
[40:52] lately
[40:57] I've been able to listen to some
[40:59] messages from Brother Bernie yes
[41:02] which is called the Christian home it's
[41:06] a series of one two and three uh
[41:31] and that's where you can find the
[41:33] messages
[41:36] so I heard a little of those three
[41:38] messages
[41:40] foreign
[41:42] and brother Bernie covers a lot
[41:47] I'm going to cover myself with religion
[41:51] I still had not yet got to Phoenix
[41:53] Tabernacle
[41:55] when brother Bernie preached these
[41:57] messages
[42:20] there the person interpreting me yes
[42:26] that's what I say it was before 79. I
[42:30] don't have the exact date speaks
[42:36] very explicitly okay what a Christian
[42:39] home is
[42:42] you may say well now while my children
[42:45] are grown yeah what am I going to listen
[42:47] to those for now
[42:50] remember the grandchildren are on their
[42:52] way the great
[42:55] grandchildrenheit
[42:57] so you need to know everything brother
[42:58] Bernie said
[43:00] for there are things yes
[43:03] but only brother Bernie could say
[43:08] we're not trying to exalt ourselves or
[43:10] lower ourselves
[43:13] but if you listen to if you listen to
[43:15] brother Bernie's these messages
[43:17] you'll be able to understand
[43:19] why he said those things
[43:22] Diabla
[43:25] is
[43:26] and he hits hard on the parents
[43:29] moms and dads
[43:36] he says mom stays home and watches over
[43:39] the children
[43:41] watches over them educates them
[43:45] and sends them to school
[43:47] but brother Bernie says
[43:54] we want our children to be educated in
[43:57] school
[44:00] brother Bernie says there that children
[44:02] are educated at home
[44:04] and if you listen to these messages
[44:07] you'll understand
[44:09] foreign
[44:52] teaches them
[44:54] and she's the supervisor
[45:03] as they have jobs they know what a
[45:05] supervisor is what a manager is
[45:09] Mom what she is at home
[45:12] he says that the the father is the one
[45:15] in charge
[45:16] in the evening when father comes home
[45:22] mom tells them well he behaved and and
[45:25] she misbehaved
[45:40] for us not to be too cruel
[45:44] to speak to our children
[45:46] but first of all brother Bernie says
[45:50] Mom and Dad have to sit down together
[45:54] say this and this happened
[45:57] what are we going to do
[46:00] and both need to be in agreement what
[46:03] they're going to be doing
[46:06] foreign
[46:20] we prefer to be at work to be at home
[46:24] I worked for many years he
[46:28] is and it's easier you got
[46:31] ta go and clock in at work
[46:35] get a break every two hours
[46:38] get your lunch break
[46:42] but mom when she gets her break or when
[46:45] does she take her lunch
[46:48] even worse if she's struggling a little
[46:50] into it
[46:52] so I do want to speak a little bit about
[46:54] work
[46:56] sometimes we want
[47:00] for our children to follow our footsteps
[47:03] and that's good
[47:05] if I'm a
[47:07] mechanico may my son be a mechanic
[47:11] but also myself as a father
[47:17] I got my hands very dirty my uniform
[47:20] dirty
[47:22] hope my son gets an easier job
[47:26] but with time our children realize that
[47:30] there's not an easy job
[47:34] agenda
[47:41] and I buy an agenda for the year yeah
[47:46] and they're an agenda Proverbs are
[47:49] written notes
[47:52] one of them reads
[47:56] choose a job that you love yes
[48:00] and that way it won't feel like a job
[48:05] how many do we have a job that we don't
[48:07] like
[48:08] or that we haven't liked
[48:10] but we go to work
[48:13] to help our family move forward
[48:17] if you're there at work just thinking
[48:19] you're going to make your boss Rich okay
[48:24] he's going to be able to build another
[48:26] home and you don't even have enough to
[48:27] eat
[48:28] you won't be happy at work
[48:33] you need to have a chain of thought that
[48:36] with this money and be able to help my
[48:37] family move forward
[48:40] soon I'll try and get a better job
[48:43] but years go by
[48:45] you know and when does it get that other
[48:47] job
[48:50] here when I got here for 10 years I was
[48:53] at this job
[48:55] and I worked and what I needed to work
[48:59] to help my family uh move forward
[49:02] after 10 years
[49:05] I was able to get a job that I loved
[49:10] in in Mexico I had a job where I worked
[49:12] with heavy machinery
[49:14] and then I hear with the years I was
[49:17] able to get a job with that type of
[49:18] Industry
[49:21] that's why I didn't hear a brother
[49:23] Bernie's advice
[49:28] be a barber
[49:40] I didn't understand what a barber was
[49:43] years later
[49:45] brother Bernie told me
[49:49] why didn't you listen to me
[50:11] I wanted you to get your barber's
[50:13] license
[50:35] he's also an engineer thank God
[50:47] but if I was a good Barber
[50:52] you are Miss Universe
[50:58] like what brother Bernie wanted
[51:01] he didn't explain at all
[51:05] and don't think I'm blaming brother
[51:06] Bernie
[51:08] it was my fault
[51:10] I like my job bingo
[51:15] been retired for a little bit more than
[51:17] three years
[51:18] I'd like to go back sometimes okay
[51:26] even though it wouldn't be a bad idea
[51:30] medicine
[51:32] but my family the ones that still work
[51:34] at the employment where I used to work
[51:36] tell me
[51:37] if you get back there how are you on the
[51:39] spot
[51:40] but I stop and think
[51:45] so I'm going to drive more to the
[51:48] hospital in the pharmacy then drive over
[51:49] there
[51:51] Bonito
[52:03] why am I reading so much about work
[52:07] and second Thessalonians
[52:12] from seven to ten
[52:19] these were quotes from the Bible
[52:22] that brother Bernie taught us
[52:36] you see
[52:41] me
[52:46] for yourself know how you ought to
[52:48] follow us for we behave not ourselves
[52:51] disorderly among you
[52:53] Nico
[53:00] fatigue
[53:06] neither did we eat any man's breath or
[53:09] not but rot with labor and travail night
[53:12] and day that we might not be chargeable
[53:15] to any of you
[53:17] foreign
[53:27] we have no power but to make ourselves
[53:29] an example unto you to follow us
[53:39] for even
[53:41] when we were with you
[53:42] this we command you that if any would
[53:45] not work neither should he eat
[53:49] if no one wants to no this is
[53:56] you can't work with glory to God you
[53:59] worked for many years already
[54:01] you may feel like going back to work
[54:03] yeah
[54:06] your mind you think you're strong enough
[54:08] to go to work
[54:09] foreign
[54:36] when I said when I read of not
[54:39] yes
[54:41] it's freely or or freely given
[54:47] in other words the Apostle Paul
[54:50] was trying to gain what he ate
[54:54] it is
[55:02] we have to work
[55:10] have something that Rings like this
[55:12] they say
[55:14] education is
[55:16] education is the main garment
[55:19] so the Feast of life
[55:31] so I wasn't able to educate myself
[55:34] and your children have are able to
[55:37] educate themselves
[55:38] back them with all you can
[55:41] okay
[55:44] my son is in a mailman
[55:47] my daughter is a teacher
[55:51] why is my daughter a teacher
[55:55] I know that'll make a lot of money
[56:00] I asked my daughter why are you a
[56:02] teacher foreign
[56:33] foreign
[56:37] foreign
[57:08] I like numbers
[57:13] so brother Danny and his wife
[57:18] the pros and cons of professions
[57:25] he wants to follow his dad's footsteps
[57:27] to meet a barber
[57:29] yeah
[57:31] this and that can happen
[57:35] but if you get this other career is
[57:38] listen that may happen
[57:43] we like for our children to do what we
[57:45] ask them to do foreign
[58:31] and every one of us foreign
[59:26] God bless you
[59:29] [Applause]
[59:39] yeah
[59:42] going back on what we said in
[59:49] Eternal inheritance
[59:51] and uh and when working
[59:55] right uh if I've had something from my
[59:58] father
[1:00:00] it's a good example
[1:00:02] it's a life lived
[1:00:05] and that that uh that example that he's
[1:00:07] given me
[1:00:09] that I've gotten from my parents
[1:00:13] this inheritance that I've gotten from
[1:00:16] my parents
[1:00:17] you know it has been the this pattern
[1:00:20] that they've given me
[1:00:22] you know to work hard and to be
[1:00:26] disciplined I've gotten I've been very
[1:00:29] fortunate
[1:00:30] you have gotten that from my parents
[1:00:32] I know I have a long way to go
[1:00:36] I know maybe my dad would tell you the
[1:00:38] same thing
[1:00:39] in little details but moving forward
[1:00:43] with that
[1:00:45] when my dad told me what he was gonna
[1:00:47] try to go forward this morning
[1:00:51] and he was going to go forward with
[1:00:53] speaking on on this uh of working and
[1:00:58] Eternal inheritance
[1:01:00] you know being able to give the advice
[1:01:03] that he gave us
[1:01:05] you know I I went back to thinking on
[1:01:07] well we covered a little bit last time
[1:01:11] we talked a little bit about Luke 10 2.
[1:01:15] it was a message that brother Bernie
[1:01:18] uses
[1:01:19] the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:23] he speaks on a lot about about laborers
[1:01:27] you know when we covered this
[1:01:30] we were talking about uh where we were
[1:01:33] at of two weeks ago
[1:01:36] you know and maybe being able to look
[1:01:38] forward
[1:01:39] and and being able to think and say you
[1:01:42] know I want to be better this year
[1:01:45] and and I and I that's what I took from
[1:01:48] this message
[1:01:50] that I wanted to be better
[1:01:52] and I wanted to be more of more of a
[1:01:55] worker
[1:01:56] and try to have that mindset
[1:02:00] and so try to move forward with that
[1:02:04] where I'm not going to ask you to turn
[1:02:06] to it
[1:02:07] in Luke 10 2 Lucas
[1:02:10] the Harvest truly is great
[1:02:15] but the laborers are few sobreros you
[1:02:19] know that's a big thing that brother
[1:02:21] Bernie uses in this message in number
[1:02:22] two
[1:02:26] you know he he's speaking to the people
[1:02:28] and at the end of the first message
[1:02:33] he says you know we speak of these Great
[1:02:36] Men of Matthew
[1:02:39] Lucas John and they're and they are
[1:02:42] great men
[1:02:43] but he tells the congregation
[1:02:46] you have to understand
[1:02:48] they were not greater than what we are
[1:02:51] okay
[1:02:53] if you were to understand he says
[1:02:56] there are men like Matthew
[1:02:59] men like Mark here in this in this
[1:03:02] taverns
[1:03:04] and when we have that here you know men
[1:03:08] like those Hombres that are able to help
[1:03:10] us today
[1:03:12] you know
[1:03:13] brother Bernie says there so he asks you
[1:03:17] know what is the will of God
[1:03:20] you know it's to receive the receiving
[1:03:23] the one that he has sent
[1:03:26] right the one that Moses had spoken of
[1:03:29] to receive him to receive the Lord Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ
[1:03:34] that was uh something that we tried to
[1:03:36] cover
[1:03:37] last time and just speak a little bit on
[1:03:40] that
[1:03:41] and so and we're going on to that uh the
[1:03:44] word laborers
[1:03:48] you know our brother Bernie also said
[1:03:51] that he was going to entitle the message
[1:03:58] he just says that really quickly but he
[1:04:00] wants to talk about laborers
[1:04:03] so he goes on he's like oh I want to
[1:04:06] speak on on laborers you know and it was
[1:04:09] something that I that I wanted to move
[1:04:10] forward with
[1:04:11] because it's it's a I wanted to take it
[1:04:14] along with what my father had said
[1:04:17] you know right before the scripture in
[1:04:19] Luke 10 2.
[1:04:21] you know there's a lot that's happening
[1:04:24] and we read a word that is this is It's
[1:04:27] entitled in the Bible
[1:04:29] where the Lord has compassion
[1:04:32] right right before this you know the
[1:04:35] Lord Jesus Christ is giving teachings
[1:04:37] you know he gives the teaching of oh if
[1:04:40] you if you want to come with me
[1:04:41] you know take up your cross
[1:04:44] no deny yourself and then follow me and
[1:04:48] this is one of the ones he gives you
[1:04:51] know and then there's a young lady
[1:04:52] that's resurrected
[1:04:55] a woman that is healed
[1:04:58] you know two Blind Men are healed
[1:05:02] a man that was mute
[1:05:04] recovers and speaks
[1:05:08] and these are the things that are
[1:05:10] happening right before this the
[1:05:11] scripture comes up
[1:05:12] and
[1:05:14] then if it will turn real quickly to
[1:05:16] Matthew 9 I'll be Matthew 9 35.
[1:05:20] this is where all the things that were
[1:05:22] happening before
[1:05:24] and in 35 it reads
[1:05:27] and Jesus went about other cities and
[1:05:30] villages
[1:05:31] teaching in their synagogues and
[1:05:33] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[1:05:35] healing sicknesses and every disease
[1:05:37] among the people
[1:05:38] is
[1:05:49] so this is all that was happening right
[1:05:51] before right before
[1:05:55] but when we saw the multitudes 36 he was
[1:05:58] moved with compassion on them because
[1:06:00] they were fainted and were scattered
[1:06:02] abroad as sheep having no
[1:06:08] shepherdsas pastor
[1:06:13] 37 then sayeth he unto his disciples the
[1:06:18] Harvest truly is plenteous but the
[1:06:20] laborers are few
[1:06:27] therefore the lord of the Harvest that
[1:06:30] he will send forth laborers into the
[1:06:32] Harvest
[1:06:40] Campos
[1:07:05] that's what he refers as the Harvest
[1:07:08] Right Los Campos agriculture it's the
[1:07:10] Harvest the fields
[1:07:13] what's the script is telling us here
[1:07:17] you that follow me
[1:07:19] you ask me
[1:07:22] for me to do what I'm gonna do that's
[1:07:24] what the scripture is
[1:07:25] and I said in Spanish because that's the
[1:07:29] way where the Bernie brought it
[1:07:31] and that message was preached in Spanish
[1:07:34] it was in 1988 so maybe there was an
[1:07:36] interpreter in the back
[1:07:38] but the recording is just for the
[1:07:40] burning
[1:07:43] he places the foundation there
[1:07:46] the laborers
[1:07:48] he says when he's looking upon the
[1:07:50] Harvest Lord Jesus Christ looking upon
[1:07:52] the Harvest
[1:07:53] what's he talking about
[1:07:55] was he talking about the fields when he
[1:07:59] says
[1:08:02] um brother Bernie says that that's is
[1:08:04] it's not like the crops
[1:08:08] it's all the people
[1:08:10] looking upon the people the Harvest
[1:08:13] truly is great
[1:08:15] but the laborers
[1:08:18] you know and uh
[1:08:20] and you know what is a labor right okay
[1:08:27] that does what they need to do
[1:08:30] you know maybe discipline or moves
[1:08:32] forward with it
[1:08:34] and these are the type of workers that
[1:08:37] uh brother Bernie is mentioning towards
[1:08:41] you know like we have examples here we
[1:08:44] mentioned the last time
[1:08:48] that's that's a labor that's a worker
[1:08:52] associate pastors when it comes to the
[1:08:55] Sunday School those are workers people
[1:08:59] they come come early you know get ready
[1:09:06] they're checking everything that the
[1:09:08] mics
[1:09:09] or someone comes and they cleansea
[1:09:13] Bernie says it's all work
[1:09:15] there's just so much work and there's
[1:09:19] work everywhere
[1:09:20] foreign
[1:09:59] but that's kind of stuff that it takes
[1:10:01] work
[1:10:02] you know it takes work for one to to be
[1:10:06] here
[1:10:07] in the evening away from your family
[1:10:11] the drive here and practice to sing a
[1:10:15] song to honor the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:18] and that was the purpose that each one
[1:10:20] of them did it
[1:10:21] and that's the reason why we have those
[1:10:23] specials foreign
[1:10:50] that's when he brings up more uh more
[1:10:53] examples
[1:10:54] right in in the in the first message
[1:10:57] that's when he maybe brings up about
[1:10:59] Mark and when he brings about Paul trial
[1:11:03] Marcos and then he he says they say you
[1:11:06] know there are there are more than one
[1:11:07] type of worker in the in the physical
[1:11:11] there's physical and then mentality you
[1:11:15] can be praying
[1:11:16] that's that's work that's needed
[1:11:19] and of course you need to get here early
[1:11:22] but if you if you're there at your house
[1:11:25] you get up early on Sunday morning and
[1:11:28] you pray today be with the person that's
[1:11:31] going to speak be with the song
[1:11:33] you know and those type of work is what
[1:11:37] we need yes
[1:11:38] and people that are willing to do those
[1:11:40] kinds of jobs
[1:11:44] why don't we have enough workers
[1:11:49] oh we go to the special services
[1:11:52] you know and uh the church sings a song
[1:11:55] is who do they praise
[1:11:58] who do they say that was that was a
[1:12:01] great job
[1:12:04] they say that to the pastor
[1:12:07] and people say oh I did all the work I'm
[1:12:10] the one that was here singing
[1:12:14] your church sounded amazing
[1:12:19] right that's the examples that brother
[1:12:21] Bernie is giving
[1:12:22] away I do all this work I get here early
[1:12:29] and they don't even give me 15 minutes
[1:12:33] I'm here I was just saying in general
[1:12:35] right I don't know if you heard dog he
[1:12:37] said I gave you 20 and my time is almost
[1:12:39] up
[1:12:40] what where the money says that that's
[1:12:42] how we think
[1:12:44] that we just oh
[1:12:46] they don't care about me oh no no it's
[1:12:48] important you know I'm doing the work
[1:12:51] I'm doing everything that I can
[1:12:53] and then they don't give me nothing yeah
[1:12:58] familiar
[1:14:55] let us be laborers said
[1:15:08] but I say this
[1:15:11] is
[1:15:14] paraphrasing what he said this is
[1:15:22] not received payment here in this world
[1:15:25] but receive its eternal life is
[1:15:29] the biggest human being can receive okay
[1:15:34] there's a payment for the Son of God
[1:15:40] has received the Revelation that we live
[1:15:42] in the most precious time
[1:15:46] and in the darkest time that has ever
[1:15:49] existed neces sometimes
[1:16:35] a person can never surrender 100 to God
[1:16:38] if he comes by fear
[1:16:42] until that person falls in love with God
[1:16:46] that's when he will surrender is
[1:17:03] small things
[1:17:05] that's how we can be
[1:17:57] it's contagious
[1:18:06] run them I have something here brother
[1:18:08] Graham says in English I'm already in
[1:18:11] English reached in 1959
[1:18:14] on November 15th
[1:18:17] my new ministry
[1:18:20] that's God yes part of God's program
[1:18:25] preaching is his program
[1:18:28] when he looked upon the apostles
[1:18:30] he looked upon the Harvest
[1:18:33] he said a harvest is ripe
[1:18:37] and the laborers
[1:18:40] pray the Lord of the Harvest
[1:18:43] he will send laborers into the Harvest
[1:18:47] how many remember that well why would
[1:18:51] they have to pray to the Lord of the
[1:18:52] Harvest
[1:18:55] to send laborers into his Harvest
[1:18:59] if the lord of the Harvest was standing
[1:19:01] there
[1:19:04] knowing it would be done why
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:59] to share this little place
[1:20:03] asking at this moment father you forgive
[1:20:05] us for anything
[1:20:07] we just want to accept
[1:20:12] so that you may give us the desire
[1:20:17] to be laborers for you
[1:20:20] give me your desires father give my
[1:20:23] brother and your desires

[1:20:37] Christ
[1:20:38] amen amen I bless you
[1:20:42] foreign
[1:20:43] [Applause]
[1:20:57] service of this year
[1:21:06] you can take your seats
[1:21:08] as they were speaking
[1:21:10] first of all with Brothers he's
[1:21:15] said that
[1:21:16] the work
[1:21:19] I started thinking back there well
[1:21:22] I think I work more
[1:21:25] retired
[1:21:26] then when I worked
[1:21:29] for a fact that put more hours
[1:21:37] all it is is criticized
[1:21:41] so I tell you this is
[1:21:44] in fact
[1:21:45] but it needs to be a revelation
[1:21:50] it needs to be a revelation
[1:21:55] with a thought
[1:21:56] that was brought
[1:22:00] if I don't have a revelation Revelation
[1:22:03] how can I be a worker
[1:22:06] if I'm not trained how can I be a worker
[1:22:12] why are there so many few workers in the
[1:22:15] fields
[1:22:16] not only in this church
[1:22:19] there's churches that you gotta beg
[1:22:21] people to help
[1:22:24] so we are the cream of the crops
[1:22:29] we ask people to do something
[1:22:31] and they do it because it has become a
[1:22:35] revelation
[1:22:37] if it's not a revelation
[1:22:39] Carlos where's the money
[1:22:44] where's my money
[1:22:45] well I had to do this I had to do that
[1:22:54] I don't get the pat on the back
[1:23:04] and I did all this work
[1:23:07] uh I'm sorry
[1:23:09] um
[1:23:12] let's see
[1:23:16] here come up here real fast like
[1:23:21] who is General Pershing
[1:23:26] uh who was Sergeant York sergeant
[1:23:32] um
[1:23:35] who was General Pershing
[1:23:39] who went into New Mexico
[1:23:46] he was the General
[1:23:51] Persians
[1:24:01] York York
[1:24:03] won the Congressional Medal of Honor
[1:24:05] canola congregation during World War One
[1:24:11] had a revelation
[1:24:15] more Pentecostal than anything else
[1:24:21] he refused to fight
[1:24:27] until he had the revelation of why he
[1:24:30] was fighting
[1:24:37] if you look up history
[1:24:41] two individuals that we don't know
[1:24:45] who cleans the church
[1:24:50] the only thing you know
[1:24:52] is thank God for brother Montoya
[1:24:58] you only remember the leaders
[1:25:02] but you don't remember the workers
[1:25:05] thank God for Jesus Christ but we don't
[1:25:09] remember
[1:25:11] the workers that worked for him
[1:25:16] it's a revelation
[1:25:20] and that's why we work
[1:25:22] not all people were called or the
[1:25:26] mission fields
[1:25:30] we want to go
[1:25:33] but many of us were not called
[1:25:36] to do that
[1:25:41] that Pastor was never called to the
[1:25:44] mission
[1:25:46] he was called to preach the gospel
[1:25:51] married people
[1:25:53] dedicate babies
[1:25:56] but he was never called foreign
[1:26:31] coming to church on Sunday afternoon
[1:26:36] Thursday night I mean we've been so
[1:26:39] relaxed
[1:26:42] I don't know no no say if I can take a
[1:26:45] Sunday night
[1:26:50] I'm just letting you know we're in
[1:26:52] laodicea yeah
[1:26:53] we're all relaxed
[1:26:55] having a great time
[1:26:59] dump it from here to there
[1:27:04] you work at it
[1:27:08] and as you work at it you either get
[1:27:11] more relaxed
[1:27:13] and you forget
[1:27:16] what you need to do
[1:27:21] or am I the only one
[1:27:24] are we relaxed as we relaxed
[1:27:29] within the family structure what's
[1:27:33] tearing a family down
[1:27:35] it's relaxation is
[1:27:40] foreign
[1:28:12] foreign
[1:28:45] we're starting the new year
[1:28:47] as we start a new year we are going to
[1:28:50] be concerns
[1:28:52] but it's up to you
[1:28:55] share with your family
[1:29:01] that we do need workers
[1:29:03] that's why we're training young people
[1:29:06] and then we're showing off
[1:29:10] I like to show off
[1:29:18] we have to show off talentos
[1:29:24] so
[1:29:26] foreign
[1:29:31] looking
[1:29:36] and I'm seeing young man
[1:29:40] I'm seeing a young man being able
[1:29:44] to express the revelation God has put in
[1:29:48] his heart
[1:29:49] because many churches
[1:29:57] what's in store for tomorrow
[1:30:00] I came from 77.
[1:30:05] excuse me I lived the 77.
[1:30:16] some of you were born in 77.
[1:30:21] they were still planning those potatoes
[1:30:24] but I have to train individuals
[1:30:28] if we don't train them who's going to
[1:30:31] take over tomorrow
[1:30:34] that's why we trained that's why
[1:30:37] Revelations
[1:30:41] because it seems that if we we didn't
[1:30:44] have training
[1:30:47] and I die tomorrow
[1:30:51] I die tomorrow
[1:30:58] those are the questions
[1:31:03] many pastors
[1:31:12] and they never trained the persona
[1:31:18] because all their young people
[1:31:20] foreign
[1:31:22] because they were never told
[1:31:25] that there's a better world for them
[1:31:31] we were brought up in a certain age
[1:31:37] that today we have a lot
[1:31:51] as we have been taught
[1:31:54] you're going to have to let him go
[1:31:56] sooner or later you will have to let him
[1:31:59] go
[1:32:00] they have to make that decision
[1:32:03] what they're going to do for the future
[1:32:06] and the more I give young people the
[1:32:09] more we rely foreign
[1:32:41] foreign but there will be a tomorrow
[1:32:45] and the more we can trainer
[1:32:49] the more we can teach
[1:32:54] the same thing that our Apostolic
[1:32:57] fathers taught us
[1:33:00] and not get away from that isn't that
[1:33:03] calling
[1:33:06] prior to singing
[1:33:11] there was an individual that needed
[1:33:13] prayer
[1:33:17] life has always been hard foreign
