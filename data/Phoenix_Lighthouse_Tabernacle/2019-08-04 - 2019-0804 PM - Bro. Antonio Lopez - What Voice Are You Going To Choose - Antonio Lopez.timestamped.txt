[30:56] when I was learning about the subject or
[30:58] stopping it at this table oh it was how
[31:00] do I know that the voice I am hearing is
[31:03] the voice of God
[31:04] yep romantic Amy pronto s como se que la
[31:06] voz escucha s la voz de Dios this
[31:08] question came way before like when I was
[31:11] in my teen years for the US Tahoe -
[31:13] Canasta pregunta primero beam ornamented
[31:16] it always comes when you're in ten to
[31:19] twenty you're never sure this is what

[31:40] branham's message for my secretary mano
[31:42] random it was what here is now Elijah it
[31:45] AK escucha Celia's and when we hear the
[31:48] thoughts that come into our mind when

[32:12] fructose so we have to examine the most
[32:15] examiner those thoughts to see if that
[32:17] if it come from God or from the dub but
[32:20] I suspect matrices being in the GOC been
[32:21] in El Diablo
[32:22] so as I was saying the I was reading I'm
[32:25] gonna read a little quote from or here
[32:27] is there Elijah
[32:28] okay while they were an extract of the
[32:29] case couch as Elias knew reads what we
[32:33] felt to see is to listen to the small
[32:36] the still small voice that speaks to us
[32:38] okay famous and various escuchar as a
[32:40] silver soiree a possibility no habla
[32:42] then wrap ourselves in his righteousness
[32:46] Dante's ROP Manos de justicia in Walker

[32:52] you speak to me saying Orpheus a blast
[32:55] at me does it mean or does it mean me Oh
[32:58] Lord significa que es para me Oh
[33:01] we always have those questions here at
[33:03] the church sympathy no Moses has built
[33:05] us a keel iglesias when the pastor is
[33:07] preaching past tourists a pretty candle
[33:09] and he hits her like right on the spot
[33:10] it latina is he talking to me
[33:14] Esther and um he does in did he just
[33:16] read my mind was going on stallion
[33:17] elementa que esta pasando because that's
[33:19] exactly what I'm going through
[33:20] okay okay me pass at me but I believe a
[33:23] lot of of the brothers and sisters here
[33:26] can relate to each other
[33:27] - monastic with an intended me because
[33:30] the pastor knows where the church is
[33:31] going to be a pastor 7 lo que esta
[33:33] pasando Glacia he knows what what
[33:36] problems are in the world that we have
[33:37] to face Sara cual estamos de nosotros
[33:39] tenemos que pasar and this morning esta
[33:43] mañana as our president was preaching or
[33:45] stopped recognize the past or some
[33:48] thoughts came to me I spent time in
[33:49] Tuscany romantic when he was saying that
[33:52] he was standing the gap for you and me
[33:54] first I said ok separately and I betcha
[33:56] por nosotros and then a thought comes to
[33:58] me Lopez I meant Amina me well if he's
[34:00] gonna stand in the gap she said well but
[34:02] I'll Appalachia put in then it means you
[34:04] can do whatever you want it was a split
[34:05] asset looking to get us you can if you
[34:08] don't want to come to church the pastor
[34:10] got si si okay let me Alec let's suppose
[34:12] is in it well then another thought right
[34:15] afterwards a it came you know you know
[34:17] the repent o author Pentimento well yes
[34:21] in one sense it's true it's a G and we
[34:24] sent it was better that but you have to
[34:26] do what the pastor's telling you to do
[34:28] but the meatiness guess a local pastor
[34:29] Tyson okay I guess so he can stand for
[34:31] you in the gap but guess I put up a
[34:33] report of stead in Appalachia you man I
[34:36] mean there's own we're always trying to
[34:39] find ways to make it easier for so
[34:41] victim was in court that money does SLO
[34:42] más fácil para nosotros well there's
[34:44] only one way from a second man era and
[34:46] that's true God
[34:47] yes porthos man I mean so I know we all
[34:52] go through that we get that but then God
[34:55] speaks to us right after and tells us
