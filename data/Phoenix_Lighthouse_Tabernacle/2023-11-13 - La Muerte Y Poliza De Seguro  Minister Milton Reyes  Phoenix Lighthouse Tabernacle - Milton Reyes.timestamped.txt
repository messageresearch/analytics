[0:07] what do you say brother R well no wait a
[0:08] minute let's take Israel down in
[0:12] Egypt there come a time where God said
[0:15] I'm going to send the death angel
[0:16] through the land and I'm going to take
[0:18] every one of the Elders of the family
[0:21] unless there's blood on the
[0:23] door that great night of the
[0:28] Passover
[0:45] now's Israel a promised people going to
[0:49] a promised land and they it's a night of
[0:52] the Passover the death angel is in the
[0:55] land and we hear a scream coming from
[0:58] down the street we look out two big
[1:00] black wings are waving down the street
[1:03] you think Israel is all excited no
[1:28] sir
[1:35] death was at the door the little boy
[1:37] looked out the window he's the oldest of
[1:39] the family he sees that big black angel
[1:42] he looks and said daddy do you love me
[1:46] sure son I
[1:58] you
[2:03] well Daddy am I not your firstborn yes
[2:06] you are son look at there
[2:08] daddy that angel got that little boy I
[2:12] know him I played with him Oh Daddy here
[2:15] he comes
[2:28] toward
[2:31] but son you see on that door
[2:35] post
[2:37] Hallelujah daddy will get me no sure son
[2:40] he can't get you why that's his promise
[2:44] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[2:48] go back and get your toys and start
[2:50] playing son there's no need to wearing
[2:53] we're in God's Refuge that all
[2:58] Ste
[3:26] foru Israel could sit back and read the
[3:29] Bible while the rest of them is
[3:30] screaming and Billy up steam Israel was
[3:33] relaxed why death right at the door what
[3:36] difference did it make it can't hurt
[3:54] them so when death comes
[3:58] to glory to God as long as God's
[4:03] requirement of blood's been placed on
[4:05] the L of my heart po what difference
[4:07] does it make it can't
[4:25] me the doctor says you're going to die
[4:27] tomorrow what difference does it make
[4:30] the blood is on the post you got to die
[4:34] anyhow but if that blood's been applied
[4:37] I've got a Resurrection coming
[4:56] amen amen Israel could be calm no
[4:59] building of steam for them because they
[5:02] know that the death angel couldn't
[5:04] strike them they were under the blood it
[5:07] was God's provided
[5:22] way now notice say can I be assured that
[5:27] our Christians here we are
[5:31] can I be assured of that I spoke on it
[5:33] last Sunday
[5:47] night now Israel was a promised Covenant
[5:51] people God's people they had been
[5:53] promised a land that was flowing with
[5:56] milk and
[5:57] honey so they uh they never seen that
[6:00] land not a one of them have ever been
[6:02] there but they had a promise of
[6:24] it they never been over there they
[6:26] didn't know nothing about the land but
[6:28] they were promised that land
[6:30] and they come out of their slavery by
[6:32] the hand of God to his prophet and was
[6:35] sojourning professing that they were
[6:37] pilgrims and strangers and was going to
[6:40] a land that they' never seen or none of
[6:42] them had ever seen
[6:45] it
[6:58] it
[7:13] so they come close to the
[7:15] borderline there was a great warrior
[7:18] among them named
[7:19] Joshua Joshua takes means Jehovah Savior
[7:23] and Joshua went over the Jordan into the
[7:27] promised land and come back was the
[7:30] evidence that it was a good
[7:49] land they brought a bunch of grapes and
[7:51] taken two men to pack it was just
[7:54] exactly what God said it was it was
[7:56] flooring milk and honey that should have
[7:58] made everyone of them
[8:12] rej josua brought back to evidence of a
[8:16] land that nobody know nothing about that
[8:18] God had promised to give
[8:20] them see because they were had a promise
[8:24] to land was on the road to
[8:28] it
[8:42] now one day the human race is in a
[8:46] trap and there comes someone to the
[8:48] Earth for the name of Jesus Christ Jesus
[8:51] means Jehovah
[8:58] savior
[9:05] and he went down to the J of death went
[9:08] over the Jorden in death and Rose up on
[9:11] Easter morning with the evidence that a
[9:14] man can live after he
[9:17] dies
[9:19] Hallelujah death is not the
[9:22] end Jesus
[9:24] proved that a man can live after he
[9:28] died
[9:48] he stood before him and he said before
[9:51] he left he said in my father's house is
[9:54] many
[9:54] manss it wasn't so I would have told you
[9:58] and I going and prepare
[10:14] place I'll go over and fix up a place
[10:17] and return back and receive you to
[10:21] myself that where I am there he may
[10:28] also
[10:37] after he died till the moon and stars
[10:40] and sun was ashamed of themselves he
[10:43] died till a Roman soldier pierced his
[10:45] heart with a with a spirit water and
[10:48] blood had separated he was the deadest
[10:51] of the
[10:58] Dead
[11:12] he went to the Grave like any man did
[11:15] his soul went to hell as the Bible said
[11:20] but on Easter morning he came back from
[11:24] Death hell and the
[11:26] grave and said I am he
[11:29] that was dead and I'm alive forever more
[11:32] and had the keys of death in
[11:57] hell I'm a man
[11:59] they said he's a spirit said give me a
[12:01] fish
[12:03] sandwich and eat fish and
[12:14] bread he was a man that died and went to
[12:18] the land and returned back with the
[12:20] evidence that a man can live after
[12:23] death what's death got to do with us hey
[12:26] man off the pressure
[12:44] not only that but he give us a promise
[12:48] what was it he give us the earnest of
[12:50] our
[12:57] inheritance
[13:00] he said now to prove this to every
[13:02] believer now you're walking down here in
[13:05] unbelief you don't believe the word
[13:08] you're walking in sin in the things of
[13:09] the world but he that believeth on me
[13:13] has eternal
[13:27] life
[13:37] notice now when we receive his Spirit we
[13:42] were once dead in sin and trespasses he
[13:45] gives us New Birth New Life what does he
[13:57] do
[14:02] he we die and are
[14:06] buried in Jesus amen we raise in the
[14:11] spirit from the worldly things onto the
[14:15] Heavenly things and tonight we are
[14:18] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[14:21] Christ
[14:27] Jesus
[14:40] how many Christians in here still love
[14:43] the world if you do you're are not a
[14:46] Christian you are a
[14:48] professor of Christianity and not a
[14:51] possessor amen for when I man wants
[14:53] Taste of Christ he's dead to the things
[14:55] of the world and by no means he has any
[14:57] desire
[14:59] go
[15:21] back what does it do the life Paul said
[15:24] that I once live I live no
[15:27] more yeah
[15:29] live not me but Christ in
[15:41] me he raised him from this low level of
[15:45] worldly sin up to a place that we
[15:48] ourselves can look back and see where we
[15:51] come
[15:57] from
[16:06] look back and see where we once lived
[16:09] now we live different what is it it's
[16:12] the
[16:13] assurance that we are dead and our lives
[16:16] are HID in Christ to God and are sealed
[16:18] by the Holy Ghost and raised above those
[16:20] things then we are a lie with the same
[16:25] evidence that he come back with to prove
[16:27] to us me I'm
[16:55] the land is glorious and this is a down
[16:58] payment
[16:59] this is the earnest of our Salvation
[17:01] it's the first money that holds the
[17:08] contract
[17:26] cont has everlasting life
[17:29] not come into condation but pass from
[17:31] Death onto life but off the pressure
[17:35] brother
[17:57] yes
[18:00] look as Elijah that great prophet a type
[18:04] of Christ Elijah the type of the church
[18:08] which a double potion of the Spirit come
[18:09] upon the
[18:21] prophet he walked to the jar one day a
[18:25] type of this day this government and
[18:27] things we have now
[18:31] you
[18:45] remember
[18:46] notice when Elijah following
[18:51] Elijah for a
[18:53] reason am where did he take him to
[18:57] Jordan
[19:00] up to the school of the prophets and
[19:01] down to
[19:13] Jordan Alan that's why he takes you
[19:16] through justification sanctification and
[19:19] doubt to receive
[19:23] life amen not to a denomination or some
[19:27] Creed but today to your
[19:29] spirit so you can be born
[19:51] again and Elijah Elijah struck that
[19:55] water walked across Jordan and Elisha
[19:58] followed him and when Elisha returned
[20:02] back to the land again on the other side
[20:04] he come back with a double
[20:21] potion we follow Jesus to his death
[20:24] burial and baptism death burial and
[20:26] Resurrection rather through baptism
[20:38] we believe in we're D to the things of
[20:41] the world confess that we're nothing
[20:45] baptized in his name buried with him in
[20:48] baptism raised with him in Resurrection
[20:51] our Spirits live up above the things of
[20:54] the world then we're in
[20:57] Christ
[21:18] now we got one
[21:21] potion when we return from across the
[21:23] death M of Jordan we'll have another
[21:27] potion
[21:28] the bodies that we now
[21:30] have with spirits that we have have the
[21:34] earnest the holy spirit that can't die
[21:38] because it's part of
[21:57] God bodies that we live in he eats my
[22:00] flesh and drinks my blood have
[22:03] everlasting life and I'll raise him up
[22:05] at the
[22:23] last what difference doesn't make atomic
[22:25] bombs or anything else let do
[22:30] of this one thing that we have eternal
[22:33] life through Jesus Christ Our
[22:49] Lord so why do we care about what the
[22:52] world's got to say why do we care about
[22:55] pressure don't make any difference to us
[22:58] why because we can let off the
[23:19] [Music]
[23:26] steam
[23:32] [Music]
[23:38] the world now with our heads bowed let's
[23:42] raise our
[23:49] [Music]
[23:56] hands
[24:04] [Music]
[24:17] [Music]
[24:22] our heavenly father Satan has lost the
[24:26] battle
[24:28] just be patient don't build up a steam
[24:32] standing here preaching on letting off
[24:35] the Steam and then Satan thought he
[24:36] could run me from the
[24:38] vit get me out of this alter call no
[24:41] Lord in my heart there was something
[24:44] burning saying there's somebody here
[24:46] there's somebody hunting for that
[24:56] rock
[25:18] we thank you Father for the victory when
[25:21] that last person walked to the altar the
[25:23] lights come on he's seen he lost might
[25:26] as well give up the
[25:43] stands tonight that number of Grace five
[25:45] precious Souls five j s u s f AI t h
[25:50] Grace g r a c e oh God you're God you
[25:54] never fail you're always
[25:56] right
[26:14] [Music]
[26:17] I'm looking standing on the side your
[26:19] sister Wilson's da I can remember that
[26:22] little girl I remember when you called
[26:25] her I remember the night at Newar Market
[26:28] long years
[26:30] ago down there that night I
[26:50] remember stand by our side a lady coming
[26:53] down from New York to souljour with us
[26:57] here stands a young man and a young
[26:59] woman just at this turning point when
[27:03] the world is out here doing all kinds of
[27:06] immoral dances and carrying on they've
[27:09] walked hunting for that
[27:14] [Music]
[27:26] rock
[27:31] at the end of thear stands a young fell
[27:35] his hands
[27:36] raised he he wants to find the
[27:40] rock Jesus you are that rock and you
[27:44] said this wherever two or three are
[27:47] gathered in my name I'll be in their
[27:49] midst then that rock is
[27:56] right
[28:11] it may seem very strange father very
[28:15] simple you make things so simple so that
[28:17] we won't eror but because that they
[28:20] raised out of their seat and come on the
[28:23] invitation because that Satan tried to
[28:26] keep them from doing it
[28:28] every effort he could put forth he tried
[28:30] to do it but he
[28:51] lost now as your servant I'm going to
[28:55] lay my hands upon them and anounce your
[28:58] blessings God may it follow because if
[29:01] they are honest and sincere to follow
[29:03] the leading of the spirit I do
[29:20] the that the soul of my sister shall
[29:23] never perish that the desire of her
[29:26] heart for eternal life will be granted
[29:28] to her through Jesus Christ
[29:40] name I lay my hand upon my sister and

[57:24] hands amen
[57:28] amen this as we're
[57:30] standing we'll be going to the
[57:33] scripture we'll be going to the Bas
[57:34] scripture which we have been
[57:38] reading we'll be reading Revelations
[57:40] 3:20 to
[57:45] 22 after that we'll be heading over to
[57:47] Romans 8:37 through
[57:52] 39 you look for it we always thank our
[57:54] pastor for his
[57:57] trust and the words reads
[58:08] thus behold I stand at the door and
[58:10] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[58:12] the door I will come into him and will
[58:14] sub with him and he with
[58:22] me to him that overcome will I grant to
[58:25] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[58:27] overcame and sat down with my father in
[58:29] his
[58:33] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[58:36] what the spirit sayth unto the
[58:38] churches we'll be heading over to
[58:45] Romans 8:37
[58:51] says n all these things we are more than
[58:53] conquerors through him that loved
[59:03] for I am persuaded that neither death
[59:05] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[59:07] nor powers nor things present nor things
[59:09] to come
[59:17] NE height nor depth nor any other
[59:20] creature shall be able to separate us
[59:21] from the love of God which is Christ
[59:23] Jesus our lord yes
[59:27] this evening I know we're on the topic
[59:29] of how can I
[59:30] overcome and I'd like to add a small
[59:34] subtitle we more than Overcomers in
[59:36] Christ Jesus you may take your seats my
[59:42] brothers truly we've learned a lot from
[59:44] what we've been speaking
[59:47] on I'll try to speak a little bit
[59:49] tonight about
[59:51] death to bring it as simple as I can
[59:59] and also a bit about the benefits of an
[1:00:01] insurance
[1:00:03] policy how many insurance agents do we
[1:00:05] have
[1:00:06] here I'll ask you once again later
[1:00:12] on we know that there's many types of
[1:00:17] insurances and it's Fallen my
[1:00:20] law he has
[1:00:23] allowed I've gone through a lot of um
[1:00:27] lot
[1:00:28] lawsuits and I know a little bit about
[1:00:33] insurances and I can stay here all night
[1:00:36] talking about the all the lawsuits I've
[1:00:39] had but we know that God is in all
[1:00:42] things but I'm going to stay in
[1:00:45] one on one
[1:00:51] occasion I was the Headmaster for one of
[1:00:53] the companies that I worked for
[1:00:58] for one of the weekends I invited that
[1:00:59] same group to do the roofing on my
[1:01:02] house that was many years
[1:01:08] ago at the first hour one of my friends
[1:01:10] that accepted to go he went up he
[1:01:14] fell and he broke his
[1:01:18] hand now we reach an agreement that I
[1:01:20] would help him
[1:01:22] out because I believe God is a right
[1:01:25] to try to help him but either way he
[1:01:28] sued
[1:01:30] me so the house insurance did not cover
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:35] that he got his
[1:01:39] lawyers I struggle to get a
[1:01:45] lawyer because no lawyer wants to take
[1:01:47] your case when there's no insurance
[1:01:49] company to back you
[1:01:52] up they're honest they say they were
[1:01:54] going after the bigger fish which is the
[1:02:00] insurance and through many references I
[1:02:02] was able to get a hold of
[1:02:04] one and he did represent
[1:02:07] me and we went to
[1:02:11] court and even my own lawyer told me we
[1:02:13] had about a 50% chance of
[1:02:15] winning can you imagine the hope that
[1:02:17] gave
[1:02:20] me that your own lawyer tells you you
[1:02:22] have a 50% chance of winning
[1:02:25] just but if they give us a
[1:02:27] tie and if the judge decides
[1:02:30] 5050 we still
[1:02:33] lose they have to give us 51 in order
[1:02:36] for us to win and by the grace of
[1:02:41] God that process went about two to three
[1:02:46] years they were trying to for close my
[1:02:51] house with the insurance they were
[1:02:53] trying to get money and for close my
[1:02:58] home and so for somebody that's
[1:03:00] something that cost you so much and they
[1:03:02] want to come and take it away from
[1:03:05] you so then things get
[1:03:08] complicated but God in the midst of the
[1:03:11] scene everything was able to be
[1:03:14] resolved they accused me that I had a
[1:03:18] company that I really did not have at
[1:03:20] that
[1:03:23] time
[1:03:25] but one of those things is what pushed
[1:03:26] me forward to start my small
[1:03:29] business and many times God works in
[1:03:31] different
[1:03:32] ways at the time we don't understand it
[1:03:36] but God is on the
[1:03:40] scene afterwards when we had our
[1:03:42] insurance on our small
[1:03:43] business another person fell once
[1:03:50] again it was about 3 feet tall there was
[1:03:52] no telling how
[1:03:54] he broke his
[1:03:57] foot but at this time we already had the
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:00] insurance and I was worried once
[1:04:03] again the insurance sent me a
[1:04:08] letter and the the insurance said Milton
[1:04:10] we're fighting for you so don't worry
[1:04:13] about
[1:04:14] it I asked them well what I have to
[1:04:17] do and they said well
[1:04:20] nothing he's like no we sent that letter
[1:04:23] to you
[1:04:26] so we're representing you in
[1:04:28] court so one can
[1:04:31] rest I feel the same way it's with
[1:04:34] Christ when we leave everything to
[1:04:37] him and we truly surrender to
[1:04:41] him it is God that is working with
[1:04:44] us
[1:04:45] amen but we have to
[1:04:49] surrender when somebody buys an
[1:04:51] insurance
[1:04:53] policy
[1:04:56] usually the one who buys it is not the
[1:04:59] beneficiary the beneficiary is the
[1:05:01] somebody
[1:05:03] else there has to be a
[1:05:06] testament it comes connected with the
[1:05:08] one who purchases the
[1:05:11] policy in The Testament you write
[1:05:13] down it's the car for so and
[1:05:16] so the furniture for the
[1:05:19] carpenter the house for sew
[1:05:23] and it's all written down in the
[1:05:27] deed no one can collect any of
[1:05:30] that until the one who wrote down the
[1:05:33] Testament until they pass
[1:05:36] away now why do I tell you
[1:05:38] this because of other legal issues this
[1:05:42] year I had to visit another
[1:05:45] lawyer but I'll share that with you on
[1:05:47] another
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:51] occasion but what I did know is that I
[1:05:53] could create a testament or
[1:05:55] deep and I got a bit
[1:05:58] afraid because they started asking me
[1:06:00] some type of strange
[1:06:06] questions that's when one realizes that
[1:06:08] death is is
[1:06:12] real is when you die who do you want to
[1:06:14] have your
[1:06:16] body you want an
[1:06:19] autopsy and I was a bit
[1:06:23] afraid
[1:06:28] what does an opop have to do well just
[1:06:29] do whatever I was already
[1:06:33] there where do you want to be
[1:06:37] buried do you want them to send you back
[1:06:39] to your home country or you want it to
[1:06:41] be here so they could buy your pot of
[1:06:42] plot of
[1:06:45] land what do you want with your body do
[1:06:47] you want them to burn it or they wanted
[1:06:48] to leave
[1:06:50] it and I really just started to
[1:06:53] think there are questions that one does
[1:06:55] not want to
[1:06:59] hear another question they asked if
[1:07:01] you're in a vegetable
[1:07:03] state would you like your wife to pull
[1:07:05] the
[1:07:07] plug and asked well what if we're B in
[1:07:09] the vegetable
[1:07:11] State then we have to find other people
[1:07:15] so they can they can pull the plug on
[1:07:16] both of
[1:07:20] us so there are questions that make you
[1:07:22] think
[1:07:24] what do you want to do with your
[1:07:26] organs are you going to donate them no
[1:07:30] I'm not donating
[1:07:32] nothing because if I'm alive take me
[1:07:38] apart our brother our Apostle
[1:07:40] brother he tells us in these
[1:07:43] times when a wife or a
[1:07:47] husband when they begin to get sick
[1:07:49] brother Garcia
[1:07:50] says they already have a bride or a
[1:07:53] groom ready
[1:07:57] if the sick one goes and
[1:07:59] dies within weeks or within
[1:08:03] months they' already got married once
[1:08:07] again sometimes they count their
[1:08:09] chickens before their eggs
[1:08:12] hatch brother gcia
[1:08:18] says he is that the messenger maybe did
[1:08:20] not reach the seventh
[1:08:22] grade it wasn't a man with much
[1:08:27] education but he sat with great
[1:08:33] businessmen they would ask him why are
[1:08:35] you with businessman he says well I'm a
[1:08:37] businessman myself he says what do you
[1:08:40] sell he said
[1:08:44] assurance and he went to the dictionary
[1:08:46] says that insurance and Assurance is the
[1:08:48] same
[1:08:49] thing and they would ask
[1:08:52] him kind of company a Celestial
[1:08:57] company now question is how many
[1:08:59] insurance agents do we have with the
[1:09:00] celestial company
[1:09:02] here I have a quote here that I would
[1:09:04] like to share with all of
[1:09:11] you the message fellowship with God
[1:09:13] through reconciliation preach in 1956
[1:09:19] 0120 not too long ago an insurance agent
[1:09:21] was at my
[1:09:22] house
[1:09:27] nothing against insurance but he said
[1:09:29] Billy I want to sell you a
[1:09:31] policy I said I got
[1:09:36] insurance he know what I didn't have any
[1:09:38] insurance
[1:09:42] Earthly I said I got insurance my wife
[1:09:44] looked around asked me to say wait
[1:09:46] what's
[1:09:50] that said I have insurance he said Billy
[1:09:52] what kind of insurance you got
[1:09:55] I said
[1:10:07] insurance he said Blessed assurance
[1:10:09] Jesus is mine will four Taste Of Glory
[1:10:12] Divine ha of salvation purch of God born
[1:10:14] in his Spirit washed in his blood
[1:10:19] Billy he said Billy that's all right I
[1:10:21] recognize
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:27] says that's all right said but Billy
[1:10:29] that will not get you in the graveyard
[1:10:30] up
[1:10:32] here I said but it'll take me out
[1:10:35] brother I ain't worried about getting
[1:10:39] there I'm worried about getting out of
[1:10:41] there
[1:10:45] amen it's the main thing I'll get there
[1:10:51] somehow because of this Blessed
[1:10:53] assurance Jesus made the
[1:10:55] promise I believe it with all of my
[1:10:58] heart so are we worried about getting
[1:11:01] out of
[1:11:02] them we're all going to get there one
[1:11:04] way or
[1:11:05] another but we
[1:11:08] determine which way are we going to
[1:11:14] leave I'm going to try to explain how
[1:11:15] you get to be a
[1:11:17] beneficiary of a great
[1:11:20] policy which our Lord Jesus Christ has
[1:11:22] left for us
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:25] we go to Hebrews
[1:11:36] 9:27 and as is disappointed unto men
[1:11:39] once to die but after this the
[1:11:48] Judgment it says that they die once and
[1:11:50] in judgment not that they're going to
[1:11:51] reincarnate into a bowl or a cow
[1:11:59] so Christ was once offered to Bear the
[1:12:01] sins of
[1:12:05] many so we want to stop there where it
[1:12:07] says the sins of
[1:12:10] many he was talking about a special
[1:12:13] group of people do you want to include
[1:12:15] yourself there I can include myself
[1:12:18] there Phoenix lith Phoenix Lighthouse is
[1:12:20] there the Rey's family put your last
[1:12:24] name esar
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:31] family and unto them that look for him
[1:12:33] shall he appear the second time without
[1:12:35] sin unto
[1:12:39] salvation and now we go to Romans
[1:12:44] 81 the odd thing is we go from the Bible
[1:12:46] from one place to another and all it all
[1:12:49] it all aligns
[1:12:52] perfectly and the Bible is written by
[1:12:54] many years
[1:12:56] apart it's not one that sat down and
[1:12:59] wrote it was many years of difference
[1:13:02] and it all aligns perfectly Romans
[1:13:12] 81 there is therefore no now no
[1:13:15] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:13:21] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:13:24] after the
[1:13:27] spirit the messenger says that
[1:13:29] condemnation means
[1:13:33] judgment and the other scripture says
[1:13:35] that we die once and then we go to
[1:13:36] judgment are you following
[1:13:38] along let's go to Romans
[1:13:46] 82 for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:13:49] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[1:13:51] law of sin and death
[1:13:56] here in Romans 82 we see that there are
[1:13:57] two
[1:14:00] laws it says the spirit of the
[1:14:04] law is the law of spirit of life in
[1:14:06] Jesus Christ had made me free from the
[1:14:08] law of sin and
[1:14:11] death not that it's going to liberate me
[1:14:13] it has already liberated
[1:14:15] me Romans
[1:14:22] 6:23
[1:14:26] Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is
[1:14:29] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:14:31] life through Jesus Christ Our
[1:14:33] Lord we see that there are wages for
[1:14:37] sin and the wages is
[1:14:40] death and it's applied to all human
[1:14:42] beings
[1:14:46] death but here is one law that comes to
[1:14:48] the Lord Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ that liberates us from the other
[1:14:52] law which is
[1:15:00] death says there's many people who are
[1:15:02] defeated and they Place themselves in
[1:15:03] the other law of
[1:15:06] death truly we were delivered from that
[1:15:11] death we are more than conquerors in
[1:15:14] Christ
[1:15:16] Jesus that law of death and
[1:15:19] sin it makes us depart from that departs
[1:15:22] away from us
[1:15:24] to understand a bit
[1:15:27] more we're going to go to Romans
[1:15:37] 66 knowing this that our old man is
[1:15:39] crucified with
[1:15:42] him so that the body of sin might be
[1:15:47] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[1:15:49] serve
[1:15:51] sin do you notice something something in
[1:15:56] six that our old man is crucified with
[1:16:00] him we go to
[1:16:06] seven for he that is dead is freed from
[1:16:11] sin and eight now if we be dead with
[1:16:15] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:16:18] live with him
[1:16:21] amen knowing that our old man was
[1:16:23] crucified with Christ we died with
[1:16:26] Christ condemned with
[1:16:30] Christ we were judged with
[1:16:34] Christ we're more than conquerors in
[1:16:36] Christ
[1:16:41] Jesus it says now we be dead with Christ
[1:16:44] We believe We Shall also live with him
[1:16:50] Amen brother says does that give me the
[1:16:52] right to do whatever I want no
[1:16:57] sir that shows that you're rejecting
[1:16:59] that perfect
[1:17:00] sacrifice we go to Romans
[1:17:14] 9 knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:17:17] the dead dieth no more death had no more
[1:17:19] dominion over him
[1:17:22] so
[1:17:23] now if our lord
[1:17:25] Jesus he was resurrected from among the
[1:17:28] dead he no longer
[1:17:31] died likewise we die with him we
[1:17:34] resurrect with
[1:17:35] him we continue speaking
[1:17:44] on for that he died he died into sin
[1:17:47] once but that he liveth he liveth unto
[1:17:50] God he died one time
[1:17:53] one
[1:17:55] sacrifice one perfect sacrifice for all
[1:17:58] of
[1:18:00] us we include all of ourselves in
[1:18:04] that he died to the sin
[1:18:07] once for all for all and
[1:18:12] forever when many may
[1:18:15] say there's a PE there's a special
[1:18:18] people I believe with all of my
[1:18:20] heart that he is speaking to
[1:18:24] to all of us
[1:18:26] here what is the requirement my
[1:18:29] brother for the beneficiary of that
[1:18:31] great
[1:18:34] policy he says not going according to
[1:18:36] the
[1:18:38] flesh it's one of the parts where we
[1:18:40] struggle the most Romans 81 once
[1:18:44] again now there for now no
[1:18:47] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:18:51] Jesus who walk not after the
[1:18:55] flesh but after the
[1:18:58] spirit that is the requirement that I
[1:19:00] find
[1:19:02] here it's the only requirement not going
[1:19:04] after the
[1:19:06] flesh it's one of the things that we
[1:19:08] struggle with the
[1:19:10] most that's why the Apostle Paul would
[1:19:12] say that I Die
[1:19:16] daily this flesh sometimes wants to get
[1:19:18] out of control it doesn't not it doesn't
[1:19:20] want to
[1:19:21] surrender so then we
[1:19:25] say sometimes we leave
[1:19:28] Jesus and we say why can't Jesus
[1:19:30] overcome within
[1:19:33] us brother Garcia says because we have
[1:19:35] left
[1:19:37] him we cannot overcome if we've left
[1:19:39] Jesus
[1:19:41] behind I'm going to read one more
[1:19:44] scripture it's going to be Jeremiah
[1:19:49] 156 thou Hast forsaken me sayth the Lord
[1:19:54] thou are gone
[1:19:59] backward therefore will I stretch out my
[1:20:01] hand against thee and Destroy Thee I am
[1:20:03] weary with
[1:20:06] repenting when brother Garcia says when
[1:20:08] have we left
[1:20:10] Jesus when we yelled our
[1:20:13] parents when you're disrespectful to
[1:20:15] your
[1:20:16] wife when you're disrespectful towards
[1:20:18] your pastor when you speak ill of
[1:20:20] someone
[1:20:21] else when you're disrespectful to your
[1:20:25] brother when you yell at your wife or
[1:20:27] your
[1:20:29] husband he says those and those little
[1:20:31] things we have left Jesus it's not the
[1:20:34] great
[1:20:35] things amen
[1:20:38] Brothers when you're
[1:20:40] disrespectful you know how you spoke to
[1:20:43] them the husband the wife knows how she
[1:20:45] spoke to the
[1:20:50] husband when there's something that
[1:20:52] tells you in your heart that you were
[1:20:57] wrong that's the uh the warning that God
[1:21:00] has given
[1:21:01] us it's not the great things it's the
[1:21:05] small
[1:21:07] things and if we could just wake
[1:21:09] up and we go
[1:21:12] back where we have left
[1:21:15] him there he is waiting for
[1:21:19] us and we have to make amends quickly
[1:21:23] so he can come inside of
[1:21:25] us can be Christ Jesus overcoming within
[1:21:29] us now we have
[1:21:31] F we have mended things that we made and
[1:21:35] we continue moving
[1:21:37] forward and it's Jesus overcoming within
[1:21:39] us amen
[1:21:44] Brothers this what makes us creators of
[1:21:46] this great
[1:21:48] policy and not only uh deliberates us
[1:21:50] from judgment or death
[1:21:55] when the Lord took everything to the
[1:21:58] Cross he took illnesses as well he took
[1:22:01] pain he took shame he took
[1:22:05] um he took slavery he took the vi
[1:22:08] addictions problems and anguish he took
[1:22:13] everything but what do we have to
[1:22:15] do not walk according to the
[1:22:19] flesh that's the requirement he
[1:22:21] asked
[1:22:23] to walk after the
[1:22:24] spirit May the musicians can please come
[1:22:30] forth you have forsaken me says the
[1:22:37] Lord and we know where we have left them
[1:22:44] behind as we are we'll be
[1:22:47] praying oh our lord
[1:22:49] Jesus Heavenly Father
[1:22:53] how good you are with
[1:22:58] us knowing that there was no hope for
[1:23:02] us yet you there for us
[1:23:05] father and sometimes in the small
[1:23:08] things that go over our
[1:23:11] heads and that's where we have left you
[1:23:14] father help us continue moving
[1:23:17] forward help us surrender more to
[1:23:21] thee Lord because you know all of the
[1:23:23] hearts father you know what we're
[1:23:26] struggling
[1:23:28] with we have to surrender ourselves more
[1:23:30] to
[1:23:31] thee if one of my brothers here this
[1:23:34] evening he knows what he's struggling
[1:23:37] with may he
[1:23:40] recognize that you already died once and
[1:23:42] for
[1:23:43] all and that makes us
[1:23:47] creators those great benefits of that
[1:23:49] great
[1:23:50] policy it's as if we really
[1:23:56] realized that there in the state of
[1:23:58] Arizona there are rich people who
[1:24:00] are and you are more than
[1:24:03] that if only we could
[1:24:06] realize uh help us surrender to continue
