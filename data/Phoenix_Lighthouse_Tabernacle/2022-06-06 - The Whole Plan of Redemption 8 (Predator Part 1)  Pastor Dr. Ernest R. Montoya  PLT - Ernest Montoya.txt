individuals this message that i'm going to speak it's going to be a little hard but i received it from a seven-year-old a young lady seven years old seven year old little girls don't know too much we think they don't know too much but here i was drinking uh mineral water outside my granddaughter comes to me she's gonna be seven she's six years old going on seven so then i'm outside i had my shoes off my socks on or my socks were on i had i was uh perched my legs were stretched i mean she said there are a lot of predators all around us and they're looking for a parade to eat here's a second grader and she corrects me all the time i'm going to be a third grader your name is zoe i believe god talks to her i believe god talks to her it's like all little kids god will talk to those that humble themselves in other words those that are submissive to god's word [Applause] and she's talking to me and telling me uh that i pray is a weak animal so then the snakes the coyotes the rabbits they all go after the weaklings again um her allergies and i said what's going on and she goes remember i'm going to get operated tomorrow and i need prayer again this is a babe that all the angels would surround her in the evening but the angels would be in that operation that the holy spirit would guide the doctor well i'm not sure alejandra if you heard she woke up and she tells your mother god told me that we need to go back to church iglesia and the operation i forgot when it was a month ago two months ago so this message has been in and out yesterday on my computer so i decided i was going to give it a title the whole plan of redemption the hidden predator is we're so careless nowadays we relax we relax so much that we open the door we invite the predator in our homes without even noticing it we're going to pray we're going to read the bible and i want to get into this this topic i probably wouldn't yeah but i will finish it i'm going to dedicate it to all those individuals that have been exploited [Applause] those that are close to us those that are in this church this message is dedicated to you that have been cancer molested more spiritually by our adversary let's pray heavenly father we're grateful this morning we thank you for your blessings we thank you for what you're doing in our life the life of our family so we give the thanks this morning we have nothing to give thee so we give you our heart our soul this morning whatever pleases you or we pray in your precious name in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen on hebrews 9 11. through 14 it reads as follows but christ being come in high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building is neither by the blood of goats or calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us young for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god again i love the lord i respect you yes [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that's [Applause] we are who's possessing me this morning that's the holy spirit because i forfeited my rights does the holy spirit control me or am i possessed by an evil spirit spirit say it man some are possessed how many of you have been possessed before i was a christian possessed established the worst stage a person can be at el piores because of your thoughts because of our adversary how many have forfeited your rights directions nobody not in your hand if we forfeited our rights fitted by rights to the lord jesus here's danny travels with me a lot because he forfeited his rights danny the question the next thing montoya is going to tell you is jump and danny's going to respond to montoya why should i jump he's not going to say that he's going to tell me how high do you want me to jump it's no longer danny was dying that's what's inside the obedience inside of danny that's me that's what we don't understand somebody algin has rule over us they rule our life are we forfeit everything come here how many of us believe brother branham i will in hebrew anybody how many of you want to be protected i need protection because everywhere i go i don't think that there's always how many of us have been exploited by others nobody there i am okay every day there's a little monkey here and he tells me he's trying to kill you spiritually he's trying to kill you physically and he does a good job that's why this body gets sick i'll get to that in a little while that adversary is adversarial will make you think something that you're not let me say it over again our adversary is so good at what he does with her mind takes advantage of us that you're not or tries to make you something but god [Applause] how many of us want to be reflectors of the lord jesus christ i think we all want to be a reflection we all want him to say son [Applause] if you're a reflector you're gonna reflect the image that was in christ you're gonna do the very same things that christ did you say amen a reflector i look in the mirror i see the lord jesus christ when we look in the mirror [Applause] this is how do we resist evil we need to resist evil sin is that's why everybody partakes in sin because it's beautiful who was beautiful in the garden of eden the male or the female and brother important how many of you have been traumatized all right look man goes up i can't lie to god no no you don't put your hand up and you're calling god a liar because everyone that's sitting has been traumatized you had an injury you were traumatized yes or no you've had a nightmare you're being traumatized even in your sleep this is something we all know that we just forget it's a mode of life in which food food yes water whatever it is clothing is obtained by killing in order for you to survive but sometimes you have to live here that food is killing something so that i can in order [Applause] family stories that we hear have you heard that one raise your hand if you did no no i'm saying seriously raise your hand or fetch well i don't a person or animal that that hunts or a smaller weaker person or animal persona i'm sorry i forget maybe it's old age i don't know always wondered i used to talk to a lot to brother paul i'd ask brother paul when i hit this number on the stage how am i gonna feel am i gonna be able to walk am i going to be forgetful and he looks at me and he laughs the question i have for you who's more fragile the male or the female el baron hola brother mentioned it take care of your wife because she is so fragile she's the fragile weaker vessel yes a snake will go after rats a rat will go after smaller objects [Applause] goes after squirrels but it's always somebody weaker than they are are we weak weak somos dabulis are you and i weak somos i am weak but that word here's a song keep me jesus from all harm we're [Music] i don't care how religious you are the devil is always present i don't care if we're having a jubilee devil is waiting for you outside i'll test your faith what does the bible say about wolves who plays with our minds jesus christ that's why i'm saying what i'm saying because in this time we're in the end time somebody has to be deceived somebody's gonna fall predator one who injures or exploits others for personal gain here's the mechanic mechanical he charged me fifteen hundred dollars or get closer i won't bite you here comes javiera's buddy did the same work [Applause] and i say that because i i was uh said of ernie montoya the pastor didn't belong to a church no not being a christian i want you to remember what a predator is i was in africa in a safari in africa we killed the warhog god shot him in the back all of a sudden we started tracking and what we found was this intestines all but you could tell but like a good tracker that some something or someone had passed through okay they left their mark they left their blood their mouth a device and records and records excuse me the movement movements of someone or something or registered have you ever been tracked if you have never been tracked what's on sir onstar okay you've worked on my car what is on star nost most cars is so when i say uh records the movement does an airplane have a tracker it's called a black box pandemic la pandemia
