TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the [Music] all [Music] [Applause] [Music] n [Music] the [Music] all [Applause] [Music] [Music] d [Music] [Music] the [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] [Applause] a [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] n [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] [Music] let's stand please read the scripture be reading Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 to 11 subject that we've taken is the Original Seed this will be the second sermon or message on that subject and we'll probably have to leave it because it's we won't have enough time to cover the whole subject EXP for [Music] in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day am and God said let there be a fir in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so and God called the fir me heaven and the evening and the morning with the second day and God said let the waters from under the heavens be gathered unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land Earth and the Gathering Together the waters he called seas and God saw that it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so now Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils a breath of life and Man became a living Soul let us pray to God once again Lord we place ourselves in your hands and we report for service we ask that you may still us quietness so that we may meditate and think on your word may we receive the teaching from your word we thank you for the message of the last hour and also the messenger that you sent that message had it not been for that message we would not be in confusion we thank you once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated subject we have taken is the original seed I'd like to make a comment before entering into the teaching Dr my Christian life I've heard comments from a very illustrious Man by God's grace I was able to read one of his articles last week when I started comparing it to the scriptures I was amazed at how far away from scriptural truth this man is this man is famous worldwide and has a radio program worldwide also and many of the Believers in the Pentecostal age and message have been swept under the teachings of this man and I've seen in reading his editorial that he does it really wisely but he's so far away from scripture we're not bragging now but we believe that brother bam was sent with the word for this hour and if brother BR did teach something that that the people are not accustomed to or used to we don't blame the people for at first rejecting what the prophet brought but if they would just but listen I believe that the Lord would open up their understanding of L people because everything that the prophet taught is scriptural we read in the scripture there in Genesis how each seed was to produce reproduce after its own kind how many of you believe that each God's word reproduces according to its own kind we've seen that the Original Seed is Jesus Christ is that right he is a logos we see how that when God said let the man come forth man came forth and that man was a spiritual man then we have the scripture in Genesis 2:7 now this is another man how many of you can say Amen to this see here that God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so this takes us now to the beginning of the teaching this morning help me out so we can progress being aware that we can't cover I can't cover a lot of ground I have drawn here three circles first circle is the body the body of every human being this body is of what it's a body of Flesh our flesh body each and every one of us I have a question where was that body of Flesh formed whose womb in the mother's womb is that right the body was formed in the mother's womb the second Circle we have is the [Music] spirit where was the spirit where was that Spirit formed outside what body in the world outside the mother in in the world is that right you're not too sure brother says when the M mother is about to give birth a spirit is surrounding that mother brother bam calls it an angel a spirit brother says when mother drops or the baby drops delivers a baby says that the body comes out of the mother's womb and that there's no Spirit to receive that body then that body is still born is that right is that right if you don't understand it so I can repeat it that person being inside the womb does not have a spirit yet spirit is outside it's in the world waiting for that baby when that enters into the baby then that baby becomes a living Soul when it becomes a living soul the soul and the spirit are just like that together there's no one that can separate the soul from the spirit the only thing that can separate the spirit in the soul is God's word and the Word was brought that's the only thing that can separate one from the other and the spirit and the soul I wrote here as a heart they're both in the heart how many of you believe that if you're sure say amen and if I ask later ask you a question and you answer wrong it's because you weren't sure brother says says that the soul is the nature of the spirit they're not separated they're together two different things one is the other one is the soul so the soul is the nature of the spirit the prophet says says your brain is not your intelligence it's your spirit that's in you is your intelligence brother benam said says the mind is the womb of the spirit so the mind is not the intelligence how many of you believe this says notice how simple the mind is the womb of the spirit but the mind is not the intelligence so what the serpent was looking for when he made contact with Eve and what he was seeking was the spirit This Woman's spirit because he was seeking intelligence and when a person starts to converse with another seeking out his intelligence according to person's intelligence is how you going coexist with them even that's why even in marriages many couples cannot coexist there's not an equality intellectually speaking except they both surrender to the word then there's no problems but there has to be a coexistence and according to the intelligence of that person is how you can coexist with them so the serpent was seeking the womb the mind that's the only way he could get to her spirit the spirit is the life to be able to enter and place in her not in her soul but rather in her flesh to bring about our reproduction of the human being but first of all he had to insert himself inject himself into the human race not just in the body but in the deepest heart of that human being once again review the body of a human beings is formed where for all of you that know to answer at one time if you understand this I need for you to answer where was your body formed where was the spirit Spirit was outside the body so here's the key for you to be able to understand why you need have to be born again how many of you believe that you've been born again say [Music] Amen this birth this new birth where is that taken where does that take place where it's in the heart of the human being so then there is a spiritual birth is that right how you believe that you've had a new birthday amen where did this new birth take place in the heart in the human's heart if it be so if you were born again you're a spiritual Spirit man how many of you believe your person a new creature say if you believe that so here this this returns you back to Genesis 1 The Original Seed this takes you back to Genesis 1 but when you get down to Genesis 27 we still have not been return to the to that yet because this body will prove it later came by sex this body was formed in a mother's womb and that conception came through a sexual act it is not Original Seed it's a byproduct it's a secondary type of act not God's perfect will but God has made his new creatures in the inside but as long as we're living here on this Earth until the Resurrection comes we're burying in us two men if we could say so you can get it right away but we're trying to say if we're born again we're a grain of wheat how many of you believe grain of wheat the only problem is that there a grain of wheat inside a cocko [Music] bir is sticky and that needs water up until the Resurrection comes you can be a new creature in Christ Jesus but if you're not getting water you get real sticky real sticky thorny and you get you stick we'll be entering into the teaching that I have for this morning now how many of you believe that God's word is the Original Seed this subject that I've taken the Original Seed the prophet says that the Original Seed is Jesus Christ in order to understand this we have to give a little bit of a review he says this is the original seed it's God's word it's a logus in other words the word said that and then and God said when he said something what he said was is the Original Seed but then that seed created other seeds spoken the original seed that Original Seed brought forth millions of seeds so those seeds become part of him even we are a seed of God we're God's word we're part of God we're original because we're part of him he is the original if you understand me up to now say Amen if I don't have enough time to get to where I wanted to get to I want to give you or say to you what has amazed me I am a new creature I believe you are are also I believe that I am that Spirit man and I'm speaking about the Inside [Music] Man that Spirit man that the Bible says that God created in His image and likeness I believe that when he chose me he knew what would be coming forth he knew that the fall would come about he knew that every man would be brought forth in sin he knew that that body of Flesh would not be changed until the resurrection he knew that the spirit man brother Bernie Garcia would live inside that cockle bir and he had enough trust in me that even so he chose me because I have noticed that see there's evil in me I have come to the conclusion that the wrong the evil is in me I have come to a conclusion that this body that I have is sin I that I was sold into sin and that that first man forfeited me and handed me over into slavery I've come to the conclusion that God chose me and he has me in this body ofh in a that desires those things of the world but yet he had enough trust in me that this Inside Man was going to bring cocko bir body into subjection and that's what makes me cry he had enough trust in me this 20th century that we're now living in you can't hardly trust anybody before the prophet said that beforehand you could shake make a contract with a man agreement and shake hands with him and that man was manad enough to keep his word in that contract now you even have a a contract notorized by not Republic and even that way they still don't keep it that's the age that we but in this age God placed a group of seed group of wheat inside birs and they trusted them trusted them that they will be the manifestation of the sons of God and that all creation be restored back to its original condition this is the age of restoration through the original SE when I see it like that I said oh you're tremendous you're so great I don't even trust myself but and I've always said that I don't even trust myself yeah you trust me me to break down and cry when we come to the awareness of that what will happen to us what what happened to that man brother Bram says was a couple that got married the woman she was a really a strong Christian an oldfashioned Christian and the young man was a young a new believer and when they got married the young lady said to her husband I want you to know something if you ever backslide I want you to know that I'll be here at home waiting for you I I love you and I'll receive you I'll take you back don't go anywhere else you come back home I'll be here waiting for you the young man told his fellow workers this is what my wife told me how could I ever do anything wrong when she trusts me so much I believe that when we can understand this how will we ever break or violate that trust see he trusts me he trusts you that when this inside man comes out this Inside Man is that body the outside man he trusts us you can live in that body of sin but you're going to be manifested my image will be reflected through your life I trust you that you're going to do the right thing you're going to follow my word this is beautiful let's look now Romans 612 if you're understanding a little bit up to now say man Romans 612 excuse me Romans 5:12 you see why I don't even trust myself wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned how did or how did Sin enter [Music] in where where did Sin enter into the Bible says see sin entered into the world this is the world where did the sin where did Sin enter in or to what into the world is that right what is sin unbelief and it has a life has a spirit has a spirit that's going to end but yet it has a life so then the spirit entered into the world when you come out of your mother's womb what do you enter into to the world and what's waiting for you is a spirit and whose spirit is this it's Spirit of the world because it's in the world is that right it's the life this life was permitted it's God's permissive will it's that God permitted for humankind to populate the world you and I are part of them through a permissive will and when we come to this world we're all liars thieves Killers that's the nature that's in US each and every one of us sin entered into the world unbelief entered into the world and it you have to needs a body to live and it's waiting for the human being's body to be to live blessed be the name of but thanks be to God that sin entered by one man but also by one man is sin taken away let's read psalms 515 I trust that you're writing down the scriptures behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me how many of you believe that you have sinned brother bam on page 501 some people say well now here's a good little girl or boy they never sin to begin with but you're born and sin to begin with shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking Lies when you're born in this world you're a liar you're a thief you're everything everything that there is all sin you're not a liar a thief because you stole you're not a liar because you told a lie that spirit that s you when you were born because you're of the world that's the reason you why you can't have Reformation you've got to die and be born again you can't have a birth without crucifixion now I ask this question was Jesus Christ crucified no yes or no you're a little afraid now aren't you answer please yes or no was Jesus Christ crucified when he was crucified did he go smiling to the Cross how did he get to the Cross how was he able to get to the Cross he was God's love but if I understand the Bible he knelt down and he said father let this cup pass for me but not my will but thy will be done he said he started to sweat and his sweat was as great drops of blood it was not an easy thing to make that decision to go to calv because he was going to be crucified when we're speaking about the crucifixion this is the body that must be crucified in order for for for the death in order for the death of the nature of that spirit because what actually controls you it's what's inside you you have to die you have to be crucified and you're not going to want to be crucified because you want only if you hear the gospel you hear understand the plan of and when you do understand you then know that you have to be crucified many people want to be born again but they don't want to be crucified brother B says you need a a crucifixion in order to have a birth you cannot have a new birth except there be a crucifixion where in Christ in Christ so then what starts to form is an angel a messenger the B says that when we're born in the natural birth he says there is a spirit to enter into US say it's an angel and this Angel is going to speak is going going to do the things of the world because he's of the world yes sir but when you're born again the angel comes Jesus Christ inside of you and it starts to form it brings everything under subjection first of all there must be a crucifixion for that angel Jesus Christ to come inside of us Prophet says man when he's born he's got a spirit in him and it's the spirit of that he has in him is of the world it's the spirit of the god you forgive me that's why you can get a pig and you bathe him wash him up to put a little ribbon on that pig but he's going to go to the mud power as soon as he can because that his nature the nature that's in him we've gone down the wrong road we're trying to pick clean up the pig before changing his nature we have to teach men and women that the spirit that they have in them is of the world it's of the devil the spirit that man has that from the smallest baby the spirit that he has is of the devil but God's word says that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses him until the age of accountability he has to come to a repentance a first step barely that's barely the first step the Second Step along with that of course is to be baptized in water and then what to be before him and saying to him change change my nature change my spirit make me a new creature in Christ Jesus because until we have that change of nature we don't have God in us in US you might have him above us but not in US Prophet says when a man's born he's born with the spirit of the world in him that's the reason why he's got to be born again because this Spirit comes from a conception and he can't live AB no way he can live forever then he's got to be born again every man has to be born again no matter if he's a high priest he's a bishop he's a pope whatever he is he's just as guilty as the next man he has to be born again brother bam says they ask him a question say brother Bram I want all the young children to not this brother bam will all the Sons and Daughters of true Born Again CHR Believers be saved in other words if your parents are true Born Again Christians see that's what makes a man a new person it's because he's born again reborn his first B brings him a natural man of on Earth his second birth brings him a spiritual man of Heaven see it changes him changes his form not his outward conscience not his five outside senses but his inward part his what motivates him has been changed to God why don't you take your Bibles now so we can tie together what the prophet says be in first Corinthians chapter 15 Prophet says here that the soul is changed the problem says that it's the soul that's changed how many of you believe that it's the soul that's changed 1 Corinthians 15 verse 47 first man is of the earth earthy the second man man is the Lord From Heaven which is the second man now remember I told you earlier that the birth that was that was performed when it was birth that an angel came and it was the Lord now I want you to notice the first man is is from whom from where is from the Earth second man is from her from heaven from Heaven is the Lord is the Lord when Jesus Christ was born he was born in a manger he came forth from Mary's womb he was God's gift to us how many of you accept that Jesus Christ was God's gift to us have you ever given someone a present what must you do when you buy somebody a present you wrap it that's why they WRA Jesus right away in a swaddling clothing a very cloth that used to clean the sweat off animal that's what the prophet said said that we have a filthy stinking stable yet he wants to come to that table he wants to come to this table he went to that table way he was wrapped up in swalling clothing he wants to come to you but you have to die in order for him to come to you the Bible says as as is the Earthly such are they also that are Earthly and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly and as we we have born the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly we see then that the first man is of the Earth the second man is from heaven is the Lord when there is a new birth the prophet says like this what starts to form the Lord starts to form in you growing more and more and more more and more the Lord in you he is that angel that he is the messenger that what you speak what he wants you to speak who's the one that brings the messenger message means messenger when a person's been born again you know right away if he been born again because the one that's speaking in him is then the angel Jesus Christ the prophet says there's been a change the soul has to be changed the word parom means what to change from one form to another this will help you so you won't get confused Prophet says it changes him changes his soul it changes his nature changes his desires what what motivates him brother tells me please pray for me or or or teach such and such because he wants to dance he wants to smoke that's what that's what motivates don't worry about it about the smoking and the drinking worry about there can come a change in the heart then the spirit change something else will motivate that man the things of the Lord Prophet says that the word birth means uh New Creation so when you're born again a new creation has come about and youve been born of the new Original Seed not through sex anymore that's why we have two parts even though we have been born again this body that you see right here came through sex but this which is in here did not come through sex and sooner or later I'm of Flesh and I'm going to dress if it be so that I be not found naked I have dressed myself with the word that theop body is that word body if I'm rapping dring the word then there's a body waiting for Dro this robe of flesh but until that day come we're walking two ber two person I can see two two and then we get shook up sometime we don't know this sometimes brother J sticks us he gets a little sticky he said Theon that holy man it's not the inside man that's it's that outside man that's scking you and that won't go away until the resurrection when he stoens up a little it's when the water comes you want water the water comes upon Him above that blessed soul service oh I can see nothing but Angels but if no water comes to him no no water drop on him several days go by without no water it's a little sticky very well the prophet going continue on can you wait for a few more minutes I'm almost done Prophet my Lord I was noing that I had to go scures let's go second Corinthians chapter 5 to confirm what we're speaking right now so please brother when it's the outside man that does something don't blame the that's on the inside all right if we believe the word if it be so that he was born again I'm speaking about Born Again people I'm not speaking about those that had not yet been born again and yet they want to cover themselves with religion I'm speaking about those that have been born again second Corinthians 517 now if there be any man be any any man be in Christ When sin entered into what to the world world when you were born there was that what was is of the world was waiting for you what did you enter into what did you enter into into the world and that which is the and embrace goes kiss and say come here H you're mine is that right and for years we tried to reform and you can't reform anybody there has to be a crucifixion there has to be a killing you have to die in order to be born again and then when you're born again if any man be in Christ where in what in Christ ah in the heart now this is what Christ enters you what controls you being chist he is a new creature all old things are passed away behold all things are become new how many of you believe this say Amen how many of you believe you're real good isn't it true that some of us do believe that we're real good we make a profession confession of faith I accept Jesus Christ and you cross yourself I get baptized I never smoked I never drank I never [Applause] stole I never broke one commandment if you want to know it I'm just like that Young Rich Young that met Jesus I've kept all the Lord's commandments you forgive me that's how a lot of them are told me I never I never committ adultery now let's follow that thought for about 10 minutes Romans [Music] 1022 322 of [Music] Romans even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all that believe that believe for there is no difference no Pope even the Bishop even the pastor this is for whosoever for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God for all have we born in we have all sinned first john8 if we say if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US now turn with us to First John 3 39 and you'll see that it looks like it contradicts itself whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot s because he is born of God so which one's right then they're both right if I understand the word I was born of God and I do not sin I cannot sin what is sin unbelief God said something I say Amen because the seed his seed is in me which seed is in me what's the subject's title The Original Seed where is that in my mind in the heart is that right so then that seed was in me me since I was born it but there had to be a death person in order for that life that was in me to brush forth so then it was the original how can I then sin but it says here and if anyone say we have not sinned we make him a liar because there are people that they think they're real good and they don't come to Lord because they shall Never Smoke drank or committed adultery but to begin with you were born in as soon as you were born you were a bunch of sin if you say you have not you make him a liar say you were born in sin let's look want me to see if I can finish Prophet says given the interpretation what we've spoken he said what is sin unbelief there's only one sin and that's unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already and he quing Mark 16 go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not is condemned already so they don't believe that's a person's condemnation because if they do believe they know that they're born in sin they know that they have to be born again they know that they have to be died to the world they know that he knows that the spirit that he has in him is of the world he knows that the life that he has in him is of the world he knows that in the beginning it was a unbelief that brought to the world but he also know that God sent his original Jesus Christ to die to redeem us to give us an opportunity to be born again not through sex but through the word in order to have a new spirit and where is that new spirit going to be in the heart he says how is it that the Bible says he'll give us a new heart is he going to give take away this heart give us a up no the same heart but he changes trans and God see verse four changes the nature spirit new desire that's a new creature in Christ Jesus now the prophet says giving the interpretation to the scripture I just finished reading first John uh 38 and 10 that's Paul that's [Music] speaking in order for you to understand I I'll just explain it to you little now he's saying here that in me are two persons one that wants to do good and the other one wants to do evil whenever I try to do good there's evil they're hindering me isn't that tremendous now you're an outside man that's controlled by senses and there is an inside man is controlled that that he's controlled by faith now Jesus Christ said made a statement and when Jesus Christ make the statement the inside man says amen the outside man he starts to reason that's not right so then just ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man now I'm reading on page uh 1148 from conduct order and Doctrine now that's Paul himself that's speaking it says that he was sold into the law of slavery of the of the world of the flesh we're all been done the same way that's the reason why we all have have all kinds of sin adultery and all kinds of things in our life all of these things because we are carals that part must perish but then inside we are a spirit Soul inside that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith how can I take a cocko bir and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be done is because it's on the inside of the cockle bur in other words from that Cocker a wheat in other words a germ called the wheat of life then you bury that Cocker and it will produce a grain of wheat that's why Paul said I am crucified together with Jesus Christ you have to keep that cocko bird buried so that that life of God tweet because if it be that way see a grain of wheat has been placed inside that Cocker and the life and the life the spirit of that Cocker has been cast out when I was born I was born in sin on the outside and on the inside but one day I understood that I was a sinner Ood that I was born in sin I understood that I did not come the original way I understood that sin entered into the world because of Adam's unbelief when I understood that I surrendered myself to him and I died when I died then there was a new birth and what is it then it's a bird walking through the Earth but it's not the life of a it's the life of a wheat living inside let me go and let me finish it now how can I take a cocko b and make a grain of wheed out of it it's impossible for me to do it see there's a life inside that cocko in in order for me to convert it to change it I have to take the life of the co away when we born we have the spirit of the world how can I change the life in me is not the world I take that life out the world put a new life put Jesus Christ inside of me is him living see you see a CO outside you see a man who can get sick I can get if you put a a germ called qu of life then you bury that coo bir some day they might kill me and they'll bury a CO but when they that Co has G out my mind is not my not Taco is not going to come out of it it's going to be a great of God with an Incorruptible body Immortal body etal life because I permitted God to have preeminence in my you bury that Co and what will you have you have a wheat because the life of a cocko bir has been taken out but while you're living here on Earth the nature of the COO is still sticky and it will be this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raise up again when it come forth It's not no more no more Cocker whe but while it here on Earth the thing out of the earth and a COO is still sticky but is still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside and it's a you understand say Amen let's PR because I understand that you you cannot give it all but you can understand and pray to God that he give it the Revelation oh Father father I can understand a little bit more of who we are Lord we thank you Lord where would I be where would these people be without the message of the hour oh God man has tried to
