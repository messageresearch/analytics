[36:57] as well
[36:58] you help me find the correct words
[37:02] so I can express
[37:06] [Music]
[37:10] the person in the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:13] amen amen
[37:15] God bless you Brothers uh you'd be so
[37:18] kind of please turn your Bibles to
[37:20] Revelations 3 21.
[37:27] we're going to be continuing with the
[37:29] topic of how can I overcome
[37:33] and as you find the scripture I just
[37:35] like to take some time to thank our
[37:36] pastor
[37:38] um
[37:42] for the confidence he puts in without
[37:44] let me be here once again
[37:48] we can indicate it with an amen once you
[37:50] have it
[37:51] foreign
[37:56] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[37:59] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[38:02] overcame and am sat down with my father
[38:03] in his throne is
[38:16] so once again it's to him that overcome
[38:19] it
[38:20] no will grant to stay with me in my
[38:23] Throne
[38:25] you know here brother Bannon tells us
[38:28] he's letting us know that there is a
[38:30] reward for the Overcomers
[38:38] sorry it's on my Throne not in my throne
[38:43] and so since we're still so we're on the
[38:46] topic of how can I overcome
[38:48] no we always go through what it means to
[38:51] overcome
[38:54] um
[38:56] and last time we spoke on how Jesus
[39:01] how he is the perfect example
[39:04] of an overcomer
[39:06] told us
[39:08] that overcome means
[39:11] it means to stand the test
[39:14] he says just like Jesus did foreign
[40:13] he says he's just as real as you or
[40:16] anybody
[40:18] this is a real devil
[40:22] and you must recognize him real estate
[40:27] he says You must know he's a devil says
[40:31] but at the same time
[40:34] that you recognize him
[40:36] and you know that he's a devil and he's
[40:38] against you
[40:42] then to overcome
[40:44] you must recognize that
[40:47] the god in you okay
[40:50] is greater and my dear is
[40:56] he says that he says that one that's in
[40:59] your that the one that's in you has
[41:01] already overcome him
[41:04] and he says and by his grace
[41:07] he says you're more than a match for him
[41:09] yes
[41:10] and so right there I find that
[41:13] interesting
[41:14] he says he doesn't say you're a match
[41:16] for him
[41:18] you're more than a man
[41:20] somebody is a match for you
[41:24] that means you're on the same level
[41:28] but he's saying that you're more than
[41:30] imagination
[41:32] so you're more than him and that's why
[41:36] we can overcome
[41:37] you know in finishing off that quote
[41:40] no he gives us a key here
[41:44] he says that's real overcoming when you
[41:47] recognize
[41:51] so from reading that quote we are the
[41:54] latest you know I I learned that there's
[41:56] things I have to recognize
[41:59] so I have to recognize that there's a
[42:01] real devil
[42:03] real I have to recognize that he's
[42:05] against me
[42:07] he's against you he's against us but
[42:12] nothing I have to do
[42:14] I have to also have to recognize myself
[42:18] you have to recognize you know what who
[42:20] you are
[42:22] and where you stand
[42:24] and then that leads me to recognize
[42:30] me or The God in you
[42:33] is greater and mightier than he is
[42:37] so we have to recognize
[42:41] that's the word of Promise
[42:44] he says and it says the next one would
[42:47] be it says What's the Word of Promise to
[42:49] every Christian
[42:52] and he says it says greater is he that's
[42:55] in you than he that's in the world he
[42:57] said mayor is
[43:04] how do I overcome
[43:08] he says not me
[43:11] he said but the word that's in me
[43:15] so we can place ourselves there you know
[43:18] it's not me it's not you all right it's
[43:22] not us but it's the word that's in us
[43:26] and he says the word is God
[43:29] he says then I overcome
[43:32] once again then we overcome
[43:37] he says not the things of the uh he says
[43:39] we overcome the things of the world
[43:42] it's the word in me
[43:44] and then he says he says if ye abide in
[43:48] me
[43:49] and me just my words in you miss
[43:53] palabrasotros he says then just ask what
[43:55] you will
[43:56] just keep pressing up
[43:59] says you're coming to the top
[44:02] he says as sure as anything
[44:05] says you've got to come to the top
[44:09] and so then here once again we go back
[44:12] to how can I overcome
[44:14] so how did Jesus overcome
[44:17] no he showed us how
[44:19] he said an example for us you know he
[44:23] overcame by the word and by humility
[44:29] and so here I have a quote 103.
[44:34] it says we're talking about humility
[44:37] I was trying to find something that
[44:39] talks more about you know the humbleness
[44:41] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:43] and so I found in the message uh called
[44:46] humble myself in
[44:48] it reads like the following yes brother
[44:52] Brandon says look at Jesus nothing but
[44:54] one bundle of love
[44:57] Jesus
[45:01] he says he was God manifested
[45:07] expressed himself through him
[45:10] and he says no wonder Miracles and
[45:13] things happened
[45:16] he says his humble life and consecrated
[45:19] life he said
[45:22] to come from being God we need the
[45:25] serdios to be a man on Earth
[45:28] he says to express God through himself
[45:34] I like what brother Brennan says here
[45:37] that's what made him what he was
[45:41] he says I've always said
[45:44] just what made Jesus God to me
[45:49] was the way he humbled himself
[45:53] he says he was so great
[45:56] yeah he could make yeah he could be so
[45:59] small
[46:02] see that's right
[46:04] so then I understand you know in order
[46:08] for me to be humble yes it's good to
[46:11] recognize where you come from
[46:13] and maybe you're somebody who's great
[46:16] but at the same time we make ourselves
[46:19] smaller
[46:20] because we're being humble because we're
[46:24] the son of a king
[46:25] but God doesn't like us going around
[46:27] boasting
[46:29] so we have to be humble
[46:31] and if we want to overcome
[46:42] so you know and he says Jesus gave us
[46:44] the example how to do it Jesus
[46:47] he says now we want to know how to
[46:49] overcome
[46:52] Jesus told us how to do it Jesus
[46:56] said humility girded himself to a towel
[47:00] and watched the disciples feet and wiped
[47:02] them
[47:03] um
[47:08] so he uses the word girded
[47:12] you know and that means you know to
[47:14] equip or to prepare is
[47:20] and he says he took him tell and he
[47:23] watched disciples fee and wiped them
[47:27] he says the very God Of Heaven
[47:29] humiliated himself
[47:32] and then here he's talking about people
[47:34] he's met along his life brother Branham
[47:36] he said
[47:39] he says I've had the privilege of
[47:42] getting meeting some great
[47:45] and it's these guys that got a change of
[47:48] clothes and 50 cents in their pocket to
[47:50] Rattle yes individuals
[47:56] he said that's the guy that thinks he's
[47:57] something when he's nothing
[48:04] he says but I stood by Great Men
[48:08] He says I mean great men
[48:12] with ragged sleeves
[48:17] he says he says they make you think
[48:21] you're the great
[48:24] Persona and so here it teaches me once
[48:26] again how can I be humble
[48:29] you know it's you make somebody else
[48:32] feel like they're the great one
[48:34] person
[48:35] by yourself
[48:37] you make the other person feel like
[48:39] they're the great one person
[48:42] gives us another key yeah
[48:46] he says greatness
[48:49] is humility so if I want to be great
[49:02] [Music]
[49:04] he says greatness is expressed in
[49:07] humility
[49:09] he says now how fine you can be
[49:14] so it's not how fine I can be
[49:17] it's the greatest expressed in humility
[49:22] and so when he says
[49:24] what you might say okay well then maybe
[49:27] I then why do I dress so nice
[49:30] or why do I put so much effort into
[49:32] looking nice
[49:37] to be humble this is doesn't mean you
[49:40] have to dress ragged
[49:43] or to be dirty or not be close
[49:47] but what it means is having been humble
[49:51] in spirit
[49:52] so it's it's not you know the way you
[49:55] look
[49:56] but it's the humbleness in your spirit
[49:59] and how did Jesus Express humility
[50:04] you know he was willing to die
[50:07] you know he forfeited all the world and
[50:10] all the things
[50:12] and Jesus was Jesus conquered all
[50:15] Temptations
[50:17] and then you ask you know why why was he
[50:20] tempted
[50:21] you know and in this this morning you
[50:24] know our brother did he did a great job
[50:27] and he told us you know why we're tried
[50:30] no we have to build that character
[50:34] you know he said we want to buy gold
[50:38] but we receive it through those trials
[50:41] so why was Jesus was tempted what was he
[50:44] tempted it was to mold his character
[50:48] and then brother Benham says you know
[50:51] the Temptation was for him
[50:53] IL that would be 104 and he says you
[50:55] know that the Bible says that he was
[50:57] tempted in all points like you and I are
[51:03] and that's we you know oh that's it says
[51:07] tempted in all points
[51:09] it doesn't say in some points
[51:11] he says he was tempted in all points but
[51:15] yet without sin pero so he was tempted
[51:19] in everything you know you might sit
[51:21] there and think well I struggle with
[51:24] this problem
[51:26] another problem
[51:28] maybe I don't think Jesus was tempted by
[51:31] this stuff I'm tempted by it
[51:36] says
[51:38] he was tempted by drinking
[51:41] was tempted by women
[51:44] he says he was tempted by everything
[51:46] that could be tempted by it
[51:49] so anything you think about
[51:52] he was
[52:50] you know
[52:53] 140. no brother Brown tells us you know
[52:57] he come and suffered and he took the
[53:00] hard rugged route
[53:02] he took the route of persecution
[53:07] and he took the route of death
[53:10] no and then asks a question
[53:13] you know I can ask it to you this
[53:15] evening
[53:17] are we this morning
[53:23] and I can say are we this evening
[53:26] he says willing to do
[53:29] just take that same route that he taken
[53:32] is
[53:34] are we willing to die
[53:36] and then here's another key
[53:40] are we willing
[53:42] to give ourselves up to God
[53:46] forfeit all the world and other things
[53:49] to serve him
[53:51] see when and when I read that that's
[53:55] what I think it means to be humble is
[53:59] I think that's humility yes um for
[54:02] example my brother here you know he
[54:04] could do whatever he wants
[54:06] those were free moral agents
[54:10] but yet what does he choose to do
[54:13] he serves God and that's humility yes um
[54:17] but the question is why did he endure it
[54:20] all
[54:21] he got through it all and but why did he
[54:23] endure it
[54:25] and here brother is talking about when
[54:28] you know the devil was tempting Jesus
[54:32] you know he offered them the kingdoms of
[54:34] the world
[54:36] and here 141 brother Brandon says he
[54:40] says now he failed to do it we
[54:44] to Forfeit Satan was to him
[54:55] he says though Jesus was tempted
[54:58] and even here's the real beauty of it he
[55:01] says he overcome for us
[55:04] he says he endured all temptation for me
[55:07] and for you
[55:10] he says he could have took it right then
[55:14] he says but what did he take the other
[55:16] route for pero
[55:26] and he says and if he paid such a price
[55:31] then how little would it be not to take
[55:33] it Don says
[55:36] he says one remember there's nothing
[55:38] here anyhow request
[55:42] and so when I read that
[55:45] and I say that's that's genuine love is
[55:49] being able to endure such harsh
[55:52] conditions
[55:54] no not thinking of yourself
[55:57] thinking of someone else
[55:59] you know that's love ESO you know and I
[56:03] think of the love of a parent
[56:05] you know how they're willing to suffer
[56:08] so free they're willing to uh you know
[56:11] overcome
[56:13] not for themselves because they're
[56:16] thinking of their children or maybe
[56:18] somebody out there who's thinking of
[56:19] their loved ones uh
[56:23] you know you do it for them because
[56:26] that's what love is and that's what we
[56:29] gotta do yeah sometimes we have to put
[56:31] ourselves last question
[56:36] that's first it's God
[56:38] then it's your family and then next it's
[56:42] you
[56:43] and here you know I have a quote I'm
[56:45] going to extract okay you know when he
[56:46] says you have to remember you're living
[56:48] for God
[56:50] he says that we have one objective and
[56:54] he says and that's Jesus Christ
[56:56] and he says outside of that there's
[56:58] nothing
[57:00] yeah he says nothing else counts he said
[57:04] that's him
[57:05] just then secondly
[57:08] says it's for your family he says then
[57:11] thirdly
[57:12] it's yourself
[57:14] but first for God
[57:17] next for your family and next for you he
[57:21] says you're number three foreign
[58:22] I think maybe of us who have been raised
[58:24] you know by our parents
[58:26] you know we were corrected we must
[58:30] corregidos you know I know I was
[58:32] corrected
[58:33] in more ways than one and muchas you
[58:37] know I know we have Mother's Day coming
[58:38] up
[58:41] no we have Mother's Day coming up
[58:44] so I'll just get this out the way now
[58:47] no but growing up you know I was
[58:50] corrected
[58:51] you know and when you're little you know
[58:55] you think it's your parents just being
[58:56] mean to you
[58:59] or maybe they don't like you that's why
[59:01] they're correcting you okay
[59:02] but you realize when you grow up
[59:06] you realize it's because they love you
[59:08] that they correct you
[59:10] and that's why God we need correcting
[59:15] because God loves us
[59:21] that a real mother
[59:32] and you know we we receive all these
[59:35] trials
[59:37] but we have to overcome them
[59:40] but like they mentioned this morning
[59:44] you know we should be happy in the
[59:46] trials
[59:47] I've always liked when they mentioned
[59:49] that
[59:50] when they say why is the devil after you
[59:53] it's because he doesn't have you so
[59:57] while you have trials
[1:00:02] because you know in your battle
[1:00:05] but if you're not having anything in
[1:00:07] your life
[1:00:08] and that should be a cause for concern
[1:00:10] you know that's what they say about when
[1:00:12] you have little kids
[1:00:15] or little you know babies
[1:00:17] you know they say you know when you have
[1:00:19] kids
[1:00:21] he says it's normal to to have a noise
[1:00:23] and have a lot of noise
[1:00:25] but when you have kids
[1:00:28] and all of a sudden it gets quiet then
[1:00:31] that's when you should go check
[1:00:33] that's when you should be worried
[1:00:36] I don't know go check the laundry room
[1:00:38] or something
[1:00:40] make sure they're not drinking something
[1:00:42] they shouldn't be drinking yeah
[1:00:46] but that's what happens
[1:00:48] if it's quiet
[1:00:51] you should be concerned but when there's
[1:00:54] that noise going on
[1:00:55] you have you can you know you're in the
[1:00:58] right spot
[1:01:00] and then closing off with this you know
[1:01:03] brother Brandon says he says that we
[1:01:06] have to strive with all that's in us
[1:01:09] he says to stay in the Life of Christ
[1:01:12] Jesus he said so that you should be
[1:01:15] fruit bearing
[1:01:19] is
[1:01:21] how Jesus taught us
[1:01:24] just by taking the word
[1:01:27] the promise in humility and um
[1:01:36] and here brother Brandon was you know he
[1:01:39] was closing off the service with a
[1:01:40] prayer
[1:01:43] he says Lord Jesus he says Jesus he says
[1:01:47] hour and 15 minutes now standing here
[1:01:50] he says trying to take your word and
[1:01:52] explain to the people how to overcome
[1:01:58] he says you told us how it's done
[1:02:01] you didn't only tell us
[1:02:04] but you showed us how it was done
[1:02:07] he says you let us
[1:02:10] you showed us how to do it
[1:02:12] receive the word inside of us
[1:02:16] and be sure to hold on to that word
[1:02:23] in every temptation
[1:02:25] but be humble
[1:02:37] through your power which has already
[1:02:39] conquered our enemies
[1:02:42] and he says the only thing we have to do
[1:02:44] is
[1:02:47] walk humble with faith is
[1:02:52] also taught us the importance of an
[1:02:54] identification is
[1:03:02] believing that our badge is
[1:03:06] of identification identification of the
[1:03:10] Holy Ghost
[1:03:11] and Satan has to move
[1:03:14] so once again as long as we're walking
