[42:57] God bless you brother
[43:00] it's always good to be in the house of
[43:02] the Lord
[43:04] happy to see every one of you
[43:09] Colombia as you know we just came back
[43:11] from Barranca Colombia
[43:13] and every one of the Brethren
[43:16] sends greetings
[43:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:28] what would happen in Barranca
[43:32] the local Pastor there
[43:35] is
[43:37] something happens to me
[43:41] I want you to go to Brothers
[43:58] sometimes the reason our pastor tells
[44:00] you something
[44:02] because God already shown him
[44:06] because he's trying to surprise you I
[44:08] see
[44:09] likewise the pastor from that place
[44:12] and he told his congregation
[44:18] Lighthouse I want you to see the webpage
[44:20] of our brothers from Phoenix Lighthouse
[44:22] the reason I say this is
[44:26] they know the majority of you
[44:29] they know who our musicians are yeah
[44:32] they know who the preachers
[44:35] they follow us online
[44:38] and admire every one of you is
[44:42] because of the pastor we have
[44:58] there's an appreciation to this church
[45:01] and to every one of its members
[45:04] and every one of the ministry that is
[45:12] my opinion
[45:15] I believe we have the best here
[45:18] because if you don't believe that way
[45:31] [Music]
[45:52] that you've been with your wife until
[45:55] you find out
[45:58] God give you a jewel in your
[46:02] handsome so what are you doing with that
[46:06] we have a stewardship that God's given
[46:09] every one of us
[46:12] that's what I'm happy to be home again
[46:16] there's nothing like being home
[46:18] when I get home is
[46:21] and I see every one of you
[46:24] I feel very happy
[46:28] if I hadn't seen you for a very long
[46:30] time
[46:31] I feel like I appreciate you more
[47:33] very tremendous
[47:53] are you now
[48:03] you attract people as you are
[48:07] not alone
[48:15] you attract uh things that are similar
[48:18] so you have young men and women
[48:21] they're going to attract young men and
[48:23] women
[48:24] because young men and women throughout
[48:26] the world
[48:28] they want to know what you do okay
[48:30] what do you do in your daily life
[48:33] how do you obtain the victory
[48:35] how do you overcome daily
[48:38] what do you do what do you do at work
[48:42] what do you do when you're out shopping
[48:44] how do you obtain the victory
[48:47] because it's not the big things
[48:50] scripture reads and our messenger says
[48:54] the small things
[48:56] that we stopped doing Queens
[49:03] from making it that day
[49:06] that's the big things
[49:29] um
[49:34] complicated you
[50:29] I have a series of messages that are
[50:32] chronologically hear from Brothers
[51:02] because you are what you eat
[52:00] his ways
[53:01] we need a member from the body of Christ
[54:02] and when his
[54:04] niendo

[54:08] house and putting his hands on him
[54:14] even Jesus
[54:27] may God bless you
[54:48] God bless you brother can you hear me
[54:54] um
[55:05] at first when we're on the plane
[55:07] um
[55:13] they had told me beforehand
[55:16] it was going to be a little humid
[55:20] I remember
[55:22] and I lived in Iowa
[56:08] young people
[56:20] as we are here in the pictures the
[56:26] together
[57:29] [Music]
[57:47] when you begin to know that person
[57:49] is a
[58:39] high school they're about to get their
[58:41] diploma
[58:46] and some were also working is
[58:51] switch
[58:56] [Music]
[59:04] came on every one of them is
[59:16] doing something
[59:21] during the service
[59:23] I think I noticed quite a bit
[59:27] and I want to go back a little
[59:31] um
[59:34] the first service which was on a
[59:36] Thursday
[59:46] I lost my voice
[59:49] pero
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:01:06] song leading
[1:01:08] Peppa
[1:02:09] well God has prepared for us
[1:02:11] so what we need to do is
[1:02:15] begin to move what's hindering us
[1:02:18] and let God do the work
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:29] as I was thinking about what's going on
[1:02:31] with my voice
[1:02:33] came to me
[1:02:36] and told me this
[1:02:39] is
[1:02:42] the moment I began to think
[1:02:49] other Brethren were treated us while we
[1:02:51] were there
[1:02:52] my mind is
[1:02:55] saying they don't even know me
[1:03:00] this way
[1:03:02] but they know
[1:03:06] who represents us a
[1:03:11] location yes
[1:03:23] we were speaking on Redemption
[1:03:28] the final plan
[1:03:33] would be for us to help our neighbors
[1:03:44] friend a brother
[1:03:51] and what came to mind
[1:03:56] and I'll leave you with this
[1:04:03] do you hear your brothers
[1:04:06] crying
[1:04:08] I want to tell you is
[1:04:12] do you hear your Brethren's cry
[1:04:15] now what are we going to do with it
[1:04:18] Joe
[1:04:24] the Joe
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:32] amenos God bless you brother uh
[1:04:36] pleasure to be here this morning
[1:04:39] I know I didn't dwell for a long time
[1:04:43] it was for about a week
[1:04:47] I'm a president who doesn't leave home
[1:04:49] too much
[1:04:50] or the state or city
[1:04:53] for me a little trip was long
[1:04:57] brother Eli said
[1:05:00] when I see every one of you is
[1:05:03] it feels like I hadn't seen you in a
[1:05:05] while
[1:05:09] it's a pleasure to be here before you
[1:05:12] this morning
[1:05:15] when you continue speaking on our
[1:05:17] missionary trip
[1:05:18] they told me to go in Spanish
[1:05:21] so I'm going to do my best
[1:05:25] being in Colombia I had no other options
[1:05:28] God was with us
[1:05:32] I was able to choose the correct words
[1:05:37] and I believe people received the
[1:05:39] message that I had was just not my
[1:05:42] message but the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:47] what helps quite a bit is
[1:05:50] the people get their in expectations
[1:05:58] you're going to feel like they're
[1:05:59] pulling something from you
[1:06:01] but they have a need I want to hear
[1:06:04] something
[1:06:05] and they're there uh waiting
[1:06:09] so that makes it a little easier
[1:06:12] to speak what we need to speak
[1:06:15] very beautiful trip of myself
[1:06:19] on Wednesday we got to the city of
[1:06:22] services
[1:06:26] we have services from that Wednesday to
[1:06:29] Sunday yeah
[1:07:28] that's when I was able to speak to more
[1:07:30] youth there in
[1:08:03] and
[1:08:07] I like that quite a bit
[1:08:11] something I was able to say is
[1:08:14] any of the youth there then have
[1:08:18] interested in English and learning
[1:08:20] English muchos
[1:08:21] Gustavo English everyone I would talk to
[1:08:24] tell me they liked English
[1:08:26] I would ask the same questions
[1:08:29] what do you like to learn English
[1:08:37] because when you like something it comes
[1:08:40] easier
[1:08:41] it's the same thing with the words
[1:08:46] if you like to follow God because of the
[1:08:48] love you have for him it'll become
[1:08:50] easier
[1:08:53] that was something that made an impact
[1:08:54] in myself
[1:08:57] many of them being there are very young
[1:08:59] there is
[1:09:03] my favorite brother Bernie message is
[1:09:05] this and that one yeah
[1:09:11] and they're giving me the want to learn
[1:09:13] more because they're they're young and
[1:09:15] they listen so much to brother Bernie I
[1:09:16] mean
[1:09:19] I want to make the effort to hear more
[1:09:21] of brother Bernie and more messages yes
[1:09:27] there's some of the pictures of the
[1:09:29] sisters that they sat in front of me yes
[1:09:32] and that's where I learned what our
[1:09:34] brothers
[1:09:41] and they begin to tell me the names of
[1:09:43] all the musicians
[1:09:44] and the brothers
[1:09:48] also the interpreters
[1:09:51] and sometimes the other brother they're
[1:09:53] able to see when the camera is on them
[1:09:56] and she told me
[1:09:59] yes
[1:10:01] in terms of services
[1:10:06] so they give me more interest to give
[1:10:07] all the information
[1:10:11] is
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:12:08] it was a good time
[1:12:11] nombre
[1:12:41] everyone begin to introduce themselves
[1:12:44] it was their name what they do what they
[1:12:46] like and what's their interest
[1:12:48] but a part that I like very much so
[1:12:51] after that okay now what we're going to
[1:12:55] do uh
[1:12:58] um
[1:13:00] every person is going to share now what
[1:13:03] God has done in their life
[1:13:21] had a great testimony
[1:14:24] back to
[1:14:28] it was a very good trip for myself
[1:14:31] but I know it was for them
[1:14:34] as I told you I'm very I keep to myself
[1:14:38] but knowing that we had a goals
[1:14:41] the purpose why we're there is
[1:14:46] to take all my thoughts
[1:14:49] or feelings
[1:14:53] and do the work of God into this
[1:15:00] we try the best
[1:15:02] and made the effort
[1:15:05] take time with the youth
[1:15:08] another thing we did uh yes
[1:15:11] that was on on Monday now
[1:15:15] we're done with our services
[1:15:19] on Monday we had time to do something
[1:15:21] else
[1:15:22] the idea my uncle had is
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:16:25] foreign
[1:17:25] I believe that was something very good
[1:17:27] for us
[1:17:28] we knew that they wanted to do something
[1:17:32] with them
[1:17:34] maybe push them a little more yes
[1:17:39] and that's something that I like very
[1:17:40] much on this
[1:17:42] tripado and with my brother also I was a
[1:17:45] little worried because of the weather is
[1:17:48] going to be very humidity
[1:17:51] and I've said in many occasions
[1:17:54] I don't like the humidity too much
[1:17:57] and as soon as we get off the plane
[1:18:01] humid it was
[1:18:05] there you don't even worry about it
[1:18:12] every service
[1:18:14] we believe would be outside
[1:18:17] oh we had a goal yes
[1:18:25] so they can continue the work
[1:18:28] experience I mean that was a great
[1:18:30] experience
[1:18:31] that's what I spoke on over there and
[1:18:34] I'll say it here is
[1:18:39] one of my pastor asked me the question
[1:18:41] if I wanted to go to Colombia
[1:18:43] is
[1:18:48] I said maybe one day I'll go on a
[1:18:50] missionary trip
[1:18:53] remember here I was sitting in the front
[1:18:58] when our pastor told us here tell your
[1:19:01] children to get their passports
[1:19:03] one day I'm going to ask them the
[1:19:05] questions
[1:19:08] I'm going to ask you if it's okay yes or
[1:19:10] no for your sons to go with me on a
[1:19:12] missionary trip
[1:19:13] I remember
[1:19:15] as I spoke over there
[1:19:18] in December I graduated in the
[1:19:21] University
[1:19:25] um yeah it's an internship
[1:19:32] an internship somewhere
[1:19:38] we got an internship into this uh
[1:19:42] foreign
[1:20:44] foreign
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:44] foreign
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:57] all right them when would you like me to
[1:22:59] start it doesn't mean
[1:23:02] we have two different dates where you
[1:23:03] can begin
[1:23:05] you can begin on the 6th of February
[1:23:09] this was the week that we're going to go
[1:23:11] to Columbia
[1:23:14] you can start on the 21st of February
[1:23:17] it will be the week that we got back
[1:23:20] after okay
[1:23:21] which would be this past Tuesday this
[1:23:24] Tuesday
[1:23:26] so I acted like I was thinking about it
[1:23:30] in my mind I already had the 25th yes
[1:23:35] I can't start on the six please
[1:23:45] I went to bed I went to my bed
[1:23:50] and I pray to God
[1:23:55] I know this is
[1:23:58] everything came out perfect plan
[1:24:01] I had time to go come back
[1:24:07] and get all the documents
[1:24:10] you gave me what I needed
[1:24:44] God bless you
[1:24:52] Menudo
[1:25:02] Salah
[1:25:11] I've always believed one thing
[1:25:15] that God has a plan
[1:25:17] and it's up to the parents
[1:25:20] talk to the parents to do their part
[1:25:23] I believe in God's plan
[1:25:26] uh take your seats and we cannot deviate
[1:25:30] from God's plan
[1:25:33] God knew from the beginning
[1:25:36] who he was going to commission
[1:25:40] who is going to anoint
[1:25:43] and those individuals sooner or later as
[1:25:48] the brother said it's going to click
[1:25:50] and click
[1:25:52] and I believe that with all my heart
[1:25:55] you got a lot of young people
[1:25:59] we're living in an age
[1:26:01] if we don't train our young people to
[1:26:04] understand
[1:26:07] that the beginners of this message
[1:26:12] I gotta go back and you need to
[1:26:15] understand
[1:26:16] but I have to go all the way back to
[1:26:19] Pablo Garcia Chavez
[1:26:22] senor
[1:26:32] I gotta go back because they opened the
[1:26:35] road
[1:26:36] was no one else
[1:26:40] then I have to look at the fact
[1:26:44] that brother Bernie G Garcia our pastors
[1:26:49] had a team and his team opened the path
[1:26:54] the door became wider
[1:26:59] in order for the future of his ministry
[1:27:03] continue in the field work
[1:27:07] and that's what we're doing it's not
[1:27:11] something that we have
[1:27:12] not our ministry
[1:27:15] but it's a continuation
[1:27:19] of the apostolic age
[1:27:22] we need to really understand
[1:27:25] the door was open the door has been
[1:27:28] closed what
[1:27:31] he's been doing if you want to believe
[1:27:35] it or not
[1:27:36] I gotta go back to 2008.
[1:27:43] where I sat down in my office of the old
[1:27:47] church I wrote down teams
[1:27:50] and we were Minute Men yeah
[1:27:53] we would go out and each person would
[1:27:56] have a song leader
[1:27:59] person that would be able to play an
[1:28:01] instrument
[1:28:05] to have the young people
[1:28:08] I did not have the young people on those
[1:28:11] teams uh
[1:28:14] he was eight years old
[1:28:18] let me put it again
[1:28:21] Joe was eight years old
[1:28:26] I have to go all the way back to 2008.
[1:28:30] was he part of the plan
[1:28:32] it's not my plan it's God's plan he
[1:28:38] knows who he's going to
[1:28:41] selected
[1:28:44] we just go with the goals
[1:28:47] the plan the plan that God has
[1:28:50] established
[1:28:52] and I'm going to tell you is it hard as
[1:28:55] parents yes it is
[1:28:57] it's hard to allow your son to go out
[1:29:05] the circumstance is the difficulties
[1:29:08] that he will have
[1:29:12] it's not easy they have to do what I do
[1:29:16] I get up early
[1:29:18] I can't sleep
[1:29:21] Guess what at a certain time they need
[1:29:24] to be up
[1:29:26] there
[1:29:29] having their breakfast
[1:29:33] and that's when it begins
[1:29:35] I told them what we were going to do
[1:29:38] it's a very hot and humid place
[1:29:42] and I'm going to tell you if you've ever
[1:29:45] been
[1:29:46] to the hottest place in your life
[1:29:50] I don't know what city that is that's
[1:29:52] very human
[1:29:54] we live in a dry Zone
[1:30:00] they
[1:30:01] there it's a wet sticky
[1:30:04] humid place
[1:30:08] this is a jungle
[1:30:14] was the jungle turned into a Town Pueblo
[1:30:20] there's a lot of mosquitoes
[1:30:23] there's a lot of animals there
[1:30:26] what you think yeah we have in the
[1:30:29] desert they have it there yeah
[1:30:32] so I'm going to tell you it was he first
[1:30:35] of all
[1:30:36] parents address
[1:30:43] your son
[1:30:45] your son's sequels
[1:30:47] did a fantastic work
[1:30:52] Fantastico the Bible says work
[1:30:56] they said
[1:30:59] and the works that they did it was not
[1:31:02] only for them
[1:31:05] but it was for those young people
[1:31:11] it is we are in charge of uh that church
[1:31:17] we're in charge of the church
[1:31:20] and I can't stop I will continue taking
[1:31:24] young people there
[1:31:26] because they need to hear the word of
[1:31:29] God
[1:31:30] first and foremost thing they need to
[1:31:33] hear the word of God
[1:31:36] they hear Brother Bernie they listen to
[1:31:39] us they know us however it has to be a
[1:31:43] personal revelation
[1:31:46] it has to be an experience a
[1:31:49] relationship between them and the Lord
[1:31:53] Jesus Christ now the question is when
[1:31:57] you have this type of setting
[1:32:01] were their baptisms
[1:32:05] John the Baptist where are you at
[1:32:08] how many did we baptize
[1:32:11] too
[1:32:16] was it a successful trip
[1:32:20] yes see
[1:32:22] yes it was
[1:32:24] because as they said
[1:32:27] we've never had that many young people
[1:32:41] and that's why I told them give them a
[1:32:44] little bit at a time
[1:32:45] once you give them a little at a time
[1:32:50] and that's what it is yes he is they
[1:32:53] want to hear more of the word of God
[1:32:58] somebody lost their voice well let me
[1:33:02] tell you
[1:33:03] um I love the kid
[1:33:05] I I love his ways
[1:33:08] but he talked too much it's very simple
[1:33:12] when you talk too much
[1:33:15] guess what you lose your voice
[1:33:18] not only that
[1:33:20] but I was told
[1:33:23] uh whenever it's hot
[1:33:26] put it this way we went from Bogota
[1:33:36] you go into a place that's humid and hot
[1:33:40] you don't wear shoes
[1:33:43] uh you think you're a big boy now yeah
[1:33:46] it does so you don't need shoes when you
[1:33:48] get up you're barefooted you know what's
[1:33:51] going to happen I don't have to tell you
[1:33:53] parents you're going to get sick you're
[1:33:56] going to lose your voice
[1:33:58] I didn't notice he lost his voice he was
[1:34:01] always
[1:34:02] having a good time that's nothing bad
[1:34:05] that's something good he was having such
[1:34:08] a good time
[1:34:09] he lost his voice did I know I wouldn't
[1:34:14] ever put him to direct the song service
[1:34:16] if I knew he had lost his voice
[1:34:20] I didn't notice it until all of a sudden
[1:34:23] I spoke on Sunday morning I heard
[1:34:27] somebody crying I go God
[1:34:30] good
[1:34:31] Thurman wasn't for people to start
[1:34:34] crying
[1:34:35] it was something for them to think about
[1:34:38] and I said well
[1:34:43] and I feel bad up to the day I feel
[1:34:45] right
[1:34:46] because he did lose his voice that he
[1:34:50] couldn't sing and that's when I started
[1:34:53] thinking about my friends
[1:34:55] they like to sing a lot
[1:34:58] that should have been there but sooner
[1:35:02] or later
[1:35:03] Jesus uh we'll get you
[1:35:08] but they want people
[1:35:13] the thing we don't do enough
[1:35:17] outside of praying foreign
[1:35:47] you are my heroines
[1:35:54] because all the girls were talking about
[1:35:57] they were all involved they wanted to
[1:36:00] hear more so
[1:36:04] I go back and
[1:36:06] when do I go back
[1:36:11] I laugh
[1:36:13] and the reason I laughed is I was
[1:36:16] looking at certain people
[1:36:18] no I like to look at people I'm not
[1:36:22] looking at you because there's something
[1:36:24] wrong
[1:36:29] uh yeah I think I'm gonna take so and so
[1:36:32] on
[1:36:34] and it wasn't that I like you or dislike
