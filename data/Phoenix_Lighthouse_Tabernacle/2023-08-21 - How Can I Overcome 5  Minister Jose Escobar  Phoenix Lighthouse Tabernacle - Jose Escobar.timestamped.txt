[26:27] it's a pleasure to be here in the house
[26:29] of the Lord in front of you
[26:32] and it's good to see each one of you
[26:33] this evening
[26:35] like the brother said this morning
[26:38] you know we have having some nice
[26:39] weather
[26:41] so we thank God for the cloudy days
[26:44] but we also thank them for the sunny
[26:46] days
[26:50] and so I thank you all for your presence
[26:52] here tonight
[26:54] I know many of you are maybe tired
[26:57] maybe you're sleepy
[27:00] maybe you're hungry you know but just a
[27:03] simple Act of you being here
[27:05] no you're an overcomer
[27:08] because being Overcomer doesn't mean
[27:11] that you don't feel those feelings
[27:15] that even though you feel those feelings
[27:18] but you're still here that's what
[27:21] overcoming is it doesn't mean that you
[27:24] don't fall
[27:24] doesn't mean you don't make mistakes
[27:27] it doesn't mean that you know you don't
[27:29] mess up
[27:31] even it means that even though you mess
[27:33] up even though you make mistakes
[27:36] even though you fall okay I almost still
[27:39] get back up and you're still moving
[27:41] and so we're all Overcomer this evening
[27:45] so it would be so kind of please open up
[27:47] your scriptures
[27:49] we'll be opening up to Revelations 3 uh
[27:52] 21 and 22.
[27:58] 21-22
[28:00] and this is the scripture we've been
[28:01] using for a part of this thought is
[28:06] and as you find the scripture I'd like
[28:08] to take this time to thank my pastor I
[28:10] mean
[28:11] for the opportunity
[28:14] I know he currently finds himself in
[28:16] Colombia secretary in Colombia I know
[28:19] along with him is our brotherly cell
[28:37] so I know I had the privilege to watch
[28:39] the services last night
[28:42] and the one this morning as well
[28:45] and as usual
[28:48] I can tell the people were blessed
[28:51] so let's go to the scripture
[28:54] and the scripture reads
[28:56] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[28:59] say with me in my throne even as I also
[29:02] overcame and sat down with my father in
[29:04] his throne
[29:07] [Music]
[29:13] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[29:15] the churches
[29:39] can we say
[29:41] we think gave us another day of life
[29:43] no Esther you be with us Lord
[29:46] maybe with me it may be with my
[29:49] interpreter as well
[29:51] may you anoint our lips
[29:57] maybe those who are here
[30:00] and those who are watching us online
[30:03] so I ask all these things
[30:11] amen amen you may take your seats
[30:17] so the topic we've been focusing on for
[30:19] some time now is how can I overcome
[30:23] so that's something that we'll be
[30:25] focusing on tonight
[30:27] but the question is how can I overcome
[30:31] but what I want to focus on is that
[30:35] there has to be a change
[30:38] you know we've spoken before
[30:40] that the best example of an overcomer
[30:44] is our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:55] you know he learned he grew as a person
[30:59] he changed so just as he changed we have
[31:03] to change as well so
[31:05] in order to overcome we have to have a
[31:09] change in our life
[31:10] no there has to be a turning point
[31:14] you know you were going one way
[31:17] you know but now you're going the other
[31:18] way and then how do we change is the
[31:21] question
[31:22] well then we have to have an experience
[31:24] with God
[31:26] you know an encounter with God no we
[31:30] have to make contact with God
[31:33] and why should we make contact with God
[31:36] because everything that comes in contact
[31:38] with God
[31:40] changes everything that comes to contact
[31:43] with God
[31:45] and so we can look to the scripture for
[31:47] many examples
[31:52] is the story of Paul De Pablo you know
[31:55] he was persecuting the church
[31:57] he was on his way to Damascus when he
[32:01] had an encounter with God
[32:03] no with the pillar of fire you know
[32:06] brother Brandon describes
[32:11] no he says that Paul was a church hater
[32:15] he says he was a saint
[32:38] and that sometimes what happens a lot
[32:40] with us right yes
[32:42] you know we think that we're maybe not
[32:44] the right person for the job
[32:48] but then God comes and says I choose you
[32:51] so here I have a quote from brother
[32:53] Brandon when he's talking about Paul no
[32:57] he says now today half the church would
[32:59] deny him
[33:02] God took him down to the road to
[33:04] Damascus
[33:06] Since There came the pillar of fire that
[33:09] led the children of Israel before him
[33:13] and he blinded him and made him fall to
[33:17] the Earth
[33:18] he says he took that man
[33:21] and Paul could say this
[33:24] one time I was a religious Pharisee
[33:28] a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[33:31] I had good intellectual back training
[33:36] but all of my education and all my
[33:38] intellectuals
[33:44] says I had to forget to know Christ
[33:49] and he asked how did you do it Paul he
[33:52] is
[33:53] I was on my road to Damascus to arrest
[33:57] those people
[33:58] and a light shined from the heavens and
[34:00] struck me blind
[34:02] and he says and from that time
[34:05] amen he says from that time
[34:08] he was a changed man you know this is
[34:12] from the message from that time
[34:14] you know the brother Brandon preaches
[34:16] many messages titled like that
[34:20] but this is the one he preached here in
[34:22] Phoenix Arizona in Phoenix Arizona and
[34:24] when you want to talk about change
[34:26] another character in The Bible
[34:30] no it's Moses it's Moises
[34:34] if you want to talk about somebody who
[34:36] was intelligent
[34:38] somebody who was educated
[34:41] it was Moses
[34:43] I'm an intellectual giant
[34:46] um
[34:47] he says he had the wisdom of all the
[34:50] Egyptians
[34:51] to the point where he could teach the
[34:54] teachers
[34:56] so you know how intelligent do you have
[34:58] to be
[34:59] you know the Egyptians considered one of
[35:01] probably the most advanced civilization
[35:06] and he could teach them
[35:08] you know that's something great
[35:12] just Moses was an intellectual giant
[35:15] intellectual says he had all the wisdom
[35:18] of the Egyptians
[35:20] because he could teach their teachers
[35:23] he was intellectual as he could be
[35:27] he says smarter far smarter than most of
[35:29] our brilliant men today
[35:33] because the Egyptians had things that we
[35:36] don't have today okay
[35:47] a body and make it look natural for
[35:49] hundreds and hundreds of years
[35:54] 72 hours is our limited
[35:58] as they put die on clothes that would
[36:01] never fade out yes
[36:05] he said they were way smarter he said
[36:10] you know and Moses could teach them
[36:14] yes but all of his intellectuals
[36:17] he had never met God
[36:26] he took his wife in a little old crooked
[36:30] sticker and he went down to Egypt he
[36:34] says because he had met God you could
[36:38] point back to that time
[36:43] it's our
[36:45] intellectual it's our education no
[36:48] that's the our way of thinking
[36:50] that's stopping us from changing
[36:54] no we want to change
[36:56] our way of thinking doesn't let us
[36:58] change
[37:00] no but just as God did with Moses
[37:02] no he can do with us
[37:05] we have to let him work in our life
[37:16] you know
[37:19] that Abraham was just an ordinary man uh
[37:23] come on no he was not a saint you know
[37:27] and he wasn't from a certain family
[37:29] he was an ordinary man and brother says
[37:33] I'm so glad that we don't have to be
[37:35] born in a certain line
[37:40] or be a great somebody
[37:42] and here's the key he says we just have
[37:46] to be humble and God's grace we'll do
[37:48] the work
[37:50] you know in order to overcome we have to
[37:52] be humble
[37:53] like we've said before it's not us that
[37:57] overcome but it's the word within as
[38:00] that overcomes for us
[38:02] and it's God's grace that does the work
[38:06] but I'm speaking on Abraham
[38:09] um he says God spoke to him and he had a
[38:13] definite experience
[38:15] and it changed his life and he says and
[38:19] the strange thing is
[38:20] when a man meets God he can never be the
[38:23] same well
[38:25] and can always point back to that time
[38:28] when he met him
[38:34] you know he said God spoke to Abraham
[38:37] in Abraham acted differently he said
[38:41] that every time a man meets God
[38:43] from that time you will act different
[38:48] he says if he rejects God
[38:50] he's in infantile right
[38:54] um
[38:55] he says or he will be a Godly sainted
[38:58] person
[38:59] um
[39:11] but he's led by the Holy Spirit
[39:14] he says maybe you're spiritually blind
[39:18] but when you're with God you can see
[39:21] because once again he says
[39:29] you know a man can never be the same
[39:32] person after they meet God
[39:35] and here's something that I found really
[39:37] interesting
[39:39] he says you will either be better person
[39:46] you'll be better off
[39:49] or you'll be worse after you meet God
[39:53] so I found this interesting
[39:56] that's myself how is that possible
[39:58] and so I think on characters in The
[40:01] Bible
[40:03] and one of them is Judas you know
[40:05] brother says he was just a man on the
[40:08] street
[40:09] no but after he met God
[40:12] he became a betrayer
[40:17] and he became a devil
[40:20] so when you meet God you can either be
[40:23] better off or worse off but what matters
[40:29] it depends on what you do with it
[40:33] says
[40:39] so you have to change and so here in
[40:42] this evening you know we're all here you
[40:46] all made the effort to be here
[40:48] something that's really great you know I
[40:51] look and I see our young boys here
[40:53] some of the other young there in the
[40:55] back
[40:56] and I see them you know and I admire
[40:59] them you know because I remember when I
[41:01] was their age
[41:02] no I did not want to be here at church
[41:04] you know I grew up in front of many of
[41:07] you
[41:09] so I can't lie to you you know when I
[41:12] was at a certain age
[41:14] you know Sunday morning I was here for
[41:17] sure Sunday night maybe not he says no
[41:21] Thursday night
[41:23] Thursday night that was less likely
[41:28] but then there has to be a change there
[41:31] came a time in my life where I was
[41:34] always looking forward to church
[41:36] because there was a need inside of me
[41:39] in church was the only place where I
[41:42] felt I can find refuge
[41:47] and so you feel that
[42:22] you know you want to go to church you
[42:25] know like my brother told me earlier
[42:28] you know we don't have we don't have to
[42:31] go to church
[42:32] we get to go to church and that's the
[42:35] difference we realized how blessed we
[42:37] are to have a building like this
[42:42] have a place where we can worship our
[42:44] Lord
[42:45] but that's what it is you know maybe me
[42:49] many of you men who are married
[42:52] you know maybe you can remember when you
[42:54] were maybe dating your wife
[42:58] no you had a date you know were you
[43:02] tired maybe you were tired maybe you
[43:05] were sleeping but that didn't matter
[43:07] we're going to be there no matter what
[43:10] so what about us with church or what
[43:13] about myself
[43:14] you know let's say let's assume you know
[43:18] let's say I have a date
[43:19] no I believe in miracles so let's say so
[43:24] let's say so let's say by the grace of
[43:25] God
[43:26] I have a date you know what am I going
[43:30] to do you know what I said how am I
[43:31] going to show up
[43:32] you know if my car breaks down
[43:35] well then I'm going to get a ride
[43:38] if I can't get a ride then I guess I'm
[43:41] taking the bus
[43:44] but I'm going to be there regardless
[44:45] trying to make sure my shoes are clean
[44:48] me I smell all right you know maybe try
[44:51] to look my best why because I'm showing
[44:54] that I have interest in God
[44:57] come to church it's a special day
[44:59] especially because if I say I love God
[45:02] then I should act accordingly
[45:05] and maybe that maybe that's maybe that's
[45:07] not you maybe you you like church
[45:11] he said you know I like church yeah but
[45:14] what I don't like no it's all those
[45:17] Elders prayers
[45:19] whenever there's altar costs
[45:21] you know the pastor comes up here he
[45:25] says he's going to be here for five
[45:26] minutes
[45:26] and easier for more than that
[45:29] and I understand where you're coming
[45:31] from
[45:33] you know I thought that way too yeah but
[45:36] then there comes a moment in your life
[45:38] when you're depending on that health
[45:41] and you're hoping for that elder sister
[45:45] I came to church
[45:48] he looked at me from the outside
[45:50] you looked at me from the outside
[45:52] and I looked normal normal but deep
[45:55] inside I felt like I was just falling
[45:58] apart
[45:59] I remember deep inside I was crying out
[46:01] to God
[46:03] I hope there's an Elder's prayer
[46:08] that's what I need right now and maybe
[46:11] that's not maybe that's not you he said
[46:12] maybe you don't need prayer no praise
[46:16] God Gloria but what about my brother you
[46:19] know maybe I'm good he says but what
[46:21] about my brother okay you know in order
[46:24] for me him to be my brother I have to
[46:27] feel for my brother you know a message
[46:29] I've been listening to a lot lately
[46:31] you know it's preached by our Apostle he
[46:35] titles their feelings
[46:36] you know he preaches it in Spanish
[46:40] like my brother said he tells
[46:42] sentimentals in espanol you know and
[46:44] somebody recommended that message to me
[46:46] you know they told me there's something
[46:48] in there for you
[46:50] and so I've been listening to it over
[46:53] and over
[46:54] I've been trying to digest it
[46:56] and now I'm trying to put into action
[46:59] you know because what's what's good
[47:01] about knowing all the scriptures
[47:03] you know all the messages if you don't
[47:07] put it into action and that's what we
[47:09] have to do and when we look at our
[47:12] brother
[47:13] the way we look at ourselves
[47:15] and we have to have we start to have the
[47:18] same feelings our Lord Jesus Christ had
[47:22] because in order for us to be brothers
[48:13] but in Spanish it says
[48:17] you know we have to have the feelings of
[48:19] Christ
[48:22] we know we'll have the feelings of
[48:24] Christ
[48:26] when we care for our brothers
[48:28] because the devil knows that when we act
[48:32] like the scripture says
[48:34] then God will manifest themselves
[48:37] through his people
[48:40] you know and when we care for one
[48:41] another
[48:43] that's when God sends his blessings
[48:47] in order to overcome
[48:49] you know we have to seek out that
[48:51] experience to our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:56] the thing is it's our choice
[49:00] you know God Jesus is he's a gentleman
[49:04] he's knocking at the door
[49:07] maybe sometimes
[49:09] we would like him to just bust down that
[49:11] wall
[49:13] and come in but he's a gentleman
[50:11] but
[50:16] from that
[50:23] maybe you still have those little habits
[50:26] but as long as you're making progress
[50:29] that's what matters you know one brother
[50:32] is going 20 miles per hour
[50:34] one brother's going 10 miles per hour
[50:37] what's going two miles per hour it's
[50:40] going really fast what's going really
[50:42] slow but what matters is their most
[50:44] picking progress
[50:46] and they will eventually both get there
[50:51] just we have to do we have to care for
[50:53] one another
[50:55] seek that experience with the Lord Jesus
[50:57] Christ
[51:05] you know I'll be wrapping up here
[51:09] now our Prophet tells us no that nothing
[51:12] that ever comes in contact with God
[51:15] it always changes but on top of that we
[51:19] have to have a point a moment in life
[51:22] that we can always point back
[51:25] and say from that time
[51:29] and we have to think about that no maybe
[51:33] there's somebody here
[51:34] who's maybe never had that experience
[51:37] maybe if you're somebody who doesn't who
[51:40] thinks that there's they don't have that
[51:41] point in their life
[51:46] no to ask God for that experience
[51:51] he's more than willing
[51:54] it doesn't have to be something
[51:56] complicated
[51:57] something simple like our brother said
[52:00] in the morning it's individual as
[52:03] individual you know he can help all of
[52:04] us but it's up to you individuals
[52:09] maybe you're somebody who's already had
[52:10] an experience with God he says
[52:12] God bless you but why not ask him for
[52:16] another one
[52:17] you know we have to have experience an
[52:19] experience with him all the time
[52:21] you know if I've had an experience yeah
[52:24] I gotta look for the next one
[52:26] because I got to get stronger
[52:29] I gotta grow as a Christian I'm gonna
[52:32] grow spiritually because that is and
[52:34] that will help everything else in my
[52:35] life
[52:37] so kind of please stand up yeah
[52:41] once again I appreciate you all for
[52:43] being here tonight
[52:49] God bless you as well
[52:52] kind of please buy your heads
[52:54] once again if you're somebody
[52:57] you know who wants that experience with
[52:59] God
[53:00] you know ask him for it you know he'll
[53:04] give it to you or maybe you want another
[53:06] experience
[53:09] and he will give it to you you know that
[53:11] is what we need we need an encounter
[53:14] with us we need that experience
[53:17] you know it's personal it's personal you
[53:20] have to come in contact with God
[53:22] and once again everything that comes in
[53:25] contact with God
[53:29] whether it be better off or will you be
[53:32] worse it depends on you but God does his
[53:36] part
[53:39] so let us pray
