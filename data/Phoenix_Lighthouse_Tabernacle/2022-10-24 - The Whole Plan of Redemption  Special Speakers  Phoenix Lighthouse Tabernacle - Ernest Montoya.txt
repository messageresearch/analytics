for them now I'm happy to be here in front of you this morning it's quite the privilege I'd like to thank our pastor for the trust he puts in me right now he currently finds himself in Peru and I was able to watch some of the services and it's good to see that they're getting blessed over there yes in your scriptures we're going to be doing the base scripture which is in Hebrews 9 11. it indicated it was an amen once you have it reached us Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building foreign caps but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us is the blood of bulls and goats in the ashes of in heifer sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh de la carne how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God is your heavenly father we thank you for the chance you give us to be here once again it's a beautiful morning Lord and I think we're all thankful to be here this morning I pray for those who are here Lord and those who are watching us you give them all the portion they need will you be with me the rest of my brothers will be speaking may you also be with our interpreter because we do this all for your honor and Glory Jesus Christ amen amen me take your seats so we read that scripture Hebrews 9 11. you know and I think by now it's a scripture that many maybe most of us know by memory you could probably just recite it without having to read it but it's good that we read it over over and over I think the key lies there in repetition repetition is the more we repeat the more we practice makes perfect and ideally we want to be perfect why do we want to be perfect because we want to be like Christ in Christ himself is Perfecto he had to be perfect because he died for our sins in order for that sacrifice foreign how many are happy this morning for that sacrifice I'm thankful for that great blessing that he died for my sins on that cross touching on the script teaching on on Redemption it's just still a topic we're covering and this the message I was listening to is a job from 1955 and I really enjoyed it but it's so good I could I could never do it justice I could never say the stuff he said but I have just a few quotes here that I liked from the message and here are the first one I have is did you know exemption was even before the planet Redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed he says think of that he said God foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world and I think that right there is great that's a topic that many of the youth have come up have have touched on even before the world was formed there was already a plan laid out yesterday that's because God being all-knowing he knew what was going to happen but even then he already laid out a plan for us and that's something I really appreciate and it goes on for the Bible plainly says that Christ was predestinated or ordained and was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world that's right I see yes way before the world was made God had a Plan of Redemption yesterday it's not just for myself but for yourself is that he knew there was something I was listening to our pastor speak over there in Peru he was here we had our strength we had our weaknesses but he didn't focus on our weaknesses and I'm so thankful for that because we have a perfect sacrifice he says that God doesn't look at us he has to look at the sacrament foreign something I got to do brother Branham says no you don't have to do one thing I said it's by Grace you're saved see see not nothing that you do there isn't one thing you could do that would amount to anything the plants already made redemptions already paid for the only thing you have to do is accept it so that sounds really simple that's what we have to do we know about it and we have to accept it you know and some of this thoughts started I was up here interpreting for our brothers when they were up here uh or a couple of young brothers and maybe my brother will agree here when you're an interpreter I feel an advantage you have you have to everything they say you have to process it as well so you feel like you maybe get a little bit of a better understanding than if you were sitting down on the benches and uh one thing everything all my brothers said impacted me one thing that our brother Antonio has said he mentioned a quote from I believe it was questions and answers on the seals and I'm paraphrasing here this is but he he talked about how God didn't present himself to certain people because they weren't even redeemable and so in other words if he presented himself to you it's because you're redeemable and that when he said that impacted me and I immediately started thinking of a lot of people so I think maybe there's people I know who are currently not in church he says maybe they've gone away from church but they know about it and it's been presented to them therefore and Don says they're redeemable yes I feel that I should give you some comfort maybe it's your brother or it's a sibling or something they too are redeemable and what what does redeemable mean you're able to be recovered or safe from false or bad aspects a synonym for that is being restorable yes and restorable is you're capable of being restored or brought to a former conditions and that's what we want to restore that condition or restore that fellowship with our Lord and savior so if you're here this morning you know you're redeemable this isn't by coincidence no it's coincidence that you know about this message and God's presents himself to you in your life and to wrap up another quote from the same message this one I like I like the way brother bam says so he says you he's talking about God you know we as humans no we we know the importance of a plan is a plan a financial plan financiero or maybe it's a career plan or it's an education plan it's something that requires you to maybe sit down and think about it he had it in his great heart how he would bring this all about and then if he foreknew the church foreknew Christ for another plan and set it all in order foreign God's working all things together for those for the good to those that love him foreign [Applause] a little bit bigger ones God bless you brother we greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when I continue with the subject first I'd like to thank my pastor yeah the Lord Jesus Christ for this opportunity my brothers in Iowa our brothers in South America God bless you brethren come on what's up brother then soon Redemption is as we've been learning crucial something crucial importante something important is necessary it's necessary we will to be able to live is uh is it's a little of everything brother but more than one thing because Redemption it is happiness is the lord it's pain trials is really Eterna it's eternal life as I told you a little bit of everything is crucification the crucifixion die into this world is necessary in the Plan of Redemption everything begins with a thought hear the mind as I was studying he uh I know this message of brother Branham title communion is he begins to describe what the Lord Jesus Christ is going through at Gethsemane he begins from the cruel testing Anton says then he will not spare you or I from the cruel testing Jesus and Jesus was here confronting the greatest test he had ever had just before him with our once in final all-sufficient test must come the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder there was no one in all Heavens on earth that could ever stood it but him and to know that all of the sins of past sins and present sins and future sins rested upon this decision and it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his great messiahship as when he said to God not my will now my will be done they will be done tormentors that was the greatest Victory he had ever won all the Demons of Torment was around to tempt him and try him the Lord Jesus Christ at everything in him that was that he needed and it's the same with us today everything we need we have God's word we have it brother when I begin to see him so I see something physical so I can better understand it something that I like to do I like to go to the mountains have a little exercise inside and I began to think foreign and they gave me everything that is necessary backpack water everything I would need even they bring a guide so you can make a way for me and climb the mountain in Julio and the temperature be 120 degrees here in Arizona about 1pm s but if we don't follow the guide if we don't use the equipment we've been given mucho we're going to struggle very much we could even die physically or spiritually and we all go through our Gethsemane we're all going to go through a moment in our lives there's so much Darkness we can't even find the answer many times as I told you he's giving us everything we need to overcome this trial and many more is our souls amen amen e Elementary in the same message and then he makes it personal yeah then The Temper came to me is that one time in all my life is there you are that's the reward for trying to serve him you mean that he'll take the young 22 year old mother and lay her Yonder as a corpse in the morgue he said yes and then we'll take the precious baby your own flesh and blood and slam your prayer right in your face and then you mean to say that you will that you will serve him but this is going to happen to all of us we feel stronger than ever since we think we're doing the best we can in serving the lord Jesus Christ a trial will come to our lives okay he's treating you this way foreign foreign there's nothing you need to do but uh to be better you're already perfect for Kentucky because the sacrifice is perfect I'm trying to impress God just believe in his word and continue on this precious Journey God bless you brother attention thanks for your attention we thank you [Applause] Hermanos good to be here with you I appreciate my brother appreciate my brother of course our pastor Pastor the opportunity to be here with you just to share a little bit you know when going into the Plan of Redemption as we've been doing for the past couple of months there's an endless amount of things that we can speak especially uh when we talk about how it's impacted us how this helped us we just want to share it back with you so there's there's like I said there's an endless amount of things that we could share I've had the the privilege this month is we have about a between three to six students sometimes on Sundays and then the class uh 12 to 13. it ranges from week to week it is we've been talking a little bit about the Book of Matthew yes specifically in the first couple chapters so we just we want to go around the subject of baptism I was uh before having knowing that we were going to be here I had agreed with the students today was going to be a day where I I had some some money if they answered questions they were going to get money and that comes that inspiration comes from from our brother and I said that we need a little bit of extra motivation motivation just to be able to pay attention so I'm just following the Footsteps in front of me trying to do the best that we can it's really a privilege to be there with them we have some interesting students our brother our brother or another brother of course our sister Jasmine they're all very different they all there are some old times I'll be paying attention and sometimes they're just talking yeah advantage of such a small classes can sit there with them and so what we've been talking about I'm going to turn to it now Matthew 16 24. and I'll I'll read it uh quickly and so Matthew 16 24. then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me or whosoever will save his life shall lose it and for whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it okay or what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul that's all we're going to read we began reading Matthews one two three and four come on and you know with the first was just the the generations and we go on to this beginning and then we go on to where the Lord was baptized and so we focus on this scripture specifically in verse 24. Jesus says unto his disciples you know he's talking to his disciples he's giving him the idea of what it is that we have to do if any man will come after me let him deny himself it's not an easy thing to deny yourself you know to uh to your desires you know your privileges and what it is that you want to do deny yourself it's it's not easy no it's fussy and then the next thing pick up your cross you know when we look at that what's he saying with that and he's saying our responsibility whatever God has given us will there be at our job here at church your cross take up your cross your responsibility responsibility and then the last one the most difficult most difficulties follow me and it's not easy to do these things but it's it's what a plan that he has for us and he's telling his disciples his followers and he's selling it to us deny yourself pick up your own crosses not the cross is my brother at the cross of my father I don't know my sister whoever your responsibility not only you know what that is and then to follow him and then he continues whoever will save his life foreign that's what he's telling us to do it's I understand it's a lot easier said we have examples and we can lean on to move forward you know this scripture gives us a promise we're able to dedicate Our Lives educate Our Lives over to the Lord that there's a reward waiting for it whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it he's promising he's giving us a promise if we're able to deny ourselves pick up our cross he's giving us a simple reward for that and you know this morning wherever you're at wherever I'm at struggling with my own things it doesn't matter where we're at this morning because you have the opportunity I have the opportunity right now I'm so privileged to be here and to be able to grasp on to this you know like I said it doesn't matter where you're at it's just come as you are right that's all you can ask of us and we're here this morning we came as we are and we have an opportunity it's an opportunity you know and looking as at small victories you know sometimes just just arriving here so it's just coming to church it's not you might think it's just coming to church I've been coming my whole life so for some people it's a victory you just maybe don't even think about it for some people that's a victory or to sing along applaud your hands sometimes it's a victory and in those tiny small things you know we can come together to achieve the Victory and so again I congratulate you this morning because you're here and you have the opportunity to grasp on to this and then and to achieve achieve the victory Victoria and as we turn it over to our Brother Carlos you know I feel extremely privileged and be able to share this with you foreign and I want us to make it so God bless you Brothers may the Lord be with you God bless everyone this morning foreign [Music] and we speak of the mouth of God for the mouth of God comes in
