known Alexis for over 35 years she was my best friend when we were young I have nothing but beautiful memories of her being young 11 years old going to her house my sister Ellie at night her mom making tacos and rice us jumping in the pool first time I ever went to a theater was with them we watched her pee goes bananas I I admired Alexis a lot because she was she was a rebel even at that young age I remember admiring her so much because she would stand up to anybody she would say what was in her mind and me being from a small town coming to a big city and having very strict parents I couldn't dared defy my parents or fight the way she did I remember singing in the choir with her I remember when we were like 11 and 12 we would sing specials in church at the Fillmore Church and beanie and Nina and Becky we'd all hang out together and going to the Phoenix Tabernacle Day school being in the seventh grade and brother Montoya was our teacher that memory just came to me whoa and we were rebels we well I started being a rebel hanging out with her we used to play softball it was it was fun times fun childhood being in church all the time and then you know I remember very clearly being in seventh grade and we I used to go to Greenfield she used to go to Kennedy and we would meet each other during recess and lunch hour and the schools were separated by a chain-link fence and I would see her and I'd call her over or she would see me and we'd meet there and we'd look like convicts talking to each other separated by that by the chain-link fence the were 14 at that time and she's you know were all interested in boys at that time and talking about him and our troubles and everything else but then you know life gets ahold of you and you drift apart and I would see her sporadically in church and I always made it a point to talk to her though because I loved her she was my best friend and I saw her babies growing and her having babies us having babies I always tried to be there for her when she came around I by my actions I hoped but I let her know that I loved and when she had her stroke I went to go see her and she was happy and cheerful and she didn't look like she had had a stroke but um Alexis wherever you are till we meet again girl keep up that strong tenacious spirit of yours I love you how's everybody tonight how's everybody tonight still how's everybody tonight okay not everybody okay we're good I'm gonna reflect a little bit on my sister someone who's probably uh make you want to fall off the chair say I can't believe it but ultimately is the power of God God's power is transformation sister Liz had also said that she was a fighter she was also a lover she loved hard she loved her family very hard if anybody went against her family she'd bring it to you you know Holly took to testify to that when she said you found out about Maryville she was a track star she ran track with you bond and how lethal won't admit it he probably wants to forget it but uh I think it was a Bobby Wedgwood or was a happy Holmes some guys happy homes they stole her leafless bike where they want to steal her Leto's bike and it was a Lexus Anna and Yvonne chased a bunch of gang members you know and these guys ran like they were scared like they had guns and machetes and stuff like that she they caught up to them they never they never bothered they didn't bother you again huh Naruto see yeah yeah he got the bike back to elect sound she loved hard I remember I said she loved hard right if anybody ever deserved I'm gonna hold you up a picture you seen it if anybody ever deserved to be a bride it was my sister Alexis an along with my other sisters not because I'm handsome and I'm right here this is about her some of us are sad maybe because you haven't said anything we weren't able to but we should always remember that if we are family if you are extended family Kristen we should always think right do right say the right things no matter what because today isn't is it promise tomorrow is not promised I remember my sister when I had the privilege when Nikki thank you you gave me the privileges I've seen my sister before what was my sister I couldn't mourn I couldn't mourn my mom was telling me uh it's that when it's okay to cry Jesus cried that one it's okay maybe I was still processing it maybe I was ready to start bubbling up getting angry and and I started thinking I said why was I not told I know she called him on to talk to me I know she sent her blessings to Lupita and I she loved Lupita very much but at that moment I I was trying to search my mind because I wanted to hear her voice and when I saw her I said I can't cry I can't cry well when I saw her I started to weep and that's what I needed then when I went to the car I wanted to hear her voice I couldn't remember her voice and then her voice came to me and I started hearing her and it was good thing she said to me and I remember who wasn't about my weight Stefan you need to slow down on tacos alright but I remember the last meal she she she vited me to her apartment she made us she made me for my birthday tacos beans and rice some may not believe it but she was a very good cook I liked it I liked she was a very good cook you know she made she brooder awesome pot of coffee too she did some people got a funny story about my dad but you know this it was a very good cup of coffee you know I told her at mine why you're trying to kill me it's hard and she would just laugh and say you should put his tar and little cups like that but she drank it at full full strength strength I drank a little bit in I think I was raised I would think I was doing push-ups not for that but I always teased her always teaser one when she was washing dishes I said what is that smell is that bleach what are you trying to do kill me she stopped she would start laughing she goes no it's just a little bleach just to help get it clean I think I said be careful of the cafe gonna get me it's a bleach you know my sister was a very sweet you know people don't know that but I could tell you this we spent many a nights I lived with there for a while I had broke my hand in a car accident I almost died and and she came to the hospital one of the other times I almost died and she came when I opened up my eyes she was leaning over me and I think she took she told the nurse the nurse too deep and I think it was time for my sponge bath my sister gave me a sponge bath she blessed me sewers she was awesome nurse she cared for me she loved me and at that time I was kind of running streets I was never a unwelcome at her house you know she was always strong as anybody else would be you know you come respectfully you don't disrespect so on and so on but uh many times many you may not even know it well yes we spent time talking and whenever I was done with cigarettes and I didn't have no money sister Alexis Sam he said cigarettes yes I did we shared cigarettes or or I'll go get her cigarettes or she gave me money for cigarettes yes that one was a cigarette smoker for many years amongst other things but uh I had an opportunity God was merciful I heard a voice and he told me to come out and I obeyed my sister was a fighter she fought to the very end and what she forgot she forgot one thing that this fight is not a flesh fight the fight that we fight is not a flesh fight the fight that we fight is a spiritual fight God has already conquered this fight all we had to do was just give it to him now I'm not gonna start preaching because I think I almost started but if you please stand and help me sing you know in the world and we have favorite songs right the beat goes on we open up our heart to that certain song and next you know we just lose it we shouldn't be downcast right now my sister's heaven right now believe it or not why would I ever say my sister's in hell but there are people here right now that are in hell they have a personal hell at home I'm not saying your wife all right I didn't tell you who to marry but we all have personal battles we all have personal matters we have ups and we have our downs and a lot of us have been down and out but today today tonight get up tomorrow is not promised we can rig into a fire that maybe some of us have lost maybe we can let a a fire start in our hearts that we never had before but we're gonna sing amazing grace and we're gonna welcome [Music] the Lord Jesus Christ and his message [Music] Amazing Grace ah sweet that's a forage like me I was [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] our first [Music] and you hear me now I bless you I believe that we we love the doll of you though don't you [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's got real good manners in the pulpit the podium you're mistaken better pack up your bags and go home okay you know but I'm not here to insult you but I'm here to encourage you what he said right now well he's you know he got a little out of order but that's good to get out of order or once in a while you know I'm so glad set me free all about you so glad you can stand up as an individual thank you very seated you know you might think I'm out of my mind but that's okay you're a little late for that get set up and I'm not here to entertain you but when you've been in prison as long as I have it does something to you it changes you when you're locked up into a place and they tell you to do this at a certain time move this way you can't do this you got to do this that and the other every 12 years it forms you brother boom that you were in prison for 12 years yes sir I was in prison but as a teacher so I got out of experience of people that are prison right now you're a prisoner did you know you're a prisoner right now how many of you are prisoners well alexis was a prisoner but she's been set free that's how I was singing I said that we are now kings and priests according to the Word of God now you believe this Bible that's okay not this particular Bible it could be the post Bible the Catholic Bible the Orthodox Bibles the Baptist Bible but it's the Bible it's the Word of God and the Word of God is powerful and you are also powerful because the words that you speak they are powerful those words that you speak they have a meaning they have a definition and in that definition they work within the confines of that definition thanks little attorney does what attorney talks to you and he says well he's wrong why is he wrong well he went out the limit of the law over here he said this because it should have said this but about you you understood him saying I'm gonna be with me did I leave you already I know and right but that's okay Alexis I didn't know that I don't know that she was born September 7th was the 28th one eat that was the one I was a student uniform it's a cop standing up Juanita still in uniform when mamma's water bag broke outside the seventh Avenue over here in Buckeye that the hospital we wanted to do it a red belts here are we okay did I say that and he nurses doctors here lawyers engineers Thank You mija now she got set free too she was into the drug addicts into the drugs I think I didn't teach her that okay I'm not beating on you right might be in you but something happened to her God changed I didn't change with God changer it was God's Word we deposited a word in her we now I want to say within the next 15 minutes man it's hot in here you but there's a hotter place that we're trying to escape isn't that true we're all trying to escape that place I don't care where you come from who are you going inside of you there's something that got deposited inside of each and every one of you today and I'm going to show you scripturally not because I belong to brother Bernice Church finish tabernacle nor do i because i we have a sister church this is our sister church but this is where we come from okay bruh and we want to thank brother Montoya we're going to thank everybody here for helping us here for facilitating the place we're going to thank you brother thank you everyone here and for and for you people that are here to honor Mama Olga and the rest of the clan oh I never thought I'd be there now I'm not worked up because of that I'm just worked up because I'm always worked up but one day in 1980 have run that time Jacob something happened to me something supernatural happened to me the word of the God in st. John 3 what he says he means you must be born again it happened to me here in Phoenix and from that time I'm not the same won't be and I refuse to be the same I refuse to to go back you know what I'm just like you guys I'm walking along in Satan says look at that girl over there but you're 73 shut up devil you know I'm still a young guy you know and oh I lost some of you your wife is gonna get angry at you you better put that cross front when you're driving okay put the cross where you can keep your eyes on Jesus okay but he every day from the top when I get up temptation after temptation but I go nope Jesus said this I don't have time for you saying get away from me it's the same thing I am locked up in prison in this pest house in this prison house and I can't help but because you and I have these five avenues we see things right yeah okay nobody nobody with me we've got five senses right we can see and we can hear we can smell or we smell that marijuana why should smell it too you know and I loved it when I could put those maggots in jail okay right my favorite but after a while it got old you know what it didn't make no sense you know it didn't make no sense because you know you do all this paperwork and and it's look if they go free that's crazy that's crazy you know you shoot a gun with this guy with this hand over here and you go to hell you're in prison for 20 years you shoot the gun with over here you say ahh and you're free it's ridiculous you know the law that's with the laws but God's law is truthful and it's abideth forever now when I said I came in and I wanted to bless you right and I did bless you didn't I I blessed it because I believe with all my heart that we are Abraham's seed now I'm not talking about the two seeds I'm not talking about that I am saying that I believe I am Abraham's seed don't get religious on me okay but and I believe that with all my heart and I Bank on that so when I bless somebody I bless you if you receive it god bless you don't that's your problem that's okay that's okay I'm still walking on Wow jesus said in Matthew 5:4 blessed are they this is the most preposterous message or words that I've ever heard from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he said blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted please you lost your loved one and you and your and your in your over the crying is all Lord what can I do but blessed are they see you're blessed you don't understand you're being blessed but you are blessed and the reason you know you are blessed is because you're not taking the tooth that 38 issued in your brain job because everything's gone no you know there's a hope you know there's a goal for you and the goal is Jesus Christ and is to go to that place and to not only that but to shine the light to other people and tell me Jesus is real this is not just a figment of your imagination it's not just going to church but God is really changes your life he is real what is it that change is a drug addict like this guy who were here after 15 years on whatever it is you're garbage jr. but anyway I didn't bring him up that way but it was God delivered delivered him and change him but there are people that never change there's people that actually lose their mind I don't know why you didn't lose your mind maybe you didn't lose your mind I lost my mind but I lost my mind to Jesus okay now this is the bad part I'm gonna go into the bad part and I'm gonna go slow okay you want to hear the bad part you want to hear the good the bad and the ugly okay I made a bunch of notes and I told a brother Montoya who I talked to I says I don't know what to do I don't know what to say I'm gonna read Ecclesiastes 3 3 1 2 everything there's a season in to a time every purpose under the heaven a time to be born in that time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep a time to cast away time to Rend it - time to sow a time to silence a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace that's God's Word that's God's anointed word it doesn't make sense to you perhaps but that's God's Word and it's been fulfilled right before your eyes this body is dying daily you and I are dying I'm not taking you to Genesis were where what happened for the great fall I'm not talking about that but I want to get to a place where I think that many of us including brother Alex failed you know I said now this is not God okay I said words shape our behavior our ways of thinking we said that the word a word is powerful and has definitions your kids when they hear you talk they believe here they look up to you yeah Papa yeah mama what do you want me to do you're gonna go to college Johnny by golly you're gonna be a doctor oh yeah I want to be a doctor guess what greasy kid believes that maybe he becomes a doctor words are powerful do you think brother Alex when he was burned in 65 was that kind of a guy no sir no sir I'm not entertaining - you okay brother Johnny here you know you know this brothers here's the witness right here brother Johnny glad I hear let's just pull it out don't you tell me what to do even if I couldn't beat the guy had run away from him but he ain't gonna get me all this fight you hear about Alexis that fighting brother way Jacob I didn't know that that uh Devon stand up 1 this is my daughter okay this is my daughter she's the oldest one right I looked at her a night I looked at her and I go and Good Samaritan Hospital I look at the baby I said oh my god what did I do so Alexis and Indian told me just you the day that they went at it guess where that wasn't at the honky Tonk or the dancehall no at the church where they were washing cars and they went at it no holds bar the good the bad and the ugly brother Alex did not say very nice words okay let me go back to don't don't give me as a custard mama and dad did not teach me how to cuss you're gonna like this okay my mind dad did not teach me how to dance mama and dad did not teach me har oh you know what that is drinking the Tutera okay or to smoke the pipe to become a plumber or the cigarette or the poodle whatever no they didn't teach me that so I told my kids Alexis Annie Yvonne whenever small no I'll do that no don't do that it's a lot but the butter- see no negative this negative that negative this she knows that you guys know me tempered like a buzz saw but Jesus set me free and Jesus is real I don't care how much religion you haven't you how much you're not a womanizer how much you're not a drinker but if you have never met Jesus face to face if you've never experienced of being born again then you're in going to go where Alexis is that you parents right now you Christian parents you need to advocate you need to intercede for your children your kids your grandchildren God loaned them to you to see what you were going to do with them he gave you your riches she gave you a job to see what you're going to do with it it's only loan to you your house swimming pool your boat whatever it is to see what you're going to do with it I really going to glorify Jesus Christ for that but that's okay do it so that's the kind of guy I was but I'm not talking about me we're talking about Alexis it's all this is all your woven with Alexis so they start growing up but you and I were actually born with a filter inside of our bodies inside of here instead of here and we're all this life that that God gave you you say no no that's not true mama and daddy had sex and this happened and this happened and I came out there was a body yeah okay you go to Genesis say you're right right you're right but I'm talking about God for ordained you predestined you to come here to be here in 2018 January 20th is it or D that is my place to be here so you could hear the words of life the words of life that Alexis left she's no longer in Hell now if a person lived in hell it was Alexis and I saw her a 35 Avenue I'm going I'm going but that's okay that's okay 3500 McDowell Emilio and I to go to school I'm driving under school and she's lying there where they pick up the bus the bus got up picks them up Jacob and she's there lying lying on the sidewalk reading the book I told let me do you do drugs that's what's gonna happen and when she was there I don't know when she stopped doing drugs that's what I want to tell you but the effects of drug addiction it's a bad thing it messes your mind up the central process the central processing unit especially with a that particular drug the pike thing I think I might going the right way because I do not because all I did was they give you that class in the Academy class about marijuana to smell it and all that so I never tried it by the way and I'm not that hypocrite the guy says well I never inhaled it or smoked it or whatever no when I heard where the deputy serves here in the Maricopa County that guy says long you're not telling the truth he says they're doing here what are they call it when they do these there are there in two but the polygraph got it yes everybody's done where one and at one time another this guy has never done it my mama and papa told me not to smoke that stuff because I don't even I don't even feel I didn't even know what marijuana was anyway the merits not my subject I likes the sound okay what am I talking about you know I I I feel sorry for you guys okay but you got a built-in Fichter filter that filter that you have inside of you it distinguishes you from an animal life you're not an animal by the way yes yes you could be classified in the animal kingdom No okay okay those of you that know biology okay all the ologies and all the garbology okay okay this is not garbage this is the Word of God I believe in doctors I get I believe that doctors are placed here to help mankind people to help you and I that built-in filters it distinguishes you from animal life and if I can say it if I can be so bold I want to call it it's my car mica my car it's M I ca are it's an acronym I didn't come up with it because of my intelligence I just came up with it because I didn't know how to memorize it any other way it's your memory your imaginations your conscience your affections and your reasoning it's a very life that it's inside of you it's a real you and it's inside of you I can't see but it's inside of you okay that inner self moves the outside person to see to hear to smell to taste or touch did you get it okay I want to move on the scripture I'm gonna give you the scripture so you can check it out is deceiver I flipped off but that's okay that's another subject altogether okay okay first this alone eons 523 st. Paul reads reads there any Saint Paul I believe in st. Paul how many of you believe in st. Paul he wrote 14th epistle is there in the New Testament st. Paul the first messenger to the church changes in the Ephesians church age any and he spoke and he said this in to the Thessalonians he says you know and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly not partially but wholly the entire you and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ now that's God's promise that's God's Word and that's what you and I have you're not just by yourself the body goes you have a solar in spirit whatever you do do always what are you talking about we'll leave that for another time okay but I'll just make it simple I'll break it down the nature of the spirit the nature it's got that's the soul that's the way it is but there's three of you there's one of you okay but there's three of you okay moving on because so we can close because uh you you want to get out of this hot winter preacher right that okay I didn't hear any man you want me to keep on going oh no no no you really don't want that do you really want it okay okay I get a telephone call from a friend of mine from Tucson Arizona his name is Isaac of sodium he's one of the pastors over there and he says brother I want you to go to three-inch at us will be three-inch at us what are you talking about I want to go to Thrun Charis well I'll go when I can because I was in a job brother Montoya back in July 27th around that time I started a job with HUD how I God won't ever do a hard job but that's okay we did it so I tell them I can't go right now brother because I'm doing this job and I got to finish it blah blah blah

Tabernacle brother Bernie saw something in him saw something in him I'm gonna please use the pastor you're going a to sign bye-bye that was it so he anyway he called me and he says I want you to go
