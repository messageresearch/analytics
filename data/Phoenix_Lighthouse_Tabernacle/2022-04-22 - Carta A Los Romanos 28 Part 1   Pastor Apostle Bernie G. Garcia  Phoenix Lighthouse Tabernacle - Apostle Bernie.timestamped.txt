[18:10] transparency here
[18:33] pyramid along with the capstone pyramid
[18:35] itself has seven uh parts two of seven
[18:37] steps going up
[18:55] [Music]
[19:07] and at the same time it's each
[19:09] individual
[19:16] the church has to have the headstone in
[19:18] order to be sealed
[19:36] the age to which martin luther was a
[19:38] messenger
[19:42] that's the beginning of the return again
[19:45] of the wheat plant
[19:50] that's the ace that produced the stock
[19:55] that's the fifth age
[19:58] like that's the wesley then the sixth h
[20:00] wesley's age
[20:04] we proved that that was the age that
[20:06] produced the castle
[20:09] then the seventh age
[20:11] is the layout church
[20:17] that produces the shock
[20:33] formed outside of the three steps
[20:38] it's separate from the three steps
[20:42] it's outside of the three steps
[20:44] [Applause]
[20:46] that's the eighth
[21:00] is
[21:13] even though we already mentioned that
[21:14] last sunday
[21:17] it's the head age headstone age
[21:22] it's the age of the eye
[21:25] it's a bright age
[21:28] it's the
[21:41] once again
[21:56] of the people of israel in their
[21:57] homeland
[22:04] in the time of the placing of god's
[22:06] children
[22:08] if you understand so far say amen
[22:23] just trying to see if you understand
[22:24] what i'm trying to say
[22:31] to teach something if it's not being
[22:32] understood
[22:36] so let's repeat all together as a class
[22:51] young man here
[23:06] of the matter
[23:20] is
[24:01] it's the word
[24:16] yourself
[24:27] just for you to think about it
[24:44] where the brain
[24:54] that's the age we're in now
[25:10] this is the wheat plant
[25:51] and then the fourth part is the grain
[25:56] la palabra the word
[25:58] el tiempo de adoption adoption time
[26:05] we're living in adoption time
[26:21] there must be an approval
[26:50] actually we're living in a very
[26:51] beautiful time
[26:55] we've read these two scriptures
[26:58] we've spoken up to what we said so far
[27:02] you understand amen
[27:22] we've seen how jesus god was take jesus
[27:25] took uh was taken by god up to a great
[27:27] high mountain
[27:30] and jesus took along with him three
[27:32] disciples
[27:47] when this took place
[27:52] one of three tabernacles to be built
[27:58] that revelation that had been given uh
[29:20] [Music]
[29:35] these greeks said we would see jesus
[29:52] is
[30:01] [Music]
[31:00] when he is glorified
[31:39] [Music]
[32:09] [Music]
[32:16] [Laughter]
[32:25] can you say amen
[32:33] a few codes
[32:54] do
[33:43] the holy spirit seals you in with christ
[33:49] then you become
[33:50] one you become one
[33:57] see you and christ live together
[34:03] in me
[34:18] then that's a sealed unit of the lord
[34:20] god
[34:26] now and then they are vindicated and
[34:29] placed
[34:32] when that takes place
[34:36] they become vindicated sons and
[34:38] daughters of god
[34:41] page 23 24.
[34:44] uh
[35:00] to raise it
[35:06] [Music]
[35:20] but if he was the right son and the son
[35:22] that would obey his father
[35:26] then that son was adopted
[35:41] page 24.
[35:55] elijah
[36:08] and that's what god was doing on
[36:09] non-transfiguration when he took his own
[36:11] son
[36:12] after he had been proven to be the right
[36:14] son see and had stood all temptations he
[36:17] took him up on non-transfiguration and
[36:20] overshadowed him
[36:39] you know in the old testament they took
[36:41] a son dressed him in a nice pretty
[36:43] garment and set him out before the
[36:45] public and they had a ceremony of
[36:47] placing or we call it adopting
[36:57] now by placing a sun in other words the
[36:59] sun was a sun when he was born
[37:14] [Laughter]
[37:23] being born into the family by the holy
[37:25] ghost that's right but then we must be
[37:28] the right kind of children tutored by
[37:30] the right tutor
[37:33] page 25.
[37:46] now when jesus had been obedient jesus
[37:48] to
[37:49] god placed him positionally this is he
[37:52] this is him
[38:03] [Music]
[38:08] [Laughter]
[38:29] now when the member is born by the holy
[38:31] ghost into the family of god and has
[38:33] proven to have these this virtues in him
[38:36] then god can see virtual knowledge
[38:38] temperance patience brotherly kindness
[38:39] and godliness in him then god seals him
[38:42] or places him and there that's when you
[38:45] see the sons and daughters of god amen
[38:52] that's what the pentecostals make their
[38:54] mistake
[38:56] i'd like to call your attention to that
[38:57] tengo tengo this is
[39:12] one thing
[40:07] the prophet says
[40:23] of the family of god
[40:26] and has proven that
[40:29] to have this virtues in him
[40:33] then god can see beautiful virgin
[40:50] so where is faith
[40:58] why didn't he place faith
[41:01] did he forget faith
[41:04] because when he's born
[41:31] is
[41:58] those are god's children
[42:15] when he places the office of sun
[42:18] the sunshine
[42:19] the sun
[42:21] i'll repeat it again
[42:28] it's when god
[42:46] [Music]
