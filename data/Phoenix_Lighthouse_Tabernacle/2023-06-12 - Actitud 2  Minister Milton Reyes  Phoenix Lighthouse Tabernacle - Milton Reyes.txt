let's go yes says [Music] speaking we try to do the best we can hombre Colorado curity is he had sure the o man what is good and what what does the Lord require of thee but to do justify and love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God is cries out into the City and the man of wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who like to continue with the same thought we did last time it's a very simple word it's always in our daily living or act foreign how you face a person is Christian and they have a good attitude the correct moral attitude and the wrong model attitude [Music] last time the right mental attitude towards any promise of God you won't cast out a demon with a bad attitude or your brother 15 extra years of life also the attitudes that we take towards any problem that comes against us how do we feed ourselves during the week how much Instagram Facebook or or Instagram do we feed our spirit is depends which dog you feel the most you see that the black dogs we saw that already [Music] we also saw the attitude that the thief took on the cross thank you hello and Abraham said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen for we are Brethren observation an observation here this is supposedly his nephew but when you come to the Lord we become Brethren um foreign then I will go to the right if the other part to the right hand then I will go to the left alone says oriente is chose him all the planes of Jordan and large journeyed East and they separated themselves from one to the other uh in the message Hebrews chapter 7 57 9 15. but after a while his father died he buried him then he had his nephew then quarrels and arguments came up and then finally took his choice and went down into Sodom that even notice that Abraham didn't fuss with lots he said we are brethren we must not argue is any way you want to if you go east then I'll go west that's the Christian attitude be willing to give the other man the best of the deal always presented to him let him take his choice Abraham for why what Abraham do it he knew that what had what was promised by God that he would inherit the whole thing anyhow um so then attend a college College why should we care okay he brings it down to us it all belongs to us anyways where I stayed here dictionary it does not attack uh that's not attack it's not aggressively it's peaceful docile this is so give the man the best of the choice maybe that's the only thing he'll get everything else is yours one thing that caught my attention this is when we always have a relative ly grew up together [Music] for one reason or another we got separated from our home he lives what was he doing we should reflect that in US how Abraham deals with lot s Genesis 14 14 and then Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them into Dan and he divided him against them and he and his servants by night is the women also and the people the Kings there I'm going to hold on Abraham they're just a little bit he was not a warrior he gathered up with the strange servants with Shabbos and he went against an army can you imagine the attitude how God is with Abraham and the Lord said because the Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous God comes down and the two angels which we know who they are do you think but because he loved Abraham at the time but he was going to do and then some kind of a negotiation Lord what is this what is this 50. 50 righteous what if there's 40. I will not destroy it is there weren't even ten righteous there I mean amen and he said once again I got an ideas see ideas and he said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once shall be found there and he said I will not destroyed for the tense sake I will not destroy them he went back and he argued with me with himself with Abraham and he went back to his place but this caught my attention had made an influence but it was all the contrary was taking Lots 15. curioso I fell in the Curious data here I had about 50 or 60 000 people um if we bring it down to our time it would be hard to see as normally when we travel around the city we use vehicles and we get a faster service but I brought it down to a city which we all know it was like Flagstaff but that size the city of Sodom is the closest I found people-wise in population amen amen we're going to see another incorrect attitude we saw the right attitude a Christian attitude from Abraham foreign where is Abel your brother and he said I do not know am I My Brother's Keeper and the Lord said what have you done the voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground this is three messages uh Cain that Define caino it's like a challenge you're trying to challenge someone against something and resistance something this is reconciliation brother Bernie says the reason why God didn't allow Cain's sacrifice because God had cursed the ground he brought a sacrifice out of the ground bridge in 1954 the end time nothing is now notice there's two coming now out of Genesis let's bring them up then he was cane as soon as he seen God's blessed God blessed Abel he become jealous is that right a religious worshiper becoming jealous what it means to be jealous it's a feeling of being envious or or being angry at someone are we jealous because they gave someone a promotion the jealousy and the marriage jealousy matrimonious how many marriages and then he ends up killing them amen when I have it here foreign [Music] it was a way to communicate back then Houston Texas in Houston it was from Auburn here in Houston Texas it was that man that criticized me so bad that night when the angel when the picture of the angel that the Lord was taken there the wife said and I know brother Branham is sister's boy is sitting in the dead world to die in the chair he said what if it was your son Billy Paul [Music] the boy and his girlfriend [Music] and all you read it in the paper of course you said you only hoped you have is for you to come and hold the meeting and get the people together there was a president yes and they were asking a meeting with with them amen amen Raymond um and Raymond Orchestra and had he had already wrote me several times but you know I had planned after that meeting that I would go hunting trip with Mr McNally and them and then I thought well if I let the kids die they won't put my effort they won't put it my effort forth and then if I thought well if I let them kids die and don't put my effort forth I'll never be able to go hunting again I said all right I'll come in Houston I came over to Houston I had a meeting bottom and of course they never killed him they just gave him life that's what they wanted them to do give them life sentence to get to that um that that sentence they have to be first degree to be in the first degree they have to kill another president in observations [Music] spend the best in attorneys if it's worth it all his money he has to get them out of there singing if they were asking for help them he said an audience with the attorney and again when the Earthly law this is there's no more but there is a higher life comes than anyone else the governor of Texas the president they had killed John F Kennedy he was a governor he was a governor during that time [Music] able to get an appointment with him I'm going to read to you what brother Brandon said when he had this meeting and the message is July party of the gospel 1963-06 30. and I said the first murder that was ever committed in the world was one brother killed another did not take his life foreign no indeed if those were brothers words [Music] I mean my brother George Smith found that young man in 2001 he was still alive Laura Cristiano he wasn't a Christian but because of Christian added to the brother Branham that he was there living amen you once again though are you following me let us look at another attitude and numbers foreign Moses with a number of people of Israel 250 Chiefs of the congregation chosen from the assembly well-known men and they assembled together against Moses and the message standing in the Gap 630-623 Santos he says you are to have let the whole congregation do such and such they're all holy God had commanded Moses to lead the people to the promised land is and they said you have taken taken it upon yourself to do too much you try to make yourself the only one in the whole bunch that has got away attitude [Music] [Music] woman from that region came out and was crying have mercy on me O Lord son of David my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon Israel but he did not answer her a word and his disciples came and begged him saying send her away for she is crying after us and he answered and sent the he answered I was sent only to the last sheep of the House of Israel is but she came and knelt before him saying Lord help me and he answered it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs she said yes Lord yet even the dogs eat all the crumbs that fall from their master's table or attitude humbled more I mean what if he would tell that to any one of us but there was nothing in him anyways the great big church right there he ain't nothing but a Holy Roller he ain't nothing but a Bells if it would have been in our time that would have been our answer is she said it is the scraps from under the children's table please the right attitude that she had foreign they said unto him teacher this woman has been caught in the act of adultery says commanded us to Stone such women so what do you say senor that they might have some charge to bring against them then Jesus bent down and rolled his finger on the ground and as they continue to ask him saying he stood up and said to them let him without a sin among you cast the first stone throw her first stone at her he says go to the 11. he said neither do I condemn you go and from now on say no more a message now God manifested himself in Christ Jesus to show what he was it was Jesus a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and loving to a prostitute where are thy accusers and she said I have none Lord neither do I accuse you go and sin no more don't raise your hand are we examining ourselves amen Brothers is [Music] foreign he said he's done something that's unforgivable look at everything two years he didn't see what color he was he didn't know what to say [Music] that he'll pay everything they say no thank you I don't want to ever see you here again don't even look for me just go by yourself and by the grace of God here we are amen [Applause] eight this is [Music] and I heard the boys of the Lord is saying whom shall I send and who will go foreign then I said here am I send me God's Vision moved down in them into that Temple he was ready to confess confess it then he was ready to confess what he had but he aren't there nothing right he did it did he fly to the nation then all he could do finally sealed his testimony I'm gonna put some quotes here influences he said well what they're playing now [Music] is Aaron Isaiah here tonight or a hundred that wants to go who wants a cleansing of God in your life you that no don't know Christ as your savior you're invited to the Altar and he's speaking to your heart I'm not very much I think it's the holy itself that does that persuading but if you're here without Christ now remember you will answer at the day of judgment for what you do this night tonight now if you want to come I'm here to pray for you in Christ's name I offer you the opportunity to come and see God another and happily you might find him young people old people middle-aged foreign [Music] church members whoever you are if the fire of the fire of God by the Holy Ghost has been cleansed you in your heart and to the place where you believe every word in the of this Bible then Christ The Living witness in your in your heart then he that rise from the dead and I'm inviting you to the altario come here and let us pray with you believe in all of you is there a one that's Wayward that wants to come okay to something about the baptism of the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit transforms the heart is however every city here picado sin shame the Lord pain has mistakes rejection and loneliness issues addictions what are you struggling with may the Lord bless you [Applause] know Diablo you're not a business foreign persona Cristiano 's attitude by what what is then there comes a spirit 99 of the time nothing advice I don't agree with it but I like his advice it's not rough he's not telling me the whole truth we know God paid the price this will absolutely nothing but you do better see your life your heart dedicated to the word of God for all eternity because we don't want to hear that what we don't want to hear is something simple that we're Sinners we are all sinners all fallen short of the grace of God and what brought everything to a climate the way I understand in other words he must be born again lift up if I'm not born again when someone has done something against me that's why the new birth is so important yes they're going to talk about you they're going to use that keeps you positive noise El pasado it'll be taken care of it so that I tell myself the biggest problem that we are facing today besides the addiction besides the diseases that are going on there's one Spirit are you in a spirit who seems to control us doesn't matter who you are seems to come in and it just stays there is hermana we hit a panic mode we get into a depression that I don't want to do what I have to do I don't want to come to church because I'm so depressed I'm not gonna tell you who you are but you know if you fell into that category he paid the price the question is do you want to get it I was out of town and everybody I came across the spirit and the more I would look at individuals I'd tell myself this is here yes what about the church not a spirit God the US brings tension because that's what's going on today I don't know what the thank God that is the same time and when we go out we preach the very same thing brother Branham continues I want you to listen to this what's going on that every son and every daughter that cometh to God you're going to be trying can you say Amen how many of us have been twice must be tried proven and tested he lets sickness what's anxiety a sickness what other thicknesses are going on foreign he lets diseases come upon you to show the world very simply there's no other way the examinado that you're truly is he's checking all over the place and the world laughs but God's just proving that you're truly is that you're identified but you are identified so I'm gonna say it like this if we allows sickness and if you're not tempted don't lie to me everyone here the Holy Spirit and we cannot do nothing what our topic is and it's the word helping do you go for money no do you go for popularity we leave the church not to be recognized but we go because that's what this church is all about house giving light to the world believe in prayer that's all we have prayer to be taken Ada the way we should when we receive prayer that's one thing we don't do a lot of no matter where we go we should be praying when you call Carlos Carlos and he tells you yeah it's the attitude that you express I don't care where you go me is the caring instead unless you don't want it you don't need prayers I think we all need prayers again everything I want one two three four okay I love the number four yeah I believe in four Messengers those four Messengers bring life Satan has four Messengers so whatever God has there's four angels of death what I'm gonna do okay persona so what I want you to do okay again because I want this brother to come up and when this brother comes up we don't know what he's going through but I know there's pressure we all have pressure that's why he needs spursion like I said I'm going to ask him a question then all he has to do is raise his hand are you under a lot of pressure you're under a lot of stress raise your hands if you're under anxiety no you that are in the audience you have it because the jobs from person to persona persona starts with one Persona and it filters out I'm not saying that he started it it started six thousand years when came had an anxiety attack great he couldn't stop himself we have the key to unlock that door can you say Amen what I want this morning please listen to my words if you are related it's no coincidence his name is Jesus Jesus if you're related to him don't let me know you're not related to him why come up I didn't say that that's our problem we got to listen to this game my word is if you are related come up thank you gracias I understand we're related Christian but that's not what I'm talking about the reason I'm doing this because you're gonna all surround this brother I want you to surround them is either your mother and I'm going to tell you this because what brother Branham said it and the way he said stays together that's why I brought the flowers because the blood foreign [Applause] thank you to have his way this morning I have four angels I want an angel in the north side I want an angel in the South I want an angel thank you why angels why aren't the angels on our brother because they're lifting their wings they're lifting is glorifying glorificando that God that they believe
