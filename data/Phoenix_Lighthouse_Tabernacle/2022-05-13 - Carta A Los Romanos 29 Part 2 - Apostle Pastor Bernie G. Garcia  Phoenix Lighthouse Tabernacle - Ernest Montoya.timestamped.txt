[14:41] [Music]
[15:09] how many of you love god
[15:24] for
[15:38] so open
[15:50] and the judgment day
[16:06] rather
[16:20] eve eve to the serpent and so forth
[16:23] but on that day
[16:26] won't be able to pass back to anybody
[16:29] our very own conscience
[16:31] will be standing right there
[16:34] now this
[17:44] stand before
[18:12] everyone
[18:24] you've done while you've been here on
[18:25] the earth
[18:36] the book of life
[18:50] and the dead were judged out of those
[18:52] things which were written in the books
[18:54] according to their works
[19:00] first of all we see that there are there
[19:02] are books
[19:08] and these books are the sinners books
[19:12] what happens
[19:16] that when a person
[19:18] repents
[19:21] accepts the gospel
[19:49] you are manifested to be a son of god
[19:51] one an eternal god
[19:53] an eternal son of god
[19:57] we see them
[20:00] that there are books open
[20:33] or two or three witnesses
[20:37] written in that book
[20:43] you might try to dodge that
[20:46] but when you do that who concerns him
[20:48] your conscience
[20:51] comes and testifies the same thing
[20:56] and it says i say amen to what that book
[20:57] says
[21:56] he covered it
[22:11] [Music]
[22:24] another book
[22:53] that i'm with you which will be judging
[22:58] now let's see revelation 22.
[23:03] verse 18.
[23:32] unto every man that hears the words of
[23:34] the prophecy of this book if any man
[23:35] shall add unto these things god shall
[23:37] add unto him the plagues are written in
[23:39] this book
[23:51] and if any man shall take away from the
[23:52] words of the book of this prophecy that
[23:54] takes away
[23:55] god shall take away his part out of the
[23:57] book of life
[23:58] beautiful says
[24:00] this locker it feels dislocated
[24:16] look at revelation 20.
[24:22] on verse 15.
[24:27] we've read here from brother brother and
[24:29] this is two books here
[24:33] book and the other one is books
[24:37] and one of them is the book of life
[24:40] 2015.
[24:46] and whosoever was not found written in
[24:48] the book of life was cast into the lake
[24:50] of fire entonces
[24:52] so there's there is a danger
[24:54] for your name
[24:57] to be taken out of the book of life
[25:25] written in the book of life
[25:55] and verse 2
[25:57] chapter 4
[25:58] verse 2 first corinthians
[26:11] moreover it is required in stewards that
[26:13] a man be found faithful
[26:26] but with me it is a very small thing
[26:28] that i should be judged of you or of
[26:30] man's judgment yea i judge not my own
[26:33] self
[26:35] tremendous
[27:17] shut up
[30:03] until the lord comes who will who both
[30:05] will bring to light the hidden things of
[30:07] the dark side will make manifest the
[30:08] councils of the hearts and that shall
[30:10] then shall every man have praise of god
[30:17] there's something there that goes off
[30:18] with something else i'll just leave it
[30:19] there
[30:31] 524
[31:02] we find
[31:16] it was
[31:58] is
[33:06] where do we go when we change house
[33:22] each one of us will change households
[33:25] i don't think about that where do you go
[33:28] where do i go
[33:31] many believe that they're going to the
[33:32] same place
[33:36] says
[33:58] foreign
[34:13] timothy i said 524
[34:16] but the wicked are in a place of waiting
[35:28] someone
[35:42] look at right now look look at luke
[35:45] chapter 16.
[35:49] 16 22 of luke
[35:53] hermano hermano juan alvarado foreign
[36:24] 22.
[36:35] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[36:37] and was carried by the angel unto
[36:38] abraham's bosom the rich man also died
[36:40] and was buried
[36:44] the dagger died and was taken to
[36:46] abraham's bosom
[36:48] and the rich man also died
[36:50] and was buried
[36:52] verse
[37:02] and in hell he lifted up his eyes being
[37:04] in torments and seeing abraham far off
[37:06] and lazarus in his bosom
[37:10] he was in a place of waiting
[37:13] entonces
[37:20] la punta
[37:27] said father abraham have mercy on me and
[37:29] send lazarus that he may dip the tip of
[37:32] his finger in the water and cool my
[37:34] tongue for i am tormented in this flame
[37:36] conformed
[37:38] according to the words
[37:41] he was a so-called believer
[37:44] is that right
[37:46] and he says father abraham
[38:02] he was
[39:11] sentenced to death and there he is
[39:14] [Music]
[39:21] punishment capital punishment
[39:24] he's not yet
[39:39] is
[40:14] should i change subjects
[40:20] continue reading
[40:53] now therefore there is no condemnation
[40:56] for them who are in christ jesus to walk
[40:57] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[41:02] no i with you there is no judgment
[41:17] [Music]
[41:35] matthew 7.
[41:45] you know what they are
[42:01] i'll be picking it up
[42:02] from where steve after matthew 7.
[42:19] not everyone that says unto me lord lord
[42:21] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[42:23] but he that does the will of my father
[42:25] which is inhabited
[42:39] many will say to me in that day lord
[42:42] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[42:44] and in thy name cast out devils and i
[42:46] name that many wonderful things
[42:48] wonderful works
[42:50] i'd like to insert something
[42:55] before going to the radio station this
[42:57] morning
[43:08] i forget the man's name
[44:20] rule
[44:34] no notice
[46:05] i will liken him into a wise man which
[46:07] built the house his house upon a rock it
[46:09] is
[46:18] and the rain descended and the floods
[46:19] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[46:21] that house and it fell knocked for it
[46:22] was founded upon a rock
[46:32] and everyone that hears my these things
[46:34] the mind and does them not shall be
[46:36] likened into a foolish man which built
[46:38] his house upon the sand is
[46:49] and the rain descended and the wood the
[46:51] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[46:53] upon that house and it fell and great
[46:55] was the foul of it
[46:59] now the scriptures that we read
[47:01] in romans
[47:03] chapter two
[47:06] refers to conscience
[47:12] either accusing or defending
[47:17] your very own country is going to accuse
[47:18] you whatever or it's going to defend you
[47:21] no no no is
[47:36] that's
[48:04] amen over there
[48:07] the witnesses will be there against you
[48:10] amen and your own country will say amen
[48:12] yes
[48:14] i didn't stand on my life
[48:20] i went to church just to have a good
[48:21] time i was going over here look for a
[48:23] girlfriend i would get an overview look
[48:24] for a boyfriend
[48:27] to look fine for our social standing
[48:32] i don't really
[48:45] through his word
[48:54] for this morning
[49:19] jesus went unto the mount of olives and
[49:22] early in the morning he came again into
[49:24] the temple
[49:25] and all the people came unto him and he
[49:27] sat down and taught them entonces
[49:48] a woman taken in adultery and when they
[49:50] had said her in the midst they said unto
[49:52] him master this woman was taking
[49:53] adultery in the very act now moses and
[49:56] the law commanded us that such should be
[49:59] such should be stoned but what says
[50:12] this they said tempting him
[50:14] and they
[50:16] that they might have to accuse him but
[50:18] jesus took down with his finger wrote on
[50:20] the ground as though he heard the knot
[50:36] so when they continued asking him he
[50:37] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[50:40] that is without sin among you let him
[50:42] cast first cast a stone at her
[50:49] and again he stood down and wrote on the
[50:51] ground hole
[51:07] heard it being convicted by their own
[51:08] conscience went out one by one beginning
[51:11] at the eldest even unto the last and
[51:14] jesus was left alone and the woman
[51:15] standing in the midst
[51:18] the greek says
[51:26] [Music]
[52:00] in the day when god shall judge the
[52:02] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[52:04] to my gospel
[52:12] christ
[52:15] then he starts writing on the ground
[52:21] he accuses woman of adultery
[52:26] but there are many more things other
[52:28] than adultery
[52:45] [Music]
[53:34] [Music]
[53:40] none of them
[54:49] right
[55:37] [Music]
