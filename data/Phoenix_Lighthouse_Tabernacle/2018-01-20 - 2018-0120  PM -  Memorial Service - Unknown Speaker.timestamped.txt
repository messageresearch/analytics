[59:12] god bless you
[59:14] hi my name is Elizabeth guy goes for
[59:19] those that don't know me and I've known
[59:25] Alexis for over 35 years she was my best
[59:30] friend
[59:30] when we were young I have nothing but
[59:38] beautiful memories of her being young 11
[59:42] years old going to her house my sister
[59:47] Ellie at night her mom making tacos and
[59:50] rice us jumping in the pool first time I
[59:55] ever went to a theater was with them we
[59:58] watched her pee goes bananas I
[1:00:04] I admired Alexis a lot because she was
[1:00:09] she was a rebel even at that young age I
[1:00:12] remember admiring her so much because
[1:00:15] she would stand up to anybody she would
[1:00:18] say what was in her mind and me being
[1:00:23] from a small town coming to a big city
[1:00:26] and having very strict parents I
[1:00:33] couldn't dared defy my parents or fight
[1:00:37] the way she did I remember singing in
[1:00:44] the choir with her I remember when we
[1:00:47] were like 11 and 12 we would sing
[1:00:49] specials in church at the Fillmore
[1:00:51] Church and beanie and Nina and Becky
[1:00:54] we'd all hang out together and going to
[1:01:00] the Phoenix Tabernacle Day school being
[1:01:04] in the seventh grade and brother Montoya
[1:01:07] was our teacher
[1:01:10] that memory just came to me whoa and we
[1:01:17] were rebels we well I started being a
[1:01:20] rebel hanging out with her we used to
[1:01:23] play softball it was it was fun times
[1:01:27] fun childhood being in church all the
[1:01:29] time and then you know I remember very
[1:01:34] clearly being in seventh grade and we I
[1:01:39] used to go to Greenfield she used to go
[1:01:41] to Kennedy and we would meet each other
[1:01:44] during recess and lunch hour and the
[1:01:46] schools were separated by a chain-link
[1:01:47] fence and I would see her and I'd call
[1:01:51] her over or she would see me and we'd
[1:01:54] meet there and we'd look like convicts
[1:01:55] talking to each other separated by that
[1:01:57] by the chain-link fence the were 14 at
[1:02:01] that time and she's you know were all
[1:02:04] interested in boys at that time and
[1:02:05] talking about him and our troubles and
[1:02:08] everything else but then you know life
[1:02:12] gets ahold of you and you drift apart
[1:02:14] and I would see her sporadically in
[1:02:17] church and I always made it a point to
[1:02:20] talk to her though because I loved her
[1:02:22] she was my best friend
[1:02:24] and I saw her babies growing and her
[1:02:30] having babies us having babies I always
[1:02:33] tried to be there for her when she came
[1:02:35] around I by my actions I hoped but I let
[1:02:41] her know that I loved
[1:02:49] and
[1:02:53] when she had her stroke I went to go see
[1:02:55] her and she was happy and cheerful and
[1:02:57] she didn't look like she had had a
[1:02:59] stroke but um Alexis wherever you are
[1:03:04] till we meet again girl keep up that
[1:03:08] strong tenacious spirit of yours I love

[1:03:32] tonight still how's everybody tonight
[1:03:37] okay not everybody okay we're good

[1:03:43] sister someone who's probably uh make
[1:03:46] you want to fall off the chair
[1:03:48] say I can't believe it but ultimately is
[1:03:51] the power of God God's power is
[1:03:53] transformation sister Liz had also said
[1:03:59] that she was a fighter she was also a
[1:04:03] lover she loved hard she loved her
[1:04:07] family very hard if anybody went against
[1:04:10] her family she'd bring it to you
[1:04:16] you know Holly took to testify to that
[1:04:19] when she said you found out about

[1:04:25] track with you bond and how lethal won't

[1:04:36] homes they stole her leafless bike where
[1:04:38] they want to steal her Leto's bike and

[1:04:45] bunch of gang members you know and these
[1:04:48] guys ran like they were scared like they
[1:04:51] had guns and machetes and stuff like
[1:04:53] that she they caught up to them they

[1:05:22] picture you seen it if anybody ever
[1:05:25] deserved to be a bride it was my sister

[1:05:39] not because I'm handsome and I'm right
[1:05:41] here this is about her some of us are
[1:05:47] sad maybe because you haven't said
[1:05:52] anything we weren't able to but we
[1:05:56] should always remember that if we are
[1:05:58] family if you are extended family
[1:06:01] Kristen we should always think right do
[1:06:04] right say the right things no matter
[1:06:07] what because today isn't is it promise
[1:06:11] tomorrow is not promised I remember my
[1:06:15] sister when I had the privilege when

[1:06:21] privileges I've seen my sister before
[1:06:24] what was my sister

[1:06:35] was telling me uh it's that when it's
[1:06:37] okay to cry Jesus cried that one it's
[1:06:39] okay maybe I was still processing it
[1:06:43] maybe I was ready to start bubbling up
[1:06:46] getting angry and and I started thinking
[1:06:50] I said why was I not told I know she
[1:06:54] called him on to talk to me I know she
[1:06:57] sent her blessings to Lupita and I she
[1:07:00] loved Lupita very much but at that
[1:07:04] moment I I was trying to search my mind
[1:07:09] because I wanted to hear her voice
[1:07:12] and when I saw her I said I can't cry I
[1:07:15] can't cry well when I saw her I started
[1:07:19] to weep and that's what I needed then
[1:07:22] when I went to the car I wanted to hear
[1:07:24] her voice
[1:07:25] I couldn't remember her voice and then
[1:07:30] her voice came to me and I started
[1:07:34] hearing her and it was good thing she
[1:07:37] said to me and I remember who wasn't
[1:07:40] about my weight Stefan you need to slow
[1:07:42] down on tacos

[1:08:21] she would just laugh and say you should
[1:08:24] put his tar and little cups like that
[1:08:26] but she drank it at full full strength
[1:08:28] strength I drank a little bit in I think
[1:08:35] I was raised I would think I was doing
[1:08:36] push-ups not for that but I always

[1:20:11] worked up but one day in 1980 have run
[1:20:15] that time Jacob something happened to me
[1:20:20] something supernatural happened to me
[1:20:22] the word of the God in st. John 3 what
[1:20:25] he says he means you must be born again
[1:20:27] it happened to me here in Phoenix and
[1:20:31] from that time I'm not the same won't be
[1:20:34] and I refuse to be the same I refuse to
[1:20:37] to go back you know what I'm just like
[1:20:39] you guys I'm walking along in Satan says
[1:20:42] look at that girl over there
[1:20:43] but you're 73 shut up devil you know
[1:20:46] I'm still a young guy you know and oh I
[1:20:52] lost some of you your wife is gonna get
[1:20:53] angry at you you better put that cross
[1:20:55] front when you're driving okay put the
[1:20:56] cross where you can keep your eyes on
[1:20:57] Jesus okay but he every day from the top
[1:21:01] when I get up temptation after
[1:21:04] temptation but I go nope
[1:21:05] Jesus said this I don't have time for
[1:21:07] you saying get away from me it's the
[1:21:09] same thing I am locked up in prison in
[1:21:13] this pest house in this prison house and
[1:21:16] I can't help but because you and I have
[1:21:19] these five avenues we see things right
[1:21:21] yeah okay nobody nobody with me we've
[1:21:24] got five senses right we can see and we
[1:21:27] can hear we can smell or we smell that
[1:21:29] marijuana why should smell it too you
[1:21:31] know
[1:21:32] and I loved it when I could put those
[1:21:34] maggots in jail okay right my favorite
[1:21:42] but after a while it got old you know
[1:21:43] what it didn't make no sense you know it
[1:21:46] didn't make no sense because you know
[1:21:47] you do all this paperwork and and it's
[1:21:49] look if they go free that's crazy that's
[1:21:53] crazy you know you shoot a gun with this
[1:21:56] guy with this hand over here and you go
[1:21:58] to hell you're in prison for 20 years
[1:22:00] you shoot the gun with over here you say
[1:22:01] ahh and you're free it's ridiculous you
[1:22:05] know the law that's with the laws but
[1:22:07] God's law is truthful and it's abideth
[1:22:11] forever
[1:22:12] now when I said I came in and I wanted
[1:22:15] to bless you right and I did bless you
[1:22:16] didn't I I blessed it because I believe
[1:22:19] with all my heart that we are Abraham's
[1:22:22] seed now I'm not talking about the two
[1:22:24] seeds I'm not talking about that I am
[1:22:26] saying that I believe I am Abraham's
[1:22:29] seed don't get religious on me okay but
[1:22:32] and I believe that with all my heart and
[1:22:34] I Bank on that so when I bless somebody
[1:22:37] I bless you
[1:22:39] if you receive it god bless you don't
[1:22:42] that's your problem that's okay that's
[1:22:44] okay I'm still walking on Wow
[1:22:49] jesus said in Matthew 5:4 blessed are
[1:22:54] they this is the most preposterous
[1:22:57] message or words that I've ever heard
[1:23:00] from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he
[1:23:03] said blessed are they that mourn for
[1:23:05] they shall be comforted
[1:23:06] please you lost your loved one and you
[1:23:08] and your and your in your over the
[1:23:10] crying is all Lord what can I do but
[1:23:12] blessed are they see you're blessed you
[1:23:15] don't understand you're being blessed
[1:23:17] but you are blessed and the reason you
[1:23:19] know you are blessed is because you're
[1:23:21] not taking the tooth that 38 issued in
[1:23:23] your brain job because everything's gone
[1:23:24] no you know there's a hope you know
[1:23:27] there's a goal for you and the goal is
[1:23:29] Jesus Christ and is to go to that place
[1:23:32] and to not only that but to shine the
[1:23:34] light to other people and tell me Jesus
[1:23:36] is real this is not just a figment of
[1:23:38] your imagination it's not just going to
[1:23:40] church but God is really changes your
[1:23:42] life he is real what is it that change
[1:23:44] is a drug addict like this guy who were
[1:23:46] here after 15 years on whatever it is
[1:23:48] you're garbage jr. but anyway I didn't
[1:23:51] bring him up that way
[1:23:51] but it was God delivered delivered him
[1:23:53] and change him but there are people that
[1:23:56] never change there's people that
[1:23:59] actually lose their mind I don't know
[1:24:01] why you didn't lose your mind maybe you
[1:24:02] didn't lose your mind I lost my mind but
[1:24:06] I lost my mind to Jesus okay now this is
[1:24:11] the bad part I'm gonna go into the bad
[1:24:12] part and I'm gonna go slow okay you want
[1:24:15] to hear the bad part you want to hear
[1:24:17] the good the bad and the ugly okay I
[1:24:20] made a bunch of notes and I told a
[1:24:22] brother Montoya who I talked to I says I
[1:24:24] don't know what to do I don't know what
[1:24:25] to say
[1:24:27] I'm gonna read Ecclesiastes 3 3 1 2
[1:24:32] everything there's a season in to a time
[1:24:34] every purpose under the heaven a time to
[1:24:36] be born in that time to die a time to
[1:24:38] plant a time to pluck up that which is
[1:24:40] planted a time to kill and a time to
[1:24:43] heal a time to break down a time to
[1:24:45] build up a time to weep a time to laugh
[1:24:47] a time to mourn and a time to dance a
[1:24:49] time to cast away stones and a time to
[1:24:51] gather stones together a time to embrace
[1:24:53] and a time to refrain from embracing a
[1:24:56] time to get a time to lose a time to
[1:24:58] keep a time to cast away
[1:25:01] time to Rend it - time to sow a time to
[1:25:03] silence a time to speak a time to love
[1:25:05] and a time to hate a time of war and a
[1:25:07] time of peace that's God's Word that's
[1:25:11] God's anointed word it doesn't make
[1:25:14] sense to you perhaps but that's God's
[1:25:16] Word and it's been fulfilled right
[1:25:18] before your eyes
[1:25:19] this body is dying daily you and I are
[1:25:23] dying I'm not taking you to Genesis were
[1:25:25] where what happened for the great fall

[1:25:31] of us including brother Alex failed you

[1:25:41] said words shape our behavior our ways
[1:25:49] of thinking we said that the word a word

[1:27:24] where they were washing cars and they
[1:27:28] went at it no holds bar the good the bad
[1:27:37] and the ugly brother Alex did not say

[1:28:03] pipe to become a plumber or the
[1:28:07] cigarette or the poodle whatever no they
[1:28:12] didn't teach me that so I told my kids
[1:28:16] Alexis Annie Yvonne whenever small no
[1:28:19] I'll do that no don't do that it's a lot
[1:28:23] but the butter- see no negative this
[1:28:25] negative that negative this she knows
[1:28:28] that you guys know me
[1:28:30] tempered like a buzz saw but Jesus set
[1:28:34] me free
[1:28:34] and Jesus is real I don't care how much
[1:28:38] religion you haven't you how much you're
[1:28:41] not a womanizer how much you're not a
[1:28:44] drinker but if you have never met Jesus
[1:28:47] face to face if you've never experienced
[1:28:51] of being born again then you're in going
[1:28:53] to go where Alexis is that you parents
[1:28:57] right now you Christian parents you need
[1:29:01] to advocate you need to intercede for
[1:29:04] your children your kids your
[1:29:07] grandchildren God loaned them to you to
[1:29:10] see what you were going to do with them
[1:29:12] he gave you your riches she gave you a
[1:29:14] job to see what you're going to do with
[1:29:16] it it's only loan to you your house
[1:29:20] swimming pool your boat whatever it is
[1:29:22] to see what you're going to do with it I
[1:29:25] really going to glorify Jesus Christ for
[1:29:28] that but that's okay do it so that's the
[1:29:34] kind of guy I was but I'm not talking
[1:29:35] about me we're talking about Alexis it's
[1:29:37] all this is all your woven with Alexis
[1:29:39] so they start growing up but you and I
[1:29:43] were actually born with a filter inside
[1:29:46] of our bodies inside of here instead of
[1:29:49] here and we're all this life that that
[1:29:52] God gave you you say no no that's not
[1:29:56] true
[1:29:57] mama and daddy had sex and this happened
[1:30:00] and this happened and I came out there
[1:30:01] was a body yeah okay you go to Genesis
[1:30:05] say you're right
[1:30:05] right you're right but I'm talking about
[1:30:07] God for ordained you predestined you to
[1:30:12] come here to be here in 2018 January
[1:30:15] 20th is it or D that is my place to be
[1:30:17] here so you could hear the words of life
[1:30:20] the words of life that Alexis left she's
[1:30:24] no longer in Hell now if a person lived
[1:30:26] in hell it was Alexis and I saw her a 35
[1:30:29] Avenue I'm going I'm going but that's
[1:30:31] okay that's okay
[1:30:32] 3500 McDowell Emilio and I to go to
[1:30:34] school I'm driving under school and
[1:30:36] she's lying there where they pick up the
[1:30:38] bus the bus got up picks them up Jacob
[1:30:40] and she's there lying lying on the
[1:30:43] sidewalk reading the book I told let me
[1:30:48] do you do drugs that's what's gonna
[1:30:51] happen and when she was there I don't
[1:30:58] know when she stopped doing drugs that's
[1:30:59] what I want to tell you but the effects
[1:31:02] of drug addiction it's a bad thing it
[1:31:06] messes your mind up the central process
[1:31:10] the central processing unit especially
[1:31:13] with a that particular drug the pike
[1:31:15] thing I think I might going the right
[1:31:16] way because I do not because all I did
[1:31:19] was they give you that class in the
[1:31:21] Academy class about marijuana to smell
[1:31:23] it and all that so I never tried it by
[1:31:24] the way and I'm not that hypocrite the
[1:31:26] guy says well I never inhaled it or
[1:31:27] smoked it or whatever
[1:31:28] no when I heard where the deputy serves
[1:31:31] here in the Maricopa County that guy
[1:31:33] says long
[1:31:34] you're not telling the truth he says
[1:31:37] they're doing here what are they call it
[1:31:39] when they do these there are there in
[1:31:41] two but the polygraph got it yes
[1:31:43] everybody's done where one and at one
[1:31:45] time another this guy has never done it
[1:31:49] my mama and papa told me not to smoke
[1:31:52] that stuff because I don't even I don't
[1:31:54] even feel I didn't even know what
[1:31:55] marijuana was anyway the merits not my
[1:31:58] subject I likes the sound okay
[1:31:59] what am I talking about you know I I I
[1:32:01] feel sorry for you guys okay but you got
[1:32:04] a built-in Fichter filter that filter
[1:32:07] that you have inside of you it
[1:32:10] distinguishes you from an animal life
[1:32:12] you're not an animal by the way yes yes
[1:32:15] you could be classified in the animal
[1:32:16] kingdom
[1:32:17] No okay okay those of you that know
[1:32:20] biology okay all the ologies and all the
[1:32:23] garbology okay okay this is not garbage
[1:32:28] this is the Word of God I believe in
[1:32:30] doctors I get I believe that doctors are
[1:32:33] placed here to help mankind people to
[1:32:35] help you and I that built-in filters it
[1:32:41] distinguishes you from animal life and
[1:32:45] if I can say it if I can be so bold I
[1:32:47] want to call it it's my car mica my car
[1:32:52] it's M I ca are it's an acronym I didn't
[1:32:57] come up with it because of my
[1:32:57] intelligence I just came up with it
[1:32:59] because I didn't know how to memorize it
[1:33:01] any other way
[1:33:02] it's your memory your imaginations your
[1:33:05] conscience your affections and your
[1:33:07] reasoning it's a very life that it's
[1:33:10] inside of you it's a real you and it's
[1:33:12] inside of you I can't see but it's
[1:33:14] inside of you okay that inner self moves
[1:33:23] the outside person to see to hear to
[1:33:26] smell to taste or touch did you get it
[1:33:31] okay I want to move on the scripture I'm
[1:33:34] gonna give you the scripture so you can
[1:33:35] check it out is deceiver
[1:33:37] I flipped off but that's okay that's
[1:33:38] another subject altogether okay okay
[1:33:42] first this alone eons 523 st. Paul reads
[1:33:45] reads there any Saint Paul I believe in
[1:33:47] st. Paul how many of you believe in st.
[1:33:48] Paul he wrote 14th epistle is there in
[1:33:51] the New Testament st. Paul the first
[1:33:54] messenger to the church changes in the
[1:33:56] Ephesians church age any and he spoke
[1:33:58] and he said this in to the Thessalonians
[1:34:00] he says you know and the very God of
[1:34:03] peace sanctify you wholly not partially
[1:34:07] but wholly the entire you and I pray God

[1:37:25] after haggling since July
[1:37:28] we went and not didn't pre-plan it we
[1:37:31] just it just worked out that way we went
[1:37:33] on December the 3rd December 3 and there

[1:37:39] three guys so now we go to be chalice
[1:37:43] during challenges 3 it means three
[1:37:46] and that means that basically what the
[1:37:48] insurance means is to cut it's in Latin

[1:38:00] not even with working on HUD homes IIIi
[1:38:03] can't hide Jesus God's Word is all over
[1:38:07] the place if you just look around he's
[1:38:10] all over the place not only is he over
[1:38:12] the place he's standing right behind you
[1:38:14] ready to go inside and abide inside of
[1:38:18] you not just to be all over you but to
[1:38:20] be inside of you you can be baptized
[1:38:23] with the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost
[1:38:26] is to go in and govern you from the
[1:38:29] inside out that's what happened we went
[1:38:33] to taking chances my god is that is that
[1:38:35] for real and that that's happened that
[1:38:37] to happen Estella and I got him and we
[1:38:39] talked a little bit about it in Tucson
[1:38:41] and one of the brother she was going
[1:38:43] crazy because he connected he knew
[1:38:45] exactly what I was talking about and his
[1:38:47] people were saved and he was but he was
[1:38:49] the one who started the fire he started
[1:38:51] to fire because his fire his his candle
[1:38:54] his fire was lit and when that fire is
[1:38:58] lit you become a crazy man
[1:39:00] but that's okay that's okay so would you
[1:39:04] stand now I don't want you to fall
[1:39:06] asleep on me okay I like to dance a
[1:39:10] little bit more if I could for you but
[1:39:13] you know what I'm getting it into that
[1:39:14] age where you get cramps all over the
[1:39:15] place mmm and I love to dance oh but
[1:39:20] that was a dancer I never went to the
[1:39:22] dance hall I did otherwise I never would
[1:39:24] have married my wife Olga because some
[1:39:26] other dancing lady would have snatched
[1:39:32] I never went to those places okay please
[1:39:35] forgive me brothers I am NOT sanctifying
[1:39:38] myself what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:39:41] that the way God leads with you it
[1:39:44] doesn't matter how it leads with you I
[1:39:45] don't care where you're at I don't care
[1:39:48] what you've done where you been
[1:39:52] there's three of you and that God and
[1:39:57] God wants to wholly save you not just
[1:40:00] your body but your spirit in your soul
[1:40:01] he wants to abide in you he gave us his
[1:40:05] only begotten Son Jesus Christ you and I
[1:40:09] are sons and daughters of God by
[1:40:11] adoption but he Jesus Christ the creator
[1:40:16] of heaven and earth the spoken word that
[1:40:19] came and made himself a body and became
[1:40:21] a kinsman redeemer came to redeem
[1:40:24] humanity came to redeem us that's what
[1:40:28] I'm talking about that's what I'm trying
[1:40:29] to say I can't say it in 20-30 minutes
[1:40:31] I'm sorry Lord Jesus we were here Lord
[1:40:35] in memory of Alexis but if we learn here
[1:40:38] Lord that we have a memory inside of us
[1:40:41] and that memory is driven by my car it's
[1:40:46] it's their memory the imaginations and
[1:40:48] the reasoning and the affections and all
[1:40:52] those things that are inside of us but
[1:40:53] you placed those things in us so we
[1:40:55] could work through you so we could work
[1:40:58] for you we're not here by coincidence
[1:41:00] we're here to do a particular job and
[1:41:03] that job is to magnify you to raise you
