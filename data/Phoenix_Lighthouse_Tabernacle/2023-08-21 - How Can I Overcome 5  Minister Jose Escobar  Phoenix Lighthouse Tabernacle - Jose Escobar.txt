in front of you and it's good to see each one of you this evening like the brother said this morning you know we have having some nice weather so we thank God for the cloudy days but we also thank them for the sunny days and so I thank you all for your presence here tonight I know many of you are maybe tired maybe you're sleepy maybe you're hungry you know but just a simple Act of you being here no you're an overcomer because being Overcomer doesn't mean that you don't feel those feelings that even though you feel those feelings but you're still here that's what overcoming is it doesn't mean that you don't fall doesn't mean you don't make mistakes it doesn't mean that you know you don't mess up even it means that even though you mess up even though you make mistakes even though you fall okay I almost still get back up and you're still moving and so we're all Overcomer this evening so it would be so kind of please open up your scriptures we'll be opening up to Revelations 3 uh 21 and 22. 21-22 and this is the scripture we've been using for a part of this thought is and as you find the scripture I'd like to take this time to thank my pastor I mean for the opportunity I know he currently finds himself in Colombia secretary in Colombia I know along with him is our brotherly cell so I know I had the privilege to watch the services last night and the one this morning as well and as usual I can tell the people were blessed so let's go to the scripture and the scripture reads to him that overcometh will I grant to say with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne [Music] let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches can we say we think gave us another day of life no Esther you be with us Lord maybe with me it may be with my interpreter as well may you anoint our lips maybe those who are here and those who are watching us online so I ask all these things amen amen you may take your seats so the topic we've been focusing on for some time now is how can I overcome so that's something that we'll be focusing on tonight but the question is how can I overcome but what I want to focus on is that there has to be a change you know we've spoken before that the best example of an overcomer is our Lord Jesus Christ you know he learned he grew as a person he changed so just as he changed we have to change as well so in order to overcome we have to have a change in our life no there has to be a turning point you know you were going one way you know but now you're going the other way and then how do we change is the question well then we have to have an experience with God you know an encounter with God no we have to make contact with God and why should we make contact with God because everything that comes in contact with God changes everything that comes to contact with God and so we can look to the scripture for many examples is the story of Paul De Pablo you know he was persecuting the church he was on his way to Damascus when he had an encounter with God no with the pillar of fire you know brother Brandon describes no he says that Paul was a church hater he says he was a saint and that sometimes what happens a lot with us right yes you know we think that we're maybe not the right person for the job but then God comes and says I choose you so here I have a quote from brother Brandon when he's talking about Paul no he says now today half the church would deny him God took him down to the road to Damascus Since There came the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel before him and he blinded him and made him fall to the Earth he says he took that man and Paul could say this one time I was a religious Pharisee a Pharisee of the Pharisees I had good intellectual back training but all of my education and all my intellectuals says I had to forget to know Christ and he asked how did you do it Paul he is I was on my road to Damascus to arrest those people and a light shined from the heavens and struck me blind and he says and from that time amen he says from that time he was a changed man you know this is from the message from that time you know the brother Brandon preaches many messages titled like that but this is the one he preached here in Phoenix Arizona in Phoenix Arizona and when you want to talk about change another character in The Bible no it's Moses it's Moises if you want to talk about somebody who was intelligent somebody who was educated it was Moses I'm an intellectual giant um he says he had the wisdom of all the Egyptians to the point where he could teach the teachers so you know how intelligent do you have to be you know the Egyptians considered one of probably the most advanced civilization and he could teach them you know that's something great just Moses was an intellectual giant intellectual says he had all the wisdom of the Egyptians because he could teach their teachers he was intellectual as he could be he says smarter far smarter than most of our brilliant men today because the Egyptians had things that we don't have today okay a body and make it look natural for hundreds and hundreds of years 72 hours is our limited as they put die on clothes that would never fade out yes he said they were way smarter he said you know and Moses could teach them yes but all of his intellectuals he had never met God he took his wife in a little old crooked sticker and he went down to Egypt he says because he had met God you could point back to that time it's our intellectual it's our education no that's the our way of thinking that's stopping us from changing no we want to change our way of thinking doesn't let us change no but just as God did with Moses no he can do with us we have to let him work in our life you know that Abraham was just an ordinary man uh come on no he was not a saint you know and he wasn't from a certain family he was an ordinary man and brother says I'm so glad that we don't have to be born in a certain line or be a great somebody and here's the key he says we just have to be humble and God's grace we'll do the work you know in order to overcome we have to be humble like we've said before it's not us that overcome but it's the word within as that overcomes for us and it's God's grace that does the work but I'm speaking on Abraham um he says God spoke to him and he had a definite experience and it changed his life and he says and the strange thing is when a man meets God he can never be the same well and can always point back to that time when he met him you know he said God spoke to Abraham in Abraham acted differently he said that every time a man meets God from that time you will act different he says if he rejects God he's in infantile right um he says or he will be a Godly sainted person um but he's led by the Holy Spirit he says maybe you're spiritually blind but when you're with God you can see because once again he says you know a man can never be the same person after they meet God and here's something that I found really interesting he says you will either be better person you'll be better off or you'll be worse after you meet God so I found this interesting that's myself how is that possible and so I think on characters in The Bible and one of them is Judas you know brother says he was just a man on the street no but after he met God he became a betrayer and he became a devil so when you meet God you can either be better off or worse off but what matters it depends on what you do with it says so you have to change and so here in this evening you know we're all here you all made the effort to be here something that's really great you know I look and I see our young boys here some of the other young there in the back and I see them you know and I admire them you know because I remember when I was their age no I did not want to be here at church you know I grew up in front of many of you so I can't lie to you you know when I was at a certain age you know Sunday morning I was here for sure Sunday night maybe not he says no Thursday night Thursday night that was less likely but then there has to be a change there came a time in my life where I was always looking forward to church because there was a need inside of me in church was the only place where I felt I can find refuge and so you feel that you know you want to go to church you know like my brother told me earlier you know we don't have we don't have to go to church we get to go to church and that's the difference we realized how blessed we are to have a building like this have a place where we can worship our Lord but that's what it is you know maybe me many of you men who are married you know maybe you can remember when you were maybe dating your wife no you had a date you know were you tired maybe you were tired maybe you were sleeping but that didn't matter we're going to be there no matter what so what about us with church or what about myself you know let's say let's assume you know let's say I have a date no I believe in miracles so let's say so let's say so let's say by the grace of God I have a date you know what am I going to do you know what I said how am I going to show up you know if my car breaks down well then I'm going to get a ride if I can't get a ride then I guess I'm taking the bus but I'm going to be there regardless trying to make sure my shoes are clean me I smell all right you know maybe try to look my best why because I'm showing that I have interest in God come to church it's a special day especially because if I say I love God then I should act accordingly and maybe that maybe that's maybe that's not you maybe you you like church he said you know I like church yeah but what I don't like no it's all those Elders prayers whenever there's altar costs you know the pastor comes up here he says he's going to be here for five minutes and easier for more than that and I understand where you're coming from you know I thought that way too yeah but then there comes a moment in your life when you're depending on that health and you're hoping for that elder sister I came to church he looked at me from the outside you looked at me from the outside and I looked normal normal but deep inside I felt like I was just falling apart I remember deep inside I was crying out to God I hope there's an Elder's prayer that's what I need right now and maybe that's not maybe that's not you he said maybe you don't need prayer no praise God Gloria but what about my brother you know maybe I'm good he says but what about my brother okay you know in order for me him to be my brother I have to feel for my brother you know a message I've been listening to a lot lately you know it's preached by our Apostle he titles their feelings you know he preaches it in Spanish like my brother said he tells sentimentals in espanol you know and somebody recommended that message to me you know they told me there's something in there for you and so I've been listening to it over and over I've been trying to digest it and now I'm trying to put into action you know because what's what's good about knowing all the scriptures you know all the messages if you don't put it into action and that's what we have to do and when we look at our brother the way we look at ourselves and we have to have we start to have the same feelings our Lord Jesus Christ had because in order for us to be brothers but in Spanish it says you know we have to have the feelings of Christ we know we'll have the feelings of Christ when we care for our brothers because the devil knows that when we act like the scripture says then God will manifest themselves through his people you know and when we care for one another that's when God sends his blessings in order to overcome you know we have to seek out that experience to our Lord Jesus Christ the thing is it's our choice you know God Jesus is he's a gentleman he's knocking at the door maybe sometimes we would like him to just bust down that wall and come in but he's a gentleman but from that maybe you still have those little habits but as long as you're making progress that's what matters you know one brother is going 20 miles per hour one brother's going 10 miles per hour what's going two miles per hour it's going really fast what's going really slow but what matters is their most picking progress and they will eventually both get there just we have to do we have to care for one another seek that experience with the Lord Jesus Christ you know I'll be wrapping up here now our Prophet tells us no that nothing that ever comes in contact with God it always changes but on top of that we have to have a point a moment in life that we can always point back and say from that time and we have to think about that no maybe there's somebody here who's maybe never had that experience maybe if you're somebody who doesn't who thinks that there's they don't have that point in their life no to ask God for that experience he's more than willing it doesn't have to be something complicated something simple like our brother said in the morning it's individual as individual you know he can help all of us but it's up to you individuals maybe you're somebody who's already had an experience with God he says God bless you but why not ask him for another one you know we have to have experience an experience with him all the time you know if I've had an experience yeah I gotta look for the next one because I got to get stronger I gotta grow as a Christian I'm gonna grow spiritually because that is and that will help everything else in my life so kind of please stand up yeah once again I appreciate you all for being here tonight God bless you as well kind of please buy your heads once again if you're somebody you know who wants that experience with God you know ask him for it you know he'll give it to you or maybe you want another experience and he will give it to you you know that is what we need we need an encounter with us we need that experience you know it's personal it's personal you have to come in contact with God and once again everything that comes in contact with God whether it be better off or will you be worse it depends on you but God does his part so let us pray dear heavenly father Lord you the creator of the heavens and the Earth creator of all things beautiful well only you are worthy of honor and praise you're the same yesterday today and forever you're the one who gives us life you're the one who provides you're the one that delivers [Music] and Lord today we come before you even understand that we we want to get closer to you we want to do better maybe some of us have made mistakes or we ask that you forgive us if I have had any negative thoughts let us all be better so we thank you for your forgiveness because we're all gathered here tonight Lord we thank you for all things we thank you for the ups and the Downs
