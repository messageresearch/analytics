[40:07] incorporated if Accardo I said no Caputo
[40:08] I haven't seen one of those but I'm sure
[40:10] they've gone let me down okay I better
[40:12] go circus yeah yes now I believe the
[40:15] Bible for your crew cool Aviv here's the
[40:16] blueprint
[40:17] it's a plenum this is history's God's
[40:21] blueprint plan o de Dios this is the
[40:24] plan of God at plan de Dios that he
[40:27] wants to you case you decide to build
[40:29] you and ah what a difficult country of
[40:31] steadier me where the message of the
[40:33] hour comes in on the international hour
[40:36] yes it is the details of the blueprint
[40:39] it's almost a pile of planners if you
[40:42] understand the blue plane is the Kindle
[40:44] plan oh you open it
[40:46] Stella wobbly you look at it the Lumira
[40:48] it's a very great plan it's a plan we
[40:51] grande but on the blueprint perilous
[40:54] plan no saint
[40:55] located throughout the great plan the
[40:58] Palace Hotel is a tour a plan or things
[41:00] that we call detail echo success Yemen
[41:02] that I guess now these details it so
[41:04] that I guests are identified own
[41:06] identity card why symbols for symbol
[41:09] loss sometimes they're circles my
[41:12] sincere kudos sometimes they're square
[41:14] how much this but I don't sometimes a
[41:16] rectangle or triangle o sometimes they
[41:20] have numbers inside of them I'm still in
[41:23] numerous poor then through sometimes I
[41:25] have letters in sideways and relators
[41:27] por dentro sometimes they have letters
[41:29] and numbers inside of those daily
[41:30] leprosy numerous por dentro and each one
[41:33] of those symbol is cada uno the
[41:34] sociologist to bring your attention is
[41:38] para Capel attention to a magnification
[41:41] and a magnification of the exact same
[41:44] will prevail except allah no equal
[41:46] identical it doesn't refer you to a
[41:48] different blueprint don't leave out the
[41:50] plan upstairs no it refers you to the
[41:52] exact bull player ethereal plan wyx octo
[41:56] to me but I mean that's what the message
[41:58] of the hour is a so look as an immense
[42:00] Ark of the Lord it is an interpretation
[42:04] magnifications and among me because I
[42:06] know what's already here they're looking
[42:08] guy sake you can't add to it simply put
[42:11] everything out it can't take away the
[42:13] from away to keep that kombucha you'll
[42:15] be putting up a different kind of
[42:17] building why he got all three official
[42:19] departmental diferente you with me thank
[42:21] amigo but that okay so that's what the
[42:25] message means to me a significant second
[42:27] para me so if we read the Bible sylia
[42:30] malevolent tone says second Corinthians
[42:32] three stress we see that we're written
[42:35] epistles almost purposely that's read of
[42:38] all merely there's a total of zombies

[42:42] street instead pistola in the heart in
[42:45] El Corazon

[42:50] what's written in your heart is one God
[42:54] alone no solamente however you know God
[42:58] has made a way you say to nominator for

[43:17] okay I've met people you're gonna see
[43:19] the same thing who look like Christian
[43:21] Jessamine and como Christian smell like
[43:23] Christian women como Christian act like
[43:26] Christians como Cristianos but what's in
[43:28] their heart they're located okay then su
[43:30] corazón the prophet of God and produce
[43:35] indicated to us no Cindy Co that there
[43:38] is a way to tell I know my disobey and

[44:01] asking them questions about their
[44:04] personal life this will be the person
[44:06] I'll do you not have to do that by
[44:08] getting out a message by illa billah'
[44:12] and coring it is it and Allah you
[44:16] have to know the details in a case a man
[44:19] knows the taiga solamente
[44:21] you have to understand diligent in their
[44:24] what God means look at the austerity see
[44:28] when he says some 122nd releasing that's
[44:31] how you give somebody the word money you

[45:01] the survey because you've studied the
[45:03] blueprint or case to studies to your
[45:05] plateau you've looked at the details
[45:07] then you know the faggiest
[45:08] and you know what to expect the stomach

[54:13] but upper Castilian dedicado
[54:15] he's still with me I want to spend
[54:17] conmigo alright um is this alright
[54:20] brother
[54:21] I'm relaxing now I'm relaxed
[54:24] yeah so the book of Revelation the
[54:27] apocalypse is our book is no externally
[54:30] but it's our book is Western illiberal
[54:32] it's the book that was meant for us
[54:34] before but also because at the time we
[54:36] live for cows in a temple KBB moose what
[54:38] did you realize
[54:39] well something said I'm cuenta that
[54:40] there's a catch ki ye to the book of
[54:43] Revelation live in apocalypsis
[54:45] it's a book of symbols as we leave our
[54:47] symbol loss so it's not given to
[54:50] everybody no no no quality era now I may
[54:54] have read this when I was here before
[54:55] yes the windows to the Cantor because I
[54:57] spend a lot of my time but can you a
[55:00] little more to the mid-tempo
[55:01] re-emphasizing the things that the
[55:04] Prophet said the scan perfect that eco
[55:06] and the reason I do that let us look at
[55:08] your way because I see in the scripture
[55:10] Coveleski Judah that even Jesus himself
[55:13] Azusa mismo had to constantly remind his
[55:16] followers okay metric or nanosecond or a
[55:19] solo tu mas El Camino Ashima what did
[55:22] Christ do on the
[55:24] El Camino mo he spent all of his time su
[55:29] tiempo remind me what is a lower a
[55:33] second no it is about what was Rick
[55:35] locust a mosquito about him I said cut
[55:38] the hell now I know I'm in a believing
[55:44] Church just an English actor take a hint
[55:46] this now if this was a a make believing
[55:51] Church she's old enough for make less
[55:52] amount of factor rather if this was a
[55:54] non believing Church no creator I
[55:57] couldn't preach this I have to preach
[56:00] salvation I have to preach baptism
[56:07] I'd have to preach that new birth Sen to
[56:10] kill moderate hablando but I believe
[56:14] you're believers for your sake I so
[56:16] Craig in this hell so we're setting here
[56:19] thus Maurice de mañana in a certain
[56:23] class not that blessing
[56:25] we're not children no so money knows
[56:28] Paul instructed us Pablo knows construe
[56:31] you in Hebrews in everything else that

[1:35:28] of your people
[1:35:30] that's what empty but here's what the
[1:35:31] Prophet says in due season in the quad
[1:35:35] he says then back out there at the
[1:35:38] beginning I got in their movement pretty
[1:35:40] CPU the beginning of the seven seals
