[16:32] i got the message in about 20 minutes
[16:33] for wednesday night
[16:48] and this is what i found
[16:51] if you open up your bibles to ephesus
[16:53] book of ephesians
[16:56] chapter one and verse four
[17:08] i don't know if it's me or it's hot in
[17:09] here
[17:10] it seems like the temperature's really
[17:12] hot
[17:20] i'm going to ask for mercy one more time
[17:22] and see if they'll place a fan up here
[17:24] get it so we can get a little
[17:25] circulation here
[17:41] amen
[18:10] according as he has chosen us in him
[18:13] before the foundation of the world that
[18:16] we should be holy and without blame
[18:17] before him in love
[18:20] when did he choose us
[18:26] don't
[18:39] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[18:41] christ to himself according to the good
[18:43] pleasure of his will
[18:46] he predestinated us to what
[18:50] i will know how you go i can't hear you
[19:08] jose
[19:48] when he got married
[20:18] do you understand i want
[21:01] not only the living room but also they
[21:02] sold the kitchen
[21:11] goes to the bedroom it seems like a
[21:13] hurricane daniel hit that bedroom
[21:21] all the drinking glasses are no longer
[21:23] in the kitchen they're outside in the in
[21:25] the grass or with friends somewhere
[21:42] that in the natural so you can see it in
[21:44] the spiritual
[21:49] i'll give you a little bit of spiritual
[21:50] so you can understand
[21:59] what is the name of the pastor of
[22:01] phoenix tabernacle
[22:07] what is the name of the pastor of
[22:09] phoenix tabernacle
[23:06] foreign
[23:50] there's a big difference
[23:52] between a child
[23:54] to an adopted son
[23:58] when you're a child
[24:00] have no rights
[24:02] that's why
[24:27] is
[24:57] is
[25:20] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[25:22] wherein he has made us accepted in the
[25:24] beloved
[25:32] in whom we have redemption through his
[25:34] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[25:36] to the riches of his grace
[25:55] having made note unto us the mystery of
[25:57] his will according to his good pleasure
[26:00] which he has purposed in himself
[26:12] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[26:14] of times he might gather together in one
[26:17] all things in christ both which are in
[26:19] heaven and which are on earth even in
[26:22] him
[26:35] of times
[27:04] in the message adoption
[27:10] page 102 in english
[27:18] is
[27:26] bless us now as we approach the word and
[27:28] father that knows the reason that i'm
[27:30] approaching the word from this very
[27:32] scripture here
[27:49] it's because that i feel that you want
[27:51] me to do it this way that it's your
[27:54] divine will
[27:55] it's in your order it's in the order of
[27:57] the day to let the people positionally
[27:59] find their place and be ready for the
[28:01] hour of battle
[28:10] as our brother said in his prayer to you
[28:13] not long ago
[28:14] oh you have trained us so long lord
[28:18] aura
[28:21] now father give us our ranks
[28:35] to what we're supposed to do
[28:38] put us out there to what we're supposed
[28:39] to do so we can be about the father's
[28:42] business for we ask it in in jesus name
[28:44] thy son amen
[28:48] so here he is asking for ranks
[28:51] just give us our rights
[28:55] our title our office
[29:18] and when god places one then oh all the
[29:20] p all the whole church wants to be like
[29:22] that one
[29:43] we are cut out different we're made
[29:45] different we are nature different and we
[29:47] are positionally placed different each
[29:49] one for a different work giza
[29:58] maybe one for just a little kind of a
[30:00] work another for a large work
[30:06] video
[30:14] i believe it was david or one of the
[30:16] prophets i forget now said i would
[30:18] rather be a doormat at the house of the
[30:20] lord than to dwell in the tents with uh
[30:22] wicked
[30:27] but they're in spanish i'd rather be
[30:28] like the carpet
[30:33] is one thing and the carpet is
[30:49] [Music]
[31:35] you can enter a very beautiful clean
[31:37] house it's got carpeting on it you want
[31:39] to enter there without any sand or mud
[31:40] or snow on your shoes
[31:47] forgot to manifest a doormat it's a
[31:48] phoenix tabernacle
[31:54] i'd rather be a doormat in god's house
[31:56] and to dwell on the tens of wickedness
[31:58] can you
[32:25] get ready
[33:00] now it's not just a little thing then
[33:02] it's a mystery god's will is a mystery
[33:06] okay
[33:13] and each man has to seek out the will of
[33:15] god for his or her self god's mystery
[33:20] we have to seek
[34:04] damascus in the light like a pillar of
[34:05] fire
[34:07] and it called him
[34:10] and he went to arabia and was in their
[34:12] dwell three years
[34:16] don't you imagine that that was some
[34:17] time brother
[34:18] pablo
[34:30] renting him a little building somewhere
[34:32] walking up and down the floors
[34:36] all the scrolls
[34:39] they didn't have the new ones
[34:43] i'd like to insert this yeah
[34:55] elderly sisters
[34:57] english sisters i cannot come to the
[34:59] services i don't know if they're here
[35:00] this morning
[35:14] but after so much time i was able
[35:15] permitted by god to go visit them
[35:17] yesterday
[35:20] see i i sense that god had held me back
[35:23] for me
[35:25] because i'm responsible for you

[37:55] [Music]
[38:08] all the old scrolls they didn't have the
[38:10] new ones paul wrote them mostly right in
[38:12] these old scrolls
[38:32] that he would send jesus that through
[38:34] this sacrifice we would all have right
[38:36] to the tree of life
[38:42] those who he called he has already
[38:58] now the whole creation is growing
[38:59] esperanto
[39:02] growing waiting for the manifestation of
[39:03] the sons of god
[39:07] paul had a wonderful time
[39:11] i'd like to have been there with him
[39:30] when was the time that the sons of god
[39:32] was ever to be manifested outside of
[39:33] this time
[39:40] now when were there ever a time in the
[39:43] history those that manifest a time to
[39:45] deliver all nature
[39:53] nature the nature itself is groaning
[39:54] waiting for the time of the
[39:55] manifestation
[40:04] why before the atonement was made before
[40:05] the holy ghost was
[40:07] before all the old testament there
[40:09] couldn't have been manifestation
[40:12] have to wait till this time
[40:35] now all things has been brought coming
[40:37] shaping up to a headstone to a
[40:39] manifestation of sons of god coming back
[40:41] and the spirit of god coming into these
[40:43] men so perfectly until their ministry
[40:45] will be so close to christ till it will
[40:47] join him and his church together
[41:03] is
[41:30] manifestations

[42:32] inheritance when he put my name on the
[42:34] line's book of life before the
[42:35] foundation of the world

[43:39] preach the gospel
[43:44] of eternal life
[43:52] god has sent jesus to make the
[43:53] inheritance real to me because there was
[43:55] nothing i could do to inherit it
[43:59] it was blank it was valid
[44:03] there was nothing i could i can do
[44:20] but in the fullness of time god sent in
[44:22] his own good time jesus a lamb slain

[44:26] blood was shed that it might be go to my
[44:28] inheritance to be what
