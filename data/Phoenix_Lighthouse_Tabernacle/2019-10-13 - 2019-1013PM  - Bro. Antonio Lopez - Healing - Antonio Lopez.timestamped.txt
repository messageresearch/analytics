[42:37] hace las honey that God is what takes
[42:39] care of the Hyun oh-seok a Silas I need
[42:41] that man oh man these are Brendan
[42:45] brother branham's words
[42:46] yes son las palabras de hermano Branum
[42:48] he says y LD say well let me tell you
[42:51] but they can make this illness
[42:53] there's not one speck of medicine ever
[42:56] did cure any sickness existed Lamas
[42:59] minima portion the medicine aquella
[43:00] Corrado algún enfermedades no one doctor
[43:04] no less he's some quack me no I knew
[43:08] goon medico a menos que se algún
[43:09] charlatan but a real doctor will tell
[43:12] you that they do not claim to be healers
[43:14] but on Brad aeromedical lady rock a just
[43:17] Nora Clemens their son odorous and right
[43:19] up over the door where Jimmy
[43:23] m-miss most of a la puerta on the Jimmy
[43:25] Ayo's this is talking about the male
[43:28] aqui aqui esta hablando de la clínica de
[43:31] los de los hermanos me oh my oh he's
[43:35] taught as we know it now is probably the
[43:37] Mayo Clinic though that we hear of today
[43:40] now let's say most case like any cameo
[43:41] cameo toes or emos they became a great
[43:44] big clinic now a grand clinica and so as
[43:49] we continue reading you can Coco Tina
[43:51] Mosley and oh the mayo clinic they they
[43:53] also they
[43:55] they said that they do not profess to be
[43:58] healers like okay you know professors
[44:00] and odorous they only profess to be
[44:04] assistant nature the same case no much
[44:07] professional is that a lot natural esse
[44:09] so they just hope the body you must know
[44:12] Master UNL quirt you put everything in
[44:13] place or guardian to the healing your
[44:15] opponent Austin su lugar para que Dios a
[44:17] gala Sonny that amen amen
[44:19] that's what the the medicines for SOS la
[44:22] medicina so as we continue here a
[44:26] continuous there's two ways we're how
[44:29] healing comes
[44:30] I just wanted Eskimo be any less than he
[44:31] that it comes through divine healing
[44:34] when a poor sunny that Davina or through
[44:36] a miracle
[44:37] Apollo Milagro man then and they do have
[44:41] their differences AC teen ensues
[44:43] diferencia because the miracle
[44:45] / - Emile agro as Jesus did miracles
[44:47] como su so Milagros miracles you can
[44:51] have a cancer here in the body but their
[44:53] cancer and so cuerpo and somebody prays
[44:56] for you and the second later is no
[44:58] longer there it's not in existence again
[45:00] hora por usted lo opossum Segundo you
[45:02] cannot study is there's not much of a
[45:04] process you know in mucho don't process
[45:06] oh man man divine healing is a little
[45:09] bit different Bassanio Davina's Paquito
[45:10] different a divine healing there's a
[45:13] process Purdue man here you see I in
[45:14] process of Palace Ani that at least it's
[45:16] a longer process or soon process of mass
[45:18] Largo
[45:18] man because divine healing its brother
[45:23] branham state man abandoned he said
[45:25] they'll ask me that divine healing it's
[45:28] something it calls the life out of if
[45:30] it's a tumor or cancer whatever the
[45:33] sicknesses it calls the life out of it
[45:35] si la salida de vino' yama la la vida de
[45:37] lo que es around two more say a cancer
[45:39] and as we're gonna get in deeper into
[45:42] them my wasn't our mass our interests
[45:44] don't see
[45:48] but before we go any further by the sky
[45:52] by Ausmus lejos I want to ask what what
[45:55] starts sickness from Turkey in PSL and
[45:59] Fermat that it's uh it's first a spirit
[46:02] Ramirez from a speedo and then it
[46:04] becomes a disease you know assassin and
[46:05] for me that whatever the disease is
[46:07] called carrion from like I said it's a
[46:09] cancer diabetes yes unconscious yes alga
[46:12] Bettis it's first the spirit we made as
[46:14] soon as spirit to and then it it turns
[46:17] into a disease you know what Yaga said
[46:19] wooden vermin that same as we are were
[46:21] first spirits come on hasta supremeness
[46:23] almost espiritu's and then we become

[51:00] causes Calvinists or vara even have to
[51:02] being prayed for this place care or and
[51:04] usted it's a Herrick cs1 dolor de cabeza

[51:39] he breaks it down that for percale Acedo
[51:41] by this man who sandal man and he says
[51:45] he puts an example cancer I see him
[51:49] Rosedale cancer cancer cells
[51:51] la salut as a cancer when you see cancer
[51:54] in the body first ever consider like
[51:56] cuerpo its breast cancer she has cancer
[51:59] they say no when the doctors do their
[52:03] examines their examiner's their images
[52:08] Susan McGinnis they see those cells
[52:11] because it's different from the rest of
[52:13] the body as Vanessa cellulous porque son
[52:15] diferentes de el resto del cuerpo de Ron
[52:17] they don't have the same pattern me
[52:20] small but wrong they don't have this the
[52:23] cells are not the same size as the rest
[52:24] of the body the same as el cuerpo so
[52:29] that's how you know when it's not part

[59:26] context Cinco then he goeth he and
[59:28] taketh with him seven other spirits more
[59:31] wicked than himself and they enter in
[59:34] and dwell it there and the last state of
[59:37] this man is worse than the first even so

[1:00:07] Word of God the mana running se que
[1:00:08] cuando el hombre y no se para fear menos
[1:00:11] then there's no problem
[1:00:12] it wasn't like programa when that spirit
[1:00:15] comes back sp2 regresa
[1:00:17] he won't be able to come in you know

[1:00:40] be faithful that they never fail because
[1:00:42] if we're not just get worse menos a
[1:00:45] vampire
[1:00:46] well the Brennan gives us a perfect
[1:00:48] example here hemp low he talks about
