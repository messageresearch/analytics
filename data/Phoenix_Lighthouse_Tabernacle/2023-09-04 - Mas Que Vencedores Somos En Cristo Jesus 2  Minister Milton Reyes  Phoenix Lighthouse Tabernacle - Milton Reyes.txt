senior [Music] [Music] ities [Music] foreign [Music] senores [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen foreign from 20 to 22 excuse me we can indicate with an amen once you have it is behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and what's up with him and he with me to him that overcome it will I grant to stay with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in history let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches will be jumping into Romans 8 37. name all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us foreign for I persuade that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come out shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord I'll be reading another scripture we're going to Matthew 5 48. be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you may take your seats [Music] in Christ Jesus how can we overcome she recognize the devil in each one of his tricks and strategize each one of its movements how many times do we have to overcome that many times as we're tempted how many times do we have to withstand the amount of times we are tempted daily Brothers reach a point like we said the previous time like the Apostle Paul says no longer either Christ lives and together I'm crucified when I mean I Die daily we're going to see what trials and temptations do for us it's the message reaction to an action slide number eight and when you're put under a test when you're fixing to be used for God for a testimony like the lady here in the wheelchair the man or the little boy some of you people out there maybe your Christian wonder why you're put under this test here the messenger is telling us that God is about to the US to use your testimony [Music] but he wants to see how you will react that's why he allows it allows pressure If you combusters he can't do nothing for you but if you withstand the test then you will overcome so if you withstand the test is God is about to use you maybe remove cancer maybe take away that sickness the headache uh It's the reaction to an action slide number eight nine [Music] but he waits till his own time he wanted to see what kind of reaction they'd have he knew they'd made their stand and when he knows that you make your stand he will let Satan take you to the last mile of the way two things brother God knows that you've taken your position and he allows Satan he'll take you to the last mile of the way him knowing that you already have your position remember he's still there sure you got it he just wanted to see how you're going to react on what you said [Music] then we don't show our true colors you say I believe God I'm sorry I say maybe say oh praise God I believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit Elizabeth your reaction on your action program know he's trying to test you today every son that committed to God must first be chastened tested every child that comes to him he puts him through it to see how he will act as we notice Brothers we have to know our position and how do we realize we're in our position or how do we get to know what our position is that taking our position is to surrender ourselves to let someone have dominion over somebody else on sometimes you want to make things a bit more complicated um the message the unchangeable god of working in an unexpected way you touching me would do no good but touching him what if I can submit myself to him I'm just like this microphone just like this one is this microphone is complete new it's complete Mew until something speaks it's simple right how are we going to surrender just stay calm give us the example of a microphone when somebody speaks through it then the microphone is surrendered what's the first thing you see in our fruits and we have surrendered there comes humility but let's talk about a Christian humility because just famous people who say that they're humble that they have psychologists that they don't get to um I think too highlight themselves because of their money they're humble because they've taken a picture maybe somebody ran across the field and got a picture people say oh what a humble player Manuel is no he's doing an act so that he's he doesn't look bad in front of the people when you surrender to God begins to work in our mind in our body in our hearts in our behavior in our temperament so how often do we have to surrender to surrender daily when we completely surrender ourselves when he starts to overcome through us there's no other way because he is a gentleman like they say at the ranch they twist the head of the chicken and spin around it to kill it he doesn't do that he's a gentleman he waits for us to surrender so that he can overcome through us let's see your reaction why the devil hates Perfection so much we go to the Book of Job we'll be reading six seven and eight this is now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them is doubt then Saints answer the Lord and said from going to and from in the earth and from walking up and down it is and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him on earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God in issue with evil it seems like the devil is the first one who comes so so the messenger says the devil doesn't fear the theologists because he is their father and foreign because our father before being he is our attorney elono to one once again they say is again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord this is another service from it's not the same service as job one this is a different service Royal Lati and the Lord said unto Satan from whence come is thou and Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and from in the earth and from walking up and down in it and he the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him on earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God an issue with Evil aparteth Fast his Integrity although thou moveth me against him to destroy him without cause it seems the devil goes to the heavens as if someone is at his house Simone when God tells the Simon is Simon Simon before Satan has desire to have you that he may save you as wheat but I have prayed for you that I thy faith might fail not interested we've seen in three occasions the devil goes to the heavens he goes and he asks for us and he has all the rights and God allows it is have you not seen my servant who is upright and perfect he says he hit him right in the face have you considered my servant who is perfect in upright man because sometimes people may look perfect but then comes the test then you really get to see what's within them a problem at church now we're going to get to see who is the devil what is it that he does at what moment he was co-equal with God in other words he destroys and is perverse he says that he was one of the ones who guarded the ark it was one of the Guardians we'll be going to Ezekiel 28 14. we'll be reading all the way to 17. and I have said thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God is thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire perfect that was perfect and I wish from the data that was created did you notice something here he was perfect de la till iniquity was found in the is by the multitude of thy merchandise I have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore our Cassidy as profaned out of the Mountain of God in our destroy thee of curvature from the midst of the stones of fire okay was lifted up because of thy Beauty is thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast It To The Ground our lady before Kings we have always been taught that we have to be careful with women dinero with money that sometimes would throw people out of the course but I know it's something here comes how was it that he was cast out of the heavens there there was no money there was no women he made himself higher in his heart was lifted up the Fame got to his head the fame cousin to be cast out of the heavens brother Bernie says something that is very dangerous those are sitting on the benches they have the same value the same as the one who is preaching foreign foreign got to him let us move forward um I would like to read the quote from the law or Grace yes set of cities preached 1954 1006. under the law if the old mother horse had a little cult he was Milton Reyes you can put your name there brother you know in his ears broke down and his knees knocked on what a cross side they say um in horrible looking mules well that meal if he could look at himself dueño intermediate into condition and you have a Birthright and now when the master comes out and sees you in your condition is to go back and get a lamb without blemish and kill it so that crippled up looking mule can live you see the priest never seen the meals he saw the lamb it wasn't whether the mule was perfect it had to be the perfect lamb oh I hope you see it it isn't whether you're good enough to be a Christian or not good enough to be a Christian is whether he was good enough if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God don't see you he sees the lamb I mean Hermanos amen Brothers entonces foreign all over the field have a good time is going to live but one perfect had to die for this is imperfect is it is it that you're William Brandon he says that was me William Branham I can say that was me nothing good not worthy of living fear to God worthy to go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinner absolutely no good at all not one sound party that's right but one day I accepted Hallelujah says The Messengers when God looked down on Christ and Christ took my place then God don't see me he sees the perfect one me Milton who was the mule I was the most horrible do that perfect atonement God sees us he sees you as perfect it's not my perfection I don't have any began to come forth time has gone a bit fast I'll be reading one more quote um it's the power of the devil 55 1005. this is a Ura no no we have not got it in full that's true but we have the earnest of our Salvation what is a guarantee we have the earnest foreigners in Christ Jesus when I do something bad I'm ready to repent anyone else that wants to live right with God you don't desire to do wrong but when Satan upsets you somewhere because there is an atonement waiting for me if I confess my wrong Joseph God's just to forgive it is and the same thing is when you've got you have no idea it's no sign that you're immune from sickness but in every time God is willing to deliver you from that sickness we're not above Temptation we're not above the trial we're not above doing what's wrong we're not above sickness but the key is to completely surrender ourselves to let us pray [Music] father of Glory [Music] thank you for everything you do for us thank you for the trials and temptations [Music] because it shows you on the scene we know that in the end how are we going to sing that song More Than Overcomers that song that we're going to be at that supper all of the redeemed all those that overcame it's you in this overcoming we ask of your help may you help us that's
