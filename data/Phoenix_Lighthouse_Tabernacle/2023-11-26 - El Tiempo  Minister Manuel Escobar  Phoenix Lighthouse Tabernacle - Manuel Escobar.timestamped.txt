[1:28] because we got six SE dead man laying
[1:31] here they're Israelite brothers and
[1:33] they're
[1:41] dead why did they die innocent man
[1:45] because one man stepped out of the
[1:56] line you see the reason this needs to be
[1:59] taught
[2:03] amen the church lining up lining up with
[2:07] the word of God lining up with God
[2:10] lining up with each
[2:18] other walking perfectly upright soberly
[2:22] before all men fearing
[2:28] God
[2:31] because one man stole a garment and done
[2:34] something that he should not done took
[2:36] the life of

[2:58] something wrong
[3:02] God made the
[3:05] promise and something's

[3:18] solemn
[3:19] fast call an
[3:21] assembly something's wrong
[3:28] somewhere
[3:35] God made the promise God's got the sck
[3:37] to that promise and he will do
[3:46] it and he called a fast and they found
[3:49] out the castot and a confessed
[3:56] it and they killed a family and and all
[4:00] and burnt their ashes and left it there
[4:03] for a
[4:09] memorial and Joshua went right on
[4:12] through the battles taking everything
[4:14] without a scratcher
[4:22] wound there you
[4:24] are one day he had need a little time
[4:28] extra time
[4:32] the sun was going down the man couldn't
[4:35] fight very good at night
[4:40] time Joshua that great warrior anointed
[4:44] of God positionally placed into the land
[4:46] like Ephesians to the new church POS
[4:50] possessed the possessing the land taking
[4:52] it
[4:58] over

[5:12] still and she stood still for about 12
[5:17] hours until he took the
[5:22] land
[5:27] see now the book of Ephesians Place us
[5:30] positionally in Christ what they was in
[5:34] the Holy
[5:40] Land we are placed not in the Holy Land
[5:44] but in the Holy
[5:53] Ghost now let us read just the
[5:57] word see how perfect the church
[6:06] is Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[6:11] the will of
[6:15] God oh I like
[6:19] that God made him an
[6:24] apostle no Elders laid hands on him no
[6:26] Bishop sent him anywhere but God called
[6:30] him and made him an
[6:41] apostle Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ

[18:05] now too many
[18:07] Sauls coming from seminaries and
[18:10] Theological schools and going out and
[18:13] teaching this perverse things the Bible
[18:15] said they would
[18:18] [Music]
[18:24] do seemingly not having the Fai
[18:27] separating themselves from you having no
[18:29] fellowship with you so
[18:37] forth having a form of godliness and
[18:40] denying the power thereof from such turn
[18:49] away they don't know where they come
[18:51] from they can't give any
[18:56] reason I say this this from Brother Bo
[18:59] clber a friend of
[19:03] mine if there's anything that's a ill
[19:08] illegitimate unod created anything in
[19:11] the world is a

[19:27] things he is a he don't know what he
[19:34] is he cannot produce himself no
[19:38] more a mule cannot be bred to another
[19:43] mule and become
[19:48] a he's
[19:51] finished he don't know where his papa
[19:53] come from neither does he know his
[19:57] mama

[1:13:10] be in the house of the
[1:13:12] Lord um take your seats for a
[1:13:16] moment uh we had scheduled a guest
[1:13:22] speaker can't hear you we scheduled a
[1:13:26] guest
[1:13:28] speaker uh he calls me last
[1:13:32] night said he couldn't make
[1:13:35] it so I already had my
[1:13:39] message I just didn't have it in
[1:13:43] Spanish but then I saw an individual
[1:13:45] sitting by
[1:13:48] me and uh all of a sudden I looked and I
[1:13:51] said well he's part of our family
[1:13:54] he's preached here
[1:13:56] before a great
[1:13:58] speaker someone that loves the
[1:14:02] Lord and I said uh I hit my
[1:14:08] friend I poked him so he could wake up
[1:14:13] he likes to sing and he
[1:14:15] do created a new world I don't but he
[1:14:19] was into the
[1:14:20] singing I told him tell your dad if
[1:14:24] he'll
[1:14:26] speak in the morning so the person
[1:14:30] that's going to break the bread of life
[1:14:32] for us this
[1:14:34] morning from
[1:14:36] Mexico San
[1:14:39] Pedro
[1:14:40] um a nice place to visit beautiful uh
[1:14:45] it's close to
[1:14:47] everything
[1:14:49] um I as I recall I I stayed around that
[1:14:55] area I went to a
[1:14:58] Dennis um maybe 15 20 minutes away from
[1:15:04] from those
[1:15:06] areas beautiful like I said a beautiful
[1:15:10] place and um I would go to
[1:15:15] Mon and it's not too far from
[1:15:19] monter um but the person I was with the
[1:15:22] person that took
[1:15:24] me I don't know why he never wanted to
[1:15:28] stop and I would tell him well I heard
[1:15:33] Pano own these areas I
[1:15:35] don't this is what I was
[1:15:38] told and he says now we're going to
[1:15:42] Salo so I never did go into San Pedro
[1:15:46] one of these
[1:15:49] days I still have the the ability to
[1:15:52] walk
[1:15:55] so until I
[1:15:56] can
[1:15:59] walk I plan to visit certain
[1:16:02] places ours is
[1:16:04] Sedro with that our speaker part of our
[1:16:11] family brother
[1:16:15] es like I said this brother is
[1:16:19] [Applause]
[1:16:22] a
[1:16:23] if I ever met a man of
[1:16:26] God I've met a lot of men of
[1:16:30] God but here's the type of
[1:16:34] Pastor the
[1:16:37] characteristics of a
[1:16:39] pastor that if somebody wants to be a
[1:16:42] pastor look at the
[1:16:45] characteristics of this individual of
[1:16:47] this brother and I will tell you that's
[1:16:51] what a pastor should look like
[1:16:54] somebody showed me a shirt the other day
[1:16:57] on this shirt it
[1:16:59] had uh this is the way a person ought to
[1:17:05] look long
[1:17:07] hair baggy
[1:17:11] pants and the reason I share this with
[1:17:13] you because there are
[1:17:16] requirements and the
[1:17:18] requirement Number One
[1:17:21] requirement is we are the best we should
[1:17:25] dress the best should act like we're the
[1:17:28] best and here's the best that we have
[1:17:31] God bless
[1:17:37] [Applause]

[1:20:29] morning what we came looking
[1:20:33] for I'd like to invite you to please
[1:20:35] take your Bibles this
[1:20:39] morning we like to take a scripture we
[1:20:41] find in the Book of
[1:20:43] Ecclesiastes it's in chapter
[1:20:49] 3 and it's verse 11 which we will be
[1:20:51] reading
[1:20:55] glory be to
[1:20:58] God do you have it there
[1:21:21] Brothers
[1:21:29] the verse verse 11 reads he had made
[1:21:31] everything beautiful in his time also he
[1:21:34] has set the world in their heart so that
[1:21:35] no man can find the work that God maketh
[1:21:37] from the beginning to the
[1:21:40] end let us please stand to have a small
[1:21:43] prayer this
[1:21:45] morning to place you in the hands of the
[1:21:48] Lord let us bow our
[1:21:51] heads God and good Heavenly Father Lord
[1:21:54] Jesus this
[1:21:56] morning come to stand before th divine
[1:22:00] presence Lord I Thank you for this
[1:22:02] opportunity you grant me L your word has
[1:22:04] been read I cry out for your help
[1:22:08] because I need
[1:22:10] it I'm somebody who needs much of your
[1:22:13] hand of Grace your hand of Mercy bless
[1:22:16] us this morning Lord with your
[1:22:19] word everyone to be attentive to it
[1:22:26] we understand you have more to give us
[1:22:27] than we can ask for Lord I give you
[1:22:32] thanks name of our kind Lord Jesus
[1:22:34] Christ amen amen amen and amen you may
[1:22:38] take your seats you'd be so
[1:22:46] kind this morning I like to speak on a
[1:22:48] topic that I have titled
[1:22:51] time
[1:22:55] and truly it's
[1:23:00] beautiful to listen to prophetic voice
[1:23:02] at this time in this
[1:23:10] age which is he that gives us the the
[1:23:15] foundation that for talk in the
[1:23:20] Bible I believe with all of my heart
[1:23:26] that if God had not sent a prophet to
[1:23:28] this age for
[1:23:34] us we would be
[1:23:41] lost because God sent the voice of God
[1:23:44] for these last
[1:23:47] days and he revealed all things had for
[1:23:51] ages and ages
[1:23:56] but he would like to reveal them to
[1:24:01] us and that's where our joy that's where
[1:24:04] our Delight
[1:24:07] is because
[1:24:10] look because our Prophet told
[1:24:16] us that the Pentecostal
[1:24:19] gospel well without offending anybody
[1:24:24] because I know many people watch Us
[1:24:25] online and
[1:24:29] brother he said the Baptist and the
[1:24:35] Methodist he
[1:24:41] said uh they're they're going wrong
[1:24:43] they're in the wrong
[1:24:45] path oh they're rot in
[1:24:51] food
[1:24:53] and that's what the gospel became
[1:24:54] throughout the
[1:24:56] ages that's why God sent a prophetic
[1:25:00] Messenger to a special
[1:25:04] people in this you
[1:25:06] understand that we were
[1:25:09] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:25:11] the
[1:25:14] world to hear this precious
[1:25:17] gospel it's not to
[1:25:21] boast God determin it in that
[1:25:25] way as he told the Apostle
[1:25:29] John or better yet the Apostle
[1:25:33] Peter when John lied on the Lord's
[1:25:36] bosom and they told him he said what
[1:25:38] about
[1:25:40] him he says oh what about you amen
[1:25:44] amen it's simply his
[1:25:50] grace wej the grace and the mercy
[1:25:55] that is where we can find
[1:26:00] rest look and to go to our topic about
[1:26:10] time we're going to be here putting a
[1:26:12] marriage and divorce paragraph
[1:26:18] 89 in paragraph 89
[1:26:21] reads
[1:26:23] is the
[1:26:29] question the true answer that Jesus
[1:26:31] wants to go back to is to go back to the
[1:26:34] beginning then that would be in
[1:26:38] Genesis because the word Genesis is the
[1:26:41] seed
[1:26:43] chapter to every question in the
[1:26:46] Bible and you always have to go back to
[1:26:50] see to see what kind
[1:26:55] to see what kind of seed is in the
[1:27:01] field to find out what crops will
[1:27:04] be
[1:27:07] now now what kind of seed is
[1:27:10] sown Genesis being the seed
[1:27:13] chapter we'd go back to
[1:27:19] Genesis Jesus introduces us to that
[1:27:21] scripture
[1:27:23] at the
[1:27:24] beginning now
[1:27:29] remember that's when time started to
[1:27:33] begin before that it was
[1:27:39] eternity now our question there was
[1:27:44] notice if we go back to the
[1:27:48] beginning now that's a really marvelous
[1:27:51] scripture
[1:27:54] because Genesis is the book of
[1:28:00] seed so truly in Genesis is where time
[1:28:05] started because from Genesis 1 to
[1:28:08] Genesis there was no
[1:28:10] time it was simply
[1:28:19] eternity but time began when woman was
[1:28:21] deceived
[1:28:24] received and after Genesis 3 and so
[1:28:28] on we see the
[1:28:34] scene how is the woman of she was
[1:28:36] deceived and she didn't get the word of
[1:28:41] God and there when she committed this
[1:28:45] act there began
[1:28:48] time because the Lord had said in
[1:28:50] Genesis 2
[1:28:55] of all the trees in the garden you
[1:28:58] may only not of the one of knowledge and
[1:29:02] science because the day you eat it
[1:29:05] thereof you will surely
[1:29:08] die then when the
[1:29:12] woman
[1:29:15] she she entered into
[1:29:20] transgression then that's where time
[1:29:23] began there that's where time started
[1:29:26] counting
[1:29:30] down because there was no time before
[1:29:32] that it was only
[1:29:37] eternity
[1:29:41] only even though we didn't know it
[1:29:45] before but now when a prophet
[1:29:49] comes he shows us through the scripture
[1:29:54] that God predestined us before the
[1:29:56] foundation of the
[1:29:57] world and that our
[1:30:00] origin is
[1:30:04] eternity so that is our
[1:30:07] origin but we didn't know
[1:30:11] that unless God sent a prophetic
[1:30:15] messenger now going into this
[1:30:19] scripture into this part of the Bible
[1:30:24] I told you on an
[1:30:27] occasion that I blamed Adam because he
[1:30:30] had
[1:30:32] sinned but then a prophet
[1:30:35] came and he gave us the
[1:30:38] Panorama first of all he tells
[1:30:42] us that there was five attributes in
[1:30:47] God that he wanted himself
[1:30:50] display that in him was to be a
[1:30:53] father to him was to be a
[1:30:57] son in him was to be a
[1:31:01] Healer and him was to be a
[1:31:04] savior and in him was
[1:31:09] love but this attributes he himself
[1:31:11] wanted to
[1:31:13] express and to be able to express
[1:31:20] them he had to create he had to create a
[1:31:22] human
[1:31:26] being in this case our father Adam and
[1:31:28] our mother
[1:31:31] Eve who which he placed in the Garden of
[1:31:35] Eden and I'd like to tell you this
[1:31:41] morning they enjoyed in the beginning of
[1:31:47] Eternity praise be the name of the
[1:31:50] Lord
[1:31:53] brother and the beautiful
[1:32:00] thing they spent an eternity or a long
[1:32:02] time while they were in the Garden of
[1:32:04] Eden and since they were
[1:32:09] Eternal they remain in the age of 18 to
[1:32:12] 21 years
[1:32:14] old which that is the Eternal
[1:32:20] age I was talking with a brother in the
[1:32:22] conventions in
[1:32:27] Durango I saw a young man here like
[1:32:31] Jose very goodlooking well he's my
[1:32:41] grandson and I told the young man well
[1:32:43] you look truly
[1:32:47] handsome he said but let me tell you one
[1:32:50] thing
[1:32:52] that I'm also going to be like
[1:32:57] you said just give me a couple more
[1:33:00] days they don't get
[1:33:04] desperate because we're waiting for the
[1:33:06] coming of the
[1:33:08] Lord the scripture say that these bodies
[1:33:10] will be
[1:33:11] transformed and we'll go back once
[1:33:14] again to our original
[1:33:18] state so just a few moments more
[1:33:23] and then we'll see our faces once
[1:33:26] again and he simply just
[1:33:31] smiled I want to tell you because in the
[1:33:33] heart of each human
[1:33:36] being even if you didn't understand this
[1:33:40] gospel within you inside of your heart
[1:33:43] in the deepest of your
[1:33:45] soul you
[1:33:48] know you know you're part of that
[1:33:51] eternal
[1:33:52] being within your
[1:33:54] heart that's
[1:33:56] vibrating there's that
[1:34:00] desire and I want to tell you that the
[1:34:02] desire is
[1:34:04] correct because a prophetic messenger
[1:34:08] came and he revealed this
[1:34:12] Mysteries which had been hidden
[1:34:14] throughout the ages and throughout time
[1:34:17] but
[1:34:19] now they would be revealed
[1:34:23] for which you and
[1:34:26] I we're partakers
[1:34:33] of name be Lord that's why our delight
[1:34:35] and our joy is in our Lord Jesus
[1:34:38] Christ and may the Lord help us this
[1:34:44] morning now to speak on
[1:34:48] time I'd like to take a scure from the
[1:34:52] message glory to
[1:35:04] God you find it in the book I believe
[1:35:06] it's marriage and
[1:35:12] divorce now this quote we have it in the
[1:35:15] book of adoption this is paragraph
[1:35:18] 57 brother bham says the
[1:35:20] following
[1:35:26] now but he wanted to put things in
[1:35:30] time you had to make
[1:35:34] something to
[1:35:38] worship so his attributes produced
[1:35:42] this then he made the
[1:35:44] man then in he looked
[1:35:50] lonesome
[1:35:52] so now to show now his great
[1:35:56] mind and he had the picture of the
[1:35:58] Christ and the
[1:36:01] church praise it be the name of the
[1:36:07] Lord the scripture says that he wanted
[1:36:09] to put things in
[1:36:11] time now we know that God is
[1:36:18] eternal now truly he wanted to put
[1:36:20] things in
[1:36:23] time knowing that
[1:36:28] we we were chosen before the foundation
[1:36:31] of the
[1:36:33] Earth being a part of Eternal
[1:36:38] God he also wanted us to
[1:36:42] use to use the Eternal to
[1:36:47] time praise be the name of the
[1:36:50] Lord
[1:36:52] this was in the great Mind Of
[1:36:54] God glory to
[1:36:56] God that he wanted to place you and I in
[1:37:00] time amen
[1:37:02] amen this is wonderful on behalf of the
[1:37:09] Lord so he tells him that
[1:37:12] way it's not that you or I wanted
[1:37:16] to is because God in his
[1:37:19] grace he determined it so
[1:37:22] and he is perfect amen
[1:37:25] amen be the name of the
[1:37:29] Lord he wanted us for
[1:37:32] us to go to
[1:37:36] time so we can love
[1:37:40] eternity because this is the grace of
[1:37:42] the
[1:37:45] Lord because he knew that you being
[1:37:48] predestinated you weren't going to get
[1:37:50] lost you're not going to get
[1:37:52] lost is be the name of the
[1:37:56] Lord only God wanted to display his
[1:38:01] grace you want to show these five
[1:38:04] attributes for you and
[1:38:07] iise the name of the Lord may he help us
[1:38:10] this
[1:38:13] morning now going into this part of
[1:38:18] time we find that he
[1:38:26] that he came to take together with
[1:38:28] us a life of
[1:38:33] time that's why he appeared 2,000 years
[1:38:38] ago as a man just like you and
[1:38:44] I to also have an
[1:38:47] experience or to be like
[1:38:50] us
[1:38:52] that way he could relate to
[1:38:56] us that's why the Bible says he knows
[1:38:58] our
[1:39:00] condition to be able to understand us
[1:39:05] perfectly that is why he also had to
[1:39:07] enter into
[1:39:10] time but our Prophet
[1:39:14] said but when he
[1:39:17] resurrected he said you can see him once
[1:39:19] again in the pillar
[1:39:22] in the pillar of
[1:39:24] fire because he returned once again to
[1:39:26] his original state and in the book of
[1:39:31] adoption he also wanted to try time
[1:39:34] praise it be the name of the
[1:39:38] Lord God also wanted to go into time
[1:39:40] with us to be able to understand this to
[1:39:44] better understand each one of us
[1:39:49] amen another way it would be
[1:39:56] theology this way he had the experience
[1:39:58] of our
[1:39:59] sufferings just as our
[1:40:03] joy he could understand us
[1:40:06] perfectly glory to the name of the
[1:40:09] Lord may God have mercy on us this
[1:40:13] morning now talking about
[1:40:19] time
[1:40:21] let's see what brother bam says in this
[1:40:22] message of marriage and
[1:40:24] divorce he says there in
[1:40:29] Genesis Jesus called our attention to
[1:40:31] the
[1:40:33] scripture in the beginning now
[1:40:38] remember that's when time started to
[1:40:41] begin before that it was
[1:40:45] eternity now our question there
[1:40:49] was
[1:40:51] notice if we go back to the
[1:40:54] beginning glory to the name of the
[1:40:57] Lord God takes us back to where it began
[1:41:00] where time
[1:41:03] began was there in Genesis that's where
[1:41:05] time there was no
[1:41:08] time but God placed us in a state of
[1:41:10] time
[1:41:12] amen praise and be the name of the
[1:41:18] Lord and in the message marriage and
[1:41:19] divorce the prophet
[1:41:22] paragraph
[1:41:32] 96 now notice that after the beginning
[1:41:34] we also broke the
[1:41:37] line we was the line of
[1:41:41] time and we also the line of life and
[1:41:43] the line of
[1:41:45] time the P was broken everything was in
[1:41:49] ruin now
[1:41:52] what caused all of this he says the
[1:41:54] woman amen
[1:41:56] amen praised be the name of the
[1:42:01] Lord that's where the line of
[1:42:03] continuity the line of life and the line
[1:42:06] of
[1:42:08] time there in Genesis 3 that was all
[1:42:11] broken and that created us to be
[1:42:13] creatures of
[1:42:15] time that is why we find ourselves
[1:42:18] here but we know that our origin
[1:42:23] Eternal together with
[1:42:26] God but he wanted to put us in
[1:42:29] time to him to be able to display his
[1:42:34] attributes as a
[1:42:37] Healer as a
[1:42:43] savior attributes were inside of him and
[1:42:45] he wanted to express
[1:42:48] them so in this way God could Express
[1:42:51] his
[1:42:54] thoughts that's why we came into this
[1:42:55] state of
[1:43:01] time we know that time is ending
[1:43:03] Revelations 10:7 tells
[1:43:07] us at the days of the seventh
[1:43:10] angel these Mysteries would be
[1:43:14] revealed that's why now we can
[1:43:16] understand the plan of God because God
[1:43:18] sent a prophet
[1:43:21] which he revealed all of these
[1:43:24] things were which were hidden to us
[1:43:27] glory to the name of the
[1:43:30] Lord let us continue with our talk this
[1:43:35] morning so we're talking about
[1:43:41] time and we know that currently our time
[1:43:44] ising out glory to the name of the
[1:43:49] Lord
[1:43:54] now brother Brown says in the message
[1:43:55] adoption paragraph
[1:43:59] 57 now he wanted to put things in
[1:44:04] time he had to make something to
[1:44:08] worship so his attributes produced
[1:44:11] this then he made a
[1:44:16] man then this man he looked
[1:44:19] lonesome
[1:44:23] so to now show his great
[1:44:29] mind that he hadn't a picture of Christ
[1:44:31] in the
[1:44:36] church he he did not take a different
[1:44:39] piece of and made a
[1:44:44] woman but he took from the side of Adam
[1:44:47] a
[1:44:48] rib prais be the name of the Lord
[1:44:52] now here the prophet
[1:44:53] God that God wanted to place things in
[1:44:58] time he placed us in a state of time
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:06] amen that's why we find ourselves in
[1:45:08] this current
[1:45:12] condition on occasion I said that I was
[1:45:14] displeased with
[1:45:17] Adam because he's the one that put us in
[1:45:20] this condition
[1:45:22] I said if Adam wouldn't have
[1:45:26] sinned then we would live in
[1:45:30] eternity but when a messenger Prophet
[1:45:33] came and he spoke to
[1:45:36] us about Jesus Christ the the mystery
[1:45:41] revealed he told us that God had this in
[1:45:43] his
[1:45:44] mind because he wanted to
[1:45:47] reveal his
[1:45:49] secrets
[1:45:53] and he wanted to reveal his
[1:45:55] attributes for us amen
[1:46:01] amen that's where we find our rest
[1:46:04] that's where our joy
[1:46:06] is that he himself
[1:46:08] wanted he wanted to display his
[1:46:11] attributes and here we are this
[1:46:14] morning praise it be the name of the
[1:46:19] Lord I hope that the Lord helps me this
[1:46:26] morning I'm going to read from the
[1:46:28] paragraph of marriage and
[1:46:31] divorce 89 brother Brenham
[1:46:39] says now our question that was noticed
[1:46:41] is to
[1:46:42] go which would be in
[1:46:47] Genesis because the word Genesis a dece
[1:46:49] chapter
[1:46:51] pra be the name of the
[1:46:56] Lord for all the question in the
[1:47:01] Bible and you always have to go back
[1:47:07] to to see what kind of seed is in the
[1:47:11] field to find out where your crops will
[1:47:18] be now what kind of scene is was swn in
[1:47:21] Genesis being the seed
[1:47:25] chapter we'd go back to
[1:47:29] Genesis Jus to that
[1:47:32] scripture at the
[1:47:36] beginning now remember that's when time
[1:47:38] started to
[1:47:40] begin before that it was
[1:47:43] eternity now our question there was
[1:47:48] notice if we go back beginning
[1:47:51] Amen in the beginning everything was
[1:47:55] eternity just
[1:47:59] eternity but God wanted to place us in a
[1:48:01] state of
[1:48:03] time that is why we're now in a current
[1:48:05] state of
[1:48:08] time but Revelations 10:7 tells us that
[1:48:11] time is running out it's
[1:48:14] finishing we're at the end of
[1:48:18] time hope the helps us this
[1:48:23] morning because we're in the end
[1:48:30] time and brother we hope that the Lord
[1:48:33] because here we have wonderful things
[1:48:36] that a prophet brought
[1:48:38] us and that's where our anchor is praise

[1:49:05] Woman and he marries
[1:49:08] her because she's just
[1:49:10] pretty there will be an end to
[1:49:15] that but when a man finds a woman that
[1:49:18] he
[1:49:19] loves you don't know why but he loves
[1:49:24] her and she finds a man that she
[1:49:27] loves no matter what he looks like he
[1:49:29] loves
[1:49:30] her she loves
[1:49:34] him that's an eternal made in
[1:49:41] glory they death nor else can ever
[1:49:44] separate

[1:49:49] eternity
[1:49:50] and they stepped
[1:49:53] out in the space of
[1:49:56] time and will return back to Eternity
[1:50:00] isn't this wonderful or it be the name
[1:50:02] of the
[1:50:07] Lord is it how how we had to enter this

[1:56:00] read the scripture of
[1:56:03] Ecclesiastes of of verse 11 in the
[1:56:06] chapter in the third
[1:56:07] chapter the scripture
[1:56:11] says he had made everything beautiful in
[1:56:13] his
[1:56:15] time also he had said the world in their
[1:56:18] heart
[1:56:28] so that no
[1:56:30] man that the work that God maketh from
[1:56:33] the beginning to the
[1:56:36] end that's why we needed a prophetic
[1:56:43] messenger why do we need him so he can
[1:56:44] reveal the things that were
[1:56:46] hidden throughout the ages and time
[1:56:52] but God had him through the seventh

[1:57:18] by because the of the Lord is at
[1:57:23] hand this morning
[1:57:29] brother I'd like to give thanks to God
[1:57:31] for the
[1:57:33] opportunity to be here once again with
[1:57:35] you
[1:57:39] all and rejoice around the word of
[1:57:45] God and see these things that God had
[1:57:47] for ages and time
[1:57:50] but he had them specifically set for a
[1:57:52] people a special
[1:57:55] people through the church
[1:57:59] ages especially for the end
[1:58:06] time well I begin I believe my time is
[1:58:08] running
[1:58:16] out so first I'd like to thank God for
[1:58:19] this
[1:58:28] I believe brother simply there are
[1:58:29] things to
[1:58:34] see but up to this point we thank God
[1:58:36] for
[1:58:39] it for these Ministry that the Lord
[1:58:44] hased allow to see each one of you this
[1:58:47] morning once again this place for which
[1:58:48] we are
[1:58:54] be to have Fellowship around the
[1:58:57] grace may the Lord bless the pastor our
[1:58:59] brother
[1:59:01] Montoya and may the Lord be with each
[1:59:03] one of you God bless you may God keep
[1:59:10] you amen amen amen and
[1:59:18] amen
[1:59:24] stand up for a moment
[1:59:28] please I'm only gonna take an hour I
[1:59:32] won't take more than
[1:59:36] that I believe that
[1:59:39] God formed us for one
[1:59:41] purpose so that we would be here subject
[1:59:45] to time and as we get
[1:59:47] older as we've said said before some of
[1:59:51] us are
[1:59:52] closer to
[1:59:54] 22 than
[1:59:57] 100 we will see the time when this body
[2:00:01] is
[2:00:03] transformed but
[2:00:05] before now that we're in this time
[2:00:08] element I I wish we could stop it if I
[2:00:12] stop time
[2:00:14] today that Dimension that we don't
[2:00:18] see open up you would see your loved
[2:00:23] ones there if you don't
[2:00:29] understand there's a
[2:00:31] hole there is a
[2:00:36] hole and in that hole is a dimension
[2:00:40] that we can't see we can't touch we know
[2:00:44] it's there Einstein talked about
[2:00:48] it
[2:00:50] but we forget we haven't been taught
[2:00:54] correctly to understand that if I was to
[2:00:58] put myself directly into that
[2:01:03] channel bring forth whatever I
[2:01:07] desire because it's in time here there
[2:01:13] for the
[2:01:14] blessings to bring whatever is there
[2:01:17] into my presence
[2:01:23] now take your
[2:01:27] seats it's
[2:01:30] simple life is simple we make it
[2:01:37] hard and the reason we make it
[2:01:44] hard is our Lord Jesus
[2:01:48] Christ
[2:01:50] decided in the
[2:01:52] beginning how you were going to
[2:01:55] act what was going to happen in your
[2:01:58] lifetime how we would
[2:02:01] travel
[2:02:05] Souljers but there had to be a
[2:02:08] time where you and I could
[2:02:12] see what's
[2:02:15] there I don't want to go back I can't go
[2:02:21] back to the Garden I don't want to go
[2:02:25] back to the
[2:02:26] Garden I want to go forward there's
[2:02:30] something special about that
[2:02:34] place where all eternity is
[2:02:37] at that's why brother Brenham said when
[2:02:41] you leave
[2:02:42] here you're going to a better
[2:02:46] place where is that dimension
[2:02:50] where there is no time where he saw
[2:02:56] individuals that he
[2:02:58] converted all
[2:03:03] young there was no time there is no time
[2:03:12] there but I will share with you I got to
[2:03:15] be
[2:03:16] led we got to be led
[2:03:20] you can't lead
[2:03:22] yourself I'll say it again we were never
[2:03:26] meant to lead
[2:03:28] ourselves I start leading myself I get
[2:03:32] into
[2:03:34] trouble and the type of
[2:03:37] troubles that we get
[2:03:47] into we do
[2:03:50] things not
[2:03:52] knowing that they're
[2:03:55] wrong and then he brings something to
[2:03:58] you he brings the attention of what we
[2:04:02] have done wrong in our life he brings it
[2:04:05] to
[2:04:06] us but there's someone else that makes
[2:04:10] it even
[2:04:11] rougher that that puts us down that
[2:04:14] abuses us abuses our thinking abuses
[2:04:22] heart and all he's doing is telling us
[2:04:24] the
[2:04:26] truth but in the
[2:04:28] beginning Before Time
[2:04:31] existed and God was thinking about you
[2:04:35] and I he knew
[2:04:38] exactly where you going to fail he knew
[2:04:41] exactly where I was going to fall knew
[2:04:46] exactly where we would be
[2:04:51] he knew
[2:04:55] everything that's the God we serve but
[2:04:58] he always wanted us to be
[2:05:03] led and I always tell
[2:05:05] myself who leads you wife who leads you
[2:05:12] son daughter who leads you someone has
[2:05:18] to lead
[2:05:19] us and if you tell me the Holy Spirit
[2:05:23] leads
[2:05:25] you I'll say
[2:05:27] Amen but that Holy Spirit needs a vessel
[2:05:33] so you can be
[2:05:35] led a spirit's not gonna come and talk
[2:05:38] to but it's the holy spirit in
[2:05:43] man that has to guide
[2:05:47] you
[2:05:52] I heard brother Brenham
[2:05:56] say a dove doesn't
[2:06:03] bathe he has oil
[2:06:08] inside the oil is inside brother Brenham
[2:06:13] said that goes
[2:06:16] out through its feathers
[2:06:19] and keeps himself
[2:06:23] clean the oil is produced from the
[2:06:28] inside the oil is
[2:06:30] produced from
[2:06:35] here you say
[2:06:39] Amen listen the
[2:06:42] body the body your body produces oil
[2:06:52] but it all depends what's in
[2:06:59] here so we
[2:07:03] know that the days of
[2:07:06] Miracle are still with
[2:07:08] us if you believe in
[2:07:11] miracles and you
[2:07:14] yourself see yourself as a dove
[2:07:20] how many of you are doves I know we
[2:07:22] talked about the
[2:07:25] lamb but we're we
[2:07:28] are a dove that's our nature we just
[2:07:32] don't need anything we don't have a
[2:07:35] spiritual
[2:07:37] G to swallow
[2:07:41] nonsense as the brother said rotten
[2:07:44] food no that's not the word he
[2:07:47] use we don't eat it we stay away from it
[2:07:52] it's dead it's belly it's
[2:07:57] rotten we only
[2:08:01] eat
[2:08:03] pure
[2:08:06] Christian
[2:08:07] food and that's the word of God you say
[2:08:12] Amen so what I want you to do look at
[2:08:14] your
[2:08:15] neighbor I want you to tell your
[2:08:17] neighbor
[2:08:21] the Holy Spirit
[2:08:23] today the Holy Spirit today canot be
[2:08:28] disgraced if it's disgraced it's not in
[2:08:32] us that little
[2:08:34] DB will take its
[2:08:38] flight you say Amen remember it's inside
[2:08:43] the oil is cleansing us from all our
[2:08:47] rotness
[2:08:50] it takes his
[2:08:52] flight how
[2:08:54] far look put the branch
[2:08:59] out there's the
[2:09:02] branch when it left the
[2:09:05] ark you think where did it settle on
[2:09:10] a eat
[2:09:12] that there had to be a
[2:09:15] branch you are that Branch this morning
[2:09:20] and when
[2:09:21] we get away from the word of
[2:09:24] God of the word of God the acting of the
[2:09:28] word of
[2:09:30] God
[2:09:32] disgrace a little dou will take its
[2:09:34] fight he's right
[2:09:36] there right there at the tip of your
[2:09:40] finger right there that close waiting
[2:09:43] for you and I to
[2:09:46] rep and it comes
[2:09:49] back this is God's
[2:09:51] plan this is what God had planned for
[2:09:55] each and every one of us when we were
[2:09:59] in and that's why I
[2:10:03] say when was
[2:10:07] Jesus
[2:10:10] crucified when was he
[2:10:16] crucified let me put it this way because
[2:10:18] I have the
[2:10:20] quote Jesus died before the foundation
[2:10:25] of world he died in God's
[2:10:30] thinking you spiritually died in the of
[2:10:36] God so that a new
[2:10:39] creation
[2:10:41] born can you say Amen a new nature
[2:10:47] creature
[2:10:49] now I want you to stand
[2:10:52] up just gave you a little
[2:10:58] bit this is what I
[2:11:04] believe that we are at the end of time
[2:11:07] everything is is at its
[2:11:09] place rumors of
[2:11:13] wars the way people
[2:11:16] act all
[2:11:20] ified unto
[2:11:24] marriage what makes a real
[2:11:27] Christian is what's in the
[2:11:29] inside and what's in the inside should
[2:11:32] be in the
[2:11:35] inside is what the brother spoke
[2:11:38] about
[2:11:42] love you want to get to that
[2:11:44] Dimension brother Brenham said you
[2:11:46] needed what
[2:11:50] perfect
[2:11:52] love in other
[2:11:55] words I can't stand Eli he thinks he's a
[2:12:05] machine I can't stand that
[2:12:08] character more so when I see
[2:12:11] Dan the guy thinks he has a
[2:12:16] gift he thinks
[2:12:19] that he can
[2:12:21] sing boy when he gets off tune y all
[2:12:25] remember when he got off
[2:12:27] tune
[2:12:31] no some of us do I can't stand
[2:12:35] him that ain't perfect
[2:12:38] love I don't care what he does to
[2:12:42] you what she does to you she says
[2:12:47] perfect love
[2:12:51] is
[2:12:53] closing the mouth when somebody speaks
[2:12:56] evil of
[2:12:59] you something
[2:13:01] simple as not saying a
[2:13:04] word I'm sorry can you take a
[2:13:08] punch all right machine
[2:13:11] H
[2:13:14] now who hit
[2:13:16] you
[2:13:18] you ain't gonna hit
[2:13:20] me I've been punched
[2:13:24] before
[2:13:26] so did you go tell Danny that I punched
[2:13:35] you there it is he tells nobody what
[2:13:40] people
[2:13:41] do he keeps it and he's going to
[2:13:45] pray Lord change his
[2:13:51] heart perfect
[2:13:53] love don't ever hate
[2:13:56] someone because they don't speak with
[2:13:59] you don't ever hate
[2:14:02] someone because they have a little bit
[2:14:04] more than
[2:14:05] you never hate
[2:14:10] someone or despise
[2:14:14] someone because God blesses them more
[2:14:17] than He blesses
[2:14:20] are fulfilling
[2:14:22] scripture the Bible says I Will Bless
[2:14:26] who I want to bless let me say it again
[2:14:29] I will bless who I want to bless and I
[2:14:32] will curse who I want to
[2:14:39] curse so
[2:14:41] remember keep it
[2:14:43] closed love everyone and God will give
[2:14:47] you the the desire of your
[2:14:50] heart why because here it is Jesus was
[2:14:58] whooped and he didn't say a
[2:15:01] thing didn't defend
[2:15:06] himself how many of you have a
[2:15:10] need if you have a need I mean I love
[2:15:14] the
[2:15:16] services I
[2:15:22] rejoiced good
[2:15:25] speakers there was only one
[2:15:30] thing just one
[2:15:32] simple what attracts
[2:15:35] people you know what attracts people no
[2:15:38] matter what you say what you do there's
[2:15:41] only one
[2:15:43] attraction and that attraction
[2:15:46] is when when somebody lays hands on
[2:15:53] you the burden goes
[2:15:57] away when somebody lays their hands
[2:16:01] on lay a hand on you don't you feel
[2:16:06] good you feel relaxed you feel like
[2:16:10] something
[2:16:12] left so you know I'm going to have the
