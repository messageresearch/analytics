[1:06:32] dream an American dream a dream to have
[1:06:36] a
[1:06:39] home a dream to have a
[1:06:42] job a dream where our kids could grow
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:06:47] up a dream for Religious Freedom
[1:06:56] these are
[1:06:57] dreams lately it has become a
[1:07:01] nightmare let me say it again it has
[1:07:04] become a
[1:07:07] nightmare because your rights as
[1:07:11] Christians we forfeited those
[1:07:14] rights to the Lord Jesus
[1:07:18] Christ this last
[1:07:21] election you will need to decide who
[1:07:24] you're going to Forfeit your rights
[1:07:27] too don't tell me don't give me an
[1:07:33] explanation don't tell
[1:07:37] me that
[1:07:41] God is in this because I'm going to tell
[1:07:45] you God is in
[1:07:47] this God chose the correct person to
[1:07:53] destroy this country
[1:07:57] the election has
[1:07:59] proved that the
[1:08:02] dragon has a voice and his voice will be
[1:08:06] heard his voice his
[1:08:10] power will
[1:08:13] destroy and your
[1:08:15] dreams will become a
[1:08:18] nightmare we need to understand that
[1:08:21] we're living in the end
[1:08:24] time brother Brenham said it in
[1:08:28] 1956 America accepts Jesus Christ or
[1:08:34] America will no longer be a democratic
[1:08:40] Nation but will be a
[1:08:47] dictatorship many of you don't know that
[1:08:50] LBJ
[1:08:53] LBJ LBJ
[1:08:58] Johnson said it
[1:09:02] correctly we're entering a new
[1:09:08] era and I cannot
[1:09:11] run for president
[1:09:15] again A year later a year and a half
[1:09:18] later President Johnson the person that
[1:09:21] took over after the assassination of
[1:09:24] Kennedy
[1:09:33] died the person they put
[1:09:36] in as a nomination was
[1:09:41] Humphrey Senator Humphrey humy he
[1:09:46] lost and the reason he lost he had too
[1:09:50] much confidence in his ability
[1:09:55] let me see it
[1:09:57] again he had the correct
[1:10:00] words he had the correct
[1:10:05] platform but he was
[1:10:10] arrogant he believed like Hillary
[1:10:13] Clinton Hillary Clinton that she that he
[1:10:18] no that she and or
[1:10:23] he going back to H
[1:10:27] would win the
[1:10:29] election by popular vote they would win
[1:10:33] the
[1:10:34] election what does that have to do with
[1:10:47] today vice president
[1:10:50] Harris
[1:10:52] Harris relied on her own
[1:10:56] way did you know more
[1:10:59] Hispanics more
[1:11:02] African-Americans good
[1:11:05] percentage
[1:11:06] voted for Donald Trump Donal trp are you
[1:11:10] aware that message Believers
[1:11:14] voted
[1:11:16] for ex or I should say former president
[1:11:19] or president elect Donald
[1:11:23] Trump Donald Trump
[1:11:26] message
[1:11:27] believers they
[1:11:30] posted they posted on their Facebook
[1:11:34] Facebook they were
[1:11:37] caps caps a
[1:11:42] cap this is
[1:11:47] nonsense the last time brother
[1:11:51] Brenham ever voted
[1:12:00] was for
[1:12:07] Nixon was the last time he
[1:12:10] voted and brother Brenham
[1:12:13] said it was a rigged
[1:12:21] election rigged
[1:12:25] the
[1:12:26] [Music]
[1:12:29] machines were all
[1:12:32] rigged people were voting that had
[1:12:35] expired
[1:12:40] years so John F Kennedy won John F
[1:12:47] Kennedy what is that have to do with all
[1:12:50] the rice in
[1:12:52] China because he said it over here
[1:12:57] we see the
[1:12:59] results we're looking at the
[1:13:08] results24 so I want you to stand up now
[1:13:11] just to give you a little bit of thought
[1:13:13] food for thought so that you understand
[1:13:17] why this
[1:13:18] message so that you understand a little
[1:13:22] more this has been bothering me since oh
[1:13:25] prior to
[1:13:30] September if something bothers me then I
[1:13:33] got to research it I got to look at it
[1:13:36] not too long
[1:13:37] ago brother told
[1:13:40] me brother Bernie preached this
[1:13:43] message I was
[1:13:50] there lusting for power
[1:13:56] that's what brother Bernie entitled
[1:13:58] it on a afternoon Sunday
[1:14:04] afternoon never
[1:14:07] clicked it didn't sink into my thoughts
[1:14:12] let alone into my
[1:14:16] heart and that's what happens to us we
[1:14:20] think we have everything figured out we
[1:14:24] think we know this message we have
[1:14:28] become
[1:14:31] parrots we say
[1:14:33] it but it's hard to
[1:14:37] live it's
[1:14:39] hard to do one thing is grasp the
[1:14:44] Revelation that was given to us and give
[1:14:48] it to our
[1:14:50] families we're more entitled to
[1:14:59] ourselves and then years pass our
[1:15:01] families grow we don't know what
[1:15:04] happened I'm going to tell you what
[1:15:07] happened I left you left we
[1:15:12] left Jesus on the Wayside we spoke about
[1:15:17] him we preached about
[1:15:21] him now open your
[1:15:23] Bibles got a lot to
[1:15:26] say so I know you're not going to fall
[1:15:29] asleep
[1:15:32] today Genesis 1
[1:15:39] 1-5 if I was to give this a
[1:15:42] title craving power for a holy
[1:15:51] life in the beginning God created the
[1:15:54] Heaven the
[1:16:00] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:16:04] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:16:07] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:16:10] upon the face of the
[1:16:20] waters and God said let there be light
[1:16:25] and there was
[1:16:29] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:16:32] good and God divided the light from the
[1:16:39] darkness and God called the the light
[1:16:41] day and the Darkness he called night and
[1:16:44] in the evening and the morning were the
[1:16:46] first
[1:16:48] day let's go let's go to Genesis 111
[1:16:57] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:17:00] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:17:03] fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind
[1:17:07] whose seed is in itself upon the the
[1:17:10] Earth and it was
[1:17:22] so Heavenly Father
[1:17:25] we thank you for this
[1:17:30] day enrich in our
[1:17:33] hearts with your
[1:17:35] word anoint us with your

[1:17:46] us protect
[1:17:48] us we know we're
[1:17:51] chosen you chose us before there was
[1:17:54] ever a start
[1:17:57] we were in your
[1:17:58] thinking that's why we're here today
[1:18:01] because you
[1:18:02] thought on each person that is sitting
[1:18:07] here what they would
[1:18:12] wear and what they would believe and
[1:18:16] accept so father in the name of the Lord
[1:18:19] Jesus

[1:18:52] you for allowing me
[1:18:55] thank you for telling
[1:18:56] me that you chose me thank you for
[1:19:00] giving me
[1:19:02] power to live or try to
[1:19:06] live a holy
[1:19:09] life that's what we need today I need to
[1:19:13] understand that in the beginning when he
[1:19:14] said there would be light and it was all
[1:19:18] Darkness it was chaos and let me tell
[1:19:22] you if it was chaos back then
[1:19:25] what about today the chaos that's going
[1:19:28] around
[1:19:30] us we don't know what to believe we
[1:19:33] don't know what to do
[1:19:35] anymore the government I blame this
[1:19:38] person I blame the school I blame the
[1:19:42] churches I got to go back and look to
[1:19:45] see what I'm doing to
[1:19:49] improve these
[1:19:53] entities what have I done
[1:19:56] to improve the church what have I
[1:19:59] done to help my my kids my grand
[1:20:03] kids everything goes
[1:20:06] back to you and I as
[1:20:10] adults because we are
[1:20:12] living in chaos we've been living in
[1:20:17] chaos for years we just never saw
[1:20:22] it we were hypnotized
[1:20:25] and do not see until one
[1:20:29] day God came to the rescue God opened
[1:20:33] your eyes God opened your
[1:20:37] thinking and God said I need some light
[1:20:42] so that my son so that my daughter can
[1:20:45] experience in their heart that I am real
[1:20:50] today it'll produce something in US each
[1:20:55] promise that's written in the
[1:20:58] Bible will manifest itself in you and
[1:21:03] sooner or later that will
[1:21:10] unfold if you're weary or gloomy
[1:21:14] today you feel everyone is against you
[1:21:18] how many of you feel that way let me put
[1:21:20] my
[1:21:21] hand many times I feel
[1:21:25] gloomy I feel
[1:21:32] BL none of you am I the only one I
[1:21:36] better go to the
[1:21:39] altar because every one of
[1:21:42] us sooner or later will go through this
[1:21:47] stage not only
[1:21:49] worrying what's going to happen
[1:21:53] tomorrow now not only
[1:22:02] gloomy I need to
[1:22:05] understand that I have salvation in
[1:22:08] Jesus
[1:22:10] Christ that if I'm gloomy
[1:22:13] we heavy
[1:22:16] laden I can go I can
[1:22:20] run and he will comfort me he will give
[1:22:23] us rest
[1:22:27] that's what we need today I need to
[1:22:30] understand that my mind can only take so
[1:22:34] much and I'm either goingon to
[1:22:38] burst say things I shouldn't say because
[1:22:42] all of a sudden my
[1:22:48] faculties my mind my heart is full
[1:22:53] nobody's telling me
[1:22:55] anything
[1:22:57] positive my parents complain that I'm
[1:23:00] this that and the
[1:23:02] other no one understands what I'm going
[1:23:05] through we forget you and I that we were
[1:23:09] at that age one
[1:23:12] time they're going through the same
[1:23:16] issues the same traumas that you and I
[1:23:19] went through when we were young
[1:23:26] I've said it before and I'm going to say
[1:23:29] it
[1:23:30] again brother Brenham said it let me
[1:23:33] just put it in in
[1:23:35] quotes you speak the word you and I
[1:23:39] speak the word God will perform it that
[1:23:44] settles it I need
[1:23:48] something I got to speak it when I speak
[1:23:52] it I'm saying
[1:23:54] as a thought goes
[1:23:57] out that I want and I need something
[1:24:00] from
[1:24:01] God and what he does not you it's never
[1:24:06] been you it has always been him
[1:24:10] performing what you are thinking what
[1:24:13] you need your
[1:24:16] desire your
[1:24:20] wants all you have to do is remember one
[1:24:23] key word
[1:24:27] speak that's
[1:24:31] it how many of you
[1:24:34] believe that God or the holy spirit is a
[1:24:41] Creator how many of you believe that the
[1:24:44] holy spirit is a
[1:24:45] Creator raise your hands if you believe
[1:24:49] that the holy spirit is a Creator if the
[1:24:51] Holy Spirit creates
[1:24:54] it's a spirit
[1:24:57] creating that Spirit cannot touch
[1:25:00] you it
[1:25:02] cannot say TR and grab your neck or your
[1:25:09] color needs a
[1:25:11] person the Holy Spirit needs a
[1:25:16] vessel and you and I are that vessel you
[1:25:20] and I are those creators
[1:25:24] say Amen if you can't create let me give
[1:25:27] you
[1:25:29] example I'm tired I don't need that from
[1:25:32] you have you ever done that sister what
[1:25:35] are you talking
[1:25:37] about I thought I
[1:25:40] married a sweet
[1:25:44] innocent you're a tiger you're a
[1:25:49] lioness always
[1:25:51] growling you're creating
[1:25:54] you're creating you either create a
[1:25:57] positive living environment or you
[1:26:00] create something that is
[1:26:02] hateful and before you know it somebody
[1:26:05] will be
[1:26:09] anointed and before you know it you go
[1:26:12] to the pastor I just love our
[1:26:18] Apostle our teacher our mentor
[1:26:24] well I didn't select it you
[1:26:31] did we always select a wrong individual
[1:26:36] life that's why we have so many
[1:26:40] problems that is why in the Old
[1:26:43] Testament what they would do is they
[1:26:46] would go out they would send the number
[1:26:50] one
[1:26:52] person to go out and look for a wife for
[1:26:56] a son the same way as a tutor he would
[1:26:59] find the best tutor for his
[1:27:06] son but we forgot about that we forgot
[1:27:11] that there's someone that knows what you
[1:27:15] need but we jumped the
[1:27:17] gun I'm I'm an old
[1:27:20] lady I'm 24 years old and I'm still not
[1:27:23] married
[1:27:26] my mom got married when she
[1:27:29] was I'm just telling
[1:27:33] you we jumped the gun
[1:27:36] prematurely we want to
[1:27:38] do what our
[1:27:41] body will reflect
[1:27:43] on it may be the worst decision you
[1:27:47] make I heard our Apostle say your
[1:27:52] decision today
[1:27:54] marks your destiny let me add to that
[1:27:57] your decision today will affect your
[1:28:02] life you will live with the
[1:28:08] consequences you got
[1:28:10] to
[1:28:14] understand you break the
[1:28:17] law God will forgive you I believe that
[1:28:21] with my heart the law will not forgive
[1:28:26] those are your
[1:28:29] decisions the
[1:28:33] law we'll do one
[1:28:37] thing make you a
[1:28:40] prisoner I have a question right I got
[1:28:44] to go to my questions I got to start my
[1:28:45] message
[1:28:54] question
[1:28:56] one how
[1:28:58] many and it should say how many of us
[1:29:01] want the character of
[1:29:05] God you want the character of God I need
[1:29:08] the character of God to live a holy life
[1:29:12] because the character of God will
[1:29:16] Empower
[1:29:19] me to live a Christian Christlike
[1:29:29] life can you say
[1:29:31] Amen I'm going to go through this
[1:29:33] quickly question
[1:29:36] two let me look I got to check something
[1:29:44] out
[1:29:45] okay how many of us believe Eve wanted a
[1:29:50] relationship with the serpent
[1:29:59] she
[1:30:01] wanted a
[1:30:03] sexual
[1:30:06] relationship what if I was to tell you
[1:30:09] no she
[1:30:12] didn't she didn't want a
[1:30:18] relationship that has been put into your
[1:30:21] mind and that's what you accept
[1:30:26] that's not what the Bible teaches
[1:30:30] me
[1:30:34] lasting she was
[1:30:37] not she was
[1:30:40] craving she
[1:30:42] craved she didn't know that she was
[1:30:46] nuded she didn't
[1:30:50] know those pleasures
[1:30:55] what she wanted what controlled her was
[1:30:59] her
[1:31:00] husband but she wanted a little more
[1:31:04] than what he was
[1:31:07] showing she wanted
[1:31:12] knowledge she wanted power she wanted
[1:31:19] Authority let me say it
[1:31:21] again she didn't know that she she was
[1:31:25] nude didn't know he was
[1:31:28] nude but our Apostle told us she was
[1:31:32] seeking
[1:31:35] knowledge that's what happens to us we
[1:31:38] wer more
[1:31:40] knowledge to be
[1:31:44] recognized we want
[1:31:47] more Power
[1:31:50] Authority so that people can say wow
[1:31:54] this
[1:31:56] person was
[1:31:58] called by
[1:32:03] God with the power and the
[1:32:09] authority so it was NE never that type
[1:32:12] of
[1:32:14] relationship that every
[1:32:16] time well she ate an
[1:32:19] apple I don't know it might have been a
[1:32:22] pear Lowa
[1:32:26] loat
[1:32:28] um
[1:32:31] no a low quat where I come from is
[1:32:36] yellow uh I forgot how to say
[1:32:41] loquat it's
[1:32:43] yellow it has a little seed
[1:32:46] inside and I like to eat them
[1:32:50] green but they're very sweet
[1:32:54] so a low
[1:32:56] quad I don't know uh that's the barrier
[1:33:00] the language barrier that we have that's
[1:33:03] why God had to send an apostle someone
[1:33:07] that spoke your language so that you
[1:33:10] would understand what a low quat
[1:33:13] is that grows all over
[1:33:18] California but
[1:33:21] God by his grace
[1:33:25] gave us an
[1:33:26] individual that
[1:33:28] understood was
[1:33:31] aware of
[1:33:36] campinos workers of the
[1:33:41] field but you ask each and every
[1:33:45] one of your
[1:33:47] neighbors have you ever done this oh not
[1:33:49] me look at my nails
[1:33:54] look at my
[1:33:58] hair we have failed to understand that
[1:34:03] this econ economy that we have
[1:34:06] today was started by
[1:34:09] immigrants let me say it again it was
[1:34:12] started by
[1:34:14] immigrants Farm
[1:34:17] owners or owners of a farm
[1:34:26] didn't do
[1:34:28] anything it
[1:34:30] took a
[1:34:33] foreigner to come into the United
[1:34:35] States and work the
[1:34:39] crops they had in the 50s something
[1:34:41] called the brasero
[1:34:45] act so that immigrants could come
[1:34:48] in and work the
[1:34:51] crops that's why when you go to school
[1:34:55] and you're in the eth grade they gave
[1:34:58] you a
[1:34:59] diploma because they felt you didn't
[1:35:02] need
[1:35:03] education so you only went up to the
[1:35:05] eighth grade and that was the only ones
[1:35:08] that had a privilege to go on were
[1:35:11] people of High
[1:35:16] status now look at
[1:35:19] it we have
[1:35:21] dropouts but at the same time we have
[1:35:23] those said have an
[1:35:27] education those that are
[1:35:32] leaders question three and this is the
[1:35:34] last
[1:35:37] one how many of us are craving to live a
[1:35:41] holy life I want to see your hands if
[1:35:44] you crave just to have a holy life I do
[1:35:48] it every day I gotta be I want to be I
[1:35:51] should be holy
[1:35:56] our
[1:35:57] thoughts should be
[1:35:59] holy I don't know what the saying is my
[1:36:03] thoughts are what louder on
[1:36:08] earth oh thank you my thoughts are
[1:36:12] louder in heaven than on
[1:36:14] Earth so what you
[1:36:19] think you got to re-register
[1:36:27] because the decision like as I
[1:36:30] said in your life will either give you a
[1:36:34] holy
[1:36:35] life or a wicked
[1:36:39] life so I'm going to say it this
[1:36:42] way living in God's
[1:36:45] way living a
[1:36:48] life that
[1:36:49] reflects the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:55] craving for a holy life live the life he
[1:37:01] lived don't try to figure it
[1:37:05] out believe it accept
[1:37:14] it
[1:37:16] definitions Authority this is what it
[1:37:19] means to Ernie
[1:37:21] Montoya power or the right to give
[1:37:23] orders make
[1:37:27] decisions and enforce
[1:37:33] obedience anybody want
[1:37:35] Power let me let me say it this
[1:37:39] way been a lot of people wanting
[1:37:43] power let me see let me name one oh
[1:37:46] President
[1:37:51] elect it's same fluence or command
[1:37:54] thoughts opinions or
[1:38:02] behave
[1:38:04] craving you know I had a craving I
[1:38:06] always have craving I'm
[1:38:09] sorry
[1:38:13] chocolate God I also
[1:38:16] like
[1:38:19] um I like french fries
[1:38:26] in uh other countries they're called
[1:38:33] chips so when people pray forgive my
[1:38:36] thoughts forgive my
[1:38:39] expression when people
[1:38:43] pray it's been known more than
[1:38:48] once that brother Montoya may sneak up
[1:38:51] on your
[1:38:53] I don't know is that true
[1:38:56] Enoch raise your hand if that's
[1:39:00] true you know you stick your hand in
[1:39:03] there
[1:39:04] and pull one out two out before you know
[1:39:08] it you still not done with a prayer and
[1:39:11] you're done with his
[1:39:14] food is that right
[1:39:18] Danny so I have cravings What a craving
[1:39:21] is powerful
[1:39:25] desire a hunger an intense desire for
[1:39:30] something or
[1:39:35] some
[1:39:39] obsessive thinking about something or
[1:39:42] someone or doing something too much or
[1:39:46] all the
[1:39:50] time recognition
[1:39:53] you know the one that sang played the
[1:39:56] piano they're my
[1:40:00] granddaughters every

[1:41:01] friend wake up his
[1:41:03] friend uh would recognize
[1:41:06] people and give him a

[1:43:45] so I ask you what craving do you
[1:43:50] have people say I just can't get rid of
[1:43:53] this
[1:43:55] thought I can't get rid
[1:43:58] of this
[1:44:00] anointing an anointing of
[1:44:03] drugs an anointing of whatever we
[1:44:10] do personal desires
[1:44:14] aspiration you want status how many of
[1:44:17] you want
[1:44:19] status none of you I want the correct St
[1:44:25] is power how many of you want Power got
[1:44:29] I I already have
[1:44:32] it it's how you use that
[1:44:36] Power
[1:44:39] Authority how many of you want
[1:44:41] Authority well I married Eli excuse me
[1:44:46] sister I married Eli I wanted him to be
[1:44:49] a big
[1:44:51] shot I wanted him to have a
[1:44:54] rank the reason I say rank is um we have
[1:44:58] an old saying and this old saying if I
[1:45:02] would have been in the military
[1:45:03] with before finishing boot
[1:45:06] camp they would have made me the
[1:45:12] general it's it's not funny to you but
[1:45:14] it's funny the way it's
[1:45:21] expressed so there's somebody that looks
[1:45:24] for
[1:45:25] rank well I heard one person
[1:45:29] say I am a deacon
[1:45:34] now got power there was a brother one
[1:45:38] time he I won't mention

[1:45:49] too that's what he said I'm like
[1:45:54] right you're not the only one with power
[1:45:57] I got
[1:45:59] power and I say that so that we can wake
[1:46:02] up there two types of power the power
[1:46:06] that God anoints us or the power that
[1:46:09] Satan gives us it's one or the other the
[1:46:14] rank that God gives us or the rank that
[1:46:18] Satan tries to
[1:46:25] recognition we talked about
[1:46:31] it a wife will want her husband to be
[1:46:35] something is
[1:46:38] not just for
[1:46:40] recognition just to say in the Church
[1:46:43] Phoenix
[1:46:44] Lighthouse I do this and I do
[1:46:47] that is number
[1:46:51] Uno so let's go on and read a little bit
[1:46:54] of brother Benham
[1:46:57] my and God could ever get a man in woman
[1:47:01] today in this Tabernacle anywhere
[1:47:06] else that will pay no
[1:47:09] attention to what's going on around
[1:47:14] them but submit themselves to the
[1:47:19] Lord as an individual unit
[1:47:23] God will
[1:47:25] lead the same man
[1:47:28] today that he led
[1:47:31] then he proves that he he proves that

[2:01:48] savior
[2:01:49] America let me tell you America
[2:01:53] 1956

[2:02:31] going to sit with
[2:02:33] Trump I don't know what they're going to
[2:02:35] talk
[2:02:40] about it's not about where Trump came
[2:02:44] from it's about where he's going and
[2:02:48] where he's going to try to take you
[2:02:53] well he's going to protect Christians in
[2:02:56] our school from all these people we
[2:02:59] don't know what they are today they look
[2:03:01] male they look female I don't know they
[2:03:04] want to compete against the women I
[2:03:06] don't know but he's going to protect
[2:03:10] that's why
[2:03:11] Christians voted for Trump
[2:03:22] Trump's
[2:03:23] campaign all the
[2:03:25] events you would have the feeling of
[2:03:27] worship
[2:03:30] service I don't know if you saw any of
[2:03:33] his campaign platform
[2:03:38] where but to some
[2:03:42] Christians it felt like a worship
[2:03:45] service you imagine
[2:03:48] that and then he goes on the former
[2:03:53] president has started a godm made
[2:04:00] Trump what does that have to do with all
