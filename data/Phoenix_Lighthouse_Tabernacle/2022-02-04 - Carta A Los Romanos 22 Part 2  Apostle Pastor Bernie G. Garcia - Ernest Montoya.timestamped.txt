[15:54] we said that the first was a
[15:55] relationship of a son to a father
[15:59] and the other word in english significa
[16:03] means
[16:04] god has divinity
[16:05] deity
[16:19] but the words i got from the message
[16:25] then i can tie them together link them
[16:27] to the scripture
[16:34] and brother
[16:46] that's the first thing that scandalizes
[16:48] shakes the people
[17:02] for
[17:14] what does the word deity or divinity
[17:16] mean
[18:12] is that right
[18:40] to receive
[18:53] i don't know if it was last sunday
[19:06] [Laughter]
[19:17] [Laughter]
[19:21] that is a token for our day
[19:36] and i know that i'm talking to people
[19:37] here people that are studying
[19:41] but sometimes we overlook those small
[19:49] [Laughter]
[19:51] we things already said i've spoken about
[19:53] that first part upon which the
[19:55] foundation is based
[19:59] on study before last
[20:03] that
[20:04] faith is
[20:08] [Laughter]
[20:25] [Music]
[20:36] [Music]
[21:51] [Laughter]
[22:01] [Laughter]
[22:10] but very beautiful
[22:31] [Laughter]
[22:37] of the eternal god
[22:47] [Laughter]
[23:05] that house has to be full
[23:18] is
[23:48] is
[24:15] and you start seeing
[24:29] by his own characteristics
[24:43] to be able to just kind of settle down
[24:46] establish that little part
[24:48] yes i would
[24:50] and then i don't know
[24:58] well
[25:05] [Music]
[25:17] i don't know if you have understood me
[25:18] throughout the years
[25:24] the reason why we read is that you can
[25:26] see that it's the message
[25:28] and then it is scripture
[25:32] so that that way you can stand firm
[25:36] there won't be a devil to move
[25:40] there's a lot of devils
[25:53] how many of you believe you are children
[25:54] of god
[25:58] well i hope a little bit more once again
[26:03] have you believe your children of god
[26:08] joseph
[26:12] [Music]
[26:18] [Music]
[26:50] sometimes they
[27:00] [Laughter]
[27:19] [Music]
[27:32] our
[27:46] i don't know how he missed the entrance
[27:47] but he missed it
[27:52] when he missed it he realized that he
[27:54] wasn't as mature as she thought he was
[27:57] typical
[27:58] and the natural types of spirituals
[28:10] [Music]
[29:04] from adoption
[29:24] has predestinated us unto this
[29:25] inheritance
[29:37] if i'm a right inheritance of something
[29:38] if god is knocking in my heart and
[29:40] saying william branham i called you a
[29:42] long time ago before the foundation of
[29:43] the world to preach the gospel
[29:48] i have an inheritance an inheritance of
[29:50] eternal life
[30:00] now god has sent jesus to make that
[30:02] inheritance real to me because there was
[30:04] nothing i could do to inherit
[30:24] but god in the fullness of time
[30:26] god sent in his own good time jesus the
[30:28] lamb slain from the before the
[30:30] foundation of the world
[30:37] his blood was shared that i might go to
[30:39] my inheritance but i said okay to be
[30:42] what
[30:42] geranzia what inheritance
[31:16] jesus said so
[31:28] you might find that in john 10 34 and 35
[31:45] [Music]
[31:55] dominion over everything
[32:11] ugly kind of looking dog big
[32:29] [Laughter]
[32:39] [Music]
[33:22] did you know that sin caused for the
[33:24] dogs to bite humans
[33:28] but one of these days dogs will not no
[33:30] longer bite your hands
[33:35] to receive a kingdom of peace
[33:41] [Music]
[34:17] he lost his godship
[34:25] there's a part here i don't have a
[34:27] message
[34:30] but there's a scripture that i have
[34:31] mentioned quite a bit
[34:37] [Applause]
[34:38] and this scripture always used to
[34:41] raise up or bring up a lot of questions
[34:42] in me
[34:44] and i'd like to read it so that you can
[34:46] see it
[34:50] even though it doesn't go along with the
[34:52] subject but i'd want you to see it so
[34:53] you can no see it
[34:59] revelations 3 and verse 9.
[35:06] remember that part that i just finished
[35:08] saying a couple of minutes ago
[35:13] they lost their godship
[35:29] adam's body
[35:32] when sin came you know
[35:35] disobedience
[35:38] god removed
[36:23] is
[36:38] is
[37:06] three
[37:31] behold i will make them
[37:33] of the synagogue of satan would say they
[37:36] are jews and are
[37:49] but not i behold i will make them to
[37:52] come and worship before thy feet and to
[37:54] know that i have loved thee
[38:03] it's a scripture that even though i had
[38:04] mentioned it a lot it used to just
[38:06] astonish me
[38:09] but i believe that i now understand that
[38:11] by god's grace
[38:13] look the basement
[38:30] in order to build
[38:35] [Applause]
[39:28] [Music]
[39:53] nothing can come against the house
[39:58] it's placed on the house
[40:02] says
[40:04] i live but no longer do i live
[40:06] in me but christ lives
[40:50] doesn't matter what
[41:04] they'll be
[42:02] [Laughter]
[42:14] even if you don't believe it do you
[42:15] understand okay
[42:17] so let us go back return now
[42:24] he says
[42:26] they were gods
[42:39] he lost his god
[42:59] we are waiting for the manifestations of
[43:01] the sons of god who will come back and
[43:03] take it over again
[43:06] waiting for the fullness of time
[43:21] is

[44:47] and she starts to fall into the clutches
[44:50] of that man

[45:02] is that right
