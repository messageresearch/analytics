[Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Music] m [Music] god bless you this morning uh take your seeds for a moment it is a great sunday morning if you were here last night you received a blessing the young people put on a tremendous service last night the speakers were awesome uh and what i did um prior to them even speaking something was placed in my mind uh trying to get a mystery here and a mystery there the two young men spoke last night we need to remember one thing that he preached god in simplicity it has [Music] so that the word of god you can't have faith without some type of stimulation it will cause a revelation that we need for this time period because the master so that whatever our needs are obtain those needs through a sacrifice through the blood that was shed covers us is let me put emphasis on that that's what makes us special this morning that's what separates us now what i'd like you to do okay kiddo kevin i want you to stand we're gonna pray some questions i think there's simple questions biblical questions this morning we're so happy content knowing that this is such a tremendous day [Music] father raise us up this morning so that we can serve you better father that's my prayer that you helped us this morning place the confidence in the mind of to dwell in our thinking for we pray this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ if i was to give this a title he has risen he has risen how many of you believe that raise your hand if you believe how many of us have risen resources you know we have been taught that once we go into the waters for our justification that it's not easy to baptize a person these you can do everything you want but when you take them down what is he doing so you needed to just relax and as he submerged you in the water you were still kicking people kick they don't want to die when you you have potentially potential which you should be look at once you come up because we have to resurrect thank you it's important it's important if you kick and that leg that arm yes and re-baptized because he he just didn't want to die how many of you want to die oh wow that's different let me say it again how many of us want to die let me say it correctly how many of us want to die spiritually i mean i gotta forfeit whatever is bothering me i heard brother branham say you don't want the holy ghost you don't want the holy ghost you're afraid of it you say it again you don't want the holy ghost you're afraid it's going to change that's going to transfer when will it happen it's between you and your savior between you and your lord it's between and you i need you to remember that word my first question is help me how many of us have lost the joy of our salvation have you lost something the pandemic is taking everything including wanting to come to church so the pandemic has taken it and this was part of the commercial of the tv well he was a newscaster so he has his jacket on somebody says something else he stands up el salvanta i won't tell you no away what he was wearing that's us because of youtube we stay in our pajamas we don't even enter the webpage we gotta have our coffee and then maybe later yeah we can enter that webinar that's the joy that we're let losing say that over here we're losing our joy because we're not at night to see exactly where it goes and the reason i need to make a decision i look into your eyes and the first thing that tells me you don't feel his presence anymore i see people that was delivered is no longer there i was in kabul and i noticed the same thing and i noticed something lacking it's that desire that we once had to serve jesus christ how many of you don't raise your hand raise your heart not only have lost your joy think about it something so simple alcotnio i want to leave that with you oops slide two please how many of us are willing to forfeit all our rights to inherit eternal life they'll be taken away in a small process until those things that had you captive are reduced can you say it man who will stand and give account for you on that day will be there can you say man the last one what is the real seal of god and where is it this resurrection morning there's a seal it's of god i need to know where i know about the horse riders in revelations mana the sill of god has always been here it always knocks okay it's such a gentle man that it won't force itself into you without you allowing it in other words can i go in your house without asking you can i go into your house you're there and i knock on the door what are you gonna say if you don't have that little hole there you all agree on that who's there guinness jesus christ jesus christ will you let him in he knocks at your door well you let him in this morning there has to be a seal there has to be someone to receive that seal yes i say you he's just not gonna come i don't know about my need and say take it you're gonna have to not only ask for it a just want you to relax matthew 28 1. uno in the end of the sabbath 28-2 excuse me five single and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that he seek jesus which was crucified he is not here come see the place here the lord lay no esta porque como digo verse 7 which is where i want to stay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you unto galilee there shall you see him lo i have told you so we have an angel well i disagree with many people please forgive me there's two angels an angel given to the jewish people israel was given to the jewish people for gabriel foreign gabriel spoke to me gabriel may have lost no but they gave him a different name what was his name thank you lucifer lucifer the bible mentions michael lucifer revelations we but michael i believe it has been created that means the flesh will have an end fiend but what is of god the spirit that dwells in us jesus from the dead so whatever is created has a what has a beginning does heaven have an end time pass away not talking about a dimension i am not talking about a dimension i'm talking about heaven heaven is the car's most that's god's word like i said here the angel tells them and it tells them go tell the disciples that jesus galileia well you know if you're from the united states what's today sunday queso domingo what's the special occasion we know 40 you're a man but after 40. there's something wrong with our chemistry and he marked it didn't look at anything i looked at him i said sir can you tell me where i parked my car he stared he was bewildered he looks at me it's my camera looked at my wife like thinking this guy there's something wrong with him he said sir here's the doors you know how you exit costco it's out there yeah so i had to do something in order for him to get off of what he was thinking maybe something happened at home maybe that was his last day maybe it was the last day because he was fired so i had to throw some humor so he could get away from that atmosphere that he created i think we all create an atmosphere it can be love what they said they can be hate they can be it tortured be drugs it could be alcohol it could be women it could be whatever it is but it's attracting it's doing something to your mind that sometimes i wake up i tell my [Music] so then i tell myself i go into the mirror i do this i watch them well you know these this used to be really firm stanley and freemasons but they're not sagging have you ever gone up there you look at and said i'm strong then what is it scratch my head and i say i become very lazy don't want to do what i need to do as you said last week as you said last week i don't want to face responsibility leave me alone i want to do what i want to do i want to relax i'll relax if i want to do this i'll do that if i don't want to get up i'm not going to want it's not that you're getting old it's not that you're weak we don't want to feel we do not want to participate things how many of you have been lazy before okay now i want you to raise your hand because if you don't raise your hands i'm going to go up to you and say that how are you doing i need to know i need what you have and what we have and what we need is a spirit of god dwelling in us but as i said that the disciples were bewildered they didn't know what to do the master had been taken away they wanted to go back to what they the word of god sunday morning sunday night where did you come from when i first met you in guadalajara you know when i was your age when i first met you what they want to say uh i was in chihuahua i was in the united states having fun now when i met you with the other guy that what did you do prior to that to you receiving the word of god remember i'm looking in your eyes so what'd you do guess yes he was a college student yeah yeah yeah we want to go back to that okay don't you cause you wanted to get they wanted to go back to what they were prior to receiving the word of god in their life fishermen back to the nets they didn't know what to do they didn't have a leader they didn't know how to make ends meet can you imagine they couldn't some of them couldn't write their names the other guy was tax collector man he had those numbers one was the doctor yeah you cleaning he'll go back to what he and he was dead lady one lady two is sane go to galilee what does christ mean significant stand up i said i was going to make it so simple stand up right there i have believed i've heard i've heard not all of them i'm sorry to say i don't i really haven't heard a lot of brother bernie's tapes only what we there in other words if the same spirit that was in jesus christ is in us today this morning is it in this person is it in this person do let me say it again what has been preached can you say amen so we're here this morning four five six seven eight nine ten yes to stimulate your faith so that we can resurrect so that we can be what we should be say it again so that we can be we should be sir but i ain't what i used they can slap you how many have you been slapped by a message believer i don't mean spiritually i mean physically you know physically and he did this to me for me and then the brother get closer i'm biting you i won't push you the brother does this he does this so when somebody says something bad about you no but when the devil speaks to a person is he telling the truth is he telling you the truth okay i believe he's telling me the truth i'm a snake in the grass i'm everything he said 99.9 percent the devil isn't going to say something that you haven't done i mean he's taking a tabulation he's doing everything that you've done he's marking it down to accuse you day and night so he's writing everything down so when he comes to you and he says i'm not lying no don't you [Music] he's telling the truth but it's that point nine or 0.1 because jesus forgave me those brothers they opened their church to this morning and i wanted to say it was like what we did yesterday and yesterday this church iglesia was built we were here tell what time at night 10 11 o'clock that was yes
