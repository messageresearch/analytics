god bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord turn around and greet your brother it's a beautiful resurrection morning one thing we do know lo que sisa we we we're the greatest the cream of the crops were special this morning so that we could be special this morning so that we would honor this day as the day of resurrection no matter how sick we are many troubles there are in our i'm not gonna run this morning i'm going to wait i'm going to anchor myself a young clown the word of god i'm not going to move i'm going to stay there i get the economy is not what it should be in our household that's not a problem what we should do is put all our attention control our mighty when the tribulations come when the storms come don't run stay put don't move forward and pray praise the family or family if you're not married pray as an individual invite your friends christ if no one's around then you pray don't because i need to make sure that my mind is clear everything is cancelled out no doubts can i do this it's just you yes and your creator is whatever you want that in your life i asked god every day to give me and i'll tell ya i never go out on saturdays you know sabados i shouldn't be at so-and-so's house somewhere else i should be home myself for this day and we are the ones we need to pray we are the ones we need to lay hands we're not in the right state of mind there's something wrong that person won't be healed because i didn't prepare myself brother paul used to have a famous saying brother paul garcia garcia junior i'm gonna sanctify myself if i'm the director of music director or the song leader well director i'm going to sanctify myself if i'm the usher if i'm the deacon i'm the person at the door but we don't do that anymore because it's become a routine in our life god is good god forgive me god is a just god god is righteous god is full of grace i gotta prepare myself today he needs to give me to fill me with all his righteousness today boy i will not wait until tomorrow i want it now get away and if i want it now see i am entitled to his blessing to the word love that's mine those are promises to you and i promise you but we have to grab them and not let them go that's a genuine christian christian we're structured line up with it has to be fresh meat god we're going to go to ephesians 6. and starting with verse 11. i'm sorry i um i was hearing the tape of brother bernie he was telling me i hate those wires what upsets me is a window or a glass door or anything that has to deal with glass i'm sorry my cell phone i meant because you know how you do this your computer touchstone computer this you move it like this get all your fingerprints on that you have a lot of oil in your hands so what irritates you something irritates us some people are irritated juan montoya knows enough spanish why doesn't he speak spanish so people are always irritated so that's why we read says put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil if i stand firm we need the whole armor amen verse 12. for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against spiritual wickedness in copernadores [Applause] against rulers of darkness of this excuse me rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wickedness malicious evil doers yeah high places in los angeles what we need to understand four demons it's always been four four angels of life four angels of death so there's four demon powers that we know of spirits can you say amanda and the more it gets real to us and those spirits are all the armor of god wherefore taken to take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand today remember that's our nature we allow people to push us around pretend you're slapping me okay turn the other cheek there's something wrong with us come and push us around how many of you are being pushed around raise your hand you're either doing it twice stand there for having your loins girt about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness means to fasten it is amen amen and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all take the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench the fiery darks of the wicked. preparation means and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god with all prayer and supplication in the spirit there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints you but i can't sleep until after 12 midnight but you know so they caught me in a good time but this is where we can cast out whatever is blocking the avenue of your success your walk with christ amen amen the belt of truth when i start looking at this the only thing i can tell myself the problem is today what sets it's holding your trousers belt the woman or the man the man i know on occasions there's dresses that have belts but the reason they have belts is they want to see the waist they want people to notice your waist again we need to make sure we have our belt the true word of god if it's not in the bible in the message be careful what people tell you because today is the day that we are being deceived without even knowing it breast plate of righteousness i need to understand what this breastplate of righteousness is you know i i was going through my slides but i had something different written down so you're going to have to forgive me here breastplate is righteous what is given by god it's not what i give you as being righteous what god has given us is it protects our heart the breast plate protects what your heart is so what happens if i drink a lot of pepsi a lot of coca-cola where are my coke drinkers or pepsi you know don't be ashamed raise your hands gotta be honest i drink coke i only drink coke coca-cola my wife's listening to me i only drink coke if it's in a bottle made in mexico otherwise i'm not gonna drink i want [Music] it's not protecting your heart your blood with the sugars it guards against the attacks who's going to attack you you know what take your brother your sister the bible said put on the whole armor of god wrestle against my brother [Applause] amen we're going to stop right there i wanted to ask you a question if you're in trouble this morning i need to know because many times i have been troubled so much that many times what i need to do i need to stop and look at what the trouble is and all of a sudden god said okay harass montoya montoya okay okay go harass hey molesta brother casas all right okay go [Applause] and that first punch that he throws i got a real knuckle sandwich all right so i'm going to show you i'm going to sucker [Music] or he comes over here like this i see you know how they get in here like this and he bites your ear yes or no tyson tyson he bit his opponent's ear off [Applause] and he plays with us because he knows what your weakness is and that's what he attacks then i would suggest how many of you are foolish i am not foolish i stay away from that because i know where i'm standing is on god's word is all [Applause] in other words you're going to receive [Applause] what a so the first person that i can remember elijah was troubled elias uncle if your wife is a virgin stand up jesus christ i was looking for water not the jesus christ let me say that over again maybe you didn't hear me your wife is a virgin american all right hold it right there how do you think i say i always have a danny curve is jesus christ coming jesus christ for four virgins the brother and man jesus doesn't look at my wife my sister he sees them as virgins i don't care how many babies your wife is the best and the size of god coming for a virgin so let me put it this way brothers how many of your wives there is something wrong with the picture thank you jesus is coming for a bride that's a virgin spotless and if he's is foreign i so my question is is she going to be there bastard no god you guys are okay i know samson that guy was a woman from here to there is he going to be there i'm sorry david jesus christ he only had two wives in the bible you know [Music] you know he must have had uh can you give me some water please okay uh he had 500 wives we're not talking about concubines is david gonna be there what's our problem i'm not saying go out there and get another wife i'm saying that god chose he's elected and if david he chose david he says what about you you know you're getting out of well you're not what you used to be when i first saw you it's bigger than your butt i mean uh your your stomach proportion wise you're still the same person i'm married i love you because the word of god says jesus is coming for virginia amen amen so when you look at your wife respect her more respect when you're with your wife make sure you give her flowers she's very fragile make sure i say what i say excuse me i'm not taking a lot of time but i do need to say this they go through something called menopause if you don't think i should say it and before you know it you're arguing and you don't know why you're arguing troubles but you don't know why there's trouble and the first thing you want to do is you start there used to be a brother in the church well i didn't look at him he says what's wrong no another sorry for that type of language but there's abuse and homelessness and it's no longer the woman being abused that's why when you look for a girlfriend or a wife you better know who you're going to select your right sucker punch so what does that have to do with all the rice in china and by now a husband should know his wife you know when she's in trouble you know what makes you know when to give her you give her your credit card when she's having those problems that's when you come to rescue you want to avoid problems in your home understand that your wife is fragile let me give you a scenario brother branham helena branham comes home how many of you watch dishes well i do you'll see i'm going to make uh dinner or lunch for your wife but i like to cook said if i ever cook for you guys i read a book so i follow instructions so then i need to make sure that this fragile instrument that god gave me instruments when she has a problem i gotta go there and see what's wrong because if i run because what is your problem look look at the belt check it out this is what happens in the in in the family structure you have a lot of problems in the household we escalate the problem we were taught when problems come all we have to do is go pray yes who has a happy marriage but we don't have a perfect marriage like this i see let's go have an ice cream mama let me buy you this dress or are we like this oh hey hey my food hey hey old lady i thought we were having a happy marriage no i've never called my wife old lady you know i had a mother and uh if she my mother was a mother she would call you a son of a somebody [Music] and if we say there's no problems the first man and woman they had a perfect marriage but joseph i thought you uh you weren't married but look check her out man you mean what you did before you guys got married snake in the grass you can't do that you disrespect that is why i'm saying mary criticized joseph was criticized and it wasn't even jose's baby and what did she do did she run or did she stay put she stayed put firm and said let thy will don't run with uh aussie here hey aussie uh can you drive me i'm gonna go have a beer i'm gonna get drunk because my wife just did this i need a chauffeur so the police won't stop because she's not what she was supposed have a social drink gotta go to the movies i'm gonna meet the girls my friends there's something wrong well honey can you spend your money because you got your account what you do with your money what i do with my money no because and then when there is a problem you gotta pray brother branham said a family that prays together stays together amen what has gone wrong no chaos we didn't put all the armor of god on something went wrong with the armor [Applause] [Music] go to that slide and we're gonna get ready to close it should be slide 22. the devil's good at what he does he's going to examine your life he's going to know your life do that just stay there don't move it he knows how to bring in el salvador and you start reasoning and before you know it you're walking out you jumping up and down stabbing you hollering dancing in the spirit your head is down your heart is down nothing to do with the message you know montoya you just don't understand the scripture in reference to in reference the word of god being inspired but we all know from the denomination that scripture wasn't divine you remember that little old lady her son said that to her came out hollering yesterday if that's not inspiring and he held but you don't win hello it's just a scratch only a dollar you win but you're getting hot message how many of you guys like cards playing cards you know hearts spades hearts um i don't know how you say spades then you have another one where uh different classes yeah you have one where you go ace to ace king styles oh no they what is it called i i know it if somebody tells me anyway you have four groups sure they're all what is that called solitude solitary how many of you played what did brother branham say about cars how many of you play cards don't pick up cards why then go solitary so i play it on there it's the same thing he's not going to take away what he gave you satan knows what he gave satan he's just going to add to it you're going to win money and before you know it you're going to gamble so much you're going to gamble away your house payment el because that's what he wants to do so here we have a picture who is this somebody asks wow where is this jesus

today the punches i don't like you no man oh my gosh the gospel wasn't for me because we're critics we are critics and we don't know it how many of you are critics because i'm a critic if i want to be a critic you're thinking i'm not a critic i am a critic because i live on this earth you can criticize whatever you critics um that's what the devil wants he believes in separation because all it is
