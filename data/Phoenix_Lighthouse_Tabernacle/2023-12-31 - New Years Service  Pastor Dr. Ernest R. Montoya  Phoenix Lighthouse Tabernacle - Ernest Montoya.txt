TRANSCRIPT
========================================
say I'm get a bishop no no he didn't that because he know the pope would be wrong so with the bishop he never said go get a general overseer to watch over my churches no he got the holy [Applause] ghost that was his ra children all right then how would you know the Holy Ghost speaks through human lips how do you know that tell the truth when you see the Holy Spirit speaking through your lips that's telling the truth exactly every time predicting that coming to pass just perfectly like know God said if he speaks and what he says don't come to F on hearing because I'm not with him but he hear there are that's how he does now then he goes around now why do you think that tutor would say if he had to go up to the father and say your your children's acting awful I tell you that boy yours he's re he a I never seen you know what he does that girl of yours oh I don't know what you going do with her well you know what she looks up she she's all painted up like some them girls over here in philistin yes she wants to act just like they do my daughter yeah your daughter that's what the Holy Spirit has to say about the church today no wonder we can't have a Revival now that's true what about your son same thing what well you know you always said that those sheep should Hur that pasture up there on that sheep food up there you know what he did he drove them down in that weed pile just tuck him down there dunk them all in that Creek and let them ra around that weed pile eating them old Willers and there support they can't hardly get out of there that's Bishops pastors who deny the power thereof well I tell you the truth I never seen such a bunch of nervous sheep in my life you don't like that no and you know you Fe on that Al up there you know to make him fat know we yeah he's make them joar societies everything you never seen life in your life never seen all your life you know what he's doing going along out there smoking a big cigar right back he's got his wife with him she's wearing shorts just like the Philistines are doing out there yeah that's kind of message the Holy Spirit has taken by church today now what do you think about that that's adoption what he did he do he predestined us us onto adoption he give us the Holy Ghost but wait a minute adoption that's what we're talking about ad well you know what he does the bishop come by the other day and he was having little healing service down there the bishop come by some guy brother come by with praying for the sick he said you stop that don't cooperate and here I come and tell him the truth right out of your word here it is I'll read your laws to him exactly what to do and he won't listen to he said all that was for another age another son some other time that don't mean me are that's truth to see where the church misses his places while we haven't got revivals while we haven't got things going on that's where Joshua say uh dad I want you to WR in here L your place according to the blue your place get herein you go right down here and now you all stay away the bosu comes back all over women painted up and dancing around having a big time and josua scratches his that's just exactly what's taking place not all thank God not all but too many all right now what takes place then that's what happen don't you imagine that man the Holy Spirit blushes before the father when he has to say that oh my I told him he wouldn't listen to it I told him met and let him read right there in the book I had I had a little minister to come by and show him that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever you know what he let one of them let one of them old gold herders come over here and tell him that that was for another age and he smelled so bad time he got over there with goat smell you know cigars smell so bad when he got over here but I tell you that Lord H had enough metal spinn on him or I if you'd write his name in the paper take his bit would take a half a sheet to make his time they sure like him over there in that country but I tell you he sure don't know how to feed sheep he just won't listen to says holy spirit I tried to tell him that you're the same yesterday forever do the biggest ever seen my life and the church has made him an overseer all the people listen to him and then you know what they take those got little little thing down there they call a television they turn the little thing on like that and then women come on and carry on all kind of halfway dresses you know lot yours yes they are they do some of them are crying out for Revival father of some of them are really walk in the life some of them are stand just as true on that word as they can be others I don't know what to do they're they're way out there you know what them mothers do making fun of and just a bunch of well that makes me feel pretty bad but now let's change the picture now the father his son is a good Bo here the of the Holy which way the Holy Spirit he said I'm going to walk said I'm the child said I'll walk right with you I'll go right with all right with you I got confidence in you if I start getting tired you raise my hand up hold me on but there's Lions up on the hill there don't matter as long as you're around don't make a bit of difference there's trouble up there oh you know what your dad used to do that that's good yes sir get up on top the hill there oh he said you know what father your son is just like a chip off the old he is absolutely exactly like you every word that you say he says Amen to it I I had him turn over in the Bible the other day and he said Jesus Christ the same yesterday you know what he said he screamed and throw his hands up the ear and said hallelujah [Music] amen Allelujah amen oh and you know said here in your words you he where you said the work he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yeah I remember writing that to my son yeah I remember that oh he saw that he just and Hallelujah Lord take all the world out of me make me like that yes sir all those things that he done oh the father said is I'm I'm happy for that son that's a fine son all right keep ey on for a few years see how see how come on progresses after a while the years pass by how's he get oh my he's even growing in gra he just he's Shing the wood I'm telling you he's he's really why he takes them sheep can handle them just just like you do he'll never give him seaweeds he'll never give him arm weeds when they come around saying we want to Jo the church and say shut your mouth you don't need that no sir here's what you need repent be baptized everyone of you [Applause] nameus yes sir that's what he said oh does he really say that yes sir he sure does well that's just the way I wrote that's just the way he says it some of them said tell you C of Jerusalem tell you do with hard High the Holy Ghost come upon you be witness me in Jerusalem Juda and Sam most Parts world when Hallelujah that's what you need you know what he does he just gets him right down there to the G that's all stay right with him they start fting wait a minute wait a minute that's why goats act not sheep or sometimes they get a little PE at him but he kind of Pats him on the back a little bit wa he really knows how to control them sheep yes sir I'll tell you you know what I seen Archbishop Shan tell him if he could come in this town hold meeting but you know I kind of let him I said go anyhow we through all these tapes and don't you let them go out we went anyhow went over in these towns said well we want and you know the devil got there said I bet you I can keep him out of that town said do I tell him to go he'll go I bet you you go no tell all my agents all you don't want that old fanaticism down here all that old Divine Healing and that old holy ghost stuff that passed back with the apostles years ago you know that's no good back there try them old iron weeds everything like that it you know what it went right went right on down there throw you what sheep start as as while they're having healings and meetings and you know allot them young fellows to begin well they seen they got a big bunch of ha like that Al what he was so good to they run over the neighbors they taste this taste [Music] let him come let him come here see say and they're just having a great time down there oh that's my son that's my boy oh you think he's well matured y sure said the Holy [Music] Spirit G test I tried this way tried that way I stom him I let the devil do everything could do he come right back up again come up again I made si in hospital him out done I turned his wife against him I turned his neighbors against him I turned everything that didn't make a bit of difference [Music] I kill his family I took this I did this I done all this I did [Applause] this oh well I believe we are to call him out somewhere to a little special place and have an adoption oh W now when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son must come of age and have been seasoned out unto adoption unto they're born a child but when they son right there but then there'll never be no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and show up they are he call him out then now here we are Church are you ready that's a little bit late everybody bite your finger pit your soul and pluck your heart just for a minute now we're going to place the church now when the church gets to that place he says Manis you belong over here EP you over here then he takes him out to a certain place the father does and he sets them upon a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he said I want everyone to know that this is my and I adopt my son I want anyone to know from hence forth that his name I dressed him up a special dress on him and I want you to know that his name is just as good on any check my name is he's my child I adopt him into my family although he's been my son since he was born you receive the Holy Ghost he's been my son but now I'm going to place him positionally in authority what he fires is what Hees is be moved and don't doubt your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said you are you are son how many know that the adoption they adopted the son after he had proved to be a everybody ever read the Bible son now God did the same thing to his son we took Jesus up on Mount Transfiguration he talk Peter James and John up there that's three Witnesses of the earth there was jesuses and God up the stood up on the mountain and first thing you know they look and Jesus was glorified before them is that right how many know that's the scripture what did he do he dressed in the robe of immortality and he said his R shine like the sun is that right a over fell on their face and they looked and there stood Moses and elah talking to him and Moses had been dead on a buried in an

of the Lord uh we've given given the young people enough time to prepare themselves I decided I'd speak today I had enough of uh rest um it's not that I ran out of message we could never run off run out of what brother Brenham said and being that today is a special day God bless you brother uh being that it's a special day uh we always look to see how we're going to set our goals for the new year that's coming it's couple hours away uh but we have uh what we give up we promise God how many of you do that you still do that mentally orally uh but we do it Lord I'm going to give up the Lord I'm going to give up that you don't do that none of us are we asleep I'll wake you up in a minute but we have to prioritize everything that we do from the time that we wake up till the time we go to sleep we prioritize what we need to accomplish for that day at work you prioritize what's important during that day how many of you work raise your hand all right I'm the only one I'm a 24-hour worker my work doesn't stop if you don't see me here preaching my work still doesn't stop so I want you to stand with me we're going to pray uh we're going to enter a thought for the whole year and we're going to pray is a prayer that brother Brenham prayed he pre he prayed it on uh 1956 so that's what we're gonna we're going to listen to are we to have his voice and my voice but I'm going to read it so all you need to do is just bow your heads as we read this again why people why are people so tossed about preached in Jeffersonville but here's his prayer and I want you uh to absorb each word that brother Brenham is stating and we submit ourselves to the this morning the beginning of this new year and ask that you will fill us with your Holy Spirit Lord and draw Us close to thee and may thy Everlasting arm be around us and hold us Lord for the days are shaking and dark but the Morning Star is leading the way we shall follow Lord where thou leads me I will follow if the if F be some through the waters some through the floods and some through deep trials but all through the blood oh God lead us by thy Everlasting hand until the victory finally is won and Jesus returns to earth sin sickness and sorrow will be ended and we'll live in a glorious Millennium with thee we're longing for that great day come Jes Lord Jesus to Thy word today get into it circumcise the lips and speak and the heart that hears and may the seed fall into the hearts where the Holy Spirit Will sew it and bring forth and bring forth a hundredfold we ask in Jesus name amen isn't that beautiful circumcise Lord our lips today that's what we need now as you're standing let's read the scripture we're going to be reading we're going to turn to Genesis 1 1-5 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was was without form and void and Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day take your seats God bless his word and God bless our hearts this morning you know every year what we normally do is I'll tell you what God has showed me how God talks with me and from me to you we've had seven years of plenty and all since the covid-19 since that time period we have we've struggled people have struggled what we call it that in the land that we live today there's such a struggle that we don't know what the government is doing anymore they only tell us what they want to tell us can you say Amen to that so we're confused and I woke up one day with the same thought what about 2024 what's going to happen in 2024 if I was to ask you what will you be doing in 2024 throughout the year I will tell you what I'm going to be doing I can't stop planting the potatoes we need to continue We Can't Stop I can't give a moment to Satan because if I give him a second he's going to take the whole year from me let me say it this way be careful how you spend your money this year don't overspend in other words don't go out and buy a brand new car when you have a car don't go out and buy a new house when you have a house go out and buy property because the value of property this coming year is going to go down our homes aren't going to have the same value that they had 2023 the interest rates are not going to go down they're going to climb we're going to lose our jobs price of food it's going up yes or no yes or no gas prices are coming down but our economy is not stable if we see our economy today it's the dollar is not worth a dollar it's more like 30 cents and I'm going to tell you from me to you be extremely careful before you sign your life away on something you don't need in 2024 if you don't know the person that's winning the election or that will win the election will promise you less taxes tax but they never completed a better future but it's never there Jesus Christ offers us eternal life and patiently we will wait until we receive what we or what is our inheritance can you say Amen how many of us have an inheritance I hope we have an in inance I hope that we understand this message because the more I see let me go here this is my first quote um go to slide thank you brother Brenham says it clearly because I need for you to understand one thing I don't worry about you I don't worry about myself I don't worry about the ministry I worry about the young people I worry about those individuals that want to give their life to Christ but they see us instead of seeing the reflection of Jesus Christ we're not seeing the reflection of Jesus Christ we have a in we have a foot out and we haven't decided what about the future of our youth this what brother Brenham said so you understand apply it to our life apply it to your family and if you got something in your heart for God how many of you have something in your heart God and you won't Express and so forth and just keep putting it off how many of how many of us fall into that category don't raise your hand but do me a favor think about the person sitting right next to you or the person that should be here in well later on later on a little desire that you once had to serve God will be given to you 100 fold is that what it says is that what brother brandham said no no the little desire you once had to serve God will be taken away from you I want you to think about that that desire that you're son your daughter your grandson your granddaughter I include myself that desire they once had being taught in a Sunday school and all of a sudden want to serve God they want to serve God but all of a sudden something happens they find out that the world has something to offer and that desire to serve God is fading away that's why I have the young people preach that's why I have them leading song surface that's why we go out on outings why cuz I'm looking at tomorrow's youth now you that have kids that are obedient you don't know what happens when they leave your area your environment when they go to school when they go here when they go there you're not there you don't know what they're thinking you may think we know the devil the Devil is a Tormentor that's what a devil is he's a Tormentor and he comes to our mind and we become a mindset our mind is set our attitude is set I don't know if you thought I was going to speak like this for a new year maybe you thought I was going to Sugar Code something I cannot time is running out the devil will come in and steal that desire remember he's a spirit and you receive the anointing we all receive an anointing are you awake now this is how brother Brenham was you know I continue looking and brother Brenham said on the next quote I want to read these two quotes because then I have questions I have four questions for you he goes on and faith is a substance I know we've all read the message but it says this this is excuse me this that we're living in it's such a day of unsettled peace what's happening in Israel is there peace what's happening in Mexico I hear they're going to elect a woman president is that what's happening right now I'm unsettled Peace So I ask you how many of us today have an unsettled mind none of us I'm the first one to put my hand up and then brother Brenham goes out goes on and he says and unsettled rest everywhere now remember this is 1947 who was born in 1947 stand up if you were born in 1947 is that what's happening today again how long ago was that 77 7 8 years whatever it is we weren't born and here's the prophet telling us unsettled peace unsettled rest what is going on with Mr Trump wants to kill everyone that is against him tells people my message to you and he says rot in hell and his counterpart is saying love those that talk about you bless him forgive them people are running to and fro speaking whatever they may speak in other words we go from house to house I don't know if you do it did you hear what he said it makes no sense what do you think I think he's lost it buddy or excuse me brother I lost it a long time ago you're just seeing Ernie Montoya but I lost it a long time ago I lost my thoughts I lost everything gave everything to the person that owes me the the person that owns me is the Lord Jesus Christ I forfeited everything and if you're not doing that we're in trouble we need to Forfeit our rights he goes on he says this whatever they may speak most anybody can get a following uh birds of feather flock together unsettled peace unsettled rest I don't know I opened up a page you know I was looking at YouTube I wanted to see what caros spoke loved it Milton loved it so and so I loved it but as I scroll down starts talking about people commentator everything negative about this message and there's people that follow that they want to follow it so they can find a way to leave the message they're looking for excuses and let me tell you one over here I'm going to ask did Brother Brenham make mistakes yes or no he's a man he made mistakes but when the anointing came when he was preaching it wasn't William Mary and brand it was the Holy Spirit behind the man could not make a mistake commentaries we hear it a lot people may be starving to death spiritually and the first thing I do I'm going to use me as an example I don't know about you but phix lighthous they preach the same thing over and over again why don't we go listen to somebody else I don't want to go to church same people are there starving starving looking for the word of God in different places well I'm going to see what this brother is preaching I'm going to see what the other brother's preaching let me tell you one what I believe and excuse me because I know this is online but I cannot listen to other pastors that don't believe the same thing I believe why do I want to listen to someone that is against our Apostle I have no reason to enter into that I know it's hard but we're coming into a new year there's going to be a separation and guess what brother brandham said God calls for separators not from the word but from our nonsense my first question next one how many of us are serving each other some of us can't even stand talking to each other on some of us can't even stand talking to each other let alone fellowshipping I know it's hard told you I was going to wake you up because we're at the end time and I have no business trying to Sugar Cod this message I want to say it the way he said it I need to do what I need to do is prepare a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ we're in the end time and we got to do one thing we got to mature quit acting like babies we need to teach the young people what our forefathers taught us serving each other I'm sorry brother arenas what did you send me this week you send me a a tape an audio yes or no raise your hand if you did I mean I thought I heard brother Bernie's messages but let me tell you brother Bernie preached he said at 1300 how many of you have uh 1300 tapes of brother Bernie because he told me brother Monto I preached 1300 tapes M all together I have 5,000 where are the 5,000 at so then I receive an audio brother B Bernie is is preaching and then he decides to pray for whom who did he pray for he prayed for the young people and am I right or wrong raise your hand if I if that's what it said and you wrote to me and you said has this been completed is that what you said to me raise your hand and I said yes that's what's going on today our youth are being trained The Way We Were trained in the beginning I'm sorry uh young people are you leading song Services somebody raise your hand yeah do we give you an opportunity to speak raise your hand someone yes be with me or either that or I'm a liar I mean I'm giv up this Pulpit to the young people there had to been a purpose when did we start yesterday how long has it been a year when did you send me the audio Sun uh Friday Saturday when was it preached what year 86 96 I said where's this place at I didn't recognize it and you told me why am I saying all this because there's a bearing behind everything that we do here in the lious it's no coincidence this was his purpose how much time do we have left I don't know I do know one thing that life is going to continue we're getting older someone has to carry the banner of Malachi 45 brother Brenham stated we're commanded to pray one for another and speak right against one another is that what he said now listen to it the way he said it that's the way I said it we're commanded to pray it's not in there we're commanded to pray one for another not not not to talk against one another but to love one another so every time someone talks against you any of us what you need to do be on your guard STI up for that brother tell that brother tell that sister that's not my thoughts your thoughts are louder are louder in heaven than they are on earth my thoughts words my thoughts whatever you're thinking this morning be careful there's a recording Angel as I said writing your thoughts that's writing what you say you express what you express our voices and our thoughts are being recorded can you say Amen again Isaiah 55 11 I thought I had it uh read it in English and in Spanish please Isaiah 5511 so shall my word be that goest forth out of my mouth and it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things where I send it can you say Amen because that's what we're going to talk about right now when you say something that comes out of your mouth it's going to go out and it cannot return you can't call it back it already went to its destination just like what brother Brenham said that our voices are recorded and they're in that radio type environment atmosphere whatever it's called the air all of a sudden it's recording it there and one day sooner or later you will hear that recording of your thoughts said because God said my word my word goeth forth out of my mouth he said it that's how he created the heavens and the Earth that's how he created everything that is on this Earth a word but it was a thought before it was a word came out of his mouth so what comes out of my mouth what comes out of your mouth be careful Satan can plant misleading thoughts in our mind can can I say that over again Satan can plant thoughts in our mind and 99% of it is scriptural there's only one part that is a lie but we accept everything he tells us if Satan has talked to you I want you to stand up stand up if Satan has ever talking he's talked to all of us the key is not to accept what he tells us now you can take your seats his most successful tool that he has he wants to entice us contrary to the will of God does he do a good job you better believe he does he's good at what he does he has experience so let me look at this correctly see if I can uh go to the next slide should be ah stay right there in the Bible words are spoken as what what is that in English what is it it's a seed so in the Bible words are spoken as seeds once a word is spoken I gave you just a little bit it forms a seed once something comes out of your mouth it's going to form a seed it cannot it cannot be taken back the words we speak are the seeds we seow so do me a favor brother Brenham said if you cannot find something good to say about someone what are we supposed to do don't say anything can you say Amen not my words they were his words not his words but they're found in the Bible what what is it God created the world with words he spoke the little seed gave life ordained now if you're a seed stand up if you're a seed stand up thank you I'm waking you up thank you you can take your seats you were ordained before the foundation of the world no matter what you think you are today I don't care what you think about yourself what I care do you still have a desire to serve God that's what I care about what I was doesn't matter what I am matters to God you say Amen what you are what you were doesn't matter what you will be matters Say Amen my words that goes out of my mouth Ernie montoya's words come out of my mouth it will not return to be empty but will accomplish the desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it out you like said I love it what comes out of my mouth Will Go On It won't stop that's why mama you pray for your son mama that's why you give your son your daughter to Jesus you take that away from your your shoulders you give it to the hands of Jesus let him his time that he brings him in remember one thing you and I are subject to time we want everything fast it doesn't work that way God has a time but you have to express it you got to say it my son my daughter my prayers I can't take this anymore more Lord what am I supposed to do now it came out it came out of your mouth what came out is for a purpose so that that can bring that seed of the Lord Jesus Christ to go out and bring forth what you're asking that's a simple message so simple that it goes overhead I can't believe that I want some more meat I need to understand this mystery that Min mystery that's a mystery that has confused man so here it is a blade of grass you can show it to me but scientifically tell me where it came from how it grows how it produces itself it cannot be explained yes or no brother Brenham said it cannot they get confused that's the way it is with this message everybody wants to know what's going to happen over here I need to know what's going to happen today what am I going to do with what I have what responsibility do we have in 2024 for the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's in your hands it's in my hands the gospel something simple that we need to go back to say when I was a child I believed everything daddy told daddy would tell me God created the Heaven and Earth I Believe by his stripes we are healed I believe it but now we look at the symptoms brother Brenham said don't do that don't look at the symptoms look at the results we get so caught up with symptoms that's the reason people don't see what we should be seeing because we're not looking for our sons our daughters to prosper to receive what you have received now I want you to do this for me I've taken a long time and just got to question one question two how many of us want to enter the new year as a genuine Christian a genuine Christian is Born Again is growing obtains the holy spirit is subject to those of authority can I say that over our subject to those of authority I love the Spanish Bible what does it say in the Spanish Bible uh you know I I I I still don't understand your Spanish you know his Spanish is way up here in my Spanish I mean I'm lucky that I can say see seor I'm teasing you no I can't hear you ready oh yeah yeah there you go well pray for a pastor that they U give an account for your soul which verse is that uh English excuse me the Spanish which what year obey those that have authority over you in Spanish it says obey the pastors is that what it says see how simple that is but that's not what we want to hear because we have our mindset we believe what we want to believe we accept what we want to accept he came from Glory who came from glory to do what to justify you to sanctify you to fill you with that new birth can you say Amen the church the lighthouse our other churches under circuit writer Ministries have been tested have been tested gone through trials through losses through sicknesses through sorrow through death and still stand with a testimony tell me you haven't gone as a church through trials through tribul through sorrow through Agony and you still have a testimony that's what everybody wants that's what the devil wants to destroy our testimony once he has that then the desire is slipping away you do this well I thought I had the Holy Spirit and you let it go that's when you grab it and you hold on to a tighter knowing one thing that greater is he that is where right there than he that is in the world again quit looking at your syptoms it delays your healing that's what a genu wine Christian enter New Year sisters excuse me young sister excuse me but I know that guy has a really nice smile uh don't hide I already saw you that brother has a good smile a good job single young ladies don't hide your expression don't hide that smile because I'm looking beyond that smile tell me you're not looking for a husband that will support you what what do we want entering the new year I want for sisters for brothers prior to thinking that they be filled with the Holy Ghost brother Garcia said one thing maybe you recall I Won't Say I'm old so I forget I don't forget nothing I ain't I ain't I'm not I love the way brother Bram talk so don't try to correct me I ain't that old yeah that old listen it's got a lot of years in this body so what I want you to do brother Garcia said you should have what there's four of you okay let's and then you be the fifth they you know what I love about these guys that I travel with they go to sleep with a tape of brother Garcia I can be in the bottom floor I can be 10 doors down and I can't sleep because I'm hearing the tape so then I tell them in the morning wake up we're having by the way it was good tape wasn't it so the question again brother Garcia prior to you young people you should have what get the mic okay just give me one all right good job a house a new birth knew G to say that give me one thank you he said be born again that they both be born again everything else will fall into so sister brother you're looking for a a young girl maybe she blinked her eyes at you make sure she has been born again number one make sure she has been born again then you have a job I knew there was somebody missing I'm not going to say who but I just caught the waves out there be born again have a job have a bank account bank account is important today's the wife is for a young man don't know about you it's your car pay more attention to your car or your truck than you do anything else yes or no no look I wasn't born yesterday don't touch it don't tell me what's going through your mind because I already know we treat our cars better than somebody else that we should be treating let's go to the uh the next quote and I'm going to be stopped in a little while brother Brenham goes but people live today like there was going this is the only thing there was live here on Earth that's all you don't realize you got a soul that's going to leave here and go somewhere and you seal your destination in heaven right here the way you live the way we live the way you do what you do next slide go back one I'm sorry one more uh go forward one no go back we're on there uh what did what didn't come out no it's right out holding grudges what's a grudge bitterness we hold something against someone well Eli did my car wrong charged me too much he lost my car he gave it to someone else he forgot what I look like we hold grudges bitterness how how many of you have a bitterness towards somebody don't think about it and mean how many of you are mean now raise your hand you know somebody just told me not too long ago they saw my picture and I look like a grouch I don't know where it's at so I told the brother God bless you that's the the way I look every day don't change I wake up I look that way when I go to sleep I look that way when I greet people I look that way this is me I can't change it I can't be goodl looking like them I am what I am but I never hold grudges I'm not mean that means you come to me for advice I will give you advice you need something I will give it to you mean you may disagree with me yourself because when you say it it goes out there and you can't return it you got to go to the person that you offended and what what are we going to do repent I'm sorry brother I said this I'm sorry sister this is what I said repent is that hard to do again my soul is where where is it going to be sealed it's too late over there the only thing your Soul's going to take is the character you have he goes on and he's talking shame on us when you hold a grudge when you become mean shame on us you bring I bring it's that The Bootlegger it's that the prostitute it's a Christian that brings the approach Upon Jesus Christ we that confess this message that we've been born again filled with the spirit that's what our kids are looking at question three how many of us want more of the word this year what is our responsibility in 2024 in 2024 you have a decision to make I have a decision to make if I look for advice am I gonna go for to you for advice again I'm the pastor am I going to go to you I'm going to go to a friend a friend Pastor now all of a sudden somebody goes to Eli for advice Eli gives it to him is he the designated person that I've designated no there they are one two three those are the individuals that are to give advice no one else well oh you know I had a ring in my ear I thought it was water you know you get water in there so my my uh my youth brought it back so that I I didn't have a newspaper because I don't read the newspap why why pay for newspaper if I have it on my phone right so then I look at YouTube YouTube you know what YouTube does if that thing is there and you don't know what to do you get an empty bottle and you put it there and it's supposed to suck it out the ring yeah sonido so then I looked in there and it was clear there was nothing in there the thing was still going so then I did it again I what is wrong with you Montoya I talked to myself if you didn't know bad part is I answer myself and I said what does that have to do with anything on this Earth anything with a message putting an empty bottle in ear you think you're going to hear better I started laughing at myself so I look I have a mirror in my office looked in there I said turkey is that what I said oh well well brother Brenham said what we leave our families brother Brenham said this and this is where I stop live right it'll do something to to your children to follow you it's not in there on on keep living right doing right separate yourself from the things of the world live Godly in the presence in the present world for Jesus Christ Abraham seed brother rham said it your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on your children again your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be remember the little seed what they once had had they should always have it to serve the Lord Jesus Christ your life that you live before your family here we go will make an impression on what your children will be the two questions in that always what we live what we say leaves an impr impression on someone can you say Amen now I'm going to close give me two minutes question four this is where I stop how many of us want a new relationship with him then believe what is written every Divine promise of God in the Bible will produce it's met in the right kind of your heart it produces a promise if you need salvation believe that you're saved and accept Jesus Christ and you shall receive what you're asking for why because it's coming out of your mouth now stand up stand up open your hearts and believe whatever I said applies to our life leave the impression for your child for your children Heavenly Father Here we are entering a New Year we're hours away father but 2024 to me happened billions of years ago when I was in your thoughts you were aware of what I would be

come down that's why we need the shield to protect us if anyone be sick father the main thought of this message today let it come out of your mouth say it don't be embarrassed your neighbor needs a the same thing what I need more of Jesus what I need is a Lifeboat in my life so father grant that that lifebo come I long for that Lifeboat to wipe away my tears to bring joy to my heart to restore
