[34:42] may take your seats
[34:51] topic are Planet Redemption
[34:55] Redemption
[34:57] as we've been speaking on on Sunday
[34:59] mornings
[35:03] some of us understand that God has a
[35:06] plan
[35:09] I believe that's something very precious
[35:11] that if we can understand
[35:12] we can obtain many things
[35:20] knowing that God takes care of you
[35:23] God will provide for you
[35:26] but it's important to know and it's a
[35:28] plan that in that plan
[35:30] how it is
[35:40] message God Christ being the mystery of
[35:43] God revealed
[35:44] one of the purposes of God is
[35:47] that he wants to reveal himself
[35:51] when he wants to reveal his people he
[35:53] wants him he wants to be known
[35:55] for him to be known
[36:00] then he will show you how he wants
[36:02] things that please
[36:12] there are things that please
[36:43] can you please have patience with me
[36:47] Perhaps it is
[37:09] blessings for your children it's for
[37:11] your family
[37:20] that is what God gives to us
[37:23] one of the most essential things
[37:28] what God requires of us
[37:32] if you don't know what God is
[37:45] uh
[39:43] there was the other one on the
[40:39] you know what's going on around
[40:49] we're reading a couple of scriptures
[40:56] you can please follow me to the Book of
[40:58] Jeremiah
[41:00] in chapter 32.
[41:06] I'll be asking you to please write down
[41:09] the description
[41:13] you need to look for them if we have
[41:15] them on the screen
[41:18] so all together we can go at the same
[41:20] pace
[41:30] we're in the hands of God
[41:35] Jeremiah 32 verse
[41:47] this is
[41:59] that they may fear me forever
[42:18] if you have fear of God El cuarenta in
[42:22] 40. this is
[42:24] eterno and I will make an Everlasting
[42:26] Covenant
[42:28] that I will not turn away from them
[42:32] good but I will put my fear in their
[42:34] hearts apart
[42:37] from it
[42:39] now the scripture has a lot this is
[42:50] how God works
[43:10] that he does in his grace
[43:14] because ourselves we have a heart
[43:17] we have our own
[44:06] because the fear of God is a way of life
[44:11] right now
[44:20] I'd like to read another scripture yes a
[44:24] Deuteronomy 10.
[44:29] there we have it on the screen
[44:37] I know I want us to understand what God
[44:39] is asking from us
[44:41] we have to have that presence in our
[44:43] lives
[44:44] let's not forget this
[44:46] there's Commandments and there's
[44:47] requirements
[44:49] Deuteronomy 10 12.
[44:52] and now Israel
[44:55] what took the Lord thy God require of
[44:57] Thee
[44:58] there it says Israel
[45:01] it's a type
[45:03] but I want you to place your name
[45:05] I want you to take it personally
[45:08] we have to make this very clear in our
[45:10] lives
[45:16] but to fear the lord thy God
[45:19] to walk in all his ways and to love him
[45:24] to serve the Lord thy God
[45:27] with all thy heart
[45:29] and with all thy Souls
[45:41] it's happiness
[45:43] uh God wants us to be
[45:46] glad and he makes it very clear
[45:49] [Music]
[45:51] 13 says to keep the Commandments of the
[45:54] Lord and his statue
[45:55] which I commanded
[45:58] for thy good
[46:03] hold the Heaven and the heavens
[46:06] in the heaven of the heavens
[46:08] like Earth
[46:16] I don't know anymore but here's the
[46:18] creator of all things
[46:22] of the heavens of the heavens
[46:27] that is
[46:29] that itself is enough for me to have
[46:31] respective reverence for my God I can't
[46:32] even look to God it
[46:36] is
[46:36] in the Bible shows that no one can look
[46:39] to God because they died
[46:42] great in the Holiness of God
[46:52] here's a Commandment that the Bible
[46:54] shows us
[46:59] if it is a commandment
[47:02] s people
[47:05] forced everyone
[47:09] I want you to know
[47:11] that God doesn't Force anyone
[47:17] doesn't Force anyone
[47:18] we always have free moral age we're free
[47:21] moral agents he always gives us the
[47:23] freedom to choose
[47:24] and we want to feel we want to fill his
[47:27] Commandments the requirements for us oh
[47:29] no or not
[47:31] I know a lot of people
[47:34] who the claim to know about God
[47:36] they say I also know God I'm good
[47:41] I don't need all that what you do when
[47:43] you go to church and all that yo
[47:46] you were responding I know my God and he
[47:48] responds to me
[47:49] and they say God hearing God
[47:54] so the one just scratches their head and
[47:55] says
[47:58] where is the fear of God where is the
[48:01] respect where do you place it where do
[48:03] you leave it
[48:04] first you make him
[48:09] you make him that he's only there when
[48:11] you remember about him
[48:14] so then you see the faith they have yeah
[48:17] and they believe that
[48:19] they believe it
[48:21] but we know better
[48:24] now there's a responsibility when we
[48:26] know more the more we know the more God
[48:29] demands from us
[48:32] and one says well that's what God
[48:37] but by the grace of God we know just a
[48:38] bit more
[48:40] so then we have to be like what God asks
[48:41] of us
[48:44] what does God offer us
[48:46] he offers us eternal life God doesn't
[48:50] Force anyone
[48:55] the person might say one reality why
[48:56] would I want to do such things why serve
[48:59] God like you do
[49:01] and the answer is simple
[49:02] you may not die so you don't die
[49:07] because all of this goes towards death
[49:10] but when God gives us his word he gives
[49:14] us life
[49:15] that's why we have to follow him but not
[49:19] because we're obligated
[49:27] we can't just be satisfied with what's
[49:29] around us amen amen
[49:34] so let's look at different aspects of
[49:36] what is the fear of God
[49:41] Proverbs 9 verse 10.
[49:44] this is the fear of the Lord
[49:47] is the beginning of wisdom
[49:50] and the knowledge of the Holy
[49:52] is understanding
[49:56] once you know who the Holy One is I
[49:59] think you're an intelligent person
[50:01] you're intelligent when you know that
[50:04] when you have fear of God
[50:06] you become wise
[50:09] there's a beginning there which is
[50:11] wisdom that's the first thing
[50:14] to understand what wisdom is
[50:18] the Bible says show the righteous
[50:27] I didn't bring a definition from the
[50:29] dictionary
[50:31] but what I can tell you
[50:33] wisdom is knowing what to do
[50:37] and when that is wisdom
[50:41] wisdom is knowing what to do when and
[50:45] where
[50:49] you can
[50:52] study a lot of science books
[50:56] but that's not going to give you wisdom
[50:58] you will know a lot regarding that
[51:00] material
[51:01] but you won't receive wisdom wisdom
[51:04] comes from God what to do and want to do
[51:07] it what's it believe what not to believe
[51:09] amen what to speak what not to speak
[51:14] there's wisdom there
[51:17] and this is all based on the fear of God
[51:24] you can't ask for wisdom if you don't
[51:26] have the fear of God
[51:28] I know when it was at night or when
[51:30] we're praying say Lord give me wisdom
[51:40] that he surrounds us with wise people
[51:44] we don't know but it comes to our
[51:46] thoughts
[51:47] they speak with your pastors it's just
[51:49] that simple that is wisdom
[51:56] there's a Ministry that we have here we
[52:00] have leaders
[52:04] it's not complicated
[52:08] God also gives it to us directly
[52:10] through experience
[52:13] God works in different ways with
[52:15] different people but he's always there
[52:17] God gives it to him
[52:20] but you have to ask for it with faith is
[52:24] our faith always has to grasp on to
[52:27] something
[52:29] without faith it is impossible to please
[52:32] God if you have faith
[52:34] you place that Faith with the fear of
[52:36] God
[52:37] then you'll receive wisdom
[52:39] because God will be in you and in your
[52:42] decisions you won't be able to see
[52:44] anything
[52:45] you won't do anything without first
[52:47] getting closer to God and asking of his
[52:49] guidance amen
[52:53] is
[52:55] but it happens
[53:01] that we don't all have per se the same
[53:03] desire
[53:05] sometimes we struggle
[53:07] I look at the young ones
[53:12] sometimes they struggle to get to church
[53:16] but when I was young yes he
[53:20] is
[53:22] they don't have they don't have the same
[53:24] pool let's go to church I'm waiting for
[53:26] somebody to go to church
[53:27] because you're at a lower level of that
[53:29] fear
[53:31] but there's also a level that's beyond
[53:32] that
[53:35] there's a difference between a Christian
[53:36] and a non-Christian let's go from one
[53:38] extreme to another yes and it's simple
[53:41] and it's easy to see
[53:43] that there is no fear for God
[53:46] here there's fear of God and here there
[53:47] isn't fear of God
[53:52] mystery tank gives a definition of what
[53:54] it's like when there is no fear of God
[54:00] as it is written there is none righteous
[54:04] no not one
[54:06] there is none that understand it
[54:09] there is none that seek it after God
[54:12] they are all gone out the way
[54:15] they are together become unprofitable
[54:18] there is none that do with good no no
[54:21] not one
[54:24] your throw is an open support
[54:27] with their tongues they have used the
[54:29] seats
[54:30] the poison of asps
[54:32] it's under their lips
[54:36] is full of cursing and bitterness
[54:40] now I don't know if you've ever noticed
[54:42] someone like this out on the streets
[54:47] he says their feet are Swift to shed
[54:48] blood
[54:51] destruction and misery are in their ways
[54:54] and the way of Peace have they not known
[54:57] [Music]
[54:59] there is no fear of God before their
[55:01] eyes
[55:03] that's what it's like when there is no
[55:05] fear of God
[55:06] that's when you depart and you give your
[55:08] back to God
[55:10] because God is always looking to give us
[55:12] the opportunity
[55:13] but it seems like we turn our backs
[55:17] it seems like you don't want to have to
[55:18] but there's nothing they
[55:22] feels like God is a problem in your life
[55:24] I
[55:27] as we have we want nothing to do with
[55:29] God
[55:30] I believe that all of us at some point
[55:35] maybe today I don't want to go to church
[55:37] as young ones
[55:40] that we were given the invitations
[55:42] it's almost as it becomes a problem
[55:46] if I go to church
[55:48] now I have to do what they tell me
[55:54] the Bible says the laws
[55:57] you know that's that's really difficult
[55:58] and maybe I'll do it later
[56:01] that's because there is no fear of God
[56:04] that's why it's important to show our
[56:06] children
[56:07] to have that fear of God the importance
[56:10] of the fear of God so that it may go
[56:12] well it's something familiar
[56:16] if you instruct that little one
[56:19] you will receive all that blessing
[56:22] then he will disperse it to others as he
[56:25] develops and grows
[56:27] that's what God wants he wants to be
[56:29] that way it is like wisdom wisdom
[56:34] wisdom is for everyone else
[56:36] if you have wisdom it's you may help
[56:38] somebody else
[56:39] so let us continue
[56:44] Proverbs 16 6.
[56:49] the fear of God separates
[56:52] by Mercy and Truth
[56:54] iniquity is
[56:56] and by the fear of the Lord
[57:00] meant apart from Evil yeah
[57:03] in a certain occasions but is it
[57:09] it seems like at times we're just
[57:11] surrounded by evilness and we get
[57:13] contaminated
[57:14] but when there's fear of God
[57:19] they want themselves looks to depart
[57:20] themselves
[57:22] when something tells you to get away
[57:23] from that
[57:24] sometimes that's what we can't overcome
[57:28] as we speak on the topic of how can I
[57:30] overcome
[57:32] and it feels like we fail and fail and
[57:34] fail and we fail
[57:37] but it's because we have departed from
[57:39] the fear of God
[57:40] when the fear of God is inside
[57:44] then you look for the righteousness you
[57:46] look to do the goods
[57:48] you depart from the evil as much as you
[57:50] can
[57:51] I can't go to there because it doesn't
[57:54] mean no good I went apart from me I want
[57:56] nothing to do with it I'll just rather
[57:58] go over here I'm gonna hang out with
[58:00] so-and-so
[58:03] it's better for me to learn something
[58:04] good
[58:06] fellowship with the brothers at church I
[58:09] know that I will learn more I will learn
[58:12] more about the world
[58:14] hang out with the friends from back then
[58:17] I'm going to go back to the same things
[58:20] that's how that's how this goes
[58:23] with the fear of God men depart from
[58:26] evil
[58:30] Proverbs 3 7.
[58:33] he said
[58:34] opinion be not wise in thine own eyes
[58:38] fear the lord
[58:43] and it shall be healed to thy neighbor
[58:46] and Marrow to thy bones there is
[58:50] one Health you want healing
[58:54] that is
[58:58] because it says that is
[59:01] foreign
[59:37] I mean
[59:52] and I felt like my bones hurt
[59:56] all day my bones were hurting
[59:59] and you start thinking well I never get
[1:00:00] sick
[1:00:03] this is happening to me what is this
[1:00:09] I always make the sicknesses seem like
[1:00:11] they're smaller not so serious
[1:00:16] foreign
[1:00:54] foreign
[1:01:24] because God always gives us what we need
[1:01:27] this whatever book if God gives the
[1:01:28] desire of your heart
[1:01:30] what would you ask foreign
[1:02:04] he was talking about what he experienced
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:03:06] so
[1:03:35] you can ask for them
[1:04:04] very tremendous
[1:04:06] a
[1:04:11] brother Branson they're very rude
[1:04:13] they were they were they didn't
[1:04:16] released us they were very early
[1:04:20] they were there creating a
[1:04:23] being bad while brother Branham was
[1:04:24] there
[1:04:28] how you write her voice
[1:04:31] he says I asked for the Salvation of my
[1:04:34] children I asked for their salvation
[1:04:49] there were those two boys
[1:05:05] right and they were there with their
[1:05:07] sister Heidi rice
[1:05:13] they felt surrendered
[1:05:16] because the sister has spoken from her
[1:05:18] heart
[1:05:19] because you received the desire for her
[1:05:22] for having said the correct things when
[1:05:25] you have that fear of God you will speak
[1:05:28] the correct things God will recognize
[1:05:30] that
[1:05:31] and God will give you the desire of your
[1:05:33] heart
[1:05:36] sometimes we ask ourselves why don't
[1:05:38] these come out
[1:05:41] what I make put in the effort and
[1:05:43] teachers don't come out right I remember
[1:05:45] many years ago
[1:05:48] before giving myself to the Lord I would
[1:05:51] say about 15 years ago
[1:05:54] I worked a lot
[1:05:57] and I remember a lot about this
[1:06:01] my uh my ex-brother-in-law told me you
[1:06:04] should tell me
[1:06:06] say S
[1:06:09] I tell you that you're someone who's
[1:06:10] very uh in the center
[1:06:13] you're very in the middle centered well
[1:06:16] centered
[1:06:17] um
[1:06:18] he says you make good decisions you work
[1:06:22] hard
[1:06:23] take care of your family you almost
[1:06:25] don't go out
[1:06:27] yeah but things just don't go right and
[1:06:31] things don't go right for you you don't
[1:06:33] have anything
[1:06:35] and as friends just as friends
[1:06:44] I think you're cursed I think someone
[1:06:46] did something bad to you
[1:06:50] so I remember a lot of my brother Miguel
[1:06:56] and me and my Consciousness taking those
[1:06:58] words that he said
[1:07:00] I said no we know what's going on we
[1:07:04] already know what's going on
[1:07:07] we have departed from the fear of God we
[1:07:09] have Departed
[1:07:19] we're just to see what's going to happen
[1:07:28] we'll never reach the spot where we have
[1:07:30] to reach yes
[1:07:32] that is the way it is
[1:07:38] a very big difference when you place God
[1:07:41] first
[1:07:42] we return to God's path
[1:07:46] now all your decisions are based on that
[1:07:49] is
[1:07:52] and you begin to see how God moves
[1:07:56] there's a great need God provides
[1:08:04] gives you the protection
[1:08:08] more scriptures but my time is over
[1:08:12] God gives you rest
[1:08:15] it gives you the confidence and
[1:08:17] Assurance is
[1:08:20] quote just to finish
[1:08:25] God has gone the time has gone by really
[1:08:28] fast
[1:08:30] respects
[1:08:39] occasions
[1:08:43] if we're not careful
[1:08:46] we can be a stumbling Stone
[1:08:48] and that's not that's for not being
[1:08:50] careful with the fear of God for not
[1:08:52] taking care of ourselves
[1:08:55] so we take it lightly I'm talking about
[1:08:58] I'm talking about the Christians talking
[1:09:00] about us or our young ones
[1:09:06] we don't give you the seriousness it
[1:09:08] deserves
[1:09:12] and so that can affect somebody who's
[1:09:14] out there this is
[1:09:27] in the 13th verse it is written like
[1:09:30] this
[1:09:32] let us share the conclusion of the whole
[1:09:35] matter
[1:09:37] and keep his Commandments
[1:09:42] for this is the full duty of man
[1:09:45] there's a conclusion of everything
[1:09:48] fear God
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:10:22] yes the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:10:24] wisdom
[1:10:26] the fear of God is the beginning of
[1:10:28] wisdom
[1:10:30] no that's not don't mean that you're
[1:10:33] afraid of him
[1:10:34] but that means
[1:10:37] that you are giving him his respects and
[1:10:41] reverence
[1:10:42] and when you respect God
[1:10:45] you fear God
[1:10:52] you fear that you might displease him in
[1:10:54] some way I'm gonna repeat that he said
[1:11:04] you fear that you might displease him in
[1:11:06] some way
[1:11:07] we don't want to displace God we don't
[1:11:11] want to displease them we want to please
[1:11:12] him
[1:11:17] unless you would do something wrong
[1:11:19] it says you wouldn't want to
[1:11:23] says I fear my mother
[1:11:26] says I fear my wife
[1:11:28] I fear my church
[1:11:32] I fear all of God's servants
[1:11:37] unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:11:41] somewhere in their way
[1:11:44] and I fear the people
[1:11:47] I fear the people of the city
[1:11:51] unless I should do something wrong
[1:11:55] that we're cousin to think that I was
[1:11:58] Christian that is
[1:12:01] dangerous to possibly say well this
[1:12:03] isn't a Christian
[1:12:05] now we want the whole country
[1:12:16] heavenly father
[1:12:19] thank you for your word Lord
[1:12:22] thank you for your Holy Spirit
[1:12:28] it's a reminder Lord
[1:12:34] how to be better
[1:12:36] how to apply it to our lives
[1:12:39] and the benefits and blessings
[1:12:43] all your blessings and promises are
[1:12:45] based on faith
[1:12:47] and in the fear of God
[1:12:50] how we place it in our lives
[1:12:54] I give you thanks because you were clear
[1:12:55] in your words
[1:12:58] but now it's our decision
[1:13:02] to serve
[1:13:04] and to fear God
[1:13:07] thank you Lord for that
[1:13:09] and thank you
[1:13:11] which makes us recognize that you have
[1:13:14] brought us here
