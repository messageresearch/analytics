projected and he mentioned the project i'm not sure if you the same way no but my mind went wild thinking wow he's going to have a girl mementos you see i always wanted a baby girl never had a baby girl so when i see brothers with daughters that's one thing that helps yes that's what we need in reference to para referencia the pastor of the house or the dad el pastor de la casa the little girl will always comfort a daughter in the family and then my heart just started getting torn up i had to go back to what brother brenham said and brother brenham said mary maria was a carrier let me say it again mary maria was a carrier she carried a seed we know that that seed according to matthew that the angel came to speak to her and that angel was gabriel and gabriel told her you have found favor and you're going to have a child by the holy ghost she had to accept the fact yeah [Applause] that's what we need to understand we gotta act on that all of a sudden joseph jose he wanted to put her away privately i believe that's how the bible says son for that which she has conceived the people of their sins a carrier and when that baby when that seed and it came forth salia and the baby that baby didn't need from marriage alone we went to colombia that his wife was going to give or bring forth light yes that's what the baby girl is she's light i guess loose she lights that god would take care of uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna pray so i can get into my message but i did want you to know this message came to me so if you'll please stand with me we're going to pray we're going to read the scripture then i have a short message our heavenly father we thank you this morning i ask that you help us that you reveal through faith so father bless each person bless their efforts for being here protect them in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen uh turn with me we're we're still with the thought the whole plan of redemption continues hebrews 9 11 14. again the whole plan of redemption carrier carriers of the hour hebrews 9 11. but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building perfect neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god [Applause] thank you how many of us have faith you have faith raise your hand faith is a revelation without faith you can't [Applause] because it's a substance of things not substantial amen so we do have faith faith works through man some of us have great faith some of us have a little bit of faith of a mustard seed how many of us are anointed by a spirit by us we have to be his daughter was born if his daughter was born was she born with the spirit did the spirit come right after what is the same thing receive the spirit to have life can you say amen so we are aware that god gives us part of him when we're baptized of our salvation gives us just [Applause] [Applause] i have to leave the word of god and because the holy ghost will not be shamed with us that's as far as it goes okay that's as far as he goes he's waiting for the day that you and i keep studying sufficient faith how many of us are carriers if you're a carrier if you don't know what i mean you will today you see i i strongly believe that the first carriers during the time of noah there was a perverted carrier the carrier that was perverted and this morning when i was driving here i passed through dobbins and might have been 40 no 53rd avenue nothing but crawls all over the place every light pulse had a crow i don't know lamppost on both sides so then i started thinking wow here's the curl goes out sally it starts nibbling remember he's the carrier he sees a dead body possibly back to the ark when he was full of the dove the next carrier goes out sally and it brings the twig telling noah the other carrier and give bad news can you say amen again you gotta remember carriers this is what carriers do they carry a message in other words you know it's a delivery man get ups amazon they come in a truck they leave something ups and downs can you say a man do you know where i'm going what you ordered where's albert i want a real one to come up here you know they've got us come up here you know today in our society we have characters i mean this guy is i mean amazon amazon comes to my house i don't care what they do oh just wait for a minute right there all of a sudden they get a box they throw it by my door and then they take a picture then they said it's delivered they put it under trees take a picture come in a photo say it's delivered ups is the same way ups is lomismo sometimes they take it to my neighbor's house and they leave it so a carrier in our time what i believe the carrier was here's my carrier there you go put that on it matches your suit now the the good thing about this the bueno desta it has united states postal oh here's the mailman how many of you get mail so you already know what a mailman is he puts it in the box does it knock not okay just the livers in there okay tell me what the first one is get up here chewie what are you doing over there relaxing i want to relax too buddy all right a mailman or a carrier something i'll go to somebody else so let me check this out before a carrier a person carrying information to another person that's what a carrier is important thank you now let's start with ernie montoya and you're going to need that it says department of records maricopa county department of the records phoenix arizona phoenix montoya montoya that's the address direction and back it says bad news behind on your property that and it has the address on here direction is this good news or bad news i don't have the money what are they going to do they're going to take it same thing with your car good news bad news recall a recall we all get a notice notification now brother trini open your envelope yes [Laughter] all right that's one thing in my name big or small and you shall have it what you want see he didn't look at everything no open it now john 14 14 if you ask anything my name i'll do it in me and signed by read the back i'm sorry dad i'm getting old did i hear or didn't i hear this i don't check it i think it was a cheque anything in my name big or small big or and he gave this is from arizona health department you need to get a booster shot is he going to believe it what happens if he doesn't get a booster booster from jesus christ heaven 77 77. you are my son and i'm well pleased could you imagine that receiving stuff from a carrier that notice that information you're a son of god god is well pleased you're invited to the wedding of the lab what more they want to carry your brain to you say that you're invited but if he doesn't accept it he doesn't believe [Applause] is that what it is this message is so simple it shouldn't go over our heads so then we are carriers we're carrying information to another it's going to put a smile on people can you say it man they're all over the place symptoms synthomas something that indicates the existence of something else physical or spiritual existence physical or spiritual do you understand what that means brother brenham said on tongues the gospel must go to all the world and it struck the whole world at that time is that what the bible says the known world right there it had to come like that because see all nations under heaven were gathered there in jerusalem what did he say wait until and he struck the whole world [Applause] the gospel to allah and they shall receive the power of the holy ghost do you believe that everybody accepted it do everybody [Applause] good ones and bad ones buenos aires but go into all the world so it had to be testified in language of the resurrection of christ so it would go to all the world right there what language do you speak if you speak spanish you go to a spanish country i could understand the language is that right what it's telling me you become a carrier me and these carriers here these people here in other words not the people in jerusalem would shoulder or the head of the people um a carrier nothing more not a must but a carrier that's what we say we carry a message we carry good news so if we believe that we're carriers of this great message what are we doing i came from the world i didn't know anything about this bible then i had to sit down because a lot of times i have nothing but a denomination in me one man can become a nation so all of a sudden i had to go back in my mind back when i was young i got a scholarship i had a scholarship to a private college so i was doing graduate work well the first thing i do is took my briefcase in my briefcase just so you know god saved me god took everything out of me and i was the smoker and the first thing open my briefcase i had a pant two pencils any of those lapis tablet my cigarettes and i was gonna smoke in class because when i went to school when they finished well i had i was very poor in those days so i sat next to some people they were eating they offered me some some of their food you need to dress up i would scratch my head and say what did i get into yo so then the first thing i go to class you have to take a religious class so in order for me to get this scholarship back then they didn't give scholarships to hispanics really really know what you were doing so all of a sudden i'm is everything that you're going to need for that course his travels the journeys that he made well i was a fan i was a bluffer i mean i'd read a little bit and had my own interpretation because that was it okay i said i'm not going to read yeah i'm going to read all basically what paul wrote in his book and know everything about it let me tell you that wasn't my way of thinking when i came into the message i left that i forgot all about it but what happens when you go to colleges private colleges that are religious colleges i think they had one ad night at phoenix tabernacle so people could get their degrees and all that helping individuals so all of a sudden i'm in the message and then i i'm thinking what brother branham said well the baptists believe this way and the methodists believe this the lutherans believe this what's god going to judge yeah and i thank god that god sent us a carrier his name william merriam william branham because all of a sudden this bible here came real a carrier [Applause] i thank god for what he's done because they broke it down this is where's the mailman he just knocked away they're fast they put their mail out so where's that mail carrier well we're waiting for the carrier good news oh okay carrier come up here i'm sorry i know you're busy and you had all those streets to cover you got to give all those jews you're limited in time i want you to look at them i want you to look at them i want you to look at them and do me a favor because this is important we're carriers my question to him is very simple did somebody just put a bag over you i'm gonna say go on were you trained carriers learning in order to be a carrier [Applause] what did they do discipline disciplina we're learning to obey rules you need to be was that a class in a class yeah it was a training academy training academy an academy in the academy they would teach you respect we honor those that we should honor is that what the bible tells were you devoted to your job are you happy with your route is there a better route than yours i have a very good route i am happy on my route well there's people that are carriers well that guy sent me to san luis obispo i want you to sit right over there he sent me to san luis obispo i didn't want to go to san luis obispo lines are long la liga and you you never go anywhere how many of you still want to be carriers to go where no man wants to go what you really don't want to do the hardest training i had how many carriers all right let me bring up another example mexico mexico lindo querido no dos no if you've heard that if you never heard that name raise your hand a person that paved the way now this is a character that he had the only thing i remember a great cooking there's his daughter wasn't he a great ghost raise your hand well you were small though to you brother garcia amano garcia never talked it was brother anaya yes or no no no no who talked brother bernie i want you to tell them again obedience brother anaya never said a word in come on you got to be with me i'm real fast he could not say a word unless brother the person that he was with [Applause] i don't say it just to say no but i'm going to tell you this don't ever cross him brother because he was the type of person more or less he told you one and one is 2. i need for you to understand god's men are trained you got to be trained before you can be a carrier [Applause] is i'll pick it up next week i believe the church we need cross training de la cruz listen to what
