[18:37] is
[18:45] [Music]
[18:58] [Music]
[19:03] [Music]
[19:33] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[19:35] present time are not worthy to be
[19:37] compared with the glory which shall be
[19:39] revealed in us
[19:40] for the earnest expectation of the
[19:42] creature waited for the manifestation of
[19:44] the sons of god
[19:47] matthew 17
[19:51] [Music]
[20:43] after six days jesus taketh peter james
[20:45] and john his brother and bring them up
[20:47] into a high mountain apart
[20:49] and was transfigured before them and his
[20:51] face did shine as a sun and his raiment
[20:53] as white as a light
[20:55] and behold there appeared unto them
[20:57] moses and elijah
[20:58] talking with him
[21:00] then answered peter and said unto jesus
[21:02] lord it is good for us to be here if thy
[21:05] will
[21:05] let us make here three tabernacles one
[21:08] for thee one for moses and one for elias
[21:11] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[21:14] overshadowed them and behold the voice
[21:16] out of the cloud which said this is my
[21:18] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[21:25] we welcome each one of you
[21:36] him
[21:37] [Music]
[21:49] they ever
[21:55] [Music]
[22:09] [Applause]
[22:11] [Music]
[22:19] says
[22:21] [Music]
[22:32] my soul
[22:40] stillness
[22:45] [Music]
[23:07] i'm going to continue on the same
[23:08] subject that we've been on that's a
[23:09] letter to the romans number 26.
[23:20] and it's a subtitle this is the sixth
[23:22] message on the manifestation of the sons
[23:24] of god
[23:31] i'd like to review a little bit what we
[23:32] talked about last sunday but
[23:57] this is the first diagram and if you
[23:59] would open up with me to
[24:01] genesis chapter three 3
[24:13] we're going to summarize and remember
[24:15] where was the first throne
[24:30] here we are in
[24:43] we see three very important characters
[24:46] in the garden of eden
[24:54] we see that the garden of eden was god's
[24:56] headquarters
[25:19] and we said last sunday that both man
[25:21] and woman were cast out of the garden
[25:26] but before they were cast out
[25:31] we see that the serpent was subject to
[25:33] the man
[25:35] is that right
[25:58] and the lord god said behold the man has
[26:00] become as one of us to know good and
[26:02] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[26:04] and take also of the tree of life and
[26:06] eat and live forever
[26:14] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[26:16] from the garden of eden to till the
[26:18] ground from whence he was taken
[26:22] i
[26:34] but the man and the woman were brought
[26:36] forth from from the garden of eden
[26:41] so in the second diagram
[26:50] we put here three things also hey
[26:55] jesus
[26:59] and the disciples uh
[27:06] we know already that both judas and
[27:08] jesus were
[27:09] twins
[27:13] so there are the three characters
[27:17] and inside that circle
[27:23] the god's children found themselves
[27:25] outside that circle
[27:30] god had already thrown them cast them
[27:32] out
[27:53] now to prove that let's look at hebrews
[27:54] chapter 13.
[27:57] in verse 12.
[28:18] wherefore jesus also that he might
[28:20] sanctify the people with his own blood
[28:22] suffered without the gate
[28:25] jesus
[28:28] so we see that jesus went out of the
[28:30] camp
[28:38] he went there to a place that was called
[28:40] the skull golgotha ortega
[29:00] [Music]
[29:24] i call
[29:37] [Music]
[29:46] now the third circle
[30:01] we see that this is during the period of
[30:02] the seven church ages
[30:05] encounters
[30:55] [Music]
[31:45] something for the new people
[31:49] when i when i say if you do you
[31:51] understand me say amen
[31:55] i'm not asking you if are you in
[31:57] agreement with me say amen
[32:31] one of you believers can answer me from
[32:32] the audience and say when did this cloud
[32:35] appear
[32:37] raise your hand
[33:08] uh
[33:14] [Laughter]
[34:10] it says there and out of his mouth go
[34:12] with a sharp sword that with it he
[34:14] should smite the nations out of his
[34:16] mouth like from god's mouth to moses's
[34:47] there's two main things that i want you
[34:48] to notice
[34:53] and we can open our bibles to see the
[34:54] first one juan diaz saint john chapter
[34:57] ten
[35:10] what comes out of god's mouth
[35:28] first of all it's a sharp sword and a
[35:29] sharp sword is the word
[35:32] what comes out of god's mouth
[35:36] okay
[35:40] once again what comes out of god's mouth
[35:54] where does it go
[36:23] jesus answered them is it not written in
[36:25] your law i said ye are gods
[36:37] if he called them gods and to whom the
[36:39] word of god came and the script
[36:40] scripture cannot be broken
[36:47] the prophet
[36:48] says the word comes to the prophet
[36:51] word comes to the prophets
[37:20] with
[38:00] from the dead
[38:41] a little item
[38:58] uh
[39:12] and bring under subjection
[39:16] [Music]
[39:18] how many of you want to exercise that
[39:19] word in your life
[39:21] [Music]
[39:23] we all want to be lords
[39:25] of
[39:28] want to be partakers of that
[39:30] word that was foreign
[39:32] to be lords
[39:34] to subdue who you got let me have the
[39:36] meaning and subdue yeah
[39:49] [Music]
[40:08] was brought so that we could to take us
[40:11] back to the beginning
[40:14] so this is the thought that i'm bringing
[40:18] the first thing we should have to bring
[40:19] on this objection
[40:21] or subdue
[40:37] another millionaire
[40:38] for something else
[40:42] we have to subjugate subdue ourselves
[40:46] bring this body under subjection
[41:18] its order
[41:21] and the first thing we have to subdue
[41:24] garcia myself
[41:28] to be able to be used
[42:00] is
[42:29] the pastor and then the sheep
[42:35] number two
[42:39] everything is scaling up
[42:41] start at the bottom
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] second third and then we're going to get
[42:48] to the fourth step
[43:08] the prophet shepard
[43:10] el propheta
[43:16] and then the sheep
[43:34] how many of you believe that god through
[43:36] the prophet of this age is a prophet
[43:38] pastor
[43:52] number three
[43:55] jesus
[43:57] shepherd
[43:58] jesus
[44:06] jesus then halfway under jesus
[44:17] jesus
[44:19] jesus shepherd and then sheep
[44:28] number four
[44:30] god the holy spirit
[44:47] don't be afraid to answer if you know
[45:42] who gives birth to sheep
[45:44] el pastor
[46:26] is
[47:08] so the prophet pastor of everybody
[47:13] so all the believers pastor
[47:15] [Music]
[47:17] william is god through william brown
[47:20] is that right
[47:22] no but notice
[47:33] a lot of people say well my pastor is
[47:35] william branham
[48:41] is
[49:04] how was it then that if he was a prophet
[49:05] pastor of this age
[49:07] the shepherd
[49:45] because even though there is a sheep
[49:46] that give the wolf
[49:48] and they also give birth to elk
[49:51] is the prophet shepard
[49:56] and he was also subject to jesus
[49:59] the shepherd
[50:01] is that right
[50:05] and jesus
[50:08] god in flesh
[50:21] because many people jump on the local
[50:22] pastor over jump over
[50:35] [Music]
[50:52] shepherd he gives his life for the sheep
[50:55] and i'm going to give his life for the
[50:56] sheep
[50:58] he took the place as a lamb
[51:02] so he also was a lamb
[51:05] he gave his life entonces
[52:03] to exercise
[52:07] i'm going to go back to the cloud
[52:09] have you understood so far
[52:13] how many want authority
[52:24] a lot of people say well if they made me
[52:25] do you can i straighten out the thing
[52:26] right away
[52:54] i've placed the cloud here
[53:12] a
[53:40] oh i know that when you say that a lot
[53:43] of people think boy he's crazy
[53:51] and i i know that they have a right to
[53:53] believe like that
[54:07] and as i think that i come to that
[54:08] conclusion
[54:50] the
[55:31] is
[56:56] he thinks he's going to win the battle
[57:24] but
[57:49] of revelation
[57:58] [Music]
[58:25] [Music]
[58:59] [Music]
[59:18] [Music]
[59:24] you
