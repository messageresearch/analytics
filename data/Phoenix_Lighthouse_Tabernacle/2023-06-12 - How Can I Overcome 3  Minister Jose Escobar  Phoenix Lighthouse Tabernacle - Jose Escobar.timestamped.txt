[33:19] God bless you Brothers
[33:20] it's in order to be here in the house of
[33:23] the Lord
[33:24] and we have to be here this evening
[33:29] happy to be here it'll be so kind of
[33:31] please open up your scriptures
[33:35] I will be going to Revelations 3 21.
[33:40] [Music]
[33:43] and uh as we're getting looking for our
[33:45] scriptures first I'd like to thank our
[33:48] pastor for this honor
[33:50] says
[33:56] it's in order to be up here you know
[33:58] it's a great responsibility
[34:01] so I'm going to try my best to do what I
[34:03] can
[34:06] and I'm also very thankful with the Lord
[34:09] yesterday was my birthday so
[34:14] um I guess this is my present
[34:17] but I'm happy that he's granted me
[34:20] another year of life
[34:24] uh yesterday
[34:26] uh we could go to the scripture
[34:29] and the scripture reads the scripture
[34:31] reads
[34:33] to him that overcome it will I grant to
[34:35] sin with me in my throne even as I also
[34:37] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[34:39] in his throne
[34:40] series
[34:50] dear heavenly father no we thank you for
[34:53] the great privilege of allowing us to be
[34:54] here once again
[34:58] we're so thankful and we're so blessed
[35:00] Lord
[35:02] and we thank you for everything you're
[35:04] doing
[35:05] everything you've done
[35:08] and everything you will do
[35:10] you annoying my lips
[35:13] after you anoint the ears of the people
[35:15] listening
[35:17] whether they be here or watching online
[35:22] tries to help me and my interpreter as
[35:24] well
[35:27] yeah so ask you all these things the
[35:29] person in the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:35] So based on the scripture
[35:38] we're going to be continuing with the
[35:40] topic of how can I overcome
[35:43] it's a very great topic
[35:47] I enjoy hearing each of the brothers
[35:49] that come up here
[35:52] and listening to the different
[35:54] approaches to that topic
[35:59] I feel like As an interpreter myself
[36:02] I feel that I have someone of an
[36:05] advantage
[36:06] you know I get to stand up here and
[36:08] listen every word right next to them
[36:12] so I feel like I can capture everything
[36:15] so to me it's truly a benefit
[36:19] so how can I overcome
[36:22] how can I be an overcomer how can we be
[36:26] Overcomers
[36:27] you know and we know the definitions
[36:32] we have to stand the test
[36:34] but we also have to recognize the devil
[36:36] in every one of his tricks
[36:40] and I've said it before and it sounds
[36:43] really simple so yes and see you but in
[36:45] order to be an overcomer you have to
[36:48] have something to overcome
[36:50] and so we have to recognize that we're
[36:54] going to be tested you know this is a
[36:57] thought I had in my mind
[36:59] and our pastor church on just a little
[37:02] bit this morning
[37:04] yeah you know we're expected to be
[37:06] tested
[37:09] so I have a quote here from brother
[37:11] Brandon
[37:12] it's from the message how can I overcome
[37:15] and it reads like this he says now we're
[37:19] expected to be tested
[37:21] he says that's a good lesson for my
[37:23] brother way back there also yes
[37:29] must first be tested
[37:32] this is tested with what
[37:34] he says with the word he says that's
[37:38] God's test
[37:39] he says do you believe it
[37:42] says
[37:47] that only shows a true child then C be
[37:50] tested
[37:54] and when the test comes on you you can't
[37:57] overcome unless there's a test to give
[37:59] to you is
[38:02] [Music]
[38:04] and when the test is given it's to see
[38:07] whether you're overcome or not
[38:12] and Jesus said to him that overcometh
[38:15] the test Jesus
[38:17] and see here he gives us a kid it's
[38:20] something that might be difficult to
[38:21] understand
[38:24] but something that we know we have to
[38:26] know
[38:27] and he says the test is the greatest
[38:30] thing that ever happened to you
[38:34] that right there might be something
[38:36] difficult to accept yeah
[38:39] because maybe you've had all sorts of
[38:41] tests
[38:42] so you're thinking that moment of pain
[38:57] you're telling me that that's the best
[38:59] thing that ever happened to me
[39:01] and it is he says the test is the
[39:04] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[39:07] but why is it so great in case it's
[39:10] those tests that mold us into a better
[39:14] Persona you know they build our
[39:16] character
[39:17] we can become a better person through
[39:20] those tests
[39:26] he's talking about Jesus Christ
[39:29] he says he made himself like us
[39:32] that we may be made like him
[39:35] I believe that's what the tests are
[39:37] foreign
[39:44] Peter said that our Charles are worth
[39:47] more to us than precious gold is
[39:57] it's a testing time
[40:00] and here is another key
[40:03] uh
[40:04] he's talking about the test he says it's
[40:08] one good evidence to us that God is with
[40:11] us
[40:16] he says when we're tested for
[40:19] alternative God are tested and tried
[40:25] so that might sound tough yes
[40:29] but there should be some comfort in
[40:31] there
[40:34] um
[40:34] that if you're having a hard time
[40:40] that's evidence that God is with you
[40:44] and like Peter said
[40:47] our trials are worth more than precious
[40:49] gold
[40:51] Orofino so if you have trials
[41:07] he says it's a promise God made the
[41:09] promise
[41:11] he says let's stay with it
[41:14] said God promised it no matter if you've
[41:17] got to have a battle yes
[41:22] he said if everything comes lazy why
[41:25] you're what are you overcoming
[41:30] since they overcome by the word of God
[41:33] and their testimony the blood of
[41:39] Christo and here once again going back
[41:41] to an order of being Overcomer you have
[41:43] to have something to overcome
[41:46] he says you've got to overcome something
[41:48] and you have to have some obstacles yes
[41:54] and people are different and fuzz with
[41:56] you and tell you you're a Holy Roller
[41:58] and things of that that's put before you
[42:00] it's a trial is
[42:10] it's a trial
[42:12] and here he says
[42:14] he says if you haven't got that
[42:17] says then you're not even in the battle
[42:21] so here we have both sides of it
[42:24] see if you're in if you have trials
[42:29] then you know God is with you
[42:32] but if you don't have any obstacles
[42:35] everything is easy then you're not even
[42:38] in the battle
[42:39] so that's something we have to realize
[42:42] you know that's where we at we're in a
[42:44] battlefield that is
[42:47] you know a battlefield is not a nice
[42:49] place
[42:51] we're very difficult it's where people
[42:54] lose their lives
[42:56] you know just this week is
[42:58] June 6th and it says it's what they call
[43:01] D-Day you send it
[43:03] which is you know it commemorates from
[43:06] when the the Allied troops uh went to
[43:08] the beach of Normandy in France
[43:13] during the World War II and then
[43:16] you know and it was a very important
[43:18] battle
[43:20] and brother Branham talks about that
[43:22] battle yeah
[43:23] and he says that if it wasn't for that
[43:25] battle is
[43:30] there would be no Victory Day
[43:33] Victoria that we have to understand
[43:36] that in order for us to have a victory
[43:38] day
[43:39] we have to have a D-Day as well
[43:43] it's you know thousands of soldiers lost
[43:45] their lives
[43:47] but if it was necessary in order to win
[43:49] that war but
[43:52] so you know we're going to be tested
[43:54] you know and something that I've been
[43:57] doing more often who I'm trying to do
[44:01] um
[44:02] you know get more familiarized with
[44:05] stories of the Bible
[44:08] you know I know stories from when I was
[44:10] a child
[44:11] you know but I've never gone back and
[44:13] truly examined them
[44:16] and so going back to you know God is
[44:20] with you in your trials and tests
[44:24] and so one story I was reading earlier
[44:26] this week
[44:30] you know it's the story of the Three
[44:32] young Hebrews
[44:35] and you know that one can be found in
[44:37] Daniel 3. of course
[44:41] you know I won't be reading it I'll just
[44:43] be telling the story
[44:46] you know and you you know the story
[44:48] maybe many of you may know it
[44:50] you know there was a king Nebuchadnezzar
[44:53] is
[44:54] when he created this large statue of
[44:57] gold
[45:00] and then he made Allah he says that
[45:03] whenever you would hear a thing a horn
[45:05] or a flute
[45:09] yeah
[45:10] when you hear the music throughout the
[45:12] day
[45:14] it meant you had a drop down and worship
[45:16] this statue
[45:20] and so he made it Allah
[45:22] and most people obeyed
[45:25] but there was three people who did it
[45:29] so one of these men
[45:31] he was a citizen
[45:34] he went and he told Nebuchadnezzar is
[45:38] he said there's these three Jewish young
[45:41] men
[45:43] who do not pray to your statue
[45:50] that was
[45:53] and that's that's the three Hebrew men
[45:55] yes and so as The Story Goes the king
[45:59] gets angry
[46:00] and he calls them in and so they go and
[46:04] they bring them into into where the king
[46:05] is
[46:07] and he tells them is this true is
[46:10] and you know he says can your God
[46:12] deliver you from the punishment you'll
[46:14] received
[46:17] because part the punishment for not
[46:20] worshiping the statue
[46:23] you would get thrown inside a furnace
[46:27] and so that's what they did to the three
[46:29] young men
[46:30] and you know and the King was so angry
[46:34] that he wanted he asked for the furnace
[46:36] to burn seven times hotter okay
[46:40] and then they tied up the young men yeah
[46:44] they send them into the furnace but when
[46:48] you read the scripture
[46:50] the man that delivers them to the
[46:52] furnace
[46:54] the two men that were the men that were
[46:57] with them
[46:58] it was so hot that they died from it
[47:04] you know in the Scripture it says that
[47:06] they weren't just any men
[47:08] the king chose his mightiest man
[48:07] and at that moment
[48:10] you know he was impacted
[48:12] because they were inside and they
[48:15] weren't binded no more
[48:17] they were walking freely
[48:20] so he went and he called him to come out
[48:24] and the interesting part is
[48:26] you know when they came out not a single
[48:30] hair and their body was burnt
[48:32] you know and I think about when you
[48:34] stand around the fire
[48:36] you could be there for a couple minutes
[48:38] you know and your clothes starts to
[48:40] smell like the fire is
[48:45] and then it's like really hard to get
[48:47] off yes
[48:48] but the scripture says that even the
[48:51] smell of fire wasn't on them
[48:55] no that's the God we serve
[48:58] you know I believe
[49:00] that God could have turned off the fire
[49:02] because
[49:04] he could have destroyed the furnace
[49:08] but that would be removing the test
[49:12] instead of in this he was there with him
[49:16] in the test
[49:17] and he delivered them
[49:20] because God never promised that there
[49:22] wouldn't be tests
[49:26] but he promised that he'd be there with
[49:28] us
[49:30] and so then why do we want to overcome
[49:32] transport as we've spoken before
[49:36] no there's a reward for the Overcomer
[49:40] as we were in the scripture you know
[49:43] it's to sit with me in my throne
[49:46] and you know that's the reward for the
[49:48] Overcomer of laodicea this is
[49:52] because as you read in Revelations
[49:56] no every age has Overcomers
[49:59] in every age has a reward
[50:02] but we get the greatest reward of all of
[50:05] all of them
[50:08] and the question is why do we get the
[50:10] greatest rewards
[50:13] here you know this is the message how
[50:16] can I overcome
[50:18] he says we see this age that we're
[50:20] living in
[50:22] he says it's one of the grandest ages of
[50:25] all ages
[50:28] he says
[50:31] because it's the ending of time in the
[50:34] blending of Eternity
[50:37] is
[50:45] the greatest sinful age is
[50:48] he says it's more sin in this age that
[50:51] there's ever been
[50:53] instead
[50:55] he says and the powers of Satan is many
[50:58] times harder to fight against than it
[50:59] was in any age
[51:07] so why are we getting the greatest
[51:09] reward
[51:35] you know so he's you know sometimes he
[51:37] think you know he he knows how great we
[51:39] are
[51:41] you know but we don't recognize it you
[51:45] know and I'll say that for myself you
[51:47] know no one bullies Joe
[51:50] like Joe bullies Joe come on
[51:54] my worst my worst critico critical no I
[51:59] bully myself
[52:01] I want to say that everybody in here
[52:03] you're all great

[52:29] brother gives us the example of the
[52:30] apple tree
[52:33] he says you know every fruit or every
[52:36] Apple it will ever give fruit
[52:38] is already inside that seed yesterday so
[52:42] whatever yield will be it's already
[52:45] inside you just started you know we're
[52:48] talking maybe in your career maybe in
[52:51] school but Also spiritually what a real
[52:54] B is already within you yes
[52:57] these little passes I would like to read
[53:01] you know brother Brandon here you know
[53:03] he talks about a Lily
[53:06] and it's a really nice story that I'd
[53:08] like to read
[53:20] he says where a lily I think is one of
[53:23] the most prettiest flowers that there is
[53:30] he says I'm very fond of those great
[53:32] calla lilies and pond lilies
[53:38] he says I think there's nothing hardly
[53:40] as pretty as great big Pond Lily call it
[53:43] a water lily karaoke
[53:51] he says how it's radiance
[53:56] now he says now where does it come from
[53:59] he says it's a little seed it says down
[54:03] in the bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond
[54:07] he says in that little city yet all the
[54:10] ratings that will ever shine in it is in
[54:12] it right then is
[54:40] in that slime that it's living in yeah
[54:43] it presses its way through the mud the
[54:45] mug in the waters
[54:53] in the waters in the stagnant places
[54:58] until
[55:00] it sticks its head above in the light
[55:03] and expresses what's been hidden it all
[55:05] the time
[55:12] says I think that's the Overcomer yeah
[55:17] they were once in sin
[55:20] um
[55:21] they did the things that were wrong
[55:23] he says don't worry about it now
[55:26] he says once did things that was wrong
[55:29] then now why look back into the pond
[55:31] again
[55:37] look you have God by his predestination
[55:39] see he has brought his seed to life and
[55:42] is pressing itself
[55:46] [Music]
[55:53] it's pressing itself coming to life
[55:56] this is and now on top of Ali has
[55:59] overcome foreign
[56:45] he says amen amen he says you can't now
[56:49] point back to where he was
[56:53] on top
[56:55] so maybe if you ever found yourself in
[56:57] that situation
[57:01] or maybe you feel like you're there
[57:02] right now
[57:06] you're in the mud yeah on a logo but
[57:10] you're rising up little by little
[57:12] brothers
[57:13] You're striving
[57:16] you'll get higher and higher until you
[57:19] stick your head out
[57:20] and you express who you really are you
[57:22] express
[57:23] so how do we come how do we overcome in
[57:26] our age
[57:29] we have to have the word Innes
[57:33] so then how do we overcome
[57:35] you know it's not us but it's the word
[57:39] inside of us
[57:40] because the word is God
[57:43] so we overcome the things of the world
[57:46] because it's the world in it's the word
[57:49] in us
[57:51] because like we said before
[57:54] you know Jesus was the perfect example
[57:57] Jesus and brother Brandon talks about
[58:00] how Satan had three major assaults on
[58:02] him
[58:20] so that's how we overcome yes we use the
[58:24] word we also use the weapons that we
[58:27] have as Christians
[58:30] so what weapons do we have as Christians
[58:33] but we have the Holy Spirit
[58:35] we have the word of God
[58:37] we have prayer and we have love more and
[58:42] then right now you know if you feel like
[58:44] you're struggling
[58:45] you just gotta keep pushing
[58:48] you know what I can say is you know
[58:52] don't leave God you know if or if you
[58:55] feel like you've left God is
[58:59] you just have to go back to where you
[59:01] left him
[59:03] you know and this and I'll be finishing
[59:05] with this and this is a story I've said
[59:08] before this one is and it's a story that
[59:10] I really like
[59:11] brother Benham says it several times
[59:15] and I believe um brother Bernie mentions
[59:17] in identification
[59:22] you know it's about a chaplain
[59:26] you know who find herself with a captain
[59:30] you know who was at War you know he got
[59:33] injured
[59:35] and he was about to die and so the
[59:38] chaplain went over to him and you know
[59:41] he asked him he said sir are you a
[59:43] Christian senores Cristiano and the
[59:46] captain says
[59:48] he says I once was
[59:50] in the chaplain Assam he says how long
[59:54] have you been backslidden
[1:00:09] where did you leave him alone and he was
[1:00:12] struggling
[1:00:14] and at the same time you know the blood
[1:00:16] was over was filling his lungs
[1:00:19] and so the chaplain told him
[1:00:22] you better think fast
[1:00:24] and he said what can I do yes
[1:00:28] he says go right back to where you left
[1:00:31] him
[1:00:31] he says and begin right there he says
[1:00:35] that's where you'll find him
[1:00:37] he says where you left him
[1:00:39] and the the captain you know he just
[1:00:43] laid there for a moment
[1:00:45] and he was struggling but then a smile
[1:00:49] came across his face
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:54] then he said
[1:00:56] and then the the chaplain song will
[1:00:58] start right there
[1:01:00] and then he said
[1:01:02] it says now I lay me down to sleep I
[1:01:04] pray the Lord my soul to keep if I
[1:01:06] should die before I wake I pray the Lord
[1:01:08] of my soul to take yes
[1:01:19] and when he said that is
[1:01:28] and if you don't know that prayer
[1:01:31] it's I think it's a it's a prayer a
[1:01:34] night prayer that they I think it's from
[1:01:35] the 18th century is
[1:01:40] that what kids would say before they go
[1:01:42] to sleep
[1:01:46] where did he leave God
[1:01:49] said back in the Cradle
[1:01:51] he said on the knees of his mother
[1:01:55] but he was able to go back to where he
[1:01:57] left them this is
