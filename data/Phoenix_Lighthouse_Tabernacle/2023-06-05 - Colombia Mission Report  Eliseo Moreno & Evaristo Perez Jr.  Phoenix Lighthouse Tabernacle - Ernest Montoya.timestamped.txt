[22:26] myself to have a branded but there's one
[22:29] thing I do for getting those things
[22:31] which are behind and Reaching Forward
[22:32] onto those things which are before press
[22:34] towards the mark for the price of the
[22:36] High Calling of God in Jesus in Christ
[22:38] Jesus
[22:39] you may take your seeds Brothers
[22:45] as you all know
[22:48] um
[22:51] the last week I think so uh
[23:00] um
[23:06] we visit our brothers who are over there
[23:10] and this time Brothers
[23:14] I think that because my brother didn't
[23:16] go with me
[23:19] [Music]
[23:20] I had to speak on Wednesday
[23:25] and also on Thursday so
[23:28] um
[23:31] and so my nerves were going crazy
[23:35] but thanks to God
[23:38] the work was done
[23:50] [Music]
[24:03] [Music]
[24:35] to put all things aside
[24:38] and focus on one thing
[24:50] sometimes many times problems come
[25:19] what the Lord wants us to understand
[25:23] I believe that it happens to many of us
[25:27] but the most important thing of all
[25:29] please
[25:39] [Music]
[26:05] [Music]
[26:19] the youth is
[26:23] something I wanted to prepare them
[26:27] there was an activity of great
[26:29] importance
[26:33] but this activity wasn't going to happen
[26:35] until Saturday
[26:39] but I wanted to prepare them for that
[26:41] activity
[26:43] and so what I did is
[26:46] we place ourselves in a circle
[26:52] and we started talking one with another
[26:57] things such as how we are and other
[26:59] stuff
[27:04] I mentioned to them one thing
[27:08] I told them on Saturday
[27:13] we'll be taking we'll be doing an
[27:15] activity
[27:16] and what I want you to do
[27:18] is
[27:20] within yourself
[27:23] I said I don't know what you're going
[27:25] through
[27:38] what's something that you've been
[27:40] struggling with
[27:43] for one reason or another
[27:47] you haven't been able to overcome that
[27:50] is
[27:59] and thereafter singing and doing other
[28:01] activities
[28:03] I left I left them with that
[28:07] is
[28:15] the picture showing we had a men's
[28:17] meeting
[28:18] uh
[28:48] [Laughter]
[28:54] I didn't feel so much that he
[28:57] but
[29:17] I was able to see here foreign
[29:58] [Laughter]
[30:04] but thank God it was it informed my lot
[30:06] to speak
[30:07] [Music]
[30:08] I believe I believe was the one who
[30:11] spoke
[30:12] and afterwards our pastor spoke
[30:17] truly there was a jubilee is
[30:23] God manifests himself in a very great
[30:25] way
[30:26] is
[30:29] what they came looking for
[30:57] and he did a prayer
[31:00] and God did the work
[31:10] we wanted to start with the activity
[31:14] is the
[31:15] um
[31:18] [Music]
[31:20] I wanted to let them Let it Loose a bit
[31:25] [Music]
[31:30] if you continue with the presentation
[31:32] there's a picture of where some of the
[31:34] young people are playing a game
[31:38] and what happened here is
[31:42] we had plans to do it outside
[31:46] what happened is it started raining
[31:49] [Music]
[31:50] in our pasture parade
[31:53] and the rain went away is
[31:59] since we were already inside the
[32:01] sanctuary
[32:02] we did an activity
[32:08] you have to stack up a tower
[32:14] the youth was really excited is the
[32:18] competition
[32:19] competing one against another yes so it
[32:23] was very beautiful to see that
[32:28] then came to what we went there for
[32:32] um
[32:33] what I asked them to do is
[32:38] a piece of paper
[32:42] with a lead pencil or a pen
[32:44] is
[32:51] there was more youth that I spoke on
[32:53] last time and Don says
[32:56] so I told them once again
[33:02] he says I want everybody who's in the
[33:04] sanctuary
[33:06] says look for a corner
[33:13] with your arm length away is the Delta
[33:16] Persona from another person
[33:18] is
[33:21] the reason is that I want you to see
[33:23] what the other person is going to write
[33:24] down
[33:35] within yourself
[33:40] um
[33:47] I don't want you to just think like oh
[33:49] maybe I don't have such a good
[33:50] friendship with so and so no no no
[33:52] I want you to go deeper than that
[33:58] I want you within yourself
[34:02] look for that
[34:05] which for you have cried for night after
[34:08] night yeah and you have asked foreign
[34:19] and you feel like there's no solution
[34:26] I want you to write that down on the
[34:28] paper
[34:29] this is
[34:38] if you could feel what I felt in that
[34:40] sanctuary
[34:42] it was very impactful
[34:46] this was
[34:48] after everyone finished what they were
[34:50] writing down
[34:52] um
[34:55] uh
[35:12] for them
[35:13] I asked the brother to start a fire is
[35:17] because we're going to go outside
[35:27] we're going to make marshmallows or
[35:29] s'mores outside
[35:33] that's not what we're going to do with
[35:34] the fire
[35:36] um
[35:38] so I asked everybody does everybody have
[35:40] their piece of paper
[35:42] um
[35:45] [Music]
[35:46] and this one
[36:40] [Music]
[36:46] and we attached a piece of paper that
[36:48] explained
[36:52] and the youth were very thankful
[36:55] um
[36:56] you can go to the next one
[36:58] um here's a video
[37:01] foreign
[37:48] as they put it in the fire
[38:03] from this moment on
[38:06] you were going to be different
[38:11] and so then we all went outside is
[38:15] one by one yeah
[38:18] we started to throw in their paper
[38:21] in the fire yeah
[38:24] and brother if you could see their face
[38:29] there were some that were crying
[38:35] and there were some people that couldn't
[38:37] conceal their emotions
[38:39] way
[38:43] s the youth were extremely blessed
[38:48] as we finished
[38:51] I spoke a little bit
[38:53] and I told them this
[38:56] uh
[38:59] NSA from now on is
[39:03] this which you place in the fire
[39:09] it will no longer be something that will
[39:11] affect you from now on aura
[39:14] is
[39:17] it now the devil will come back to tell
[39:19] you this and that see yes he will
[39:28] don't bother me anymore
[39:32] and so we started to pray
[39:36] after praying uh
[39:40] there was one young man
[39:46] the young man was kind of scratching his
[39:48] head a bit
[39:50] um
[39:54] to cry or laugh or get mad
[39:58] [Music]
[40:00] brother are you all right
[40:03] he
[40:04] tells me brother I can't believe it
[40:10] what happened brother
[40:13] he says I can't believe that that was it
[40:18] says all of this year
[40:21] that I've been struggling with this yes
[40:24] he says and that's all I had to do
[40:28] okay yes brother
[40:31] but what is it that happens
[40:36] wants to make us wants to make he wants
[40:38] to make us think
[40:41] that it's something that's really
[40:42] difficult
[40:44] to in order to overcome that is
[40:48] they have to stop doing this that and
[40:50] the other
[40:53] and by the time you stop doing all those
[40:55] things
[40:56] then it's going to be impossible in our
[40:58] mind
[41:01] but why is
[41:03] [Music]
[41:05] the devil wants to keep us in that
[41:07] square
[41:10] because he knows once we leave there

[48:26] thank you
[48:32] foreign
[48:40] foreign
[50:24] it's already been several times and
[50:26] we've been over there
[50:28] when I believe that when I get there and
[50:30] I see the brothers
[50:32] I see them and they're so familiar
[50:35] foreign
[51:33] it's much greater than the natural
[51:38] that's why we identify ourselves with
[51:40] the brothers uh
[51:46] Houston we flew from here to Houston the
[51:49] Houston from Houston
[51:56] it's some hours we do almost a day to
[51:59] get there
[52:01] director as soon as people ask why don't
[52:03] you get a direct flight
[52:05] it says when you know how to do things
[52:08] and I'm not saying it because
[52:11] I say because of my past
[52:13] the teaching that he has
[52:15] where we come from
[52:18] we come from an Apostolic teaching
[52:22] and that is what we're standing on
[52:23] that's right
[52:25] you can say well yeah that's what they
[52:27] told brother
[52:29] he went beyond the curtain of time
[52:46] with what our Apostle said
[52:48] brother that sounds like heresy
[52:51] that is the word of God
[52:53] there's a condescendence
[52:59] then you can stand firm on what you
[53:02] believe
[53:03] and you know that what's been taught to
[53:05] you that is the truth
[53:07] there was a witness
[53:10] that's all the Miracles
[53:15] none of us were here there maybe none of
[53:17] us
[53:18] but there was people of confidence
[53:23] he says they were loyal that they were
[53:25] instructed
[53:29] because
[53:32] people have been loyally
[53:36] appreciate anybody
[53:39] but we're trusting in that which we have
[53:41] believed so we're right
[53:44] almost arriving would you want to go
[53:47] change
[53:49] because we have to go to church it was a
[53:51] youth service
[53:52] good thing it was foreign
[54:01] Torres the next day we went to another
[54:02] city
[54:05] you say brother how far is it it's about
[54:07] an hour
[54:08] for me it always feels like two hours
[54:11] I don't know why they say an hour
[54:14] the pastor from there is
[54:52] like just like we point to our Apostles
[54:59] a man who was Faithfully in foreign
[56:37] know what kind of man he is
[56:44] when you're on vacation you're relaxing
[56:46] maybe you change your way of being or
[56:47] your attitude
[56:52] it stands firm each time
[56:55] he doesn't go fall back not even an inch
[56:58] and he's an example to me
[57:01] so if I can go and support him
[57:04] being by his side for me it's I'm proud
[57:07] to do that
[57:10] also went as well
[57:13] developed a friendship with him along
[57:15] the years
[57:19] I have seen him pray for people
[57:21] in Miracles
[57:25] there was a brother who was he was
[57:27] twitching in pain
[57:29] we were in the cemetery
[57:31] and his wife arrived she was desperate
[57:40] my husband can't take the pin anymore he
[57:43] has a pain in his kids
[57:44] the brother was crying
[57:47] because I know what it feels like I've
[57:48] had that pace
[57:50] it's an unsupportable place
[58:02] it was a very simple prayer
[58:05] but God healed him in the instance
[58:13] we have the best
[58:15] and the young people are here
[58:19] don't be surprised that your pastor
[58:21] calls you to be ready
[58:26] so you know that there's other young
[58:28] people who are also fighting they want
[58:30] to get to know
[58:33] they want to know what is it that you do
[58:37] you want to know what's the secret
[58:40] you have to be Overcomers
[58:44] because the simple Act of sitting here
[58:46] the young people there's so much
[58:48] temptation is
[58:50] that each one of you
[58:52] maybe you're not able to see it
[58:55] once you get older you can see it
[58:57] clearly
[59:00] because the world
[59:03] the simple act that you're sitting here
[59:06] that means
[59:11] that we've gotten to know over time
[59:20] and I exchanged it with a brother
[59:24] and I put it in honor of the brothers
[59:30] but his name is Orlando yes
[59:34] and I really appreciate him and I've had
[59:37] quite the friendships
[59:40] foreign
[1:00:40] Hermano
[1:01:26] Hermano
[1:02:28] When you pray for people foreign
[1:03:30] and he didn't say anything he just left
[1:03:32] Amigos one of my one of my friends came
[1:03:34] they said he says welcome to the club
[1:03:37] because when you do something for God
[1:03:40] the enemy is not going to stay still
[1:03:43] that's what we think each one of you for
[1:03:46] your prayers
[1:04:09] everything anything you might need
[1:04:11] is
[1:04:13] a living God
[1:04:20] you have to go out to be able to see God
[1:04:22] in action
[1:04:23] that's what God wants in each one of you
[1:04:28] I know you already studied
[1:05:22] and that doubt begins to leave
[1:05:25] finish
[1:05:29] a
[1:05:31] in the message he that is in you
[1:05:34] remember that the topic was
[1:05:37] testifying what is within you this is
[1:05:39] foreign
[1:06:30] is a difference
[1:06:34] and that's what's called Fool's Gold
[1:06:37] this is
[1:06:40] it's not even worth as much as the rock
[1:06:43] that it's in this is
[1:06:45] It's called iron pirate
[1:06:48] it's Pirates
[1:06:50] it's the same as gold
[1:06:53] it looks like it shines
[1:07:08] and I think the scientists claim that
[1:07:11] the waters and the leaking acids and
[1:07:12] things never got there quite enough to
[1:07:14] harden it and bring it into place to
[1:07:15] make it gold I'm going to repeat it once
[1:07:18] again
[1:07:18] just the scientists claim that the
[1:07:22] waters Los Angeles and the leaking acids
[1:07:25] it causes and things
[1:07:28] never got there quite enough but okay
[1:08:03] because there's places where you give
[1:08:05] people things
[1:08:07] well it's nice but I wanted another
[1:08:09] color
[1:08:10] you know what I refer I'm referring to
[1:08:12] that
[1:08:13] when someone is grateful from the heart
[1:08:17] then you feel very comfortable yes
[1:08:24] it's exactly what a brother called spoke
[1:08:27] on this morning
[1:08:29] they weren't able to withstand enough
[1:08:31] pressure
[1:08:33] they were they weren't able to stand
[1:08:36] enough trials
[1:08:37] and it only shines
[1:08:43] so it shines better this is
[1:08:51] to take out what's within you
[1:08:55] must be pressure after pressure
[1:09:00] after tribulation foreign
[1:10:01] asking for you to remove the trials
[1:10:03] don't take them away
[1:10:07] just gave us the strength to be able to
[1:10:09] overcome them
[1:10:10] if there's a person here tonight
[1:10:14] they're struggling or going through
[1:10:15] trials
[1:10:16] may they not be disappointed
[1:10:20] they know that with that pressure
[1:10:23] they will bring out what's within them
[1:10:26] we're just waiting for that is
[1:10:48] there is nothing but Jewels
[1:10:52] because they bring out what's within
[1:10:54] them thank you Father gracias thank you
