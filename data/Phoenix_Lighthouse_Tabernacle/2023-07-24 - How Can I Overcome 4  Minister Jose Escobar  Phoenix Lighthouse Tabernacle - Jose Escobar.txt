happy that we're able to be inside this nice cool place I appreciate that for you each make to be here I know weather-wise this week has been pretty brutal but that's why even more I'm more thankful that you're able to make the effort to be here tonight also to those who may be watching us online I also want to thank you for your effort I know there's time differences and so I know sometimes it could be difficult to tune in so we appreciate you I'm going to take advantage that you're standing up we could please open up the scripture we'll be reading our base scripture which will be in Revelations 3 20. foreign [Music] behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to say with me in my throne even as I also overcame and been sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to your heavenly father Celestial all right thank you for letting us together here once again thank you because we have a place together thank you for all the people who are here and all the people who are watching online I ask that you may anoint my lips will you help me maybe that me and we also help my interpret as well this is all for the benefit of your people so I ask you all these things amen I'm as you can see we're still talking about the topic of how can I overcome and that's the scripture we just read you know it's it's a message to the Larissa age [Music] not just that it's a message to the Overcomers um [Music] was an age that needed rebuking um and it's also he also says it's the grandest of all the churches you know it's the greatest sinful age you know this age has more sin than there has ever been okay it's many times harder to fight now we spoke on last time no this being the the most difficult age but yet God chose us to be in this way what does God think about us no you could have been in other ages but God chose you to be in this area you know something interesting um a while ago we're having Fellowship here behind the church you know we had a youth activity and we were asking each other questions and one of the questions was you know if you could talk to any character in The Bible yes some people said you know Enoch and some people said job and other people mentioned other characters that they would want to talk but what I found interesting was what one brother said you know we would want to ask them questions but they would want to do the same foreign but you take as much Darkness as you want to and try to stand against light one time see what happened foreign and we repeat it all the time and I think it's worth repeating to overcome is to stand the test but what is a test so a general definition for a test you know it's a procedure intended to establish the quality performance or reliability of something especially before it's taken into widespread use so for example you know when we buy a car before that car can be sold it has to be tested you know is it safe enough to write to drive on the road you know also when we buy any type of Technology you know it has to be tested to see if it's safe for the consumers you know and that's the same for us no God wants to test us see am I somebody who when I have a trial so yeah am I going to run we have a weed where am I somebody who's going to stand firm also that's why the Trials Come yes and we're expected to be tested and how can I overcome he says no now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he says it says with the word he says that's God's test do you believe it is come into God must be tested says that only shows a true child then see be tested he says and you can't overcome unless there's a test to give to you and when Tess is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test Jesus and here is once again a key that brother Benham gives us he says the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said that our trials are worth more than precious gold so it says it's a testing time and here's another good key yes it's one good evidence to us that God is with us because when we're tested is for all children of God are tested and tried so we have to expect to be tested as long as we're on the earth we're always going to be tested but what do we have to overcome you know we overcome the things of the world we find that the hardest thing to overcome is to overcome ourselves the thing you have to overcome is yourself you have to surrender to yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way you know that's the hardest thing to do is overcome yourself you can see all these you know famous artists and all these famous people you know who are successful they conquered their career foreign foreign that will defeat Satan that has never been nothing on this Earth that would ever defeat Satan like the word of God here he tells us you know the best thing we can use is the word of God you know Jesus used it in his great battle he said it is written Jesus that you just give him the word and that he can't stand it the devil can't stand he says because it's inspired but what's another tool that we can use we have the Holy Ghost we have the Holy Spirit you know but what is the Holy Ghost no I don't know too much tells us you know what it is he says the holy ghost that it's a power he says he says that it's a comforter he says it's a sign and because of no we're Sinners we were found guilty foreign say it's your Resurrection he said it's all that God has for you he's an advocate and I'm happy for that advocate in paragraph 62. we could go into details with that and break that down of how that when it makes intercessions for our ignorance no he intercedes for our ignorance it tells us that he takes our place but because God loved us he sent somebody who took our place and now here we are yeah we are tonight and then he goes on you see he says the holy spirit is there to make an advocate for us he is our attorney he stands there and pleats for us if we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in his pleats for us it's not us that please it's the holy ghost that please for us it intercedes for us so the holy spirit is giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand what was it uh it's the last part 62. no Santo in in sometimes you can't understand and he makes interests for us that's the Holy Ghost is 63. this is when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fellow we we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of traps full of everything he said oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take that Christian Life you know and how many of us I've ever been afraid to take that Christian Life I can raise my hand every time I've been afraid to take the Christian Life he says I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this you know because if it wasn't for that act foreign and so I'm glad we have an advocate but why do we need an advocate because there's an accuser you know there's always somebody who accuses and then there's always a Defender you know and I like when I was up here where my brother and he told us you know let's not accuse each other no let's show Grace towards each other because he said there's already an accuser and there is an accuser no it's the devil you know and brother Bernie you know the message understanding me no he talks about how he accuses and he says that the devil is going to accuse you before the Deacon not before the pastor Del Pastor no brother Bernie tells us he says he comes to you and accuses you directly so he comes directly to you and he accuses some people might say you know he comes to church and accuses you he says not even there he says he comes directly in front of the throne he says he stands there to accuse you but on the other side you have God backing you up and once again you know he wants to remind you because that's what happens with us we have a memory we remember those bad things we did no we're forgiven but the Devil comes back and reminds us he's just like that mouth that you praise the Lord with you I mean um he's like you curse with that amount and he comes and he accuses us we have to remember foreign you know how can I overcome you know another word for overcome you know could be conquered you know how can we conquer ourselves how can we conquer the things that come against us another example that brother Brandon gives you know is of Napoleon Napoleon you know that he was a great conqueror you know that people feared him he says that at night or the moms you know what they would tell their kids no they wouldn't tell them the boogeyman's Gonna Get You Napoleon's gonna get you and he said that they would be scared because he was such a terrible man but he overcame all these things but in the end he couldn't overcome himself he died due to his alcoholism and so here we are in Romans 31 says what shall we then say to these things if God be for us then who can be against us is he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to charge of God's elect it is God that justifies you see that condemneth it is Christ that died year rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us once again it's telling us right there who makes an intercession for us next one is who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulations or distress or persecutions or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughtered and here's one of the verses that I really like he says and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so we're not just conquerors you'd want to give us that Advocate because he loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come foreign there's no height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so what can separate us from the love of God nothing nothing but we can overcome we have to take God at his word use the two he's given us and if we fall is that we have an advocate once again I thank you all for being here this evening dear heavenly father Lord thank you for being with us a small thought you placed inside me that I thought I share with your people I hope that it may benefit at least one person yeah Persona I mean you continue to strengthen us Lord continue I ask that you're helping us we start this new week will you help us at our jobs maybe some people have school May you help us where we find ourselves strengthen us Lord I mean you encourage us to do what we need to do lord well like your Prophet said no this is the darkest age you know I know it's difficult for the young ones so you know I care for them Lord so I ask that you be with them may you allow them to make the right decisions may you protect them I mean you watch over me as well throughout the week I ask that you forgive all of us Lord is no there's something I did wrong Lord may you forgive me Lord no I know I don't give you the time that I should Lord so I ask that you forgive me for that Lord but I thank you for that Mercy thank you for that Grace Lord thank you for that love and I thank you Lord because we have an advocate or that we were supposed to die but instead you died for us on that cross at Calvary so I thank you for everything you've done everything you're doing for everything you will do so I ask you all these things [Applause] foreign [Music]
