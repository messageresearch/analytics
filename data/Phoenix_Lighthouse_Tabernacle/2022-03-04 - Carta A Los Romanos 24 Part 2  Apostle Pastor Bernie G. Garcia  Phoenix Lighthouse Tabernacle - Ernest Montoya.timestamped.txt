[15:03] so
[16:05] jesus christ
[16:34] it might be too much to try and give in
[16:36] one day
[16:39] but there might be someone that'll catch
[16:41] it
[16:42] and it'll be a help
[17:17] every tree that had severe fruit was
[17:19] born given
[17:21] up came the animals
[17:27] everything came into existence during
[17:28] chapter one of genesis
[17:50] and the lord formed man of the dust of
[17:51] the ground and
[17:53] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[17:55] life and man became a living soul
[18:11] this man is one that is formed the dust
[18:14] is that right
[18:17] let's say that this is the man
[18:24] of the dust
[18:38] and the lord god planted a garden
[18:40] eastward in eaton and there he put the
[18:43] man whom he had formed
[18:59] and out of the ground made the lord god
[19:02] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[19:04] the site and good for food the tree of
[19:08] life also in the midst of the garden and
[19:10] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[19:14] first of all i want you to notice
[19:17] it makes a difference there between a
[19:19] tree and a tree
[19:23] talks about the trees that are pleasant
[19:25] to the outside and good for food
[19:30] the pear the apple the peach
[19:32] every kind of app
[19:36] it also
[19:51] of life come from and where did the tree
[19:53] of knowledge of good and evil come from
[19:57] out of the ground
[20:00] so here you have the tree of life
[20:03] from the earth the dirt
[20:32] carefully the restoration of the bright
[20:33] trees
[20:39] the brushes can be cut off
[20:42] you can cut down the tree completely
[20:44] all the way down
[20:46] you can cut it
[21:04] they're the prophet
[21:06] to the earth
[21:11] so the life is in the roots
[21:28] a
[21:56] uh
[22:09] romans chapter 7.
[22:19] don't say anything
[22:21] he had the faith
[22:22] romans 7 verse 6.
[22:44] being dead wherein we were held that we
[22:47] should serve in newness of spirit and
[22:49] not in the oldness of the letter
[22:51] estamos
[23:08] so we're free from the life
[23:12] having died
[23:14] being dead today we were held forever
[23:34] romans 8.
[23:43] and if the spirit
[23:50] but it's the spirit of him that raised
[23:52] jesus from the dead verse 11
[24:02] spirit
[24:06] he that raised up christ from the dead
[24:08] shall also quicken your moral bodies by
[24:09] his spirit that dwells in you
[24:13] the messenger says quickly
[24:15] it will bring understanding
[24:25] genesis 128
[24:43] god bless
[24:58] to be fruitful
[26:05] the fourth word
[26:34] is
[27:46] for his
[28:14] the spirit of christ
[28:38] therefore brethren we are not deader we
[28:40] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[28:42] after
[28:55] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[28:57] the deeds of the body ye shall live
[29:03] so if through the spirit by the spirit
[29:05] you kill them
[29:10] bernie garcia
[29:38] let us
[29:49] for the little bit that we have been
[29:50] able to speak this morning
[30:06] to know that your word says that this
[30:07] will come to a fulfillment
[30:15] there's a people somewhere more to find
[30:16] the needs of the flesh
[30:19] and it is you living yeah
[30:33] give us our dignity
[30:52] jesus christ
