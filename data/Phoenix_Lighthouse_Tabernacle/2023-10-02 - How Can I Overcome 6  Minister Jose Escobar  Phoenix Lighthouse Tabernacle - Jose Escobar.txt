Fresco I know it's getting a little darker a little bit sooner that's a great blessing for us you could just take your seats for a momentos I just want to take some time to greet each one of you this evening this morning the privilege to be in Tucson I was able to be at Jerusalem Tabernacle um with our brother is able to be there and greet the greet the congregation and speak a couple words this morning as well I just wanted to tell you that he sent his greetings and then I'm happy to be back home tonight to be so kind now please stand up once again I'm sorry Ruby going into our scripture which would be Revelations 3 20 to 22. and we continue on the same topic of how can I overcome continent that's a really topic that we've all been speaking on um it's a very vast topic you know we listen to brother Brandon's message you'll always find something there is and then you can also find something there as well so the scripture reads behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and what's up with him and he with me with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne series with the spirit says unto the churches okay here safely Lord no we thank you for all your blessings thank you for everything you do for us Lord now I ask that you may be with me they meet with my interpreter as well you anoint our lips of those listening whether that's here in the sanctuary maybe online or wherever the service reaches somebody may be a great blessing to them in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you'd be so kind of please take your seats sientos so the topic is how can I overcome you know as we just read the scripture you know the scripture are Prophet tells us this is you know it's addressing the Overcomer you know it's speaking to the Overcomers of laudice and he lets us know he knows that God is dealing with the individuals you know he's not just talking to the church it's he that overcomes it's the individual that overcomes so we also know that means you know we are in laudice and we know that every age it has its Overcomers also has its own reward but also every age it has its trials it has its tests it has its suffering tells us you know I was reading a little a bit of the Smyrna Church H book you know and I took what I could you know if you read those books no it's for me it's way too much so I just try to pull what I can but their brother man tells us there's no age that's free from it he's talking about the suffering there's no True Believer that's free from it he says this is God says this is the will of God he said it's needful he says we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it and because love suffereth lung and His Kind so we have to suffer free you know and something that I find amazing okay is that God chose each one of us here he chose us to be this age you know what Daniel was a great Overcomer No Moses was a great Overcomer they were all great Overcomers in their ages but what about us you know what I find amazing is that God looked at us he looked at you no he said Alberto you know he said Moises you know he says you're not going to Ephesus you're not going to Sardis or Philadelphia I'm sending you in the hardest darkest age foreign concerning the fury trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you in verse 13 says but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joyce is so now it's not only telling us not to be surprised when we're tested but now he's telling us to Rejoice to rejoice when we're suffering so now you might ask yourself rejoice in suffering brother the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you also tells us let me know it's one good evidence that God is with you know brother Bernie tells us in how can I overcome number three you know he's talking about you know being tested and he says you know you might think the greatest thing that can happen to me like someone gives me a cake or someone gives me a brand new car is his love was proven truly by the fact that we were chosen unto salvation you know in the scripture backs that up as well you know in Hebrews 12. everybody else in 12 6-8 and that's where it says it I know this is for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son who he receiveth yeah God dealing with you as with sons for what is a son is he whom the father chasteneth not she supported no what does it say in the next verse so bear with me be without chastisement ye are bastards and not Sons perfecto he has left his church a measure of that suffering foreign [Music] and if children then hairs hairs of God and join hairs with Christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may also be glorified together and so and then what does it say in 18. he says for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US so we're going to suffer with him but we can also be glorified together glorificados and whatever we suffer no matter how much it hurts no matter how difficult it is being told here in the scripture that it can't be compared it can't be compared to the glory Gloria that would be revealed in us and that's great but he overcame it all over what did he overcome it with he overcame it with the words each time Satan tempted him he used the word and that's what we should do as well and we use the word so we can overcome but we have to let him do his work no we do our part and he always does you know God never fails you know God's the same yesterday today and foreign we are the clay and thou are Potter and we are the work of thy hand foreign [Music] you know you know this one is one that takes me way back you know it's in Spanish so I'll be reading it in Spanish it's a song I thought a lot about when I was going through a tough time and I always go back to it and I like how they sing it in my Grandpa's church back in Mexico in Mexico you know the name of the song The Potter you know and it's a song I really like you know and I'll be reading the words but you know when you release that Revelation you know songs are no longer just words they become a testimony see yourself in that song it has that impact when you have that Revelation you can see yourself in this book it makes an impact in your life one day praying I told my Lord I am the clay model my life I'll transform you into a new vessel but then it says during the process I'm going to make you cry because I'm gonna make you go through the fire no maybe that's us we thought we were something great but then we come in front of God and we realize we're unpleasing no no no no no no no no no no and he tells us I'm going to transform him but the thing is you're gonna cry I'm gonna make you go through the fire and what's the fire it's those trials it's those tests it's that suffering why because if we're made of clay what does that fire it burns it hurts it's making us stronger making to a better base no maybe we might say you know Lord just patched me up he says give me a little bandages but no what is God saying I want to smile when everything's going bad I want to worship while you're complaining I want your trust while you're going through the hard times and I want you also learn to forgive what have we been listening to in these tapes I believe last week that the base for faith is forgiveness and here the song tells us you know when everything is going bad I don't want you to complain I want you to smile I don't want you to do a tantrum I want you to give me worship and I want you to be confident when everything is dark I want you to be confident I know that that's tough yes we are going through something difficult you don't want to smile I don't want to smile he says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations says knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect word work that you may be perfect in the entire wanting nothing by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom has allows us to come to pass that's how we show our love we're going through some we're suffering we conduct ourselves with joy why because this isn't random God is allowing in Japan and it's for a reason is we should kind of wire heads dear heavenly father Celestial Lord thank you for being with us tonight Lord I thank you because we're all so blessed here Lord no you truly are so good to us you're so wonderful I know we sometimes we feel like we don't deserve it Lord but that's your Amazing Grace so I thank you tonight Lord and I asked for anybody who might need something Lord we are the clay You Are The Potter us to your liking we know it's going to hurt we know it's going to be difficult so I asked for all my brothers here Lord maybe the ones watching online [Music] thank you for everything you've done thank you for everything you're doing that you will do so much more as well once again I praise these people in your hands you give them all a special blessings I ask you all these things amen amen God bless you [Music] gracias [Music] I enjoyed the message

couldn't do any less but just tell the people then we can understand a little bit yes foreign [Music] Psalms 116 15. is precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints when a person finishes their Journey the Lord picks up their vessels because we're still in the flesh is because we have lost our mother the feeling is very similar um the only thing that can help us is our prayers so to be able to continue on it's like they take an arm away from you okay they take something away from you that's very special we know how deep that pain is there are certain wounds that heal but the scar remains it doesn't hurt that much anymore but there's a mark there's a woman there's her deeper scars you can't see in your body but it does get to the human being Historia I heard a story or a reflection [Music] when a ship left at the dock [Music] and everyone saying goodbye to the loved ones they're sad but when they get to their destination [Music] when they're getting there many people are saying hello they're receiving them giving them a welcome party that's when a person passes away so long here is but on the other side of the river is many people are receiving them to such an extent they didn't want to come back because the well-off they are all on the other side foreign [Music] you know how hard it is Hermanos [Music] Jose is and we're praying for them and this church
