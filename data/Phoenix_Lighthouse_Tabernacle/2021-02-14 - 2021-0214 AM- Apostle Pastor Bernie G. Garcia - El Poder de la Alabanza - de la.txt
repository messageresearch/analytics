[Applause] is [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] m [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] yes [Music] may the lord we trust that the lord will grant all of our needs that's the reason we come together so it'd be the lord that is our helper vamos we're going to open our bibles to the 113th song verse 3 vamos they will be singing the song if you're saved and you know it say amen stress hey from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised amen we may be seated [Music] and you know it say amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is this evening we'll be talking on a short subject el poder [Music] i believe sincerely that praise is a key okay [Music] and i believe that that key opens the doors of heaven to celebrate with words [Music] the word praise is synonymous with the word to glorify significa which means to offer tribute magnificat the word uh praise is synonymous with the word magnify exalter to exalt to [Music] let's open our bibles to luke the 24th chapter verso verse 53. it's the last verse of the book of luke 1 in taking these scriptures and taking this short thought for a few moments i think it takes us back to the early church [Music] so we can see how it was that they lived verse 53 adios [Applause] a man comes close to a young lady the first thing he does is try to try to praise her oh you're so purty you're such a good cook what beautiful eyes you slowly but surely that woman begins to remember those words she heard from the man forgive are the wolves that have learned to have that key in their hands amen and i believe spiritually that's why the wolves in the spiritual antenna i sincerely [Music] that would be different but the bible says that the people daily praised god let's see an example of how they came in the bible says that they daily entered the temple where did you come in through the window came if he is around then he's sharper than we think let's look at the one psalm 100. make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands he that the things make the noise if powerful audience pray unto god but if you read your origin enjoy say my healer can you imagine i'm safe and you tell the waitress i want a hamburger with extra onions and since you say onions she wrinkles her nose when she comes back she throws the plate at you you don't even feel like eating the hamburger after that is all right it happened to me like that at a restaurant here the other day i waited for an hour for them to bring me a piece of paper and they didn't bring it here there's an announcement advertised that you have pie who says you know that when you go somewhere and someone serves you yes and they serve you making faces and looking ugly at you you don't even eat uh you don't even eat happily says that a dry piece of bread in a house of peace is better than a large meal when there's where there's contention here the scripture says serve the lord with gladness when we come here to the house of the lord we come to have fellowship with god with thanksgiving in recognition you know how the majority comes in maybe because of lack of teaching let's give the example that this is the door and the service is about to start i come inside i sit down raise our i go into the bedroom and just kick back and sleep since he was a policeman i think he'll follow me with a shotgun you didn't even say hi you didn't say here i am called the house of prayer the doors open come inside come to the altar lord i give you thanks because i did not form myself yes sir [Music] we have enough to fill a lot of gallons of lemonade could you give someone lemonade it seems like they're bringing us in with the broom heaven i was the pastor of a church dania ekomo [Music] but those brothers knew how to praise the lord after six months in hermana there was about a hundred brethren when we'd start the service the altar would be full here the souls would come forward went why did he go when he left and the altar would get full hallelujah hallelujah [Music] forgive me brother the wine was given to me by god i came into the tabernacle before the service started i came to the altar since i usually don't come to the prayer i began to raise my hands to [Music] jesus christ we have an order in the church but when god takes hold we should know it's time [Music] i have the mind what am i going to repay him with the car cost him is jesus christ came before the father and he said how much does navarro owe you poor thing if he would have come from china even though they gave him a hundred dollars a pound for the chinese he still couldn't pay it because he said jesus christ says wipe it clean and give this over here the poor brother says 24 hours i owe the carpet i owe the car that they took away from me five years ago i owe the house that they kicked me out of 30 years ago they were all of them [Music] even though he was uglier than a frog oh you're beautiful is [Music] there were the apostles juani pedro peter and john ivana altar they were going to the tabernacle another sermon [Music] pedro peter says mr skeptic i don't have time to listen to you i wonder where the hour of prayer being the ninth hour they ordered they part prayed from the morning amen i didn't hear any amen he was there from early because he knew that's when the facebook do of no avail to him to come in when the hypocrites and they're gonna give me everything they have when he heard a little noise he began to look around he saw peter and john when they were walking 20th century layman here i have my checkbook but according to last count i have a deficit of 177 dollars i didn't have enough to pay the breakfast this morning at smitty's my uh mother-in-law asked me for some socks i don't have anything to buy any socks yes oh i i i didn't get what whoa one to me if i don't get it whoa unto me if i don't get the socks in the name of jesus christ stand up and walk do you say what the bible says and he took him by the right hand lifted him and immediately his feet and ankles bones receive strength and leaping up stood vamos ah i just heard the skeptic stands up this is dr smith he said goodbye dr smith oh no these young ladies hi deacon they turned to see me should i kick her out somebody with revelation came in finally the remember praise god of yours he prayed for they're just a bunch of [Music] the the barber says before you see it for me thank you lord my god because i stepped on the devil the devil's still in front of me he's on the side of me but i'm praising god the name give [Music] you take the white hair glory to thy name amen [Music] [Music] anymore [Music] what will i do [Music] [Music] i know [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] from [Music] you
