[41:23] the Lord Christ
[41:27] living
[41:29] [Music]
[41:47] um
[41:47] I went to the dictionary
[41:50] I wanted to look for the word attitude
[41:55] it's to be with someone
[41:59] or to work
[42:02] I went to another word
[42:08] facing a situation or a purpose
[42:11] of an actual person
[42:15] there is a right attitude
[42:19] there's a lot of people that are not
[42:21] Christian
[42:22] they also have a good attitude
[42:28] we also we're going to see the right
[42:31] mortal attitude
[42:35] moral incorrect attitude
[42:39] [Music]
[43:08] it takes love to do that
[43:13] love is the most powerful force that
[43:15] there is in the world
[43:19] have you notice
[43:21] of the devil
[43:25] is
[43:32] and when the person and when the people
[43:35] hate someone remember it is a terrible
[43:38] devil and despise or dislike you mustn't
[43:41] do that means
[43:45] message expectation uh zero four uh
[43:48] April 4th
[43:52] we always get what we expect
[43:56] when people expect anything
[44:00] they usually get what you look for
[44:03] depending like
[44:05] it's the mental attitude that you have
[44:09] videos
[44:15] remember this never forget it the right
[44:18] mental attitude towards any promise
[44:21] will bring it to pass
[44:27] the right mental attitude towards any
[44:30] promise of God
[44:31] it doesn't take Gifts of healing well
[44:39] it doesn't take any gifts
[44:40] any person has right here to me
[44:44] if you're a Christian
[44:50] and defeat him on any grounds that he
[44:53] could that he could stand on
[44:56] the message is taking sides with Jesus
[45:01] there are many times a minister will
[45:03] make a mistake
[45:07] [Music]
[45:09] and he comes into I never heard a
[45:11] precious brother who's trying to do the
[45:13] what's right
[45:21] and lead the people right everything the
[45:24] devil can point to that
[45:27] point to a Believer the so-called
[45:29] Christian in that neighborhood he would
[45:31] throw off that man on that man he'll do
[45:34] it
[45:36] to throw off that man
[45:39] if the devil can throw you on he will do
[45:42] it
[45:44] don't say bad things
[45:47] just tell him good things
[45:51] just tell tell him you know what's good
[45:55] if anything is
[46:08] don't try to take a poll and shove a man
[46:11] further into the
[46:16] the Christian attitude is to pick him up
[46:18] and take him out of the ditch
[46:21] don't ever try to shove him down
[46:25] try to help him
[46:27] amen
[46:30] [Music]
[46:43] foreign
[47:17] because we get angry
[47:24] and mad we say things that we shouldn't
[47:26] say
[47:27] [Music]
[47:29] with a bad attitude or angry attitude we
[47:32] take bad decisions
[47:35] sometimes between husband and wife
[47:47] [Music]
[47:49] to have the right mental attitude
[47:51] Christian mental attitude
[47:54] message questions and answers
[48:01] [Music]
[48:05] somebody told me he had one one time was
[48:08] converted and received the Holy Ghost
[48:10] and he said to him how are you going how
[48:12] are you going getting along
[48:14] oh he said
[48:18] he said pretty good and pretty bad he
[48:21] said well how do you mean pretty good
[48:22] and pretty bad
[48:24] since I received me the Holy Ghost
[48:28] and me there's been two dogs in me
[48:35] the other one the other damn is a white
[48:37] dog
[48:38] and they said they argue all the time
[48:42] they ground and fight one another one
[48:45] another
[48:46] and
[48:53] the black dog wants me to do bad
[49:05] [Music]
[49:19] this just depends on the warning of a
[49:21] body that's in you
[49:25] the nature catered to you the Cardinal
[49:28] nature of after the things of the world
[49:32] and the spiritual nature after the
[49:35] things of God
[49:36] I want to make a point here myself
[50:06] [Music]
[50:23] [Music]
[50:25] very good
[50:27] attitude
[50:56] is
[51:07] foreign
[51:15] in those days in the day in those days
[51:17] Hezekiah was sick of near death and
[51:20] Isaiah the prophet son of Amos went to
[51:23] him and said to him
[51:25] set the house in order for Thou shalt
[51:28] die and I live
[51:32] he turned his face towards the wall and
[51:34] prayed to the Lord saying
[51:41] Corazon
[51:48] remember now oh Lord I pray how I have
[51:51] walked before you in truth and with a
[51:53] loyal heart
[51:57] is
[52:00] and have done what was good in thy side
[52:03] Hezekiah weep Beverly
[52:08] Isaiah come into the middle
[52:16] it was very
[52:24] can you imagine that
[52:27] this is your
[52:29] um
[52:35] [Music]
[52:45] return and tell Hezekiah the leader of
[52:48] my people thus said the Lord God of
[52:50] David your father have heard your prayer
[52:52] and have seen your tears surely I will
[52:54] heal you on the third day you shall go
[52:56] up to the house of the Lord
[52:58] anos
[53:02] is
[53:13] 15 years and I would deliver you from
[53:15] the from the city from the hand of the
[53:17] king of Assyria and will defend city of
[53:20] my own for my own sake
[53:21] and for my sake of my servant David
[53:23] means
[53:27] the gates of the enemy
[53:39] the first thing a child of God has to to
[53:42] Refuge when a trial comes
[53:50] the greatest weapon ever put in the
[53:52] hands of mankind is prayer
[53:54] it even changes everything
[53:58] don't even change the mind of God in one
[54:01] occasion
[54:04] God told the prophet to go up and tell
[54:07] him the king wasn't wasn't going to die
[54:15] and the King returned turned his face to
[54:18] the one and said Lord beseech you and
[54:20] consider me
[54:22] can we make that a prayer
[54:25] have we walked with a perfect heart
[54:28] I need 15 years longer is
[54:34] and God spared his life 15 years longer
[54:38] Prayer Changes Things
[54:40] I'm gonna hold on here just a minute
[54:43] a few weeks ago
[54:46] my my mother-in-law um
[54:51] the doctor said just go and and arrest
[54:54] them
[54:55] there's nothing we could do for her
[54:58] Bueno yeah
[55:01] she began to give away her inheritance
[55:07] money her pots pans
[55:13] but the grace of God I came into the
[55:16] conversation when she was doing this
[55:17] [Music]
[55:20] I was able to see her face to face
[55:28] it's the same God
[55:42] [Music]
[55:46] it's a simple prayer
[55:50] now she's still alive
[55:53] [Music]
[55:57] but the grace of God was extended to her
[56:02] let us look at another right attitude
[56:06] let us go to Luke 23 39.
[56:16] then one of the criminals who hanged
[56:19] blasphemed him saying you are the Christ
[56:22] save yourself in us
[56:24] [Music]
[56:29] but another answer in rebuking him
[56:31] saying don't you ever fear God sin
[56:34] you're under the same condemnation
[56:48] for what we received or to the due
[56:52] reward of our Deeds but this man has
[56:54] done has done nothing wrong
[56:57] then Jesus said remember me
[57:00] when you come into your case
[57:02] [Music]
[57:07] that today you will be with me
[57:10] dude you notice the attitude there
[57:14] what makes the great difference
[57:16] Grace was extended towards him
[57:23] the message of Grace 1961 is
[57:31] that was proven there at the cross when
[57:32] the when there was a violence Thief
[57:35] was there at the cross
[57:36] he deserved to die
[57:39] God had never crossed his mind
[57:42] [Music]
[57:51] then they're at the cross through his
[57:53] bloody lips between the groans and came
[57:55] a sound Lord be merciful to me
[58:04] and there came another one back through
[58:08] the blood tears Agony Grace took uphold
[58:10] and said
[58:11] Grace got a hold of them can you imagine
[58:15] the word grace
[58:17] is something we don't deserve all of us
[58:21] here
[58:21] we were grabbed reached by Grace
[58:30] we want to do God's work this one here
[58:41] [Music]
[58:57] no more than you can help yourself
[59:00] thank you
[59:03] serious
[59:09] no more with jerk ourselves off in the
[59:13] Milky Way and through our bootstraps and
[59:15] we couldn't do it
[59:17] but Grace God can do it
[59:21] something about it
[59:25] the grace of God Sovereign
[59:39] that's wonderful says the prophet says
[59:42] amen amen
[59:49] foreign
[59:52] read the book of James
[59:59] who is wise and understanding among you
[1:00:03] is
[1:00:07] conduct by his works
[1:00:10] that are done in meekness of wisdoms
[1:00:20] nothing like this
[1:00:24] but if you have barely envy and
[1:00:27] self-seeking in your hearts do not boast
[1:00:30] and lie against the truth
[1:00:31] is
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:43] this wisdom does not descend from above
[1:00:45] but it's Earthly essential than demonic
[1:00:48] foreign
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:01:04] primeramente Pura
[1:01:07] display Pacifica
[1:01:09] but the wisdom that is from above is
[1:01:12] first pure then peaceful
[1:01:15] gentle
[1:01:17] amable willing benign
[1:01:21] and full of GERD fruits
[1:01:28] with our partiality and without
[1:01:30] hypocrisy
[1:01:32] grounds
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:02:48] God gave it to us
[1:02:51] because we didn't deserve anything amen
[1:03:05] foreign
[1:03:09] have mercy on me
[1:03:12] I said you're like dogs
[1:03:15] it's not right
[1:03:19] the crumbs that comes from the master's
[1:03:21] table Lord
[1:03:31] if he would have told us that yeah
[1:03:40] that would have been our attitude
[1:03:50] I'll also feed us
[1:03:53] he didn't pray for her
[1:03:57] she didn't even have to pray for her
[1:03:59] amen blessing

[1:04:23] the Lord
[1:04:31] I really enjoyed
[1:04:33] the message I wanted more
[1:04:38] uh I was getting involved in it
[1:04:41] I'll take your seats because this is
[1:04:44] what we need we need a transformation
[1:04:48] of the attitudes that we have the
[1:04:52] attitudes
[1:04:57] if we've received a new birth
[1:05:00] then what's in us
[1:05:02] part of the germ of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:06] Christ

[1:05:49] brother
[1:05:51] but before we get to two individuals
[1:05:55] we're going to be praying foreign
[1:05:57] how many of you believe in a real God
[1:06:01] we believe that God is real this
[1:06:06] God is merciful but if you believe God
[1:06:10] is merciful
[1:06:11] you didn't believe he was merciful
[1:06:15] can he accomplish I mean if he changed
[1:06:19] his mind
[1:06:20] and he gave this King an additional 15
[1:06:24] years
[1:06:26] what about us can he perform a miracle

[1:06:53] and the Miracle I'm gonna have him come
[1:06:55] up
[1:06:57] because last week
[1:06:59] praying for an individual persona
[1:07:03] that God form of America
[1:07:09] we all know him as Aussie Escalante
[1:07:14] son of brother Sergio Escalante is
[1:07:21] we prayed for the Miracles
[1:07:23] so he's gonna
[1:07:25] give a testimony
[1:07:27] so that you understand that if he could
[1:07:31] do it for a person then he can do it for
[1:07:34] anyone
[1:07:35] we are a family
[1:07:38] if we're a family then each person
[1:07:42] within that family
[1:07:44] for each other
[1:07:49] brother Ozzie
[1:07:51] God bless you
[1:07:54] um just so you guys can really actually
[1:07:56] grasp grasp the magnitude of this
[1:07:59] miracle Captain
[1:08:01] I'll take you guys back six years ago
[1:08:04] it was 2017.
[1:08:07] um I was driving home from Peoria
[1:08:11] Phoenix and I got pulled over now those
[1:08:15] of you know me you know I'm not I'm
[1:08:16] undocumented I don't have a license
[1:08:19] so the police they felt bad for me and
[1:08:21] they're like
[1:08:25] you know I just had my passport
[1:08:30] I got my Visa number but I lost my Visa
[1:08:35] and uh I wasn't uh
[1:08:39] they pulled me over because uh I had a
[1:08:41] view I got a DUI that year
[1:08:46] and uh
[1:08:49] it's a detention center but I don't know
[1:08:51] if you guys remember I was there for 40
[1:08:52] days
[1:09:00] so God extended his grace and got me out
[1:09:04] of that detention center with a big
[1:09:07] bonds
[1:09:10] uh and uh it's been an ongoing case
[1:09:16] the lawyers told me you gotta get gotta
[1:09:18] get married
[1:09:20] and I didn't want to do it for those
[1:09:23] reasons so I mean I held out
[1:09:26] in 2021 my lawyers told me that I had
[1:09:30] voluntary departure on the 20 on the
[1:09:32] 20th of December I think
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:38] uh I got married at the time me and my
[1:09:41] girlfriend we got married and we started
[1:09:42] appealing samosa
[1:09:49] yeah so we didn't get a lawyer and uh
[1:09:52] turns out the appeal was denied foreign
[1:10:00] it's been two years since then and
[1:10:05] um fast forwarding I mean it's been
[1:10:07] nothing but God's grace it's been
[1:10:08] keeping me here
[1:10:13] um
[1:10:15] since November of last year
[1:10:18] I was uh I was I wasn't home I wasn't
[1:10:20] with my wife either I was on the streets
[1:10:22] and
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:27] even then uh our testify to people and
[1:10:30] talk to people about God
[1:10:33] of course I didn't feel worthy but it's
[1:10:35] not about being worthy we heard it's
[1:10:37] about Grace
[1:10:40] and even then a couple times I saw God
[1:10:43] work through me even in my state
[1:10:48] such a couple lives right now but I know
[1:10:51] they had an experience with the Lord
[1:10:55] so
[1:10:58] so now my case was still ongoing right
[1:11:00] and um I wasn't aware about the
[1:11:02] immigration status
[1:11:07] until one day I went home and my dad
[1:11:11] told me he's like hey
[1:11:12] we got a letter from the Immigration
[1:11:14] Court
[1:11:19] he said you got to the 20th of May
[1:11:22] guess what you got to get out you got to
[1:11:24] leave
[1:11:26] and I was in no amongst on the streets
[1:11:28] and I'm like
[1:11:31] well I'll just go on the Run well yeah
[1:11:34] I'll just go and run oh yeah I think we
[1:11:37] lost a bond already I just realized that
[1:11:39] not long ago
[1:11:49] and uh I know with my brothers I've
[1:11:52] testified a lot of times that God
[1:11:54] sometimes when he loses that one sheep
[1:11:59] he goes
[1:12:01] and if that she keeps going straight
[1:12:05] it keeps going straight
[1:12:07] eventually he breaks the legs
[1:12:11] and I told myself why did I have to use
[1:12:13] that metaphor
[1:12:20] two weeks ago
[1:12:24] I was sleeping in an alley
[1:12:28] Pennsylvania
[1:12:32] and I woke up like it was about 6 a.m in
[1:12:35] a car ran over my foot my legs
[1:12:41] and uh I woke up screaming um
[1:12:51] so when I try to stand up there was
[1:12:53] breakage in the skin
[1:12:58] and I fell over and I started in I don't
[1:13:01] know why I did it I started crying I
[1:13:03] said Thank You Lord thank you thank you
[1:13:06] God I'm tired
[1:13:10] at this moment my parents are in Iowa
[1:13:13] so nobody knows this happened
[1:13:18] four days
[1:13:25] and um I didn't get any visitors all the
[1:13:27] time I was there when I got out I called
[1:13:28] one of my brothers and my brother was
[1:13:30] kind enough to
[1:13:31] take time out of the day and come pick
[1:13:33] me up
[1:13:38] um and even then I was still like I'll
[1:13:40] still love it
[1:13:44] I'm more than wobbling with with foot
[1:13:47] and I'm still going to run
[1:13:50] I don't really laugh but it's just God
[1:13:53] has other plans for us so
[1:13:57] um four days after I get out of the
[1:13:59] hospital
[1:14:00] I think um
[1:14:02] my mom she had uh somebody had asked her
[1:14:04] where her son was
[1:14:09] so there was a very big weight on her
[1:14:13] heart she said for me
[1:14:16] so she was at service on Wednesday night
[1:14:18] and she started she went to Elder spray
[1:14:20] and they never do well his prayer
[1:14:21] Wednesday night
[1:14:40] the exact same thing that they were
[1:14:42] asking for was what she was asking
[1:14:43] foreign
[1:14:59] she's a woman of faith
[1:15:02] so um
[1:15:04] the next day I believe yeah the next day
[1:15:06] Thursday
[1:15:07] I'm walking where I usually work was at
[1:15:11] you know walking with a wheelchairs
[1:15:22] and uh she told me to come home and
[1:15:28] um
[1:15:30] and ever since then they've been have me
[1:15:33] there and I've been I've been I've been
[1:15:34] very happy to be with my family I hadn't
[1:15:35] seen him in a long time
[1:15:39] I went to Sister Elizabeth's party
[1:15:42] yesterday it was really nice to see all
[1:15:43] my brothers and all my friends I see you
[1:15:48] but um
[1:15:50] basically what I want to tell the
[1:15:52] magnitude
[1:15:54] so a week passes by when it's Wednesday
[1:15:59] let's go see my brother Moses
[1:16:02] and I I go I go to see it because Moses
[1:16:06] would see me all the time I was always
[1:16:09] in this neighborhood
[1:16:11] but uh I I was like hey boy you home he
[1:16:16] said yeah come on by I was like all
[1:16:17] right so when you have something that
[1:16:19] you know the Lord is for you you can't
[1:16:20] help but go and share with your brother
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:55] make me go
[1:16:58] I said my parents are really going to
[1:16:59] make me go yeah
[1:17:01] and I was kind of like nervous because
[1:17:03] someone wanted to be awesome my mom had
[1:17:04] said Lord whatever you have to do to him
[1:17:09] so I was like
[1:17:11] okay well
[1:17:13] see you know this is it because I've
[1:17:15] gone astray so many times
[1:17:18] I feel like it made God's grace a
[1:17:20] disgrace
[1:17:24] so when I got to the immigration place
[1:17:28] I thought I was going to have a whole
[1:17:30] trial like brother Chui told his
[1:17:31] testimony
[1:17:35] they didn't even let my family go with
[1:17:37] me
[1:17:42] computer
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:49] um and I started I started sweating I
[1:17:51] was like how much I saw that I'm really
[1:17:53] gonna get deported
[1:17:54] you know uh married
[1:17:58] we appealed yeah but the pill is nine
[1:18:03] and I was raised to my head and I was
[1:18:05] like I had an accident last week
[1:18:08] and the lady she goes okay
[1:18:12] I was like yeah I gotta run over by car
[1:18:14] last week
[1:18:15] all the officers
[1:18:18] so I showed my leg and um
[1:18:23] okay I don't want you to have to deal
[1:18:24] with that when you're over there
[1:18:27] I'm gonna give you three months
[1:18:28] extension the one extensions
[1:18:36] keep in mind they're like here put this
[1:18:37] in your pockets
[1:18:41] Pakistan
[1:18:48] so
[1:18:50] tell me that's not last minute
[1:18:54] um I started walking out and I was in
[1:18:56] such shock foreign
[1:19:08] um maybe it's not as real to you as it
[1:19:10] is to me but
[1:19:14] there's so many other times that I can
[1:19:16] tell from six years ago to today
[1:19:20] where God kept me and protected me
[1:19:23] though
[1:19:25] because even after I got out of Illinois
[1:19:30] one more one more crazy instance
[1:19:38] about not even a month later um
[1:19:50] and I made a wrong turn
[1:21:05] they're like what's all the stuff you
[1:21:06] got in the cars
[1:21:10] um
[1:21:11] there was no way they should have let me
[1:21:13] go foreign
[1:21:36] they're like
[1:21:37] be smarter about this kid
[1:21:43] with drugs in the car Brothers
[1:21:50] and we were
[1:21:56] and while I was driving
[1:22:04] this is like probably a couple weeks
[1:22:07] these two instances
[1:22:11] I'm telling you I was I was I'm really
[1:22:15] yeah but I always say the cop car he
[1:22:17] pulled this over of course
[1:22:20] we were honest with them when I remember
[1:22:25] we had like on the floor
[1:22:28] he's like call your dad call somebody
[1:22:31] with a license
[1:22:35] Travis
[1:22:56] she said I don't want to catch driving
[1:22:57] once because I'm sitting in Mexico
[1:23:03] this is two instances
[1:23:04] [Music]

[1:24:47] we're rich you may say I'm poor no we
[1:24:52] are rich in all things including
[1:24:57] the message
