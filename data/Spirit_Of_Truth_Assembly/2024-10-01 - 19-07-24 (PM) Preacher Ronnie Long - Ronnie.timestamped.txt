[1:06:07] can have your seats I want to just speak
[1:06:09] for if we have a title
[1:06:12] tonight dress for a
[1:06:15] bank we're dressed for a
[1:06:17] bank now we read Psalm 23 since we were
[1:06:20] children we read this
[1:06:23] scripture no doubt we could recite my
[1:06:28] heart and this scripture is about the
[1:06:30] great Shepherd
[1:06:32] right and we serve a great Shepherd and
[1:06:35] you might have thought that you made
[1:06:37] your own decisions in your
[1:06:38] life but the great Shepherd has been
[1:06:41] leading and guiding every decision that
[1:06:43] you
[1:06:44] made even when you made the wrong
[1:06:47] decision he's still the great
[1:06:49] sheer you would have walked away from
[1:06:52] him still the great sheer
[1:06:55] matter what you would do he's still a
[1:06:57] great shepher and you would probably not
[1:07:00] be here if it was up to your choice but
[1:07:03] you're still here tonight you didn't
[1:07:05] drive all the way from Carolina all the
[1:07:08] way from Cincinnati all the way across
[1:07:11] the bridge by just your own will but
[1:07:15] there's something greater at work
[1:07:17] tonight the great shepher he's the great
[1:07:20] Shepherd over us no matter what we're
[1:07:22] going through no matter what we feel
[1:07:25] like no matter what our life looks like
[1:07:27] no matter how big the bank account is
[1:07:30] he's still the great
[1:07:32] sheer every one of us that has given our
[1:07:34] heart to the Lord we have agreed to
[1:07:38] allow our decision to fall away and let
[1:07:42] the shepherd lead us let this great
[1:07:44] Shepherd lead us in our lives lead us in
[1:07:47] our decisions lead us in how we raise
[1:07:49] our families lead us in what we do on a
[1:07:52] Friday evening if it was by my choice I
[1:07:55] wouldn't be here tonight but there was a
[1:07:58] greater Shepherd that brought me here
[1:08:00] tonight it was by my own intellect my
[1:08:03] own desires I wouldn't have come tonight
[1:08:06] but there's a greater Shepherd that's
[1:08:08] over my life and even what I would have
[1:08:11] left him he has led me here to his word
[1:08:15] even though you would have given up
[1:08:18] you're still here
[1:08:20] tonight I'm sure I'm sure that this trip
[1:08:23] just went off just super easy
[1:08:27] and there was no there was no problems
[1:08:28] with you didn't forget
[1:08:31] anything you know you didn't you didn't
[1:08:33] there was no issues driving all that way
[1:08:36] didn't have any traffic nobody made you
[1:08:39] mad in traffic but yet you overcame all
[1:08:42] of
[1:08:43] the because there's a great shepher
[1:08:46] that's leing you in your that's leading
[1:08:48] you in your life there's someone over
[1:08:51] all of this and there's a great Shepherd
[1:08:53] over your situation tonight
[1:08:56] you might think that you're the only one
[1:08:57] going through your particular
[1:09:00] situation and that's just how the devil
[1:09:02] would like it he would let you to think
[1:09:05] that you're walking through the valley
[1:09:06] of the shadow of death by yourself all
[1:09:10] on your own nobody understands where
[1:09:12] you're at nobody understands where
[1:09:14] you're going on the trial that you're
[1:09:16] facing tonight but you didn't go through
[1:09:19] that Valley on your own he led you
[1:09:21] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:09:23] death so you're not there by yourself
[1:09:26] but there's somebody that's leading you
[1:09:28] through that Valley now why would this
[1:09:30] great Shepherd lead us into the valley
[1:09:32] of the shadow of
[1:09:34] there because there's something on the
[1:09:37] other side of that Valley that he wants
[1:09:39] us to have there's something on the
[1:09:42] other side of that that he sees a
[1:09:44] perfect view can I say it like this God
[1:09:48] in his mind sees of you that you're not
[1:09:52] there yet right does that make sense
[1:09:55] right is that translate okay there's a
[1:09:58] you that God sees in his mind and you're
[1:10:01] not there yet so the great Shepherd is
[1:10:04] leading you to that you he's leading you
[1:10:07] to that perfect picture of you that he
[1:10:10] has in his mind he not so much just
[1:10:13] leading us to what he thinks will happen
[1:10:16] but he already sees a perfect picture of
[1:10:18] us and he's leading us to Perfection be
[1:10:22] ye perfect even as your father is
[1:10:24] perfect
[1:10:25] how would we ever be perfect in this
[1:10:28] Fallen flesh but he's leading us to
[1:10:31] something he's leading us somewhere he
[1:10:33] didn't just leave us at the River Jordan
[1:10:35] he didn't just leave us at the baptism
[1:10:37] of the Holy Ghost but he's leading us to
[1:10:40] somewhere it's the Perfection of the
[1:10:43] church you might not feel like it but
[1:10:46] there's a perfect you you might not
[1:10:48] recognize it tonight but there's a
[1:10:50] perfect view and if we can just put on
[1:10:53] God's glasses for a moment tonight just
[1:10:55] put on God's vision of us God doesn't
[1:10:58] see the mistakes that you think he sees
[1:11:00] he doesn't see the errors that you think
[1:11:02] he sees but when God looks at you he's
[1:11:06] looking through the blood of Christ so
[1:11:08] he sees a perfect sacrifice so he's not
[1:11:11] looking at your error he's looking at a
[1:11:14] perfect sacrifice I know we're just
[1:11:17] backgrounding a little bit bu I hope
[1:11:18] we're okay tonight is that okay I know
[1:11:21] that long road trips can be hard on you
[1:11:24] I'm going to best that we just stay
[1:11:27] awake you got to stand up stand up we're
[1:11:31] going to use this room house the Lord
[1:11:33] tonight I it's okay it's a banquet hall
[1:11:37] I dressed for a banet I
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:48] prepared something before you can get to
[1:11:50] the bank you have to go through
[1:11:53] something before you can arrive to the T
[1:11:56] but it wouldn't be a victory if we just
[1:11:58] showed up at the table we said feed me
[1:12:01] but through the trial of our faith we're
[1:12:04] arriving at this B we're coming to the
[1:12:06] king's feast tonight and and we look at
[1:12:09] this scripture Psalms Psalms
[1:12:12] 23 thou preparest the table before me in
[1:12:18] the presence of my
[1:12:21] enemies it's puzzling to
[1:12:23] me why would God prepare a table with
[1:12:28] all of your enemies
[1:12:35] there anybody that you've ever had beef
[1:12:38] with
[1:12:41] i for the top of anybody that's ever
[1:12:44] crossed your path in the wrong
[1:12:47] way and here your shepher has prepared a
[1:12:51] table of all of them imagine you walking
[1:12:54] into a room
[1:12:56] and every enemy you have is sitting at
[1:12:59] this
[1:13:02] table it' be pretty troubling
[1:13:05] right and we're probably putting
[1:13:07] physical attributes in this so and so
[1:13:10] sit
[1:13:11] there there she's sitting there she's
[1:13:15] sitting there you know but it's not that
[1:13:17] kind of
[1:13:18] table David's not talking about physical
[1:13:22] persecution David's talking about
[1:13:26] and the Lord prepared a table for David
[1:13:29] in the presence of his enemies now why
[1:13:32] would God set up a banquet for all of
[1:13:36] your
[1:13:36] enemies for all of David's enemies but
[1:13:40] there would have to be a purpose behind
[1:13:41] this right there would have to be a
[1:13:43] reason behind this God wouldn't just
[1:13:46] have you sit at a table full of all of
[1:13:49] your opposition for no reason but God
[1:13:52] has gathered together all of David's
[1:13:55] enemies for one purpose so that David
[1:13:58] can overcome all of his
[1:14:02] enemies you God hased all together for
[1:14:08] one purpose because there will be an
[1:14:14] overom will be there will be a group
[1:14:19] ofies overcome eny
[1:14:26] work will be
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:30] over I don't want
[1:14:32] toarch let God gather together all of my
[1:14:35] enemies and I say it's a set up it's a
[1:14:39] set
[1:14:40] up it's a trap it's a trap God gathered
[1:14:44] together all of David's enemies because
[1:14:46] he was going to kill them all right at
[1:14:48] the same time he was going to gather
[1:14:50] together all B tries all together at the
[1:14:54] same
[1:14:56] because it was a trap let me say to you
[1:14:58] tonight you probably drug some things in
[1:15:01] here tonight you probably drug some
[1:15:03] doubt in here tonight maybe there's some
[1:15:05] cancer in here maybe there's some
[1:15:09] diabetes maybe there's some
[1:15:12] some maybe there's some worries some
[1:15:15] grief some grief in here but it's a TR
[1:15:20] the devil has
[1:15:22] come you are the
[1:15:26] theil came
[1:15:29] here the
[1:15:31] devil came here to die he came here into
[1:15:37] a
[1:15:37] trap yes so you might have thought you
[1:15:40] were heavy laden and
[1:15:43] downed but you had to bring him
[1:15:45] here it's a
[1:15:48] trap it's an appointment and God never
[1:15:51] misses his
[1:15:52] appointment God made a divine
[1:15:56] you might have just thought today well I
[1:15:58] just come to that meeting CU I have
[1:15:59] nothing better to
[1:16:00] do but God had this in mind before the
[1:16:04] foundation of the world he saw you going
[1:16:07] through your trial and he set up a
[1:16:09] banquet he said I'll meet them there at
[1:16:12] that appoint in time Friday evening
[1:16:15] they'll come in heavy L they'll walk out
[1:16:18] of
[1:16:24] [Applause]
[1:16:30] pray for pray for
[1:16:32] him
[1:16:36] sorry from the other just getting ready
[1:16:40] for get ready for
[1:16:55] all right first night it's always a
[1:16:56] little technical set
[1:17:00] up
[1:17:04] amen praise the Lord
[1:17:12] amen
[1:17:18] good so brother brandom says it like
[1:17:21] this we're in the channel of mortality
[1:17:25] this is the only time that you'll be
[1:17:28] mortal this is the only time that you'll
[1:17:31] have a chance to praise him as a
[1:17:34] mortal this is the only time that you'll
[1:17:37] have the chance to overthrow the
[1:17:39] devil as a moral this is the only season
[1:17:43] of mortality for you because where we're
[1:17:46] going we're not we're not Mortals where
[1:17:49] we're going we're going to have an
[1:17:51] immortal body where we're going we're
[1:17:53] going to have a glorified body so this
[1:17:55] is your only chance as a mort now as we
[1:17:58] drop into this channel mortality for
[1:18:00] time sake I'm not going to read a lot
[1:18:02] tonight but if you want the ques I've
[1:18:03] got brother I've got brother says that
[1:18:08] we're dropped into this realm of
[1:18:10] mortality for just a season for just a
[1:18:13] moment and what we do in this moment of
[1:18:16] mortality is influenced by what we're
[1:18:18] feeding he would tell the story of the
[1:18:21] the chief right the the Indian chief
[1:18:23] well I have a black not white the
[1:18:27] story I'll explain it there's a few that
[1:18:30] don't brother B has an interaction with
[1:18:32] an old CH and the chief tells him I have
[1:18:36] a battle going on
[1:18:37] inside and I I I I don't know who's
[1:18:40] going to win the battle he says I have a
[1:18:42] black dog and a white dog and and and
[1:18:46] and they're fighting to have ninous in
[1:18:48] my mind and brother said well whatever
[1:18:51] dog you feed the most right if you feed
[1:18:54] the black dog
[1:18:55] the black dog will have the dominance if
[1:18:57] you Fe the white dog pretty simple right
[1:19:00] but in this realm of mortality we're in
[1:19:03] the same type of battle and what
[1:19:05] influence we lean to is what's going to
[1:19:08] win the fight now as as a mortal we can
[1:19:11] be influenced by only two things we
[1:19:14] either influenced by God or the devil we
[1:19:17] can't have both we're either influenced
[1:19:19] by God or the devil it's either good or
[1:19:23] evil right so if we narrow that down
[1:19:25] it's pretty easy to discern where our
[1:19:28] influence is coming from it's either
[1:19:31] good or it's evil if we want to win on
[1:19:33] the good side we feed the good side if
[1:19:37] we want to go to hell we feed the evil
[1:19:39] side right well I don't think anybody in
[1:19:42] here came tonight because we want to go
[1:19:44] to hell but we want to have a victory
[1:19:47] and so if we feed the Victorious do then
[1:19:50] we have a victory over that do it's by
[1:19:53] the influence
[1:19:56] now we can be influenced by man and we
[1:19:59] can be influenced by denomination we can
[1:20:02] be influenced by a lot of rails but when
[1:20:05] you break it down there's only two
[1:20:07] places that influence can come from God
[1:20:10] or the devil and when you divide that up
[1:20:14] you recognize right away I'm not really
[1:20:17] following the
[1:20:20] influence when I'm looking at all of the
[1:20:22] issues going on
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:26] all of the problems going on brother
[1:20:28] you've been in the message a minut
[1:20:29] you've been in the message a while
[1:20:31] you've seen some people come and some
[1:20:33] people go you see problems arise and
[1:20:37] problems come and problems go now when
[1:20:39] we start looking at all the problems we
[1:20:42] get influenced by those problems there's
[1:20:44] an influence that comes when we look at
[1:20:46] all the questions all of the wonderings
[1:20:49] and there's an influence that comes by
[1:20:51] that and we don't even recognize that's
[1:20:54] what's going on on but there's an
[1:20:56] influence behind those problems and if
[1:20:58] we start focusing on the problems then
[1:21:01] that's not feeding the white do but
[1:21:03] that's feeding those problems and the
[1:21:05] more voice we give those problems the
[1:21:08] more power they have and the further
[1:21:11] them yet see now you're being used to
[1:21:14] influence the devil's
[1:21:17] information we don't want to do
[1:21:19] that God's not a critical
[1:21:23] spirit God doesn't criticize everything
[1:21:25] that goes on so if we're voicing
[1:21:29] criticism we know where that's coming
[1:21:31] from we know the influence that we're
[1:21:33] under right and there's a spirit that
[1:21:36] comes behind every influence and we may
[1:21:39] not recognize it in totality but it just
[1:21:42] comes down to either good or evil God or
[1:21:46] the dev and I choose to be influenced by
[1:21:49] the word of
[1:21:50] God we can have questions we can have
[1:21:54] Fellowship
[1:21:55] you're not going to agree on every
[1:21:56] single point but at the end of the day I
[1:21:59] choose to be influenced by the word God
[1:22:03] because if I was under my own influence
[1:22:06] I wouldn't be standing here T I would be
[1:22:09] calling dead somewhere and got her
[1:22:12] somewhere somewhere not influence but
[1:22:15] God had an influence over my life the
[1:22:18] great Shepherd has been watching over me
[1:22:21] and as we give into his influence he is
[1:22:24] guiding us to the perect picture of us
[1:22:26] he's guiding us to that Perfection that
[1:22:28] weing
[1:22:30] for but we're going to have these trials
[1:22:32] in our lives of which influence we're
[1:22:34] going to fall
[1:22:36] under I I okay if I just tell this
[1:22:38] testimony come me there there's a
[1:22:40] brother that I
[1:22:42] know um I don't want to use any
[1:22:48] names but he had some questions arise in
[1:22:50] his
[1:22:51] church people began to question things
[1:22:54] question what about this what about this
[1:22:56] what about this is this true or is this
[1:22:58] not true look at this information this
[1:23:00] information you know every time that the
[1:23:02] critical spirit
[1:23:03] arises it's never originated at that
[1:23:06] person they heard it from somebody else
[1:23:09] they heard this thing from somebody else
[1:23:11] they didn't that question on their own
[1:23:14] but they heard it from somebody else
[1:23:16] they didn't arve it that of their own
[1:23:19] somebody influenc that this is wrong and
[1:23:21] this is wrong that's not right that's
[1:23:23] not right I know I'm a deacon at home
[1:23:26] everybody comes to me with their with
[1:23:28] their issues and their problems you know
[1:23:30] what if I don't go under the word I
[1:23:32] don't take it back to the word I become
[1:23:34] prone to listen to the influence of
[1:23:36] everybody else I to see all the issues
[1:23:39] see all the issues as as an eagle you
[1:23:43] have vision and you can see the issues
[1:23:46] and you can see the problems and you can
[1:23:48] see the The Faults and the failures
[1:23:51] because you have Eagle Vision but it's
[1:23:54] what you do with that it's what you do
[1:23:56] with seeing those issues that makes you
[1:23:59] an
[1:24:00] overcome so this brother to take in a
[1:24:03] lot of this criticism and and somebody
[1:24:05] said well this there's you know all
[1:24:07] these questions about the message and
[1:24:09] all these questions about what you
[1:24:10] believe you know this this man he he he
[1:24:13] was the pastor's son at this time and he
[1:24:17] thought well I'll go I'll go I'll just
[1:24:19] go study this out come on brother so I
[1:24:21] can I can you know know the questions
[1:24:23] for myself
[1:24:25] I'll just go research this out and it's
[1:24:27] not going to hurt me but but I need to
[1:24:30] know so that I can combat you see right
[1:24:33] away we recognize what
[1:24:35] influence that he's
[1:24:37] under so he pulls up one night his kids
[1:24:41] have gone to bed this is true story and
[1:24:44] his kids have gone to bed and and he
[1:24:46] gets on the computer he to look through
[1:24:49] some of these things he oh that's easy
[1:24:52] and I explain that after a while that
[1:24:55] influence he to wear down his face and
[1:24:59] he to look at some things and say maybe
[1:25:02] there is some truth to this and he said
[1:25:04] as soon as he said those words a spirit
[1:25:07] a manifested spirit out of the computer
[1:25:11] and started flying around his room now
[1:25:13] you might not believe in the
[1:25:14] Supernatural I've come way too far I
[1:25:17] know that these things I know that these
[1:25:19] Spirits are real and it started
[1:25:21] terrorizing his flying around the room
[1:25:24] he got he got up beside himself as soon
[1:25:26] as that Spirit came out his girls
[1:25:28] upstairs started screaming and his wife
[1:25:30] started screaming and there was an
[1:25:32] anointing that came into his house and
[1:25:34] he tried to rebuke it he said in the
[1:25:36] name of Jesus and he said that demon
[1:25:39] looked like a bull like a dark black
[1:25:41] bull crossed its
[1:25:46] arms he said it was that moment I
[1:25:49] realized I had lost I had lost the power
[1:25:53] in the name of Christ
[1:25:55] because I had begin to doubt and right
[1:25:58] there where he began to doubt he lost
[1:26:00] the influence that he was under came
[1:26:02] under this influence and his wife began
[1:26:05] to scream out she called the pastor he
[1:26:09] just Liv a couple doors down this was
[1:26:11] his son's house and and and the son's
[1:26:14] trying to cast this thing out it's just
[1:26:16] terring the comes in the door he says I
[1:26:19] rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:25] hallelujah now what was it one was
[1:26:28] influenced by reason and one was
[1:26:31] influenced by the message one was
[1:26:33] influenced by his imagination his
[1:26:35] conscience and one was influenced by
[1:26:37] Jesus Christ now there's been a banquet
[1:26:40] summon here tonight it's the greatest
[1:26:43] battle ever fought it's taking place in
[1:26:45] your life your reason your conscience
[1:26:47] your memory your affection are all that
[1:26:50] battle tonight but there's something
[1:26:53] greater than those influence
[1:26:55] there's something deeper down than that
[1:26:57] and if we can get to that influence down
[1:27:00] there we can
[1:27:03] overcome or I moving too
[1:27:06] fast we can overcome
[1:27:08] that we all have memory we all have
[1:27:12] reason but they're not always
[1:27:16] right that's right your reason will be
[1:27:21] wrong your memory will be wrong we can
[1:27:24] have a recollection of this night as our
[1:27:26] memories all be different your memory
[1:27:29] can be wrong your conscience can be
[1:27:31] wrong some people have a conscience to
[1:27:34] do what you never dream their conscience
[1:27:37] is wrong so we cannot rely on those high
[1:27:40] things but there must be an
[1:27:43] overthrow there must be one king you
[1:27:46] can't have five Kings there's got to be
[1:27:49] one king there's got to be one ruler
[1:27:52] over all that we go through one
[1:27:55] influence over all of our lives and this
[1:27:58] ruler this king is the king of all

[1:28:07] Kings every sickness subject under this
[1:28:11] King there is nothing too great that

[1:38:13] pillar with the prophet messenger
[1:38:16] underneath he said we thank God that a
[1:38:18] light came this
[1:38:19] AG but today one of those men is not
[1:38:23] here
[1:38:26] but the other one still
[1:38:28] here one of those men is not here but
[1:38:31] the other one still one of those men's
[1:38:35] not here today but that has always been

[1:39:44] help because the light is coming let me
[1:39:47] say tonight the light has come down and
[1:39:51] there is no amount of Darkness
[1:39:55] I don't heav I I don't care

[1:40:04] the I think it's time to treat him like
[1:40:06] a king treat him like who he is our God
[1:40:11] our God our
[1:40:13] God is a consuming
[1:40:16] fire that's around
[1:40:23] no Darkness can in his presence for he's
[1:40:27] consuming fire I've seen God working
[1:40:31] I've seen God move I know what my can do
[1:40:34] I've seen the preaching of the word I've
[1:40:37] seen fulfillment while pet yet spake
[1:40:40] these words they were filled with the
[1:40:42] Holy Ghost I witnessed that in my life I
[1:40:45] witnessed the preaching of the
[1:40:47] Gospel destroy cancer with my own eyes I
[1:40:51] witnessed
[1:40:54] stand while the preacher was preaching
[1:40:57] while the preacher was preaching and the
[1:40:59] tumor fall out
[1:41:01] of my king is
[1:41:04] King cancer is not my
[1:41:07] king anxiety is
[1:41:10] not nervousness is not mying my king is
[1:41:14] King
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:27] iog a woman one time that recognized her
[1:41:32] King no matter what the critics said she
[1:41:35] had to get to Jesus Through the Hall of
[1:41:38] critics wasn't worthy shouldn't have
[1:41:41] been in there walking through a table
[1:41:44] of everybody in that room knew what she
[1:41:47] was who she was what she does she
[1:41:50] doesn't belong in here

[1:41:56] trap imagine brother Roberto how much we
[1:42:00] in condemnation she battled to get into
[1:42:03] that
[1:42:05] room how much was on her to get into
[1:42:09] that room I imagine she walked in that
[1:42:12] room probably didn't want to look
[1:42:16] up but she had to get to Jesus no matter
[1:42:19] what anybody else was say she had to get
[1:42:22] to Jesus
[1:42:23] and I imagine that after he told her thy
[1:42:29] sins are all
[1:42:32] forg imag she there a little different
[1:42:36] than
[1:42:38] she with a little bit lighter step she

[1:48:29] Mir I was preaching to meeting one time
[1:48:32] and there was a young girl there I
[1:48:34] didn't know it I didn't even know her
[1:48:36] name at the time and her parents didn't
[1:48:38] know it but she was planning after that
[1:48:41] service she was going to move out of her
[1:48:43] parents house she had an apartment set
[1:48:46] up with friend she was going to leave

[1:49:26] place there was a battle going on

[1:49:32] Spirits you're either going to listen to
[1:49:33] one or the other and AD ministering
