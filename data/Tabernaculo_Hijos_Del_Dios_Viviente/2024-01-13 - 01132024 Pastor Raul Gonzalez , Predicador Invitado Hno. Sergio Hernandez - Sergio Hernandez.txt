Bibles in the Book of Luke chapter 17 we're going to read verse one through verse 6 alul say St Luke chapter 17 verse 1 through verse six Hallelujah when you have it say amen hallelujah I'm just going

bless you you may be seated Hallelujah it is good to be here and want today uh we're going to speak about the syamore tree engl tree what is a tree anybody knows so I went to look for it what is San tree a San tree is an invasive malberry moras how many of you know what moras are I mean blackberries you know what blackberries are yes blackberries not the phone the berries H lasas um but uh so I I'm looking for for what the the the um mberry tree is or the tree is I I found this article about a person has tree mberry so remember Jesus when Jesus said when if you have f as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this he's talking about a mberry tree then Jesus would say you could say to this berry tree be pluck up by the root and be plant in the sea and he should oby you now what is a mberry tree a a mberry tree is an invasive plant inv it's uh uh uh blackberries Las moras they grow really fast but they they grow uh they can grow 20 20 feet tall but also the roots grow very fast so let me just read this article okay like why you reading this article brother Bram one day he was in waiting I think for the train or something he read that the comic part of the newspaper and in it there was a story about some chickens and in the chicken pan there was a a rooster who taught himself to be very intelligent and he knew how to read and one morning that rooster he read he read in the newspaper that the volum of the chickens had increased and he was very happy said come here everybody gather up gather up see what the newspaper says all value has increased what do you think was going to happen to the chicken now the farm knew he was going to make some more money right Hallelujah so let me read this article question my 15year old mberry tree provides wonderful shade in the summer but it is growing into power line and my neighbor says his roots are damaging her underground sprinkler system uh R subterraneo so there was a problem so it was growing up but it was growing down can I can I prune the roots to keep them out Garden should I replace a tree and the lady's name is Sandra Todd from California California wow the answer so just remember we're talking about the and the reason I I got interested in this is because every time you read a Bible verse you cannot just stay with that Bible verse you have to go at least you know three four verses up and three four verses down so you'll be able to understand what that verse is saying otherwise you won't be able to understand it Allelujah Look what Jesus says before he goes before verse six [Music] me verse one Jesus says it's impossible for the offense to come or for the offense not to come so the first thing that Jesus is telling us the offense will come number one do you understand that the offense will come offense who will be your offenser or your offender off look around you it's one of those people that are around you they could offend [Music] you and more than once imagine that person will offend you your husband will offend you your wife will offend you and you will offend someone isn't that what Jesus saying it is impossible but that the offense will come but unto him through they come so yes we will receive offense but why is it well unto him because sometimes we make people [Music] stumble and the problem is not when when we offend the problem the problem is when we are not willing to ask for forgiveness that's where the problem is Allelujah verse three take he yourselves take care of yourself in other words how are you going to take care of yourself Jesus is telling you the offense offense well come it's a it's a warning he's not saying don't worry my child you will never be offended everything is GNA be beautiful beautiful flowerses a beautiful sky the Sun is going to be shining all [Applause] everything is going to be beautiful you will never be hurt that's not what Jesus said Jesus is saying the offense welcome but he's also warning us take care of yourself quitness say protect you yourself that's what that's what saying in um verse three take heed of yourself to yourself how are you gonna protect yourself from the offense you want to know the answer how can I get protected from the offense well the answer is right there but we go too fast we don't understand it verse three if your brother trespasses against [Music] you rebuke him so if your brother does something against you don't go around the church telling everybody about what the brother did to you even if he a brother from another church Jesus says if that brother if that sister offends you rebuke him rebuke her that's biblical you go to that brother you go to that sister of course if you're a brother don't go to that sister take take your wife with you take the pastor with you if you're a sister don't go to that brother take your husband with you take the pastor with you that brother that sister they need to know that they offended you you know what I mean that's how you protect yourself but that's not that's not Jesus is not saying going you offended me you're guilty and you go to hell that's not what Jesus is saying at all you're going to tell the brother you offended me what by by what you said or what you did let's continue verse three and if he repents forgive him how is that how can I protect what that's not protecting [Music] myself that's you mean to tell me that I have to forgive you that's what Jesus is saying the way to protect yourself from the offense it's by forgiving why see because when you forgive someone you no longer have that load Hallelujah verse four look Jesus goes even beyond that and if he trespasses against you seven times in a day what and seven times and seven times a day he turns again to you saying I Repent you shall forgive him you shall forgive him is that hard to do if you say that's easy that you're lying but what we're preaching tonight is hard to do amen amen God WR the verse five it says the disciples increase our faith they're telling Jesus increase our faith for what what for to do what to forgive increase our faith to forgive that's hard but not impossible it's Theos that's the difference amen that's why Jesus said in verse you you can say to this m be plug up from the roots and be plant into the sea and he should be and he should obey you so what is [Music] the what is what does it represent somebody can tell me what does a mry represent he's talking about Roots roots of bitterness when we don't forgive someone when we don't have the power to forgive someone then that little seed of bitterness how many of you have seen a seed and how it begins to spring up the first thing that any seed grows it's a root so before we go to the article let's go to the book of Hebrews Hallelujah Hebrews chapter 12 so remember this Hebrews chapter 12 remember remember this the only way to protect yourself against an offense it's by forgiving the other person that's Jesus is not brother saying it is not me saying it who is saying it God on Earth Earth he said to us to protect yourself from an offense you have to forgive the other person verse uh 14 of Hebrews 12 follow peace with men and Holiness without which no one shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God so some people may fail to reach God's grace and thereby um well I'm sorry let's let's go back F of God's grace lest any root of bitterness is springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so you see what what Jesus is telling us Jesus is telling us you need to have faith to forgive because you don't want those roots because once those roots grow in they're going to find the ground and they GNA they going to go inside the ground they're going to root themselves verse 16 let there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one Mar of meat sold his Birthright for you know how that afterward when he would have inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found a place of repentance though he saw it carefully with tears amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so now we're getting somewhere the mber tree let's go back to the mberry tree so this lady Miss Sandra Sandra she didn't know we were going to be talking about her tonight but we want to ask her for forgiveness but learn this if you put something online it's for the public to see it and anybody can use it unless you put in this is only for my followers or my friends and no one has the right to copy these but she didn't write that that's what that's why I'm talking about this look look at the answer so she has a mry tree tree and is growing and touching the electric lines but it's also touching the sprinkler system of the neighbor so she's in troubles problemas the answer that the gardener give her and I like this because one day a little woman in she was looking for Jesus and she saw a gardener and she asked the gardener where do you play the master and he he turned around and she he said Mary Maria and she recognized that Gardener and she call him ronon which means Maestro Master Maestro the answer here B diplomacy between neighbors is always delicate yeah the neighbor has flowers you want to have flowers too right the neighbor plants a tree you always want to plant a tree right the neighbor has a beautiful yard you want it better amen it's always diplomacy and is delicate diploma isic and in this case the responsibility to resolve the problem Falls on both [Music] parties so we're talking about an offenser offens and an offended person you know please think it in the spiritual okay mble Roots didn't cause the problem at least not at first it is physically impossible for roots to enter or puncture pipes to reach the water but they will follow the leaking water to its Sur and then squeeze through even the smallest hole or crack somewhere somehow her neighbor's sprinkler system must have sprung a leak Hallelujah attacking the M roots of the house next door to take attracting I'm sorry the leak must attract the M roots of the house next door to take a drink we have to think about this yes how long does it take for the roots of this mberry tree for the roots to go to the neighbor's house 15 years that's a long time and he was attracted by the leak of the sprinkler [Music] system he was attracted by the water of a leaking [Music] system it had a little crack and The mberry Roots follow that so what are we talking about we're talking about roots of bitterness roots of bitterness that have grown throughout the years we're talking about roots of bitterness that affect you but also roots of bitterness that affect your neighbor who's your neighbor your brother your sister your father your mother your child too your daughter to your husband toos your wife to your grandchildren to that's are we talking about roots of bitterness they grew in you but now they're trying to look for a little Lick in somebody else's life to get themselves into it look what the what the guy say don't bother trying to cut the roots or dig a trange to put up a concrete or plastic root barrier no why whenever the water is the roots will find it even diving under barrier even diving under barriers up to 4T deep inclus first the sprinkler pipe be fixed they are wasting water thead news for you is that mberry trees should the sad news the sad news for you is that that mberry tree should probably go away but this how you want to fix the problem all of us except the little babies except each one of us has been offended at one point or another it's true and we let that bitterness grow and it's a root grows tall but it grows deep also it affects your life but it also affects the life of those around you how we fix that the guy gave us the answer the gardener gave us the answer how do you fix it by cutting the roots no if you just cut the roots those roots are going to grow again because they're trying to find a place where they can feed themselves from your bitterness my bitterness meura always finds a place where it can feed itself amen now don't think why didn't that sister came was all for her no it was for you forget about anybody else and look inside your life how was affected since as you were a little child and how those roots of bitterness began to just grow in you and many times we don't even realize but we are feeding that bitterness you know we're feeding it instead of forgiving and we go back and we try to be the winners well he's not going to win this argument she's not going to win this argument Jesus did not say when the argument Jesus said forgive amen you know Jesus says to forgive if they come and ask for forgiveness because but what if they don't for what if they don't want to ask for forgiveness are you going to keep that root there then you must forgive even if they don't ask you for forgiveness see the guy says the gardener says you have to cut the whole tree from the roots and get get rid of it amen amen my wife asked me to to cut two trees in my house she didn't like them of course be myself I have a I have a I have an elect the trees were not big and the the the trunk was this thck so when my wife didn't look hi so when my wife didn't look I just went to the bottom of the ground and I caught from the trunk why because I want the trees so the minute this the minute spring comes back I'm wna grab the trees and put them somewhere else maybe I should do that right now when it's you know winter so they can go grow somewhere else that's that's what we do but we try to act like we don't have we only cut the trunk I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free I'm so glad Jesus set me free right now you have to cut it from The Roots there's the [Applause] [Music] something to dig it down dig it all the way down and cut it from The Roots look at look at what brother says hallelujah 6:35 but if you just try to do it you're going to fail that's what a lot of a lot of times we've been doing we're trying to get rid of the bitterness by ourselves and brother says you're G to fail and you got to fail why because you cannot do it by yourself you see when people have bitterness it grows into a lot of other issues and a lot of a lot of people when when when they cannot deal with that bitterness they go to the psychiatrist go to psychologist they give you pills but the the only thing that is doing is cutting is cutting your bitterness from the trunk the only way that bitterness can be cut from The Roots the is by surrendering it to [Music] Jesus I don't want this anymore do but I'm tired of in this tree in my [Music] heart I'm tell of seeing my family been hurt because of the bitterness that I carry amen now don't try to figure out how that other person can get rid of their bitterness no no forget about that you have to figure out how you can get rid of your bitterness Hallelujah that's the reason you have your your abs and and it's ins and outs you see a lot of people there in church they coming in out in out why because they car a bitterness and that bitterness cannot be fed here in church is [Music] amen huah they come to church they hear the word they feel good for a little bit they're cutting the trunk but they keep coming to church and you know [Music] what it'sing of B begins to ask for more water and and the only way to feed it is to go back where you were at watch out amen you not kill that bitterness then keep coming to church little by little that root of bitterness is going to die yes I'm don't stay home keep coming to church keep coming to church keep reading your Bible keep [Music] praying Hallelujah and and and ins and outs and all the things you're doing is because you tried to do it you say all I believe I'm all right now all this is and I've seen it many times people like I'm I'm good now I feel better now how many of you have taken antibiotics the doctor gives you a botle of antibiotics what is it for what you do how how you combat that infection you grab that bot and then you put it right here or you take it right right you open the bottle you open the botle uhuh you grab one pill you grab some water or orange juice no not orange juice Coke no water okay water okay I'm sorry you grab water you grab the pill it fits too big cut it in half put it in your mouth the back of your tongue and then you drink the water Big G went through get now you have to grab the other one you put it in your mouth the back of your mouth you drink the water give a good big go what are you doing brother Sergio I'm teaching you how to destroy the illness but you look at it you take it for three days wow I feel really good now I don't need the rest of the pills I'm just going to put it out the Shelf you have little faith the first thing you did you make that illness weaker but you didn't kill it in order to kill that illness you gotta finish the whole bottle 10 days of antibiotics hallelujah amen people come to church they they leave their loads here they they feel good but then they stop coming that bitterness got weaker but you know what happens with an infection when you only take half of the medication when you only take two qu of the medication the only thing you did was the only thing you did you got that infection but that infection is gonna create more babies and those babies when they grow in their DNA that's how demonic this is in their DNA they create a defense against the medication that you were taking why it's G to happen maybe not tomorrow maybe not not in a week but later your condition is going to get worse than what it was before to he said well I have faith brother Sergio if you really had Fai you never would have gone to that doctor you would have come to letter the pastor and ask him to pray for you so don't tell me about faith take the whole regimen take the whole Bott one pill day if it's two take two Tom because that's the only way you're going to destroy that we talking about root of bitterness the only way to destroy it is to keep coming because for this root of bitterness a little pill is not gonna kill it you need to have antibotics to destroy that R of bitterness but it has to come through an IV to your veins said why you talking about what the church needs Aus from the veins of Emmanuel you keep coming and you keep get a transfusion those roots of bitterness get completely kill hallelujah hallelujah right that a it that isn't it no no it is the holy spirit that comes in so unless you know you have the Holy Ghost you only cutting the roots of bitterness or mberry Morita from the trunk and all of a sudden you see the little brother he came to church he danc in the spirit spok in Tong amen I know the words Hallelujah then all of a sudden you see them in the world and they begin to speak other Tong amen why because that root of bitterness is still there and it's fitting from somewhere when you go home what do you do what do you feed yourself soul with amen he takes the place the Holy Ghost takes a place he takes all that roots of bitterness the old anger the old temper the jealousy and the love of the world and all the things takes it all out of you and then you're a new creature how come on how the only way we can do it is through the Holy Ghost amen dwelling in you you know that God forgives you right how many of you know that God has forgiven you you see but because God forgave you doesn't mean he trusts you you know that read the book of Acts I don't know if it's chapter 4 or chapter 5 but Peter says God gives the Holy Ghost to those who obey him God gives the Holy Ghost to Those whom he trusts God forgave you amen God forgave me amen the question is can God trust me brother was confing me Allelujah that is a big question cuz he's not going to place go in you he's not going to make you the pra pres of the United States what he's placing in you his holy spirit so he needs to trust you amen because that's a lot that's a lot Hallelujah first Samuel hallelujah we're gonna finish in a little bit about two hours more and we're done 1 Samuel chapter 1 un verse 9 let's look at people with bitterness in the Bible did you know that the Bible is full of people with bitterness let's look at one little woman 1 Samuel 1 verse 9 and then tomorrow we're going to see another person God's willing I want to help you car your because sometimes we carry a big load and it destroys us and then it also destroys everybody around US 1 Samuel 1 ver9 says so Hanah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk and Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and pray unto the Lord and wept sore abundant where do you bring your bitterness to Hanah brought her bitterness to the Lord the only way we can get rid of that root of bitterness is by bringing it to the Lord amen if you you read that chapter um her husband had two wives one was able to give him children and was not able to have children so the other wife was really mean to to Hanah and it was always making her feel bad simp you have people like that in your life CU I'm telling you because I have people like that in my life amen we're humans people are always making you feel bad no matter what you try how you try it they're like well I'm better than you well you know you're not blessed because you know why I'm and they make you cry they make you miserable and you feel miserable and you don't know what to do you see Hannah did not take this against the other wife Hannah brought it before the Lord and she cried before the Lord look reading Eli the priest he didn't understand what was going on because not that many people came to the house of the Lord to cry know the of the house of the Lord needs to be filled with tears of his people we should not be afraid to sh feelings before God I have G before the I have the this you this brother this sister they're causing me all this pain that's what I've been doing he's not angry at you when you go before him and you tell him how you feel blessed be the name of the Lord Han told him how she felt El didn't understand what was going on because no one had ever come to the house of the Lord to that to open heart to the Lord he thought she was drunk cuz she was not even speaking anything she was just moving her lips love but she was and Eli thought she was drunk but she said my Lord I'm not drunk but I have bitterness in my heart and I have ped my soul before the Lord you what said said whatever you ask to the Lord it shall be given to you says was not even a good priest but God answered what that priest spoke not because he was a good priest or a bad priest but because of the position he had in the of God Amen when you come to God and you you P your soul before him
