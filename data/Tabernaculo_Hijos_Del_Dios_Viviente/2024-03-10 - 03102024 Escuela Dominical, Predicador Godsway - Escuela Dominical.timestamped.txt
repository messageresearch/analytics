[0:00] Jesus
[0:02] Christ and you look how why should it be
[0:04] a donkey but not a horse or a
[0:13] chariot but we saw a donkey is Meek and
[0:18] humble and that is an attitude required
[0:21] of we who call our
[0:25] Christians you need to be meek we need
[0:28] to be meek need
[0:36] to and
[0:38] Obey and when we do
[0:41] that then we saw that Jesus was riding
[0:43] on the
[0:49] donkey and that's what we want our life
[0:52] to
[0:54] be that Jesus is riding on
[0:58] us
[1:01] not man need to die to their own
[1:08] self I would like to read
[1:12] something maybe I'll will read from
[1:14] Ephesians
[1:24] 422 I don't know if you are
[1:28] there we are still talking about
[1:34] self
[1:38] yeah why we need to put our way
[1:43] self you know y night yesterday yeah I
[1:49] posted
[1:50] something I posted something um
[1:54] um and I was thinking I P Christianity
[1:57] is
[1:58] sacrifice
[2:03] and I was reasoning about
[2:06] it and I said Christ
[2:10] died and that is a sacrifice Jesus did
[2:13] for
[2:16] us and the sacrifice we need to
[2:19] do is to die to
[2:23] ourself and live for
[2:26] Christ that is what is being required of
[2:28] us if we call our
[2:33] Christians and I'm
[2:35] reading that you put off concerning the
[2:38] foral conversation the old
[2:43] man ior you know
[2:51] problem which is corrupt according to
[2:53] the deceitful
[2:57] last and be renewed in the Spirit of
[3:00] your
[3:02] mind so you have the old
[3:08] man and that old man is
[3:12] yourself and the other time we saw that
[3:16] we saw
[3:17] that no Christianity is not about doing
[3:23] good yeah doing good is very
[3:27] important Christianity is not good
[3:34] morals but good morals is very
[3:38] important but you
[3:40] know in addition of the good
[3:45] morals we need to see the authority of
[3:48] Jesus Christ in your
[3:55] life no people a lot of people think I
[3:58] might make it to the kingdom of but if I
[4:00] do it
[4:04] right if you could go back into the
[4:08] Bible look at this Young Rich Young
[4:12] Ruler he said I obeyed all the Ten
[4:15] Commandments since
[4:19] infancy you know when he came to
[4:22] Jesus he wanted
[4:25] salvation and Jesus said go obey the Ten
[4:28] Commandments
[4:31] so I've been doing that since I was a
[4:33] [Music]
[4:35] child he was a just man according to the
[4:39] law but he missed
[4:42] something it's what there is authority
[4:44] of Jesus Christ in his
[4:47] life but Jesus saw the problem of this
[4:49] Rich Young
[4:52] Ruler and he told me go and sell
[4:55] whatever you
[4:57] have and he said where am man where a
[5:00] man's heart where a man heart
[5:05] is or where a man's desire
[5:08] is that's where his heart
[5:11] is and the Rich Young
[5:15] Ruler look at his
[5:18] status status who he
[5:23] was he said I'm going to sell my
[5:27] gos and and come and follow this
[5:31] man no
[5:32] way he was looking at
[5:35] himself and come and carry my
[5:38] cross and follow this
[5:41] man often
[5:43] times says something I love so
[5:46] much he said for the selling of the
[5:49] goose for the Rich Young
[5:51] Ruler to sell his
[5:54] resources and give it to the
[5:56] poor that was not a problem for him
[6:01] but for him to carry his
[6:04] cross and follow Jesus Christ that was
[6:07] his problem and often time that is our
[6:11] problem we want to worship
[6:14] God but we want to do it our own
[6:18] way we want to follow God but we want to
[6:22] do it our own
[6:23] way but my
[6:25] brother my sister if you want to follow
[6:28] God
[6:29] they need to die to yourself and you
[6:32] need to let God lead you you need to let
[6:35] God direct you and you know whenever we
[6:38] come to
[6:39] Christianity there's a price to be
[6:42] paid Jesus paid a price to Redeem Me And
[6:46] You from our sins but for me and you we
[6:51] also need to pay a
[6:53] price by dying to ourself dying to our
[6:57] freedom dying to our right right and
[7:00] living a Lifest as a
[7:03] Christian that is what is required of us
[7:06] today I made my mind to finish very
[7:09] early today I made my mind to finish
[7:11] very
[7:13] early and I want to read something from
[7:15] colians
[7:17] 3:9
[7:21] yeah
[7:24] 39 Oh 39 yeah 39 yeah 39
[7:33] I
[7:34] know you need to know the old
[7:40] self and the Deeds of the
[7:46] self so that when you are living your
[7:50] life you get to know that what I'm doing
[7:53] is not the deed of the
[7:57] self but is the
[7:59] is the deed of Jesus
[8:01] Christ in
[8:03] me I'm
[8:05] reading lie not one to
[8:09] another seeing that ye put off the old
[8:14] [Music]
[8:15] man with his
[8:18] deeds
[8:20] we we have we all read the scripture I
[8:23] hope everybody is
[8:25] following and the
[8:28] Bible is telling me and you that we
[8:31] should not lie to our own
[8:35] self we should not deceive one
[8:40] another seeing that
[8:43] seeing ye have put off the old
[8:48] man and this is like is an
[8:51] instruction it's an
[8:55] instruction when is telling us
[8:57] that we need to put off the old
[9:02] man and what is the old
[9:05] man it is the old nature of
[9:09] you andam said don't be
[9:14] deceived because the old nature of a
[9:17] man know how to do
[9:20] good the old nature of a man also comes
[9:24] to
[9:25] church also give things to people don't
[9:29] be
[9:30] deceived but you need to make sure you
[9:34] have put off that old
[9:36] man that old man if they talk about your
[9:39] sins you are
[9:43] angry that old man of quick
[9:48] temper that old man of
[9:55] impatience that old man of condemning
[9:58] people
[10:01] you have to make sure you put off that
[10:02] old
[10:04] man and that same with his
[10:08] deeds with his deeds is not only the old
[10:13] man it's not only the old man only the
[10:17] old man
[10:19] yeah yeah that is is not about putting
[10:23] away the old man
[10:26] oing but along with his deeds
[10:30] that me it's not only about your
[10:33] nature but that nature of
[10:37] yours need to be taken away
[10:41] completely and everything associated
[10:44] with the old
[10:46] man should be taken away from
[10:49] you and some are H are some of the
[10:52] nature or the attitude or the de of the
[10:54] old
[10:57] man eny
[11:01] Envy
[11:05] Envy Envy or
[11:08] jealous
[11:10] impatience
[11:12] fornication
[11:14] adultery and most
[11:17] importantly Disobedience to the word of
[11:21] God that is the most important
[11:24] thing said no fornication is not a sin
[11:30] but sin means
[11:33] unbelief because you don't believe in
[11:35] the word of
[11:37] God that is the reason why you do those
[11:39] stuffs because all these stuffs they are
[11:43] just an
[11:44] attribute of sin but if you believe the
[11:47] word of God there is no way you're going
[11:50] to go against the word of
[11:52] God so the most important thing is to
[11:56] obey the word of
[11:57] God and now
[12:00] I'll become a bad
[12:02] person if I tell you you should put away
[12:06] your old
[12:07] nature and I don't tell
[12:10] you how to get a new
[12:13] nature and because of
[12:16] that I'll let us to open to the Book of
[12:19] Matthew chapter
[12:21] 16 vers
[12:27] 24 and see what
[12:31] Jesus is expecting from
[12:35] us you
[12:37] know you have to tell the people where
[12:41] they
[12:43] are and show them where they have to
[12:46] be and tell them in between who can help
[12:49] them get
[12:52] there and I us to tell
[12:55] you ask for me I can't help
[12:57] you I can't have even
[13:00] myself it's only
[13:02] Jesus that can help
[13:05] us I'm read Matthew
[13:10] 16:4 then said Jesus unto his
[13:14] disciples If any man will come after
[13:18] me so if you want to go after
[13:22] Jesus then let's see the condition Jesus
[13:25] is
[13:27] given if any come after
[13:31] me let him deny
[13:34] himself that if you want to follow
[13:37] Christ then you need to deny
[13:40] yourself of your
[13:42] right your
[13:44] freedom your
[13:46] thinking
[13:48] everything to Christ to take
[13:53] control If any man will come after
[13:56] me let him deny him
[13:59] himself does it end up denying does it
[14:02] end with denying
[14:05] yourself let's look at what Jesus is
[14:08] saying after denying
[14:11] yourself take up his
[14:14] cross not take up your cross not take up
[14:17] your
[14:19] cross you deny
[14:22] yourself then you take out the cross of
[14:25] Jesus Christ The Suffering of Jesus
[14:28] Christ
[14:29] the suffering of standing for the word
[14:31] of
[14:32] God the suffering that comes with don't
[14:35] neglect your
[14:38] children the suff that come with you
[14:40] need to make sure the devotion is being
[14:43] done in the
[14:45] house the the suffering and devotion
[14:47] need to be done in the
[14:52] houseing
[14:57] right
[14:59] the suffering that you have to be
[15:00] patient when somebody is annoying
[15:06] you the suffering that you have to St
[15:08] away from the alcohol bottles when you
[15:10] want to
[15:18] drink the suffering that need to love
[15:20] your
[15:23] wife there suffing you need to submit to
[15:25] your
[15:27] husband that is the cross you have to
[15:30] carry if you want to go after
[15:33] Jesus you deny
[15:36] yourself to deny yourself is to take
[15:39] away all your
[15:41] rights take away all your
[15:43] freedom then let Christ take
[15:46] over if the word of God says
[15:49] this if the word of God says this then
[15:52] you do
[15:54] exactly and that is where we want to
[15:56] come
[15:57] to point that it is the
[16:02] authority of Jesus Christ in our life
[16:06] that your
[16:08] lifestyle is not about
[16:11] you but it's about Jesus Christ you know
[16:15] you know the
[16:18] apostles they had their their name
[16:21] Christians in
[16:24] Antioch because of the life they were
[16:27] living people of
[16:30] Antioch look at these
[16:32] people and said these people are the
[16:35] indeed the Disciples of
[16:39] Christ and for that
[16:41] matter we call them
[16:44] Christians that means if you call
[16:46] ourself
[16:47] Christians then we need to live like
[16:50] Christ so we die to
[16:52] ourselves then we start living like
[16:55] Christ by so doing It Is by so doing it
[17:01] is by so
[17:05] doing that we can show to the
[17:08] world we are the disciple of Christ
[17:13] Jesus and I
[17:15] said let him deny
[17:18] himself and take out his
[17:21] cross without and just taking your
[17:26] cross but what and follow me
[17:29] so die to
[17:31] yourself pick up your
[17:33] cross the way I like
[17:36] music the way I like wly music the the
[17:39] way you like what the way I like wly
[17:42] music the way you like wly
[17:45] music
[17:47] yeah
[17:52] yeah wedding wedley
[17:55] yeah and you look at this wly music you
[17:59] like and look at the wedding music you
[18:04] like
[18:12] yeah and you you look at the word of
[18:15] God they so I'm throwing it
[18:19] away from today
[18:21] on from today onwards from today
[18:25] onwards today and
[18:29] I want to follow
[18:31] Christ from today
[18:34] on I want Christ to be my
[18:38] king you know it's difficult and your
[18:42] friends will see you and your friends
[18:44] will see
[18:45] you and they will be pointing hands at
[18:49] you remember you are carrying the
[18:54] cross and your friends you might you
[18:56] might have been the best singer
[19:01] or the best
[19:03] dancer whatever you might be the
[19:07] best and we have to come to the
[19:10] point and said
[19:12] today and said
[19:16] today I'm letting it
[19:18] go and I want to follow
[19:21] Christ everybody need to pay a
[19:25] price Jesus paid a price by dying on the
[19:27] cross for me
[19:29] and and me and you need to pay the
[19:33] price of dying to
[19:36] ourself and carrying the
[19:39] cross and follow
[19:41] Jesus and you
[19:43] know often
[19:45] times we we tend to
[19:49] complain when we are not carrying the
[19:52] cross because the cross is
[19:55] heavy and if we are carrying the cross
[19:58] you don't get time to be looking
[20:01] around to be seeing what other people
[20:04] do but
[20:07] because we are not carrying the
[20:09] cross we are just F our eyes looking at
[20:12] what people are
[20:14] doing and try to and try to measure our
[20:18] Christianity by how people live their
[20:22] life I said don't justify
[20:25] your don't justify your sins by how
[20:28] people live their life don't justify
[20:31] ourselves yeah your sins by how people
[20:34] live your oh your sins
[20:39] no and don't measure your Christianity
[20:42] and don't measure your Christianity by
[20:44] how other people live their life you
[20:46] know
[20:48] um no
[20:56] me what by how people live their
[21:01] life the standard is Jesus Christ the
[21:04] standard is Jesus
[21:06] Christ so you ask
[21:09] yourself is this in line with the
[21:13] gospel it doesn't matter how you think
[21:16] it's
[21:18] right I used to see it doesn't matter
[21:21] how it
[21:23] is how it makes
[21:25] sense as long as it's against the word
[21:27] of
[21:29] God you have to forget about
[21:31] it because it is
[21:34] dangerous to be against
[21:36] God is very
[21:38] dangerous and to be against
[21:41] God is as simple as disobeying the word
[21:44] of
[21:45] God and often
[21:47] times I was just listening to a sermon
[21:52] yesterday a
[21:53] sermon and one Pastor
[21:56] said he said
[21:59] if somebody go
[22:00] fornicate if
[22:03] somebody and he come to the church and
[22:06] tell the
[22:07] church and you drive more than the speed
[22:15] limit and you two come to the church and
[22:18] tell the church I drove more than the
[22:21] speed
[22:22] limit I drove more than the speed
[22:26] limit
[22:28] I being woman we being wom we will be we
[22:32] be human like we sitting
[22:36] here we think the person want
[22:40] fornicate did a greater thing than the
[22:42] person who went above the speed limit
[22:46] did greater
[22:51] yeah in the presence of
[22:53] God there there is no category of sin
[22:57] there's no what there's no category for
[23:00] sin whether you went to
[23:03] fornicate you
[23:05] lied or you want more than the speed
[23:09] limit oh but said said we should obey
[23:12] the speed
[23:14] limit I was reading yester
[23:18] night we say even the
[23:21] scriptures say we should obey those who
[23:23] are in
[23:26] Authority so if we are
[23:29] Christians you have to make
[23:32] sure that we are
[23:35] doing as the scripture has
[23:40] commanded that is what makes us
[23:44] special that What Makes Her
[23:47] different I
[23:49] know you have to face all the time our
[23:52] eyes on
[23:54] Jesus to
[23:56] our
[23:58] die to
[23:59] ourselves and other time
[24:02] like for people to take
[24:05] inventory or rest restriction of their
[24:08] life people to take to like examine
[24:15] yourself since I decided to worship
[24:19] God and ask yourself since I decide to
[24:22] worship
[24:26] God is this the old
[24:30] me or there has been a
[24:35] transformation you
[24:37] know yesterday I was reading something
[24:39] from
[24:43] Chronicles he said there was this man
[24:45] called yeah second
[24:47] chronicles called
[24:52] Amia Amia I think that's second
[24:55] chronicles I
[24:56] forgotten
[24:59] and this
[25:00] Amia became a King when he was a child
[25:04] became a king
[25:06] yeah and he ruled for 29
[25:12] years and he did what was perfect in the
[25:16] eyes of the
[25:20] Lord oh another said he did what was
[25:24] right in the eyes of the
[25:26] Lord
[25:29] but not with a perfect
[25:31] heart and I was wondering how can a man
[25:34] do what is right in the sight of the
[25:40] Lord but without a perfect
[25:44] heart so it means you can walk in
[25:49] here each and every
[25:52] day thinking you are coming to worship
[25:56] God but your heart might not be
[25:59] right but if your heart is right your
[26:03] attitude is going to be
[26:05] right and for your heart to be
[26:08] righted you need to have Jesus in
[26:12] there Jesus is in your
[26:15] heart your thinking will be right and if
[26:19] you're thinking is
[26:20] right your attitude is going to be
[26:24] right and it's very
[26:26] dangerous
[26:28] and I was I was examining
[26:31] myself and I was
[26:34] looking because I'm scriptures are for
[26:36] you to examine
[26:38] yourself you might be doing the right
[26:40] thing you might be doing the right
[26:44] thing that is all right but that what is
[26:47] the motive behind you doing the right
[26:50] thing is it because you want to let
[26:52] people know you know how to do
[26:56] it you see how man often time want to
[26:59] please
[27:01] himself you know said one of the
[27:06] demons that was cut from The Prostitute
[27:09] woman Mary
[27:12] meline one of them was
[27:15] pride and how did say he say because she
[27:20] es herself better than
[27:24] others and how many how how many have we
[27:28] Este oursel better than
[27:32] others simple you see how simp sometime
[27:35] it can be what you see how simple how it
[27:38] can be
[27:40] how or how simple it can
[27:44] be just thinking to be better than
[27:50] somebody is
[27:53] sin and that the reason
[27:56] why examine
[27:59] ourself why am I doing this why am I
[28:02] doing
[28:03] this is it because I want to please the
[28:07] people or it's because God has told me
[28:10] to do
[28:12] it and you know if you try with your
[28:15] experience you are going to
[28:20] fail if you try with your your strength
[28:22] we are going to
[28:25] fail know could you imagine this
[28:28] Moses could you imagine this
[28:30] Moses training in the house of
[28:33] pharaoh but he knew who he
[28:37] was but he know that this
[28:41] Israelite are my
[28:43] brothers and says
[28:46] Moses saw a Phil saw an
[28:51] Egyptian beating a an
[28:54] Israelite and he went to save him
[28:58] but he killed the person in the process
[29:01] but he
[29:03] the you
[29:05] see when man triy to do it
[29:09] himself and what happened to Moses he
[29:12] ran
[29:13] away but when Moses met
[29:16] God and that's what
[29:19] said every
[29:21] Christian have to make
[29:23] sure he has made
[29:26] God side of the desert at the back side
[29:30] of the
[29:31] desert every
[29:33] Christian have to make sure he got the
[29:37] upper room
[29:40] experience The Upper Room
[29:50] experience when the apostles when the
[29:52] apostles were gathered on the day of
[29:54] Pentecost and the Holy Ghost came and
[29:56] filled the room
[30:03] and said every
[30:06] Christian is not in the
[30:08] pastor you know I've come to
[30:11] realize that most church
[30:13] members
[30:15] MERS think
[30:18] think the Bible is fing the pastor is
[30:23] what is fing the pastor following is is
[30:25] foring the pastor
[30:29] but the word of God is not for the
[30:32] pastor it's for
[30:36] you and so whenever the pastor is
[30:39] [Music]
[30:41] speaking he his
[30:43] work is to
[30:45] bring the word of God that is for
[30:49] you to
[30:53] you and you have to also see yourself
[30:56] that
[30:58] is God bringing me a
[31:02] message then if you see it like that it
[31:05] w be you just coming to
[31:07] church but whenever you come to church
[31:11] you know that God is going to speak to
[31:13] you and when God speaks to you it's just
[31:17] come to turn something around he's
[31:20] coming to turn something around to
[31:25] change and make you a better
[31:28] person said whenever you go to church
[31:33] there are two
[31:34] things you either go home a worse
[31:38] person or a better
[31:40] person but the choice depends on
[31:43] you whether you want to go home a better
[31:46] person whe whether you want to go home a
[31:49] better
[31:50] person or a worst
[31:52] person it all depends on you you said
[31:56] when Joshua
[31:58] after Joshua was
[32:00] old and he was about to die then he
[32:04] gathered the
[32:05] people and brought
[32:07] them and he said choose this
[32:10] day this day
[32:13] day who you will
[32:15] worship either the god of the
[32:19] Amorite or the god of the
[32:22] Egyptians or the god of the
[32:24] Philistines or the god of the most high
[32:28] but as for me and my
[32:30] household but as for me and my household
[32:33] we will serve the
[32:35] Lord and I want all
[32:38] husbands all family
[32:41] head to make that
[32:43] decision in their house and say as for
[32:47] me and my household we serve the Lord
[32:51] and that to be our
[32:52] desire that God have to be the king of
[32:55] our house
[32:58] God has be God has to be the ruler of my
[33:04] house and whatever we are
[33:07] doing you are going to do
[33:10] it because you have seen God directed
[33:13] us and it is our
[33:17] responsibility to stand for God know
[33:20] that
[33:22] time I read of the Danny
[33:25] Greenfield Dan Daniel Greenfield Daniel
[33:29] Greenfield how he was a great American
[33:32] evangelist and he preached the
