[4:39] speaking on this ministry of of of
[4:43] William brandham God sent a
[4:50] prophet and and God had told them
[4:53] through a vision that his ministry would
[4:55] have three parts to
[4:58] it
[5:00] and and in the vision these parts were
[5:02] called the first
[5:07] poll and the second
[5:10] pole and the third pole it would have
[5:13] three parts his
[5:16] ministry the first poll of his
[5:19] ministry began in
[5:24] 1946 God had given him a a gift to pray
[5:27] for the
[5:28] sick
[5:31] and and and the gift was Vindicated by a
[5:34] sign in his
[5:36] [Music]
[5:45] hand and and that that first pool
[5:50] Ministry lasted from
[5:54] 1946 to
[5:57] 1949 but but even when that Ministry
[6:02] began he was already in
[6:06] expectation of the second part of the
[6:10] ministry and in
[6:14] 1949 the ministry
[6:16] changed and he went from praying to the
[6:19] Sick by a sign in his
[6:26] hand from to Discerning the hearts of
[6:29] the
[6:32] people and and in 1949 it

[7:36] 1953 brother bam says this he says
[7:41] look the very
[7:43] night the very
[7:46] day that the angel of the Lord met
[7:50] me in
[7:53] 1946 on May the
[7:56] 7th
[7:58] May
[8:00] this at Greensville Indiana in
[8:03] Greensville Indiana that same
[8:06] day the the Treaty of Peace was signed
[8:09] for the Jews the
[8:16] what was
[8:18] signed for the Jews and they were an
[8:22] established
[8:25] Nation for the first time in 2500 years
[8:32] you you see God was bringing forth a
[8:35] [Music]
[8:38] restoration in the beginning of the 20th
[8:42] century not only for a gentile
[8:47] bride but but for a Jewish
[8:51] people not only for the bride
[8:55] tree but for the Fig Tree
[8:58] also
[9:00] they they were working at the same time
[9:04] together God bringing a great
[9:09] restoration what what what the prophet
[9:11] Joel had spoken
[9:14] of he said I shall restore sayth the
[9:19] Lord all all that the Locust has
[9:23] eaten all that the loc has
[9:28] eaten
[9:29] all that those four worms have
[9:35] eaten Amen in in Greensville Indiana in
[9:40] Greensville Indiana the angel of the
[9:42] Lord
[9:44] appeared and gave the prophet a
[9:48] commission in the message the pillar of
[9:53] fire
[9:56] 1953 he says now notice
[10:00] then then when a little bitty
[10:03] fella then the Holy Spirit spoke and
[10:07] said so he's saying when I when I was a
[10:10] little bitty
[10:12] fella then the Holy Spirit spoke and
[10:16] said don't never
[10:19] smoke chew or or
[10:23] drink defile your
[10:27] body in in any
[10:31] way there's a work for you to do when
[10:34] you get
[10:36] older and then many times down through
[10:41] life I try to tell people with the
[10:43] sincerity of my
[10:47] heart and they would misunderstand
[10:50] it they called it everything in the
[10:54] world well one night Yonder in Greens
[10:56] Mill
[10:58] Indiana in Greensville Indiana at a cave
[11:01] where I was
[11:03] at the angel of the Lord
[11:07] appeared he said you're to go pray for
[11:09] sick
[11:11] people and told me what would take
[11:15] place he said do not
[11:17] fear I'll be with you I took off and I
[11:23] came through the
[11:25] country and and down through
[11:27] Jonesboro
[11:30] telling what he
[11:33] said and what would come to
[11:36] pass and it's been that
[11:38] way and
[11:41] proved around the
[11:43] world and we Are Witnesses
[11:46] it my parents were in many of his
[11:49] meetings in those
[11:54] years in in these in these Services of
[11:57] praying for the sick
[12:00] and they said the blind the blind the
[12:02] blind
[12:17] sawu they said crippled
[12:22] [Music]
[12:24] walk and the lost were
[12:27] saved
[12:29] they were
[12:31] Witnesses and not only them but
[12:34] many in the message gifts and callings
[12:37] are without
[12:42] repentance uh preached the
[12:46] 1915 brother Bram says
[12:49] this now he says now of course a word
[12:52] for my
[12:57] people please no matter matter what sin
[12:59] you've
[13:02] done uh it'll be known here at the
[13:06] platform he said he said the first
[13:11] gift that's the first manifestation of
[13:14] the
[13:16] gift that I so that I could detect
[13:21] diseases as a
[13:24] doctor whatever it is to
[13:27] you would be the same
[13:30] thing see see but that gift doesn't heal
[13:34] you that was to encourage your
[13:38] faith to know that there's a
[13:40] supernatural being is standing
[13:46] here see then about three years later in
[13:51] Canada about five months
[13:54] ago the other gift came
[13:57] down
[14:00] and was
[14:01] manifested he says now I tell the
[14:05] secrets of the
[14:08] hearts the things that you
[14:11] do that that the things that you haven't
[14:16] confessed and so forth see it's perfect
[14:20] because it's of
[14:22] God it was the second call of his
[14:26] ministry in a in the message Christ is
[14:29] the mystery of God
[14:35] revealed says this not knowing of
[14:40] course but but but being
[14:44] spiritual we watch spiritual
[14:47] things and not knowing
[14:50] this but but God knows it he said but if
[14:54] you'll turn and look at the
[14:57] clock
[14:59] it's it's it's 2:00 on the
[15:02] dock this was
[15:06] 1963 July
[15:10] 28th and he says it's the end of the
[15:13] second
[15:15] pool he told us the day we know the
[15:19] month we even know the hour of the day
[15:23] when the ministry went from his second
[15:27] pool to his third
[15:29] poll the first and second
[15:33] poll was healing
[15:36] campaigns but the third
[15:39] pole was the opening of The Seven
[15:43] Seals it began in
[15:46] 1963 his third full
[15:50] ministry it wasn't to be healing
[15:53] anymore God wasn't majoring
[15:56] there he he still still a
[16:00] Healer I've felt his healing touch many
[16:06] times he's raised me out of what more
[16:08] than one hospital bed when I was
[16:14] dying but what God is focusing
[16:19] on is the revealed word of
[16:22] God With A Plan of
[16:25] Salvation that teaches us how to live
[16:29] and how to be sensitive
[16:33] spiritually to everything that's
[16:35] happening around
[16:37] us to judge it by the
[16:40] word and to be led by the
[16:44] spirit in the
[16:46] message the anointed ones at the end
[16:52] time
[16:55] 1965 it was July 25th
[17:00] brother randam says this notice the very
[17:04] day when this
[17:07] messenger not when he
[17:10] starts but when he begins to declare his
[17:14] message he says the first poll was
[17:19] healing part one of his
[17:21] ministry the second pole was
[17:26] prophesying earning the hearts of the
[17:31] [Music]
[17:33] people amen Discerning the hearts of the
[17:36] people he says the third
[17:39] poll is the opening of the
[17:45] word the Mysteries
[17:49] revealed there is no higher
[17:55] order than to reveal the word
[17:59] through
[18:00] prophets but the only way the prophet
[18:02] can be
[18:06] Vindicated is by the very word he
[18:12] brings and
[18:14] remember the third pole was the opening
[18:18] of them Seven
[18:22] Seals to reveal the hidden
[18:26] truth that's been sealed in the
[18:30] word says do you see
[18:35] it in the message why are people so
[18:39] tossed
[18:42] [Music]
[18:50] about brother bam says this he said I
[18:53] noticed to my
[18:57] left which was would Ben to my right I
[18:59] was on the
[19:03] platform he's he's sharing a
[19:07] portion of the vision of the 10th
[19:14] Vision because I noticed to my
[19:19] left which had been to my right if I was
[19:22] on the
[19:25] platform because in the vision in the
[19:28] vision he had been taken from the
[19:32] platform and now he was standing way in
[19:34] the back now of this of this great
[19:39] tent and he's looking towards the
[19:43] platform he says he says a little wooden
[19:53] building and I seen that
[19:56] light he say they have the picture of it
[19:59] you
[20:01] know he's talking about the picture of
[20:04] the pillar of
[20:06] fire he says it's it's always in the
[20:11] meeting I seen that light leave
[20:16] me and it went to that
[20:19] building that little wooden
[20:24] building and it went inside that
[20:27] building
[20:30] and a voice said to
[20:32] me I'll meet you in
[20:36] there that will be the third
[20:39] pole so if God was going to meet him
[20:43] there in that little wooden
[20:47] building and that would be the third
[20:51] pool then we want to know what the third
[20:53] pool
[20:56] is and he just told us
[20:59] the third pole was the revealing of them
[21:09] seals so in the tent
[21:15] Vision God told him he would meet him in
[21:17] that little
[21:20] room he told him that would be the third
[21:24] poem when he was preaching the Seven
[21:26] Seals and in in in Jeffersonville
[21:32] Indiana he says and there I
[21:35] was in that little
[21:37] room and if it wouldn't have been about
[21:41] 12:00
[21:46] today that the Holy Spirit came
[21:49] down and be and began telling me what to
[21:54] write I would have got it all
[21:57] wrong
[21:59] so maybe the symbols of this little
[22:03] room was that little room where he was
[22:06] studying
[22:08] in and the angel made met him every
[22:13] night to bring forth the revelation of
[22:16] these Seven
[22:23] Seals the third
[22:25] pool was the opening of them seven SE
[22:31] to reveal the hidden
[22:34] truth to reveal the hidden
[22:39] truth that's been sealed in the
[22:43] word in the message the anointed
[22:46] [Music]
[22:48] ones in that end
[22:51] time brother Bram says
[22:54] this he says Revelations

[26:40] it this T
[26:47] Vision people

[27:04] word that will transform and change
[27:09] you give you the
[27:12] character of a true
[27:16] Christian to learn how to turn from
[27:21] sin to teach you how to be a better
[27:26] father a better
[27:28] mother better children in the
[27:32] home to teach a pastor how to hold the
[27:34] standard of Holiness in the house of
[27:44] God God is wanting to bring a
[27:49] people to be like
[27:53] Jesus how teach us how to stand on the
[27:56] word
[28:00] I know
[28:01] people I know I know
[28:04] people who have had great miracles in
[28:06] their
[28:09] lives a sister a
[28:12] friend who who had a prayer
[28:16] card who who who was in one of the
[28:18] meetings of brother
[28:21] brandham and they called her
[28:24] number and she came forth
[28:28] and she gave them the prayer
[28:30] card and and she walked the line all the
[28:33] way around to the right hand side of the
[28:39] Prophet they told her she had had had
[28:43] cancer and there's nothing more she they
[28:45] could do for
[28:47] her and she had only days maybe months
[28:50] to
[28:53] live and the growth was on her neck
[28:56] already coming out
[28:57] out and the growth in
[29:02] cancer and the prophet took her by hand
[29:05] and prayed for
[29:09] her and the growth fell
[29:12] off and she was completely
[29:15] healed and you know what
[29:18] else she turned her back on the word and
[29:21] went out to the
[29:26] world
[29:30] amen but what if she would have been in
[29:33] a meeting where the baptism of the Holy
[29:35] Ghost got a hold of her
[29:40] heart she'd be serving the lord Jesus
[29:43] yet
[29:46] today you think she's the only one
[29:49] that's been
[29:51] healed and then turn their back on the
[29:55] word no there are
[29:58] many there are
[30:05] many at 68 I'm not an old man but I'm
[30:08] old enough to tell you I've seen these
[30:16] things but I've never seen
[30:21] once someone receive a genuine
[30:24] experience with God and be born again
[30:36] and ever turn
[30:38] back on the Lord Jesus
[30:41] Christ but those who have been
[30:43] miraculous
[30:47] healed I've seen them with his eyes turn
[30:52] their back on the Lord
[30:56] Jesus
[30:59] God wants to take you to a place in your
[31:01] Christian
[31:11] walk to a place where you'll where
[31:13] you'll be so convinced you'll be willing
[31:15] to die for the Lord
[31:23] Jesus God rich in Mercy
[31:28] so the angel told the
[31:31] prophet he says to my
[31:35] right was a little wooden
[31:39] building it was the tent
[31:43] Vision I seen the
[31:46] light you've seen the picture of
[31:49] it it's always in the
[31:53] meeting he said I seen the light leave
[31:56] me
[31:59] no I seen the light I've seen the light
[32:02] leave
[32:04] me and it went to that little
[32:08] building there's some details here he
[32:10] doesn't
[32:12] say he says in other
[32:15] messages and he said before he went in
[32:18] he says a woman walked in who was
[32:23] sick by herself no one went in with her
[32:28] and she came out completely
[32:30] healed she said I I she said I seen a
[32:33] man go
[32:34] in who was
[32:36] sick and he came out completely healed
[32:40] no one was in there with
[32:42] him no other man was in there with him
[32:45] the pillar of fire was meeting people in
[32:48] that little
[32:49] room and the angel tells
[32:53] him a voice said to
[32:55] me I'll meet you in
[32:58] there that will be the third
[33:01] poll that won't be the first
[33:04] pole that won't be my second pole
[33:08] Ministry this is going to be my third
[33:10] pole
[33:13] Ministry the revealing of the
[33:19] word so William brandham had three poles
[33:22] in his
[33:24] [Music]
[33:25] ministry because Jesus did
[33:29] too in the Book of
[33:32] Matthew Jesus begins his
[33:36] ministry in Matthew chapter
[33:39] 4 you've read it but go back and read it
[33:44] again in the beginning of his
[33:47] ministry he was an an
[33:51] evangelist having great campaign healing
[33:55] services
[33:57] to where where thousands and thousands
[34:01] came you read the
[34:05] gospels that was the
[34:07] beginning of the first poll of William
[34:09] Brandon of of Ministry of Jesus
[34:14] Christ then then his ministry went up
[34:17] another
[34:21] level and it began Discerning the hearts
[34:23] of the
[34:25] people that was the second
[34:29] pole of the ministry of Jesus
[34:32] Christ then he entered his third
[34:35] pole where he wasn't praying for the
[34:38] sick like he used
[34:41] to instead he told
[34:45] them if you don't eat my
[34:49] flesh if you don't eat my
[34:51] flesh and drink my
[34:53] blood you have no part with me
[34:57] it was the third full ministry of Jesus
[35:02] Christ the son of
[35:04] man at the first
[35:07] coming it was setting a
[35:10] [Music]
[35:14] pattern for the second
[35:17] coming where where God once
[35:21] again would do the same thing all over
[35:25] again why does he do things the same
[35:28] way because he's God Paul said in
[35:33] Hebrews 13
[35:35] and8 Jesus
[35:38] Christ is the same
[35:41] yesterday today and forever he
[35:44] unchanging in all his
[35:50] ways he's unchanging in all his
[35:54] ways he does it that way
[35:57] so he can hide himself from the wise and
[36:01] [Music]
[36:04] prudent and reveal it unto
[36:08] babes such as would
[36:11] learn not babes
[36:15] natural but
[36:17] Supernatural men and
[36:19] women who have really been born
[36:23] again and it began their Christian walk
[36:28] justified by
[36:30] faith Sanctified by the
[36:33] spirit baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[36:38] Fire then then that really begins your
[36:44] journey now you're a
[36:46] son a daughter going through a process
[36:49] that the Apostle Paul called a son and
[36:52] daughter being
[36:55] adopted
[37:01] God rich in
[37:04] Mercy we'd like to read for you out of
[37:10] uh Revelations 8 and verse
[37:16] one a scripture very well known to
[37:19] should be known to all of
[37:24] us Revelations 8 and verse
[37:31] Oney and when he had opened the seven
[37:34] seal there was silence in heaven about
[37:37] the space of half an
[37:45] hour
[37:47] Revelations 8 and verse
[37:55] 1
[38:04] amen and when he had opened the seven
[38:07] seal there was silence in heaven about
[38:11] the space of half an
[38:21] hour Revelations chapter
[38:25] 8
[38:30] it doesn't tell us here in the
[38:33] scripture who opened
[38:36] it it just says he opened
[38:39] it we can assume who he
[38:43] is or we can go back into the
[38:47] scripture and let the Bible tell
[38:50] us so this is Revelations
[38:54] 81 John was seeing seen these
[38:58] visions and as he as he would see them
[39:01] apart he would he would write them
[39:05] down so to know who is talking about
[39:08] when it says he had opened the seventh
[39:15] seal and when I read scriptures like
[39:17] this I want to know who is
[39:22] he the simplest way to do it
[39:27] is turn back a
[39:29] page to chapter
[39:33] 7 and see what was said at the last part
[39:36] of chapter
[39:40] 7 we'll begin reading in chapter 7
[39:43] verse1
[39:47] 15 Bible readers you're familiar with
[39:50] chapter
[39:53] S A Mighty Angel a mighty
[39:59] Angel he's holding back the wrath of
[40:01] seven of Four
[40:08] Angels and then it goes on to speak of
[40:12] of Israel in
[40:18] 144,000 the the chosen of
[40:21] God then he goes on to speak of a people
[40:24] who are of every Kindred tongue and
[40:30] Nation representing a gentile
[40:34] people then we come to verse
[40:38] 15 it says therefore are they Before the
[40:42] Throne of God and serve him day and
[40:44] night in his Temple and he that sth at
[40:46] the throne shall dwell among
[40:55] them
[40:58] he said they shall hunger no more
[41:00] neither thirst
[41:02] anymore verse
[41:05] 16 neither shall the sun light on them
[41:08] nor any
[41:11] heat then verse
[41:14] 17 for the lamb which is in the midst of
[41:17] the throne shall feed them and shall
[41:19] lead them unto living Fountains of
[41:21] waters and God shall wipe away all tears
[41:24] from their eyes for
[41:35] then the very next thing that John
[41:39] says and when he had opened the seven
[41:44] seal so who opened it he just told us in
[41:48] in the last verse of chapter
[41:53] S the
[41:54] lamb that's the way this Bible is
[41:59] written the books and the chapters are
[42:01] not independent of each
[42:06] other no no they all come
[42:09] together that's why a prophet told
[42:12] us never take one
[42:17] quote never take one
[42:21] quote and put a period on
[42:24] it no don't never take one scripture and
[42:28] put a period on
[42:31] it no always put a
[42:34] comma because all the Bible comes
[42:38] together and when scripture comes
[42:40] together with
[42:43] scripture then it adds more
[42:47] detail and more
[42:49] detail and more
[42:51] details then that's God bringing
[42:54] Revelation to our hearts
[42:59] Revelations
[43:02] 81 now we can read it
[43:06] differently and when the lamb had opened
[43:08] the seven
[43:13] seal and when the
[43:17] lamb and when the lamb had open the
[43:20] seventh
[43:22] seal there was silence in heaven about
[43:26] the space of half an
[43:29] hour you see what happens when you put
[43:32] bring scripture
[43:35] together it starts revealing the plan of
[43:40] God it starts telling you who is opening
[43:43] this
[43:45] word it was the
[43:48] lamb and when the lamb had opened the
[43:51] seventh
[43:53] seal there was silence in heaven
[43:57] about the space of a half
[43:59] hour turn turn with me to Revelations 10
[44:02] 1
[44:10] to3 Revelations
[44:14] 10y verse 1
[44:19] to3 and I saw verse one and I saw
[44:22] another Mighty Angel come down from
[44:24] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[44:27] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[44:29] was it were the Sun and his feet as
[44:31] pillars of
[44:34] [Music]
[44:41] fire and he had in his hand a little
[44:44] book open and he set his right foot upon
[44:47] the sea and his left foot upon the
[44:54] Earth and cried with a loud voice as
[44:57] when a lion Roth and when he had cried
[45:00] seven Thunders uttered their
[45:02] [Music]
[45:10] voices just a minute
[45:24] here
[45:38] Revelations 10
[45:39] 1-3
[45:43] apyp it was the time of the revealing of
[45:46] the
[45:48] word it was the time of this third
[45:53] pool and the message Christ is is the
[45:56] mystery of God
[45:59] [Music]
[46:01] revealed Christ
[46:06] is preached in
[46:10] 1963 and he declares where his ministry
[46:13] is at we just read it I want to read it
[46:18] again he said he says of course being
[46:24] spiritual you watch spirit
[46:27] things he said not knowing
[46:30] this God Knows It But if you'll turn and
[46:34] look at the
[46:35] clock it's on the dot 2
[46:39] o00 so while he's sharing
[46:44] this God is speaking to his
[46:48] heart and telling him look at the
[46:52] clock it's 2 o00 right on the DOT
[46:58] and the prophets thinking okay Lord but
[47:00] what does that
[47:02] mean and then and the and the Lord
[47:05] speaks to him and says it's the end of
[47:06] your second
[47:11] poll the third pole is at
[47:15] hand the healing
[47:20] campaigns under the first and second
[47:24] Pole
[47:26] he says your ministry is changing
[47:29] now now it's the revealing of the
[47:33] word all of that healing
[47:37] campaigns were to catch the
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] attention of a little
[47:46] bride a bride that was in
[47:51] denominations a bride bride members that
[47:53] were in the world in the in
[48:00] lost that's what these healing campaigns
[48:03] were
[48:04] for to catch the attention of his
[48:09] children a predestinated group of
[48:14] people in the message the anointed ones
[48:17] at the end
[48:21] time I'm going to read this
[48:23] again he says notice
[48:26] the very
[48:29] day when when this
[48:32] messenger uh not when he
[48:35] starts but when he begins to declare his
[48:40] message she said the first poll was the
[48:43] healing
[48:46] campaign the second poll was the
[48:48] discernment
[48:52] prophesying he said but the third pole
[48:55] it's it's the opening of the
[48:58] word it's the Mysteries
[49:01] revealed he says there's no higher order
[49:04] than to reveal the word through
[49:10] prophets but the only way the prophet
[49:12] can be
[49:16] Vindicated is by the word he says and
[49:20] remember this is 19 this is
[49:24] 1965 and he wants us to remember
[49:28] something from what the angel told
[49:31] him back in the
[49:34] 1950s he's bringing it to our
[49:37] remembrance this part of the
[49:41] vision he said Remember the third pool
[49:44] was the opening of them Seven
[49:47] [Music]
[49:49] Seals to reveal the hidden
[49:53] truth that's been sealed in the word
[49:57] he said do you see
[50:02] it in the same
[50:04] message what is the attraction on the
[50:11] mountain he says what what happened upon
[50:15] Mount
[50:17] Sunset I don't know if any of you have
[50:20] ever been
[50:22] there to Sunset mountain in Sunset
[50:26] it's there in the state of
[50:30] Arizona it's close to a small little
[50:32] town called
[50:35] Wilcox it's back into the dirt roads
[50:38] into into the ranches back in
[50:43] there it takes it takes a few hours to
[50:46] get back inside in
[50:50] there and there's a little mount in that
[50:53] area in that region called Mount sunset
[51:02] the prophet says what what happened upon
[51:04] Mount about upon Mount
[51:09] Sunset he said God confirming his
[51:13] word he say that's what all this noise
[51:16] is
[51:18] about it's God fulfilling his promised
[51:21] word
[51:24] again
[51:31] which
[51:32] promises then he tells us the promise of
[51:36] Revelations 10
[51:40] 1-7 that's what the those were the
[51:43] promises that were coming to pass on
[51:44] Mount
[51:48] Sunset and then he says and in the days
[51:52] of the sounding of the seventh Angel's
[51:54] message
[51:57] in the
[52:04] days the mystery of God should be
[52:09] finished the hidden
[52:13] Mystery of Revelations 10
[52:17] 1-7 the last message to the last Church
[52:22] age it's fulfilled exactly
[52:28] in this
[52:29] age he says L Luke St Luke
[52:35] 1730 he says the day when the son of man
[52:38] shall be
[52:40] [Music]
[52:44] revealed he says and there shall rise
[52:47] false prophets and false
[52:53] Christ there and there shall r
[52:55] false prophets and false
[53:02] Christ and show great signs and
[53:08] wonders in so much that deceive the
[53:10] elected
[53:15] possible he saids the people the people
[53:18] still in
[53:22] doubt and as usual
[53:26] the church is just as
[53:31] confused in the message the Feast of the
[53:37] trumpets brother Bram says
[53:40] this he says look I want to say one more
[53:45] thing closely now don't miss
[53:50] this how how
[53:54] striking
[53:56] how
[53:57] stri from the seventh
[54:00] Angels messenger of the seventh
[54:04] seal from the seventh angel
[54:08] the messenger of the seven
[54:15] seal message in Revelations
[54:21] 10 Revelations 10 was the seventh seal
[54:30] let me say that again Revelations 10 was
[54:34] the seventh
[54:36] seal you see I'm going to I'm going to
[54:40] believe and
[54:43] assume that that that all of you like
[54:47] me we thought that the only thing
[54:49] written about the seventh
[54:53] seal was Revelations
[54:57] 81 and when he had opened the seventh
[55:02] seal there was silence in
[55:05] heaven for the space of a half
[55:09] hour but Revelation
[55:13] 10 is 11
[55:17] verses the prophet just
[55:20] added 11
[55:23] verses of more detail
[55:26] of what the seventh seal
[55:28] [Music]
[55:30] is so if you read Revelations
[55:34] 10 1 to
[55:36] 11 you're reading
[55:39] prophecy that is that that was that was
[55:42] supposed to come to pass at the opening
[55:44] of the seventh
[55:49] seal did you catch that when the seventh
[55:53] he says verse Revelations
[55:57] 81 and when he the Lamb of
[56:02] God had opened the seventh
[56:04] seal there was silence in
[56:07] heaven for the space of a half
[56:11] hour and then brother Bram tells
[56:14] us in the message Feast of the
[56:19] trumpets he tells us Revelations
[56:23] 10 was the seventh
[56:27] seal so he just added 11 more verses of
[56:34] detail to what the seventh seal
[56:38] is and what are the things that are
[56:40] going to happen when that seal is
[56:48] open so what does Revelations 10 tell
[56:53] us there was a mighty
[56:57] angel with a book in his
[57:01] hand that book was
[57:03] what was it
[57:06] open or was it
[57:08] closed someone say
[57:12] it
[57:14] open Revelations
[57:17] 101 that
[57:19] angel that Covenant
[57:23] angel
[57:25] that Covenant
[57:28] Angel stood with one foot on the
[57:32] land and one foot on the
[57:36] sea and the book was
[57:39] open the word being
[57:42] revealed through the mouth of a
[57:45] prophet so the seventh seal
[57:49] now there's more written in the
[57:53] Bible than just one verse
[57:55] verse it now becomes the seal with the
[57:58] most detail of all the
[58:03] seals it it now becomes the
[58:08] seal with more
[58:10] detail than all the other six
[58:14] seals a
[58:16] prophet just added 11 more
[58:20] verses of
[58:22] detail to what the seven SE
[58:27] is he
[58:29] said Revelations
[58:32] 10 in the message the Feast of the
[58:36] trumpets was the seventh
[58:39] seal so what's happening under the
[58:41] seventh
[58:43] seal an angel
[58:46] descends on Sunset
[58:50] Mountain what happens under the seventh
[58:53] seal God sends the seventh
[58:58] angel to to sound and bring forth the
[59:04] revelation of how we can live Victorious
[59:07] Christian
[59:10] lives God God can heal you of some
[59:15] sickness but that doesn't make you a
[59:17] better
[59:19] Christian no you must be born again to
[59:22] be a better
[59:23] Christian
[59:25] you must receive the baptism of the Holy
[59:27] Ghost with fire to be a better
[59:33] Christian you must live by faith to be a
[59:36] better
[59:40] believer you must be you must believe
[59:42] that God told you to live a life of
[59:44] Holiness to be a better
[59:50] Christian and all that revealed under
[59:53] the seventh seal
[1:00:00] yes in
[1:00:05] 1963
[1:00:06] it there was an article that was put
[1:00:11] out by the University of
[1:00:15] Arizona I remember one
[1:00:19] morning in
[1:00:22] 1963 a brother knocked on our door
[1:00:26] his name was brother Daniel
[1:00:31] Ramirez and he and he was a good friend
[1:00:34] of my mom and
[1:00:36] dad and he's knocking on the door
[1:00:39] knocking they answer the
[1:00:42] door and he says brother Angel do you
[1:00:45] know what just
[1:00:48] happened he says no he says no he says
[1:00:52] God came down angels have come down
[1:00:56] he says where he says on Sunset
[1:01:00] Mountain it's just 3 hours away from
[1:01:04] here he says how do you know this he
[1:01:07] says look at the
[1:01:09] picture and he had with
[1:01:11] him a little
[1:01:15] booklet he says and it was from the
[1:01:17] University of
[1:01:21] Arizona and there was a scientist a man
[1:01:24] called called James
[1:01:27] McDonald James mcdonaldd and he had
[1:01:30] written up a small
[1:01:33] article on this
[1:01:36] cloud and the article said
[1:01:39] this he says an
[1:01:43] unusual an
[1:01:45] unusual an unusual ring shaped
[1:01:52] cloud was was was observed Obed over
[1:01:55] Northern
[1:01:58] Arizona about
[1:02:02] sunset on the 28th of
[1:02:06] February
[1:02:08] 1963 he says and and was seen by a large
[1:02:12] number of
[1:02:15] people that reported
[1:02:18] it it's known to have appeared over near
[1:02:21] Flagstaff
[1:02:23] Arizona
[1:02:25] he said and from and and from the
[1:02:27] pictures that were that were taken in
[1:02:32] Tucson about 190 miles south of the
[1:02:40] cloud about 190 miles south of the
[1:02:46] cloud he says the altitude was
[1:02:48] approximately 35
[1:02:53] kilomet he says the most the the
[1:02:56] furthest
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:02:58] observation must was reported about 280
[1:03:03] miles from the
[1:03:08] cloud and then he says the
[1:03:13] cloud
[1:03:16] remained Sun
[1:03:19] illuminum for 28 minutes after local
[1:03:23] sunset for
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:27] you know when when John saw this
[1:03:32] cloud in the in the Book of
[1:03:37] Revelations he didn't he didn't know how
[1:03:39] to count minutes and hours like we do
[1:03:45] today that's why when he saw
[1:03:48] it he said and when the
[1:03:51] lamb opened the seventh
[1:03:55] seal there was silence in
[1:03:58] heaven for the space of a half
[1:04:02] hour that was the
[1:04:04] prophecy but when it actually happened
[1:04:07] in reality in
[1:04:10] Arizona when the seven seal
[1:04:14] open now we have more
[1:04:20] detail
[1:04:23] science
[1:04:25] do you see
[1:04:27] it unrecorded of
[1:04:31] science but recorded in God's holy
[1:04:36] word in the book of
[1:04:39] Acts chapter
[1:04:41] 1 we're going to read from verse 7 to
[1:04:44] verse
[1:04:47] 11 Al
[1:04:50] mhm acts 1: 7 to1
[1:04:58] and verse S reads like
[1:05:01] this and he said unto them it is not for
[1:05:04] you to know the times or the seasons
[1:05:07] which the father had put in his own
[1:05:17] power but ye shall receive power after
[1:05:21] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:05:27] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both
[1:05:30] in Jerusalem and all Juda and Samaria
[1:05:33] unto the uttermost parts of the
[1:05:40] earth and when he had spoken these
[1:05:42] things they
[1:05:46] beheld he was taken
[1:05:48] up and a cloud received them out of
[1:05:51] their
[1:05:53] sight
[1:05:55] this is the Lord
[1:05:57] Jesus he ascended on
[1:06:02] high and while they
[1:06:04] looked as he went up behold two men
[1:06:07] stood by him in white
[1:06:09] apparel verse
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:18] 10 which also
[1:06:21] said ye men of Galilee why stand ye
[1:06:24] gazing up unto Heaven this same Jesus
[1:06:28] which is taken up from you into heaven
[1:06:30] shall so come in like manner as you have
[1:06:33] seen him go into
[1:06:47] heaven here in the book of
[1:06:51] Acts this was the first time
[1:06:55] that this Cloud had
[1:06:57] descended and men had
[1:07:00] seen this wasn't just a
[1:07:04] cloud this was the same seven
[1:07:07] angels that we seen today in this 20th
[1:07:10] century in our
[1:07:14] day this is the picture that Life
[1:07:16] Magazine
[1:07:20] took this was not just the cloud that
[1:07:23] received Lord
[1:07:27] Jesus this was seven
[1:07:29] angels and the pattern in our
[1:07:34] day why because it's Hebrews 13
[1:07:39] and8 he's the same yesterday today and
[1:07:45] forever and the pattern of his first
[1:07:49] coming Jesus having three poles in his
[1:07:52] ministry
[1:07:58] now Jesus is taken up and a cloud
[1:08:01] receives
[1:08:03] him and these two
[1:08:06] angels they tell the
[1:08:09] disciples you see the way you
[1:08:14] go so shall he return again in the same
[1:08:19] way we know how he's
[1:08:22] returned
[1:08:24] seven angels on Sunset
[1:08:27] Mountain bringing a message of the third
[1:08:30] pole to a
[1:08:33] prophet and because we know what the
[1:08:35] cloud was in our
[1:08:39] day science took the
[1:08:42] picture not
[1:08:44] us and in that
[1:08:47] picture if you've ever seen
[1:08:49] it of Life
[1:08:51] magazine you can see the angel
[1:08:55] you can see the
[1:08:58] Angels when they first gave the magazine
[1:09:01] to brother
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:04] brandham he never had seen
[1:09:07] it until about six or seven
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:12] months
[1:09:14] after even preached the
[1:09:17] seals and a brother
[1:09:21] M brought him the Life
[1:09:25] magazine and brother brandom looks at
[1:09:29] it he goes
[1:09:31] wow because though he had been caught up
[1:09:34] in that
[1:09:38] constellation he'd been caught
[1:09:41] up but he had never seen it in a picture
[1:09:47] and when he saw
[1:09:49] it he's looking at it and the holy tells
[1:09:53] him
[1:09:55] turn it to the
[1:09:58] right anybody here have the
[1:10:02] magazine I have it maybe next time I
[1:10:05] come I'll bring
[1:10:06] it so that you can do just what the Holy
[1:10:09] Spirit told the prophet to
[1:10:13] do what the Holy
[1:10:15] Spirit told the prophet to do so you can
[1:10:19] hold the magazine in your
[1:10:21] hand and turn it to the right
[1:10:25] I'm sure you've all seen the
[1:10:28] picture he said turn it to the right and
[1:10:31] when you turn it to the right you see
[1:10:34] the face of
[1:10:41] Christ that cloud that you see
[1:10:44] there is the same
[1:10:47] Cloud that caught up
[1:10:51] Jesus more than 2000 th000 years
[1:10:56] ago it was seven angels in our
[1:11:00] day and it was seven angels back
[1:11:04] then because Jesus
[1:11:06] Christ is the same

[1:12:15] Isaiah one
[1:12:18] quote or one
[1:12:20] scripture and preach a Doctrine on it
[1:12:25] because it'll be wrong every

[1:13:10] together scure matching with
[1:13:15] scripture Revelations
[1:13:19] 10 1 and
[1:13:21] two read we'll read it again and I saw
[1:13:24] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:13:26] heaven clothed with a
[1:13:29] cloud apyp
[1:13:33] one Revelations
[1:13:38] 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:13:42] down from heaven how was he clothed with
[1:13:45] a cloud
[1:13:49] be in the book of
[1:13:52] Acts Jesus was caught
[1:13:56] up in a
[1:13:58] cloud but it wasn't just a
[1:14:01] cloud it was seven
[1:14:03] angels that was his first
[1:14:07] coming and the angels told told the
[1:14:10] disciples
[1:14:12] there just the way that you've seen him
[1:14:17] go you'll see him come back
[1:14:20] again and he didn't just say that for
[1:14:22] the discip
[1:14:24] IPL not for the disciples in that
[1:14:28] day but that was written in the
[1:14:32] Bible for the Disciples of this
[1:14:35] day that was written for you this
[1:14:39] morning so you could have a
[1:14:41] revelation so you could so you could
[1:14:45] recognize your day in its
[1:14:47] message so that you could
[1:14:50] realize that you can have a real B again

[1:14:58] word not by a
[1:15:01] sensation and I Mighty Angel come down
[1:15:05] from heaven clothed with a
[1:15:10] cloud so this isn't the first
[1:15:13] coming this is not the first
[1:15:17] coming this must be his second
[1:15:20] coming because this isn't the first time
[1:15:24] a cloud appears in the with
[1:15:28] Jesus this is not the first
[1:15:31] time this is the second
[1:15:34] time the first time was in the book of

[1:19:12] is
[1:19:13] about I shall restore sayith the
[1:19:18] Lord all that those four worms had eaten
[1:19:21] down all that those four
[1:19:27] worms I shall restore he
[1:19:30] said when is the time of that
[1:19:34] restoration we are living in the
[1:19:37] day that God wants to restore
[1:19:44] Us in the message modern events made
[1:19:47] clear by
[1:19:51] prophecy
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:55] brother says
[1:19:57] this the year
[1:20:01] 1965 he says these modern events is
[1:20:04] slipping by us
[1:20:10] quickly and one day we're going to find
[1:20:14] out we we'll be left behind without
[1:20:19] nothing and be caught sealed into the
[1:20:22] mark the Beast before we know
[1:20:26] it he now with patience we have to wait
[1:20:30] for the prophecies that's
[1:20:35] promised every one of them must be
[1:20:37] fulfilled in its
[1:20:43] age he says the author has done this
[1:20:48] before can we wait for him to see to see
[1:20:51] him do it again
[1:20:54] oh what a time it is that we're living
[1:20:58] in something like a
[1:21:01] calendar you look at the
[1:21:03] calendar to find out what day of the
[1:21:06] year you're living
[1:21:09] in you look at God's
[1:21:12] Bible to see what age we're living
[1:21:16] in we're not living in the Methodist
[1:21:20] age we're not living in the Baptist age
[1:21:24] the year's
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:29] 1965 it's December the
[1:21:34] 6 and the prophet will be going off the
[1:21:37] scene in about another 15
[1:21:46] days and he says we're now living in the
[1:21:50] bright
[1:21:51] age
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:57] the calling
[1:22:00] time where God is bringing us back
[1:22:03] through a
[1:22:06] channel that he promised to bring us
[1:22:09] back
[1:22:11] through he promised to do
[1:22:14] it the channel he was talking
[1:22:17] about was the channel of Malachi
[1:22:21] 4
[1:22:23] the Elijah
[1:22:25] Ministry the seventh
[1:22:27] angel he would use this
[1:22:30] ministry to bring us back into his
[1:22:35] presence so what is he saying
[1:22:38] now telling us that Revelations
[1:22:42] 10 is the bride
[1:22:45] age he's telling us that Revelations
[1:22:49] 10 is the seventh seal
[1:22:59] in the message the
[1:23:03] breach he says now it's wrote
[1:23:09] mysterious because no man nowhere knows
[1:23:14] it God
[1:23:16] Alone Jesus
[1:23:18] Christ it's a book it's it's a
[1:23:20] mysterious book
[1:23:23] it's a book of
[1:23:25] redemption and now we know that the book
[1:23:27] of
[1:23:29] redemption will be thoroughly
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:34] understood he says it's it's probed that
[1:23:38] what
[1:23:41] inv through six Church
[1:23:46] ages but at the end when the seventh
[1:23:49] angel begins to
[1:23:51] sound
[1:23:56] sound sound his
[1:23:59] mystery he winds up all the Loose
[1:24:07] Ends that these other fellas probe
[1:24:14] that and the Mysteries comes down from
[1:24:18] God as the as the word of God and
[1:24:21] reveals the entire revelation of
[1:24:27] God then the then the
[1:24:34] godhead the godhead the godhead and
[1:24:37] everything else is
[1:24:41] settled to all the
[1:24:44] Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more
[1:24:47] is to be
[1:24:49] revealed he said now you see I'm not
[1:24:51] just making making that
[1:24:54] up it's thus sayth the
[1:24:57] Lord I'll read it to you out of the
[1:25:00] book The sounding of the seventh Angels
[1:25:04] message the mystery of God should be
[1:25:10] finished that's been declared by his
[1:25:13] holy
[1:25:15] prophets that's what the prophets who
[1:25:18] who has wrote the
[1:25:21] word
[1:25:23] they said at the
[1:25:25] sounding the of the seventh Church
[1:25:31] age the last Church
[1:25:34] age all the Loose
[1:25:39] Ends all the Loose Ends that through
[1:25:41] these Church ages has been probed
[1:25:48] that has been proved that will be wound
[1:25:51] up
[1:25:55] together and when the seals are
[1:25:58] broke and the Mysteries
[1:26:01] revealed down comes the angel the
[1:26:03] messenger
[1:26:06] Christ setting his foot upon the land
[1:26:09] and upon the
[1:26:11] sea with a rainbow over his
[1:26:14] head now
[1:26:16] remember this seventh
[1:26:19] angel is on the earth at the time of
[1:26:21] this
[1:26:25] coming where does it speak to us of the
[1:26:28] seventh
[1:26:31] angel Revelations
[1:26:34] 10:7 and where does it speak of that
[1:26:36] angel who descended with the
[1:26:39] cloud Revelations
[1:26:43] 101 so so Revelations
[1:26:47] 10 is the coming of the
[1:26:50] Lord what is revelation
[1:26:53] 10 of what a prophet has told
[1:26:56] us Revelations 10 that
[1:27:00] chapter it's the seventh
[1:27:02] seal Revelations
[1:27:05] 10 it's the bride
[1:27:09] age Revelations
[1:27:11] 10 Prophet said it's his
[1:27:17] coming Revelations
[1:27:20] 10 a prophet told
[1:27:22] us is when the Seven Seals of
[1:27:27] God were
[1:27:29] opened there on Sunset
[1:27:33] Mountain Revelations 10 is all these
[1:27:37] things he said Revelations
[1:27:40] 10 it's a third
[1:27:49] poll in the first seal
[1:27:52] brother preached
[1:27:56] 1963 you've got to go back and hear them
[1:28:01] all let him that ha an ear to
[1:28:06] hear hear what the
[1:28:08] spirit is speaking unto the
[1:28:12] church you're in the church this morning
[1:28:15] that God wants to speak
[1:28:18] to that God wants to speak
[1:28:21] to
[1:28:24] you are the
[1:28:27] church you are the one he died for on
[1:28:32] Calvary you are the one he shed his
[1:28:35] blood
[1:28:38] for you are the one he rose for on the
[1:28:41] third
[1:28:43] day so you should be the one searching
[1:28:47] the
[1:28:49] scriptures the Gospel of John
[1:28:54] he said search the
[1:28:58] scriptures if in them you think it has
[1:29:00] eternal life for
[1:29:05] you Jesus said blessed are those who
[1:29:09] hunger and thirst for
[1:29:16] righteousness for they shall be
[1:29:19] filled with the revelation
[1:29:26] of these Seven
[1:29:28] Seals the message the first
[1:29:31] seal brother bam says this but in the
[1:29:35] last
[1:29:36] days in this last
[1:29:39] age the messenger is not to start any
[1:29:46] Reformation but is to take all the
[1:29:50] Mysteries that those reformers left
[1:29:55] off and gather them
[1:29:58] together and solve them to the
[1:30:02] people let me just read it
[1:30:06] again he says he says and I saw another
[1:30:09] Mighty Angel come down from
[1:30:14] heaven clothed with a
[1:30:17] cloud a rainbow upon his
[1:30:20] head
[1:30:22] his face was as the
[1:30:25] sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:30:29] fire now we saw the same
[1:30:33] thing now we saw the same
[1:30:37] thing which was Christ he's talking
[1:30:41] about the
[1:30:43] cloud and we know Christ is always the
[1:30:46] messenger to the
[1:30:49] church he's called the pillar of Fire
[1:30:53] he's the angel of the
[1:30:55] Covenant and he had in his hand a little
[1:30:58] book
[1:31:01] open then he says now the
[1:31:04] seals have done been
[1:31:09] broke he says we're breaking them
[1:31:13] now he's preaching the first
[1:31:17] seal he says the seals have done been
[1:31:20] broke
[1:31:22] in other words they've been opening
[1:31:24] Through the
[1:31:28] Ages and the first seal opened in the
[1:31:30] days of
[1:31:33] Jesus the first seal opened in the days
[1:31:36] of the first Elijah John the
[1:31:41] Baptist and the last
[1:31:43] seal was open in the Days of
[1:31:47] Elijah William brandham William you see
[1:31:50] it's a pattern in God's
[1:31:53] word God's unchanging in all his
[1:31:58] ways so that his little bride can catch
[1:32:01] the
[1:32:07] Revelation so that you can
[1:32:10] recognize who you are you're the Bride
[1:32:13] of Jesus
[1:32:15] Christ in this seventh Church
[1:32:18] age but youve walked out of laa
[1:32:23] you've walked into the bright
[1:32:27] age into that little wooden
[1:32:32] room where God is giving you a personal
[1:32:37] experience where God wants to give you a
[1:32:40] personal
[1:32:44] experience how we need a personal
[1:32:49] experience with Jesus Christ
[1:32:59] people shout and say we need another
[1:33:05] Revival where people are where we pray
[1:33:08] for the sick and they're
[1:33:16] healed no no we need to be born again
[1:33:23] baptized with the Holy Ghost in
[1:33:27] fire so that you will have the
[1:33:31] faith that when a brother comes to you
[1:33:33] and he's
[1:33:37] sick you can lay hands upon
[1:33:41] him and they'll be
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:48] healed that's the bride's
[1:33:50] Revival
[1:33:53] men and
[1:33:55] women truly being born
[1:34:00] again but is it because if there's one
[1:34:02] thing I
[1:34:05] see that's not
[1:34:07] happening or very
[1:34:11] little is Believers in this
[1:34:15] message with a born again
[1:34:19] experience and the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:22] Ghost in
[1:34:29] fire message
[1:34:32] pastors
[1:34:35] message fornicators and
[1:34:40] adulterers and their
[1:34:43] congregations following in the same
[1:34:46] path and that's what the message is
[1:34:50] producing
[1:34:52] no they've left the
[1:34:55] word they've abandoned
[1:34:58] Christ they have no
[1:35:02] Revelation and they're caught in their
[1:35:06] adultery and they're
[1:35:10] caught and the
[1:35:12] congregation lets them stay as
[1:35:19] pastor and the Apostle Paul
[1:35:24] says the Elder that would do such a
[1:35:28] thing Mark
[1:35:31] him
[1:35:33] publicly he should be
[1:35:40] shamed because if he stays in the
[1:35:44] Pulpit he'll lead all the
[1:35:48] congregation in that Wicked adulterous
[1:35:51] spirit
[1:35:54] then God's house is not a House of
[1:35:56] Prayer no
[1:35:59] more then that message
[1:36:03] church is
[1:36:05] now a den of
[1:36:11] Thieves
[1:36:19] yeah that was
[1:36:22] free that's no extra charge for that
[1:36:26] one and yet it's
[1:36:29] Revelation and yet it's
[1:36:31] truth because they're not getting into
[1:36:33] the
[1:36:35] word they're not getting on their knees
[1:36:37] looking for a message for the
[1:36:50] people
[1:36:53] in the message the first
[1:36:56] seal because in Revelations
[1:37:01] 10 and the fourth
[1:37:04] verse it says and when seven
[1:37:10] Thunders uttered their
[1:37:13] voices I was about to
[1:37:16] write and and I Heard a Voice say don't
[1:37:19] write it
[1:37:23] and everybody in the message
[1:37:26] says we don't know that that was never
[1:37:30] written so we can't know
[1:37:33] it even though it wasn't a written
[1:37:39] word you know what it is you know what
[1:37:42] it still is
[1:37:44] today you know what it still is
[1:37:48] today it's the spoken word
[1:37:52] didn't didn't he say and when seven
[1:37:54] Thunders uttered their
[1:38:00] voices that's the spoken
[1:38:04] word and what was a prophet supposed to
[1:38:07] what was a prophet supposed to bring
[1:38:12] us thus sayith the
[1:38:15] Lord what do Theus sayth the
[1:38:18] Lord the spoken word
[1:38:23] someone might say how can it come to
[1:38:25] pass if it wasn't
[1:38:29] written you go to the Book of
[1:38:33] Genesis when God
[1:38:35] created when God put the whole earth in
[1:38:39] order we read about it
[1:38:43] today but when it was
[1:38:45] spoken and when it came to
[1:38:49] pass when the
[1:38:52] it wasn't
[1:38:54] written it was Moses that wrote the Book
[1:38:57] of
[1:39:00] Genesis you know how long after he wrote
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:05] it more than 2,000
[1:39:08] years came the written
[1:39:11] word so did God did God have to wait for
[1:39:14] Moses to write
[1:39:16] it for him to bring his word to pass
[1:39:22] he did
[1:39:24] not but he allowed it to be
[1:39:26] written he allowed it to be
[1:39:31] written for
[1:39:33] us so that we could
[1:39:35] see God
[1:39:37] moving from Genesis to
[1:39:42] Revelations so that we could see he's
[1:39:44] the same yesterday today and
[1:39:49] forever so we could see the the pattern
[1:39:51] of God's word throughout the thousands
[1:39:54] of
[1:39:58] years so we could see with our eyes how
[1:40:01] God
[1:40:04] works so that we can see in our lives
[1:40:07] and that it's him working
[1:40:16] today questions and
[1:40:18] answers number four
[1:40:22] in
[1:40:25] 1963 they asked brother brandom a
[1:40:29] question we'll be closing quickly
[1:40:33] here and they asked him the question
[1:40:37] was have the seven Thunders which equal
[1:40:41] seven Mysteries already been
[1:40:47] revealed have have the seven
[1:40:49] Thunders
[1:40:52] which
[1:40:57] equals already been
[1:41:02] revealed he says were they revealed in
[1:41:05] the Seven
[1:41:08] Seals but are yet not known to us as the
[1:41:11] Thunders
[1:41:17] yet that was the question
[1:41:21] the
[1:41:22] answer are you interested in this
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:27] answer he says no he says they were
[1:41:30] revealed in the Seven
[1:41:33] Seals that's what the Thunders was
[1:41:40] [Laughter]
[1:41:43] about they were to
[1:41:48] reveal Ian
[1:41:51] the seven
[1:41:53] Thunders that had uttered their
[1:41:57] voices and no one could make out what it
[1:42:01] was John knew what it
[1:42:03] was but he was forbidden to write
[1:42:09] it he said but the seventh
[1:42:13] angel in the days of his
[1:42:18] sounding in the days of his
[1:42:23] sounding the seven
[1:42:25] Mysteries of the seven
[1:42:27] Thunders would be
[1:42:29] revealed and the seventh
[1:42:32] angel is a messenger of the seventh
[1:42:35] Church
[1:42:37] age so what is the
[1:42:41] thunder brother Ram said in the first
[1:42:45] seal he said this we found what thunder
[1:42:49] means
[1:42:52] that's
[1:42:53] perfect we know that
[1:42:55] see he says the
[1:42:58] Thunder was the voice of
[1:43:00] God when the seal
[1:43:03] opened so what would seven Thunders be
[1:43:07] then wouldn't it be the voice of God
[1:43:10] opening Seven
[1:43:13] Seals in the time of the seventh
[1:43:16] angel in
[1:43:19] 1963 in Ville
[1:43:22] Indiana Indiana could God have failed to
[1:43:24] do
[1:43:27] that could God have
[1:43:30] failed no not my
[1:43:33] God he cannot
[1:43:35] fail
[1:43:37] thus comes to pass every
[1:43:42] time so when the a so when the angel on
[1:43:45] Sunset
[1:43:47] Mountain told William
[1:43:49] Bram go back
[1:43:52] East to Jefferson Indiana IND and I will
[1:43:56] give you the
[1:43:58] revelation of those Seven
[1:44:01] Seals is that a
[1:44:03] lie or did that
[1:44:06] happen it
[1:44:09] happened if one of you last the
[1:44:14] Revelation one of
[1:44:19] you it's not because the book isn't
[1:44:23] open it's not because the Revelation
[1:44:26] didn't
[1:44:28] come it's because you need to find your
[1:44:30] place to that little room that wooden
[1:44:36] room and meet the pillar of
[1:44:40] fire and ask him for
[1:44:46] Revelation have you read the church age
[1:44:49] books
[1:44:51] the exposition of the seven Church
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:57] ages what did a prophet tell us
[1:45:00] there I cannot
[1:45:06] overemphasize the
[1:45:08] need for
[1:45:15] Revelation as a matter of
[1:45:19] fact
[1:45:22] Jesus told
[1:45:24] Peter who do you say that I am
[1:45:29] Peter thou are the
[1:45:32] Christ the son of the Living
[1:45:35] God what did Jesus tell
[1:45:39] him is there any Bible readers here this
[1:45:44] morning is that scripture turning in
[1:45:46] your head what Jesus told
[1:45:49] him
[1:45:52] Jesus told
[1:45:54] Peter flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:45:57] this to
[1:45:59] you but my Father which is in
[1:46:02] heaven and Upon This
[1:46:05] Rock I'll build my
[1:46:08] church Stone by
[1:46:12] stone stone by
[1:46:15] Stone one man one woman at a
[1:46:19] time I will change your
[1:46:22] life with the revelation of these Seven
[1:46:37] Seals brother Bram
[1:46:40] said brother brandham
[1:46:42] said in the exposition of the seven
[1:46:45] Church
[1:46:49] ages Malachi
[1:46:53] 4 and Revelations
[1:46:56] 10:7 going to do two
[1:46:59] things number
[1:47:01] one according to Malachi
[1:47:05] 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[1:47:08] children to the
[1:47:13] fathers number
[1:47:15] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:47:18] seven Thunders
[1:47:25] in Revelations
[1:47:27] 10 which are the revelations contained
[1:47:30] in the Seven
[1:47:33] Seals
[1:47:35] which the the which are the
[1:47:39] revelations
[1:47:42] contained in the Seven
[1:47:44] Seals it will
[1:47:47] be this divinely revealed mystery speak
[1:47:54] truths it will be
[1:48:02] these divinely
[1:48:09] revealed that
[1:48:11] literally will turn the hearts of the
[1:48:17] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:48:23] and that's thus sayth the
[1:48:28] Lord and of course the question keeps
[1:48:30] being
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:33] asked are the Seven Seals
[1:48:37] open did the prophet have success in
[1:48:40] doing
[1:48:42] it first of all it wasn't the prophet
[1:48:45] that told us they would be
[1:48:49] open
[1:48:51] no it was God that told the prophet he
[1:48:54] would open
[1:48:57] them did you catch that it wasn't
[1:49:01] William
[1:49:02] brandom that guaranteed
[1:49:06] us that the Seven Seals would be
[1:49:10] open no it was almighty
[1:49:14] God it was the Lord
[1:49:17] Jesus that told the prophet
[1:49:20] go back to
[1:49:23] Jeffersonville and I will give you the
[1:49:25] revelation of these Seven
[1:49:28] Seals God said it I believe it that
[1:49:33] settled it for me is there another
[1:49:36] believer here to say the
[1:49:40] same to say the
[1:49:44] same that I
[1:49:46] believe what Jesus
[1:49:48] said I believe what God God
[1:49:52] said in standing in the
[1:49:56] Gap
[1:49:59] 1963 Prophet said
[1:50:01] this well it happens to
[1:50:05] be that at least one man is present this
[1:50:10] morning who was standing there when it
[1:50:14] happened talking about sunset
[1:50:18] Mountain when the seven angels came
[1:50:22] down it actually shook the Rocks off the
[1:50:30] mountain we we find
[1:50:33] out that during that
[1:50:36] time I saw seven
[1:50:38] angels in a form of a
[1:50:42] pyramid that swept
[1:50:44] down and picked me
[1:50:48] up and I was brought
[1:50:51] East to open the Seven
[1:50:55] Seals for
[1:50:58] himself for
[1:51:00] God if you haven't got
[1:51:05] them if Jesus
[1:51:10] terries my great
[1:51:16] grandchildren little Paul's
[1:51:18] children
[1:51:21] that will still be the Eternal truth of
[1:51:23] the Living
[1:51:28] God now this was to find
[1:51:32] out what was sealed inside this
[1:51:37] mountain that wasn't
[1:51:42] wrote he's talking about one of the
[1:51:47] dreams of the six dreams
[1:51:50] and the One Vision that he spoke
[1:51:54] of in s is this the time in
[1:52:00] SE it had to be
[1:52:03] interpreted and when I came
[1:52:06] back in other words when I came back to
[1:52:09] Jeffersonville
[1:52:12] Indiana to preach the Seven
[1:52:15] Seals he said this the first angel
[1:52:20] on the first
[1:52:22] night opened the
[1:52:26] seal the first
[1:52:28] angel in the first
[1:52:30] night opened the
[1:52:34] seal contrary to anything we have ever
[1:52:38] heard in our
[1:52:41] life and all
[1:52:44] seven came out the same
[1:52:47] way you know that
[1:52:50] you were here present when it happened
[1:52:52] to many of
[1:52:56] you he said the first
[1:52:59] night the first
[1:53:01] Angel met him in that little
[1:53:04] room he said opened the
[1:53:08] seal
[1:53:09] contrary to anything we ever heard in
[1:53:12] our
[1:53:14] life then he said and all seven came the
[1:53:19] same way
[1:53:26] God
[1:53:28] declaring wanting you to
[1:53:32] recognize your day and your
[1:53:36] message we're not waiting for the second
[1:53:39] coming of William
[1:53:42] Brandon we're waiting for the second
[1:53:44] coming of Jesus
[1:53:48] Christ and he's
[1:53:51] come and he's
[1:53:54] here and he's here this
[1:53:58] morning he can meet you where you're
[1:54:02] sitting he can meet you on your knees at
[1:54:04] the
[1:54:07] altar but he's here to meet
[1:54:14] you inur in the message is this the sign
[1:54:18] of the answer
[1:54:22] brother Bram says
[1:54:24] this paragraph
[1:54:27] 3:14 he says now when he begins to
[1:54:33] sound the mystery will be
[1:54:37] finished you're a Bible
[1:54:41] reader you know he's speaking about
[1:54:43] Revelations
[1:54:46] 10:7 he says now notice
[1:54:50] then it's time for the seven seal
[1:54:55] voices now it's time then it's
[1:55:00] time for the seven seal
[1:55:10] voices in other words the seven
[1:55:15] Thunders so when the when the seventh
[1:55:18] angel begins to
[1:55:21] sound when the seventh angel begins to
[1:55:26] sound that's the time of the seven
[1:55:31] thunders of Revelations
[1:55:34] 10 to be
[1:55:36] revealed do you understand he said when
[1:55:40] all the mysteries of the book was
[1:55:44] completed that's the
[1:55:46] time so Revelations 10
[1:55:51] what did a prophet tell us it
[1:55:53] is Revelations
[1:55:56] 10 is the seven
[1:55:58] seal Revelations

[1:56:43] Seals were
[1:56:45] opened on Sunset
[1:56:48] Mountain amen and the angel spoke to the
[1:56:54] prophet the angel with an open book in
[1:56:57] his

[1:57:47] day that scripture
[1:57:51] fulfilled am
[1:57:59] Amen in the message I have heard but now

[1:58:14] church age to
[1:58:18] reformers and we had
[1:58:20] them but we but he promised in Malachi
[1:58:24] 4 he he'd keep his pattern in the last
[1:58:30] days what would take
[1:58:32] place to turn the hearts of the
[1:58:36] children back to the faith of the apost
[1:58:39] apostolic
[1:58:40] [Music]

[1:59:30] revealed and the mysteries of God would
[1:59:32] be

[2:03:12] serpent like
[2:03:14] Eve she received the seed of the
