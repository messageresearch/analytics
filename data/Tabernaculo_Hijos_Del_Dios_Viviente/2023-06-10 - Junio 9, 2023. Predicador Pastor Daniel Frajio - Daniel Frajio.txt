TRANSCRIPT
========================================
me again is a Nissan lucky States Hallelujah is [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay please [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] good morning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it is [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh Lord I do [Music] yes it's a battery it's a pleasure to be here and uh we are appreciate the invitation of my brother happy to be here so we're happy to be here and to see you all again and his wife his family and just asking the Lord Jesus to help us to share something that will bless your heart maybe maybe something new maybe something that you've already heard before but I'm sure it'll be something you know that we could only know because God sent a prophet not only a prophet that but he was a messenger he was a messenger to this last eight amen and he brought to us the word of God the word of God that has been lost since the days of Jesus every verse seemed to be a verse all by itself and yet we know we realize the Bible isn't written that way at home that every verse connects from Genesis to Revelations and everyone speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ I like this again here in Revelations chapter five [Music] because Revelations chapter five and he's looking all the way back to Genesis all the way to the day he was living and he was looking to the Future and all of this happened in this one chapter so if you'll turn with me to Revelations chapter five Singapore and verse 1 will read it and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals we thank you once again this evening and ask that you would come on the scene where your word can only be known by Revelation foreign give it to every born-again believer said when you spoke to Nicodemus I think we wanted to keep this unless you be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God you can't see a new testament rising up you know you can't see the Shadows becoming reality you can't see that the millions of lands that were slain of the Lamb of God so Lord we speak on this chapter today may you Open the Eyes of our understandings thank you Revelations chapter five begins with John saying and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within on the back side and in English that's where the karma is a sealed with Seven Seals so for many years as the prophet would read this scripture and read that verse that something was written on the back side and sealed with Seven Seals and from the early part of this ministry we're back in the 19 [Music] and he believed that those Seven Seals for the seven Thunders and he said in 1963 in the breach he says there's nothing written on the back side he says and seven Thunders is not the same as Seven Seals but for 10 years that he believed that it was but when the Holy Spirit came down and even corrected the opinion of the Prophet himself this is John Cena vision and John is seeing this vision and verse the first verse begins in Genesis and John is looking back to Genesis and he was judging the whole world in Genesis he was judging Adam in Genesis he was judging the woman he was going to bring judgment on the serpenter and this is John give this one looking back to Genesis and seeing God on the throne in Genesis we need judgment to his children it was a judgment of the whole world of course there was only three people but they were the whole world they were all the inhabitants that were on the earth [Music] let's turn to Genesis chapter 3 thank you and read on this judgment Throne that was taking place the veil of Holiness has been taken from their eyes and now they realize they were naked because they're eating from the tree or the knowledge of Good and Evil together instead of the tree of life and the knowledge of Good and Evil yeah [Music] and to eat of that tree yesterday but only the knowledge you've been called to live a life they ate of the tree and in verse 13 of Genesis 3 the universe [Music] it's the same story today [Music] partake about the things that God said don't touch the unclean things [Music] and the Lord God sent unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed of all the cattle above every beast of the field and upon thy Valley shalt thou go and thus shall thou eat all the days of thy life foreign [Music] himself [Music] but he was a beast he was all animals shall I go and thus shall I eat all the days of thy life the serpent was a one-of-a-kind animals I don't believe there was a Mr and Mr serpenter but this serpent was male a male Beast it was it was created for this very purpose foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] it's why the servant was able to be was able to be uh seduced himself to approach the woman you say in order to even come close to believing this surely God would have done it somewhere else in the Bible because there's got to be a pattern as you read in the Book of Jonah because a World's Fair in Kentucky I believe it was and as he was walking with some people and a tour guide they walked in front of the skeleton of a whale and the tour guide said this is the largest whale in the world it is so many 100 and some feet long many many times and this is the skeleton of that whale he says but if you'll notice throat on this whale [Music] he says and I'm sure some of you have read the whole fables that Jonah was swallowed by a great by a whale well as you can see you are witnesses right now then it's impossible it's impossible for a whale to swallow a man Brothers [Music] could have swallowed a railroad [Music] that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and foreign [Music] in the line read the books of the Bible that God had to show someone these things and Genesis and the vision he's seen that has audio to it long before there was televisions God gave the prophet's Vision [Music] something they would see us and God wants to give us a vision he wants you to see it I'm able to hear it to catch Revelations so here in Genesis Moses are speaking foreign at this at this Throne of judgment and in verse 14 of Genesis 3 Moses says Moses was speaking he's telling us the stories just like you might watch a video you see the people in the video that's exactly how Moses that's how all the prophets of God it's like they were right there the day it happened but he wasn't there today foreign Genesis 3 14. and the Lord God said unto the serpenter because thou has done this place each day Thou Art cursed above and above every beast of the field of animals and the world doesn't see it and the denominations [Music] [Music] the teaching of the seat of the serpent couldn't be more clear and the first time that term was right here in verse 14. and God said to the serpenter and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between nicely so that's the serpency as I said and her said bruise and God was bringing judgment it was the first Throne of judgments but it won't be the last the next one at the end the answer 25. true God is a god of Holiness and his children had torn the veil of Holiness and God won't have his children walking around naked his daughters walking around in shorts wearing clothing so tight it looks like they were hoarding them since the beginning of Genesis God close them he took off the clothing that they thought was good enough remember Adam and Eve took thick leaves and they tried to cover themselves a little people on the beaches of today and God said no not for my children and the Lord God said to verse 22. the man has become as one of us to know good and evil is had a choice they had a choice to become like God what man had become like [Music] [Music] let my church foreign and he drove out the men and he placed him at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubins he hit the joke was and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life United's father is this is where John's Vision comes in here in verse when Adam lost he lost the book of eternal life he lost a friendship with the father he lost his leadership to go to Maestro he lost everything and he was drove out of the presence of God but there's a detail that that John added when he seen the vision one of them act in Revelations five and when John saw this scene of the throne well God saw when John saw Adam and Eve had been put out of the Throne of God [Music] from the point of view that God allowed John to look that Moses didn't say the most John looks back to Genesis of Hennessy after God had put his children out of his presence he says I saw I saw in the right hand of him you mean that [Music] that there was nothing written on the back side that everything word everything had to be within the atonement that was made for us nothing could be outside of Christ and after 1963. where the comma is placed right now is grammatically correct for the men who wrote it where we were men of great understanding they were men who studied languages prophetic opinion and when he read it and after 1963. he said and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written Within and on the back side seal with Seven Seals it changes the whole meaning can't be another significant there's nothing written on the backside now we went from reading something that was grammatically correctly corrected foreign [Music] he begins to descend foreign foreign Lucifer offered them a real religion loses [Music] it was supposed to be a shortcut and I thought a shortcut to what God has promised them already that's what an unjust Steward does uh that's what an unjust story foreign [Music] [Music] how much wheat they're putting them in the same condition that they are in because why would you want normally half your sins forgiven that's what I've been thinking Jesus Christ [Applause] but religions and denominations today they want to say I'll forgive you the half right now you don't even have to pray you don't you don't have to come to church just on Sundays foreign [Applause] if he could get them [Music] Lucifer put his finger in God's face there's something that you don't understand this whenever [Music] yeah mankind has fallen so low we can't go to him no problem [Music] s that was Revelations [Music] Revelations with the book that Adam lost and bring this word for the Salvation and then God and John said one thing is the next thing he sees he says I saw a strong angels foreign [Music] what he didn't understand foreign [Music] and one of the elders say them to me there are many Revelations five and five weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David and prevailed to open the program and to lose [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] that's Jesus that's the first coming of Christ Revelations [Music] the Bible says here in verse 5. that it was Jesus [Music] the book was first opening an entire Jesus Christ here it is remember this one point if nothing else [Music] we're included [Music] [Music] there is [Applause] Jesus Christ Israel because this line of the tribe of Jews he came to his own people first his disciples through the people of the Apostles he gave them a commandment go only to the house of Israel only to the lost sheep of Israel your only your commission is only to Israel Jewish people that was the line of the tribe of Judah the Lions Israel Israel but with Israel rejected these Seven Seals with the Shadows of the Old Testament we're blinded they couldn't see it and what did they reject the opening of the book of the oldest church was given to the youngest a gentile Church Revelations Revelations God in Genesis the year was about four thousand dollars somebody's God jumps to the days of the Angel of the Covenant with Israel now verse 2 jumps to about jumps to about 2 000 years later about about the year 2 500. and then verse 5 jumps all the way to the days of Jesus so from verse 1 to verse five thousand years that John takes us from verse 1 to verse 5. Oh you see how this Bible is written therefore foreign [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] what is said [Music] must as the youngest son would just get a blessing foreign God bless you and goodbye so Jacob is there but he's blind he's dying has already put the Elvis at it is [Music] right they rejected [Music] decrease and in Matthew 24 he brought to them when you hear the message [Music] I want you to open your Bibles to the Book of Matthew 24. I want you to open to revelation [Music] [Music] [Music] 60 years later foreign so when John sees this Vision all the way to verse 5. it already happened and he lived through it as though he lived in the day it happened he didn't have the Revelation but he was a prophet he said prophets so John was having these tremendous Visions it was all history the book you have really broke the Redemption you know how the book opens so I promise he gave he gave the first part of the opening of the book to a man called John the Baptista and he said John yeah you're the Forerunner I want you to open the book with this statement in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that was the first revelation [Music] refilling [Music] that high place it's the original message Jesus Christ a foreign yeah after the prophet preached the seals he says this book The Bible and he had read it already for 30 years he said I can never be the same man again book The Bible is the first coming of Christ that was The Inheritance to the firstborn just as it was in the allegory but when they reject it the message The Plan of Redemption the book of redemption when they refuse to see the seven parts of redemption represented by Jacob Crossing his arms in the tree of life agenda was given to you the vision continues and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain Seattle is verse 6 my people of faith is the ministerial change God changes again from God on the throne God changed forms and became the angel of the Covenant in verse and it becomes a man he creates himself a body creates a seed and brings forth an Immaculate birth because that that man had to be a perfect man born to the sexual desire of [Music] and in four days [Music] to uh because this land the Passover land to be a sacrifice for the entire nations foreign [Music] [Music] washed away in Colorado having seven horns and seven eyes and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne this is Jesus the change now is not a change in foreign [Music] after praying accepting the will of the following Jesus walked out Jesus he left this Crown in the garden [Music] and picked up his robe of sacrifice amen so now here he is foreign overcoming power in your life [Applause] but not he came only for the Jews now he's the savior of the whole world remember when the Manchester came but when the Shepherds came when they were in the fields the constellation of angels behold this day is born a savior [Applause] Lord the book has never been called the Lion's book the book has always been called the land of salvation [Music] and Jesus again he enters into the ministry of the Lamb of God and the Bible says in verse 7. and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne you see now the book is being taken for the second time Israel that was Isaiah at the first coming of Christy now jumps ahead in time again verse six I think what I'm saying it was actually just days later it's Jesus jumps all the way to the 20th century when the lamb took the book on the right hand of him that sat on the throne the days of Jesus foreign I will give you the revelation Allah and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne so from verse is God back in Genesis and verse 7. almighty God in 1963. [Music] you see how God writes his words which are the prayers and they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the skills he was just the book s for that was slain because this is a scene of the Throne of God foreign that ever died and was born on planet Earth God will judge the whole world [Music] [Music] primero [Music] [Music] glad Richard University Revelations five and it ends with God foreign [Music] foreign [Music] now is the time to lay it before that they might ask for your answer okay if they came this evening not knowing what to expect may they now realize they're in the presence the baptism of the Holy Spirit eternal to be next to you oh don't lose this opportunity foreign [Music] amen [Music] [Music] no save you [Music] yeah me
