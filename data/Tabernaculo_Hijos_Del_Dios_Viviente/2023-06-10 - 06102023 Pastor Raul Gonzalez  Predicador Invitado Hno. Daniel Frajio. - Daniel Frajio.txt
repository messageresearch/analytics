the redeemed of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] we had all the pieces denominations have mixed the pieces all up for us it didn't make any sense anymore we've come to a place [Music] and and the revealing of the Seven Seals in Revelations and the prophet told us those Seven Seals it's the whole book it's bullied Genesis we'd like to begin in Revelations chapter 8. and verse Revelations chapter six uh is is John Cena vision of the first six seals and then it goes into Revelation seven you know and Revelations is the prophet taught us it was a time of real world war one and World War II yeah and while God comes to gather Israel again to the promised land in Italian 1945 yeah at the same time [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and and and we look at this scripture and we see that's all that's said and we think how could we possibly understand our understandings but the way we'll understand it tonight both of yours he wasn't leaving his own voice [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] from the dark two o'clock as you step in and uh um [Music] [Music] the Lord told him there was going to be three changes in his ministry and he calls the first one the first school yeah and it is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that was Jesus foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] Revelations 10 1-7 foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] from the seventh angel messenger of the seventh seal and 5100 message in Revelation 10. it's a revelation yes was the seventh seal era now he's connected so now we thought we thought that the seventh seal or Apen that only one verse was written about it in the Bible so now we have 11 more verses describing to us [Music] the Fig Tree Israel but uh in other words and again I grow the Bright Tree a gentile bride but another word that's you someone said that's me connect with it in 1963. there was a man called James E MacDonald he was the head of the science department they're in Tucson and he wrote up a scientific page on on the cloud that appeared yes was widely observed over Northern Arizona 1963 report s to report there is no weird condition all over Arizona from every angle yeah [Music] based on four photos about 280 miles from the clouds almost 300 miles away is [Music] a hit the crowd but it's unusually Great Heights but also an unusually low altitude because it's remarkable shape is suggests that it was a cloud I've previously unrecorded time in other words The History of Science because when we read foreign but when we read what this man James MacDonald said he said this Cloud remained Sunday as dual uh for 28 minutes after the sun went down when the seven seal was open there was silence in heaven about the space of 28 minutes [Music] John said about a half hour [Music] to verse 11. and it reads like this and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time through the seasons which the father has put in his own powers but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come apart from Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria is Jesus speaking to a disciples he has been a monster for 40 days [Music] ten days [Music] they were with Jesus [Music] oh my God and while they stood step past they were steady towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel yeah they're saying Jesus which is taken up into heaven yes [Applause] foreign [Music] Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast again lined up online he wants to show you the pattern of God's words [Applause] because the angel said the way you've seen them go okay I'll see him return again Revelations [Applause] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven open and he set his right foot upon the scene and his left foot upon the Earth the book he had in his hands he had his right foot upon the sea Anthony she represents a multitude of people represents a gentile child representative and Footprints represents possession he uh where he has representative position he said that he had his right foot upon the seats that was a particular spot on the earth for Israel for a gentile people modern events [Music] in the same message what's he doing for us scripture is not individual one to each other to extend his hand to your eyes these modern events is a student by us do swiftly we're going to find out we'll be without nothing every one of them must be fulfilled at its age [Music] the time of the revealing of the word the message this day the scripture is fulfilled [Music] he says he said seven angels said the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries [Music] till the holy spirit this is the message foreign foreign [Music] glorious [Music] Revelations 10. it says in a message called the bridge one of the first messages that was part of the series in paragraph 39 and this is because no man nowhere knows it okay let alone Jesus Christ and now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood foreign [Music] on the Earth professor [Music] [Music] what is Revelations [Music] whatever [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] was open there on the mountains die right now in this Pulpit is again a year and six months before it happened what would happen out there in the desert another man sitting right here tonight we're standing right there and present okay now they don't even know what it's all about it March 17th 1963 William Brandon begins you know the message called God and simplicity March 24th he preaches foreign yeah it was a prophecya for 2 000 years but God brought it to pass 45 days the message the first seal anyways now then reformers know that there was something wrong [Music] the messenger is not to start any Reformation foreign [Music] foreign [Music] let's get a video where we're here and we're breaking them now in other words [Music] and the people sitting there listening to him preach ER they preached the Seven Seals and no one understood when he had questions and answers I want you to write down questions please don't ask me anything else [Music] we are the generations the first person the thing is Revelations and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Founders had uttered their voices he left those things with the seven Thunders uttered and right them not and everyone in the message says that's not even written so how can you even for each other it's true John Juan wasn't allowed to write him no celebrated yesterday but here's another truth that has never ceased to be the spoken word and how were the worlds created by the spoken word of God [Music] [Music] is the spoken original word of God when God speaks nothing can stop what he's speaking original is the message the first sale 1963. yeah we found what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that says is Seven Seals that's what the Thunders were about the message questions and answers questions and answers number four they ask him a question have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed foreign [Music] Montreal no they were they were Brazil that's what the Thunders was about seven Thunders and then other third voices foreign [Music] and the seventh angel is the messenger he is [Music] Seven Seals [Music] the exposition of the two things according to Malachi 4. turned the hearts of the children to the fathers he will reveal Ed the Seven Wonders it will be this divinely revealed mystery truth back at the first coming of Christ and there's a very possible for today but consider this also consideration this Prophet messengero will be in his nature and manners as were Elijah the people of this prophets now this messenger States will be as they were in Ahab today and since it's only the children only the children of the Millions [Applause] foreign and with a message standing on the gap for the Brenham says well it happens to be that at least one man is present this morning I was standing there when it happened he's talking about what those angels came down it actually shook the Rocks off the mountains you find out that during that time I saw seven angels and I was brought East for God if you haven't got them my great grandchildren is little Paul's children Paul that will still be the Eternal truth of the Living God now that was to find out now that all right so that was to find out what was sealed inside this mountain yes to be interpreted to say the first angel on the first time he's talking about when he preached the seals and when I came back Jeffersonville Jeffersonville on the first time to everything we have ever heard in our life when it happened to any of you voices and the message is this is a sign of the answer yeah now when he begins to sound that he was him but he pushes it off like it's someone else [Applause] [Music] when all the Mysteries of the book has been completed and the Bible said here that he would finish the Mysteries [Music] he has told us that Revelation just told us that Revelation stands it says he has told us that Revelation stands is the time when the seven seal was open foreign [Music] give out them together all right he said Revelation 10 is the right age foreign it says and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever and the things they're in yeah and the things that are there in yes and the things that there should be time no longer yeah the time hand through the preaching of the seals yes it's all been there it's all in there time didn't end what happened was the Mysteries were revealed foreign [Music] video The Mysteries was revealed yes this must be a post-millennialist or something or someone that asked a question because see we got a thousand years after the church has gone home then times [Music] Revelations let's read it again man Revelations 10 and verse 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels if God should be finished in the message I have heard but now I see and if it's nothing the prophet had less than 30 days to live in this message he said now we're promised a church age to reformers the church have we had them already and he says and we've had them but they promised their Malachi foreign denomination pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the mysteries of God will be declared and he says yes and the Seven Angel begins to sound this message and the question for us has been for years [Music] when did this prophecy come to pass [Music] of Japan is he's showing you the best turn of the ministry of Jesus Jesus when he started out he started Healing The Sick and Afflicted everybody wanted him in his church at one time when he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life that was the third full ministry of Jesus praying for the sick like he used foreign [Music] [Applause] getting with God it was 10 service service foreign Korea automobile accidents is just because he died doesn't he have to return again [Music] [Music] in in the message is this the sign of the answer is the way you'll know Cesar [Music] [Applause] [Music] guys when it is taking office he told us in a message [Music] foreign yeah and why he's the messenger he says hey I've been the messenger up to this time for up to what time November 1963. I send a message [Music] how I would like to dwell on that a few minutes it sounds [Music] I must increase I've been the messenger up to this time now he takes my place he wanted no one to worship him two years before he passes away so that God can increase your eyes is is [Music] and it says in Revelations 10 and 8 these apocalypse because the first seven days the first seven verses there's still three versions there's still one two three four verses Left four verses that John says unto me again okay no he was a prophet okay William Brennan was not a revealer of the world be real to him [Music] go to pain upon the Earth [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen he says this word and it'll be better trials [Music] with words I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bites it's the morning and experience foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] and this Sevenfold book of The Seven Redemption plans yes and that's what this book holds yes all right when you have to digest it is a matter of everybody's against you see you're off of your head so it's hard to digest it is corrector that's this book is this terrible that's the seventh seals it's the voice under their voices [Music] through the Lamb of God [Music] that everyone could leave here God bless you tonight I had something more to saying glorious [Music] [Music] [Music] Let's Fall together [Music]
