[2:05] and then I'm gonna ask some of you to
[2:07] help me
[2:11] so how your Bible is open and handy
[2:14] because
[2:33] thank you
[2:38] so Genesis chapter 22 says
[2:42] verse 12 verse
[2:45] and he said lay not that hand upon the
[2:49] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[2:52] for now I know that thou fear is God
[2:55] think thou has not withheld thy song
[2:57] than only son from me
[3:09] [Music]
[3:18] by his horns and Abraham went and took
[3:21] the RAM and offered him up for a burnt
[3:24] offering in the state of the son and
[3:26] please also around foreign
[3:34] [Music]
[3:41] and Abraham called the name of that
[3:43] place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to
[3:46] this day in the Mount of the Lord it
[3:48] shall be seen
[3:56] um
[3:57] [Music]
[4:00] let us make a little prayer foreign
[4:02] [Music]
[4:22] Hallelujah
[4:24] so the name is Jehovah Jireh and Thomas
[4:27] [Music]
[4:32] it actually means
[4:37] God will
[4:39] do it because
[4:48] so God will make things to happen
[4:53] if you read if you read the whole
[4:55] chapter
[4:58] told Abraham absolutely
[5:04] and in a sacrifice yeah you know what
[5:09] that means
[5:34] [Music]
[6:10] but the Bible said in the book of
[6:12] Hebrews
[6:14] chapter 11 said Abraham believe that God
[6:20] was able to give Isaac back to him
[6:29] because the guy is capable to do that
[6:33] it was a tight you know people if it was
[6:36] it was a a shadow
[6:39] of something that was going to happen
[6:41] later on
[6:45] and and
[6:48] Abraham places in Isaac on on the outer
[6:51] and told us
[6:53] and Abraham is about to grab or Abraham
[6:56] grabs the knife
[7:03] when God speaks to Abraham
[7:06] and he tells Abraham
[7:10] I see that you're faithful
[7:12] I see that you believe me
[7:18] foreign
[7:20] [Music]
[7:37] and he wasn't stuck in the thinking
[7:45] how did that happen so we're going out
[7:48] the mountains
[7:54] and the Bible says that Abraham's places
[7:57] uh the wood in the back of Isaac he is
[8:02] [Music]
[8:08] and I said what's going on about them
[8:11] with his dad yeah
[8:14] and I said what's a little intelligence
[8:21] I know that my dad does things out of
[8:24] the ordinary he was actually possible
[8:27] you know
[8:29] bad
[8:33] we have the fire in here
[8:44] something was telling I said oh you
[8:47] better watch out
[8:52] the hope don't worry son whatever
[8:57] the Lord will provide a sacrifice
[9:02] amen amen and that was just a type yeah
[9:08] with uh Psalm 23
[9:13] Psalm 23. again
[9:23] anybody can read it
[9:42] Psalm 23 1.
[9:45] yes

[13:13] first word look what this sacrifice
[13:16] provides
[13:19] he born our dreams
[13:23] and carry our sorrows
[13:28] so those two things
[13:30] greens and Sorrows your griefs and
[13:34] sorrows
[13:36] or taken by Jesus
[13:39] on the cross the new now Serve Yourself
[13:43] that this prophecy against the prophecy
[13:47] was created about 700 years before Jesus
[13:51] came to the Earth foreign
[14:15] was about to give Isaac as a sacrifice
[14:27] coming down to earth and evil himself as
[14:31] a sacrifice foreign
[14:47] [Music]
[15:03] Jesus paid for it Jesus father foreign
[15:06] [Music]
[15:18] [Music]
[15:42] and with his stripes we are here
[15:52] so the healing of your body
[15:55] was also paid of that cross
[15:59] [Music]
[16:00] by Jesus Christ
[16:04] [Music]
[16:05] let's move on a little bit past first
[16:09] Peter 1.
[16:12] [Music]
[16:14] verse 3 and 4. now second Peter I'm
[16:17] sorry so second Peter verse 3 uh
[16:20] bring the chapter 1 verse 3 and 4.
[16:32] verse chapter one verse 3 and 4. I
[16:36] forgot to put four there
[16:38] amen
[16:44] according of his divine power has given
[16:47] unto us all things that are changed unto
[16:50] life and nothingness to the knowledge of
[16:52] him that has called us to glory and
[16:55] virtue
[17:00] by this he might be partakers of the
[17:03] divine nature of having this faith of
[17:06] corruption that is in the world to lust
[17:09] amen thank you
[17:12] foreign
[17:24] so according to his divine power and
[17:26] does
[17:28] he has given us all things
[17:33] he has given us all things
[17:36] that belonged to his divine power
[17:40] supply
[17:48] of his glory and virtue that's Gloria
[18:01] so that you can share that life with
[18:04] somebody else
[18:11] because somebody have it
[18:14] that's chapter 4 verse 12.
[18:19] foreign
[18:36] [Music]
[18:38] thank you
[18:40] foreign
[18:41] [Music]
[18:47] even among men whereby we must be saved
[18:51] so what what is what is what what is
[18:54] this telling us
[18:57] the sacrifice sacrificial that Jesus
[19:00] made on the cross
[19:02] gives him the rights
[19:05] to be a name above all names they said
[19:08] numbers
[19:12] is a in Spanish
[19:18] [Music]
[19:24] yes
[19:27] and I don't know Portuguese and maybe
[19:30] another Chinese or something is
[19:32] different because
[19:33] um
[19:36] and however you pronounce that name
[19:44] that he was defeated
[19:47] by the guy foreign
[20:14] wow
[20:18] Jesus
[20:20] you know you name it everybody's name is
[20:23] Jesus
[20:26] you cannot just say Jesus
[20:30] because there's many Jesus
[20:33] is
[20:40] you know I think
[20:59] the sacrifice for you and I foreign
[21:20] verse 5 through 8.
[21:27] look what it says about Jesus
[21:42] filipences
[21:54] foreign
[21:58] [Music]
[22:27] [Music]
[23:02] Jesus was
[23:04] in the form of God Jesus
[23:11] they would see a man and your beloved
[23:14] and it was more than a man
[23:17] he was someone greater than Solomon
[23:20] himself
[23:24] he was so many prayer that the temple of
[23:27] God himself
[23:30] he was a god
[23:33] coming down to earth
[23:36] in the form of a baby
[23:38] but can you imagine that because
[23:41] that was the sacrifice
[23:44] the little lamb
[23:50] and died for you
[23:54] we need to have the same feeling this is
