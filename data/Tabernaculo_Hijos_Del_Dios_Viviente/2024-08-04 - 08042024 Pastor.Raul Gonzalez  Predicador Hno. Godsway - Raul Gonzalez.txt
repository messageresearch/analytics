said me let is go into the house of the Lord and said forget not the of the saint forget not come to church know I used we don't come to meet our friends our brothers we come to meet Jesus Christ it's an individual is between you and CHR so if you walk into the of the Lord don't be worried about whatever is going on Jacob meeting Jesus meeting Jesus at Bethlehem at Beth he say he wrestle with the Lord he wrestle with until his name was changed on Israel and when we come in the prayer and we know Jesus is here then what stop you what stop you what stops you from reaching out to Christ now say that you might be worried with a lot of test throughout the week that is fine but Jesus is here he's asking if you could give him all your burdens all your worries all your troubl you take care of it no you just don't have to worry much you just have to believe that he here and he here to H all your needs all that is to have the faith and ask and believe he's going to do it no I just don't I don't need to know what you are going through but I'm assuring that Jesus Christ is here and you have to speak to him you know God is for us God is for you and God is for me and so God is here because of you and me so if you realize how important you are to God then you not let the devil trust you about on things that are not important on that are not important and I'm happy to see all of you here this morning you know a blessing to follow fellowship with the children of God because whenever we gather our Lord is in our midst our Lord is in our midst know as I was I was coming and I was thinking about a lot of things and I was looking every time we tend to worry also about a lot of things said something so much I'm interested in he said the Battle Ground is the mind the Battle Ground and that is where you need to win your Victory so it is in your mind you have to come to the realization the agreement that I am a Christian and after that then you have to make a step towards it a step towards it but said the mind is a free ground yeah it's not it is neither for God nor for the devil nor for the devil no not for any of them yeah and any idea can comes in there but God has given a power and an ability to make a decision to let who to stay and who to re your life you know one way the other one way or the other we are in battle on this Earth and whether you want to accept it or not whether you want to accept or not we fight every day every second and you know as Christians we also fight a battle because we are soldiers of the cross and if we Are Soldiers then we are supposed to fight for a CA and I want to quick I want us to quickly open our Bible to Ephesians 6 ver2 [Music] Ephesians verse 12 for we restle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places I want to wait here later I want to stand here later stand on this scripture know I like to understand that we are in a battle and we in a fight but we want to see the kind of fight we are into as Christians is it is it going to take a gun or grab some Cutlas grab some Cutlas or knife or Spar an arrow an arrow to go and fight but you have to know the kind of battle we are going and the kind of weapon we have to take along you know years back years back centuries back they go to war with arrows and catas and knives but if today if they say there war or if there's a word today and you go grab a knife everybody will be thinking there's something wrong with you because there has been a transformation people are using guns atomic bombs things has changed so in you you know the battle you are entering into and the kind of weapons that you have to use and as Christian as soldiers of the Cross we didn't know the battle we are fighting and the kind of weapon we need to use and scripture has let us understand that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood so it's not a feast battle it's not a fist battle by something different but as men dwelling within our mortal bodies we we can't fight this battle ourselves but one thing for certain we know there is a man his name is Jesus as long as he lead us to the battle we are going to be all right and for go to the battle you know if a soldier want to go to a battle he's going to prepare we some kind of clothes the same way happens he's going to wear his boot where where his safety V and protect all the body he he can protect but we Christians and not un battled about the flesh but in the spirit and we have to know how we have to we ought to we have to know how we ought to prepare ourself for this battle and you know there's one thing I love so much about the military or about the forces when it com to you know the other time learn to listen to chain of command chain of commands and the other time waiting for the commander to give an instruction and these people being men trust in a [Music] man who does know when he dies who doesn't know when he dies that he's a man who is killed in war that if he is a man who is skilled in war skilled and that man can lead them for the battle and bring them back home [Music] safely how much more we who are master and Lord Jesus Christ has conquered [Music] everything but he say the key the key of hell is in his hands the key of hell and he has dominion over Heaven and Earth and has conquered the grave and has overcome death if you are blessed blessed if you are blessed yeah and privileged to have such a man to be the leader We are following then why not we give all and obey the command of our master and Lord Jesus Christ you know there is no better Commander than our Lord Jesus Christ he's the one who will never leave you you know he told the apostles he told the apostles I'm going but I will not leave you comfortless that is the god that we worship maybe I I don't know what you are looking for but there's nothing more desperate that I want you to look for than the presence of God around you because if you have the presence of God you don't need to worry about anything because God is going to take of all your worries you know often times the devil make us forget who we are and how powerful our God is so we to wonder as an orphan and struggle to do things with our own strength but when you come to the recognition that your master your father is the creator of Heaven and Earth and there is nothing too difficult for him then you be wor wored the last time the last time I spoke about Amnesia a state where you don't recognize who you are and said yeah there are other wor disease on this Earth there's other worest disease on this Earth but Amnesia is the worst of it all because you don't recognize Who You Are nor even the people around you but my brother but my brother my sister there is nothing worse much more than spiritual Amnesia when you don't recognize who you are and when you don't recognize who you worship and you don't Rec who you serve and you don't Rec who you serve you don't recognize who you serve serve or who you worship the devil is going to toss you around you know it doesn't matter that Jesus is around it doesn't matter Jesus is around the devil is still going to toss you around because because you don't know that Jesus is around because you don't know that Jesus is around because you don't know you know when they were traveling by the ship or the canoe when they were traveling with Jesus sleeping in the boat Jesus traveling with the disciples in the boat and Jesus was sleeping of Jesus was there but there was a trouble there was a storm and thought the thought they thought they were thinking that they thought that I been a fisherman for years I've been a fisherman for years no I know how the sea works we we we could handle it with our experience we could handle it with our experence you know that is all the time the nature of a man we get to the point that that Jesus is in our boat Jesus is in our house but for this type of thing that we are doing we say Jesus you just rest I can do it myself but if you a Christian and Jesus is your commander you shouldn't come to a point it shouldn't come to a point that you are going to make a decision without considering God I love David I love David I love David yeah and if somebody ask me which Bible character do you like in the [Music] Bible I like almost everybody I like almost everybody I like almost is but there's something unique about David unto me he said whatever before David would take every step concerning his life before he would take every step concerning his life he first consult the Lord my question is do we consult the Lord whenever we want to do something you know David had a mighty Army David has had a mighty Army a big army and he went to war and when he went to war he conquered and when he came back home he said all his family and he the people we want with war their wife his with their wives and children has been taken to captivity have been taken captive you being a powerful man like David man like David you would have just gone after your enemies you have just gone after your enemies because you were a man of experience in war he even killed gol he even K gol so what stopped David for to pursue his enemies but so what stopped David from pursuing his enemies or going after his enemies what stop him from going after his enemies but the Bible said David went before the Lord and as oh Lord should I go after them he never did with his experiences he didn't do with his War skills he consult the Lord all the time my brother my sister let give preference to God because the back that we we are going to fight because the battle that we have is not flesh and blood we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities you know sometime people think you know it's going to be some Demon come to stand before you it's going to be some sort of Person coming to stand before you but sometime the demon could just be an idea that is being sponsored throughout the whole world that everybody is believing throughout the world and that is where you need to stand your grounds that is where you need to stand your grounds as a Christian stand your ground [Music] and know says something he said the devil have a right to a punch and the devil has a right to a punch so we make sure you cover your weak [Music] spot because the Lord visit the Lord visit visit and the devil visit but be careful when the devil visit you will not be the day that you are weak and feeble look at job job didn't do anything wrong but look at the Calamity that be J but yet still in his troubled moment he said I know my redeemer leave it he was still regarding God you know we come to a point in our life and as Christians and we turn to believe in people then the God will claim we worship than the God we claim we worship and we try to do think we can do with friends but all the time David consults the Lord have ask yourself how many times have I make a decision without con Consulting God and where has it lead me to no the battle is on my brother my sister bam said we are not in a picnic we are not in a picnic you know in picnic everybody does whatever he likes but we are Christians We Are Soldiers of the Cross and we have a way we need to do our things and you see often time people think when I become a Christian I go to church I pay my tith that is all I don't have to face anything in life again I don't have to face any challenge in life again I don't have to get an accident I don't have to get an accident yeah I don't I don't have to get sick because I'm a Christian oh no it doesn't work like that yeah you are a Christian you go to church all right but you are not let off the challenges of this world you need to fight you know H when God delivered the people out of Egypt God said I have given you the land but when they send the 12 Spies onto the land he said 10 of them came back and said we look like grasshoppers before them and two of them said it doesn't M it doesn't matter whether we look like grass Whoppers or not God said the land is for us God promised them the land God promised them the land but he said you need to fight and God has promised us another kingdom and if you want to enter into this Kingdom then we need to fight we need to fight the desires of the flesh we need fight gossiping we need fight gossiping we need to fight gossiping lying stealing adultery we need we need to fight all these thing so if we are in the batt land is for us but we need to fight for the land and that is where we have come to and if you realize that the Christian journey is a battle and that you don't have the strength to fight this battle but you need God in your life to be able to overcome you will never live a lifestyle or make a decision without first considering God because you know the Bible said one thing that I love so much the Bible said one maybe you should open to Isaiah chapter 54:1 17 Isaiah 54:17 we look at what the Bible said over there Isaiah 54:1 17 said no weapon that is form against thee shall prosper no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper that means a weapon shall form against you you a weapon shall form against you that means a weapon shall form against you a weapon yeah so a Christian stuff are going to happen to you and weapons will be formed against you weapons will be formed against you weapons going to form against you but we have the promise the weapons will form surely the weapons will form the weapons will form but they won't prosper so don't think I became a Christian and that is all if you think you were a Christian and he still don't take the authority of Jesus Christ serious then when the Devils form a weapon against you he's going to get you because said that our adversary the devil is going around as a roaring lion seeking who he may divor and the devil is not after who are for him it's not after who are for him or those who are for him but after me and you who have decided to follow Jesus Christ and that the reason why we need to still close to Jesus so that we don't give the devil any opportunity to strike you know each and every day he just putting in strategies and plans just the devil is just putting plans and strategies plans and what you can do to get me and you out of the way of God and I know whatever is happening he said the devil is the ruler of this world and know whatever the order of the word is moving is moving according to his Direction but let us not forget the signs and the times we are [Music] in so that we will not forget ourself who we are and and what God has made us of so that we all the time hold onto the name of the Lord now people somebody is thinking right now you have told us that we've wrestle not against flesh and blood we have told us that we wrestle not against flesh and blood so now how can we overcome how can we win the battle against the devil all that you need to yes follow Jesus Christ command I want us to open our Bible back to Isaiah Ephesians chapter 6 verse2 to look at how we are going to prepare oursel for the battle and weapons we need to use so in a battle you don't all that time defend in a battle you don't all the time defend you don't all the time defend you defend and offend or you defend and you attack [Music] sometimes so sometimes the way you are living your life could be an attack to the kingdom of go the devil to the kingdom of the devil you need to know the kind of weapon you need to put on for this batt now I want I want to start from the verse 12 again for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against wickedness in high places verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God take the whole Armon of God you know don't say this word that I'm going this word that I'm going no I'm not going to take my safety vest you know I want to go like that what if an enemy shoot an arrow or a gun towards your chest we need to take the whole Ammon of God it is the whole Ammon of God it is not some it is everything it's everything and he say if a man will surrend everything to God and let God take control over his life then you will see how powerful that man will be that ye may be able to withand in the evil day yeah verse 13 and having done all to stand that means in the battle there is an evil day there is an EV an evil day evil you might be attacking the devil but one day one of the bullet might be directed towards you that is what and cover your whole body not part the whole body stand therefore verse 14 stand therefore having your Lo G about with truth so as Christian I would say your belt should be truth so in your work places in in your schools in your homes in your neighborhood you should be known as the person who speak the truth it should be your nature that you can't help it than to speak the truth and everybody knows if it was said by this person then that is the truth because that person says nothing apart from the truth so that is one of the that we need is to get our LS with a belt of Truth and having the breast spit of righteousness what you are going to cover your chest what you are going to cover your chest should be should be righteousness so in your neighborhood at your work places at your work places work places work your schools your home you should live a life that people said indeed indeed this is a follower of Jesus Christ you know you don't by the life the life you know when Apostles go to the Antioch it wasn't their teaching that God them the name Christians and said and the people live alive and the people of Antioch look onto them and said these people live like R and because of that we call them Christians so if we claim we are also Christians then we need to live like I and that is one of the our weapon to cover our breastplates and your feet sh with the preparation of the gospel of peace that is verse 15 [Music] we are covering you know there are some people immediately Vis visit with you trouble when iMed [Music] visit they come with trouble some people when they visit you they just come with trouble yeah but some people you don't want them to leave your presence you want to stay around them because you feel that inner peace within you you want to be that person that when people are in the street they want to speak to they want to talk to because they know if they are able to speak to you because they know if they are able to speak to you you are going to speak for peace to rain in their heart I'm still verse 16 he said above all take the shade of Faith so after wearing your weapon after wearing your weapon you know you see sometimes SW or maybe the police they will go with some shield to protect shield and he said we need to a shield we need a shield because some arrows are going to be F towards you and those arrows cannot be with stand by the vest so you need a shield and that Shield that sh is Faith you have to you get to the point where the doctor will tell you where the doctor is going to tell you with this your sickness you are going to die and you're going to tell the doctor is true everything is failing it's true everything is failing but I believe in God who is the Healer sometimes there will be challenging m there will be challenging moment no money in the house the children are sick the children are sick rare confused R worried R troubled the devil is going to throw this at you but you need a shield of Faith you need a shi of Faith to make the confession that job made that I know my Redeemer liveed I know God is alive I know God is going to deliver me through the devil is going to thr that at you the devil is going to throw that at you when you are batted shuted worried you don't know what to do you are confused you need a shield of Faith to believe God is not dead to believe God is alive to believe that Jesus Christ died on Calvary for you you need Faith to believe in things that men thought is impossible when the doctor say you can't give birth when the doctor say you can't give birth you can't give birth and they say you have no womb womb you don't have any womb to carry a child then I you tell the doctor is true I don't have a womb but I have a faith that the god that let Sarah to give birth at 90 years is Not Dead by alive you need faith in the most challenging moment in in the moment you are facing trouble you don't need worry you just need Faith believe in God pray unto God talk unto God that oh Lord I've worshiped you you know Hezekiah Hezekiah Hezekiah was a king King Hezekiah no zakar King [Applause] Hezekiah Hezekiah is just a name this king one God told the prophet Isaiah go tell Hezekiah go tell Hezekiah go tell Hezekiah that your time is up and you are about to die you know if you have been told you about to die you would have been good because you know you would die very soon but this Hezekiah wasn't worried but he turned the wall as scripture said he tend to face the wall yeah and unto the Lord oh Lord You Are The Giver of Life and oh God remember me for how well I have served you God remember me for how well I have served you and he cried unto the Lord and God remembered Hezekiah and had 15 years to his age that God that God is not dead he's still alive he still alive God is not down with a Miracle business God is not down with a miracle business God is not down with a miracle business God is not down with doing Miracles yeah God is still doing Miracles he said the Bible said in Hebrews he the same yesterday today for forever for NE he can do it for you all that he needs to believe with faith that God can do it I'm wherefore you shall be able to qu all the fear D of the wicked I'm vers 16 yeah so in your distressful moment you need Faith just to believe in God that God is the best person you have to talk to I didn't say it's about to talk to a brother about it I didn't say it's about to talk to a brother about it or sister about it it's fine but you have to make sure you made a decision because God spoke to you I'm reading verse 17 and take the helment of Salvation no they have to you have to we something to protect your head and that is your salvation you you don't have to joke with your salvation you don't have to joke with your salvation joke you know some people some some some people say oh Jesus said when Jesus died all were saved that is fine when Jesus died on the cross we were saved even Apostle Paul said we are saved by faith through Grace we are saved by faith through Grace but it is work work we do in appreciation that we have accept the Salvation that was purchased on the cross so yeah the Salvation is there but remember a pardon remember a pardon a pardon yeah yeah it's not a pardon until the person the pardon has been written it onto has accepted it as a pardon so you can't be in trouble right now and you are supposed to be sented to death and the president of the United States can take any [Music] seat yeah yeah and just say oh pardon this so so and so don't kill the person and he give to his commanders to bring unto you and tell you whenever they come just show them that you have been pardoned you have excuse of the debt the pardon is there and you can have the pardon with you or some people will not accept the pardon somebody say the president would have come himself someone someone will take the pardon somebody will take it and look at it what I have done can this she save my life know I'm facing dead panity I'm facing death penalty death penalty if the person has something to do he would have come in person no it can be with you it can be with you it can be in your pocket is good you have the pardon but if they come to kill you if they come to kill you and you don't show the pardon to the person come to execute you the pardon is nothing the pardon is nothing so if you can claim to be a Christian Christ died for you all right but if you don't accept it it's nothing but to accept the pardon is to live a life like Christ it is the only way can accept the pardon that Jesus has provided and so on and the sword of the spirit there vers 17 which is the word of [Music] God so so we Christians we also have a sword we also have an Ammon to attack the devil but this Ammon is the word of God sometimes somebody could be distressed and in that distressful moment maybe he just possessed with the devil you just need to speak the word of God onto the person just some small word that God is with you just some small word of encouragement to break that person from the bond is in break yeah from the bondage that person is in the bondage [Music] yeah so our attacking weapon is the word of God the only weapon that we have to attack the enemy is the word of God and just to do speak the word of God to your friend the last time I told you about this popular man I'm forgetting his name again but I [Music] remember Billy Graham he was a friend that invited him to a church so your friends out there the friends out there just need an invitation sometime to share sometime they just need you to whisper Jesus in their ears maybe that is all you will do but you don't know the impact you will do for Generations Verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there so as I end today I want you to understand that we are in a battle and in this battle this is how we are supposed to go about it no somebody will say my brother maybe you don't trouble I'm going through what I'm going through I'm in very serious moment I'm in very serious moment and you know what is happening to me you don't understand my brother I don't need to understand but there is a man who the distress the challenges that you are going through and he can I canot help you several times I can't do anything to help you and that man is not here of you Jesus is here because of you you know Jesus is not here because of the pastor is here because the pastor is here he here Jesus for you Jesus or God is for some selected people is here you are the reason that God is here and God is ready to have fellowship with you God is waiting to talk with you God is waiting I don't know the in your lives I don't know the storms in your life I don't know the trouble you are going through but I know the man who speak to the storm but I know the man who speak to the storm to come down the man that was able to hear the man at Gad that was able to hear the man at gadar so there was this man possessed with demons at G it's a city like abuki is the name of a city like the the man who was able to heal the man at G that same man that same man is here for you is here for me don't think that is for everybody Jesus is here for you so my brother my sister I don't know your challenges maybe you think you might not you can't come out of this trouble you are going through or what you are struggling what you are struggling with you can't deal with it but I'm telling you Jesus is here for you God is here for you I don't know what you are worried about I don't know what you are thinking about I don't know who you are afraid afraid of but speak to Jesus Christ just talk to Jesus Christ he's here because of you know I want you to understand God is here for you it's not is for you that you could be me or the brother sister s l and God is here to deal with all our troubles you know often times we wonder too much we worry too

the dead he wake a man from the dead how much you have life in your hands how much more you can breathe God is here for you you just need to talk to him you just need to speak to him I don't know what you might be going through I don't know the bondage the devil must put you into but if God is here and if you are going to accept God and if you are going to speak God God is going to change your life
