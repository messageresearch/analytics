[1:24] there's so much to share questions
[1:31] because we can connect scripture with
[1:34] scripture
[1:40] we can even understand the the teaching
[1:44] on baptism
[1:47] many maybe we're raised in the apostolic
[1:51] or Pentecostal churches
[1:56] Jesus only movements
[1:59] and of course they baptize in the name

[3:13] true

[3:36] to bring them up
