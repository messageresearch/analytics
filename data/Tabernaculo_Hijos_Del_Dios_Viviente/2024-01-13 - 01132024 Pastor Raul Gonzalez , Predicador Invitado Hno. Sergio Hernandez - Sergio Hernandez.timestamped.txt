[8:54] lasas um but uh so I I'm looking for for
[8:58] what the the the um mberry tree is or
[9:03] the tree
[9:07] is I I found this
[9:12] article about a person
[9:21] has
[9:24] tree mberry so remember Jesus when Jesus
[9:28] said when
[9:30] if you have f as a grain of mustard
[9:34] seed you might say to
[9:38] this he's talking about a mberry
[9:44] tree then Jesus would say you could say
[9:47] to this berry
[9:52] tree be pluck up by the
[9:56] root and be plant in the sea
[10:01] and he should oby
[10:04] you now what is a mberry
[10:08] tree a a mberry tree is an invasive
[10:15] plant
[10:17] inv it's uh uh uh
[10:22] blackberries Las moras they grow really
[10:25] fast but they they grow uh they can grow
[10:30] 20 20 feet
[10:33] tall but also the roots grow very
[10:41] fast so let me just read this article
[10:46] okay like why you reading this
[10:49] article brother Bram one day he was in
[10:53] waiting I think for the train or
[10:56] something he read that the comic part of
[10:59] the
[11:03] newspaper and in it there was a story
[11:06] about some
[11:09] chickens and in the chicken pan there
[11:12] was a a rooster who taught himself to be
[11:15] very
[11:19] intelligent and he knew how to
[11:24] read and one morning that
[11:27] rooster he read he read in the
[11:33] newspaper that the volum of the chickens
[11:36] had
[11:39] increased and he was very
[11:43] happy said come here everybody gather up
[11:46] gather
[11:48] up see what the newspaper says all value
[11:53] has
[11:56] increased what do you think was going to
[11:58] happen to the chicken
[12:02] now the farm knew he was going to make
[12:04] some more money
[12:08] right Hallelujah so let me read this
[12:13] article
[12:16] question my 15year old mberry tree
[12:19] provides wonderful shade in the
[12:25] summer but it is growing into power line
[12:29] and my neighbor says his roots are
[12:32] damaging her underground sprinkler
[12:44] system uh R
[12:47] subterraneo so there was a problem so it
[12:50] was growing up but it was growing
[12:57] down
[13:00] can I can I prune the roots to keep them
[13:04] out
[13:11] Garden should I replace a
[13:15] tree and the lady's name is Sandra
[13:20] Todd from California
[13:25] California
[13:26] wow the answer
[13:29] so just remember we're talking about
[13:35] the and the reason I I got interested in
[13:40] this is because every time you read a
[13:43] Bible
[13:46] verse you cannot just stay with that
[13:48] Bible
[13:52] verse you have to go at least you know
[13:55] three four verses up and three four
[13:57] verses down
[14:03] so you'll be able to understand what
[14:05] that verse is
[14:09] saying otherwise you won't be able to
[14:11] understand
[14:15] it
[14:17] Allelujah Look what Jesus says before he
[14:20] goes before verse six
[14:24] [Music]
[14:27] me verse one Jesus says it's impossible
[14:32] for the offense to come or for the
[14:35] offense not to
[14:40] come so the first thing that Jesus is
[14:42] telling
[14:44] us the offense will
[14:50] come number
[14:52] one do you understand
[14:55] that the offense will come offense
[15:01] who will be your
[15:03] offenser or your offender
[15:09] off look around you it's one of those
[15:13] people that are around
[15:18] you they could offend
[15:22] [Music]
[15:25] you and more than once imagine
[15:30] that person will offend
[15:32] you your husband will offend
[15:36] you your wife will offend
[15:39] you and you will offend
[15:45] someone isn't that what Jesus
[15:49] saying it is impossible but that the
[15:52] offense will
[15:56] come but unto him through they
[16:02] come so yes we will receive
[16:06] offense but why is it well unto
[16:11] him because sometimes we make people
[16:16] [Music]
[16:17] stumble and the problem is not when when
[16:20] we offend the
[16:23] problem the problem is when we are not
[16:26] willing to ask for forgiveness
[16:34] that's where the problem is
[16:38] Allelujah verse
[16:40] three take he
[16:45] yourselves take care of yourself in
[16:47] other
[16:48] words how are you going to take care of
[16:53] yourself Jesus is telling
[16:55] you the offense offense
[17:00] well
[17:03] come it's a it's a
[17:07] warning he's not saying don't worry my
[17:11] child you will never be
[17:15] offended everything is GNA be
[17:18] beautiful beautiful
[17:21] flowerses a beautiful
[17:24] sky the Sun is going to be shining all
[17:29] [Applause]
[17:30] everything is going to be beautiful you
[17:33] will never be
[17:35] hurt that's not what Jesus
[17:38] said Jesus is
[17:40] saying the
[17:42] offense
[17:48] welcome but he's also warning
[17:51] us take care of yourself quitness say
[17:57] protect you
[17:59] yourself that's what that's what saying
[18:01] in um verse three take heed of yourself
[18:04] to
[18:07] yourself how are you gonna protect
[18:09] yourself from the
[18:13] offense you want to know the
[18:16] answer how can I get protected from the
[18:19] offense well the answer is right there
[18:22] but we go too fast we don't understand
[18:27] it
[18:28] verse three if your brother trespasses
[18:32] against
[18:34] [Music]
[18:36] you rebuke
[18:39] him so if your brother does something
[18:42] against
[18:44] you don't go around the
[18:48] church telling everybody about what the
[18:50] brother did to
[18:53] you even if he a brother from another
[18:57] church
[18:58] Jesus
[19:00] says if that brother if that
[19:04] sister offends
[19:06] you rebuke him rebuke
[19:13] her that's
[19:15] biblical you go to that
[19:18] brother you go to that
[19:20] sister of course if you're a
[19:23] brother don't go to that
[19:26] sister take take your wife with
[19:29] you take the pastor with
[19:32] you if you're a sister don't go to that
[19:36] brother take your husband with
[19:39] you take the pastor with
[19:42] you that brother that
[19:45] sister they need to know that they
[19:48] offended
[19:51] you you know what I
[19:54] mean that's how you protect yourself but
[19:57] that's not that's not
[19:59] Jesus is not saying
[20:05] going you offended me you're guilty and
[20:07] you go to hell that's not what Jesus is
[20:09] saying at
[20:10] all you're going to tell the brother you
[20:13] offended me what by by what you said or
[20:15] what you
[20:19] did let's continue verse
[20:22] three and if he repents forgive him
[20:37] how is that how can I protect what
[20:41] that's not protecting
[20:42] [Music]
[20:45] myself that's you mean to tell me that I
[20:49] have to forgive
[20:51] you that's what Jesus is
[20:55] saying the way to protect
[21:01] yourself from the
[21:05] offense it's by
[21:11] forgiving why see because when you
[21:14] forgive
[21:16] someone you no longer have that
[21:22] load
[21:26] Hallelujah verse four look Jesus goes
[21:29] even beyond
[21:32] that and if he trespasses against you
[21:35] seven times in a
[21:41] day
[21:43] what and seven times and seven times a
[21:46] day he turns again to you saying I
[21:53] Repent you shall forgive
[21:57] him
[22:01] you shall forgive
[22:05] him is that hard to
[22:10] do if you say that's easy that you're
[22:13] lying but what we're preaching tonight
[22:15] is hard to
[22:20] do amen
[22:25] amen God WR the verse five it says the
[22:33] disciples increase our
[22:38] faith they're telling Jesus increase our
[22:41] faith for what what
[22:46] for to do
[22:51] what to
[22:53] forgive increase our faith to forgive
[22:59] that's
[23:01] hard but not
[23:03] impossible it's
[23:08] Theos that's the
[23:10] difference
[23:12] amen that's why Jesus said in
[23:17] verse
[23:21] you you can say to this
[23:26] m
[23:29] be plug up from the
[23:32] roots and be plant into the
[23:35] sea and he should be and he should obey
[23:43] you so what is
[23:46] [Music]
[23:50] the what is what does it
[23:55] represent somebody can tell me
[24:01] what does a mry
[24:13] represent he's talking about
[24:19] Roots roots of
[24:23] bitterness when we don't forgive someone
[24:26] when we don't have the power to forgive
[24:34] someone then that little seed of
[24:43] bitterness how many of you have seen a
[24:47] seed and how it begins to spring
[24:51] up the first thing that any seed
[24:56] grows it's a
[25:02] root so before we go to the
[25:06] article let's go to the book of
[25:11] Hebrews
[25:13] Hallelujah Hebrews chapter
[25:18] 12 so remember
[25:20] this Hebrews chapter 12 remember
[25:24] remember
[25:26] this the only way to protect yourself
[25:29] against an
[25:34] offense it's by forgiving the other
[25:42] person that's Jesus is not brother
[25:46] saying it is not me saying it who is
[25:50] saying
[25:56] it God on Earth
[25:59] Earth he said to
[26:03] us to protect yourself from an
[26:10] offense you have to forgive the other
[26:17] person verse uh 14 of Hebrews
[26:25] 12 follow peace with
[26:29] men and
[26:33] Holiness without which no one shall see
[26:35] the
[26:38] Lord looking diligently lest any man
[26:41] fail of the grace of
[26:48] God so some people may fail to reach
[26:52] God's
[26:56] grace
[26:58] and thereby um well I'm sorry let's
[27:01] let's go back F of God's grace lest any
[27:05] root of bitterness is springing up
[27:08] trouble you and thereby many be
[27:19] defiled so you see what what Jesus is
[27:21] telling
[27:22] us Jesus is telling us you need to have
[27:25] faith to forgive
[27:28] because you don't want those
[27:30] roots because once those roots grow in
[27:34] they're going to find the ground and
[27:37] they GNA they going to go inside the
[27:39] ground they're going to root
[27:51] themselves verse 16 let there be any
[27:54] fornicator or profane person as Esau who
[27:59] for one Mar of meat sold his
[28:10] Birthright for you know how that
[28:13] afterward when he would have inherit the
[28:15] blessing he
[28:18] was rejected for he found a place of
[28:22] repentance though he saw it carefully
[28:24] with
[28:26] tears
[28:38] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[28:41] Lord so now we're getting
[28:48] somewhere the mber tree let's go back to
[28:52] the mberry tree so this
[28:56] lady Miss
[28:58] Sandra Sandra she didn't know we were
[29:00] going to be talking about her
[29:05] tonight but we want to ask her for
[29:09] forgiveness but learn
[29:12] this if you put something
[29:16] online it's for the public to see
[29:21] it and anybody can use
[29:25] it unless you put in
[29:30] this is only for my followers or my
[29:35] friends and no one has the right to copy
[29:39] these but she didn't write
[29:42] that that's what that's why I'm talking
[29:44] about
[29:47] this look look at the
[29:50] answer so she has a mry
[29:55] tree tree
[29:59] and is growing and touching the electric
[30:04] lines but it's also touching the
[30:06] sprinkler system of the
[30:13] neighbor so she's in
[30:15] troubles
[30:17] problemas the answer that the gardener
[30:20] give
[30:22] her and I like this because one day a
[30:26] little woman in
[30:29] she was looking for
[30:35] Jesus and she saw a
[30:40] gardener and she asked the gardener
[30:42] where do you play the
[30:48] master and he he turned
[30:51] around and she he said
[30:53] Mary
[30:55] Maria and she recognized that
[31:01] Gardener and she call him
[31:06] ronon which means
[31:09] Maestro
[31:11] Master
[31:12] Maestro the answer here B diplomacy
[31:16] between neighbors is always
[31:23] delicate yeah the neighbor has flowers
[31:25] you want to have flowers too
[31:30] right the neighbor plants a tree you
[31:32] always want to plant a
[31:35] tree right the neighbor has a beautiful
[31:41] yard you want it better
[31:47] amen it's always diplomacy and is
[31:50] delicate diploma
[31:52] isic and in this case the responsibility
[31:55] to resolve the problem Falls on both
[32:01] [Music]
[32:04] parties so we're talking about an
[32:08] offenser
[32:10] offens and an offended person you
[32:16] know please think it in the
[32:22] spiritual
[32:26] okay mble Roots didn't cause the
[32:32] problem at least not at
[32:37] first it is physically impossible for
[32:40] roots to enter or puncture pipes to
[32:43] reach the
[32:49] water but they will follow the leaking
[32:52] water to its Sur and then squeeze
[32:55] through even the smallest hole or
[33:07] crack somewhere somehow her neighbor's
[33:10] sprinkler system must have sprung a
[33:22] leak
[33:25] Hallelujah
[33:28] attacking the M roots of the house next
[33:30] door to take attracting I'm sorry the
[33:33] leak must attract the M roots of the
[33:36] house next door to take a
[33:53] drink we have to think about this
[33:57] yes how long does it take for the roots
[34:02] of this mberry
[34:09] tree for the roots to go to the
[34:11] neighbor's
[34:16] house 15
[34:20] years that's a long
[34:24] time and he was attracted by the leak of
[34:28] the sprinkler
[34:33] [Music]
[34:53] system he was attracted by the water of
[34:57] a leaking
[35:00] [Music]
[35:02] system it had a little
[35:05] crack and The mberry Roots follow
[35:10] that so what are we talking about we're
[35:14] talking about roots of
[35:18] bitterness roots of bitterness that have
[35:20] grown throughout the
[35:25] years we're talking about roots of
[35:28] bitterness that affect
[35:32] you but also roots of bitterness that
[35:35] affect your
[35:38] neighbor who's your
[35:41] neighbor your brother your
[35:45] sister your father your
[35:50] mother your child too your daughter to
[35:56] your husband
[35:57] toos your wife to your grandchildren
[36:03] to that's are we talking about roots of
[36:10] bitterness they grew in
[36:13] you but now they're trying to look for a
[36:16] little
[36:21] Lick in somebody else's
[36:25] life
[36:29] to get themselves into
[36:43] it look what the what the guy
[36:47] say don't bother trying to cut the roots
[36:50] or dig a trange to put up a concrete or
[36:53] plastic root barrier no
[37:09] why whenever the water is the roots will
[37:11] find
[37:16] it even diving under barrier even diving
[37:21] under barriers up to 4T
[37:24] deep inclus
[37:31] first the sprinkler pipe be fixed they
[37:34] are wasting
[37:41] water thead news for you is that mberry
[37:43] trees should the sad news the sad news
[37:46] for you is that that mberry tree should
[37:48] probably go away but
[37:55] this
[38:00] how you want to fix the
[38:04] problem all of
[38:06] us except the little
[38:09] babies
[38:11] except each one of
[38:14] us has been offended at one point or
[38:22] another it's
[38:24] true and we let that bitterness
[38:31] grow and it's a
[38:39] root grows
[38:41] tall but it grows deep
[38:46] also it affects your
[38:49] life but it also affects the life of
[38:52] those around
[38:55] you
[39:00] how we fix
[39:04] that the guy gave us the answer the
[39:06] gardener gave us the
[39:09] answer how do you fix it by cutting the
[39:14] roots no if you just cut the
[39:19] roots those roots are going to grow
[39:22] again because they're trying to find a
[39:26] place where they can feed themselves
[39:31] from your
[39:34] bitterness my bitterness
[39:37] meura always finds a place where it can
[39:40] feed
[39:47] itself
[39:50] amen now don't
[39:52] think why didn't that sister
[39:55] came was all for
[39:57] her no it was for
[40:01] you forget about anybody
[40:05] else and look inside your
[40:09] life how was
[40:12] affected since as you were a little
[40:15] child and how those roots of bitterness
[40:19] began
[40:20] to just grow in
[40:25] you and many times we don't even
[40:30] realize but we are feeding that
[40:37] bitterness you know we're feeding
[40:39] it instead of forgiving and we go back
[40:45] and we try to be the
[40:49] winners well he's not going to win this
[40:53] argument she's not going to win this
[40:56] argument
[40:58] Jesus did not say when the
[41:01] argument Jesus said
[41:09] forgive
[41:13] amen you know Jesus says to
[41:16] forgive if they come and ask for
[41:19] forgiveness
[41:22] because but what if they don't for what
[41:25] if they don't want to ask for
[41:30] forgiveness are you going to keep that
[41:32] root
[41:37] there then you must
[41:40] forgive even if they don't ask you for
[41:49] forgiveness see the guy says the
[41:52] gardener
[41:53] says you have to cut the whole
[41:58] tree from the
[42:00] roots and get get rid of
[42:05] it amen
[42:09] amen my wife asked me to to cut two
[42:12] trees in my
[42:15] house she didn't like
[42:18] them of course be
[42:23] myself I have a I have a I have an elect
[42:29] the trees were not big and the the the
[42:33] trunk was this
[42:37] thck so when my wife didn't look hi so
[42:41] when my wife didn't
[42:43] look I just went to the bottom of the
[42:48] ground and I caught from the
[42:55] trunk
[42:57] why because I want the
[43:03] trees so the minute this the minute
[43:05] spring comes
[43:07] back I'm wna grab the trees and put them
[43:09] somewhere
[43:11] else maybe I should do that right
[43:14] now when it's you know winter so they
[43:18] can go grow somewhere
[43:20] else that's that's what we do
[43:23] but we try to act like we don't have
[43:33] we only cut the
[43:38] trunk I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free I'm
[43:42] so glad Jesus set me
[43:48] free
[43:50] right now you have to cut it from The
[43:54] Roots there's the
[43:57] [Applause]
[43:59] [Music]
[44:05] something to dig it
[44:07] down dig it all the way
[44:12] down and cut it from The
[44:19] Roots look at look at what brother
[44:24] says hallelujah
[44:34] 6:35 but if you just try to do
[44:40] it you're going to
[44:45] fail that's what a lot of a lot of times
[44:48] we've been doing we're trying to get rid
[44:49] of the bitterness by
[44:54] ourselves
[44:58] and brother says you're G to
[45:03] fail and you got to
[45:11] fail
[45:12] why because you cannot do it by
[45:16] yourself you see when people have
[45:19] bitterness it grows into a lot of other
[45:24] issues and a lot of a lot of people when
[45:28] when when they cannot deal with that
[45:33] bitterness they go to the
[45:36] psychiatrist go to
[45:39] psychologist they give you
[45:42] pills but
[45:44] the the only thing that is
[45:48] doing is cutting is cutting your
[45:51] bitterness from the
[45:54] trunk
[45:59] the only way that bitterness can be cut
[46:02] from The Roots
[46:06] the is by surrendering it to

[46:20] anymore
[46:23] do but I'm tired of in this tree in my
[46:30] [Music]

[52:20] weaker but you didn't kill
[52:24] it in order to kill that
[52:29] illness you gotta finish the whole

[53:06] weaker but you know what
[53:09] happens with an
[53:13] infection when you only take half of the
[53:19] medication when you only take two qu of
[53:22] the
[53:24] medication
[53:26] the only thing you did was the only
[53:29] thing you
[53:30] did you got that
[53:37] infection but that infection is gonna
[53:39] create more
[53:42] babies and those
[53:44] babies when they
[53:48] grow in their DNA that's how demonic
[53:52] this
[53:53] is in their
[53:57] DNA they create a
[54:01] defense against the medication that you
[54:03] were
[54:08] taking why it's G to
[54:12] happen maybe not tomorrow maybe not not
[54:16] in a
[54:18] week but
[54:20] later your condition is going to get
[54:23] worse than what it was before to
[54:30] he said well I have faith brother
[54:34] Sergio if you really had
[54:39] Fai you never would have gone to that
[54:42] doctor you would have come to letter the
[54:45] pastor and ask him to pray for

[54:56] take the whole
[55:01] regimen take the whole
[55:04] Bott one pill
[55:08] day if it's two take two
[55:12] Tom because that's the only way you're
[55:15] going to destroy
[55:17] that we talking about root of
[55:22] bitterness the only way to destroy it
[55:26] is to keep
[55:29] coming because for this root of
[55:33] bitterness a little pill is not gonna
[55:35] kill
[55:38] it you need to have
[55:42] antibotics to destroy that R of
[55:46] bitterness but it has to come through an
[55:50] IV to your
[55:53] veins said why you talking about what
[55:56] the church
[55:58] needs
[56:01] Aus from the veins of
[56:08] Emmanuel you keep
[56:10] coming and you keep get a
[56:15] transfusion those roots of bitterness
[56:18] get completely
[56:22] kill hallelujah hallelujah
[56:28] right that a
[56:31] it that isn't
[56:33] it no no it is the holy spirit that
[56:37] comes
[56:43] in so unless you know you have the Holy
[56:48] Ghost you only cutting the roots of
[56:51] bitterness or
[56:53] mberry
[56:55] Morita from the
[56:58] trunk and all of a sudden you see the
[57:01] little
[57:02] brother he came to
[57:04] church he danc in the
[57:08] spirit spok in
[57:10] Tong
[57:12] amen I know the
[57:20] words
[57:23] Hallelujah then all of a sudden you see
[57:25] them in the
[57:26] world and they begin to speak other
[57:33] Tong
[57:35] amen
[57:37] why because that root of bitterness is
[57:41] still there and it's fitting from
[57:48] somewhere when you go home what do you
[57:52] do what do you feed yourself soul
[58:00] with
[58:02] amen he takes the place the Holy Ghost
[58:05] takes a
[58:08] place he takes all that roots of
[58:14] bitterness the old
[58:18] anger the old
[58:21] temper the
[58:23] jealousy
[58:26] and the love of the
[58:28] world and all the
[58:31] things takes it all out of
[58:35] you and then you're a new
[58:41] creature how come on
[58:46] how the only way we can do
[58:49] it is through the Holy
[58:53] Ghost amen dwelling in
[59:00] you you know that God forgives you
[59:05] right how many of you know that God has
[59:07] forgiven
[59:10] you you see but because God forgave
[59:14] you doesn't mean he trusts
[59:20] you you know
[59:23] that read the book of
[59:28] Acts I don't know if it's chapter 4 or
[59:31] chapter
[59:33] 5 but Peter
[59:37] says God gives the Holy
[59:42] Ghost to those who obey
[59:47] him God gives the Holy
[59:51] Ghost to Those whom he trusts
[1:00:00] God forgave you amen God forgave me amen
[1:00:03] the question is can God trust
[1:00:06] me brother was confing
[1:00:09] me

[1:00:15] question cuz he's not going to

[1:00:24] pres of the United
[1:00:28] States what he's placing in

[1:01:08] little
[1:01:09] bit about two hours more and we're
[1:01:15] done 1 Samuel chapter
[1:01:17] 1 un verse
[1:01:23] 9 let's look at people with bitterness
[1:01:25] in the
[1:01:29] Bible did you know that the Bible is
[1:01:32] full of people with
[1:01:39] bitterness let's look at one little
[1:01:43] woman 1 Samuel 1 verse

[1:01:53] another person God's
[1:01:56] willing I want to help you car
[1:01:59] your because sometimes we carry a big
[1:02:05] load and it destroys
[1:02:07] us and then it also destroys everybody
[1:02:10] around
[1:02:14] US 1 Samuel 1
[1:02:18] ver9 says so Hanah rose up after they
[1:02:22] had eaten in Shiloh and after they had
[1:02:24] drunk and Eli the priest sat upon a seat
[1:02:28] by a post of the Temple of the
[1:02:38] Lord and she was in bitterness of soul
[1:02:42] and pray unto the Lord and wept
[1:02:47] sore
[1:02:50] abundant where do you bring your
[1:02:53] bitterness to
[1:02:58] Hanah brought her
[1:03:01] bitterness to the
[1:03:08] Lord the only way we can get rid of that
[1:03:11] root of bitterness is by bringing it to
[1:03:14] the
[1:03:21] Lord
[1:03:22] amen if you you read that
[1:03:27] chapter um her husband had two
[1:03:32] wives one was able to give him
[1:03:36] children and was not able to have
[1:03:42] children so the other
[1:03:44] wife was really mean to to
[1:03:49] Hanah and it was always making her feel

[1:04:56] Eli the
[1:05:00] priest he didn't understand what was
[1:05:03] going
