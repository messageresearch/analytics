[1:02:50] what's up
[1:02:59] God bless you all this morning
[1:03:02] it's good to be once again
[1:03:08] a place that's been dedicated
[1:03:12] to to for worshipers to come
[1:03:24] and we always receive an answer is
[1:03:30] that I've ever asked something of the
[1:03:33] Lord
[1:03:34] whatever it might be
[1:03:37] that I didn't receive an answer
[1:03:40] sometimes the answer was yes
[1:03:43] but sometimes the answer was no yes
[1:03:47] he always answers
[1:03:50] yes yes we see is as good as is
[1:04:18] you may be seated for just a moment
[1:04:23] this morning we have a
[1:04:25] thought we'd like to express
[1:04:30] last night we ministered
[1:04:33] on Perfection and Perfection through a
[1:04:37] restored friendships
[1:04:40] something we've shared with the church
[1:04:43] at home
[1:04:46] but it was a serious services
[1:04:50] oh I don't remember maybe a dozen
[1:04:53] isena of services
[1:04:56] unfolding the Stars
[1:05:00] so to preach it in one service
[1:05:08] but I'm sure the Holy Spirit
[1:05:11] and keep opening it to you
[1:05:14] they're in your closet
[1:05:18] I don't have to worry about delivering
[1:05:21] everything uh
[1:05:25] many times as many as the minister
[1:05:28] brother
[1:06:06] and may it cause you to be a student of
[1:06:10] the world
[1:06:13] and dig deeper
[1:06:18] in that little prayer closet at home
[1:06:28] oh God can really really touch you
[1:06:32] that's true
[1:06:47] and the first thing he said
[1:06:50] I must put this house in order
[1:06:53] he said
[1:06:55] was to be a house
[1:07:12] in order
[1:07:14] he gave an example
[1:07:17] so so the head of every home
[1:07:21] but now we have a greater method
[1:07:26] not with a whip in hand
[1:07:28] but with the love of God in our hearts
[1:07:36] but with the love of God in our hearts
[1:07:47] God
[1:08:04] I began preaching on this thought years
[1:08:07] ago
[1:08:09] I haven't finished it yet
[1:08:11] I don't think I'll ever finish it
[1:08:14] at my age I won't live long enough
[1:08:18] because it's the Eternal Word of God
[1:08:22] but first I want to share with you
[1:08:27] a couple of principles in the Bible
[1:08:31] and I hope that will help you as we
[1:08:33] enter into our thoughts
[1:08:39] that you know well that is
[1:09:00] God speaks
[1:09:03] as a professor behold I will send you
[1:09:06] Elijah the prophet
[1:09:09] before the before the coming of the
[1:09:12] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:09:16] in verse
[1:09:19] he told us what that how Dreadful that
[1:09:21] day would be because
[1:09:26] he's telling us before verse 1 comes to
[1:09:30] pass
[1:09:32] I will do this though I'll send you
[1:09:36] Elijah on the prophets
[1:09:40] he says and he shall turn the heart of
[1:09:43] the fathers to the children
[1:09:48] and the Heart of the children to their
[1:09:50] fathers
[1:09:52] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[1:09:55] curse
[1:09:57] we know now by the grace of God
[1:10:01] that John the Baptist
[1:10:12] and the karma
[1:10:48] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:10:51] to the children
[1:10:54] I made a statement it's John the
[1:10:56] Baptista
[1:11:00] I I that John the Baptist fulfilled this
[1:11:04] part
[1:11:06] I know you are Bible readers
[1:11:09] we won't turn to it I'll just mention it
[1:11:12] you know we are either in Luke chapter
[1:11:15] one Lucas Capital Uno was an elderly
[1:11:18] couple
[1:11:19] Zechariah and Elizabeth
[1:11:22] and they were great in age
[1:11:25] like Abraham and Sarah
[1:11:28] and Elizabeth was Barren Elizabeth
[1:11:31] we have never had children
[1:11:34] and it was when it was humanly
[1:11:37] impossible for her to have them
[1:11:42] but Zechariah a man like Abraham
[1:11:47] despite their age
[1:11:50] still praying he wanted a son
[1:11:55] it was his time as a levite and a priest
[1:12:51] in the middle of the sentence
[1:12:54] and it doesn't matter
[1:12:57] because that was for the first coming
[1:13:00] foreign
[1:13:59] foreign
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:15:31] oh God
[1:16:12] 2000 years
[1:16:17] you know there was a time and you can
[1:16:20] read the quotes
[1:16:22] where brother Branham would say
[1:16:24] now John Was Elijah
[1:16:27] because Jesus told us
[1:16:31] but he wasn't the Elijah of Malachi 4.
[1:16:36] he's the Elijah of Malachi 3.
[1:16:40] and he said that many times
[1:16:45] but in a message I believe it's called
[1:16:48] Messiah foreign
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:08] [Music]
[1:18:12] this is 1961.
[1:18:17] he was given a commission
[1:18:20] to take Christ to the world
[1:18:27] you can do the math
[1:18:29] from 46 to 61.
[1:18:34] he didn't have this Revelation
[1:18:37] he had an opinion opinion but then God
[1:18:40] comes down
[1:18:42] and gives him the Revelation
[1:18:45] you say why being a prophet he wouldn't
[1:18:49] know this
[1:18:51] because God didn't show it
[1:18:56] you see Revelation comes from God
[1:19:07] a housewife
[1:19:12] every one of those
[1:19:14] gets Revelations
[1:19:23] the housewife
[1:19:25] she needs only do what the minister must
[1:19:28] do hey yes
[1:19:47] foreign
[1:20:22] modern events
[1:20:25] made very clear by prophecy it shows
[1:20:30] Revelations 5 1-9
[1:20:34] it was a vision that John was seen
[1:20:38] but this vision
[1:20:40] from the time available of the verse
[1:20:43] from the first verse
[1:20:45] to this day this vision is an active
[1:20:49] Vision
[1:20:51] this Vision has been unfolding for
[1:20:53] almost seven thousand years
[1:21:00] it began in Genesis
[1:21:03] and it still unfolding here this morning
[1:21:08] that's the way God writes his words
[1:21:12] in other words
[1:21:15] you are a part of this Vision
[1:21:18] you are the active
[1:21:22] this vision is history
[1:21:24] some of this Vision John lived through
[1:21:27] it
[1:21:29] some of this visions
[1:21:42] and I saw from the right hand of him
[1:21:44] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:21:47] within and on the backside comma sealed
[1:21:50] with Seven Seals
[1:21:58] I want to read it again and I saw in the
[1:22:02] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:22:04] a book written within and on the
[1:22:07] backside
[1:22:13] sealed with Seven Seals
[1:22:19] you're the author of this book
[1:22:22] this is the Lamb's Book is
[1:22:25] the Lamb of God
[1:22:28] great Holy Spirit
[1:22:31] come down
[1:22:33] and take this open book
[1:22:36] and reveal it to our hearts
[1:22:39] we ask all this in Jesus name
[1:22:43] amen amen
[1:22:53] Revelations five
[1:22:56] is the greatest love story ever told
[1:23:02] from verse 1
[1:23:04] beginning from him that sat on the
[1:23:07] throne
[1:23:09] all the way to a lamb slain
[1:23:14] all the actors in this chapter is
[1:23:17] the same God
[1:23:20] it's the king of glory
[1:23:23] descending down
[1:23:25] changing forms with one purpose in mind
[1:23:32] [Applause]
[1:23:33] the king Rey took off his crown and it
[1:23:39] is in
[1:24:04] a man that could be God's lamb foreign
[1:25:02] foreign
[1:26:10] which was the original scene
[1:26:26] foreign
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:27:23] foreign
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:13] to be close to his children
[1:28:18] so in his mind he said I've got to
[1:28:22] descend lower
[1:28:25] I must get closer to them
[1:28:28] but as Jesus of Nazareth
[1:28:31] John yes could put his head on his
[1:28:34] bosomes the 12 disciples could Embrace
[1:28:38] him
[1:28:39] from time to time
[1:28:45] one or two might touch him
[1:28:48] but but the masses couldn't get close to
[1:28:51] him
[1:28:52] so God changed form again
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:28] foreign
[1:30:28] Genesis back there
[1:30:30] that's 4000 BCS
[1:30:34] so for the sake of sharing this with you
[1:30:39] Genesis is 4000 BC is
[1:30:44] Revelations
[1:30:47] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:30:50] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:30:53] and on the back side
[1:31:00] that makes it sound like there's
[1:31:03] something written within
[1:31:06] and there's something on the back side
[1:31:09] then after the karma it says
[1:31:18] and a prophet that like you and I read
[1:31:21] it
[1:31:23] and from now
[1:31:26] to just a day before he preached the
[1:31:29] bridge
[1:31:33] many times he gave us his opinion and
[1:31:36] told us
[1:31:38] that there's something written within
[1:31:41] but there's something written on the
[1:31:43] outside
[1:31:46] he he mentioned that he caught seven
[1:31:49] Thunders
[1:31:53] was the Seven Seals that are on the back
[1:31:57] side
[1:31:58] there were seven seals
[1:32:01] when he preached the bridge
[1:32:05] that series of opening of the revelation
[1:32:09] of the Seven Seals yes
[1:32:12] he said no
[1:32:14] he said seven Thunders
[1:32:16] is not Seven Seals and there's nothing
[1:32:20] written on the outside of the book
[1:32:23] The Lord
[1:32:26] that he can't do that
[1:32:28] everything must be in the word
[1:32:32] everything must be in Christ
[1:32:35] yet for 10 years he expressed his
[1:32:38] opinion
[1:32:41] and for 10 years men take those quotes
[1:32:44] and put a period on it
[1:32:46] period
[1:32:53] s and all they have to do is
[1:33:00] continue opening the books
[1:33:04] you say why would God allow that to
[1:33:07] happen
[1:33:09] so you could hide it from the eyes of
[1:33:11] the wise and Prudence is
[1:33:31] that was the prophet's advice
[1:33:39] you reduce God to a very small dog
[1:33:51] he's bigger than this in this building
[1:33:54] it is
[1:33:56] bigger than this world
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:03] yet he wants to live in your heart
[1:34:12] back to Eden
[1:34:15] that day in Genesis
[1:34:18] 321
[1:34:20] where the father is dressing Adam and
[1:34:23] Eve
[1:34:30] so Revelation 5 1.
[1:34:33] begins about 4 000 BC is
[1:34:38] it was a vision of that day in Egypt
[1:34:42] when Adam and Eve were put out of the
[1:34:44] presence of the father foreign
[1:34:56] it's found in the message Souls that are
[1:34:59] in prison now
[1:35:02] and it's in English it's paragraph 139
[1:35:07] and the prophet says
[1:35:09] but you see in this book
[1:35:12] was what was redeemed
[1:35:16] it was the book of redemption and
[1:35:19] everything that he had redeemed was
[1:35:21] written in this book
[1:35:25] all that he died for was written in the
[1:35:28] book
[1:35:30] and he could not leave his military seat
[1:35:33] until he had thoroughly redeemed
[1:35:39] at the cross
[1:35:42] because they were predestinated in the
[1:35:45] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:48] and he had to stay the room again
[1:35:51] recession
[1:35:53] until the last person was finished
[1:35:56] foreign
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:14] God Almighty and John looked around and
[1:36:17] he wept
[1:36:19] is
[1:36:22] because there was no man even worthy to
[1:36:25] look on the book okay
[1:36:31] those seven parts
[1:36:33] of one divine plan
[1:36:38] thank you from time and to Eternity
[1:37:08] mystery of it
[1:37:10] and it was the book of redemption he
[1:37:13] says the new testamento
[1:38:04] and it had been lost by the human race
[1:38:49] Revelations
[1:38:53] [Applause]
[1:38:55] and he's looking back to Eden
[1:38:59] now we know that the Book of Genesis
[1:39:03] was written by Moses
[1:39:07] by Vision just like John saw this book
[1:39:12] of Revelations
[1:39:16] foreign
[1:39:25] you see when God created the heavens and
[1:39:28] the Earth
[1:39:30] Moses wasn't even born yet
[1:39:34] he wouldn't be born
[1:39:38] 24
[1:39:42] news and look at the detail he spoke
[1:39:48] on the writing of the Book of Genesis
[1:39:52] why because he was seeing it
[1:39:56] and he was hearing it he was healing God
[1:40:00] speak to us
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:23] just like it happened that day
[1:40:28] foreign
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:42:32] in the right hand of him
[1:42:42] wouldn't that be a throne is in heaven
[1:42:47] so this was Eden what Throne was this
[1:42:52] it was the throne in Genesis
[1:43:08] he says I hid myself
[1:43:13] because I was naked
[1:43:17] okay
[1:43:18] he said who told you you were naked
[1:43:22] the woman I
[1:43:26] don't remember asking for her you just
[1:43:28] gave her to me
[1:43:31] right away
[1:43:32] he throws the blame on someone else
[1:43:48] you know the one that you made
[1:43:53] and God sets a judgment Throne
[1:43:58] that's the Throne of Revelations
[1:44:28] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:45:17] we could say it's grammatically correct
[1:45:20] foreign
[1:45:35] and a prophet when he preached the
[1:45:36] bridge
[1:45:38] he said there's nothing on the back side
[1:45:43] he says seven Thunders is not Seven
[1:45:45] Seals
[1:45:47] and the Holy Spirit yes
[1:46:12] from the right hand of him that sat on
[1:46:15] the throne a book written Within is
[1:46:26] Seven Seals
[1:46:29] right wrong and I saw on the right hand
[1:46:31] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:46:34] within comma is
[1:46:43] Seven Seals
[1:46:45] and when he preached the first seal
[1:46:49] it takes and he rolls up a paper
[1:46:53] he said they didn't have books like we
[1:46:55] have today
[1:46:57] it was a scroll and what was written
[1:47:04] and the scroll that the word speaks of
[1:47:06] here
[1:47:11] that means they would take a leather
[1:47:14] strap
[1:47:17] they would tie it with something
[1:47:20] and then they would pour wax on them
[1:47:29] Italian
[1:47:48] and that person he's a person alone has
[1:47:51] the authority
[1:47:59] your message what was written inside
[1:48:01] yeah
[1:48:14] for years thinking something was on the
[1:48:17] back side
[1:48:19] the Holy Spirit
[1:48:24] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:48:28] sat on the throne
[1:48:31] written
[1:48:35] and on the back side those Scrolls were
[1:48:39] sealed over Seven Seals
[1:48:44] counting from the birth of Christ
[1:48:48] original
[1:49:17] here in chapter five
[1:49:20] is is God descending
[1:49:23] change in forms he's got one purpose
[1:49:29] to get closer to his seat
[1:49:32] get closer to his children
[1:49:35] to get closer from you
[1:49:38] has been the thought in his mind
[1:49:41] ever since his children
[1:49:46] come on now from Genesis to Revelations
[1:49:50] apocalypsies angels are mentioned
[1:49:53] in Exodus

[1:49:57] of the Angel of the Covenant the strong
[1:50:01] Angels who alone will choose who is
[1:50:04] worthy
[1:50:08] to open the book Revelations
[1:50:16] and I saw a strong Angel clo came into
[1:50:19] my name without voice
[1:50:26] and to lose the seals thereof it is
[1:50:33] in verse 2.

[1:50:45] to the year 1446.

[1:52:20] apocalypse is and I saw a strong angel
[1:52:23] proclaiming with a loud voice

[1:52:29] loose the seals around
[1:52:33] it's the king is
[1:52:36] descended from Glory
[1:52:39] he's coming down lower because he wants
[1:52:42] to get closer to his children
[1:52:48] we fast forward to the year 1446.
[1:52:56] the angel of the Covenant
[1:52:59] Israel the angel of the Covenant was
[1:53:03] looking for a worthy one
[1:53:05] for four thousand years
[1:53:07] from Genesis
[1:53:16] Revelations

[1:54:48] Revelations 5 4.
[1:54:51] and it says and I wept much
[1:54:54] because no man was found worthy
[1:55:00] and to read the book
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:06] not only it was a strong Angel leading
[1:55:09] Israel out of Egypt
[1:55:12] he was also looking for a man who was
[1:55:15] worthy
[1:55:17] it had to be a Kinsmen
[1:55:19] because that was the law of God
[1:55:23] redemptions
[1:55:50] there was a Kinsman to redeem them
[1:55:55] and the angel of the Covenant
[1:55:59] was keeping to his words
[1:56:59] experience
[1:57:14] men and women
[1:57:33] and when no one was found worthy
[1:57:36] then God descended a little lower
[1:57:54] it says for thou has made him a little
[1:57:57] lower than the angels
[1:58:01] and has crowned him with glory and honor
[1:58:04] is
[1:58:06] him to have dominion over the works of

[1:59:29] the king of glory
[1:59:30] great Supreme Spirit God
[1:59:34] that is
[1:59:40] so he created a body
[1:59:43] without spot or wrinkles who could
[1:59:46] suffer death
[1:59:47] Paul said crowned with glory and
[1:59:52] honored he by the grace of God
[1:59:55] should taste death

[2:02:49] the root of David we have prevailed to

[2:04:54] that day is
[2:04:56] the ministry of Jesus
[2:05:00] Revelations

[2:21:05] and how he hides things from the eyes of
[2:21:08] the wise and prudence
[2:21:11] and reveal it to a little group
[2:21:15] to whom he will increase by Revelation
[2:21:21] rapturing faith

[2:23:48] I know the Bible says no man knoweth
[2:23:51] when he's coming
[2:23:54] but could it be possible he'll let us
[2:23:57] know what he's done
[2:24:05] Revelations 5 7.

[2:24:24] we're now in the 20th century
[2:24:29] he took the book
[2:24:31] it's February the 28th 1963.
[2:24:39] as you know that's where it was opened
[2:24:43] on the Revelation revelation of the
[2:24:47] greatest love story
[2:24:49] was being revealed
[2:24:52] you say how do you know he was opened on
[2:24:56] Sunset mountains
[2:24:59] the invisible Union of the bride of
[2:25:02] Christ
[2:25:09] 1965.
[2:25:11] 30 more days and God will take his
[2:25:13] Prophet off the Earth
[2:25:22] says and the Seven Seals of God
[2:25:26] when it was opened
[2:25:30] yes
[2:25:52] and I foretold you a year and six months
[2:25:56] before it happened
[2:25:59] he said go to Arizona and what would
[2:26:03] happen out there in the desert
[2:26:05] men sitting right here
[2:26:08] standing right there in prison
[2:26:12] when the seven angels came down
[2:26:24] and they don't even know what it's all
[2:26:26] about it
[2:26:32] yes
[2:26:39] Revelations
[2:26:46] again it's repeating
[2:26:49] is he just repeating himself
[2:26:52] oh there's something else
[2:27:23] and when he had taken the book
[2:27:27] I thought he'd already took the book
[2:27:30] in verse 7
[2:27:32] he came and took the book
[2:27:36] that happened on Sunset
[2:27:41] and when he had taken the
[2:27:46] books
[2:27:54] every one of them Harps and golden vials
[2:28:01] which are the prayers of the Saints
[2:28:05] Revelations 5 8
[2:28:08] repeats again that he had taken the book
[2:28:12] because it's
[2:28:16] March 17th 1963.
[2:28:23] what happened on that day
[2:28:26] William Branham has returned to
[2:28:28] Jeffersonville Indiana

[2:28:35] simplicity
[2:28:40] and the lamb El Cordero was once again
[2:28:46] they're in Jeffersonville Indiana
[2:28:48] on March 17th
[2:28:53] revealing the Seven Seals
[2:28:57] he opened it on Sunset mountains
[2:29:04] 18 days
[2:29:09] so could it be that between verse 7.
[2:29:16] was only 17 days
[2:29:20] verse 9.
[2:29:25] and the unfolding of this great love
[2:29:28] story
[2:29:31] cause something to happen
[2:29:36] forth in the hearts of God's children
[2:29:42] and they sung a new song saying
