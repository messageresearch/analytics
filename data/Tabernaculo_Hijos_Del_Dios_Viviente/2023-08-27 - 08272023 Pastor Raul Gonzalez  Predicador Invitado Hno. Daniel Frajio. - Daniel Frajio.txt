to be once again a place that's been dedicated to to for worshipers to come and we always receive an answer is that I've ever asked something of the Lord whatever it might be that I didn't receive an answer sometimes the answer was yes but sometimes the answer was no yes he always answers yes yes we see is as good as is you may be seated for just a moment this morning we have a thought we'd like to express last night we ministered on Perfection and Perfection through a restored friendships something we've shared with the church at home but it was a serious services oh I don't remember maybe a dozen isena of services unfolding the Stars so to preach it in one service but I'm sure the Holy Spirit and keep opening it to you they're in your closet I don't have to worry about delivering everything uh many times as many as the minister brother and may it cause you to be a student of the world and dig deeper in that little prayer closet at home oh God can really really touch you that's true and the first thing he said I must put this house in order he said was to be a house in order he gave an example so so the head of every home but now we have a greater method not with a whip in hand but with the love of God in our hearts but with the love of God in our hearts God I began preaching on this thought years ago I haven't finished it yet I don't think I'll ever finish it at my age I won't live long enough because it's the Eternal Word of God but first I want to share with you a couple of principles in the Bible and I hope that will help you as we enter into our thoughts that you know well that is God speaks as a professor behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord in verse he told us what that how Dreadful that day would be because he's telling us before verse 1 comes to pass I will do this though I'll send you Elijah on the prophets he says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse we know now by the grace of God that John the Baptist and the karma he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children I made a statement it's John the Baptista I I that John the Baptist fulfilled this part I know you are Bible readers we won't turn to it I'll just mention it you know we are either in Luke chapter one Lucas Capital Uno was an elderly couple Zechariah and Elizabeth and they were great in age like Abraham and Sarah and Elizabeth was Barren Elizabeth we have never had children and it was when it was humanly impossible for her to have them but Zechariah a man like Abraham despite their age still praying he wanted a son it was his time as a levite and a priest in the middle of the sentence and it doesn't matter because that was for the first coming foreign foreign [Music] oh God 2000 years you know there was a time and you can read the quotes where brother Branham would say now John Was Elijah because Jesus told us but he wasn't the Elijah of Malachi 4. he's the Elijah of Malachi 3. and he said that many times but in a message I believe it's called Messiah foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is 1961. he was given a commission to take Christ to the world you can do the math from 46 to 61. he didn't have this Revelation he had an opinion opinion but then God comes down and gives him the Revelation you say why being a prophet he wouldn't know this because God didn't show it you see Revelation comes from God a housewife every one of those gets Revelations the housewife she needs only do what the minister must do hey yes foreign modern events made very clear by prophecy it shows Revelations 5 1-9 it was a vision that John was seen but this vision from the time available of the verse from the first verse to this day this vision is an active Vision this Vision has been unfolding for almost seven thousand years it began in Genesis and it still unfolding here this morning that's the way God writes his words in other words you are a part of this Vision you are the active this vision is history some of this Vision John lived through it some of this visions and I saw from the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside comma sealed with Seven Seals I want to read it again and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals you're the author of this book this is the Lamb's Book is the Lamb of God great Holy Spirit come down and take this open book and reveal it to our hearts we ask all this in Jesus name amen amen Revelations five is the greatest love story ever told from verse 1 beginning from him that sat on the throne all the way to a lamb slain all the actors in this chapter is the same God it's the king of glory descending down changing forms with one purpose in mind [Applause] the king Rey took off his crown and it is in a man that could be God's lamb foreign foreign which was the original scene foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] to be close to his children so in his mind he said I've got to descend lower I must get closer to them but as Jesus of Nazareth John yes could put his head on his bosomes the 12 disciples could Embrace him from time to time one or two might touch him but but the masses couldn't get close to him so God changed form again [Applause] foreign Genesis back there that's 4000 BCS so for the sake of sharing this with you Genesis is 4000 BC is Revelations and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side that makes it sound like there's something written within and there's something on the back side then after the karma it says and a prophet that like you and I read it and from now to just a day before he preached the bridge many times he gave us his opinion and told us that there's something written within but there's something written on the outside he he mentioned that he caught seven Thunders was the Seven Seals that are on the back side there were seven seals when he preached the bridge that series of opening of the revelation of the Seven Seals yes he said no he said seven Thunders is not Seven Seals and there's nothing written on the outside of the book The Lord that he can't do that everything must be in the word everything must be in Christ yet for 10 years he expressed his opinion and for 10 years men take those quotes and put a period on it period s and all they have to do is continue opening the books you say why would God allow that to happen so you could hide it from the eyes of the wise and Prudence is that was the prophet's advice you reduce God to a very small dog he's bigger than this in this building it is bigger than this world [Music] yet he wants to live in your heart back to Eden that day in Genesis 321 where the father is dressing Adam and Eve so Revelation 5 1. begins about 4 000 BC is it was a vision of that day in Egypt when Adam and Eve were put out of the presence of the father foreign it's found in the message Souls that are in prison now and it's in English it's paragraph 139 and the prophet says but you see in this book was what was redeemed it was the book of redemption and everything that he had redeemed was written in this book all that he died for was written in the book and he could not leave his military seat until he had thoroughly redeemed at the cross because they were predestinated in the Lamb's Book of Life and he had to stay the room again recession until the last person was finished foreign [Music] God Almighty and John looked around and he wept is because there was no man even worthy to look on the book okay those seven parts of one divine plan thank you from time and to Eternity mystery of it and it was the book of redemption he says the new testamento and it had been lost by the human race Revelations [Applause] and he's looking back to Eden now we know that the Book of Genesis was written by Moses by Vision just like John saw this book of Revelations foreign you see when God created the heavens and the Earth Moses wasn't even born yet he wouldn't be born 24 news and look at the detail he spoke on the writing of the Book of Genesis why because he was seeing it and he was hearing it he was healing God speak to us [Music] just like it happened that day foreign [Music] in the right hand of him wouldn't that be a throne is in heaven so this was Eden what Throne was this it was the throne in Genesis he says I hid myself because I was naked okay he said who told you you were naked the woman I don't remember asking for her you just gave her to me right away he throws the blame on someone else you know the one that you made and God sets a judgment Throne that's the Throne of Revelations because he's the same yesterday today we could say it's grammatically correct foreign and a prophet when he preached the bridge he said there's nothing on the back side he says seven Thunders is not Seven Seals and the Holy Spirit yes from the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written Within is Seven Seals right wrong and I saw on the right hand that sat on the throne a book written within comma is Seven Seals and when he preached the first seal it takes and he rolls up a paper he said they didn't have books like we have today it was a scroll and what was written and the scroll that the word speaks of here that means they would take a leather strap they would tie it with something and then they would pour wax on them Italian and that person he's a person alone has the authority your message what was written inside yeah for years thinking something was on the back side the Holy Spirit and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne written and on the back side those Scrolls were sealed over Seven Seals counting from the birth of Christ original here in chapter five is is God descending change in forms he's got one purpose to get closer to his seat get closer to his children to get closer from you has been the thought in his mind ever since his children come on now from Genesis to Revelations apocalypsies angels are mentioned in Exodus is the first mentioned of the Angel of the Covenant the strong Angels who alone will choose who is worthy to open the book Revelations and I saw a strong Angel clo came into my name without voice and to lose the seals thereof it is in verse 2. we fast forward in verse two we fast forward to the year 1446. it's Israel's 11th Hour Israel the first Exodus has begun it's the morning after the death Angela the writer of death is sweeping through Egypt into a journey it's a character building times it's Jerusalem or bust Israel Israel over and over again from verse we fast forwarded over 2500 years it's God bringing it down the great story the greatest love story ever told he's reduced he's going to reduce 7 000 years to nine verses verse verse 2 verse of Revelations five the apocalypse is and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals around it's the king is descended from Glory he's coming down lower because he wants to get closer to his children we fast forward to the year 1446. the angel of the Covenant Israel the angel of the Covenant was looking for a worthy one for four thousand years from Genesis Revelations [Applause] and no man in heaven is able to open the book it was history yeah Astoria Revelations 5 4. and it says and I wept much because no man was found worthy and to read the book [Music] not only it was a strong Angel leading Israel out of Egypt he was also looking for a man who was worthy it had to be a Kinsmen because that was the law of God redemptions there was a Kinsman to redeem them and the angel of the Covenant was keeping to his words experience men and women and when no one was found worthy then God descended a little lower it says for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor is him to have dominion over the works of thy hands put all things under his feet and the Beast of the fields Gloria I don't this is all shipping oxen yay and the Beast of the fields [Music] [Music] Hebrews chapter 2 everybody else who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death because as the king of glory great Supreme Spirit God that is so he created a body without spot or wrinkles who could suffer death Paul said crowned with glory and honored he by the grace of God should taste death for you that means from the day we're born from the day we're born neither does corruption inheritance and I'll remind you this morning young lady Hallelujah from verse from verse two three and four of Revelations we fast forward in time again now it's 1500 years later Revelations okay the year is Jesus begins his ministry at 30 years of age and the lion is now taking the Lion's Share Israel the Fig Tree and is opening the book yes for those that hear the message you'll remember it's like as I bring into your memories he says we're going to do something different your Bible to Matthew 24. hold your finger there and then I want you to open your Bibles Revelation six and I'm gonna show you Jesus Israel so Revelations five and five and one of the elders saith unto me not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David we have prevailed to open the book in other words The Plan of Redemption had begun in other words in other words and one of the elders saith unto me weep not you know behold the line of the tribe of David under the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the books when was this the first coming of Christ where was the book first opened on the foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so from verse two three and four two verse 5. years and it's the beginning of the ministry of Jesus at 30 years of age this is where Revelations five and five was fulfilled that day is the ministry of Jesus Revelations so notice this is John is on the island of Patmos almost 60 years later and Resurrection resurrection of Jesus Christ that means that even this verse history it was not it wasn't even prophecy when he saw it it was history and Historia and he lived in the day and he walked with a man who was the lion of the tribe of Judah and at the moment a great privilege history thank you Hallelujah so Revelations 5 and 5. it's the first coming the first seal has opened the first Fork the first Forerunner John the Baptist is on the scene is unfolding God on the throne has changed forms again from the angel of the Covenant to Jesus and no one saw it no one was recognizing their day in their message the change El Cambio from the angel of the Covenant to Jesus all the time for one reason foreign I yo the one on the throne will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me that was John and the Lord whom you seek almighty God shall suddenly come to his Temple that's the temple God 's coming to yeah he wasn't coming to the synagogue he wasn't coming to the temple that Herod had made Brothers Jesus of Nazareth even the messenger of the Covenant in other words The Messengers the first time to the angel of the Covenant to a child being born through a virgin Immaculate birth um he even had Pagan rulers to testify it that day before Pilot's throne after four days of them mocking him of them interrogating of them slapping him addressing him in robes and laughing at him [Applause] stands before Israel Israel stands before the high priest stands before the Levites that were there you remember our lamb was chosen the old testamento once a year there was a sacrifice and they would bring lambs and his sons and after four days you come before the people and lift up the lamb there would be sacrifice for them [Music] because the following days that you can testify because he is your righteous sacrifice yeah Revelations 5 6 and I beheld immide and low in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders as it had been slain having seven horns which are the seven spirits of God send forth into all the Earth watch closely now as we fast forward from verse 5 to verse 6. it's now between those verses it's now three and a half years and Jesus is in the garden to pray for one hour [Applause] the changing Ministries [Music] was it always the king of the Jews yes yes yes but there was an appointed time when these Ministries were on foreign [Music] not a change in foreign we saw Life Magazine take their pictures Mora and few can go in feel like Pandora [Music] Jesus Christ foreign [Music] [Applause] who are born again [Music] and all this work for you had been done Jesus Jesus he opened the book he loosed the seals part one do you know this new testamento is the first sale written escrito diploma think about it though you're wrong brother Daniel that's okay I've been wrong before but I love thinking of how great my God is and how he hides things from the eyes of the wise and prudence and reveal it to a little group to whom he will increase by Revelation rapturing faith Revelations apocalypsies here the lamb is now but to a gentile Church Revelations now the second coming the lion Ministry was his first coming first Revelations 5 and verse 7. says that was that down Calvary Cordero is doing this and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne now the lion had already done this but that was his first comment now the lamb is doing it the lion opened it for Israel now the lamb is [Music] great and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne Revelations 5 7. you know what year it is the year is 19 and 63. so between verse 6 and verse 7. passes more than 1900 years we're now in the 20th century oh yeah he took the book is how February the 28th I know the Bible says no man knoweth when he's coming but could it be possible he'll let us know what he's done Revelations 5 7. the year is 1963. yes so between verse 6 and verse 7. over 1900 years we're now in the 20th century he took the book it's February the 28th 1963. as you know that's where it was opened on the Revelation revelation of the greatest love story was being revealed you say how do you know he was opened on Sunset mountains the invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965. 30 more days and God will take his Prophet off the Earth says and the Seven Seals of God when it was opened yes and I foretold you a year and six months before it happened he said go to Arizona and what would happen out there in the desert men sitting right here standing right there in prison when the seven angels came down and they don't even know what it's all about it yes Revelations again it's repeating is he just repeating himself oh there's something else and when he had taken the book I thought he'd already took the book in verse 7 he came and took the book that happened on Sunset and when he had taken the books every one of them Harps and golden vials which are the prayers of the Saints Revelations 5 8 repeats again that he had taken the book because it's March 17th 1963. what happened on that day William Branham has returned to Jeffersonville Indiana and on March 17th he begins preaching simplicity and the lamb El Cordero was once again they're in Jeffersonville Indiana on March 17th revealing the Seven Seals he opened it on Sunset mountains 18 days so could it be that between verse 7. was only 17 days verse 9. and the unfolding of this great love story cause something to happen forth in the hearts of God's children and they sung a new song saying they are worthy to take the books for that was slain he has redeemed us to God out of every Kindred the lamb was nowhere [Music] you could see Revelations 14. when Christ goes back to Israel and Revelations the Throne of mercy and Grace hundred and forty four thousands it's Revelations 5 and 9. and they sung a new song Thou Art where did you take the book to open the seals for that was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred it's Revelations 5 9. do you know what year and day it is when God's people begin to sing this new song and worship him and give a honor and Glory
