[Music] we're ready [Music] Christians in the world Catholics and everything everybody else so-called believers who claim to be Believers if the Rapture happens that means that one in a million will

brother romances just like John the Baptist with John Baptist King yeah and even the example why did the scriptures say why the apostles or the prophet say why doesn't it say that Elias was first

Messenger see if you could qualify your life the spiritual brother of Jesus Christ Iglesia [Music] like that remember when the road Jesus Christ football all those things how they left him and you know how he only stayed with 12. said many disciples he had that supposedly were strong all your words are strong blood to be a Christian you will come and enjoy of a picnic or a piglet you come to a battlefield you are coming to the receiving ordinance to the to receive orders one another the one who guide us the one who orders the one who makes us to be walking in statues is an exam here says it has to be Inferno said Jesus thou who exalt into heaven will be brought down into hell foreign until even the foreign countries come here to pick up our field and send in a way to define churches and the Staples and so forth here is their word is that judgment foreign [Music] right beneath is sliding here plump back to the Southern Sea because there's many cities imagine what's going to happen and people are still there man now let me tell you I was seen the other day that a young man famous university a seismologist Elizabeth he saw he said that he invented something that conceived or everything that was under California like uh honeycomb yeah said he didn't know what was holding him you know what is holding it I know what is holding it is you couldn't understand it because our mind is finite we don't understand what God can do it now he said foreign Los Angeles repent the rest of you to turn to God the hour of us rallies upon the Earth how people there is time to flee and come into Christ they're going to have to flee from despair there will be a great earthquake he's not just gonna have a little Earth magnitude it is [Applause] he was cursed o foreign foreign [Music] always be ready up and down this post like we went to the year after year proclaiming your word is of the Bride is the truth I took your name by it Lord and said he wasn't saying the Lord and I feel that I'm conscious Lord of what I'm doing well actually even though you have a problem speaking to say the Lord just already knows a [Music] a refuge now contemporary evil things are supposed to be prophesied foreign foreign [Music] how can we do that is your performance to say the truth we have to get ready for the three ordinances to speak one with another it is fellowship and walk under that God Lord help me to have peace in reality you're only asking for a favor but you have to stay quiet you speak to the Lord and you get quiet it's better you win until he answers and you are in one agreement [Music] there is a perfect communion a great way to have a conversation is to be in agreement about certain things but we don't get to a certain point and there's something strange about it for example businessman they used to tell us that we have to sit down uh about a coffee again that's what we have to do when he did this to make fun of him but this is a good very good teaching there a guest s and those who are lands everybody had to work they won't take their drinks were almost to the ground and they picked all the girls are animals to try it for her he is [Music] will make you feel fresh and it will you will spell Goodman why would they do that foreign commandment s cleansing then also wash my hands and my head is your feet then the house will give you the welcoming with

married man fills butterflies in the valley the women feel the shoes the man says the best of the wife she's the most beautiful Paul Hermanos Brothers you're one of them is that love right thing no I haven't before this there is something better than that in the moment use the law of God the Lord Jesus Christ foreign say s related to that to wash our feet Yes cleansing of the Holy Ghost in person then it has to be a mutual feelings disagree with him [Music] that's all right but it says that we have to have the same feeling yes we have mutual agreement you're gonna have fellowships agreement with him so when we get to the table of the lord we must be in agreement with this word 40 percent 60 percent wow it's with all of this word because then we reach to the fullness to the seventh age but when Martin Luther received the Revelation that the right the the just shall live I paid they only believed in the heart yes and they went it doesn't matter how they were located the Lord what happened with the lutherans came and they organized now the third stage among people that he speaks it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost three stages of a believer in three stages by which every believer
