[0:02] verse Romans
[0:08] 1:14 the Apostle
[0:11] Paul fulfill his
[0:15] ministry as God told
[0:18] him I'll send you to the
[0:21] Gentiles and you'll take the
[0:25] inheritance that was for
[0:28] Israel the book that I've
[0:32] opened the Seven Seals that I've
[0:36] loosed it's what is Israel
[0:39] rejected and it's what Paul took to the
[0:42] gentile
[0:44] people it's what we still have with us
[0:47] [Music]
[0:49] today
[0:51] open without a
[0:54] revelation it's closed to
[0:57] you so the open book
[1:00] still requires a
[1:04] revelation that God Alone can give
[1:07] you it's a it's the personal experience
[1:11] in this last Church
[1:15] age it's always been a personal
[1:19] experience from the days that Jesus
[1:21] walked on the
[1:25] earth even the 12
[1:28] apostles walked with
[1:31] Jesus even
[1:33] John who would put his head on the bosom
[1:36] of
[1:39] Jesus it's it still wasn't
[1:42] enough it wasn't until Jesus was dead
[1:45] buried and resurrected the third
[1:51] day was
[1:53] dead
[1:54] buried and resurrected the third
[1:57] day it wasn't until he rose
[2:01] again that he that the father began to
[2:04] give them
[2:08] Revelation and the friendship grew
[2:13] greater with
[2:15] Jesus after he was
[2:17] gone from his flesh
[2:20] body the friendship was greater now that
[2:24] the Holy Spirit was coming to them
[2:30] because now he could be with each one of
[2:33] them moment every hour in every place
[2:38] under every
[2:40] trial Romans 1 and verse
[2:43] 14 the Apostle
[2:46] Paul a prophet the great prophet of
[2:49] God he said I am a deor both to the
[2:52] Greeks and to The
[2:58] Barbarians both to the wise and to the
[3:03] unwise I've heard men
[3:06] say I only preach to the Bride of Jesus
[3:12] Christ Paul
[3:14] said
[3:16] I
[3:19] Paul the messenger to the first church
[3:23] age the angel to the
[3:27] Ephesians the great prophet of God
[3:30] he who was ascribed to more than half of
[3:33] the New
[3:36] Testament He Who as much an example to
[3:38] us as William brandham
[3:42] was just as much an
[3:45] example he said I am
[3:49] deor both to the Greeks and to The
[3:52] Barbarians both to the wise
[3:57] version and to the unwise
[4:00] so as much as is in
[4:04] me I'm ready to preach the gospel to you
[4:07] that are Rome
[4:11] [Music]
[4:13] also and as as much as is in
[4:16] me I am ready to preach the
[4:19] gospel to you and Albuquerque here this
[4:23] morning let's pray Heavenly
[4:26] Father we thank you this morning
[4:30] ask your blessings upon your
[4:32] people and may you Open the Eyes of our
[4:37] understanding that we'll see Jesus
[4:40] only we ask it in the name of the Lord
[4:43] Jesus
[4:45] Christ amen you may be
[4:51] seated in
[4:54] Visions in the prophetic
[4:57] word which is which was unfolding The
[4:59] Plan of
[5:02] Redemption every symbol in there is
[5:05] mentioned for a Divine
[5:09] Purpose in The
[5:11] Parables there are things
[5:14] mentioned that are only there to fill or
[5:17] dramatize the
[5:21] story sometimes even to obscure the
[5:24] spiritual lesson
[5:30] many details in a
[5:32] parable are there to hide the
[5:37] meaning that can only be seen by a
[5:39] personal
[5:43] revelation as Jesus said in Matthew
[5:46] 11 father I thank
[5:48] you that you've hidden these things from
[5:51] the eyes of the wise and
[5:55] prudent but you'll reveal it unto babes
[5:57] such as would learn
[6:02] so that put that gives us a principle to
[6:04] live
[6:05] by that if you're going to get
[6:07] revelation of this book called The
[6:12] Bible you have to come by God's way
[6:16] first to repent and be baptized in the
[6:19] name of the Lord Jesus
[6:24] Christ and you will be the gift of the
[6:26] Holy
[6:28] Spirit born a good
[6:32] experience then you become one of these
[6:37] babes to whom God will reveal his
[6:40] book reveal his
[6:43] plan reveal
[6:45] himself for Christ is the mystery of God
[6:50] revealed many Visions in the
[6:53] Bible we we read one last
[6:56] night and we'll share that again as we
[6:59] read
[7:01] it's Revelation
[7:05] 61 and it's and it's it's it's the
[7:07] vision declaring that the first seal is
[7:12] open not that it was going to be
[7:15] open but that it was
[7:18] open Revelation 61 reads like
[7:21] this and I saw when the lamb opened one
[7:25] of the
[7:28] seals can I heard is that where the
[7:30] noise of Thunder one of the four beasts
[7:32] saying come and
[7:37] see we touched on it last
[7:40] night we realized that the lamb was
[7:43] Jesus
[7:45] Christ and he and he's the one that
[7:48] opened one of the
[7:51] seals and and the seal is what held is
[7:54] is what held the book open
[7:58] [Music]
[8:01] or or rather it's what held the book
[8:03] closed the
[8:06] seal but the English word they use the
[8:09] word
[8:10] [Music]
[8:13] book but in the days of Jesus their
[8:16] books were really a
[8:19] scroll it was a paper or an animal
[8:23] skin that was rolled
[8:25] up and the
[8:27] seal it could be a piece of leather
[8:30] wrapped around to hold it
[8:39] shut some would take wax and pour it on
[8:46] it the noble men would put their ring
[8:48] and press it into the
[8:52] wax then a
[8:55] messenger would take that
[8:58] scroll and he would run to take it to
[9:01] whom it was
[9:05] intended then the person for whom the
[9:08] message was
[9:11] sent had the right to remove the
[9:15] seal he had the
[9:18] right he' remove the
[9:20] seal and he would just drop it on the
[9:23] ground because it wasn't the seal he
[9:26] that was that was coming to him
[9:30] it was the seal that held the
[9:33] message and the seal had to come
[9:36] off so he could open the
[9:40] scroll and realize behold I send you
[9:44] Elijah the prophet in these last
[9:48] days but but you could read the
[9:51] message but now you need to
[9:56] Revelation who is Elijah when is he
[9:59] coming what will it be like what will he
[10:04] preach well all of those
[10:06] questions would be
[10:09] answered in the next
[10:12] scroll and you'd take the scroll off the
[10:15] second the second seal would come off
[10:16] the second
[10:19] scroll and open that
[10:22] up then it would be the the message to
[10:24] tell you who that Prophet is who that
[10:26] Elijah is
[10:31] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[10:32] the
[10:34] seals in other words I saw when Jesus
[10:37] opened one of the
[10:40] seals and I heard as it were the noise
[10:43] of
[10:45] thunder in other words I heard the voice
[10:48] of God telling me that the seal was
[10:53] open and one of the four beasts
[10:57] saying this one was the
[11:00] Lion of the tribe of
[11:02] Judah which was
[11:04] Jesus and I and I saw Jesus say saying
[11:09] come and
[11:10] see isn't that what Jesus said in his
[11:15] ministry come and
[11:18] see that if the works that I do don't
[11:21] prove who I
[11:24] am then it goes
[11:27] on a vision full of
[11:30] symbols and as we get into the flow of
[11:33] visions and
[11:36] Parables it really helps us to
[11:40] understand the style of the author of
[11:43] this
[11:44] book called The
[11:47] Bible Jesus it was
[11:51] prophesied that when Messiah would
[11:54] come that he would speak in
[11:57] Parables and without without a parable
[12:00] he would not
[12:02] speak but in
[12:04] Parables he was going to tell us
[12:07] things that had been hidden since the
[12:09] foundation of the
[12:11] world in other
[12:13] words things that he had been teaching
[12:16] Adam and
[12:19] Eve things that they couldn't hold to
[12:21] and
[12:25] keep they failed to fulfill it
[12:29] but God said my word will not return to
[12:32] me
[12:34] void I'll have a
[12:36] man one day that'll take me at his
[12:40] word he'll get a hold of that
[12:42] word he'll make it
[12:45] real that man was Jesus
[12:48] Christ and through the blood of
[12:50] Jesus you can be that man
[12:54] now you can be that
[12:56] woman what Adam and Eve failed to
[13:00] do through the blood of Jesus you can
[13:04] keep his
[13:05] word you can live
[13:08] true in in the book of the Psalms Psalm
[13:13] 78 it goes like this give ear oh my
[13:17] people to my
[13:20] law incline your ears to the words of my
[13:25] mouth I will open my mouth in a parable
[13:30] I will utter dark thing dark sayings of
[13:35] old hundreds of years
[13:38] later
[13:41] hundreds this this prophecy was anointed
[13:44] to
[13:47] Matthew and he put it in his
[13:51] gospel in Matthew 13 and verse
[13:57] 34 Matthew wrote this
[14:00] anointed of the Holy
[14:02] [Music]
[14:04] Spirit and and this Old Testament
[14:06] prophecy the Holy Spirit brought it to
[14:08] his
[14:09] [Music]
[14:12] remembrance write it in your book
[14:17] Matthew and Matthew
[14:19] wrote in verse 33 of Matthew
[14:23] 13 another Parable spoke unto
[14:27] them heaven like unto
[14:31] leaven which a woman took and hid meur
[14:35] of
[14:37] meal till the whole was
[14:40] leavened a
[14:42] parable but we won't speak on that one
[14:45] yet in verse
[14:48] 34 then Matthew says all these things
[14:51] spake Jesus unto the multitude and
[14:55] Parables he's now Anointed with the
[14:57] prophecy of the prophets
[15:02] and then he tells us and without a
[15:05] parable spoke he not unto
[15:08] them what was the
[15:10] reason in 30 verse 35 he tells us the
[15:16] reason that it might be fulfilled which
[15:18] was spoken by the
[15:22] prophet saying I will open my mouth in
[15:27] Parables I will things which have been
[15:30] kept secret from the foundation of the
[15:35] world not before the
[15:38] foundation since the foundation the days
[15:41] of
[15:42] Adam the things he told Adam the things
[15:46] he was teaching
[15:48] Adam you what he was teaching
[15:51] Adam how to handle the spoken
[15:55] word The Original Seed
[15:59] he wanted his son
[16:01] Adam to be a Creator like he was a
[16:05] Creator he wanted his son
[16:08] Adam to have thus sayith the
[16:11] Lord he wanted his son
[16:14] Adam to have faith to speak to that
[16:18] mountain so everything that
[16:21] Jesus
[16:23] Messiah King of the Jews would
[16:26] speak would be in a parable
[16:30] so with that
[16:32] thought what about the Great Commission
[16:35] to the
[16:37] church was it a
[16:40] parable his entire
[16:42] Earthly thus sayith the
[16:45] Lord everything he would
[16:48] speak would be in a
[16:50] parable none of it would be
[16:53] literal like take for instance the Great
[16:57] Commission in Matthew 28 starting at
[17:00] Verse
[17:02] 18 and Jesus came and spake unto them
[17:07] saying all power is given unto me in
[17:10] heaven and in
[17:14] Earth he was just about ready to ascend
[17:17] on
[17:19] high he'd been for about 40
[17:23] days and before he leaves he gives him a
[17:27] Great Commission
[17:29] in verse
[17:30] 19 he says go ye
[17:33] therefore and teach All
[17:35] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[17:39] the father and of the son and of the
[17:41] Holy
[17:44] Ghost it was Jesus who said
[17:47] that is it true or is it
[17:51] false it's
[17:54] true we're not scared to say what Jesus
[17:57] said is true no
[18:02] especially now we know how he why he
[18:04] said
[18:07] it we know how he said
[18:10] it he said it in a
[18:13] parable it wasn't
[18:15] literal these were
[18:18] symbols and the Revelation would come
[18:21] later teaching them to observe all
[18:26] things whatsoever I commanded you
[18:29] and L I'm with you
[18:32] always even until the end of the
[18:34] world Amen but in Acts chapter
[18:39] 2 verses 36-
[18:43] 38 is the revelation of the
[18:47] parable adds more detail to the
[18:51] parable makes the Great Commission to
[18:53] the church
[18:56] clear another word we use for
[19:01] clarity is
[19:04] revelation Holy Spirit
[19:07] Revelation because that's how modern
[19:11] events are made
[19:13] clear by prophecy by revelation of the
[19:18] prophecy Acts chapter
[19:20] 2 verse
[19:23] 36 that Peter a great prophet and
[19:27] Apostle of God
[19:30] anointed of the Holy
[19:31] Spirit he said therefore let all the
[19:34] house of Israel know
[19:38] assuredly that God hath made that same
[19:42] Jesus whom you have
[19:45] crucified both Lord and
[19:49] Christ in other words
[19:52] Jesus is both
[19:54] Lord and Christ Lord
[19:58] him that's the father Christ the Holy
[20:03] Spirit what is it God changing
[20:06] [Music]
[20:08] for not three Gods one God and it's
[20:13] Jesus the body of
[20:16] Jesus that the father
[20:18] created was called the Son of
[20:21] God that was the title of this
[20:25] body that was born to the Virgin Mary
[20:28] [Music]
[20:29] but the life and the one who that
[20:33] body was the Lord
[20:35] himself the creator of heavens and
[20:39] earth he that sat on the throne with an
[20:41] open book in his
[20:44] hand then then Peter
[20:47] says now when they heard
[20:49] this they were pricked in their
[20:53] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[20:55] rest of the
[20:57] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[21:01] do because you see within that multitude
[21:05] of
[21:06] people on the day of
[21:09] Pentecost that was watching 120
[21:13] people and they speaking in the in the
[21:16] language and dialects of all the
[21:20] people of the great things that God had
[21:24] done those same people were at the
[21:30] crucifiction those same people were at
[21:33] that
[21:35] tribunal of
[21:37] pilot those same people were the ones
[21:41] that got caught up in that
[21:44] anointing and they were screaming
[21:46] crucify him
[21:49] too said when he looked up upon that
[21:52] multitude
[21:55] of 120 come down out of the Earth
[22:01] room Jesus looked at them Peter looked
[22:04] at
[22:05] them he says and God have made that same
[22:10] Jesus I bet he pointed his finger at
[22:15] them and he said whom you have
[22:19] crucified put the finger right on that
[22:21] person because he deser the
[22:25] heart oh it smoked them in their heart
[22:29] Hearts the Bible said they were pricked
[22:32] in their
[22:34] hearts they knew they were
[22:40] guilty they they and in their hearts
[22:44] they were they they they were they
[22:45] regretted
[22:49] it and they said unto Peter and to the
[22:53] rest of the
[22:54] Apostles men and brethren
[22:58] you
[22:59] know because you saw us and heard
[23:03] us scream crucify
[23:06] him but we're feeling condemned in our
[23:11] hearts what can someone like me
[23:16] do to be saved
[23:19] now when yesterday I I screamed
[23:24] crucify what can I do
[23:27] today what can wash away my
[23:31] sins oh Peter was going to tell him
[23:35] what nothing but the blood of
[23:38] Jesus and Peter said unto
[23:41] them you screamed crucify
[23:45] him you threw stones at
[23:47] him you mocked him but there's something
[23:51] you can
[23:52] do that can wash away your
[23:56] sins repent and be bap
[23:58] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[24:02] the remission of
[24:04] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[24:07] the Holy
[24:09] Ghost and thy sins which are
[24:12] many will be washed
[24:15] away put in the sea of God's
[24:21] forgetfulness you
[24:23] see the
[24:26] parable of Jesus
[24:29] in Matthew
[24:32] 20189 had now been
[24:36] revealed and a name was
[24:40] added Jesus spoke it in the
[24:44] parable but he gave it to Peter in a
[24:48] revelation so now Matthew
[24:53] 28:19 and acts
[24:56] 238 they come together like
[25:00] this but if you belong to a
[25:04] denomination and you believe in act
[25:08] 238 you believe it like
[25:10] this and if you belong to one of the
[25:13] Evangelical
[25:15] churches and baptized in Father Son and
[25:17] Holy Ghost you believe it like
[25:21] this and then when the two come to
[25:24] talk they're talking like
[25:27] this but when you get a
[25:30] revelation Matthew
[25:32] 28:19 and act
[25:35] 238 comes together like
[25:37] this oh it's a Perfect
[25:41] Blend
[25:42] prophecy and the revelation of that
[25:46] prophecy Glory it gives you confidence
[25:50] it gives you faith it gives you patience
[25:54] with those who don't see it because you
[25:56] realize they're blind
[25:58] and the eyes of their
[26:01] understanding have not been
[26:04] opened in the book of
[26:06] Colossians the Bible
[26:09] says Colossians
[26:13] 3:17 the Revelation is growing
[26:17] now and whatsoever you do in word or
[26:22] deed do all in the name of the Lord
[26:27] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[26:29] father by
[26:32] him and now to the
[26:35] ministers and to the head of every
[26:39] house I want to tell you this you are a
[26:44] deor both to the
[26:46] wise and the
[26:48] unwise in your
[26:51] home and in your
[26:53] church and now armed with the knowledge
[26:58] [Music]
[26:59] what house will you build
[27:02] him the father as a pastor as an
[27:09] evangelist what house will we build
[27:12] him Paul
[27:14] said I am a
[27:16] deor both to the
[27:18] Greeks and to The
[27:20] Barbarians both to the wise and to the
[27:25] unwise so as much as in me is
[27:30] I am ready to preach the
[27:34] gospel to my
[27:37] church in
[27:39] Albuquerque and to the Ley the
[27:43] congregation I ask with your present
[27:50] understanding the foolish
[27:53] virgin is she your friend or your foe
[27:58] with that we
[28:00] begin on this parable of the 10
[28:03] virgins but let me say that the parable
[28:06] of the 10
[28:08] virgins is the seven seal mystery
[28:14] unfolding for the seven seal is to call
[28:17] a bride out of Pentecostal and World
[28:26] tradition you might ask did a prophet
[28:29] say
[28:30] that in the message Feast of the
[28:35] trumpets brother Bram said this and the
[28:39] seventh Angel's message under the same
[28:41] trumpet same everything exactly the same
[28:50] seal is to call the people the bride out
[28:55] of out of the Pentecostal and World
[28:57] tradition
[29:02] to the genuine atonement the
[29:06] word CH Christ in his own word
[29:11] here made flesh amongst
[29:14] us science has proved it by the
[29:18] pictures the church knows
[29:20] it the world
[29:22] around we firmly know it for he's never
[29:26] told us one thing and thus saith the
[29:31] Lord but what's been the
[29:34] truth did he not say down on the
[29:37] river as John the Baptist was sent so
[29:40] will this
[29:43] message and remember we preached last
[29:46] night and showed by the
[29:49] scripture that the first seal and the
[29:52] first horse
[29:54] rider and the first coming of Christ
[29:58] begin in the
[30:00] ministry of this first
[30:02] Elijah John the Baptist so that's a
[30:06] pattern because the Bible is full of
[30:10] patterns because the word tells us in
[30:12] Hebrews
[30:14] 138 that Jesus Christ is the same
[30:16] yesterday for and
[30:19] forever so that tells us then that when
[30:23] the second Elijah
[30:25] appears it'll be when that it'll be when
[30:28] the seventh seal is
[30:31] open and brother brandham
[30:34] said the voice on the River Ohio told
[30:38] him as John the Baptist was
[30:42] sent so will this
[30:44] message in other words it will follow
[30:47] the same
[30:48] pattern because God is unchanging in all
[30:51] his ways
[30:58] now the
[31:00] parable in Matthew
[31:03] 25 we'll begin at verse
[31:06] one Matthew 25 this is the 11th
[31:13] Hour this is the time of the voice of
[31:16] the
[31:18] Archangel which is the voice of the
[31:21] Resurrection The Voice that Lazarus
[31:25] heard the voice that Paul spoke of in
[31:27] first first Thessalonians
[31:31] 4 now Matthew
[31:34] 25 and verse
[31:36] one then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[31:39] likened unto 10
[31:42] virgins which took their
[31:46] lamps and went forth to meet the
[31:50] bridegroom then shall the Kingdom of
[31:53] Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins
[31:58] when when Matthew 24 unfolds before our
[32:04] eyes what was Matthew
[32:07] 24 a prophet told us that it was
[32:11] Jesus in a
[32:14] parable ministering to
[32:17] Israel the Seven
[32:20] Seals how do we know this the seventh
[32:24] angel told
[32:25] us a prophet
[32:29] thus sayith the Lord verse two of
[32:31] Matthew
[32:34] 25 and it says and five of them were
[32:37] wise and five were
[32:41] foolish and they that were foolish took
[32:43] their lamps and took no oil with
[32:49] them but the wise took oil in their
[32:52] vessels with their lamps
[32:58] while the bridegroom
[33:01] carried they all slumbered and
[33:05] slept let me start with a statement
[33:09] here the 10
[33:12] virgins are not the Church of
[33:15] laa but
[33:17] Believers of all
[33:20] denominations and manmade
[33:23] systems that have heard the
[33:26] call come out of her my people don't be
[33:30] partakers of her
[33:33] sins so to start with these 10
[33:38] virgins are
[33:40] believers who have come out of the of
[33:42] the great
[33:46] Harlot that that have come out of her
[33:49] Harlot
[33:51] daughters this is the 11th
[33:54] Hour this is minutes before the Midnight
[33:57] Hour
[33:59] any moment a Rapture will come and take
[34:02] the wise
[34:06] away remember Revelations
[34:10] 3:20 behold I stand at the door
[34:14] knock what hour is it it's the same hour
[34:19] it's the 11th
[34:21] hour it's Matthew
[34:25] 25 If any man hear my voice and open the
[34:29] door I will come to him and will s with
[34:33] him and he with
[34:36] me the 10
[34:38] virgins this is also the woman of
[34:40] Revelations
[34:43] 12 and the remnant of the woman's
[34:47] seed both wise and foolish
[34:57] turn with me to Revelations 12 and
[35:09] 1 Revelations chap
[35:13] 12 and verse
[35:15] one and it reads like
[35:18] this and there appeared a great Wonder
[35:21] in
[35:23] heaven a woman clothed with the son
[35:28] and the moon under her

[35:47] delivered where was this
[35:50] woman that was about to have that was
[35:52] having a
[35:53] child that had conceived

[39:54] happened on that crucifixion day
[39:58] when Satan was cast

[42:45] foolish verse
[42:47] 15 the Bible says and the serpent cast
[42:50] out of his
[42:53] mouth water as a flood
[42:57] after the
[42:58] woman this flood of
[43:02] water coming out of the mouth of the
[43:05] serpent is the seed of the
[43:08] serpent for water and
[43:11] prophecy

[44:31] church because I have I haven't been to
[44:34] to a Catholic Church in 40
[44:37] [Music]
[44:39] years I don't know where they're at
[44:43] other than to tell you she's the great

[44:50] enough verse
[44:53] 15 and he saith unto me the waters which
[44:56] thou saw
[44:58] us this is revelation
[45:03] 17:15 because the because in verse in
[45:06] chapter 12 it said the serpent cast out
[45:08] of his mouth water as a
[45:11] flood so it's a Bible
[45:15] question what was that flood of
[45:18] water then every Bible
[45:21] question has a Bible answer for you and
[45:24] the answer is in chapter 17

[46:10] the Dragon cast out of his
[46:14] mouth scientists are
[46:17] saying there's a great climate change
[46:19] going

[46:25] quick the whole all of humanity will be
[46:28] destroyed and
[46:31] lost you know what I don't doubt it one
[46:36] bit but I'm telling you it's in the plan

[50:33] raptured and the
[50:36] foolish the remnant of the
[50:39] woman remains for a Great
[50:43] Tribulation watch how the Bible is
[50:47] written remember the first verse
[50:51] began he says and I saw in
[50:55] heaven he a woman dressed with the
[51:00] sun verse one verse
[51:03] 17 this is the same
[51:06] woman chapter 12 has been talking about
[51:08] her the whole time
[51:11] down but in verse
[51:13] 17 it says and the dragon was wroth with
[51:17] the
[51:19] woman it's the mystical body of Jesus
[51:23] Christ this is the wife of the Lamb
[51:27] and he went to make
[51:30] war with the remnant of her
[51:34] seed what happened to the

[51:39] was wroth with the
[51:42] woman and went to make war with the
[51:47] woman it don't say that it says and the
[51:51] dragon was wroth with the
[51:55] woman and went to make war with the

[53:24] Sanctified but they hadn't gone to The
[53:26] Next

[53:38] didn't have the
[53:41] oil the baptism of the Holy
[53:44] Ghost they were left behind for a Great

[59:02] Hour both wise and
[59:04] foolish both Greeks and
[59:08] barians during World War
[59:11] II the Doomsday
[59:16] Clock was
[59:19] established by the scientific
[59:22] Community they felt that the Second
[59:24] World War
[59:27] had brought us to
[59:29] minutes before the Midnight
[59:32] Hour or what they believed was the total
[59:35] Destruction of the whole
[59:40] world scientific and symbolic
[59:45] clock was created to measure how
[59:51] close modern
[59:53] events were taking us to the end of the
[59:57] world but for us as
[1:00:01] Believers modern
[1:00:03] events are made clear by
[1:00:09] the that's how a
[1:00:11] Believer recognizes his day in his
[1:00:15] message it's the Holy Spirit
[1:00:19] Revelation in verse six of
[1:00:22] Matthew the Bible says and at the
[1:00:25] midnight
[1:00:27] hour
[1:00:29] Resurrection there was a cry
[1:00:32] made behold the bridegroom
[1:00:35] cometh go ye out to meet
[1:00:38] him only the wise can hear that
[1:00:44] cry one Cry of the Lord
[1:00:48] himself it had three
[1:00:51] manifestations each one designed
[1:00:56] to take us
[1:00:58] closer to take us higher to take us
[1:01:02] deeper in Christ that was the
[1:01:07] shout that was the voice of the
[1:01:10] Archangel that was the Trump of
[1:01:13] God that was Paul opening the
[1:01:17] mystery adding
[1:01:20] details to the ending of the 11th
[1:01:23] Hour the day that we're living living
[1:01:26] in to the Midnight
[1:01:30] Cry but he wasn't revealing it at
[1:01:34] yet he too spoke it in a
[1:01:38] parable it takes a
[1:01:41] revelation to know that that
[1:01:44] Parable is unfolding our
[1:01:48] days Paul said for the Lord himself
[1:01:50] shall
[1:01:53] descend with a shout
[1:01:57] with the voice of the
[1:02:00] Archangel with the Trump of
[1:02:02] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:02:10] first verses
[1:02:14] 1-6 is another parable of that same 11th
[1:02:18] hour it's a parable of seven Church
[1:02:22] ages and the calling and the choosing of
[1:02:24] the mystical body
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:29] of Jesus Christ and the reward is the
[1:02:34] same to all the
[1:02:37] saints throughout seven Church
[1:02:40] ages that are part of this body of
[1:02:44] Christ
[1:02:47] reward is eternal
[1:02:49] life read the
[1:02:52] parable verses 1- 16
[1:02:56] you find at the
[1:02:58] end when the when the last workers were
[1:03:01] coming
[1:03:03] in and they received the same pay as the
[1:03:06] first
[1:03:08] workers it was a
[1:03:11] parable wasn't
[1:03:13] natural wasn't
[1:03:16] natural the same the days of Paul and
[1:03:18] the
[1:03:21] apostles reive the same eternal
[1:03:24] life that we
[1:03:28] re Isaiah the
[1:03:32] prophet that history tells us they took
[1:03:34] a saw and saw them in
[1:03:40] pieces you and I who hope to go in a
[1:03:43] Rapture and a body
[1:03:48] change we all reive the same
[1:03:53] reward a new body
[1:03:56] a Celestial
[1:03:57] body eternal
[1:04:00] life now Matthew 25
[1:04:05] and7 the Bible
[1:04:07] says then all those V all those virgins
[1:04:10] arose and trimmed their
[1:04:15] lamps and the foolish said unto the wise
[1:04:18] give us of your
[1:04:21] oil for they never had any oil
[1:04:26] for our lamps are gone
[1:04:29] out the Bible speaks that they had a
[1:04:33] vessel and they had a
[1:04:35] lamp the vessel is where the oil
[1:04:40] went and the
[1:04:43] lamp was the wick that went in in into
[1:04:47] the the lamp was the wick that went into
[1:04:49] the
[1:04:54] vessel the lamp would pull up the
[1:04:59] oil and when you would light the lamp
[1:05:03] the
[1:05:06] wick if there's oil in the
[1:05:09] vessel it draws up the
[1:05:13] oil and it begins to
[1:05:16] burn and it stays
[1:05:18] lit as long as there's oil in the
[1:05:22] vessel the Light of Christ keeps burning
[1:05:26] in your
[1:05:27] life then you're a lamp to the
[1:05:31] world because the oils in the
[1:05:36] vess the foolish
[1:05:40] virgin those without the
[1:05:42] oil and yet they're sincere in love
[1:05:47] God the
[1:05:49] gospel always touches their
[1:05:52] hearts it lights their lamp
[1:05:56] but when they
[1:05:58] leave there's no oil to keep the fire
[1:06:03] burning as the head of their
[1:06:06] homes and they struggle to be a real
[1:06:09] testimony as a father and a
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:14] husband because they
[1:06:16] need the Holy
[1:06:18] Ghost the
[1:06:20] oil and yet they love
[1:06:23] God they come to church
[1:06:26] oh but you must be born
[1:06:29] again the oil of God the fire of the
[1:06:33] Holy Ghost to make you the kind of dad
[1:06:37] you want to
[1:06:38] be to make you the kind of mom you

[1:08:08] love of God the love of

[1:08:14] 25:7 then all those virgins arose and
[1:08:17] trimmed their
[1:08:20] lamps that
[1:08:22] means that they lit the wick
[1:08:27] they lit the wick they trimmed their
[1:08:31] lamps but they couldn't keep the fire
[1:08:34] burning in their
[1:08:37] hearts because there's no oil in the
[1:08:41] vessel do you get
[1:08:43] it verse
[1:08:46] eight and the foolish said unto the wise
[1:08:49] give us of your
[1:08:51] oil and the wise said
[1:08:56] we can't give the
[1:08:59] oil we're like you we can only receive
[1:09:05] it but the wise answered saying verse
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:10] n not so lest there be not enough for us
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:17] you you cannot give of your
[1:09:20] oil for you and
[1:09:23] I receive it in little measure
[1:09:27] it's called the refilling of the Holy
[1:09:31] Spirit until our cup is
[1:09:36] overflowing and a Rapture takes
[1:09:40] place the wise answered verse
[1:09:44] n not so lest there be not enough for us
[1:09:47] and you but go ye rather to them that
[1:09:49] sell and buy for yourselves
[1:09:58] and while they went to
[1:10:00] buy the bridegroom came and they that
[1:10:04] were
[1:10:05] ready they that were ready went in with
[1:10:09] him to the
[1:10:10] marriage and the door was
[1:10:13] shut the marriage is
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:22] complete when a bride is raptured
[1:10:27] right
[1:10:28] now we are the bride of
[1:10:32] Christ but we're also his
[1:10:36] wife remember Jewish
[1:10:41] tradition a woman that was engaged to be
[1:10:46] married the Bible says
[1:10:51] betro she was already considered the
[1:10:54] wife
[1:10:58] but they but but until then sometimes it
[1:11:01] would take a whole
[1:11:04] year that year was a year of
[1:11:07] preparation for that young
[1:11:10] lady to be
[1:11:12] preparing preparing her
[1:11:15] dress preparing her
[1:11:17] shoes preparing her attitude for the day
[1:11:21] of that
[1:11:23] wedding when the two would come together
[1:11:25] in a
[1:11:27] union then she that was betroth the
[1:11:30] betrothed
[1:11:33] wife would come would come to be the
[1:11:36] wife of that
[1:11:39] man then he was allowed to catch her
[1:11:42] away and take
[1:11:45] her where the bride of Christ being
[1:11:49] clothed with the
[1:11:51] sun one day when our cup runneth over
[1:11:57] there will be a
[1:11:58] resurrection the dead in Christ shall
[1:12:01] rise we which are alive and
[1:12:05] remain will be caught
[1:12:07] up the marriage will be a complete
[1:12:12] Union and the husband will catch us
[1:12:16] away to live with him
[1:12:20] eternally now
[1:12:26] verse
[1:12:27] 10 of Matthew 25 and while they went to
[1:12:31] buy the bridegroom came and they that
[1:12:33] were ready went in with him to the
[1:12:35] marriage and the door was
[1:12:46] shut what door was
[1:12:49] shut remember Revelations 3
[1:12:55] Jesus
[1:12:56] said to the Lan
[1:12:59] Church behold I stand at the door and
[1:13:04] knock if any open the
[1:13:06] door I will come
[1:13:10] in and take you to the wedding supper of
[1:13:12] the
[1:13:15] Lamb scripture connects with
[1:13:19] scripture and your Revelation
[1:13:22] grows and your faith grows
[1:13:25] and your hope
[1:13:27] grows and your Assurance grows and your
[1:13:30] trust in him
[1:13:34] grows verse
[1:13:37] 11 afterward came also the other virgin
[1:13:40] saying Lord Lord open to
[1:13:45] us the problem
[1:13:48] was when they finally came and said open
[1:13:50] to
[1:13:52] us the revelation of the seven
[1:13:57] seals Jesus
[1:13:59] said I've been knocking at your
[1:14:03] door for days for weeks for months for
[1:14:10] years and you never opened
[1:14:13] it you were the one who could open
[1:14:17] it I was the one knocking wanting to
[1:14:20] come in to your hearts
[1:14:28] and while the
[1:14:29] bride and while they went to
[1:14:41] buy verse 11 afterward came also the
[1:14:45] other virgins saying Lord Lord open to
[1:14:48] us
[1:14:52] us but he answered and said
[1:14:56] verely I say unto
[1:14:58] you I know you
[1:15:01] not they're not
[1:15:05] lost but they're not going in a
[1:15:08] Rapture
[1:15:11] remember the serpent the dragon was
[1:15:13] wroth with the
[1:15:17] woman and then the Bible says Comm so
[1:15:22] the serpent went
[1:15:25] after the woman's SE the the remnant of
[1:15:28] the woman's
[1:15:32] seed that's this
[1:15:34] time the wise were
[1:15:39] taken the foolish stayed
[1:15:43] behind and the devil's going to chase
[1:15:45] them
[1:15:47] down in a Great
[1:15:49] Tribulation they will give their lives
[1:15:52] for the gospel
[1:15:56] but had they opened their
[1:16:01] heart they wouldn't have to be in a
[1:16:03] Great
[1:16:07] Tribulation you'd be
[1:16:09] quickened quick changed and
[1:16:13] translated by the power of the Holy
[1:16:19] Spirit verse
[1:16:21] 12 but he answered and said verily I say
[1:16:23] unto you I know you not
[1:16:27] not watch
[1:16:30] therefore for you know neither the day
[1:16:33] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[1:16:38] cometh this time of the wise and
[1:16:44] foolish is also the time of the coming
[1:16:47] of the son of
[1:16:49] man this is Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ at his second coming
[1:16:56] this
[1:16:57] time where was the son of man
[1:17:01] Ministry it was in the voice of many
[1:17:04] Waters go to them that sell and buy he
[1:17:09] said that's the six-fold ministry of
[1:17:12] Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ you say oh no it's just the
[1:17:17] five-fold ministry brother
[1:17:19] Daniel are you
[1:17:22] forgetting like so many ministers forget
[1:17:26] the importance of the head of the
[1:17:30] house it's not the pastor's
[1:17:34] job to go to your house and set your
[1:17:37] house in
[1:17:39] order he's supposed to set this house in
[1:17:43] order and anoint you with a
[1:17:46] word for you to set your house in
[1:17:50] order so that all the houses of God
[1:17:55] can be under the anointing of the Holy
[1:17:59] Spirit waiting for Rapture in faith to
[1:18:02] take us from
[1:18:06] here so let me say
[1:18:09] again the sixfold ministry of Jesus
[1:18:13] Christ that includes the head of every
[1:18:17] home and many helps in the
[1:18:20] church as the Apostle Paul preached
[1:18:25] but how shall we
[1:18:27] buy because it's a supernatural
[1:18:31] realm Isaiah
[1:18:33] 55 and verse
[1:18:36] one oh everyone that thirst
[1:18:39] this Come Ye to the
[1:18:42] waters and he that haveth no
[1:18:45] money Come Ye byy and
[1:18:49] eat come buy wine and milk without money
[1:18:53] without price
[1:18:56] because the price was paid on the cross
[1:18:59] of
[1:19:00] Calvary when the lamb was
[1:19:04] slain
[1:19:05] when at the foundation of the
[1:19:09] world when God killed the
[1:19:11] lamb to dress Adam and
[1:19:14] Eve that's when the blood was
[1:19:18] shed the blood that washes me white as
[1:19:23] snow the blood that wants to wash you
[1:19:26] white as
[1:19:29] snow come and eat for the price has been
[1:19:34] paid verse
[1:19:36] two says as wherefore do you spend
[1:19:43] money and your labor for
[1:19:51] satisfy why do we spend so much time on
[1:19:53] the internet
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:58] for something that really satisfy us
[1:20:03] not hearken diligently unto
[1:20:07] me and eat ye that which is
[1:20:11] good not that which is
[1:20:14] bad and let your soul Delight
[1:20:19] itself in the word in fatness the
[1:20:23] prophet said
[1:20:25] verse
[1:20:26] three incline your ear and come unto
[1:20:30] me in other words meditate on his word
[1:20:34] night and
[1:20:40] day and I will make an
[1:20:44] everlasting even the sure
[1:20:47] mercies of Dave
[1:20:51] David another parable
[1:20:55] that will add
[1:20:57] detail to the 11th
[1:21:00] hour and the Midnight
[1:21:03] Cry the time of the
[1:21:05] Rapture in Luke
[1:21:08] 17 it was a scripture the prophet took
[1:21:11] it took us to many
[1:21:15] times for it was Parables that were
[1:21:18] coming to pass in this in this in our
[1:21:23] Century Luke 17 and verse
[1:21:28] 34 The Scribe Luke The
[1:21:34] Physician he said I tell
[1:21:37] you in that
[1:21:39] night the night of Matthew
[1:21:43] 25 the night that the 10 virgins were
[1:21:46] waiting
[1:21:48] for I tell you in that night of Matthew
[1:21:53] 25 there be two men in a
[1:21:56] bed the one shall be
[1:21:59] taken the other shall be
[1:22:01] left in the age we're
[1:22:04] living right we we go uh
[1:22:06] oh what do you mean two men in a
[1:22:13] bed of the words of
[1:22:17] Jesus verse 35
[1:22:20] said there will be two women
[1:22:27] taken the other left verse
[1:22:31] 36 two men shall be in the
[1:22:34] field the one shall be
[1:22:37] taken the other
[1:22:39] left and they said unto
[1:22:42] him where Lord he said unto them
[1:22:47] wheresoever the body
[1:22:49] is what body the body word of the son of
[1:22:53] man
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:22:56] Jesus Christ in the beginning was the
[1:22:59] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:23:02] Word was meant
[1:23:04] flesh and he dwelt Among Us the Bible
[1:23:08] says wheresoever the body
[1:23:11] is thither will the Eagles be gathered
[1:23:16] together the word
[1:23:19] Eagles lets us
[1:23:21] know the age that this is
[1:23:25] it's the
[1:23:27] age it's the eagle age it's a time of an
[1:23:30] eagle
[1:23:33] anointing did you notice how the Holy
[1:23:37] Spirit weaves in a detail
[1:23:40] here to
[1:23:42] confirm what he has already in all three
[1:23:47] examples they're all the same
[1:23:52] gender it's to many men it's two women
[1:23:57] it's two
[1:23:58] men they are the
[1:24:00] same in what sense are they the
[1:24:03] same remember it's a
[1:24:10] parable tells us they the
[1:24:12] same the fact that it's two
[1:24:15] women tells us they're the same the same
[1:24:19] what they're Believers in other words
[1:24:23] all 10 of them are virgin all 10 of are
[1:24:32] believers Believers of
[1:24:34] what the end time
[1:24:38] message brother Daniel are you
[1:24:41] saying that this foolish
[1:24:43] virgin is in this
[1:24:46] message yes
[1:24:48] indeed there might be a few still in the
[1:24:51] denominations
[1:24:55] but the largest group of them is in this
[1:24:59] message they're
[1:25:01] Justified they're
[1:25:03] Sanctified they're virgins
[1:25:07] all because if you put if you put and
[1:25:10] keep yourself in the hands of a
[1:25:14] denomination it won't be a virgin
[1:25:20] birth how could you take a little girl
[1:25:25] and give her to a
[1:25:28] and have her raised in a
[1:25:33] house come back 10 years
[1:25:36] later what do you think they'll have
[1:25:38] done to that innocent little
[1:25:42] child they'll have turned her into a
[1:25:44] harlot
[1:25:46] too you cannot belong to the great
[1:25:49] Harlot and her
[1:25:52] daughters and expect to come out
[1:25:56] clean but if the voice of God calls
[1:26:00] you come out of her my people it's
[1:26:04] because he wants to wash you with the
[1:26:05] blood of Jesus and clean you
[1:26:09] up that you won't be partakers of her
[1:26:12] sins no
[1:26:16] more it's the
[1:26:18] syst that corrupts the
[1:26:21] people it's the Holy Spirit
[1:26:24] that can set them free even this
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:30] morning in the
[1:26:32] message the seed is not air with a
[1:26:36] shook bam preached in
[1:26:42] 1965 he says now it's seed
[1:26:45] time or bride time the sh
[1:26:50] dead the Shucks are dried up
[1:26:54] the Virgin word
[1:26:57] time not touched it's a virgin
[1:27:01] remember a virgin
[1:27:04] word if you put in the hands of a
[1:27:08] denomination it sure won't be virgin
[1:27:12] it'll be
[1:27:18] manhandled you get to
[1:27:20] it but God's Church
[1:27:24] he says hallelujah hallelujah it's a
[1:27:26] virgin born word of God made
[1:27:34] manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:27:36] today and
[1:27:38] forever oh how wonderful I love it I
[1:27:41] believe
[1:27:43] it I know it's the truth she'll not be
[1:27:48] touched there'll be no denominational
[1:27:51] manhandling
[1:27:57] Amen in the Virgin birth of the
[1:28:03] Bride she is commanded by
[1:28:08] God she is commanded by
[1:28:12] God to come out of
[1:28:14] it and touch not her unclean
[1:28:19] things
[1:28:21] remember how Matthew 25 begins
[1:28:26] it said then shall the Kingdom of
[1:28:29] [Music]
[1:28:30] Heaven be likened into 10
[1:28:33] virgins which took their
[1:28:36] lamps and went forth to meet the
[1:28:40] bridegroom a prophet
[1:28:42] said if you put it in the hands of a
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:47] denomination these 10
[1:28:50] virgins it sure won't be virgin
[1:28:54] so what time is Matthew
[1:28:57] 25 it's bride
[1:28:59] time and 10
[1:29:01] virgins are 10
[1:29:05] Believers Prophet
[1:29:07] said of the foolish
[1:29:10] virgin foolish virgin he says you
[1:29:12] couldn't put a finger on their
[1:29:20] lives the message the sudden secret
[1:29:22] going away of the church
[1:29:34] he said how many of you all
[1:29:37] perhaps have read of the
[1:29:40] virgins some were wise and some
[1:29:43] foolish virgin means
[1:29:46] Purity they were all good
[1:29:48] people every one of them
[1:29:51] vgs Sanctified vessels of God
[1:29:55] but those who had but those who had oil
[1:29:58] in their lamps went
[1:30:02] in and the others was left
[1:30:05] out they were all
[1:30:07] virgins everyone
[1:30:10] people that you couldn't put your finger
[1:30:13] on them for anything
[1:30:19] wrong they everyone believed in the
[1:30:21] coming of the Lord
[1:30:25] they were getting ready to go meet
[1:30:28] him but some of them let their oil go
[1:30:34] out don't let don't let that be your
[1:30:37] case keep oil in your
[1:30:40] lamp oil is the holy
[1:30:43] spirit never let it drain from
[1:30:47] you when you feel your love dying
[1:30:51] away your sincerity to Christ
[1:30:55] and to the cause quickly
[1:30:58] go who has the Fountain of oil and bu
[1:31:02] for
[1:31:04] yourself a filling of the Holy
[1:31:09] Spirit our nation is
[1:31:12] gone morally corrupted and
[1:31:16] ruined our politics are corrupted and
[1:31:20] gone our leaders are corrupted and gone
[1:31:25] oh God what can we do about
[1:31:28] it you could put a good man in
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:34] it and he comes out a
[1:31:37] crook he comes out a
[1:31:40] crook and there's only and there's only
[1:31:43] one we can bring
[1:31:46] now that's the Lord
[1:31:49] Jesus let's make ready for his coming
[1:31:56] that's what a prophet said of the
[1:31:57] foolish
[1:31:59] virgin but that's not all he said he
[1:32:02] told us the foolish
[1:32:05] virgin they are
[1:32:07] sheep and they'll be
[1:32:09] saved he said it in the
[1:32:12] message the patmas
[1:32:14] vision
[1:32:17] 1960 he said brother brandham they ask
[1:32:19] him a
[1:32:21] question are the five foolish virgins of
[1:32:23] Matthew 25 counted as the Gentile
[1:32:30] Remnant I understand that the five
[1:32:33] foolish virgins were saved but have to
[1:32:35] go through the Great
[1:32:42] Tribulation if so what's their final
[1:32:47] destination could they be the Sheep
[1:32:50] which are divided from the goats in
[1:32:51] Matthew 252
[1:32:59] brother brandham
[1:33:00] said here's
[1:33:03] Aion I think so
[1:33:06] too that they are the
[1:33:08] remnant the the sleeping
[1:33:11] virgin is the
[1:33:13] remnant spoke of in
[1:33:16] Revelation Revelations 12 of the woman
[1:33:20] seed that keep the Commandments of God
[1:33:24] and have the testimony of Jesus
[1:33:27] Christ so now the
[1:33:29] prophet has hooked Matthew
[1:33:32] 25 to Revelations
[1:33:35] 12 he says this is the same time one is
[1:33:39] adding more detail to
[1:33:41] other the prophet connected Matthew
[1:33:45] 25 with Revelations
[1:33:48] 12 and Luke
[1:33:50] 17 all coming together adding more
[1:33:54] details so we can recognize our day in
[1:33:57] its
[1:33:59] message he said brother bam says this a
[1:34:04] woman will take a piece of cloth and lay
[1:34:06] it
[1:34:08] down and she begins cutting
[1:34:10] it she takes her
[1:34:13] pattern places it the way she desires
[1:34:18] it the way she's going to cut
[1:34:21] it and then what's left over
[1:34:25] is the
[1:34:26] remnant this is the foolish
[1:34:29] virgin she's made of the same
[1:34:34] cloth a prophet
[1:34:36] said they are also
[1:34:38] sheep they're not
[1:34:40] goats and they will be
[1:34:45] saved in the message 10
[1:34:49] verse a prophet tells us
[1:34:51] again you've heard him say that there
[1:34:54] are three kinds of
[1:34:56] Believers he pre he preached a
[1:34:59] message and he called it three kinds of
[1:35:03] Believers he said there are three kinds
[1:35:05] of
[1:35:07] Believers one two
[1:35:10] three he drew three
[1:35:13] circles he did it on a board he was
[1:35:18] teaching and he says this one here is
[1:35:21] the unbeliever
[1:35:24] I'll put a u right
[1:35:26] there he says this is the make
[1:35:29] believer he says I'll write make
[1:35:32] believer
[1:35:33] there and here is the
[1:35:37] believer but in this circle of the
[1:35:39] Believers he
[1:35:41] said there's two classes of
[1:35:45] people did you hear ever hear him say
[1:35:48] that if you
[1:35:50] haven't keep
[1:35:52] reading don't put a period on what you
[1:35:55] think's a
[1:35:57] revelation because there's more and
[1:35:59] there's more and there's
[1:36:02] more so in this
[1:36:04] message he saids now this Remnant was
[1:36:06] the sleeping
[1:36:10] virgin that he spurted the water from
[1:36:12] his mouth to make war
[1:36:16] with the remnant of the woman's seed he
[1:36:19] say now what is the
[1:36:21] remnant now there you have to get these
[1:36:24] types
[1:36:26] together there is a church which is
[1:36:28] church
[1:36:30] natural maybe I can draw it here and
[1:36:32] make it a bit
[1:36:35] pler brother Neville if I can take up
[1:36:38] some of your time you just forgive me he
[1:36:42] says now
[1:36:44] remember that there is
[1:36:46] what the
[1:36:48] unbeliever that's the
[1:36:51] sinner another one which is
[1:36:56] formal a formal
[1:36:58] church and then there is the other one
[1:37:01] which is the saved
[1:37:03] church now keep them in mind all the
[1:37:08] time but now in this saved
[1:37:11] Church there's two
[1:37:13] classes in this church right here and
[1:37:16] right
[1:37:18] here which was typed by
[1:37:20] Christ one of them was a sleeping virgin
[1:37:25] or the foolish
[1:37:26] virgin or or the foolish
[1:37:29] virgin and the other one had all in the
[1:37:33] lamp how many remembers the
[1:37:36] story we're going to get to it in just a
[1:37:41] minute those are the things a prophet
[1:37:44] said about the foolish virgin but that's
[1:37:47] not all he
[1:37:49] said he also said this in the message
[1:37:53] that seventh
[1:37:54] seal he says now what
[1:37:58] happened they were purged during the
[1:38:00] time of the awful tribulation
[1:38:05] period Speaking of the foolish
[1:38:08] virgin now if God's going to purge that
[1:38:13] virgin that was a good
[1:38:15] woman but she failed to get the oil in
[1:38:18] her
[1:38:20] lamp and he's going to purg her through
[1:38:23] pers
[1:38:25] ution and he puts those 12 tribes right
[1:38:28] in there for the same
[1:38:31] time and purges them during the time of
[1:38:34] the tribulation
[1:38:37] period because that tribulation
[1:38:42] period it's a purging
[1:38:44] time it's judgment oh do you see
[1:38:49] it what did he say about that foolish
[1:38:51] virgin
[1:38:53] she's a
[1:38:56] good how
[1:38:58] good the foolish
[1:39:01] virgin does not take the mark of the
[1:39:05] beast the foolish virgin does not suffer
[1:39:08] torment in
[1:39:14] Hell a prison
[1:39:17] house for those who have rejected
[1:39:20] Christ she's not there but instead she's
[1:39:24] on the paradise
[1:39:26] side of this Fifth
[1:39:28] Dimension awaiting a white Throne
[1:39:32] judgment where she's a
[1:39:35] virgin where she's an
[1:39:37] Eagle where she is the
[1:39:40] sheep in Matthew
[1:39:43] 25:31 listen now as we be
[1:39:48] closing to this white Throne judgment
[1:39:54] good
[1:39:55] woman stands to be
[1:39:58] judged before almighty
[1:40:01] God the only just
[1:40:05] judge in verse 31 of Matthew
[1:40:10] 25 when the son of man shall come in his
[1:40:14] glory and all the Holy Angels with
[1:40:19] him then then shall he sit upon the
[1:40:22] throne of his glory
[1:40:25] the whole world is being judged
[1:40:29] here verse
[1:40:31] 32 and before him shall be gathered all
[1:40:35] nations and he shall separate them one
[1:40:38] from
[1:40:40] another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep
[1:40:43] from the
[1:40:45] goats it's terrible it's in symbols and
[1:40:50] he shall set the sheep on his right hand
[1:40:55] but the goats on his
[1:40:57] left then shall the king say unto them
[1:41:00] on his right
[1:41:02] hand the
[1:41:04] Sheep the foolish
[1:41:07] virgin judgment
[1:41:13] begins it's a principle laying in the
[1:41:18] word say unto them on his right
[1:41:22] hand this foolish
[1:41:24] virgin Come Ye
[1:41:27] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[1:41:31] you from the foundation of the world do
[1:41:34] you see she's not
[1:41:37] lost then he
[1:41:40] says then he reads out the reason
[1:41:45] why that he gave them eternal
[1:41:48] life because while he sat on the throne
[1:41:51] above
[1:41:54] and looked down on
[1:41:55] Earth he saw the way the foolish was
[1:42:02] living they were
[1:42:04] virgins they were foolish because they
[1:42:07] didn't get the
[1:42:09] oil they were foolish because they
[1:42:11] didn't take it serious I need the
[1:42:13] baptism of the Holy
[1:42:17] Ghost other than that they were living a
[1:42:21] life this is the kind of Life they were
[1:42:25] living this is God testifying of the
[1:42:28] life of the foolish virgin on
[1:42:32] Earth for for I was in
[1:42:36] hungered and you the foolish
[1:42:38] virgin you gave me
[1:42:40] meat I was
[1:42:42] thirsty and you gave me drink I was a
[1:42:47] stranger and you took me in I was naked
[1:42:52] and you clothed me I was sick and you
[1:42:56] visit me I was in prison and you came
[1:43:00] unto me the foolish God is saying this
[1:43:04] is what I saw them
[1:43:07] do then shall the righteous answer
[1:43:11] him the foolish the righteous of God who
[1:43:16] died in a Great
[1:43:18] Tribulation they say

[1:53:06] Mexico this
[1:53:09] Parable as many of them
[1:53:13] are is really to provoke a very personal
[1:53:20] question that you must ask
[1:53:24] yourself or allow me to
[1:53:28] ask or better yet we let the Apostle
[1:53:32] Paul ask
[1:53:34] you this great man of
[1:53:37] God Acts 19
[1:53:40] And1 it says this Luke The Physician
[1:53:44] wrote the
[1:53:48] testimony and it came to
[1:53:50] pass that while apolla was at
[1:53:55] Corinth Paul having passed through the
[1:53:58] upper
[1:54:01] Coast came to
[1:54:04] Ephesus and finding certain
[1:54:07] disciples he said unto them have ye
[1:54:11] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:54:17] believed they said unto
[1:54:19] him we have no s we have not so much has
[1:54:22] heard whether there be any holy
[1:54:26] ghosts and he said unto
[1:54:28] them unto what then were you
[1:54:32] baptized they said unto John's
[1:54:36] baptism you know something like father
[1:54:38] son Holy
[1:54:41] Ghost then said Paul John verely
[1:54:44] baptized with the baptism of
[1:54:48] repentance saying unto the
[1:54:50] people that they should believe on
[1:54:54] him which should come after
[1:54:56] him that is on Christ
[1:55:00] Jesus and when they heard
[1:55:04] this Revelation struck their
[1:55:07] hearts and they were baptized in the
[1:55:09] name of Jesus
[1:55:12] Christ and when Paul had laid his hands
[1:55:15] upon
[1:55:16] them the Holy Ghost Came Upon
[1:55:19] them and they spake with tongues and
[1:55:21] proph
[1:55:23] side and all the
[1:55:26] men were about
[1:55:30] 12 so I ask you this
[1:55:34] morning I said all these
[1:55:37] things took so much of your
[1:55:41] time just to come to ask you this one
[1:55:45] question have
[1:55:48] you received the Holy Ghost
[1:55:52] since you said you believe this
[1:55:57] message Peter
[1:55:59] said therefore let all the house of
[1:56:01] Israel know
[1:56:04] assuredly that God ha made the same
[1:56:09] Jesus with whom you have
[1:56:13] crucified both Lord and
[1:56:15] Christ when they heard
[1:56:18] this 2,000 years ago
[1:56:22] when they heard
[1:56:23] this they were pricked in their
[1:56:26] heart said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:56:30] the
[1:56:31] Apostles men and
[1:56:33] Brethren
[1:56:35] yesterday we were
[1:56:37] screaming crucify him but
[1:56:41] today what can we
[1:56:44] do to be
[1:56:47] saved in other words I'm telling
[1:56:49] you words I'm telling you
[1:56:53] forget what you did yesterday in the
[1:56:57] past look to Jesus this
[1:57:00] morning say what can I do to live better
[1:57:04] from this day
[1:57:10] forward now when they heard this they
[1:57:13] were picked in their heart and said unto
[1:57:18] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[1:57:21] men and Brethren what we
[1:57:24] do therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:57:27] know
[1:57:30] assuredly that God had made this same
[1:57:34] Jesus in
[1:57:36] Christ he wants to be Lord in
[1:57:40] Christ in your
[1:57:44] life then Peter
[1:57:47] said I know your
[1:57:50] past I know the wicked life you've
[1:57:54] lived but today you're
[1:57:57] asking what can I do
[1:57:59] now I say repent and be
[1:58:04] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:58:07] Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:58:10] sins and you shall receive the Holy
[1:58:14] Ghost and you'll begin taking taking
[1:58:19] steps eternal life
[1:58:23] so the purpose of this par
[1:58:25] is have I received the Holy
[1:58:29] Ghost since I
[1:58:31] believe if the answer is
[1:58:33] yes then the my next question is
[1:58:37] this how long has it
[1:58:40] been since you or
[1:58:42] I have received a
[1:58:45] refilling of that blessed Holy
[1:58:48] [Music]

[1:59:00] crucified unto the Jews a stumbling
[1:59:04] block unto the Greeks
[1:59:07] foolishness but unto them which are
[1:59:10] called this morning both Jews and
[1:59:14] Greeks Christ power of God and the
[1:59:17] wisdom of
[1:59:20] God because the foolish n of
[1:59:23] God is wiser than
[1:59:26] men in other words the foolish
[1:59:31] virgin God's
[1:59:34] sheep are
[1:59:36] wiser than the men of this
[1:59:39] world and the weakness of God is
[1:59:43] stronger than
[1:59:45] men in Romans Romans chapter
[1:59:49] 1 will be closing soon

[1:59:57] Christ Our
[1:59:59] Lord which was made of the seed of
[2:00:03] David according to the Flesh and
[2:00:07] declared to be the Son of God with
[2:00:10] power according to the spirit of
