[18:16] I am happy that each one of you has come
[18:22] before our beloved brother Felix comes
[18:24] forward
[18:26] a vessel that is going to be used
[18:28] tonight
[18:30] our Lord Jesus Christ
[18:37] Hebrews 3 12. this is
[18:55] there be any of there be in any of you
[18:59] an evil heart of unbelieving departing
[19:01] from the Living God
[19:07] remember today we're in a day of
[19:09] confusion
[19:11] there are many voices
[19:17] the prophet of God said
[19:22] in his message the voice of God in these
[19:25] last days
[19:28] but even with all those limitations
[19:31] well false voices
[19:34] or false prophets
[19:37] those all those things are not today
[19:41] but Jesus said even then
[19:44] if anyone
[19:46] here's my voice and follows me
[19:50] remember what the word says listen to
[19:54] his Commission
[19:56] that works
[19:58] when you hear my voice
[20:01] today we're here to hear his voice
[20:03] we're here to hear his voice
[20:07] that shows that his voice is going to be
[20:10] there in the midst
[20:11] he still has a voice
[20:14] these boys will stay there forever and
[20:17] it is here Heaven and Earth shall pass
[20:20] but my voice shall never pass
[20:24] again that's why we hear his voice
[20:26] do not Harden your heart
[20:29] today could be your last day
[20:32] today could be the last night
[20:34] the last service
[20:42] listen carefully to what God wants from
[20:44] us
[20:46] something that my Lord likes
[20:49] something that he likes very much is for
[20:52] us to do his will
[20:56] that's what he's looking for
[21:00] the Holy Spirit
[21:02] sometimes we make him sad
[21:05] but today we're here
[21:07] few
[21:11] a small flock
[21:14] but without this card anxious to hear
[21:17] his voice
[21:20] and God has chose a special vessel
[21:23] and that's what we're here for let us
[21:26] receive the word
[21:27] today that our precious brother Felix
[21:31] Felix Flores
[21:36] listen to the voice of Our Lord
[21:40] you could have a very great blessing
[21:46] I'm glad that you came you heard the
[21:48] voice of the Lord
[21:54] this is the vessel that God is going to
[21:56] use today
[21:58] to him May the glory and honor
[22:08] may the Lord bless you brother
[22:12] we're happy to be in the house of the
[22:14] Lord
[22:16] I give thanks to God first of all
[22:20] for allowing us to be here this evening
[22:25] thanks to God and brother Raul for the
[22:27] invitation
[22:29] we are very happy
[22:33] for the brothers that came from Greeley
[22:36] Roberto his wife
[22:43] thanks speak to God for it
[22:45] how many of us are happy
[22:50] let us pray
[22:53] this is our heads
[22:55] beloved God
[22:58] we are happy with you Lord
[23:01] for your infinite
[23:03] that you have given to each one of us
[23:07] we give you thanks Lord
[23:13] bless your children
[23:16] unless each one of them I ask you
[23:18] and Heavenly Father
[23:21] I ask you permission
[23:24] to reach your word
[23:29] give me the inspiration in these short
[23:31] words that I will be speaking
[23:35] identification of our souls
[23:38] we ask at all
[23:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:43] in every evil spirit
[23:49] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[23:53] victory for your church
[23:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:57] amen amen God bless you my name is
[24:38] know that God exists and he is real
[24:43] and God allows us to see his wonders
[24:46] Romans 8 1 it is
[24:49] in the name of the Lord
[24:56] Jesus
[25:01] there is therefore now no connection to
[25:04] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[25:05] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[25:09] City
[25:12] problem
[26:12] uh
[27:18] each year of that lamb
[27:22] of that lamb
[27:26] could only cover their sins and faults
[27:30] you will not erase them
[27:44] to Paradise foreign
[29:18] that's why the word of God says in first
[29:20] Timothy
[29:25] without uh
[29:27] great is the mystery of godliness this
[29:29] is
[29:32] manifested in in flesh
[29:34] deals
[29:40] in a fullness in the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:43] that's right when we see okay
[29:46] the Jesus Christ is baptized
[29:49] the Holy Ghost comes to him
[29:52] and guides him to the desert
[29:57] but God Came To Duel in that Tabernacle
[30:00] in its fullness
[30:03] it was God in Jesus Christ 100 it is
[30:09] that's why when the Lord Jesus Christ is
[30:12] Guided by the spirit to the death
[30:18] and we see that he begins to tempt him
[30:23] and we realize that Jesus Christ Our
[30:25] Lord
[30:26] the prophet tells us
[30:29] Jesus is the US Jesus is
[30:36] Satan eliminated him with any movement
[30:40] but he went to a very simple way
[30:45] that he did that Jesus defeated Satan
[30:47] with the words
[30:50] showing that the Christians the weakest
[30:53] Christian
[30:57] with this very same word of God
[31:00] That Power Authority
[31:03] has been it has been delegated to the
[31:06] church
[31:08] God has delegated it to each one of us
[31:11] that's what when we see here
[31:15] Jesus Christ takes it takes a perfect
[31:17] sacrifice
[31:23] in Hebrews 2 12 this is
[31:38] for as much then as the children are
[31:40] partakers of the Flesh and Blood he also
[31:42] himself thy wise took part of the same
[31:44] that through death he might destroyed
[31:46] him that have the power of death that is
[31:49] the devil the king says
[31:56] verse 15 and deliver them who through
[31:59] fear of death where all their lifetimes
[32:02] subject to bondage
[32:04] that's why we realize that Jesus Christ
[32:09] at the cross
[32:11] the perfect sacrifice
[32:16] will realize when Jesus Christ dies
[32:19] in a certain manner
[32:23] in a certain way the death of the Lord
[32:26] Jesus Christ
[32:29] the most tremendous part was that
[32:31] Gethsemane okay
[32:34] because the Bible says that Jesus wasn't
[32:37] anguished and he was crying
[32:43] if this cup can pass for me but if he's
[32:46] not my will by your will yes
[32:51] he wasn't so much anguish that blood he
[32:54] was uh shredding blood
[32:56] and we realize
[32:58] that God cannot die
[33:30] and Jesus was found alone at that moment
[33:49] his body was left in the grave
[33:53] and his soul who goes to hell
[34:41] but Jesus Christ begins to go down into
[34:44] hell
[34:45] we realize
[34:47] I can't imagine myself
[34:56] because Jesus Christ was descending I
[34:58] can imagine
[35:02] going deep into the darkness
[35:06] and when Jesus
[35:09] [Applause]
[35:13] in the Book of James took Christ
[35:24] and I realize
[35:26] that when Jesus Christ descends
[35:31] it was like a great country
[35:35] and no one could stop him
[35:43] no one couldn't stop the Lord Jesus
[35:47] how many of us believe in God
[35:51] last week
[35:54] they took a lady to a church
[35:58] and when she was sitting at the front
[36:04] and I began to speak what Jesus did when
[36:08] he descended into hell
[36:10] through that woman
[36:15] yeah that screams from Hell came out
[36:19] because Satan and his demons know
[36:23] this moment
[36:26] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[36:33] I get so emotional okay
[36:38] because I know for him that God is real
[36:41] and alive
[36:46] through his word
[36:50] left us a message
[36:53] I can imagine
[36:54] yes
[37:06] through his people
[37:15] I want God to be in me
[37:22] the message
[37:27] his children is a living message
[37:43] God healed her husband
[37:46] she said I had a problem
[37:48] I have a tumor in my head is
[37:52] a very intense pain
[37:55] I need eighty thousand dollars to take
[37:58] it out and I said sister
[38:01] we're gonna pray for you tomorrow and
[38:04] God is going to heal you
[38:08] and we pray to her
[38:12] and foreign
[38:34] she would send me a message
[38:47] United States
[39:04] for illness and God uh backs his word
[39:22] schizophrenia
[39:24] and when they go to the psychiatrist
[39:27] they go to a psychologists
[39:35] because there's a lot of people
[39:38] claim to believe the message and they
[39:41] deny
[39:46] that Jesus Christ
[39:56] is something psychological
[40:00] we have seen many cases
[40:29] it's all been destroyed
[41:31] a lot of things
[42:04] Revelation 1 17.
[42:17] and he laid his right hand upon me
[42:19] saying not to be fear not I am the first
[42:22] and the last yeah
[42:31] and I am he that liveth and what's dead
[42:34] and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen
[42:36] and have the keys of hell and of death
[42:39] I ask myself sometimes
[42:41] people who are
[42:43] ignorante who worship deaths
[42:47] why don't they worship the one who
[42:49] overcame death
[42:52] we worship him
[43:02] and he said because I live We Shall Live
[43:05] also
[43:06] we see that the very same word
[43:09] in the book of Science
[43:25] in Romans 8.
[43:32] the reason foreign
[43:50] there will help escape from him
[43:59] we have escaped from hell yeah
[44:17] the prophet says
[44:23] all of us
[44:27] you would be a
[44:29] the Rapture had already happened
[44:32] but I read something interesting the
[44:35] messenger said
[44:36] foreign
[45:36] foreign
[46:36] know the opening of the seals
[46:40] when the lamb stands up
[46:42] around the place of intercession
[46:47] no one else would be safe anymore
[47:03] Jesus Christ
[47:08] we are waiting for him
[47:51] lose the essence of the transformation
[47:53] of our bodies
[47:55] foreign
[48:55] is
[49:59] but doesn't take away
[50:11] Jesus Christ
[50:16] has Justified our past
[50:19] we are in justification
[50:22] there's people who sometimes
[50:26] get baptized when I stop doing these
[50:28] things
[50:43] will you baptize the man who smokes
[50:48] that is a problem with the preachers
[51:10] when he descended everything was because
[51:12] of us
[51:34] of the Lamb
[51:40] when you are under the blood not
[51:43] I mean
[51:44] I know that all of us understand
[51:47] in the message adoption
[51:50] the prophet says
[51:53] many times
[51:57] and tomorrow I'm safe
[52:00] tomorrow
[52:03] we know that we have a message
[52:06] we know that we are in in the climax and
[52:11] the messenger said this is
[52:15] you cannot get lost
[52:28] if God called us before nation of the
[52:30] world
[52:42] the happiness
[53:13] he is
[53:17] the matter is fixed it was concluded
[53:22] there is no condemnation this is
[53:55] the religious world
[54:00] he wants to give salvation
[54:07] to make give main salvation through
[54:10] fasting through prayer
[54:50] with Jesus Christ
[55:21] who conquered the world at 33 years old
[56:23] Jesus Christ
[56:26] community
[56:36] don't be afraid
[56:43] you are Heirs of everything
[56:48] Cristiano
[56:55] look at the Moon
[56:58] who created that our creator
[57:03] Lord is it possible that's mine too
[57:07] everything is
[57:11] ourselves
[57:28] because everything has been given to me
[57:33] if Satan put something in the church is
[57:36] fear foreign
[58:31] I know that all of us have a lot of
[58:34] testimonies
[58:37] foreign
[58:51] [Music]
[1:00:11] that's why we realize
[1:00:15] this is
[1:00:18] the Lord says
[1:00:49] foreign
[1:01:50] all the members of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:59] foreign my
[1:03:19] foreign
[1:03:41] but love and courage and ability all
[1:03:43] power is given unto me and in this years
[1:03:46] to use you speak the word and I will
[1:03:47] perform it that is my Covenant and it
[1:03:50] can never failure
[1:03:56] the greatest thing that I find against
[1:03:58] the church tonight is
[1:04:05] to fear about something
[1:04:07] let me tell you
[1:04:10] we're a group personas of people
[1:04:16] maybe some of us
[1:04:22] if I die who's going to take care of my
[1:04:25] children
[1:04:27] and if tomorrow I don't have work
[1:04:29] anymore what am I gonna do
[1:04:31] and if I get sick
[1:04:33] there's a lot of fears going around but
[1:04:37] there's one who tells us not to fear
[1:04:39] okay
[1:04:40] because he will be with us until the end
[1:04:43] of the world
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:53] if a man has been born again
[1:04:57] he should be happy and not worry
[1:05:01] like this man saying yes
[1:05:27] we know that God takes control of Our
[1:05:30] Lives
[1:05:33] you have control of tomorrow you have
[1:05:36] control of tonight
[1:06:50] you know
[1:07:10] that's why the prophet said
[1:07:12] no
[1:08:17] the brothers
[1:08:20] the denominational Brothers
[1:08:24] sometimes they want to be safe
[1:08:26] through fasting through watching
[1:08:30] it's a great long prayers
[1:08:46] to Jesus give us that
[1:09:48] there's hundreds or thousands foreign
[1:10:16] e
[1:10:19] fficiently
[1:10:20] yes
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:35] somebody give they contact us through
[1:10:38] other people
[1:10:40] and we know thousands of cases
[1:10:48] every day at night
[1:10:52] I
[1:11:08] get happy and I said brother sister
[1:11:17] foreign
[1:12:39] Eternal God
[1:12:42] let us pray
[1:12:45] let us pray
[1:12:49] I don't understand where you're at
[1:12:52] any trouble you may have place it before
[1:12:55] the Lord at this moment
[1:12:57] many people have called me and told me
[1:13:04] where I was sitting at
[1:13:07] we have the word
[1:13:09] we don't have just anything we have the
[1:13:12] word
[1:13:13] Jesus Christ is the midst of us
[1:13:15] one day we will
[1:13:20] disappeared
[1:13:23] in His Holy Spirit
