TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen God bless you shall I be seated God bless you for to church I you say whenever we come here put his in our mind we are come to meet God not a person it's not a preacher you have to put it in your mind I'm going to meet my maker I'm grateful for God I thank him for the strength and I thank the pastor also for the opportunity given to me to share the word of God with you today all that we say God bless him and I'm praying and trusting on God that God through me will be a blessing to you this morning God bless you church now I used to like talking about David I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord because why because when we go to the house of the God we go to meet our maker we go to meet our Lord Jesus Christ and if there's something troubling us or if there's something that we need then we place it before God then God do it for us then God do it for us it's like your father is a king and your father owns everything and you are in a different land and you in a different land and you are in trouble all that you need to do is to come to your father and tell him father I'm in need of this and our father is the Lord Jesus Christ and he's able to provide unto us he said his resources his resources resources are Unlimited No used to say sometimes some of us we Christians we used to behave like the little fish in the ocean saying saying to itself I don't want to drink too much of the ocean if I drink too much the ocean is going to get dry up and that how sometime we used we also used to think fish in the ocean drank drink all the ocean so we don't to limit God we need to go to God when there's a trouble and drink as much as you can drink ask as much as you can ask for because the resources are for us the resources the blessings are for us he said these signs shall follow them that believe who who me and you we are the one who have believed the word of the day now let's quickly open our Bible no this has been a common scripture this has been a common scripture and we have talked about it every day and every day but I want us to look it at another angle shall We rise to our feet Romans chapter 12 verse one and two and I read I besch ye therefore Breen by the mercies of God that ye present your body a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reason service and be not conformed to this world but by it transform by the renewing of your [Music] mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God shall we pray oh heav most high God by virt of Education have been able to read Thy word but father their interpretation lies in your hand come and interpret and Reve thyself once again unto us there many in Jesus name pray with Thanksgiving amen amen shall be [Music] SE we're looking at what to the people of Romans the people in Roman he started with we started with begging themg so you there for Bren now there is something for us that we are supposed to do if you call oursel Christians said that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice acceptable unto God which is our reasonable service but I was thinking throughout the whole week and I was saying that if you don't know who you are and where you came from you are going to leave your life any way and you are going to live your life like the people of the world you will live and do the things they do but you come to the recognition that I'm not like those people of the world I'm not like those people yeah but I'm a special person created God created by God then you start to live a life of that sort and that he said when you read the verse two it was telling we should not conform to the world but should be transformed but this transformation how you to renew your mind the question what are you going to renew your mind with you can only renew your mind with the truth of God because it's the truth of God that can change your mind from the mind or the things of the [Music] world and bring you to the position for you to know who you are preach a certain message entitled it Amnesia and he said this dise called Amnesia you know if you he doesn't let you recognize who you are and as long as you don't recognize who you are you do things at how people would tell you and say it is the most worst disease in the world is the most worst disease in the world worst disease the most terrible disease it's that you don't know who you are and you don't know what happens to you and people have to give you instruction how to live your life but he said that is fine but he said there is nothing worse than being spiritually [Music] Amnesia that you know who you are and don't know your purpose of God on Earth you know over the weeks we look at how man fell from the original because the devil begot them as we saw the other time and we saw how God said I'll put emity between thy seed and the woman's [Music] seed let me go back a little said the devil wanted to be equal with God from the beginning so in heaven he tried to gather angels to be on his side elate himself to be equal to God and by and so he wanted to of God's creation in other ways but Michael the Archangel with other some few Angels some few angels fought to overcome him and God thrw him down on Earth the devil was not done yet he wanted to have dominion he wanted to have dominion he wanted to be a ruler so he find a way he find a way to put his nature or to bring his nature onto this Earth why because God said let us create create man in his own image me it means that if God created us in his own image then we are too bound to live like God and behave like God and the devil doesn't want that yeah they don't want him but there is no way for the devil to infiltrate the human race there was no way for the devil to enter into the human [Music] race so he decided to use the serpent and through the woman brought his seed on in this world so now came the seed and the woman seed but say something I love so much he said that was not out of the program of God then somebody will say if God know that the devil cause all this harm if God knows that the devil do all this harm why don't God kill him why did God created him why didn't God kill him so that he solve the problem that is fine it is a good thinking but the question is if there was no sickness what has been the importance of a doctor onto us so God had something and those things that God had those that God had the things that God had were his attributes and God wanted to show his attribute onto man brother said in the beginning God was not God he was just a self-existing one and decided that okay and he decided I want to be a God then I have to get people to worship me so he created man but in the thought of God in the thought of God he still wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a provider he wanted to be a deliverer but how can God be a deliver if there's no one for God to deliver so now there was nothing outside the plan of God somebody said if God is God then when when he came to the Garden he asked Adam where are you he said God knows everything he supposed to know Adam is wrong he supposed to know Adam is wrong so why is he asking so why is he asking Adam where are you said when God took the form of a man he acted like a man so that man could understand him that it is possible for a man to live in this flesh and and still serve God know sometime people say no we can't be perfect we can't be we can't do the right thing there's nobody who is here there's nobody who is right on this Earth there's nobody who is right or who can that is fine but that's what they believe said Christ was crucified and he took off your imperfection that you may be perfect that's why the song composer said the song composer said by myself I cannot but with God it is possible so God wanting us to know that is possible when he came to the process of Salvation he didn't just an angel but he took a form of a flesh and he went through the natural that we go through to tell us that to tell us that it is possible for us to serve God In the Flesh you know today I want to talk about something and maybe one way the other have heard it before but my emphasis is not what I'm com to talk about but my emphasis is to see yourself in what I'm com to talk about because if you're able to see yourself in the word of God then you know how to act and behave and I like to talk about predestination that God for forew us before the foundation of this Earth was laid that God for us before the foundation of the was no sometime people think it was like if God is God as people used to say and if if God knows everything then why does this thing happen to people one thing I want to know let you know so God knows the beginning and he knows the end and he know whatever that is going on I want to read something from my Note said did you know that God forew all things from the very beginning and that he forew each and every one of us even before the foundation of the world so before we me and you were born God knew us God knew us and God has positionally God has positionally choosen us for his work for his work there have been nothing that has been outside the plan of God everything was just going as how God has planned it but for me and you we have to ask ourself which part of the plan of God am I playing you just that and you need to have to get that you need to get that idea of the part that you are playing so that you could act well so that you could do it and do it to the best Abraham said whatever you do be the best so but how can you be the best when you don't know who you are you know we have come to a point there a lot of Christians don't know who they are and they are following how some people are living their life and they are impersonating how people live their life they are impersonating but the Christian Life don't have to be that way because God has called each and everyone for a different purpose and a different plan and a different way so we have to come to the point and ask ourselves what is the plan of God for my [Music] life and you have to search for that plan of God for your life you have to search for [Music] it and have you have to ask God for direction so that you don't be outside the plan of God so that you don't try to do something on your own but you all the time stick to what God has given to you so that you all the time stick to what God has given to you and bring everything out for the for the edification of the body of Christ you know most Christians are just learning from people they are just copying from their friends so they get fed up they get fed up fed up they get tired is because if I met God or BR Martin met God Martin or Pastor go God will direct him towards a certain line and because I saw bra Mar going that line because I saw bra going this way I was like okay let me let me follow him but he has seen something and God has directed him in that way so you also have to come to that point to see God for yourself said every man who call himself a Christian should make sure that you have that experience that encounter with God and he know God himself so that his life would not come and be like do and don't so that yeah don't do this do that you won't be somebody telling you to do something but you have seen something you have had an encounter with God and it's because of that encounter that's why you are behaving that way and we all want to behave in a certain way because we have had an encounter with God so that we don't go around copying each other but we live our lifestyle as Christ has directed us because if God has predestined destined me and you then he have different work for me and you but I work all together from the body of Christ so my question you have to ask yourself is which part of the body of Christ am I am I the hand of Christ or am I the mouth of Christ you just imagine that the two hands decide okay they also want to be leg how the life of the human being how will our life be that your two hands they decide to join your legs we should just see ourself as the human body that that how the body of that how the body of Christ is that each and everyone is complimentary to the other compl the yeah yeah to the other and we together form the body of Christ I'm reading something for Ephesians 1 5-6 say that God said God has PR destined us according to the good pleasure of his will God has predestined us according to the good pleasure of his [Music] will that means God has something on his heart and God has predestined me and you for that to praise to praise and glory of his grace that that is what God has chosen me and you for so our lifestyle so through our lifestyle the praise of God the glorification of God should be seen know somebody say ask for me I'm not sure God knows me I'm not sure even if they are talking about the child of God I'm part I'm not sure if they talking about the child of God I'm part there are about eight billion people in the world there are about eight billion people in the world how can God know me I'm just one little tiny of the El I'm just one little person in the I'm almostly in significance among the N billion people or the8 billion people and that how sometimes us think and say one time Peter asked Jesus you know Jesus we have been following you we have been following you let let me ask you today let me ask we have left all our family our business that give us a lot of money our business that give us a lot of money and everything and has followed you what will you give us and he said are not your price are not your price are not your price is your price yeah so is another way are you not more valuable [Music] than the sparrow of the air the sparrow the B the best on the on the the don't Farm they don't Farm they don't Farm yeah they they don't work but I feed them and I know every little one of them how much more you even best animals God know their number God knows their number how much more me and you who was created in the image of God God knows everybody I'm reading from Romans 8:30 Romans 8 say whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he has called then he also justify and whom he justified then he also glorified 30 8 vers 3 so God has called us is he first forew us and if you know our setting before this day he know our set how today before the day started happening that's the reason why the day the day the day the word religious body the word religious Body Challenge before the [Music] challenge he told them you are going to book this Hotel you have gone to book this hotel you have this hotel yeah but you won't get this hotel you are going to get this going to get this hotel and you you will be in this you will be in this shirt you wear this this will be the color of your shirt so okay you you will sit here and this person also will sit here and they so this man is a false prophet oh a liar there is no way in the United States of America they we will make a reservation and we go and not get it so as the time the day got when they got there the hotel people told them that we are sorry before you made a reservation somebody has already done that so the person has occupied that we can't give that to you so the man decided to go around look for a different hotel and he went around and he went round and he didn't get any other Hotel than H than what the prophet said he he said he didn't care so the time reach the time came and the prophet came and he stood before the pit he said come to me with no other book come to me with no other book with no other book apart from the Bible other book come to me with no other book other book book yeah yeah no other book apart from the Bible other book yeah and and as they sat there and Bam stood before the [Music] pulit the man stood up he said before before he speak I have something to say before today this man he told me I'll sit here I'll wear this color you you will be here you do this and the other people will be here and the others two will sit here and that is the position we are you told me I will not get that reservation it is because it is because we were with God we were with God from the beginning and as long as man stand at the original position of being with God he knows what happens ahead because he's the state of being a man God he's in the state of being a man God so you could tell them whatever is going to happen so if me and you could search search and look for where where where God has placed us will be a great tool for God did you know that it was God's per will for him to come to this world yeah it's strange but it's true because God wanted to demonstrate his attribute to mankind his attributes God himself wanted to be glorified he could not be glorified as a savior if there was nobody to be saved in the first place he can't be he cannot be a savior if there is nobody to be saved if there was no man in the Fallen State then there is no need for Redemption so God allowed that to happen in order for him to be God he knew from the very beginning who will be saved and who will not be saved God was not willing that anyone should perish God was not willing for anyone to perish yeah God wished all of us will be saved but God didn't force man in making decision but God created man on a free moral agency that man could make a decision for himself God was not willing that any should perish but that all might come to repentance but he being infinite knowing the end from the beginning created man on a free moral agency created man on a free moral agency um free free moral agency and um [Music] that man could make decision for himself so after creating creating them he knew that I've given this man fre more agency this person would decide to pass this direction the other person will decide to go this way so God knew from the beginning who will be saved and who will not be saved God didn't create any man and willingly and willingly or wishing that that man should perish but God he wished all men will be saved all men will come to repentance but God gave the decision to man that man have to make the decision of where to pass or who to choose and that's the reason why when the when the vision when the vision came from the brothers he they told Brother Abraham said because of this momentous decision it was a decision so the Christian Life is a decision you need to make a decision you need to tell yourself from today onwards I want God to be my king I want God to rule my life I want God to Lead Me I want God in every business I'm doing it is a decision God is there but he's waiting for you for you to allow him to operate it's like it's like the message bar preach he said doors in door he said do IND door say some of us some of us we open the entrance door for God to enter in we open the door for God to enter in but within within within yeah we have doors and we decide which one we have to open to God so some of us will say some of us will say for my business I want God to take over but for my marriage life I want to handle it myself it's a decision God is powerful he could have forced you to do it but no God created man with a free moral ageny that you have the choice you have the choice or the chance to make a decision he said I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door then I will come in so if God is not coming in then we have locked the door God is still knocking so the question how long long have God been knocking at your door we just need to Avail ourself give give the opportunity for God to take control of our life so that our life will completely be be not how we live it but it will be as how God want it it will be as how God wanted and you go singing the song it is no longer I live it but it is Christ in me that lives and that is the point we need to come in Christianity and that is the reason why you need to have to get the knowledge that you have been predestined by God and you have been destined by God in this end time and you have been destined to be the bride of Christ Jesus and for to be the bride of Christ this say you need to live a certain life you need to cover yourself a certain way you need to speak in a certain way and how to clothe yourself how to clothe yourself or how to cover yourself God has given us a way when you go back to the we had one great king called hazus we had one great king called hazus one yeah we had a great king called hazus yeah called hazus in the Book of Esther we had a king called aaz aers you just continue like that they had a great [Music] king and this great king a wife called vity he had a wife called [Music] vity and this wife when the King was in need of the wife she was be she was busy with other females with other with other females females with the matters of the world with the matters of the world and AOS being a king and said was a typology of Jesus Christ and this are [Music] hos his wife vity told her I won't come I won't come won and said it pain azus it pained azus it pained him and the Seven messenger called Muk Muk he said let the king put his wife away and let them let us get him another king and say and they gather all the virgins in the city that's the reason the Bible talk about the 10 virgins in the New Testament but within the Virgin some were foolish and some were [Music] wise and said they came they said they came to a for them to appear before the king they came a time for them to appear before the king so a Time came they have to come before the king so the king will make a new choice of who to be his wife and the King has an infinite resources I had an infinite resources and he said dress yourself any way you like it [Music] he gave them the will to make the decision what they want to [Music] wear BR said some of them came and they added a lot of eyelashes some of them came and so for my dress cut it for it so that all my body will be showing yes they qualify to be part of the virgins they qualify to be part of the virgins they qualified to be part of the virgins and this Esther was also part of them so everybody was saying oh me I like that me I like to do this way but when go to the time of Esther he went to the personal assistant of the king he said dress me give me the clothes that the king want and he dressed in the par the king want they look at him what kind of dressing is this you are not modern at all you are not modern at all yeah why all this Shir look at your dress oh no you a lady you need to look more than paint your face paint your face have some eyelashes you a guy you a guy you a guy a guy like me you need to get some drink go to the Beer have fun why this boring this you the time boring you all the time boring you are bringing your boring also to here oh at least at least you have come to me I would have got you some nice dress for you to put on but no problem it's not too late you remove that dress you are wearing put put that word of God that you are holding put that word of God that you are holding put it put it aside oh that's one don't believe ask for every they saying the Bible the Bible the Bible don't mind them don't mind them come and let me tell you something remove that dress and I have something for you and that how some of some of our friends are they try to advise us out of the word of God out of the will of God to their own ideas I said it happened in the Bible they all Ming they all Ming the they all complaining about Esther so you should not be worried when you are living the Christian Life and the people are complaining about you but the question is you have wear your shirt you have wear your shirt or your dress and I wear mine and iar what is your problem so in means there is something unique about what you are doing there is something unique about what you are doing unique or special about what you are doing there's something unique or special about what you are doing you know all the time the people want you to behave like them that is the reason why the government the government will be burning churches burning ban put a b a sanction on [Music] churches and then B religious activities we have come to a point we have come to a point that in our schools God has been taken out completely they don't talk about God anymore all the foolishness of the world has been packed there and our children our brothers our sisters are been taught those stuff in the school I taught those stuff in the school and when somebody is standing from God yeah you see all these people against that that one person against that one person standing for God it didn't start today it started they all records in the Bible so he shouldn't be discouraged you should be worried you should be worried parent parent parent don't let the schools the people of the world determine how your children should live their life God is going to have you responsible for them it is not those over there if you go to the school and they don't want you to treat your children to live a Christian Life get them out of their school and place them something somewhere different said and Jesus said it is better for us to be PL away than to rot in damnation it is better for your eyes to be PL away PL away taken off than to rot in the hell of fire parent let's be serious with our children you know God is going to hold us accountable for them hold us accountable for them he said children are a gift from God and God is going to H us responsible we have to ask ourselves how are we treating our children we yeah and we have to know how we have to train them with the word of God because God is going to head us responsible for how we train them and don't don't don't let some friends of yours try to try to tell you how you should train your children make sure you are training your children to put Christ in them [Music] you are giving them that Envision for them to know God for themselves Moses mother trained Moses for him to know the truth concerning himself matter train him about the truth concerning himself and about [Music] his know the truth about himself and that is what parents we need to doent need to train their that they will learn to seek after God so that when they when they they grow they won't be tossed up by the foolishness of the world because Christ has already been implanted in them so they will their life as Christians where is the next Generation going the whole failing the home is failing parents are not doing anything anymore they are busy with work they busy with work no time for their children no devotion in the house no devotion in the house devotion [Music] no Bible studies in the house there is nothing about about God in the house he's busy busy busy everybody's running his life and this is how we lose their children we lose them to those people in their schools then they indoctrinate our children they indoctrinate our children withness of the world with the nonsense out there brothers sisters we to stand for the word of God and you have to make sure that the young the Next Generation we are bringing also stand for God it does itend with us it doesn't end with us the younger generation need to stand from God and we need to teach them we need to PR in our plan that we are going to make sure they know God for themselves and when they know God fors this done then it's done because they now know God for themselves but don't be worried when you are trying to train your children after God and the people are against you they were against Esther they were against Esther and what did to he the personal assistant of God she asked the personal assistant of God dress me as the king desire and she she didn't she didn't discourage himself by the seeing of his [Music] friends and said when the king saw her Esther found fever in the eyes of the king and in this age we also have had an a personal assistant to God and that is the prophet of this age and he has the clothing that is desired by God and that clothing is the message of the hour all that we need to do is to clothe ourself in the message of the hour so that when God see us we will find favor in the eyes of God so we shouldn't be worried and we should be scared about what is happening we shouldn't try to look like them you know AIA they another hot they are not hot or cold but the seventh messenger message the seventh messenger message is is to take us from love this to The Brighter age he said my people come out of them come out of them we are the people of God God forew us before the foundation of the earth God knew us before the foundation of that is the reason why when man fell God could not hold himself on his seat God could not hold himself on the his seat yeah hold himself on his seat on his throne God could not stay on his throne so the point that he came down himself to PVE a way of redemption to restore man back to the original position in his original creation and he took God himself and he came to redeem so the word redeem is to take back and place it at the original position originally we were with God and something happened and God came back to pave a way for us to come back to him because there was no one worthy there was no one perfect to be able to atone for our sins because everybody was corrupt and every man everything was in the falling State Abraham said when man fell the the whole generation of creation went under that state and now there was nothing that will atone for the sin of man atone for the sin of man or that could be as a sacrifice for the sin of man so God have to leave his throne and come to the word through a virgin bed come yeah to take upon himself the sin all our sin and crucify it on Calvary and take the whole creation from the Fallen state to the original position and he said if you now accept the atonement if you now accept the sacrifice then you are of God then you of God you are of God so God made the provided way and redeem man never think God don't know what he's going on never think God don't know what is going on never think or don't think God don't know what is going on you know when Moses went to Pharaoh Pharaoh he said Pharaoh let my people go and he said why why should I let them go and Moses put his his his rod down he place his rod and he turned into snake and Pharaoh laughed and he called James and jambres his two magicians and he also put the rod now and he also put also put the rod down and also he turned to snake and he was laughing he said oh Moses look at how go how small your God is and when Moses was done Moses was worried that he didn't go Pharaoh didn't let the people of God go and he went to God and so God told him don't worry it is me that has hardened the heart of pharaoh so that my people will see my power so that I can deliver my people with a strong hand so God knows what you are going through so what we are going through God knows see yeah so don't be worried just go to God Moses was just worried but he said no don't be worried I'm the Lord who Harden the heart of pharaoh we can even run back to the book of H Romans 13 chapter 5 to look at something R Romans 13 let me let me start from the verse 11 yeah 13 for the children being not yet born 1311 oh Romans 911 rather sorry 911 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to El might stand not of works but of him that call it it it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I love but Esau I hated before they were born so it means God God knew you before you were born because I said ear God created man on a fre moral AG God created man on a free moral agency and he knowing the end from the beginning know the kind of choice and decision every man will make before the foundation of this so we should not be worried but we should count ourself happy and privileged to find ourself to be part of the plan of God because to some people the gospel is hidden to there some people the Bible is not important but it was it said in the Scripture it is hidden to them that are lost but we are privileged we are not lost God has indeed been grateful unto us God has been indeed grateful unto us being grateful onto us for selecting us for predestiny us in his plan of work onto salvation so if somebody is being so wicked if somebody is being so wicked yeah don't be worried it is in the plan of God it's just for the glorification of God oh when you see gazing lesan going on gazing lesbianism transgender all those stuff going on don't be worried he's just carrying a message he just carrying a message that we are close to the end Believers Believers brothers sisters let's hold to the message of the hour let's go to the word of this day it is only by that word that we can overcome this morning I came to tell you that you are d ined you are destined destined destined predestined as as the children of God you not all of us I want you to see that it's you you that God has predestined and to recognize yourself from today that you are a child of God and you have called to live a certain life on this Earth and that God is there to support you and God is here to provide all everything you need for you I mean you I mean you not the next fellow not the next fellow he said work at your own Serv salvation with fear and trembling salvation is an individual Affair and everybody has a different task given to him by God to some God has called them to be preachers to some teachers to some singers everybody have to know what is his position in Christ Jesus so that we play our part accordingly we have to ask ourselves the question what is my position in the body of Christ if God predestined me before the foundation of this Earth was laid then what work has God predestined me for I don't have the answer for you but I know a man who can and that man is Jesus Christ all that you need to speak to him so oh Lord today this is what I have heard this is what I've have heard head I'm part of your children that you have a certain work for me God I don't know the kind of work you have for me I don't know the kind of work you had for me yeah have oh God reveal to me oh Lord open my eyes for me to see so that I will be able to serve you well no preach a certain message and he titled it and he titled it he titled it yeah trying to do God a service without his will so that you won't be doing service for God but is not in the will of God that's the reason why each and every one of us to make sure to know our calling to know our calling and the purpose of our calling and the purpose of our call so that we may serve God diligently this morning I came to tell you that you were in the plan of God you were in the mind of God and everything God have is for you because whatever Christ Jesus have is for the wife of Christ Jesus so if you need healing go for it if you need something go for it I used to tell it is for you don't think it's for some other brother no often times Christians are good of telling people God will do this for you but they fa to see that God is doing this for me you have to realize and see what God is doing for you and be praising God for what he's doing for you praising God for what he's doing for you and be waiting for what God will do for you so you are praising you are working for God you are waiting for what God will do for you and you are living your life and if you are doing this and if you are doing this if you are doing it like this the Christian life becomes simple because you are not doing anything oh God I cannot stop drinking God I've tried my best but God from today but God from today I want you to take over from me help me to overcome and God is going to help you so oh God for me so

of your body and I need to be bring glorification onto you and God I can't do it myself and God I can't do it myself God I'm asking for your help to help me that's how we have to approach God and God is going to grant us whatever we need it's just you have to ask oh don't think oh somebody is going to hear of what I'm going through don't care about what who is standing next to you or who is going to listen to your prayer I say should be between you and God it's not about you and the preacher man it's not about you and the pastor it's about you and God and you have to make sure that that relationship is being settled my brothers my sisters you I can't help you nobody can I can't do anything I can shout the best I can shout but I can't do anything to help your salvation the only person
