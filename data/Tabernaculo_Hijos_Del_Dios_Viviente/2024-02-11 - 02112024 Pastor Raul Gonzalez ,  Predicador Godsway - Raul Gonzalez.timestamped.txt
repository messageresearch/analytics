[0:24] church I you say whenever we come
[0:28] here put his in our mind we are come to
[0:31] meet
[0:33] God not a
[0:36] person it's not a
[0:39] preacher you have to put it in your
[0:42] mind I'm going to meet my
[0:47] maker I'm grateful for
[0:51] God I thank him for the
[0:55] strength and I thank the pastor
[0:58] also for the opportunity given to
[1:02] me to share the word of God with you
[1:07] today all that we say God bless
[1:11] him and I'm
[1:13] praying and trusting on
[1:15] God that God through me will be a
[1:18] blessing to you this
[1:22] morning God bless you
[1:25] church now I used to like talking about
[1:28] David I was
[1:31] glad when they said unto me let us go
[1:34] into the house of the
[1:36] Lord because
[1:38] why because when we go to the house of
[1:40] the
[1:41] God we go to meet our
[1:44] maker we go to meet our Lord Jesus
[1:47] Christ and if there's something
[1:49] troubling
[1:54] us or if there's something that we
[1:57] need then we place it before God
[2:00] then God do it for us then God do it for
[2:04] us it's like your father is a
[2:07] king and your father owns
[2:11] everything and you are in a different
[2:13] land and you in a different
[2:17] land and you are in
[2:20] trouble all that you need to do is to
[2:24] come to your father and tell him father
[2:28] I'm in need of this
[2:30] and our
[2:31] father is the Lord Jesus
[2:34] Christ and he's
[2:36] able to provide unto us he said his
[2:41] resources his
[2:44] resources
[2:46] resources are
[2:49] Unlimited No used to
[2:51] say sometimes some of us we
[2:55] Christians we used to behave like the
[2:57] little fish in the
[2:58] ocean
[3:02] saying saying to
[3:05] itself I don't want to drink too much of
[3:07] the
[3:09] ocean if I drink too much the ocean is
[3:12] going to get dry
[3:15] up and that how sometime we used we also
[3:17] used to
[3:19] think fish in the
[3:22] ocean drank drink all the
[3:25] ocean so we don't to limit
[3:28] God we need to go to
[3:31] God when there's a
[3:33] trouble and drink as much as you can
[3:38] drink ask as much as you can ask
[3:41] for because the resources are for
[3:48] us the
[3:50] resources the blessings are for us he
[3:53] said these signs shall follow them that
[3:56] believe who who me and you we are the
[4:01] one who have believed the word of the
[4:04] day now let's quickly open our
[4:08] Bible no this has been a common
[4:12] scripture this has been a common
[4:15] scripture and we have talked about it
[4:17] every day and every
[4:20] day but I want us to look it at another
[4:26] angle shall We rise to our feet
[4:33] Romans chapter
[4:37] 12 verse one and
[4:58] two
[5:04] and I
[5:07] read I besch ye therefore
[5:14] Breen by the mercies of God that ye
[5:17] present your body a Living
[5:22] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[5:27] God which is your reason
[5:31] service and be not conformed to this
[5:37] world but by it transform by the
[5:40] renewing of your
[5:42] [Music]
[5:44] mind that you may prove what is that
[5:50] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[5:55] God shall we
[5:57] pray oh heav most high
[6:00] God by virt of Education have been able
[6:04] to read Thy
[6:06] word but father their interpretation
[6:09] lies in your
[6:12] hand come and interpret and Reve thyself
[6:16] once again unto
[6:20] us there many in Jesus name pray with
[6:27] Thanksgiving amen amen
[6:30] shall be
[6:33] [Music]
[6:37] SE we're looking at what to the people
[6:41] of Romans the people in
[6:46] Roman he started with we started with
[6:49] begging
[6:52] themg so you there for
[6:57] Bren now there is something for us that
[7:01] we are supposed to do if you call oursel
[7:06] Christians said that you present your
[7:09] body as a Living
[7:15] Sacrifice
[7:17] acceptable unto
[7:21] God which is our reasonable
[7:24] service but I was thinking throughout
[7:27] the whole week
[7:30] and I was saying that if you don't know
[7:31] who you
[7:33] are and where you came from you are
[7:36] going to leave your life any
[7:39] way and you are going to live your life
[7:41] like the people of the
[7:43] world you will live and do the things
[7:46] they
[7:48] do but you come to the
[7:52] recognition that I'm not like those
[7:54] people of the world I'm not like those
[7:57] people yeah
[8:01] but I'm a special
[8:05] person created God created by God then
[8:11] you start to live a life of that
[8:14] sort and that he said when you read the
[8:17] verse
[8:19] two it was telling we should not conform
[8:21] to the
[8:24] world but should be
[8:27] transformed but this transformation how
[8:30] you to renew your
[8:33] mind the question what are you going to
[8:36] renew your mind
[8:39] with you can only renew your mind with
[8:42] the truth of
[8:45] God because it's the truth of God that
[8:48] can change your mind from the mind or
[8:50] the things of the
[8:53] [Music]
[8:55] world and bring you to the position for
[8:58] you to know who you
[9:04] are preach a certain
[9:07] message entitled it
[9:11] Amnesia and he said this dise called
[9:16] Amnesia you know if you he doesn't let
[9:19] you recognize who you
[9:22] are and as long as you don't recognize
[9:24] who you
[9:26] are you do things at how people would
[9:29] tell
[9:31] you and say it is the most worst disease
[9:35] in the
[9:36] world is the most worst disease in the
[9:40] world worst disease the most terrible
[9:43] disease
[9:47] it's that you don't know who you
[9:50] are and you don't know what happens to
[9:53] you and people have to give you
[9:55] instruction how to live your
[9:58] life
[9:59] but he said that is
[10:01] fine but he said there is nothing worse
[10:04] than being spiritually
[10:07] [Music]
[10:10] Amnesia that you know who you
[10:13] are and don't know your purpose of God
[10:16] on
[10:19] Earth you know over the
[10:23] weeks we look at how man
[10:26] fell from the original
[10:31] because the devil begot them as we saw
[10:33] the other
[10:35] time and we saw how God
[10:40] said I'll put emity between thy seed and
[10:43] the woman's
[10:46] [Music]
[10:48] seed let me go back a
[10:51] little said the devil wanted to be equal
[10:55] with God from the
[10:58] beginning so in
[11:01] heaven he tried to gather angels to be
[11:03] on his
[11:06] side elate himself to be equal to
[11:12] God and by and so he wanted to of God's
[11:16] creation in other
[11:20] ways but Michael the
[11:23] Archangel with other some few
[11:26] Angels some few angels
[11:31] fought to overcome
[11:33] him and God thrw him down on
[11:38] Earth the devil was not done
[11:41] yet he wanted to have
[11:44] dominion he wanted to have
[11:47] dominion he wanted to be a
[11:50] ruler so he find a way he find a
[11:55] way to put his nature
[11:59] or to bring his
[12:00] nature onto this
[12:03] Earth
[12:05] why because God said let us create
[12:09] create man in his own
[12:11] image me it means that if God created us
[12:15] in his own
[12:18] image then we are too bound to live like
[12:23] God and behave like
[12:26] God and the devil doesn't want
[12:30] that yeah they don't want
[12:35] him but there is no way for the devil to
[12:38] infiltrate the human
[12:40] race there was no way for the devil to
[12:42] enter into the human
[12:44] [Music]
[12:45] race so he decided to use the
[12:49] serpent and through the
[12:52] woman brought his seed on in this
[12:56] world so now
[13:00] came the seed and the woman
[13:05] seed but say something I love so
[13:09] much he said that was not out of the
[13:13] program of
[13:15] God then somebody will
[13:17] say if God know that the devil cause all
[13:20] this harm if God knows that the devil do
[13:23] all this
[13:27] harm
[13:30] why don't God kill
[13:32] him why did God created
[13:36] him why didn't God kill him so that he
[13:40] solve the
[13:42] problem that is fine it is a good
[13:46] thinking but the question
[13:48] is if there was no
[13:51] sickness what has been the importance of
[13:54] a doctor onto
[13:56] us so God had something
[14:00] and those things that God had those that
[14:03] God had the things that God
[14:06] had were his
[14:09] attributes and God wanted to show his
[14:12] attribute onto
[14:15] man brother said in the beginning God
[14:19] was not God he was just a self-existing
[14:24] one and decided that okay and he decided
[14:29] I want to be a God then I have to get
[14:32] people to worship
[14:34] me so he created
[14:37] man but in the thought of God in the
[14:41] thought of God he still wanted to be a
[14:45] savior he wanted to be a
[14:48] Healer he wanted to be a provider he
[14:51] wanted to be a
[14:52] deliverer but how can God be a deliver
[14:55] if there's no one for God to
[14:57] deliver so now there was nothing outside
[15:00] the plan of
[15:02] God somebody said if God is God then
[15:06] when when he came to the
[15:08] Garden he asked
[15:11] Adam where are
[15:14] you he said God knows everything he
[15:18] supposed to know Adam is
[15:19] wrong he supposed to know Adam is
[15:23] wrong so why is he
[15:25] asking so why is he asking Adam where
[15:29] are
[15:32] you
[15:34] said when God took the form of a
[15:38] man he acted like a
[15:41] man so that man could understand him
[15:45] that it is
[15:46] possible for a man to live in this flesh
[15:51] and and still serve
[15:54] God know sometime people
[15:57] say no we can't be
[15:59] perfect we can't be we can't do the
[16:01] right thing there's nobody who is here
[16:05] there's nobody who is right on this
[16:07] Earth there's nobody who is right or who
[16:10] can that is
[16:12] fine but that's what they
[16:15] believe said Christ was
[16:18] crucified and he took off your
[16:22] imperfection that you may be
[16:25] perfect that's why the song composer
[16:27] said the song
[16:30] composer said by
[16:32] myself I cannot but with God it is
[16:37] possible so
[16:39] God wanting us to
[16:42] know that is
[16:44] possible when he came to the process of
[16:48] Salvation he didn't just an
[16:51] angel but he took a form of a
[16:55] flesh and he went through the natural
[16:58] that we go
[17:03] through to tell us that to tell us that
[17:08] it is
[17:09] possible for us to serve God In the
[17:15] Flesh you know
[17:17] today I want to talk about
[17:21] something and maybe one way the other
[17:24] have heard it
[17:27] before but my
[17:29] emphasis is not what I'm com to talk
[17:33] about but my
[17:35] emphasis is to see yourself in what I'm
[17:37] com to talk
[17:40] about because if you're able to see
[17:42] yourself in the word of
[17:45] God then you know how to act and
[17:51] behave and I like to talk about
[17:56] predestination that God for forew us
[17:59] before the foundation of this Earth was
[18:03] laid that God
[18:06] for us before the foundation of the
[18:14] was no sometime people
[18:17] think it was like if God is God as
[18:21] people used to
[18:23] say and if if God knows
[18:27] everything then why does this thing
[18:29] happen to
[18:32] people one thing I want to know let you
[18:35] know so God knows the
[18:38] beginning and he knows the end and he
[18:42] know whatever that is going
[18:45] on I want to read something from my
[18:49] Note said did you know that God forew
[18:52] all things from the very
[18:55] beginning and that he forew each and
[18:58] every one of us even before the
[19:00] foundation of the
[19:04] world so before we me and you were
[19:09] born God knew us God knew
[19:13] us and
[19:16] God has
[19:18] positionally God has
[19:22] positionally choosen
[19:25] us for his work for his
[19:30] work there have been
[19:33] nothing that has been outside the plan
[19:36] of
[19:38] God everything was just going as how God
[19:42] has planned
[19:44] it but for me and you we have to ask
[19:49] ourself which part of the plan of
[19:53] God am I
[19:55] playing you just that and you need to
[19:57] have to get that you need to get that
[20:01] idea of the part that you are
[20:04] playing so that you could act well so
[20:07] that you could do it and do it to the
[20:10] best Abraham said whatever you do be the
[20:17] best so but how can you be the
[20:20] best when you don't know who you
[20:25] are you know we have come to a point
[20:29] there a lot of
[20:31] Christians don't know who they are and
[20:34] they are following how some people are
[20:36] living their
[20:37] life and they are impersonating how
[20:40] people live their life they are
[20:45] impersonating but the Christian Life
[20:49] don't have to be that
[20:51] way because God has called each and
[20:55] everyone for a different purpose
[20:59] and a different plan and a different
[21:02] way so we have to come to the point and
[21:06] ask
[21:08] ourselves what is the plan of God for my
[21:12] [Music]
[21:13] life and you have to search for that
[21:16] plan of God for your life you have to
[21:19] search for
[21:21] [Music]
[21:22] it and have you have to ask God for
[21:27] direction
[21:28] so that you don't be outside the plan of
[21:32] God so that you don't try to do
[21:35] something on your
[21:37] own but you all the time stick to what
[21:41] God has given to you so that you all the
[21:44] time stick to what God has given to
[21:47] you and bring everything out for the for
[21:51] the edification of the body of
[21:55] Christ you know
[21:58] most
[21:59] Christians are just learning from people
[22:03] they are just copying from their
[22:06] friends so they get fed
[22:09] up they get fed up fed up they get
[22:13] tired is
[22:16] because if I met
[22:19] God or BR Martin met
[22:22] God
[22:24] Martin or Pastor go
[22:28] God will direct him towards a certain
[22:32] line and because I saw bra Mar going
[22:35] that
[22:36] line because I saw bra going this
[22:39] way I was like okay let me let me follow
[22:46] him but he has seen
[22:51] something and God has directed him in
[22:53] that
[22:56] way
[22:58] so you also have to come to that
[23:01] point to see God for
[23:05] yourself
[23:07] said every
[23:09] man who call himself a
[23:12] Christian should make
[23:15] sure that you have that
[23:18] experience that encounter with
[23:21] God and he know God
[23:24] himself so that his life would not come
[23:28] and be like do and
[23:31] don't so
[23:34] that
[23:36] yeah don't do this do
[23:42] that you won't be somebody telling you
[23:45] to do
[23:48] something but you have seen
[23:51] something you have had an encounter with
[23:55] God and it's because of that encounter
[23:59] that's why you are behaving that
[24:02] way and we all want to behave in a
[24:05] certain
[24:06] way because we have had an encounter
[24:09] with
[24:10] God so that we don't go around copying
[24:13] each
[24:15] other but we live our lifestyle as
[24:18] Christ has directed
[24:21] us because if God has predestined
[24:24] destined me and
[24:26] you then he have different work for me
[24:29] and
[24:31] you but I work all
[24:34] together from the body of
[24:37] Christ so my question you have to ask
[24:40] yourself
[24:41] is which part of the body of Christ am
[24:46] I am I the hand of
[24:49] Christ or am I the mouth of
[24:51] Christ you just
[24:54] imagine that the two
[24:56] hands decide okay they also want to be
[25:00] leg how the life of the human being how
[25:04] will our life
[25:05] be that your two hands they decide to
[25:09] join your
[25:11] legs we should just see
[25:13] ourself as the human body that that how
[25:17] the body of that how the body of Christ
[25:21] is that each and
[25:24] everyone is complimentary to the other
[25:30] compl
[25:32] the yeah yeah to the
[25:38] other and we
[25:41] together form the body of
[25:46] Christ I'm reading something for
[25:48] Ephesians
[25:51] 1
[25:54] 5-6 say that God said God has PR
[25:57] destined us according to the good
[25:59] pleasure of his
[26:03] will God has predestined
[26:07] us according to the good pleasure of his
[26:12] [Music]
[26:14] will that means God has something on his
[26:20] heart and God has
[26:23] predestined me and you for that to
[26:29] praise to
[26:31] praise and glory of his
[26:35] grace that that is
[26:37] what God has chosen me and you
[26:41] for so our
[26:44] lifestyle so through our
[26:47] lifestyle the praise of
[26:50] God the glorification of
[26:53] God should be
[26:56] seen
[26:59] know somebody say ask for me I'm not
[27:01] sure God knows
[27:04] me I'm not sure even if they are talking
[27:07] about the child of God I'm
[27:10] part I'm not sure if they talking about
[27:12] the child of God I'm
[27:16] part there are about eight billion
[27:18] people in the world there are about
[27:21] eight billion people in the
[27:24] world how can God know
[27:26] me
[27:28] I'm just one little
[27:30] tiny of the
[27:32] El I'm just one little person in
[27:36] the I'm almostly in significance among
[27:39] the N billion people or the8 billion
[27:47] people and that how sometimes us
[27:53] think and say one time Peter asked
[27:58] Jesus you
[28:00] know
[28:02] Jesus we have been following you we have
[28:05] been following

[28:27] money

[30:01] number how much more me and you who was
[30:05] created in the image of
[30:08] God God knows
[30:11] everybody I'm reading from Romans
[30:15] 8:30 Romans
[30:26] 8
[30:30] say whom he did
[30:32] predestinate then he also called and
[30:36] whom he has called then he also justify
[30:40] and whom he justified then he also
[30:47] glorified
[30:49] 30 8

[32:28] this this will be the color of your
[32:32] shirt so okay you you will sit
[32:36] here and this person also will sit
[32:39] here and they so this man is a false
[32:43] prophet oh a
[32:45] liar there is no way in the United
[32:49] States of
[32:50] America they we will make a
[32:53] reservation and we go and not get it
[32:58] so as the time the day
[33:00] got when they got
[33:03] there the hotel people told them
[33:06] that we are
[33:09] sorry before you made a
[33:11] reservation somebody has already done
[33:14] that so the person has occupied
[33:17] that we can't give that to
[33:19] you so the man decided to go around look
[33:22] for a different
[33:24] hotel and he went around and he went
[33:28] round and he didn't get any other
[33:33] Hotel than H than what the prophet
[33:38] said he he said he didn't
[33:41] care so the time
[33:43] reach the time
[33:45] came and the prophet
[33:48] came and he stood before the
[33:52] pit he said come to me with no other
[33:55] book come to me with no other
[33:58] book with no other book apart from the
[34:03] Bible other
[34:06] book come to me with no other
[34:11] book other
[34:13] book
[34:17] book
[34:19] yeah
[34:22] yeah no other book apart from the Bible
[34:26] other book
[34:33] yeah
[34:35] and and as they sat
[34:39] there and Bam stood before the
[34:42] [Music]
[34:43] pulit the man stood
[34:47] up he said before before he
[34:50] speak I have something to
[34:53] say before
[34:55] today this man he told me I'll sit
[35:00] here I'll wear this
[35:03] color you you will be
[35:05] here you do
[35:07] this and the other people will be here
[35:11] and the others two will sit
[35:12] here and that is the position we are you
[35:17] told me I will not get that
[35:20] reservation it is
[35:22] because it is
[35:25] because we were with
[35:27] God we were with God from the beginning
[35:32] and as long as man stand at the original
[35:35] position of being with God he knows what
[35:39] happens
[35:42] ahead because he's the state of being a
[35:45] man God he's in the state of being a man
[35:53] God so you could tell them whatever is
[35:56] going to happen
[36:00] so
[36:01] if me and you could
[36:05] search
[36:06] search and look for
[36:09] where
[36:11] where where God has placed
[36:16] us will be a great tool for
[36:22] God did you know
[36:24] that it was God's per will for him to
[36:28] come to this
[36:32] world yeah it's
[36:35] strange but it's
[36:37] true because God wanted to demonstrate
[36:40] his attribute to
[36:43] mankind his
[36:47] attributes God himself wanted to be
[36:52] glorified he could not be glorified as a
[36:55] savior if there was nobody to be saved
[36:57] in the first
[37:05] place he can't be he cannot be a savior
[37:09] if there is nobody to be
[37:13] saved if there was no man in the Fallen
[37:18] State then there is no need for
[37:22] Redemption so God allowed that to
[37:25] happen
[37:27] in order for him to be
[37:30] God he knew from the very
[37:34] beginning who will be
[37:36] saved and who will not be
[37:39] saved God was not willing that anyone
[37:42] should
[37:43] perish God was not willing for anyone to
[37:48] perish
[37:51] yeah God
[37:53] wished all of us will be saved
[37:58] but
[38:00] God didn't force
[38:02] man in making
[38:05] decision but God created
[38:07] man on a free moral
[38:16] agency that man could make a decision
[38:20] for
[38:22] himself God was not willing that any
[38:25] should perish
[38:29] but that all might come to
[38:33] repentance but he being
[38:36] infinite knowing the end from the
[38:41] beginning created man on a free moral
[38:45] agency created man on a free moral
[38:49] agency um free free moral agency and um
[39:06] [Music]
[39:08] that man could make decision for
[39:13] himself so after
[39:15] creating creating
[39:17] them he knew
[39:20] that I've given this man fre more
[39:24] agency this person would decide to pass
[39:27] this
[39:29] direction the other person will decide
[39:31] to go this
[39:34] way so God
[39:36] knew from the
[39:38] beginning who will be
[39:40] saved and who will not be
[39:42] saved God didn't create any
[39:45] man and
[39:48] willingly and
[39:50] willingly or
[39:53] wishing that that man should perish
[39:57] but God he
[40:00] wished all men will be
[40:03] saved all men will come to
[40:06] repentance but God gave the decision to
[40:09] man that man have to make the
[40:12] decision of where to
[40:15] pass or who to
[40:18] choose and that's the reason
[40:20] why when the when the
[40:23] vision when the vision came from the
[40:25] brothers
[40:27] he they told Brother
[40:29] Abraham said because of this momentous
[40:35] decision it was a
[40:37] decision so the Christian
[40:39] Life is a decision you need to make a
[40:43] decision you need to tell yourself from
[40:47] today
[40:48] onwards I want God to be my king I want
[40:51] God to rule my life I want God to Lead
[40:55] Me I want God in every business I'm
[40:59] doing it is a
[41:01] decision God is
[41:03] there but he's waiting for
[41:06] you for you to allow him to
[41:10] operate it's like it's like the message
[41:12] bar
[41:13] preach he said doors in door he said do
[41:17] IND
[41:19] door say some of us some of us we open
[41:24] the entrance door for God to enter
[41:28] in we open the
[41:30] door for God to enter
[41:33] in but
[41:35] within
[41:37] within
[41:40] within
[41:43] yeah we have
[41:46] doors and we
[41:48] decide which one we have to open to
[41:52] God so some of us will
[41:55] say some of us will say for my
[41:59] business I want God to take
[42:03] over
[42:04] but for my marriage
[42:08] life I want to handle it
[42:11] myself it's a
[42:13] decision God is
[42:15] powerful he could have forced
[42:18] you to do it but no God created man with
[42:24] a free moral ageny
[42:29] that you have the choice you have the
[42:32] choice or the
[42:33] chance to make a
[42:35] decision he said I stand at the door and
[42:39] knock If any man hear my
[42:43] voice and open the door then I will come
[42:47] in so if God is not coming in then we
[42:51] have locked the door God is still
[42:54] knocking so the question how long long
[42:56] have God been knocking at your
[43:00] door we just need to Avail
[43:04] ourself give give the opportunity for
[43:07] God to take control of our
[43:10] life so that our life will completely be
[43:13] be not how we live
[43:17] it but it will be as how God want it it
[43:22] will be as how God
[43:24] wanted and you go singing the
[43:29] song it is no longer I live
[43:34] it but it is Christ in me that
[43:37] lives and that is the point we need to
[43:40] come in
[43:43] Christianity and that is the reason why
[43:45] you need to have to get the
[43:48] knowledge that you have been predestined
[43:51] by
[43:52] God and you have been destined by God in
[43:55] this end
[43:59] time and you have been destined to be
[44:01] the bride of Christ
[44:04] Jesus and for to be the bride of Christ
[44:07] this say you need to live a certain
[44:11] life you need to cover yourself a
[44:14] certain
[44:15] way you need to speak in a certain
[44:21] way and how to clothe
[44:25] yourself how to clothe yourself or how
[44:27] to cover
[44:29] yourself God has given us a
[44:33] way when you go back to
[44:36] the we had one great king called
[44:39] hazus we had one great king called
[44:43] hazus one yeah we had a great king
[44:45] called
[44:48] hazus yeah called hazus in the Book of
[44:54] Esther
[44:57] we had a king called
[45:10] aaz
[45:17] aers you just continue like that they
[45:20] had a great
[45:23] [Music]
[45:24] king and this great king a wife called
[45:28] vity he had a wife called
[45:33] [Music]
[45:44] vity and this
[45:46] wife when the King was in need of the
[45:53] wife she was be she was
[45:57] busy with other
[46:00] females with other with other females
[46:05] females with the matters of the
[46:08] world with the matters of the
[46:13] world and
[46:17] AOS being a
[46:19] king and
[46:24] said
[46:28] was a typology of Jesus
[46:31] Christ and this are
[46:34] [Music]
[46:36] hos his wife
[46:40] vity told her I won't come I won't come
[46:47] won and said it pain
[46:51] azus it pained
[46:54] azus it pained
[47:00] him and the Seven
[47:04] messenger called
[47:06] Muk
[47:10] Muk he said let the king put his wife
[47:16] away and let them let us get him another
[47:21] king and say and they gather all the
[47:24] virgins in the city
[47:29] that's the reason the Bible talk about
[47:30] the 10 virgins in the New
[47:34] Testament but within the Virgin some
[47:36] were
[47:39] foolish and some were
[47:42] [Music]
[47:45] wise and said they came they said they
[47:48] came to a for them to appear before the
[47:51] king they came a time for them to appear
[47:54] before the king
[47:58] so a Time came they have to come before
[48:00] the
[48:02] king so the king will make a new choice
[48:05] of who to be his
[48:09] wife and the King has an infinite
[48:14] resources I had an infinite
[48:21] resources and he said dress yourself any
[48:24] way you like it
[48:27] [Music]
[48:29] he gave them the will to make the
[48:31] decision what they want to
[48:33] [Music]
[48:37] wear BR said some of them
[48:42] came and they added a lot of
[48:46] eyelashes some of them
[48:49] came and so for my dress cut it for it
[48:52] so that all my body will be
[48:54] showing

[49:01] virgins they qualify to be part of the
[49:04] virgins they
[49:07] qualified to be part of the
[49:09] virgins and this

[49:14] them so everybody was saying oh me I
[49:18] like that
[49:20] me I like to do this
[49:24] way but when go to the time of
[49:27] Esther he went to the personal assistant

[53:22] churches and then B religious
[53:27] activities we have come to a
[53:30] point we have come to a point that in
[53:33] our
[53:34] schools God has been taken out
[53:38] completely they don't talk about God
[53:40] anymore all the foolishness of the world
[53:43] has been packed
[53:45] there and our
[53:47] children our brothers our sisters are
[53:51] been taught those stuff in the
[53:53] school I taught those stuff in the
[53:57] school and when somebody is standing
[54:00] from
[54:01] God yeah you see all these people
[54:06] against that that one
[54:08] person against that one person standing
[54:10] for God it didn't start
[54:13] today it started they all records in the
[54:19] Bible so he shouldn't be
[54:21] discouraged you should be
[54:23] worried you should be worried
[54:27] parent parent
[54:31] parent don't let the
[54:33] schools the people of the world
[54:36] determine how your children should live
[54:38] their
[54:40] life God is going to have you
[54:42] responsible for them it is not those
[54:45] over
[54:47] there if you go to the school and they
[54:50] don't want you to treat your children to
[54:53] live a Christian Life get them out of
[54:55] their school and place them something
[54:58] somewhere
[55:00] different
[55:02] said and Jesus
[55:04] said it is better for us to be PL
[55:08] away than to rot in
[55:11] damnation it is better for your eyes to
[55:13] be PL
[55:15] away PL away taken
[55:18] off than to rot in the hell of
[55:21] fire parent let's be serious with our
[55:26] children you
[55:28] know God is going to hold us accountable
[55:31] for
[55:33] them hold us accountable for
[55:36] them he said children are a gift from
[55:42] God and God is going to H us
[55:46] responsible we have to ask ourselves how
[55:49] are we treating our
[55:52] children we yeah
[55:57] and we have to know how we have to train
[55:59] them with the word of
[56:02] God because God is going to head us
[56:06] responsible for how we train
[56:10] them and don't don't don't let some
[56:12] friends of
[56:14] yours try to try to tell you how you
[56:17] should train your
[56:20] children make sure you are training your
[56:22] children to put Christ in them
[56:26] [Music]

[56:29] them to know God for
[56:34] themselves Moses mother trained Moses

[56:59] and that is what parents we need to
[57:02] doent need to train

[57:10] God so that when they when they they
[57:14] grow they won't be tossed up by the
[57:17] foolishness of the
[57:18] world because Christ has already been
[57:21] implanted in

[58:15] children they indoctrinate our children
[58:18] withness of the world with the nonsense

[58:32] God it does itend with us it doesn't end
[58:36] with us the younger generation need to
[58:38] stand from God and we need to teach them
[58:42] we need to PR in our plan that we are
[58:44] going to make sure they know God for
[58:46] themselves and when they know God
[58:49] fors this done then it's done because
[58:53] they now know God for themselves
[58:56] but don't be
[58:57] worried when you are trying to train
[58:59] your children after God and the people
[59:03] are against you they were against
[59:06] Esther they were against

[59:43] her Esther found fever in the eyes of
[59:47] the
[59:53] king and in this
[59:56] age we also have had an a personal
[59:59] assistant to
[1:00:03] God and that is the prophet of this
[1:00:07] age and he has the clothing that is
[1:00:10] desired by
[1:00:14] God and that clothing is the message of
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:19] hour all that we need to do is to clothe
[1:00:22] ourself in the message of the hour
[1:00:26] so that when God see us we will find
[1:00:29] favor in the eyes of
[1:00:31] God so we shouldn't be worried and we
[1:00:35] should be
[1:00:36] scared about what is
[1:00:38] happening we shouldn't try to look like

[1:01:16] people come out of
[1:01:18] them come out of
[1:01:21] them we are the people of God
[1:01:25] God forew us before the foundation of
[1:01:27] the
[1:01:29] earth God knew us before the foundation
[1:01:32] of that is the reason why when man
[1:01:37] fell God could not hold himself on his
[1:01:40] seat God could not hold himself on the
[1:01:43] his
[1:01:45] seat yeah hold himself on his seat on
[1:01:47] his
[1:01:50] throne God could not stay on his
[1:01:53] throne
[1:01:55] so the point that he came down
[1:01:58] himself to PVE a
[1:02:01] way of
[1:02:03] redemption to restore
[1:02:06] man back to the original position in his
[1:02:09] original
[1:02:11] creation and he took God
[1:02:14] himself and he came to
[1:02:17] redeem so the word
[1:02:20] redeem is to take
[1:02:23] back
[1:02:25] and place it at the original
[1:02:29] position
[1:02:31] originally we were with
[1:02:35] God and something happened and God came
[1:02:39] back to pave a
[1:02:42] way for us to come back to
[1:02:45] him because there was no one
[1:02:48] worthy there was no one
[1:02:51] perfect to be able to atone for our
[1:02:56] sins because everybody was
[1:03:00] corrupt and every man everything was in
[1:03:03] the falling
[1:03:07] State Abraham
[1:03:09] said when man
[1:03:12] fell the the whole generation of
[1:03:17] creation went under that
[1:03:21] state and now there was
[1:03:24] nothing that will atone for the sin of
[1:03:29] man atone for the sin of man or that
[1:03:32] could be as a sacrifice for the sin of
[1:03:37] man so
[1:03:38] God have to leave his
[1:03:42] throne and come to the word through a
[1:03:44] virgin
[1:03:48] bed come
[1:03:51] yeah to take upon himself the sin all
[1:03:55] our
[1:03:57] sin and crucify it on
[1:04:01] Calvary and take the whole
[1:04:05] creation from the Fallen state to the
[1:04:09] original
[1:04:12] position and he said if you now accept
[1:04:16] the
[1:04:17] atonement if you now accept the
[1:04:21] sacrifice then you are of God then you
[1:04:24] of God you are of
[1:04:29] God so God made the provided way and
[1:04:33] redeem
[1:04:35] man never think God don't know what he's
[1:04:37] going
[1:04:39] on never think God don't know what is
[1:04:41] going
[1:04:43] on never think or don't think God don't
[1:04:47] know what is going
[1:04:50] on you know when
[1:04:52] Moses went to
[1:04:55] Pharaoh
[1:04:57] Pharaoh he said Pharaoh let my people
[1:05:01] go and he said why why should I let them
[1:05:07] go and Moses put his his his rod
[1:05:12] down he place his
[1:05:15] rod and he turned into snake and Pharaoh
[1:05:20] laughed and he called James and
[1:05:23] jambres
[1:05:26] his two
[1:05:27] magicians and he also put the rod
[1:05:30] now and he also put also put the rod
[1:05:33] down and also he turned to snake and he
[1:05:36] was laughing he said oh Moses look at
[1:05:40] how go how small your God
[1:05:43] is and when Moses was done Moses was
[1:05:48] worried that he didn't go Pharaoh didn't
[1:05:51] let the people of God
[1:05:53] go and he went to God and so God told
[1:05:57] him don't worry it is
[1:06:00] me that has hardened the heart of
[1:06:03] pharaoh so that my people will see my
[1:06:07] power so that I can deliver my people
[1:06:10] with a strong
[1:06:12] hand so God knows what you are going
[1:06:15] through so what we are going through God
[1:06:20] knows see yeah so don't be worried just
[1:06:24] go to God Moses was just worried but he
[1:06:28] said no don't be worried I'm the Lord
[1:06:31] who Harden the heart of
[1:06:33] pharaoh we can even run back to the book
[1:06:36] of H Romans 13 chapter 5 to look at
[1:06:39] something R Romans 13 let me let me
[1:06:44] start from the verse
[1:06:46] 11
[1:06:53] yeah
[1:07:01] 13 for the children being not yet
[1:07:10] born 1311 oh Romans 911 rather sorry
[1:07:22] 911
[1:07:25] for the children being not yet
[1:07:29] born neither having done any good or
[1:07:34] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:07:36] to El might
[1:07:39] stand not of
[1:07:41] works but of him that call
[1:07:45] it it it was said unto
[1:07:49] her the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:07:52] younger
[1:07:54] as it is
[1:07:55] written Jacob have I
[1:07:59] love but Esau I
[1:08:03] hated before they were
[1:08:07] born so it means
[1:08:10] God God knew you before you were
[1:08:17] born because I said ear God created man
[1:08:20] on a fre moral
[1:08:22] AG God created man on a free moral
[1:08:29] agency and he knowing the end from the
[1:08:34] beginning know the kind of choice and
[1:08:36] decision every man will make before the
[1:08:39] foundation of
[1:08:44] this so we should not be
[1:08:47] worried but we should count ourself
[1:08:51] happy and privileged
[1:08:54] to find ourself to be part of the plan
[1:08:57] of
[1:09:00] God because to some
[1:09:03] people the gospel is
[1:09:06] hidden to there some
[1:09:09] people the Bible is not
[1:09:12] important but it was it said in the
[1:09:15] Scripture it is hidden to them that are
[1:09:20] lost but we are privileged we are not
[1:09:23] lost
[1:09:27] God has indeed been grateful unto us God
[1:09:30] has been indeed grateful unto
[1:09:32] us being grateful onto
[1:09:35] us for selecting us for predestiny
[1:09:40] us in his plan of work onto
[1:09:45] salvation so if somebody is being so
[1:09:47] wicked if somebody is being so
[1:09:51] wicked yeah
[1:09:58] don't be worried it is in the plan of
[1:10:01] God it's just for the glorification of
[1:10:04] God oh when you see gazing lesan going
[1:10:10] on gazing
[1:10:13] lesbianism
[1:10:15] transgender all those stuff going on
[1:10:18] don't be worried he's just carrying a
[1:10:22] message he just carrying a message that
[1:10:25] we are close to the
[1:10:27] end
[1:10:29] Believers
[1:10:33] Believers
[1:10:35] brothers sisters let's hold to the
[1:10:38] message of the hour let's go to the word
[1:10:41] of this day it is only by that word that

[1:11:03] predestined as as the children of
[1:11:06] God you not all of us I want you to see
[1:11:12] that it's
[1:11:13] you you that God has
[1:11:17] predestined and to recognize yourself
[1:11:19] from
[1:11:21] today that you are a child of
[1:11:25] God and you have called to live a
[1:11:28] certain life on this
[1:11:31] Earth and that God is there to support
[1:11:35] you and God is here to provide all
[1:11:37] everything you need for
[1:11:41] you I mean you I mean

[1:11:50] fellow he said work at your own Serv
[1:11:55] salvation with fear and
[1:11:58] trembling salvation is an individual
[1:12:02] Affair and everybody has a different
[1:12:05] task given to him by
[1:12:10] God to some God has called them to be
[1:12:14] preachers to some
[1:12:17] teachers to some singers everybody have
[1:12:20] to know what is his position in Christ
[1:12:23] Jesus
[1:12:26] so that we play our part
[1:12:32] accordingly we have to ask ourselves the
[1:12:36] question what is my position in the body
[1:12:38] of
[1:12:40] Christ if God predestined
[1:12:44] me before the foundation of this Earth
[1:12:46] was
[1:12:48] laid then what work has God predestined
[1:12:51] me
[1:12:52] for
[1:12:56] I don't have the answer for
[1:12:59] you but I know a man who
[1:13:03] can and that man is Jesus
[1:13:06] Christ all that you need to speak to him
[1:13:10] so oh
[1:13:11] Lord today this is what I have
[1:13:15] heard this is what I've have
[1:13:18] heard
[1:13:22] head I'm part of your
[1:13:25] children that you have a certain work
[1:13:27] for
[1:13:30] me God I don't know the kind of work you
[1:13:33] have for me I don't know the kind of
[1:13:36] work you had for
[1:13:38] me yeah
[1:13:41] have oh God reveal to me oh Lord open my
[1:13:45] eyes for me to
[1:13:47] see so that I will be able to serve you
[1:13:52] well no preach a certain
[1:13:56] message and he titled it and he titled
[1:14:00] it he titled
[1:14:03] it
[1:14:05] yeah trying to do God a service without
[1:14:09] his
[1:14:12] will so that you won't be doing service
[1:14:15] for God but is not in the will of
[1:14:20] God that's the reason why
[1:14:24] each and every one of
[1:14:27] us to make
[1:14:30] sure to know our
[1:14:33] calling to know our
[1:14:42] calling and the purpose of our
[1:14:45] calling and the purpose of our
[1:14:48] call so that we may serve God
[1:14:52] diligently
[1:14:56] this
[1:14:57] morning I came to tell
[1:15:00] you that you were in the plan of God you
[1:15:05] were in the mind of
[1:15:07] God and
[1:15:10] everything God
[1:15:12] have is for you because whatever Christ
[1:15:16] Jesus
[1:15:20] have is for the wife of Christ Jesus
[1:15:24] so if you need
[1:15:26] healing go for it if you need
[1:15:30] something go for it I used to tell it is
[1:15:34] for
[1:15:35] you don't think it's for some other
[1:15:38] brother no often times Christians are
[1:15:43] good of telling people God will do this
[1:15:47] for you but they fa to see that God is
[1:15:51] doing this for me
[1:15:53] you have to
[1:15:55] realize and see what God is doing for
[1:15:58] you and be praising God for what he's
[1:16:01] doing for you praising God for what he's
[1:16:04] doing for
[1:16:06] you and be waiting for what God will do
[1:16:09] for
[1:16:09] you so you are
[1:16:12] praising you are working for God you are
[1:16:15] waiting for what God will do for
[1:16:18] you and you are living your
[1:16:20] life and if you are doing this
[1:16:23] and if you are doing this if you are
[1:16:26] doing it like this the Christian life
[1:16:28] becomes
[1:16:29] simple because you are not doing
[1:16:32] anything oh God I cannot stop
