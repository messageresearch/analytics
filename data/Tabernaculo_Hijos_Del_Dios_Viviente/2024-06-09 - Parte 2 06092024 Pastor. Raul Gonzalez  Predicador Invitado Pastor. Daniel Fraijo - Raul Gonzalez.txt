TRANSCRIPT
========================================
verse Romans 1:14 the Apostle Paul fulfill his ministry as God told him I'll send you to the Gentiles and you'll take the inheritance that was for Israel the book that I've opened the Seven Seals that I've loosed it's what is Israel rejected and it's what Paul took to the gentile people it's what we still have with us [Music] today open without a revelation it's closed to you so the open book still requires a revelation that God Alone can give you it's a it's the personal experience in this last Church age it's always been a personal experience from the days that Jesus walked on the earth even the 12 apostles walked with Jesus even John who would put his head on the bosom of Jesus it's it still wasn't enough it wasn't until Jesus was dead buried and resurrected the third day was dead buried and resurrected the third day it wasn't until he rose again that he that the father began to give them Revelation and the friendship grew greater with Jesus after he was gone from his flesh body the friendship was greater now that the Holy Spirit was coming to them because now he could be with each one of them moment every hour in every place under every trial Romans 1 and verse 14 the Apostle Paul a prophet the great prophet of God he said I am a deor both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise I've heard men say I only preach to the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul said I Paul the messenger to the first church age the angel to the Ephesians the great prophet of God he who was ascribed to more than half of the New Testament He Who as much an example to us as William brandham was just as much an example he said I am deor both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise version and to the unwise so as much as is in me I'm ready to preach the gospel to you that are Rome [Music] also and as as much as is in me I am ready to preach the gospel to you and Albuquerque here this morning let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning ask your blessings upon your people and may you Open the Eyes of our understanding that we'll see Jesus only we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated in Visions in the prophetic word which is which was unfolding The Plan of Redemption every symbol in there is mentioned for a Divine Purpose in The Parables there are things mentioned that are only there to fill or dramatize the story sometimes even to obscure the spiritual lesson many details in a parable are there to hide the meaning that can only be seen by a personal revelation as Jesus said in Matthew 11 father I thank you that you've hidden these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent but you'll reveal it unto babes such as would learn so that put that gives us a principle to live by that if you're going to get revelation of this book called The Bible you have to come by God's way first to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be the gift of the Holy Spirit born a good experience then you become one of these babes to whom God will reveal his book reveal his plan reveal himself for Christ is the mystery of God revealed many Visions in the Bible we we read one last night and we'll share that again as we read it's Revelation 61 and it's and it's it's it's the vision declaring that the first seal is open not that it was going to be open but that it was open Revelation 61 reads like this and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals can I heard is that where the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see we touched on it last night we realized that the lamb was Jesus Christ and he and he's the one that opened one of the seals and and the seal is what held is is what held the book open [Music] or or rather it's what held the book closed the seal but the English word they use the word [Music] book but in the days of Jesus their books were really a scroll it was a paper or an animal skin that was rolled up and the seal it could be a piece of leather wrapped around to hold it shut some would take wax and pour it on it the noble men would put their ring and press it into the wax then a messenger would take that scroll and he would run to take it to whom it was intended then the person for whom the message was sent had the right to remove the seal he had the right he' remove the seal and he would just drop it on the ground because it wasn't the seal he that was that was coming to him it was the seal that held the message and the seal had to come off so he could open the scroll and realize behold I send you Elijah the prophet in these last days but but you could read the message but now you need to Revelation who is Elijah when is he coming what will it be like what will he preach well all of those questions would be answered in the next scroll and you'd take the scroll off the second the second seal would come off the second scroll and open that up then it would be the the message to tell you who that Prophet is who that Elijah is and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals in other words I saw when Jesus opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder in other words I heard the voice of God telling me that the seal was open and one of the four beasts saying this one was the Lion of the tribe of Judah which was Jesus and I and I saw Jesus say saying come and see isn't that what Jesus said in his ministry come and see that if the works that I do don't prove who I am then it goes on a vision full of symbols and as we get into the flow of visions and Parables it really helps us to understand the style of the author of this book called The Bible Jesus it was prophesied that when Messiah would come that he would speak in Parables and without without a parable he would not speak but in Parables he was going to tell us things that had been hidden since the foundation of the world in other words things that he had been teaching Adam and Eve things that they couldn't hold to and keep they failed to fulfill it but God said my word will not return to me void I'll have a man one day that'll take me at his word he'll get a hold of that word he'll make it real that man was Jesus Christ and through the blood of Jesus you can be that man now you can be that woman what Adam and Eve failed to do through the blood of Jesus you can keep his word you can live true in in the book of the Psalms Psalm 78 it goes like this give ear oh my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark thing dark sayings of old hundreds of years later hundreds this this prophecy was anointed to Matthew and he put it in his gospel in Matthew 13 and verse 34 Matthew wrote this anointed of the Holy [Music] Spirit and and this Old Testament prophecy the Holy Spirit brought it to his [Music] remembrance write it in your book Matthew and Matthew wrote in verse 33 of Matthew 13 another Parable spoke unto them heaven like unto leaven which a woman took and hid meur of meal till the whole was leavened a parable but we won't speak on that one yet in verse 34 then Matthew says all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude and Parables he's now Anointed with the prophecy of the prophets and then he tells us and without a parable spoke he not unto them what was the reason in 30 verse 35 he tells us the reason that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world not before the foundation since the foundation the days of Adam the things he told Adam the things he was teaching Adam you what he was teaching Adam how to handle the spoken word The Original Seed he wanted his son Adam to be a Creator like he was a Creator he wanted his son Adam to have thus sayith the Lord he wanted his son Adam to have faith to speak to that mountain so everything that Jesus Messiah King of the Jews would speak would be in a parable so with that thought what about the Great Commission to the church was it a parable his entire Earthly thus sayith the Lord everything he would speak would be in a parable none of it would be literal like take for instance the Great Commission in Matthew 28 starting at Verse 18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth he was just about ready to ascend on high he'd been for about 40 days and before he leaves he gives him a Great Commission in verse 19 he says go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost it was Jesus who said that is it true or is it false it's true we're not scared to say what Jesus said is true no especially now we know how he why he said it we know how he said it he said it in a parable it wasn't literal these were symbols and the Revelation would come later teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you and L I'm with you always even until the end of the world Amen but in Acts chapter 2 verses 36- 38 is the revelation of the parable adds more detail to the parable makes the Great Commission to the church clear another word we use for clarity is revelation Holy Spirit Revelation because that's how modern events are made clear by prophecy by revelation of the prophecy Acts chapter 2 verse 36 that Peter a great prophet and Apostle of God anointed of the Holy Spirit he said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ in other words Jesus is both Lord and Christ Lord him that's the father Christ the Holy Spirit what is it God changing [Music] for not three Gods one God and it's Jesus the body of Jesus that the father created was called the Son of God that was the title of this body that was born to the Virgin Mary [Music] but the life and the one who that body was the Lord himself the creator of heavens and earth he that sat on the throne with an open book in his hand then then Peter says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do because you see within that multitude of people on the day of Pentecost that was watching 120 people and they speaking in the in the language and dialects of all the people of the great things that God had done those same people were at the crucifiction those same people were at that tribunal of pilot those same people were the ones that got caught up in that anointing and they were screaming crucify him too said when he looked up upon that multitude of 120 come down out of the Earth room Jesus looked at them Peter looked at them he says and God have made that same Jesus I bet he pointed his finger at them and he said whom you have crucified put the finger right on that person because he deser the heart oh it smoked them in their heart Hearts the Bible said they were pricked in their hearts they knew they were guilty they they and in their hearts they were they they they were they regretted it and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren you know because you saw us and heard us scream crucify him but we're feeling condemned in our hearts what can someone like me do to be saved now when yesterday I I screamed crucify what can I do today what can wash away my sins oh Peter was going to tell him what nothing but the blood of Jesus and Peter said unto them you screamed crucify him you threw stones at him you mocked him but there's something you can do that can wash away your sins repent and be bap baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and thy sins which are many will be washed away put in the sea of God's forgetfulness you see the parable of Jesus in Matthew 20189 had now been revealed and a name was added Jesus spoke it in the parable but he gave it to Peter in a revelation so now Matthew 28:19 and acts 238 they come together like this but if you belong to a denomination and you believe in act 238 you believe it like this and if you belong to one of the Evangelical churches and baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost you believe it like this and then when the two come to talk they're talking like this but when you get a revelation Matthew 28:19 and act 238 comes together like this oh it's a Perfect Blend prophecy and the revelation of that prophecy Glory it gives you confidence it gives you faith it gives you patience with those who don't see it because you realize they're blind and the eyes of their understanding have not been opened in the book of Colossians the Bible says Colossians 3:17 the Revelation is growing now and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him and now to the ministers and to the head of every house I want to tell you this you are a deor both to the wise and the unwise in your home and in your church and now armed with the knowledge [Music] what house will you build him the father as a pastor as an evangelist what house will we build him Paul said I am a deor both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to my church in Albuquerque and to the Ley the congregation I ask with your present understanding the foolish virgin is she your friend or your foe with that we begin on this parable of the 10 virgins but let me say that the parable of the 10 virgins is the seven seal mystery unfolding for the seven seal is to call a bride out of Pentecostal and World tradition you might ask did a prophet say that in the message Feast of the trumpets brother Bram said this and the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to call the people the bride out of out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word CH Christ in his own word here made flesh amongst us science has proved it by the pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing and thus saith the Lord but what's been the truth did he not say down on the river as John the Baptist was sent so will this message and remember we preached last night and showed by the scripture that the first seal and the first horse rider and the first coming of Christ begin in the ministry of this first Elijah John the Baptist so that's a pattern because the Bible is full of patterns because the word tells us in Hebrews 138 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday for and forever so that tells us then that when the second Elijah appears it'll be when that it'll be when the seventh seal is open and brother brandham said the voice on the River Ohio told him as John the Baptist was sent so will this message in other words it will follow the same pattern because God is unchanging in all his ways now the parable in Matthew 25 we'll begin at verse one Matthew 25 this is the 11th Hour this is the time of the voice of the Archangel which is the voice of the Resurrection The Voice that Lazarus heard the voice that Paul spoke of in first first Thessalonians 4 now Matthew 25 and verse one then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins when when Matthew 24 unfolds before our eyes what was Matthew 24 a prophet told us that it was Jesus in a parable ministering to Israel the Seven Seals how do we know this the seventh angel told us a prophet thus sayith the Lord verse two of Matthew 25 and it says and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept let me start with a statement here the 10 virgins are not the Church of laa but Believers of all denominations and manmade systems that have heard the call come out of her my people don't be partakers of her sins so to start with these 10 virgins are believers who have come out of the of the great Harlot that that have come out of her Harlot daughters this is the 11th Hour this is minutes before the Midnight Hour any moment a Rapture will come and take the wise away remember Revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the door knock what hour is it it's the same hour it's the 11th hour it's Matthew 25 If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come to him and will s with him and he with me the 10 virgins this is also the woman of Revelations 12 and the remnant of the woman's seed both wise and foolish turn with me to Revelations 12 and 1 Revelations chap 12 and verse one and it reads like this and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the son and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered where was this woman that was about to have that was having a child that had conceived her John said in heaven but it's not the heaven you're thinking of you see when John was on island of patmas there as a prisoner of Rome had nowhere to go maybe he's sitting on a rock there on the beach and he as he looked up to heaven a blue sky a few clouds that heaven became a great screen and in that heaven that blue sky the vision breaks and he sees a woman clothed with a son the sun represents the grace of God she is clothed with this grace but the Moon is under her feet that was the law oh the bride of Christ there that Ephesian bride that church that was born on the day of Pentecost this is her the LA the law is now under her feet she's now clothed in the grace of God and the child the the seed that was swn in her heart is Christ coming forth she's going to bring forth a son she's come she's coming to the stature of a perfect man she had a crown of 12 Stars 12 faithful stewards that laid the foundation of Revelation that's why she's been growing that's why she received Christ this is the bride these are the 10 virgins 10 virgins this is the woman of Revelations 12 both wise and foolish in verse 12 of Revelations 12 the Bible says this therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because but a short time the inhabitants of the earth represents the Jewish people the inhabit inhabiters of the sea represents a gentile people for the devil has come down unto you with great wrath with great wrath is come against Israel great wrath is coming against this woman the bride of Christ God's children he knowe he had but a short time verse 13 and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the Manchild this happened on that crucifixion day when Satan was cast down and he could no longer stand before God in that seventh Dimension and accuse the saints of God accused the children of God like one day he was able to accuse job and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman that was born on the day of Pentecost and was bringing forth the Manchild Christ enter the hope of glory and verse 14 says and to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle This Woman This New Testament Church this bride of Jesus Christ to her was given two Wings the the New Testament the Revelation now all the New Testament comes together like for this woman so that she might fly into the Wilderness into her place where she is nourished where she is fed for a time times and half a time what happened she was caught up in a resurrection she was taken to the wedding supper of the Lamb there she's being nourished there she's being fed for three and a half years taking away taken away from the face of the serpent who's now bringing a Great Tribulation on all his on all the world her place where she's nourished is the wedding supper of the Lamb a resurrection is taking place those two great Wings took her in a Rapture this is the wise virgin this is the wise virgin the two wings are the revelation of Old and New Testament her place is the wedding supper of the lamb for three and a half years while the foolish virgin remains on Earth for a Great Tribulation and yet she receives eternal life the foolish verse 15 the Bible says and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman this flood of water coming out of the mouth of the serpent is the seed of the serpent for water and prophecy represents a multitude of people so God is using the seed of the serpent men and women who are not God's children the is using them with their inventions of the internet of vile filthy videos every single video The Devil Makes is drugs sex murder filth prostitution whoredom wickedness lying oh separate yourself close that door to the devil keep your hearts pure and clean meditate on his word night and day and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood so that we'll all live like the world lives fornication adultery lies and that's in this message I don't know about the Catholic church because I have I haven't been to to a Catholic Church in 40 [Music] years I don't know where they're at other than to tell you she's the great maybe that's enough verse 15 and he saith unto me the waters which thou saw us this is revelation 17:15 because the because in verse in chapter 12 it said the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood so it's a Bible question what was that flood of water then every Bible question has a Bible answer for you and the answer is in chapter 17 in verse [Music] 15 of of Revelation [Music] 17 Revelation 17:15 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the horse sth are peoples and multitudes and Nations and tongues Revelations 12:16 the Bible says and the Earth helped the woman and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth scientists are saying there's a great climate change going on and if we don't do something quick the whole all of humanity will be destroyed and lost you know what I don't doubt it one bit but I'm telling you it's in the plan of God exactly and man has no control over that the Bible say the Earth helped the woman how was she helped with tsunami with earthquakes with [Music] blizzards with all kinds of natural disasters the Bible says the Earth swallowed up the flood and and they're so busy trying to save themselves from a natural disaster not realizing that the only preparation that can save you from all these disasters is repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you'll not perish with the world no you'll be taken up you'll be quickened changed and translated by the power of this [Music] word how does the Earth help the woman how does the Earth open her mouth and swallow up the flood of peoples multitudes Nations and [Music] tongues with Avalanches with blizzards with cold waves [Music] on with hail storms with ice storms with wildfires with heat waves with drought with volcanic eruptions with tornadoes you get the picture with tsunamis and thunderstorms with tropical Cyclones with Bloods and earthquakes with killer fogs with with flash floods with pandemics epidemics and biological Earth Warfare but the believer in Christ doesn't fear none of it for we realize it's the tender hand of Je Jehovah provoking you to live and get in his presence where all things are possible for you for your family that's the Hiding Place Christ in you the hope of glory oh stop letting the kids look at the superheroes of of Satan no show them the Heroes of Faith read in the Bible go back to a family [Applause] altar watch verse 17 of Revelations 12 let me say this here is where the the wise is caught away raptured and the foolish the remnant of the woman remains for a Great Tribulation watch how the Bible is written remember the first verse began he says and I saw in heaven he a woman dressed with the sun verse one verse 17 this is the same woman chapter 12 has been talking about her the whole time down but in verse 17 it says and the dragon was wroth with the woman it's the mystical body of Jesus Christ this is the wife of the Lamb and he went to make war with the remnant of her seed what happened to the woman shouldn't it say and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the woman it don't say that it says and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed because see this woman these 10 virgins these Believers are two classes of people wise and foolish Satan the dragon goes after the woman Christ the Believers of this end time message and the dragon was wroth with the woman in the a Rapture takes place and the wise are taken and the and the foolish remain which is called remnant of the woman's SE and the dragon was wroth with a woman and when he couldn't find her he went ahead and went after the foolish virgin and the foolish virgin were keeping the Commandments of God have the testimony of Jesus Christ they were Justified they were Sanctified but they hadn't gone to The Next Step they didn't have the oil so when when the wise were raptured then those Believers that didn't have the oil the baptism of the Holy Ghost they were left behind for a Great Tribulation where the wise go with their two great wings of Revelation to the wedding supper of the [Applause] lamb now Matthew 25 and 5 again the Bible says while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept it's a parable it's not lital if you're tired this morning sleep this doesn't pertain to you that's taking something literal we all come tired at times no in Luke [Music] 16 verse 20-31 it's the parable of the Fifth Dimension and this Dimension was a divided dimension one side is a prison House of Torment hell the other side is a peaceful place of waiting and both sides are waiting for the white Throne Judgment of Matthew 25 verse 31-46 brother bam said in in the message the 10 virgins he says all the way down through he says both all died they slumbered and slipt as they went down through now they're not lost but they've just slumbered and slept they're waiting see I didn't say they was dead but they're slumbering sleep in Christ these were the Saints from from the Ephesian CH All Through the Ages both died wise andish through seven Church ages and to the wise and the foolish in the Ephesian age he says I'll give you to eat of the Tree of Life to the Believers who died in the Smyrna age thou faithful unto death he that overcometh should not be hurt by the second death to the Believers in the pergamus church he told them I'll give you to heat eat of the Hidden mana and we'll give him a white stone [Music] Revelation and in the stone a new name written what new name the name you thought wouldn't make it your name you start seeing your name in the promises of God which man knoweth except he that receiveth it and you can read the Bible and look in the mirror of his word and say that's me Lord in the Tira age to those who slept and slumbered he said hold fast till I [Music] come I will give you the morning [Applause] star to the s to the Saints and Sardis he says I will not blot out your name once you see your in the book I'll give you a promise I will never blood out your name he says and the same shall be clothed in white rment I'll clothe you with a sun from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet to the Saints in Philadelphia he says I'll write upon you my new name and to us in L he said If any man any woman hears my voice and opens the door of their heart I Jesus will come in through your heart the leing church age it was the time of the 11th Hour believers we are in the 11th Hour both wise and foolish both Greeks and barians during World War II the Doomsday Clock was established by the scientific Community they felt that the Second World War had brought us to minutes before the Midnight Hour or what they believed was the total Destruction of the whole world scientific and symbolic clock was created to measure how close modern events were taking us to the end of the world but for us as Believers modern events are made clear by the that's how a Believer recognizes his day in his message it's the Holy Spirit Revelation in verse six of Matthew the Bible says and at the midnight hour Resurrection there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him only the wise can hear that cry one Cry of the Lord himself it had three manifestations each one designed to take us closer to take us higher to take us deeper in Christ that was the shout that was the voice of the Archangel that was the Trump of God that was Paul opening the mystery adding details to the ending of the 11th Hour the day that we're living living in to the Midnight Cry but he wasn't revealing it at yet he too spoke it in a parable it takes a revelation to know that that Parable is unfolding our days Paul said for the Lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first verses 1-6 is another parable of that same 11th hour it's a parable of seven Church ages and the calling and the choosing of the mystical body [Music] of Jesus Christ and the reward is the same to all the saints throughout seven Church ages that are part of this body of Christ reward is eternal life read the parable verses 1- 16 you find at the end when the when the last workers were coming in and they received the same pay as the first workers it was a parable wasn't natural wasn't natural the same the days of Paul and the apostles reive the same eternal life that we re Isaiah the prophet that history tells us they took a saw and saw them in pieces you and I who hope to go in a Rapture and a body change we all reive the same reward a new body a Celestial body eternal life now Matthew 25 and7 the Bible says then all those V all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for they never had any oil for our lamps are gone out the Bible speaks that they had a vessel and they had a lamp the vessel is where the oil went and the lamp was the wick that went in in into the the lamp was the wick that went into the vessel the lamp would pull up the oil and when you would light the lamp the wick if there's oil in the vessel it draws up the oil and it begins to burn and it stays lit as long as there's oil in the vessel the Light of Christ keeps burning in your life then you're a lamp to the world because the oils in the vess the foolish virgin those without the oil and yet they're sincere in love God the gospel always touches their hearts it lights their lamp but when they leave there's no oil to keep the fire burning as the head of their homes and they struggle to be a real testimony as a father and a [Music] husband because they need the Holy Ghost the oil and yet they love God they come to church oh but you must be born again the oil of God the fire of the Holy Ghost to make you the kind of dad you want to be to make you the kind of mom you really want to be you don't want to be a scouting a a shouting screaming father no you want to say it come here come here daughter you want to tell her there's a better way to live believe me I've made all the mistakes I want you to fall in the same [Music] on so don't pull out a big old bounce I'll teach you to the no no no [Music] no no no you won't bring them to cross to the cross with [Music] violence no you'll bring them to the cross with the love of God put the sticks away put the belt away don't CH at them anymore no no you ever seen that little video la excuse me yeah no we're no more no more the love of God the love of God Matthew 25:7 then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps that means that they lit the wick they lit the wick they trimmed their lamps but they couldn't keep the fire burning in their hearts because there's no oil in the vessel do you get it verse eight and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil and the wise said we can't give the oil we're like you we can only receive it but the wise answered saying verse [Music] n not so lest there be not enough for us and you you cannot give of your oil for you and I receive it in little measure it's called the refilling of the Holy Spirit until our cup is overflowing and a Rapture takes place the wise answered verse n not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut the marriage is [Music] complete when a bride is raptured right now we are the bride of Christ but we're also his wife remember Jewish tradition a woman that was engaged to be married the Bible says betro she was already considered the wife but they but but until then sometimes it would take a whole year that year was a year of preparation for that young lady to be preparing preparing her dress preparing her shoes preparing her attitude for the day of that wedding when the two would come together in a union then she that was betroth the betrothed wife would come would come to be the wife of that man then he was allowed to catch her away and take her where the bride of Christ being clothed with the sun one day when our cup runneth over there will be a resurrection the dead in Christ shall rise we which are alive and remain will be caught up the marriage will be a complete Union and the husband will catch us away to live with him eternally now verse 10 of Matthew 25 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut what door was shut remember Revelations 3 Jesus said to the Lan Church behold I stand at the door and knock if any open the door I will come in and take you to the wedding supper of the Lamb scripture connects with scripture and your Revelation grows and your faith grows and your hope grows and your Assurance grows and your trust in him grows verse 11 afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us the problem was when they finally came and said open to us the revelation of the seven seals Jesus said I've been knocking at your door for days for weeks for months for years and you never opened it you were the one who could open it I was the one knocking wanting to come in to your hearts and while the bride and while they went to buy verse 11 afterward came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us us but he answered and said verely I say unto you I know you not they're not lost but they're not going in a Rapture remember the serpent the dragon was wroth with the woman and then the Bible says Comm so the serpent went after the woman's SE the the remnant of the woman's seed that's this time the wise were taken the foolish stayed behind and the devil's going to chase them down in a Great Tribulation they will give their lives for the gospel but had they opened their heart they wouldn't have to be in a Great Tribulation you'd be quickened quick changed and translated by the power of the Holy Spirit verse 12 but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh this time of the wise and foolish is also the time of the coming of the son of man this is Jesus Christ at his second coming this time where was the son of man Ministry it was in the voice of many Waters go to them that sell and buy he said that's the six-fold ministry of Jesus Christ you say oh no it's just the five-fold ministry brother Daniel are you forgetting like so many ministers forget the importance of the head of the house it's not the pastor's job to go to your house and set your house in order he's supposed to set this house in order and anoint you with a word for you to set your house in order so that all the houses of God can be under the anointing of the Holy Spirit waiting for Rapture in faith to take us from here so let me say again the sixfold ministry of Jesus Christ that includes the head of every home and many helps in the church as the Apostle Paul preached but how shall we buy because it's a supernatural realm Isaiah 55 and verse one oh everyone that thirst this Come Ye to the waters and he that haveth no money Come Ye byy and eat come buy wine and milk without money without price because the price was paid on the cross of Calvary when the lamb was slain when at the foundation of the world when God killed the lamb to dress Adam and Eve that's when the blood was shed the blood that washes me white as snow the blood that wants to wash you white as snow come and eat for the price has been paid verse two says as wherefore do you spend money and your labor for satisfy why do we spend so much time on the internet [Music] for something that really satisfy us not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good not that which is bad and let your soul Delight itself in the word in fatness the prophet said verse three incline your ear and come unto me in other words meditate on his word night and day and I will make an everlasting even the sure mercies of Dave David another parable that will add detail to the 11th hour and the Midnight Cry the time of the Rapture in Luke 17 it was a scripture the prophet took it took us to many times for it was Parables that were coming to pass in this in this in our Century Luke 17 and verse 34 The Scribe Luke The Physician he said I tell you in that night the night of Matthew 25 the night that the 10 virgins were waiting for I tell you in that night of Matthew 25 there be two men in a bed the one shall be taken the other shall be left in the age we're living right we we go uh oh what do you mean two men in a bed of the words of Jesus verse 35 said there will be two women taken the other left verse 36 two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken the other left and they said unto him where Lord he said unto them wheresoever the body is what body the body word of the son of man [Applause] Jesus Christ in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was meant flesh and he dwelt Among Us the Bible says wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered together the word Eagles lets us know the age that this is it's the age it's the eagle age it's a time of an eagle anointing did you notice how the Holy Spirit weaves in a detail here to confirm what he has already in all three examples they're all the same gender it's to many men it's two women it's two men they are the same in what sense are they the same remember it's a parable tells us they the same the fact that it's two women tells us they're the same the same what they're Believers in other words all 10 of them are virgin all 10 of are believers Believers of what the end time message brother Daniel are you saying that this foolish virgin is in this message yes indeed there might be a few still in the denominations but the largest group of them is in this message they're Justified they're Sanctified they're virgins all because if you put if you put and keep yourself in the hands of a denomination it won't be a virgin birth how could you take a little girl and give her to a and have her raised in a house come back 10 years later what do you think they'll have done to that innocent little child they'll have turned her into a harlot too you cannot belong to the great Harlot and her daughters and expect to come out clean but if the voice of God calls you come out of her my people it's because he wants to wash you with the blood of Jesus and clean you up that you won't be partakers of her sins no more it's the syst that corrupts the people it's the Holy Spirit that can set them free even this [Applause] morning in the message the seed is not air with a shook bam preached in 1965 he says now it's seed time or bride time the sh dead the Shucks are dried up the Virgin word time not touched it's a virgin remember a virgin word if you put in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be virgin it'll be manhandled you get to it but God's Church he says hallelujah hallelujah it's a virgin born word of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh how wonderful I love it I believe it I know it's the truth she'll not be touched there'll be no denominational manhandling Amen in the Virgin birth of the Bride she is commanded by God she is commanded by God to come out of it and touch not her unclean things remember how Matthew 25 begins it said then shall the Kingdom of [Music] Heaven be likened into 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom a prophet said if you put it in the hands of a [Music] denomination these 10 virgins it sure won't be virgin so what time is Matthew 25 it's bride time and 10 virgins are 10 Believers Prophet said of the foolish virgin foolish virgin he says you couldn't put a finger on their lives the message the sudden secret going away of the church he said how many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins some were wise and some foolish virgin means Purity they were all good people every one of them vgs Sanctified vessels of God but those who had but those who had oil in their lamps went in and the others was left out they were all virgins everyone people that you couldn't put your finger on them for anything wrong they everyone believed in the coming of the Lord they were getting ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil go out don't let don't let that be your case keep oil in your lamp oil is the holy spirit never let it drain from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to Christ and to the cause quickly go who has the Fountain of oil and bu for yourself a filling of the Holy Spirit our nation is gone morally corrupted and ruined our politics are corrupted and gone our leaders are corrupted and gone oh God what can we do about it you could put a good man in [Music] it and he comes out a crook he comes out a crook and there's only and there's only one we can bring now that's the Lord Jesus let's make ready for his coming that's what a prophet said of the foolish virgin but that's not all he said he told us the foolish virgin they are sheep and they'll be saved he said it in the message the patmas vision 1960 he said brother brandham they ask him a question are the five foolish virgins of Matthew 25 counted as the Gentile Remnant I understand that the five foolish virgins were saved but have to go through the Great Tribulation if so what's their final destination could they be the Sheep which are divided from the goats in Matthew 252 brother brandham said here's Aion I think so too that they are the remnant the the sleeping virgin is the remnant spoke of in Revelation Revelations 12 of the woman seed that keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ so now the prophet has hooked Matthew 25 to Revelations 12 he says this is the same time one is adding more detail to other the prophet connected Matthew 25 with Revelations 12 and Luke 17 all coming together adding more details so we can recognize our day in its message he said brother bam says this a woman will take a piece of cloth and lay it down and she begins cutting it she takes her pattern places it the way she desires it the way she's going to cut it and then what's left over is the remnant this is the foolish virgin she's made of the same cloth a prophet said they are also sheep they're not goats and they will be saved in the message 10 verse a prophet tells us again you've heard him say that there are three kinds of Believers he pre he preached a message and he called it three kinds of Believers he said there are three kinds of Believers one two three he drew three circles he did it on a board he was teaching and he says this one here is the unbeliever I'll put a u right there he says this is the make believer he says I'll write make believer there and here is the believer but in this circle of the Believers he said there's two classes of people did you hear ever hear him say that if you haven't keep reading don't put a period on what you think's a revelation because there's more and there's more and there's more so in this message he saids now this Remnant was the sleeping virgin that he spurted the water from his mouth to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed he say now what is the remnant now there you have to get these types together there is a church which is church natural maybe I can draw it here and make it a bit pler brother Neville if I can take up some of your time you just forgive me he says now remember that there is what the unbeliever that's the sinner another one which is formal a formal church and then there is the other one which is the saved church now keep them in mind all the time but now in this saved Church there's two classes in this church right here and right here which was typed by Christ one of them was a sleeping virgin or the foolish virgin or or the foolish virgin and the other one had all in the lamp how many remembers the story we're going to get to it in just a minute those are the things a prophet said about the foolish virgin but that's not all he said he also said this in the message that seventh seal he says now what happened they were purged during the time of the awful tribulation period Speaking of the foolish virgin now if God's going to purge that virgin that was a good woman but she failed to get the oil in her lamp and he's going to purg her through pers ution and he puts those 12 tribes right in there for the same time and purges them during the time of the tribulation period because that tribulation period it's a purging time it's judgment oh do you see it what did he say about that foolish virgin she's a good how good the foolish virgin does not take the mark of the beast the foolish virgin does not suffer torment in Hell a prison house for those who have rejected Christ she's not there but instead she's on the paradise side of this Fifth Dimension awaiting a white Throne judgment where she's a virgin where she's an Eagle where she is the sheep in Matthew 25:31 listen now as we be closing to this white Throne judgment good woman stands to be judged before almighty God the only just judge in verse 31 of Matthew 25 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory the whole world is being judged here verse 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats it's terrible it's in symbols and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand the Sheep the foolish virgin judgment begins it's a principle laying in the word say unto them on his right hand this foolish virgin Come Ye father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world do you see she's not lost then he says then he reads out the reason why that he gave them eternal life because while he sat on the throne above and looked down on Earth he saw the way the foolish was living they were virgins they were foolish because they didn't get the oil they were foolish because they didn't take it serious I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost other than that they were living a life this is the kind of Life they were living this is God testifying of the life of the foolish virgin on Earth for for I was in hungered and you the foolish virgin you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in I was naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visit me I was in prison and you came unto me the foolish God is saying this is what I saw them do then shall the righteous answer him the foolish the righteous of God who died in a Great Tribulation they say Lord when saw we thee in hunger and fed thee you see the humility of this lady of the foolish virgin when saw we thee and hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee all the humility of these sheep or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto the foolish virgin verely I say unto you in so much as you've done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me but while he's telling the foolish virgin this where are the wise they're standing next to him helping them judge the Nations they're whispering to the king I know them I know how good they treated me they just needed the oil the king says don't worry don't worry little bride I've got something an inheritance I've had for them plann since the foundation of the [Applause] world I will save [Music] them and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me so this foolish virgin who is she virgin or virgin believer unbeliever believer eagle or Crow Eagle sheep or goat sheep she's the remnant of the woman's seed or is she the serpent seed no she's the same kind of material as the wise Cut From the Same Cloth she's the remnant of the woman's seed now ask yourself the foolish virgin is she your friend or she your foe I want to tell you you'll not have a better friend on this Earth she's your friend let me read you once again her Deeds for though she misses rapturing faith and a superatural body change at the white Throne judgment these sheep of God are exonerated of all sin for their Godly deeds and lifestyle both before and after a Great Tribulation let me read you again her Deeds when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of Glory seated there with his with his with his wife with a with his Queen and before him all the before him shall be gathered all the nations and he shall separate them one from another here's all the Americans here's all the Germans here's all the Swiss here's all the Mexicans here's the Africans he'll separate them all and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and the foolish virgin are made up of all the nations too of every Tong of every Kindred tongue and nation and he shall set set the sheep on his right hand and the Goat on his left the great white Throne judgment room is set then the judge stands up and he shall say unto them to the Sheep Come Ye blessed of my father they weren't expecting to hear that they were expecting the Judgment Rod of God to strike them down but instead the king stood the the the judge of all the world and he tells his sheep this foolish virgin Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world in other words I'm going to take you with me we're going back to Eden then he says the reason I'm taking you with me because when I was hungry you gave me meat remember when I was thirsty you gave me a full glass of water remember when I was a stranger you didn't ignore me you took me in when I was naked you clothed me when I was sick you visited me when I was in prison you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord we don't remember when we saw you hungry and F we don't remember when you were thirsty Lord I don't ever remember giving you a drink [Music] personally I don't know when that that you I saw you as a stranger and took you into my home I don't remember when you were naked I clothed you or I don't remember when I saw you sick or in prison you say I came running to you then the king shall answer and say unto them of course you don't remember you don't have to because I do and I say unto you in as much as you've done it unto one of the least you've done it unto me foolish virgin because the kindness you showed to the wise virgin I give you eternal life and the wise virgin the queen Whispers to the King thank you because I love them cuz they helped me I told them look for the Holy Ghost get the oil so you don't have to go through a Great Tribulation I know they didn't get it but Lord surely you can save them now I am adapter both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as is in me so as much as is in me I came ready to preach the gospel to you who are here in Albuquerque New Mexico this Parable as many of them are is really to provoke a very personal question that you must ask yourself or allow me to ask or better yet we let the Apostle Paul ask you this great man of God Acts 19 And1 it says this Luke The Physician wrote the testimony and it came to pass that while apolla was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said unto him we have no s we have not so much has heard whether there be any holy ghosts and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized they said unto John's baptism you know something like father son Holy Ghost then said Paul John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this Revelation struck their hearts and they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and proph side and all the men were about 12 so I ask you this morning I said all these things took so much of your time just to come to ask you this one question have you received the Holy Ghost since you said you believe this message Peter said therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God ha made the same Jesus with whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ when they heard this 2,000 years ago when they heard this they were pricked in their heart said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren yesterday we were screaming crucify him but today what can we do to be saved in other words I'm telling you words I'm telling you forget what you did yesterday in the past look to Jesus this morning say what can I do to live better from this day forward now when they heard this they were picked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what we do therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made this same Jesus in Christ he wants to be Lord in Christ in your life then Peter said I know your past I know the wicked life you've lived but today you're asking what can I do now I say repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and you'll begin taking taking steps eternal life so the purpose of this par is have I received the Holy Ghost since I believe if the answer is yes then the my next question is this how long has it been since you or I have received a refilling of that blessed Holy [Music] Spirit 1 Corinthians 1 and 23 but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called this morning both Jews and Greeks Christ power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolish n of God is wiser than men in other words the foolish virgin God's sheep are wiser than the men of this world and the weakness of God is stronger than men in Romans Romans chapter 1 will be closing soon Paul said concerning his son Jesus Christ Our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the Flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of Holiness by the resurrection from the dead because of this the Holy Spirit now brings us justification by faith brings us sanctification by the spirit knocks at our door to bring us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all three of these together is a friendship restored with the father as Adam had in Eden [Music] what is this baptism of the Holy Ghost the father standing at the Throne of your heart as a Watchman guarding the city you that City he's [Music] guarding then come the greatest battles you'll ever fight in your mind and heart but you're not alone now you've got a friend in Jesus he's the author and finisher of your faith and every victory that he gives you is a refilling of that Holy Ghost your cup he keeps filling it's the Watchman guiding your steps into Perfection you're a son and daughter being adopted by the Father David in the Psalms anointed of the spirit speaks of this experience it's the experience in a parable Psalms 23 this is how the Born Again experience begins the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down and Green Pastures now you're Justified he leadth me beside the Still Waters he's washing you with the water of his word now you're Sanctified he restoreth my Soul now you're born again he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake adoption has begun yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil our greatest battles are being fought for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me oh let me tell you when you have had this experience You've Got a Friend in Jesus who Stith closer than a brother thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies the wedding supper of the Lamb the end time message once again in parables thou anointest my head with oil my cup Toth Over The Parables revealed to our hearts is bringing the revelation of those Seven Seals he's bringing refilling after refilling this is the house that God wants you to build but what house have you been building what house will you build him what house will I build them together let's build them a house that he'll be pleased to dwell in many years ago the lord gave me a poem and in closing now I really am going to close now I'd like to read you this poem it goes like this I was sitting one day studying sitting down reading the Bible I was tired I was falling asleep I I I I just couldn't catch the anointing of the Holy [Music] Spirit I Clos my Bible I said I just need to lay down and rest and when I close the Bible it's like down in my heart I heard something say pick up your [Music] pen I grabbed it a little Notepad and and immediately these words started to come to me this is it these are the words sunrise to sunset I will seek your [Music] face knowing the victory that awaits me when I make you first place fasting and prayer is where I'll wait for you in my prayer closet where your promises come true it's not a busy place where the multitudes abide it's the secret of your Pavilion where bride and groom reside I know it's the best way and yet I try it last only to be defeated by Satan's ugly blast I dedicate myself again to the prayer closet with my friend who listens so atten to every word I say but when I listen quietly to every word he speaks he gives me all the strength I need to hear him say you're free free from the sickness free from the pain free from the lust free from the shame freedom freedom freedom free at last in my little prayer closet When I close the door at last shalom shalom and I yield the sacred desk to your pastor in Jesus name the Lord bless you all thank you for your patience for your attentiveness God bless
