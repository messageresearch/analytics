[3:03] night
[3:06] now my wife said don't you say this but
[3:09] I'm got to say it
[3:13] any I'm sorry I said Empire this morning
[3:16] instead of an
[3:24] Umpire Billy sitting back there said
[3:26] there he
[3:28] goes
[3:31] I said the Empire it has to have an
[3:33] Empire I me an
[3:38] Empire God oh I'm like they said about
[3:41] the Dutchman you know don't take me for
[3:43] what I say but what I
[3:46] mean praise the Lord I said I think they
[3:50] understand me after all these years amen
[3:53] you know this is about this is 30 years
[3:56] I've been behind this Pulpit here 30
[3:59] years in this Tabernacle y'all be
[4:02] knowing me but this time shouldn't you
[4:04] oh my my education is sure limited but I
[4:09] I don't can't talk but I make a truthful
[4:11] noise to the
[4:14] Lord praise God and brother I believe
[4:18] was Dr lamza of the Lamy Bible at in the
[4:23] translation said one time I was speaking
[4:26] and I didn't know he was there and he
[4:28] come back and was talking about the year
[4:31] of mundum and then he was speaking of
[4:33] that light and he said what's the matter
[4:36] with these people today and how I said
[4:38] he said the reason that people the
[4:40] translators could not translate the
[4:43] Bible correctly that the translators
[4:46] tried to translate in a high Yiddish and
[4:49] Jesus speaking
[4:51] spoke in the common class just like the
[4:54] street people spoke you know there's a
[4:57] scripture over and Luke said the common
[4:59] people heard him gladly he spoke in
[5:02] their
[5:03] language I hope that's so
[5:07] again
[5:10] Lord we are happy for the Lord now I
[5:15] know I see them ladies standing around
[5:18] it's bad enough to see men standing let
[5:20] Al them girls and boys and ladies and so
[5:24] forth standing around the walls and
[5:25] little children but we just haven't got
[5:28] the adequate seat meeting room so we
[5:30] pray that that next time we have the
[5:34] meetings after this week after this time
[5:36] you know the next thing up as far as we
[5:38] know is those Seven Seals and the Lord
[5:42] willing we start on them just
[5:44] immediately as soon as the church is
[5:46] over uh built so we can get in here
[5:48] we're coming in for a
[5:50] rededication and maybe anywhere from 1
[5:53] to two and maybe three week straight
[5:54] meeting now uh coming up for the uh the
[6:00] seals so we're expecting a great time in
[6:03] the Lord during that time and we'll all

[6:08] the cards and everything and let you
[6:09] know just exactly the time maybe a week

[7:03] and they take my messages and go from
[7:05] hospital to hospital from house to house
[7:07] uh playing the tapes now that isn't not
[7:10] giving up that's not retiring that's
[7:13] holding the faith to the end dying with
[7:15] a sword in the hand that's the way to go
[7:18] that's the way I want to do and
[7:21] then and she said you know if I get out

[8:13] Kentucky where you somebody had to guard
[8:15] you with a rifle to get up the hill
[8:17] where you went to preach oh my then I
[8:20] think must I be carried home to heaven
[8:23] on a fly bed of ease While others fought
[8:26] to win the prize and sail through bloody
[8:28] sea
[8:30] I must fight if I must reain increase my
[8:32] courage Lord and I want his support by
[8:36] his word that's what I want to amen now
[8:39] I suppose the recorders are going
[8:43] now oh yes I got I'm sorry little sister
[8:48] had a baby here this morning she wanted
[8:51] dedicated and I told her which sure do
[8:53] it tonight and now and tomorrow night
[8:56] we'll have dedication of babies healing
[8:59] Services everything that we possibly can

[11:28] people they call infinite infant baptism
[11:33] in the Methodist Church and many of the
[11:35] others and they sprink them with water
[11:38] when they're babies now that's all right
[11:42] so far as I concerned but we always try
[11:45] to State just what the Bible says here
[11:48] in the Bible there no never was such a
[11:51] thing as baptizing and in nowh done in
[11:55] history to the early Catholic Church for
[11:58] we know of which was
[12:02] all so that's just the way of
[12:10] saying
[12:15] inter but in the Bible they brought
[12:18] little children to Jesus that he might
[12:20] bless them and he put his hands up on
[12:23] him and bless him and that we still
[12:26] continue that now let us th our
[12:30] head our heavenly father this young
[12:34] woman and young man come tonight with
[12:38] this lovely little Rebecca that has been
[12:43] given to them and their charge to raise
[12:47] in the amination of God and they bring
[12:50] it tonight for

[13:03] to you this little
[13:06] Rebecca God be with her and bless her
[13:11] bless her father and mother may they all

[16:29] [Music]
[16:38] [Music]
[16:42] now I'm going to ask just a little favor
[16:46] for of the Little
[16:49] Folks and all the teenage and I know
[16:53] it's hard you can't stand still very
[16:55] long because your limbs cramp
[17:00] but I'm approaching something
[17:03] tonight that I never did
[17:07] before and there's something that I am
[17:11] going to speak on that I have never
[17:14] thought of speaking on such a
[17:17] thing that's the reason this morning I
[17:20] did not want to place that time before
[17:24] the
[17:25] message and I never got through
[17:29] talking about my absolute and I don't
[17:33] think I ever will I hope I never do he's
[17:36] so
[17:38] wonderful but tonight I'm going to speak
[17:41] on something
[17:43] that I do not
[17:46] know and now that's quite a thing for a
[17:50] minister to say that he's going to speak
[17:52] on something that he doesn't know
[17:55] about but I am adventur ing out to the
[18:00] best of my knowledge to that this
[18:03] church might
[18:06] understand and I would not by no means
[18:11] hold anything back from you that's
[18:15] profitable and then this tape I suppose
[18:18] the boys are making the
[18:20] tape
[18:22] and if you happen to get the tape
[18:27] whoever is listening to the
[18:29] tape
[18:31] remember if something is puzzling to you
[18:34] don't say it l it's on the
[18:38] tape don't say something contrary to
[18:41] what's on the
[18:43] tape so many ride in on the Serpent's
[18:47] Seed and say that I said such and such
[18:50] uh go get the tape play it over I did
[18:52] not say it that way see uh people
[18:56] misjudge things that's right you know
[18:58] Jesus one time after his resurrection
[19:01] was walking down the shore with the
[19:03] apostles and John was leaning on his
[19:05] bosom and they said what will happen to
[19:08] this man Jesus said what is it to thee
[19:11] if he terries till I come and there went
[19:14] out of saying that John was going to
[19:17] live to see Jesus come and the scripture
[19:19] says how be it he never said it that way
[19:22] see he he never said that he just said
[19:25] what is it to you if he terries I come
[19:29] he never said he would T but see
[19:32] misunderstanding is so easy and now it's
[19:36] it's not that I'm condemning someone for
[19:38] doing it because I do it
[19:42] myself and all people does it if the
[19:45] apostles who walk with our Lord
[19:48] misunderstood him and they never did
[19:50] clearly understand him right it last
[19:53] they said Lord now we understand now now
[19:58] we believe and we are sure that no man
[20:02] to tell you anything for thou knowest
[20:04] all things and Jesus said do you now
[20:08] believe see after all that time do you f
[20:12] did it finally get to you see that you
[20:15] believe and that's just human and we're
[20:18] all human so we're going to
[20:21] misunderstand but if it's kind of a
[20:23] little puzzling to you play the tape
[20:26] back yes listen closely say I'm sure the
[20:29] Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you then the
[20:33] little
[20:33] fellas if you just hold your
[20:37] amens the children just wait just a
[20:40] little while because I I want this to be
[20:44] surely gotten because many will not have
[20:47] the tape so I want you to be sure to get
[20:50] it and let's approach it for I say 35
[20:54] minutes or 40 just as reverently As We
[20:57] Know know how to do it because this is a
[21:01] tremendous time for me it's where
[21:04] something has happened that I don't know
[21:06] what to do and I'm standing in the most
[21:10] terrific straight I ever stood in in the
[21:13] days of my ministry as I know of so
[21:16] let's bow our heads now before we
[21:18] approach the
[21:21] word Heavenly
[21:23] Father then some time ago I preached
[21:28] upon the subject of
[21:32] presuming and presuming is to Adventure
[21:36] without
[21:39] Authority and maybe tonight Lord I have
[21:42] took upon myself to interpret something
[21:45] to the people without having a vision of
[21:50] it therefore
[21:52] Lord check me where the points is to be
[21:56] checked close close my mouth Lord you
[22:01] did close a lion's mouth in the den with
[22:04] Daniel that it did not hurt him and Lord
[22:09] I pray that if I should try to interpret
[22:12] something wrong you still have power to
[22:14] close a
[22:16] mouth but if it is the truth then Lord
[22:20] bless it and send it
[22:23] forth and you know the conditions and
[22:26] what's right at hand and that's why I
[22:30] come even to this very last moment at
[22:32] the pull pit to try to interpret these
[22:37] things now I pray thee to help us bless
[22:41] this little
[22:42] church this group that comes here under
[22:46] the roof that sojourns with us here in
[22:50] the city coming out of many
[22:53] states oh when the evening Shadows are
[22:57] falling we're so so glad to have a place
[22:59] to
[23:00] come when the world is so confused and
[23:03] do not know where they're standing we're
[23:05] glad that the name of the Lord is a
[23:08] mighty
[23:10] tower and the righteous run into it and
[23:12] are
[23:14] safe just not so many words but a
[23:19] revelation so we pray father as the
[23:22] evening lights would come at the setting
[23:26] of the Sun and we believe that that's
[23:28] the time that we're living in the
[23:30] setting of the
[23:33] Sun and we most solemnly thank thee Lord
[23:37] from all of our hearts for the things
[23:39] that you have done for us Lord down to
[23:43] the age I thank you for letting the
[23:47] visions that you have given every one of
[23:51] them just perfectly and every
[23:54] interpretation of dream has been exactly
[23:57] that way
[23:58] so we know it could only be you Lord for
[24:02] we are
[24:04] marals all born in sin and there's not a
[24:08] sound thing in
[24:10] us but to think that you could take such
[24:13] a thing as a human being and wash him by
[24:19] the water of the word and by the blood
[24:22] of Christ and stretch forth that hand in
[24:26] such a way to the person doesn't use her
[24:29] own thinking but let in the mind of
[24:32] Christ who knows all things let it come
[24:36] in and speak and use a
[24:41] tabernacle thank you Father now we bless
[24:46] thy holy
[24:48] name and we bless this little group
[24:51] tonight in thy name we bless the pastor
[24:55] brother Neville God's G ENT servant we
[24:59] bless the deacons the trustees and every
[25:02] member of the body of Christ both here
[25:05] and around the world in the name of the
[25:08] Lord Jesus oh as we see this
[25:13] dark dingy horrible Shadow falling
[25:17] across the face of
[25:19] Christianity we know the time is Drawing
[25:23] Near there will be a Rapture and the
[25:25] church will be taken up amen Lord let us
[25:30] march
[25:31] on looking to the author and
[25:34] finisher Christ granted Lord and as we
[25:38] move forward now in the name of the Lord
[25:41] Jesus to undertake these things that's
[25:44] been put up on our hearts we pray that
[25:47] you will be with us and help us and get
[25:50] Glory out of it Lord or we commit
[25:53] ourselves to you with your word in the
[25:56] name of Jesus Christ
[26:04] amen
[26:06] now if you got a pencil and
[26:10] paper uh I would like for you to write
[26:14] some things down as or anything that you
[26:17] wish to just have it
[26:20] ready and then on the
[26:26] tape all so if you wish to jot the
[26:30] scriptures down at any time because I
[26:32] believe it's the scripture that
[26:37] counts now we want to read a text
[26:40] tonight or read a scripture reading out
[26:43] of the book of the revelation of Jesus
[26:47] Christ and I believe that this is the
[26:51] revelation of Jesus Christ as written in
[26:53] the
[26:54] book and any other revelation that would
[26:58] be contrary to this Revelation would be
[27:02] wrong
[27:04] amen I believe that would bear quot
[27:07] quoting quoting
[27:10] again any
[27:13] Revelation that will not fit in with
[27:16] this
[27:17] Revelation and bring this Revelation to
[27:20] light is a wrong Revelation
[27:24] amen it must be scripture
[27:29] now in the 10th chapter of the book of
[27:32] the revelation of Jesus Christ I wish to
[27:34] read the first few verses the first
[27:38] seven verses 1 to
[27:40] 7 listen close
[27:44] now and pray for
[27:48] me and I saw
[27:51] another Mighty another Mighty Angel come
[27:56] down from Heaven clothed with a
[28:00] cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[28:04] head and his face as it were the Sun and
[28:09] his feet as pillars of
[28:12] fire and he had in his hand a little
[28:16] book
[28:19] open and he said his right foot on the
[28:23] sea and his left foot on the
[28:26] earth and he cried with a loud voice as
[28:30] when a lion
[28:32] roar and when he had cried seven
[28:35] Thunders ear their
[28:40] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[28:43] uttered their voices I was about to
[28:47] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[28:50] saying unto me seal up those things
[28:53] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[28:55] write them not
[29:00] and the angel which I saw standing upon
[29:04] the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[29:08] hands to heaven and swear by him that
[29:12] liveth forever and ever who created
[29:15] heavens and the thing that in them are
[29:20] and the earth and the things that
[29:23] therein are and the Sea and the things
[29:26] which there
[29:28] in that there should be time no
[29:38] longer but in the days of the voice of
[29:42] the seventh
[29:44] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[29:48] mystery of God should be
[29:51] finished as he has declared to his
[29:54] servants the prophets
[30:00] and my text if I should call it that
[30:04] tonight is this is this the sign of the
[30:10] end
[30:14] sir we all know that we're living in
[30:19] a
[30:20] a glorious time for the
[30:23] church but a horrible time time for the
[30:32] unbeliever and we're living in one
[30:36] of the most dangerous times of all all
[30:40] that ever was since the world
[30:43] began no Prophet no
[30:48] Apostle never in no
[30:51] time ever lived in such a time as we
[30:55] live now amen This is the End
[31:01] Amen it's written in the skies it's
[31:05] written over the face of the Earth it's
[31:08] written in every
[31:10] newspaper this is the end am if you can
[31:14] read the
[31:17] handwriting the prophets lived in the
[31:19] time when the handwriting was on the
[31:21] wall for a
[31:23] nation but we're living when the
[31:26] handwriting is on the wall for
[31:31] time all nations Earth everything time
[31:36] is at the
[31:40] end so we must search the
[31:43] scriptures to find the hour that we are
[31:47] living always a true prophet of God will
[31:52] go to the
[31:54] scriptures therefore he's
[31:58] absolute that it's going to be that
[32:01] way in the Old Testament when prophets
[32:04] said
[32:05] anything there always somewhere was a
[32:08] prophet with the word who stayed with
[32:11] the word he watched God for visions and
[32:14] if his vision was contrary to the word
[32:17] then his vision was
[32:21] wrong that's God's way of getting his
[32:25] word to his people can you hear me way
[32:28] back all
[32:31] [Music]
[32:34] right I just hardly know where to
[32:38] start
[32:41] now it has been a great privilege to
[32:45] me to know that this Tabernacle was my
[32:49] first
[32:52] church it's a glorious
[32:55] thing I shall never for forget though I
[32:58] jesus Terry and I would live to be
[33:01] hundreds of years old I remember the day
[33:04] I laid the Cornerstone there at the
[33:07] corner and the vision he gave me that
[33:11] morning of this
[33:15] Tabernacle and all of you remembered
[33:17] it's wrote in the
[33:19] books and it's
[33:21] absolutely been fulfilled to the
[33:24] letter not one bit of it
[33:31] missed and
[33:34] now I do not believe that there's
[33:38] anything that he has spoken all these
[33:41] years of my life that I have spoke to
[33:45] the people but what come to
[33:49] pass and many people has come with
[33:52] dreams that he's Let Me by his grace
[33:55] interpret for the people
[33:59] and many has come with dreams and with
[34:02] problems that I was unable to
[34:06] interpret but I haven't tried to
[34:08] introduce to you people a
[34:11] gimmick that has all the
[34:14] answers I've tried to be honest and to
[34:18] tell you what was truth and I could only
[34:22] tell you as he told
[34:25] Meen and then as it come to me then I
[34:30] could tell
[34:31] you and I want to warn you in this day
[34:35] that we're living in there's many not
[34:39] not seeing anything against people but
[34:42] when you see a person that's got the
[34:44] answer to everything that's contrary to
[34:47] the word
[34:49] amen Jesus said there was many lepers in
[34:52] the Days of Elijah but only one was
[34:55] healed
[34:57] in the many years the 80 or more that
[35:00] Elijah lived and one leper was
[35:03] healed many witow in the days of
[35:06] Elisha but he is only sent to
[35:10] one and we find out that there's many
[35:12] things that God
[35:14] does and that he doesn't reveal to his
[35:19] servants and no servant is greater than
[35:22] his Lord
[35:24] amen and then God will not share his
[35:28] glory with
[35:31] nobody he's God and when a servant
[35:35] becomes a place that he tries to take
[35:38] the place of God then God takes his life
[35:41] and moves him away somewhere or
[35:43] something we must remember
[35:46] that
[35:48] now in those
[35:51] visions and
[35:53] interpretations I cannot tell the
[35:55] interpretation of a dream until I see
[36:00] exactly by Vision what the dream was and
[36:05] many of you know that you've told me
[36:06] your dream and would not even tell it
[36:09] all and when I saw the dream come back
[36:13] to me I turned around and told you that
[36:17] there much of it you left out and tell
[36:19] you what you left out of
[36:21] it you know that's right if that's right
[36:24] say Amen you amen amen
[36:28] the things that you didn't tell me
[36:31] therefore you see if the like
[36:34] Nebuchadnezzar said if you can't tell me
[36:37] what I dreamed then how would I know you
[36:39] got the interpretation of it but all
[36:42] these
[36:46] Impressions we mustn't take them and say
[36:49] thus sayeth the Lord we mustn't do that
[36:52] we must have a direct voice and answer
[36:55] from God before before we can say it's
[36:58] God not an impression not a
[37:01] sensation no matter how much is pul say
[37:04] you might say I believe it could be this
[37:06] way but when you speak thus sayeth the
[37:09] Lord it's not
[37:12] you watch on the platform have you ever
[37:16] seen it
[37:18] fail thus sayith the Lord is
[37:21] perfect never has failed and as long as
[37:24] it is thus sayeth the Lord it can't
[37:28] fail but so far he's protected me
[37:32] because I've waited on him I haven't
[37:35] tried to seek popularity or being Glory
[37:38] of man I've tried my best to live humble
[37:42] and live the kind of a life that I think
[37:45] a Christian should live and I haven't
[37:47] been able to do that within myself but
[37:49] he has done
[37:51] it until this day I
[37:55] say
[37:57] that he is the one that's led me many
[38:01] things could be said this way but it
[38:03] take too long but all of you are aware
[38:07] of these things and the only reason I
[38:10] had you to say Amen a while ago you
[38:13] people that's told me dreams then i'
[38:15] come tell you uh what you left out
[38:18] because this message being
[38:21] taped man of all Nations will hear this
[38:26] and when they hear that amen then they
[38:27] know these voices there that's set under
[38:31] this ministry that knows better than to
[38:33] do anything wrong amen or to say Amen to
[38:38] something that's
[38:39] wrong amen is so
[38:42] big it's
[38:44] sanctioning
[38:47] now all my life since I've been a little
[38:52] boy there's been something that's
[38:54] bothered me
[38:58] and I've had a very odd life hard to
[39:02] understand even my wife scratches her
[39:05] head and say Bill I don't think anybody
[39:07] can understand
[39:09] you and I said I don't understand
[39:12] myself because I submit commit myself to
[39:17] Christ many years ago he does the
[39:20] leading I don't try to understand it I
[39:22] just go where he leads the best of my
[39:25] knowledge
[39:27] I'm thankful for a wonderful wife and
[39:30] children and for my wife and children
[39:33] who has
[39:35] confidence that I would not tell them
[39:37] anything wrong that they believe every
[39:40] time you tell them anything they hold
[39:42] right with it they know it I wouldn't
[39:44] tell them anything wrong and would I
[39:47] tell one of God's children anything
[39:48] wrong then not wey no sir God wants his
[39:52] children in the right kind of
[39:54] training and be honest with them and
[39:57] truthful with them and he'll bless it I
[40:01] believe
[40:02] now all along down through the
[40:06] Journey there's been things that's
[40:09] happened that I couldn't
[40:11] understand and one of the things that I
[40:13] could not
[40:15] understand was when it was a little boy
[40:17] and then Visions would come up on me and
[40:20] I'd see him and tell my parents the
[40:22] things that was going to happen they
[40:23] thought I was just nervous but the
[40:25] strange thing it happened just the way
[40:28] it said so you say was that before your
[40:31] conversion yes gifts and callings are
[40:34] without repentance the Bible said you're
[40:37] born in this world for some
[40:41] purpose and you don't your repentance
[40:43] don't bring gifts they are predestinated
[40:46] to
[40:47] you now along the
[40:51] road and when I was a little
[40:55] boy my my longing was I was
[40:59] dissatisfied in the country I lived
[41:02] in a long somehow to go
[41:07] west and I was operated on when I was
[41:12] shop when I was a little boy and when I
[41:14] come from under the first anesthetic I
[41:17] thought I was in torment Going Down The
[41:20] Ether had me out and I've been gone out
[41:23] for 8 hours I think they was worrying
[41:27] about getting me around to myself again
[41:29] they had a great operation with no
[41:31] penicillin blood both legs almost shot
[41:34] off of the
[41:35] shotgun a little boy friend let his gun
[41:38] go off and then about seven months later
[41:41] I took another anesthetic and when I
[41:44] come from under that anesthetic I
[41:45] thought I was standing out on the
[41:48] western prairies and a great Golden
[41:51] Cross in the sky and the glory of God
[41:54] shining down off of it me standing there
[41:56] like
[41:58] this when the light what you see on the
[42:02] picture tonight that's been proven to be
[42:05] a supernatural being by scientific
[42:09] research to me it was the same light
[42:12] that struck down St Paul is the same
[42:15] light that led the children of Israel By
[42:18] Night am did you notice of this Angel he
[42:21] was clothed in a cloud it was a cloud by
[42:25] day
[42:27] now that same
[42:31] light as to people not understanding
[42:36] first thought that it was wrong that I
[42:38] was just saying that but the Holy Spirit
[42:42] had to hide the scientific instruments
[42:45] and the people there for a Vindication
[42:47] and took the picture of it several times
[42:50] I said I see a person shattered to death
[42:53] black shadow over him a few weeks ago
[42:56] when I was in a city and when we're
[42:58] preaching you you're not supposed to
[43:00] take pictures you know while you're
[43:02] preaching and when same thing was when
[43:05] that was talk but someone had a camera
[43:07] and I said to a lady sitting out there
[43:09] stranger I was in in Southern Pines I
[43:13] said there is a shatter over this Miss
[43:16] so and so a lady that I've never seen in
[43:18] my life you just come from the doctor in
[43:21] two cancers one on each breast and
[43:23] you're given up you are shattered with a
[43:26] black hood to death and something said
[43:30] to a sister sitting by who had a flash
[43:32] camera said take the
[43:34] picture and she didn't want to do it yet
[43:37] take the
[43:39] picture and she still refrained and then
[43:43] again it come and she grabbed the
[43:45] picture and shot the picture and there
[43:47] it
[43:48] is scientifically it's on the bulletin
[43:51] board black hooded
[43:54] Shadow then then when the woman believed
[43:59] and prayer was made a picture shot right
[44:02] straight back behind it clear I said the
[44:05] shadow has
[44:07] gone the lady lives by the grace of God
[44:11] do you see what I mean if you'll tell
[44:15] the truth you may be laughed at for a
[44:17] while you may be misunderstood for a
[44:20] while but God will vindicate that that
[44:23] it is the truth if you just stay with it
[44:25] amen
[44:26] just hold
[44:27] on might take years but like in Abraham
[44:32] and others but he'll always make it to
[44:34] truth when that angel there and I
[44:38] suppose besides my wife there's people
[44:41] here tonight from 30 years ago that was
[44:44] standing close when that come down is
[44:47] there anybody in the audience now that
[44:48] was there when the angel of the Lord
[44:50] that come down on the river the first
[44:52] time before people raise up your hand
[44:54] yes there they are now I see Miss Wilson
[44:57] rais up her hand she was standing there
[44:59] and my wife there she was there and I
[45:00] don't know who some the rest of them is
[45:02] I was standing on the bank here before
[45:04] many many people when I was baptizing at
[45:07] 2:00 in the afternoon and right out of
[45:09] the brassy Skies where they had been
[45:12] rain for weeks here he come with a
[45:16] roar instead of John the Baptist was
[45:19] sent forth the for forun the first
[45:21] coming of Christ you're sent forth with
[45:23] a message to forun the second coming
[45:27] Hallelujah many man from business man
[45:30] the city was standing on the bank asked
[45:31] me what it meant I said that wasn't for
[45:33] me it's for you I
[45:36] believe on it went and when that angel
[45:39] left if you remember he went Westward as
[45:42] he went
[45:43] up right out up over the top of the
[45:46] bridge and went
[45:49] Westward later on I met an astronomer
[45:53] which is a magon
[45:56] and they told me of a constellation of
[46:00] stars that had come together and a
[46:04] certain
[46:05] constellation when the wise men in
[46:07] Babylon
[46:09] saw down towards Palestine this three
[46:14] stars in A constellation you've heard me
[46:16] tell it many times do you know that's
[46:20] proven these last couple of weeks to be
[46:22] the
[46:23] truth amen
[46:26] brother Stopman you have that paper with
[46:28] you tonight everywhere you are um it's
[46:32] in uh the paper a sheet of a Sunday
[46:35] paper December the 9th that a reporter
[46:39] went over there and they've dug up all
[46:41] these things that we are actually living
[46:44] now proven that we're this year coming
[46:47] up is
[46:49] 1900
[46:50] 70 7 years out of date by dug up rocks
[46:55] and proed that it's wrong it's later
[46:57] than you think
[47:01] amen I didn't see brother Fred
[47:04] somehow brother Stopman are you here do
[47:07] you have the paper with you brother
[47:08] sopan you he has the paper maybe
[47:12] tomorrow night I'll have you read it we
[47:13] haven't got time tonight so you can see
[47:16] and what's exactly those Magis Jewish
[47:20] Magis up in Babylon studying the
[47:24] Stars saw those stars fall into their
[47:27] constellation and when he did they knew
[47:30] that Messiah was on
[47:32] Earth and here they come into Jerusalem
[47:35] singing two years Journey where is he
[47:38] that's born King of the Jews up and down
[47:40] the streets they went and why is Israel
[47:43] laughed at him these bunch of Fanatics
[47:46] they never know nothing about
[47:48] it but the Messiah was on
[47:53] Earth and now
[47:56] you know the rest of the story what they
[47:58] said
[48:00] now we'll read that tomorrow night now
[48:04] coming to this that the Visions don't
[48:08] fail because they're from
[48:11] God and all along the journey it's been
[48:15] something pulling me tugging at me then
[48:19] when that maah told me these things when
[48:22] I was just the boy game w
[48:26] or before that I believe it was about
[48:29] these things and it scared
[48:32] me because I was afraid of of what the
[48:35] Magi
[48:37] was but later on I found out that the
[48:40] Magi of the Bible was right because God
[48:43] declares in heaven before he declares it
[48:45] on Earth Watching those heavenly
[48:48] bodies God's no respected person of all
[48:51] Nations said Peter now but those who
[48:55] fear in all nations God
[48:58] accepts and we find then I tried to give
[49:01] the thought up but oh it take hours to
[49:04] go in how the constate move that way
[49:07] move that way but I was scared of it
[49:10] this may joh said to me you'll never be
[49:12] successful in the
[49:14] East said you were born under a
[49:18] sign and said you that sign that
[49:21] constellation when they crossed way out
[49:22] in there the day of your birth they were
[49:25] hanging Westward and you must go
[49:29] Westward I said forget it I I had
[49:32] nothing to do with it and all along oh
[49:35] still that didn't take it out of my
[49:36] heart then when I was up there that
[49:38] night about these Visions I couldn't
[49:41] understand my Baptist Brethren told me
[49:43] that was of the devil and then when that
[49:46] angel appeared he absolutely thr it into
[49:50] the
[49:51] scripture and said as it was then when
[49:54] the priests were arguing about about
[49:55] things not knowing nothing about what
[49:57] kind of coats they she wearing clothes
[49:59] and everything and arguing about their
[50:01] differences the Ma J was following the
[50:04] star to Christ
[50:08] amen when the preachers said that Jesus
[50:12] was an impostor of bbub a devil raised
[50:16] up and said we know who you are the Holy
[50:18] One Of God why are you coming to tment
[50:20] us before the
[50:22] time when Paul and Silas came down pre
[50:25] the gospel of little fortune teller
[50:27] sitting on the
[50:29] street and the preachers of that country
[50:31] said these men are imposters they tear
[50:34] up our churches and so forth turning the
[50:36] world upside down with their
[50:38] corruption but what happened that little
[50:41] Mai that little fortune teller said
[50:43] these are man of God to tell us a way of
[50:45] life and Paul rebuked that spirit in her
[50:49] you didn't need any help to testify who
[50:50] he was Jesus always told him to hold
[50:53] their peace but it goes to show that
[50:56] sometimes Devils knows more about the
[50:58] things of God than preachers does they
[51:01] become so ecclesiastical bound that was
[51:04] so in the
[51:07] Bible and God doesn't
[51:11] change one day coming down five years
[51:15] ago from Brother
[51:18] Normans I was driving down the
[51:21] road and I just had a meeting up there
[51:25] and the Lord God appeared to me in a
[51:28] vision and I was sitting in front of my
[51:31] gate up here at my house and it seemed
[51:35] to be bad weather many of you people
[51:38] will remember the vision it's wrote in
[51:40] my book of Visions I put them down so I
[51:43] be sure that I don't forget them and in
[51:47] this Vision I saw there was something
[51:50] that had come through the
[51:53] lane and there was stones laying all
[51:55] over my yard and there was graters and
[51:59] scrapers up and down the lane and trees
[52:02] that been cut down and rooted
[52:04] up and I started to turn into the gate
[52:08] and it was all blocked off with
[52:10] stones and I got out to say to the man
[52:14] why this and he got very hostile shoved
[52:18] me backwards and said that's the way
[52:19] with you preachers I said I only ask you
[52:23] why do you do this you you're coming
[52:26] over on my side of the street you're why
[52:28] did you do this and he just almost
[52:31] slapped me and shoved me back and I
[52:34] thought I'm just going to tell him that
[52:38] he doesn't know what he's talking about
[52:40] and a voice spoke said don't do that you
[52:43] are a
[52:44] minister and I said very well and I
[52:47] turned around and to my right sitting in
[52:51] front of the gate was an old Prairie
[52:53] Schooner you know what a cover wagon
[52:56] with horses hitch to it and sitting
[52:59] opposite the driver's side was my
[53:03] wife I looked back in the back and my
[53:06] children was sitting back
[53:08] there I climbed up on the wagon I said
[53:12] to my wife honey I've stood all I can
[53:16] stand and I picked up the lines and
[53:18] pulled the lead
[53:20] hor and started heading Westward and a
[53:24] voice said to me
[53:25] when this comes to pass then go
[53:30] Westward brother Woods the contractor
[53:32] here at our church and Trust team how
[53:35] many remembers the vision now remember
[53:38] me telling you
[53:39] sure it's row down on paper and I said
[53:43] to brother Woods he bought from the
[53:46] church this lot in between there and he
[53:49] was going to build a stone house I said
[53:51] don't do it brother Woods call they
[53:52] would never give you your money out of
[53:54] it perhaps maybe that's years ago five
[53:58] years ago I said they're going to maybe
[54:00] bring that bridge through here and then
[54:03] stones are probably my basement bursted
[54:06] up and my walks and things laying out
[54:08] here instead of being Stones it hunks of
[54:10] concrete and then they'll go to put that
[54:13] down here because they said in the paper
[54:15] that's what they were trying to
[54:17] do well he did not build it finally they
[54:21] decided about a year later or two that's
[54:23] going to bring it through down this way
[54:25] so that settled it so I just forgot
[54:28] it and let it
[54:31] go now the strange thing
[54:36] happened about a year
[54:40] ago I was having Services one night down
[54:44] at brother Junior Jackson sitting right
[54:46] here a Methodist Minister that's
[54:48] received the Holy Ghost and been
[54:50] baptized into the name of Jesus Christ
[54:53] it's pastoring one of our sisters
[54:56] churches just to show you how
[55:01] God deals with this
[55:05] people I say this with all my
[55:09] heart I don't know of any congregation
[55:14] in the entire world a congregation
[55:17] together anymore where I believe the
[55:20] spirit of God is and in this
[55:23] congregation they got their differences
[55:26] they're sure not up to where they should
[55:28] be none of us but they're as close as
[55:31] anybody else that I know
[55:32] of I'll show you knowing what was going
[55:35] to
[55:36] happen brother Jackson Dreamed a Dream
[55:40] he couldn't get away from
[55:43] it and I was leaving his church and he
[55:47] just couldn't stand it how long ago has
[55:50] it been B
[55:51] Jackson I had the dream in February of
[55:54] 16
[55:55] February of
[55:57] 61 he had the dream and he come to me
[56:01] and he said something is on my heart I
[56:04] must tell you brother Brandon I said go
[56:07] on brother Jackson and he said I dreamed
[56:10] a dream and there it
[56:14] was I just sat
[56:16] still and I listen and watched he said I
[56:21] dreamed that there was a great big hill
[56:25] like out in a field where Bluegrass or
[56:28] something
[56:29] was and said up on top of this hill
[56:32] where the water had washed away the soil
[56:36] there was a top rock up on top of the
[56:39] hill like uh the top of the
[56:42] mountain it was Rock no grass and where
[56:46] the water had washed down it had cut
[56:49] some kind of readings on these
[56:52] stones and you were standing there
[56:55] interpreting this reading on these
[56:58] stones and said all of us and here's the
[57:01] way he put it said the brother from
[57:03] Georgia and from all around we were all
[57:06] standing together listening to you
[57:09] interpret that mysterious riding on
[57:12] those stone that
[57:14] mountain and said then you picked up
[57:17] something like from the
[57:18] air something like a wrecking bar or
[57:22] crowbar wasn't it brother something like
[57:23] that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said
[57:27] how you've done it I don't know and said
[57:30] you struck the top of that mountain
[57:33] ripped it around and lifted the cap of
[57:35] it off is in the shape of a
[57:38] pyramid and you ripped the top of it off
[57:41] now that was months and months and
[57:43] months before the pyramid message was
[57:46] preached and said beneath that was White
[57:50] Stone Granite and you said the Sun or
[57:53] the light has never sh shed on this
[57:56] before looking on
[57:58] this watch
[58:00] this and that's right because in the
[58:03] formation of the world the world was
[58:05] formed before there was light we all
[58:07] know that God moved up on the water and
[58:10] and then in the beginning he spoke for
[58:11] light and naturally if down under there
[58:15] in the age that formation was that light
[58:18] had never come upon that stone and he
[58:21] said look upon this light has never come
[58:24] upon it
[58:25] before and when all of them got up and I
[58:28] told him to watch
[58:30] that and all of them come up to look in
[58:33] but he said while they were looking in
[58:36] he looked out of the corner of his eye I
[58:37] believe it was and watch me I slipped
[58:40] off to one side and started going
[58:43] towards the West towards the setting of
[58:46] the sun coming up a hill going down a
[58:48] hill coming up a hill going down a hill
[58:51] getting smaller and smaller and went all
[58:53] the way out of sight
[58:56] and he said then when I did that he said
[59:00] then the Brethren turned around at you
[59:02] while and said did he vanish where did
[59:04] he go and said some tuck out that way
[59:08] some tuck one way and some another but a
[59:10] very few stayed and looked on to what I
[59:15] had told them now
[59:19] notice the interpretation of the dream
[59:22] which I never told him one thing or none
[59:25] of these did I tell any of
[59:28] them but I said yes and my heart shaking
[59:33] I was watching now the mysterious
[59:36] writing wait I'll just leave it for a
[59:38] little bit not long ago brother Beer
[59:43] Brother beer is usually with us are you
[59:45] here brother
[59:46] beer uh yes back here Billy said brother
[59:49] Beer's all tore up he had a strange
[59:52] dream I went to Brother beer
[59:55] and he said down to this house one night
[59:58] when I was going on some C and he said
[1:00:01] brother brandham I had a strange dream
[1:00:03] said I dreamed that I was going down a
[1:00:06] stream of water towards the
[1:00:09] west and there was a road on the left
[1:00:12] side and I was on the left side going
[1:00:15] Westward on the road seeming like
[1:00:17] hunting for
[1:00:19] cattle and on the right side I happened
[1:00:22] to notice after I got down there there
[1:00:24] you were and you were rounding up a big
[1:00:27] bunch of cattle and there was plenty of
[1:00:30] feet over there and said then you got
[1:00:34] those cattle and starred them back up
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:36] river and seemingly that must have
[1:00:39] nodded to him to watch those cattle and
[1:00:41] he said now it'll be easy for those
[1:00:44] cattle I know they'll go the way of
[1:00:45] least resistance but brother Brandon
[1:00:47] wants them to stay on the right side of
[1:00:50] that River so I'll go back up this road
[1:00:53] and keep them from coming across the
[1:00:55] river on this side and keep them on that
[1:00:57] side but he noticed I never followed the
[1:00:59] cattle but went on
[1:01:02] Westward he said he must be hunting
[1:01:05] Strays no more than he spoke the dream I
[1:01:09] saw
[1:01:10] it and then
[1:01:13] notice he said he got a little leery
[1:01:15] about me so he went back to look and
[1:01:18] said I was coming to a solid
[1:01:22] mountain and all at once that b
[1:01:25] Fin and he wondered what was wrong he
[1:01:27] went down and then he had a little
[1:01:29] stream on his side that forked off to
[1:01:31] the left I think that's right brother
[1:01:33] beer yeah and you noticed from and over
[1:01:36] on my side was a terrific
[1:01:39] Falls and then he thought I'm could have
[1:01:42] gotten those
[1:01:44] Falls and uh and uh perished then he
[1:01:48] noticed and he said he looked around he
[1:01:50] seen the effects of those Falls had went
[1:01:52] down this way and was causing RT well to
[1:01:55] spurt up but the water wasn't going back
[1:01:57] in the ground he looked across the
[1:01:59] little Branch a little stream and he
[1:02:02] seen some little animals with round
[1:02:05] ears he said I believe I'll take one and
[1:02:08] he crossed then he got thinking about me
[1:02:11] and he got up on a little nle to look
[1:02:13] over and see if there was a little bitty
[1:02:15] narrow ledge you know that I could have
[1:02:17] walked around but said there was nothing
[1:02:19] and he got weed he said what happened to
[1:02:22] our
[1:02:23] bre wonder what happened to brother
[1:02:25] brandham and when he got scared he said
[1:02:28] he heard me speak I stand up on top of a
[1:02:33] mountain I told Brother
[1:02:36] beer an interpretation of a dream that I
[1:02:40] give him not long ago and told him to
[1:02:42] wait on the Lord that someday i' meet
[1:02:45] him on an island and there he
[1:02:48] was now the interpretation of that dream
[1:02:50] is this in so much that the stream was
[1:02:53] large
[1:02:56] it was a stream of
[1:02:58] life I was going Westward on it and so
[1:03:00] is he because he was on a road he was
[1:03:03] running small down this road and on the
[1:03:05] other side was lots of grass but lots of
[1:03:08] thickets and BRS and jungle but in there
[1:03:11] was much grass and that's the way we
[1:03:14] hunt for the Lord in the food of the
[1:03:16] Lord too difficult rounding up the
[1:03:19] cattle was this
[1:03:21] church keeping them on that side cattle
[1:03:25] will actually go on the smooth Road the
[1:03:28] denomination if they can which the road
[1:03:31] represented denomination I started him
[1:03:34] back up the road to see that they did
[1:03:36] not go to any
[1:03:39] denomination in so much that he saw a
[1:03:41] wall that was totally impossible to pass
[1:03:45] that kept me from going west was that
[1:03:48] tax case with the
[1:03:50] government nobody can understand how I
[1:03:53] ever got out of it
[1:03:55] it was a wall that blocked me off but
[1:03:58] the Lord taken me through it and I was
[1:04:01] over I'll meet you brother beer on the
[1:04:04] island so now then immediately after
[1:04:08] that brother Roy Roberson brother Roy
[1:04:11] are you here tonight yes I believe what
[1:04:15] or the side he called me and he had a
[1:04:19] dream and he dreamed that we were
[1:04:21] rounding
[1:04:23] cattle now that is the third
[1:04:26] one rounding up
[1:04:29] cattle and it was grass belly de plenty
[1:04:33] of food all of us Brethren were
[1:04:36] together and we come to a place for
[1:04:40] dinner and brother Fred sofman raised up
[1:04:44] and said Elijah the great prophet will
[1:04:47] speak from here today at
[1:04:50] noon and then when we all had dinner
[1:04:54] everybody went
[1:04:55] away and he wondered why they didn't
[1:05:00] wait to hear it being
[1:05:02] spoke now see how that exactly curbs
[1:05:06] with brother Jackson see that exactly
[1:05:10] hits exactly what brother beer
[1:05:12] said no one waited to find
[1:05:16] out notice immediately after that sister
[1:05:21] Collins are you here sister Collins
[1:05:26] dreamed the dream of being here at the
[1:05:28] church and there was a wedding fixing to
[1:05:31] take
[1:05:33] place and when she did she saw the
[1:05:36] bridegroom come in
[1:05:38] perfect but the bride wasn't very
[1:05:41] perfect yet it was a bride now that's
[1:05:45] the
[1:05:46] church and there was like a communion or
[1:05:50] a a service going on you're like a
[1:05:53] dinner
[1:05:55] being
[1:05:56] set and it kind of got next year because
[1:05:59] that brother nville was serving a dinner
[1:06:02] in the church but she said it was the
[1:06:04] best food that she hadd ever seen she
[1:06:06] was so hungry but she thought maybe that
[1:06:09] in the dream that he shouldn't serve it
[1:06:12] and um she and brother Willard was going
[1:06:14] to go up to the ranch house and
[1:06:16] eat and when they did the light on the
[1:06:20] right hand side went
[1:06:23] out
[1:06:26] now you know what that
[1:06:28] is
[1:06:29] now the food the bride isn't perfect but
[1:06:34] the bridegroom is perfect the bride is
[1:06:38] not perfect yet but the food that was
[1:06:41] being given was not literal food it's
[1:06:44] the spiritual food that you've been
[1:06:46] having all
[1:06:48] along let me stop here on that fourth
[1:06:51] dream just a moment do you not remember
[1:06:55] brother Fred sofman brother Banks
[1:07:00] Woods when we was out in Arizona last
[1:07:03] year when we were out hunting havina
[1:07:07] hogs and the Lord spoke don't you know
[1:07:10] the things he done perfectly showing
[1:07:12] what would come to pass as we went along
[1:07:15] the
[1:07:16] road if that's right YouTu brother say
[1:07:21] Amen never misses
[1:07:24] and I saw in a vision while we were
[1:07:28] driving one
[1:07:29] day um a vision of the Lord came to me
[1:07:34] and I was getting ready to at that time
[1:07:35] when to come back home to go
[1:07:37] overseas and when I went over
[1:07:41] seas well I saw on the ship or side of a
[1:07:46] sea where the ships went
[1:07:48] out and there was a little short man
[1:07:51] there and he said I have prepared a boat
[1:07:54] for you brother Brandon and it was a
[1:07:57] little bitty canoe about about a foot
[1:08:00] long but it was Snow White and he said
[1:08:04] to me uh this is for you to cross in oh
[1:08:08] I said it it it isn't sufficient he said
[1:08:11] it'll go 40 m an hour up and down this
[1:08:14] way that's up and down the bank but I
[1:08:17] said it won't take me
[1:08:20] across and then he looked down and said
[1:08:22] go like they go and I looked and there
[1:08:24] was brother Fred sofman and brother
[1:08:26] Banks Woods sitting in a canoe painted
[1:08:29] green with some camping rigging in the
[1:08:32] back of it brother banks with a turned
[1:08:35] up hat like this brother Fred with his
[1:08:37] pinched on the bill and he said go like
[1:08:40] them I said no I want and this man said
[1:08:45] to them the little man said are you
[1:08:46] Boatman brother Bank said yes brother
[1:08:49] Fred said yes but I said they're
[1:08:52] not
[1:08:54] I am a votan and I know I wouldn't go
[1:08:57] just for that and I'm sure I wouldn't go
[1:08:58] that way said what you go with them I
[1:09:00] said no no well I turned and when I did
[1:09:06] the little man of the dock turned out to
[1:09:08] be my good brother brother
[1:09:11] arganbright and I went back in this
[1:09:14] vision and there was a little long
[1:09:17] building and then a voice said to me all
[1:09:21] of you remember this or many of you a
[1:09:23] voice said to me bring in food store it
[1:09:28] in that's the only way to keep them here
[1:09:31] is give them food and I brought in had
[1:09:34] brought in great big barrels full of the
[1:09:38] prettiest carrots and the prettiest
[1:09:41] vegetables and things I ever seen do you
[1:09:43] remember now the
[1:09:45] vision now and I told you later what the
[1:09:48] interpretation was I was supposed to go
[1:09:51] to Zer Switz one with brother Argan
[1:09:52] right for five nights meeting I told her
[1:09:55] Brethren before it happened I will not
[1:09:57] go and I was down with brother Welsh
[1:09:59] Evans down there when it uh give the
[1:10:02] interpretation one night I believe
[1:10:04] brother Wells come and got me was was
[1:10:06] going on the fishing trip and said
[1:10:07] brother Argan B was calling me I said
[1:10:10] all right here it is they're going to PP
[1:10:13] me
[1:10:15] off and many times not through brother
[1:10:18] minor he's one of the finest friends but
[1:10:22] sometimes if they can just if they think
[1:10:25] you're going to preach something it's
[1:10:26] against your Doctrine they just say
[1:10:29] you're going to be there to get your
[1:10:30] friends
[1:10:31] there and they said brother argam called
[1:10:33] me up and said brother brandom just what
[1:10:35] the spirit said said uh uh you come on
[1:10:38] bring your wife with you said because
[1:10:40] you won't have to preach very much said
[1:10:42] because I think he only got you for one
[1:10:44] night and said you might not have to
[1:10:46] preach that
[1:10:48] one and I said
[1:10:50] no well I said come on you and your wife
[1:10:53] you all come on see and if you do I'll
[1:10:56] take you on a tour all my wife and your
[1:10:59] wife and all of them we go up through
[1:11:00] Switzerland over through Palestine I
[1:11:02] said no I had the interpretation I told
[1:11:05] Brother Welsh or brother Fred now I'll
[1:11:07] tell you in the morning but first my
[1:11:09] wife has to say something and when I
[1:11:12] called her then she refused to go I said
[1:11:14] here it is now that little white boat
[1:11:17] was that one meeting it's all right to
[1:11:20] go anywhere here on the bank with one
[1:11:22] meeting but it's not enough though it
[1:11:24] was white and good to call me across
[1:11:26] Seas brother Fred and brother uh there
[1:11:29] represented in the vision they
[1:11:32] represented go as a
[1:11:35] tourist for fun but I did not care to do
[1:11:39] that and refusing them to be uh a
[1:11:43] Boatman it meant they wasn't preachers
[1:11:45] but I was a preacher and then the food
[1:11:49] in that little long building uh did not
[1:11:52] go overseas and returned to this little
[1:11:55] building and we made dozens of tapes of
[1:11:58] the pyramids and everything to show the
[1:12:02] people the hour that we're living
[1:12:05] in now compare even
[1:12:08] that with the others the dreams this was
[1:12:12] a
[1:12:14] vision the food here it
[1:12:17] is this is the
[1:12:20] place notice then what took
[1:12:24] place then immediately after that fourth
[1:12:27] Vision come on or fourth dream was told
[1:12:30] me up come a brother Parnell is's here
[1:12:34] somewhere right here and Billy wasn't
[1:12:37] here and the man was frantic he's from

[1:13:07] another there's a meeting here in a new
[1:13:09] church
[1:13:10] like and said this new church had come
[1:13:13] out that he wondered why there wasn't

[1:13:21] here thought well I have been here I'll
[1:13:24] just wait and I'll Stand the service
[1:13:26] instead a man come through the building
[1:13:28] with a brown suit on and a book I think
[1:13:30] he's writing and he told Brother Parnell
[1:13:33] said this is a Clos meeting it's only
[1:13:36] for deacons and
[1:13:37] trustees Well he kind of felt a little
[1:13:39] stepped on so he went out the door of
[1:13:42] the new church the church that had been
[1:13:44] erected or this one repaired fixed over
[1:13:48] and when he went outside it was snowing
[1:13:50] bad weather wintertime
[1:13:54] and none of these people know nothing
[1:13:56] about
[1:13:58] this and when he went out the door I was
[1:14:01] standing there looking
[1:14:04] Westward I said don't feel stepped on
[1:14:06] brother Parnell I'll direct you what you
[1:14:09] should
[1:14:10] do and brother Parnell and any of the
[1:14:13] rest of them know I never told them no
[1:14:15] interpretation it's right now yet seeing
[1:14:18] it when they was speaking did you notice
[1:14:20] how quick I got out there brother
[1:14:21] Parnell The keep from having to tell you
[1:14:24] and went on up never said nothing
[1:14:26] brother Woods or nobody else nobody just
[1:14:28] left it cuz I wanted to see what it was
[1:14:30] leading to have you heard me say lately
[1:14:32] I'm bothered that's what it was and then
[1:14:36] brother Parnell he said that I said to
[1:14:39] him brother Parnell start and the first
[1:14:43] place you'll come to will be
[1:14:45] Zapora Zapora sapora which means hyphen
[1:14:49] or stop or something I said don't stay
[1:14:52] there then go next and you'll find an
[1:14:55] old
[1:14:57] woman and then don't stop there go again
[1:15:00] you'll find a real old woman don't stop
[1:15:03] there and all the time we were I was
[1:15:06] talking we were walking through the
[1:15:09] snow and I said go till you find my
[1:15:13] wife and when you find my wife stop
[1:15:18] there and said he looked and we was out
[1:15:20] of the snow on the desert
[1:15:24] and OD
[1:15:25] vanished and he looked back and he saw
[1:15:27] his wife pumping water from a well and
[1:15:30] some Minister pulling on her to pull her
[1:15:33] away from the pump she was watching him
[1:15:35] and he woke up here's the interpretation
[1:15:38] of your
[1:15:39] dream I could have told you that night
[1:15:43] but I just turned
[1:15:44] away in so much that Zapora and one old
[1:15:48] woman and another real real old woman
[1:15:50] that's
[1:15:52] churches
[1:15:54] see and Zapora being actually the the
[1:15:59] wife of Moses Zapora and we notice that
[1:16:03] I told him not to stop at them no matter
[1:16:05] how old he was they were
[1:16:09] organizations don't stop at them they've
[1:16:13] lived their
[1:16:14] time but when he comes to my wife which
[1:16:18] is my church that Jesus Christ has sent
[1:16:22] me to in this last day and here it is
[1:16:26] hallelujah stop
[1:16:29] there Hallelujah and I was gone
[1:16:33] Westward then sister Stephie uh she may

[1:16:40] hospital I don't know where is Sister

[1:16:48] to the hospital for surgery that God
[1:16:51] would help her and bless her and he
[1:16:52] certainly
[1:16:53] did and she said I had a strange dream

[1:17:00] I dreamed that I was out
[1:17:04] west and I that's the sixth one and she
[1:17:07] said I dreamed I was out
[1:17:09] west and it's rolling country and when I
[1:17:13] looked standing up on a hill there was a
[1:17:16] real old man with long white beards and

[1:17:24] his face and he had a white uh wrap
[1:17:27] around something garment said the wind

[1:17:30] sister Stephie like that and said I kept
[1:17:34] drawing closer he was standing up on top
[1:17:36] of a mountain watching
[1:17:40] Eastward and said I wondered who is this
[1:17:43] old man and she moved
[1:17:47] closer closer and when she got closer
[1:17:51] she recognized who it was was it was the
[1:17:54] immortal

[1:17:59] watching the East she said I must see
[1:18:02] him she had a
[1:18:04] need and she ran up the hill and fell
[1:18:08] down there to speak to him and the name
[1:18:11] of Elijah and said when she spoke she
[1:18:14] heard a voice said what do you want

[1:21:30] only one thing I know is follow what he
[1:21:33] says
[1:21:36] do I don't know which way to turn what
[1:21:40] to do it's none of my I guess Abraham
[1:21:42] felt that way when he told him go over
[1:21:44] across the river he didn't know what to
[1:21:45] do but
[1:21:48] souljour separating self I didn't know
[1:21:51] what to do last Saturday morning one
[1:21:55] week from yesterday along about 3:00 in
[1:21:59] the morning i' gotten up got a drink of
[1:22:01] water and put the cover over Joseph in
[1:22:03] his room and then I come back and we
[1:22:07] just laid down I went to sleep and when
[1:22:10] I went to sleep I'm getting these little
[1:22:12] dreams and things off so you'll see the
[1:22:14] background of what I'm fixing to say I I
[1:22:17] covered up Joseph and I went back and
[1:22:20] laid down and went to sleep and I
[1:22:22] dreamed a dream and I dreamed that I saw
[1:22:25] a man that was supposed to be my father
[1:22:28] though he was a great big
[1:22:29] man and I saw a woman that was supposed
[1:22:32] to be my mother only she didn't look
[1:22:34] like my
[1:22:35] mother and this man was very mean to his
[1:22:39] wife and he had a three cornered stick
[1:22:42] where he clave this wood and it made a
[1:22:45] you know a chop of wood across a log you
[1:22:47] know it makes a three cornered stick and
[1:22:49] every time this woman would start to
[1:22:50] stand up he' just grab her by the neck
[1:22:52] and hit her on the head and knock her
[1:22:55] out and then she' lay there and snub and
[1:22:58] cry and then she' start coming back up
[1:23:01] again he'd walk around proud with his
[1:23:03] chest stuck out great big
[1:23:05] fella and once you'd raise up again he'd
[1:23:08] take her by the neck and take his three
[1:23:10] Corner stick and crack her on the head
[1:23:12] with it drop her down walk back and
[1:23:15] stick out his chest like he done
[1:23:16] something
[1:23:17] big and I was standing off watching it I
[1:23:21] thought I can't tackle that man he's too
[1:23:25] big and then he's supposed to be my
[1:23:28] papa but he ain't my papa and I said he
[1:23:32] ain't got no business treating that
[1:23:33] woman like that and I got kind of a
[1:23:37] little bit upset with him so then all at
[1:23:40] once I got up enough courage and I went
[1:23:43] over to him and grabbed him by the
[1:23:44] collar and turned him
[1:23:46] around and I said you have no right to
[1:23:50] strike her and when I said at that
[1:23:53] muscles grow I look like a
[1:23:56] giant and the man looked at those
[1:23:58] muscles and then he got scared of
[1:24:00] me and I said you strike her again
[1:24:03] you're going to deal with me and he kind
[1:24:06] of hesitated the stri her
[1:24:10] again and then I woke up I laid there a
[1:24:13] little while I thought what is that
[1:24:15] strange I dream about that woman and
[1:24:18] just in a moment here he come I got the
[1:24:21] interpretation the woman represents the
[1:24:24] Church of the world today all the world
[1:24:28] I was born right in this mess and here I
[1:24:31] am she's supposed to be kind of a a
[1:24:35] mother of if she was a mother of Harlot
[1:24:39] but yet I was born right into it and the
[1:24:43] her husband is the denominations that
[1:24:47] ruler the three cornered stick that she
[1:24:50] had is that Triune Baptist ISM in false
[1:24:53] names that every time she starts to rise
[1:24:56] up the congregation you accept it he
[1:24:58] whacks her down with
[1:24:59] it and of course him being so big I
[1:25:03] turned around was a little afraid of him
[1:25:05] and then I dashed into him anyhow and
[1:25:07] the muscles was Faith muscles that made
[1:25:10] me think if God's with me can give me
[1:25:13] muscles let me stand up for her which
[1:25:16] striking
[1:25:18] her must have been 10:00 in the day when
[1:25:22] my wife was trying to get into the
[1:25:24] room and it
[1:25:26] happened I went into a
[1:25:29] vision that
[1:25:31] morning and I
[1:25:34] somehow now
[1:25:36] remember it was not a
[1:25:40] dream there's difference between dreams
[1:25:42] and Visions dreams is when you go to
[1:25:45] sleep Visions when you don't go to sleep
[1:25:48] we're born that way an ordinary human
[1:25:50] being when he dreams it's in his subcon
[1:25:52] conscience and his subconscious is way
[1:25:54] away from him his sens is as active as
[1:25:57] long as he's in his first conscience in
[1:26:00] this conscience you you're normal you
[1:26:02] see taste feel smell hear but when
[1:26:05] you're in your subconscious asleep you
[1:26:07] don't neither see taste feel smell or
[1:26:09] here but there's something when you
[1:26:11] dream that you return back to this
[1:26:13] conscience there's a memory that you
[1:26:15] remember something that you dreamed
[1:26:16] about years ago an ordinary human being
[1:26:19] is that way but when God predestinate at
[1:26:22] something this subconscious is not way
[1:26:25] away from here to the sear but both
[1:26:29] consciences right together and the sear
[1:26:32] in a vision doesn't go to sleep he's
[1:26:34] still in his senses and sees
[1:26:36] it I was explaining that for some
[1:26:38] doctors the other day they raised up and
[1:26:40] said marvelous never even thought of
[1:26:42] such a thing when I was taking a wave
[1:26:44] test they said I they've never seen
[1:26:45] anything like that see well said there's
[1:26:48] something happens to you and I said I
[1:26:51] told him he said that's it exactly see
[1:26:54] the two conscience sit right close
[1:26:55] together it's nothing I could do and it
[1:26:58] don't make me more than anybody else
[1:26:59] it's just God made it that
[1:27:02] way you don't go to sleep you're right
[1:27:04] here just like asleep you're standing
[1:27:06] here looking right like this and all of
[1:27:08] you seen it around the world you don't
[1:27:11] go to sleep standing on a platform
[1:27:12] talking to people you hear me go in
[1:27:14] divisions and come back when I'm riding
[1:27:16] in a car with you anywhere else and tell
[1:27:18] you things that's going to happen and
[1:27:19] never
[1:27:20] fails never has has anybody ever seen it
[1:27:24] fail it can't
[1:27:27] fail it won't fail as long as it's god
[1:27:30] notice right on the platform thousands
[1:27:33] before tens of thousands of people even
[1:27:36] in other languages that I can't even
[1:27:37] speak still it don't
[1:27:39] fail see it's
[1:27:42] God now in this Vision or as I was
[1:27:48] speaking I looked and I saw a strange
[1:27:53] thing now it seemed like that my little
[1:27:56] son Joseph was by my side I was talking
[1:28:00] to him now if you watch the vision real
[1:28:02] close you'll see why Joseph was standing
[1:28:05] there and I looked and there was a big
[1:28:09] bush and on this bush in a in a
[1:28:14] constellation of birds little bitty
[1:28:17] Birds about half inch long and a half
[1:28:20] inch high they were a little veterans
[1:28:22] the little feathers is beat
[1:28:25] down and there was a about two or three
[1:28:28] on the top limb uh six or eight on the
[1:28:31] next lmb and 15 or 20 on the next lmb
[1:28:34] coming down in the shape of a pyramid
[1:28:37] and those little fellows little
[1:28:39] Messengers and they were pretty well
[1:28:41] worn out and they were watching Eastward
[1:28:44] and I was at Tucson
[1:28:48] Arizona in division for it made it so
[1:28:51] perfect purpose that he didn't want me
[1:28:53] to fail to see where was at I was
[1:28:55] picking a sandur off of
[1:28:57] me from the
[1:29:00] desert and I said now I know this is a
[1:29:03] vision and I know that I'm a
[1:29:07] Tucson and I
