understand me after all these years amen you know this is about this is 30 years I've been behind this Pulpit here 30 years in this Tabernacle y'all be knowing me but this time shouldn't you oh my my education is sure limited but I I don't can't talk but I make a truthful noise to the Lord praise God and brother I believe was Dr lamza of the Lamy Bible at in the translation said one time I was speaking and I didn't know he was there and he come back and was talking about the year of mundum and then he was speaking of that light and he said what's the matter with these people today and how I said he said the reason that people the translators could not translate the Bible correctly that the translators tried to translate in a high Yiddish and Jesus speaking spoke in the common class just like the street people spoke you know there's a scripture over and Luke said the common people heard him gladly he spoke in their language I hope that's so again Lord we are happy for the Lord now I know I see them ladies standing around it's bad enough to see men standing let Al them girls and boys and ladies and so forth standing around the walls and little children but we just haven't got the adequate seat meeting room so we pray that that next time we have the meetings after this week after this time you know the next thing up as far as we know is those Seven Seals and the Lord willing we start on them just immediately as soon as the church is over uh built so we can get in here we're coming in for a rededication and maybe anywhere from 1 to two and maybe three week straight meeting now uh coming up for the uh the seals so we're expecting a great time in the Lord during that time and we'll all you out of town people we'll mail you the cards and everything and let you know just exactly the time maybe a week or two ahead of time the contractor As I understood Billy to say tonight would be done the 10th day of February well if he's done the 10th we'll start about the 15th then so just as soon as they're finished we'll start right in on that old sister kid called me a while ago and she was almost in tears she said brother Brandon we tried so hard to start that old car and it

the ministry you know what they do got a tape recorder and they take my messages and go from hospital to hospital from house to house uh playing the tapes now that isn't not giving up that's not retiring that's holding the faith to the end dying with a sword in the hand that's the way to go that's the way I want to do and then and she said you know if I get out on the highway at 12:00 she

you with a rifle to get up the hill where you went to preach oh my then I think must I be carried home to heaven on a fly bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody sea I must fight if I must reain increase my courage Lord and I want his support by his word that's what I want to amen now I suppose the recorders are going now oh yes I got I'm sorry little sister had a baby here this morning she wanted dedicated and I told her which sure do it tonight and now and tomorrow night we'll have dedication of babies healing Services everything that we possibly can go through with we have plenty of time so if the little sister's here has her little one and I was supposed to have a some people come from way away and was here this morning for a private interview and

quite a little time waiting and seeing if he could find the lady that was two of them I think that was on private interview from way out of the country so we um we trust if I miss you I'll be able to

excuse me amen well like that little rib what's his name Rebecca ly [Music] and St Rea ly St is that [Music] right back up this family has come through much this uh young lady here her husband uh just recently has both been saved and brought into the knowledge of the Lord and now in their Union God has given this beautiful little Rea and they bring it to the LA now many people they call infinite infant baptism in the Methodist Church and many of the others and they sprink them with water when they're babies now that's all right so far as I concerned but we always try to State just what the Bible says here in the Bible there no never was such a thing as baptizing and in nowh done in history to the early Catholic Church for we know of which was all so that's just the way of saying inter but in the Bible they brought little children to Jesus that he might bless them and he put his hands up on him and bless him and that we still continue that now let us th our head our heavenly father this young woman and young man come tonight with this lovely little Rebecca that has been given to them and their charge to raise in the amination of God and they bring it tonight for presentation to the Lord and when the mother gave from her AR arms to mine then I give from my arms to you this little Rebecca God be with her and bless her bless her father and mother may they all live loyal long lives and if it be possible to see the coming of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah may this child grow in the knowledge of the Lord and may if there is a tomorrow may she be a great witness to you yes granted Lord now if you were here on Earth these women and men would bring their children to you but we the Ministers of the Gospel are your representative so we give you this baby for a life of service in your kingdom in the name of your son the Lord Lord Jesus Christ amen bless you may God bless you both and the give long happy lives Serv of God I don't know whether I'm quite strong enough or [Music] not all name Dan Stanley Victor clay Cleveland Cleveland little stand what a nice little name and what a nice little boy well I [Music] gu we don't practice this we just do this nothing far about it this is sure a sweet uh I forgot the last name I don't even pronounce Cleveland now Heavenly Father this couple PRS this baby little Stanley Cleveland to be dedicated to the Lord Jesus yes and as the pastor here of the church and I stand together and unity in the works of the lord we give to you this child for a life of service you give him to the mother and father and now they give him to me to my arms and I place him from my arms to your God bless his father and mother bless the little boy may they all live long happy lives service for you may the child be raised in the Adon of God to Ser him and hearing and Lov him all the days of his life now they brought children to you that you might bless them and we with our hands upon the child bless him in the name of the Lord and may he live a long happy life but health and strength to your service in Jesus name amen [Music] [Music] now I'm going to ask just a little favor for of the Little Folks and all the teenage and I know it's hard you can't stand still very long because your limbs cramp but I'm approaching something tonight that I never did before and there's something that I am going to speak on that I have never thought of speaking on such a thing that's the reason this morning I did not want to place that time before the message and I never got through talking about my absolute and I don't think I ever will I hope I never do he's so wonderful but tonight I'm going to speak on something that I do not know and now that's quite a thing for a minister to say that he's going to speak on something that he doesn't know about but I am adventur ing out to the best of my knowledge to that this church might understand and I would not by no means hold anything back from you that's profitable and then this tape I suppose the boys are making the tape and if you happen to get the tape whoever is listening to the tape remember if something is puzzling to you don't say it l it's on the tape don't say something contrary to what's on the tape so many ride in on the Serpent's Seed and say that I said such and such uh go get the tape play it over I did not say it that way see uh people misjudge things that's right you know Jesus one time after his resurrection was walking down the shore with the apostles and John was leaning on his bosom and they said what will happen to this man Jesus said what is it to thee if he terries till I come and there went out of saying that John was going to live to see Jesus come and the scripture says how be it he never said it that way see he he never said that he just said what is it to you if he terries I come he never said he would T but see misunderstanding is so easy and now it's it's not that I'm condemning someone for doing it because I do it myself and all people does it if the apostles who walk with our Lord misunderstood him and they never did clearly understand him right it last they said Lord now we understand now now we believe and we are sure that no man to tell you anything for thou knowest all things and Jesus said do you now believe see after all that time do you f did it finally get to you see that you believe and that's just human and we're all human so we're going to misunderstand but if it's kind of a little puzzling to you play the tape back yes listen closely say I'm sure the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you then the little fellas if you just hold your amens the children just wait just a little while because I I want this to be surely gotten because many will not have the tape so I want you to be sure to get it and let's approach it for I say 35 minutes or 40 just as reverently As We Know know how to do it because this is a tremendous time for me it's where something has happened that I don't know what to do and I'm standing in the most terrific straight I ever stood in in the days of my ministry as I know of so let's bow our heads now before we approach the word Heavenly Father then some time ago I preached upon the subject of presuming and presuming is to Adventure without Authority and maybe tonight Lord I have took upon myself to interpret something to the people without having a vision of it therefore Lord check me where the points is to be checked close close my mouth Lord you did close a lion's mouth in the den with Daniel that it did not hurt him and Lord I pray that if I should try to interpret something wrong you still have power to close a mouth but if it is the truth then Lord bless it and send it forth and you know the conditions and what's right at hand and that's why I come even to this very last moment at the pull pit to try to interpret these things now I pray thee to help us bless this little church this group that comes here under the roof that sojourns with us here in the city coming out of many states oh when the evening Shadows are falling we're so so glad to have a place to come when the world is so confused and do not know where they're standing we're glad that the name of the Lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe just not so many words but a revelation so we pray father as the evening lights would come at the setting of the Sun and we believe that that's the time that we're living in the setting of the Sun and we most solemnly thank thee Lord from all of our hearts for the things that you have done for us Lord down to the age I thank you for letting the visions that you have given every one of them just perfectly and every interpretation of dream has been exactly that way so we know it could only be you Lord for we are marals all born in sin and there's not a sound thing in us but to think that you could take such a thing as a human being and wash him by the water of the word and by the blood of Christ and stretch forth that hand in such a way to the person doesn't use her own thinking but let in the mind of Christ who knows all things let it come in and speak and use a tabernacle thank you Father now we bless thy holy name and we bless this little group tonight in thy name we bless the pastor brother Neville God's G ENT servant we bless the deacons the trustees and every member of the body of Christ both here and around the world in the name of the Lord Jesus oh as we see this dark dingy horrible Shadow falling across the face of Christianity we know the time is Drawing Near there will be a Rapture and the church will be taken up amen Lord let us march on looking to the author and finisher Christ granted Lord and as we move forward now in the name of the Lord Jesus to undertake these things that's been put up on our hearts we pray that you will be with us and help us and get Glory out of it Lord or we commit ourselves to you with your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen now if you got a pencil and paper uh I would like for you to write some things down as or anything that you wish to just have it ready and then on the tape all so if you wish to jot the scriptures down at any time because I believe it's the scripture that counts now we want to read a text tonight or read a scripture reading out of the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ and I believe that this is the revelation of Jesus Christ as written in the book and any other revelation that would be contrary to this Revelation would be wrong amen I believe that would bear quot quoting quoting again any Revelation that will not fit in with this Revelation and bring this Revelation to light is a wrong Revelation amen it must be scripture now in the 10th chapter of the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ I wish to read the first few verses the first seven verses 1 to 7 listen close now and pray for me and I saw another Mighty another Mighty Angel come down from Heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven Thunders ear their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heavens and the thing that in them are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which there in that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and my text if I should call it that tonight is this is this the sign of the end sir we all know that we're living in a a glorious time for the church but a horrible time time for the unbeliever and we're living in one of the most dangerous times of all all that ever was since the world began no Prophet no Apostle never in no time ever lived in such a time as we live now amen This is the End Amen it's written in the skies it's written over the face of the Earth it's written in every newspaper this is the end am if you can read the handwriting the prophets lived in the time when the handwriting was on the wall for a nation but we're living when the handwriting is on the wall for time all nations Earth everything time is at the end so we must search the scriptures to find the hour that we are living always a true prophet of God will go to the scriptures therefore he's absolute that it's going to be that way in the Old Testament when prophets said anything there always somewhere was a prophet with the word who stayed with the word he watched God for visions and if his vision was contrary to the word then his vision was wrong that's God's way of getting his word to his people can you hear me way back all [Music] right I just hardly know where to start now it has been a great privilege to me to know that this Tabernacle was my first church it's a glorious thing I shall never for forget though I jesus Terry and I would live to be hundreds of years old I remember the day I laid the Cornerstone there at the corner and the vision he gave me that morning of this Tabernacle and all of you remembered it's wrote in the books and it's absolutely been fulfilled to the letter not one bit of it missed and now I do not believe that there's anything that he has spoken all these years of my life that I have spoke to the people but what come to pass and many people has come with dreams that he's Let Me by his grace interpret for the people and many has come with dreams and with problems that I was unable to interpret but I haven't tried to introduce to you people a gimmick that has all the answers I've tried to be honest and to tell you what was truth and I could only tell you as he told Meen and then as it come to me then I could tell you and I want to warn you in this day that we're living in there's many not not seeing anything against people but when you see a person that's got the answer to everything that's contrary to the word amen Jesus said there was many lepers in the Days of Elijah but only one was healed in the many years the 80 or more that Elijah lived and one leper was healed many witow in the days of Elisha but he is only sent to one and we find out that there's many things that God does and that he doesn't reveal to his servants and no servant is greater than his Lord amen and then God will not share his glory with nobody he's God and when a servant becomes a place that he tries to take the place of God then God takes his life and moves him away somewhere or something we must remember that now in those visions and interpretations I cannot tell the interpretation of a dream until I see exactly by Vision what the dream was and many of you know that you've told me your dream and would not even tell it all and when I saw the dream come back to me I turned around and told you that there much of it you left out and tell you what you left out of it you know that's right if that's right say Amen you amen amen the things that you didn't tell me therefore you see if the like Nebuchadnezzar said if you can't tell me what I dreamed then how would I know you got the interpretation of it but all these Impressions we mustn't take them and say thus sayeth the Lord we mustn't do that we must have a direct voice and answer from God before before we can say it's God not an impression not a sensation no matter how much is pul say you might say I believe it could be this way but when you speak thus sayeth the Lord it's not you watch on the platform have you ever seen it fail thus sayith the Lord is perfect never has failed and as long as it is thus sayeth the Lord it can't fail but so far he's protected me because I've waited on him I haven't tried to seek popularity or being Glory of man I've tried my best to live humble and live the kind of a life that I think a Christian should live and I haven't been able to do that within myself but he has done it until this day I say that he is the one that's led me many things could be said this way but it take too long but all of you are aware of these things and the only reason I had you to say Amen a while ago you people that's told me dreams then i' come tell you uh what you left out because this message being taped man of all Nations will hear this and when they hear that amen then they know these voices there that's set under this ministry that knows better than to do anything wrong amen or to say Amen to something that's wrong amen is so big it's sanctioning now all my life since I've been a little boy there's been something that's bothered me and I've had a very odd life hard to understand even my wife scratches her head and say Bill I don't think anybody can understand you and I said I don't understand myself because I submit commit myself to Christ many years ago he does the leading I don't try to understand it I just go where he leads the best of my knowledge I'm thankful for a wonderful wife and children and for my wife and children who has confidence that I would not tell them anything wrong that they believe every time you tell them anything they hold right with it they know it I wouldn't tell them anything wrong and would I tell one of God's children anything wrong then not wey no sir God wants his children in the right kind of training and be honest with them and truthful with them and he'll bless it I believe now all along down through the Journey there's been things that's happened that I couldn't understand and one of the things that I could not understand was when it was a little boy and then Visions would come up on me and I'd see him and tell my parents the things that was going to happen they thought I was just nervous but the strange thing it happened just the way it said so you say was that before your conversion yes gifts and callings are without repentance the Bible said you're born in this world for some purpose and you don't your repentance don't bring gifts they are predestinated to you now along the road and when I was a little boy my my longing was I was dissatisfied in the country I lived in a long somehow to go west and I was operated on when I was shop when I was a little boy and when I come from under the first anesthetic I thought I was in torment Going Down The Ether had me out and I've been gone out for 8 hours I think they was worrying about getting me around to myself again they had a great operation with no penicillin blood both legs almost shot off of the shotgun a little boy friend let his gun go off and then about seven months later I took another anesthetic and when I come from under that anesthetic I thought I was standing out on the western prairies and a great Golden Cross in the sky and the glory of God shining down off of it me standing there like this when the light what you see on the picture tonight that's been proven to be a supernatural being by scientific research to me it was the same light that struck down St Paul is the same light that led the children of Israel By Night am did you notice of this Angel he was clothed in a cloud it was a cloud by day now that same light as to people not understanding first thought that it was wrong that I was just saying that but the Holy Spirit had to hide the scientific instruments and the people there for a Vindication and took the picture of it several times I said I see a person shattered to death black shadow over him a few weeks ago when I was in a city and when we're preaching you you're not supposed to take pictures you know while you're preaching and when same thing was when that was talk but someone had a camera and I said to a lady sitting out there stranger I was in in Southern Pines I said there is a shatter over this Miss so and so a lady that I've never seen in my life you just come from the doctor in two cancers one on each breast and you're given up you are shattered with a black hood to death and something said to a sister sitting by who had a flash camera said take the picture and she didn't want to do it yet take the picture and she still refrained and then again it come and she grabbed the picture and shot the picture and there it is scientifically it's on the bulletin board black hooded Shadow then then when the woman believed and prayer was made a picture shot right straight back behind it clear I said the shadow has gone the lady lives by the grace of God do you see what I mean if you'll tell the truth you may be laughed at for a while you may be misunderstood for a while but God will vindicate that that it is the truth if you just stay with it amen just hold on might take years but like in Abraham and others but he'll always make it to truth when that angel there and I suppose besides my wife there's people here tonight from 30 years ago that was standing close when that come down is there anybody in the audience now that was there when the angel of the Lord that come down on the river the first time before people raise up your hand yes there they are now I see Miss Wilson rais up her hand she was standing there and my wife there she was there and I don't know who some the rest of them is I was standing on the bank here before many many people when I was baptizing at 2:00 in the afternoon and right out of the brassy Skies where they had been rain for weeks here he come with a roar instead of John the Baptist was sent forth the for forun the first coming of Christ you're sent forth with a message to forun the second coming Hallelujah many man from business man the city was standing on the bank asked me what it meant I said that wasn't for me it's for you I believe on it went and when that angel left if you remember he went Westward as he went up right out up over the top of the bridge and went Westward later on I met an astronomer which is a magon and they told me of a constellation of stars that had come together and a certain constellation when the wise men in Babylon saw down towards Palestine this three stars in A constellation you've heard me tell it many times do you know that's proven these last couple of weeks to be the truth amen brother Stopman you have that paper with you tonight everywhere you are um it's in uh the paper a sheet of a Sunday paper December the 9th that a reporter went over there and they've dug up all these things that we are actually living now proven that we're this year coming up is 1900 70 7 years out of date by dug up rocks and proed that it's wrong it's later than you think amen I didn't see brother Fred somehow brother Stopman are you here do you have the paper with you brother sopan you he has the paper maybe tomorrow night I'll have you read it we haven't got time tonight so you can see and what's exactly those Magis Jewish Magis up in Babylon studying the Stars saw those stars fall into their constellation and when he did they knew that Messiah was on Earth and here they come into Jerusalem singing two years Journey where is he that's born King of the Jews up and down the streets they went and why is Israel laughed at him these bunch of Fanatics they never know nothing about it but the Messiah was on Earth and now you know the rest of the story what they said now we'll read that tomorrow night now coming to this that the Visions don't fail because they're from God and all along the journey it's been something pulling me tugging at me then when that maah told me these things when I was just the boy game w or before that I believe it was about these things and it scared me because I was afraid of of what the Magi was but later on I found out that the Magi of the Bible was right because God declares in heaven before he declares it on Earth Watching those heavenly bodies God's no respected person of all Nations said Peter now but those who fear in all nations God accepts and we find then I tried to give the thought up but oh it take hours to go in how the constate move that way move that way but I was scared of it this may joh said to me you'll never be successful in the East said you were born under a sign and said you that sign that constellation when they crossed way out in there the day of your birth they were hanging Westward and you must go Westward I said forget it I I had nothing to do with it and all along oh still that didn't take it out of my heart then when I was up there that night about these Visions I couldn't understand my Baptist Brethren told me that was of the devil and then when that angel appeared he absolutely thr it into the scripture and said as it was then when the priests were arguing about about things not knowing nothing about what kind of coats they she wearing clothes and everything and arguing about their differences the Ma J was following the star to Christ amen when the preachers said that Jesus was an impostor of bbub a devil raised up and said we know who you are the Holy One Of God why are you coming to tment us before the time when Paul and Silas came down pre the gospel of little fortune teller sitting on the street and the preachers of that country said these men are imposters they tear up our churches and so forth turning the world upside down with their corruption but what happened that little Mai that little fortune teller said these are man of God to tell us a way of life and Paul rebuked that spirit in her you didn't need any help to testify who he was Jesus always told him to hold their peace but it goes to show that sometimes Devils knows more about the things of God than preachers does they become so ecclesiastical bound that was so in the Bible and God doesn't change one day coming down five years ago from Brother Normans I was driving down the road and I just had a meeting up there and the Lord God appeared to me in a vision and I was sitting in front of my gate up here at my house and it seemed to be bad weather many of you people will remember the vision it's wrote in my book of Visions I put them down so I be sure that I don't forget them and in this Vision I saw there was something that had come through the lane and there was stones laying all over my yard and there was graters and scrapers up and down the lane and trees that been cut down and rooted up and I started to turn into the gate and it was all blocked off with stones and I got out to say to the man why this and he got very hostile shoved me backwards and said that's the way with you preachers I said I only ask you why do you do this you you're coming over on my side of the street you're why did you do this and he just almost slapped me and shoved me back and I thought I'm just going to tell him that he doesn't know what he's talking about and a voice spoke said don't do that you are a minister and I said very well and I turned around and to my right sitting in front of the gate was an old Prairie Schooner you know what a cover wagon with horses hitch to it and sitting opposite the driver's side was my wife I looked back in the back and my children was sitting back there I climbed up on the wagon I said to my wife honey I've stood all I can stand and I picked up the lines and pulled the lead hor and started heading Westward and a voice said to me when this comes to pass then go Westward brother Woods the contractor here at our church and Trust team how many remembers the vision now remember me telling you sure it's row down on paper and I said to brother Woods he bought from the church this lot in between there and he was going to build a stone house I said don't do it brother Woods call they would never give you your money out of it perhaps maybe that's years ago five years ago I said they're going to maybe bring that bridge through here and then stones are probably my basement bursted up and my walks and things laying out here instead of being Stones it hunks of concrete and then they'll go to put that down here because they said in the paper that's what they were trying to do well he did not build it finally they decided about a year later or two that's going to bring it through down this way so that settled it so I just forgot it and let it go now the strange thing happened about a year ago I was having Services one night down at brother Junior Jackson sitting right here a Methodist Minister that's received the Holy Ghost and been baptized into the name of Jesus Christ it's pastoring one of our sisters churches just to show you how God deals with this people I say this with all my heart I don't know of any congregation in the entire world a congregation together anymore where I believe the spirit of God is and in this congregation they got their differences they're sure not up to where they should be none of us but they're as close as anybody else that I know of I'll show you knowing what was going to happen brother Jackson Dreamed a Dream he couldn't get away from it and I was leaving his church and he just couldn't stand it how long ago has it been B Jackson I had the dream in February of 16 February of 61 he had the dream and he come to me and he said something is on my heart I must tell you brother Brandon I said go on brother Jackson and he said I dreamed a dream and there it was I just sat still and I listen and watched he said I dreamed that there was a great big hill like out in a field where Bluegrass or something was and said up on top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there was a top rock up on top of the hill like uh the top of the mountain it was Rock no grass and where the water had washed down it had cut some kind of readings on these stones and you were standing there interpreting this reading on these stones and said all of us and here's the way he put it said the brother from Georgia and from all around we were all standing together listening to you interpret that mysterious riding on those stone that mountain and said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or crowbar wasn't it brother something like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said how you've done it I don't know and said you struck the top of that mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap of it off is in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached and said beneath that was White Stone Granite and you said the Sun or the light has never sh shed on this before looking on this watch this and that's right because in the formation of the world the world was formed before there was light we all know that God moved up on the water and and then in the beginning he spoke for light and naturally if down under there in the age that formation was that light had never come upon that stone and he said look upon this light has never come upon it before and when all of them got up and I told him to watch that and all of them come up to look in but he said while they were looking in he looked out of the corner of his eye I believe it was and watch me I slipped off to one side and started going towards the West towards the setting of the sun coming up a hill going down a hill coming up a hill going down a hill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight and he said then when I did that he said then the Brethren turned around at you while and said did he vanish where did he go and said some tuck out that way some tuck one way and some another but a very few stayed and looked on to what I had told them now notice the interpretation of the dream which I never told him one thing or none of these did I tell any of them but I said yes and my heart shaking I was watching now the mysterious writing wait I'll just leave it for a little bit not long ago brother Beer Brother beer is usually with us are you here brother beer uh yes back here Billy said brother Beer's all tore up he had a strange dream I went to Brother beer and he said down to this house one night when I was going on some C and he said brother brandham I had a strange dream said I dreamed that I was going down a stream of water towards the west and there was a road on the left side and I was on the left side going Westward on the road seeming like hunting for cattle and on the right side I happened to notice after I got down there there you were and you were rounding up a big bunch of cattle and there was plenty of feet over there and said then you got those cattle and starred them back up the river and seemingly that must have nodded to him to watch those cattle and he said now it'll be easy for those cattle I know they'll go the way of least resistance but brother Brandon wants them to stay on the right side of that River so I'll go back up this road and keep them from coming across the river on this side and keep them on that side but he noticed I never followed the cattle but went on Westward he said he must be hunting Strays no more than he spoke the dream I saw it and then notice he said he got a little leery about me so he went back to look and said I was coming to a solid mountain and all at once that b Fin and he wondered what was wrong he went down and then he had a little stream on his side that forked off to the left I think that's right brother beer yeah and you noticed from and over on my side was a terrific Falls and then he thought I'm could have gotten those Falls and uh and uh perished then he noticed and he said he looked around he seen the effects of those Falls had went down this way and was causing RT well to spurt up but the water wasn't going back in the ground he looked across the little Branch a little stream and he seen some little animals with round ears he said I believe I'll take one and he crossed then he got thinking about me and he got up on a little nle to look over and see if there was a little bitty narrow ledge you know that I could have walked around but said there was nothing and he got weed he said what happened to our bre wonder what happened to brother brandham and when he got scared he said he heard me speak I stand up on top of a mountain I told Brother beer an interpretation of a dream that I give him not long ago and told him to wait on the Lord that someday i' meet him on an island and there he was now the interpretation of that dream is this in so much that the stream was large it was a stream of life I was going Westward on it and so is he because he was on a road he was running small down this road and on the other side was lots of grass but lots of thickets and BRS and jungle but in there was much grass and that's the way we hunt for the Lord in the food of the Lord too difficult rounding up the cattle was this church keeping them on that side cattle will actually go on the smooth Road the denomination if they can which the road represented denomination I started him back up the road to see that they did not go to any denomination in so much that he saw a wall that was totally impossible to pass that kept me from going west was that tax case with the government nobody can understand how I ever got out of it it was a wall that blocked me off but the Lord taken me through it and I was over I'll meet you brother beer on the island so now then immediately after that brother Roy Roberson brother Roy are you here tonight yes I believe what or the side he called me and he had a dream and he dreamed that we were rounding cattle now that is the third one rounding up cattle and it was grass belly de plenty of food all of us Brethren were together and we come to a place for dinner and brother Fred sofman raised up and said Elijah the great prophet will speak from here today at noon and then when we all had dinner everybody went away and he wondered why they didn't wait to hear it being spoke now see how that exactly curbs with brother Jackson see that exactly hits exactly what brother beer said no one waited to find out notice immediately after that sister Collins are you here sister Collins dreamed the dream of being here at the church and there was a wedding fixing to take place and when she did she saw the bridegroom come in perfect but the bride wasn't very perfect yet it was a bride now that's the church and there was like a communion or a a service going on you're like a dinner being set and it kind of got next year because that brother nville was serving a dinner in the church but she said it was the best food that she hadd ever seen she was so hungry but she thought maybe that in the dream that he shouldn't serve it and um she and brother Willard was going to go up to the ranch house and eat and when they did the light on the right hand side went out now you know what that is now the food the bride isn't perfect but the bridegroom is perfect the bride is not perfect yet but the food that was being given was not literal food it's the spiritual food that you've been having all along let me stop here on that fourth dream just a moment do you not remember brother Fred sofman brother Banks Woods when we was out in Arizona last year when we were out hunting havina hogs and the Lord spoke don't you know the things he done perfectly showing what would come to pass as we went along the road if that's right YouTu brother say Amen never misses and I saw in a vision while we were driving one day um a vision of the Lord came to me and I was getting ready to at that time when to come back home to go overseas and when I went over seas well I saw on the ship or side of a sea where the ships went out and there was a little short man there and he said I have prepared a boat for you brother Brandon and it was a little bitty canoe about about a foot long but it was Snow White and he said to me uh this is for you to cross in oh I said it it it isn't sufficient he said it'll go 40 m an hour up and down this way that's up and down the bank but I said it won't take me across and then he looked down and said go like they go and I looked and there was brother Fred sofman and brother Banks Woods sitting in a canoe painted green with some camping rigging in the back of it brother banks with a turned up hat like this brother Fred with his pinched on the bill and he said go like them I said no I want and this man said to them the little man said are you Boatman brother Bank said yes brother Fred said yes but I said they're not I am a votan and I know I wouldn't go just for that and I'm sure I wouldn't go that way said what you go with them I said no no well I turned and when I did the little man of the dock turned out to be my good brother brother arganbright and I went back in this vision and there was a little long building and then a voice said to me all of you remember this or many of you a voice said to me bring in food store it in that's the only way to keep them here is give them food and I brought in had brought in great big barrels full of the prettiest carrots and the prettiest vegetables and things I ever seen do you remember now the vision now and I told you later what the interpretation was I was supposed to go to Zer Switz one with brother Argan right for five nights meeting I told her Brethren before it happened I will not go and I was down with brother Welsh Evans down there when it uh give the interpretation one night I believe brother Wells come and got me was was going on the fishing trip and said brother Argan B was calling me I said all right here it is they're going to PP me off and many times not through brother minor he's one of the finest friends but sometimes if they can just if they think you're going to preach something it's against your Doctrine they just say you're going to be there to get your friends there and they said brother argam called me up and said brother brandom just what the spirit said said uh uh you come on bring your wife with you said because you won't have to preach very much said because I think he only got you for one night and said you might not have to preach that one and I said no well I said come on you and your wife you all come on see and if you do I'll take you on a tour all my wife and your wife and all of them we go up through Switzerland over through Palestine I said no I had the interpretation I told Brother Welsh or brother Fred now I'll tell you in the morning but first my wife has to say something and when I called her then she refused to go I said here it is now that little white boat was that one meeting it's all right to go anywhere here on the bank with one meeting but it's not enough though it was white and good to call me across Seas brother Fred and brother uh there represented in the vision they represented go as a tourist for fun but I did not care to do that and refusing them to be uh a Boatman it meant they wasn't preachers but I was a preacher and then the food in that little long building uh did not go overseas and returned to this little building and we made dozens of tapes of the pyramids and everything to show the people the hour that we're living in now compare even that with the others the dreams this was a vision the food here it is this is the place notice then what took place then immediately after that fourth Vision come on or fourth dream was told me up come a brother Parnell is's here somewhere right here and Billy wasn't here and the man was frantic he's from Bloomington I believe or what Bedford Lafayette Lafayette holding meetings and he had a dream and he come down to brother woods and he said I just can't let this go I've got to tell it got to tell brother brandom is bothering me and God knows not one dream in between them just come one 2 3 4 five six brother parnel said I had a strange dream I dreamed that I was going to have a meeting up there and somehow or another there's a meeting here in a new church like and said this new church had come out that he wondered why there wasn't cooperating between the two or something on that way and said he uh was standing here thought well I have been here I'll just wait and I'll Stand the service instead a man come through the building with a brown suit on and a book I think he's writing and he told Brother Parnell said this is a Clos meeting it's only for deacons and trustees Well he kind of felt a little stepped on so he went out the door of the new church the church that had been erected or this one repaired fixed over and when he went outside it was snowing bad weather wintertime and none of these people know nothing about this and when he went out the door I was standing there looking Westward I said don't feel stepped on brother Parnell I'll direct you what you should do and brother Parnell and any of the rest of them know I never told them no interpretation it's right now yet seeing it when they was speaking did you notice how quick I got out there brother Parnell The keep from having to tell you and went on up never said nothing brother Woods or nobody else nobody just left it cuz I wanted to see what it was leading to have you heard me say lately I'm bothered that's what it was and then brother Parnell he said that I said to him brother Parnell start and the first place you'll come to will be Zapora Zapora sapora which means hyphen or stop or something I said don't stay there then go next and you'll find an old woman and then don't stop there go again you'll find a real old woman don't stop there and all the time we were I was talking we were walking through the snow and I said go till you find my wife and when you find my wife stop there and said he looked and we was out of the snow on the desert and OD vanished and he looked back and he saw his wife pumping water from a well and some Minister pulling on her to pull her away from the pump she was watching him and he woke up here's the interpretation of your dream I could have told you that night but I just turned away in so much that Zapora and one old woman and another real real old woman that's churches see and Zapora being actually the the wife of Moses Zapora and we notice that I told him not to stop at them no matter how old he was they were organizations don't stop at them they've lived their time but when he comes to my wife which is my church that Jesus Christ has sent me to in this last day and here it is hallelujah stop there Hallelujah and I was gone Westward then sister Stephie uh she may not be here because she's been in the hospital I don't know where is Sister Ste yes here she is Sister Stephie comes to my house for prayer before she went to the hospital for surgery that God would help her and bless her and he certainly did and she said I had a strange dream brother Brandon I said yes and she said I dreamed that I was out west and I that's the sixth one and she said I dreamed I was out west and it's rolling country and when I looked standing up on a hill there was a real old man with long white beards and what hair he had was grow down across his face and he had a white uh wrap around something garment said the wind was blowing it I think that's right sister Stephie like that and said I kept drawing closer he was standing up on top of a mountain watching Eastward and said I wondered who is this old man and she moved closer closer and when she got closer she recognized who it was was it was the immortal Elijah the prophet standing up there watching the East she said I must see him she had a need and she ran up the hill and fell down there to speak to him and the name of Elijah and said when she spoke she heard a voice said what do you want sister Stephie and it was me Hallelujah your dream was fulfilled right there sister Stephie for immediately after that I went to Louisville what she was needing was a prayer see she got through all right the hospital and the sign of me going Westward watching Eastward for my flock notice when I went to Louisville and when I come back I ConEd in the gate and there was stabs drove there over my gate Mr goings the city street here was going up the lane he said Billy come here he said you have to move your Gates and things fence stone fence and Gates I said well okay Bill I said I I'll do it when he said I'll tell you I'll let you know when I said right first of the year they're going to start doing it I said all right so I started to go back back in the house and wife said I've got to go to grocery right quick I went down the lane and a boy Raymond King which is a city engineer I always called him mud ear because when we little kids swimming together he hit a guy in the ear with a lump of mud and we always called him mud ear he lives right down the lane from me about about second door Blow by the woods

concrete blocks it was Stones I said me get ready six straight dreams and then the vision kept it when these things comes to pass turn Westward I call Tucson brother Norman's got a place I don't know where I'm going I don't know what to do I'm just going to I'm standing I don't know what to do I'm leaving a home I don't have to pay rent on my wages is $100 a week and I almost have to pay $100 a month for a house I'm right here with my brothers and sisters where I'm loved and I'm going and I don't know where I don't know why I can't tell you why but there's only one thing I know is follow what he says do I don't know which way to turn what to do it's none of my I guess Abraham felt that way when he told him go over across the river he didn't know what to do but souljour separating self I didn't know what to do last Saturday morning one week from yesterday along about 3:00 in the morning i' gotten up got a drink of water and put the cover over Joseph in his room and then I come back and we just laid down I went to sleep and when I went to sleep I'm getting these little dreams and things off so you'll see the background of what I'm fixing to say I I covered up Joseph and I went back and laid down and went to sleep and I dreamed a dream and I dreamed that I saw a man that was supposed to be my father though he was a great big man and I saw a woman that was supposed to be my mother only she didn't look like my mother and this man was very mean to his wife and he had a three cornered stick where he clave this wood and it made a you know a chop of wood across a log you know it makes a three cornered stick and every time this woman would start to stand up he' just grab her by the neck and hit her on the head and knock her out and then she' lay there and snub and cry and then she' start coming back up again he'd walk around proud with his chest stuck out great big fella and once you'd raise up again he'd take her by the neck and take his three Corner stick and crack her on the head with it drop her down walk back and stick out his chest like he done something big and I was standing off watching it I thought I can't tackle that man he's too big and then he's supposed to be my papa but he ain't my papa and I said he ain't got no business treating that woman like that and I got kind of a little bit upset with him so then all at once I got up enough courage and I went over to him and grabbed him by the collar and turned him around and I said you have no right to strike her and when I said at that muscles grow I look like a giant and the man looked at those muscles and then he got scared of me and I said you strike her again you're going to deal with me and he kind of hesitated the stri her again and then I woke up I laid there a little while I thought what is that strange I dream about that woman and just in a moment here he come I got the interpretation the woman represents the Church of the world today all the world I was born right in this mess and here I am she's supposed to be kind of a a mother of if she was a mother of Harlot but yet I was born right into it and the her husband is the denominations that ruler the three cornered stick that she had is that Triune Baptist ISM in false names that every time she starts to rise up the congregation you accept it he whacks her down with it and of course him being so big I turned around was a little afraid of him and then I dashed into him anyhow and the muscles was Faith muscles that made me think if God's with me can give me muscles let me stand up for her which striking her must have been 10:00 in the day when my wife was trying to get into the room and it happened I went into a vision that morning and I somehow now remember it was not a dream there's difference between dreams and Visions dreams is when you go to sleep Visions when you don't go to sleep we're born that way an ordinary human being when he dreams it's in his subcon conscience and his subconscious is way away from him his sens is as active as long as he's in his first conscience in this conscience you you're normal you see taste feel smell hear but when you're in your subconscious asleep you don't neither see taste feel smell or here but there's something when you dream that you return back to this conscience there's a memory that you remember something that you dreamed about years ago an ordinary human being is that way but when God predestinate at something this subconscious is not way away from here to the sear but both consciences right together and the sear in a vision doesn't go to sleep he's still in his senses and sees it I was explaining that for some doctors the other day they raised up and said marvelous never even thought of such a thing when I was taking a wave test they said I they've never seen anything like that see well said there's something happens to you and I said I told him he said that's it exactly see the two conscience sit right close together it's nothing I could do and it don't make me more than anybody else it's just God made it that way you don't go to sleep you're right here just like asleep you're standing here looking right like this and all of you seen it around the world you don't go to sleep standing on a platform talking to people you hear me go in divisions and come back when I'm riding in a car with you anywhere else and tell you things that's going to happen and never fails never has has anybody ever seen it fail it can't fail it won't fail as long as it's god notice right on the platform thousands before tens of thousands of people even in other languages that I can't even speak still it don't fail see it's God now in this Vision or as I was speaking I looked and I saw a strange thing now it seemed like that my little son Joseph was by my side I was talking to him now if you watch the vision real close you'll see why Joseph was standing there and I looked and there was a big bush and on this bush in a in a constellation of birds little bitty Birds about half inch long and a half inch high they were a little veterans the little feathers is beat down and there was a about two or three on the top limb uh six or eight on the next lmb and 15 or 20 on the next lmb coming down in the shape of a pyramid and those little fellows little Messengers and they were pretty well worn out and they were watching Eastward and I was at Tucson Arizona in division for it made it so perfect purpose that he didn't want me to fail to see where was at I was picking a sandur off of me from the desert and I said now I know this is a vision and I know that I'm a Tucson and I
