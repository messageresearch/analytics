TRANSCRIPT
========================================
joy is about a confidence it's about a trust [Music] you want to recognize that there's an enemy who is out to steal to kill to destroy he does not want you to have joy he doesn't even want you to have peace he doesn't want you to feel the love of god in your life he doesn't want you to be able to function he wants to fill you with such anxiety and fear and depression and oppression and pain and all these other things the spirit of god said woundedness and here is the thing about woundedness everybody under the sound of my voice knows what it feels like to be wounded we've all had anything from a boo-boo to a major surgery in the natural and even in the spiritual we know what it means to be gob-smacked [Music] slapped around beat up drugged through the dirt we've experienced these things but we choose as the overcoming bride of jesus christ and his invitation to come and lay all of that before him and he pours the fatness of joy all over it did you know the bible said he would fill us with the oil of gladness the oil of joy that word oil there is the fat he wants to fill us with the fat of gladness with the fat of joy he wants to pour on us everything we need to give him the praise that he rightfully deserves and joy is not about a feeling joy is about a confidence it's about a trust it's about complete trust it's about total trust it's about completely and totally trusting the lord who has called you how many of you believe he who has started a good work he who has started a good work is more than able to finish that work in your life he is both the author [Music] and the who and the finisher of our faith he's not only given to every individual in this room a seed of faith a measure of faith but he has poured his oil on that faith and the more he does the more we use it the more he anoints it the more we exercise it and and we use it and we stretch it and it becomes stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and it's not how much faith you have it's whether or not you you choose to leave your faith in place or whether you choose to withdraw it and pull it back you've got to keep putting your faith in
