========================================

Description:
Not only do we have to train ourselves what to think, but we also​ have to train ourselves where to look! We must make a conscious effort to look over into the realm of the unseen by faith. 
    The reality in its fulness is in the realm of eternity and by faith, we must reach out for that while walking in the realm of the negative. If we can keep our focus on that realm, we can maintain our praise.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you're looking in faith to the unseen realm and that is the eternal existence [Music] there is something on the inside of us that has a connection to God that cannot be broken he's given us the gift of faith and faith is an anchor we've just got to keep throwing our faith anchor over into the realm of the unseen into the dimension of the supernatural into that spirit realm that the Bible tells us so much about and let our anchor drop over there in the unseen and take that as your absolute this is not reality in its fullness reality in its fullness is beyond the curtain of time reality in its fullness is in the realm of eternity thank God every one of us have a measure of eternity living inside of us by eternal life eternal life is a portion of eternity it's a seed of eternity that's been planted in every believer who has been baptized with the life of Jesus Christ oh if we can get a hold of that and live in that realm while walking through the negative if we can keep our spirit reaching out for what is over there and our eternal promise while we're going through difficulties down here I believe God will help us maintain our praise you can maintain your praise no matter what you're going through this morning if you'll reach your faith over there into that unseen realm and say Jesus that is more real that is more real than what I'm walking through this morning you can see faith in action but you can't see faith you can see love in action but you can't see love you can see joy and demonstration but you can't see joy but how many of you know Joe is real you believe joy is real you believe faith is real you be love is real but you can't see it you can if you know where you're looking you're looking in faith to the unseen realm and that is the eternal existence not only do we have to train ourselves what to think we have to train ourselves where to look we have to make a spiritual conscious faith-filled effort to choose to look beyond the scene to the unseen realm of faith with men things are impossible but with God how many things all things are possible
