[0:00] some people can only relate to A Jesus
[0:02] who let's say is less than 10 or 11
[0:06] pounds the
[0:08] greatest the best Christmas gift people
[0:12] like to
[0:14] say and you can only say that if you're
[0:18] Catholic because Gentiles don't observe
[0:21] the
[0:23] mass I am not a
[0:28] Catholic my faith is not based on a
[0:32] mass when I want to say the birth I say
[0:36] the birth of Jesus the birth of
[0:40] Christ I don't you say what you like I
[0:43] don't have to make him Catholic I don't
[0:45] want him to be Pentecostal either I
[0:48] don't want him to be message either I
[0:50] want him to be God I don't need a
[0:53] religious Jesus I need God I need a God
[0:57] who can help me out of my mess I need a
[1:00] God who loves me who cares for me I
[1:02] don't need a crying snotting pooping
[1:06] baby in a
[1:10] Manger I don't need a Jesus that I've
[1:13] got to change his
[1:18] diaper I got to have one who died for me
[1:23] who made his life available to me by the
[1:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31] amen I've got to have one who has never
[1:35] participated in
[1:37] Pagan Babylonian Greek or Roman
[1:43] practices I've got to have a God who
[1:45] never needed a Christmas
[1:49] tree to bring him praise or honor Or
[1:53] Glory because nobody in their right mind
[2:00] thinks deep in their heart that that
[2:05] Evergreen represents
[2:09] Jesus and if it does why do atheists put
[2:12] them
[2:14] up why do pagans put them up why do
[2:17] witches and covens put them
[2:20] up why do Buddhist put them up do you
[2:22] know they're Buddhists now because
[2:24] Christmas has become a universal holiday
[2:27] having nothing to do with faith or truth
[2:30] or
[2:31] reality and what's crazy is only the
[2:34] Catholic Church could pull it off only
[2:36] the Catholic Church could make a
[2:39] mass to commemorate the birth of a of a
[2:42] of a God and the whole world honor it in
[2:47] some way or
[2:48] another no wonder Martin
[2:51] Luther as Twisted as some of his ideas
[2:56] were no wonder he jumped up off of his
[2:59] knees when he read the verse that said
[3:01] the just shall live by
[3:03] faith Hallelujah not by the Apostles
[3:06] Creed not by confession not by the
[3:10] rosary but by faith in the shed
[3:13] blood not faith in a baby in a Manger
[3:17] but faith in the shed blood of Jesus
[3:21] Christ not faith in dressing right or or
[3:25] wearing your hair right but faith in the
[3:29] blood of Jesus Christ brought to you by
[3:33] Grace we don't live a separated life to
[3:36] be saved we live a Sanctified life
[3:40] because we
[3:42] are because we are
[3:46] saved but the real glory of Jesus is
[3:49] found in the last place we would ever
[3:51] look not his birth not in his miraculous
[3:54] life not in his miracles not even in his
[3:57] precious words
[4:00] the real glory of Jesus is only found in
[4:02] his death burial and
[4:06] Resurrection his crucifixion that's why
[4:08] he tells us remember
[4:11] me not my
[4:14] birth not my
[4:16] childhood not even my Ministry he said
[4:20] remember my
[4:21] death remember my death he kept point
[4:24] you want to know who Jesus is he's
[4:27] pointing us to the selfless one one he's
[4:30] pointing us to the one who has such
[4:33] great love that he laid his life down
[4:37] this world will never be able to find
[4:39] the authentic Jesus if they keep him in
[4:42] a
[4:47] Manger they're looking for Christmas
[4:50] spirit this time of
[4:53] year not Holy Spirit
