[46:45] prayed for the family and and then went
[46:48] on home and it just got to bothering me
[46:50] so i got in the vehicle i went back
[46:52] i saw it again and as soon as i got on
[46:55] the other side of the railroad track to
[46:57] put my trash out they blocked it and
[46:59] wouldn't let me come back across so i
[47:01] had to go up down the dirt road
[47:03] um
[47:04] the from the second glimpse i thought it
[47:06] was a lady or she had like shoulder
[47:08] length hair but we found out yesterday
[47:11] it was a man who had come there to take
[47:13] his life
[47:14] my heart has just i i just can't seem to
[47:17] shake it
[47:18] and
[47:20] like i told my family yesterday somebody
[47:23] loved him
[47:24] he might not have known it he may not
[47:26] have realized it but somebody loved him
[47:29] and they are hurting and grieving his
[47:32] loss
[47:33] and he left a note with the with the man
[47:36] who runs the dump
[47:38] and that man is so troubled
[47:40] because he told him as he was walking
[47:42] away i'm going up here to take my life
[47:45] and the man begged him pleaded with him
[47:47] please don't go please don't do that
[47:49] plea please and he said he
[47:51] is still pleading with him and called
[47:53] 9-1-1 and he and he saw the man he there
[47:57] was nothing else he could do waiting
[47:58] trying to answer the questions of 9-1-1
[48:01] i don't really think that should have
[48:03] been spoken out loud but i did anyway
[48:06] i just can't seem to shake it and i
[48:08] think there must be a reason there must
[48:11] be a he left a note to his wife maybe
[48:14] the wife is
[48:15] i know she's devastated it doesn't
[48:17] matter what the circumstances are he
[48:19] could have been terribly abusive to her
[48:22] but i know there must be broken hearts
[48:24] today yes yes and mine is if nobody else
[48:27] says would you please ask the lord to
[48:30] help the the ones who knew him and loved
[48:33] him and that poor man at the dump is so
[48:35] traumatized he told my wife he said i
[48:38] cried again on the way to work today if
[48:40] i i wished i could have done more i
[48:42] wished i would have known more to do but
[48:43] i did all i knew to do please pray for
[48:47] that situation i would love to know that
[48:49] god hears these prayers and that he's
[48:51] somehow helping something turning
[48:54] something you can never undo that
[48:57] but something could be made right in the
[48:59] family or something let's ask the lord

[1:11:37] oh
[1:11:38] you've grown
[1:11:41] so tired of
[1:11:43] the conflict
[1:11:48] the pain
[1:11:51] and the fire and the storm
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:11:58] oh and sometimes
[1:12:01] in your doubts and
[1:12:04] confusion
[1:12:09] you've even questioned
[1:12:12] oh
[1:12:13] where is
[1:12:15] the lord
[1:12:19] but you know i have prayed
[1:12:23] in the dark of
[1:12:25] the midnight
[1:12:30] when
[1:12:31] doubt
[1:12:33] was all i could see
[1:12:40] but while patiently
[1:12:44] waiting
[1:12:46] for
[1:12:47] more
[1:12:50] that's when i heard
[1:12:53] my lord whisper
[1:12:57] to me you sing with me tell me what he
[1:12:59] says he says endure
[1:13:03] you must endure

[1:13:11] oh
[1:13:12] we're all fighting
[1:13:15] a battle
[1:13:17] but we're
[1:13:19] gonna win
[1:13:22] at last
[1:13:24] oh
[1:13:25] fast
[1:13:27] don't bow
[1:13:29] down
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:44] if you believe you can with his help
[1:13:46] give him some praise
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:54] we can
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:58] would you thank the lord for these
[1:14:00] musicians and their gifts and talents
[1:14:02] and all their giving for the lord
[1:14:06] those who are running the stream and
[1:14:08] let's all stand together
[1:14:11] we're going to read this morning from
[1:14:12] second corinthians chapter 10.
[1:14:16] we're going to read beginning in verse
[1:14:18] 4.
[1:14:19] these are familiar portions of scripture
[1:14:23] we have been speaking now for two times
[1:14:25] together sunday and
[1:14:27] tuesday night
[1:14:29] the battle is raging and it is
[1:14:33] it is raging it's raging on every hand
[1:14:36] but we are so thankful that we know the
[1:14:38] victor
[1:14:40] the one who went all the way and paid
[1:14:42] the price
[1:14:43] and won the victory for us
[1:14:46] and uh this morning i want to take it to
[1:14:48] just another place same theme
[1:14:51] but i want to take it to another place
[1:14:53] and call it freedom is a choice
[1:14:56] for the weapons of our warfare
[1:14:59] are not carnal
[1:15:01] but mighty through god
[1:15:04] to the pulling down
[1:15:06] of what
[1:15:07] strongholds
[1:15:09] casting down imaginations
[1:15:12] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:15:15] itself
[1:15:17] against the knowledge of god
[1:15:19] and bringing into captivity
[1:15:24] thank you for helping me
[1:15:26] every thought
[1:15:28] to the obedience of christ
[1:15:31] you may think it's nearly impossible but
[1:15:33] it's not
[1:15:35] we must
[1:15:36] this is the only way to overcome in
[1:15:38] satan's eden is to be able to take every
[1:15:41] thought when you recognize that you're
[1:15:44] having a thought that is contrary to
[1:15:46] what god's word has said about you
[1:15:49] you must immediately refuse it you must
[1:15:52] immediately rebuke it and tell it what
[1:15:54] it is it's a lie
[1:15:56] you're a liar devil and the father of
[1:15:59] all eyes i'm going to take god at his
[1:16:01] word
[1:16:03] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:16:06] the obedience of christ and having in
[1:16:10] a readiness to revenge all disobedience
[1:16:15] when your obedience is
[1:16:18] fulfilled i think if we concentrate on
[1:16:22] our own obedience we won't have much
[1:16:24] time to get around to worrying about
[1:16:26] somebody else's disobedience
[1:16:29] now let's pray together just a moment
[1:16:31] father we thank you for your word it's
[1:16:34] rich
[1:16:35] it's life to us
[1:16:37] it's hope and strength it gives us
[1:16:40] courage and encouragement it corrects us
[1:16:44] it gives us leadership and direction
[1:16:48] it helps us lord to recognize the day
[1:16:51] we're living in
[1:16:53] and the grace that has been set aside
[1:16:56] for the last of the last days now lord
[1:16:59] we look to you for help we know that
[1:17:02] you've been so gracious to us in this
[1:17:04] service already your presence has been
[1:17:08] here as we lifted up your name and
[1:17:10] worshiped in spirit and truth and now we
[1:17:14] know the real battle begins we know lord
[1:17:17] that now as your word goes forth that we
[1:17:20] have been told that every demon in hell
[1:17:23] is against that word
[1:17:25] not only against it in written form but
[1:17:28] against it when it is preached because
[1:17:32] we understand that faith comes by
[1:17:34] hearing the word of god
[1:17:36] we recognize that our enemy will not
[1:17:39] just lay over roll over and play dead he
[1:17:42] will do everything and everything he can
[1:17:44] to distract our minds from the purity of
[1:17:47] your word but today lord we look to you
[1:17:50] and we ask that you will give us
[1:17:52] strength and grace to hear what you have
[1:17:55] set aside for us give us courage to
[1:17:58] respond accordingly not only with our
[1:18:01] amen but most importantly with our life
[1:18:05] lord today i can only speak as an
[1:18:09] individual but i want a decree that i
[1:18:12] choose freedom
[1:18:14] i choose deliverance
[1:18:16] i choose liberty this is what your blood
[1:18:19] has accomplished on my behalf and i make
[1:18:22] it my choice
[1:18:24] today even as i did yesterday and if you
[1:18:28] should grant me tomorrow i'll do the
[1:18:29] same now lord give us all the same
[1:18:32] strength the same faith the same courage
[1:18:35] to choose what you have paid such a high
[1:18:39] price to secure for us and we'll give
[1:18:42] you the glory and the honor and the
[1:18:44] praise for it's in the lovely name of
[1:18:46] our lord jesus christ we pray and the
[1:18:49] saint said
[1:18:51] you may be seated now do your best to
[1:18:54] stay with me if you can because
[1:18:57] some of you need to
[1:18:59] make sure that you are making a daily
[1:19:01] choice for freedom
[1:19:03] because the enemy is desiring to bind
[1:19:06] you with something
[1:19:08] he wants to bind us
[1:19:10] he wants to impede us from moving
[1:19:13] forward to be a victorious people now
[1:19:16] jesus didn't die to leave us in our
[1:19:19] condition did he he died and rose again
[1:19:23] to deliver us from where we were and to
[1:19:26] place us where we should be according to
[1:19:28] the mind of god
[1:19:30] and really the battle is won in jesus
[1:19:34] now we're fighting the battle's raging
[1:19:36] and we're fighting but what we're really
[1:19:38] doing is just showing up to claim the
[1:19:41] victory that he's already won for us
[1:19:44] and in showing up we're being obedient
[1:19:46] to what the word said and it's not easy
[1:19:48] to show up sometime
[1:19:50] hello
[1:19:52] it's not easy to show up sometime why
[1:19:54] you just ask anybody
[1:19:56] every monday it's rare if if everybody
[1:19:58] jumps up and first sound of the alarm
[1:20:01] and says whoa i get to go to work today
[1:20:05] how many of you do that
[1:20:07] praise the lord jennifer
[1:20:09] uh
[1:20:10] can you imagine a school teacher
[1:20:13] and yet she really loves the privilege
[1:20:16] that god has given her to work that job
[1:20:18] now there may come a day somewhere by
[1:20:20] thursday hump day
[1:20:22] that she may not be quite as excited
[1:20:25] but she has to make a choice to show up
[1:20:28] and to show up at her best well i want
[1:20:31] you to know the children of god are
[1:20:33] making the same choice every day to show
[1:20:36] up in this warfare
[1:20:38] my granny used to say there is no
[1:20:40] discharge in this war
[1:20:42] there's no retirement in this fight we
[1:20:45] have to fight all the way to the end as
[1:20:49] we sung just a moment ago he that
[1:20:51] endureth
[1:20:52] how long
[1:20:54] till the end the same shall be saved so
[1:20:58] we are going to fight and we are going
[1:21:00] to have stress and we're going to have
[1:21:02] pressure and we're going to have
[1:21:04] oppressing things happen to us
[1:21:07] brother branham told us about that great
[1:21:10] battle the greatest battle ever fought
[1:21:12] and he told us that it would be a battle
[1:21:14] of the mind fought on the battleground
[1:21:17] or the battlefield of the mind you know
[1:21:20] it's really the only place satan can
[1:21:22] fight the believer
[1:21:24] and i don't know what it'll be like in
[1:21:26] the future but we have been a blessed
[1:21:28] people as christians in america
[1:21:31] we've had so many freedoms given to us
[1:21:34] haven't we we haven't had to fear for
[1:21:36] our life we haven't had the fear for for
[1:21:39] a lot of persecution from the government
[1:21:41] and so forth like like some of our
[1:21:43] friends in other nations who have
[1:21:46] literally shivered in the dark sneaking
[1:21:49] out to go to the house of god afraid to
[1:21:52] be discovered because it could cost them
[1:21:55] their life some of us even know families
[1:21:58] that have lost loved ones because of
[1:22:00] their dedication to christ in nations
[1:22:03] where there was a cool where there was a
[1:22:06] group of people raising up to try to
[1:22:08] take the nation and uh we know preachers
[1:22:12] i actually knew a pastor
[1:22:15] that was murdered for his faith his son
[1:22:18] pastors a church in this message today
[1:22:21] as a testimony that god doesn't make
[1:22:24] mistakes
[1:22:25] one one passes and leaves the torch and
[1:22:29] another raises up to take that torch
[1:22:31] but we in america have been greatly
[1:22:34] blessed
[1:22:35] we just go to church when we feel like
[1:22:37] it when we want to we decide we don't
[1:22:39] want to sometimes we just stay out we do
[1:22:42] things just kind of like we want to
[1:22:44] we can choose a job we don't have to be
[1:22:48] forced for the rest of our life in a
[1:22:50] miserable job we have all kinds of
[1:22:52] freedoms available to us
[1:22:55] and we're blessed
[1:22:56] we don't know what the future is going
[1:22:58] to look like we don't know how it's
[1:23:00] going to be tomorrow but we better take
[1:23:02] advantage of what god has given us today
[1:23:05] and we ought to be thankful for it
[1:23:07] now these freedoms that we have let's
[1:23:10] just say in america they weren't free
[1:23:13] somebody had to pay a great price i'm
[1:23:15] not talking about politicians
[1:23:18] i don't know how the price the
[1:23:20] politicians are paying but i want you to
[1:23:22] know those who have defended our
[1:23:23] freedoms on foreign soil and even on our
[1:23:27] own soil those who have given their
[1:23:29] lives the ultimate sacrifice to
[1:23:32] guarantee that you and i would have
[1:23:33] freedom
[1:23:35] that lady liberty that stands out there
[1:23:37] in the harbor is a beacon to a lot of
[1:23:39] immigrant families who have come legally
[1:23:42] to our nation and have been granted
[1:23:44] freedom and many of you and
[1:23:46] and i myself
[1:23:48] have ancestors who were so thankful to
[1:23:51] be able to escape what was going on in
[1:23:54] their home country and come and live in
[1:23:57] america and have freedom
[1:23:59] but it wasn't free
[1:24:00] and i want you to know as a believer the
[1:24:03] freedom that you and i have wasn't free
[1:24:06] and it wasn't cheap it cost him his life
[1:24:09] it was an ultimate sacrifice and he
[1:24:12] didn't just overcome in the hour that he
[1:24:15] was living but he overcame for all
[1:24:17] eternity and the victory that he won at
[1:24:20] calvary is not just mine the night i get
[1:24:23] saved but it's mine today it'll be mine
[1:24:26] tomorrow and it'll be mine for all
[1:24:28] eternity and we're learning to live a
[1:24:31] grateful life
[1:24:32] we're learning that thanksgiving isn't a
[1:24:34] day of the year it's a lifestyle
[1:24:37] and we're learning that there's victory
[1:24:40] in giving god the praise and there's
[1:24:42] victory in being thankful for what the
[1:24:45] lord has provided for us
[1:24:47] i want to give you a few quotations this
[1:24:49] morning that i've already given you this
[1:24:51] week and then we're going to move on to
[1:24:53] something in the message testimony which
[1:24:56] is a testimony about the raising of a
[1:24:58] little dead boy
[1:25:00] this was given in west palm beach
[1:25:02] florida and it's paragraph 14
[1:25:05] and this is the quote that talks about
[1:25:07] fighting for every inch this is from
[1:25:10] last week's notes you've got to go do it
[1:25:14] and you've got to fight for every inch
[1:25:18] of ground that you have let me ask you
[1:25:21] spiritually have you found that to be
[1:25:23] the truth
[1:25:25] have you really found out that there are
[1:25:28] no miles we're not winning miles in this
[1:25:31] hour we're winning inch
[1:25:33] by inch
[1:25:34] by inch by inch temptations come and how
[1:25:38] do we overcome them inch
[1:25:40] by inch by inch and not by our own
[1:25:44] strength or our own wit or our own
[1:25:47] intelligence we're overcoming as sister
[1:25:50] april said by the blood of the lamb by
[1:25:53] the price that jesus paid for us but we
[1:25:56] have to show up and we have to maintain
[1:25:59] i saw i saw some maintainers here this
[1:26:02] morning
[1:26:03] i saw some pushing the fireball
[1:26:06] are you with me i saw some of you nobody
[1:26:10] called you to come forward nobody
[1:26:12] orchestrated that but i saw and i want
[1:26:15] you to know i wish you could have seen i
[1:26:17] may get choked up here i wish you could
[1:26:19] have seen the look on some of your faces
[1:26:21] when you come
[1:26:22] i knew when you come down the allument
[1:26:24] business
[1:26:26] i knew you weren't coming down here to
[1:26:28] be seen
[1:26:29] i knew you weren't coming down here to
[1:26:31] show off a new frock or a new tie i knew
[1:26:34] by the look on many of your faces that
[1:26:36] you were coming because you wanted to
[1:26:39] show up
[1:26:41] because you wanted to push
[1:26:44] you wanted to maintain the victory that
[1:26:46] we've been winning in the last few weeks
[1:26:49] and you wanted to push the fireball a
[1:26:51] little farther down the hill
[1:26:54] believing that as it goes forward with
[1:26:56] momentum it will increase and increase
[1:26:59] and increase
[1:27:01] you will begin to speak your own
[1:27:03] deliverances
[1:27:06] as you shift the atmosphere around you
[1:27:09] and yes there's a battle
[1:27:11] there's a battle going on
[1:27:14] yours may not look like mine and mine
[1:27:16] may not look like yours but it doesn't
[1:27:18] matter what it looks like anyhow jesus
[1:27:20] has the last say
[1:27:22] it may be job trouble it may be physical
[1:27:25] malady it may be financial issue it may
[1:27:28] be spiritual problem it may be that you
[1:27:32] have some sort of issue or you may have
[1:27:35] some sort of insecurity or you may be
[1:27:37] carrying something that you've carried
[1:27:40] far too long i don't know what the
[1:27:42] battle looks like for you but i'm
[1:27:44] telling you the same victory that i win
[1:27:47] is the victory that you can win and we
[1:27:50] win it every day
[1:27:52] and we take it inch by inch by inch
[1:27:58] maybe some habit has creeped into your
[1:28:00] life
[1:28:01] you can't seem to get the victory over
[1:28:03] it once and for all it's what you'd like
[1:28:06] to have but you can't find that once and
[1:28:09] for all victory let me tell you what you
[1:28:11] can find inch
[1:28:16] oh yes
[1:28:18] just one day at a time
[1:28:20] just one day at a time
[1:28:22] just one minute by minute inch by inch
[1:28:25] he goes on to say every man in here
[1:28:28] that's born of the spirit of god knows
[1:28:31] that you've had to fight
[1:28:33] for every inch of ground just a moment
[1:28:42] toe the mark
[1:28:43] with satan
[1:28:45] isn't that right
[1:28:47] he said friends this is not a picnic
[1:28:52] i hear some christians talking i wonder
[1:28:55] why i didn't get an invitation to the
[1:28:57] picnic
[1:28:59] because there is no picnic
[1:29:02] this is not a trip to the carousel
[1:29:05] this is a bloody battle
[1:29:08] oh yes it is and it takes obedience
[1:29:12] and there can be no obedience in our
[1:29:14] life without determination
[1:29:17] and there can be no determination
[1:29:19] without faith
[1:29:20] you've got to first believe that he is
[1:29:24] and that he is a rewarder of those who
[1:29:26] diligently seek him and once you realize
[1:29:30] that and recognize that this is not just
[1:29:32] a general promise that can be very
[1:29:35] flippantly claimed but it must be
[1:29:38] claimed as an individual
[1:29:40] and once you realize that because you
[1:29:43] have heartache and trouble doesn't mean
[1:29:45] that god doesn't love you
[1:29:47] or that he has forsaken you
[1:29:50] or that he has forgotten you
[1:29:52] i dare say everyone in this room has
[1:29:55] felt that way a time or two
[1:29:57] and if you haven't i don't know where
[1:29:59] you're from
[1:30:01] i can't imagine what kind of christian
[1:30:03] life you've been living
[1:30:04] if there wasn't some point where you
[1:30:07] felt like the voice was silent
[1:30:10] you've ever seen joan of arc or heard
[1:30:12] joan of arc's testimony here god is
[1:30:14] speaking to her she's moving forward to
[1:30:17] take the victory and lead a nation to
[1:30:19] victory and all of a sudden she needs to
[1:30:21] hear from these voices
[1:30:24] presumably god's speaking to her in
[1:30:26] various and sun dry ways
[1:30:28] and now they're silent
[1:30:31] and now she's
[1:30:32] arrested and now she's in prison
[1:30:36] and now her life she's being ravished
[1:30:38] and beaten
[1:30:39] you check history and now she's about to
[1:30:42] pay the ultimate price
[1:30:44] because she surrendered her life to god
[1:30:47] she's forsaken by her own church the
[1:30:49] roman catholic church and she's about to
[1:30:51] be burned at the stake
[1:30:54] by the same ones that once rejoiced as
[1:30:57] she was a trophy and a member of their
[1:30:59] church and they once rejoiced because
[1:31:01] she was a vital part of their church
[1:31:03] community and now she's going to go to
[1:31:05] the state and be treated like a witch
[1:31:08] and all she needs is a voice
[1:31:10] all she needs is a little comfort all
[1:31:13] she needs is a reminder i'm still with
[1:31:15] you child and she can't hear anything
[1:31:19] and she comes right down to the end and
[1:31:21] it seems like god is silent i want you
[1:31:24] to know sometimes he is
[1:31:26] he may be silent but you are never alone
[1:31:30] you are never forsaken he may not be
[1:31:32] doing all the talking right now but he
[1:31:35] is with you he said i'll be with you
[1:31:37] even until the end i will never leave
[1:31:40] you i will never forsake you says the
[1:31:44] lord
[1:31:45] but there's an old enemy out there
[1:31:46] there's an adversary out there
[1:31:49] i want you to know demons are real
[1:31:53] i don't know who everybody is this
[1:31:55] morning i don't know what your thoughts
[1:31:56] are i don't know who's streaming this
[1:31:58] service i know we get all kinds of
[1:32:00] people
[1:32:01] who stream a service i know there are
[1:32:03] many people that don't believe in demons
[1:32:06] i read this week where brother branham
[1:32:07] said if angels are real and i know they
[1:32:09] are the demons are real he said in fact
[1:32:11] the demon is just as real as an angel
[1:32:13] ever dared to be
[1:32:15] same reality
[1:32:17] and i want you to know those demons were
[1:32:19] once out there just turned on the
[1:32:21] godless
[1:32:23] those who had not repented those
[1:32:24] unbelievers
[1:32:26] scrambling around the mate believer
[1:32:29] but they weren't too concerned about the
[1:32:30] believer
[1:32:32] but we're living in the last of the last
[1:32:34] days now
[1:32:35] and the message has told us that there's
[1:32:37] thousands times ten thousands of now
[1:32:41] imps
[1:32:42] demon spirits
[1:32:44] you know what's so mysterious to me and
[1:32:47] it's just hard to get my mind around
[1:32:49] that some of these evil spirits
[1:32:52] are the very same beings that once
[1:32:55] worshipped god
[1:32:57] in spirit
[1:33:00] once stood before the throne
[1:33:03] the prophet talked about before they
[1:33:05] were spun off
[1:33:06] i can show that to you at another time
[1:33:10] until before they were spun off
[1:33:12] in that great adversarial war that took
[1:33:16] place when lucifer who was created to
[1:33:19] worship god and to have authority over
[1:33:21] the newly created earth he now says i'm
[1:33:24] no longer satisfied with my earthly
[1:33:26] existence and my assignment on planet
[1:33:29] earth i want to ascend and put my throne
[1:33:32] above the throne of god
[1:33:34] and when he did his rebellion persuaded
[1:33:37] two-thirds of the angels to now follow
[1:33:40] him and when he was cast out they were
[1:33:43] cast out with him
[1:33:45] is that right
[1:33:47] brother branham said that was them being
[1:33:48] spun off out there without a body
[1:33:51] and now they're they're evil spirits or
[1:33:55] demons there are several other
[1:33:56] explanations for what's where some of
[1:33:59] those spirits came from we can look at
[1:34:02] that another time but they're real
[1:34:05] they know who you are
[1:34:07] they're out to talk to you
[1:34:10] oh brother shelly you're just getting
[1:34:11] creepy this morning no i'm here to tell
[1:34:14] you you need to understand you've got an
[1:34:16] adversary
[1:34:19] and you need to be i need to be on my
[1:34:21] toes
[1:34:22] i don't need to run out to fight him
[1:34:24] without knowing who he is
[1:34:26] and what he has power to do
[1:34:29] i was studying this week i i spent quite
[1:34:33] a bit of time yesterday afternoon
[1:34:35] putting together 45 pages of quotations
[1:34:39] on this subject that we may never get to
[1:34:42] but it sure was a blessing to study to
[1:34:45] put all those things together
[1:34:47] i relearned some things that i had
[1:34:49] forgotten about how those spirits
[1:34:52] operate and how they would operate in
[1:34:55] the last days they don't like to operate
[1:34:58] singularly
[1:35:00] they like to operate in families or
[1:35:02] groups
[1:35:05] and i want you to know they have an
[1:35:07] unusual sense of being able to discern
[1:35:12] when their days are numbered
[1:35:14] in that odd
[1:35:16] when they're about to lose the hold that
[1:35:19] they have maintained for so long on some
[1:35:22] poor person
[1:35:24] some precious soul
[1:35:26] that's been held in bondage
[1:35:28] by families of groups of demon spirits
[1:35:32] and things begin to change in that life
[1:35:36] brother branham said they come into a
[1:35:38] service like the one we're in here
[1:35:40] tonight and he said they begin to
[1:35:42] realize
[1:35:44] their days are numbered
[1:35:46] they're about to be cast out
[1:35:49] and so he said let me tell you what they
[1:35:50] do and i want you to hear me
[1:35:52] he said let me tell you what they do
[1:35:54] they start calling out
[1:35:58] this is too much for some folks
[1:36:01] they start calling out to one another
[1:36:04] gathering together support
[1:36:08] come on now you may have never seen this
[1:36:11] in the spirit but you've seen it in the
[1:36:13] natural
[1:36:15] i know you have
[1:36:17] you'll see how those spirits work they
[1:36:19] work on sympathies
[1:36:23] their whole theme is unsanctified mercy
[1:36:27] they'll try to get you to feel sorry for
[1:36:29] something
[1:36:30] sorry for somebody
[1:36:32] not realizing all along that this is not
[1:36:35] people problem this is demonic
[1:36:38] you can't win
[1:36:40] a people problem or solve a people
[1:36:42] problem you can't do that if it's a if
[1:36:45] it's a spiritual thing
[1:36:47] you're not going to be able to solve it
[1:36:49] with counseling you're only going to be
[1:36:52] able to solve it with power
[1:36:56] and with authority
[1:36:57] and i don't care how they stack are you
[1:36:59] with me
[1:37:00] i think you are now i don't care how
[1:37:02] they stack up
[1:37:04] i don't care how they gather
[1:37:06] i don't care how they call out listen
[1:37:08] whoo
[1:37:09] i didn't mean to say all this this
[1:37:11] morning this is off subject a little bit
[1:37:14] i wanted to lay this out for you a
[1:37:16] little more orderly
[1:37:18] how many of you have ever been listening
[1:37:20] to prayer lines
[1:37:22] oh and brother branham is beginning to
[1:37:24] pray he said wait a minute i lost that
[1:37:27] this is a man move with great
[1:37:29] discernment and not only did he operate
[1:37:31] in the in the in the spiritual gift of
[1:37:35] discerning of spirits but he was
[1:37:37] operating in something a little higher
[1:37:39] than that
[1:37:40] and he was able by a prophetic gift to
[1:37:43] see the mind of god and to hear the mind
[1:37:46] and will of god in a particular
[1:37:48] situation but he had to receive it from
[1:37:51] the lord
[1:37:52] it wasn't something he carried all the
[1:37:54] time he didn't just always know
[1:37:58] he wasn't all-knowing that's god not a
[1:38:00] prophet a prophet's not all-knowing god
[1:38:03] is all-knowing
[1:38:05] and so he received this information just
[1:38:07] like jesus did
[1:38:08] somebody said wait a minute just like
[1:38:10] jesus did that what jesus said he said i
[1:38:13] can't do anything unless it's given to
[1:38:14] me and my father
[1:38:16] whoo
[1:38:17] he see couldn't even say get up take up
[1:38:19] thy bed and walk if the father wasn't
[1:38:22] putting that in him and showing him hey
[1:38:26] there's a situation my my mind just a
[1:38:28] minute glory
[1:38:33] i know it's just hooping and hollering
[1:38:35] to some but i sure do like it
[1:38:37] oh i don't get to hoop and holler too
[1:38:39] much
[1:38:40] i'm not a great sports fan
[1:38:46] you know
[1:38:47] i almost defend my children my sons
[1:38:51] because i'm not as fan
[1:38:53] fan favorites as they are and i don't
[1:38:55] know who
[1:38:56] who these people are they talk about
[1:38:58] them like they live in our in our
[1:39:00] shed out there you know
[1:39:02] how did you know he won something he he
[1:39:05] did so oh wonderful
[1:39:07] and i just love it
[1:39:09] i even caught one of her girls saying
[1:39:11] our team and i said you know it's not
[1:39:13] our team
[1:39:16] we don't own the team they don't give us
[1:39:18] profits
[1:39:21] they're just a team
[1:39:24] oh that's dangerous to talk like that in
[1:39:26] the south in the wintertime
[1:39:29] but people get all carried away in that
[1:39:31] and i have to be honest when it's my
[1:39:33] boys playing softball i can get pretty
[1:39:35] caught up in the spirit of that too
[1:39:37] as some of you know
[1:39:41] i try to maintain myself the best i can
[1:39:44] because so many of the blues know i'm a
[1:39:45] pastor so i have to be a little bit you
[1:39:48] know
[1:39:49] i don't get carried away in that like a
[1:39:52] lot of people do but i want you to know
[1:39:54] there are some things that excite me
[1:39:57] and there's a place in this word
[1:40:00] there's a place that i can get in this
[1:40:02] message that really excites me
[1:40:06] because there are some simple
[1:40:08] keys
[1:40:09] that can solve some very complex
[1:40:12] problems in life
[1:40:15] we like to complicate things and so we
[1:40:18] often step over simple solutions but i
[1:40:21] want you to know this message of the
[1:40:23] hour this word of god that has been
[1:40:25] given to us is filled with simple
[1:40:29] solutions to life's complicated
[1:40:32] situations
[1:40:33] we just have to be willing to to
[1:40:35] sometimes look at it in a very simple
[1:40:38] way
[1:40:38] instead of a very intellectual way
[1:40:41] so brother branham is praying for people
[1:40:43] under that under that gift and
[1:40:46] also standing in the office that he was
[1:40:48] called to you can hear it for yourself
[1:40:51] there's people in this room that saw it
[1:40:53] with their own eyes
[1:40:55] there's people streaming this service
[1:40:56] still alive that were in those meetings
[1:40:59] and their needs were discerned and their
[1:41:01] problems were called out and they
[1:41:04] received healing sister wes sitting back
[1:41:06] there received a miraculous healing as
[1:41:09] she went through the prayer line brother
[1:41:11] branham discerned her need told her what
[1:41:14] it was said your back trouble has left
[1:41:16] you she said i felt like i was walking
[1:41:19] on air
[1:41:20] just walking on the clouds
[1:41:22] and god did exactly what he said
[1:41:25] sometimes brother branham would be
[1:41:26] praying for someone he'd see a vision he
[1:41:29] was a seer also
[1:41:31] and seer prophets
[1:41:33] see
[1:41:34] and so he was seeing the need seeing
[1:41:37] different things going on sometimes what
[1:41:40] was very close to him one minute would
[1:41:44] move away from him
[1:41:47] and that would be for various reasons
[1:41:50] sometimes doubt would come into that
[1:41:52] person's heart
[1:41:54] you think that you say i just don't see
[1:41:56] how that's possible how could anybody be
[1:41:58] standing in that divine presence of god
[1:42:01] and doubt because they're human beings
[1:42:05] and because they get distracted like we
[1:42:07] get distracted and so sometimes what was
[1:42:10] very loud to brother branham very plain
[1:42:13] to him in one moment it would draw away
[1:42:16] and he would say oh it's leaving
[1:42:19] sometimes he'd say to the person you're
[1:42:21] moving away from me
[1:42:23] sometimes he would say and a much
[1:42:25] younger person is coming close
[1:42:28] so every time the movement was happening
[1:42:31] wasn't because of doubt
[1:42:33] sometimes it was god just moving things
[1:42:35] in the realm of the spirit
[1:42:37] because there was a victory that was
[1:42:39] about to be executed in the life of that
[1:42:41] person are you still with me now don't
[1:42:44] you think for one minute i'm hung up in
[1:42:46] the past because jesus christ is the
[1:42:49] same
[1:42:51] yesterday and today and forever
[1:42:54] and if he ever did it then he can do it
[1:42:57] again today
[1:42:59] he's still god he's still a healer
[1:43:02] he's still a deliverer
[1:43:05] now brother branham looked at disease a
[1:43:06] whole lot different than doctors look at
[1:43:08] disease
[1:43:10] now very forward thinking doctors
[1:43:13] who study the quantum physics
[1:43:16] they look at disease a lot more like
[1:43:18] brother branham looked at disease
[1:43:20] 50 60 70 years ago
[1:43:23] brother branham would say things like
[1:43:25] there's a vibration
[1:43:28] remember he had a gift in his hand for a
[1:43:29] certain part of his ministry that would
[1:43:32] cause a registering of the vibration of
[1:43:34] that particular disease in his hand and
[1:43:37] as brother bosworth would tell
[1:43:39] he was able to look then at that hand
[1:43:42] and know what the disease was by the
[1:43:44] physical effect the vibration would have
[1:43:46] on his hands somebody said that just
[1:43:48] sounds like new age witchcraft to me
[1:43:50] well you might see it that way not
[1:43:54] understanding that disease
[1:43:57] is not just being
[1:43:59] uh
[1:44:00] afflicted
[1:44:02] but there's a life to it
[1:44:04] and it's many times spiritually driven
[1:44:08] and brother branham recognized that
[1:44:11] he recognized that in many cases
[1:44:14] illness and disease
[1:44:17] were demonic
[1:44:18] even in the bodies of christian people
[1:44:21] believers
[1:44:22] he recognized that and when we have time
[1:44:25] to lay this out for you 45 pages
[1:44:28] when we have time to lay this out for
[1:44:30] you i can show you the sequence of this
[1:44:32] revelation and how it began to come to
[1:44:34] him at different stages in his ministry
[1:44:38] and sometimes he would be up there
[1:44:40] praying
[1:44:41] for someone and he said oh i lost that
[1:44:45] he said i
[1:44:46] oh he said i see what it is
[1:44:51] i would have liked to have been sitting
[1:44:52] there
[1:44:53] he said oh i see what it is he said
[1:44:56] there's a man sitting right back over
[1:44:58] there who has the same problem
[1:45:04] incredible
[1:45:06] you're standing before me with a disease
[1:45:08] there's a man sitting right back over
[1:45:10] there
[1:45:11] who has the same disease
[1:45:14] and the demon
[1:45:19] not all disease
[1:45:21] is demonic
[1:45:23] some of it is self-inflicted
[1:45:28] but sometimes it's demonic has a life
[1:45:31] and a spirit to it
[1:45:33] a life to it
[1:45:34] there's no nobody hardly on the planet
[1:45:37] that would tell us the cancer doesn't
[1:45:38] have a life to it
[1:45:40] it's actually a living cell and a
[1:45:42] multiplication of living cells they're
[1:45:45] not healthy whole cells they're deformed
[1:45:48] as cells and they continue to multiply
[1:45:51] their deformity but they're alive
[1:45:54] therefore a tumor that's filled with
[1:45:56] cancerous cells has a life to it and
[1:45:59] brother branham would not always be able
[1:46:01] to detect the sickness unless
[1:46:03] it was one that carried a life
[1:46:06] and this is what he said that's so
[1:46:08] interesting to me he said now this
[1:46:10] started first as a spirit
[1:46:13] stay with me
[1:46:14] this started first as a spirit before it
[1:46:18] became a disease
[1:46:21] now he said we can treat the disease
[1:46:23] that's what we all do
[1:46:27] we we find us we know what's going on
[1:46:30] because we self-diagnose
[1:46:34] oh it's getting quiet again
[1:46:36] dr google
[1:46:40] we all go see dr google
[1:46:42] and we say dr google these are my
[1:46:44] symptoms
[1:46:46] this is what i'm going through is this
[1:46:48] normal
[1:46:50] and we put in her and oh my does the
[1:46:53] truth ever come full unfolding out on
[1:46:56] the screen and i'm telling you what
[1:46:59] you'll have people walking around saying
[1:47:01] i have colon cancer i have come on i
[1:47:05] have early onset dementia
[1:47:08] no you just forgot a name because you
[1:47:09] cram your brain full of your phone all
[1:47:11] day long and then when you need to
[1:47:13] remember something you're cramming out
[1:47:15] your brain cells
[1:47:16] but the enemy
[1:47:18] and dr google
[1:47:20] will cause people to move in fear
[1:47:24] when they don't have to move in fear
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:27] because some of these things that
[1:47:29] manifest in the physical are really
[1:47:31] spiritual problems
[1:47:33] and they are there because of the
[1:47:35] presence of a demon spirit and so
[1:47:37] brother branham learned if i can just
[1:47:39] discern what this is and go to the root
[1:47:42] of that and cast it out in the name of
[1:47:44] jesus
[1:47:45] this particular
[1:47:47] sort of scenario i'm talking about now
[1:47:49] he would say
[1:47:51] oh i lost that it it moved oh he said
[1:47:54] yes there's a man back here he has the
[1:47:57] same disease he got the same problem
[1:47:59] that you did and he said that spirit
[1:48:01] that same demon this demon here
[1:48:04] knows that his day his moments are
[1:48:07] numbered he's about to lose his hole i'm
[1:48:10] about to cast him out
[1:48:13] are you with me
[1:48:14] i can't believe i'd preach like this
[1:48:16] with visitors here
[1:48:19] he said this demon spirit here would
[1:48:21] start calling out
[1:48:23] to that demon spirit that that man had
[1:48:25] because of the disease it was present in
[1:48:26] his life calling out for help
[1:48:29] wouldn't you have loved to have been
[1:48:30] prophetic enough to hear that
[1:48:34] a demon spirit occupying this man's body
[1:48:37] knowing he's fixing to go
[1:48:40] you see a demon is never satisfied
[1:48:43] unless he has a body to dwell in
[1:48:46] because he was separated from his
[1:48:48] original created body as an angel
[1:48:51] and now he wants to function by
[1:48:53] occupying something
[1:48:55] and remember these demon spirits uh they
[1:48:58] they dwell in three three different
[1:49:00] realms the physical realm the spiritual
[1:49:02] realm and the religious realm
[1:49:05] and brother branham is the only one i've
[1:49:06] ever heard that put the third realm in
[1:49:08] there and called it the realm of
[1:49:10] religion and he names that there are
[1:49:12] certain demon spirits that function in
[1:49:14] each of those realms
[1:49:15] and if you can go to the root of that
[1:49:17] problem and get that spirit on the run
[1:49:20] the disease has to go
[1:49:24] isn't that amazing
[1:49:26] somebody said why are you telling us
[1:49:28] this because we're too sick
[1:49:31] i want to believe that if this is the
[1:49:34] truth and i believe it is that you and i
[1:49:36] might be able to learn how to discern
[1:49:39] the root of our problem and know that
[1:49:42] the blood of jesus christ can be sent to
[1:49:46] the root of the problem
[1:49:49] just like an axe
[1:49:51] to the root of the
[1:49:54] tree you see some demons operate in the
[1:49:57] physical realm and then some demons
[1:49:59] operate in the spiritual realm
[1:50:01] and what nathan was doing up here
[1:50:04] last uh
[1:50:06] oh
[1:50:07] it's getting late
[1:50:13] what what nathan was doing up here
[1:50:17] uh
[1:50:20] last sunday thank you all help me help
[1:50:22] me that's right get me through this
[1:50:25] uh
[1:50:27] at three
[1:50:29] colon 44
[1:50:31] that's three hours and 44 minutes in
[1:50:36] you turn there you go on the app
[1:50:38] you fast forward to three
[1:50:41] of hours and 44 minutes
[1:50:44] and you will find that there was a
[1:50:46] battle going on up here on this platform
[1:50:50] if there had been
[1:50:51] minded people here
[1:50:53] maybe visitors here they might able to
[1:50:55] run out the door
[1:50:57] they might would have said them people
[1:50:58] has lost their minds you know what you
[1:51:00] go tell that because you couldn't tell
[1:51:02] anything more close to the truth in that
[1:51:06] we have lost our minds
[1:51:09] because we read the new testament
[1:51:11] and he said we have the mind of christ
[1:51:14] the mind of christ is above and beyond
[1:51:16] the human mind it's above human
[1:51:19] understanding
[1:51:22] i'm telling you jesus has an answer and
[1:51:25] a solution and a remedy to every problem
[1:51:30] that we have
[1:51:31] including sickness and disease
[1:51:34] i don't know what all god is
[1:51:36] accomplishing for our brother stephen
[1:51:38] curry
[1:51:39] but i will tell you this
[1:51:41] he has is making so much improvement
[1:51:44] i get pictures every other day
[1:51:47] and i'm thankful for them
[1:51:49] and i want you to know i could show you
[1:51:51] two days ago picture and the first
[1:51:54] picture that we got and you would hardly
[1:51:56] believe that it was the same person
[1:51:58] because things are happening in his body
[1:52:03] going into a third week now
[1:52:07] days
[1:52:08] have become weeks
[1:52:10] and strength is coming
[1:52:15] somebody said what's going on let me
[1:52:16] tell you what's going on god is showing
[1:52:19] himself
[1:52:20] to be who he said he was
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:25] that's all
[1:52:26] that's all it is
[1:52:28] don't make it anything more than what it
[1:52:31] is god is saying i am the same yesterday
[1:52:36] today and forever
[1:52:39] god is saying you don't have to
[1:52:41] understand
[1:52:44] just trust me
[1:52:48] he says just trust me
[1:52:51] hallelujah
[1:52:53] hallelujah
[1:52:58] and so now hospice says
[1:53:05] you no longer need us every
[1:53:10] day imagine how this family feels some
[1:53:13] of them sitting here this morning
[1:53:15] to have the hospice nurse look and say
[1:53:17] i've got
[1:53:17] i got good news bad news
[1:53:22] the good news is
[1:53:26] you don't need me every day
[1:53:28] the bad news is i can only come every
[1:53:31] third day
[1:53:35] but that's really not bad news
[1:53:37] except the family really likes him
[1:53:40] and they want to see him
[1:53:42] and they're all sad that he might not be
[1:53:44] there
[1:53:46] i've had so many people say is this is
[1:53:48] this uh uh where are we about to see a
[1:53:51] creative miracle
[1:53:53] is god getting him ready because he is
[1:53:55] gonna i'm i just want you to focus on
[1:53:58] what god is saying to us now i'm showing
[1:54:01] myself
[1:54:05] i'll tell you what god's doing he's
[1:54:06] saying he's saying a man doesn't have to
[1:54:08] be sick to die
[1:54:13] he's saying my servants don't have to
[1:54:15] waste away to nothing
[1:54:18] i can touch their bodies
[1:54:20] i can baffle the minds of those who
[1:54:22] study these kinds of things
[1:54:25] come on now
[1:54:26] and you know why there's such victory
[1:54:28] happening and why there's so many
[1:54:29] changes happening is because there's a
[1:54:31] different approach now
[1:54:33] and those who are praying in the family
[1:54:34] that's ministering to him and those that
[1:54:37] are praying the most for him are doing
[1:54:38] it from a different perspective
[1:54:40] altogether realizing we're not just
[1:54:42] operating against a disease
[1:54:47] but we're operating against something
[1:54:48] that has spirit life
[1:54:51] and it has to be dealt with in a
[1:54:52] spiritual manner
[1:54:54] come on now
[1:54:56] you see so what brother nathan was doing
[1:54:58] i got to get back to my notes what
[1:55:00] nathan was doing up here with that sword
[1:55:03] it doesn't do a lot
[1:55:06] for demons that are operating in the
[1:55:08] physical realm
[1:55:10] because those that sword
[1:55:13] you know it could have clipped his
[1:55:14] daddy's ear
[1:55:17] but in the physical it was not
[1:55:19] accomplishing a whole lot
[1:55:21] but every battle's not in the physical
[1:55:25] did you read the scripture
[1:55:28] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:55:30] carnal but mighty threw god to the
[1:55:33] pulling down a stronghold
[1:55:35] but when he under the anointing
[1:55:38] began to wave that sword back and forth
[1:55:42] no there was no waving to it
[1:55:44] he was a swinging ant
[1:55:47] and like i said that will absolutely
[1:55:50] shake up your church entity
[1:55:53] and that will even upset some people
[1:55:55] around the message
[1:55:57] because they'll say there's no church
[1:55:59] order for that
[1:56:01] but they forget to understand
[1:56:04] that there are demons that operate in
[1:56:06] the spiritual realm and they can only be
[1:56:09] fought in the spiritual
[1:56:12] and so although he was carrying out a
[1:56:15] physical act he wasn't trying to change
[1:56:18] anything in the physical
[1:56:20] it was it was an act of faith and
[1:56:22] obedience
[1:56:24] against those demon spirits that operate
[1:56:26] in the spiritual realm and in the
[1:56:28] religious realm
[1:56:30] oh yes those oppressing spirits of
[1:56:33] depression and darkness and nervousness
[1:56:36] and anxiety and
[1:56:39] come on now
[1:56:42] you i know god dealt with some things
[1:56:44] as that sword began to fly and i've just
[1:56:47] made up my mind no matter what they say
[1:56:49] about us
[1:56:51] you don't have to live this life
[1:56:53] you don't have to walk in our shoe
[1:56:54] leather you don't have to fight the same
[1:56:57] battle we fight we're all fighting a
[1:56:59] battle but it may not look the same
[1:57:02] so you you do it you do you
[1:57:06] you do you and will do us
[1:57:09] amen because we understand we're
[1:57:11] understanding that there's a spiritual
[1:57:13] battle that can only be one with
[1:57:15] spiritual weapons
[1:57:17] all right are you still with me
[1:57:18] he said friends this is not a picnic
[1:57:20] it's a battleground we never come here
[1:57:22] to eat cookies and so forth we are in a
[1:57:25] battle
[1:57:26] that's the rest of the quote testimony
[1:57:28] now in a message uh i got to hurry
[1:57:30] deceive church by the word let me world
[1:57:32] by the world let me make sure there was
[1:57:33] nothing else i want to say about those
[1:57:35] oh yeah yeah i do i want to go back to
[1:57:37] that one more time real quick he said
[1:57:39] now
[1:57:40] yes oh
[1:57:41] oh the same spirit this spirit up here
[1:57:44] knows that he stays he just has a short
[1:57:46] time to work here he's about to be dealt
[1:57:48] with so he's calling out
[1:57:50] to another demon spirit for for help
[1:57:53] brother brown said for help
[1:57:55] calling out one to another
[1:57:57] for help
[1:57:59] and uh i love the next thing he says
[1:58:02] not every time but i love the next thing
[1:58:03] he says
[1:58:04] he just ran back and he said but that's
[1:58:06] all right
[1:58:08] because god is going to set you both
[1:58:10] free
[1:58:12] i like that
[1:58:14] i like that
[1:58:16] that bless is my blesser
[1:58:19] [Applause]
[1:58:21] here you are you defeated demon of
[1:58:23] disease you're calling out to try to get
[1:58:26] reinforcement but i'm here to tell you
[1:58:28] in the name of the lord
[1:58:30] god is about to deal with you both
[1:58:32] you're both going out both of you are
[1:58:34] going to know the healing that you've
[1:58:36] that you're standing in need uh look
[1:58:37] right back he says that right sir do you
[1:58:39] have such-and-such sir that's why you're
[1:58:41] here amen
[1:58:43] and let it be so amen and it was so
[1:58:46] it was so we forget some of these things
[1:58:49] we forget some of these things and we
[1:58:51] forget how spirits call out to one
[1:58:53] another and how they like to operate in
[1:58:55] groups and families and how they're all
[1:58:56] the time looking for sympathy
[1:58:58] demons are
[1:59:00] are really sympathy seekers
[1:59:02] but they're not really looking for i
[1:59:04] feel so sorry for you
[1:59:06] they're really looking for somebody
[1:59:07] that'll come over
[1:59:09] another spirit that'll come and
[1:59:10] strengthen them
[1:59:12] and hide them
[1:59:15] i'm not going into it this morning but
[1:59:16] one of the things we were dealing with
[1:59:18] in the spiritual this week
[1:59:20] mentioned it a little bit here tuesday
[1:59:21] night
[1:59:22] was what god later revealed to me was
[1:59:24] operating sort of like a trojan horse
[1:59:27] and you know what
[1:59:28] that is just like the enemy
[1:59:32] he will fool us into accepting
[1:59:36] let's just say this like this
[1:59:38] the the delivery
[1:59:42] because when we just had a young man
[1:59:44] here that had gotten a diagnosis from
[1:59:45] the doctor and
[1:59:47] we were all working on him trying to
[1:59:48] make sure that he didn't accept that
[1:59:50] diagnosis and that he didn't
[1:59:52] he was visiting with us and we didn't
[1:59:54] want him to say mine
[1:59:58] you say well that don't matter yeah i
[1:59:59] think it matters
[2:00:01] i don't think your problem should be
[2:00:02] your identity
[2:00:03] your identity should be found in jesus
[2:00:05] christ come on now you may suffer with
[2:00:09] migraines but they don't belong to you
[2:00:11] and so one of my daughters just spoke up
[2:00:13] and said what about that box of
[2:00:15] rattlesnakes
[2:00:17] remember what brother branham said about
[2:00:19] that box of rattlesnakes you can't take
[2:00:20] delivery
[2:00:23] you open the door of your home and take
[2:00:26] that delivery those become your
[2:00:27] rattlesnakes
[2:00:29] and the enemy comes like that
[2:00:31] you can't claim that now you can
[2:00:33] certainly do something about it i'm not
[2:00:35] saying that you shouldn't what i am
[2:00:37] saying is you can't claim that now as
[2:00:39] your new identity
[2:00:42] you've got brother branham told us he
[2:00:44] said you've got to refuse
[2:00:46] delivery
[2:00:49] he said well then the enemy will say
[2:00:51] well yes sir this does belong to you
[2:00:53] this package does belong to you said see
[2:00:55] right here your name is on the label
[2:00:58] and then you've got to raise up and say
[2:01:00] i don't care if my name is on the label
[2:01:05] my god said he would supply all of my
[2:01:08] needs according to his riches in glory
[2:01:11] my god said none of these diseases
[2:01:16] my god said that there is as much
[2:01:18] healing in the atonement as there is
[2:01:20] salvation so i'm going to claim that and
[2:01:23] i'm just saying right now uh return to
[2:01:26] sender
[2:01:29] you've got the right address
[2:01:31] you've got the right name
[2:01:33] but this is not the right delivery so i
[2:01:36] am sending this delivery right back to
[2:01:39] the address from which it's come
[2:01:41] and i refuse it in the name of the lord
[2:01:43] jesus christ i'm going to take god at
[2:01:45] his word so it doesn't matter how many
[2:01:47] demons march against you how many clump
[2:01:50] up against you
[2:01:52] to try to bring you under their
[2:01:54] influence afflict your body torment your
[2:01:57] mind
[2:01:58] cause you to be religious instead of
[2:01:59] sincere whatever the situation is i
[2:02:02] don't care how many march against you
[2:02:05] they do not have the power over you
[2:02:09] or the victory in your life unless you
[2:02:12] forfeit what's yours
[2:02:18] you drop the ball
[2:02:20] and they'll run it all the way home
[2:02:24] come on
[2:02:25] they'll get it all the way across the
[2:02:27] other end of the field if you drop the
[2:02:29] ball
[2:02:30] you cannot fumble the promises of god in
[2:02:32] your life you've got to hold on to them
[2:02:37] anybody listening
[2:02:38] you've got to hold on to them with
[2:02:40] everything you've got now here here is
[2:02:42] something i want to share as we move on
[2:02:44] a deceived church by the world
[2:02:46] remember
[2:02:47] we are not on a picnic this is a
[2:02:49] paragraph eight i believe
[2:02:53] hope i got it right
[2:02:55] we are not on a picnic
[2:02:57] but we're in a battlefield he just said
[2:02:59] that and here's another time saying it
[2:03:01] he said many people just think
[2:03:03] that when they become a christian
[2:03:06] that that's all they need to do
[2:03:11] the church has done a pretty poor job in
[2:03:13] helping us to understand it's a little
[2:03:15] more to it than just joining the church
[2:03:17] and shaking the preacher's hand
[2:03:19] you know the devil's not going to turn
[2:03:21] you loose because you've decided to
[2:03:23] spend your sundays
[2:03:25] somewhere else
[2:03:27] he's going to follow you all the way
[2:03:28] here
[2:03:29] he's going to sit down on the pew beside
[2:03:31] you he's going to call out to somebody
[2:03:33] else's demon
[2:03:35] that's right
[2:03:36] so you you just start thank you finish
[2:03:39] the
[2:03:39] battle the battle is just beginning he
[2:03:42] said just think
[2:03:43] many people just think that when they
[2:03:45] become a christian that's all they need
[2:03:46] to do that settles it forever as they
[2:03:49] are a christian and everything's going
[2:03:50] to come easy
[2:03:52] don't ever get that in your head
[2:03:54] that sounded vice isn't it let's read on
[2:03:58] for i become a christian to fight
[2:04:03] you you didn't become a christian to
[2:04:05] retire
[2:04:07] or for somebody else to do the fighting
[2:04:10] you became a christian he said aye
[2:04:12] this is his testimony i become a
[2:04:14] christian to fight fight the good fight
[2:04:17] of faith
[2:04:18] he said i'll become a christian to get
[2:04:19] in the battle lines
[2:04:22] now i found out what happens to us as we
[2:04:24] get a little bit uh complacent
[2:04:27] we start running away from the wars
[2:04:30] we start running away from the conflict
[2:04:33] and we know if we say certain things or
[2:04:35] do certain things we're going to stir up
[2:04:36] certain spirits and so we just try to
[2:04:39] dodge them
[2:04:40] well the sad thing is the more we dodge
[2:04:43] what's trying to take a hold of our life
[2:04:45] the stronger and more reinforcements are
[2:04:47] called in
[2:04:48] and the and the more helpless we become
[2:04:52] to overcome it in our own power we have
[2:04:54] to start reaching out for reinforcements
[2:04:56] of our own
[2:04:57] getting other believers to come with
[2:04:59] their faith and stand on the promise
[2:05:01] with us and listen folks there's no
[2:05:03] shame in that
[2:05:04] there's no shame in asking for help
[2:05:07] there's no shame in calling out for
[2:05:08] prayer but how many of you know there
[2:05:10] are some battles we got to win on our
[2:05:12] own with jesus we just got to do it with
[2:05:14] him we can't call a prayer partner every
[2:05:17] time we have a problem we have to learn
[2:05:19] the authority and the power that's been
[2:05:20] given to us in the name of jesus and we
[2:05:22] have to do something about it
[2:05:25] i don't want to hold you here too long
[2:05:26] if you have to slip out god bless you we
[2:05:28] understand completely but
[2:05:31] we're we're not ready to be done just
[2:05:32] yet don't ever get that in your head for
[2:05:36] i become a christian to fight the good
[2:05:37] fight of faith i become a christian to
[2:05:39] get in the battle lines we are christian
[2:05:41] soldiers and we got to be trained
[2:05:44] and brought up and know all the
[2:05:46] techniques of the enemy to know how to
[2:05:49] fortify to know how to fight the fight
[2:05:53] so that's for anybody here that would
[2:05:55] come along and say well we know we don't
[2:05:57] want there to be an emphasis on the
[2:05:59] demonic i don't want there to be an
[2:06:01] emphasis on the demonic either unless
[2:06:03] the holy spirit is emphasizing
[2:06:07] if the holy spirit is emphasizing there
[2:06:09] will be an emphasis
[2:06:10] and if the holy spirit is emphasizing
[2:06:13] for a while understanding how to deal
[2:06:14] with these things it's because we're
[2:06:16] being brought up and trained in the
[2:06:18] techniques of the enemy not so that we
[2:06:20] can get our eyes off of jesus
[2:06:23] but so we can appropriate every bit of
[2:06:26] the victory that he won for us at
[2:06:28] calvary
[2:06:29] it's got to be appropriated it's ours
[2:06:32] it's ours but you got to take it up
[2:06:35] and you've got to claim it as your own
[2:06:37] is that the truth it's the word it ought
[2:06:39] to be the truth he said we cannot take
[2:06:43] excuse me
[2:06:44] and we can only do that as the holy
[2:06:46] spirit will reveal it to us
[2:06:49] we cannot take what some other nation
[2:06:51] tells us when we go to war some of their
[2:06:53] ideas
[2:06:55] but we got to take our own ideas the way
[2:06:57] the holy spirit would direct us and what
[2:06:59] ideas he would give us because he is the
[2:07:01] commanding chief of the army of the
[2:07:03] christians is that all right with you
[2:07:06] come holy spirit and teach us
[2:07:08] how to win the daily victory over every
[2:07:12] demonic power
[2:07:14] you see the battle's on
[2:07:16] in the pool of bethesda he said but the
[2:07:18] battle is on right against wrong
[2:07:21] skepticism against the word of god faith
[2:07:24] against unbelief
[2:07:26] oh father may the angels of god wave
[2:07:28] their white flag the banners of the
[2:07:30] cross and may the holy spirit rise
[2:07:32] tonight may signs and wonders be done we
[2:07:34] give you all things believing them we
[2:07:37] believe we believe we believe
[2:07:39] in the christianity versus idolatry
[2:07:41] paragraph 79 that's right i'll be back
[2:07:44] with you in a minute i'm going to read
[2:07:45] for a while
[2:07:46] he said that's right you've got to know
[2:07:48] the word stay on the word see the great
[2:07:50] battle is at hand now we've played
[2:07:52] church for years and years but the hour
[2:07:54] has come now that when jabras and janice
[2:07:56] will withstand moses as the bible said
[2:07:58] they would and it's going to be a
[2:08:00] spiritual battle conflict
[2:08:02] there will be some just continue on the
[2:08:04] denominational church will just move
[2:08:06] right on into denomination and go on the
[2:08:08] way it goes but i mean the real true
[2:08:10] believer is coming to the battlefield
[2:08:12] that battlefield and you better be
[2:08:15] versed and know what you're doing or you
[2:08:17] could take an evil spirit so easy and
[2:08:20] not know
[2:08:21] if it's contrary to this word don't
[2:08:23] believe it stay with the word
[2:08:25] now wait a minute somebody said how can
[2:08:27] a believer take an evil spirit
[2:08:30] because some evil spirits operate in the
[2:08:32] physical and some operate in the
[2:08:34] spiritual
[2:08:35] if they operate in the physical they can
[2:08:37] cross the barrier
[2:08:39] and you have got to raise up then
[2:08:42] and and instead of spending all your
[2:08:44] time trying to figure out how it got in
[2:08:46] like the charismatics want us to do
[2:08:49] we need to first deal with the spirit
[2:08:51] that's present deal with the life that's
[2:08:52] there get that thing out
[2:08:55] amen
[2:08:56] then we've got to seal the house
[2:08:59] then we got to get it filled with the
[2:09:00] holy ghost and fire
[2:09:02] and some were testifying recently of a
[2:09:05] refilling of the holy ghost about a week
[2:09:07] ago or two weeks ago i want to ask you
[2:09:09] what's wrong with you today
[2:09:11] don't you need another refilling today
[2:09:15] that's what i saw that's what i saw i
[2:09:19] saw some walking down this way this
[2:09:21] morning to praise without being
[2:09:23] encouraged to do so
[2:09:25] and what they were doing is pulling
[2:09:27] themselves right up
[2:09:29] and saying lord thank you for the feast
[2:09:32] oh you blessed me so good but i need
[2:09:35] another one
[2:09:36] you fill me up so good but i need to be
[2:09:38] filled again
[2:09:40] it's
[2:09:41] freedom is a choice
[2:09:47] what were they doing they were saying
[2:09:48] i'm choosing freedom today i'm choosing
[2:09:50] to get under that atmosphere and see
[2:09:52] what god will do because only god knows
[2:09:55] what monday holds
[2:09:58] how many do i have to be plain to tell
[2:10:00] you
[2:10:01] that your life can spin around
[2:10:04] in five minutes and you wouldn't
[2:10:05] recognize it
[2:10:07] how many have ever been in that kind of
[2:10:09] we we've experienced it
[2:10:11] one phone call can change your life
[2:10:14] one hardship
[2:10:19] i remember the night my mother's life
[2:10:21] was changed forever
[2:10:24] i was going through a terrible divorce
[2:10:28] i was just a small boy five years old
[2:10:32] there are so many things
[2:10:34] that i didn't know then that i now know
[2:10:36] because i
[2:10:37] possess and hold the papers
[2:10:40] i've read things about my own life that
[2:10:42] i didn't know
[2:10:44] and the conflict that i didn't know
[2:10:45] anything about
[2:10:47] and just as that battle was raging
[2:10:49] we had just got home from panama city
[2:10:51] florida friends of ours owned a motel
[2:10:54] there i found the motel online
[2:10:57] it's no longer of course in the same
[2:10:59] hands that it used to be in but part of
[2:11:01] that motel remains today i'm going to go
[2:11:03] see it one day i
[2:11:05] won't stay there
[2:11:08] but i'm going to go see it one day
[2:11:09] because i have wonderful memories in
[2:11:12] that little motel
[2:11:14] of the family that owned it we had had a
[2:11:16] wonderful week my grandparents had taken
[2:11:19] my mother and i to the beach for a
[2:11:21] little getaway because of what all she
[2:11:23] was going through
[2:11:25] and we got home
[2:11:27] and
[2:11:28] got in our vehicle and drove to our home
[2:11:31] on emerson avenue
[2:11:33] in
[2:11:34] columbus
[2:11:35] out by a fort
[2:11:38] high school junior high school whatever
[2:11:40] it is out over in columbus that part of
[2:11:42] columbus
[2:11:44] and i dozed off to sleep
[2:11:46] and the phone rang and my mother
[2:11:48] screamed i could hear almost in my mind
[2:11:50] you've had those kind of things that get
[2:11:51] pressed in your memory i can almost hear
[2:11:53] her scream now
[2:11:55] and my grandfather that we had just
[2:11:56] spent a wonderful week
[2:11:58] of vacationing at the beach and he had
[2:12:00] treated us so wonderful
[2:12:02] and had had such a good time himself
[2:12:05] had had died on the way to the hospital
[2:12:07] with a massive heart attack
[2:12:10] and i got up out of the bed as a
[2:12:12] five-year-old boy and went and helped
[2:12:14] pull my mother off the floor her life
[2:12:17] my life
[2:12:18] but her life was forever changed with
[2:12:21] one phone call without any warning
[2:12:28] we didn't even know that we had not even
[2:12:30] pulled out of the driveway
[2:12:32] before chest pain started and he began
[2:12:34] to take the nitro and do the things that
[2:12:36] he would normally do
[2:12:38] and as it got a little worse the
[2:12:40] ambulance was called
[2:12:42] and he was still alive when they put him
[2:12:43] in the ambulance but but dead on arrival
[2:12:46] at martin army hospital i didn't have to
[2:12:49] bring that up to give you an example but
[2:12:51] you have your own memories and your own
[2:12:54] examples how things can be rocking on
[2:12:57] okay maybe not good but okay
[2:13:00] and then all of a sudden one thing can
[2:13:02] shift like that you don't ever know when
[2:13:04] you're gonna need the victory that you
[2:13:06] asked for this morning
[2:13:08] you don't ever know when you're gonna
[2:13:10] need to make a withdrawal on the grace
[2:13:11] account that you've been building up
[2:13:13] this morning i'm telling you when you
[2:13:16] come into the presence of god and begin
[2:13:18] to worship him and call on his name and
[2:13:21] lift him up you may not understand that
[2:13:25] you're building up reserves
[2:13:28] you're putting yourself in an atmosphere
[2:13:31] and whether you know it or not the cells
[2:13:33] of your body are becoming charged with
[2:13:36] the glory presence of god you may not
[2:13:38] know what's happening in your liver
[2:13:41] you may not know what's happening in
[2:13:43] your kidney you may not know what's
[2:13:45] happening in the physical realm you may
[2:13:47] not be fully aware of what's happening
[2:13:49] in the spiritual realm but god doesn't
[2:13:52] bless you just to bless you
[2:13:55] he blesses you because he is equipping
[2:13:58] you and preparing you and strengthening
[2:14:01] you and keeping his word in your life
[2:14:05] and so any sweat
[2:14:08] any sacrifice
[2:14:10] any effort that you put forth as you
[2:14:13] have these last few weeks
[2:14:15] to come into his presence
[2:14:17] in worship
[2:14:19] it's so worth it
[2:14:22] you may not know now how worth it how
[2:14:24] valuable
[2:14:26] how costly
[2:14:28] it is
[2:14:30] sister tebow at home this morning
[2:14:33] after having this procedure
[2:14:36] biopsy
[2:14:38] and kind of serious
[2:14:41] waiting on some results
[2:14:43] just making sure her strength is there
[2:14:45] and whatever to be back in church
[2:14:47] i glanced down a few moments ago
[2:14:50] before i came to the pulpit
[2:14:52] and she was commenting on the service as
[2:14:55] she was streaming it from her house talk
[2:14:57] about what an atmosphere what a blessing
[2:14:59] the service was to her
[2:15:02] so you don't know that by creating some
[2:15:04] time and atmosphere in here we're
[2:15:06] sending that same kind of presence out
[2:15:09] into the airwaves to encourage to
[2:15:12] strengthen
[2:15:14] i thought about brother dwayne this week
[2:15:16] and what they're going through
[2:15:18] personally and his obedience in the
[2:15:21] meeting here a couple weeks ago so i i
[2:15:23] knew that he sometimes will catch the
[2:15:26] service go back and catch the service
[2:15:28] but i didn't know if he would when he
[2:15:30] saw how long it was
[2:15:32] and so i sent him a place i wanted him
[2:15:34] to go
[2:15:35] i sent him a number and i wanted him to
[2:15:37] go there i wanted him to see how
[2:15:40] spiritual things can be fought i wanted
[2:15:43] him to understand that we were still
[2:15:45] enjoying the fruit of his obedience here
[2:15:48] and the ministry that he brought with
[2:15:50] him and i've been kind of feasting on
[2:15:53] that atmosphere from last sunday all
[2:15:55] week
[2:15:57] and i've been sharing it with different
[2:15:59] ones who had not yet had an opportunity
[2:16:02] to be under that anointing because i
[2:16:05] know
[2:16:06] that the anointing of god can take care
[2:16:10] of every problem
[2:16:13] every situation
[2:16:15] are you still with me so how can a
[2:16:17] believer pick up a spirit like that if
[2:16:19] he's if he's holy ghost filled if he's
[2:16:22] because these spirits don't all operate
[2:16:24] in the same realm some physical
[2:16:26] some
[2:16:27] spiritual and and in the in the teaching
[2:16:30] on demonology brother brandon comes
[2:16:32] along and he says and the worst of all
[2:16:37] the worst of all
[2:16:38] in the religious realm
[2:16:40] in the religious sphere
[2:16:42] and it talks about how the pharisees
[2:16:44] were strengthened in their religion not
[2:16:46] even knowing they were under the
[2:16:47] inspiration
[2:16:48] of demon spirits
[2:16:50] until jesus had to turn and tell him
[2:16:52] you're of your father the devil the most
[2:16:54] religious men in the whole in the whole
[2:16:56] community the leaders of the law
[2:16:59] and here jesus had to tell them your
[2:17:01] identity is not from from above
[2:17:04] your identity is of the serpent
[2:17:09] you're of a different seed
[2:17:11] you may be religious you may wear the
[2:17:13] uniform
[2:17:14] but you are carrying the wrong seed
[2:17:17] you're carrying a wrong spirit and it
[2:17:20] took the son of god to be able to reveal
[2:17:22] that and expose that and brother branham
[2:17:25] said so that realm the religious realm
[2:17:28] is even more awful
[2:17:29] than when a spirit breaks through in the
[2:17:31] physical realm or when it breaks through
[2:17:33] in the spiritual realm
[2:17:35] i saw some things this week as i was
[2:17:37] praying and
[2:17:38] praying for our brother steve and
[2:17:40] praying for different needs and
[2:17:41] different situations and so that's what
[2:17:43] kind of provoked me to start doing these
[2:17:45] studies and and brother branham which
[2:17:47] would call out he said these germ
[2:17:49] diseases
[2:17:51] these diseases that come on by germs
[2:17:54] and are contagious in nature
[2:17:58] like tuberculosis
[2:18:00] he said well i i guarantee you that has
[2:18:03] a life
[2:18:04] and he said i guarantee you that's a
[2:18:06] demon
[2:18:07] and that's demonic
[2:18:09] and when he's making the list of things
[2:18:11] he mentions cancer and tumor and he
[2:18:13] mentions
[2:18:14] and the reason why i believe he
[2:18:16] differentiated between cancer and tumor
[2:18:18] is because even a benign tumor has life
[2:18:20] in it
[2:18:21] it has cells in it living cells in it
[2:18:24] and so he said cancer and he said tumor
[2:18:26] he said epilepsy because he was talking
[2:18:28] about diseases that were more prevalent
[2:18:31] in his day
[2:18:32] and he said tuberculosis and he said in
[2:18:34] fact germ diseases
[2:18:36] he put him in a bigger category diseases
[2:18:38] that are caused by germs all disease
[2:18:40] doesn't come that way but some do and
[2:18:43] that germ could be both viral and
[2:18:45] bacterial
[2:18:46] every bit of it having a spirit behind
[2:18:48] it and has to be dealt with and so there
[2:18:50] were many people receiving prayer in
[2:18:52] their local church
[2:18:54] for a healing
[2:18:56] when more than a healing was needed
[2:18:59] there needed to be a deliverance
[2:19:01] somebody needed to take authority over
[2:19:04] the life
[2:19:05] be the oppressing demon spirit that had
[2:19:08] broken through to the physical
[2:19:10] and had been able to afflict the body of
[2:19:12] a child of god
[2:19:15] brother branham's going along and he
[2:19:16] even mentions cataract
[2:19:18] things that i would never think of
[2:19:20] having any life or connection like that
[2:19:23] but in the same manner of growth and he
[2:19:25] said it had to be dealt with accordingly
[2:19:27] now that might make some people a little
[2:19:29] aggravated or a little mad or upset if
[2:19:31] they've dealt with some of these things
[2:19:33] but hey
[2:19:34] he's giving us an idea
[2:19:37] of how to deal with the enemy of how to
[2:19:40] cut him off
[2:19:42] because your victory over the enemy is
[2:19:43] your choice
[2:19:44] it's there it's available to you but you
[2:19:47] have to make the choice are you still
[2:19:49] with me
[2:19:50] all right here i want to close in a
[2:19:51] minute or two
[2:19:56] thank you but i've got a long one here
[2:19:58] so you ready
[2:19:59] this is so good
[2:20:01] go tell a message go tell
[2:20:05] paragraph 80.
[2:20:07] oh my goodness there's one phrase in
[2:20:08] here that blesses my blesser
[2:20:13] he said as we continue a moment with the
[2:20:16] slaves
[2:20:17] and our thought
[2:20:20] there was a proclamation
[2:20:23] emancipation of the proclamation that
[2:20:26] was signed
[2:20:28] and the slaves was going to be free upon
[2:20:30] a certain day
[2:20:32] he said you don't know oh if you've
[2:20:33] never met christ
[2:20:35] you never know what that mean meant
[2:20:38] to them slaves
[2:20:41] he is drawing a parallel between slavery
[2:20:44] in the natural
[2:20:46] and slavery in the spiritual
[2:20:48] didn't we sing this morning i'm no
[2:20:50] longer a slave to fear
[2:20:53] there is a parallel
[2:20:56] the slave had a task master
[2:20:59] driving his work
[2:21:01] forcing him to the grind wheel
[2:21:04] whipping him unmercifully at times
[2:21:07] to force him to do something that this
[2:21:10] man felt like he had bought him to do
[2:21:12] how horrendous
[2:21:14] how horrible
[2:21:16] to think about
[2:21:18] a person being treated like a possession
[2:21:23] instead of a human being we cannot
[2:21:26] change history but we must not become
[2:21:28] victim to that
[2:21:30] ever again
[2:21:32] we must call it what it is
[2:21:34] be bold about it
[2:21:37] amen
[2:21:38] it's nearly impossible for a generation
[2:21:40] this far removed to do everything that
[2:21:43] would be expected to make it right
[2:21:46] so we have to somehow depend on the
[2:21:48] mercy and grace of god
[2:21:50] and understand that even the horrible
[2:21:53] things that have happened to the jewish
[2:21:54] people
[2:21:55] and horrible atrocities that have
[2:21:58] happened to mankind through the years
[2:22:00] have happened for a reason
[2:22:03] they're horrible they're awful
[2:22:06] unmentionable
[2:22:07] but god is ultimately good
[2:22:10] and he has only allowed things for his
[2:22:12] purposes i'm really just giving you what
[2:22:15] the scripture says
[2:22:16] it's hard sometimes as human beings to
[2:22:18] filter that through our understanding
[2:22:20] but it is what the word said so let me
[2:22:22] read on he said you you
[2:22:24] you don't know oh if you're never met
[2:22:26] christ what it meant to them slaves
[2:22:29] when it went the message
[2:22:31] throughout the land
[2:22:32] that you're going to be free on such and
[2:22:34] such a day at daylight you're going to
[2:22:36] be free you'll not have to wear you'll
[2:22:39] oh this is part of what i like
[2:22:42] you'll not have to wear slave belts
[2:22:45] anymore
[2:22:47] neither will you get any more whippings
[2:22:50] whoa
[2:22:51] let's read on
[2:22:52] but you are free
[2:22:54] you're a citizen of this great united
[2:22:57] states you are not no more a slave after
[2:23:00] daylight on a certain certain morning oh
[2:23:03] with great anticipations they waited
[2:23:06] if the sinner could only see that if the
[2:23:08] sinner would only hear the true gospel
[2:23:13] not the joining of his church but the
[2:23:16] preaching of the gospel that you can be
[2:23:18] free from sin that you can be free from
[2:23:21] your sickness
[2:23:23] at a certain certain time
[2:23:25] that's the time that you believe
[2:23:29] you know those slaves were so excited
[2:23:31] and under such anticipation waiting for
[2:23:34] the hour that they would be free until
[2:23:36] they tell me they gathered at the bottom
[2:23:38] of the hill mothers and little children
[2:23:40] all gathered and some of the old they
[2:23:43] climbed up on the top of the hill around
[2:23:45] midnight
[2:23:46] no smart phones no walkie-talkies
[2:23:51] no telegraphs
[2:23:54] they climbed up on the mountain they
[2:23:56] knowed when the day break and the sun
[2:23:58] come up that they would be free it
[2:24:01] wouldn't take over one half of a minute
[2:24:03] to shine the sun from the top of the
[2:24:05] hill but some of them was up on the top
[2:24:07] of the hill watching watching you hear
[2:24:09] the point he's making it wouldn't have
[2:24:11] taken them long to figure out down at
[2:24:12] the bottom of the hill that the sun was
[2:24:14] coming up
[2:24:15] that just ain't good enough let me tell
[2:24:17] you something there's a handful of
[2:24:19] people in this church that that would
[2:24:21] never be good enough
[2:24:28] i don't want to know it when everybody
[2:24:30] else knows it
[2:24:33] [Music]
[2:24:35] god didn't call me to follow the trend
[2:24:38] he called me to be on the razor edge
[2:24:42] he called me to be a forerunner
[2:24:46] i'm talking about you
[2:24:48] not me
[2:24:49] me too
[2:24:51] but i'm talking about you
[2:24:53] there's some of us that were never
[2:24:55] waited at the bottom of that hill
[2:24:58] we'd have done everything we could
[2:24:59] within our power to get up to the top of
[2:25:02] the hill to be one of the first that saw
[2:25:04] the sun come up because we wanted to be
[2:25:06] one of those that hollered back down
[2:25:09] [Music]
[2:25:11] god's just looking for somebody today
[2:25:13] who'll be a forerunner who'll take him
[2:25:15] at his word
[2:25:17] who'll deal with this stuff in the name
[2:25:19] of the lord jesus christ oh yes
[2:25:23] it wouldn't take over half a minute to
[2:25:24] shine the sun from the top of the hill
[2:25:26] but some of them was up on the top of
[2:25:27] the hill watching watching oh when the
[2:25:29] sun rises we are free that was the the
[2:25:32] s-u-n
[2:25:34] that was the s-u-n that was the flaming
[2:25:37] ball of light
[2:25:38] but when s-o-n rises
[2:25:43] i got good news for you
[2:25:46] the s-o-n has risen
[2:25:49] oh the sun has risen
[2:25:52] one of these days when the sun rose some
[2:25:54] 1900 years ago he broke oh my my my
[2:25:59] my my
[2:26:00] my my my my
[2:26:04] you want to sit around here my complex
[2:26:11] my issues
[2:26:13] from my childhood
[2:26:17] my migraine
[2:26:23] i just remembered another disease that
[2:26:24] brother branham mentioned about the
[2:26:26] demonic breaking through in the physical
[2:26:27] realm arthritis
[2:26:33] my arthritis
[2:26:37] my troubled children
[2:26:43] you want to sit around here and talk
[2:26:45] like that
[2:26:47] don't you know the sun is risen
[2:26:51] it doesn't matter what's going on around
[2:26:53] you really
[2:26:55] it doesn't matter if anybody's here to
[2:26:57] celebrate the victory with you or not
[2:27:00] this is not about you in the corporate
[2:27:02] body
[2:27:03] this is about you and the s-o-n
[2:27:07] i'm here to tell you today the s-o-n has
[2:27:11] risen
[2:27:13] and he has
[2:27:15] every slave belt in your life
[2:27:20] if you're wearing the slave belt today
[2:27:24] you're wearing it by choice
[2:27:29] you're beating the pool yes i am
[2:27:32] and i better tell my watch i'm all right
[2:27:40] well we don't want 9-1-1 to show up
[2:27:45] if you're wearing a sleigh belt today
[2:27:48] you are choosing to keep that on
[2:27:52] it really has no power over you you
[2:27:55] daughter of zion
[2:27:58] the yoke that you decorate your neck
[2:28:01] with is not a yoke to hold you anymore
[2:28:04] because we read in god's word that yoke
[2:28:06] was already broken because of the
[2:28:09] anointing you wear it like a chain you
[2:28:12] wear it like jewelry around your neck
[2:28:14] you wear it because slavery has become
[2:28:17] your identity
[2:28:18] [Music]
[2:28:22] you're afraid
[2:28:23] there are people who are afraid to learn
[2:28:26] what it means to live in freedom
[2:28:29] they're afraid that they might have to
[2:28:31] learn to look at things differently
[2:28:34] because when you're wearing a slave belt
[2:28:36] you look at everything like a slave
[2:28:38] oh i wish somebody was preaching to me
[2:28:42] i believe i could do a better amen job
[2:28:44] than some of you are doing this morning
[2:28:46] if i was sitting where you're sitting
[2:28:48] because it's the truth and nothing but
[2:28:51] the truth
[2:28:52] that slave belt is nothing but a
[2:28:54] reminder
[2:28:56] of where you were
[2:28:58] it is no longer a thermostat of where
[2:29:00] you are
[2:29:02] because the s-o-n
[2:29:06] the s-o-n has risen and he has taken
[2:29:09] away broke every slave belt he's taken
[2:29:13] that bond from around our neck and if
[2:29:16] it's hanging if we're wearing it it's
[2:29:17] just hanging there the chains are gone
[2:29:21] isn't that what we found out
[2:29:23] the lord is coming to this broken
[2:29:25] daughter of zion and he says to her eyes
[2:29:29] and she says what do you mean arise i've
[2:29:31] been laying here just like i was beaten
[2:29:34] down
[2:29:35] bloody and bruised and broken with this
[2:29:38] shackle around my neck
[2:29:40] what do you mean to rise and shine
[2:29:43] what do you mean get up
[2:29:45] and the truth was revealed
[2:29:48] it's no more than a cage
[2:29:50] the mirage
[2:29:52] of a cage
[2:29:53] i'm preaching
[2:29:56] it's no more than the mirage of a cage
[2:29:59] that used to trap you
[2:30:01] in a 12-foot shuffle but you don't have
[2:30:04] to be there anymore because the s-o-n
[2:30:08] has risen jesus has broke every slave
[2:30:11] belt jesus has broken every bar
[2:30:15] come on brother sister why don't you
[2:30:17] give him some praise
[2:30:18] [Music]
[2:30:20] jesus
[2:30:21] [Music]
[2:30:22] [Applause]
[2:30:24] jesus
[2:30:27] you're worthy
[2:30:31] you're worthy
[2:30:33] [Applause]
[2:30:37] hallelujah
[2:30:39] [Applause]
[2:30:41] [Music]
[2:30:43] [Applause]
[2:30:46] don't you stand there and think uh he's
[2:30:48] just trying to work us out
[2:30:51] if a believer has to be worked up to
[2:30:54] praise god something's wrong with the
[2:30:56] believer
[2:30:57] [Applause]
[2:30:59] i'm just trying to encourage you
[2:31:02] that you're sitting under something
[2:31:03] that's just a mirage
[2:31:05] let's be seated a moment
[2:31:09] he broke every sleigh belt
[2:31:11] he set every captive free
[2:31:15] he healed every sickness
[2:31:20] he gave freedom to those
[2:31:22] who are in bondage
[2:31:25] how we ought to climb and watch
[2:31:32] get to the top of the mountain so you
[2:31:35] can see that the sun is risen
[2:31:38] how we ought to climb and watch let me
[2:31:39] read on a moment and when the sun peeped
[2:31:42] up
[2:31:44] first the man was at the highest saw it
[2:31:48] and he shouted down to the next man we
[2:31:51] are
[2:31:53] free
[2:32:04] someone on youtube said
[2:32:06] why are those people running around the
[2:32:08] church
[2:32:14] we're not insinuating that you have to
[2:32:16] do that
[2:32:19] you do you
[2:32:21] come on
[2:32:24] we know cultures are different
[2:32:30] finland
[2:32:32] some of the believers from scandinavia
[2:32:35] they almost miss their visitation
[2:32:41] because brother branham believed in foot
[2:32:43] washing
[2:32:48] and the ministerial association
[2:32:52] didn't want a preacher coming in who
[2:32:54] believed in foot washing
[2:33:00] he believed that you take communion you
[2:33:01] wash the saints feet you get up and
[2:33:03] praise god and go on your way jesus set
[2:33:06] the example it's not it's not some
[2:33:08] salvation ritual it's not some it's you
[2:33:11] know it's it's not a
[2:33:13] i would call it an ordinance but i
[2:33:15] wouldn't necessarily
[2:33:16] believe that it was a salvation issue
[2:33:20] and brother branham sent word through
[2:33:22] the managers
[2:33:24] and said
[2:33:25] i don't preach about foot washing
[2:33:27] everywhere i go
[2:33:30] i might make a mention of jesus washing
[2:33:33] the disciples feet or
[2:33:35] in my tabernacle i have said that the
[2:33:38] lord's supper shouldn't be taken without
[2:33:40] the finishing without the rest of what
[2:33:41] happened there but but he said i
[2:33:43] wouldn't go around the world saying
[2:33:45] things like that particularly
[2:33:47] well we're we're a cold country
[2:33:54] we're a coal country and we can't
[2:33:56] imagine putting our bare feet
[2:34:00] in cold water
[2:34:03] and then
[2:34:04] the manager said well it could be hot
[2:34:06] water but we're not pushing for foot
[2:34:08] washing
[2:34:10] we don't do foot washing services out on
[2:34:12] the
[2:34:12] on the healing trail
[2:34:19] we just feel like it's undignified
[2:34:22] to expect people to
[2:34:24] unrope their feet
[2:34:28] and have them washed in church and dried
[2:34:31] and
[2:34:32] put their socks and shoes back on and so
[2:34:34] you know what it was it had nothing to
[2:34:36] do with foot washing
[2:34:39] they almost missed their opportunity to
[2:34:42] have their sick heels
[2:34:45] [Applause]
[2:34:50] and yet over here in america mennonites
[2:34:53] were coming catholics were coming
[2:34:56] episcopalians were coming
[2:34:58] lutherans were coming come on they came
[2:35:01] from every denomination
[2:35:04] now the pastors didn't necessarily
[2:35:07] encourage it
[2:35:08] but people wanted to be healed they
[2:35:11] wanted to be delivered and they weren't
[2:35:14] going to let some pentecostal doctrine
[2:35:16] keep them from coming and getting the
[2:35:17] blessing of god how stupid of us that's
[2:35:20] rough talk isn't it how stupid of us to
[2:35:22] let some little something like that
[2:35:24] almost cause us to miss our day of
[2:35:27] visitation well he told me to praise the
[2:35:29] lord he told me why don't you raise your
[2:35:31] hand and praise the lord and i just
[2:35:33] don't like to be told what to do and
[2:35:35] this and that and the other and all the
[2:35:36] excuses that people make oh my let it go
[2:35:41] let it go let it go let it go
[2:35:44] let it go let all of it go turn loose of
[2:35:47] it and let it all go and get a hold of
[2:35:50] jesus today
[2:35:52] get a hold of him and don't let him go
[2:35:55] we're free
[2:35:57] the next man shouted to the man farther
[2:35:59] down the hill until it come to the camp
[2:36:01] we are free for the sun was arising they
[2:36:04] were waiting waiting waiting for that
[2:36:06] hour
[2:36:07] how much more
[2:36:09] last paragraph
[2:36:11] how much more are we to be waiting today
[2:36:14] for the son of god we are free from sin
[2:36:17] we are free from the shackles we are
[2:36:20] free from habits
[2:36:22] we are free from smoking and dancing and
[2:36:24] carousing because the son of god has
[2:36:28] raised from the grave and has broke
[2:36:32] every
[2:36:33] fetter
[2:36:34] [Music]
[2:36:36] hallelujah
[2:36:38] yeah
[2:36:40] look at the next phrase
[2:36:42] give me the oh
[2:36:45] condemnation
[2:36:48] say it again sister beth is what
[2:36:51] god
[2:36:53] the debt has been paid
[2:36:56] the penalty is paid you want me to come
[2:36:59] in here and fold my hands
[2:37:02] and act like some dignified somebody
[2:37:07] when i found out my slave belt is broken
[2:37:11] my fetters are gone my habits are dealt
[2:37:14] with i'm under no condemnation my
[2:37:17] penalty has been paid my sins are washed
[2:37:20] away and we are free
[2:37:22] [Music]
[2:37:25] we are free
[2:37:27] people
[2:37:29] slavery
[2:37:31] he said freedom
[2:37:32] when the son of god rises
[2:37:35] with healing in his wings
[2:37:38] freedom involves a choice that we must
[2:37:41] make
[2:37:42] we know the price is paid we know
[2:37:44] deliverance is ours we know that satan
[2:37:46] has ultimately been dealt with by the
[2:37:48] death and the and the shedding of blood
[2:37:51] and the resurrection of our lord jesus
[2:37:53] christ but we have to keep choosing
[2:37:57] to live like those who are not under the
[2:37:58] slave belt
[2:38:00] we have to keep choosing to live
[2:38:02] differently than those who are under the
[2:38:04] whip
[2:38:05] come on
[2:38:07] driven in life
[2:38:08] we're free from that
[2:38:10] it's a choice does anybody not
[2:38:12] understand what i mean when i say
[2:38:14] freedom is a choice
[2:38:21] we need to choose that
[2:38:23] before we go home today
[2:38:26] and we need to choose that before we get
[2:38:28] up in the morning
[2:38:29] and face this
[2:38:31] evil hour
[2:38:32] we might need to choose that before we
[2:38:34] go to bed tomorrow night because a lot
[2:38:36] can happen in a day
[2:38:38] and we might have to choose that every
[2:38:39] day we might have to keep choosing that
[2:38:41] because guess what those thoughts are
[2:38:43] going to keep coming against the
[2:38:44] accusations of hell are going to keep
[2:38:46] coming again and so we're going to have
[2:38:48] to say wait a minute am i going to live
[2:38:50] look folks
[2:38:52] there's different kinds of people and
[2:38:53] i'm closing
[2:38:55] there's different kinds of people
[2:38:57] there are some people when they're
[2:38:59] fasting they want you to know their
[2:39:01] fasting
[2:39:04] bible said so
[2:39:07] that like the pharisees and sadducees of
[2:39:09] the day of jesus
[2:39:10] they would get up in the morning
[2:39:13] and walk around all day with bed head
[2:39:19] wouldn't even comb their hair
[2:39:25] i see people like that all the time
[2:39:27] reckon they're fasting
[2:39:34] i go to walmart on occasion once a year
[2:39:37] i see people walking around in their
[2:39:39] pajamas
[2:39:41] i do
[2:39:43] never never
[2:39:45] combed a hair
[2:39:47] never brushed a tooth
[2:39:50] they just showed up i don't understand
[2:39:52] it
[2:39:54] i have
[2:39:55] i have even seen people walk around with
[2:39:57] a comb in their hair
[2:40:00] and i'm thinking come over here honey
[2:40:02] let me just show you what that's for
[2:40:06] they want everybody to know that they
[2:40:08] don't they're just you know society just
[2:40:12] no hold on me
[2:40:14] i don't have to fit the mold
[2:40:16] if i want to walk around and look like a
[2:40:17] zombie i will don't you say nothing
[2:40:19] about it there's just people like that
[2:40:22] there's christian religious people like
[2:40:24] that too if they're fasting they want
[2:40:26] everybody to know no i'm fasting
[2:40:28] [Music]
[2:40:32] let's go to lunch no
[2:40:37] i'm fasting this week
[2:40:40] the bible said not to act like that
[2:40:42] when you're fasting you should get up
[2:40:44] wash your face comb your hair
[2:40:47] put on some smell good
[2:40:51] go live your life in it right
[2:40:54] right so you're not drawing attention to
[2:40:56] yourself
[2:40:58] and there's going to be times that you
[2:40:59] getting about in a bad spot and you have
[2:41:01] to you have to say to another believer
[2:41:03] i'm not eating
[2:41:06] and of course then you have to deal with
[2:41:07] folks like us
[2:41:09] who aren't used to fasting people so
[2:41:11] much
[2:41:13] and the next question my wife is going
[2:41:15] to ask are you sick
[2:41:19] do we need to pray for you
[2:41:22] that just recently happened i said to my
[2:41:23] wife i said no they're fasting
[2:41:29] we just want people you know we just
[2:41:32] love equals food you know and we we love
[2:41:34] you and we think you ought to be eating
[2:41:36] that's what granny taught us anyway
[2:41:39] there are people like that they're just
[2:41:41] built that way and they want everybody
[2:41:43] to know when they're going through a
[2:41:44] battle
[2:41:49] when they're depressed they want
[2:41:50] everybody to know they're depressed
[2:41:53] i see sisters sometimes with their hair
[2:41:55] hanging down in their face
[2:41:58] and i know that they're sending a
[2:42:00] message
[2:42:01] to the whole world
[2:42:04] how rough life is
[2:42:06] i see it
[2:42:09] i see people sometime the way they
[2:42:11] present themselves
[2:42:12] and i realize they're just wanting
[2:42:14] somebody to notice
[2:42:21] that they're having a hard time
[2:42:24] and then there are other folks
[2:42:27] who would rather nobody know
[2:42:34] so when they're down like i said a while
[2:42:37] ago they they just find a smile
[2:42:41] you ever had to do it hold up your hand
[2:42:44] you just have to find one well in that
[2:42:46] being a hypocrite no it's being a leader
[2:42:50] you're just being a leader
[2:42:52] you're just being example to one another
[2:42:54] there's going to be times that you don't
[2:42:56] feel like smiling and you have to smile
[2:42:58] anyway
[2:42:59] come on now
[2:43:02] you just have to because you're not just
[2:43:04] representing your stuff you're
[2:43:06] representing a kingdom
[2:43:08] that's not shaken by the politics of the
[2:43:10] united states of america
[2:43:12] you're representing a kingdom now there
[2:43:14] are going to be times that you've got to
[2:43:15] have prayer
[2:43:17] and so you're going to say hey come here
[2:43:20] there's going to be times that instead
[2:43:22] of staying at home you're going to limp
[2:43:23] to church
[2:43:25] and you're not going to do that because
[2:43:26] you want attention you're going to do
[2:43:27] that because you know it's much much
[2:43:30] much better
[2:43:32] to limp your way to god's house than to
[2:43:36] let a limp keep you from coming
[2:43:38] that's not what i'm talking about
[2:43:40] i'm talking about people who find some
[2:43:43] kind of sense of belonging
[2:43:47] by sending this message
[2:43:49] my life is hardly worth living
[2:43:53] but i want you to know something
[2:43:56] if that is the motto and theme of your
[2:43:58] life you've got a sleigh belt on
[2:44:03] you may blame the devil for putting it
[2:44:05] there but you have no one to blame but
[2:44:07] yourself for leaving it there because
[2:44:10] the s-o-n has risen
[2:44:11] [Applause]
[2:44:12] [Music]
[2:44:14] there's not a demon in hell that the
[2:44:15] blood of jesus can drive from your life
[2:44:18] there's not a power of darkness or
[2:44:20] spiritual wickedness in high places it
[2:44:23] can't be dealt with the weapon of the
[2:44:25] name of jesus christ lord jesus christ
[2:44:31] there's not a disease there's not a
[2:44:33] situation there's not a hardship there's
[2:44:35] not a complex there's not an insecurity
[2:44:38] that can be dealt with by the truth of
[2:44:41] god's word
[2:44:42] freedom musicians are coming freedom
[2:44:48] is a choice
[2:44:51] how can you say so because it's done
[2:44:54] the price is paid
[2:44:56] i want to say one more time if you're
[2:44:57] fighting a battle this morning the
[2:44:59] reason why we're fighting a battle is
[2:45:02] we're fighting to show up
[2:45:04] we're fighting to show up we're fighting
[2:45:07] to stand up and say god is good
[2:45:13] you see if the enemy can cause you to
[2:45:14] doubt that god is good
[2:45:20] he'll introduce death into the situation
[2:45:22] just like he did in the garden of eden i
[2:45:25] want to tell the world god is good oh
[2:45:28] he's so good he's so good he's so good
[2:45:32] he's so good and he loves you so much
[2:45:35] he loves you so much
[2:45:37] he paid a price and if you'd have been
[2:45:38] the only one the old timers used to say
[2:45:40] and i believe if you'd have been the
[2:45:42] only one
[2:45:43] he'd died for you he'd have went all the
[2:45:45] way to the cross for you he just shed
[2:45:47] his precious blood for you
[2:45:49] he would have never tried to get out of
[2:45:51] it and said oh look there's just one who
[2:45:52] just one who showed up to claim this
[2:45:55] this wouldn't be worth the effort oh no
[2:45:57] if you'd have been the only one that
[2:45:58] would have ever claimed salvation he
[2:46:00] would have gone all the way to the cross
[2:46:01] and suffered and been broken and
[2:46:03] afflicted and tormented and raised from
[2:46:05] the dead for you to have the victory
[2:46:07] that's how much he loves you
[2:46:09] i want you to know sometimes when we
[2:46:12] want the victory it seems like the
[2:46:14] victory is out there somewhere
[2:46:16] and we can't sometimes sometimes
[2:46:19] we can't
[2:46:21] we can't seem to chase it down
[2:46:23] we can't seem to get a hold of it but
[2:46:26] i want you to know something you got to
[2:46:27] keep your eyes on it
[2:46:30] i don't know if you read this testimony
[2:46:31] that sister shoshanna i'm sorry i say so
[2:46:34] shoshanna
[2:46:38] if
[2:46:40] you read her testimony or not that she
[2:46:42] posted
[2:46:43] but 10 years
[2:46:47] 10 years
[2:46:50] seems like a lifetime
[2:46:53] unless you're an abraham and a sarah
[2:46:57] or unless you're
[2:46:59] one of the children of israel
[2:47:02] waiting on the messiah to come
[2:47:04] 700 years after isaiah's prophecy
[2:47:08] but for them for her for what was going
[2:47:10] on in her life 10 years
[2:47:14] this dream
[2:47:16] that god had given her was before her
[2:47:18] and in her heart and anyway you've got
[2:47:20] to read it i can't tell it's not my not
[2:47:22] my testimony and i couldn't remember
[2:47:24] enough of the details you you should
[2:47:26] read it because it's well written
[2:47:29] and it's an announcement
[2:47:32] also of this dream where
[2:47:36] she saw this girl baby girl
[2:47:39] and they got the news
[2:47:42] this week as she has posted
[2:47:44] that she's indeed carrying that baby
[2:47:46] girl that she believes that the lord
[2:47:48] showed her 10 years ago
[2:47:51] there have been times i'm sure along
[2:47:53] that way that the victory seemed
[2:47:55] way off but it wasn't
[2:47:59] what i want to tell every one of you is
[2:48:02] it's ours we can't always break through
[2:48:05] to it we can't always see the fruit of
[2:48:09] it yet
[2:48:11] but what do we do we do what she's done
[2:48:13] we do what they've done we do what
[2:48:15] others in this room have done we keep
[2:48:17] our eyes on jesus
[2:48:20] when we have a reason to shout we shout
[2:48:22] when we need to cry we cry
[2:48:26] sometimes we cry while we shout
[2:48:30] we speak faith we glorify god we edify
[2:48:33] his name we lift jesus up
[2:48:37] we keep on keeping on we press through
[2:48:40] the doubt we push through the gloom
[2:48:44] we refuse to wear the devil's slave belt
[2:48:47] come on now
[2:48:49] we received a mourn
[2:48:52] like those who have no hope
[2:48:54] as though it will always be like it is
[2:48:58] i want you to know seasons change so
[2:49:01] quickly
[2:49:03] the ebbs and flows of spiritual life
[2:49:07] we talked about how your your natural
[2:49:09] life can change for the bad
[2:49:12] whether suddenly
[2:49:14] what if i wanted to tell you that your
[2:49:16] spiritual life can also change for the
[2:49:18] good
[2:49:20] in one of those suddenly moments
[2:49:23] don't you put your hands on your hip and
[2:49:24] tell me you no longer believe in it
[2:49:26] suddenly
[2:49:27] because you'd be just as foolish as the
[2:49:29] atheist who declares that he doesn't
[2:49:31] believe in a god
[2:49:33] when you and i are over here serving the
[2:49:34] god who doesn't believe in atheists
[2:49:37] come
[2:49:38] on
[2:49:40] he can turn it around
[2:49:42] and that is his desire
[2:49:44] will you choose victory no matter what
[2:49:46] the circumstances are will you choose to
[2:49:48] glorify god
[2:49:50] david mourned he mourned for season
[2:49:53] and then there come a time that he knew
[2:49:55] he couldn't change what had taken place
[2:49:58] and so when they come and got him and
[2:49:59] told him dinner was ready
[2:50:04] and he couldn't stay in this condition
[2:50:06] forever he had a leadership role
[2:50:09] he got up he washed his face
[2:50:11] he combed his hair
[2:50:13] he sat down to eat
[2:50:15] and he decreed
[2:50:17] the lord hath given
[2:50:21] and the lord hath taken away
[2:50:23] blessed be
[2:50:25] the name
[2:50:26] of the lord

[3:12:35] jesus
[3:12:39] to break everything he plays break every
[3:12:43] chance just keep the music going just a
[3:12:45] moment
[3:12:46] i don't know how to say this
[3:12:49] in the right way so you'll just have to
[3:12:51] hear it how it comes
[3:12:54] but as we were worshiping and as i was
[3:12:57] saying some things
[3:12:59] that i felt like the lord inspired me to
[3:13:01] say there was something i didn't say
[3:13:03] i just held on to it for this moment but
[3:13:06] i felt like the lord wanted to address
[3:13:08] guilt
[3:13:09] and the guilt is in a young lady and a
[3:13:12] female or let me say it this way the
[3:13:15] guilt goes back
[3:13:17] to when a
[3:13:19] woman when a sister was a young lady
[3:13:22] and it goes back into the
[3:13:24] i i want to say late teen years there
[3:13:27] were some things that happened in her
[3:13:28] life
[3:13:30] and there's a guilt that she just can't
[3:13:33] at times break through at times it seems
[3:13:35] like it's done
[3:13:37] there were some things that
[3:13:40] happened and things that
[3:13:42] you were involved with
[3:13:46] willingly at the time
[3:13:49] and god wants to
[3:13:51] he doesn't want you carrying that
[3:13:53] anymore
[3:13:54] if you started if i don't know we're not
[3:13:56] going to have a confession around here
[3:13:58] but
[3:13:59] if you knew some of the stories that
[3:14:01] you're standing around with
[3:14:03] and how god is delivered and how god is
[3:14:05] forgiven
[3:14:10] multiple partners and
[3:14:14] some people couldn't even tell you the
[3:14:16] number
[3:14:18] or the names
[3:14:21] but jesus came
[3:14:23] with his blood with his power
[3:14:27] so that you don't have to keep walking
[3:14:29] through the stuff
[3:14:30] and especially the guilt
[3:14:33] i want you to give it to the lord right
[3:14:35] now you don't have to identify yourself
[3:14:38] but i want you to give it to the lord
[3:14:40] because this is old stuff
[3:14:42] this is stuff you haven't walked in for
[3:14:45] years
[3:14:46] but the enemy sometimes will slap you
[3:14:48] with that
[3:14:49] and i want to see god free you right now
[3:14:52] and go all the way back to about
[3:14:54] 16 or 17 years old
[3:14:57] and deliver some of that guilt and roll
[3:14:59] it off of you so you can see yourself as
[3:15:02] a beautiful trophy of god's grace and
[3:15:05] forgiveness and power
[3:15:07] and the enemy is using that very
[3:15:09] strategically
[3:15:11] because he only brings that against you
