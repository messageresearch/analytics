TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but according to the example of of Cain and Abel every one of us is given the commission to watch we're watching for one another not because one another is the enemy but because there's an enemy that wants to get in here I want to tell you tonight there's an enemy that wants to get in here and he wants to sit here he wants to be with don't you start thinking about people this isn't people it wasn't a person that invaded the garden it wasn't a serpent that invaded the garden he was created to live there it was a fallen angel in spirit form a spirit that was able to press himself into a human flesh and it happens again and again and again and again a spirit will take a hold of you when you're not mixing your faith personally with the word I need some help now a spirit will take a hold of you it's one thing for a spirit to whisper to you and you swat him up against the wall but if you give him a place to see it if you pull up a chair and entertain him more than once he will take advantage of your spiritual Garden it's only by discernment sometime it's only by spirit that we can really recognize that the enemy is not just putting a passing thought in our mind he intends to occupy the processes of our thinking to stay low stay left to build up for years to years because ours to stay long enough to create in us a stronghold that will keep us out of all the benefits that God is pouring out all around us you got to keep putting yourself in and every time Satan comes to try to disqualify you you just understand that your qualification your calling your commissioning didn't come from Darkness it came from the light Hallelujah the devil didn't put you in the garden and the devil can't take you out of the garden but he can invade the garden if you're not watching the games God could no longer trust Adam to guard the gate so he had to put cherubims there and a flaming sword that turned in all direction that speaks to you and I of the two-edged sword of the word Adam was no longer trustable in his condition so God said I'll put something there that I can trust a part of me in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God when God positioned that flaming sword at the gate of the Guard Eastgate of the garden when God did that he was positioning a placing of a part of who he was there it was there to keep the enemy from sabotaging the purposes of God and disturbing the rest in the garden You Know The Enemy can't take your garden unless you let him in
