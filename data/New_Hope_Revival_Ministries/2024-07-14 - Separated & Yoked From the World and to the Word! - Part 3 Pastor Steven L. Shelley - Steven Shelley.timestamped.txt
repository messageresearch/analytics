[50:07] working uh would you pray for us this
[50:11] week as we would deal for with uh
[50:14] insurance and so on and so forth in our
[50:16] home I would appreciate that so much I
[50:18] would like to report to you that before
[50:22] the fellowship meeting in August God
[50:24] willing there will be a large air
[50:28] conditioner installed in that building
[50:30] uh the the the gentleman that I've been
[50:32] talking to has agreed to install one
[50:34] unit he said it will cool the building
[50:37] down although it will strain it so we
[50:39] don't want to go too long with only one
[50:41] unit but he is willing to do that for us
[50:44] in time for the August fellowship
[50:46] meeting so I feel very blessed that will
[50:49] happen not this coming week but next
[50:51] week just before the fellowship meeting
[50:53] he said it will uh take about two days
[50:56] and and so that's very exciting but it
[50:58] also is a lot of work for me because I
[51:01] have to make preparation with uh
[51:04] electrical and getting a couple of
[51:06] concrete pads poured for the unit to sit
[51:08] on outside so if you're available this
[51:11] week later in the week there's going to
[51:13] be some work that's going to be done
[51:15] down there in preparation for that I'm
[51:17] thankful for all the Lord is providing
[51:19] for he is faithful to us amen
[51:28] although there's not been work going on
[51:31] down there uh I want you to know that
[51:34] it's constantly going through my head it
[51:37] has it has residence right now but it's
[51:40] it's how things get done um and and then
[51:44] with what is going on in our home and
[51:47] and traveling and so forth but God is
[51:49] faithful I'm grateful for his grace to
[51:51] us he is just so full of loving
[51:54] compassion to us he knows how to take
[51:57] care of us he knows what we can handle
[52:00] and when we've handled that he he sees
[52:03] that uh We've accomplished that then he
[52:06] sends another test for us because his
[52:10] ultimate goal for me and I hope for you
[52:13] is at the end of this journey for him to
[52:15] say Well done my good and faithful
[52:19] servant and then he's going to add
[52:22] something else to it hear ye him
[52:28] adopted Sons that's what I'm looking for
[52:31] friends to accomplish what he has called
[52:33] me in this earth to accomplish so that

[52:41] that is going to become just like

[1:01:03] now do you feel that way do you feel
[1:01:06] that way give the Lord a
[1:01:10] praise love
[1:01:14] you you may be seated
[1:01:17] I I realize
[1:01:20] that uh you know those who have spent
[1:01:25] most of their life north of the Mason
[1:01:29] Dixon
[1:01:30] line and they wouldn't quite understand
[1:01:33] without a little
[1:01:35] help the the the
[1:01:38] negative approach to the
[1:01:41] words I wouldn't take
[1:01:44] nothing that usually means
[1:01:48] negative you know it's it's it you know
[1:01:50] it's not worth anything I wouldn't take
[1:01:52] nothing for that you just have it it's
[1:01:54] just not but when the songwriter wrote
[1:01:57] it he wrote it about a testimony that
[1:01:59] someone had given and it
[1:02:01] means there is nothing that could
[1:02:05] buy the
[1:02:07] journey is so valuable the
[1:02:11] journey every Hill and every Valley and
[1:02:14] every pothole and every curve and every
[1:02:18] High Point and every low point the
[1:02:21] journey has been valuable because Jesus
[1:02:24] has always been the pr
[1:02:27] and when Jesus is the prize then
[1:02:30] whatever you experience in life it's
[1:02:32] worth it and one of these days you don't
[1:02:35] feel this way when you're in the midst
[1:02:37] of the trial but one of these days when
[1:02:39] you stand before him or fall before him
[1:02:43] you'll be able to say without any uh
[1:02:47] reservation it has been worth it
[1:02:51] all it has been worth it all to see him
[1:02:55] do you you believe that amen hasn't God
[1:02:58] been good to us already this morning the
[1:03:01] worship was just beautiful and you
[1:03:04] entered in in such a beautiful way and
[1:03:08] you may not have realized it but your
[1:03:11] worship was becoming intercession today
[1:03:14] for our nation and you know we need to
[1:03:17] be interceding for our
[1:03:20] nation and uh I'm going you're going to
[1:03:23] get tired of me adjusting this but I'm
[1:03:26] going to keep working with it till it's
[1:03:28] a new headset when we purchased it we
[1:03:31] purchased two so we wouldn't be without
[1:03:33] one they're a little
[1:03:35] pricey and so this one hasn't been worn
[1:03:38] and so it's got to get used to my fat
[1:03:41] head and so I'm adjusting and as I sweat
[1:03:44] it slides and and eventually you know I
[1:03:47] think I need one surgically implanted or
[1:03:51] something um but something's pulling it
[1:03:54] but anyway
[1:03:56] uh you could hear me without it but the
[1:03:58] streamers might not be able to so we
[1:04:00] want to make sure that that they can
[1:04:02] hear I'm hearing every day really it's
[1:04:05] the truth thank you so much from the
[1:04:09] streamers how blessed and how helped and
[1:04:13] how encouraged they are by being able to
[1:04:15] stream and I might just tell you that
[1:04:18] something transitioned and you didn't
[1:04:19] know it uh but we have
[1:04:23] doubled our internet speed
[1:04:26] and we have been able to do that really
[1:04:30] because we saved on other things we were
[1:04:33] able to double it without any more money
[1:04:36] involved so what we have is a is a
[1:04:39] miracle
[1:04:42] situation and Gregory brother Gregory
[1:04:45] May was able to help us put some of that
[1:04:47] together now the old companies are not
[1:04:50] happy with
[1:04:51] us they're not happy with us but we were
[1:04:54] able can you imagine imagine double the
[1:04:57] speed hul what do I say how do I
[1:05:00] describe that is
[1:05:01] it is it in terabytes or what is it
[1:05:07] in 250
[1:05:12] megabytes upload and download and it's
[1:05:15] fiber
[1:05:19] optic dedicated line to Phoenix City so
[1:05:22] no one else is pulling on our line and
[1:05:25] it's not even available out here so we
[1:05:28] we pioneered it brought it to this area
[1:05:31] some years ago and now we have finally
[1:05:34] been able to negotiate it down double
[1:05:36] our Speed without any additional money
[1:05:38] and we're very thankful for that we got
[1:05:41] out from under a little maintenance
[1:05:43] agreement on our old phone system too
[1:05:46] and you know it's just always something
[1:05:48] happening and uh that that has to go on
[1:05:51] whether you know anything about it or
[1:05:53] not um if you're interested and why you
[1:05:56] know it never dawned on me I told
[1:05:58] brother gy it never dawned on me that we
[1:06:00] could do one at a time uh and and maybe
[1:06:03] you're wondering why well the money was
[1:06:05] only there for one but when God makes
[1:06:08] the way then then there'll be two sir
[1:06:11] and it just never occurred to me that
[1:06:13] that we could even do it that way but uh
[1:06:17] an old softball buddy of the boys some
[1:06:20] of you will know know him by his his uh
[1:06:23] softball name toothpick
[1:06:26] I've cheered for toothpick a time or two
[1:06:29] and uh go toothpick knock it out of
[1:06:33] here um and so toothpick has come
[1:06:36] through for us with his company and and
[1:06:39] brother gy has been working with him and
[1:06:41] he didn't hesitate to come put in one I
[1:06:43] mean his money but but you know some of
[1:06:46] the bigger outfits or they would just
[1:06:48] say that's too much trouble to come
[1:06:49] twice and do it all but God is good he
[1:06:54] he's got it all in his great big capable
[1:06:56] hands now let me just say this to you
[1:06:59] we've all known that uh the the life of
[1:07:04] former president Trump was in Jeopardy
[1:07:08] we've all known that there were many
[1:07:11] people he's a very controversial polar
[1:07:14] figure and there are people who love him
[1:07:17] too much and there are those who love
[1:07:20] him and there are those who hate him and
[1:07:22] there are many who would like to see him
[1:07:25] dead
[1:07:26] just like you know some others who have
[1:07:29] a call of God on their life the devil
[1:07:32] would like to kill them he'd like to
[1:07:33] kill you and at least three times I have
[1:07:37] seen president Trump uh in danger in the
[1:07:41] spirit and I have prayed for him I know
[1:07:43] you have the last time I had a burden
[1:07:47] for him I saw a bull's eye that had been
[1:07:50] painted right on his Temple and uh I I
[1:07:53] prayed seriously sincerely prayed for uh
[1:07:58] two two days at least maybe three and I
[1:08:01] felt good about it I felt like that that
[1:08:04] immediate threat had passed I've heard
[1:08:07] several people last night who were uh
[1:08:10] experts in the field and they say that
[1:08:12] he had turned I watched it I saw it
[1:08:14] you've seen it uh he turned to look at
[1:08:17] the big screen he likes to see how he
[1:08:20] looks he does and he turned to the big
[1:08:24] screen and just in time
[1:08:29] milliseconds he turned back and many
[1:08:33] experts said in those milliseconds of
[1:08:36] turning it went from what would have
[1:08:38] been his Temple to his
[1:08:41] ear and you know we we'll never know you
[1:08:45] you I can assure you we'll never know
[1:08:47] all that's involved the the original
[1:08:50] person that that the whole thing was
[1:08:52] attributed to was changed through the
[1:08:55] night night and I don't know if it
[1:08:57] really was or if the media just did that
[1:08:59] or not but by by by the morning it was
[1:09:02] someone entirely different than who they
[1:09:04] said it was initially who did the
[1:09:06] shooting and you can rest assured that
[1:09:10] that uh he has been spared many times
[1:09:13] over than that and and and I don't like
[1:09:16] there are many things that I don't like
[1:09:18] that he says or that he has done but I
[1:09:21] have to tell you that those were some of
[1:09:23] the best just like God said said I'm
[1:09:26] going to give this nation a reprieve and
[1:09:29] that's exactly what he did and coming
[1:09:31] out of the Obama years we needed some
[1:09:33] help in this nation so regardless of
[1:09:37] what you think about his personal
[1:09:39] opinions or whatever uh we had a very
[1:09:42] good four years and we've had a very
[1:09:44] hard four years now maybe you're wealthy
[1:09:48] enough that it hasn't affected you but
[1:09:50] it's affected me that's right it's
[1:09:52] affected me and I'm sure that it has the
[1:09:55] price of groceries you know and gas and
[1:09:58] and it's just really been a serious
[1:10:00] thing and it's really funny because uh
[1:10:03] people will say now that the president
[1:10:05] has nothing to do with that but those
[1:10:07] same people complained you know when
[1:10:10] someone else was President why don't he
[1:10:12] do something why don't he do something
[1:10:13] so anyway you know it's all it's all
[1:10:16] corrupt red and blue Republican and
[1:10:19] Democrat just
[1:10:22] corrupt but I would think that maybe a
[1:10:24] republican would be a a better shot than
[1:10:28] a you get
[1:10:30] it because they believe in having access
[1:10:34] to protect themselves so they've
[1:10:36] practiced a bit along the way that
[1:10:38] didn't go over too good but it's funny
[1:10:40] to me it's funny to me I believe that
[1:10:44] God did spare him I do I do I believe it
[1:10:48] could have been different the expert
[1:10:50] experts said that it could have easily
[1:10:52] taken him out it would have been an
[1:10:54] amazing shot shot it would have been an
[1:10:56] amazing shot had he not turned and uh
[1:11:00] first first report first notification
[1:11:03] shots have been fired at the Trump rally
[1:11:05] so we said okay somebody's there acting
[1:11:07] crazy and then the next notification
[1:11:10] said that they thought that President
[1:11:11] Trump had been shot I appreciate his
[1:11:14] courage I appreciate the fact that he
[1:11:16] likes his
[1:11:19] shoes there must be some nice
[1:11:21] shoes he said three times wait wait wait
[1:11:24] I want my shoes let me get my
[1:11:30] shoes I need my
[1:11:33] kicks I want to go to the hospital with
[1:11:36] my shoes
[1:11:37] on and I don't know what the rest of the
[1:11:40] rest of the folks were doing but I
[1:11:42] admire those brave men and two Brave
[1:11:45] women did you know there was one of the
[1:11:48] women who put herself in direct line of
[1:11:50] fire to protect him I appreciate that
[1:11:53] woman I don't think that I don't don't
[1:11:55] think that that should be her career of
[1:11:57] choice I'll be totally honest with you
[1:11:59] but she chose that and she certainly has
[1:12:02] done the duty she wasn't hiding behind
[1:12:05] anybody she was on the front side of
[1:12:08] that and so anyway I didn't want to say
[1:12:10] too much about it except that I believe
[1:12:13] that the tone of the worship shifted and
[1:12:16] it became intercession for for this
[1:12:19] nation and for and for our pres former
[1:12:22] president and for our president now if
[1:12:26] if it would have been him I would have
[1:12:28] been equally grieved and I would have
[1:12:31] thought how horrible that someone would
[1:12:34] do that to a poor old man in his
[1:12:37] condition he's on his way to to Eternity
[1:12:42] uh anyway living on a borrowed moment
[1:12:45] and I would have said the same thing how
[1:12:47] terrible that is it's it's like what has
[1:12:50] happened Through The Years in Russia and
[1:12:52] places like that this nation was never
[1:12:55] founded on that kind of violence and
[1:12:57] we're just believing that uh that it
[1:13:00] caused something to move that will that
[1:13:04] will bless this nation and help us in
[1:13:06] the future the only hope is
[1:13:09] Jesus if your hope is in any
[1:13:13] candidate you're in trouble you're in
[1:13:16] trouble well I'm glad our hope is in the
[1:13:19] Lord aren't you Tuesday is your birthday

[1:14:25] friend of the ministry in South Africa
[1:14:27] and he's planning to be here with his
[1:14:30] family for camp meeting this year and so
[1:14:33] we want to send him a very happy
[1:14:34] birthday on Friday God bless you brother
[1:14:38] let's get ready for the word would you
[1:14:40] stand uh Kate asked for the weekend off
[1:14:44] he was asked to come and play the piano
[1:14:46] for a set of Youth meetings back to
[1:14:49] school meetings in uh Manchester
[1:14:52] Tennessee where Brother David Siler is
[1:14:55] is the pastor and uh he wanted to do
[1:14:58] that and we miss him uh but we
[1:15:00] appreciate his gift and talent and God
[1:15:03] has been using him there and we're
[1:15:06] thankful for that and young people need
[1:15:08] to see young
[1:15:10] people they do they need to see young
[1:15:12] people setting an example of giving it
[1:15:15] all for the Lord do you agree with that
[1:15:18] we we we've got it it's the the the
[1:15:20] young people are not the leaders of
[1:15:22] tomorrow or or the Church of tomorrow
[1:15:25] like the old-timers used to say they're
[1:15:27] the Church of
[1:15:28] today that is the truth that's the
[1:15:31] Church of today and so they need to be
[1:15:34] prayed over constantly consistently I
[1:15:37] hope you uh help me to do that because
[1:15:40] they need it young married couples too
[1:15:42] they're still young and they need lots
[1:15:45] of prayer and lots of support I I think
[1:15:48] I'll I'll let that be for the music
[1:15:50] would you give these musicians and
[1:15:52] singers a a hand of thank you you God
[1:15:55] bless
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:15:59] you God bless you every one of you isn't
[1:16:02] the Lord good to us amen would you turn
[1:16:07] in your Bible this morning I am a little
[1:16:10] unsure where I wanted to to start in my
[1:16:14] scripture reading but I'll go to 2
[1:16:16] Corinthians chapter
[1:16:19] 6 and I will read King James and I will
[1:16:24] let you to be seated then if you promise
[1:16:26] to to give the same attention to the
[1:16:30] Amplified uh I won't make you stand that
[1:16:32] long but we are doing this morning part
[1:16:36] three uh of a sermon series called
[1:16:40] separated and yolked separated and
[1:16:45] yolked we could say loosed and then
[1:16:49] bound bound to something else loosed
[1:16:53] from something and
[1:16:55] connected to something else and the Lord
[1:16:58] as I Was preparing this the first for
[1:17:00] the first service the spirit of the Lord
[1:17:03] said well it's from the world to the
[1:17:05] word we're being separated from the
[1:17:08] world so that we can be yolked to the
[1:17:11] word there is a yoke that you and I want
[1:17:14] to wear it's the one offered to us by by
[1:17:18] the Lord Jesus in Matthew chap 11 that's
[1:17:21] the Yoke that we want to wear in this
[1:17:23] hour of folks this is real I don't know
[1:17:27] if you are experiencing God every day I
[1:17:30] experience him every day I'm in the word
[1:17:34] every day I'm in serious prayer every
[1:17:38] day my relationship with Jesus Christ is
[1:17:42] not for Sunday and Tuesday
[1:17:45] only I I want you to know that I'm not
[1:17:48] boasting I just want you to know that uh
[1:17:51] it's not out of sight out of mind for me
[1:17:54] you are are in my heart you are on my
[1:17:57] prayer list and uh I wrestle for you
[1:18:01] sometime when you don't know you're
[1:18:02] being wrestled for I'm not saying that
[1:18:05] for your appreciation I'm saying that
[1:18:07] that I take this position very serious
[1:18:11] it's not just the preaching that I want
[1:18:13] to do but I want to I want to war for
[1:18:15] you when necessary you can make it I
[1:18:19] want to tell you oh yes you can and it
[1:18:23] just depends on you I appreciate what
[1:18:26] the Lord spoke through Benjamin I
[1:18:27] believe it's just like that you got one
[1:18:29] more chance before you
[1:18:32] spiral and and now we don't believe you
[1:18:34] know we're not T I don't think in any
[1:18:36] way the spirit of God was talking about
[1:18:39] passing that place of of of no return
[1:18:42] you know I I truly believe that God will
[1:18:45] go the extra mile for those that are
[1:18:49] his uh this this concept of sending away
[1:18:52] your day of Grace I believe that applies
[1:18:55] more to the church than it does the
[1:18:57] bride I heard what Jesus said when he
[1:19:00] said all that the father hath given me
[1:19:04] what did he say will come I won't lose
[1:19:07] any of them and so I believe that what
[1:19:10] the spirit of the Lord was saying is
[1:19:11] you're about to to find that slippery
[1:19:14] slope of
[1:19:16] spiral and and you you pay a price when
[1:19:19] you're in that cycle brother have you
[1:19:22] ever been there you just you know you
[1:19:24] just spend around without a without a
[1:19:27] head and uh dizzy you know you can be
[1:19:30] dizzy spiritually and and I think the
[1:19:33] Lord was saying I'm giving you an
[1:19:35] opportunity and and I was standing there
[1:19:37] praying when he said that Lord help us
[1:19:39] to get our feet on the solid rock it's
[1:19:44] Jesus he's our Solid Rock and he's what
[1:19:48] we have to keep ourselves connected to
[1:19:51] abiding in are you with me
[1:19:55] uh I hope so 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and
[1:19:59] verse 14 be ye not
[1:20:03] unequally yolked together with
[1:20:07] unbelievers now I want you to know this
[1:20:10] isn't just in marriage it's not it is it
[1:20:13] is in marriage it's a sin it's wrong
[1:20:17] it's unbelief it's dangerous to enter
[1:20:20] into a love
[1:20:22] relationship with someone who is not a
[1:20:25] Spirit-filled believer I'll be honest
[1:20:28] not only that they ought to believe what
[1:20:30] you
[1:20:31] believe because it will certainly help
[1:20:34] things out but it also means in
[1:20:38] business it means in close
[1:20:41] relationship because we can be yolked
[1:20:44] many ways other than just marriage be
[1:20:48] you not unequally yolked together with
[1:20:51] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[1:20:54] righteousness with unrighteousness I I
[1:20:57] want to say this I know you're standing
[1:20:59] but I want to say this that remember
[1:21:02] that the concept of the Yoke we preached
[1:21:05] this already because of the anointing
[1:21:08] the Yoke shall be destroyed the concept
[1:21:11] of the yoke is that heavy timber that's
[1:21:15] laid on the shoulder of The Oxen and I
[1:21:18] want you to know that oxen are known for
[1:21:20] their
[1:21:21] stubbornness and and you don't want to
[1:21:24] be yoked up tied up with an ox that
[1:21:28] won't follow the
[1:21:30] instructions of the man driving the cart
[1:21:34] if you've got one Ox going one way and
[1:21:37] one another way that's what the the word
[1:21:39] here is then you're certainly not going
[1:21:42] to accomplish anything no righteousness
[1:21:45] in that just
[1:21:47] confusion uh Babylonian confusion will
[1:21:50] prevail when you get hooked up uh yolked
[1:21:54] up with someone who is not as light as
[1:21:57] you are who is not walking in the life
[1:21:59] that you're walking in and so see that
[1:22:03] it's one pulling one way and one pulling
[1:22:05] the next and you know that can happen in
[1:22:07] a Christian
[1:22:08] marriage when both are not fully
[1:22:10] submitted but it definitely will be
[1:22:13] there in a situation where one is not a
[1:22:16] Believer for what Fellowship hath
[1:22:19] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[1:22:21] what communion hath light with with
[1:22:24] Darkness are you following and what
[1:22:27] Concord hath Christ with bile or what
[1:22:31] part ha he that believeth with an
[1:22:39] Infidel good question it's a question
[1:22:43] Paul is saying what in the world back
[1:22:47] please okay what part he hath that
[1:22:51] believeth with an Infidel Christ and
[1:22:53] bile
[1:22:55] or or or someone who believes with
[1:22:58] someone who doesn't
[1:23:00] believe and what agreement hath the
[1:23:03] temple of God with
[1:23:05] Idols so even churches have to be
[1:23:09] careful who they link up
[1:23:12] with even churches because you're
[1:23:16] supposed to make sure you stay clear of
[1:23:19] idolatry and
[1:23:21] paganism so even churches have to be
[1:23:24] careful for ye are the Temple of
[1:23:27] the Living God as God ha said I will
[1:23:33] dwell where in them and walk in them and
[1:23:38] I will be their God and they shall be my
[1:23:43] people this is a covenant it's a vow
[1:23:46] isn't it it certainly is wherefore come
[1:23:51] out
[1:23:55] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:24:00] be ye separate saith the
[1:24:04] Lord and touch not the unclean thing and
[1:24:11] I will receive you now that is pretty
[1:24:15] straight talk because it tells us that
[1:24:19] we are not only judged by what we
[1:24:22] participate in but we are also judged by
[1:24:26] what we
[1:24:32] touch just let that sink
[1:24:38] in touch not the unclean thing and I
[1:24:43] will receive you and will be a father
[1:24:47] unto you and ye shall be
[1:24:49] my sons and daughters saith the Lord all
[1:24:54] Mighty may God help us today in his word
[1:24:57] you may be seated but I would very much
[1:24:59] like to share this with you in the
[1:25:02] Amplified do not be unequally yolked
[1:25:07] with
[1:25:08] unbelievers do not make
[1:25:12] mismated alliances with them or come
[1:25:17] under a different yoke with them
[1:25:23] inconsistent with live
[1:25:26] your faith you know faith is not our
[1:25:31] decoration faith is our
[1:25:34] foundation faith is not optional it's
[1:25:37] not like Cosmetics it's not like
[1:25:39] something you add on or lay off but
[1:25:43] faith is our foundation and our faith in
[1:25:47] Jesus Christ should dictate every
[1:25:50] decision that we make in life
[1:25:55] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:25:59] God they are the sons of God even the
[1:26:03] timing in our life should be ordered of
[1:26:07] the Lord because we as we've learned
[1:26:09] here in seasons and cycles of seed and
[1:26:13] harvest we've learned that if you do the
[1:26:15] wrong thing in the wrong season it's not
[1:26:19] good and even if you do the right thing
[1:26:23] in the wrong season
[1:26:25] it's not good so not only is the thing
[1:26:28] you're doing important but what season
[1:26:31] you do it in is equally important
[1:26:35] recently someone was a a friend a part
[1:26:39] of this ministry long distance to us was
[1:26:43] instructed of the Lord to do a
[1:26:45] particular thing that was going to be a
[1:26:47] bit spontaneous and a bit
[1:26:50] sacrificial and he needed to know the
[1:26:53] timing
[1:26:54] and the Lord directed him to a verse of
[1:26:57] scripture in the New Testament where
[1:26:59] Paul was saying I need to be in
[1:27:01] Jerusalem before such and such and the
[1:27:04] Lord took that verse which God has done
[1:27:07] for me before somebody said isn't that
[1:27:10] lifting it out of context not really
[1:27:14] because God can take a verse of
[1:27:16] scripture directed to someone else H and
[1:27:19] then by Rama by by a by an inspired
[1:27:23] moment he can take that same verse lift
[1:27:26] it off the page and even perhaps
[1:27:30] slightly out of context it was dealing
[1:27:33] with Paul but he can lift it up a little
[1:27:36] bit and use that to help direct your
[1:27:39] steps God's used the Bible that's what
[1:27:41] you really mean when you say I'm using
[1:27:44] my Bible for a road map God will use a
[1:27:48] Bible story or a Bible character to
[1:27:51] speak to you in your life in in the
[1:27:54] present time he can't do that for a lot
[1:27:57] of people because they don't ever open
[1:27:59] the book but if you open the book God
[1:28:03] can direct your eyes and he can direct
[1:28:06] your
[1:28:07] fingers and and uh I think you know
[1:28:10] sometime people say I just open the
[1:28:11] Bible up and start reading nothing wrong
[1:28:13] with that God knows how to put you in
[1:28:15] the right place I just believe it like
[1:28:18] that all right he goes on uh to say you
[1:28:23] you don't want to come you know do not
[1:28:25] make mism alliances with them or come
[1:28:28] under a different yoke with them
[1:28:31] inconsistent with your faith for what
[1:28:34] partnership have right living and right
[1:28:37] standing with god with iniquity and
[1:28:41] lawlessness so I think that even speaks
[1:28:44] to us about our business we should hire
[1:28:47] people we should we should employ people
[1:28:51] who can walk in the same kind of a with
[1:28:54] God in faith that we're walking in and
[1:28:58] we should never feel forced by the world
[1:29:01] standards or really anything else other
[1:29:04] than the leadership of the lord we
[1:29:06] should know that we are joining oursel
[1:29:09] because listen let me tell you something
[1:29:11] one
[1:29:13] aen one aen in the tribe can can cause
[1:29:17] the blessings of God to dry up and one
[1:29:21] Jonah on the
[1:29:22] boat can C the whole boat to rock so you
[1:29:26] want to know who you're boating with you
[1:29:29] want to know who you're who you're
[1:29:30] tenting with don't you this is just just
[1:29:34] practical Christianity for what
[1:29:36] partnership hath right living and right
[1:29:38] standing with god with iniquity and
[1:29:40] lawlessness or how can light have
[1:29:43] fellowship with Darkness somebody said
[1:29:46] well I have to work with people that
[1:29:48] aren't Believers that's right and you
[1:29:50] have to get along with them but you're
[1:29:52] not making an alliance with them you're
[1:29:55] not yoking yourself to them you're not
[1:29:59] bowing down to their Pro their uh you
[1:30:02] know pronoun requests or whatever you
[1:30:05] you're you're just being who you are a
[1:30:07] light in the darkness but when you are
[1:30:10] joined with someone then your souls
[1:30:13] begin to line up and join up and the
[1:30:17] soul is made up of the mind and the will
[1:30:19] and the emotions and if you want trouble
[1:30:22] you get your mind lined up with somebody
[1:30:25] who doesn't even try to have the mind of
[1:30:27] Christ you you get your emotions
[1:30:30] connected to someone who is still
[1:30:33] reeling and rocking from all the cares
[1:30:36] of Life listen folks Christians have as
[1:30:38] many problems as
[1:30:40] unbelievers but Believers have somebody
[1:30:43] to go
[1:30:45] to is't that good news and so we're not
[1:30:48] saying that Believers we don't have any
[1:30:51] junk or we don't have any scars
[1:30:54] but I'm telling you something healing
[1:30:58] it's hard for deep healing to come when
[1:31:01] you're dealing with an alliance that's
[1:31:04] not biblical God didn't start it he
[1:31:07] didn't build it in the first place how
[1:31:10] can light have fellowship with with
[1:31:14] Darkness now in verse 15 he said what
[1:31:17] Harmony can there be between Christ and
[1:31:20] bile the devil or or what has has a
[1:31:24] believer in common with an unbeliever
[1:31:28] how many of you have ever found that out
[1:31:29] even in your family you have to you have
[1:31:32] to really scramble to find something to
[1:31:35] talk about sometime because you're not
[1:31:37] interested in the same stuff and have
[1:31:40] you ever found yourself pretending to be
[1:31:42] interested in something not ugly things
[1:31:44] but a little pretend of of interest
[1:31:47] because you just want to keep the
[1:31:49] conversation moving and but really you
[1:31:52] could care less they don't understand
[1:31:53] saying what agreement can there be
[1:31:56] between a temple of God and and one
[1:31:59] filled with Idols for we are the Temple
[1:32:03] of the Living God even as God said I
[1:32:06] dwell in and with and among them and
[1:32:09] will walk in and with and among them and
[1:32:13] I will be their God and they shall be my
[1:32:18] people powerful references were given to
[1:32:21] you there at the end of that in the
[1:32:23] amplif
[1:32:24] so come out from among unbelievers and
[1:32:29] separate sever yourselves from them says
[1:32:33] the Lord remember you you you've got to
[1:32:36] be in the world but not of the world you
[1:32:40] don't have to laugh at their filthy joke
[1:32:44] you don't have to be a religious fanatic
[1:32:46] you don't have to praise the Lord every
[1:32:49] sentence but you don't have to laugh at
[1:32:51] their junk you don't have to tap your
[1:32:53] your foot to their
[1:32:55] music you don't have to wag your head to
[1:32:58] what they're listening to you have to
[1:32:59] watch yourself and you'll be singing
[1:33:02] along and you don't want to do that
[1:33:04] because you've got to have a testimony
[1:33:06] that screams that life real life only
[1:33:10] comes from Jesus so come out from among
[1:33:13] them come out from among unbelievers and
[1:33:16] separate sever yourselves from them says
[1:33:18] the Lord and touch not any unclean thing
[1:33:22] and I will receive you kindly and treat
[1:33:26] you with
[1:33:27] favor you you can't ask God to bless
[1:33:32] that's what he has cursed you you're
[1:33:36] putting God in a terrible place you
[1:33:38] can't ask him to bless what he cursed
[1:33:41] you can ask him to help you get through
[1:33:44] the the consequences of your poor
[1:33:46] decisions and he will but you can't
[1:33:49] really ask for his favor right when
[1:33:53] there was no favor to be there in the
[1:33:55] beginning I I tell you God doesn't treat
[1:33:58] one one way and one another way he he he
[1:34:01] tries to be uh uh equal and fair and and
[1:34:06] you can't expect God to bless a
[1:34:09] covenant that that is with an unbeliever
[1:34:12] that God didn't bless in the beginning
[1:34:14] the same way let's look let's use the
[1:34:17] example of marriage you can't even
[1:34:19] expect God to bless a marriage like
[1:34:22] described here in the same manner that
[1:34:25] he's going to bless a marriage where two
[1:34:27] Believers have come together I'm sorry I
[1:34:29] didn't write the book I'm just telling
[1:34:32] you what the book said so really you're
[1:34:34] praying Lord let it be the best it can
[1:34:37] be but it has to be according to your
[1:34:40] word oh my don't shoot the mailman
[1:34:44] please and I will be a father to you and
[1:34:48] you shall be my sons and daughters says
[1:34:51] the Lord Almighty
[1:34:53] that's the message we have to keep
[1:34:55] giving to our young people this is life
[1:34:58] this is for life I I I shed some tears
[1:35:02] sister Teresa this weekend I shed some
[1:35:06] tears they weren't sad tears they were
[1:35:09] happy tears for Josiah and for Jennifer
[1:35:14] because I I counsel them both at
[1:35:17] different times in their lives and you
[1:35:21] and others here I I'm not saying I've
[1:35:23] done anything but I'm just saying I've
[1:35:25] heard at times I don't want to embarrass
[1:35:28] him maybe I'm glad he's not here right
[1:35:29] now he's just streaming maybe he's
[1:35:32] sleeping go to
[1:35:34] sleep go to sleep go to sleep but
[1:35:40] anyway I I I stood with him in several
[1:35:43] places I I had a a a a real strong
[1:35:47] memory of standing with him out there on
[1:35:49] the little porch coming out my office
[1:35:52] door and he sat on my couch and and and
[1:35:55] tears in his eyes and and he said I just
[1:35:58] don't think there'll ever be anybody for
[1:36:01] me and that breaks your heart I know it
[1:36:04] must have broke his mama's heart to hear
[1:36:06] something like that and and what did you
[1:36:09] say to him every time we all said the
[1:36:11] same thing just hold on just hold
[1:36:14] on what you don't want is the wrong
[1:36:19] one and in those dark seasons when we
[1:36:23] didn't always know where he was or what
[1:36:27] he was involved in our prayers were
[1:36:30] always hold him Lord don't let him make
[1:36:35] a mistake now that will cheat him out of
[1:36:38] what you've got for him in the
[1:36:42] future and Jennifer came here broken and
[1:36:47] scarred by Life by University life you
[1:36:53] understand
[1:36:54] never uh being able to forgive herself
[1:36:58] for for what she had walked through and
[1:37:02] she didn't think you know that that that
[1:37:05] she could be
[1:37:06] wanted and uh it's just a it's just
[1:37:10] really chokes me in a good way to see
[1:37:15] that God can get
[1:37:19] Beauty so you young people hold on
[1:37:25] on God can get Beauty out of
[1:37:29] ashes and he can bring healing out of
[1:37:32] heartbreak and and this was our attitude
[1:37:35] and I know it was mostly yours Josiah
[1:37:39] got the little family this this weekend
[1:37:41] he got the little family that he that he
[1:37:45] wanted and maybe now that he sees it's
[1:37:48] just not uh press a button pop them out
[1:37:54] maybe he'll let the Lord guide him in
[1:37:55] how many are to
[1:38:00] come it's not a Coca-Cola
[1:38:06] machine you you need the full
[1:38:08] picture how many of you remember it just
[1:38:11] kind of changes your mind a little bit
[1:38:13] it it calms you down just a tad when you
[1:38:15] see the whole shabang but anyway I I'm
[1:38:20] thankful that they
[1:38:22] waited I'm thankful that God cleaned
[1:38:25] them up and gave them to each
[1:38:29] other and uh of course they weren't
[1:38:32] teenagers but who
[1:38:35] cares who
[1:38:37] cares they they you you know I was told
[1:38:40] as a child and couldn't have believed it
[1:38:42] then but they say if you you know if you
[1:38:44] marry too early and then later if you
[1:38:47] married in alive you wouldn't even marry
[1:38:49] the same
[1:38:50] person because you're you are not look
[1:38:53] looking for the same things but God
[1:38:57] knows and and I think everybody ought to
[1:39:00] take
[1:39:01] hope I don't think you ought to feel
[1:39:03] like that your your chance has
[1:39:06] expired I think you ought to wait wait
[1:39:10] on the right one it would be foolish for
[1:39:13] you to yoke yourself up with someone who
[1:39:16] is not a Believer I don't care how cute
[1:39:19] he
[1:39:20] is I don't care how smashing she is
[1:39:24] she's going to droop and drop like
[1:39:25] everybody
[1:39:28] else and he oh let's get and he is
[1:39:36] too when that when that big strong chest
[1:39:40] of a
[1:39:41] man slides down to his
[1:39:44] waist it's a dadbod VIN whether he's a
[1:39:49] dad or not so you better be looking
[1:39:51] beyond the badger skin
[1:39:53] brother and you better find the
[1:39:56] character that is there isn't that right
[1:40:00] so God's pretty pretty clear here King
[1:40:03] James and Amplified come out from among
[1:40:07] them separate yourselves say at the Lord
[1:40:10] don't touch the unclean thing and I will
[1:40:12] receive you and I not only receive you
[1:40:14] but I'll give you relationship like
[1:40:16] you've never known before I'll be a papa
[1:40:18] to you you'll be my sons and daughters
[1:40:22] we we'll have more than and a covenant
[1:40:24] and a vow we'll have a relationship
[1:40:26] we'll have a love affair how many of you
[1:40:29] know that's a pretty good deal that God
[1:40:31] is is offering to us we look at some of
[1:40:35] these scriptures and and and it stirs
[1:40:38] our heart to believe that God knows
[1:40:41] exactly what he's talking about in the
[1:40:43] message
[1:40:45] Oneness brother bandam said here we are
[1:40:48] in the end time coming from the East and
[1:40:52] the West W North and South what are we
[1:40:57] doing we're getting
[1:41:01] ready we're getting ready for that
[1:41:06] rapture we we're not preaching a social
[1:41:09] gospel
[1:41:10] here we're not preaching a social
[1:41:13] justice message here the church is doing
[1:41:17] that the church is fulfilling their
[1:41:19] purpose the church is feeding the hungry
[1:41:23] you help when you can particularly those
[1:41:27] of the household of faith people
[1:41:29] criticize me for that but I'm telling
[1:41:31] you the message came to separate us from
[1:41:35] the passion of of social justice out
[1:41:38] there and what the church gets all beat
[1:41:40] up about in this hour you better focus
[1:41:43] on getting
[1:41:48] ready for that
[1:41:51] Rapture split bit second he's you know
[1:41:55] he's trying to rassle his straw
[1:42:01] hair he's tightening up his red
[1:42:05] tie he's about to slip out to give a
[1:42:09] speech AR rousing speech in a community
[1:42:13] that's already known to favor him in
[1:42:16] every way he's expecting to ramble
[1:42:21] through at least an hour without
[1:42:24] notes with everyone hanging on every
[1:42:28] word and and unless he had some kind of
[1:42:32] warning only
[1:42:34] seconds only seconds he just hears the
[1:42:38] sound and reaches for his
[1:42:41] ear my point in that is he expected to
[1:42:45] to go home and eat a snack and go to bed
[1:42:50] with his shoes I think beside his bed so
[1:42:53] could watch over them he had no idea how
[1:42:56] close he was to
[1:42:59] Eternity it just suddenly it went from a
[1:43:03] shot in the C to now the president has
[1:43:06] been hit I want you to know uh those who
[1:43:09] have lived through some of those days
[1:43:11] announced off of that uh uh Hill in
[1:43:15] Dallas the president has been
[1:43:17] shot years later his brother shot and uh
[1:43:23] the assassination of Martin Luther King
[1:43:25] Jr a shock went all over the world we
[1:43:30] could be dealing with that kind of shock
[1:43:32] today he better know he better know I'm
[1:43:35] using him as an example he better know
[1:43:39] that he's fixing things up with
[1:43:41] God and you and I better not only know
[1:43:45] we're fixing things up with God we
[1:43:47] better know we're Rapture
[1:43:50] Ready remember we're not going to be
[1:43:53] judged in Rapture by what's only
[1:43:55] abounding in our lives but we're going
[1:43:57] to be judged by what's put there the
[1:44:00] seed that is within us and I want you to
[1:44:03] know everything we need to make the
[1:44:05] Rapture is in us right now because we've
[1:44:09] receive the word of God that's what it
[1:44:11] takes to get out of here but that seed
[1:44:14] is watered and at different times it
[1:44:17] blooms and produces fruit in our life
[1:44:20] and we want to live a fruitful life for
[1:44:22] him but we want to know that we are
[1:44:25] ready and the people started gathering
[1:44:28] in the 60s from the North and the South
[1:44:32] and the East and the West they gathered
[1:44:34] to Rally around a word that they
[1:44:38] discerned was sent to help prepare them
[1:44:42] for the Rapture I believe that the
[1:44:45] message of the revelation of Jesus
[1:44:48] Christ that he has sent to us is not for
[1:44:51] everyone
[1:44:53] I don't believe it was sent for the
[1:44:56] church at large I believe it was sent to
[1:45:00] an elected number I don't know the
[1:45:04] number I know there's some in the East
[1:45:06] and the and the and the west and the
[1:45:08] North and the South I know some have
[1:45:11] light skin and some have dark skin and
[1:45:13] some have un between in between skin
[1:45:16] some from one continent and some from
[1:45:19] another continent it's not about one
[1:45:21] Church
[1:45:23] it's about those who have received a
[1:45:25] real unveiling of Jesus Christ I don't
[1:45:29] even agree with those who say that's not
[1:45:32] possible without acknowledging the
[1:45:34] ministry of brother brandham I don't
[1:45:35] even believe that because I believe God
[1:45:38] is obligated to reveal himself to you as
[1:45:42] his seed wherever you
[1:45:46] are for me he happened to use the
[1:45:48] ministry of brother brandham and I think
[1:45:51] you're going to have to come under the
[1:45:52] influence of somebody who's got it
[1:45:55] that's right to see the importance of it
[1:46:00] and the most ideal way would be to hear
[1:46:02] it for yourself but if it doesn't happen
[1:46:05] that way I'm not going to support those
[1:46:07] who stand and say you've got to belong
[1:46:10] to a particular church and you've got to
[1:46:12] you know have so many years under your
[1:46:14] belt with the ministry of the Prophet to
[1:46:16] be ready it's not a man's Ministry that
[1:46:20] dresses us for the rapture it's the
[1:46:23] revealing of the
[1:46:26] word it's the word revealed that's what
[1:46:29] our wedding garment is and again I think
[1:46:33] the best way and the easiest way I is to
[1:46:36] hear it through the messenger but if it
[1:46:39] doesn't happen that way I believe God is
[1:46:43] able to send an angel to the deepest
[1:46:45] parts of the
[1:46:48] Orient I believe God is able now listen
[1:46:51] I can't help but have any testimony than
[1:46:54] that because I believe what I believe
[1:46:56] today because God was working on me way
[1:47:01] before I knew there was a to be a
[1:47:03] prophet or or or what his ministry was
[1:47:07] God started talking in my heart why do
[1:47:09] you think that is I believe it's cuz I
[1:47:11] was his and was getting me ready to hear
[1:47:15] what was to come so don't let it hang
[1:47:19] up in one man
[1:47:23] from a generation
[1:47:25] ago you you you will find that feeding
[1:47:28] on that once you hear it once you know
[1:47:31] what it is feeding on that is what's
[1:47:32] going to help you be ready no doubt I
[1:47:35] just want to make sure I say it in so
[1:47:37] many different ways that the critics
[1:47:39] will just have a harder time
[1:47:41] misunderstanding I'm so glad for how I
[1:47:44] heard it amen and I thought it was all
[1:47:48] perfect and I thought that most anybody
[1:47:50] who knew about it would have to be
[1:47:52] perfect I couldn't imagine how they
[1:47:54] could be anything but perfect sitting
[1:47:56] under such a perfect word
[1:48:00] boy did I find out was my honeymoon
[1:48:04] shortlived I found out that some of the
[1:48:11] rottenest gathered around this and when
[1:48:14] it started throwing me I had to go to
[1:48:16] God about it and he said well wouldn't
[1:48:18] it be that way hasn't it always been
[1:48:20] that way hasn't truth always drawn a
[1:48:23] mixed
[1:48:24] crowd and that word just continues to
[1:48:27] separate us from the make
[1:48:30] believer and from the
[1:48:32] unbeliever how many of you identify as a
[1:48:35] Believer a believer of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:39] Christ he said now getting ready for
[1:48:42] that
[1:48:43] Rapture getting ready for holding
[1:48:45] ourselves steady for a few
[1:48:48] minutes till every
[1:48:52] till every
[1:48:54] fiber is
[1:48:57] filled
[1:48:58] with holy GH the Holy
[1:49:02] Ghost what if you can't quote what
[1:49:05] message it was from what if you can't
[1:49:08] remember the title what if you don't
[1:49:11] remember the paragraph number or the
[1:49:14] year that's not what it's
[1:49:16] about what if you can't recite uh this
[1:49:20] or that in order what if you can't get
[1:49:23] the virtues in order what if you can't
[1:49:24] from memory give us the names of the
[1:49:27] church ages and The Messengers I don't
[1:49:30] think that's the big deal what I think
[1:49:32] is the biggest deal is that we hold
[1:49:36] steady under the influence of this
[1:49:39] revealed word until every fiber is
[1:49:44] filled with the Holy
[1:49:47] Ghost and Jesus said when he the Holy
[1:49:52] Ghost has come he will lead you guide
[1:49:57] you and direct you
[1:50:00] into all
[1:50:03] Truth by by all truth he said then
[1:50:07] she'll go up when when when every
[1:50:12] fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:50:16] separating you from church
[1:50:18] anity so that he can join you up to
[1:50:21] himself
[1:50:23] amen we're waiting for holding steady a
[1:50:27] moment until every fiber every cell is
[1:50:31] filled up with the Life of Christ
[1:50:34] through the infilling and refilling of
[1:50:36] the Holy Ghost then she'll go up he said
[1:50:40] oh my calling his people
[1:50:43] together not to a particular
[1:50:48] Tabernacle or unto a man only but
[1:50:51] calling is people
[1:50:54] together to
[1:50:57] himself in the true
[1:51:02] Oneness I'm slowing it down with
[1:51:07] himself because it's his one Holy
[1:51:13] Spirit by one Spirit are we all
[1:51:17] individually powerful I like this way
[1:51:20] powerful by one Spirit are we all
[1:51:24] individually baptized into one
[1:51:27] body collectively not one Church body
[1:51:31] one church family but the collectively
[1:51:34] the body of Jesus
[1:51:37] Christ there there's there's an African
[1:51:40] portion of the body of Jesus Christ a
[1:51:43] European portion Asian portion of the
[1:51:47] body of Christ and yet we're all one and
[1:51:51] Jesus Christ listen not just waiting on
[1:51:54] the Great Escape but Jesus Christ living
[1:51:58] with his spirit in our
[1:52:02] flesh our body serving the
[1:52:10] church if you think you need a title
[1:52:14] there it
[1:52:15] is
[1:52:17] servant servant of the
[1:52:20] church servant of Jesus Jesus Christ you
[1:52:24] get under that
[1:52:25] inspiration and you won't look for the
[1:52:28] janitor to pick up the piece of
[1:52:31] trash you'll do
[1:52:33] it because you'll see that a part of
[1:52:36] your ministry is ultimately serving
[1:52:40] Christ and in order to do that we also
[1:52:43] serve his church body his people our
[1:52:46] brothers and sisters doing and then
[1:52:49] doing the same things he did as a
[1:52:53] as an ins sign to the world that we're
[1:52:56] in the last days getting ready for the
[1:53:00] Rapture oh I love him don't you do you
[1:53:05] this morning if you do shout
[1:53:08] Amen in the message God's only provided
[1:53:11] place of
[1:53:13] worship
[1:53:15] inport he said if I taught you a
[1:53:18] Methodist message it would take no
[1:53:21] effect on on you this is bride time
[1:53:26] bride time the pressure that falls on
[1:53:30] the local church in this hour even the
[1:53:34] message Associated church is to be like
[1:53:38] other
[1:53:39] churches if we were more like other
[1:53:42] churches our families would come if we
[1:53:45] were more like other churches we could
[1:53:47] invite our neighbor if we were more like
[1:53:50] other churches we could have our
[1:53:51] coworkers ERS to come I'm so sorry for
[1:53:55] your grief and I'm sorry that you're
[1:53:59] looking for something just like all the
[1:54:02] others and and I just advise you find a
[1:54:05] flavor that you can
[1:54:07] swallow but because this is we we're
[1:54:10] never going to be able to go anywhere by
[1:54:13] only bringing a Methodist message when
[1:54:17] this is
[1:54:18] now bride time if Moses taught the
[1:54:22] message of Noah it would take no
[1:54:27] effect if Jesus taught Moses message it
[1:54:32] would take no effect does that mean that
[1:54:33] it wasn't true no the message of Moses
[1:54:37] was true the message of Noah was true
[1:54:40] the message of Jesus of course is always
[1:54:43] true and
[1:54:45] Timeless but some of the preaching of
[1:54:48] these Messengers was directed specific L
[1:54:53] to an age we can look back and say now
[1:54:56] we know that even in that we take
[1:54:59] something because all scripture is
[1:55:02] inspired and given to us for for help
[1:55:06] but you can't take that message of Moses
[1:55:09] and make it
[1:55:11] work in another
[1:55:14] age are you following me so you can't
[1:55:18] take Luther's message of justification
[1:55:21] and think think you're going to feed the
[1:55:24] bride with only that or Wesley's message
[1:55:29] of sanctification you can't just feed
[1:55:32] the bride with that or Pentecostals
[1:55:36] message of restoration of gifts tongue
[1:55:40] talking you can't feed the bride with
[1:55:43] just that in fact we have a harder
[1:55:47] responsibility than any other age
[1:55:49] because we have to take the truth of
[1:55:53] every age and use it in our day while
[1:55:58] leaving behind the fanaticism of
[1:56:01] man-made religion that followed those
[1:56:05] messages and whether they're willing to
[1:56:08] admit it or not that same Spirit has
[1:56:11] formed itself around the ministry of
[1:56:14] brother brandham trying to make it
[1:56:16] another flavor or another
[1:56:19] denomination come on now another
[1:56:25] organization and God can't move in that
[1:56:29] we leave behind the error of all of the
[1:56:33] other days we bring forward the truth
[1:56:38] and we thank God for the grace that was
[1:56:41] upon men like Luther to keep his head
[1:56:46] above the
[1:56:47] fanaticism that surrounded his own
[1:56:49] message
[1:56:54] you
[1:56:58] understand you had to do the same for
[1:57:01] William
[1:57:02] brandom because there were nuts nuts
[1:57:06] nuts that followed
[1:57:09] him real Bonafide
[1:57:15] nuts believing all kinds of nutsy
[1:57:20] things and he had to keep his head above
[1:57:23] all that you know Becky called and she
[1:57:27] said Daddy they're doing it
[1:57:30] again I'm over at the house of some of
[1:57:33] the leaders you know of the church and
[1:57:35] they're doing it again they're doing it
[1:57:37] again you know what they were doing at
[1:57:39] least we've never had to worry about
[1:57:40] that so much around
[1:57:42] here sometimes they've gathered to say
[1:57:44] what kind of a devil I was but I don't
[1:57:47] think they've gathered too many times to
[1:57:49] say that I was
[1:57:50] God they they were gathered that Sunday
[1:57:53] afternoon to talk about how brother
[1:57:55] brandom had to be Jesus
[1:57:58] Christ you know he really did have to be
[1:58:00] Jesus Christ so do you it's his life in
[1:58:04] us but that's not what they were saying
[1:58:06] she said Dad I can't take anymore
[1:58:09] they're added again he said I'm coming
[1:58:11] to get you Becky I'm not even going to
[1:58:13] slow
[1:58:15] down just I'm going to open the door you
[1:58:18] jump in and we'll tear out of there why
[1:58:21] was it so urgent because he didn't want
[1:58:23] to be a
[1:58:24] part or that influence upon his family
[1:58:28] wonder what he'd say if he could hear
[1:58:30] some of them talking
[1:58:32] now he didn't want them under that so
[1:58:35] every messenger who brought a a a
[1:58:38] message that that that shifted
[1:58:41] really the whole church ages they had to
[1:58:45] make sure they didn't get under the
[1:58:47] influence of some of those
[1:58:50] nuts you and night today we have to
[1:58:54] watch especially as we go out among them
[1:58:57] we've been you know pretty isolated here
[1:58:59] through the years and it's been okay
[1:59:03] it's really been okay and I know some of
[1:59:06] you long for Fellowship outside the
[1:59:09] local body and that's okay but you just
[1:59:12] got to be
[1:59:14] careful that you don't get under the
[1:59:16] influence of nuts
[1:59:22] cuz they're out
[1:59:24] there you got to know that the message
[1:59:27] is right for the season you're not going
[1:59:31] back and trying to force something
[1:59:33] that's already established on the bride
[1:59:36] you may remind them you may go back and
[1:59:38] bring it forward but but you you got to
[1:59:41] you got to move on you know you've got
[1:59:43] to you've got to make sure you're in the
[1:59:45] right timing because we're getting ready
[1:59:47] for Rapture because the predestinated
[1:59:49] seed are laying there that will only be
[1:59:54] watered by that type of water that's
[1:59:58] give for that
[2:00:00] seed are you with me let me make sure
[2:00:04] that means you can't water a bride seed
[2:00:06] with the Methodist message you can't
[2:00:09] water the bride seed with a Baptist
[2:00:11] message or a Pentecostal
[2:00:14] message or even a bromite
[2:00:17] message the bride sees through that
[2:00:20] stuff she doesn't want that that's not
[2:00:22] what she's looking for so when you're
[2:00:24] sitting there and they say to you that
[2:00:26] every word that he spoke everything that
[2:00:28] came out of his mouth was thus sayth the
[2:00:30] Lord you ought to have a sirene going
[2:00:32] off on your head you ought not to be
[2:00:35] standing up saying Amen to
[2:00:43] that you ought to have that Holy sirene
[2:00:46] that says woo
[2:00:48] wooo nuts
[2:00:54] you you you can't because that's more
[2:00:56] denominational than it is revelational
[2:00:59] you can't feed the bride you can't water
[2:01:01] the bride's seed with a denominational
[2:01:03] message or one that hangs only in a
[2:01:07] man and there's no checks and balances
[2:01:10] other than the tapes there's got to be
[2:01:13] checks and balances and that is the
[2:01:15] absolute scripture that's
[2:01:18] right I'm on it and I'm going to stay on
[2:01:20] it because
[2:01:22] it's going to be a it's going to be a
[2:01:23] separating factor in this uh uh uh very
[2:01:27] end of the
[2:01:29] end so you you've got to get the right
[2:01:31] water for the right seed it won't grow
[2:01:33] in any other condition it must be the
[2:01:36] conditions that grows it now you can
[2:01:39] take a chicken egg next paragraph and
[2:01:42] put it in an incubator which should be
[2:01:44] under a hin but it'll hatch anyhow put
[2:01:47] it under a pup it would hatch it's the
[2:01:49] Warmness the condition
[2:01:52] that makes it hatch so it has to be
[2:01:55] under condition it has to be in the
[2:02:01] right you can make these
[2:02:04] quotes in the wrong
[2:02:09] atmosphere and the Egg won't
[2:02:14] hatch it's not just the seed it's not
[2:02:17] just the egg it's also the
[2:02:20] atmosphere it's also the
[2:02:23] condition you got to be in the right
[2:02:26] condition and in the right
[2:02:29] atmosphere so that the water can come
[2:02:32] and fall on the seed you could take a
[2:02:34] good live egg and put it under a dead
[2:02:35] hen it won't hatch why because there's
[2:02:38] no warmth there you can put a bride seed
[2:02:41] in a denominational
[2:02:45] church and it won't hatch
[2:02:52] they've tried it oh yes they've tried
[2:02:55] it they've tried to slip from here and
[2:02:59] and and and find their way to UPC or
[2:03:02] something like
[2:03:04] that and and they found out they just
[2:03:06] can't hang with
[2:03:08] it they've even come back and told me
[2:03:11] one re not too too long ago came back
[2:03:14] and said I I was okay I got I made it
[2:03:17] through Christmas it was hideous it was
[2:03:19] horrible it was terrible but I made it
[2:03:22] through Christmas all the carryings on
[2:03:25] inside the church but I made it but then
[2:03:28] the pastor announced one Sunday I'm
[2:03:30] going to teach on the Book of
[2:03:37] Revelation he said I knew I was ruined
[2:03:40] then because once God opens your eyes to
[2:03:43] How This Book of Revelation has come
[2:03:45] alive in our
[2:03:48] day you could never go over to 7-Day
[2:03:51] Adventist and get all that
[2:03:53] satisfied
[2:03:56] hello takes the condition the condition
[2:03:59] has to be right now notice uh paragraph
[2:04:03] 11 and this was from this morning
[2:04:06] charity paragraph 11 of the of the
[2:04:09] message Divine love Sovereign Grace
[2:04:11] Prince Prince Albert Saskatchewan
[2:04:15] Canada uh uh paragraph
[2:04:20] 11 now no
[2:04:22] notice Abraham just an ordinary Man by
[2:04:27] but God by election Sovereign Grace
[2:04:30] called Abraham when there's many young
[2:04:33] men in the land in that day I want you
[2:04:35] to think about that it could have been
[2:04:37] any young man instead of singing Father
[2:04:40] Abraham we could have been singing
[2:04:42] father
[2:04:43] Josiah or father
[2:04:46] Steven or or or father somebody else but
[2:04:49] it was Abraham it was Abra that God
[2:04:52] chose among all the others he did it by
[2:04:56] election by Sovereign Grace even though
[2:04:59] there were many young men that could
[2:05:01] have had the call there was probably
[2:05:03] some more capable of doing the job as
[2:05:06] the world would think than Abraham was
[2:05:09] but look at that
[2:05:12] God he's not looking at what Seminary
[2:05:15] did he graduate from what cemetery did
[2:05:19] he hang out in
[2:05:23] how many DDS does he have after his
[2:05:26] name uh or or pothole digs you know phds
[2:05:31] H how many of them does he have behind
[2:05:33] his name no no no God knows the heart he
[2:05:38] said that's it are you with me we should
[2:05:41] study to show ourselves approved unto
[2:05:43] God a Workman that needeth not to be
[2:05:44] ashamed but we shouldn't expect the
[2:05:46] denominations to educate a preacher of
[2:05:49] this truth sometimes you wonder how God
[2:05:52] takes the foolish things to confound the
[2:05:54] wise but God knows the heart of
[2:05:58] man men usually well you know you people
[2:06:03] when you're selecting your pastors you
[2:06:05] usually slip the guy in great big
[2:06:07] seven-footer with curly hair and so
[2:06:10] forth the Hollywood
[2:06:12] type sometimes God don't even choose
[2:06:14] that type you want something that'll be
[2:06:17] a
[2:06:19] mixer that'll go to the card party with
[2:06:23] you and set in the games and a
[2:06:27] mixer
[2:06:28] uhoh man wants
[2:06:31] mixers but God wants
[2:06:35] separators he wants to separate you from
[2:06:39] that stuff not to punish
[2:06:42] you but so that he can join you to the
[2:06:48] word just a minute hey am
[2:06:52] man because you can't have one foot in
[2:06:58] Christ and one foot in the
[2:07:04] world you see the little girl who stands
[2:07:07] in the
[2:07:08] mirror and sneaks the makeup out of her
[2:07:12] purse that she bought at Walmart and
[2:07:16] puts that on her eyes so that she can
[2:07:19] see herself in the mirror she's already
[2:07:21] already
[2:07:23] struggling there's already something a
[2:07:26] drift in the
[2:07:27] heart that's
[2:07:29] right sometimes we seasoned Believers we
[2:07:32] don't help them because we reach back
[2:07:35] into the world and pick up little do
[2:07:37] dads and shiny shiny
[2:07:42] shinies
[2:07:44] sparklies we want the little white
[2:07:46] stripe on our toenail
[2:07:51] we know we wouldn't paint them pink and
[2:07:54] all other crazy colors no holy ghost
[2:07:57] sister would do something like that but
[2:08:00] they'll just go get the little white
[2:08:02] stripe painted on the tip because
[2:08:06] there's something listen it's the same
[2:08:09] spirit that makes the teenager go in and
[2:08:12] try
[2:08:14] the manicure on their
[2:08:18] eyes that's what brother brandom called
[2:08:21] it
[2:08:22] he didn't say
[2:08:24] mascara Same
[2:08:27] Spirit Same Spirit that makes a Godly
[2:08:30] woman want a shorter skirt so that she
[2:08:33] can show off her bicycle Bridges
[2:08:39] underneath same kind of spirit that
[2:08:43] makes us reach
[2:08:44] out cuz we want to be we want to be
[2:08:47] different but we want to be as you know
[2:08:50] we want to oh was
[2:08:53] quiet remember shiny shiny
[2:08:58] shiny God wants
[2:09:01] separators the the church World wants
[2:09:06] mixers
[2:09:09] hello that same woman will go to all
[2:09:12] kinds of degrees to get her strap
[2:09:16] pined so that you don't see it but she
[2:09:20] likes to wear those Bloomer things those
[2:09:23] bicycle shorts and whatever else you
[2:09:25] call them down way past her
[2:09:28] knee with her you know miniskirt
[2:09:33] on I said to them when they begin to ask
[2:09:36] me they don't ask me
[2:09:38] anymore but when they begin to ask me I
[2:09:41] said now you've got to decide is that
[2:09:43] outer garment or
[2:09:45] undergarment if it's undergarment you
[2:09:47] said that's for modesty if that's
[2:09:49] undergarment for modesty then brother
[2:09:51] random said a woman ought not to let her
[2:09:54] undergarments
[2:09:55] show and I agree with
[2:10:00] him see it's not those big
[2:10:03] things it it's those little shiny shiny
[2:10:07] shiny it's those little things that the
[2:10:09] enemy will use to try to pull us back in
[2:10:13] that direction I I even said you know uh
[2:10:16] we were wearing uh and I've got one I
[2:10:19] don't wear to preach but Ben Benjamin
[2:10:21] gave me a a rubber a bracelet a rubber
[2:10:25] band type thing you put it's not really
[2:10:27] a bracelet but you wear it on your wrist
[2:10:28] so I guess you would call it that and
[2:10:31] and what does it say on
[2:10:32] it God can't fail I don't want to take
[2:10:35] their testimony but that's for a reason
[2:10:38] Cade bought me a a a pen I should have
[2:10:42] wore a tie tack that sat on it he had
[2:10:45] made for us God can't fail because in
[2:10:49] all that we were going through
[2:10:51] they were going through we were going
[2:10:54] through with Elana's birth a as God be
[2:10:57] to move there for us a notification came
[2:11:01] in or something like that from your
[2:11:03] email because you had ordered some
[2:11:05] things like that and it and the and the
[2:11:07] message came from God can't
[2:11:09] fail so right about the time he needed
[2:11:12] to to to to
[2:11:15] breathe he looks down and and the note
[2:11:17] of God can't
[2:11:19] fail God what a
[2:11:22] reminder and we had some blue and white
[2:11:25] ones that we wore to remember to pray
[2:11:27] for Israel nothing wrong with that but
[2:11:30] what happens is then you then folks are
[2:11:32] not satisfied with
[2:11:34] that it's not shiny shiny
[2:11:37] shiny I'm just telling you not
[2:11:40] condemning anybody not directing this
[2:11:43] Truth at anybody I'm just saying be on
[2:11:45] your
[2:11:49] guard then your underarms will be
[2:11:51] showing and the next thing and it just
[2:11:52] goes on and be on guard you say these
[2:11:56] things don't matter I want you to know
[2:11:57] they may not matter to the
[2:12:00] church but those getting ready for the
[2:12:02] Rapture they they are not going to be
[2:12:06] mixers they're not going to be legalists
[2:12:08] they're not going to be Fanatics
[2:12:10] either but they are going to be
[2:12:16] separators they're not going to do all
[2:12:19] kinds of crazy things with their hair
[2:12:21] people do today make it all different
[2:12:24] colors and twist it all up it's a glory
[2:12:27] it's not for your
[2:12:30] convenience God didn't give these

[2:12:46] it so it's not for your convenience it's

[2:14:00] fanaticism he wants somebody a full

[2:14:53] have come out sometime and and you have
[2:14:56] to come out sometime and stand alone if
[2:15:00] you ever walk with God that's a problem
[2:15:02] even in a church this
[2:15:03] size if somebody feels Justified because
[2:15:06] they see somebody else doing it that's a
[2:15:09] dumbest I'm gonna be honest with you
[2:15:10] folks that's pretty
[2:15:12] dumb that sounds like a backslider to me
[2:15:16] who's always looking at somebody else's
[2:15:18] family looking over there on your Pew to
[2:15:20] see what you do so they can justify and
[2:15:22] do it
[2:15:23] more your eyes aren't to be on each
[2:15:26] other in this house you're to treat
[2:15:29] everybody the same whether they keep the
[2:15:32] standard or not you're to love everybody
[2:15:35] without judgment and believe that God
[2:15:37] will do the work no I Don't Preach at
[2:15:39] every service because it's not necessary
[2:15:42] but when God drives it home to my heart
[2:15:44] I want you to hear what you need to hear
[2:15:47] for That season for that hour so that we
[2:15:49] don't become too
[2:15:51] attached to the glistening Delights of
[2:16:00] Egypt a man's love and commitment is not
[2:16:04] and and vow is not to be judged by The
[2:16:07] Bling that he buys for his
[2:16:13] wife it's his
[2:16:16] character that we're looking
[2:16:18] for preach on brother
[2:16:24] the faith of Abraham let me get this one
[2:16:27] out now God said then Abraham in order
[2:16:30] to walk with me you've got to separate
[2:16:32] yourself from the rest of them God
[2:16:34] Demands a total separation but you want
[2:16:36] to bring a lot of the world along with
[2:16:37] you when you come in and receive the
[2:16:40] Holy Ghost you say well I was taught to
[2:16:41] be this and I was taught the days of
[2:16:43] Miracles has pass you better leave that
[2:16:46] thing behind or sometimes they come here
[2:16:49] well I was taught that there was not to
[2:16:50] be any kind of tongues without
[2:16:51] interpreter and I was taught this and I
[2:16:53] was taught that and I was taught the
[2:16:54] other thank God for your
[2:16:56] teaching just thank God for your
[2:16:58] teaching but don't judge us that's right
[2:17:01] you better leave that thing behind as
[2:17:03] long as that holds with you it'd be like
[2:17:05] Abraham started out with lot and his
[2:17:07] father there's trouble in the camp and
[2:17:09] God never did bless Abraham until he
[2:17:11] separated himself and done what God told
[2:17:14] him to do and you'll never receive the
[2:17:16] holy ghost in the fullness you'll never
[2:17:18] walk in the spirit of God until you
[2:17:20] totally separate your things from
[2:17:22] unbelief get away from the world come
[2:17:26] out of the
[2:17:29] world I know you think I'm crazy he said
[2:17:32] but if I
[2:17:35] am just let me alone I'm happy this way
[2:17:38] I'd rather be like this in the way I was
[2:17:40] see I looked at my sacrifice one time
[2:17:43] and then separation the world wants
[2:17:45] mixers and he goes back to that curly
[2:17:47] hair Pastor type thing uh get up on the
[2:17:50] the pull pit and say Amen real amen

[2:18:35] afraid of the
[2:18:38] deacons well brother they might as well

[2:18:42] in preaching the gospel just throw the
[2:18:45] axe to the root of the tree God wants
[2:18:47] separators what does the church want mix
[2:18:50] mix
[2:18:52] mixers let's go to Revelation 18 and
[2:18:56] I'll take another 10 or 15 minutes
[2:18:59] here I think you I think we read
[2:19:06] this and after these things I saw
[2:19:09] another Angel come down to heaven have
[2:19:11] from Heaven having great power and the
[2:19:14] Earth was lighted with his glory
[2:19:16] lightened with his glory and he cried
[2:19:18] mightily with a strong voice saying
[2:19:21] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[2:19:23] and has become the habitation of devils
[2:19:26] and the hold of every foul spirit and a
[2:19:29] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[2:19:33] wow that's a strong word he goes
[2:19:36] on for all nations have drunk of the
[2:19:39] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[2:19:41] the kings of the Earth have committed
[2:19:43] fornications with her and the merchants
[2:19:45] of the Earth are wax Rich through the
[2:19:48] abundance of her Delicacies that false
[2:19:51] religious system has greased the palms
[2:19:54] of other
[2:19:57] nations like
[2:19:59] Kuba like many
[2:20:01] others and I heard another voice from
[2:20:03] Heaven saying come out of her my people
[2:20:08] yes that you be not partakers of her
[2:20:11] sins and that you receive not of her
[2:20:13] plagues God was saying I'm going to
[2:20:15] judge her and you don't want to be
[2:20:17] joined with her
[2:20:20] you don't want your name on the role of
[2:20:22] that system when the judgments come for
[2:20:27] her sins have reached under heaven and
[2:20:29] God hath remembered her
[2:20:32] iniquities reward her even as she
[2:20:35] rewarded you and double under her double
[2:20:37] according to her works in the cup which
[2:20:39] she hath filled to the double to her
[2:20:41] double how much she hath glorified
[2:20:43] herself and lived deliciously so much
[2:20:46] torment and sorrow give her for she
[2:20:48] saith in her heart I sit a queen and am
[2:20:51] no Widow and shall see no sorrow Oh
[2:20:55] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[2:20:57] day death and mourning and famine and
[2:20:59] she shall be utterly burned with fire
[2:21:01] for strong is the Lord God who judgeth
[2:21:04] her that's serious business this is a
[2:21:07] false system that still affects the
[2:21:10] church world today and will even greater
[2:21:13] in the future but will receive the
[2:21:16] recompense of her behavior her her
[2:21:18] iniquities will not be forgotten God
[2:21:20] said and to his elect church he said get
[2:21:23] out of
[2:21:25] her if you're baptized in titles you you
[2:21:29] you've been
[2:21:31] joined to that system come and take the
[2:21:35] name of Christ and cancel your old
[2:21:40] vow call the church and say get my name
[2:21:43] off the
[2:21:45] [Music]
[2:21:47] book I'm not even coming back for
[2:21:50] Christmas
[2:21:52] dinner I'm
[2:21:54] done I'm finished no condemnation in my
[2:21:58] heart but God has set this bird free I'm
[2:22:02] no longer in the cage
[2:22:05] Hallelujah God's only provided place of
[2:22:08] worship paragraph 90 well that's the way
[2:22:11] it is in this age we're living in and
[2:22:13] I'm trying to hurry cuz I ask for a few
[2:22:15] more minutes uh you've got to find
[2:22:17] what's God's way of doing it for this
[2:22:19] age
[2:22:21] that's what Martin Luther found that's
[2:22:23] what John Wesley found that's what the
[2:22:24] Pentecostals found in their age God's
[2:22:27] age and time to do
[2:22:30] it now the Pentecostals that brother
[2:22:33] when I believe is one of his eyes was
[2:22:35] out a colored brother who really started
[2:22:38] the Pentecostal message in California
[2:22:40] the old isusa Street he was laughed at
[2:22:43] because he was and I hope it's not
[2:22:45] offensive to say it this way a negro he
[2:22:48] was black skinned and mo and made fun of
[2:22:52] a patch on one eye how could God do
[2:22:54] anything new and fresh and beautiful and
[2:22:57] world shaking with a man like that but
[2:23:00] that's exactly the kind of man that God
[2:23:02] was looking
[2:23:04] for one who would sell out the him he
[2:23:07] was made fun of but he brought a
[2:23:11] message for that age just little body of
[2:23:14] fellow could hardly sign his name but
[2:23:16] the Lord revealed to him that this was
[2:23:18] the age for the restoration of those
[2:23:20] gives and they come no matter what said
[2:23:23] it come it did it came but everybody's
[2:23:26] got in the atmosphere of it and seen it
[2:23:28] was that age and seen God vindicating
[2:23:30] that those people could speak with
[2:23:32] tongues and so forth it happened but
[2:23:34] then when he went and pinned it down
[2:23:36] this is the only evidence look what
[2:23:39] happened it killed
[2:23:44] it killed
[2:23:46] it all of it real all of it for today
[2:23:50] all of it right but you can't pin it
[2:23:53] down and add your Doctrine and when they
[2:23:56] started saying if you don't speak in
[2:23:58] tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost it
[2:23:59] wasn't their Holy Ghost to give and take
[2:24:02] and decide who had and who didn't have
[2:24:05] it killed it it denominated
[2:24:08] it they come along now the same thing
[2:24:11] like I said a moment ago if you don't
[2:24:12] believe that he couldn't make mistakes
[2:24:15] if you don't believe that everything he
[2:24:16] said was thus sayith the Lord then
[2:24:18] they're trying to put you out well the
[2:24:21] reality is you didn't put some of us in
[2:24:23] and you can't put some of us
[2:24:25] out you've added your Creed to what he
[2:24:29] said just like they added the Creed it's
[2:24:32] got to be by the one evidence of
[2:24:34] tongues that's not what God was
[2:24:37] saying that's what they were saying
[2:24:40] killed
[2:24:41] it but it goes
[2:24:43] on that did it then they started
[2:24:46] separating this and making denominations
[2:24:48] and one's coming on a cloud and the
[2:24:50] other one's coming in a bush and oh my
[2:24:53] there it goes that's what denominations
[2:24:56] does God is not an author of
[2:24:58] denomination because denomination is
[2:25:01] Babylon and he's not the author of
[2:25:05] confusion we see her all you don't have
[2:25:07] to be even intellectual to see that
[2:25:09] aren't you glad we can all get it it's
[2:25:13] Babylon see tradition think of it
[2:25:15] sincere people now still because they
[2:25:17] believe that there still needs to be one
[2:25:19] sincere place
[2:25:20] place where God
[2:25:23] meets notice verse two Worship in that
[2:25:26] place that I have
[2:25:29] chosen the sacrifice of course where
[2:25:32] they worshiped over the sacrifice the
[2:25:34] place that I chose not what you choose
[2:25:38] what men choose but what I have chosen
[2:25:41] you Worship in that place there shows
[2:25:45] theirs then only one place others in
[2:25:48] vain it must not be of your
[2:25:50] choice but it must be his choice and now
[2:25:54] see if this doesn't sound like the
[2:25:56] modern Church well I don't have to go to
[2:25:59] church or you're so narrow-minded why
[2:26:01] why do you drive all the way down
[2:26:04] there you'll even fuss at women about
[2:26:07] preaching and women bobbing their hair
[2:26:09] and Men about these other things why
[2:26:10] you're so narrow-minded they say things
[2:26:12] like that all right you don't have to
[2:26:14] take God's way about it you go on out
[2:26:17] and do what they do what they do that at
[2:26:19] you go out where they do that at and
[2:26:22] you'll find out it's the scripture so in
[2:26:25] vain do they worship me the scripture
[2:26:28] said so Jesus spoke of the same thing
[2:26:30] didn't he see we're almost almost done
[2:26:33] that every little jot everything you
[2:26:35] must be faithful in it's always the
[2:26:37] little the little the little fox that
[2:26:39] spoils the
[2:26:44] vine sometimes you leave it's not the
[2:26:46] big things you do it's the little things
[2:26:48] that you leave
[2:26:51] uhoh you didn't respond enough to that
[2:26:53] it's not the big things you do sometimes
[2:26:55] it's the little things you
[2:26:57] leave undone God help us please remember
[2:27:03] a chain is only as strong as
[2:27:06] it's the blessed are they that do all
[2:27:09] the Commandments of God that they might
[2:27:11] have a right to enter in do all God
[2:27:15] said if it's said for a woman to have
[2:27:17] long hair you say a man told me not long
[2:27:19] ago I don't PR preach a closed L and
[2:27:21] religion I said then you're not
[2:27:22] preaching the
[2:27:25] gospel he said God laid it out there he
[2:27:28] said what to do and you either do it
[2:27:29] that's your natural reasonable thing
[2:27:31] what little thing little insignificant
[2:27:33] Jesus said blessed are they that would
[2:27:35] take all the little things and do the
[2:27:36] little
[2:27:43] things and a woman to let her hair grow
[2:27:45] by it's just something she can do it's
[2:27:47] something she can do and she won't even
[2:27:50] do
[2:27:55] that just the little things he said oh
[2:27:59] teach us the great things how can you
[2:28:01] teach the great things when you won't do
[2:28:03] the simple common
[2:28:05] thing because you see your
[2:28:09] motive and your objective is wrong it's
[2:28:12] your love to God lord I don't care what
[2:28:14] you want me to do I don't care what you
[2:28:16] want me to do I'm willing to do it then
[2:28:20] you're getting somewhere but if you
[2:28:22] don't do it that way the way he said do
[2:28:26] it last paragraph it's his
[2:28:30] choosing the place that I have chosen
[2:28:33] that's where you worship with your
[2:28:38] sacrifice how many of you know where
[2:28:40] that place is it's a place that God has
[2:28:42] chosen to put his name and he only puts
[2:28:45] his name on the full counsel of his word
[2:28:48] so if not the whole counsil of God if
[2:28:50] the whole Council of God is not being
[2:28:52] preached they may paint his name on the
[2:28:56] door but God said it's no more than a
[2:28:59] den of devils it may say Church of God
[2:29:02] it may say Assembly of God it may say
[2:29:04] you know whatever it may
[2:29:07] say it's not the sign on the
[2:29:12] door then you'll remember I think I
[2:29:15] skipped ahead that Sunday and I and I
[2:29:18] read in Deuteronomy where he said
[2:29:20] destroy all the places where the Nations
[2:29:21] you are dispossessing serve their God
[2:29:24] it's separating it's separating it's
[2:29:27] separating he said in paragraph 48 God's
[2:29:29] only provided place of worship the thing
[2:29:31] I want to speak about this morning is
[2:29:33] that God has only one place that the
[2:29:36] worshipper can meet God only one place
[2:29:40] Through the Ages many have sought for
[2:29:41] this secret place of
[2:29:46] God through all the ages
[2:29:50] ever job wanted to know even job wanted
[2:29:53] to know where he lived at if I could
[2:29:55] only go to his house and knock at his
[2:29:57] door job wanted to find God's dwelling
[2:29:59] place because there's their God and his
[2:30:01] family is wor their God and his family
[2:30:04] worship
[2:30:08] together and and and then the
[2:30:11] last Deuteronomy 16:2 and this will this
[2:30:14] will finish us for
[2:30:16] today Thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[2:30:20] the Passover unto the Lord thy God of
[2:30:23] the flock and the herd in the place in
[2:30:28] the place which the Lord shall choose to
[2:30:32] place his name
[2:30:38] there does it mean the same anywhere
[2:30:44] else
[2:30:46] hello you must observe it in the place
[2:30:50] where the Lord has chosen to place his
[2:30:54] name same message God's only provided
[2:30:57] Place paragraph 131 notice in here he
[2:31:00] said seven days shall you eat this
[2:31:03] unleavened bread now bread is typed
[2:31:05] Jesus said man shall not live by bread
[2:31:08] alone but by every word not just a word
[2:31:10] here and their denomination would have
[2:31:12] you believe it but the word of God is
[2:31:14] perfect it's God
[2:31:17] himself oh please listen to this
[2:31:24] if there would be anybody here this that
[2:31:26] replace their Bible with the spoken word
[2:31:28] book hear
[2:31:33] this not just a word here and there as a
[2:31:36] denomination would have you believe but
[2:31:37] the word of God is perfect it's God
[2:31:41] himself in letter form called a seed and
[2:31:45] the right kind of unadulterated faith in
[2:31:49] that word
[2:31:51] word will bring the
[2:31:58] seed to its
[2:32:01] life you you can't be joined to Christ
[2:32:04] the word if you're still joined to some
[2:32:08] form of man-made
[2:32:10] religion if you're still joined to the
[2:32:13] world one with the world you can't
[2:32:16] possibly become one with the word until
[2:32:19] you severed yourself from one and wrap
[2:32:22] your arms around I'm telling you folks
[2:32:23] I'm telling you young people hear what
[2:32:26] we're saying to you this
[2:32:29] morning it's very clear looking out
[2:32:32] across this house that some of you need
[2:32:34] a big attitude
[2:32:38] adjustment and there's nothing to do it
[2:32:40] like the
[2:32:43] word you don't want to be in that tail
[2:32:48] spin you want to make make a decision
[2:32:51] today to throw yourself on the Rock of
[2:32:54] Ages because there's one thing for sure
[2:32:56] I know you don't want the Rock of Ages
[2:32:58] to fall on you if you're going to be any
[2:33:00] falling done you fall on him it'll break
[2:33:03] it'll hurt but let me tell you something
[2:33:05] he'll pick you up and make you stronger
[2:33:07] than you ever were
[2:33:08] before you can't intellectualize your
[2:33:11] way to God and you can't reason your way
[2:33:13] to
[2:33:14] truth
[2:33:18] hello you can't question your way to
[2:33:22] Revelation if you want revelation
[2:33:25] musicians are coming if you want
[2:33:27] revelation from the word you've got to
[2:33:29] sit in his presence you've got to be
[2:33:32] willing to build a condition uh around
[2:33:35] you so that his presence can
[2:33:37] come and here's why some people need to
[2:33:40] get the television out of their
[2:33:44] house here's why some need to do that
[2:33:47] because the atmosphere that you're
[2:33:49] creating with that is not the kind of
[2:33:52] atmosphere where the word is going to
[2:33:54] jump alive in your
[2:33:57] spirit and the problem is we don't want
[2:34:00] to turn the thing
[2:34:04] off old people will turn it on first
[2:34:06] thing in the morning and let it run
[2:34:08] until
[2:34:12] midnight and all that
[2:34:18] stuff I tell you about an hour of Fox
[2:34:21] News is all that anybody could possibly
[2:34:25] stand because after that they just
[2:34:29] repeat it over and over the same thing
[2:34:32] the same clip the same story all day
[2:34:36] long it get it'll get under your skin
[2:34:39] you you should uh uh get re turn that
[2:34:42] thing off get rid of it if you have
[2:34:45] strength to do so and create an
[2:34:48] atmosphere so that when you sit down and
[2:34:50] begin to read the word of God begins to
[2:34:52] Spring forth alive in your heart you
[2:34:56] can't whip the Devil with a
[2:34:59] headline but you can whip him with the
[2:35:02] revelation of the
[2:35:04] word you believe that let's stand
[2:35:10] believe we're not being separated from
[2:35:13] that to
[2:35:14] dangle
[2:35:16] unconnected praise God we're being
[2:35:19] separated from that so that we can be
[2:35:22] joined with the Lord what a privilege it
[2:35:26] is to be invited to become one with him
[2:35:30] if you believe that say Amen let's come
[2:35:33] and worship let's get ready and let's
[2:35:36] worship him for a few moments together
[2:35:38] this morning he is worthy he's worthy of
