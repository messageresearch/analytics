[0:00] but she will come forth with the
[0:03] overcoming power that was given to all
[0:07] the other church ages
[0:12] [Music]
[0:16] remember when i was in jerusalem and he
[0:18] caught me up into a heavenly place
[0:21] and introduced me to the messengers of
[0:23] the seven church ages
[0:25] now that's one thing i know is real
[0:28] and in that experience
[0:30] i was told that in the same way
[0:34] that all the evil
[0:36] of the other ages of the church ages
[0:39] that all the evil was gathered together
[0:43] into the age of laodicea
[0:47] so everything evil from ephesus and
[0:50] smyrna and pergamus and all these other
[0:52] church ages
[0:54] it was gathered together and expressed
[0:57] again
[0:58] in laodicea
[1:00] the most evil and wicked age the age of
[1:03] people's rights the most evil and wicked
[1:06] age of all the other church ages are you
[1:08] with me but remember he told me in that
[1:11] experience that in the same way
[1:14] in the same manner that all the evil of
[1:17] all the other church ages had been
[1:18] gathered into laodicea he said i have
[1:21] also gathered together the overcoming
[1:23] portion
[1:27] hallelujah
[1:28] so not only is this the culmination of
[1:31] evil in laodicea but it's also the
[1:33] culmination of all the overcoming
[1:37] portions
[1:39] so what god gave to ephesus and what god
[1:41] gave to smyrna and what god gave to all
[1:44] of these other pergamos and all the
[1:47] other church ages
[1:48] he has gathered together to form a bride
[1:52] like no other
[1:54] who will come out of laodicea
[1:57] she will have experienced the evil of
[2:00] every church age
[2:03] but she will come forth with the
[2:06] overcoming power that was given to all
[2:11] the other church ages
[2:13] why because christ has to come in bride
[2:17] form
[2:19] i'm the just some church member
[2:22] he thought of me he smoked me
[2:25] he sent me
[2:29] he made a world for me to live on
[2:32] even though sin perverted my life he
[2:36] made a way
[2:37] to take me back
[2:39] all the way back
[2:41] to his original thoughts about me
[2:43] i want to give you a definition of
[2:45] deliverance
[2:46] deliverance is being taken back
[2:49] to god's original thoughts concerning
[2:52] you
[2:53] that's deliverance
[2:54] when you get back to living the life
[2:58] that god ordained for you to live over
[3:00] here
[3:01] you can say i found my total deliverance
[3:04] until then we're still pushing still
[3:06] pulling
[3:08] still praying
[3:09] still believing
[3:18] you
