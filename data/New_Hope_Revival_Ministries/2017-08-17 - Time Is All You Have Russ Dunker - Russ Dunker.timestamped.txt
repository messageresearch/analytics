[0:01] hi I'm brother Shelly from New Hope
[0:03] revival ministries and I'm rich when it
[0:06] comes to friends I am so blessed to have
[0:09] friends from all over the world some who
[0:12] have been with me through the years
[0:14] faithful tried and true and on occasion
[0:18] I'm still able to make a new friend or
[0:20] two as we go along life's journey
[0:22] I was recently sitting down talking to
[0:25] one of my friends wrist dunker who God
[0:27] has been blessing and speaking to and
[0:30] dealing with for a long time now
[0:31] especially over the past few months we
[0:34] were thinking about the early church and
[0:36] how it must have been disappointing to
[0:38] see the older members dying going by the
[0:41] way of the grave when they were living
[0:43] with such an anticipation expectation
[0:47] that Jesus was coming back any day than
[0:50] I asked him we want to get a little that
[0:52] on video and share it with our other
[0:54] friends I want you to listen I believe
[0:57] it's important that we live with an
[0:59] expectation of the coming of the Lord I
[1:01] want you to pay close attention to the
[1:03] part where Russia shares if we knew the
[1:06] date just say we could know the date the
[1:09] Bible says no man knoweth the day or the
[1:11] hour but if we knew the date how would
[1:14] we live between now and then I think
[1:17] it's a good question I pray you'll be
[1:19] blessed by what Russia shares god bless
[1:21] you
[1:24] [Music]
[1:30] hi this is Russ dunker from Carver
[1:32] Minnesota and I just like to share a
[1:36] little bit of a story over the last
[1:39] couple years that I've had and how I've
[1:40] come to know some of the family here had
[1:43] new hope and pastor Shelly and his team
[1:46] I'd like to start out with actually
[1:50] talking a little bit about Paul Keith
[1:52] Davis was kind of the beginning of some
[1:55] of the journey and 2015 I was watching
[1:58] some of his webinars a friend had sent
[2:01] me a link to his voice of the bride
[2:05] webinars so I was watching those in 2015
[2:09] and I saw a theme in some of those
[2:11] webinars and palki Davis would reference
[2:15] a man named William Branham quite often
[2:18] and so finally I thought why is he
[2:22] fascinated with this man I had never
[2:24] heard of him before
[2:25] and so I decided to get on some websites
[2:30] and find out who William Branham was
[2:33] after that things started really opening
[2:36] up in the Bible and really was enjoying
[2:40] learning about the message and learning
[2:43] about William Brannon and some of the
[2:46] things of the kingdom that I wasn't
[2:47] familiar with I've been walking with the
[2:50] Lord for 24 years but I had never heard
[2:54] of the healing movement I'd heard the
[2:57] name Billy Graham and Oral Roberts but
[2:59] that really was about as much as I'd
[3:02] ever heard never had really studied end
[3:04] times or the Book of Revelations but it
[3:09] just seemed to open up when I started
[3:10] listening to some of the things of the
[3:12] message and then coming forward in late
[3:17] 2016 in the same way I noticed that on
[3:21] these webinars that Paul Keith Davis was
[3:24] also talking about pastor Stephen Shelly
[3:27] and after a few times of that coming up
[3:31] I decided to go on to YouTube
[3:34] and see who pastor Shelley was and some
[3:37] of the first things I found on YouTube
[3:39] was Paul Keith Davis and pastor Shelly
[3:44] sitting down and talking about the
[3:46] ministry of william brennan talking a
[3:49] little bit about perry green from tucson
[3:53] and so decided in in around probably
[3:59] late fall of 2016 to send out a an
[4:05] invitation to see if we could get
[4:07] together and meet in the in the time we
[4:10] had gotten a a card because we had
[4:13] watched the the fall camp meeting here
[4:18] and had signed up for the streaming and
[4:20] watched that and was really encouraged
[4:22] by it so we received a card I believe it
[4:27] was a Hanukkah card from the Shelly
[4:28] family and in turn we sent our Christmas
[4:32] card down to New Hope here in greetings
[4:35] as well so we were finally able to
[4:39] connect later on in 2017 but about that
[4:44] time something significant had had
[4:46] happened to me personally I was in my
[4:49] living room talking to a friend of mine
[4:51] named will and this light came through
[4:54] the ceiling and I'm not prone to these
[4:57] types of experiences and I followed the
[4:59] light and it came in to me and we had
[5:02] been talking together about the body of
[5:05] Christ whenever we were on the phone
[5:08] people were constantly saying they were
[5:10] busy they were busy how have you been
[5:12] brother Habib in sister busy busy and we
[5:15] were having that conversation and when
[5:17] that light came through and came in I
[5:20] just simply said to my friend on the
[5:22] phone hold on and I said Lord what is
[5:25] that and he said to me says you've got
[5:29] it all wrong and I said what do I have
[5:31] wrong and he says time and he says you
[5:34] look at time as a curse but time is
[5:37] really a blessing and I said well what
[5:39] do you mean by that and he said well
[5:41] your mindset is that you feel that you
[5:44] will have time to get to know me and in
[5:46] turn
[5:46] but it's on this side that you get to
[5:49] know me so rather than looking at time
[5:52] as a curse waiting to get to eternity
[5:55] you need to really be looking at time as
[5:57] a blessing and that's what that voice
[5:59] said to me and it wasn't long after that
[6:03] I was listening on the VOD and pastor
[6:07] Shelley said in a message in December of
[6:10] 2016
[6:12] virtually the same thing in in talking
[6:16] in one of his Sunday morning messages as
[6:18] what that light had said to me so that
[6:21] was kind of a double witness or a
[6:22] confirmation to me that the Lord really
[6:25] wanted me to start looking at time and
[6:28] getting really the message was to know
[6:30] him rather than waiting for eternity to
[6:33] get to know him and so then we were able
[6:37] to connect and we were able to I was
[6:40] able to fly down several times
[6:42] throughout this year and connect through
[6:46] text and of course watching the VOD and
[6:50] really kind of getting up to speed
[6:53] studying the table with William Brannon
[6:55] studying some other message pastors were
[6:59] primarily listening to the the feeds
[7:01] coming out of New Hope and livestreaming
[7:03] when we had the availability then about
[7:07] six weeks ago had another experience
[7:10] this one was a little different I was
[7:13] simply talking to a friend of mine on
[7:15] the phone who was struggling with issues
[7:17] of time and real things coming at them
[7:21] from all different directions and all of
[7:23] a sudden I just heard out of my own
[7:25] mouth I said in an interactive date
[7:28] there was a date that just came randomly
[7:30] but what I said to him is what if on
[7:33] August 22nd 2022 the Lord told us that
[7:40] that that's going to be his return to
[7:42] this earth say that he came to us as
[7:47] John saw the Lord Jesus where he fell
[7:50] down as a dead man in the Book of
[7:52] Revelations with his hair white as wool
[7:54] and a
[7:55] his feet his burnished bronze and stuff
[7:57] and what if he came and he delivered a
[8:00] message with a date and we knew a
[8:02] specific date of when the Lord was
[8:04] returning and I said to this friend of
[8:06] mine what would you do and he simply
[8:08] made this statement he said that would
[8:10] change everything he said everything I
[8:13] would do from now until then would be
[8:16] focused on the coming of the Lord
[8:19] because it would just enhance the return
[8:22] of the Lord we all know it by the word
[8:25] and but we never really think about the
[8:27] actual return at least he and I were
[8:30] having that discussion and so then
[8:33] coming forward here a week ago I was
[8:37] simply getting out of the shower
[8:39] meditating on the Lord and I heard the
[8:42] word date and I thought date I wonder
[8:46] what the Lord was talking about but I
[8:48] knew he was connecting it back to that
[8:50] experience six weeks earlier so I sat my
[8:54] family down in the living room and
[8:56] proceeded to talk to them again about
[8:59] this revelation of the date only this
[9:02] time when I when I spoke it I really
[9:05] felt the heat of the Lord on it wanting
[9:08] me to really focus not on a date meaning
[9:12] trying to set the time of his return but
[9:15] trying to get my mind set to work on a
[9:18] way of where I was expecting his return
[9:21] and as I meditated on these things I
[9:25] started thinking about first and second
[9:28] Thessalonians and I'll come back to the
[9:32] date but I want to I want to read
[9:33] something in Thessalonians to you it
[9:36] says here in in 1st Thessalonians 4 it's
[9:40] talking about the coming of the Lord and
[9:42] it says for this we say to you by the
[9:45] word of the Lord that we who are alive
[9:47] and remain until the coming of the Lord
[9:50] will not precede those who have fallen
[9:52] asleep for the Lord Himself will descend
[9:56] from heaven with a shout and with the
[9:58] voice of an archangel and with the
[10:00] trumpet of God and the dead in Christ
[10:04] will rise first then note then we who
[10:07] are alive and
[10:09] Maine will be caught up together with
[10:11] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[10:13] the air and so shall and we shall always
[10:17] be with the Lord and so as I was
[10:21] meditating on this Scripture I flipped
[10:24] over to second to first Corinthians 5 23
[10:28] and I look at this verse now may the God
[10:31] of peace himself sanctify you entirely
[10:35] and may your spirit soul and body be
[10:38] preserved complete without blame at the
[10:41] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and what
[10:44] struck me is is the it says the coming
[10:48] of the Lord and the coming of the Lord
[10:49] Jesus Christ in these two verses and so
[10:53] I went back and I wanted to see when
[10:55] these were written and I realized that
[10:57] first Thessalonians was according to
[11:00] scholars really the first letter that
[11:03] Paul ever wrote as an apostle and as I
[11:08] was reviewing this it dawned on me by
[11:11] the Holy Spirit that this scripture
[11:14] speaks of a sanctification that the Lord
[11:18] does but it says spirit soul and body
[11:21] the tripart man but then I said to
[11:24] myself
[11:25] everybody's body has gone to the grave
[11:27] there has not been a preserved or
[11:30] complete body yet other than the Lord
[11:32] Jesus Christ and so what the Lord was
[11:35] showing me at least my revelation was
[11:37] this that this scripture had yet to be
[11:41] fulfilled that this scripture was
[11:43] pertaining to first Thessalonians for
[11:46] those who are live are going to be alive
[11:49] and remain will have their spirit their
[11:52] soul and now their body preserved
[11:55] because everybody else is in the grave
[11:57] and as I was meditating on these
[12:00] scriptures the Lord just kind of spoke
[12:03] to me and said really wasn't that part
[12:06] of William branham's message in Malachi
[12:10] 4:6 and I'm just going to reference that
[12:13] scripture just so that we're clear about
[12:16] it but part of his ministry was
[12:22] the children and the hearts of the
[12:24] children to the father's to bring the
[12:27] hearts of the children back to what is
[12:29] known as the Apostolic fathers well
[12:32] here's one of our Apostolic fathers the
[12:35] Apostle Paul and he's writing his first
[12:37] Thessalonians first letter to the
[12:40] Thessalonians and really what is he
[12:42] doing is he's bringing comfort to them
[12:45] because they're expecting the return of
[12:48] the Lord already some 22 years later
[12:50] this is presumably written around 52 ad
[12:53] so the Lord Jesus has departed from the
[12:56] earth and 80 30 and 22 years later it
[13:00] appears people are starting to die and
[13:03] they're wondering well what's happening
[13:05] I'm dying and the Lord hasn't returned
[13:07] yet and I and I love how the father uses
[13:10] the Apostle Paul to write a letter that
[13:13] tells them that in no way will those who
[13:17] are alive and remain precede up into the
[13:22] clouds with the Lord before those who
[13:24] are dead in Christ so the dead in Christ
[13:26] will go to the grave but those that
[13:29] alive and remain will go up in the
[13:31] clouds but it's the dead in Christ will
[13:33] rise first and I thought what a comfort
[13:35] to the church but then my mind started
[13:38] thinking back to william branham was
[13:42] being that messenger and how he spoke to
[13:46] the Pentecostals but then how he also
[13:49] spoke kind of into the to the millennial
[13:52] reign and kind of that cross over and
[13:55] how he was bringing that message forward
[13:57] from Malachi and that message part of
[14:00] that message is the return of the
[14:03] children's hearts to the Apostolic
[14:04] fathers and and what is that is living
[14:09] with that date in mind that date of the
[14:13] return of the Lord Jesus these people
[14:15] here were giving up everything for the
[14:17] gospel they weren't thinking about
[14:18] retirement they weren't thinking about
[14:21] being in fact when they they went and
[14:24] got beat for the gospel they counted
[14:26] that as an award being being used and
[14:31] suffering as a reward to be close to the
[14:34] Lord everything
[14:34] were looking at was the coming kingdom
[14:37] not this earth life and to me that's
[14:40] part of what the message and and William
[14:43] Branham has brought back to me was kind
[14:46] of this looking again at eternity and
[14:49] looking at the Book of Revelations and
[14:51] looking at the kingdom of God
[14:53] verses at this earth life and just being
[14:56] saved and blessed and prosperous which
[14:58] was really kind of the message that I I
[15:00] taught and learned from an early
[15:04] Christian age talking about being saved
[15:06] and so what has really happened for me
[15:11] yesterday meeting with pastor Shelley me
[15:14] in his office is we were talking about
[15:17] some of these scriptures and some of
[15:20] these times and some of these these
[15:23] dates and he mentioned he said well the
[15:26] Lord has really had me on the mind and
[15:29] the soul of the mind will and the
[15:31] emotions and and really has had me
[15:34] focused and not allowed me to get off of
[15:36] there and as soon as he said that I felt
[15:38] the Spirit of the Lord just give me this
[15:41] incredible revelation and it is really
[15:44] was tied into the sanctification that is
[15:48] mentioned here in 1st Thessalonians I'm
[15:52] going to get back to this year 523 and
[15:57] what that says again just for reference
[16:00] now may the God of peace himself so God
[16:03] Himself is going to sanctify us entirely
[16:06] and it says may your whole spirit your
[16:09] whole soul in your whole body and I was
[16:12] looking at the body the return of the
[16:15] body on this on this earth this
[16:17] glorified body but really the soul the
[16:20] mind will and emotions is where I need
[16:23] to grow in and realizing when Pastor
[16:26] Shelley said that yesterday
[16:27] it really just flooded me with light to
[16:30] realize it's really that that garment
[16:33] that's been stained is really in the
[16:35] soul that I've been born-again and and
[16:38] washed in the blood of Jesus in the
[16:40] spirit and my body according to this
[16:43] will be preserved complete by the Lord
[16:46] but it
[16:48] the soul that has been my challenge my
[16:50] mind will and emotion but then I was a
[16:53] little depressed when I first saw this
[16:55] because I thought well how do we do this
[16:57] but then I looked at verse 24 and it's
[17:00] as faithful is he who calls you and he
[17:04] also will bring it to pass so what I
[17:07] found after reading that is if I will
[17:10] just position myself in front of the
[17:13] word and of course in the teaching that
[17:16] the Lord has the fivefold ministry and
[17:18] positioned myself in front of this word
[17:20] in in along with the Lord in this which
[17:24] is the word that he is faithful and he's
[17:27] the one who calls me to bring it to pass
[17:29] and so that brought great comfort to me
[17:32] but what I wanted to share today was
[17:35] just that that that date I kind of used
[17:38] this my son is a swimmer and he has been
[17:43] swimming now for five years and he swims
[17:45] six days a week
[17:47] he has tens of thousands of minutes that
[17:51] he has spent before he goes to a swim
[17:54] tournament when he gets to a swim turn
[17:56] tournament excuse me he may only swim
[17:59] ten minutes and he may win a gold medal
[18:02] and that's the date the date of the gold
[18:05] medal and the date of the tournament but
[18:07] really it was those previous six years
[18:09] and tens of thousands of minutes and
[18:12] hours that brought him to that gold
[18:16] medal to that date so I'm not so much
[18:18] looking to try to discern the actual
[18:22] date the August 22nd 2022 was just a
[18:25] date that came out of my mind at that
[18:28] time just as an example but really what
[18:31] it did is it made me take a look and say
[18:35] with that date that I want to be
[18:37] everything I can in the Lord I want to
[18:39] be sanctified spirit soul and body I
[18:42] want to agree with this scripture
[18:44] because I do not see that has been
[18:46] complete yet that has to be completed
[18:49] for those who are alive and remain and
[18:52] so I appreciate you taking the time to
[18:55] listen to me today and I hope this
[18:58] brings encouragement to you
[18:59] and I just want to say God bless you
[19:04] there is a spot at the Lord's chest it's
[19:09] only yours
[19:11] nobody can nudge you out of your place
[19:14] at the trough but you're the only one
[19:17] that can make up your mind to take your
[19:19] place and I hear people so many times
[19:24] saying things like I don't have the time
[19:26] I didn't have time I don't have time I
[19:30] want you to know that at the end of the
[19:33] day it's all you have it's all you do
[19:37] have
[19:40] it's all we have
[19:43] we're waiting on eternity to get close
[19:45] to you we may never go all the way it's
[19:49] in this realm that God has offered us
[19:51] this invitation to lay on his word and
[19:55] let it speak to our hearts
[20:03] [Music]
