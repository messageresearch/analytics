TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope a lord [Music] hello there I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and once again today we are meeting in partnership with the gospel channel and I'm thanking God every day I pray for brother Eric Erickson and the staff of the gospel channel for a long time it has been a burden on my heart that the network not only sustained but that it grow and I believe with your prayer support and with your financial giving I believe that that is a great possibility that we will grow and that we will be able to reach out by satellite even into far other places around the world with this good news that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever people he changes not and he is faithful in all of his ways what he has promised he will perform one of the things that I have learned in serving the Lord this many years is he may not come when you want him but he's right on time we used to have a precious sister in our church who's gone on to be with the Lord now and that was a song that she would often sing he may not come when you want him but he is right on time we learned that our timing is not always the Lord's timing seems like lately so many of you have reached out with your prayer requests and I just want to say thank you thank you for having confidence in us making us your prayer partner with the needs that you have and thank you for believing that God is able to meet your need I believe when you reach out that way I believe it is a sign that you believe that only God can make a difference in your situation I want to apologize to you because there are times that no one is in the office when you call but I want to assure you that your prayer requests what you leave on the answering machine is transcribed and it is immediately entered in to a database where I can look any time day or night wherever I am around the world and see your need and go to the Lord in prayer and I want to thank you for reaching out to us in that way and it does make us feel terrible that we don't have 24 hour a day staff but when we're in the office someone will take your call and if you receive the recording leave as much of your request as you want to is you feel comfortable with it's always good to at least get a first name and perhaps where you're calling from we don't always have to have the other details but it's just a blessing to us to know where you're watching and that you're receiving something we've even had correspondence from Italy and we're thankful that you're able to see the program Ireland across the beautiful British Isles what a blessing it is to have twenty four-hour-a-day Christian programming and I have confidence that God is using the gospel channel and will use it even more in the future as part of his endtime plan thank you for finding us on YouTube for visiting us on our website thank you for downloading the New Hope revival ministries app I'm watching those numbers increase every day and it is so encouraging to me that we are able to put such a resource in your hand where you have access anytime to the programs that we do in partnership with the gospel channel as well as many many other wonderful sermons songs and our new hope moments those little tidbits of inspiration and we just put together the staff did a new one for this week on worship and I have to tell you that it encourages me to know that my worship makes a difference worship is of course giving God honor and praise and love but we also become the beneficiaries when we enter into heartfelt praise and worship I've heard it said by many people through the years when the praises go up the blessings come down and so check that out if you haven't already you can download the app from your App Store on whatever platform you use we have people that have downloaded the app on Apple TV and on roku you can subscribe to the youtube channel you can visit our website revival dot o-r-g the prayer request line the number is given to you on the screen we want to be in contact we want to read your emails we want to hear your prayer requests and we want to partner with you these are exciting times I mean that it's not just a line from me I see that there is tragedy on every hand here in our area just a few miles from my home we just recently had devastating tornados and 23 people including children lost their lives some of the most devastating storms that we have ever had in our area in my lifetime those tornadoes where they did the most damage and where lives were lost struck about 12 miles from my home but before that torn it was through it had swept a path of over sixty miles and at one point was less than three miles from my home four miles from the church where I'm sitting right now we experienced the marvelous grace of the Lord but our hearts have been broken for those who lost so much even in the midst of that kind of tragedy there has been such inspiration it seems like that if you can find a way to give God praise even in the bad times it releases something there was a precious precious little woman miss Ernestine who lost everything and sitting on the the slab of where her home had sat we later found out with a broken hip she was speaking to a loved one a grandson I think it was who was very concerned he was away at college it seems to me like I might have read that he was the first person in their family to go off to college like that I may be wrong but he was concerned and she was speaking to him on the phone and she was saying to him calling him by his nickname and saying you thank God you hear me you thank God and when she was told in this little video clip that her neighbor had also lost her home she said we have to thank God we have to give God praise seven members of that one family lost their lives but that little video of that precious mother grandmother went all over the world and her message was clear we've got to thank God we've got to give God praise and honor and glory even when the circumstances are dark when our pain is great and the loss is bigger than we can comprehend at the moment in all things oh I feel something when I say that in all things we must give thanks I'm sure that many of you will be familiar with the scriptures and the story from the Bible the son of David this son who was conceived in less than ideal circumstances a product of sin rebellion and he is near to death David is fasting and praying he won't even wash his face he is in supplication before the Lord calling for the life asking for grace and mercy to be shown to his son when a messenger a servant knocks on the door to tell David we are sorry but your son has slipped away he's gone the Bible tells us that David got up and washed his face and prepared to eat a meal and he said these most famous words these words have been spoken at grave sites all over the world in committal services when we are saying goodbye to loved ones the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and I know that it's easy to make a statement like that when your heart is not broken but when your heart is broken when you have lost so much it becomes it's one of those what we have sometimes called a rubber meets the road when you are right in the middle of pain and you have lost so much in fact like miss Ernestine she didn't even know what all she had lost yet but what she knew was this I've got to thank the Lord he has spared my life he is a good god he is a faithful God he never makes a mistake we don't have to like everything that happens to us in life but we have to believe if we are truly a believer we have to believe that God can get glory he can get amazing results from something that looks absolutely so catastrophic so damaging life-changing that nothing good not one little ray of sunshine could come out of it but oh my in this local tragedy these storms that we're mentioning I have heard testimony after testimony of how people have come to be able to give God praise I heard of a family who lost a precious beautiful little girl literally snatched from her parents arms into the storm and in the in the funeral service stood a dad at the time of music when they were singing a song of praise to the Lord a week dad a trembling dad a heartbroken dad stood to his feet with his arms in the air praising God thanking God for the time that he had had with this precious daughter beside him also a mother thanking God saying whatever happens God is good and God is right and he will get glory for his name when I hear those testimonies it strengthens me it encourages me to keep moving forward and knowing that in the darkness there is some light faith in the Lord Jesus Christ I heard many of those loved ones interviewed survivors some of them of the storm and as they were being interviewed able to speak able to answer the questions some of them moments after things had settled down and there was that consistent theme that ran through all of those interviews how have you made it thus far how are you making it right now and so many of them said it is because of my faith in God I don't know how this is going to turn out I don't know how we're going to rebuild I don't know how we're gonna move forward without our loved ones but we have faith in the Living God oh my doesn't it make your heart break for those who have no such hope for those who do not trust that there is even a god and if they believe in some higher power they have yet to see that he is good let me decree to you let me declare to you today around the world whether you're watching this on the television or whether you're streaming and on the internet watching it on youtube or the app however I'm coming to you right now let me declare that God is a good god and he is a faithful God and he will be as close to you in your good time in your hard time in your painful time as you will allow him to be it's so tragic that's so often when people are hurting they push ever in one away including God I want to pray today for you I want to believe that whatever you are going through right now that you will somehow find grace find strength to allow the Lord to draw close to you he wants to draw you if you can possibly find the courage to run to him let me encourage you to do that because there is no more faithful friend than the Lord Jesus Christ he has been a friend to me my parents divorced I think I've shared some of this with you when I was just five years old and I have grown up without the consistency of a father in my life but I want you to know I have had a father I've had a good good Heavenly Father who has stood by me when I was at my best and who has refused to leave me when I was at my worst if you don't know that God you've got to know him you need to know him you must know him I don't know how you've made it this far without him but I'm telling you you have suffered needlessly alone there is no reason for any of us to suffer alone because we have had a suffering Savior as I say a prophesied he was wounded not because of anything that he had done wrong himself but he bore my sin he became sin on my behalf wounded for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with His stripes I can be healed that's the love that God has for you today if you have never invited the Lord Jesus Christ into your life if you have never pended of your sins by saying God I am sorry for the life that I have lived apart from you I have most surely transgressed all of your laws broken your Commandments lived for myself and for my family but not lived for you forgive me of my sins I want the blood that you shed at Calvary to speak for me I want that blood to cover my iniquity I want that blood to cover my pain my sorrow my heartache my bitterness my envy whatever it is that it's consuming me I feel like there are people watching this program today and please understand my expression it is as though you are being eaten from the inside out the problems of sin the effects of your pain has become like a cancer emotionally and you're being destroyed from the inside out and it does not have to be so I tell you in the name of the Lord it does not have to be so you don't have to live a miserable life no matter what your circumstances are because there is a love that conquers all the love that God has for you how do you know preacher that God loves me because I believe his word and because I have watched him through the years love the unlovable in fact he has loved me in some of my unlovable moments but there are some of you who have really never lived a life that was pleasing to him or according to his word and even in that rebellion he loved you and he has kept you from things perhaps that you are naughty aware of to bring you forward to a moment like this when you would be able to surrender your will that's the hardest part it's really not that hard to believe in a living God there's no other explanation for where we are today I cannot possibly believe that if things are left alone by themselves they improve I have to believe what I have observed in my own life if you don't maintain it it deteriorates the world that we live in as sick as it feels sometime we have seen such advances in technology in medicine in in the ability of man and woman to live longer than they have ever lived before I believe by a knowledge imparted by God I believe okay if you want to believe in a Big Bang as the origin for the earth I can go along with that with you as long as you see it this way I believe that God spoke that created the exposure necessary to create the world that we are living in this earth as we know it is here by the spoken word of God that creative word that came out of his mouth that's why we're where we are today and he keeps us and strengthens us and watches over for God so loved in this world that He gave His only begotten Son if you understand the scripture that means that God Himself condescended stepped out of eternity and into a body of flesh in a dimension of time that he could minister the love of the Father and demonstrate and display there is a better life oh yes there is a better life so if you have never invited the Lord Jesus into your life to forgive you of your sins to wash you in his Precious Blood I want you to do that now I believe that God is giving you an opportunity to call on him right now it doesn't have to be a churchy prayer it doesn't have to be a poetic prayer you can just pray god save me I'm lost I'm in trouble I have little hope and I need you you mean to tell me that God would respond to a prayer like that absolutely all I want you to know that religion has complicated our approach to God and the church has often told us we have to jump through this hoop and we have to perform this ceremony in order to approach God well I want you to know that the God I've given my life to the Savior who is such an important part of my life it's not requiring me in my moment of need to take out a paper and and and tick off the different points of of protocol he's as close as the mention of his name if all you knew to do was Jesus have mercy on me he will it's that simple then you say well then I I would have to live a different life yes and you can't do that alone you can never get good enough by yourself that is why he has offered you his righteousness his holiness his perfection when we invite Jesus into our life and we surrender our will we quit fighting against God's will for us he gives us his righteousness his holiness his perfection and he gives us strength and power and grace to walk in what he has provided I'm telling you the blood of Jesus and the grace of God has provided everything you need not only to secure a home for all eternity in the presence of God but he has provided what we need in this hour to get through the kind of life the kind of world that we're living in today where there is so much hate there is so much prejudice there is so much misunderstanding and things seem to be getting worse immorality worse absolute rebellion against how God has created us and what His Word has instructed us and it gets darker and it gets bigger and it gets bolder every day but in that confusion and in that chaos there is hope hope is found in a relationship with Jesus Christ I want to pray with you right now this is an entirely different order for our program but I want to pray for you right now and I want to believe that if you willfully surrender your heart to him that you will take it by faith it's not going to be by a feeling I hope that when you sincerely pray you will feel better but if you should feel no change that's when your faith has to begin to work right away there may be no honeymoon period for you you may have to apply your faith today you may have to believe that though you don't feel it it different and nothing looks much different you may have to leave that it is different simply because God's Word said so because you have chosen to make Jesus the Lord of your life pray with me right now would you Father we come to you in the name of your son Jesus Christ we are so thankful and so grateful for your life the life that you lived for us the death that you died for us and the resurrection that you stepped up into for us we are so thankful that you have paid the price for all of our sin for all of our iniquity for all of our transgression and we repent right now we have been wronged we have been rebellious we have chosen our own life but today Lord we want to acknowledge that you are Lord of all we want to make you the director of our footsteps we want you to help us because we are needy but we want to serve you because you are worthy Lord I pray that whatever binds people's lives whatever spirits seem to control them keep them in rebellion and perversion I pray today in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ even Yeshua our Messiah that those spiritual powers of darkness will be broken that lives will be set free that every hindering spirit would be driven from their life and that they would emerge born again born anew even as you spoke to Nicodemus telling him that he could not enter a second time into his mother's womb he was to be born of the Spirit I pray right now that men and women will be born of the spirit as they ask you invite you to come into their life in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we take you at your word and we call it done and we express our love for you Lord if there are those who prayed this prayer with me they're going to need you they're going to need your help they're going to need your direction and I ask you to come alongside of them now let them feel and more importantly let them know that they can be and they are a new creature today because they have surrendered their will and they have been washed in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ we ask these things in that lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen if you prayed that prayer with me I would very much like to know it you may call the prayer line you can send an email you can message us and let us know you can visit us on Facebook even let us know that you prayed this prayer because I want to have our intercessors our prayer warriors praying because it won't be easy this conversion this this experience with God is costly because all of Hell wants to keep you in a rut I tell you the devil will never just lay over and play dead and let you and I live a victorious glorious life in Jesus Christ he will as I say sometime huff and puff and try to blow the house down every day but greater is he that is now in you than he that is in the world I want to speak to Christians to those of you who have given your life to the Lord you have surrendered to the Lord and and yet you are not finding the grace to live a life victory you feel bound you feel oppressed you feel tormented I want you to know you must not give up you must keep pressing in to Christ every answer to every problem the direction for every situation that you face right now is only found in knowing him the answers can be found by the spirit in the Word of God this precious book that he has given us so I want to pray for your encouragement today I want to believe that God will inspire you I pray that you'll hear the little testimony of this precious grandmother loosing everything and yet encouraging everybody around her and now she's encouraging the whole world by video thank God honey give God thanks and I want to inspire you with that today I want you to know that there is great deliverance in giving God thanks in maintaining an attitude of gratitude by finding the God in every dark situation he's there he's there we used to sing a hymn when I was young standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus I remember one time a dear old brother was offended by that song he said what do you mean Jesus standing in the shadows Jesus is light and wherever light light is where Jesus is light he is so he's never standing in the shadows now I had to read the words of the song to the brother and let him know that there are times that he is not front and sinner there are times that he is standing back allowing us to continue sometimes on a course that is not best for us but he is patiently waiting he is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother and if you are willing to call him forth out of the shadows out of that place of sort of withdrawing for a span of time and allowing us to see what a mess we can make without his help all we have to do is invite him back standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus he's a friend who always cares and understands when you need him call on him so I want to pray again I want to pray for every Christian fighting this good fight of faith you have been through some stuff you are fighting depression oppression discouragement I want to ask the Lord today to give you great grace and strength let's pray together father we approach you again in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ this time I'm pray for my brothers and sisters Lord those who have trusted you with their life some of them having called on your name 3040 years ago but the circumstances of their life have pressed the Miam and the enemy has brought a wave of discouragement against them and so today I join my faith with theirs today virtually we become prayer partners I'm on one side of the pond and they are on the other but today Lord we recognize there is no distance in prayer so we pray right now you are the glory and the lifter of my head you are the glory and the lifter of their heads so I ask you to come to their rescue I pray for inspiration and anointing to be upon them today to give God thanks to give you praise to give you honor and glory even in this time of uncertainty for Lord I have watched you raise us up when we came back to praise I have watched you raise us up out of the dark places when we begin to thank you for the faithfulness that you have shown in our lives I pray right now that you would touch and encourage the believer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen I'd like to hear from you I'd like for you to let us know that you're taking God today at his word you're going to accept and receive his encouragement open up your Bible and ask the Lord to speak to you from his word I recently told our church that it ought to almost be illegal to open up the Bible without prayer just whisper a quick prayer I'm going to read the word today Lord I'm looking to your word would you direct me would you reveal your word to me I don't want to just read as a discipline I want to read even as an act of worship and I want to approach your word knowing that you've got answers for every question that I have so take this encouragement from the Lord and go forward he is a savior he is an encourage or he is a healer if you are sick in body today he paid the price he knows how there is nothing too big for God to heal it can be something as simple as an ingrown fingernail or as severe as cancer and I have seen the Lord I wished I could tell you that I have always watched him reverse every disease and he'll every person that we ever prayed for but I can't say that I believe God heard the prayer I believe that God moved because we prayed in many many ways but there are times that God has a plan he wants to get glory he wants to bring other people to salvation through the attitude through the approach that a believer has Paul and Silas sang praises not licking their wounds but giving God praise in spite of their hardship we have so many glorious examples in the Bible and I want you to know that to the righteous death is not the end as the Lord calls us and we make that transition we make it into an eternity with him it is a healing it is certainly the end of a chapter on earth and the beginning of stepping out of the dimension of time into the dimension of eternity you really believe that yes I really believe that there is more for us over there than there is over here if we can just keep pressing toward that praising the Lord as we go but because I've lost loved ones to death that I asked the Lord to heal it doesn't make me doubt it doesn't cost me not to pray for healing because I have seen God even raised the dead that's the god I serve I've seen cancers tumors fall off of people's bodies blind eyes open deaf ears unstopped I've seen the crippled get up and walk again those paralyzed even from a broken spine I've seen the Lord reverse every decree of death against someone's body and give them glorious healing so I know yes I know that he is a healer and so if things don't happen every time the way I would like to see them happen I can't lose my faith I'm speaking to someone right now you didn't get the answer you were looking for and it has really thrown you for a loop but I want to encourage you keep believing go to God with the next situation don't allow something that didn't turn out the way you wanted it to turn out hoped it would turn out needed it to turn out don't allow that to keep you from believing again God always has a sovereign plan well he had one today because I had no idea I have a message that I wanted to bring and I had no idea that God was going to turn this around to speak to you so directly and offer prayer but I feel like we should pray now for those who need healing he is that healer oh my I've seen his healing hand in my own body how he has brought me through confounded even the doctor at times I've had the doctor look at me and pronounce something over my life and my doctor knows I'm a believer and he has looked at me and said all I'm doing is giving you something to go pray about I know you're not going to do everything I tell you but I know you'll take this to God in prayer and I do and he's a healer oh my he's a healer I've got a church full of people who know the healing power of God I want to pray for you right now reach your faith toward the Lord let's agree this is not about me praying for you and you just receiving this is about us believing together when two or more agree as touching on any one thing there's such power in that agreement of faith so let's believe right now father we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to ask for healing to ask for deliverance of every symptom Lord we have at times been disappointed with what has happened in our body waiting for healing the enemy trying to keep us from believing but today we declare that you are Jehovah Rapha the Lord our God who healeth all of our diseases you are the suffering Savior who paid the price with your own body stripes on your own back for healing and in the name of Jesus and in the authority of our Messiah we just come against disease and we come against infirmity and we come against all those symptoms that that try to harass us and Lord we ask for healing to be manifested we pray right now for those suffering with high blood pressure and those suffering with sugar diabetes and those who are suffering with with with such swelling and water retention in their body we pray right now for those who suffer with migraine headaches but lord headaches these headaches can be so severe but you are the healer we pray for those who have gotten bad reports from the doctor some of them pronouncing a sentence of death and yet Lord we know that we can live until you get ready to call us so we ask right now that there would be a manifested healing in the body of the believer right now hallelujah that you would turn this thing around for the glory of God for tumors to disappear we ask right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may they sure away and disappear and be gone because you are such a good god and a faithful healer we just believe Lord right now even for those who are watching this program who have loved ones in the hospital we pray that you will strengthen their faith and that you will give them courage to go to that hospital and lay hands on their loved ones and ask for this same healing blessing may they be used as ambassadors of your healing virtue we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah he men and a man I believe and there's one step I think you cannot skip I want you to give God praise I want you to thank him well I'm embarrassed to do that don't you be embarrassed even in your own home to lift up your hands and say Lord thank you for healing my body I take you at your word I believe that I am healed because your word says that you are the healer and I am tapping into that and I want to thank you and praise you and glorify your name if I would have had the opportunity to move into my text I'll do that the next time we meet I was going to talk about a change we know that there must be a change coming I believe that God is more able to execute change in our lives then than anything else the Lord has been talking to us in our group our church community about a new season upon us God is such a caring and loving God on an individual basis he doesn't just love us as a nation or love us as a church group he loves us as individuals and there are things every one of our lives there are things in every one of your lives that God wants to bring change about the the faith having the faith is so important faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen if we can see it it doesn't take faith when we are believing God we are reaching into that unseen realm and pulling the answer back pulling the result back knowing that God is one who can I mean change things even suddenly I believe that God wants you and I to be the change I believe that we are called and appointed to be agents of change in fact I believe that it is part of our ministry as believers we have a priesthood ministry and part of that priesthood ministry is to speak life it's easy to speak death it's easy to speak judgment but it takes some grace it takes some help from the Lord to speak life into situations again that look so unchangeable impossible we have been looking at God's Word and examining the importance of walking in the right season knowing what season you're in what God wants to do for you in this particular season and then asking for his anointing to be upon you in your life his fresh oil to be upon you as you walk out what it is that God would have you to walk out right now I hope my language is not good using to you because the scripture is clear everything has a season Ecclesiastes chapter three verse one says for everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven he goes on to say a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep a time to laugh a time to mourn it goes on everything in our life has an appointed time and the only thing that helps us synchronize synchronize our lives the only thing that helps us synchronize our lives to that timing or season or purpose of the Lord is prayer walking in prayer I've had people ask me you preach so strongly brother Shelly on the sovereignty of God doesn't that negate the need for prayer oh absolutely not because prayer is not about getting God to change his mind prayer is about discovering what is on the mind of God to discover his thoughts now I know what this situation is making me feel and I know what I'm thinking going through this trial but I would like to discover what God's thoughts are Lord what are you thinking about where I'm walking right now and that is what prayer helps us to do to align ourselves first of all we're saying God I trust you I trust you no matter how it feels I trust you but I would like to know a little bit about what this is about could you just give me a clue what what's going on so that I can pray more effect Tivoli and live more effectively according to your purpose and your plan that's what I'm talking about and and we've just got the tools we have got the tools prayer and praise and worship and approaching God's Word in a very mindful purposeful way like we mentioned a few moments ago this is what we need to help us discover the times and the seasons of the Lord in our life just one quick example you know if you are a gardener and we'll mention this again I'm sure when we meet again but there is a season to plant certain things not not everything is to be planted at the same time if you have all four seasons like we do in Alabama sometimes they're pretty short some of them but you you recognize that there are certain vegetables that thrive in the cold weather we we have cold weather but we don't have the the inches and inches of snow and and weeks and weeks of below freezing temperatures like a lot of places do so we are able to to plant vegetables at a certain time of the year and begin to harvest them in the in the fall in the autumn and up even toward the winter we can harvest for instance kale and broccoli and and what we call winter vegetables well you've got to plant them in the right season and then we have other summer vegetables like tomatoes and corn and cucumbers and we can't plant them at the same season that we plant winter vegetables we plant them as soon as the frost is over right about now we plant them in the ground because there is a certain period even the little pack of seed will tell you how long is the germination process by average and it will tell you and you've got to plant it according to that you you you don't put your to make seed in the ground today and expect to go tomorrow and eat tomatoes there is a process and it is so in the spirit the natural types the spiritual and we are to discover through prayer through devotion what season are we in you don't want to be trying to shovel snow in the summertime you want to be shoveling snow when there's snow to shovel so to speak you want to be enjoying the outdoors in the spring and in the summer and in the fall you want to plan your family picnic in the right season you don't want to plan your family picnic in January if there's three feet of snow on the ground so in the same way we would do it in the natural we learn to live life in the spiritual by asking the Lord where am I what is the next step well brother Shelly do we always get answers immediately to these questions no I wish so I wish we did but it doesn't always happen that way and again it's in that moment that trust faith has to kick in and be strong Lord I trust you and I'm just going to keep walking along until you answer until you show me what the next step is but I'll tell you what I do know change is inevitable and what you're going through right now you may feel like it is forever but I want to encourage you by saying this season whatever it is it didn't come to stay it came to pass and it will pass and you need to be able to make the change with it there is a time to pray asking God to do certain things in our lives and there's a time to thank him for what he has done in the last season and reached forward believing that we're on a journey we're move somewhere we're headed toward eternity and every step on the way matters every bend in the road every turn in the road matters so the main thing is to keep journeying on keep pressing on keep the faith let's encourage one another let's know that everything we need to fight the good fight of faith to persevere till the end we have it if we have received the truth of God's Word which enables us to be candidates to receive the Holy Ghost that is the very life of Jesus Christ living on the inside of us and I'm telling you we need that we need that when things are going good and we need that when things are going bad people ask the question do you need the Holy Ghost to go to heaven and I say you need the Holy Ghost to go to Walmart you need the Holy Ghost to go up on the high street and purchase what you need and so if you have never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost God's life inside of you I encourage you to keep praying and keep believing and I also encourage you to obey God's Word repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I believe that so the next time we're together we'll talk a little bit more about a season of change and we'll see where the Lord takes us god bless you I hope you're encouraged bye bye for today [Music]
