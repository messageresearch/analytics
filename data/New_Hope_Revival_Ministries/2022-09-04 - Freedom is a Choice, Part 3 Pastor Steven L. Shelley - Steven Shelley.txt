oh he's so wonderful he is so faithful we're so thankful for you being here today and as brother greeley told you there are quite a few who are unable to be with us but uh perhaps some are streaming but we are so glad that you are here and we're more than glad that the presence of the lord is here i've been feeling him it's not about feeling him you know we we we go through times where we may not he's real anyway but isn't it wonderful isn't it wonderful to feel the quickening of his presence know that he's a resurrected lord and that he lives forevermore we just want to thank god for every streamer there are many of you who are streaming this service from trinidad from norway from indiana arizona from israel uh from india god bless you from indiana again let's see cape town south africa united kingdom that's all on youtube so we thank god for all of those and then there's a host of people who are streaming in other places on the app we have we have had 3011 downloads of the app so that means that 3 000 people that's that's big for us it's just a small number in the world but for us that's a big number how many of you'd like to see at 5 000 before the year's over that means they're walking around with access to everything that we put out and not only our our services here but also many many recordings of brother branham which would be a great blessing to people to listen to today singing is on there there's just some wonderful things uh our youtube subscribers are picking up our facebook likes and and follows somebody said does any of that really matter it really matters it really matters because it's one of the ways that we can reach out we used to do everything through snail mail and we have we have files and files to prove the tens of thousands of cassette tapes that went out of this place through the years did you know that before this month is over i will celebrate 32 years as the pastor of this church and in those 32 years we have sent tens perhaps hundreds of thousands of sermons to almost every nation and every continent in the world that is the grace of god and the testimonies fill those filing cabinets down in the office and today we don't communicate through snail mail very much we get a few little uh tithe checks from uh some of our streamers come in the mail every now and again we get a letter from somewhere else in the world i had a wonderful package come this week let me get it don't go anywhere i'll be right back it's not too far i got pretty excited to get mail we have plenty of bills that come in the mailbox out there and a few checks but more bills than anything so i was real excited to open up this package and it is all the way from japan and i'm not going to be able to tell you anything but that can't pronounce the names of the places and the cities i can pronounce sister emiko because we know her wakatsuki wakatsuki uh she came all the way from japan many years ago with sister fusay her daughter to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and so she sent me a gift and it's a token because i can't read anything but the cover but this is sister fusay's first novel in japanese it doesn't even look greek to me it looks japanese it looks like that the words go up and down instead of a cross and it says a christian novel to pastor stephen shelley thank you for your faithful prayer and sister fousey has signed her name and there was a letter in here let's see if i can find the letter how many of you'd like to hear a letter from sister emiko she didn't give us permission to read it but we'll we'll ask forgiveness later now i don't know if you all know this or not but sister emiko has a business and she designs cards and stationary and her character being japanese her character is that elephant you see that and she does quite well i think with uh this little character that she has come up with and she uses that so let me read this to you shalom i wish i could have fluent lips that could speak as holy spirit shows me but reality is my lips are heavy only when worshipping my tongue can cut loose and speak unknown tongues which nobody can understand anyway i want you to know how i thank you and your ministry and your worship team i make it a very important i make it very important to stream sunday and tuesday service your meetings are life source to me and they are special because you respect israel and the worship flows like ruth hefflin experienced i read the glory book many times and your message is fresh truth which nourishes me i must thank again sister nancy bergen for having introduced me to your ministry by streaming i have been worshiping the lord in the midnight hours of mondays and wednesdays since 2005. now that's a long time to be connected isn't it from 2005 since i left the pentecostal church i have not had so many experiences of corporate worship but i do worship him sincerely and i believe i'm sowing into heaven god has blessed me with my family and my work i lived alone after fusee married but soon she returned with koya and ibuki now my house is loud and busy and lots of laughters and loving cares it doesn't sound like she's complaining to me as for fousey how much i thank you and your ministry team my heart was heavy with appreciation but couldn't utter the words of which i'm sorry she was raised in a church but i wanted her to encounter god so i depended on your ministry i thought kendra was a key girl to let her to the circle at the ministry and thank god that fousey was willing to obey the lord and now she is how much i thank your ministry including your youth camps and even bridal showers fousey is a bookworm she has devoured mountains of books and produced a book which i'm enclosing it's a story about a girl who is raised in a christian family tried to deny god and go wild but gradually she realized the hand of god caught her whenever she would fall and gradually she realized god is real and was baptized in the name of yeshua i now i know you cannot read it but as a fruit of your effort of arranging for a japanese girl to meet yeshua i want you to keep it you don't have to reply to this letter don't worry about not being able to broadcast all the meetings because we had some problems with the stream i will catch up with the meetings somehow sister emiko let's give god praise for that it means a lot god used sister nancy bergin living in jerusalem he allowed us to take the message to her and we baptized her in columbus she flew all the way from jerusalem to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then she took her 20 00 20 000 people on her email list and she sent the messages of truth from this place to 20 000 people around the world and sister emiko was one of those people one out of twenty thousand she heard the truth of being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and arranged to bring her and her daughter all the way from japan to be baptized in his name i'm telling you that's desperation and now god has blessed them and uh sister fousey has a wonderful husband and a beautiful little handsome boy and they're serving the lord together sister fousey is interpreting the message of brother branham into the japanese language at times now for printing purposes and now has written this novel and we don't know how god is going to continue what he's going to do but he's going to continue to use them there and they don't have any support from us we have never even been able to make a visit to japan to encourage them they get everything they get just like you do from the service from streaming the service but god is faithful and he's helping people and we're so thankful for that let me do this real quick before we go to the word uh i don't think that all the birthdays were mentioned last week and so last sunday sister martha west had a birthday sister flo on monday sister fousey on wednesday sister beth polk on thursday paul west on friday and then jennifer stark sister anna miller ezekiel joseph had a birthday on friday brother josh and sister hope had their wedding anniversary five-year wedding anniversary on friday and he wasn't in town uh this week on wednesday sister deborah gossman has a birthday who is one of our very faithful streamers and also this coming friday september the 9th is the 32nd anniversary of my grandmother going home to be with the lord and me coming home to pastor the church so 32 years have flown by before the month is over i'll celebrate 47 years of full-time ministry and you know what i'm looking forward to these next days with great anticipation perhaps more than i've ever had in my entire life i sat here this morning in the in the atmosphere of god's glory and i said it's a wonderful thought to know that our greatest days are upon us they're upon us what god is doing right now and what what listen uh after years of of little growth just maintaining and doing the best we can for outreach in in 10 months god has added 20 faithful people to this church to this assembly you know that's outstanding for a church of what used to be 80 people i want to give god praise for that it started with the minkos it started with the minko family and they began to drive and we waited every sunday to see if they'd be back if they missed a sunday we went to praying afraid that we'd offended them in some way and then they have become very faithful and they make quite a sacrifice to do it the next thing you know we get this mysterious email from someone in florida very mysterious i'm trying to figure out who is this brother and why is he asking simple questions like this and the next thing you know about the end of the year brother reed became a part of our church and what a sacrifice he makes to drive almost four hours every weekend to be with us that's the grace of god and then we had this immigration from the west i said immigration not invasion there's a difference and they began to come and today celebrates number 20. because brother josh's mother precious sister claudia she's number 20. and we're looking for 21 and 22 and 23 as god is putting together a team here he is he's building a people here hallelujah deliverance is going to be our theme he spoke to us 30 years ago and he said there'll be a word of deliverance go forth from this place that shakes nations well we don't see how that's hardly possible in our natural abilities but it's him he's the one that multiplies and he's the one that anoints and he's the one that does outstanding things i want to announce to you also that uh this i wrote everything down but the dates on on saturday night of this month let's see uh that would be you want to write this down on on the the 24th is that right honey i know i'm looking for the saturday 24th and 25th saturday night and sunday morning brother dwayne jackson will be with us from north carolina and we're having a little little group a little something for uh some of the young couples on friday night like we did last year but we're announcing to the whole body that there will be a service here uh youth you know youth driven but for everyone saturday night at seven o'clock we usually meet at six on saturday night but we will meet at seven o'clock saturday night the 24th of september and brother dwayne jackson will be preaching that night and he'll be preaching again sunday morning and guess what we get to meet their brand new miracle baby god has given them a real miracle and they have been so precious to thank those who have prayed for them through the years and they were so kind to let stacey and i be a part of the whole process and give us updates and and when they when they finally found out that god had performed this miracle they they called us on a conference call and you know that made us feel a part of what god had done in their life and i can't hardly wait to meet baby liam we're going to have a wonderful uh weekend not only for the young people but for everybody we are having camp meeting those dates are october the 11th through the 16th october the 11th through the 16th it appears right now that brother brooks may not unless something changes or shifts he may not be able to be with us but don't you worry there will be singing there will be preaching there will be shouting on the old campground so don't worry just put it in his hands that's what we've done and god will bring who he wants when he wants he'll do what he wants and that's what we're after are you with me don't go to sleep yet let's stand thank you to the musicians i talk too much to sing now but god bless you [Applause] it's hard on us when both the guitar the bass player and the drummer are gone but brother josh just slides over he just slides over and brother and benjamin goes to the drums and leads from the drums and god makes away doesn't he and because he's adding to the numbers we can have a few missing and it doesn't feel quite as hopeless as it used to we just get in here and have church anyway thank you for praying for us we had a wonderful holiday we uh love we love it i didn't used to love it i married someone who loves the sand i didn't like sand i didn't like the ocean too much i like to watch it on nature videos uh i grew up watching jacques cousteau anybody even know who that is i well i grew up watching marlon what was his name perkins or whatever his name was with mutual of omaha's wild kingdom i enjoyed observing the world through through the television screen as a kid never really cared about the ocean because or the beach because there are so many naked people that like to go down there you know and we just found out if you plan your trip and go a little bit off season you can almost have it to yourself we spent one whole day and there was 12 people within sight that's all i could see from a d and i said this is the life god did that for us because just the week before they said it was so crowded you couldn't even find a spot what do you do you sit and then you sit some more and then you drink a dr pepper and you sit some more and you read and the ocean was was pancake flat and you don't get that often i mean pancake flat so flat that i could walk out to my shoulders and look down in the water and no don't need goggles didn't need special glasses you can see the bottom we could you could see fish we saw a manatee come by that's quite a sight they're big we saw a sea turtle we saw shark we saw all kinds of fish and i i knelt down in the sand one day and just enjoyed the waves and uh felt something pinched me really hard on the knee i screamed like a woman they come with a net and pulled up the biggest old blue crab about the biggest one i've ever seen and i i wanted to look at his pictures and see if part of my knee was there but we just had a wonderful time doing nothing and and what i like to eat fish but i don't like it anywhere that that's not within a shouting distance of the water it comes out of you know you you can't go brother joshilano found out you can't order a fish sandwich here in columbus by the time it gets here it's hardly fish but when you can eat it right in the right in the area brother reed came up and we had had a nice fellowship with him anyway you don't need to hear every detail very little shopping very little entertain in very little of anything but just resting god is good second corinthians chapter 10 verse 4 through six i was able to keep my word to my family they asked me to promise that unless there was an emergency i wouldn't take any phone calls or make any phone calls i did a whole lot of texting they didn't mention that but i didn't take or make any phone calls for a week and that's probably the first week in my life i don't remember a time ever that that was that way but i promised my kids and uh and and i was able by the grace of god to keep my promise he took care of you brother greeley did some mighty fine preaching sunday and tuesday night and i'm thankful that we didn't have to worry about anything all right we're back to where we were the sunday before i left i want to finish this message this morning for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal you can't make them carnal they're not between you and i they're bigger than you and i our weapons are mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holes every one of them casting down imaginations in every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled can the church say amen second corinthians 2 11 very quickly let's go lest satan should get an advantage of us for we let's read it together for we are not ignorant of his devices we've fought him before we know his tricks can you say amen second corinthians 11 verse 1 through 4 would to god you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for i am jealous over you the apostle paul said i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ this was the responsibility of the first church age messenger and every church age messenger that would follow it's the responsibility of every pastor every apostle every prophet every pastor excuse me every teacher every evangelist it's a responsibility of every ministering brethren to make sure that let's go back to make sure that we are helping to prepare a bride that we may help see that bride presented to christ as a chaste virgin one who is untouched unadulterated by the teachings of man a pure word bride how many of you know there's a difference in a church and a pure word a church bride that's not what he's looking for he's looking for a pure word bride but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ and one more while you're while you're there uh ii corinthians 3 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty father we come to you right now and we thank you that you have been with us through this service thank you for your anointing thank you for the precious presence of the lord that has been here and now we have received the offering and we have greeted the birthday and we've done all those little things that we like to do we lay all that behind us now and we approach the reason why we're here we didn't come just to feel you we came to hear your voice we came to honor the living word of god and here we stand in need of a clear word we need a clear message that comes from your word so we take authority over every demonic power every distracting spirit of hell and we push you back through the authority of jesus christ and we call on the lord to come and anoint our ears to hear the living word and to anoint your servant to be only a pipeline that your word may i not bring any opinion to the table but may i just open my mouth as you ask of me so many years ago and let you fill it with your life-giving word and then when we're done we will give you the glory and all the honor and all the praise for anything that is accomplished today to god be the glory we ask for this help in the name of the lord jesus christ and for his glory only amen and the church said you may be seated freedom is a choice it's a choice jesus did everything that could possibly be done that needed to be done to set us free from the law of sin and death he paid an ultimate price he did everything that the law required to be done he didn't just shed the lamb's blood he shed god's blood god that had specifically designed a blood that could redeem mankind throughout all the ages you and i are the beneficiaries of something that we don't deserve that's why it's amazing grace we don't understand it we know every day that we don't deserve it but we realize that god has given it to us anyway why because he loved us we know that we didn't choose him until he had already chosen us where do you get that the bible said you have not chosen me but i have chosen you says the lord we understand that no man has ever sought god at any time by his own mind if a man or woman has ever sought god it's because god was seeking after that man or woman he found you right where you were how many of you're glad you didn't have to come up to where he was he reached way below the bottom and met you in your sin if you can say a man do found you right where you were some of you he found you in some mighty rough places but he found you nonetheless and he didn't just leave you he stayed with you and hovered around you and called your name and pulled on your heart whispered in your ear protected you from death the very reason some of you are here today is because god kept you from death that he might have time to redeem you and present you as that chaste virgin that the word is making us in this hour we're being purified by the word the very stain of sin is being erased and what the curse has brought into our lives we are now seeing it reversed by the living word the earth around us is living under the weight and the load of the curse but the bride of jesus christ is coming out from under that curse and the world is getting worldlier and sicker and in more trouble but the bride is becoming more like her bridegroom every day that we live how is that possible not by watching television all the time you spend all your time in front of the idiot box and you'll end up being one can anybody say amen even talk radio will pickle your brain there's only one thing that'll make you more like christ and that's the word we're not just faced with a dead letter but we have a living word and this living word is more than a sermon he is a person and his name is the lord jesus christ he has broken every chain every fetter he has power to set every captive free he has blown the silver trumpet of the jubilee so that every slave who can hear the voice of the trumpet it's not just a sign that god sends to us but with every god-sent sign there is a voice and only a little bride can seem to discern the voice that is in the trumpet there's a voice in the seals there's a voice in the church ages there's a voice in the thunders it's god speaking to his bride in these last days calling us to come higher telling us church is not the answer telling us are you with me telling us religion is not the answer there's only one answer and that's a relationship with jesus christ not twice a week every single day of the week every single day of the month a close relationship with him i think it sometimes baffles minds to find out that you can have that kind of a walk with him where he walks with you and talks with you and deals with you every single day of your life but he does somebody said i know i'm not experiencing that it's not his fault who's going to blame the lord we're going to blame ourselves and we're going to say we have filled our minds with so many things computer games and pornographies and all the things that that fill us up so there's no room for a relationship with jesus christ people sometimes come and complain because our services are long but they'll sit through one of those eternal football games there's nothing any more disgustingly boring than all of those people falling down all the time i've watched a few with my voice in the past thank god we're almost at a place where we don't have to do anything like that now and i said look we could be done with this they're playing games with us this thing could be over with but they keep falling down pulling one another down and those little black and white stripes you know hulking their horns and blowing their whistles and throwing their red flags and orange flags and yellow flags just drawing it out and if you if you didn't see it the first time don't worry they're gonna show it to you five more times before the next play they've even got cameras down on the field in the cones in the cones how do you know because i was watching one time and one got kicked over and the cameras flipping through the air and they're in a hurry to turn it back to a camera where you can see and all the pop and the circumstance and the and the hoochie mamas out on the field well they're hiding in hanging out of their drawers come on and people will sit there and give three hours four hours won't even get up to go to the bathroom so don't you come to the house of god and get in a hurry because you're not going to get anything out of that but a little bit of entertainment but when you come to the house of god ready to worship ready to engage the holy spirit you make up your mind i didn't come to be a spectator i came to be in the middle to be a participator to put everything i've got into this so that i can take something out hallelujah well don't mind us brother shelly we're we're we're too busy to listening to amen the power of agreement is found in the amen when you say amen you're saying i receive that into my life as the absolute truth and not only do i acknowledge it as the truth but i receive every benefit attached to that truth every blessing attached to that truth we like to use the example when our kids were growing up we had a shabbat meal every friday evening to honor uh this great tradition of pulling the family together i lost loved ones in the holocaust and and by the grace of god some of my family was able to escape and establish themselves in this nation and hide their jewishness in a time when even in america it wasn't safe to be jewish and so as an honor and respect to those who paid such a price for many years every friday night we cancelled every plan we did everything around that friday night and we have a time where the mother of the house is blessed and the father of the house is blessed and the daughters are blessed and the sons are blessed we read the scriptures to to pronounce this blessing over their lives and it was mandatory for us to say when our blessing was read amen it means yes i accept it and i intend to personify that to make that a living reality in my life when we bless our daughters and we say oh god may may they be like rebecca may they be like rachel may they be like leia and those little girls my beautiful little blond-headed girls would look up at us and say amen when we prayed over the boys may abba make you like ephraim and manasseh and they look up us even from the time they were tiny and say amen it means may i be the personification of what is being pronounced over my life so when the word goes forth and you say amen you are saying oh god i know that is the truth it's not just the truth it's my truth i own that truth i am that truth hallelujah we're not looking for revival somewhere we are revival that's what the word says we are revival we are the personification of a people who were once enslaved but by the beautiful grace and mercy of god we have now been set free and we are saying amen may i be the personification of freedom may i be the demonstration of liberty and may i never waste may i never squander freedom may i never use my freedom as an occasion to sin like a lot of people like to talk about being free from the law and the reason why they celebrate their freedom from the law is so that they can sin but god did not give us grace so that we have a license to live in unbelief hallelujah he gave us grace so that we might know what it means to receive something other than what we deserve if we get what we deserve it would be death and hell but thanks be to god he chose something else for us now how can we live slack how can we squander this grace how can we waste this freedom how can we be satisfied to live with vices in our life how can we be satisfied to hold on to habits that are destroying us how can we hold on to things that are affecting our marriage and the way we interact with our children how can we how can we squander this great gift that god has given does not the lamb deserve to receive the reward for his suffering shouldn't it be more than our verbal amen shouldn't it be the amen of our life shouldn't it be the amen of our choices i want you to give him praise just a moment go ahead he's worthy he's worthy we are faced with choices all the time all the time we choose we can choose anger we can choose jealousy it's easy to be jealous it's easy don't look at me like it's not it's easy to be jealous some of you ought to know you're experts at it you can teach us how to be jealous you've allowed that to swallow up your life come on it's a choice you can be free from that jesus paid the price for you to not only be free from unbelief but to also be free from jealousy you don't have to choose resentment quit comparing your life to somebody else's life quit comparing your family to somebody else's family quit comparing your car to somebody else's car get out from under that and remember we're all sinners that have been saved by grace the ground is level at the foot of the cross there are no big iams and little b little others no sir we are all just participants in the marvelous plan of salvation the grace and the mercies of the living god we have no pride in being bride we have no pride because we're chosen it should make us the most humble people in all the world if you folk really understood the glory of receiving the message that we have received if you really could see the one in the million value of being one in a million that would hear the word and respond with your life if you could see the value in that no price would be too great then a woman would never complain about having to do her hair a certain way or having to wear a certain thing or a man having to make some choices because i want you to know a man being modest is just as important in this hour as a woman being modest because so many of those lines are being blurred today pronoun confusion is a much deeper problem than pronouns come on and so it's important for us to be willing to be a little bit of a gazing stock to the world around us it's important that we don't let that cause us to resent who we are or to be ashamed of who we are we're called to be a parable you are walking in a parabolic anointing in an hour where it's so easy to go with the flow because i saw thousands of jellyfish blobs of gunk in the water jelly bubbles these other little creatures that you see that look like jellyfish but they're not and they don't sting but if you don't know what you're looking at you think you're looking at a jellyfish thousands and thousands of them and when they analyze the little creatures that they are they find out that they have more in common with humans than they do with jellyfish because they have more similar tissue when you pick them up they just it just kind of just kind of disintegrates in your hand there's nothing there but it sure uses that likeness to the jellyfish to survive because people get away from it not realizing all you have to do is pick it up with your hand and it just how many of you have ever seen them and you know what i'm talking about there's thousands of them there any of those blobs any jellyfish down there can just float around with the way the waves are turning and the way the current any old jellyfish can float down the stream in the right direction of the current but it takes something with a backbone it takes something with a vertebrae take something with a skeleton to say i don't have to go the way of the world around me i don't have to follow society around me i've got a made-up mind to follow jesus christ and his word is my example no matter what the co-worker thinks about me we can't trust in our little trinkets and her little treasures so many of the jewish people that i have known through the years especially those in jerusalem they're trusting in rituals and they're trusting in traditions and and whether they can ring the chicken's neck just right and all of these kinds of things to be right when all they have to do and they will they will they will in time all they have to do is open their heart and receive jesus as their savior and then they can live peace knowing that if i if i get something wrong he's there to pull me back and to woo me in and to forgive me and to show me mercy and grace if i'm willing to repent i just think repentance should be a practice it shouldn't be an event it should be a lifestyle we should just walk with a repentant heart before the lord lord forgive me lord have mercy on me lord help me not to be that person help me to be stronger than that so with everything that jesus has done for us how could we squander that by living below our freedom level you see that's why i say freedom is a choice we choose to allow the lord to deliver and set us free and then we choose daily and sometimes multiple times to stay in that freedom instead of holding on to resentment instead of holding on to unforgiveness instead of holding on to wrongs that have been done to us we choose not to be enslaved by unforgiveness we choose not to be enslaved by repeating and rehearsing every detail over and over and over and over and over again in our mind we make a conscious decision to choose freedom and in order to choose freedom we say i'm not going back there i'm not going through that thought process anymore i'm not walking through that hurt anymore i'm not going through the details of that betrayal anymore are you listening i'm leaving that under the blood of jesus christ i choose to forgive i'm not waiting on an apology i choose to forgive because i've been forgiven i choose not to be resentful but to and if i can embrace in this earth i can embrace in prayer if there are people that i can't walk with in fellowship through this life because of something that has transpired i don't have to forsake them in prayer i can call their name before the lord just like i would if i was walking in fellowship with them i don't forget them because i can't eat dinner with them i still have a responsibility when he allows it that we would would continue to say oh god deliver help lead guide direct protect keep these loved ones may i not harbor any ill will i'm preaching to somebody may i not harbor any ill will may i let it go because i choose freedom i choose to walk in to maintain deliverance you see it's our responsibility in a message called god doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him i may have shared this one with you the last sunday that i was here it talks about the responsibility that we have as believers he said now because we have a responsibility that we've got to answer to god someday for every man that come on the face of the earth has to answer to god for a responsibility and to and i'm not done and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for just a moment there you and i are stewards of a truth we have been entrusted with the truth and we are going to be held responsible for the way we represent that truth when everybody's looking and when nobody you know is looking anybody with me we're going to be responsible for how we represent that truth in the world and to many of us it's a stewardship we have to answer for let's move on we this responsibility is a stewardship that's been committed to us by god i don't care what it is as i said a few moments ago a housewife then be a genuine housewife that's right if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that god has put you to do you've got a stewardship to that you've got to answer to god for because it takes all of these things to do it you're not living your life in in jealousy and comparing your your life your easy life i mean your very difficult life to someone else's easy life if you get caught up in that oh if they'd have been through what i'd have been through they'd be as bitter as i am you're choosing bitterness you're choosing to live there you're making yourself a continuous victim there's such a spirit in this nation right now and i'm not here this morning to shame the victim i'm here to tell you you have a choice you don't have to live under the responsibility of maintaining the mentality of someone who is a victim you have the grace of god and the responsibility to maintain the lifestyle of someone who has been set free from everything that satan sent your way to warp your life to hinder your life to handicap your life you don't have to live under that we're living in an hour where all of society seems to be emphasizing this this victim thought and and there's no one to to to help because all the helpers are victims and so it's no longer just about race it's about everything we've been betrayed by our parents so what jesus has come to heal you of every wound to heal you of every hurt he's the best mama that anybody could ever have he's the best daddy that anybody could ever have you don't have to live handicapped he proved it to me in my own life i didn't have a father and so i was fearful of how i would be a daddy when i had never had a daddy to be someone to be a daddy to me and my fear almost took my life at times holding me back from what god had for me i had to trust him i had to say even though i never had a father as an example i had a heavenly father he is my example and if i trust him he'll help me be the dad that he would have me to be all of us have to come to that kind of understanding when we choose to walk in freedom it means we choose not to be handicapped spiritually by the past we choose to let the past be the past and we're living in the present now we keep one eye on eternity and one eye on the present and we refuse to live at all in yesterday we refuse we take what god let us learn from the past and we leave the hurt and the wounds and the pain is it easy i didn't say it was easy i said it's possible because jesus has paid the price and all what he does when he heals us somebody said well i'm not healed you have you asked him have you nailed your have you bowed your knee have you knelt before have you said lord heal me i want to be healed of all the hurt and the past all the stuff that i feel like still affects me today i want you to heal me i want you to soothe me i want you to remold me and remake me and reshape me i want you to recreate me hallelujah because that's who you are i want you to give me a new lease on life and i want you to help me have strength to keep choosing freedom instead of bondage i forgive i forgive you do it i forgive you make up your mind to walk in that somebody said how's it possible because he forgave us how many times how many times oh so many times way more than 70 times seven wouldn't you agree he just still forgives he forgives you right now if you need his forgiveness right now all you have to do is look to him and ask him and it's there in a message called a prisoner he said now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to god justly does that because he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong put the first man on the wrong basis that he'd have to put on free moral agency see he said we're just exactly tonight like adam and eve there's no different right and wrong sets before either one of us life and death we can make our choice it's up to you to make it see he said that's the way adam and eve did and they made the wrong choice and now by that put the whole race the human race under death the penalty of death and then god came down oh yes oh it's good news it it it never gets old and then god came down in the form of a man and took that death paid the penalty of that death that his subjects to be free those that desired to his subjects that desire to to be free they could go free is that your desire it's not your desire all right and then i want to go to what was the holy ghost given for follow me with this if you give me just a little more time what was the holy ghost given for paragraph 137 you're going to be filled up with something he said what are we going to do amen what are we going to do each person sitting here is filled with something and i'm going to close after that he said you're filled with something you can't sit there without being full of something so i want you to know sitting here today you're full of something he said you've got a life in you that life governs you and that life is governed by spirit now you might be full of the world loving the world or the things of the world god be merciful to you you might be full of creeds from some church some little prayers that you say you think it's going to pray to some dead person or make some kind of a sign across you god be merciful to you he said you may be full of religion i want you to look at what he said and that's worse yet you see it's not religion it's not going through the motion it's relationship he said the bible said in the last days they'd be very religious having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away he said if you're all full of religion you're miserable just religion that's all if you're full of creed you don't know what you're talking about if you're full of the world you're blind and then again you may be full of the holy ghost amen see if you're just full of religion you're just full of rules and and regulations and stipulations and your mind stays on measuring up this is not what holiness is about it's not to keep your mind on measuring up all the time it's to keep your mind on your testimony you're thinking always of christ but you're thinking about the testimony that you're leaving so you choose to do and not to do some things because you understand that you're called as a minister to somebody you're called in ministry to somebody and they're watching your life so you're not fearful of being kicked out or put out of the church they're not living in fear of that religion will do that to you he said then you may be full of the holy ghost amen i hope you are and if you're not i hope you get full and if you're full of the holy ghost what you got you tell me you got power you got love you got peace even in the midst of the war you got power you got love you got peace even in all the rejection of your family guess what you got you got power you got love you got peace when you walk into the room on your job and everybody whispers and giggles and nods and punches one another in the ribs let me tell you what you got you got power you got love you got peace when you go to school some little sister goes to school and and and they're all sitting there in men's clothing and tight pants and and they look at you and you go in there with a skirt on and they laugh at you and they make fun of you they have something ridiculous to say about you maybe they call you a pilgrim maybe they call you amish some of you have been called amish some of you've been called pilgrims if they ever see that you just say that's exactly what i am the bible said i'm a pilgrim and a stranger this is what the scripture said and they're making fun of you and and you know we get older it doesn't matter we get used to it but these young ones i remember it very well i've told you many times they fell on the football field and rolled around in the dirt looked at me singing holy roller holy roller holy roller i'd say you baboons get up from there get up from there yes that's what i am i'm a holy roller and i'd rather roll into heaven than strut into i'm not hell going about my business and i've told you this so many times maybe you're hearing you unheard it we'd go back to the locker room and they would pull me off to the side nobody listening nobody watching and they'd say preacher my grandmother's sick in the hospital with a heart attack and i don't want to lose my grandmother you don't understand preacher i can't lose my grandmother will you get to the hospital to pray for my grandmother same ones not not their buddies the same ones that had just been making fun of me and calling me a holy roller would ask me to pray and you know what i did i made my way to the hospital i prayed for dozens of grannies during my school career or they would say preacher my mom and dad are just about to get a divorce i don't want to live in a broken home pray that god will undertake i'd go back later and ask them they'd say all i can tell you is prayer's working things are getting better many times they would say things are getting better i run into people in town now all these years later and i and i greet them or they say hey steve how are you doing or they reach out to me on facebook and i remember i remember how they how they were how they acted how they made fun and how they asked for prayer i also remember the times that god would send real revivals to my friends i remember some of the times that those who would make fun of me i would have the courage to ask them to come to revival service i remember the the boy named chris who was a good friend of mine in high school i've been trying to get up the courage i needed to invite him to revival service and finally i got it and he drove a trans am that was pretty cool at the time you know and he said i'll go to revival under one condition i said what's that he said if you'll let me pick you up and take you in my trans ham i said well i just don't know about a holiness preacher arriving in the church in a red trans am but i guess i can he picked me up for church and took me in that red translam and he said i got something cold in the cooler in the back if you think you got nerves and need to relax a little bit before you preach i said chris you don't get it do you you don't really get the point do you he said oh no i'm just picking at you he says it's a sprite oh i got stories more stories in time of how god would meet in those revival services chris gave his heart to the lord not that night but not too many nights later same revival he said i'm coming back i said you're coming back he said yeah i'm coming back several nights later he came and gave his heart to the lord and before that revival was over he'd brought his mom and his dad and his hand and his uncle and all of them had given their heart to the lord he said to the pastor of the revival he said i i'd like to testify i said oh no pastor that might not be wise i have no idea what he'll say he he's very new to the faith it might be spicy it might be more than the granny skin panel i don't know he said no steve i feel like we ought to we ought to have him we ought to have him testify and i said okay and he got up with tears running down his face and he said i used to make fun of him i called him every name in the book he said i even made fun and mock speaking in tongues but the grace and mercy of god brought me to this revival gave me a tug on my heart and i surrendered my life to the lord and i didn't want to slip around when nobody was around and apologize to him like i had many times asking him for prayer i wanted to ask him to forgive me in front of all of you in this service some of our classmates there i want him to forgive me in front of everybody and i want him to know i'll never be guilty of that again you don't ever know what god wants to do in somebody's life i still feel for the young people i feel for what they may go through and how they might be made fun of but i want you to know you are blessed to live in the hour you live in because there was once a time you had to hide your faith entirely for fear of death christians were just killed they were tortured to death stretched apart their bellies split often and sulfur burned and listen at this it wasn't all done by evil tyrants either some of it was done by the church but you can't stop the real seed of god oh no constantine couldn't stop the real church queen helena couldn't stop the real church popes and potentates could not stop the real church although they tried to wash it from history with the very blood of those who confessed it the true seed of god has marched on and on and on and on so church we have it easy we have it easy a little coveted restriction and we start screaming persecution right some little restriction outdoor mask and we're just sure that we're being persecuted now we have never seen what's coming to this world the persecution's coming it's coming it's going to not only come by the hand of the government but it's going to come by the hand of false religion because when the false church joins with politics as the book of revelation tells us it will then you've got all the power of the church and all the power of the government together that's when the real persecution is going to take place and many of you are blessed to know by revelation that before it comes to that most serious hour god is provided away for those that are his for those that are sealed with the genuine power of the holy ghost to those who have been cleansed by the washing of the water of the word to those who have accepted and chosen to live in freedom and to walk in deliverance god's made a way out they're not appointed under wrath if you believe that say amen i need just a little more time it's just one give me just a little more time so even even if you listen even if you feel some ridicule you have some difficulty you can choose to walk in power to walk in love to walk in peace jesus said my peace i'll give unto you not as the world giveth i you you got peace you're sealed got a sign amen you've got rest you've got joy unspeakable and full of glory you're anchored oh my that's what you are anchored with the holy ghost you're full of something either the turmoil of the world or you're full of the holy ghost you're either full of unforgiveness and resentment and bitterness and jealousy and envying and strife or you're filled with the holy ghost power love joy peace he said you have passed from death unto life waiting for the general resurrection in the last day oh what a promise oh what a promise in the message just once more lord i might have to get somebody else to read it no excuse me i am the resurrection in life paragraph 64. like the world jesus said you cannot serve god and mammon mammon is the world can't serve god in the world at the same time we have our choice we can be germatized by god by his holy spirit and we have eternal life if we don't when we die that's it we're ready for the judgment then why we didn't do it then the punishment it follows that for rejecting it now in the message just once more lord he said samson prayed right lord let me die with these philistines oh my see what it's going to cost him what if god answers his prayer let me die oh i like that he said was it patrick henry said give me liberty or give me death that's right all right that's it read it liberty or death you see liberty is it's a choice freedom is a choice jesus has done everything that he could possibly do to set us free we're free by the blood we're free by his grace we're free because of mercy but we have a choice to make will we choose death will we choose to become to become entangled enslaved again or will we choose liberty he said it's back to god or death what are we going to do what are we mimicking what are we trying to play christianity how about giving me just a little more i don't see anybody moving toward the mic why don't you give me just a little more on the microphone if the holy ghost is still the holy ghost that fell at pentecost it still does the same things it did then same power won't you come in here or watch this service on a stream and make some fun of somebody because you saw him stagger a little bit or dance a little bit or jump a little bit when the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost they staggered out of that upper room until everybody around them said oh these men are drunk and they're hard drunks because they're drunk and it's early in the morning you know what he said they're already drunk they got up drinking if the holy ghost falls among us it'll be the same holy ghost then we can accept expect the same power the same spirit it'll work the same way we don't need a council of churches we need the bible back in action how many of you long to be one of those who puts the bible in action in your life i want the bible to work in my life i don't want to say i'm saved but i go to church but i i do my best but i love the lord but i want to take him at his word he said that if we don't need a counsel we need the bible back in action let's go on he said now we find out that samson prayed right lord let me die with the enemy i'd rather die right here in the midst of my enemy than for god to continue to be mocked he said die to the enemy that had got him that way remember he's blind he's just a mess if there is anything that people ought to pray for tonight thank you i don't know i may spit that out what if i what if i take somebody out on the front row bethany you better watch you better dodge if you see this flying through the air like a torpedo did you all know a secret i'm going to tell you a secret did you know benjamin leads worship with one of these in his mouth every sunday he must have stronger jaws than i do to hold it in play there's anything that people ought to pray for tonight we see the thing that's done this it's getting away from the bible to a creed it started at nicaea when they started taking people away from the word and they started making religion more acceptable to the masses oh yes you just do a little bit of research you'll find out there was no holy trinity until nicean council when so many pagan rome romans were coming becoming christians they were accepting the church many of them were accepting the church i don't know how many of them were accepting jesus but they began to be so confused about god because they had had so many gods to worship and now they're being told hero israel the lord god is one and so these church fathers they begin to try to find a way to explain god look folks there's no way there's really no way to explain god you have to experience him he's not a doctrine you can explain doctrine but you can only experience a person and he's one he's one but they had to make it more acceptable to these pagans who couldn't understand god and so the church fathers got together and they start developing doctrine to help explain what the bible said and the next thing you know you've got all of these creeds all of these dogmas all of these ideas none of them in the bible isn't that amazing none of them in the bible and what happens to people swallow them because it was easier to understand them than to make our thoughts and belief system match the bible so this is the problem today people have gotten so far away from the bible to a creed then die with the thing get out of it die to it get out of it die to it get out of it die to it he said samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of god back again he was willing to go back to that nazarite valve that he made there is a price to be paid for it but today the people don't seem to do it now that's where we are there's a price to be paid to operate in the power of god there's a price to be paid to walk in deliverance there's a price to be paid but the people don't seem to want to pay that price you don't be like them you make up your mind i'm going to pay this price the lamb is going to get the glory he's going to get the reward for his suffering in my life if i'm the only one now let's go to john 8 just a moment we'll take just a few more minutes we're almost to the end i'm apologize to you about my voice john 8 31 then jesus said to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed it's not believing once never fellowshipping the word again never receiving the word never studying never looking in the word again choosing your own life depending on the church to save you this is a relationship this is meeting jesus every day in the word if you continue to abide in my word you shall know the truth and the truth shall what make you free then answer they answered him we be abraham's seed just like the religion just like the religious why are you talking to us about something like that don't you know who we are we're sons of abraham we were never in bondage to any man that's a lie how many of you know that's just a flat out lie why they were slaves to egypt they were slaves to babylon they were slaves to the greeks they said we've never been in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free they answered him we be abraham's seed you know jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free you read it he said i know that you are abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you to the most religious men of his time he looks to them and says you want to kill me because my word has no place in you you quote the word by memory but my word has no place in you folks this shows us that religion is a cheat religion is a counterfeit it doesn't take the place of relationship brother branham goes on to tell us in the second seal and when a man turns down the gospel paragraph 2 16 and when a man turns down the gospel truth satan marks him where at his ear do you want to know where these customs come from i know this will not be pleasant some will mumble at their seat but it's still the truth this is where the whole tradition comes from of poking these holes in your body when a slave refused to take his freedom he rather wanted to stay in the house of his master there was only one way to identify him as a perpetual slave and that was to take his ear and lay it against the door frame and pierce it through with an awl and they put a hoop small hoop in that ear the other slaves didn't have it it's only the slave who said i don't want to be free i got a better life here you know this is terrible hard to say but even in our nation we have historical records that there were some situations where where even african slaves said the very same thing that they were saying way back in egypt there were those who didn't suffer as harshly as others and there were those who said i had a better life here than i would ever have anywhere else and there is record that even here in america they were still boring the ear this ancient tradition and putting a hoop in an ear and when so when i see this all the time now in churches and even men [Music] the first thing that comes to my mind is who are you a slave to who is your master i i love my mama but i told my mother when she had to have more than one hole it was fashionable to have more than one i said mama who are you a slave to i said first of all you're a slave to society you're a slave to your peers and second of all you're a slave to satan i would want anything to identify myself with slavery anybody still here he deafens him so he can't hear the truth he marks him somewhere where the ear he's finished he stays with that group that he's with if he won't hear the truth no you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free see the truth does what it makes free wow it got tight in here and there may be those who twist out of here saying i'm not giving this up i'm not doing that i'm not going to ever do different than i do right now let me tell you something you don't have any idea what you might do when god gets a hold of your heart you might be glad to be identified with the holy rollers you might not be embarrassed to be identified with the holy rollers when god ever gets a hold of your heart just right be careful what you say you won't ever do oh yes the truth makes free i believe that with all my heart is that the end of that one yes the token he said that's a cutting message but it's the truth that's what we need is truth god help us to know truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall i claim that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i believe that god gives the holy ghost as a token right now just before the exodus of the bride going out of the church i believe there is so much tommy rot and people saying they shouted they spoke in tongues he said i believe in those things but you can't rely on that how many of you can say amen to that how can you rely on that and then deny the word not how much you're shouting not how much you're talking tongue it's how much you obey the word he goes on the token listen the token is the word identified in you living itself out that's powerful the token is the word identified in you living itself out that's god's being that's god being his own interpreter you don't have to say well now you interpret my tongue that idiot he interprets your life by the word when he takes your word what you are and identify his word through there there don't need any interpretation it's already there god does his own interpretation and we've had these promises for the day calling jesus on the scene let's do these quickly and have them out of the way where the battle is it's right up where there with satan not somebody who kisses the babies and buries the dead and carries a pen knife but somebody with a two-handed sword right up in the front of the battle that's the one c that's the thing that counts that's where the heat of the battle is on that's where the enemy stands we need some of that those who will not be afraid to preach the word without fear of man without compromise and knoweth it not if he's a president where is our john quincy adams is boy i'd like to ask that question today if this impostor is our president where is our john quincy adams is where is our abraham lincoln's men of principle where's our patrick henry give me liberty give me death where's the man that stands for what's right where is a man that's not afraid to speak out regardless the whole world's against him speak out for what's right and stand for it and die for it where is our arnold von winkleridge again today where is men of integrity where is men with spirit they're so wishy-washy and gummed up until they don't know where they stand god let me stand with the principles of one man as a minister the word of jesus christ for heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never fail on this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell shall not prevail against it choosing of a bride we're reading fast now and it's a dangerous thing to wait until that last hour too because you may take on something that you could never shake out of it i've seen it i've seen it i've seen something take such hold on somebody that they could not shake out of it you listen to me i've seen god bury people i've seen god absolutely hide people in the grave because they could not shake out of what had a hold of their life and god said i'd rather go saved than live a reproach somebody said i don't believe in says it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not it's what the word teaches it's what it's what life experiences have shown us you get to trampling the blood of jesus around with your wishy-washy life and something take a hold of you that you can't get out from under it's grace and mercy that takes us home rather than to leave us here to continue to blaspheme the name of jesus are you with me he said it's a dangerous thing to wait till the last hour because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it you know there is a time when you can be warned then if you step across that line of warning then you're already marked on the other side branded he said remember when the jubilee year come and the priest rode with the trumpet sounding that every slave could go free but if they refuse to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an awl bore through his ear bore him through the ear and then he served his master couldn't get out from under it it was put on his ear as a type of hearing faith cometh by hearing he heard the trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it if any time men and women hear god's truth and see it vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there's some other reason listen i want you to i want you to hear something i wish i could let you hear it but it's too personal but my wife and i received a voice message yesterday from a sister far away from here who said brother shelly i just wanted you to know what happened brother so-and-so this is a brother who has just recently received real deliverance in this house brother so and so accidentally passed by our house yesterday and we were really in a crisis there were some painful things going on we were having a real family crisis and god so used that brother his deliverance was evident what god has done in his life was evident and it was sharp and it was right and it spoke to our need and she went on for over six minutes and she said i just wanted to say to you all thank you so much for doing what you do and loving the way you love and giving people an opportunity to find deliverance i tell you what folks that is to me the most pr even though i couldn't just share it right out with all it's one of the most precious gifts that could ever be given it's a great amen it's a great encouragement to say let's keep preaching it let's keep creating an atmosphere let's keep encouraging people to get what they can from god and then choose to keep what they get let's keep doing all that we can do because it's not only making a difference in here but it's making a difference out there because that's what true deliverance does hallelujah they don't want to hear it there's some other reason there's some other choosing that they have than to face up to the truth in fact therefore their ears can be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you when god speaks to your heart you act you do what you know why elias is here because god spoke to his heart and what did he do he acted right then you know why brother austin's sister hannah here god spoke to their heart what did they do they acted right then rebecca sister rebecca and maya why god spoke to their heart they acted right then sister claudia god spoke to heart she acted right then josh and hope brother daniel sister and gospel to their heart listen you don't have to say i don't know anything about this you've got examples i'll never forget sister jaya jada we love you too sister jaya boy then i'm going to tell you something there's a lot of names jaya maya jada you all better be just glad if i point at you and talk cause sometimes when i'm when i mention their name i get them all mixed up it's the same thing that got to hold his sister jada after a sunday service who when nathan nathan got under inspiration in the middle of the sermon and started preaching and yet there was nothing out of order about it and that so struck sister jada's heart that she said i got to get back down there tuesday night so here she comes in tuesday night surprises us all with the children behind her brother elias comes barging in my office he's almost all he's almost taken out by my security detail he comes barreling in there like a bull in a china closet he finally gets broke in there to me and he said god said whoever gets in that altar tonight is going to have their deliverance i said all right what else do you say well all right we had a good service that night we said let's come and see we had a good order service god met he ministered he blessed encouraged he helped delivered what i don't know what all god did but i know we're coming to a close so much so that the stream is turned off hallelujah and we're coming down to go out and we look over there and there set some of their children the spirit of god's moving on them and i said look at there look what god's doing for them let's see what this is about and the next thing you know god was pouring the holy ghost out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hour and a half two hours later god's had his way why it all was the same it all goes right to this when god speaks to your heart you better do it then or the enemy will talk you out of it or your family will talk you out of it or your preacher might talk you out of it when you know god is speaking to your heart you better be ready to obey him when we started in closing musicians are coming when we started this service we started off talking about the weapons of our warfare this is the greatest portion of the warfare that we're engaged in right now the biggest portion of the warfare that we are engaged in right now is in this these verses of scripture let's look at the list number one it's a battle to pull down strongholds paradigms thought processes same old same old same jose mo samo am i am i telling you the truth let me have your attention same old same old same old same same rejections same hurt feelings same resentment same little little roots of bitterness unforgiveness if we don't deal with strongholds if we don't pull down paradigms that we have built in our life they become death structures they produce nothing but death nothing but heartache nothing but destruction you get under a spirit of rejection then you attract rejection the hardest person for me to fellowship with is someone who wears that cloak of rejection it makes me so nervous you're afraid you're going to say the wrong thing you're going to do the wrong thing you're going to act the wrong way you're not going to call the right name and so what what really happens to me is when i'm around someone who wears that you know it's almost like a sign around their neck i'm rejectable then i don't know how to respond to that sometime so the first thing you realize you do is you're pulling away only because you don't know how to fellowship that i know how to cast it out if you want it cast out but most of the time people don't want that cast out they want it petted it's become their identity you take away that spirit of rejection that they're under and they don't even know who they are so so you you not on purpose even sometimes you you just sort of pull away because you don't know how to respond guess what that does it just strengthens that rejection spirit that's on that person and now my pastor now my friend now you have rejected me too not realizing that a lot of times the banner you wear around your neck is what's pushing people away isn't that awful it's one of the worst paradigms i know of i can't think of a much worse paradigm than that rejected people attract rejection so at some point you've got to make up your mind i may be rejected by everybody on planet earth but somebody loves me somebody died for me somebody understands me somebody cares about me somebody's drawing me close while everybody else is pushing me away come on come on you say that just seems like that just makes it seem as it is not a big thing it is a big thing it's a legitimate problem that people have and it needs to be ministered to but somebody needs to tell them you have the responsibility to make up your mind i'm not going to live under that identity anymore i'm not going to wear that as my banner i'm rejectable i've been so rejected you just change your change your sign you know what they ought to say you don't have an arrow on him and say upon him and say i'm his favorite that'll mess with the religious the religious will see them that's our year is favored god doesn't play favorite heads but you'll know in your heart hallelujah you know what you ought to know it you ought to know it you ought to be so sure of his love for you that you feel like i'm his favorite [Music] he's got a room full of favorites are you all right with that not i'm i'm unlovable not i'm rejected not i'm defeated people just don't understand me i'm misunderstood i'll never be in the clique i'm preaching to you shall i call your name with it can we do initials this is a part of life yes sir i know rejection you know my story i know what rejection feels like but you've got to make up your mind i'm not here for somebody to accept me i'm here to be his accepted to be his beloved i'm here to minister i'm not here to minister to everybody that's the hardest lesson for every preacher to learn because you come into this thing believing you can preach to anybody and help everybody and then you quickly find out there are some people that can never receive from you but it doesn't make them evil or bad it just means there's somebody else they can receive from therefore they are not your responsibility so you can quit beating heads with somebody and realize i don't have to help him god's got somebody else who can help him what i have to do is help those that i can help be a light to those that i can be a light too but if i choose to live in rejection because one person rejects me you've got that stronghold over your life it'll cut it'll be unforgiveness it'll be you know it'll become self-condemnation women with long hair will start wearing it down in their face i want to tell people sometimes pull it back tuck it behind your ear put in the clip get it out of your face don't hide behind it god said that is your glory not your hiding place people start walking like this they're head down all the time i want to tell them lift up your head your redemption draws an eye there's nothing down there but ants look up live i want to tell people sometime quit shuffling you're not a prisoner going to the death march pick up your feet spirits will manifest like that on people sometime they they're so defeated they're so confused that they confuse everybody around them that doesn't have to be your identity you pull that stronghold down your pastor can't pull that down your mama can't pull that down for you your husband can't vote your wife can't pull that down for you you're the only one that can take authority in the name of jesus christ and pull down strongholds what else let's let's go to just the list number one to pull down strong holes number two to cast down imaginations you know me i've got to tell paul kane he said brother stephen i have such a complex that i can't go to the football game and he was not exaggerating i can print the emails and show you he was not exaggerating he was tormented by the spirit of rejection i was emailing him three times a day from ghana and we had a blackout and i couldn't send off that second and third email by the next morning he was just sure that i had rejected him that i had believed a report about him that i wasn't going to be his friend anymore i said no papa paul it's called the blackout not only was there no internet there was no power we're still tight we're still friends the same internet that didn't let me communicate with you didn't let nobody communicate with me so i haven't believed anything that i didn't believe yesterday he said i can't even go the football game because when i see them down there in a huddle i'm convinced they're talking about me he was that bound you are the only one that can cast down that kind of imagination how many of you know that's that's absolutely ludicrous it's it's more than ridiculous he was saying it jokingly but was so guilty it's not funny you can't even hardly laugh at it because you can only imagine the torment you alone can cast down imaginations what else to cast down every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of christ is there another where's it for to bring every thought yeah the most important to bring every thought into captivity and forcing it to obey christ oh no no no no no no no no no no uh-uh you're going to obey the word my my head's not going to just think what it wants to think i'm going to control those thoughts i'm going to submit them and subject them and force them to obey the word of god i'm his favorite i'm his chosen i'm his elected he loves me if you can't love me like he loves me i'm sorry for you you need to catch some of that if somebody can't love you like jesus loves you they got the problem you don't have to live the rest of your life feeling unlovable because two or three people don't love you church don't want much to do with you that doesn't mean he doesn't come on all these things are legitimate but every one of them have to be defeated in the message three witnesses he said god wake us up from this sense-bound dream that we're in may we go beyond this sphere up into the place where all things are possible and there lay hold on eternal life and on divine healing and tonight walk out of here victorious in christ jesus for we ask it in his name amen greatest battle ever fought give away satan what's the matter soldiers don't you think we can conquer he's already conquered we are more than victors in christ jesus every devil cast out everything else amen if you believe that let's stand all of it all of it i don't always get to look at these texts while i'm preaching i've had 190 texts while i was preaching somebody's with me if you give me 190 amens but here's one brother said you can call my name if you need to call a name let's call it out there's no reason to hide when freedom's available [Music] i choose freedom i choose to walk like his elect somebody said it can't be that easy it wouldn't be that easy had he not paid the price he paid the price looking down through the ages god beheld the dying soul sin had brought separation [Music] nevermore could man be whole there must come a lamb one whose blood alone redeems giving gifts to the father of the souls made wide and clean and when he sees me he sees the blood of the lamb whoo he sees me as worthy and not as i am oh abuse me in
