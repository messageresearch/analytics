[0:00] I shared with the church last uh week
[0:03] when I got back from
[0:04] Taiwan that I was preaching on Tove how
[0:07] many of you have heard the message that
[0:09] we have done on Tove well I took it a
[0:11] little bit further and and I begin to to
[0:15] really try to express to those folks
[0:18] what to really is and to is a Hebrew
[0:22] word that means in its in its mildest
[0:27] form it means good but in its deepest
[0:30] form it means when the seeds of Destiny
[0:32] and purpose that God has planted begin
[0:36] to sprout and bring forth what they were
[0:39] planted to bring forth that is Tove and
[0:43] when when when the seeds of Destiny and
[0:45] purpose that have been planted in
[0:47] someone are not bringing forth they are
[0:50] not sprouting because they're not
[0:52] leaning into those seeds of Destiny and
[0:54] purpose they're just men and women
[0:56] running from the presence of the Lord
[0:58] have you ever been there
[1:00] uh that is it's really considered in
[1:03] Hebrew Rah R A which is bad or evil did
[1:08] you know that in the in the Old
[1:10] Testament in Hebrew if you're not doing
[1:13] what you're called to do what what
[1:16] you're being pulled to do and it doesn't
[1:17] mean if you're not doing it uh
[1:19] successfully with with baskets full of
[1:21] harvest it it means if you're not moving
[1:24] in that direction God calls that raw he
[1:28] calls that evil he doesn't call call it
[1:30] not good he calls it evil and and I
[1:34] begin to speak about how we should
[1:36] practice seeing Tove in one another
[1:39] husbands should practice seeing Tove in
[1:41] their wives wives should practice
[1:45] looking for Tove you may have to look
[1:47] really hard to find Tove in your
[1:50] husband not my wife Tove just jumps up
[1:55] in her face out of my life every
[1:57] day but she wakes up and says oh you are
[2:01] so
[2:03] Tove you notice I stepped away from the
[2:06] pull pit to say
[2:08] that but anyway I was bringing out this
[2:11] contrast and I had a I had a a female
[2:13] interpreter and she was interpreting in
[2:16] in uh um
[2:19] cantones which is a dialect of
[2:22] Chinese and she was doing an amazing job
[2:25] and she was quite comfortable and I
[2:29] guess I guess she was doing an amazing
[2:31] job she wasn't a hindrance to me that's
[2:33] how I judge an interpreter are they
[2:35] hindering me or helping me I have no
[2:37] clue what they're saying but I've
[2:39] already asked the Holy Ghost to guide
[2:41] their mouth I I tell you I usually lay
[2:43] my hands on them at some point and say
[2:45] Lord don't you let them speak one word
[2:48] that misrepresents what you're trying to
[2:50] say to your people today whether but on
[2:52] purpose or by accident and many of us
[2:55] have had experiences where the Holy
[2:56] Spirit would drop in our heart when
[2:58] we're preaching he didn't say what you
[2:59] said said yeah and I've corrected
[3:01] interpreters and stopped them and said
[3:03] now wait a minute you say what I just
[3:06] said not because my words are important
[3:08] but the message is important to get
[3:10] across to the people I don't want you
[3:12] twisting what I say with your
[3:14] Doctrine unless you're the pastor of the
[3:17] house and if you're not then I've been
[3:19] invited by the pastor Etc but I just
[3:21] turned to this little woman we were
[3:24] sitting on stools because it was a class
[3:25] and we were teaching imagine me teaching
[3:28] but anyway we're sitting on stool and I
[3:30] just turned to her and I just gently
[3:31] laid my hand on her shoulder and I began
[3:34] to speak Tove over her life and I began
[3:37] to tell her that I I saw that she was
[3:39] yielding her life and gift to the Lord
[3:42] you know something along this line and
[3:44] what a blessing she had been to me and
[3:46] how thankful I was that she was willing
[3:48] to do such a thing and she began to weep
[3:50] I mean weep and when she got through she
[3:54] said can I have permission to say
[3:56] something and I thought well I I guess
[3:58] yeah sure' and she began to speak in
[4:01] English and then in Chinese and she said
[4:04] I was going to tell uh Pastor Tam today
[4:07] that I was would never interpret again
[4:10] because I've been under such a an attack
[4:13] and under so much criticism and feeling
[4:15] like I was doing such a lousy job for
[4:18] years until I was ready to give up until
[4:21] you turned to me and and said what you
[4:24] said it Set Me Free from all of that
[4:27] stuff and I'm willing to continue to do
[4:29] what whatever God has called me to do do
[4:31] you know how powerful that was in the
[4:32] meeting do you know I could have I could
[4:35] have just stopped teaching you know I
[4:36] didn't right I could have just stopped
[4:39] teaching because she just we just by the
[4:42] Holy Spirit inter in demonstrated what
[4:45] was being preached and and this is so
[4:47] important for us to be able to look into
[4:50] one another and and instead of seeing
[4:52] all the failures find something there
[4:55] try to see what God
[4:58] sees how is that possible we try to look
[5:01] through the blood and if you want to to
[5:05] to look at someone else in Grace I
[5:07] suggest that you take one big old look
[5:10] at your own life and when you see who
[5:13] you have been and how you've been
[5:15] behaving it'll be much easier for you to
[5:18] see Jesus in somebody else come on now
[5:22] why is that important because it's like
[5:24] fertilizing the seeds of Destiny and
[5:26] purpose in someone else's life when you
[5:28] begin to try to BL bless them for what
[5:31] they've done for what who they've been
[5:33] on a personal level or on a on a general
[5:36] scale and you start speaking over those
[5:38] seeds of Destiny they begin to sprout
[5:41] they begin to stir up the holy spirit of
[5:43] God begins to stir up those seeds and
[5:45] they begin to find potential
[5:48] oh Hallelujah think about the power we
[5:52] have to help someone on their journey to
[5:56] Tove with our words verse 1 through 5
[5:59] those of you who can remain standing
[6:01] please I want us just to give a little
[6:04] honor to the word of God now Moses this
[6:07] is Exodus 3:1 and uh we've heard from
[6:10] Brother Caleb now three times Paul Keith
[6:13] twice he'll be speaking tonight they're
[6:14] going to share the service in the
[6:16] morning and uh here's my little bit and
[6:19] so ask the Lord to help me I I I want
[6:21] his help to try to deliver this to you
[6:24] um I feel a little sorry for our home
[6:26] folks because mostly it's home folks
[6:28] here and you hear me all the time time
[6:30] but uh God
[6:31] knows so we'll just see what how how it
[6:34] goes verse one now Moses kept the flock
[6:37] of Jethro his father-in-law the priest
[6:40] of Midian and he led the flock to the
[6:43] backside of the desert you ever been
[6:46] there not a whole lot going on in the
[6:49] natural in the back side of the desert
[6:51] but there's a whole lot that goes on in
[6:52] the spiritual in the backside of the
[6:55] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[6:57] even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord
[7:01] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[7:05] of the midst of a
[7:08] bush he appeared to
[7:11] him in a flame of
[7:14] fire we always just say the burning bush
[7:19] but the Bush was not the
[7:21] attraction the fire on the Bush was the
[7:24] attraction ain't that right uh so he
[7:28] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[7:30] of the midst of a bush and he looked I
[7:33] guess he did and behold the bush burned
[7:37] with
[7:38] fire and the Bush was not
[7:42] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[7:47] aside and see this great sight he
[7:50] already saw
[7:51] it Bible said he saw it now he stops to
[7:55] contemplate what he's seeing and he
[7:58] makes a very important decision Vision
[8:00] I'm going to
[8:01] turn I'm not going to continue going in
[8:04] the way I'm going I'm going to turn
[8:07] because I perceive that this is not just
[8:09] a sign I perceive that there's a message
[8:12] behind this sign this sign is going to
[8:16] speak to me and when he recognized that
[8:19] the Bible said he turned aside to see
[8:21] this great sight why the bush is not
[8:25] burnt or consumed and when the Lord
[8:30] saw that he turned aside to see well I'm
[8:33] telling you God was very present he was
[8:37] very present that day on Horeb he was
[8:39] watching Moses Like an Eagle making sure
[8:43] that Moses was going to handle this the
[8:44] right way and when the Lord saw that he
[8:48] turned aside to see God called unto him
[8:52] out of the midst of the Bush out of the
[8:54] fire and said Moshe Moshe Moses and he
[8:58] said here am I and he said draw not nigh
[9:04] hither don't come any closer put off thy
[9:08] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[9:11] whereon thou standest is Holy Ground may
[9:14] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[9:16] his word you can have your seat you know
[9:19] this you know this event you know this
[9:22] is the calling of Moshe you know that
[9:24] this is the time in the life of Moses
[9:27] where he is about to be begin to fulfill
[9:30] the purpose of his birth amen uh one of
[9:35] the scriptures that we use when we're
[9:36] teaching on Tove is the is the the
[9:40] proclamation that yoked the mother of
[9:43] Moses made over him when she saw him she
[9:46] said this is a what goodly child goodly
[9:51] child and and we always say what mother
[9:54] looks at their child and and and doesn't
[9:56] think that he's good no one says I've
[9:59] got a bad baby well not not the day
[10:02] they're born anyway you know and we we
[10:05] don't have to go down that road where we
[10:07] you know do talk about the fact that all
[10:08] babies aren't beautiful but if you want
[10:11] us not originally not initially
[10:13] sometimes our heads are a little funny
[10:14] and they're little blue and and things
[10:17] happen they've gone through a lot and it
[10:19] sometimes takes a day or two to get
[10:20] everything settled back down to where
[10:23] the average eye would think it's
[10:24] beautiful but I promise you Mama and
[10:26] Daddy they think that baby is beautiful
[10:29] bruises and all cone head everything no
[10:32] stress of birth it's all right but if
[10:34] you should desire to see what a perfect
[10:36] baby looks like we have a brand new baby
[10:40] here this morning that's one of the most
[10:42] handsome boys I've ever seen in my life
[10:46] and and that is uh brother um Luke and
[10:50] sister Megan yich brought their little
[10:52] baby here this morning Caleb what's his
[10:54] middle name Caleb John and I hope you
[10:57] get a chance to see I came out of the
[10:59] washroom uh a few minutes ago uh and my
[11:02] wife was standing there she said there's
[11:04] a visitor to see you and they show me
[11:06] this amazing handsome little boy I
[11:09] didn't see him the day he was born but I
[11:11] saw a picture of him and he was pretty
[11:13] perfect from the beginning but she said
[11:16] goodly a goodly child and when we look
[11:19] at that word in the Hebrew it's
[11:21] Tove and and so we know that she wasn't
[11:24] just saying I've gotten a good child
[11:26] what we what we believe she was saying
[11:28] is I'm not going to just look at him
[11:30] through the natural eyes of a mother I'm
[11:32] going to look at him through spiritual
[11:35] eyes and the reason why I I'm choosing
[11:37] the word goodly or to is because I'm
[11:40] looking ahead to a time when this son is
[11:44] going to bring forth the seeds of his
[11:48] Destiny and purpose and began to be what
[11:51] God has sent him to this world to be
[11:54] there couldn't have been a more
[11:55] inconvenient time to have a baby because
[11:58] the children of Israel were in horrible
[12:01] horrible slavery and now under horrible
[12:04] persecution and threat of death and
[12:07] here's a new little baby and the word is
[12:09] getting around that newborn babes are
[12:12] about to be thrown in the river to the
[12:13] crocodiles and The Midwives have already
[12:16] been given instruction to murder the
[12:18] little Hebrew babies Etc you know what
[12:20] was going on at that time and yet here a
[12:22] mother it's not looking at her
[12:24] circumstances God bless yoked the mother
[12:27] of Moses God bless her
[12:29] because she was able to ignore what it
[12:31] looked like in the natural and look at
[12:34] her child with more than natural mother
[12:36] eyes she saw him with Spirit eyes she
[12:39] said this child is going to live to
[12:42] bring forth the seeds of Destiny and
[12:47] purpose that God has planted in his life
[12:50] he is a Tove child praise God the hope
[12:54] of every mother the hope of every father
[12:57] but she saw it she believed it she knew
[13:01] there was a threat that he would be
[13:02] killed but she was not going to accept
[13:05] the fact that God would let this little
[13:07] boy pass from the scene without doing
[13:09] what he was called to do the mother of
[13:12] Moses saw greatness in her child as he
[13:15] lay there we could go on and talk about
[13:18] the mother of of of the twins Jacob and
[13:20] Esau and we could say we could explain
[13:23] some things about that how the mother
[13:25] gave the prophecy she began to decree
[13:27] the destiny of her two sons there's a
[13:30] lot of powerful examples of that in the
[13:32] Bible but we want to move on because now
[13:35] we are to the time that Moses has left
[13:38] Egypt and he didn't leave on vacation he
[13:42] left fleeing for his life amen and why
[13:45] did he leave fleeing for his life
[13:48] because he was going to take the
[13:49] Deliverance of the Hebrew children into
[13:52] his own hands stay with me just a
[13:55] moment he was going to do what he could
[13:59] to deliver the children of Israel with
[14:01] his own brute power with his own hands
[14:04] with his own strength and he had taken
[14:07] all he could take one day and he's
[14:08] walking through the brickyard and he
[14:10] sees these Egyptian slave drivers
[14:14] whipping a Hebrew and he began he was
[14:17] already beginning to discover his his
[14:20] Heritage his roots he was feeling things
[14:22] that he didn't understand uh he was
[14:24] raised as a as a son to Pharaoh he was
[14:27] schooled in the best schools of Egypt
[14:29] and and and but he began to recognize
[14:31] you know I don't know if it happened
[14:32] like it did in the Ten Commandment movie
[14:34] or not uh where where the little little
[14:37] part of the prayer Shaw was discovered
[14:39] and and so then he he couldn't know who
[14:40] he was but something was happening in
[14:42] him that began to cause him to feel a
[14:44] little different than those around him
[14:45] has anybody ever had that
[14:47] experience or was I the only Chicken in
[14:49] uh only Eagle in the chicken yard see
[14:52] Moses began to feel like an eagle in a
[14:54] chicken yard something was not quite
[14:56] right and so he said I've got a to do
[14:59] something for these people and and he
[15:01] took the Deliverance of the children of
[15:03] Israel into his own hands and slew the
[15:06] Egyptian slew him killed him murdered
[15:08] him and then had no choice but to run
[15:10] for his life and he gets out there on
[15:12] the backside of the desert because God
[15:14] has to separate him from his comfort
[15:19] zone and his dependence on everybody
[15:22] around
[15:23] him so that he will completely depend on
[15:26] the God who called him before he was
[15:28] ever born
[15:30] right you want to talk about separation
[15:32] Abraham had seven of them before he
[15:34] became exactly who God had called him to
[15:36] be if you've only had one or two you
[15:38] ought to thank God that that's all it
[15:40] took if you're where you want to be
[15:41] because there are many separations and
[15:43] cycles of Separation that have to take
[15:46] place in our lives where the sword of
[15:47] the Lord hear me where the sword of
[15:49] God's word has to come and cut and
[15:51] separate us from the things that we have
[15:54] become familiar with so that we can be
[15:56] launched into a a stream that God wants
[15:58] us flowing in just a moment Amen brother
[16:02] I just want to help myself just a little
[16:04] bit cuz I need it I need help all right
[16:07] so here is Moses now and he is stirred
[16:11] up something has happened he's now on
[16:13] the backside of the desert he's he's
[16:15] married a little woman Jethro the
[16:17] midianite priest um who the Samaritans
[16:22] have have descended from the Samaritans
[16:24] of today who live on on top of the
[16:27] mountain there in Northern Samaria in
[16:29] Israel they claim Jethro as their
[16:31] Heritage and so here is this man his
[16:34] father-in-law and and and he's taking
[16:36] Moses in and Moses is caring for the
[16:38] sheep and uh because he's about to be a
[16:41] shepherd of men and so God trains him to
[16:43] be a Shepherd Of Men by giving him sheep
[16:45] to lead amazing isn't it a and so uh
[16:49] he's walking along chasing some of these
[16:51] sheep Lord have mercy you don't want a
[16:53] pastor to start talking about chasing
[16:55] sheep but he is chasing sheep and and
[16:59] it's always the same two or
[17:05] three it's it's not it's not the main
[17:07] herd it's not it's not the whole herd
[17:10] thanks be to God it's always the same
[17:12] two or three and he's chasing them uh
[17:16] because he wants to help them and he's
[17:19] probably struggling in his heart with
[17:21] the fact that sometimes it takes a crack
[17:23] upside the head because that staff that
[17:26] everybody talks about that had a crook
[17:28] on one in
[17:29] that crook wasn't just for pulling them
[17:31] back by the neck off the cliff it was
[17:34] also for cracking them upside the head
[17:35] when they needed to learn a
[17:39] lesson those are the three amens I
[17:43] anticipated but it's the truth and so
[17:46] I'll get off of that and so Moses is you
[17:49] know probably chasing one of these
[17:50] straggling sheep keep them from falling
[17:53] off the cliff telling them how wonderful
[17:56] they are stroking their fur and telling
[17:58] them it's going to you're just
[18:00] amazing your behavior is from hell but
[18:03] you're certainly from Heaven you know
[18:05] whatever he was doing and all of a
[18:07] sudden the fire of God the holy pre
[18:10] presence of God falls on that bush why
[18:14] that
[18:15] Bush was that the only Bush on Mount
[18:18] Horeb no God just chose a bush that's
[18:22] the bush I'm going to put my fire in and
[18:25] do you know that all of a sudden when
[18:26] the fire of God fell on that bush it was
[18:29] no longer an ordinary Bush it was the
[18:31] most spectacular Bush on that mountain
[18:34] and by the very virtue of the presence
[18:36] of God falling on that bush that Bush
[18:38] was made
[18:40] holy because to be made holy means to be
[18:43] separated from that which is not holy
[18:46] wow and so uh it wasn't a holy Bush five
[18:49] minutes before it was just a
[18:51] bush get it but when the fire fell on it
[18:54] it's now a holy bush
[19:00] not because all of a sudden it was
[19:01] following all the
[19:03] rules it's a bush for crying out loud
[19:06] but because God chose that bush and he
[19:09] said I'm going to put my fire in that
[19:11] bush and a message is going to come out
[19:14] of that
[19:17] bush that bush is not any more special
[19:20] than any other bush in fact that bush
[19:22] might have just had a seventh grade
[19:24] education
[19:26] wow but I'm going to put my father fire
[19:29] on that bush not so that people will see
[19:31] the bush I want Moses to see more than
[19:33] the bush I want him to understand how my
[19:36] fire can fall on that bush and it not be
[19:39] burned because don't tell me God's fire
[19:42] is not consuming fire it is
[19:44] consuming fire the fire of God oh will
[19:49] consume everything in its
[19:52] path and that's why I wonder sometime
[19:55] when people are begging for fire if they
[19:57] really know what they're asking
[19:59] for because fire just won't give you the
[20:02] Willy Willies or the Goosebumps or make
[20:04] the hair stand up on on your arm the
[20:07] fire will absolutely consume everything
[20:11] that is not like
[20:13] God so do you really want the
[20:16] fire you see does everything have to be
[20:19] right for the fire to fall it has to be
[20:21] in
[20:22] order but it doesn't have to be perfect
[20:26] but it has to be in order
[20:29] the Bible talks about how the priest
[20:30] laid everything in order wood right you
[20:33] know rocks right everything put just
[20:36] right and then that Perpetual ever
[20:38] burning fire of God fell on the Altar
[20:41] and the priest who were not given the
[20:44] responsibility of recreating that
[20:46] fire the priests were then given the
[20:49] responsibility of protecting that fire
[20:51] guarding that fire so that it didn't go
[20:55] out because if it went out the folk were
[20:57] in trouble
[20:59] when they dab in AB B who they got this
[21:01] idea that that that fire is okay but but
[21:03] we can do that we can we can put some
[21:05] fire together like that and so here they
[21:07] come and they tried to bring a fire that
[21:09] God didn't
[21:12] start that's more dangerous than the
[21:15] Holy Fire when you start trying to bring
[21:17] a fire that you created with your own
[21:19] head ask Abraham what happens you get a
[21:22] little boy that you don't know what to
[21:24] do
[21:25] with you get an Ishmael you don't know
[21:28] what to do with him because he is now
[21:30] old enough that he's mocking your
[21:32] promised child Isaac and he's got to be
[21:35] dealt with and this is what happened
[21:37] when we try to make a Revival out of our
[21:39] own knowledge or Moses trying to deliver
[21:43] the children of Israel by slaying an
[21:44] Egyptian with his own power then he had
[21:46] to forsake them that's right he couldn't
[21:48] even stay around to help them he had to
[21:50] run from his life so what he thought was
[21:52] a good idea at the moment was not
[21:54] particularly a good idea but it drove
[21:57] him to the backside of the de desert
[21:58] where God teaches all of his
[22:00] prophets backside of the
[22:04] desert
[22:06] lonely your companions become
[22:11] scorpions and
[22:14] serpents rocks heila monsters great day
[22:17] in the morning you I'm telling you you
[22:21] anyway that's who your companions are
[22:23] you start talking to
[22:25] Cactus you're on the backside of the
[22:28] desert
[22:29] and so you don't want to produce try to
[22:31] produce something in your own strength
[22:33] in your own power in your own intellect
[22:35] you want to wait on the fire of God the
[22:36] fire of God fell on this bush and Moses
[22:40] turned to see this special Bush it
[22:43] wasn't special five minutes before it's
[22:44] now special because God's fire is on it
[22:48] nothing you can
[22:50] do will make you any more special then
[22:53] God sees you already if you've said yes
[22:56] to him am
[22:58] it is not you who makes yourself special
[23:02] it is the fire of the Lord on your life
[23:05] that makes you
[23:06] special why that bush because God just
[23:09] decided that's the bush I'm going to
[23:12] fall on now people have a problem with
[23:15] the Sovereign choice of God but I tell
[23:17] you you just go through the scripture
[23:18] and he could have chosen Egypt he could
[23:20] have chosen he could have chosen the
[23:22] Philistines he could have chosen the
[23:24] Canaanites he could have chosen Any
[23:25] Nation but he didn't
[23:29] he chose
[23:30] Israel he chose Jacob he chose Abraham
[23:34] he could have chosen others but those
[23:36] are the ones he chose H to put his you
[23:39] know special Covenant with uh special
[23:42] promises activated in their lives it's a
[23:45] powerful thing so Moses sees the fire of
[23:47] God on a bush but it's the bush itself
[23:50] is not being consumed he turns to see
[23:53] this sign he saw God's presence there he
[23:56] knew something was was uh up and the
[24:00] turning point in in the difference
[24:04] between raw and Tove the difference
[24:06] between staying on the gerbal wheel the
[24:09] hamster wheel and finally beginning to
[24:12] accomplish something for God it's always
[24:15] at the turning point now brother brandom
[24:18] was talking about in a message turning
[24:21] the corner there's something powerful
[24:24] about those those Junctions in time
[24:27] where a COR has to be turned Paul Keith
[24:31] ministers about about the fact and and
[24:33] we've heard Caleb say similar things too
[24:35] that it it cannot be church as usual
[24:38] something has to turn and we can't make
[24:41] it
[24:43] turn it's going to take the the the the
[24:46] chyos moment of the lord it's going to
[24:49] take a Divine moed an appointment from
[24:52] God to turn things and we've got to be a
[24:56] people sensitive enough to say wait a
[24:58] minute God's doing something new over
[25:00] here in this bush I better turn aside to
[25:03] to see and to hear what it's all
[25:06] about come on and and as Paul Keith has
[25:10] taught us many many times over the years
[25:12] God did something so profound and so
[25:14] significant and so powerful one
[25:15] generation ago and yet people still
[25:18] refuse to turn aside and see and hear
[25:21] what God
[25:22] did they'll just say God did a amazing
[25:25] thing there were great signs wonders and
[25:26] miracles and powers and he told people
[25:28] their names and read their addresses and
[25:30] and praise God that's so wonderful and
[25:31] we can do that too
[25:33] and the problem is there's a whole lot
[25:36] more to getting us to the place where we
[25:39] can be used in the way that God has
[25:40] called us to be used that's the turning
[25:42] point or the Tipping Point and that's
[25:44] where many of us are in this life and
[25:46] that's why it's been so hard on us the
[25:48] last season is because we're approaching
[25:51] the coming out of a season of of real
[25:56] compression bringing bring us back into
[25:59] the narrow way bringing us back into the
[26:01] narrow entrance back into his side you
[26:06] want to go back into his side do you
[26:08] want to be found in Christ I do and I
[26:12] got to find how to get in there I've got
[26:14] to find out how to be in Christ because
[26:17] to be in Christ means that I am no
[26:20] longer functioning off of my mortal life
[26:24] I am now functioning off of a life that
[26:27] has been
[26:31] given to me and the only way I can
[26:35] receive that life is through a union
[26:38] that must take place now if you think
[26:41] this Union idea is a new idea or or that
[26:44] brother Brandon was the first person to
[26:46] mention this Union you're wrong this
[26:48] Union was something that God spoke to
[26:51] Watchman KN and witness Le about in
[26:53] early China many many many years ago and
[26:57] they wrote Amazing books about the
[27:00] breaking of the soul the releasing of
[27:02] the spirit and about the organic Union
[27:06] of life with Jesus Christ but it was a
[27:09] language that was so foreign to people
[27:12] in the in the
[27:13] teens in the
[27:15] 20s so so so foreign that most people
[27:19] put it aside choked over it and you know
[27:22] a Watchman has been called everything
[27:24] from a prophet to a devil just like
[27:25] brother brandom just like anybody else
[27:27] that God's used some people call them uh
[27:29] uh God and some people call them Satan I
[27:31] mean that's just how it goes It goes
[27:32] that way today uh you ministers know
[27:35] what that's all about don't ever get
[27:37] excited because somebody says something
[27:38] nice about you don't even get excited
[27:42] just graciously say thank you shake your
[27:43] head and keep walking because people are
[27:47] fickle and the tongues that bless you
[27:49] today will curse you
[27:51] tomorrow and God allowed it to be that
[27:53] way because he wants to keep you humble
[27:55] and keep your head
[27:57] leaking so don't get puffed up because
[27:59] somebody says you did
[28:02] good wait a minute Amen brother amen
[28:07] amen amen
[28:08] amen and so it's an amazing thing to
[28:12] turn aside it's more than just you know
[28:14] some people think that's locking
[28:15] yourself in the closet and fasting 40
[28:17] days and and not having you know I'm
[28:19] going to Fast Facebook you're not
[28:22] fasting Facebook if you check it
[28:23] secretly every day and don't
[28:25] post that's not fasting Facebook
[28:30] you know I'm going to fast TV you'd be
[28:32] better off not to have it in the first
[28:37] place I'm going to fast this I'm going
[28:40] to fast that and and and so many people
[28:42] think that we look we can't all live
[28:44] like the maharaji in a cave somewhere on
[28:47] the other side of the world some of us
[28:49] have to live in a functioning world
[28:51] because we've been called as as
[28:54] paradigms our life have been C our lives
[28:57] have been called as prophetic Parables
[28:59] for people to look at and they can't see
[29:01] us if we're always hidden somewhere so
[29:05] the prophet not only the prophetic
[29:07] people of the Lord not only have to
[29:09] understand what it means to go up on the
[29:10] mountain and into the cave to hear what
[29:12] God has to say they also have to learn
[29:14] what it means to stomp down out of that
[29:16] mountain and give the people thus saith
[29:20] the Lord and thus sayith the Lord means
[29:23] not filtered through man's Doctrine not
[29:26] filtered through man's tradition not
[29:28] filtered through man's opinion thus
[29:31] saith the
[29:33] Lord that little prophetic teacher there
[29:36] Paul Keith Davis nothing little about
[29:38] him but but him there uh here here's
[29:41] what he says I've been in conferences
[29:43] and spoken with him and he' tell the
[29:45] people tonight I am going to give you
[29:48] thus saeth the
[29:50] Lord and that night the crowd would
[29:52] swell the word got out we're going to
[29:55] hear thus sayeth the Lord from the mouth
[29:57] of a prophetic voice voice and he'd get
[29:59] up and preach on the importance of thus
[30:01] sayeth the Lord and then say I'm going
[30:02] to give you thus sayith the Lord here it
[30:04] is thus sayith the Lord you need thus
[30:08] sayith the
[30:12] Lord oh yeah it's true but it's quite a
[30:14] let
[30:16] down because so many people came
[30:18] expecting to hear something
[30:22] new something outstanding because most
[30:25] of our understanding and thoughts toward
[30:27] prophecy are
[30:28] I want to come and join the bless me
[30:30] club and I want a prophet or a prophetic
[30:33] gift to tell me how wonderful I am and
[30:35] how good I'm doing and how much God love
[30:37] the Bible told you how much God loved
[30:39] you the holy spirit in in your life is
[30:43] telling you that believe that because
[30:46] sometimes when we don't believe it God
[30:47] will give us a word through a prophetic
[30:49] voice to confirm it he certainly will
[30:52] but I'm telling you more than
[30:53] confirmation of his love look the
[30:56] biggest confirmation of his love is that
[30:58] love Came
[30:59] Down come on condescended God
[31:02] condescended into the body of a man died
[31:06] on the cross shed perfect blood created
[31:09] for Redemption so that I didn't have to
[31:12] that's right see and the reason why the
[31:15] Apostle Paul Could Die daily is because
[31:18] he died by fellowshipping with God With
[31:22] Jesus in his death when you fellowship
[31:26] with Jesus in his his death when you can
[31:29] identify yourself in his death it causes
[31:33] you to be reminded daily that you're
[31:38] dead and the reason why we need to be
[31:40] reminded daily that we have died in
[31:45] Christ oh this is New
[31:47] Testament this is Galatians this is
[31:49] Colossians this is Romans the reason why
[31:53] it's important for us to be reminded
[31:55] that we have died in Christ is because
[31:57] the old life the old nature likes to
[32:00] rise up at the most inopportune moments
[32:03] to slap us around to remind us of who we
[32:06] used to
[32:09] be not who we are who we used to be the
[32:13] devil that's all he has the only tool he
[32:16] has is to remind you of what you used to
[32:19] be but he makes it feel so real right
[32:22] now and then he reminds you see remember
[32:24] how you acted remember how you spoke
[32:26] remember what you did see that's who you
[32:28] really are it's a lie it's an absolute
[32:30] lie if you've been washed in the blood
[32:32] of the lamb and Born Again by the holy
[32:34] spirit of God that ugly thing that rises
[32:37] up in you is not who you
[32:40] are that's who the enemy would like you
[32:42] to be but there's supposed to be another
[32:45] life in
[32:47] you and this war that we fight you know
[32:50] a lot of people are always talking about
[32:52] well Paul said there's just going to be
[32:53] this war in when I seek to do good
[32:55] Evil's present evil I want to do that
[32:57] which which I would do and could do and
[32:58] shouldn't do what and have do and read
[33:01] it in King James it'll it'll confuse you
[33:04] this struggle that was going on and it
[33:05] was probably left that way for a purpose
[33:07] because in read to read it is a struggle
[33:09] and it reminds you that there was this
[33:11] struggling of natures that goes on in
[33:13] our lives brother vandom taught taught
[33:15] in his in his ministry that the greatest
[33:18] battle ever
[33:19] fought was going to be fought on the
[33:22] Battlefield of the Mind and that's why
[33:25] we often preach it's all in your head
[33:29] and it's literally all in our
[33:32] head it's really a struggle to see who
[33:35] our head will
[33:36] be will you be the head of your life or
[33:39] will you grab a hold of the head of
[33:41] Jesus Christ if you grab a hold of his
[33:44] head it will silence the
[33:47] war if you'll hold on to Jesus Christ as
[33:50] your head never let him go it will
[33:54] silence the war it doesn't work for me
[33:57] you say it will work for you when you
[33:59] approach it with the right attitude
[34:02] instead of approaching it in
[34:04] unbelief the biggest problem we have in
[34:07] the body is the problem of
[34:11] unbelief it's not an uncommon problem
[34:14] ever even we've read in the scripture
[34:17] Lord I believe help thou my
[34:20] unbelief telling us that there is a
[34:22] struggle sometime to believe to not
[34:25] believe to believe to not believe but if
[34:28] you want to access the Tove seeds of
[34:31] Destiny in your life you have to make
[34:33] mama can't make it for you I wish I had
[34:36] some help Mama can't make it for you
[34:38] Daddy can't make this decision for you
[34:41] husband can't make it for wife wife
[34:44] can't make it for husband and dear God
[34:47] your pastor cannot make this decision
[34:51] for
[34:54] you you have to make this decision
[34:58] you have to decide I'm going to approach
[35:01] god with full confidence because I want
[35:05] you to know there is not only a
[35:07] Deliverance promised there is a total
[35:10] Deliverance that is Promised for the
[35:13] Bride of Jesus
[35:15] Christ that's why God sent
[35:17] Moses that's why God sent Moses that's
[35:20] why we read The Exodus that's why the
[35:22] whole story is there it's it's it's a
[35:25] model of another Exodus
[35:29] to the Jewish people that's the most
[35:31] important event in their history the
[35:34] Jewish people believe and teach that the
[35:37] demonstration of God's power in the
[35:39] splitting of the Red Sea was the
[35:42] greatest single display of God's raw
[35:45] power in the
[35:46] earth that's the significance they they
[35:49] give to The Exodus but that Exodus was
[35:53] just a
[35:54] shadow that was just a model for another
[35:57] Exodus
[35:58] Exodus you see that Exodus because of
[36:01] their struggle LED them in a 40-year
[36:03] loop after loop after loop after Loop
[36:06] through the
[36:08] Wilderness but eventually they came to
[36:10] Deliverance right eventually God God
[36:13] along the way took took care of their
[36:16] enemies without and he started taking
[36:18] care of their enemies
[36:23] within well I didn't look around because
[36:25] I thought it was profound I looked
[36:27] around because I knew it was true that's
[36:29] what God does today right he the enemy
[36:32] wants you to focus on your your external
[36:34] enemies
[36:37] right he don't love me she don't like me
[36:41] you see the way they looked at
[36:44] me the enemy wants you to focus on your
[36:47] external enemies so that you won't have
[36:49] time to deal with a
[36:54] monster it's in the realm of the soul
[36:56] that the monster needs to be
[36:58] slain there's a dragon in there that
[37:02] needs his head cut off and needs some
[37:04] mighty Champions to swing him around by
[37:06] the beard that chopped off severed head
[37:09] of the enemy and say no more no more no
[37:12] more will you be able to dictate my life
[37:17] or torment my head because I'm going to
[37:20] win this battle of the mind because
[37:22] Jesus Paid the price not only for me to
[37:24] win the battle over external enemies but
[37:27] he paid the price for me to be able to
[37:28] slay the enemies within and that's why
[37:31] we need the revelation of the word of
[37:34] God we don't need doctrine as Doctrine
[37:36] we need doctrine by revelation we need
[37:39] to know that what we believe is given to
[37:42] us by the revelation of the Holy Ghost
[37:46] that we're not just carrying around the
[37:49] traditional uh uh you know Theology of
[37:53] past Generations but can we see it in
[37:55] the word and when we do how will we
[37:59] respond the modern Church world this is
[38:02] their favorite slogan it doesn't really
[38:03] mean that it doesn't really mean that it
[38:04] doesn't really mean that it didn't
[38:05] really mean that it didn't really mean
[38:07] that so you can't even use the word to
[38:10] help people today but religiously
[38:13] educated stupid you can't help
[38:15] them you can't help them by saying look
[38:18] there was a time in my Ministry in the
[38:20] early days we're talking 30 years ago
[38:23] that you could just tell folks the word
[38:24] said yeah it's right here
[38:29] oh I never knew that was in there but
[38:32] now we have become so educated TBN has
[38:35] made the theologians of all of
[38:40] us The Gospel According to
[38:44] Charisma you don't have to say nothing I
[38:47] get my food on
[38:49] YouTube I'm telling you I thank God for
[38:52] all technology I thank God for Christian
[38:54] television I certainly do because I get
[38:56] I get my chances to preach every week on
[38:58] Christian television through the Nations
[39:00] I really appreciate Christian television
[39:02] I really appreciate Charisma sometime
[39:04] they've really reported some good stuff
[39:05] and I really appreciate YouTube there's
[39:08] some amazing things on YouTube but I
[39:09] want you to know we need the Holy Ghost
[39:11] discernment to be able to judge between
[39:13] to and
[39:16] raw you see that's the that's the wisdom
[39:18] Solomon had two women claimed the same
[39:22] baby and so uh Solomon was looking for
[39:25] something more in those two mothers than
[39:27] the behavior they were displaying that
[39:29] day before his throne he was looking
[39:32] beyond their mouth both of them were
[39:34] were lwd women both of them had not
[39:36] lived very good lives and here they are
[39:38] struggling over the same baby and they
[39:41] they wanted Solomon to make the decision
[39:42] over which one gets to take the living
[39:44] baby home the other baby's gone and he
[39:47] looks and sees how they're both
[39:48] struggling over the baby and he decides
[39:50] I've got to look deeper than what I hear
[39:52] and I've got to look deeper than what I
[39:53] see I've got to see if I can see and
[39:55] identify the seege of purpose in these
[39:58] women's life cuz neither one of them
[39:59] have lived the life of a
[40:02] mother remember what they' just
[40:05] done I mean that's hard that'd be hard
[40:07] that'd be terrible we can't even fathom
[40:09] that neither one of them had displayed
[40:11] the character of a mother so he had to
[40:12] look beyond what he saw what he heard
[40:14] what he knew about them and he had to be
[40:16] able to identify the character of a
[40:18] mother he had to look for the seat of
[40:20] Destiny in one of them though it had not
[40:22] yet manifested which one of these women
[40:24] did God truly call to be a
[40:28] mother because having babies doesn't
[40:31] make you a
[40:33] mother it's like having a church doesn't
[40:35] make you a pastor and having a vision
[40:37] doesn't make you a
[40:41] prophet and being in a garage doesn't
[40:43] make you a
[40:46] car smelling like a rose doesn't make
[40:48] you a flower hey and running fast
[40:51] doesn't make you a
[40:52] horse somebody say
[40:55] Amen it's more than that
[40:58] and he looked into one of these mothers
[40:59] who said let her have him finally the
[41:01] struggle was over I'm I'm tired of this
[41:03] you can have let her have the child I
[41:06] don't want him anymore I I I want her to
[41:09] have him I want her to raise him it's
[41:11] her baby I don't want and oh Solomon
[41:13] said there it is there is the seeds of a
[41:17] mother he was able to forget what they
[41:19] had just done and how they had lived
[41:21] their lives and he was able to identify
[41:23] in that woman that God had truly indeed
[41:26] called her to be a mother and he said no
[41:28] you're here this is your child you're
[41:31] the real mother go and raise this child
[41:34] Lord we need the wisdom of Solomon
[41:36] although it wasn't wisdom he was asking
[41:38] for he was praying for understanding
[41:40] that he might be able to judge
[41:44] between toen
[41:46] raw that's the words toen raw because
[41:50] sometimes oh my my my my my sometimes
[41:54] what we see prospering we want to call
[41:56] it Tove because it's
[41:58] blooming and when we something see
[42:00] something shriveled up we want to call
[42:02] it raw because we don't see it producing
[42:04] any fruit and so we will make our
[42:07] discernment based on what we see with
[42:09] our eyes and hear with our ears how many
[42:11] of you know not in this Supernatural
[42:13] hour not in this hour are you going to
[42:15] be able to judge by what you see in here
[42:17] you're going to have to have the knower
[42:19] you're going to have to have something
[42:21] on the inside of the inside of the
[42:23] inside in the control tower of your
[42:26] spirit
[42:27] I know exactly where the Ark of the
[42:29] Covenant is and I didn't have to ask
[42:31] Indiana
[42:33] Jones I know exactly where the Ark of
[42:35] the Covenant is it is right here in
[42:41] me this is The Mercy Seat this is where
[42:45] the blood lays wow right here this is
[42:49] the house of the shakina sh glory of the
[42:53] Lord here it is I'm not waiting on the
[42:57] Glory I have the glory living inside of
[43:06] me where's the demonstration where's the
[43:09] where's the glitter where's the
[43:14] feathers the internal glory of God does
[43:19] not come to give us more signs although
[43:23] we need more signs when the glory of God
[43:26] moves moves into the life of The
[43:28] Believer by the revelation of the word
[43:31] that's how it gets
[43:35] there and in order for it to be there on
[43:37] The Mercy Seat this great Revelation in
[43:41] order for God to speak out of that place
[43:43] between the Cherry
[43:45] beims in order for God to be able to
[43:47] speak out of that place it's got to be
[43:49] emptied first you got to get all those
[43:51] Devils
[43:52] out come on you've got to slay the
[43:55] Dragon
[43:58] you got to get that attitude under
[44:00] control come on so that it's not you
[44:03] speaking out of your but it's it's the
[44:05] one sitting on the on the Ark of the
[44:06] Covenant here speaking I'll meet you
[44:08] there I'll meet you there isn't it
[44:10] amazing God said I'll meet you there
[44:13] he's still saying today I'll meet you in
[44:17] there the angel of the Lord said to
[44:19] brother random in the tent I'll meet
[44:22] you in
[44:24] there that's where I'll meet you in
[44:28] there there is a secret
[44:31] place where God wants to meet with his
[44:34] bride in intimacy to reveal to us a
[44:38] relationship that produces Authority and
[44:41] not
[44:43] power all of those folk who are telling
[44:46] us that we're powerless and we need more
[44:48] power we absolutely are under a
[44:51] misunderstanding it is not more power
[44:54] that we
[44:55] need because Jesus said said ter in
[44:57] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[45:00] from on high and that power is the life
[45:03] of Jesus Christ Living inside of the
[45:05] believer because everything the father
[45:07] was he poured into his son Jesus Christ
[45:09] and everything that was in Jesus he
[45:11] poured upon the church the elect by the
[45:14] power of the Holy
[45:16] Ghost so what you have in you is not
[45:19] just a warm and fuzzy feeling if you've
[45:22] received the Holy Ghost the true genuine
[45:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire you
[45:30] have the zo life of God living inside of
[45:35] you and you can't have the life of God
[45:37] without having
[45:41] Glory
[45:44] Glory why don't we see this why don't we
[45:47] see that why don't we see the other
[45:49] because we don't know what's in
[45:51] us and we're waiting on it to fall on us
[45:55] if Bobby Connor were here this year he'd
[45:57] say like ripe cherries from a
[45:59] tree we're waiting on something to fall
[46:02] on us that's already in us and we
[46:05] haven't understood it because our minds
[46:08] are still
[46:11] veiled I tell you what we need we need
[46:13] more than fire in a bush on we need the
[46:17] sword of the lord we need the not just
[46:21] the Written Letter when we think about
[46:23] you know brother Caleb was talking about
[46:25] how good his wife an is is at at finding
[46:28] the address in a in what we called in
[46:30] the in the Sunday school class years ago
[46:32] a sword drill and so when we say the
[46:35] word of God is a sword we're not just
[46:37] talking about uh Genesis to Revelation
[46:40] we're not just talking about two books
[46:42] put together the older Covenant and the
[46:44] newer Covenant we're not just talking
[46:46] about the printed page we're not just
[46:48] talking about the living letter of the
[46:50] word I want you to know there's a sword
[46:53] for the bride there is a sword for the
[46:56] bride
[46:58] and it's more than just a Written Letter
[47:00] it's more than just a blackback book is
[47:03] that big enough
[47:05] on I believe in big
[47:09] ones big
[47:11] ones it's more than this it's the
[47:15] revelation of Jesus Christ that gets
[47:20] this
[47:21] on Thy
[47:23] word have I laid out on my coffee table
[47:26] to make everything think I'm
[47:31] religious Thy word have I used to
[47:33] decorate the shelves of my living room
[47:35] so that everyone will come and know that
[47:36] I'm a student of the word no Thy word
[47:40] have I hid in my heart that I might not
[47:42] sin against thee Oh God let me tell you
[47:45] the word that he was talking about was
[47:47] not the written word there was no
[47:48] written word accessible to the Common
[47:51] Man in that hour he wasn't talking about
[47:53] the ri written word alone he was talking
[47:56] about the The Living Word of God the
[48:00] Living Word of God somebody say the
[48:02] Living Word of God what does the Living
[48:05] Word of God look like it looks like the
[48:08] sun if you want to know what the Living
[48:10] Word looks like it looks like the son
[48:14] because in the beginning was the word
[48:15] and the Word was with God and the Word
[48:17] was God John 1:1 John 114 says and the
[48:23] word became
[48:27] flesh and dwelt Among
[48:30] Us the Pentecostal charismatic World
[48:34] spend a lot of time being on witch
[48:36] hunts and if they find out that you've
[48:38] baptized someone in the name of the Lord
[48:40] Jesus Christ they've immediately got to
[48:41] put you in some kind of Oneness
[48:45] category I was raised Assembly of God
[48:48] isn't that a
[48:50] shocker I was never raised United
[48:52] Pentecostal I was never raised in the
[48:54] Oneness church I was in fact we were
[48:56] were we were you know warned against
[48:58] those people but by revelation we
[49:01] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:03] Christ because we got this crazy idea
[49:05] that that's what the Bible
[49:08] said that's
[49:10] right and they say well what about what
[49:12] Peter said that's right that's right
[49:14] that's right what about Matthew 28
[49:16] listen Peter was standing there when
[49:18] Jesus made that statement baptized if he
[49:20] made it baptized in the name of the
[49:21] father Son and the Holy Ghost Peter was
[49:23] standing right there and Peter's the one
[49:25] that had this word from the Lord Lord
[49:27] who am I Peter who do men say that I am
[49:28] oh some say you're Elijah reincarnated
[49:31] or Revisited some say you're Isaiah one
[49:33] of the prophets who do you say I am
[49:35] Peter said I know exactly who you are
[49:36] you are the
[49:38] Messiah you are the Messiah you are the
[49:41] manifested Son of
[49:44] God and Jesus turned to him and said
[49:46] blessed are you Simon B born of Jonah
[49:49] blessed are you chosen are you not
[49:53] because you've learned something in
[49:55] seminary not because you're father
[49:56] Earthly father taught you something
[49:58] Jonah had nothing to do with this I want
[50:00] you to know you are blessed today
[50:03] because Flesh and Blood hath not
[50:05] revealed this to you who I am it was
[50:08] revealed to you of my heavenly father
[50:10] and upon this
[50:15] Revelation I will build my
[50:18] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[50:22] Prevail against it Revelation 10:7 but
[50:25] the days of the voice of the seventh
[50:27] angel the
[50:30] mystery singular of God shall be
[50:34] fulfilled as he hath declared to his
[50:36] servants the prophets
[50:41] plural well are there many Mysteries
[50:46] yes but one of the greatest Mysteries of
[50:49] the end time that God has unlocked is to
[50:52] help us to know who Jesus is
[50:57] you say everybody knows who Jes
[50:58] everybody in church knows who Jesus is
[51:00] no they don't because some people think
[51:03] he's just an you know like a Hallmark
[51:05] card God cared enough to send the very
[51:08] best no honey God didn't care enough to
[51:11] send the very best God cared enough to
[51:13] step down off the
[51:17] throne come in a body of
[51:20] Flesh and in that body of Flesh there
[51:22] was not one ounce not one drop of the
[51:25] blood of Joseph his Earthly father
[51:27] and his blood didn't come from his
[51:28] mother Mary where did his blood come
[51:31] from God created this Divine blood this
[51:34] Holy Blood the chemistry of the blood is
[51:37] not what made it so powerful it was the
[51:39] life that was placed in that blood that
[51:42] made it so powerful and to have that
[51:44] blood on the on the mercy seat of your
[51:46] life is to release in you the Zoe
[51:49] eternal life of God it doesn't get any
[51:51] better than that and so one of the
[51:53] greatest mysteries of all time is to
[51:56] understand that Jehovah of the Old
[51:57] Testament is Jesus Christ of the New
[52:05] Testament not a Lesser God not a
[52:09] representative for God but God in
[52:14] flesh not in the same office of the
[52:16] father not in the same office of the
[52:19] Holy Spirit but nonetheless God in flesh
[52:22] so much so I'm hurrying not really
[52:27] so much so that that Jesus said when
[52:30] you've seen me you've seen the father
[52:32] when I've spoke to you you've heard the
[52:34] father so much so that the apostles told
[52:37] us that that in him
[52:41] dwelt a piece of the godhead
[52:48] bodily one person of the godhead
[52:54] bodily what did it say were
[52:57] quiet you'd never you'd never know that
[53:00] at least 80% of the people here this
[53:02] morning in streaming believe this you
[53:03] wouldn't believe it would you as quiet
[53:04] as it is why because you're treading on
[53:08] that Dangerous Ground I want you to know
[53:10] that is so simple and yet so confusing
[53:12] to people and it's one of those holy
[53:14] cows you know that people have set up
[53:17] like India where they'll starve to death
[53:19] and worship the cow kill that thing yeah
[53:23] a Hamburg make a hamburger out of him
[53:27] that's right you'd be surprised how many
[53:29] hamburgers you can have out of those
[53:30] sacred cows kill it bleed it out chop it
[53:35] up eat it with
[53:38] onions and when we get to the place
[53:40] where we're willing to slay our sacred
[53:44] cows and take the Revelation that God
[53:47] wants to give his people in this hour
[53:49] and we judge that well that's so simple
[53:51] I don't think that really matters that's
[53:52] just kind of semantics anyway doesn't
[53:54] matter how you're baptized doesn't
[53:55] matter how you see God doesn't matter
[53:56] how you explain
[53:58] Jesus it matter wonder how the father
[54:01] feels when you tell him that his Plan of
[54:03] Salvation was so confusing that it
[54:05] really doesn't even matter how you
[54:07] believe it that's right it matters
[54:11] because it is the mystery of God that
[54:15] was to be finished at the sounding of
[54:18] the voice of the seventh angel because
[54:21] it is the mystery that unlocks all of
[54:26] other
[54:29] Mysteries you cannot understand seven
[54:32] Thunders you cannot understand Seven
[54:35] Seals you cannot understand the original
[54:39] sin you cannot understand the the real
[54:43] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[54:46] it's not just speaking in tongues it's
[54:49] releasing the character of Jesus Christ
[54:51] all other Mysteries are
[54:54] released unveiled
[54:57] out of the mystery of God
[55:00] right he said it the mystery of
[55:04] God that he is the
[55:07] same in that sense the Jews are way
[55:09] ahead of the
[55:12] church Amen brother because every day of
[55:16] their lives when they wake up they pray
[55:19] the
[55:20] shma
[55:21] here oh
[55:23] Israel the Lord thy God is
[55:27] one you can't contain him you can't
[55:31] divide him he has many offices he has
[55:36] many demonstrations he has many
[55:37] personalities he has many attributes but
[55:40] you can't divide him the Holy Ghost in
[55:43] you is just as much God as the father
[55:46] above the Holy Ghost in you is just as
[55:49] much God as the son
[55:59] why is that important because it reveals
[56:00] to us where the Ark of the Covenant is
[56:03] it reveals to us that we're not waiting
[56:05] on something else to fall on us we're
[56:07] waiting on something to draw out from
[56:09] within
[56:10] us what God has placed there to bring us
[56:14] to fruitfulness it's in me somebody say
[56:16] it's in me now we have to move
[56:20] on Moses tried rescuing Israel in his
[56:22] own power slayed the Egyptian and failed
[56:25] he had to flee for 4 years which was an
[56:27] entire generation a whole generation of
[56:30] training 40 years
[56:34] yeah only 10 years shy of 50
[56:42] years think of it I want you to know
[56:45] when we learn that we cannot accomplish
[56:47] Bridal business in our own power in our
[56:51] own
[56:52] strength as long as you're looking at
[56:54] your guns
[57:03] amen as long as you're looking at your
[57:06] own brute force and you think you can do
[57:08] Bridal business or Kingdom Business with
[57:11] your
[57:12] muscles any of
[57:17] them you can't do Bridal business with
[57:20] these
[57:21] muscles you can't do Bridal business
[57:23] with this muscle
[57:26] we can only do Bridal business when we
[57:29] surrender to the one who sits in the
[57:30] control tower of Our Lives if we've
[57:32] allowed him
[57:34] there come on
[57:37] Lighthouse come on control tower
[57:41] Houston we have a
[57:44] problem you're right we do we're losing
[57:47] communication with the control tower wow
[57:50] there's one place you don't want to be
[57:52] and lose communication with the control
[57:54] tower and that's where out there in the
[57:56] far expanses of the universe with your
[57:59] Lifeline cut
[58:03] off when your Lifeline is cut off when
[58:06] your communication with the control
[58:07] tower is cut off what cuts it off sin
[58:10] what is sin
[58:12] unbelief when your communication with
[58:14] the control tower is cut off by unbelief
[58:17] you're on your
[58:19] own and that is not where the bride
[58:21] wants to be that's not where the sons
[58:23] want to be in this hour on our own
[58:26] because all we'll do is slay one
[58:27] Egyptian and have to flee the
[58:30] business it's not enough it's on the
[58:33] back side of the desert I just want to
[58:34] ask you very seriously I know it's time
[58:36] is moving on but if you think I'm I mean
[58:40] I I didn't create
[58:41] time where I'm from there is
[58:45] none where I came from there is no time
[58:48] and bless God I believe that what I have
[58:50] to say this morning you you may take
[58:51] this the wrong way but I believe what I
[58:53] have to say this morning is more
[58:54] important than a football game on the
[58:56] television this
[58:59] afternoon what I think you ought to do
[59:01] just go ahead and subscribe to ESPN
[59:03] alerts right on your phone and you can
[59:05] sit right here and get the
[59:08] score with one side of your
[59:11] brain you can focus that hear that and
[59:14] the other side of your brain assuming
[59:16] that you've wak that part
[59:18] up you can hear what the Lord wants us
[59:21] to know for right now because everything
[59:24] that we have heard this week is building
[59:26] and building and building and we think
[59:27] so then why do we have to come and say
[59:29] something else we've already heard
[59:30] tremendous truth we've already heard
[59:32] such amazing thing it's because there is
[59:34] an ordained truth there is an ordained
[59:37] Truth for Saturday morning there's an
[59:40] ordained Truth for Saturday morning
[59:42] October the 10th 2015 that cannot be
[59:46] released on the morning of October the
[59:48] 9th 2015 or the evening of October the
[59:51] 10th 2015 God keeps appointments with
[59:55] his bride
[59:57] not just one but daily and all through
[59:59] the day and you don't want to be over
[1:00:02] here if God has an appointment with you
[1:00:05] over
[1:00:12] there he tried independently freeing
[1:00:14] Israel that'll never work that's that
[1:00:16] whole thing about power and authority
[1:00:18] that we tried to get to a few minutes
[1:00:19] ago we didn't make it there we don't
[1:00:21] need more power to fall on us we need to
[1:00:23] recognize the power that's already been
[1:00:25] given to us by the Holy Ghost who lives
[1:00:27] inside of us what we need a revelation
[1:00:29] of is not more power we need a
[1:00:31] revelation of what it means to be Sons
[1:00:33] what it means to be bride we need a
[1:00:35] revelation of the authority that comes
[1:00:37] with the office amen now I may believe
[1:00:40] this a little different than than than
[1:00:42] many folks out there and and maybe even
[1:00:45] our speakers I I I'm just going to say
[1:00:47] this is coming from me I am not one of
[1:00:50] those people who teach that you can
[1:00:51] qualify to be the bride of Christ I am
[1:00:54] not one of those people who believe that
[1:00:56] that that uh you'd all you know you can
[1:00:58] work your way there or get holy enough
[1:01:00] and be there I truly believe that you
[1:01:04] are bride because of what God knew about
[1:01:06] you before the foundation of the world
[1:01:09] not how good you do while you're
[1:01:12] here but by election I said it there it
[1:01:15] is I said it by election and I believe
[1:01:18] you are elected to that place not
[1:01:21] because you're better than someone
[1:01:23] else I believe you are elected to that
[1:01:26] office because of God knowing you in out
[1:01:29] up down upside downside there are some
[1:01:32] that will hear the revelation of the
[1:01:34] word and respond like a thorough
[1:01:38] bread there are others who will hear the
[1:01:40] revelation of the word and respond like
[1:01:42] a
[1:01:43] jackass I said
[1:01:48] it mule
[1:01:51] religion got your attention now Lord
[1:01:55] I've lived a long time I've never heard
[1:01:56] a Pentecostal holess preacher
[1:02:02] curse mule religion that's what a mule
[1:02:05] does you tell a mule what to do and he
[1:02:08] responds he responds all right don't
[1:02:19] he he'll say
[1:02:22] Amen a mule will say Amen but he's just
[1:02:26] a hybrid
[1:02:30] right he couldn't produce
[1:02:37] his that old mule couldn't reproduce
[1:02:40] himself if he wanted
[1:02:42] to because he is a hybrid when you take
[1:02:46] truth and mix it with opinion when you
[1:02:48] take truth and mix it with error when
[1:02:51] you take truth and mix it with church
[1:02:53] enity you form a mixture which is a
[1:02:56] hybrid it may run faster it may smell
[1:02:59] better it may produce more of a harvest
[1:03:02] but there's one thing it won't
[1:03:06] do and that's reproduce the life that's
[1:03:09] within it I'm telling you there's a
[1:03:11] bride that God is raising up in this
[1:03:14] hour in every nation of the world he's
[1:03:17] raising up a people because of a deep
[1:03:20] calling to the Deep because of a
[1:03:22] stirring on the inside of the inside of
[1:03:25] the inside that they can't calm that
[1:03:27] they can't quiet because of a voice that
[1:03:30] just cries out at the noise of thy water
[1:03:33] spouts the Deep cth to the
[1:03:37] deep and because there's a deep calling
[1:03:40] there has to be a deep to respond and in
[1:03:43] that bride she will be given the
[1:03:46] blessing of being able to reproduce out
[1:03:50] of her life the very seed of life that
[1:03:54] has been planted Within her what do you
[1:03:57] mean I mean that's where Sons come
[1:04:01] from Sons don't come out of our our
[1:04:05] bowels the word the scripture uses Sons
[1:04:08] real sons are not born through the
[1:04:10] natural womb of a
[1:04:13] woman the sons of God don't come forth
[1:04:16] out of natural wombs they come forth out
[1:04:19] of spiritual
[1:04:22] WBS who was it to was that Caleb or Paul
[1:04:25] Keith Pastor Caleb brother Paul Keith
[1:04:28] I've never called Paul Keith brother
[1:04:29] because he's never called me brother but
[1:04:31] he is my brother so I'll do brother Paul
[1:04:34] Keith Paul Keith got in trouble one time
[1:04:36] on a national radio program or off
[1:04:39] between the sets because he called the
[1:04:40] host a brother and and the and the host
[1:04:42] rebuked him and said don't say that if
[1:04:44] you can help it don't s call me brother
[1:04:46] because that to some people that sounds
[1:04:48] religious to me it sounds like the book
[1:04:49] of Acts
[1:04:53] yeah you are my brother we don't have
[1:04:55] the the same Mammy or the same
[1:04:57] py I am one I'm an only child spoiled
[1:05:00] rotten brat there's my mama she knows it
[1:05:02] she did
[1:05:09] it some of you ladies think that your
[1:05:12] underarm sag I want you to know mine
[1:05:15] really
[1:05:16] sag because my mama when she was getting
[1:05:19] a hold of me when I was growing up she
[1:05:21] didn't she be she couldn't always you
[1:05:23] know whip me she knew how to whip
[1:05:24] brother sister
[1:05:27] she didn't you know they weren't
[1:05:28] teaching affirmation
[1:05:32] then they weren't teaching timeout
[1:05:36] stool they were teaching hide under the
[1:05:38] bed from your
[1:05:40] mama hey because she is com
[1:05:45] in and fury is in her
[1:05:48] eyes and you are going to give up the
[1:05:51] devil
[1:05:53] today right now
[1:05:58] it it it
[1:06:00] worked she'd grabbed me right under that
[1:06:03] arm
[1:06:05] and yes
[1:06:11] sir and then real nicely out of the side
[1:06:14] of around she said don't ever make me do
[1:06:16] that
[1:06:20] again child
[1:06:24] abuser I tell you what it made me want
[1:06:26] to do
[1:06:27] better it made me want to never face
[1:06:30] that wrath again how many of you know
[1:06:32] what I'm talking
[1:06:34] about you got to move on now okay here's
[1:06:37] what here is what God was showing Moses
[1:06:40] he was showing Moses the very opposite
[1:06:42] of what Moses was Moses had been a man
[1:06:45] who lived in his own strength and power
[1:06:48] and God wanted to show Moses what it
[1:06:50] looks like to surrender to another
[1:06:54] life and so so what God did is he put
[1:06:57] his holy fire on that bush and for that
[1:06:59] moment of time that bush did not live
[1:07:04] from its natural
[1:07:07] life if that bush would have been living
[1:07:10] that day with that fire on it drawing
[1:07:14] strength from its roots drawing its life
[1:07:17] from its natural source how many of you
[1:07:19] know what would have happened in a
[1:07:21] matter of seconds in that dry Dusty
[1:07:23] desert there would have been nothing
[1:07:25] there but but a pile of
[1:07:27] Ashes God was showing Moses the contrast
[1:07:30] of who he had been you've been one who
[1:07:32] has always you have always lived off of
[1:07:35] your own strength your intellect what
[1:07:37] you were schooled at what they taught
[1:07:39] you in Egypt your the the strength of
[1:07:41] your bare hands that's how you've lived
[1:07:42] and survived I want to show you what it
[1:07:44] looks like when something is able to
[1:07:47] function to survive even to thrive even
[1:07:50] to be used with a
[1:07:52] message even given a voice
[1:07:56] because it surrenders its natural source
[1:07:59] of life and
[1:08:01] yields to a higher
[1:08:04] life how long did that bush burn I don't
[1:08:07] know 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes 30
[1:08:09] minutes maybe still burning maybe it's
[1:08:10] still burning but what I know is during
[1:08:13] that amount of time that bush wasn't
[1:08:15] living natural Bush
[1:08:20] life you see there's there's carnal
[1:08:24] life there's Church
[1:08:27] Life and
[1:08:30] there's God
[1:08:32] Life Zoey life you
[1:08:36] choose natural
[1:08:38] life is because you have a
[1:08:44] soul and if you live out of that Soul
[1:08:47] life the only life you'll ever know is
[1:08:50] natural life the only strength you'll
[1:08:52] ever have is natural strength
[1:08:56] but you're not just a
[1:08:58] soul you're not just a body it's
[1:09:01] actually your soul that gives your body
[1:09:02] natural life that's why your body can
[1:09:04] Thrive it's because you have a soul
[1:09:06] without your soul and how did you get
[1:09:08] that you got that by the release of the
[1:09:10] Breath of God Adam received the soul
[1:09:12] because God breathed on him spirit
[1:09:14] Spirit made Adam a living Soul amazing
[1:09:18] isn't
[1:09:21] it so you could be laying there a body
[1:09:26] and not be
[1:09:29] alive like ezekiel's
[1:09:31] Boneyard uh this is quickly I got to
[1:09:33] hurry this is very very quick quick to
[1:09:35] find in the scripture if you want to
[1:09:37] look at it in Isaiah 43:7 put it up
[1:09:40] please it says even for everyone that is
[1:09:42] called by my name for I have created him
[1:09:46] for my glory I have formed him yay I
[1:09:50] have made him doesn't that all mean the
[1:09:52] same thing I have created him I have
[1:09:54] formed him I have have made
[1:09:56] him
[1:09:59] no do you think God thinks you're that
[1:10:02] dumb that he has to say the same thing
[1:10:05] three different ways he's not a
[1:10:08] pastor it's we pastors who think we got
[1:10:10] to back up and say it again got to back
[1:10:12] up and say it again we got to back up
[1:10:14] and say it again any good Jew will tell
[1:10:16] you that Hebrew was written in in a way
[1:10:20] that every uh vowel Mark every jot every
[1:10:26] turt says
[1:10:29] something when you read words repeated
[1:10:31] in the
[1:10:32] Bible it's not because it looks more
[1:10:35] poetic or it looks nicer on the line
[1:10:38] when we find a word repeated in the
[1:10:41] scripture it's repeated because there
[1:10:43] was a reason for it being repeated if
[1:10:46] Isaiah said God created you formed you
[1:10:48] and made
[1:10:50] you in one sentence he did it because he
[1:10:53] wanted you to know there was a
[1:10:54] difference
[1:10:55] from being created and formed and there
[1:10:58] was a difference from being formed and
[1:11:01] made and if you look at it you'll find
[1:11:03] it's three different Hebrew words and I
[1:11:06] wished I had time to unpack all of that
[1:11:08] for you but I don't except to say the
[1:11:11] word
[1:11:12] formed is a word yatsar which means to
[1:11:16] Fashion out of something that already
[1:11:20] exists
[1:11:27] when God made Adam we'll use the word
[1:11:29] made when God formed Adam he formed him
[1:11:32] out of something that already existed
[1:11:36] isn't that what the scripture said when
[1:11:38] God made the universe he formed it out
[1:11:40] of something that did not exist he
[1:11:41] stepped out on nothing spoke the word
[1:11:44] and something appeared powerful isn't it
[1:11:47] but when God made man he had already
[1:11:49] made the Earth he had already made
[1:11:51] creation he'd already made the dust and
[1:11:54] God for a reason reason why dust why not
[1:11:57] spit why didn't God make Adam from spit
[1:12:00] why didn't God make Adam from something
[1:12:01] else dust for a reason the word Adam
[1:12:04] means red
[1:12:05] Earth he made Adam's Body from the Red
[1:12:10] Dirt Adam Adam red Earth Red Dirt he he
[1:12:16] he did that out of something that
[1:12:18] already
[1:12:19] existed but Adam was not finished he was
[1:12:23] formed his body was formed out of
[1:12:26] something that already existed Genesis
[1:12:28] 3:19 says in the sweat of thy face shalt
[1:12:31] thou eat bread till thou return unto the
[1:12:33] ground for out of it was thou taken for
[1:12:35] dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou shalt
[1:12:38] return this
[1:12:40] body will return to the elements from
[1:12:44] when it has
[1:12:45] come it was dust in the beginning it'll
[1:12:49] be dust in the end this body cannot
[1:12:53] inherit the eternal life life of God
[1:12:56] forever and ever this body cannot exist
[1:13:00] in its natural form for all eternity it
[1:13:03] can't stand in the fullness of the glory
[1:13:07] of God so it has to give way it has to
[1:13:11] return back at some point either by
[1:13:13] death or Resurrection either by death or
[1:13:15] the time when when those who are alive
[1:13:17] are changed first Thessalonians 5:23 and
[1:13:21] the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy
[1:13:23] you say why does that matter that we got
[1:13:24] all that different stuff going on very
[1:13:26] God of Peace sanctify you holy and I
[1:13:28] pray God your whole Spirit soul and body
[1:13:31] be preserved blameless unto the coming
[1:13:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul wanted us
[1:13:36] to know that we are a
[1:13:38] Triune form formed being we are we are a
[1:13:44] trunity we are not three separate
[1:13:47] persons trying to function as
[1:13:49] one we are three dimensions co-operating
[1:13:54] coex existing in one
[1:13:59] identity we're one person I am one
[1:14:02] person you say yeah but you've got
[1:14:04] multiple
[1:14:08] personalities come on don't say some of
[1:14:11] you've never thought
[1:14:13] it but I'm one person I'm Body Soul and
[1:14:17] Spirit my body was
[1:14:19] formed but the word made in that place
[1:14:23] in in Isaiah 43:7 the word made is AA
[1:14:27] and it means a substance required of
[1:14:30] which the thing made
[1:14:34] consists meaning it cannot exist until
[1:14:37] something that was already
[1:14:40] made what has already been made is
[1:14:43] needed as an
[1:14:45] ingredient somebody said is't that isn't
[1:14:47] that the same meaning of the first
[1:14:49] no not in its
[1:14:52] base definition it's so so different
[1:14:55] that it merited a completely different
[1:14:58] word in
[1:14:59] Hebrew that is talking about the soul
[1:15:02] the soul was made the soul is simply
[1:15:04] that which gives life to a
[1:15:08] person how do we know that now there's
[1:15:10] many more Dimensions to the soul believe
[1:15:12] me I understand it's the mind the will
[1:15:13] and the emotions I understand the
[1:15:15] doorways in I understand uh what brother
[1:15:19] brandom taught us I understand that
[1:15:20] there's people who study the message who
[1:15:22] believe that the spirit is on the inside
[1:15:23] of the inside there are those who
[1:15:25] believe the soul is on the inside of the
[1:15:26] inside and right now just just please
[1:15:29] let's don't have that argument let's try
[1:15:30] to see the fact that we are we are three
[1:15:33] different dimensions functioning in one
[1:15:36] body god mentioned that each of those
[1:15:38] were were brought forth in a different
[1:15:41] way because there's something that he
[1:15:43] wants to reveal to us and he does this
[1:15:45] in scripture by telling us things like
[1:15:48] in the ark there were eight Souls
[1:15:53] saved what did does that mean does that
[1:15:56] mean they had a
[1:15:57] Revival and an altar
[1:16:00] call and eight Souls came to join the
[1:16:04] church no it means lives doesn't it
[1:16:08] eight lives were
[1:16:10] spared because with a soul you have
[1:16:21] life now there's another part of you
[1:16:25] that comes from the word that that means
[1:16:28] to create and to create is to bring
[1:16:31] something out of nothing or to bring
[1:16:34] into existence something which never
[1:16:37] existed
[1:16:38] before now this is important to know
[1:16:41] because in Genesis 1:3 it says God said
[1:16:44] what let there be light in all the other
[1:16:49] verses in Genesis 1 it said and God
[1:16:51] created and God created and God created
[1:16:54] and God created and God created but in
[1:16:56] verse three it didn't say he created
[1:16:58] anything it said he called it
[1:17:01] forth that didn't it let there be well I
[1:17:05] think let there be in create means the
[1:17:07] same thing it doesn't sorry I'm sorry it
[1:17:09] doesn't because light existed before the
[1:17:13] Sun and light existed before the moon
[1:17:17] these great luminaries these great
[1:17:19] reflections of light were were created
[1:17:22] by God to to bring forth light but light
[1:17:26] was already there in the beginning light
[1:17:29] was already there but light was
[1:17:31] comingled with Darkness that's right and
[1:17:35] that is a mixture and the Bible tells us
[1:17:37] that through the writings of the
[1:17:38] prophets that's why great mysteries of
[1:17:41] light are often concealed and hidden in
[1:17:44] darkness treasures and secrets are often
[1:17:48] hidden in darkness and it takes a man
[1:17:51] who can turn on the
[1:17:53] lights it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:17:56] Revelation to pull the light out of the
[1:17:58] darkness to separate the light from the
[1:18:01] darkness when God said let there be
[1:18:03] light he was not creating light he was
[1:18:05] separating light from Darkness that's
[1:18:07] right
[1:18:09] powerful so light was not
[1:18:12] created light sprung forth from the
[1:18:14] Fountain of the
[1:18:16] logos light was part of the very essence
[1:18:19] of who God
[1:18:22] is Adam and Eve were not
[1:18:26] naked not
[1:18:29] originally they didn't have own clothes
[1:18:32] they had on his
[1:18:37] light they were dressed in his light
[1:18:42] think about that wow when Jesus was
[1:18:45] transfigured on the mount he showed what
[1:18:49] it looks like hello when Moses came down
[1:18:53] off of the mountain he showed in measure
[1:18:57] what it looks like to come into
[1:18:59] fellowship with that great
[1:19:01] light your countenance has
[1:19:04] changed there is a glory there is a type
[1:19:08] there is a there is a measure of that
[1:19:11] light that you can have that
[1:19:14] Fades how many of you have ever tasted a
[1:19:16] measure of
[1:19:17] Glory it
[1:19:20] fades I talk about the time that I
[1:19:22] encountered the Divine compassion of the
[1:19:24] Lord
[1:19:25] and I ashamedly I'm hurrying now 12:20
[1:19:29] see we started at 10:30 11:30 oh I have
[1:19:32] a few more minutes by anybody's
[1:19:34] clock and if I don't by your clock throw
[1:19:37] it
[1:19:40] out there's so much that God wants to
[1:19:44] say to us listen this book of Genesis
[1:19:48] is what good does it do you to focus on
[1:19:51] the Book of Revelation if you can't
[1:19:52] understand the book of beginnings
[1:19:55] that's a thing I appreciate about what
[1:19:57] we call the message of the hour is when
[1:19:59] God started revealing that word he
[1:20:01] didn't just go to the end of things to
[1:20:02] tell us how it's going to be in the end
[1:20:04] he said you're not going to understand
[1:20:06] the end if you don't really see the
[1:20:07] beginning I'm going to take you all the
[1:20:09] way back to the beginning and that's why
[1:20:11] when the church cries out back to
[1:20:12] Pentecost back to Pentecost I say
[1:20:14] hallelujah praise the Lord but that
[1:20:16] ain't enough that's right God did not
[1:20:19] come in this hour to prepare Sons to
[1:20:21] prepare a bride just to take us back to
[1:20:24] Pentecost
[1:20:25] he has come to take us all the way back
[1:20:28] to where it all
[1:20:31] began in the book of Beginnings in baret
[1:20:35] the book of
[1:20:38] origins The Book of Genesis where it all
[1:20:41] started why because Authority is not
[1:20:45] revealed in the Book of Revelation
[1:20:46] Authority is revealed in the book of
[1:20:48] Beginnings
[1:20:50] amen Adam let me tell you something
[1:20:52] about Adam Adam did not live his live
[1:20:55] Natural Life as we understand it Adam
[1:20:58] and Eve were clothed in the light of God
[1:21:00] and natural life was not their source
[1:21:03] and they would have lived
[1:21:05] forever
[1:21:07] right in that
[1:21:10] condition because they weren't
[1:21:11] functioning off of the natural life that
[1:21:13] we know Adam was made he was formed and
[1:21:17] he was created in the very image of God
[1:21:21] that means Body Soul and Spirit it Adam
[1:21:26] was the perfect Son of God right
[1:21:32] perfect oh my well that makes me nervous
[1:21:36] when you say something like that because
[1:21:37] we know what happened in the garden I
[1:21:39] hope you do I hope you know what the New
[1:21:41] Testament says the New Testament says
[1:21:43] Adam was not
[1:21:46] deceived he did exactly what he knew
[1:21:48] that he was supposed to do because he
[1:21:51] was a model he was a forerunner
[1:21:56] did he pay the price absolutely was he
[1:21:59] marred absolutely did he lose his robe
[1:22:02] of light absolutely how would you like
[1:22:05] to trade in an Armani
[1:22:09] suit for a Goodwill
[1:22:13] suit there nothing wrong with wearing a
[1:22:15] Goodwill suit but you're not going to go
[1:22:18] to Goodwill and say hey I've got an
[1:22:19] Armani suit that fits and I'm going to
[1:22:21] trade it in because I really want this
[1:22:22] Goodwill suit that fits do you
[1:22:23] understand what I'm saying that's what
[1:22:25] Adam had to do he had to trade in the
[1:22:27] best clothes the light of God for bloody
[1:22:32] skins right any way you look at it it
[1:22:34] was a covering but it was a
[1:22:36] downgrade not an upgrade right let me
[1:22:39] tell you what fell in the
[1:22:42] garden not just did their clothes
[1:22:45] change their Spirits
[1:22:50] fell their Spirits
[1:22:52] fell they begin to operate in a fallen
[1:22:57] spirit so the church would say Fallen
[1:23:00] soul I think that would be all right
[1:23:03] except that it does not quite capture
[1:23:04] what happens when you quit Living spirit
[1:23:07] life and start living Soul life or flesh
[1:23:10] life it's more than just changing
[1:23:13] coats it's changing the nature of
[1:23:15] everything you are what happened to Adam
[1:23:17] and Eve in the garden it changed
[1:23:19] everything about who they
[1:23:21] were it's big it's huge
[1:23:25] that's why it's absolutely ridiculous
[1:23:26] when it's reduced to a to a picture in a
[1:23:28] comic book of a of a of a snake curled
[1:23:31] around a tree and an apple with a
[1:23:38] bite with a bite took out of it when
[1:23:41] it's reduced to something like that it
[1:23:43] certainly does not reflect what really
[1:23:46] happened when when man's Spirit Falls
[1:23:50] and he walked out of the garden living
[1:23:51] an entirely different life than the one
[1:23:54] he lived lived inside the garden inside
[1:23:56] the garden he existed by the life of God
[1:24:00] that's
[1:24:01] right outside the garden he existed with
[1:24:05] natural life which is from the soul
[1:24:09] which means when he died his soul left
[1:24:15] him which is why the scripture tells us
[1:24:18] the soul that
[1:24:21] sinth shall surely die
[1:24:25] because there's a part of you that
[1:24:27] cannot live
[1:24:29] forever separated from the zoy eternal
[1:24:33] life of God that's
[1:24:37] right let's think about it a
[1:24:39] minute more than just a garment change
[1:24:41] do I have another 10 minutes or so thank
[1:24:44] you thank you thank you I I I'll try to
[1:24:46] behave tonight I'll just come in Praise
[1:24:48] the Lord amen it's wonderful sing it
[1:24:50] just one more time okay Paul it's your
[1:24:52] turn Maybe
[1:24:55] the literal meaning of that word create
[1:24:57] because it's three different things
[1:24:58] means to bring something out of nothing
[1:25:00] and so we know that man was was formed
[1:25:02] he was made and he was created because
[1:25:04] he is body he is soul and he is spirit
[1:25:06] and this is a huge thing that happened
[1:25:08] and light was called forth out of
[1:25:09] darkness and the mixture could no longer
[1:25:11] exist and I want you to know the biggest
[1:25:13] need in the body of Christ in this hour
[1:25:15] is for the mixture to be done away with
[1:25:18] and the only thing that can do away with
[1:25:20] mixture is the calling forth of the
[1:25:22] light
[1:25:25] the main reason why we need the zadok
[1:25:28] priesthood to arise in this hour is we
[1:25:31] need the ability to judge and discern
[1:25:34] between Tove and
[1:25:36] raah we're living in an hour where men
[1:25:39] will take darkness and re-identify it
[1:25:41] and redefine it as light right I'm
[1:25:46] almost done I'm not going to say that
[1:25:48] again
[1:25:51] though we're living in such a messed up
[1:25:53] mix step confused
[1:25:56] society that a a hero an Olympic
[1:26:03] champion butchers his body Alters his
[1:26:08] chemicals puts on
[1:26:12] paint and
[1:26:15] wig walks up the
[1:26:18] stage
[1:26:21] twisting with some man how awkward is
[1:26:24] that to take take
[1:26:29] him and he walks up and the world
[1:26:33] bows and
[1:26:35] redefines this sickness and insanity and
[1:26:39] sin you don't have to say a word I
[1:26:42] didn't need anyen there sickness sin the
[1:26:46] perverting of Truth the twisting of
[1:26:50] life and the world celebrates it and
[1:26:53] calls it what
[1:26:56] Courage The Man of the Year Bruce I I
[1:27:00] can't say Caitlyn can you Bruce Caitlyn
[1:27:03] Jenner see I came from a generation
[1:27:06] where we you know a hero I'm that old
[1:27:10] Mark Spitz you know who Mark Spitz was
[1:27:13] great Olympic
[1:27:14] swimmer people today don't even know who
[1:27:16] he is it's what's his name what's the
[1:27:19] swimmer Phelps what a what a what a
[1:27:23] creature
[1:27:25] this young man has done amazing things
[1:27:27] in swimming but we didn't know who he
[1:27:29] was when I was a child it was Mark Spitz
[1:27:31] Bruce Jenner what's the skater guy h
[1:27:33] mark haml or
[1:27:35] whatever all these things and now here
[1:27:39] is some man lived his life in Twisted
[1:27:42] perversion run by a jezebel
[1:27:47] wife and a house full of Jezebel
[1:27:50] daughters because Jezebel is not the
[1:27:53] description of what they look like
[1:27:54] Jezebel's the description of the way
[1:27:56] they ruled the roost that's right that
[1:27:59] same spirit will rule the
[1:28:00] church I didn't say that John said it I
[1:28:05] got a problem with this church world
[1:28:07] I've got a problem Jesus said give this
[1:28:10] message let them know I've got a problem
[1:28:12] because you've taken that Spirit of
[1:28:14] Jezebel and you've exalted her as a
[1:28:17] propheus and you have allowed her to
[1:28:20] call the shots that's right that's right
[1:28:23] you have swallowed a
[1:28:28] lie and God said I'm not going to look
[1:28:31] at it that way I'm not going to I'm not
[1:28:33] going to let that go on I'm going to do
[1:28:34] something about that we cry out go God
[1:28:37] send the spirit and power of Elijah you
[1:28:39] don't want the spirit and power of
[1:28:42] Elijah to show up in the church world
[1:28:45] today until we make some
[1:28:49] preparation because you get the spirit
[1:28:51] and power of Elijah I know EX exactly
[1:28:54] what it sounds like it sounds like a
[1:28:56] John the Baptist that'll stomp right up
[1:28:59] to Herod and say it is not lawful for
[1:29:04] you to have your brother Phillip's
[1:29:10] wife you let the spirit and power of
[1:29:13] Elijah manifest in the church and
[1:29:15] they'll call fornication fornication and
[1:29:18] adultery adultery and homosexuality
[1:29:21] they'll call it sin
[1:29:24] they won't call it alternative
[1:29:26] living
[1:29:28] no alternative living is whether you
[1:29:31] decide to live in the mountains or at
[1:29:32] the
[1:29:37] beach not it's not describing your
[1:29:39] plumbing it's describing where you want
[1:29:41] to live Amen brother you sure you want
[1:29:45] the spirit and power of Elijah I tell
[1:29:47] you what a lot of those controlling
[1:29:49] spirits that fall on intercessors
[1:29:51] sometime to try to control the prophets
[1:29:56] do you know why the prophetic movement
[1:29:57] is in such a terrible shape in this
[1:29:59] nation and why they're prophesying
[1:30:01] against one another because they've been
[1:30:03] castrated by the spirit of
[1:30:07] Jezebel no I wouldn't preach it it's a
[1:30:10] white dove SOS no I wouldn't preach this
[1:30:12] out on the on the conference unless God
[1:30:14] told me to but the last time I looked
[1:30:16] around this morning I'm in the house
[1:30:18] that God gave me a voice in
[1:30:25] the prophets of today many of them have
[1:30:27] been castrated by the spirit of Jezebel
[1:30:30] on intercessors who have no
[1:30:33] understanding of the words that come out
[1:30:35] of their mouth and they control the
[1:30:37] message from the
[1:30:40] Pew God give us more intercessors who
[1:30:45] understand who they are and recognize
[1:30:49] their job is more powerful more potent
[1:30:53] more hard than controlling the pull pit
[1:30:56] that's
[1:31:00] right wow where did that come
[1:31:05] from we need we need prophetic voices in
[1:31:09] this hour that will raise up and give us
[1:31:12] thus sayeth the Lord and it'll actually
[1:31:18] happen Paul Kei the one who said I've
[1:31:20] got thus sayith the Lord for you you
[1:31:21] need thus sayith the lord well is it
[1:31:24] going to come from out of the mixture
[1:31:26] never never where's it going to come
[1:31:29] from those who have not yet had the veil
[1:31:32] removed by the living sword of the Lord
[1:31:34] to be able to even know who God
[1:31:36] is you're going to speak for a God you
[1:31:39] don't even
[1:31:41] know Bobby Connor says there they he
[1:31:44] said I tell you the problem today he
[1:31:46] said we speak way too much about a God
[1:31:49] we barely know that's
[1:31:51] right oh God we want to know you
[1:31:54] when you put your life in a bush we want
[1:31:56] to find out not what the bush is about
[1:31:58] we want to find out what the fire is
[1:32:00] about we want to stand like Moses and
[1:32:03] see the contrast of what we are here I
[1:32:06] stand living and functioning in my own
[1:32:08] string there is a bush that if it were
[1:32:10] living off of its own string would fall
[1:32:12] into ashes but it's not even consumed
[1:32:15] because for this moment in time that
[1:32:17] bush is drawing its strength from the
[1:32:19] life of the
[1:32:21] fire and not from the Life in The Roots
[1:32:23] do you understand
[1:32:24] we're the
[1:32:26] branches he's the vine
[1:32:29] amen when Paul Keith says things are
[1:32:31] these other men we can we can strike
[1:32:33] that if he's not comfortable with me
[1:32:34] calling his name but here's the here's
[1:32:37] the truth when we when we say we are the
[1:32:40] branches and he's the vine and when we
[1:32:42] hear things like we heard last night
[1:32:43] that there are new Revelations and new
[1:32:45] Mysteries and and and and he brought
[1:32:47] that back right back to the word not
[1:32:49] things that can't be lined up with the
[1:32:51] word but things we've never seen in the
[1:32:55] fullness not enough eyesa to really see
[1:32:58] like the blood like the blood for
[1:33:00] instance like how we died in Christ like
[1:33:02] how we were raised in Christ things that
[1:33:05] should have been Christianity 101 but
[1:33:06] we've missed them and God wants to shed
[1:33:08] some new light on the truth it's he said
[1:33:11] new light on Old truth and and when God
[1:33:13] wants to do that we we can't have a
[1:33:15] problem with that we cannot have a
[1:33:17] problem with that we can have a problem
[1:33:19] with seeing Miracles and healings again
[1:33:21] many people believe there'll be nothing
[1:33:23] like that nothing like that no move of
[1:33:25] God no stirring no Harvest no Revival at
[1:33:27] all that is totally impossible for you
[1:33:30] to get a bunch of
[1:33:32] branches who cease to live on their own
[1:33:35] life and start drawing life from their
[1:33:38] root see it's a different analogy it's a
[1:33:41] different analogy we're the branches now
[1:33:45] and we're drawing our life from the
[1:33:47] literal life of Jesus Christ that Bush
[1:33:50] was drawing its life from the root the
[1:33:52] Natural Life till the Firefish
[1:33:54] you and I have been living off of Soul
[1:33:56] life carnal life natural life until the
[1:33:59] fire falls until we understand what the
[1:34:02] sword has come to do not to kill us but
[1:34:05] to kill
[1:34:09] us I'm going quote Bobby Connor again
[1:34:11] there are two great forces in this world
[1:34:12] who want you dead God and
[1:34:16] Devil two want to kill you God wants to
[1:34:18] kill you the devil wants to kill you
[1:34:19] it's a matter of who's going to win who
[1:34:21] kills you first
[1:34:23] let me tell you something there's a part
[1:34:25] of us that has to die and that's our
[1:34:27] dependency on our own strength there's a
[1:34:30] part of us that has to live we've got to
[1:34:31] start drawing our strength 1:00 got to
[1:34:33] go from the very powerful precious holy
[1:34:36] life of Jesus Christ did I leave a lot
[1:34:38] hanging there I probably did but we
[1:34:40] can't go back to that now for that
[1:34:42] moment that Bush was not living on the
[1:34:44] life that came from within its roots no
[1:34:46] it was living and being strengthened
[1:34:48] from the life of God that was now living
[1:34:51] upon it in the fire this is what you
[1:34:53] looks like Revelation 1 quickly quickly
[1:34:57] please please let's move quick I I I'm I
[1:35:00] I'm I'll hush in a moment one I'll read
[1:35:02] fast I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:35:04] Day 110 and I heard behind me a great
[1:35:07] voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha
[1:35:08] and Omega the first and the last what
[1:35:10] thou see us right in a book sended under
[1:35:12] seven churches which are in Asia under
[1:35:13] Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis
[1:35:16] Philadelphia and leoda and I turned to
[1:35:18] see the voice that spake with me and
[1:35:20] being turned I saw seven golden
[1:35:22] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:35:23] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[1:35:25] of man oh praise the lord it's Jesus
[1:35:27] that I see the son of man revealed in
[1:35:28] you and
[1:35:29] me it's one like unto the son of man
[1:35:32] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[1:35:33] and gir about the paps with a golden
[1:35:35] girdle notice a lot there's a lot to
[1:35:36] notice here we can't notice at all
[1:35:38] notice this John was in the spirit on
[1:35:40] the Lord's day he was moved forward to
[1:35:43] our day snatched from patmas to see the
[1:35:47] end time Army the end time plan of God
[1:35:50] revealed and he wrote forward and
[1:35:53] backward
[1:35:54] what a what an amazing Revelation he
[1:35:56] received it was the apocalypsis it was
[1:35:58] the unveiling of Jesus Christ it's not
[1:36:01] the revelation of St John the Divine
[1:36:03] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:36:04] given to St John or John or whoever
[1:36:07] johanan John had to turn around and see
[1:36:11] he had to turn aside and see and he
[1:36:13] didn't want to see just see he said he
[1:36:15] wanted to see the
[1:36:17] voice Moses saw the sign but he had to
[1:36:20] turn aside to get a better look to get a
[1:36:22] closer a a a point a vantage point to
[1:36:25] examine
[1:36:27] it it's time for a turn it's time to
[1:36:30] make a turn brother random said if we
[1:36:32] just keep laying the bricks in a
[1:36:35] straight
[1:36:35] row when God turns the
[1:36:39] corner we're going to miss his
[1:36:42] appointment we're going to miss his
[1:36:44] Junction with us in time you hear what
[1:36:46] I'm saying and he said the problem is it
[1:36:49] takes a different
[1:36:51] skill it takes a different level of
[1:36:53] skill to be able to lay bricks in a
[1:36:55] straight L row got it understand and to
[1:36:57] turn the
[1:36:59] corner you got to know a little bit
[1:37:01] about cutting the brick and shaping the
[1:37:03] brick and making sure you don't destroy
[1:37:04] the brick because a corner has to be
[1:37:06] turned I'm telling you what a corner is
[1:37:09] turning it is turning it is turning I
[1:37:11] believe it'll be wrong I believe it'll
[1:37:13] be prophetically wrong for us to decree
[1:37:15] and declare that a turn is coming I
[1:37:17] believe it's wrong to decree that A
[1:37:19] change is coming I believe it's
[1:37:21] absolutely inappropriate to say What
[1:37:23] will will be I think it is more
[1:37:25] appropriate and more vital for us in the
[1:37:27] spirit as
[1:37:29] forerunners as prophetic people to now
[1:37:33] decree that it is turning the turning is
[1:37:35] now there is a turning we are not seeing
[1:37:38] the fullness but we're seeing things
[1:37:41] begin to
[1:37:43] turn change is not coming change is upon
[1:37:48] us bigger change the unfold oh oh oh oh
[1:37:55] the unfolding of change is coming more
[1:37:59] more understanding of change more
[1:38:01] dramatic change is coming but the change
[1:38:04] has started the time of the Lord is not
[1:38:06] next
[1:38:07] year the day of the Lord is not the end
[1:38:10] of another
[1:38:12] cycle don't you get
[1:38:16] weary of
[1:38:19] emails I get so weary of emails telling
[1:38:23] me all the time I can't keep up with
[1:38:30] it it's so overwhelming that when the
[1:38:33] Lord speaks like he did last night about
[1:38:36] a seven-year cycle we shut it
[1:38:39] off because we have heard so many emails
[1:38:44] read so many messages so many prophecies
[1:38:46] so many emails in three days things are
[1:38:48] turning in seven days there's going to
[1:38:49] be this change in in in 11 years we're
[1:38:51] going to see this in 15 years and in in
[1:38:54] in 18 moments hours seconds we're going
[1:38:56] to and we get so overwhelmed with the
[1:39:00] amount of of announcements of seasons
[1:39:03] and cycles that if we're not careful our
[1:39:05] heads will spin we'll fall victim to the
[1:39:07] confusion of the Babylonian Spirit and
[1:39:10] the next thing you know we will miss the
[1:39:11] times and seasons of the Lord and if we
[1:39:14] miss the issachar anointing to discern
[1:39:16] the times and seasons of the lord we
[1:39:18] will never operate in the zadok
[1:39:20] priesthood to be able to judge between
[1:39:22] row uh
[1:39:23] top
[1:39:26] to and raw good and evil never be able
[1:39:30] to without the issachar anointing the
[1:39:32] priesthood of zadok can never operate in
[1:39:34] the last time bride we got to have the
[1:39:36] ability to truly discern the times and
[1:39:38] the seasons and we need to know that
[1:39:40] we're hearing from voices who have been
[1:39:43] there and done
[1:39:46] that where are they that you're going to
[1:39:48] have to find that but we're going to
[1:39:50] have to be able to find and identify and
[1:39:52] recognize don't throw the baby out with
[1:39:54] the bath water just because you get 300
[1:39:56] emails a month telling you that you're
[1:39:58] in this season that cycle this is about
[1:40:00] to change and that's going to change and
[1:40:01] this is going to change and I've been in
[1:40:03] the courtroom of heaven and I saw this
[1:40:05] and I'm going to go pull money up out of
[1:40:06] the bottom of the ocean and I'm going
[1:40:08] all this and I i' i' I've I've already
[1:40:10] killed the mermaid on your
[1:40:14] behalf and don't worry cuz I slayed the
[1:40:17] wear wolf last night and everything's
[1:40:18] going to be all right and tomorrow the
[1:40:20] Dollar's going to
[1:40:21] soore do not be conf
[1:40:23] confused by the confusion of
[1:40:26] Babylon the church may never have the
[1:40:29] grace to escape Babylon but there must
[1:40:32] be a bride there must be Sons there must
[1:40:36] be a holy Remnant that will hear the
[1:40:38] word of the Lord and come out of her and
[1:40:42] be separate sayeth the
[1:40:47] Lord and don't just change your
[1:40:50] location don't partake
[1:40:53] with her sin that's
[1:40:57] right what what Paul Keith told us the
[1:41:00] first night he was here that the pope
[1:41:01] said I I haven't I haven't I haven't got
[1:41:04] over it yet my head's still
[1:41:07] spinning for for for the largest
[1:41:10] religious organization on the on the
[1:41:11] face of the world and the Very man that
[1:41:14] believes and and and his millions of
[1:41:16] followers believe that he is Jesus
[1:41:18] Christ on the earth well the Catholic
[1:41:20] Church doesn't believe that they do they
[1:41:22] do believe that it's the inscription
[1:41:25] over his head in the stead of God they
[1:41:29] believe his words are infallible and he
[1:41:31] has no accountability to keep his words
[1:41:34] in line with the Scripture it sounds
[1:41:36] like the prophets of
[1:41:40] today very little accountability to keep
[1:41:44] their message in line with the word
[1:41:46] aren't you glad when God sends somebody
[1:41:48] into your life like these two men who
[1:41:53] are are making sure with the utmost of
[1:41:55] Integrity that their message is lining
[1:41:58] up with the word of God that there is a
[1:42:01] doveet tail there it may not draw the
[1:42:04] biggest crowd it may not make us all
[1:42:06] Swoon like women in a Beatles
[1:42:11] concert but it changes us it empowers us
[1:42:15] it strengthens us because the remnant
[1:42:17] bride receives strength when she is
[1:42:20] hooked up to the life IV
[1:42:24] when Zoe life is running through the IV
[1:42:27] brother we get life from a higher
[1:42:30] source in closing in closing musicians
[1:42:33] come
[1:42:38] slowly verse 16 Revelation 1 he had in
[1:42:40] his right hand Seven Stars out of his
[1:42:42] mouth one a sharp two-edged sword his
[1:42:43] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[1:42:45] his strength and when I saw him I fell
[1:42:47] at his feet as dead good move
[1:42:50] John and he laid right his right hand
[1:42:54] upon me saying unto me fear not I am the
[1:42:56] first and the last what was in the mouth
[1:42:58] of Jesus Christ what was in his
[1:43:01] mouth a
[1:43:05] sharp two-edged
[1:43:09] sword double-edged
[1:43:12] doesn't matter which way you swing it
[1:43:16] there's a sharp
[1:43:17] edge to meet the
[1:43:21] veil what was John's Veil
[1:43:23] fear what was moses' Veil what was the
[1:43:26] veil that needed to be removed from
[1:43:27] Moses that day on the mountain trusting
[1:43:28] in his own strength God showed up spoke
[1:43:31] out of that bush with a
[1:43:34] sword the veil fell off of his face
[1:43:37] spiritually and he said I can't survive
[1:43:39] without the strength of God I'm undone
[1:43:41] John saw Jesus in the fullness of his
[1:43:44] power standing in front of a
[1:43:48] bush John a bush absolutely he was
[1:43:51] standing in front of a seven branch
[1:43:53] Candlestick that we call the manora
[1:43:56] that's fashioned after the tree of
[1:44:01] life so what John saw was a
[1:44:05] bush not a bush but a
[1:44:08] bush a manora a holy manora that was
[1:44:11] fashioned after a tree seven
[1:44:15] branches how long PO he it been since
[1:44:17] you taught on the on the seven have you
[1:44:19] taught it in the last
[1:44:21] years you should go back and hear the
[1:44:24] teaching uh I almost called the name of
[1:44:26] the series you should go back and hear
[1:44:28] the teaching that he did on the seven
[1:44:30] spirits of God putting them on the
[1:44:31] manora putting them there it's powerful
[1:44:34] what John was seeing was was a similar
[1:44:36] scene to what what Moses saw he was
[1:44:39] seeing Jesus standing in the midst of a
[1:44:41] fiery Candlestick that represented a
[1:44:44] fiery Bush a fiery tree the tree of life
[1:44:47] that receives its strength from the life
[1:44:49] of
[1:44:50] God representing churches that were star
[1:44:53] Ed and founded drawing their strength
[1:44:55] from the life of God oh you foolish
[1:44:57] Galatians who has Bewitched you you used
[1:45:00] to draw your strength from the living
[1:45:02] source of life and now you draw your
[1:45:04] strength from other sources you think
[1:45:07] that you can finish in the flesh what
[1:45:08] was started in the
[1:45:11] spirit you fall into Jezebel's
[1:45:14] witchcraft you've been Bewitched by a
[1:45:17] controlling spirit that desires to keep
[1:45:19] you away from the
[1:45:21] IV to keep you away from the oh I guess
[1:45:23] you put an IV there or somewhere the IV
[1:45:27] of
[1:45:28] Life The Sword he came with a two-edged
[1:45:30] sword why because John had a veil that
[1:45:32] needed to be cut off Boy The Sword knows
[1:45:34] how to deal with a veil by the way it's
[1:45:36] the same sword in the Book of Genesis
[1:45:38] that turned itself in every direction
[1:45:40] that means it wasn't a metal sword it
[1:45:42] was a living sword it might have looked
[1:45:43] like a sword fashioned out of metal but
[1:45:46] the sword was alive there was life in it
[1:45:48] how do you know because it moved in all
[1:45:50] four directions it was a living sword it
[1:45:52] represent ented not a Written Letter it
[1:45:54] represented a Living Word it didn't just
[1:45:56] represent the Bible as a book it
[1:45:58] represented the Bible as a record of the
[1:46:01] Living Word of God turning moving why
[1:46:03] was it there to guard the way to keep
[1:46:06] the way to keep anyone from receiving
[1:46:09] eternal life in an illegitimate manner
[1:46:12] until the fullness of redemption had
[1:46:13] been purchased on the cross of Calvary
[1:46:16] because Adam had once known what it was
[1:46:18] like to live in the life of God now he
[1:46:21] was living Fallen Natural Life and God
[1:46:23] knew he wasn't going to forget what it
[1:46:25] was like to go to Eden to live in Eden
[1:46:27] to live in the garden of God there's a
[1:46:29] people that are being prepared in this
[1:46:32] hour to live back to the
[1:46:35] beginning back to
[1:46:39] that
[1:46:41] Pentecost you think I want to just go
[1:46:43] back and talk in tongues and prophesy no
[1:46:46] that's good I want all that you think I
[1:46:48] just want to go back to that no if that
[1:46:52] same
[1:46:53] life if that same spirit that rais Jesus
[1:46:56] from the dead dwell in you it will
[1:46:58] produce the same life in you It produced
[1:47:00] in him the life of Jesus Christ and when
[1:47:04] that bride Rises
[1:47:07] up when the Bride of Jesus Christ Rises
[1:47:09] up no longer drawing life from her own
[1:47:12] source from her own Natural Life Soul
[1:47:15] life but when she begins to draw her
[1:47:17] strength from the life of the spirit
[1:47:19] which is his life infused in US
[1:47:24] Hallelujah there'll be no
[1:47:26] compromise there'll be no mixture there
[1:47:29] will be no dueling
[1:47:31] profits there will be no day old
[1:47:33] prophets who prophesy after it's already
[1:47:35] fulfilled then they tell us what the
[1:47:36] Lord showed them but there will be sons
[1:47:39] of issachar with the anointing of times
[1:47:41] and Seasons there'll be a priesthood of
[1:47:43] zadok that will rise up judging the toen
[1:47:45] raah there will be the sons manifested
[1:47:48] with authority and the power of the
[1:47:49] creative spoken
[1:47:51] word there will be a people people
[1:47:53] released from the prison of their own
[1:47:54] making thinking that they can do
[1:47:56] anything good enough to be right with
[1:47:58] God that's the prison that people need
[1:48:01] to get out of it's the P the prison of
[1:48:03] religious
[1:48:05] works why don't you aim in
[1:48:08] that it's a prison of thinking that your
[1:48:11] Works will make you holy your Works will
[1:48:14] make you righteous it's a lie it's a
[1:48:16] dirty
[1:48:20] LIE there's only one thing that will
[1:48:22] make you
[1:48:23] righteous you've got to be like the
[1:48:30] bush what did the bush do
[1:48:34] nothing he just
[1:48:40] yielded I don't know if I like the sound
[1:48:42] of that of course not because it's hard
[1:48:45] for us to get to the place that once
[1:48:46] we've been saved by the blood of Jesus
[1:48:48] Sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:48:49] of the word filled and baptized with the
[1:48:51] walking talking Holy Ghost now we think
[1:48:53] we got to keep on working keep on moving
[1:48:54] keep on finding things that will make us
[1:48:57] Holier and righteous and so forth and
[1:48:58] kind of like what brother Caleb was
[1:49:00] talking to us about yesterday and I
[1:49:01] believe in Holiness and I believe in
[1:49:03] righteousness and when you see my wife
[1:49:04] you know that we are not interested in
[1:49:07] the fads and Fashions of this world I
[1:49:10] have no desire when people come here and
[1:49:13] they see the way these folk look and
[1:49:14] dress and act their first response is
[1:49:16] there must be legalism in this house if
[1:49:18] you think what I'm preaching this
[1:49:20] morning morning is legalism you don't
[1:49:22] know the definition of
[1:49:23] legalism what I'm preaching this morning
[1:49:26] is that your religious Works will bind
[1:49:28] you that will bind you but there is
[1:49:31] freedom and there is Liberty in the
[1:49:33] sound of the chofar not only is the
[1:49:35] devil scattered but every
[1:49:41] slave when he hears the sounding of that
[1:49:43] trumpet he no longer has to
[1:49:46] hoe in Pharaoh's
[1:49:50] Garden I have HED my last row of corn
[1:49:53] for
[1:49:54] Pharaoh I have holded my last row of
[1:49:57] corn for denominational
[1:50:00] hierarchy and Bishops and Lords over
[1:50:03] God's flock no more will I hoe another
[1:50:06] row of corn to please man I have heard
[1:50:10] the sound of the Jubilee the Lord
[1:50:13] himself has descended from heaven with a
[1:50:15] shout and with the voice of the
[1:50:18] Archangel and the last Trumpet Of God
[1:50:21] and he is on his
[1:50:24] way he's on his
[1:50:28] way why would I want to spend the next
[1:50:31] seven years of my life or next 12 months
[1:50:34] of my life hoing corn to build the
[1:50:41] church when Jesus is on his
[1:50:46] way in fact he's
[1:50:50] here building his bride
[1:50:54] delivering her from the idea that you
[1:50:55] can do it on your own power what was the
[1:50:57] veil that was cut off of John
[1:51:00] closing what was the veil that was cut
[1:51:02] off of John's face it's easy very very
[1:51:03] easy
[1:51:06] fear fear John was veiled with fear he
[1:51:10] couldn't see the end time because of
[1:51:12] fear the word of the Lord is not to
[1:51:15] bring carnal solish
[1:51:20] fear that's tied to condemnation
[1:51:24] the word of God brings
[1:51:26] conviction the spirit life brings help
[1:51:29] and
[1:51:31] hope religion brings condemnation say
[1:51:36] Amen this is not the reverential fear of
[1:51:38] the Lord that took John on his
[1:51:42] face how do you know that how do you
[1:51:44] know that he didn't fall before this
[1:51:46] Jesus in the C in reverential fear
[1:51:48] because Jesus would not have rebuked his
[1:51:51] fear if it was Godly fear that's
[1:51:55] right the Bible tells us that the fear
[1:51:58] of the Lord is a beginning of wisdom you
[1:51:59] think God Jesus was going to to correct
[1:52:02] instruct John if he was laying there in
[1:52:05] Godly fear and in
[1:52:07] wisdom no the veil of fear was going to
[1:52:11] keep John from going any
[1:52:13] farther it's it's nice it's nice that he
[1:52:15] recognized I'm in the presence of
[1:52:17] something bigger than I am the problem
[1:52:19] is if he fell in reverential fear and
[1:52:21] got up in solish fear fear he wouldn't
[1:52:23] have been able to go for forward in the
[1:52:24] Revelation that Jesus had for him so the
[1:52:26] veil had to come and and God made sure
[1:52:29] it did cuz in Jesus was a was a sword in
[1:52:31] his mouth he didn't just see him
[1:52:32] standing in the Candlestick of fire he
[1:52:34] saw a sword in his mouth why do you
[1:52:35] think Jesus showed up with a sword in
[1:52:37] his mouth to cut the veil
[1:52:39] away cuz the sword that once guarded the
[1:52:43] way protected the way to eternal life
[1:52:46] has now showed up in this
[1:52:49] hour The Living Word of God is here
[1:52:53] it's on the earth it's in the bride The
[1:52:55] Living Word of God is Among Us it's the
[1:52:57] same sword the sword of the Lord and it
[1:53:00] is not here to to guard the way so that
[1:53:02] we don't get in the Living Word of the
[1:53:05] Lord the sword of the Lord is now in the
[1:53:07] body of Christ if we yield to it it's
[1:53:09] it's in us or do we see the full man no
[1:53:12] but but are we waiting on it
[1:53:14] no are we going to prophesy that it's
[1:53:17] coming next year the next the next the
[1:53:18] next the next the next no we're going to
[1:53:21] are we going to be thermometers and tell
[1:53:22] people how dark and evil and ugly it is
[1:53:25] no we're going to be thermostats we're
[1:53:27] going to reach in by the word of God
[1:53:29] we're going to see what God Said is
[1:53:30] coming and we're going to prophesy it as
[1:53:32] though it were
[1:53:33] here because that's what prophets do
[1:53:36] they don't just foretell what's coming
[1:53:39] they get a hold of what's coming and
[1:53:41] they decree it and announce it and and
[1:53:44] release
[1:53:45] it on the earth
[1:53:48] am how do people access it if it hasn't
[1:53:50] been fully manifested the same way you
[1:53:52] access everything you've ever gotten
[1:53:53] from God by what
[1:53:57] faith you hear the word you hear these
[1:53:59] men say what God wants to do your faith
[1:54:01] is what has to reach up and take that
[1:54:03] word and it and it become a revelation
[1:54:05] to you let's stand
[1:54:08] together it's amazing to me Moses
[1:54:12] turned heard the voice John turned heard
[1:54:16] the voice what's left what must we do we
[1:54:20] must turn when we hear the voice that
[1:54:23] says I want to reveal myself to you I
[1:54:25] want to show you that there's more to
[1:54:27] who I am and the only way you're ever
[1:54:29] going to be able to know who you really
[1:54:31] are in me is to identify Who I Really Am
[1:54:35] how do we know what's coming to us how
[1:54:37] do we know what we have an inheritance
[1:54:38] to if we don't fully understand what he
[1:54:41] is who he is if we don't fully
[1:54:46] understand Christ how can we understand
[1:54:48] what it means to be in Christ or come
[1:54:50] from Christ or be a part of Christ how
[1:54:54] will we ever have
[1:54:56] Union if we continue to draw our
[1:54:59] strength from our own natural smarts or
[1:55:03] our own physical ability or lack thereof
[1:55:07] the only way we'll ever be able to
[1:55:09] operate as God has created us to operate
[1:55:11] in Tove is to let the sword of the Lord
[1:55:15] come and cut the veil of of trusting in
[1:55:18] self self you know persever uh uh
[1:55:21] preservation
[1:55:22] self-preservation I can do this my
[1:55:24] strength like Peter sometime who forgot
[1:55:27] what was in him and tried to trust his
[1:55:28] own strength to do the work of the Lord
[1:55:30] like Moses who thought he could deliver
[1:55:32] the children of Israel by killing one
[1:55:33] Egyptian none of that is going to
[1:55:35] operate and work properly in our lives
[1:55:37] in this hour and there's a sword to deal
[1:55:39] with it are we going to be able to move
[1:55:40] forward in fear if we're fear to if we
[1:55:42] have a fear to hear if we have a fear to
[1:55:44] see if we have a fear to reexamine what
[1:55:46] we
[1:55:49] believe if we have a fear to follow the
[1:55:52] pillar of fire because it might lead us
[1:55:53] out of our comfort zone how will we ever
[1:55:56] go forward in what God has called us to
[1:55:58] be we won't but that's all right because
[1:56:00] the the Lord is showed up the word is
[1:56:02] showed up it's here it's with us the
[1:56:04] message that you've been hearing this
[1:56:06] week the truths that have been coming
[1:56:07] what you've been feeding on for years
[1:56:09] now many of you has shown up it's here
[1:56:12] the sword will deal with it if you'll if
[1:56:13] you'll surrender if you'll yield what
[1:56:15] did the bush do
[1:56:16] yield you've got to yield your life to
[1:56:19] his life you've got to say I can't do it
[1:56:22] hardest thing for a man to say I
[1:56:25] can't best thing you could ever say I
[1:56:28] can't but greater is he that is in me
[1:56:30] than he that is in the world can you say
[1:56:33] Amen changed his face John's face was
[1:56:36] changed Moses face was changed there's a
[1:56:38] whole message there for another time
[1:56:40] another place did you notice that when
[1:56:42] Moses came down off the mountain with
[1:56:44] the fire with the with this countenance
[1:56:46] changed by the glory of the Lord in
[1:56:48] Exodus 34:30 it talks about the skin of
[1:56:51] his face shining and they were afraid to
[1:56:52] come n to him and Moses never told them
[1:56:55] any different Moses didn't say don't be
[1:56:57] afraid he left them right where they
[1:56:59] were because that was another Covenant
[1:57:02] he left them in their fear he left them
[1:57:04] in their reverence he made sure they
[1:57:06] didn't come any closer but that's not
[1:57:08] what Jesus said Jesus said to John fear
[1:57:10] not there's something on the other side
[1:57:13] of this sphere that I want you to see so
[1:57:15] get
[1:57:16] up tune your ear to my voice turn your
[1:57:21] eyes to what I want to unveil reveal and
[1:57:25] show you I'm the vine brother brandom
[1:57:27] said if this Vine ever puts forth
[1:57:30] another branch of its own which means
[1:57:33] its own life you can graph branches in
[1:57:37] that's what people constantly try to do
[1:57:39] they try to make a Pentecostal
[1:57:41] experience operate on a Baptist life or
[1:57:43] a or a or a charismatic experience
[1:57:46] operate on a Pentecostal life or we get
[1:57:48] all so confused and and so we've got so
[1:57:51] many different things Gra it in that's
[1:57:53] why this religious system is not only
[1:57:55] something to be concerned about but all
[1:57:57] those daughters who look just like
[1:58:01] her you look at the Book of Revelation
[1:58:03] once you get out of Genesis and you'll
[1:58:04] see that that great that great
[1:58:06] religious system that will deceive the
[1:58:08] nation had daughters and on her were
[1:58:11] written the names of blasphemy boy that
[1:58:13] sounds like Doom and Gloom it would only
[1:58:15] sound like Doom and Gloom if you're
[1:58:16] identifying on the other side of this
[1:58:18] thing I'm identifying on the side of
[1:58:20] this thing that wins
[1:58:22] come
[1:58:24] on Blasphemous names were in her because
[1:58:27] all she wanted to do was model herself
[1:58:28] after her mother we just want to be like
[1:58:30] her we just want to do things right and
[1:58:32] and do it just like no there's got to be
[1:58:34] a people that say we want to hear the
[1:58:35] word of the Lord and we want to adjust
[1:58:37] our lives because we want every Veil
[1:58:39] removed and the only way every Veil is
[1:58:41] going to be removed that prevents us is
[1:58:43] for the sword of the Lord that
[1:58:45] represents the Living Word of God to be
[1:58:47] operative in our lives to cut away the
[1:58:49] fear to cut away all the self-reliance
[1:58:52] how many of you'd like you're just
[1:58:53] willing to say Lord I'd like the sword
[1:58:55] of the Lord the sword of the revealed
[1:58:57] word of God the revelation of Jesus
[1:59:00] Christ I don't want to hear a sermon I
[1:59:02] want a message to come forth into my
[1:59:05] spirit that activates the seeds of
[1:59:07] Destiny and purpose I want to move out
[1:59:10] of the land of raw into the land of Tove
[1:59:13] I want to come from a Barren Place into
[1:59:17] a place of fruitfulness and so I yield
[1:59:19] myself put your hands up if you feel
[1:59:20] like you can I yield myself to the life
[1:59:24] of the fire I want the fire to fall and
[1:59:27] bring with it the life of God I want to
[1:59:31] survive from the life of God in organic
[1:59:36] Union with the life of God I want to
[1:59:38] become one with the Living Word of God I
[1:59:42] don't want to draw my life from my
[1:59:44] Christian
[1:59:45] Roots from my denominational
[1:59:48] roots from my history I I want to draw
[1:59:52] my life from the fire of God that brings
[1:59:56] the life here's the scripture we'll take
[1:59:59] home with us that the Apostle said it
[2:00:02] was so beautiful that some of us kind of
[2:00:05] missed it I know I did I know I missed
[2:00:08] it let me see if I can can put it here
[2:00:11] Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with
[2:00:14] Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[2:00:19] I yet not I but Christ liveth in me and
[2:00:24] the life that you now see me living the
[2:00:27] Apostle said this life which I now live
[2:00:30] in the flesh is not my natural life I
[2:00:34] now live by the faith of the Son of God
[2:00:37] who loved me and gave himself for me

[2:01:19] the Lord remove all the veils remove all
[2:01:21] the the Flesh and leave on the table for

[2:01:34] have to come forward but would you just
[2:01:35] step out in the aisle to identify
[2:01:38] yourself as someone who is willing
[2:01:41] completely to be evaluated by The Living
[2:01:44] Word of God by the sword of the spirit
[2:01:46] of the Lord uh that these messages that
[2:01:49] we heard and have and will hear tonight
[2:01:51] and tomorrow that they don't just go
[2:01:53] over us and bless us externally but we
[2:01:56] want a word my I feel the spirit of God
[2:01:58] now we want a word that penetrates the
[2:02:01] flesh life the soul life we want a word
[2:02:04] that brings Resurrection to the spirit
[2:02:06] we want our fallen Spirit to to be
[2:02:08] absolutely resurrected back into its
[2:02:10] original life amen God has come the word
[2:02:14] has come the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:02:16] has come to restore us to original life
[2:02:19] how many of you like to have that life
[2:02:21] that Adam had oh my more than that more
[2:02:24] than that is available so let's just
[2:02:26] pray you that are standing in the aisle
[2:02:28] right now just pray as they as they just
[2:02:30] Place something to help us with an
[2:02:32] atmosphere you just talk to the Lord
[2:02:34] right now and you tell the Lord I'm not
[2:02:36] putting any more words in your mouth you
[2:02:38] tell the Lord that you desire for him to
[2:02:41] evaluate your life and where you stand
[2:02:44] and your belief system by the revealed
[2:02:46] word of God let's do that right now as
[2:02:48] individuals Jesus Jesus here we are
[2:02:52] here we are Lord you have fed us this
[2:02:56] week you have fed us through soses
[2:03:00] through webinars through conferences
[2:03:02] through CDs through DVDs through
[2:03:04] cassettes Lord our feeding goes way back
[2:03:08] your word has been so rich but what we
[2:03:11] fear is that we might have allowed some
[2:03:13] of it not to be able to penetrate
[2:03:15] because of veils of our own belief
[2:03:17] system and veils of our own fear and
[2:03:21] veils of our own trusting in our
[2:03:23] strength and power in flesh to do it and
[2:03:25] the thoughts that works would work so
[2:03:28] Lord we come before you today
[2:03:30] individually individually We Stand
[2:03:34] ha
[2:03:36] Glory individually We
[2:03:40] Stand surrendering to the revealed word
[2:03:43] of God surrendering to the sword of the
[2:03:45] Lord the sword that no longer stands in
[2:03:47] position to guard the way it now stands
[2:03:50] in position to lead the
[2:03:53] way for those who have a heart to
[2:03:56] understand eyes to see ears to hear
[2:04:03] Mand preaching won't do it teaching
[2:04:05] won't do it prophecy won't do it it's
[2:04:07] only by the revelation of the holy
[2:04:09] spirit that our eyes can be open to see
[2:04:12] what you want us to see and we desire
[2:04:14] Lord Revelation that changes us and
[2:04:18] transforms us from glory to glory from
[2:04:21] strength to strength from Faith to Faith
[2:04:23] we're desperate here this morning tell
[2:04:28] him tell
[2:04:46] him more of you
[2:04:48] Lord if we could just walk out the
[2:04:51] instruction that you've already laid
[2:04:52] Upon Our
[2:04:54] Lives we would be so extremely
[2:04:57] blessed if you just launch us if you
[2:05:01] just let us take this thing forward and
[2:05:03] demonstrate it with our
[2:05:06] lives
[2:05:10] M it's really more of you we
[2:05:14] desire we're not looking for another
[2:05:17] touch we're looking for the transforming
[2:05:20] power of your word and
[2:05:23] Revelation to to mold us to make us to
[2:05:25] shape us to change us we lay our rotten
[2:05:29] attitudes before you we we lay our
[2:05:31] opinions before you we lay our desire to
[2:05:33] control and
[2:05:34] manipulate with Christian witchcraft we
[2:05:37] lay that before you we surrender our
[2:05:40] gifts back to the one who gave them we
[2:05:42] say Lord if we can't use them in the
[2:05:44] genuine flow of your spirit without
[2:05:46] mixture we don't want
[2:05:49] them if you'll release the the purity of
[2:05:52] your word and the grace to operate the
[2:05:55] gifts as you would operate them and not
[2:05:57] as we would do it in the flesh and if
[2:05:59] that can't happen we we release them we
[2:06:01] surrender
[2:06:02] them we cannot
[2:06:05] survive in our own strength and
[2:06:10] power if this Vine ever puts forth
[2:06:13] another branch of its own life the life
[2:06:15] of Jesus Christ there would have to be
[2:06:17] another book of Acts written to record
[2:06:19] the glory to record the miracle to
[2:06:22] record the power that the spoken
[2:06:24] creative word of God would accomplish in
[2:06:26] the earth one of the greatest if not the
[2:06:30] greatest Ministries since the days of
[2:06:33] the Apostles and he stood as a humble
[2:06:36] servant and said the world is yet to see
[2:06:40] what God can accomplish in one man who
[2:06:44] is fully
[2:06:47] surrendered Lord if brother brandham
[2:06:49] didn't model what it looks like to be a
[2:06:51] Son of God manifested I have no idea
[2:06:54] where to
[2:06:55] look if his ministry was not an example
[2:06:58] of what a full adopted son of God looks
[2:07:01] like I would not even begin to know who
[2:07:04] to follow who to learn from who to
[2:07:06] listen
[2:07:08] to but if he was an example to us then
[2:07:12] we need a bride to raise up in the same
[2:07:17] Glory same Authority same power not in
[2:07:20] the same office office but in the same
[2:07:24] Authority with the same word in our
[2:07:27] mouths to bring forth the proof to bring
[2:07:30] forth a
[2:07:32] demonstration that we are the sons of
[2:07:34] God and it does not yet appear what we
[2:07:36] shall be but we know that when he
[2:07:39] appears in his full perusia presence
[2:07:42] that we will be like him we will know
[2:07:46] him because we will be like him made
[2:07:50] fashion and created In His Image
[2:07:53] Hallelujah not as created sons of God
[2:07:55] but as Spirit born sons of God we love
[2:07:59] you Lord we love you Lord we love you
[2:08:01] Lord we love you Lord I I just release
[2:08:04] you in a moment too but right now I just
[2:08:05] release the the Tove word of the Lord
[2:08:07] over you I want you to know right now
[2:08:11] that there are things in your life seeds
[2:08:13] of Destiny and purpose that are in your
[2:08:15] life that have already began to sprout
[2:08:18] and bring forth and Satan is trying to
[2:08:20] talk you out of a Tove existence and
[2:08:23] into a raw place where you doubt what
[2:08:26] God has already started in you tell the
[2:08:28] Devil he's a liar tell him right now if
[2:08:31] you're struggling in that area tell him
[2:08:33] you're not going to hold my mind you're
[2:08:36] not going to hold me captive I may not
[2:08:38] be in full Harvest mode I may not be
[2:08:41] bringing forth all the seeds of purpose
[2:08:43] and Destiny that have been created and
[2:08:45] planted in me but Lord I want to glory
[2:08:48] and celebrate what you have started in
[2:08:53] me I celebrate the fruit that has come
[2:08:58] forth with anticipation for the fruit
[2:09:02] that will come forth glory be to God do
[2:09:05] you want to praise the Lord for what he
[2:09:07] has already done in your life Jesus
[2:09:10] let's do that right now quickly
[2:09:12] hallelujah
[2:09:13] hallelujah
[2:09:17] hallelujah glory to the lamb
[2:09:21] I've had it all but what I've got to
[2:09:24] have is more of the
[2:09:25] Lord praise the Lord
