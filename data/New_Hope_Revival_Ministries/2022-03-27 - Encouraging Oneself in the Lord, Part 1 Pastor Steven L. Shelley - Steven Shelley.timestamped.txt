[41:27] there are many in the house
[41:29] many on the stream
[41:34] someone has turned in a prayer request
[41:36] for a 14 year old young man who tried to
[41:39] take his life
[41:40] he's still alive but barely and we want
[41:42] to cover that
[41:44] whole family and that situation to the
[41:46] lord in prayer that god would undertake
[41:50] there will be a number of people
[41:51] traveling this week
[41:54] to get here for friday saturday and
[41:56] sunday and
[41:57] we're only going by those who have
[41:59] committed to come but we're looking for
[42:02] i don't know somewhere between 35 to 50
[42:04] visitors from out of state
[42:07] and
[42:08] we're asking the lord to watch over them
[42:10] every step of the way
[42:12] and i also want to request prayer
[42:16] for a need let me let me pull it up so i
[42:19] can get it just right but i've had two
[42:21] of our
[42:22] former amish brethren to contact me this
[42:24] week
[42:25] and they're asking us to pray for a
[42:27] little baby that'll be about 10 days old
[42:29] today
[42:30] born to amos
[42:32] and his wife amos miller and his wife
[42:35] ari i believe is how you say it
[42:38] she's the baby is a little girl nine
[42:40] days old very weak
[42:42] not able to take in any nourishment
[42:45] they really need a miracle this is
[42:47] sister elizabeth's oldest daughter's
[42:50] baby that we're praying for so this is
[42:52] an emergency need that god would move
[42:55] and undertake for them
[42:57] pray for the meetings that god will do
[43:00] all that he purposes to do
[43:02] and that i will not be in his way
[43:05] or any of us that we won't get in his
[43:07] way that we'll just let him do whatever
[43:09] it is that he purposes to do we know
[43:12] that god has an appointment with us i
[43:14] know it
[43:15] amen
[43:19] to the lord in the time of their loss
[43:21] particularly sister anita that god
[43:24] will rescue her and bring her through
[43:26] with great grace
[43:28] i know that there's not been anything
[43:30] said publicly that i know of about the
[43:32] funeral i've been checking the obituary
[43:35] at the funeral home and it has not been
[43:37] updated but the last
[43:39] contact i had with sister
[43:41] with the crystalline and also stephanie
[43:43] is have there been any changes
[43:45] crystalline
[43:47] so the funeral will be on saturday april
[43:51] 9th
[43:52] that's not the saturday of the meetings
[43:54] sister anita
[43:56] wanted to make sure that it was not
[43:58] during the meeting i appreciate that so
[44:00] much
[44:01] what love she has for us to do that so
[44:04] the funeral will be at the pentecostal
[44:06] church in lagrange
[44:08] where brother steve has pastored it will
[44:10] be on saturday april the 9th i think at
[44:14] 2 o'clock
[44:15] 2 o'clock
[44:16] and
[44:17] we're expecting that the lord will
[44:19] minister to every grieving heart
[44:22] but we're also expecting there to be the
[44:24] presence of the lord
[44:26] to move as our brother would have
[44:28] desired that to be the case so
[44:30] um
[44:31] you know it's awful to say but i look
[44:34] forward to what god will do
[44:36] and

[1:01:36] brother hawk and his family brother r.j

[1:01:44] give them mercy
[1:01:46] and traveling grace as they go
[1:01:49] as they come
[1:01:51] there they've already gone now now
[1:01:53] they're coming home
[1:01:54] uh brother and sister greeley are out of
[1:01:57] town this weekend as you all heard
[1:02:00] tuesday night preaching for
[1:02:02] highlands bible tabernacle
[1:02:04] where brother lindsay mcgrady is the
[1:02:06] pastor and these are very old friends of
[1:02:09] ours
[1:02:10] and they are experiencing a few days of
[1:02:14] rest
[1:02:15] and recuperation in hawaii
[1:02:23] yep
[1:02:25] we're in salem this morning
[1:02:28] but that's all right we're in god's
[1:02:30] presence
[1:02:31] we got one little picture posted that's
[1:02:33] all but i'm hoping they'll show us
[1:02:35] something else pretty about hawaii
[1:02:38] it belongs to us you know
[1:02:41] so we ought to have to get over there at
[1:02:43] least one time to claim our inheritance
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:48] but i told brother greeley
[1:02:50] what an honor it is that a pastor who's
[1:02:52] going to be away from his congregation
[1:02:55] would call you and ask you to come and
[1:02:58] fill in for him on thursday night and
[1:03:00] again on sunday evening
[1:03:02] and stay in their home while they're
[1:03:04] away i think you know that's real trust
[1:03:07] and
[1:03:07] hospitality and uh appreciated that so
[1:03:10] much that's the kind of people they are
[1:03:12] that's the kind of people the greeleys
[1:03:14] are but we miss them
[1:03:17] we uh i would like to apologize because
[1:03:20] sometimes i have it all written down
[1:03:23] to call out the birthdays and
[1:03:26] i just get sidetracked and go to
[1:03:28] preaching and and forget about it and i
[1:03:31] hope you'll know that it's not because
[1:03:32] it's you
[1:03:34] it's not because i want to miss your
[1:03:36] birthday but or your anniversary but uh
[1:03:39] it's because sometimes it's just a lot
[1:03:41] to remember when you get up here
[1:03:43] but let's continue to remember sister
[1:03:45] audrey as she is with her mother sister
[1:03:48] chambers in jamaica that god will be
[1:03:50] with them
[1:03:52] also we want to pray for sister tebow
[1:03:55] all the time that god will continue to
[1:03:56] strengthen her she was able to go to the
[1:03:58] wedding
[1:03:59] last weekend which was a real blessing
[1:04:02] and
[1:04:03] i had a beautiful picture brother billy
[1:04:05] sent me a beautiful picture of her and i
[1:04:07] know that she's in pain and i know that
[1:04:09] she's going through a lot of things
[1:04:11] under the chemo
[1:04:12] but she
[1:04:14] certainly looked beautiful and radiant
[1:04:16] in that picture and that made me very
[1:04:18] happy
[1:04:19] and we're looking forward to the day
[1:04:20] that all of that is behind her and she's
[1:04:22] worshiping with us again
[1:04:25] and we haven't forgotten her
[1:04:27] so i was supposed to mention last sunday
[1:04:29] that it was uh rebecca botchway who is
[1:04:32] one of our streamers
[1:04:33] sister botsway who's been here her
[1:04:35] daughter's birthday last sunday and i
[1:04:37] didn't mention it and
[1:04:39] uh a little estee esther had her
[1:04:42] birthday on monday of last week and
[1:04:44] brother
[1:04:45] miller brother truman miller will be
[1:04:48] here for the meetings from missouri
[1:04:49] isn't that wonderful we're looking
[1:04:51] forward to them being here
[1:04:54] it was brother truman's birthday on
[1:04:56] tuesday and he doesn't care whether you
[1:04:57] mention it or not
[1:05:00] but since he don't care i want to be
[1:05:02] sure to do it
[1:05:03] sister phoebe's birthday was on thursday
[1:05:06] and we love sister phoebe and we wish
[1:05:08] that she could be here from pennsylvania
[1:05:11] for these meetings and it was also
[1:05:13] sister flo's anniversary and her husband
[1:05:16] has been gone long long time
[1:05:18] but uh it was still a very special day
[1:05:21] in her life there's no doubt about that
[1:05:23] god knows what he's doing
[1:05:26] tomorrow is brother and sister greeley's
[1:05:28] anniversary
[1:05:29] they could be in another service
[1:05:31] somewhere or they may be streaming this
[1:05:33] meeting today and if they happen to
[1:05:35] stream or watch in the archive
[1:05:38] we want to wish them a very happy
[1:05:40] anniversary and say that we love you

[1:05:51] don't have your birthday so if you'll
[1:05:53] text it to me we'll get it added to the
[1:05:54] calendar so we can embarrass you like we
[1:05:57] embarrass everybody else we don't want
[1:05:59] you to be left out of the fun
[1:06:01] next saturday
[1:06:03] you know it's it's just kind of
[1:06:05] unfortunate that it was right in the
[1:06:07] middle of our meetings and we don't get
[1:06:09] to do much of a celebration for her
[1:06:11] except to shake her hand and say happy
[1:06:13] birthday
[1:06:14] because it is monumental sister elfrida
[1:06:17] has a birthday next saturday that to me
[1:06:19] is i don't even believe it
[1:06:22] i don't believe it
[1:06:24] if i didn't have it on paper
[1:06:26] i would not believe it
[1:06:28] i saw her up here worshiping the lord
[1:06:30] today her skin her face was radiant
[1:06:34] and she does not look her coming age
[1:06:38] can we tell or can we
[1:06:40] she's a little bit uh blushing
[1:06:44] but she said 80 sure
[1:06:47] can you all imagine that sister alfreda
[1:06:50] is going to be 80 years old next
[1:06:52] saturday
[1:06:53] it's just it's just unbelievable
[1:06:56] how did these years go by so quickly
[1:06:59] to have the health that she has and the
[1:07:01] strength of mind that she has and the
[1:07:04] desire to get up here and worship god in
[1:07:06] these services
[1:07:08] i don't even think we have to mention it
[1:07:10] anymore
[1:07:11] because it's just a number but we want
[1:07:14] to say happy birthday to you early we'll
[1:07:16] do it again on your birthday but god
[1:07:18] bless you eight
[1:07:19] zero
[1:07:24] in her family that's relatively young
[1:07:27] right because you have quite a few
[1:07:29] siblings that are older than you are
[1:07:34] the oldest is 90
[1:07:36] and the youngest is 76
[1:07:39] 77
[1:07:40] and at least at least two or three of
[1:07:43] those siblings are streaming this
[1:07:45] service this morning so we just say
[1:07:47] isn't god good isn't he good to sister
[1:07:50] wagner and sister lydia and sister adina
[1:07:54] god has been so good to them
[1:07:56] and we're so thankful for the goodness
[1:07:58] of the lord now
[1:08:00] uh we need some help on friday morning
[1:08:02] or whenever you all can decide that it
[1:08:05] can be done but we need some help
[1:08:08] getting the little tents up we're gonna
[1:08:09] put them right out here and hope it
[1:08:11] doesn't rain and get windy but we need
[1:08:14] some covering and protection because
[1:08:17] we've had another little chili snap
[1:08:19] you know
[1:08:20] just about the time you take things out
[1:08:23] and put them outside and get then the
[1:08:25] chill comes back i'm thankful
[1:08:29] and if you're if you're one of them
[1:08:31] complaining about it do not come to me
[1:08:33] in july
[1:08:35] and tell me anything about how hot it is
[1:08:38] you just enjoy the cool while you can
[1:08:41] but we're going to be feeding everyone
[1:08:43] you're going to be feeding everyone
[1:08:45] because
[1:08:46] it was within a few hours that most of
[1:08:48] you had responded quickly
[1:08:51] to say what you would bring and what you
[1:08:53] would do and you know i'm i know i'm an
[1:08:55] emotional person but i teared it it
[1:08:57] brought tears to my eyes
[1:08:59] because i said you just asked the people
[1:09:01] to help and they just help
[1:09:04] there's no begging necessary they just
[1:09:06] do it
[1:09:07] and they're bold about it and they help
[1:09:10] us so that we don't have to be concerned
[1:09:12] about it and i want to thank every one
[1:09:14] of you we're going to be feeding
[1:09:15] everyone friday night
[1:09:17] saturday at lunchtime for those who come
[1:09:19] to spend some time of fellowship on the
[1:09:21] campground
[1:09:23] saturday night after the service and
[1:09:25] then sunday morning or sunday afternoon
[1:09:28] after the service we're going to have a
[1:09:30] a great time together everyone bringing
[1:09:32] something
[1:09:33] and we need to make sure that we bring
[1:09:35] enough because we don't really know who
[1:09:36] all is coming we're expecting at least
[1:09:39] one fifteen passenger van from our uh
[1:09:42] brothers and sisters former amish
[1:09:44] brothers and sisters
[1:09:46] and uh we are

[1:09:53] wonderful time i wouldn't miss it i'll
[1:09:56] tell you that right now i believe that
[1:09:58] it's a moad
[1:10:00] i do it's not one of those feasts of the
[1:10:02] lord mentioned in the bible but i tell
[1:10:04] you i believe it's a divine appointment
[1:10:06] with us

[1:10:20] we're going to worship him and see what
[1:10:22] god will do
[1:10:24] we're needy we have needs here
[1:10:26] but every person who's coming is needy
[1:10:29] they're coming because they have needs
[1:10:31] and because they're i was thinking this
[1:10:34] morning as i was getting ready just the
[1:10:36] rumor
[1:10:37] that god was going to do something
[1:10:40] it's what stirred these people's hearts
[1:10:42] to come
[1:10:43] and you know that's the way it's going
[1:10:44] to be even greater measure in the end
[1:10:46] time just the rumor that god may show up
[1:10:49] and do something outstanding will bring
[1:10:51] people here
[1:10:52] and other places where god is meeting
[1:10:55] with his people
[1:10:56] i want to say welcome to brother peter
[1:10:59] and sister sarah this morning
[1:11:01] i want to say a bigger welcome to

[1:11:11] i've been seeing pictures of him
[1:11:14] there's nothing like meeting someone in
[1:11:16] person if you saw me go out there and
[1:11:18] worship that's what i was doing because
[1:11:20] i don't know how busy it will be after
[1:11:22] the service so i wanted a face-to-face
[1:11:24] glimpse because i was beginning to think
[1:11:26] he was going to walk in to his first
[1:11:28] service here to visit us but i'm so
[1:11:31] thankful two months he's right right at
[1:11:33] about two months or

[1:11:51] god is strengthening them and helping
[1:11:53] them and
[1:11:54] and uh nathan's getting a little more
[1:11:56] sleep i don't know about sister
[1:11:58] shoshanna but nathan really needed it
[1:12:00] too he was looking a little peaked there
[1:12:02] but he's getting it and he's been taking
[1:12:05] nice walks
[1:12:06] uh
[1:12:07] with with little sister edith and i know
[1:12:09] they stopped to see sister weems the
[1:12:11] other day and she's already been to
[1:12:13] visit me in my office so i feel really
[1:12:16] really special and i'm so thankful that
[1:12:18] god has brought them through
[1:12:20] and we're looking forward to god
[1:12:22] strengthening them to be back in service
[1:12:24] with us we know that the lord is able
[1:12:27] brother greeley wanted me to mention i'm
[1:12:29] going to preach in a minute
[1:12:31] uh
[1:12:32] for longer than a minute
[1:12:34] but in a minute
[1:12:36] um brother greeley wanted me to mention
[1:12:38] that he felt like it was a good idea
[1:12:41] you can certainly continue to keep doing
[1:12:43] what you've been doing for the principal
[1:12:45] offering
[1:12:46] but he said he felt like it would be a
[1:12:48] good idea for april
[1:12:50] if we would funnel any extra funds that
[1:12:53] came in
[1:12:54] to the expense of the meetings
[1:12:57] and not take a specific principle
[1:12:59] offering this was something that he had
[1:13:01] in his mind
[1:13:03] i had not yet thought of that but i have
[1:13:05] to tell you i was very relieved
[1:13:07] when he sent the text
[1:13:09] because we have taken on quite a bit of
[1:13:11] responsibility
[1:13:13] and there are some that we're helping
[1:13:15] out with their hotel rooms because we
[1:13:17] don't have we don't have enough room in
[1:13:20] our homes for them
[1:13:21] i look forward to a day that god brings
[1:13:24] his total word to pass and we have
[1:13:25] accommodations right here on the
[1:13:27] campground i feel it
[1:13:29] i haven't given up
[1:13:31] i still feel it sometimes i close my
[1:13:34] eyes and see them i was talking to my
[1:13:36] wife about them the other day i believe
[1:13:37] god's going to give us that
[1:13:39] i just don't like giving marriott that
[1:13:42] much money because they are hilton
[1:13:45] hilton i mean
[1:13:47] you know
[1:13:49] hampton or hilton i mean what is the
[1:13:51] express holiday inn express
[1:13:54] i don't like giving them that much money
[1:13:56] i know that god can help us one of these
[1:13:58] days but until we do that
[1:14:02] we want to make sure that the needs are
[1:14:04] met we're able to help these people that
[1:14:06] will come when the former amish people
[1:14:09] come we always provide their room
[1:14:11] because we want to be hospitable to them
[1:14:14] and i would just only briefly mention
[1:14:17] that they have been very generous to us
[1:14:19] toward our principal payment and we
[1:14:21] thank god for that they are giving
[1:14:24] people and loving people
[1:14:26] but it's just in my heart to make that
[1:14:28] available to them and they always try to
[1:14:30] be careful how many they bring and i
[1:14:32] said one van is that all you can get
[1:14:34] together
[1:14:35] you know bring two or three you just
[1:14:38] bring them
[1:14:39] all of you come that would be wonderful
[1:14:41] and uh we want to take care of brother
[1:14:43] miller and his family and uh
[1:14:46] we're just believing that every need is
[1:14:47] going to be met austin if you would come
[1:14:50] back i i hate to take the time to do
[1:14:52] this but i think it would be a real good
[1:14:54] idea
[1:14:55] because the expenses are starting this
[1:14:57] week if we would ask you to sow into
[1:15:00] these meetings i think it is actually a
[1:15:03] spiritual also because
[1:15:05] we plant a seed and we expect a harvest
[1:15:07] is that right i'm not going to preach on
[1:15:09] giving i don't have to
[1:15:11] because you people are faithful but
[1:15:13] please please know that brother greeley
[1:15:15] has
[1:15:16] asked that we not to receive a special
[1:15:18] offering next sunday for the principal
[1:15:20] for the month of april but that we
[1:15:23] funnel any extra funds that way
[1:15:25] we try to provide food we try to put
[1:15:28] hospitality baskets in the rooms
[1:15:31] we try to go beyond above and beyond to
[1:15:35] let people know we appreciate them
[1:15:37] coming to be with us
[1:15:39] i've been out there on the road and i
[1:15:41] know what it means to feel welcome
[1:15:43] and to be made to feel
[1:15:45] like you're important and they're glad
[1:15:47] that you're there and that's how we want
[1:15:49] to make people feel and we we may not be
[1:15:52] the best at it but i think we do very
[1:15:54] well in letting people know that we
[1:15:56] appreciate them here so this would be
[1:15:58] for any extra expenses that would arise
[1:16:01] including accommodations and
[1:16:03] and food and i know you're doing a lot
[1:16:05] of the cooking but we always have to go
[1:16:07] and get this or get that or do the other
[1:16:09] so lord we thank you that you are
[1:16:12] you know this is just a divine setup
[1:16:14] lord
[1:16:16] we've watched it come together it just
[1:16:19] it's really been unplanned
[1:16:22] it's been a bit unexpected
[1:16:24] we were just so blessed when our brother
[1:16:26] was here that we said hey we want you to
[1:16:28] come back and
[1:16:29] and we know if we don't get it on the
[1:16:31] books it may never happen so
[1:16:33] we want you to come and we want you to
[1:16:35] come for saturday and sunday
[1:16:38] and then brother greeley said why not
[1:16:39] friday night too and so everything just
[1:16:41] started coming together
[1:16:44] and as the rumor got out people begin to
[1:16:46] say we're coming so lord we just have to
[1:16:48] believe that you're setting this up
[1:16:51] you're doing it
[1:16:52] and we want to honor you for that
[1:16:54] because we want to live lives that are
[1:16:57] led by the spirit
[1:16:59] and we're not
[1:17:00] worried or fretting over any expense
[1:17:04] we're just asking you to make a way to
[1:17:06] provide so that we can be as kind to
[1:17:09] your people as you would desire for us
[1:17:11] to be
[1:17:12] and so we ask that you would bless this
[1:17:14] back to the believer
[1:17:17] pressed down shaken together and running
[1:17:20] over
[1:17:21] in the wonderful name of the lord jesus
[1:17:24] christ we pray amen
[1:17:27] and amen we'll probably do the same next
[1:17:29] sunday and you can if you're not
[1:17:31] prepared to help us today you can then
[1:17:35] would you bring your offering now if you
[1:17:37] want to send it with one of the children

[1:21:48] god bless you jeremiah 31 3 the lord
[1:21:52] hath appeared of old unto me saying
[1:21:57] yea
[1:21:58] i have loved thee with an everlasting
[1:22:01] love
[1:22:02] therefore
[1:22:04] with loving kindness have i drawn thee
[1:22:08] any good
[1:22:10] isn't he good to draw us like that
[1:22:14] again i will build thee
[1:22:17] and thou shalt be built o
[1:22:20] virgin of israel
[1:22:23] thou shalt again be adorned with thy
[1:22:26] tabrets
[1:22:27] and shall go forth in the dances of them
[1:22:32] that make
[1:22:34] mary
[1:22:36] i want you to
[1:22:37] put a finger there just a moment and
[1:22:39] listen to me
[1:22:40] this is a
[1:22:42] prophecy
[1:22:44] concerning a final restoration
[1:22:48] there are many people who say that the
[1:22:51] order of worship changed if you'll just
[1:22:55] look this way a moment
[1:22:57] they say that the order of worship
[1:23:00] changed from the old testament to the
[1:23:03] new
[1:23:05] and they say that that's why we don't
[1:23:08] read any instruments in the new
[1:23:10] testament and we don't read of dancing
[1:23:13] and some of the
[1:23:15] expressions of davidic praise in the new
[1:23:18] testament they say that's because the
[1:23:20] order of worship changed between the old
[1:23:23] testament and the new testament and i
[1:23:24] totally reject that
[1:23:27] i do not believe that that's god's plan
[1:23:30] at all
[1:23:31] what i understand is that there were
[1:23:34] there was very little need for
[1:23:37] reinforcing and
[1:23:39] rehashing you might say the way that
[1:23:42] people worshipped in the new testament
[1:23:45] because it was established already
[1:23:48] the jewish people had an established
[1:23:51] expression of worship and the gentiles
[1:23:54] just jumped right in with them and
[1:23:57] worshipped god the way they worshiped
[1:23:59] god
[1:24:01] then there are though you don't have to
[1:24:02] say man it's truth anyway
[1:24:05] uh god dealt with the sin problem he
[1:24:08] didn't deal with the worship problem
[1:24:09] because worship wasn't a problem
[1:24:12] amen now the the institutionalized
[1:24:15] church has decided what worship should
[1:24:17] look like in 2022 but i just reject that
[1:24:22] because you can't tell me how to worship
[1:24:24] my god
[1:24:25] that's between he and i
[1:24:27] and the only pattern we have is the
[1:24:30] bible
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:33] now before i read on i want to say one
[1:24:35] more thing i know you're standing i can
[1:24:36] make sure you're listening that way
[1:24:38] there are those in the message of the
[1:24:40] hour
[1:24:41] who
[1:24:42] acknowledge brother branham as a prophet
[1:24:45] sent to prepare a bride for jesus christ
[1:24:49] i acknowledge that i believe that is the
[1:24:51] truth i believe he had a message thus
[1:24:54] saith the lord i believe that
[1:24:57] and i thank god for that but many say
[1:24:59] then that there has been another change
[1:25:03] and not only did worship change between
[1:25:05] old testament and new testament
[1:25:07] they say that now that the word has come
[1:25:11] worship is changed again
[1:25:13] and now we have another form of worship
[1:25:16] which seems to me to be very dry
[1:25:20] very dusty
[1:25:23] sometimes not even heard of just singing
[1:25:27] there's more to worship than singing
[1:25:30] so i just want to say to you today
[1:25:32] you're free to have your own thought
[1:25:36] you're grown you can think as you like
[1:25:38] to think but if you're looking to the
[1:25:41] word of god as an example for worship
[1:25:44] then you're doing the right thing
[1:25:46] and to assume that because you don't
[1:25:49] read something
[1:25:52] in the new testament that god's done
[1:25:54] with it is a very dangerous assumption
[1:25:58] very dangerous assumption
[1:26:00] it doesn't even work with the laws of
[1:26:02] theology when we look at god's word
[1:26:05] doesn't even fit with the continuity of
[1:26:07] scripture
[1:26:08] and to assume that because the word has
[1:26:11] now taken preeminence we should worship
[1:26:14] less
[1:26:17] is a dangerous assumption
[1:26:20] you know if this word has been restored
[1:26:22] then who is this among us
[1:26:25] this is the living word
[1:26:27] and if the living word is in this house
[1:26:30] we ought to give him all the praise and
[1:26:34] the glory and the honor that he's worthy
[1:26:37] of
[1:26:38] we only have these bodies to do it with
[1:26:41] so i want you to know that this is a
[1:26:43] prophecy concerning a time that god is
[1:26:47] going to restore to the house of israel
[1:26:52] all that she has lost in the years of
[1:26:55] her grieving and pain
[1:26:57] now god's already given her a homeland
[1:27:00] can the saints say amen
[1:27:02] and there are those who worship
[1:27:04] in the homeland but there's going to be
[1:27:07] a time when the nation
[1:27:10] will worship god in the way that she has
[1:27:12] worshiped god in the beginning
[1:27:15] and that is to be adorned with thy
[1:27:18] tabrets and shall go forth in the dance
[1:27:22] in the dances of them that make merry
[1:27:26] thou shalt yet plant vines
[1:27:30] upon the mountains of samaria
[1:27:33] the planters shall plant and shall eat
[1:27:36] them as common things i have stood in
[1:27:40] samaria and helped to tend the grapes
[1:27:44] nathan spent a significant amount of
[1:27:47] time in the in the uh orchards the uh
[1:27:51] vineyards
[1:27:52] of samaria tending the grapevines
[1:27:57] proving that god is restoring israel one
[1:28:01] layer at a time
[1:28:04] i've danced in the vineyards of samaria
[1:28:07] hallelujah
[1:28:08] and worship the god who has made these
[1:28:11] things possible
[1:28:13] for there shall be a day that the
[1:28:14] watchman upon the mount ephraim shall
[1:28:17] cry arise ye and let us go up to zion
[1:28:21] unto
[1:28:22] the lord our god
[1:28:24] for thus saith the lord
[1:28:27] sing
[1:28:28] with gladness for jacob
[1:28:31] and shout among the chief of the nations
[1:28:36] publishy
[1:28:38] praise ye
[1:28:40] and say oh
[1:28:42] lord save thy
[1:28:45] people the remnant of israel
[1:28:50] hallelujah behold i will bring them from
[1:28:53] the north country he's still
[1:28:56] doing that today
[1:29:01] thank you mr putin
[1:29:06] you're a tyrant
[1:29:08] but you are fulfilling the word of the
[1:29:11] lord
[1:29:12] because the oh
[1:29:16] because the exiles are still coming home
[1:29:22] this week a holocaust survivor
[1:29:26] from ukraine is wheeled off the airplane
[1:29:33] unable to get down on the ground and
[1:29:35] kiss the dirt so she asked one of the
[1:29:38] little boys or girls that was near her
[1:29:40] sweetheart would you schleck excuse me
[1:29:43] would you get down and kiss the ground
[1:29:47] and help me give thanks to god for
[1:29:49] bringing me out of exile
[1:29:52] into the land of promise
[1:29:55] oh yes
[1:29:56] you're living in that day
[1:29:59] where god is still gathering together
[1:30:02] i will bring them from the north country
[1:30:04] and gather them from the coast of the
[1:30:07] earth
[1:30:08] and with them the blind and the lame
[1:30:11] the woman with child and her that
[1:30:13] travaileth with child together a great
[1:30:16] company
[1:30:20] shall return thither there are many
[1:30:22] prophecy teachers who believe that the
[1:30:24] biggest portion of the jews have come
[1:30:27] home i don't believe that
[1:30:30] i believe that there are many new
[1:30:32] generations of jewish people that have
[1:30:35] had no connection to the homeland that
[1:30:37] will be coming home in the next months
[1:30:40] and years
[1:30:41] and it'll have to be a quick work
[1:30:44] and only god knows what it will take to
[1:30:46] drive them there but they must come home
[1:30:49] the prophet said a jew is not a jew
[1:30:51] unless he's in the homeland which means
[1:30:54] he has no right to his ancestral
[1:30:56] promises until he goes home to claim
[1:30:58] them
[1:30:59] you've got to be in the right position
[1:31:02] to claim the right promise
[1:31:04] they shall come with weeping and with
[1:31:06] supplications will i lead them i will
[1:31:08] cause them to walk by the rivers of
[1:31:10] waters in a straight way wherein they
[1:31:13] shall not stumble
[1:31:14] for i am a father to israel and ephraim
[1:31:18] is my first born
[1:31:22] now
[1:31:23] we're being told here that when they
[1:31:25] come they'll come weeping
[1:31:28] they'll come burdened down with the
[1:31:30] weight of being driven out of their
[1:31:32] homes
[1:31:34] and leaving everything behind but once
[1:31:37] they get there oh
[1:31:39] i will build thee verse 4 and thou shalt
[1:31:42] be built o virgin of israel thou shall
[1:31:46] again be adorned with thy tabrets and
[1:31:49] shall go forth in the dances of them
[1:31:52] that make
[1:31:53] mary

[1:31:57] word is yet being fulfilled
[1:31:59] it is a continuation even in our day
[1:32:03] that started when israel was was
[1:32:06] re-established as a state as a nation
[1:32:09] for the jewish people in exile we thank
[1:32:12] you for this why does it matter to the
[1:32:14] gentiles because it's a vital integral
[1:32:17] part of what you have purpose to do in
[1:32:21] the end time both jew and gentile coming
[1:32:25] together as a new man to claim the full
[1:32:29] covenant and inheritance of the god of
[1:32:31] israel how we thank you for that
[1:32:35] how we thank you for restoring dancing
[1:32:39] to the heavy feet
[1:32:41] of the jewish people
[1:32:43] and lord jesus i want to thank you today
[1:32:47] for restoring dancing
[1:32:50] to the heavy feet of your little bride
[1:32:54] i pray that she will break out of every
[1:32:58] tradition and custom
[1:33:00] that has bound her to the place that she
[1:33:04] cannot worship you with the freedom that
[1:33:06] david worshipped you with
[1:33:08] i thank you for establishing holy spirit
[1:33:11] order
[1:33:13] instead of man's order
[1:33:15] we give you glory and honor and praise
[1:33:18] for it's in the name above every name
[1:33:20] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:33:22] pray
[1:33:23] and the saints said
[1:33:25] amen you may be seated psalms
[1:33:28] 30. i need your help today
[1:33:30] psalm 30
[1:33:32] 11 and 12
[1:33:34] thou hast turned
[1:33:37] for me
[1:33:39] my morning
[1:33:41] into dancing
[1:33:44] thou hast put off
[1:33:47] my sackcloth
[1:33:49] and girded me
[1:33:51] with gladness how many of you are
[1:33:53] dressed with gladness today you can be
[1:33:55] you must be
[1:33:57] you got to be
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:00] the hour has come that we have to throw
[1:34:03] off those heavy bands
[1:34:07] and those mournful garments
[1:34:10] and come in to the fullness of the
[1:34:12] presence of the lord
[1:34:14] because there's coming an hour when
[1:34:16] you're token is going to be tested
[1:34:21] anybody with me
[1:34:23] i don't hear you
[1:34:25] your token is going to be tested
[1:34:28] and you're going to have to prove that
[1:34:30] you have been with the bridegroom
[1:34:35] my my my my
[1:34:37] let me have a little water here i don't
[1:34:39] have there it is i didn't bring it let
[1:34:41] me have a little water cause i see that
[1:34:43] i'm gonna have to dig some ditches
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:52] the reason why praise
[1:34:55] and worship is so important in this late
[1:34:59] hour in the end time is it ushers us in
[1:35:03] to that secret place
[1:35:07] where brother branham said the veil
[1:35:10] falls behind us
[1:35:13] you see there was an hour
[1:35:15] dispensationally that the veil was in
[1:35:18] front of us
[1:35:20] and it prevented us from entering in to
[1:35:24] the full second glory of god
[1:35:28] we're no longer living in an hour where
[1:35:31] the veil is locking us out
[1:35:35] we're living in the hour of the of the
[1:35:38] rind veil the rended veil the broken
[1:35:42] veil
[1:35:44] from top to bottom
[1:35:46] god was opening up a way for you to come
[1:35:49] in to the holy of holies and experience
[1:35:54] a real intimacy and relationship
[1:35:59] with our messiah bridegroom
[1:36:01] come on
[1:36:02] and it is not an option
[1:36:08] it's not for just the weak minded
[1:36:12] or the emotional
[1:36:14] as you like to call us
[1:36:18] it's for every son
[1:36:20] [Music]
[1:36:22] you must come in and become one
[1:36:26] with messiah
[1:36:29] we know that this is not a sexual union
[1:36:33] but god chose
[1:36:35] the the relationship between a husband
[1:36:38] and a wife
[1:36:40] to symbolize
[1:36:43] the unity
[1:36:45] the union
[1:36:47] and the oneness
[1:36:49] the communion
[1:36:51] of the bridegroom
[1:36:52] and the bride
[1:36:54] did he not
[1:36:55] it's a bridal paradigm isn't it
[1:36:58] and so
[1:36:59] marriage and the intimacy that goes with
[1:37:02] marriage is used
[1:37:05] in a very significant and profound way
[1:37:09] to express
[1:37:11] his desire
[1:37:13] the bridegroom's desire
[1:37:16] to have intimate fellowship with us
[1:37:19] i preached many years ago because there
[1:37:22] were those who believed that they would
[1:37:24] go into that place
[1:37:26] with brother branham
[1:37:28] and with brother branham they would meet
[1:37:30] the lord
[1:37:32] i'm not talking about in that great day
[1:37:35] when the bride of every age is gathered
[1:37:37] with the messenger of that age and we
[1:37:40] stand in the presence of the lord that
[1:37:42] day will surely come
[1:37:43] but many were preaching all kinds of
[1:37:46] things and they still do today and they
[1:37:49] were saying that we have no right
[1:37:53] on our own to come in to that personal
[1:37:57] intimate private place with the
[1:37:59] bridegroom unless we're escorted there
[1:38:02] let me tell you something in the customs
[1:38:05] of the far east
[1:38:06] there was a friend of the bridegroom
[1:38:09] who worked and labored to get everything
[1:38:13] the bridegroom needed
[1:38:15] everything the bride needed he acted as
[1:38:18] a go-between
[1:38:20] stay with me a moment
[1:38:22] tending to
[1:38:24] things that the bride might need and to
[1:38:26] the bridegroom and he led them together
[1:38:30] into
[1:38:31] that tent
[1:38:32] of intimacy
[1:38:34] where this
[1:38:36] vow and relationship would be
[1:38:38] consummated
[1:38:40] but i want you to know his work was done
[1:38:46] i preached this message around the world
[1:38:48] two's company
[1:38:52] three's a crowd
[1:38:57] you're welcome in my living room
[1:39:00] when you let me know you're coming
[1:39:03] you're welcome in my kitchen
[1:39:06] in my dining room
[1:39:08] but
[1:39:09] there just ain't nothing for you in my
[1:39:10] bedroom
[1:39:14] i'm gonna have to be really sick
[1:39:17] to even let you in there to pray for me
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:21] that is not a family room
[1:39:24] although there are those times
[1:39:27] when the family's young
[1:39:29] and the children are little
[1:39:31] that mom and daddy's bed becomes the
[1:39:33] gathering joint
[1:39:36] but there's a time for the wee ones to
[1:39:38] go out
[1:39:41] you can help me
[1:39:42] you can really help me we're adults
[1:39:44] we're big folks around here
[1:39:46] there's a time for the little ones to go
[1:39:48] out it's time for them to go to bed
[1:39:51] there is a fellowship and the communion
[1:39:54] and an intimacy that takes place that
[1:39:57] the children are not invited to because
[1:39:59] two's accompany three's a crown
[1:40:02] now i have been responsible for
[1:40:05] introducing a few couples
[1:40:08] and watching god take their relationship
[1:40:11] to an awesome place
[1:40:14] in many times i have been a witness to
[1:40:16] the vows that they make to one another
[1:40:19] and that gives them a special place in
[1:40:22] my heart and i i hope and trust that i
[1:40:25] have a special place in their heart for
[1:40:27] the little bit of role i played in
[1:40:29] making sure they met one another to see
[1:40:31] what god was going to do i'm not much of
[1:40:34] a matchmaker
[1:40:36] but in in on occasion
[1:40:39] i i have done that i have been invited
[1:40:42] to the wedding
[1:40:45] why why why come on folks you know where
[1:40:47] we're going so why don't you come with
[1:40:49] me they've invited me to the wedding
[1:40:53] they've invited me to the reception
[1:40:58] but to this day
[1:41:00] i've only been invited to one honeymoon
[1:41:05] other than my own
[1:41:07] in my whole life
[1:41:11] and that was a man
[1:41:13] who was a widower
[1:41:15] and he was marrying again
[1:41:17] bob jones and he was nearly 80 years old
[1:41:21] and he invited us to come along
[1:41:23] and have fellowship together around the
[1:41:25] word
[1:41:27] on his honeymoon
[1:41:33] there'd be plenty of time
[1:41:35] for us to fellowship around the word
[1:41:38] that's the only other time i've ever
[1:41:40] been invited on anybody else's honeymoon
[1:41:44] i told jenna i'm coming
[1:41:51] she said come on
[1:41:54] i said yeah i think we should we'll be
[1:41:56] on the other side of the pool just
[1:41:58] kidding
[1:42:00] on the other side of the resort and
[1:42:01] you'll be on that side
[1:42:04] and we only have
[1:42:08] we can wave at each other across the
[1:42:10] water
[1:42:14] she said well come on
[1:42:17] you know why she can so readily invite
[1:42:19] me
[1:42:21] because she knows i'm not coming
[1:42:28] there's a time for
[1:42:32] brotherhood
[1:42:34] and there's a time to be alone
[1:42:38] and i want you to know something
[1:42:41] there is a transition that revelation
[1:42:43] talks about
[1:42:45] from bride to wife
[1:42:48] and the bride doesn't become a wife at a
[1:42:51] big reception
[1:42:54] she doesn't become a wife at the wedding
[1:42:56] supper
[1:42:58] she becomes a wife in the nuptial
[1:43:01] chamber
[1:43:03] where the marriage is consummated i want
[1:43:05] you to know
[1:43:06] that it was required in bible times i've
[1:43:10] laid this out
[1:43:11] and you know what i'm talking about it
[1:43:13] was required in bible times and i know
[1:43:16] it's a little sticky and plain but but
[1:43:19] this is the way we work we don't have
[1:43:20] children's church so i'll be careful how
[1:43:22] i say things
[1:43:25] but in case a man should grow tired of
[1:43:29] his wife
[1:43:31] and decide i'm going to put her away
[1:43:33] and take another
[1:43:37] say for instance use
[1:43:40] the only biblical excuse
[1:43:44] of saying she was not a virgin when i
[1:43:46] married her
[1:43:48] and now i
[1:43:50] want to take up my legal right
[1:43:53] give her a bill of divorcement
[1:43:56] and take on another wife
[1:44:00] this could happen
[1:44:02] randomly in the in the house of israel
[1:44:06] and so a law was established not by
[1:44:09] moses
[1:44:11] a law was established by god
[1:44:15] the token
[1:44:17] of her purity the token of her virginity
[1:44:20] king james calls it
[1:44:23] the bed sheet
[1:44:25] of her intimacy listen
[1:44:28] was preserved
[1:44:31] and in fact it was tradition
[1:44:34] that it would be handed off
[1:44:36] to the father of the bride
[1:44:41] he would take this sheet read it
[1:44:44] if i hadn't already laid it out for you
[1:44:47] multiple times through the years with
[1:44:49] scripture i wouldn't i wouldn't condense
[1:44:51] it this morning but it's there you can
[1:44:53] get it
[1:44:56] she would
[1:44:57] hand that off
[1:44:59] it is said in tradition that
[1:45:01] the father would come and that this
[1:45:04] this token of her purity
[1:45:06] would be handed out
[1:45:08] and folded up
[1:45:11] and preserved and this happened for
[1:45:13] generations
[1:45:16] generations
[1:45:17] in fact i stood as i've told you before
[1:45:20] in the museum in in uh jerusalem
[1:45:24] the israeli museum and i visited some of
[1:45:27] the judaica
[1:45:29] of old
[1:45:31] from the different nations of of the
[1:45:33] disbursing of the jews
[1:45:36] and i've seen their different traditions
[1:45:39] in in yemen and iran and iraq and other
[1:45:42] places where the jews were scattered
[1:45:45] and in in
[1:45:46] yemen
[1:45:48] the jews would make a very elaborate
[1:45:52] tapestry bag
[1:45:55] very heavily embroidered and decorated
[1:46:00] and a beautiful piece of judaica
[1:46:04] and in that bag would be the proof
[1:46:08] that this girl was a virgin
[1:46:12] when she knew her husband for the first
[1:46:14] time
[1:46:16] the father of the bride would tuck that
[1:46:18] away
[1:46:20] so that if there ever came a time
[1:46:22] anybody listening
[1:46:24] if there ever came a time
[1:46:26] that this young man should just bring
[1:46:29] any random accusation against this wife
[1:46:33] and say of her she was not pure she lied
[1:46:36] to me she deceived me and so i'm going
[1:46:39] to exercise my legal right under the law
[1:46:41] of moses to put her away
[1:46:45] and marry another
[1:46:47] whoo
[1:46:52] not so says the father of the bride
[1:46:57] he would go dig in the trunk
[1:47:00] he would find the bag
[1:47:03] that contained the scripture says the
[1:47:06] tolkiens of her virginity
[1:47:09] this was proof
[1:47:12] that she was with her bridegroom as a
[1:47:15] virgin
[1:47:17] this was proof oh i'm preaching anyhow i
[1:47:20] wish somebody would listen
[1:47:25] this was proof
[1:47:27] that they didn't hold hands all night
[1:47:32] i'm gonna have to do some
[1:47:35] biology teaching here i see
[1:47:39] they didn't just sit and stare at each
[1:47:41] other all night
[1:47:43] rub each other's hand come on we're
[1:47:45] grown
[1:47:47] we're big and let me tell you something
[1:47:48] if you've got a problem with what i'm
[1:47:50] saying and you your children down
[1:47:51] in front of the idiot box
[1:47:54] where you have no control over what they
[1:47:56] see don't you come and say i was too
[1:47:58] x-rated in a message like this you've
[1:48:01] got to be kidding me
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:03] i'm being very careful
[1:48:05] i'm being careful because i want you to
[1:48:07] know that all the hooping and the
[1:48:09] hollering and the jumping and the
[1:48:10] dancing is for a reason
[1:48:13] it brings us into a atmosphere that
[1:48:17] leads to worship
[1:48:19] these things are praise and we praise
[1:48:23] until the presence of the lord is
[1:48:26] ushered in
[1:48:28] then we begin to worship him
[1:48:31] in spirit and in truth and it is a more
[1:48:35] intimate and closer communion where
[1:48:38] sometimes in worship you don't even move
[1:48:45] you don't raise your voice
[1:48:46] you might
[1:48:50] you don't have that right if you didn't
[1:48:51] praise your way in
[1:48:54] because the bible tells us how we go in
[1:48:56] we go in praising him we enter into his
[1:48:59] courts with praise and thanksgiving
[1:49:01] that's how you get in
[1:49:02] if you try to get in any other way
[1:49:04] you're illegal
[1:49:06] you've got to go in with praise but when
[1:49:08] the shekinah or the kavod the heavy
[1:49:12] glory of the lord begins to fall
[1:49:15] as he desires to fall among us
[1:49:17] then i tell you it just soothes
[1:49:20] everything in most cases i've seen some
[1:49:22] boisterous worship i have
[1:49:25] i have
[1:49:27] but in most cases it just brings
[1:49:29] everything down
[1:49:30] to another level
[1:49:32] the kind of worship i'm talking about is
[1:49:34] rarely takes place on a sunday morning
[1:49:36] or a tuesday night
[1:49:38] the kind of worship i'm talking about is
[1:49:40] your worship your daily encounter
[1:49:44] with jesus christ
[1:49:45] i'm talking about a day-to-day
[1:49:47] relationship with him i'm not just
[1:49:50] talking about doing it because everybody
[1:49:51] else is doing it i'm talking about
[1:49:53] getting up on a monday and worse
[1:49:55] praising him
[1:49:58] somebody said i go to go to work praise
[1:50:00] him all the way.
[1:50:03] come on
[1:50:05] i gotta comb my hair praise him while
[1:50:07] you're combing your hair when you get
[1:50:10] home in the evening instead of sitting
[1:50:12] down in front of youtube
[1:50:17] catching up with your latest episode of
[1:50:19] your favorite sitcom
[1:50:22] i know you wouldn't do it on tv but you
[1:50:24] know i'm talking about hulu and
[1:50:28] peacock and
[1:50:31] i'm trying to think uh
[1:50:32] netflix and
[1:50:36] you can pick and choose
[1:50:38] but instead of doing that as a habit
[1:50:42] and always sitting around it to eat your
[1:50:45] meals
[1:50:47] make up your mind i'm going to spend
[1:50:50] just one hour
[1:50:52] because if you can't last an hour god
[1:50:54] understands you
[1:50:56] but you can practice your way that's
[1:50:58] right it's a discipline it's an exercise
[1:51:03] prayer the same way you get down to pray
[1:51:06] you think while you're walking around
[1:51:07] you think you've got so many needs
[1:51:09] you'll never get them all prayed out you
[1:51:11] get down to pray
[1:51:14] and you run out in ten minutes
[1:51:16] so what do you do you make you a list
[1:51:18] you find ways to discipline your life
[1:51:22] so that you spend more time excuse me so
[1:51:24] that you spend more time in prayer i
[1:51:26] believe praise and worship is the same
[1:51:28] way i don't believe that most intimacy
[1:51:31] with christ takes place in the church
[1:51:32] house i believe that most real
[1:51:35] relationship with him that that happens
[1:51:38] on the other side of the veil
[1:51:40] is in your private life
[1:51:42] and i encourage every one of you to get
[1:51:43] rid of things that you need to get rid
[1:51:45] of to make more time
[1:51:47] or discipline yourself if that's how you
[1:51:49] need to do it so that you can make more
[1:51:51] time i'm telling you it'll make all the
[1:51:54] difference in the world it's in that
[1:51:56] realm of intimacy that revelation begins
[1:51:58] to flow
[1:52:00] your identity begins to change
[1:52:04] and you begin to realize you're not just
[1:52:06] engaged to the bridegroom but he has
[1:52:08] claimed you as his own
[1:52:12] and he desires to know you as no one has
[1:52:15] ever known you
[1:52:17] because your heart responds by desiring
[1:52:20] to know him
[1:52:22] in a way that you've never known him
[1:52:25] is anybody all right
[1:52:27] you see there's coming an hour that
[1:52:29] we're not going to be able to fake it
[1:52:31] till we make it
[1:52:34] there's going to be an hour
[1:52:37] that we have to go all the way in
[1:52:42] hallelujah help me
[1:52:45] my reinforcements are here
[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:54] praise god
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:59] i thought you was coming tomorrow
[1:53:07] hallelujah
[1:53:09] now watch you get excited
[1:53:11] i hope you will
[1:53:13] there's coming an hour that will not be
[1:53:15] able to fake it till we make it
[1:53:18] we will have to come out of that secret
[1:53:21] place
[1:53:22] with proof
[1:53:24] with evidence
[1:53:26] that we have been
[1:53:29] with the lord
[1:53:33] you can't lie there with him
[1:53:36] and come out the same old same old
[1:53:40] same old
[1:53:42] same old
[1:53:44] you can't lay there with him
[1:53:46] and come out holding on to the things
[1:53:50] that weary you
[1:53:52] and worry you outside
[1:53:55] that bridal chamber
[1:53:58] you've got to be willing to lay all of
[1:54:00] that aside and sometimes we can't do it
[1:54:04] by ourself
[1:54:09] there's nothing like the ecstasy
[1:54:12] of knowing that you belong
[1:54:15] fully
[1:54:20] to him
[1:54:23] now i don't know i think i've got a
[1:54:24] little courage now to be a little more
[1:54:26] plain
[1:54:27] so i'll go ahead and finish this
[1:54:30] inside that place
[1:54:33] there's no hiding
[1:54:35] you know uh
[1:54:37] td jakes
[1:54:38] years ago wrote a book
[1:54:40] when i had a little bookstore
[1:54:43] naked and not ashamed
[1:54:45] i that's hung in my mind
[1:54:48] i know it sounds kind of plain
[1:54:51] but it's hung in my mind
[1:54:53] because you may not believe this or not
[1:54:55] but i remember
[1:54:56] i remember 25 years ago
[1:55:00] when there was no hiding from my wife
[1:55:05] she was going to know everything there
[1:55:07] was to know about me
[1:55:09] she was going to see me as i really am
[1:55:13] and i was going to see is that too much
[1:55:16] i wish somebody would shake your head at
[1:55:18] me like i've gotten vulgar here
[1:55:26] i was going to know every freckle
[1:55:31] i was going to know every birthmark
[1:55:35] on my wife and she was going to know the
[1:55:37] same of me
[1:55:38] come on
[1:55:40] and there comes a moment in that
[1:55:42] innocency
[1:55:44] where all that's raging through your
[1:55:46] head
[1:55:47] you've gone through the courtship period
[1:55:49] you've tried to be careful about how you
[1:55:51] would brush each other or touch each
[1:55:54] other or move around each other you've
[1:55:56] tried to wear your best and do your best
[1:55:58] and be on your best behavior
[1:56:01] you've tried not to burp
[1:56:10] you've tried not to chew your food too
[1:56:13] loudly
[1:56:17] but the time of pretense
[1:56:20] and and all that whatever it is
[1:56:24] it comes to an end
[1:56:29] it is the same
[1:56:31] with god
[1:56:33] you've never been in his real presence
[1:56:36] until
[1:56:38] you've gone in and you didn't care
[1:56:41] that he sees
[1:56:42] everything there is about you
[1:56:48] nothing is hidden from his eyes
[1:56:51] oh but josh here's the good part son
[1:56:54] he doesn't run us out because he sees a
[1:56:57] birthmark
[1:57:01] he doesn't run us out because he sees
[1:57:04] we're carrying something a little bit
[1:57:05] heavy struggling with a certain issue
[1:57:10] he longs to have fellowship
[1:57:15] communion and intimacy
[1:57:18] with you
[1:57:21] the transition between bride to wife
[1:57:26] doesn't take place
[1:57:28] in public
[1:57:32] it takes place in a private chamber
[1:57:38] brother peter we used to sing this song
[1:57:40] i don't know if you've ever heard it or
[1:57:41] not
[1:57:43] but it actually came to us years ago
[1:57:46] through circles of people that you're
[1:57:48] familiar with
[1:57:49] and i don't know if you ever heard it or
[1:57:51] not
[1:57:52] but it said into
[1:57:54] thy chamber
[1:57:58] be free
[1:57:59] holy
[1:58:01] spirit
[1:58:04] speak to
[1:58:06] me gently
[1:58:09] as i
[1:58:10] close the door
[1:58:15] heavenly lover
[1:58:19] let thy
[1:58:20] presence
[1:58:22] cover
[1:58:24] she kind of
[1:58:27] unending
[1:58:30] is all i
[1:58:33] long for
[1:58:36] they used to sing that around some of
[1:58:38] the meetings of of freeman
[1:58:40] hobart freeman many years ago
[1:58:44] while on this pathway
[1:58:46] the wine press grows heavy
[1:58:50] but it's bringing forth only
[1:58:53] the best of the wine
[1:58:56] so i press toward the mark for the prize
[1:58:59] of high calling
[1:59:01] to be a part of this beautiful lady
[1:59:04] the bride
[1:59:06] into thy chamber be free holy spirit
[1:59:10] speak to me gently as i close the door
[1:59:15] heavenly lover let thy presence cover
[1:59:18] shekinah unending
[1:59:20] is all i long for
[1:59:24] it's in that place
[1:59:27] that all the praise
[1:59:30] is worth it
[1:59:33] it's in that place that all of ishmael's
[1:59:36] mocking
[1:59:38] becomes worth it
[1:59:41] when you know listen church when you
[1:59:43] know that you are fully known
[1:59:47] and yet fully loved
[1:59:52] every hitch
[1:59:54] every limp
[1:59:56] every hiccup
[1:59:59] and yet he loves you
[2:00:02] and longs to have fellowship
[2:00:06] with you
[2:00:09] now does the latest movie sound more
[2:00:12] appealing than that
[2:00:15] is there anything this world could give
[2:00:18] us
[2:00:20] that could cause us
[2:00:23] to feel in that moment so loved
[2:00:28] so beloved
[2:00:31] so valued
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:34] so accepted
[2:00:39] oh jesus
[2:00:41] nothing brother
[2:00:45] the joy of
[2:00:47] that little baby
[2:00:49] the joy of this little one we held last
[2:00:52] sunday oh there's nothing like it
[2:00:59] the sound of those
[2:01:02] little shoes coming down that hall when
[2:01:04] ezekiel comes
[2:01:06] followed by his sister and cousins
[2:01:14] oh
[2:01:15] what a joy
[2:01:19] when i'm holding little ezekiel and he
[2:01:22] and i'm tired my
[2:01:24] sciatica i feel some and i i go to hand
[2:01:26] him off and he doesn't want to go
[2:01:34] i've literally gone home and taken
[2:01:35] another advil
[2:01:38] just to be able to hold him a little
[2:01:39] while longer
[2:01:42] there's nothing like that
[2:01:44] you that have grandchildren of your own
[2:01:47] i remember all four of our children when
[2:01:50] they were born
[2:01:52] the look
[2:01:55] they depend on you for everything
[2:01:58] and you love that
[2:02:01] you do
[2:02:04] till they get old enough to talk
[2:02:09] then you'd lock the vigor away brother
[2:02:10] man to put them back where they come
[2:02:12] from
[2:02:14] but it's part of the process
[2:02:18] oh the look
[2:02:20] i remember it well 25 years ago this
[2:02:23] november
[2:02:24] when i looked down the long aisle of
[2:02:26] that church in columbus
[2:02:28] and i saw my beautiful bride
[2:02:31] in that beautiful wedding gown that i
[2:02:33] had seen in a vision
[2:02:35] the very same gown that god had showed
[2:02:37] me in the spirit
[2:02:39] and i saw her standing there not even a
[2:02:42] hundred pounds
[2:02:44] beauty that had nothing to do with her
[2:02:46] beauty
[2:02:47] she needed to eat
[2:02:51] i took care of that in a hurry
[2:02:54] we had onion rings on our honeymoon
[2:02:58] and i said you're gonna have to meet up
[2:02:59] a little i'm going to get some more meat
[2:03:01] on your bones
[2:03:02] we're going to look like the odd couple
[2:03:04] forever if we don't and
[2:03:07] it took my breath
[2:03:11] i wish that i could have frozen that
[2:03:13] moment in time
[2:03:15] i can watch it on the video and feel a
[2:03:18] little of it but nothing
[2:03:20] can
[2:03:20] can really bring that back as powerful
[2:03:23] as it was in that moment every feeling
[2:03:26] every feeling cutting the cord
[2:03:29] for my boys
[2:03:32] standing over them on the eighth day
[2:03:35] and seeing them circumcised
[2:03:38] these were moments in our life
[2:03:42] benjamin was the firstborn and we
[2:03:44] redeemed him with silver coins
[2:03:46] we did it just like it was done in the
[2:03:48] bible as the firstborn
[2:03:50] these moments of our lives that we we
[2:03:53] treasure
[2:03:55] but there is nothing
[2:03:58] no feeling no emotion no memory
[2:04:02] nothing can compare
[2:04:05] with the ecstasy of the moment
[2:04:09] in knowing that he knows every rotten
[2:04:12] thing about me
[2:04:13] and yet he desires to take me as his
[2:04:17] bride
[2:04:19] and transition me
[2:04:22] from bride to wife
[2:04:27] it's more than an engagement
[2:04:31] it's more than an espousal
[2:04:37] there was an exception
[2:04:39] to the tokens of virginity
[2:04:42] in the bible
[2:04:47] if a husband knew
[2:04:50] by confession
[2:04:52] as long as he was not a priest
[2:04:56] who ministered before the lord
[2:05:00] if that woman should come to him
[2:05:02] and confess to him
[2:05:05] her
[2:05:06] condition
[2:05:09] in a moment of passion
[2:05:13] i gave away what is yours
[2:05:16] i gave away my purity i gave away my
[2:05:18] virginity
[2:05:21] and i am unclean
[2:05:24] and you have every right
[2:05:26] to seek another
[2:05:30] i have to tell you now and i want to
[2:05:31] tell you something i pray nobody is
[2:05:34] faced with a decision like this but i'm
[2:05:36] telling you right now as god's children
[2:05:38] as true believers of this message you
[2:05:41] young ladies must
[2:05:43] must be honest
[2:05:47] you must be honest to that young man
[2:05:50] you young men must be honest
[2:05:56] you're not sitting in a in a
[2:05:58] mankind woman can't church this morning
[2:06:03] so you need to know the whole plan
[2:06:06] you need to also be honest
[2:06:09] you need to let her know if she loves
[2:06:10] you less she didn't love you
[2:06:12] if you love her less you didn't love her
[2:06:17] you better lay out
[2:06:19] your life you better know your call
[2:06:23] you better know what you're what you're
[2:06:25] here for
[2:06:27] but if that young man should say darling
[2:06:30] with all i'm sorry you're not a darling
[2:06:39] darling
[2:06:41] with all my heart
[2:06:43] it breaks my heart
[2:06:46] to know
[2:06:48] it doesn't make me feel good
[2:06:51] to know
[2:06:52] that someone else
[2:06:54] has had their way with you
[2:06:57] that's too plain i'm sorry
[2:06:59] but i love you
[2:07:01] like adam loved ever
[2:07:14] you know you get real
[2:07:18] i know i'm not screaming i hope you hear
[2:07:20] me
[2:07:21] you look real careful the hebrew
[2:07:23] language and you will wonder
[2:07:25] if it really means what it says
[2:07:27] because it teaches us in hebrew while
[2:07:29] adam stood by
[2:07:33] and the hebrew is so powerful
[2:07:36] it looks like he saw the whole thing
[2:07:43] fear i don't know
[2:07:46] what kept him from chopping that beast
[2:07:48] head off
[2:07:49] i don't know
[2:07:51] but if you look at the original language
[2:07:54] in fact certain sects of judaism believe
[2:07:58] original sin the way you and i believe
[2:08:01] and they will tell you that from the
[2:08:03] hebrew it appears
[2:08:05] that adam hid his face in blush
[2:08:08] but he was well aware
[2:08:10] of what was taking place
[2:08:12] and yet he loved her
[2:08:15] oh yeah but you say he tried to throw
[2:08:17] her under the bus you would have too
[2:08:19] in the presence of that almighty god
[2:08:23] you'd have heard his voice and you to
[2:08:25] blame the woman too
[2:08:28] don't get mad at him
[2:08:30] because the bible said he made a choice
[2:08:33] we understand through the new testament
[2:08:36] that adam was not deceived
[2:08:39] but eve was the one deceived
[2:08:42] therefore the guilt of that
[2:08:44] transgression hung on her
[2:08:47] and instead of adam driving her away
[2:08:51] and doing like message folks today
[2:08:54] i'll find me another one
[2:08:58] when amen too loud they may hear you
[2:09:02] your mind i accept my responsibility in
[2:09:06] all of this and you are mine and i love
[2:09:08] you and i want you to be mine and the
[2:09:10] bible said adam knew his wife eve
[2:09:15] he didn't reject her his dirty trash he
[2:09:18] took her in as husband
[2:09:21] and oh there came another adam one day
[2:09:23] is anybody here there came another adam
[2:09:26] one day that knew everything there was
[2:09:28] to know about you
[2:09:34] knew everything there was to know about
[2:09:36] me
[2:09:37] and yet he said i want you your mind
[2:09:40] my grace my blood my love is sufficient
[2:09:49] so you can't tell me
[2:09:51] that intimacy
[2:09:53] is not a biblical paradigm
[2:09:56] for a relationship
[2:09:58] he could have chosen all kinds of
[2:10:00] paradigms but he chose the bridal
[2:10:02] paradigm and he chose to parallel it
[2:10:04] with the sonship
[2:10:06] adoption paradigm so that we could all
[2:10:09] get the whole picture here
[2:10:15] and what i i this none of this is in my
[2:10:17] notes
[2:10:18] i had no idea of going toward the tokens
[2:10:21] of virginity this morning
[2:10:23] but i will tell you this
[2:10:25] we can only fake it so long
[2:10:30] we're coming to such a critical hour
[2:10:33] that we will have to be able to display
[2:10:36] the token
[2:10:41] it has to be
[2:10:43] so that when the death angel passes by
[2:10:47] he knows those
[2:10:49] just give you what the scripture said
[2:10:52] you see the bible talks about the
[2:10:53] marking angels of the last days who come
[2:10:56] and mark those
[2:10:58] who are sighing and crying for the
[2:11:00] abomination that takes place in the land
[2:11:03] and they're sighing and crying for the
[2:11:05] coming of messiah for the coming of
[2:11:08] sweet deliverance and they are marked to
[2:11:11] be protected by god
[2:11:13] in perilous times
[2:11:16] you hear brother branham saying this is
[2:11:17] not a picnic
[2:11:21] this is not a playground
[2:11:23] this is a battlefield
[2:11:25] and we've got to stand up quit ye like
[2:11:28] men and fight this good
[2:11:31] fight
[2:11:32] [Applause]
[2:11:37] i just wanted to give you this not
[2:11:39] knowing i was going to because i don't
[2:11:41] want you to think that i am so
[2:11:43] uh elementary
[2:11:46] that i think everything is about praise
[2:11:50] or everything is about noise
[2:11:53] or everything is about manifestation in
[2:11:56] fact i think all things are about
[2:11:57] balance
[2:12:02] i think the hardest thing that any man
[2:12:04] ever did was keep his head above
[2:12:07] the fanaticism that surrounds his
[2:12:09] message
[2:12:11] the middle of the road is the most
[2:12:13] lonely place to walk
[2:12:17] brother branham said to my friend
[2:12:18] brother perry greene whatever you do
[2:12:20] brother perry
[2:12:22] keep your balance
[2:12:25] he didn't say in the quotes
[2:12:28] he said keep your balance in the
[2:12:33] scriptures
[2:12:36] what did brother branham tell us you
[2:12:38] take everything don't just take my word
[2:12:40] for it
[2:12:41] did he really say those words he
[2:12:42] absolutely did don't just take my word
[2:12:44] for it you take it right back to the
[2:12:46] word well everybody says it fits how do
[2:12:49] you know
[2:12:51] if you don't ever crack the black back
[2:12:53] book how do you know if it lines up or
[2:12:55] not
[2:12:59] a friend of mine lost his old aged dad
[2:13:02] 87 years old this week
[2:13:05] and he said the greatest legacy
[2:13:08] that my father left me
[2:13:12] was the fact
[2:13:13] that he has documentation from his own
[2:13:16] family and friends
[2:13:18] that he read the bible 67 times all the
[2:13:23] way through
[2:13:28] you don't think that means something
[2:13:30] it means something
[2:13:33] we've got a modern church that don't
[2:13:34] want to read the bible
[2:13:36] the only scriptures they get is twice or
[2:13:38] three times a week when they come to
[2:13:40] church or a verse or two on an app
[2:13:42] somewhere but they don't pour themselves
[2:13:45] into that word knowing it's the only
[2:13:46] thing that can transform us
[2:13:49] and here's an old man that doesn't even
[2:13:50] know the power of pentecost like you and
[2:13:52] i but dedicated his life as a young man
[2:13:55] to read the bible through and did it 67
[2:13:57] out of his 87 years 67 times out of his
[2:14:00] 87 years what a legacy to leave your
[2:14:02] children because that was always coming
[2:14:04] out of him
[2:14:05] his son said every time he opened his
[2:14:07] mouth it was coming out of him he
[2:14:09] possibly of course he couldn't remember
[2:14:11] at all but things would come and
[2:14:13] situations would come and he'd say i was
[2:14:15] reading that here let me show you
[2:14:18] here let me take you back to what the
[2:14:19] word said how many of you know we're
[2:14:22] going to have to have some of that in
[2:14:23] this hour
[2:14:24] so please understand i believe in praise
[2:14:27] i believe in lifting your voice i
[2:14:29] believe in running the aisle i believe
[2:14:31] in dancing i believe in shouting i
[2:14:33] believe in rejoicing i do not believe
[2:14:36] the order has changed for biblical
[2:14:38] worship
[2:14:39] [Applause]
[2:14:40] i don't
[2:14:42] i don't
[2:14:46] i believe if david said shout unto the
[2:14:48] lord
[2:14:49] i ought to be shouting unto the lord
[2:14:52] it's god's sacred word i believe that
[2:14:54] the bible said praise the lord in the
[2:14:56] dance
[2:14:59] i ought to get off of my pride
[2:15:04] if a fat man can dance you skinny men
[2:15:07] ought to be able to
[2:15:11] somebody said well i'm just not made to
[2:15:13] be like that well i want you to know
[2:15:14] something brother branham didn't think
[2:15:16] he was either
[2:15:21] i read you two quotes didn't i
[2:15:23] i got one more for you to go back to
[2:15:25] dancing for just a moment we're gonna
[2:15:26] close but we're gonna be all around the
[2:15:28] world before we get there
[2:15:29] it's 111.

[2:15:50] 10 28 tucson
[2:15:52] paragraph 68.
[2:15:57] i like this kind of singing
[2:16:01] when i was back there praying for some
[2:16:02] of the people a few moments ago that had
[2:16:04] been brought in and this not being a
[2:16:06] prayer service just to speak
[2:16:09] i was in there and i could hear the
[2:16:11] songs
[2:16:15] this was
[2:16:17] october october
[2:16:21] remember i'm standing there
[2:16:23] put your finger there
[2:16:25] remember i'm standing there in
[2:16:26] louisville kentucky
[2:16:29] and brother michael who is the organ
[2:16:31] player at brother yancey's church at the
[2:16:33] time he's passed away now or the piano
[2:16:35] player
[2:16:37] at brother yancey's church he
[2:16:40] would sneak over to see us on occasion
[2:16:43] and
[2:16:45] he was a radio dj
[2:16:48] we're in louisville kentucky and we
[2:16:50] don't know
[2:16:51] uh
[2:16:52] too many there
[2:16:55] but i knew some of the old singers so
[2:16:57] much
[2:16:59] that some of the message people there
[2:17:01] would follow me around
[2:17:03] because they would want to be there when
[2:17:05] i got spoken to
[2:17:09] and i remember one time standing there
[2:17:12] and two wee little hands come up to try
[2:17:14] to cover my eyes
[2:17:17] and it didn't work too good
[2:17:20] and i turned around and it was dotty
[2:17:22] rambo
[2:17:24] and all those people that knew who
[2:17:26] dottie rambo was who'd waited on an
[2:17:28] opportunity to shake her hand they said
[2:17:30] oh brother shelley why didn't you tell
[2:17:32] us you knew dotty rambo
[2:17:36] seemed like it wasn't too long after
[2:17:38] that that
[2:17:40] i saw brother michael down on the floor
[2:17:41] and he said oh brother shelly are you
[2:17:43] having a good time i said yes it's not
[2:17:45] my first time i used to go to the
[2:17:47] quartet convention in nashville but this
[2:17:49] is my first time in louisville
[2:17:52] he said i have i have something to tell
[2:17:54] you i said what's that he said brother
[2:17:56] billy paul
[2:17:57] is up there in the about in the in one
[2:17:59] of the upper levels
[2:18:01] and he said he has asked
[2:18:03] me to see if i could find you he wants
[2:18:05] to meet you
[2:18:07] and he wants to thank you for the
[2:18:10] cassettes that you sent
[2:18:12] as gifts remember the ones i told you
[2:18:14] about last sunday the holy ghost was set
[2:18:16] your feet and anson
[2:18:18] i had just bought an old album i know
[2:18:20] you've heard it hear it again
[2:18:22] just bought an old album from the happy
[2:18:24] goodman family down on the floor and it
[2:18:27] was in a clear bag
[2:18:28] and i grabbed my mother and i said let's
[2:18:30] go with this is our chance to meet
[2:18:32] brother billy paul he's here and he
[2:18:34] wants to say hi
[2:18:36] and so we went up and we waited out in
[2:18:38] the wing and brother michael went up
[2:18:40] through the
[2:18:41] through the tunnel there and went up and
[2:18:43] here come brother billy paul and sister
[2:18:45] lois branham my first time meeting them
[2:18:49] and he came down and we greeted one
[2:18:51] another and hugged one another and we
[2:18:53] started talking about the old singing
[2:18:56] he looked down in my clear bag and he
[2:18:59] said oh the happy goodman family
[2:19:02] and and i just handed it to him i said
[2:19:04] brother billy paul would you like to
[2:19:06] have this album he said i wouldn't have
[2:19:08] any way of playing it
[2:19:10] but he said i remember that
[2:19:12] he said they were my daddy's favorite
[2:19:14] singers
[2:19:22] i thought about all the message people
[2:19:24] that used to mock them and say oh
[2:19:26] there's such showman
[2:19:29] they put on such a show
[2:19:32] you see how you can get critical when
[2:19:33] you don't know what you think you know
[2:19:37] and then he told me something that blew
[2:19:38] me away
[2:19:39] he said in fact two different times they
[2:19:42] sung for daddy at the branham tabernacle
[2:19:49] i said they did he said yeah he said i
[2:19:51] can't remember what tape but he said
[2:19:52] that that's what he said
[2:19:55] god forgive me i hope i'm not
[2:19:56] disrespecting him
[2:19:59] he looked right at me and he said but
[2:20:00] that brother shelley has long time been
[2:20:05] cut off the tape
[2:20:10] and he winked at me three times
[2:20:16] but he said if you if you find it he
[2:20:18] said maybe i could tell you sometimes
[2:20:20] what table was but he said daddy comes
[2:20:22] to the you're the pulpit and he said you
[2:20:24] would think that he was bragging on
[2:20:26] morris youngren or
[2:20:28] or or someone else some of the other
[2:20:30] singers that he loved to hear so well
[2:20:32] because he comes and he says now that
[2:20:35] is my kind of gospel singing
[2:20:38] what we've just heard he said that
[2:20:40] wasn't brother ungren singing down from
[2:20:42] his glory that was howard and vestal
[2:20:44] goodman singing i wouldn't take nothing
[2:20:45] for my journey now
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:48] why are you mentioning that because
[2:20:52] i know churches it wouldn't even let
[2:20:54] nobody sing that song in their church
[2:20:57] today way too peppy
[2:21:03] way too many words way too much tempo
[2:21:06] but he liked that
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:11] why are you saying that because i think
[2:21:12] you need to know that because of what
[2:21:14] i'm fixing to say
[2:21:16] he said this not being a prayer service
[2:21:18] just to speak i was in there i could
[2:21:20] hear the song the clapping of their
[2:21:22] hands
[2:21:25] and we wonder and some of them even i
[2:21:27] seen them
[2:21:29] run up and down the floor what they call
[2:21:32] dancing in the spirit
[2:21:35] oh my
[2:21:37] we'd better not let the deacons and
[2:21:39] trustees see that
[2:21:42] at first time i was a critic of that
[2:21:46] when i seen the pentecostal people
[2:21:48] dancing in the spirit and i thought what
[2:21:51] is this it must be a bunch of nonsense
[2:21:54] look what the solution was
[2:21:57] he's not indicating that there's any
[2:21:59] change of worship from old testament to
[2:22:01] new testament
[2:22:03] he's not indicating that there's any
[2:22:04] change of worship from new testament to
[2:22:07] the restored word
[2:22:10] he said what is this it must be a bunch
[2:22:11] of nonsense then i got to doing what
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:16] he didn't wait on a preacher to
[2:22:17] vindicate it
[2:22:18] he said i got to read in the bible
[2:22:21] whoa and i found out are you still here
[2:22:24] and i found out that when dancing in the
[2:22:26] spirit
[2:22:27] the devil copied it
[2:22:36] counterfeit not a creator
[2:22:38] he's only a perverter
[2:22:41] he said the devil copied it and put them
[2:22:42] out here with rock and roll and stuff
[2:22:44] but the real genuine dance
[2:22:47] [Applause]
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:48] [Applause]
[2:22:50] come from god
[2:22:53] now brother shelly the bible didn't say
[2:22:55] that miriam felt the spirit he just said
[2:22:56] she picked up the tambourine and began
[2:22:58] to dance that's what it said
[2:23:00] and the spirit fell on her
[2:23:02] in the spirit of prophecy fellow moses
[2:23:05] and he began to sing prophetic music
[2:23:07] over the house of israel didn't he
[2:23:09] oh hallelujah and miriam led the sisters
[2:23:12] with the tambourine and brother bannon
[2:23:14] said back and forth and up and down they
[2:23:15] went glorifying god and praising god
[2:23:18] didn't he didn't he say it
[2:23:20] he said now that's exactly and always
[2:23:24] a dance
[2:23:26] was
[2:23:28] read it
[2:23:30] victory
[2:23:32] when david slew goliath and this little
[2:23:34] ruddy looking boy came dragging the head
[2:23:36] of this giant into the city the people
[2:23:39] met him dancing
[2:23:46] you'd have been gagging
[2:23:50] you'd have been turning your head a
[2:23:52] glory but david comes dragging that big
[2:23:54] old giant's hair head by the locks of
[2:23:57] his hair his brother branham dramatizing
[2:23:59] this i like it
[2:24:01] here he come dragging the head of this
[2:24:03] giant into the city the people met him
[2:24:05] dancing why why
[2:24:08] [Applause]
[2:24:13] they had the victory
[2:24:15] glory be to god anybody here
[2:24:21] when moses crossed the red sea by the
[2:24:23] power of god took the children of israel
[2:24:25] on the other side miriam picked up a
[2:24:27] tambourine
[2:24:29] all the daughters of israel up and down
[2:24:30] the bank they went beating the
[2:24:31] tambourine and
[2:24:34] that's what he called it
[2:24:37] if that isn't an old-fashioned
[2:24:38] pentecostal meaning
[2:24:41] i never seen one in my life now just
[2:24:43] just tell me what part of that
[2:24:47] sounds like to you that brother branham
[2:24:50] was against
[2:24:51] a real expression
[2:24:54] of a genuine experience
[2:24:56] did i miss something in the reading
[2:25:01] i'm doing this not only for you but
[2:25:03] others who might come across this
[2:25:05] and i realize it becomes fodder for
[2:25:07] those who want to only mock
[2:25:09] but i think the truth has to get out
[2:25:12] i think people need to know that it's
[2:25:14] all right for people to have victory
[2:25:16] and if there's ever been an hour where
[2:25:18] we ought to have some victory it's the
[2:25:20] hour that we're living in today it must
[2:25:22] not be for show
[2:25:27] it's not a boogie woogie competition
[2:25:35] it's not for you to expose your knees
[2:25:40] it's to glorify god and demonstrate that
[2:25:44] somebody still
[2:25:47] has the victory
[2:25:50] glory glory i'm hurrying
[2:25:55] that isn't an old-fashioned pentecostal
[2:25:57] media i've never seen one in my life the
[2:25:58] trouble was with me ah
[2:26:04] i just love it when preachers are
[2:26:05] transparent
[2:26:06] and when you've got a word prophet here
[2:26:09] bringing a restored message
[2:26:11] a ministry prophesied in scripture and
[2:26:13] he comes here and is transparent before
[2:26:16] us i just love this
[2:26:18] he is confessing to us his own weakness
[2:26:20] and here is what he said the trouble was
[2:26:22] with me
[2:26:26] i didn't have enough victory
[2:26:28] but when you finally get that victory
[2:26:31] i'm not going to read it i read it last
[2:26:32] week but he said when i realized what
[2:26:35] was going on i found myself
[2:26:38] right up on the floor dancing with that
[2:26:40] little girl
[2:26:40] [Music]
[2:26:42] [Applause]
[2:26:43] i don't believe it was a dosey doe
[2:26:46] no
[2:26:47] lord i'd love to seen it
[2:26:50] a baptist prophet
[2:26:56] god taken him out of his own element
[2:26:59] a woman preacher leading the tambourine
[2:27:01] beating he said
[2:27:03] and there's brother branham
[2:27:05] right up in the middle of him clapping
[2:27:07] his hands and dancing i loved have been
[2:27:09] in that service where he got so lost in
[2:27:11] the spirit of his message that he
[2:27:13] climbed up on the pulpit
[2:27:18] i know people that saw it that were in
[2:27:20] the media well you believe that if you
[2:27:22] want to i choose to believe it
[2:27:25] he got so lost he said when i come to
[2:27:27] myself i was rolling up my britch's legs
[2:27:34] it was getting so deep in there
[2:27:38] climbed up on the pulpit sits down on
[2:27:40] the pulpit
[2:27:42] you remember what he said about the
[2:27:43] pulpit it's the most sacred place in the
[2:27:45] earth
[2:27:46] he said if i were you i would sit as
[2:27:48] close to that pulpit as i possibly could
[2:27:50] because that's a place that god comes
[2:27:52] down and meets with man
[2:27:54] isn't that what he said
[2:27:55] exactly what he said
[2:27:57] and
[2:28:10] the last time i talked to you about
[2:28:12] seven hours away
[2:28:16] girls don't y'all be embarrassed
[2:28:20] you all have known him longer than i
[2:28:21] have
[2:28:23] you just gotta love him you know what
[2:28:26] and this is a brother that's been
[2:28:28] believing this message a long long time
[2:28:31] but it reminds me
[2:28:33] of some of you and i
[2:28:37] in the olden days
[2:28:39] when we first heard brother branham say
[2:28:41] something
[2:28:43] we'd never heard it before
[2:28:45] and all of a sudden we heard him say it
[2:28:48] and that's exactly what we wanted to do
[2:28:50] because he was a prophet and because we
[2:28:52] knew that if we would honor what he said
[2:28:55] we would get the blessing
[2:28:58] so be careful
[2:29:02] nothing wrong with that
[2:29:06] he said i the trouble was with me i
[2:29:09] didn't have enough victory
[2:29:14] but when you finally get the victory
[2:29:17] [Music]
[2:29:20] and the token of
[2:29:22] the blood
[2:29:25] not the chemistry
[2:29:28] not the chemistry of the the life
[2:29:31] it's the spirit life
[2:29:34] it's the zoy life
[2:29:37] that was in the blood that provides the
[2:29:39] token for you and i today
[2:29:41] we can't go back and touch the chemistry
[2:29:44] of that blood but we carry
[2:29:47] we're carriers
[2:29:50] we're carriers of the life that is in
[2:29:53] that blood
[2:29:55] he said when you finally get the victory
[2:29:57] that victory and the token of the blood
[2:29:59] of jesus christ comes upon you
[2:30:01] he said i remember david the great
[2:30:03] psalmist of the bible when he had done
[2:30:05] something
[2:30:06] that this great thing he was given
[2:30:08] saul's daughter and she was kind of a
[2:30:13] self-starched
[2:30:15] self-styled
[2:30:17] so-called
[2:30:20] that's the king's daughter you're
[2:30:22] talking about
[2:30:24] she was message royalty
[2:30:30] the last service i was in with brother
[2:30:32] joseph's daughter
[2:30:35] if you want to talk about message
[2:30:36] royalty that would be a family that we
[2:30:38] look up to and respect
[2:30:41] the last time i was in a service with
[2:30:42] that granddaughter brother branham we
[2:30:46] were sitting down in macon georgia
[2:30:47] listening to a tape
[2:30:49] and the holy ghost you can believe it or
[2:30:50] not but the holy ghost was running
[2:30:52] through that room
[2:30:54] no no live preacher just listening to a
[2:30:56] tape
[2:30:57] but the holy ghost was running through
[2:30:58] that room and all of a sudden i heard a
[2:31:00] scream
[2:31:02] like i hadn't heard since i was a boy in
[2:31:04] pentecost
[2:31:07] i'm not going to say what they used to
[2:31:09] say it sounded like because it might be
[2:31:11] a bit disrespectful and i wouldn't mean
[2:31:12] it to be that way but it pierced every
[2:31:15] cell in my body and brother bobby looked
[2:31:17] down the road he said that's brother
[2:31:19] joseph's daughter there getting under
[2:31:21] the inspiration of the word
[2:31:24] screaming like i'd never heard or had
[2:31:27] been many many years since i'd heard
[2:31:29] anybody respond that way i got
[2:31:31] confidence in that
[2:31:33] see it's not just you that can move with
[2:31:35] the music
[2:31:39] hallelujah
[2:31:41] it's got to be more than that
[2:31:45] you've also got to be movable by the
[2:31:47] word
[2:31:49] i know there has to be orders so that
[2:31:51] everybody can hear but you've got to be
[2:31:53] able to be
[2:31:54] moved by the inspiration of the word
[2:31:58] why because if it's in genuine delivery
[2:32:02] if it's a god-given gift it comes under
[2:32:05] the same inspiration by which god spoke
[2:32:07] it in the beginning
[2:32:09] and you're sure going to want to respond
[2:32:10] to that aren't you
[2:32:12] there's only one true inspiration of the
[2:32:14] word she was kind of a self-start
[2:32:16] self-styled so-called believer and the
[2:32:19] ark had been away from god for a long
[2:32:21] time
[2:32:22] the visible presence of god the pillar
[2:32:24] of fire hanging over this ark
[2:32:27] the philistines had come in and took it
[2:32:29] out under saul's reign and one day when
[2:32:31] david seen the ark coming back to the
[2:32:34] house of god
[2:32:36] oh when i was a boy sister sandy in the
[2:32:38] in the old-fashioned assemblies of god
[2:32:40] that was before you all knew anything
[2:32:42] about the assembly of god the
[2:32:44] old-fashioned way way back and i mean
[2:32:46] that not just in years i mean in style
[2:32:49] they used to come in our church to dance
[2:32:52] they would leave their big starchy
[2:32:53] churches on on
[2:32:54] on i won't call the names of the streets
[2:32:57] they'd leave their big starchy churches
[2:32:58] to come out to granny's church made out
[2:33:00] of a hockey talk
[2:33:02] so they had freedom to do what like they
[2:33:04] wanted to do and there was one sister
[2:33:07] that would come with her husband every
[2:33:08] year from canada
[2:33:11] to get under the inspiration of those
[2:33:13] old-fashioned services and she would her
[2:33:15] husband play the guitar and she'd jump
[2:33:17] up and she would begin to sing and it's
[2:33:20] coming
[2:33:21] hallelujah
[2:33:22] the ark is coming up the road it's
[2:33:25] coming hallelujah the ark is coming up
[2:33:29] the road i do believe without a doubt
[2:33:34] the ark is coming up the road god's
[2:33:37] people have a right to shout the ark is
[2:33:41] coming up the road
[2:33:43] it's coming hallelujah
[2:33:46] the ark is coming up the road it's
[2:33:49] coming
[2:33:50] hallelujah
[2:33:52] the ark is coming up the road
[2:33:58] david danced before the lord
[2:34:01] he danced with all his might his wife
[2:34:03] despised him in her heart
[2:34:05] but the ark is coming up
[2:34:08] the road
[2:34:10] back to the quote and the ark had been
[2:34:12] gone for a long time the philistines had
[2:34:14] come in and took it out under saul's
[2:34:16] reign and one day when david seen the
[2:34:18] ark
[2:34:21] coming back to the house of god david
[2:34:23] run out
[2:34:25] before the ark
[2:34:27] and he danced before the lord singing
[2:34:29] the praises of god and i told you last
[2:34:31] week or so he stripped off all the royal
[2:34:34] regal heavy robes of of his position
[2:34:37] he danced before the lord with his inner
[2:34:40] tunic on
[2:34:41] leave your clothes on
[2:34:42] folks he danced before the lord with his
[2:34:46] inner tunic on what you and i would
[2:34:47] classify
[2:34:48] and even in that day
[2:34:50] it would have been looked at a little
[2:34:51] bit disrespectful and almost like
[2:34:53] underwear
[2:34:55] but he couldn't let those old heavy
[2:34:56] ecclesiastical robes
[2:34:58] get weighed him down when he could see
[2:35:01] that god's word
[2:35:04] wasn't even about spirit
[2:35:06] it was about word
[2:35:07] what was in that ark
[2:35:09] the tablets
[2:35:11] the word
[2:35:12] huh when he saw that the blessing and
[2:35:14] favor of god was returning to israel and
[2:35:17] writing in that heart he jumped out in
[2:35:19] front of it and he began to dance before
[2:35:21] the lord singing the praises of god
[2:35:24] and saul's daughter
[2:35:28] seemed to be very much embarrassed at
[2:35:30] that man's action
[2:35:32] her husband her young handsome husband
[2:35:34] had cut up
[2:35:38] oh david go david
[2:35:40] and misbehave himself in her presence
[2:35:44] um
[2:35:46] the king's daughter she was more
[2:35:48] concerned about her reputation than he
[2:35:49] is
[2:35:51] and david said so much if you don't like
[2:35:54] that
[2:35:54] [Laughter]
[2:35:58] if you think that was wild
[2:36:14] i told somebody like brother daniel
[2:36:17] recently on the phone could have been
[2:36:18] him
[2:36:23] i'm going to be very careful what i say
[2:36:25] i said you remind me of what my granny
[2:36:27] used to call a stall-fed calf
[2:36:33] nothing wrong with that
[2:36:35] when granny talked about it she was
[2:36:37] bragging
[2:36:38] when you get under that inspiration and
[2:36:40] you feel kind of blocked up sometime we
[2:36:43] do it to ourselves we're not blaming
[2:36:45] anybody
[2:36:46] we do it to ourselves we get blocked up
[2:36:49] and locked up we do it to ourselves how
[2:36:51] do we get there we do it to ourselves
[2:36:55] we don't want to be the loudest or
[2:36:56] something like that we do it to
[2:36:58] ourselves but granny used to say you go
[2:37:00] over there and unlock the gate
[2:37:05] you let that calf get out of that cave
[2:37:08] you've never seen such kicking up your
[2:37:10] heels in all your life she said i've
[2:37:12] seen them leave the ground
[2:37:14] she said i've seen them jump like beer
[2:37:18] kicking their
[2:37:20] front hooves in their back hooves
[2:37:22] together way up in the air like a dance
[2:37:24] so bad
[2:37:28] now if you get the whole paradigm of the
[2:37:30] whole whole uh analogy of the story
[2:37:34] they were being done a great favor
[2:37:36] because they didn't have to go out and
[2:37:37] look for their food
[2:37:39] their food was being brought to him
[2:37:41] every day in the stall
[2:37:44] of course you know why don't you
[2:37:50] here's where the other side of the story
[2:37:52] comes in
[2:37:55] feeding them getting them ready for that
[2:38:04] reading
[2:38:05] her husband her young handsome husband
[2:38:08] if you don't like that
[2:38:11] watch this a little while oh my lord i
[2:38:14] would be so bold
[2:38:16] god make me so bold
[2:38:21] you think that was wild you just wait
[2:38:23] till i get really free
[2:38:26] and around and around and around the ark
[2:38:30] he went again
[2:38:33] you wonder what the prophet thought
[2:38:35] about it
[2:38:36] he didn't call it showing off
[2:38:39] making a scene
[2:38:40] he said dancing in the spirit
[2:38:44] and she was embarrassed and god cursed
[2:38:47] that woman with a curse
[2:38:50] be careful how you despise somebody
[2:38:52] else's worship
[2:38:57] i've said this i always say the banner
[2:38:59] because it's the one thing i've heard a
[2:39:01] few people complain about through the
[2:39:02] years
[2:39:06] if waving a banner is not your
[2:39:08] thing find you a thing
[2:39:13] come on
[2:39:15] find you one find you something
[2:39:24] we've done it all
[2:39:28] we've put the
[2:39:29] perish all up
[2:39:31] which symbolizes the bridal chamber
[2:39:36] we've danced under it in here hadn't we
[2:39:39] four men holding it up there
[2:39:41] we've danced around this church we've
[2:39:43] carried the scroll which represents
[2:39:45] the whole word although written there
[2:39:47] are only the first five books of moses
[2:39:50] and we've danced around with that scroll
[2:39:54] giving honor to the word
[2:39:56] maybe that'll be your thing
[2:39:59] i got a feeling some people don't want a
[2:40:00] thing
[2:40:08] very sad
[2:40:11] everybody don't dance the same
[2:40:14] everybody don't worship just to like
[2:40:16] praise just alike
[2:40:18] i get all of that
[2:40:20] but here's something brother branham
[2:40:21] told us don't you sit back there
[2:40:24] in the seat of the scornful
[2:40:27] judge somebody else's ring
[2:40:29] brother branham actually said gone
[2:40:32] you've blasphemed
[2:40:35] now that's pretty serious business
[2:40:37] you leave somebody else's praise to that
[2:40:39] person
[2:40:42] thank you brother peter i heard you
[2:40:43] praise god see i can hear you better in
[2:40:46] person than on the stream i'm glad
[2:40:47] you're
[2:40:49] whoa
[2:40:51] oh the victory through the blood of
[2:40:53] jesus christ the token of the
[2:40:55] resurrection of christ his life lives
[2:40:58] within his church
[2:41:00] there is no other way of fellowship
[2:41:02] under but under that blood
[2:41:05] our denominations will separate us and
[2:41:07] one say that's nonsense and one say this
[2:41:10] that or the other
[2:41:12] won't they
[2:41:15] pentecost was
[2:41:21] wait a minute i got to get close to see
[2:41:22] the year
[2:41:26] 10 28
[2:41:28] 63
[2:41:30] that's a long way from march of 63.
[2:41:33] seals are preached
[2:41:35] word is open
[2:41:37] bible has become a new book
[2:41:39] and here is the prophet still telling us
[2:41:42] several months later pentecost was our
[2:41:45] pattern
[2:41:48] all gathered one mind one accord
[2:41:52] he said no one will have to say but what
[2:41:54] or can say but what the church was
[2:41:57] inaugurated
[2:41:59] on the day of pentecost
[2:42:01] which is the commemoration of shavuot
[2:42:05] the giving of the torah the giving of
[2:42:07] the law in the wilderness
[2:42:08] 50 days after the feast of first fruits
[2:42:11] what a wonderful blessing it is to know
[2:42:14] he said and the same spirit
[2:42:17] that came upon them on that day
[2:42:22] every time without fail in the bible
[2:42:27] i know you don't know why we're so
[2:42:29] excited
[2:42:30] but we don't i can't help it
[2:42:34] i'm just reliving i told you weeks ago
[2:42:36] i've been reliving some stuff
[2:42:39] i've just been reliving some things
[2:42:42] i've i've been feeling my wheaties
[2:42:46] and i remembered being a young preacher
[2:42:48] in the 90s out on the road
[2:42:51] and meeting opposition at every turn
[2:42:55] every turn
[2:42:57] we can't do that we can't do this we
[2:42:59] can't do the other we can't
[2:43:04] i came one time one night to a little
[2:43:06] church
[2:43:07] packed full of people sitting in there
[2:43:08] on the outside to raise the windows for
[2:43:11] the people to hear the preaching and i
[2:43:12] preached that night right out of the
[2:43:14] message they are and i said if you
[2:43:15] people don't quit tinkering around with
[2:43:17] this message
[2:43:20] taking it right out of the bible and
[2:43:21] trying to hang it by itself you're going
[2:43:24] to have cows eating out of the tops of
[2:43:26] the trees just like brother branham
[2:43:27] talked about you're going to get the
[2:43:29] thing out of order
[2:43:31] how many of you know when you're putting
[2:43:32] the puzzle together you got to read
[2:43:34] watch the picture on the box
[2:43:37] that's the pattern
[2:43:39] that's the pattern if you try to put the
[2:43:41] puzzle together and get one piece out of
[2:43:43] place
[2:43:44] you'll have cows
[2:43:46] eating tree
[2:43:48] grass out of the tops of trees instead
[2:43:51] of underneath the trees
[2:43:53] what is the pattern the bible
[2:43:55] what is the pattern for worship brother
[2:43:57] branham said it right here pentecost
[2:44:01] is our pattern he said every time
[2:44:04] without fail in the bible when the holy
[2:44:06] ghost came upon the people you read it
[2:44:07] you read it
[2:44:12] how staggering around like drunk men
[2:44:15] speaking in other tongues
[2:44:22] aren't you afraid it's going to get wild
[2:44:24] oh lord we're so far from wild
[2:44:28] i don't know if i'll live long enough to
[2:44:29] get us to wild
[2:44:35] really
[2:44:36] you mean you think a little bit of loud
[2:44:38] praise is wild
[2:44:41] you know what we've done we've left
[2:44:43] people that come out of baptist and
[2:44:44] methodist and nothing's
[2:44:47] we've let them come into this truth and
[2:44:50] influence the way we worship god
[2:44:53] [Applause]
[2:44:55] because many of them never had a
[2:44:57] pentecostal experience we've put ours
[2:44:59] under the pew
[2:45:01] [Music]
[2:45:02] it sure does show
[2:45:06] they acted the same way
[2:45:09] last paragraph let me say this that in
[2:45:11] the heathen lands where i've had the
[2:45:13] place the privilege of traveling and
[2:45:15] seeing blanket natives on the islands
[2:45:17] and in the hottentots and see them stand
[2:45:20] there where you have to speak through an
[2:45:21] interpreter never heard the name of
[2:45:23] jesus christ in their life but tell them
[2:45:25] the story
[2:45:26] and ask them to raise up their hands and
[2:45:28] receive god
[2:45:30] they do the same thing you do right here
[2:45:32] when you receive the holy ghost
[2:45:36] they've never seen anybody act like
[2:45:38] pentecostals right
[2:45:40] but when they get under that hunger and
[2:45:42] that desperation they hear the preacher
[2:45:45] say they raise up their hands
[2:45:50] i've seen them run out of the meeting to
[2:45:52] get clothes on
[2:45:54] more clothes
[2:45:58] i saw more naked women in tanzania than
[2:46:00] any any country that i've ever been in
[2:46:03] they were everywhere on the street bare
[2:46:06] bear up from their waist up
[2:46:08] just doing their business just
[2:46:10] conducting their business
[2:46:11] and we were having meetings and they
[2:46:13] would come in and they would wrap them
[2:46:15] up and i never saw one leave i never saw
[2:46:17] you couldn't try this in america hardly
[2:46:19] but i never saw one leave or get mad
[2:46:21] they just said to the to them they'd say
[2:46:23] friend you are so welcome here can we
[2:46:26] just wrap this around you
[2:46:28] because this is a holy place
[2:46:30] this is a sacred place and and we don't
[2:46:33] want no distractions here can we and
[2:46:35] i've never never knew of a fuss
[2:46:38] i watched some of it going on right and
[2:46:40] go sit down
[2:46:43] and then the spirit of god would come
[2:46:44] and we'd say do you want us to receive
[2:46:46] christ do you want to come to the full
[2:46:48] baptism of the holy ghost and i'd see
[2:46:50] them women raising up their hands
[2:46:52] holding onto their blanket
[2:46:57] i've seen god fill them with the holy
[2:46:58] ghost with nobody to show them how to
[2:47:00] demonstrate or how to act never been in
[2:47:03] a pentecostal church
[2:47:05] and the spirit of god would fall on them
[2:47:07] and they would dance all over that place
[2:47:09] worshiping god praising the lord and
[2:47:10] holding on to that blanket
[2:47:14] because they understood from that moment
[2:47:16] on it was a sacred meeting it was a
[2:47:18] sacrifice don't you forget when you come
[2:47:20] in here
[2:47:21] this is a sanctified and anointed place
[2:47:24] come on now don't you forget it
[2:47:27] they're watching us
[2:47:29] they're watching us
[2:47:32] someone said to me recently in a very
[2:47:34] loving way do you think we need to put a
[2:47:36] little curtain
[2:47:37] up here behind the instruments i know
[2:47:39] because sometimes it you might be able
[2:47:41] to see it no that's not the solution the
[2:47:43] solution is for everybody up here to
[2:47:45] make sure they've got on a skirt long
[2:47:47] enough
[2:47:50] i don't want some drapery up there like
[2:47:52] like we're some kind of nuts
[2:47:57] i want you to put a little more material
[2:47:59] make sure you when you're up here on
[2:48:01] this platform you are displaying
[2:48:04] honor and respect for the sacred things
[2:48:06] of god
[2:48:07] so that when you dance you are let me
[2:48:09] tell you something the holy ghost is a
[2:48:10] gentleman and he's not going to undress
[2:48:12] you
[2:48:14] and he's not going to expose you
[2:48:18] so you make sure well i don't think
[2:48:19] there's going to be any chance of me
[2:48:20] getting that excited i would to god
[2:48:25] just in case get you a little extra
[2:48:29] you don't ever know
[2:48:32] you get right under the inspiration and
[2:48:34] you might get free you might leave here
[2:48:37] and say i know now what was wrong with
[2:48:39] me i didn't have enough victory i just
[2:48:42] didn't have
[2:48:44] enough
[2:48:45] victory
[2:48:46] [Music]
[2:48:48] tell them the story
[2:48:51] musicians are coming you know what i was
[2:48:53] going to preach on something totally
[2:48:55] different
[2:48:57] i was going to preach on first samuel
[2:48:59] 30. come tuesday night maybe i'll get to
[2:49:01] it
[2:49:02] i was going to preach on david
[2:49:05] encouraged himself
[2:49:12] if anybody had a reason to cry
[2:49:15] david did
[2:49:17] brethren he not only lost one wife
[2:49:21] he'd lost two
[2:49:24] both wives were ravished and taken
[2:49:27] captive
[2:49:29] all of his soldiers
[2:49:34] 400 went with him i think wasn't in 200
[2:49:37] stayed behind
[2:49:38] so we must have had about 600 at the
[2:49:40] time i might be wrong on my numbers
[2:49:43] but remember they came back
[2:49:46] and everything was burning
[2:49:49] not a woman in sight not a child in
[2:49:51] sight everybody gone
[2:49:55] david's heart was
[2:49:58] heavy within himself
[2:50:00] the bible said the people wept until
[2:50:02] they had no more strength to weep
[2:50:05] and they folks did like they always do
[2:50:09] they blame it on the leaders
[2:50:12] they wanted to stone david
[2:50:16] it was his fault
[2:50:18] that the women had been taken captive
[2:50:22] and david's heart was broken
[2:50:27] he felt as forsaken and low as he'd ever
[2:50:30] felt in his life not one friend to
[2:50:32] encourage him or hold his hand
[2:50:35] not one friend
[2:50:38] and it says but david encouraged himself
[2:50:42] in the lord
[2:50:45] you have no excuse
[2:50:49] very few of us have been through what
[2:50:51] david went through you may think you're
[2:50:52] david
[2:50:54] but very few of us have been through
[2:50:55] what david went through
[2:50:57] you got your wife don't you you got your
[2:50:59] children don't you you got a bed to lay
[2:51:01] in don't you he had it all taken
[2:51:04] and not only he but everybody he loved
[2:51:06] and depended on taken
[2:51:09] everything they had taken
[2:51:12] but brother skip when there was nobody
[2:51:14] to encourage david what'd he do
[2:51:18] how do you think he did it he didn't
[2:51:20] have a tape to listen to
[2:51:24] how do you think he got encouraged
[2:51:26] sister ben
[2:51:27] he just started remembering
[2:51:31] all the other times i'm not gonna preach
[2:51:32] that
[2:51:34] that was supposed to be
[2:51:36] my thought for the message
[2:51:39] but tell them the story and ask them to
[2:51:40] raise up their hands and receive god
[2:51:42] they do the same universal thing it's
[2:51:44] the power of almighty god the display of
[2:51:46] his token
[2:51:48] upon his children
[2:51:52] whether they're black excuse me whether
[2:51:54] they're red black white
[2:51:59] or whatever they might be
[2:52:01] it's the only place that fellowship is
[2:52:05] given
[2:52:06] underneath
[2:52:09] the token
[2:52:10] it's the only place listen carefully
[2:52:12] it's the only place that fellowship is
[2:52:16] given it's underneath the token
[2:52:20] now we know by the message that both the
[2:52:22] blood and the spirit represents the
[2:52:24] token because the spirit was in the
[2:52:25] blood you've got to have the token
[2:52:29] on display amen
[2:52:31] you see we're coming down to the end
[2:52:34] and you may find out if you all just
[2:52:36] play a little something soft
[2:52:38] you may find out as you go along in this
[2:52:41] last hour when everything's going to be
[2:52:43] against you

[2:53:34] with those who have had a real
[2:53:35] experience with god and
[2:53:37] he may be the first one i ever saw
[2:53:39] around this message beating a tambourine
[2:53:41] i think he probably was he was a
[2:53:43] tambourine beater
[2:53:46] and uh i love him
[2:53:52] and marlene love me
[2:53:54] and he sent me this picture you can't
[2:53:56] hardly tell but i forgot about this
[2:53:58] picture i have it somewhere but this is
[2:54:00] the picture of brother branham sitting
[2:54:02] on top of the pulpit
[2:54:05] he hasn't swung his legs over the front
[2:54:06] yet i don't think
[2:54:08] but he's climbed up on top of the pulpit
[2:54:10] you think a man was under inspiration
[2:54:12] got out of himself
[2:54:14] you think a man you think a preacher
[2:54:16] forgot all the advice from dr roy davis
[2:54:20] when he got up on the pulpit and got so
[2:54:21] caught oh god i would i would lord
[2:54:25] that you would so fill your man's
[2:54:28] servants all over this world
[2:54:30] i would to god that you would fill me
[2:54:36] with so much of your holy ghost power
[2:54:39] that i would forget about all
[2:54:42] the other things and be able to worship
[2:54:44] you that way
[2:54:46] lost
[2:54:48] oh see he wasn't just one that ran
[2:54:50] around trees in the wilderness when
[2:54:52] nobody was there to see
[2:54:54] he also knew what it meant to get under
[2:54:56] inspiration in the house
[2:54:59] anything we can do to blow it up or
[2:55:00] anything i don't think so
[2:55:03] but do you see he's climbed up on top
[2:55:05] his hand
[2:55:07] is resting on the top of the pulpit
[2:55:10] with one hand in the air and he has
[2:55:12] climbed up on top of the pulpit
[2:55:15] see his leg
[2:55:19] see his leg over here on this side
[2:55:21] [Music]
[2:55:23] why are you showing that
[2:55:25] because we're always having to take this
[2:55:28] from so many different angles
[2:55:32] because so many different kinds of
[2:55:33] people watch in and we want to minister
[2:55:36] to all of them and we want them to
[2:55:38] understand that we're not trying to make
[2:55:41] this profit anything that it was not
[2:55:45] but we refuse to accept the fact that he
[2:55:48] did not believe
[2:55:50] like we're told oftentimes in getting
[2:55:52] under the spirit except when he was
[2:55:53] preaching
[2:55:56] he believed in worship you answer any of
[2:55:58] my texts for me while you have it
[2:56:03] it's 259 here if you want to deal with
[2:56:05] them and answer them
[2:56:07] thank you brother
[2:56:09] hembree how many of you appreciate
[2:56:10] seeing that
[2:56:17] i do
[2:56:18] thank you lord
[2:56:31] let's stand are you ready to stand
[2:56:34] god's going to meet us
[2:56:37] he's going to meet us we're looking
[2:56:38] forward to this coming weekend
[2:56:42] we'll be here tuesday night at seven
[2:56:44] o'clock sister sally duke will be here
[2:56:46] singing for us and
[2:56:49] i don't care if she sings the whole
[2:56:50] service and we just bring a short little
[2:56:52] word doesn't matter to me we only get to
[2:56:55] see her here every few years
[2:56:58] she's just looking for fellowship
[2:57:01] and we feel mighty blessed
[2:57:03] that she would have a little fellowship
[2:57:05] her and brother bobby with us
[2:57:07] they're wonderful people
[2:57:10] and she's an anointed singer
[2:57:14] one time at harmony
[2:57:17] there was a big discussion going on and
[2:57:19] i guess there was enough people in that
[2:57:20] room that i'm not really divulging
[2:57:22] anything
[2:57:22] because i'm sure it's been told and
[2:57:26] it's interesting to hear the different
[2:57:27] ways that people look at gatherings and
[2:57:30] some were looking at it like a concert
[2:57:32] and some are looking at it like a church
[2:57:34] service and some just use it as an
[2:57:37] opportunity to get to sing because they
[2:57:39] don't get to sing in their churches
[2:57:40] sometime
[2:57:42] and sister sally
[2:57:44] it was an open floor discussion i didn't
[2:57:46] talk about her because she's not here
[2:57:50] it was an open floor discussion and she
[2:57:52] stood up and kind of trembling
[2:57:54] and she said i get to sing all the time
[2:57:57] she said i get constant invitations to
[2:58:00] sing for this meeting and that meeting
[2:58:02] not not just church
[2:58:04] she's very very active in her community
[2:58:07] and
[2:58:07] she sings for community events and
[2:58:10] nursing homes and
[2:58:11] she said i sing all the time i get to do
[2:58:13] concerts all the time she said but
[2:58:17] i i just couldn't
[2:58:19] fly all the way out to tucson
[2:58:21] to just do another concert
[2:58:24] she said the reason why i come is
[2:58:26] because i love to worship him
[2:58:28] and for me it's not a concert at all
[2:58:31] it's a worship service
[2:58:33] and as long as that one that's what it's
[2:58:35] going to be i want to be right in the
[2:58:36] middle of it how many of you appreciate
[2:58:38] that
[2:58:40] she's not just a great singer but she's
[2:58:42] a worship worship
[2:58:44] she has a worshiper's heart
[2:58:47] and she was singing those anointed songs
[2:58:49] on the on the cassette and the tape and
[2:58:51] the cd later when our children were born
[2:58:55] and the midwives would get under that
[2:58:57] inspiration we'd ended up we ended up
[2:58:59] giving a music
[2:59:00] from sister sally and they'd say i
[2:59:02] wished i could play that in every birth
[2:59:04] i do
[2:59:06] because that brings a little methodist
[2:59:07] girl she said that brings the presence
[2:59:10] of the lord
[2:59:11] and when benjamin came into this world
[2:59:13] he came in and i was speaking in tongues
[2:59:17] and the
[2:59:18] little midwife and the nurse said i
[2:59:20] don't know what you're doing but
[2:59:21] whatever you're doing you keep doing
[2:59:23] that because it's working
[2:59:25] sometimes people don't know what it is
[2:59:28] but they can see what's happening
[2:59:31] and they honor and respect it are you
[2:59:32] going to lead us in some worship here
[2:59:34] why don't we worship the lord today
[2:59:36] we're thankful for the word
[2:59:38] we're thankful for the atmosphere we're
[2:59:40] thankful for the reinforcements coming
[2:59:42] in to help us
[2:59:44] and we just want to give god praise
[2:59:46] because he's worthy
[2:59:48] hallelujah
[2:59:52] praise the lord
[2:59:54] come on benjamin let's sing to god's
[2:59:56] glory and worship him everybody that
[2:59:58] will cast my mind

[3:23:09] expense of the meetings this week and i
[3:23:12] know there's been plans made in things
[3:23:13] but just the holy spirit yesterday i
[3:23:16] almost missed it and then i did miss the
[3:23:18] timing so i'm not going to throw my wife
[3:23:20] under the bus like adam did his
[3:23:22] i'm not going to do that i'm going to
[3:23:24] take responsibility for what i did wrong
[3:23:26] there and getting late to church and
[3:23:28] then if i was out of order which i
[3:23:29] wasn't but if i was it was so good and
[3:23:32] refreshing and just the right timing
[3:23:37] i i heard every word this morning so we
[3:23:39] honor you brother greeley i want you to
[3:23:41] know how important it is to me
[3:23:42] that you know how much we love and
[3:23:44] appreciate you and your service to this
[3:23:45] body and we come to work with however
[3:23:48] god sees fit and i told brother shelly
[3:23:50] if that means sitting on that back row i
[3:23:52] don't know that the sisters really want
[3:23:54] me screaming in their ears because i
[3:23:55] like to amen
[3:23:57] so if i need to be up here close to the
[3:23:59] front whatever's comfortable for
[3:24:01] everybody we'll find a spot for me i
[3:24:02] think i've even got my own pew in the in
[3:24:05] the truck
[3:24:06] don't don't i baby i i mean i'm dead
[3:24:09] serious i got my own pew we can just
[3:24:12] we'll get it out this week if anybody's
[3:24:14] not busy tomorrow until i find a house
[3:24:15] we're just going to stuff all our stuff
[3:24:17] in storage and until god shows us the
[3:24:19] what when where and how
[3:24:21] so
[3:24:22] that's what i got
[3:24:24] i was going to share some more stuff but
[3:24:25] i think we got meetings coming up and we
[3:24:27] better save a little bit for that
[3:24:30] so i love y'all
[3:24:33] [Music]
[3:24:36] [Applause]
[3:24:50] praise god
[3:25:00] praise the lord
[3:25:02] you know uh
[3:25:04] well
[3:25:08] there's not any dull moments
[3:25:11] with brother daniel miller's around i'll
[3:25:13] tell you that right now
[3:25:15] we were we were expecting them and then
[3:25:17] we weren't expecting them and then we
[3:25:19] were and then we weren't
[3:25:20] so we didn't know for sure if they would
[3:25:22] be here or not but i thought that he was
[3:25:24] mighty silent this morning
[3:25:27] no text no check-ins
[3:25:30] and i usually get at least one text of
[3:25:31] service that says i see you
[3:25:35] i didn't get a text that said i see you
[3:25:38] so i figured in my mind that he must be
[3:25:40] somewhere on the way
[3:25:42] but i want to say that we welcome you in
[3:25:46] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[3:25:48] your precious family we need you
[3:25:52] we need them
[3:25:58] you know i was talking to someone
[3:25:59] recently and we've kept this very very
[3:26:01] because we just didn't know how things
[3:26:03] were coming and
[3:26:04] uh it was in my mind to perhaps just
[3:26:06] wait until i thought we would give him
[3:26:08] one weekend
[3:26:10] as a guest as an evangelist
[3:26:13] and and i thought maybe we would mention
[3:26:16] this after the meetings but i am
[3:26:18] totally open i told him on the phone
[3:26:20] last night he's going to have liberty to
[3:26:22] minister next weekend in whatever way he
[3:26:25] sees fit
[3:26:27] they sing he preaches there's giftings
[3:26:29] in his life we're not going to put any
[3:26:32] boundaries or restrictions on him we're
[3:26:34] just going to come and feast amen
[3:26:36] and so i i feel like he knew that he had
[3:26:39] that liberty he asked when he come up
[3:26:41] here this is he said i feel like this is
[3:26:43] a time to announce it and so
[3:26:45] we are delighted and i will as as soon
[3:26:48] as we can
[3:26:49] we'll give you bits and pieces of what
[3:26:51] god is really doing and how it's
[3:26:53] unfolding but it's god
[3:26:55] i was telling someone on the phone uh
[3:26:58] that uh talking to them a little bit
[3:27:00] about this
[3:27:01] and uh i said i don't have a fancy
[3:27:04] theological term to describe what i have
[3:27:07] felt the lord doing
[3:27:09] there's only one word it's just crazy
[3:27:15] you know like jehovah sneaky
[3:27:19] we got all the biblical terms for him
[3:27:21] but there's one that's not covered
[3:27:23] and that's when he sneaks in and does
[3:27:25] what he's going to do
[3:27:26] and when i say crazy i'm not talking
[3:27:28] about god being out of his mind
[3:27:31] i'm talking about god pulling things
[3:27:33] together in such a way that only he can
[3:27:35] receive glory
[3:27:37] and doing it in such a profound way in a
[3:27:40] special way in a glorious way
[3:27:43] and so we have so much to be thankful
[3:27:45] for
[3:27:46] and god has spoken many times through
[3:27:49] the years i'm sending reinforcements i'm
[3:27:51] sending reinforcements i'm sending
[3:27:54] reinforcements so we receive them as an
[3:27:57] answer to the word of the lord
[3:27:59] and we are looking forward to all that
[3:28:02] god has not only this weekend but in the
[3:28:04] coming days ahead
[3:28:06] god's doing something already
[3:28:09] it's going to get gooder from here
[3:28:11] we know that the lord has great things
[3:28:15] anybody want to say amen
[3:28:17] let's stand together
[3:28:20] wow wow
[3:28:21] wow wow
[3:28:25] i have through the years had evangelists
[3:28:27] that come in
[3:28:29] buses and
[3:28:30] travel trailers to live in and
[3:28:34] would use them while they were here and
[3:28:36] then go but i think this is about the
[3:28:38] first time i've ever invited somebody to
[3:28:40] come to preach and they bring everything
[3:28:42] they own with them when they come
[3:28:44] now talk about taking somebody at their
[3:28:46] word and when they get invited i'd say
[3:28:49] he
[3:28:50] took me at my word didn't he and uh we
[3:28:53] just know that god it's god it's god
[3:28:56] it's just god
[3:28:59] there's so many things that we don't
[3:29:00] know how it will all run together but
[3:29:02] it's going to run together for the glory
[3:29:05] of god
[3:29:07] he's moving pieces
[3:29:09] he's moving pieces on the chessboard
[3:29:11] he's moving pieces he's moving pieces
[3:29:14] he's doing something
[3:29:16] he's taking victory for his name
[3:29:18] hallelujah
[3:29:21] he's fulfilling his word
[3:29:24] you want to praise him another minute
