Description:
In this Moment we see that the Last Supper was more than a ritual—it was prophecy fulfilled. The feasts of the Lord were a divine rehearsal, pointing to the true Lamb who would be slain. The blood on the doorposts, the bread baked in haste, the bitter herbs—all were shadows of the greater reality revealed in Christ. And now, at the table, what the elements had always pointed toward was present in living form: the Lamb of God Himself, serving them communion. In the breaking of bread and the pouring of wine, Jesus unveiled the mystery hidden in those ancient signs. Here, humility was exposed in the new creation—the perfect sacrifice who draws us into covenant life.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So this last supper was really a prophetic act. It was really a prophecy. He is prophesying that what you have been doing year after year after year following in the feast of the Lord, the feast of Yahweh, you have been doing this dress rehearsal. You've been you've been remembering the lamb that was slain and the blood that went on the doorpost. You've been remembering the bread of haste that you had to make and you weren't allowed to have time for it to to leaven, to rise. You're remembering the bitter herbs. You're remembering all of these elements and you've been doing it year after year after year. But I'm going to add a little something here that's going to give you a prophetic glimpse of what's about to happen in the earth. The spotless lamb is about to take his place. The one that Abraham saw when he lifted up his eyes and looked ahead. He's about to take his place. His body is about to be broken and twisted and hang before all of you. &gt;&gt; Come on. And his blood is going to be shed. It's not spilt. It was shed for mankind. &gt;&gt; And so when you eat this bread, you are partaking of the body of the Lord because that's who you are as well. He had a physical body. He has a spiritual mystical body. That's his bride. &gt;&gt; You understand that? It's New Testament. Apostle Paul, first church age messenger, explained to us about the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ. He wanted them to know there's something about to shift here. And you're not going to stop remembering what I did in the Exodus. But now when you come together and you eat these things, you're going to remember my death. You're going to remember that a price has been paid for you. It was not based on your worthiness. &gt;&gt; It was based on fornowledge &gt;&gt; and predetermined destiny. &gt;&gt; And it means something today. And he said it's going to mean something all the way in &gt;&gt; to the millennial kingdom. Somebody said, "What do you mean communion is going to mean something all the way into the millennial kingdom?" Well, Jesus told us that night. He said, "I'll drink no more of the fruit of the vine &gt;&gt; until I drink it with you &gt;&gt; in the kingdom." Paraphrase in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; So, I tell you, that's going to carry all the way through. I I believe he'll hand you a cup &gt;&gt; in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Then he does something that's not a part of the seder at all. He There is a handwashing ritual that takes place. It it's to remind us you can't wash sin away. Just ask Pilate. You You can't wash away blood guiltiness with water and soap. &gt;&gt; But Jesus did a little bit different than what it had been done for a long time. Maybe 4,000 years. Long time. Some people say two, some people say four, but anyway, a long time. And uh he did something a little different. He didn't just put the basin out for their hands to be washed and passed the basin. But the Bible said he took off his outer coat and he and he gerted himself around with a towel and he knelt down and he began to wash the disciples feet. Were their feet dirty? Probably. But they could have washed their own feet. He wasn't washing them out of necessity that day. He was washing them as a prophecy. He began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded. Son of God, word in flesh, stripped his garment, girded himself, washed his disciples feet in view of all the other disciples. Humility was exposed. &gt;&gt; The servantthood nature of the new creation was exposed. &gt;&gt; You've got to understand that if there's a prophecy, there's a fulfillment and there's a message. If there's a sign, there's a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God has us today following the example of the Lord Jesus, taking the little elements, washing one another's feet, it's saying something to us that must not be lost. &gt;&gt; Now, the reality needs to be this church. There ought not to be a brother, if I'm a brother, not ought not to be one brother in this church that I couldn't wash his feet &gt;&gt; and be glad to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he don't need his feet washed, particularly in the natural. I hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope he's not saving it up. &gt;&gt; But by doing that, it's a demonstration. &gt;&gt; It's it's me reminding myself I'm no higher, no more important than any of the brothers around me. We've got to learn to serve one another in all manner, always, &gt;&gt; even when it's inconvenient, &gt;&gt; which would be quite often because we all have busy lives. The very fact that our Lord was willing &gt;&gt; to use these prophetic demonstrations. He was pointing to something greater than just washing feet and eating soda crackers and some juice. He was pointing to what the apostle would say so eloquently here in Philippians. It was part of this condescension. It was part of this submitting himself as a servant to the father's will and as a servant to us. I tell you, he comes when I call. &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever found out he comes &gt;&gt; when we call? &gt;&gt; He does.
