[0:00] wow and Jesus began preaching to them
[0:04] but all of the while he's taking on the
[0:06] weight on the weight of this sinful
[0:09] world as he's going toward the cross he
[0:12] knows the
[0:15] end but he's still day by day laying
[0:18] down his will to in order to get to the
[0:22] finality of it the
[0:25] cross the execution
[0:28] stake the place swear that he would end
[0:31] all of your
[0:33] pain all of your suffering all of your
[0:37] shame all of your
[0:39] condemnation all of your guilt well
[0:42] brother I feel awful guilty today how
[0:44] how do you figure that he ended it
[0:49] all either you believe the word or you
[0:53] don't the devil does not really have
[0:57] authority in your life right
[1:02] he only has Authority by what I give
[1:06] him that's how he plays around in our
[1:09] lives that how that's how he gets us
[1:11] messed up in our
[1:13] mind that's how he causes us to build
[1:17] Abominations in our
[1:20] mind Idols in our
[1:24] mind we have agreed with him that our
[1:27] ground is still cursed
[1:30] we have agreed with him that we're still
[1:33] walking under a curse but the Lord Jesus
[1:36] came to reverse the
[1:39] curse those that are sons of God they
[1:42] agree with what has already been done
[1:45] the curse that has been reversed the
[1:47] curse has already been taken onto Christ
[1:51] he took the
[1:53] curse and the curse he took with him to
[1:56] hell yes sir yet we find ourselves
[2:01] agreeing with that curse friend you
[2:04] don't have
[2:05] to you don't have to agree with that
[2:09] curse and all I'm saying is what has
[2:13] already been
[2:15] said the words of our mouth were either
[2:19] blessing or cursing and the
[2:22] seed is not cursed and the ground
[2:26] doesn't have to be because Jesus Took
[2:29] The Curse
[2:30] to hell and left it there so we
[2:34] continue
[2:37] cultivating picking up
[2:40] rocks John said when he comes he's going
[2:43] to baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[2:46] and Fire that's what some of us
[2:50] need we need the fire of the Holy Ghost
[2:54] to come and burn some things out of
[2:57] us to burn burn all the
[3:01] underbrush but I've had some harvests
[3:03] along the way but I realize that I've
[3:06] not had the hundredfold Harvest that I
[3:09] really desire to have and so I need some
[3:12] of the Holy Ghost and Fire to come in my
[3:15] life and burn some things out of me that
[3:17] I did not know were in there I need some
[3:20] of the fire of God to burn out some of
[3:22] the tormenting spirits that have been
[3:25] inside of me I need the Holy Ghost in
[3:27] fire to burn some of the de Dem things
[3:30] out of my life that I've allowed to
[3:32] remain there and I kept pronouncing the
[3:35] curse over it and the curse remained and
[3:38] so I've had to live with the curse and
[3:40] live with the curse and live with the
[3:42] curse because I didn't agree with the
[3:45] reversing of the curse of Calvary when
[3:47] he took it to hell and I've had to deal
[3:50] with it but oh that the Holy Ghost and
[3:52] Fire would descend upon us and it'd come
[3:56] by the power of the Holy Ghost and burn
[3:59] out of us all of that stuff that hinders
[4:02] the growth of the seed
