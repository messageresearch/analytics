[39:51] being that was a little lower than the
[39:54] angels that would have a heart to to
[39:57] worship you because of the redemption
[40:00] plan that you had put in motion. Lord, I
[40:03] thank you for the plan of redemption
[40:06] today. for the ability that you put in
[40:09] us to be able to call on our creator.
[40:13] Lord, I thank you that you saved us.

[43:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; According to the power that works in us,
[43:14] I thank you, Lord, that your spirit
[43:16] abides in us.
[43:20] Your dunamis,
[43:23] &gt;&gt; your dunamis power is inside of us.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; And it leads us to ask according to your
[43:32] will and not to consume it upon our own
[43:36] lusts.
[43:39] So Lord, we ask exceeding and abundantly
[43:42] above
[43:45] according to the spirit of the living
[43:48] God.
[43:52] Oh, I worship you, Jesus.
[43:56] Thank you.
[43:58] Thank you, Lord.
[44:05] [Music]
[44:09] Oh, where
[44:11] could I go?
[44:16] Where could I go?
[44:21] Seeking
[44:22] a refuge for my soul.
[44:28] [Music]
[44:29] Needing a friend
[44:33] to help me in the end.
[44:38] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[44:44] Oh, tell me, where could I go?
[44:50] Where could I go?
[44:54] seeking a refuge for my soul,
[45:04] a friend
[45:06] to help me in the end.
[45:11] Where could I go but to the Lord? Sing
[45:16] once again.
[45:19] Where could I go?
[45:23] Oh, where could I go?
[45:27] Seeking a refuge for my soul.
[45:35] Needing a friend
[45:39] to save me in the end.
[45:44] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. In him there is refuge.
[46:01] Hallelujah.
[46:03] We're going to go to prayer today and
[46:04] take our needs to the Lord. Do you have
[46:06] a need just by the lifting of the hand?
[46:09] All over the house, I see hands that are
[46:11] being lifted. God sees your needs out
[46:13] across that camera. Those of you that
[46:16] are watching this service, God sees your
[46:18] need and he knows all about you. And we
[46:20] join our faith with yours to remember
[46:22] your need to the Lord. Would we continue
[46:26] to remember brother Bobby words that God
[46:28] would give him a mighty miracle. He's
[46:31] having uh radiation and chemotherapy
[46:36] all at the same time. And it's a lot on
[46:39] his body.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. he has uh already, you know, dealt
[46:42] with walking joint pain and and this is
[46:47] a lot. But the report that we're getting
[46:49] is that his spirits are high, his faith
[46:51] is high, and that sister Jennifer has
[46:54] been absolutely amazing in her faith
[46:57] &gt;&gt; and in her service to her husband. And
[46:59] let's just believe God. What a the
[47:01] brother Bobby is so known and and loved
[47:04] and cared for in the in the church
[47:07] communities and in the business world.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; And uh what a great testimony to our God
[47:15] who is the same yesterday, today, and
[47:17] forever to give him a mighty miracle.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And then the other request is there's a
[47:21] sister Linda Scaff. I don't know if you
[47:24] any of you really know her, but she has
[47:26] been at brother Bill uh Jon's church for
[47:30] many years now. And I think she's
[47:32] perhaps raising her grandson. You might
[47:34] would know her by seeing her with her
[47:36] grandson a lot. She had a spot appear in
[47:40] her eye that was bothering her. And she
[47:42] went to the doctor and found out that it
[47:44] was indeed cancer.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And she is going through both chemo, I
[47:49] think, and radiation on the eye. It's
[47:52] taking quite a toll on her body. She's
[47:55] not u extremely healthy otherwise. And
[47:58] then you start putting this radiation
[48:00] right into the body and then all of the
[48:02] drugs uh hoping to be able to reduce the
[48:06] damage of that cancer. I don't know what
[48:08] the long-term hope is, but uh she
[48:11] reached out specifically and asked me to
[48:13] pray. Uh she loves us and uh and and
[48:17] really really needs our prayers today.
[48:20] God can move for her, too. It's no
[48:24] different whether it's your eye or or
[48:26] your brain or where where that devil is.
[48:29] We have a healing in the atonement.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; And we just have to keep speaking that
[48:35] and and let's let's do that. And I know
[48:37] there are needs here. Uh Tiffany needs
[48:40] prayer. She's indeed had a broke bone
[48:44] there, but it was already positioned to
[48:46] heal. But, uh, she's got to stay off of
[48:49] it and be careful with it. And, uh, Zach
[48:51] has a burn on his hand. And just so many
[48:55] needs, some of them huge and some of
[48:57] them small, but God sees them all.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Sister Megan still in hospital.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Sister Megan's still in the hospital.
[49:02] May come home today, she said. But she's
[49:05] just trying to trust the Lord and
[49:07] believe. And, uh, the boys have a a
[49:10] young man who does our lawn and and they
[49:13] know him for years. His mom and dad,
[49:15] they know them well. and and he had
[49:17] cellulitis in his face. He's been in the
[49:20] hospital for days and we're we're Joshua
[49:24] went to see him, but he's not been able
[49:25] to talk to him in two days. We're not
[49:26] sure if he's gone home or not, but it
[49:28] was getting very bad. They were going to
[49:30] have to do something. I don't know what
[49:33] all but it was it was pretty serious.
[49:35] His name is Try, and I'd like to see the
[49:38] Lord help him.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. Let's take these needs
[49:43] to the Lord today. Sing this little
[49:44] chorus as we're getting ready to pray.
[49:47] Wonderful,
[49:50] wonderful
[49:53] Jesus.
[49:58] He is my friend,
[50:03] true
[50:05] to the end.
[50:09] He gave himself
[50:12] to redeem
[50:16] me.
[50:19] Jesus,
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] wonderful
[50:24] Lord. Brother R.J., will you come and
[50:27] pray today, please? Oh wonderful,
[50:32] wonderful
[50:35] Jesus.
[50:40] He is my friend,
[50:45] true
[50:47] to the end.
[50:50] He gave himself to
[50:55] redeem
[50:58] me.
[51:01] Jesus,
[51:04] wonder.
[51:06] Sing one more time before we pray.
[51:10] Oh, wonderful,
[51:14] wonderful
[51:17] Jesus.
[51:22] He is my friend,
[51:27] true
[51:29] to the end.
[51:33] He gave himself
[51:37] to redeem
[51:41] me.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[51:46] wonderful
[51:48] [Music]
[51:49] Lord.
[51:54] Oh, Aba,
[51:57] how thankful we are, Lord,
[52:01] to know that we're yours.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; To know that you called us, Lord.
[52:08] That you forneew us, that you called us,
[52:11] that you justified us,
[52:14] and that in you, oh God, we're already
[52:16] glorified.
[52:20] And Lord, we we come to you today
[52:24] to see the full outworking of your plan
[52:27] and your purposes.
[52:30] Lord, that nothing would be left behind,
[52:33] that nothing would be dismissed, but
[52:35] that there would be a people that would
[52:38] come forth and fully appropriate
[52:41] the redemption that you've provided, oh
[52:44] God.
[52:45] And so we come to you today, Lord, and
[52:48] we say that we believe.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; We believe your word, oh God.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; We believe that by your stripes, we are
[52:56] healed.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; We believe in the God that brings
[53:01] perfect peace to our lives.
[53:09] Lord, we're available to you. Oh yes.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; We're available for your purposes.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be observers, Lord,
[53:20] about what you're doing, but we want to
[53:22] be active participants
[53:25] &gt;&gt; as you outwork your will in the earth.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, we lift every need to you today.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible for you, oh God.
[53:40] We pray for
[53:42] what's his brother Bobby.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know him, oh God, but you know
[53:48] him.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I thought of that verse. It's our names
[53:52] are engraven on the palms of your hands.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And even though it may may seem that
[53:58] you're far, oh God, you're so near.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; I pray that you would quicken my brother
[54:05] in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah.
[54:08] that faith would come and arise and that
[54:11] your healing anointing would flow, oh
[54:14] God,
[54:16] &gt;&gt; that testimonies of your mighty works
[54:19] would go forth for my sister. I pray
[54:22] Lord that you would drive this cancer
[54:25] out of her eye in the name of Yeshua,
[54:28] the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:34] It's your blood, oh God, that heals,
[54:37] that redeems, that restores.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; We pray for those in our family, Lord,
[54:44] that are weward.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Those that haven't yet realized who they
[54:49] are
[54:50] &gt;&gt; in you.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; We ask that your spirit would call them
[54:55] Yes, sir.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; and draw them, that their eyes would be
[54:58] opened, oh, Father,
[55:01] &gt;&gt; and use us. I pray for your people here,
[55:04] each of us, oh God,
[55:06] &gt;&gt; that our ears would be opened, that we
[55:09] would be sensitive to your voice, that
[55:11] we would be led by your spirit.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us not walk independently of
[55:18] you.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; But let us walk in full dependence, oh
[55:24] God.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; I think of that often. These needs, they
[55:28] come and they don't make us needy. We're
[55:31] not needy,
[55:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:33] &gt;&gt; But we are dependent on you.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; And so we just posture ourselves, oh
[55:39] God, today.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; We do.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; For you're out working for your will to
[55:44] be accomplished, Lord.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; I thank you for this hour. I thank you
[55:49] for this season. I thank you for the
[55:51] destiny, Lord, that's that's being
[55:54] stirred and restirred and awakening
[55:57] among us. I pray for this young people,
[56:00] Lord, that that we would be able to see
[56:04] &gt;&gt; our position in you and that that that
[56:07] hunger that comes forth, Lord, help us,
[56:10] oh God, to sanctify it and not satisfy
[56:14] it on anything of this world, but let us
[56:17] satisfy it purely on you, oh God.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, all we can do today is just say
[56:24] that we're thankful.
[56:27] We're grateful for you. We're we're
[56:29] grateful to be called by you to be
[56:32] bearers of your name.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Help us have ears to hear today. Lord,
[56:38] anoint my brother, Lord. Let there be no
[56:40] hindrance in the realm of the spirit,
[56:43] but let there just be clarity, Lord, and
[56:46] continuity in the name of Jesus Christ,
[56:49] Lord, that we can receive what we need
[56:53] to operate and function as your body and
[56:56] your bride in the earth. We say this in
[56:59] the name of Yeshua, the Messiah, the
[57:02] Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Praise you, Lord.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You may have your seats
[57:19] today.
[57:25] We are in one of God's cyclical seasons.
[57:29] the Jewish people leading up to the days
[57:33] of awe and the uh day of atonement.
[57:37] There's a period of time leading up to
[57:39] that they call days of repentance.
[57:42] We're in that season. It's a good thing
[57:45] to be repentant every day
[57:48] &gt;&gt; to make sure your heart is clear before
[57:52] the Lord and we're in anticipation of
[57:57] what the Lord wants to do for us during
[58:00] camp meeting. But we don't have to wait
[58:02] for camp meeting. We can be in
[58:04] anticipation today for him to do today.
[58:08] what he wants to do today and be a part
[58:11] of the building blocks of exactly what
[58:14] he wants to accomplish during camp
[58:16] meeting, which is another one of God's
[58:18] cyclical seasons, the feast of
[58:20] tabernacles. We just uh we just honor
[58:24] those because they're the feast of the
[58:26] Lord. And we are uh making preparations
[58:30] here on the Eagle's Refuge for the camp
[58:35] meeting. Uh you may have noticed as you
[58:37] come in today that the the the flower
[58:40] beds out here are taking shape. We're
[58:43] grateful to brother Daniel and all of
[58:45] his team that he had out here to get
[58:47] that on the move. Tomorrow morning we
[58:50] are going to have a work day getting the
[58:52] asphalt ready for coating recoding. Uh,
[58:56] brother Truman has graciously uh he has
[59:00] uh made available tomorrow morning
[59:03] breakfast for all of the brothers that
[59:05] show up for work. So breakfast is at
[59:08] 8:00 in the morning. Work will
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Well, if they want to operate a shovel,
[59:13] come on.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's still flower beds to get
[59:18] ready. There's uh and and uh there
[59:21] there's so much to do here on the ground
[59:23] now.
[59:25] I I need to make a an announcement and
[59:28] especially to all of you that live on
[59:32] this property. Everyone that lives on
[59:34] this property especially,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; not this week that's coming, but the
[59:41] following week, September the 10th,
[59:45] 11th, and 12th,
[59:48] we need to have as little traffic going
[59:51] in and out of this campground as
[59:52] possible.
[59:56] Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[59:59] And depending on weather, possibly
[1:00:01] Saturday, but we're saying Wednesday,
[1:00:03] Thursday, and Friday. I am asking you, I
[1:00:05] don't know how possible it is. They tell
[1:00:07] me that it's nearly impossible. And I'm
[1:00:09] asking you that you would get all of
[1:00:12] your Amazon packages delivered this week
[1:00:18] if you can because we are going to have
[1:00:22] to have traffic logistics as they try to
[1:00:25] get this property resealed. The asphalt
[1:00:28] that means one half of the road is going
[1:00:30] to be closed. there's only going to be
[1:00:33] one lane in and out and then the other
[1:00:35] day it's going to switch and go to the
[1:00:37] other side. And so we want as little
[1:00:39] traffic on it as possible while it is
[1:00:42] drying, curing, and so forth. And so we
[1:00:45] don't want the Amazon drivers. We don't
[1:00:46] want the FedEx drivers. We don't really
[1:00:48] want the post office. We're going to
[1:00:50] have to figure that out as well to be
[1:00:52] able to deal with the mail. Uh we may
[1:00:55] have to go pick that up at the post
[1:00:56] office. But I I'm I'm asking you humbly
[1:01:00] that you will help us in trying to
[1:01:03] navigate uh all of the traffic getting
[1:01:05] this uh asphalt recoded. So that is
[1:01:09] Wednesday the 10th through Friday the
[1:01:11] 12th
[1:01:13] next week.
[1:01:15] So we're asking for your help in getting
[1:01:17] this done. Brother RJ and Brother Hawk,
[1:01:20] there'll be one day where you all will
[1:01:22] have to park on the other side in the
[1:01:24] grass if you want your vehicles out
[1:01:26] because you won't be able to cross over
[1:01:28] when they seal the one side of it. Um,
[1:01:31] so that's that's important. I've already
[1:01:33] told Brother Shelley he can't come to
[1:01:34] work.
[1:01:37] Guess that's Benjamin, too. They're just
[1:01:41] we'll find a way. And so that's all part
[1:01:44] of getting ready for camp meeting. But
[1:01:46] we're excited because it is it is God
[1:01:50] updating. It is God doing. He's he's
[1:01:53] refreshing and renewing and and and he's
[1:01:56] getting us ready to go into the next
[1:01:58] season that he has for us. It's all a
[1:02:01] part of what he's doing in the spirit.
[1:02:04] We're doing everything that we can do in
[1:02:05] the natural because we want more than
[1:02:08] anything, we want the spirit to come
[1:02:10] down
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; and do what he wants to do among us.
[1:02:14] Brother Ben and Sister Kendra have a
[1:02:16] song. We want to invite them to come.
[1:02:18] While they're getting uh in position, we
[1:02:20] want to receive the tithe and offering
[1:02:22] to give unto the Lord. What belongs to
[1:02:25] him and then what he has put in our
[1:02:27] heart to give as an offering. We want to
[1:02:29] give today. Brother Ellias, will you
[1:02:31] help us? And uh Brother Austin Yantis,
[1:02:33] will you will let you go to the people
[1:02:36] and let them give of their tithe and
[1:02:38] offering to the Lord. Give as giving to
[1:02:41] the Lord. Remember, when you give,
[1:02:43] you're not giving to man. You're not
[1:02:45] even giving to ministry. You are giving
[1:02:47] to the Lord.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; It's his business that we are pouring
[1:02:52] into. And and we want to see it prosper.
[1:02:56] We want to see him do what he said he
[1:02:59] would do. We want to keep covenant with
[1:03:01] him.
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:15] of Jesus.
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:19] Go plead with your mother were the words
[1:03:24] of Hosea
[1:03:26] as he sent his children to extend his
[1:03:30] mercy.
[1:03:33] So they journeyied down the old path
[1:03:37] that led to much destruction.
[1:03:41] And all the while their loving hearts
[1:03:44] were hurting.
[1:03:48] Their hope was crushed inside as their
[1:03:52] compassion was denied.
[1:03:55] The woman they so loved seemed like a
[1:03:59] strangeanger.
[1:04:02] Heartbroken and alone, they took the
[1:04:06] long road home. For sin now rain on a
[1:04:12] hope seemed gone to change her.
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:20] One day the word was told some slaves
[1:04:25] were being sold. A restless love sent
[1:04:30] Jose Hosea seeking.
[1:04:34] One by one they brought them in. So
[1:04:39] beating down with sin
[1:04:42] within his chest his anxious heart was
[1:04:46] beating.
[1:04:49] All at once she caught his eyes. From
[1:04:53] his lips the bids were high. She could
[1:04:57] not believe the voice that she could
[1:05:01] hear
[1:05:03] when he through judgement take her life
[1:05:07] forever and his pain and strife. What
[1:05:11] would happen as she saw him drawing near
[1:05:16] her?
[1:05:20] I've come to take you home.
[1:05:27] I know that you've done wrong.
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:34] But through you, I give my life. Through
[1:05:38] the sorrow, pain, and strife, I couldn't
[1:05:42] let you go.
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:48] Let's leave the past behind.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Love conquers one more time.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He took her hand and said, "There's a
[1:06:06] new day just ahead. I've come to take
[1:06:11] you home.
[1:06:18] Now I've stood in that same place, bound
[1:06:22] by sin, a broken slave. From the depths
[1:06:26] of my despair, I pray for mercy.
[1:06:32] I heard his word, the price was paid on
[1:06:36] the cross for you that day. Take my hand
[1:06:40] now, child, and welcome to the family.
[1:06:45] [Music]
[1:06:48] I've come to take you home.
[1:06:55] I know that you've done wrong,
[1:07:02] but for you I give my life. Through the
[1:07:06] sorrow, pain, and strife, I couldn't let
[1:07:11] you go.
[1:07:14] [Music]
[1:07:16] Let's leave the past behind.

[1:07:23] Love conquers one more time.
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He took my hand and said, "There's a new
[1:07:34] day just ahead. I've come to take you
[1:07:39] home."
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:46] Now I've stood in that same place, bound
[1:07:49] by sin, a broken slave. From the depths
[1:07:54] of my despair, I prayed for mercy.
[1:07:59] I heard those words, the price was paid
[1:08:03] on the cross for you that day. Take my
[1:08:07] hand now, child, and welcome to the
[1:08:11] family.
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:16] I've come to take you home.
[1:08:23] I know that you've done wrong,
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; but for you I gave my life through the
[1:08:34] sorrow, pain, and strife. I couldn't let
[1:08:38] you go.
[1:08:42] Hallelujah.
[1:08:43] And let's leave the past behind.
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:50] Love conquers one more time.
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:57] He took my hand and said, "There's a new
[1:09:01] day just ahead. I've come to take you
[1:09:06] home.
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:11] I've come to take you home.
[1:09:18] I know that you've done wrong,

[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:45] Love conquers one more time.
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; He took my hand and said, "There's a new
[1:09:56] day just ahead. I've come to take you
[1:10:01] home."
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:06] He took my hand and said, "There's a new
[1:10:10] day just ahead. I've come to take you
[1:10:15] home."
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Beautiful job.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:32] Thank you, Ben and Kendra. Wonderful,
[1:10:35] wonderful job. Would you stand with us
[1:10:39] today as we're
[1:10:41] preparing our hearts
[1:10:44] even more for the
[1:10:46] word of the Lord that wants to come
[1:10:48] forth today,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we bless you.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; We bless you, Lord, for you are good.
[1:10:57] And we thank you for the plan of
[1:10:59] redemption. We thank you that you loved
[1:11:02] us, God. You loved us when even when we
[1:11:06] were in sin
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; when we had failed you.
[1:11:14] But I thank you that you loved us. Thank
[1:11:17] you, Lord. He was on the cross. I was
[1:11:22] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:11:24] Hallelujah.
[1:11:27] Hallelujah.
[1:11:30] I'm not on
[1:11:33] an ego trip. I'm nothing
[1:11:38] on
[1:11:39] my own.
[1:11:43] I make mistakes.
[1:11:46] I often slip.
[1:11:49] I'm just common flesh
[1:11:52] and bone.
[1:11:56] But I'll prove someday
[1:11:59] just what I say.
[1:12:02] I'm of a special
[1:12:06] kind.
[1:12:09] When he was on the cross,
[1:12:16] I was on his mind.
[1:12:21] Oh, he knew
[1:12:25] me
[1:12:28] yet he loved
[1:12:32] me.
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:37] He whose glory
[1:12:40] makes the heaven shine.
[1:12:48] so unworthy
[1:12:55] of such mercy.
[1:13:02] Yet when he was on the cross,
[1:13:10] I was on his mind.
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:19] Yes, he knew
[1:13:22] me.
[1:13:25] Yet he loved
[1:13:29] me.
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:34] He whose glory
[1:13:37] makes
[1:13:39] heaven shine.
[1:13:45] Go unworthy.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; So unworthy
[1:13:52] of
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. God bless you. Love
[1:13:56] you.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:13:59] when he was on the cross,
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; I was on his mind. One more time. Yes,
[1:14:13] he knew me.
[1:14:16] Don't forget about what you're singing.
[1:14:17] Think of it. Yet he loved me.
[1:14:24] He whose glory
[1:14:28] whose glory
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; the heaven
[1:14:34] shine.
[1:14:36] Yes, it does.
[1:14:39] So
[1:14:40] unworthy.
[1:14:45] Ah such mercy.
[1:14:51] Yet
[1:14:53] when he
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; was on the cross,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I
[1:15:02] was on his mind.
[1:15:08] Aren't you glad? If you're glad, give
[1:15:11] the Lord a praise.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He wants to hear your voice.
[1:15:17] Lift up your voice to the Lord.
[1:15:22] Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] Hallelujah.
[1:15:27] You may be seated. Even if it's not your
[1:15:30] comfort zone, it's a great opportunity
[1:15:33] when the when when the preacher or the
[1:15:37] worship leader or the service leader
[1:15:39] says, "Lift up." Oh, lift up your voice.
[1:15:42] What a great opportunity it is to
[1:15:44] stretch out of your comfort zone.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And and uh if you're like me, you don't
[1:15:50] really like to hear your voice,
[1:15:51] especially if it's recorded. But uh he
[1:15:55] loves to hear it. Yes.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; So, even if you don't love to hear your
[1:15:58] voice, it'll be lost in the in the crowd
[1:16:01] to others, but he'll hear it.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He will hear it.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; I've told you many times through the
[1:16:08] years about uh our wonderful experiences
[1:16:12] in Jerusalem. Um on Shabbat, the day
[1:16:17] before the Sabbath, everyone goes out.
[1:16:20] the the refrigerators are by design
[1:16:23] smaller like European size and so the
[1:16:27] people depend on fresh vegetables and
[1:16:30] fresh meat and sometimes never frozen
[1:16:34] and so they go out on Friday morning
[1:16:38] early and mom is home getting things
[1:16:40] ready and dad often it's dad that takes
[1:16:45] the children and uh if you know anything
[1:16:48] about the ultraorththodox Jewish
[1:16:50] community, you will know that they uh
[1:16:54] really take serious Jonathan the the
[1:16:58] quiver thing.
[1:17:01] They fill their quiver and then they
[1:17:02] start working on somebody else's quiver.
[1:17:05] And so there may be 8 10 children coming
[1:17:08] along behind there. And uh Israelis are
[1:17:12] abrupt
[1:17:14] uh somewhat rude by nature. It's a
[1:17:17] Middle Eastern sort of thing. And uh you
[1:17:22] will hear a million schle which means
[1:17:25] excuse me, but it's supposed to be a
[1:17:28] polite way of saying pardon me. But I
[1:17:30] want you to know if you've never heard
[1:17:31] an Israeli say it in a hurry. You need
[1:17:35] to hear it because it feels like you're
[1:17:37] being cussed out, not pardon me. It can
[1:17:41] be so aggressive and the little children
[1:17:43] get separated and and Brother West
[1:17:46] always hated when we told but it's the
[1:17:49] truth. He got a little separated from us
[1:17:51] one time and we had to find him. And in
[1:17:53] the midst of that crowd of pushing and
[1:17:55] shoving, dad's got a big bouquet of
[1:17:58] flowers for the Shabbat table and the
[1:18:00] little kids are hearing the sounds and
[1:18:03] they're just lost and may may not even
[1:18:05] know where they are. But all of a sudden
[1:18:07] in that loud hustle and bustle, there
[1:18:11] may be a merchant who's screaming out
[1:18:13] for his sale. All that going on at one
[1:18:16] time, and there'll be a little voice
[1:18:18] that says, "Aba, aba, aba." He's
[1:18:22] calling, "Daddy, daddy." And you would
[1:18:25] think that nobody would hear that in the
[1:18:27] crowd, but but daddy does
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; because he he knows the voice of his
[1:18:34] little one. Any other day of the week,
[1:18:37] it might be mama. And the little child
[1:18:38] will say, "Emma, imma." And boy, she
[1:18:42] stops what she's doing right away,
[1:18:44] especially in troublesome times. And
[1:18:46] when is it not troublesome in Israel?
[1:18:49] And they stop what they're doing. and
[1:18:51] and uh even even rude, pushy Israelis
[1:18:56] know that that's an emergency moment and
[1:18:59] they just melt. They're just as polite
[1:19:01] and calm and to step out of the way so
[1:19:04] that that dad and and little one can be
[1:19:07] reunited. And and I I I thought this is
[1:19:10] the most wonderful thing I've ever seen
[1:19:12] in my life. Jesus said, "I am the good
[1:19:15] shepherd
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; and the sheep know my voice
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; and the stranger, a stranger they will
[1:19:21] not follow. They know the voice of the
[1:19:24] Lord."
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And that blesses me today. I'm blessed
[1:19:27] to be in his presence. When you create
[1:19:30] an atmosphere like you did during
[1:19:32] worship, it puts us all in a in a hard
[1:19:35] position to have to try to make an
[1:19:37] announcement like Brother Gley was
[1:19:39] making this morning. And I felt very
[1:19:41] sorry for for Ben and Kendra, but having
[1:19:44] to get up and sing after that because I
[1:19:47] knew there were quite a few people
[1:19:48] thinking, "Oh my goodness, my my
[1:19:52] who knows what. My vitamin L is coming
[1:19:57] next week
[1:20:00] and they get all in a panic and and
[1:20:03] you're probably not even hearing me now
[1:20:06] because you're worried about it." Uh,
[1:20:09] brother Greley doesn't know the half of
[1:20:10] it because he's not here during the week
[1:20:12] he's working. But, uh, if he were here,
[1:20:15] he would know that there are days when
[1:20:17] there are 12 packages sitting at the
[1:20:19] front door of the church. And we've told
[1:20:21] them uh, before maybe it's better that
[1:20:24] you just leave them here because if not,
[1:20:27] they go down, they get stuck, they
[1:20:30] it's it's just sort of a a mess. But
[1:20:32] we'll get through. Uh, pardon. Uh, I
[1:20:36] like those signs that say, "Pardon our
[1:20:38] progress."
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel sent me a text like that
[1:20:41] on Friday afternoon and he said, "I hope
[1:20:44] that our how did you say it? I hope that
[1:20:46] our progress will not disturb you." Um,
[1:20:50] he thought I may maybe he thought I
[1:20:52] would come out of here on Friday and I
[1:20:54] think, "Oh, half done. What a what what
[1:20:56] what a shame." But no, I came out and I
[1:20:59] said, "Oh my goodness, that is amazing."
[1:21:04] And uh but anyway, God's doing so many
[1:21:07] things. I couldn't tell them all, but
[1:21:10] he's worthy.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; He's here now. Even now, I was going to
[1:21:15] finish by saying that Ben and Kendra, uh
[1:21:18] regardless of the of the turmoil in the
[1:21:20] house, they sang. Ben's voice was as
[1:21:24] clear as I've ever heard it. It was nice
[1:21:26] because it was in a good key for him.
[1:21:29] Mark that key down. Uh Ben is like a lot
[1:21:33] of aspiring singers. They all want to
[1:21:35] sing high tenor like Ernie Hos. And some
[1:21:38] are given that gift and some are are
[1:21:41] given the gift of just a beautiful lead
[1:21:44] tone. And that's what he had today. Ben
[1:21:47] uh Bendra and Benra was given that
[1:21:51] beautiful little uh harmony part, little
[1:21:54] old low harmony and uh all it needed was
[1:21:56] my tenor and it would have been an
[1:21:58] amazing song. No, there was such an
[1:22:01] anointing
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; and and it was so precious to hear him
[1:22:05] sing out. And I know that Sister Alita
[1:22:07] is sitting there thinking that's my boy.
[1:22:11] But I was sitting there thinking that's
[1:22:12] my boy. That's my girl. I felt that way
[1:22:16] today. I'm thankful for his grace.
[1:22:20] Marvelous,
[1:22:22] wonderful grace.
[1:22:26] And uh I'm not going to rush his
[1:22:28] presence.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Boy, I got a shock when I came out here
[1:22:32] and saw that brother Gregory and his
[1:22:34] family was uh in a different spot.
[1:22:37] I did like that. I don't know if you saw
[1:22:39] me or not. Uh you know, it's a good
[1:22:42] thing to mix it up sometime. And you
[1:22:44] better be preparing yourself for it
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; because we're believing that God's going
[1:22:49] to fill the house during camp meeting
[1:22:52] time. This has been one of the This has
[1:22:54] been an extremely busy week on multiple
[1:22:56] levels. And uh I I was going to thank
[1:23:00] brother Daniel, but I'm and the and I
[1:23:02] was going to say his wife, Sister Anna,
[1:23:05] and Brother Austin and Anna and Gile was
[1:23:07] here and I think maybe I was here and
[1:23:10] Gwen and I don't know how much digging
[1:23:13] Isaiah did, but uh they were all
[1:23:15] helping. I appreciate that. And then
[1:23:18] yesterday evening, what has gone on in
[1:23:20] the fellowship hall is an amazing thing.
[1:23:23] Uh people were getting some problems
[1:23:25] with their shoes and their clothes
[1:23:27] because there was a tremendous amount of
[1:23:29] dust under there that had collected in
[1:23:32] the even before the walls uh went up.
[1:23:35] You pour the concrete and all the dust
[1:23:37] comes blowing across there. You don't
[1:23:40] necessarily look at the floor and see
[1:23:42] red, but that's the color of what dirt
[1:23:44] was on there. It's that red dust and um
[1:23:48] it was it was becoming very difficult
[1:23:50] and uh charity got on it and they rented
[1:23:54] a a a machine that was no good much but
[1:23:58] you know God sent brother Truman and
[1:24:00] Brother Robert at just the right time.
[1:24:02] They weren't coming here for that. They
[1:24:03] didn't probably know what was going on
[1:24:04] maybe, but they figured out the machine
[1:24:07] the best they could. And uh folks got in
[1:24:10] and scrubbed and worked. And Stacy said
[1:24:13] when Josiah got in there, they were they
[1:24:15] were he was getting up more dirt. He was
[1:24:16] putting the elbow grease to it. And
[1:24:19] whatever you did and then and then
[1:24:21] Friday night, we interrupted the young
[1:24:23] people uh their little gathering uh
[1:24:26] toward the end and they emptied out the
[1:24:28] place had everything had to come out.
[1:24:31] And these are extra things that go on
[1:24:35] during the course of a week that don't
[1:24:36] make the app. They don't always make the
[1:24:38] website. But folks are busy getting
[1:24:41] ready because we feel like that doing
[1:24:44] physical things sometime is also a form
[1:24:48] of spiritual preparation.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Do you need a biblical examples? Uh dig
[1:24:53] ditches
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm going to fill them up.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That was physical work to prepare for a
[1:24:59] spiritual release. Isn't that right? Go
[1:25:02] borrow vessels. Borrow not a few.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. Fill them up. Bring them in
[1:25:06] here. God's going to make a way. And so
[1:25:08] many times in scripture, we see uh
[1:25:11] physical things. Um you know, there
[1:25:14] nobody really enjoys digging the the
[1:25:16] roots of grass.
[1:25:19] Where we want grass to grow, it doesn't
[1:25:20] want to grow. It wants to grow in the
[1:25:22] flower beds. And when we tell you grass,
[1:25:24] we're not talking about the kind you
[1:25:25] just pluck up a few blades at a time.
[1:25:27] We're talking about the kind that has
[1:25:28] runners on it. And if you don't break
[1:25:30] them, they're they can be 12 feet long
[1:25:32] underground. And it's a lot of work.
[1:25:35] Nobody wants to do it. But there's
[1:25:37] something so spiritual about it because
[1:25:40] God loves gardens.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; And uh I was reading a prophetic word
[1:25:45] that came here during one of the camp
[1:25:47] meetings many years ago. I was reading
[1:25:49] it this week and and and God said, "If
[1:25:52] you will let me walk through your
[1:25:54] garden,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; I will let you walk with me through
[1:25:57] mine.
[1:26:00] Now, who wouldn't want to get in on
[1:26:02] that?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; If you'll let me come in
[1:26:06] and and make some changes in your
[1:26:08] garden,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; I'll bring you to mine and let you walk
[1:26:11] with me. I tell you, it's powerful. I
[1:26:13] loved it.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And sometime digging a root out and and
[1:26:16] and freshing a flower bed is a spiritual
[1:26:20] act. It's a physical act with hard work,
[1:26:22] but it has a spiritual implication.
[1:26:25] Uh if you pick up a piece of trash,
[1:26:27] that's a physical effort, but it's a
[1:26:29] spiritual. It it it speaks prophetically
[1:26:32] of preparing and cleaning and repentance
[1:26:34] and a time of of scouring out. Somebody
[1:26:38] said, "Aren't you getting a little
[1:26:39] carried away not even getting started
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; because uh I believe we are a prophetic
[1:26:46] class of people."
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; And uh I believed that before I read it
[1:26:50] in the church age book. So it has to be
[1:26:52] so. We're a prophetic class of people
[1:26:55] and uh that means that God deals with us
[1:26:58] in parabolic ways
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; and it means that even our suffering can
[1:27:02] be a parable. We just covered that,
[1:27:04] didn't we? And so we should expect we
[1:27:06] should expect I'm trying now to get the
[1:27:08] message out of uh uh Zach burning his
[1:27:12] hand on the frying pan making breakfast.
[1:27:15] I'm trying to get the prophetic word in
[1:27:18] that. It hadn't hit me yet, but it'll
[1:27:20] come.
[1:27:22] Don't try don't go up to him and harass
[1:27:24] him. Uh but there is a me there's a
[1:27:27] message in many things that we look
[1:27:29] over. Uh God is here.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; This is an exciting time.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; You need to be here.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You need to meet him every day.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; But two little times a week, just twice
[1:27:41] we we open the church for a service and
[1:27:43] be here if you possibly can. Um it means
[1:27:46] a lot to us. It means something to the
[1:27:49] Lord. Yes,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; it really does.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us, brother Brandham
[1:27:54] tells us so many times that we should uh
[1:27:58] not forsake our our post of duty.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And uh there's little Megan uh sister
[1:28:04] short person in the hospital today and
[1:28:06] she always sends a note when she's not
[1:28:08] going to be here. Always says um I'm not
[1:28:11] going to be at my post of duty today,
[1:28:13] but I'll be streaming. And I never
[1:28:15] expected to get one from her today. But
[1:28:17] the first text of the morning was from
[1:28:19] sister I won't be at my post of duty but
[1:28:21] I'll be praying and I'll be streaming.
[1:28:24] Um streaming is wonderful but it was
[1:28:27] never designed to take the place of
[1:28:30] fellowship and corporate anointing.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And so we need to be mindful. I want you
[1:28:35] to be here every Sunday that you
[1:28:36] possibly can be between now and camp
[1:28:38] meeting if possible. And I want you to
[1:28:41] be preparing with prayer and as brother
[1:28:43] Gley said today, repentance and uh
[1:28:46] getting in proper alignment with
[1:28:48] whatever God wants to do for us.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I have noticed through the years that
[1:28:52] one of the most important services of
[1:28:54] the year is the Sunday before camp
[1:28:58] meeting starts. I could give you
[1:29:00] examples, but it would take a lot of
[1:29:01] time. It's unfortunate that there's
[1:29:04] going to be a wedding in the Indiana
[1:29:05] community. And I know that some of you
[1:29:08] absolutely have to be there. But I'm
[1:29:10] going to ask the rest of you who do not
[1:29:13] absolutely have to be there to be here
[1:29:16] at your post of duty during such an
[1:29:19] important time. Whatever God does in
[1:29:22] that Sunday before, it sets a tone.
[1:29:27] I don't need amens.
[1:29:30] I love them, but I don't have to have
[1:29:32] them. I know I just let air out of the
[1:29:34] balloon.
[1:29:36] Kind of like an Amazon announcement,
[1:29:39] but I mean it. I'm asking you as a voice
[1:29:44] uh and maybe you'd at least pray into
[1:29:46] it. Uh you can send your regrets.
[1:29:50] You can uh give a bigger gift to the
[1:29:54] couple. They are fully aware that camp
[1:29:56] meeting is a very very important time
[1:29:59] for us and this may be one of the most
[1:30:01] important ones that we've ever had.
[1:30:03] There's an eclectic group of people from
[1:30:05] across the country who have uh let us
[1:30:08] know that they're going to be here and
[1:30:11] uh we've heard from today that sister
[1:30:13] Helga's coming from Iceland and and
[1:30:15] others and we we don't know where all
[1:30:17] they're coming from but we know that it
[1:30:19] is up to us to get things ready for them
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; in the natural and in the spiritual.
[1:30:26] Now, if you want a church, Cascade
[1:30:29] Hills, I'm told, is a wonderful place
[1:30:33] for an hour service on Sunday. They have
[1:30:36] a fully staffed nursery and they have a
[1:30:40] playground and they have a coffee shop
[1:30:42] and I don't know what all else they
[1:30:44] have. And I hear that Highlands up here
[1:30:46] and community church in Opaikica. I hear
[1:30:49] that they have coolers that are stocked
[1:30:53] with soda pop for the kids. Who wouldn't
[1:30:56] want to go and have soda pop at church?
[1:30:59] Uh they've got all kinds of programs for
[1:31:01] all kinds of ages and uh they will treat
[1:31:04] you so many ways you'll you'll be bound
[1:31:07] to like one of them. Do you understand?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; But this is not just that.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; We're here by a commission,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; a divine commission. God sent us here
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; and we're here for a reason and that
[1:31:23] reason supersedes
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; it absolutely is higher than any other
[1:31:29] obligation that we have in this life.
[1:31:32] And if you want to know how Jesus felt
[1:31:34] about it, open the Gospels.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He'll tell you.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let the dead bury the dead.
[1:31:40] You follow me."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Interesting. Somebody said, "Well, I
[1:31:44] bought a piece of land. I need to go
[1:31:46] look at it." He said, ' Do you really?
[1:31:48] Who buys a piece of land and doesn't
[1:31:49] look at it? Follow me.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Perhaps a tax collector said the I'm
[1:31:57] working for the Romans. They'll take my
[1:31:59] head off if I'm not where I'm supposed
[1:32:01] to be. Can't you trust me? Then come
[1:32:04] follow me.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; This is not Old Testament. That's
[1:32:08] gospel. That is the gospel.
[1:32:12] Now, uh I would only say something like
[1:32:14] that because of this hour and what we
[1:32:18] feel and see that the Lord is doing. And
[1:32:20] I loved it. The beautiful reel. Did uh
[1:32:22] Anna Christine do that? Is that Anna
[1:32:24] Christine wherever you are? That was
[1:32:26] absolutely outstanding yesterday.
[1:32:29] Beautiful reel that went out and I feel
[1:32:32] that way. You You're not going to want
[1:32:33] to miss. You're not going to want to
[1:32:35] miss what God's doing between now and
[1:32:38] then. That that preparation that's going
[1:32:40] on. And uh so I'm going to ask you to be
[1:32:43] as mindful as you possibly can,
[1:32:45] sensitive to the spirit.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; What if I were to go around the room and
[1:32:49] ask
[1:32:51] uh who prays about Now I know that there
[1:32:54] I I recognize that in here. I know for
[1:32:56] sure that there are some trips that are
[1:32:58] planned and I understand that and I'm
[1:33:00] not even addressing that. if you've
[1:33:03] already done your thing. I'm just
[1:33:04] talking about sometimes when there's a a
[1:33:07] wedding event or whatever that you know,
[1:33:09] everybody just wants to jump in and and
[1:33:12] and and make it a weekend away. Well,
[1:33:14] that would have been perfect the maybe
[1:33:16] even the weekend before. Might be all
[1:33:18] right the weekend after, but when we're
[1:33:21] getting ready to move where we believe
[1:33:24] God's trying to move us, uh we need
[1:33:27] everybody pulling. Now, if you're going
[1:33:29] to be here and pout, just go
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; cuz we don't need pouters.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; We need somebody pulling.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I know that we're
[1:33:37] accustomed to pulling twice a week, but
[1:33:40] some of us have to pull every day.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Every day we have to pull to create an
[1:33:45] atmosphere. This don't drop down on our
[1:33:48] heads like ripe cherries from a tree.
[1:33:51] And there's some of you that have some
[1:33:52] very sentimental planned trips and
[1:33:55] things uh uh maybe for a week. And I
[1:33:57] understand that. And I'm not I'm not uh
[1:33:59] hitting on that. Uh but I'm just saying
[1:34:02] that this is an important hour and we
[1:34:05] need to be uh present in in spirit, not
[1:34:08] only in physical body.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you that as your pastor. I
[1:34:12] know that people really would rather
[1:34:14] have um an old doting grandfather in the
[1:34:18] pull pit. I understand. But you didn't
[1:34:21] get that.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I wasn't born to be that. Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Um, and so I'm just trying to do the
[1:34:29] best I can with what I have to offer.
[1:34:32] And I want to give him everything.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Absolutely everything.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; And if that means I miss out on some
[1:34:38] fellowship, then so be it. If that means
[1:34:40] I have to miss out on some things, then
[1:34:43] I I'll just I'll just miss out. Uh
[1:34:45] because I really want to stay in the
[1:34:47] channel. My My first reaction when he
[1:34:50] says you you won't be able to access
[1:34:51] your office for three days is I'm
[1:34:53] thinking I'll have to get a mattress.
[1:34:57] because it's not just book work to me.
[1:35:02] Uh I'm here and I know you can meet him
[1:35:04] everywhere, but there's no place to meet
[1:35:06] him any better than where he said I'm
[1:35:10] going to meet you.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; That's a pretty that's a pretty
[1:35:14] important place for me to be. And uh uh
[1:35:17] oh, if you could see the things that
[1:35:19] walk by the window, I if you could if
[1:35:22] you could see the things sometime and
[1:35:24] feel and hear and sense what goes on on
[1:35:27] these grounds. And the Lord dealt with
[1:35:29] my heart over a year ago that he was
[1:35:32] going to sanctify and set apart this
[1:35:34] land again for his name. And I'm
[1:35:37] believing that this is the season. Let's
[1:35:40] stand and go to the word. Thank you,
[1:35:41] musicians. I thought at one time I might
[1:35:44] would have a song, but I think it's
[1:35:46] better to go on now. And uh I don't even
[1:35:49] think there's a song that could correct
[1:35:51] this what I've done.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Now, if anybody could, y'all could
[1:35:57] turn in your Bible, if you will,
[1:36:01] uh to
[1:36:03] let's go to the New Testament here just
[1:36:05] a moment. Um, I probably will not be
[1:36:11] going exactly where I had hoped to go.
[1:36:17] It might even take me just a moment
[1:36:19] because I I grabbed some fresh notes
[1:36:22] here and I didn't really take time. We
[1:36:27] want to welcome everyone of the visitors
[1:36:30] uh that are streaming. Uh there are some
[1:36:33] I'm I'm not I shouldn't have said
[1:36:35] visitors, streamers, faithful faithful
[1:36:39] streamers. And I've been noticing and I
[1:36:41] didn't want to call this out, but I want
[1:36:44] to say to Sister Sarah in Indiana, uh
[1:36:49] from the bottom of my heart, everybody
[1:36:52] doesn't know you and know who you are.
[1:36:54] There's a few of us who do, but I want
[1:36:56] you to know how much it means to me when
[1:36:58] I see that you're watching. It touches
[1:37:02] my heart. In fact, I've sat down a
[1:37:04] couple times recently, prayed for you
[1:37:06] and and wept thinking about good old
[1:37:10] memories from way way back. And and I I
[1:37:13] don't like to, you know, if someone is
[1:37:16] just sort of wanting to be anonymous,
[1:37:18] well, I don't want to do anything to
[1:37:19] disturb that. But when she was bold
[1:37:21] enough to put her name and and her city,
[1:37:24] well, I wanted to tell you that we we
[1:37:26] really really love you and we really
[1:37:28] appreciate you watching this service
[1:37:31] today and and you're and you've been
[1:37:33] streaming faithful and it means so much
[1:37:35] to us. I haven't yet had a chance to
[1:37:37] speak to sister uh Isabelle about it,
[1:37:40] but I will. I want her to know that that
[1:37:43] you're joining us. Let's go to uh the
[1:37:47] book of uh I don't know where I'm going.
[1:37:51] Let's go to um
[1:37:55] uh where will we go?
[1:37:57] I'll get there in a minute. Luke 22.
[1:37:59] There we go. Praise the Lord. Luke 22
[1:38:04] and verse 19. And he took bread
[1:38:07] and gave thanks
[1:38:10] and break it. And I know they didn't
[1:38:11] have time to find that. and gave unto
[1:38:15] them, saying, "This is my
[1:38:21] Are you with me?
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; This is my body which is given for you.
[1:38:27] This do
[1:38:30] in remembrance of me." Was that his
[1:38:34] body? Not in the natural, but it
[1:38:38] represented his body. Now go to John 13
[1:38:41] verse four and 5. And I'll read it
[1:38:44] quickly and you can rest your bones.
[1:38:47] He riseth from supper and laid aside his
[1:38:51] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:38:54] himself. After that he pth water into a
[1:38:58] basin and began to wash his disciples
[1:39:03] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:39:08] wherewith he was girded. Would you pray
[1:39:12] with me for just a moment? Father, how
[1:39:14] we thank you today that your word is not
[1:39:19] just a historical record or some sweet
[1:39:24] story. It is life to us. There are many,
[1:39:30] many layers and many applications to
[1:39:33] everything that we read. And you, my
[1:39:36] Lord, are our greatest example. May we
[1:39:39] find help today as we look to the
[1:39:42] Gospels. There are so many places that
[1:39:45] we can go in scripture, but there's
[1:39:48] something about red letters that thrills
[1:39:51] all of us because we know that to the
[1:39:54] best of the record, these are your
[1:39:55] words. To your disciples, to those who
[1:39:58] followed you in your earthly ministry,
[1:40:01] Lord, make us disciples in the hour
[1:40:04] where we are living now, in the century
[1:40:06] that we're now living in. May we be the
[1:40:09] talmadem of the Lord. May we be the
[1:40:12] disciples of the Lord. Uh many people
[1:40:14] would maybe prefer to be just a
[1:40:16] churchgoer. But Lord, there is a remnant
[1:40:19] of people around the world who want to
[1:40:21] be way more than just a churchgoer. We
[1:40:24] didn't come here today to see what the
[1:40:26] church could offer us. We came here
[1:40:28] today to see what you had. And we came
[1:40:30] here to bless you and to glorify your
[1:40:33] name and to worship you. Now, I know
[1:40:36] Lord that uh I have uh maybe said
[1:40:39] something that has stung somebody. May
[1:40:42] they find grace. I I truly believe that
[1:40:45] if they'd have been hearing you, I
[1:40:47] wouldn't have had to say it in the first
[1:40:48] place. But sometimes it is our
[1:40:51] responsibility and our pleasure to to
[1:40:55] share your heart with someone who may
[1:40:58] not be thinking in that moment in the
[1:41:01] same manner. I know that there are
[1:41:04] people who truly believe that these
[1:41:07] things matter nothing but watching the
[1:41:09] pattern of scripture. I know how
[1:41:11] important it is for me to be where I am
[1:41:14] to be in that right moment. I don't want
[1:41:17] to be three days late. I want to be
[1:41:19] right on time. And I believe there's a
[1:41:21] hungryhearted people uh who desire to be
[1:41:24] right in the center of your will. Now
[1:41:27] Lord, help me to preach above the
[1:41:29] emotions of the people and we'll give
[1:41:31] you glory, honor, and praise for it's in
[1:41:34] the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:36] we pray. And the saints said,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; "Amen." We're we would ask you to have
[1:41:41] your seat. You feel free to be seated.
[1:41:45] We're going to continue for just a
[1:41:47] little while on these prophetic acts of
[1:41:51] scripture. Uh really, I was preaching
[1:41:54] before I took a text. We're talking
[1:41:56] about the flower bed. We're talking
[1:41:59] about even the littlest thing that you
[1:42:01] do, you do it as unto the Lord. I don't
[1:42:05] know about you, but I tell him why I'm
[1:42:06] doing it.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm doing this for you. I'm doing
[1:42:10] this for your glory. I I'm doing this
[1:42:13] that you would receive the honor.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; And it may be menial. It may be
[1:42:17] physical, but I'm doing it unto you,
[1:42:19] Lord. And when we can have that kind of
[1:42:22] a goal in mind, I want to do something
[1:42:24] that brings the Lord's pleasure and
[1:42:27] brings furtherance to his work. He sees
[1:42:30] it whether anybody else sees it or not.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he sees it? everything
[1:42:34] you've bought a and placed and put in
[1:42:37] place. Whether it was the handle of a
[1:42:40] toilet, whether it was a stopper on a
[1:42:42] sink, whether it was a piece on a a
[1:42:46] lawnmower, uh whatever you have done, a
[1:42:49] refrigerator appears, whatever you've
[1:42:53] done, and you just did it not caring
[1:42:56] whether anybody knew you did it or not.
[1:42:58] You didn't need a plaque with your name
[1:43:00] on it or a brick with your name engraved
[1:43:02] on it. you did it is unto the Lord. God
[1:43:05] sees it.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, he sees it.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; And he knows. It's not wrong to turn in
[1:43:12] a receipt. By the way, if you do
[1:43:15] something like that and you bring us a
[1:43:16] receipt, we will write you a check. We
[1:43:19] we certainly will do that. But God sees
[1:43:23] what you do.
[1:43:24] uh uh brother man so many times has
[1:43:27] bought parts and and and and fixed
[1:43:29] things and and uh took no money or maybe
[1:43:33] even he did it a few times I didn't even
[1:43:35] know it was done so I couldn't offer him
[1:43:37] any money but we're doing what we do
[1:43:40] many times under the Lord and I don't
[1:43:41] ever want you to think that he doesn't
[1:43:43] see it he keeps a record if you believe
[1:43:45] that say amen and he knows and if you're
[1:43:48] never available to help why don't you
[1:43:50] free yourself up a little bit
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; and help us
[1:43:53] Amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody at the last minute on Friday
[1:43:57] said, "I've got to go to Lraange and
[1:43:59] pick up that machine. I'm got to get
[1:44:01] somebody to go with me and and pick it
[1:44:03] up." Well, that was unexpected. We
[1:44:05] didn't know it was going to turn out
[1:44:06] that way. It did. We got to learn to be
[1:44:08] fluid. And uh the Lord gave me a
[1:44:11] scripture, but I won't take time to
[1:44:13] share that with you right now, but I'll
[1:44:14] just paraphrase it. He talked about th
[1:44:17] those that are his and how they would be
[1:44:19] willing and how they would gladly
[1:44:23] volunteer
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; in the in his day
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; when God is doing something he would
[1:44:29] raise up his sons and they would
[1:44:31] willingly vol in the in the New American
[1:44:34] Standard says something like willingly
[1:44:36] volunteer uh to do to be a part uh not
[1:44:40] because they just want the reward but
[1:44:43] because they want the blessing of
[1:44:44] knowing I found something that I can do
[1:44:47] for the King of Kings
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords. Every floor you
[1:44:52] vacuumed, every baseboard you wiped, God
[1:44:55] sees it.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; These are acts of service unto the Lord.
[1:44:59] You believe that?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus wasn't giving them his
[1:45:02] physical body. The the Catholic doctrine
[1:45:06] that teaches that the bread becomes the
[1:45:09] body and the wine or juice becomes the
[1:45:12] blood. It's error. And that's never what
[1:45:15] God intended and it's not what Jesus was
[1:45:18] even saying. A in fact it's kind of a
[1:45:21] dangerous thing to even participate in
[1:45:24] that kind of a communion because there
[1:45:26] are spirits attached to it.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; I told you many times that when brother
[1:45:31] Brandham was off the scene, the full
[1:45:33] gospel businessmen, they got loose. They
[1:45:35] were loose all along. Let's not be let's
[1:45:37] not be blind. They were loose all along.
[1:45:41] They were just an avenue that God was
[1:45:43] using to help the message get out. Uh
[1:45:45] but they were certainly not conservative
[1:45:48] in nature. Many of them cruel, very very
[1:45:51] crooked in fact. But God used it as a
[1:45:54] vehicle
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; and lives were touched and changed
[1:45:57] because of it. As soon as brother
[1:45:59] Brandon was off the scene, they they
[1:46:01] wanted to make it more ecumenical and
[1:46:03] they wanted to bring the Catholic priest
[1:46:05] in to speak at the annual convention and
[1:46:08] they did one year and uh he was going to
[1:46:10] preach on how the church needed to be
[1:46:13] one and and they do. If the if the word
[1:46:16] is the is the post
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; if the plum line of God's word has
[1:46:21] dropped, then there could be unity. But
[1:46:24] if error is being held, then you've got
[1:46:27] to be a little bit careful how you join
[1:46:29] yourself to idols.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; The scripture said you you don't want to
[1:46:32] join yourself to idols.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; You want to be careful about how you
[1:46:36] partake in things like that. And so they
[1:46:38] were going to have a interdenominational
[1:46:41] communion service. And uh oh, the
[1:46:45] Pentecostals, they were so happy about
[1:46:46] it. The charismatics, they were so happy
[1:46:48] about it. Everybody was so thrilled. And
[1:46:50] um but there was one person
[1:46:54] And guess what? He was Roman Catholic
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; who stood up in that great big
[1:46:59] convention of the Full Gospel
[1:47:01] Businessman's Fellowship and he said,
[1:47:02] "Now, brethren, I love everybody here,
[1:47:04] but I need to let you know as a Roman
[1:47:06] Catholic, I believe that that bread and
[1:47:09] that wine is changed in the moment that
[1:47:11] it's blessed to the literal body of our
[1:47:13] Lord. And my faith forbids me to receive
[1:47:16] communion with anyone who does not hold
[1:47:19] that as their standard doctrine." And
[1:47:21] you know, the rest of those folks just
[1:47:22] dropped their mouth open. They couldn't
[1:47:24] believe what they saw was they were they
[1:47:26] were spineless.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; They were s they were absolutely
[1:47:33] uh had nothing to say, speechless while
[1:47:36] somebody on the other end of the
[1:47:37] spectrum stood up and said, "I have
[1:47:39] convictions."
[1:47:40] Now, if you don't think that thing is
[1:47:42] moving even in faster and greater ways
[1:47:44] toward that one universal church
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; like never before.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; And in all of that ecumenical movement,
[1:47:53] there's a little bride off the off the
[1:47:56] beaten path, not in the spotlight yet
[1:47:59] who God is preparing her. She's placed
[1:48:02] in pockets all over the world.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and uh he knows her name
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; and he knows what's going on with her
[1:48:10] and he's working on her. She's his
[1:48:12] project.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; He loves her. That bridegroom king loves
[1:48:17] her above all the women.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, he loves her and he's getting her
[1:48:22] ready for her moment.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; She's going to get a moment. She's going
[1:48:27] to have a spotlight moment. It'll be a
[1:48:30] quick one.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry you're having a hard time
[1:48:34] getting with me. Come on.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Uh, I don't regret a thing I've said.
[1:48:38] Let me just say it again. I don't regret
[1:48:40] anything that I've said. If you didn't
[1:48:43] want a pastor, I don't know why you're
[1:48:44] here.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Just be honest. Just be honest. You
[1:48:48] know, that's a wonderful thing. And we
[1:48:50] didn't wait till the church was paid off
[1:48:51] to say things like that.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; We've said that for years. We want
[1:48:56] everybody. I want all of you here. But I
[1:48:58] don't want you to be to be wounded and
[1:49:01] offended and carry that on in and hinder
[1:49:03] what God is doing.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to say, "Lord, help me and
[1:49:07] help my preacher because he's a man and
[1:49:09] he's likely to make mistakes." He just
[1:49:11] didn't make one this morning.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But he's likely to make one before he's
[1:49:15] done.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Uh this was not the real body, not the
[1:49:19] real blood. But Jesus is taking he's
[1:49:21] borrowing an element of the Passover
[1:49:24] order, the Passover seder. He's
[1:49:26] borrowing it for his purposes. And he's
[1:49:28] teaching them a lesson that will become
[1:49:31] an addition. It will become an addition
[1:49:34] to what God has already spoken through
[1:49:36] the elements of the unleavened bread and
[1:49:39] the wine. To us, it's not just a
[1:49:42] Passover.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; It's also a reminder. He said, "Best do
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; in remembrance."
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; It's in remembrance. It's a memorial. Do
[1:49:53] I have to tell you what God thinks about
[1:49:54] memorials? The Bible's full full of
[1:49:57] them, isn't it?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; He likes when we mark something that
[1:50:01] he's done.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; When we rejoice in what he's done and
[1:50:04] our faith reaches together for what he's
[1:50:07] going to do, he likes that.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; He delights in that. Are you here?
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; So, this last supper was really a
[1:50:15] prophetic act. It was really a prophecy.
[1:50:19] He is prophesying that what you have
[1:50:22] been doing year after year after year
[1:50:25] following in the feast of the Lord, the
[1:50:27] feast of Yahweh. You have been doing
[1:50:30] this dress rehearsal. You've been you've
[1:50:33] been remembering the lamb that was slain
[1:50:35] and the blood that went on the doorpost.
[1:50:38] You've been remembering the bread of
[1:50:41] haste that you had to make and you
[1:50:43] weren't allowed to have time for it to
[1:50:45] to leaven to rise. You're you're you're
[1:50:49] remembering the bitter herbs. You're
[1:50:51] remembering all of these elements. And
[1:50:53] you've been doing it year after year
[1:50:55] after year. But I'm going to add a
[1:50:57] little something here that's going to
[1:50:59] give you a prophetic glimpse of what's
[1:51:01] about to happen in the earth. The
[1:51:03] spotless lamb is about to take his
[1:51:06] place.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; The one that Abraham saw when he lifted
[1:51:11] up his eyes and looked ahead. He's about
[1:51:14] to take his place. His body is about to
[1:51:16] be broken and twisted and hang before
[1:51:18] all of you.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. And his blood is going to be
[1:51:22] shed. It's not spelt. It was shed for
[1:51:27] mankind.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; And so when you eat this bread, you are
[1:51:31] partaking of the body of the Lord
[1:51:34] because that's who you are as well. He
[1:51:36] had a physical body. He has a spiritual
[1:51:39] mystical body. That's his bride.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; You understand that? It's New Testament.
[1:51:44] Apostle Paul, first church age
[1:51:45] messenger, explained to us about the
[1:51:48] mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:51:50] He wanted them to know there's something
[1:51:53] about to shift here. And you're not
[1:51:55] going to stop remembering what I did in
[1:51:57] the Exodus. But now when you come
[1:52:00] together and you eat these things,
[1:52:02] you're going to remember my death.
[1:52:04] You're going to remember that a price
[1:52:07] has been paid for you. It was not based
[1:52:10] on your worthiness.
[1:52:12] Come on.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; It was based on fornowledge
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; and predetermined destiny
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; and it means something today. And he
[1:52:20] said it's going to mean something all
[1:52:22] the way in
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; to the millennial kingdom.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do you mean
[1:52:27] communion is going to mean something all
[1:52:28] the way into the millennial kingdom?"
[1:52:30] Well, Jesus told us that night. He said,
[1:52:32] "I'll drink no more
[1:52:34] of the fruit of the vine
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; until I drink it with you
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; in the kingdom." paraphrase in the
[1:52:41] kingdom.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; So, I tell you that's going to carry all
[1:52:45] the way through. I I believe he'll hand
[1:52:47] you a cup
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; in the millennium.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm looking forward to that.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; That's eternity.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; We're getting closer than we've ever
[1:52:58] been before.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Then he does something that's not a part
[1:53:01] of the seder at all. He There is a
[1:53:03] handwashing ritual that takes place. It
[1:53:06] It's to remind us you can't wash sin
[1:53:08] away. Just ask Pilate.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; You You can't wash away blood guiltiness
[1:53:13] with water and soap.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; But Jesus did a little bit different
[1:53:16] than what it had been done for a long
[1:53:19] time, maybe 4,000 years. Long time. Some
[1:53:22] people say two, some people say four,
[1:53:24] but anyway, a long time. And uh he did
[1:53:27] something a little different. He didn't
[1:53:29] just put the basin out for their hands
[1:53:31] to be washed and passed the basin. But
[1:53:32] the Bible said he took off his outer
[1:53:34] coat and he and he gerted himself around
[1:53:36] with a towel and he knelt down and he
[1:53:39] began to wash the disciples feet. Were
[1:53:42] their feet dirty? Probably.
[1:53:45] But they could have washed their own
[1:53:46] feet. He wasn't washing them out of
[1:53:49] necessity that day. He was washing them
[1:53:52] as a prophecy.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Well, the scripture tells us so. We just
[1:53:57] read in John 13 uh four and five. He
[1:54:01] began to wash the disciples feet and to
[1:54:04] wipe them with a towel wherewith he was
[1:54:06] girded. The son of God word in flesh
[1:54:11] stripped his garment, girded himself,
[1:54:14] washed his disciples feet in in in view
[1:54:17] of all the other disciples.
[1:54:21] Humility was exposed.
[1:54:24] the servantthood nature of the new
[1:54:27] creation was exposed.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; John 13 uh let's look at verses 12
[1:54:36] through 15. So after he had washed their
[1:54:39] feet and had taken his garments and was
[1:54:42] set down again, he said unto them, "Know
[1:54:45] ye what I have done to you?
[1:54:50] Ye call me master." This is red letter.
[1:54:52] You call me master and
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; help me. And you say, well, for so I am.
[1:54:59] If I then, your lord and master
[1:55:04] have washed your feet.
[1:55:07] Do you follow that?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Ye also ought to wash one another's
[1:55:13] feet.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; For I have given you what?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; An example. an example that you should
[1:55:19] do as I have done to you.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Well, the free will Baptists have been
[1:55:25] faithful about it.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; When the big Baptists, the big
[1:55:31] Methodists, the big churches
[1:55:34] all stopped having footwashing with
[1:55:36] their communion service, boy, the free
[1:55:39] will Baptist kept right on going. They
[1:55:40] saw it as a part of the same service.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; They preached very strongly. I went to
[1:55:46] school with a son of a free will Baptist
[1:55:49] pastor and and uh he pulled a class one
[1:55:52] day in a Bible study. How many of you go
[1:55:54] to churches where there's actual
[1:55:56] footwashing to follow communion service
[1:55:57] and there was only two of us in the room
[1:55:59] of about 50 people because most churches
[1:56:02] seem to think there's no reason for it.
[1:56:04] It's it's prophetic. It's symbolic. Uh
[1:56:07] but you know if we don't have to uh then
[1:56:10] to wash one another's feet as part of
[1:56:11] that communion service, there'd be no
[1:56:13] need to have a communion service anyway.
[1:56:15] Somebody said, "Well, we don't have a
[1:56:16] communion service." We will.
[1:56:19] I communed with him today
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; and we all get to walk out of here
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; on our feet. Not one Ananas, not one
[1:56:31] safara among us. Aren't you glad?
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; But we commune with him.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; We commune with him. And there was no
[1:56:38] review of our record.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; There's a review of our record in
[1:56:42] communion. Paul said, "So, he said,
[1:56:45] "Many of the saints
[1:56:48] are no more." Paraphrase,
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; some sleep, some are sick, some sleep.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Why?" Because they partok
[1:56:58] of this unworthily.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Not that anybody could be worthy in
[1:57:02] themselves. The key is found in the next
[1:57:04] place. Not properly discerning.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Not properly discerning what it's all
[1:57:12] about.
[1:57:13] You you you've got to understand that if
[1:57:15] there's a prophecy, there's a
[1:57:17] fulfillment and there's a message. If
[1:57:19] there's a sign, there's a voice.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; If God has us today following the
[1:57:24] example of the Lord Jesus, taking the
[1:57:27] little elements, washing one another's
[1:57:29] feet, it's saying something to us that
[1:57:32] must not be lost.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Now, the reality needs to be this
[1:57:36] church. There ought not to be a brother,
[1:57:39] if I'm a brother, not ought not to be
[1:57:41] one brother in this church that I
[1:57:44] couldn't wash his feet. That's right.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And be glad to do it.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; But he don't need his feet washed,
[1:57:53] particularly in the natural. I hope.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I hope he's not saving it up.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; But by doing that, it's a demonstration,
[1:58:04] right? It's it's me reminding myself I'm
[1:58:07] no higher, no more important than any of
[1:58:11] the brothers around me.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; We've got to learn to serve one another
[1:58:15] in all manner always.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Even when it's inconvenient,
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; which would be quite often because we
[1:58:23] all have busy lives.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. That means wives ought to get
[1:58:27] out of the way and let husbands serve.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; And husbands ought to get out of the way
[1:58:34] and let wives serve.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Well, who's going to get my dinner? Uh,
[1:58:41] you
[1:58:43] if that's what it has to be every now
[1:58:45] and again.
[1:58:47] Two pieces of loaf bread and a little
[1:58:49] mayonnaise and one of them some of that
[1:58:52] dyed yellow film they call cheese. You
[1:58:55] know the kind with the cellophane on it?
[1:58:57] It's not even cheese. Says right on it,
[1:58:59] cheese like food.
[1:59:03] Little mayonnaise. American they call
[1:59:05] it. That ought to clue you in right
[1:59:07] there. Good cheese doesn't come from
[1:59:08] America.
[1:59:10] Put a little mayonnaise on it. Put a
[1:59:11] little of that orange film stuff on it.
[1:59:14] Slap it together and do that. If your
[1:59:16] wife is is is serving the body
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; every now and again now she has a duty.
[1:59:25] Why is it so quiet?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could tell you
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; cuz the Holy Ghost hears you.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; You'll manage. My wife was over here
[1:59:37] last night serving. She said to me
[1:59:40] before I left 4:00, she said, "I can put
[1:59:43] your food together for leftovers from
[1:59:46] last night. I can put it together on a
[1:59:47] plate if you want me to, and all you
[1:59:49] have to do is heat it up." I said, "No,
[1:59:50] I can handle that. I I didn't feel like
[1:59:53] I was being mistreated because I had to
[1:59:55] make a little way for myself.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. I didn't eat as early as I
[2:00:00] probably should have because I was
[2:00:00] putting it off, you know? Well, I am I
[2:00:03] hungry? Should I really eat? Do I have
[2:00:04] to eat whatever? Probably everything
[2:00:05] will fit better tomorrow if I didn't
[2:00:07] eat, but you know how it goes.
[2:00:09] But it it blessed me to know that maybe
[2:00:12] she wasn't serving me at home, but she
[2:00:14] was doing something to serve the
[2:00:16] kingdom.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; You wives ought to feel the same way. If
[2:00:19] there's ever a chance that your husband
[2:00:21] can pull himself away from uh
[2:00:26] Frisbee, what do they call it? Disc golf
[2:00:29] or the other kind of golf. I believe
[2:00:31] Brother Brandon kind of calls it like
[2:00:33] golf or something because he talks
[2:00:35] about them knobbyby knees, you know,
[2:00:36] that you see out on those But if you if
[2:00:39] you enjoy it, then that's all right.
[2:00:40] That's up to you. No problem for me. But
[2:00:43] don't you dare,
[2:00:45] sister get upset. If he's doing
[2:00:47] something that would help the kingdom of
[2:00:49] God, we are called to be servants one to
[2:00:53] another. The Holy Ghost knows.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Some people
[2:00:58] just pull themselves back from the whole
[2:00:59] community of the church because they're
[2:01:01] afraid that if they make eye contact
[2:01:03] with anybody, somebody's going to ask
[2:01:04] them to do something.
[2:01:09] You tell people get as close as you can
[2:01:11] when you move, you know, get get over as
[2:01:12] close as you can. And you find people
[2:01:14] still, you know, 40 miles away, whatever
[2:01:17] they are, because somebody's afraid
[2:01:19] they're going to get called on. Oh my.
[2:01:22] When the squeeze moves among us,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; I don't like overnight company. I don't.
[2:01:31] I know you've got your judgments.
[2:01:35] I get it.
[2:01:37] I don't go to other people's homes
[2:01:39] unless I'm invited. I don't show up on
[2:01:41] their property unannounced. If they
[2:01:43] invite me, I may come if I can. If I if
[2:01:45] I can, I don't. And I don't let it uh
[2:01:48] grieve me to death. I don't live under
[2:01:50] that pressure. Somebody's going to have
[2:01:51] their feelings hurt. You You've got to
[2:01:53] live your life.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; I've got to live my life.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I've got to be 100% when I get up here.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; And you understand that, I hope. But I
[2:02:04] enjoy it from time to time. I enjoy
[2:02:06] fellowship. I just like for people to go
[2:02:08] home when it's time to go home. I know
[2:02:10] how to turn the lights off and say
[2:02:12] hello, folks.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:02:20] there's something to be protected.
[2:02:24] Your body, your rest, your strength.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; We don't know what we're going to be
[2:02:28] called on to do tomorrow.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; So, we got to be ready.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Do you follow what I'm saying? But when
[2:02:34] that squeeze comes down,
[2:02:36] you'll be surprised
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; how we find ourselves
[2:02:42] doing those things that have made us so
[2:02:46] uncomfortable in the past
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; simply because we're making do with what
[2:02:51] we have
[2:02:54] till rapture.
[2:02:58] We don't know how it'll look. We don't
[2:03:01] know if that'll be before or after the
[2:03:03] bride's revival. We don't really fully
[2:03:05] know the timing of all those things, but
[2:03:07] it would pay us to have a servant's
[2:03:09] heart
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; toward one another.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus was getting at something.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Do you follow that?
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure you do.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; As your master, I've washed your feet.
[2:03:22] Ye also ought to wash one another's
[2:03:24] feet. For I've given you an example that
[2:03:26] ye should do as I have done to you. It
[2:03:30] means love and serve one another. Now
[2:03:32] look at Philippians 2:5 and8. Brother
[2:03:34] Greley preaches this uh verse very well.
[2:03:37] I remember hearing him preach it. Let
[2:03:40] this mind be in you which was also in
[2:03:42] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[2:03:44] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[2:03:47] with God but made himself here's the
[2:03:49] part but made himself of no reputation
[2:03:52] and took upon him the form of a servant
[2:03:55] and was made in the likeness of men.
[2:03:59] What a blessing. And being found in
[2:04:02] fashion as a man, he humbled himself and
[2:04:05] became obedient unto death, even the
[2:04:07] death of the cross. So the very fact
[2:04:09] that our Lord was willing
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; to use these prophetic demonstrations.
[2:04:17] He was pointing to something greater
[2:04:19] than just washing feet
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; and eating soda crackers and some juice.
[2:04:26] He was pointing to what the apostle
[2:04:28] would say so eloquently here in
[2:04:30] Philippians. It was part of this
[2:04:33] condescension. It was part of this
[2:04:36] submitting himself as a servant to the
[2:04:38] father's will and as a servant to us.
[2:04:44] I tell you, he comes when I call.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever found out he
[2:04:49] comes
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; when we call?
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; He does. Now, I want you to go to Mark
[2:04:55] 11 with me just a moment.
[2:04:58] Well, praise God.
[2:05:06] Mark 11:es
[2:05:09] 12-4. I want you to know the spirit of
[2:05:12] God, he keeps a record.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; You better know it now. He keeps a
[2:05:19] record. And on the tomorrow when they
[2:05:22] were come from Bethany, he was hungry.
[2:05:26] And seeing a fig tree a far off having
[2:05:28] leaves, he came if happily he might find
[2:05:31] anything thereon. And when he came to
[2:05:34] it, he found nothing but leaves.
[2:05:40] This is a very important phrase. How
[2:05:43] about you all read the last phrase there
[2:05:45] for me? For the time of figs was not
[2:05:48] yet.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; For the time of figs was not yet. Let's
[2:05:53] go back over this again. And on the
[2:05:54] tomorrow when they were come from
[2:05:56] Bethany, he was hungry. This is in the
[2:05:58] last few days of our Lord's life. It's
[2:06:01] during the Passover of the year that our
[2:06:04] Lord was crucified. In just a few days,
[2:06:07] he will be gone from the earth. As he's
[2:06:11] moving from Bethany back into Jerusalem,
[2:06:14] he's hungry.
[2:06:16] He was still in a physical body and he
[2:06:19] saw there a fig tree a far off and he
[2:06:22] saw that it had leaves on it which was
[2:06:26] not uncommon in the time of Passover
[2:06:29] season for the early leaves to appear on
[2:06:33] the tree.
[2:06:35] Then it says but when he got there he
[2:06:37] found nothing but leaves
[2:06:40] for the time of figs was not yet.
[2:06:44] This seemed to disturb him.
[2:06:47] And Jesus answered and said unto it, "No
[2:06:51] man eat fruit of thee hereafter
[2:06:55] forever."
[2:06:57] And what does it say?
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; His disciples heard it. This was not
[2:07:03] something so private that no one saw the
[2:07:06] record.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Not one leaf curled up. Right?
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; We don't have any biblical record that
[2:07:14] in that moment anything physically
[2:07:17] changed about that tree.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham tells us uh at
[2:07:22] least one time in the message that
[2:07:25] something happened in the roots. Right?
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to know there are times that
[2:07:32] when the word of the Lord goes forth,
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; you don't see any physical visible
[2:07:39] evidence that anything has happened.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Get with me now.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody said all this uh refocus and
[2:07:49] shift and new excitement and I I don't
[2:07:52] even know what it's about. I'm not
[2:07:54] seeing anything any different than what
[2:07:56] I saw before. That's because you don't
[2:07:59] understand that the life of the tree is
[2:08:03] not up visible for everybody to see. The
[2:08:07] life of the tree is always behind the
[2:08:10] bark
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; and underneath the ground in the leaves.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Death set in
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; down in those roots. Death set in.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; It moved in. And we know that because
[2:08:28] the scripture tells us so. It tells us
[2:08:30] what happened just a few days after
[2:08:32] that.
[2:08:34] I want you to look at Matthew 21 for
[2:08:36] just a moment. I I I wish you could
[2:08:40] squeeze this and try to get something
[2:08:42] out of it.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Now in the morning, Matthew 21 18-22.
[2:08:48] Now in the morning, he returned into the
[2:08:50] city. He hungered. This is another
[2:08:52] telling. And when he saw a fig tree in
[2:08:54] the way, he came to it and found nothing
[2:08:56] there on but leaves only, and said unto
[2:08:59] it, let no fruit grow on thee
[2:09:02] henceforward forever. And presently the
[2:09:05] fig tree withered away.
[2:09:09] Now that word pres uh that word
[2:09:12] presently is
[2:09:15] to be honest with you, it's similar to
[2:09:18] the concept of suddenly.
[2:09:21] It means that something happened.
[2:09:25] It may not have been something that you
[2:09:27] could immediately physically see or the
[2:09:30] other gospel would have most likely
[2:09:32] recorded the same, but something
[2:09:35] responded.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I hope you hear that something responded
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; to the word of the Lord.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And thereafter, I don't know how long it
[2:09:46] took, but death just starts spreading
[2:09:48] up. You cut off the life and death
[2:09:51] starts spreading up.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; One night, last Monday night, uh had
[2:09:55] some limbs cut unexpectedly, bunch of
[2:09:58] limbs cut in the front and uh sick and
[2:10:02] tired of the squirrels and all the
[2:10:04] damage they do to the vehicles. And so
[2:10:06] we the bunch of limbs were cut and they
[2:10:08] lay there. The first first day they lay
[2:10:10] there, second day they lay there, they
[2:10:12] looked just like uh why you could have
[2:10:14] stuck them in the dirt and they would
[2:10:16] have they would have continued to
[2:10:17] thrive.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it didn't take
[2:10:20] too long before they recognized there
[2:10:22] was no longer any life flowing through
[2:10:25] there.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; And now you ought to see them.
[2:10:28] They've withered away.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what happened. Now, now was
[2:10:32] it fair? I want you to help me
[2:10:35] understand. Was it fair that Jesus
[2:10:38] cursed a fig tree
[2:10:41] out of season?
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know, but I got a feeling that
[2:10:47] this was prophetic.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know, but I got a feeling that
[2:10:52] there were layers and levels of messages
[2:10:56] that were being spoken
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; in front of those disciples that day.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; This wasn't out of frustration. It
[2:11:03] wasn't out of real physical hunger. It
[2:11:06] was a prophetic sign act like those of
[2:11:09] the Old Testament prophets that we
[2:11:11] mentioned Tuesday night. Jesus did it in
[2:11:14] public right there with the disciples
[2:11:16] and an earshot of anybody else traveling
[2:11:18] into the city of Jerusalem. It was
[2:11:21] judgment in action. The tree looked
[2:11:24] fruitful. It had leaves on it, but it
[2:11:27] was barren. Jesus was exposing the
[2:11:31] hypocrisy
[2:11:32] of religion. Somebody said, "How in the
[2:11:34] world is that possible?" He said, "No
[2:11:36] man eat fruit of thee hereafter
[2:11:39] forever." It's like being in the vessel
[2:11:42] of public gaze.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; The suffering, the trial, the squeeze,
[2:11:47] the problem. It's just right out there
[2:11:49] in the open for everybody to see. There
[2:11:53] must be a deeper message here. In Jewish
[2:11:56] thought, the fig tree represents often
[2:12:00] national Israel. Did you know that
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; it represents the nation's spiritual
[2:12:05] condition, especially in the Old
[2:12:08] Testament? I want you to look at Hosea 9
[2:12:11] and verse 10. I wished, oh, how I wished
[2:12:15] that you could hear what the Lord would
[2:12:17] desire to say to you this morning.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; I I'm finding myself growing a little
[2:12:22] agitated, and I don't want to do that. I
[2:12:25] want you to hear what the Lord desires
[2:12:29] to say to you.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; And if it will make you get in this
[2:12:33] service, just go.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; You hear me? Just go. Just go. Do
[2:12:38] exactly what you want to do, but don't
[2:12:43] complain.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Please, please don't complain. And don't
[2:12:48] ask for prayer when that thing that God
[2:12:51] has promised
[2:12:54] filters down
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; because you forfeited it with your
[2:12:59] stubborn will.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; This is a prophetic hour.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Saints will miss it. They will.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; There'll be those who sit here this
[2:13:07] morning and say, "Oh, I'm so I can't
[2:13:09] believe that people are going to hear
[2:13:11] this on the internet. I can't believe
[2:13:12] that people are going to hear this on
[2:13:14] Facebook." Folks,
[2:13:16] it doesn't really matter
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; in the end. We'd better be able to
[2:13:20] discern the man's voice
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; cuz this is a man standing here and what
[2:13:26] the Lord might be trying to say to us.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; You see, fig trees have a very important
[2:13:32] symbolism to the nation of Israel. And
[2:13:35] Hosea 9:10 said, "I found Israel like
[2:13:39] grapes in the wilderness." That's wild
[2:13:41] grapes. I saw your fathers. Look at this
[2:13:44] word. I saw your fathers as the first
[2:13:47] ripe. First ripe, one word, first ripe
[2:13:52] in the fig tree at her time. But they
[2:13:55] went to the elor
[2:13:59] and separated themselves under that
[2:14:01] shame. and their abominations
[2:14:04] were according
[2:14:12] the bridegroom is saying through the
[2:14:13] prophet Hosea by the way
[2:14:18] of of which we heard the song this
[2:14:20] morning. The bridegroom is saying, "I
[2:14:22] looked at Israel
[2:14:25] like the wild grapes
[2:14:27] that someone finds wandering around in
[2:14:31] the wilderness
[2:14:33] without a granola bar.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Without beef jerky, without heart
[2:14:39] attack,
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; when the when the wanderer is so
[2:14:43] exhausted
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; and physically drained, what a delight
[2:14:47] it is out in the in the wilderness.
[2:14:51] to be able to look over and see a little
[2:14:54] patch of wild grapes
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; full of natural sugar
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; and so sweet and you run over there,
[2:15:03] stagger over there and you start eating
[2:15:05] them as fast as you can. The bridegroom
[2:15:07] is saying, "I loved Israel
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; the way that a wanderer would love the
[2:15:14] the sustenance that he found in the
[2:15:17] middle of the wilderness.
[2:15:20] in the in the provision
[2:15:23] of the wild grape. And then he said,
[2:15:26] "And I saw your fathers.
[2:15:29] I loved the generation before you as the
[2:15:34] first ripe in the fig tree at her first
[2:15:38] time." Do you notice how that's being
[2:15:41] worded? as the first ripe in the fig
[2:15:45] tree at her first time. We'll get to
[2:15:50] that in a moment. Hosea
[2:15:54] is speaking on behalf of God. And God
[2:15:57] Yahweh is saying, "I long for Israel
[2:16:02] as one longs for those first sweetest
[2:16:07] figs.
[2:16:10] They are sweeter than the rest.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; The first ones are the best of the best.
[2:16:18] And this is how I long to have
[2:16:21] relationship
[2:16:23] with Israel. In Jeremiah 8:13, I will
[2:16:27] surely consume them, sayaeth the Lord.
[2:16:29] There shall be no grapes on the vine,
[2:16:32] nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
[2:16:34] shall fade, and the things that I have
[2:16:37] given them shall pass away from them.
[2:16:41] Again,
[2:16:43] it's a lover. It's a bridegroom king who
[2:16:47] is saying, "I have showered Israel with
[2:16:52] provision.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; I have made the sacrifice for those that
[2:16:57] are mine. My patience is done.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take what I have given them
[2:17:05] and feed it to others.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to find Listen, if you go on,
[2:17:12] if you go on through the prophets of the
[2:17:14] Old Testament, I'm going to go on and
[2:17:16] find a people for my name.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; The New Testament goes on to say, a
[2:17:21] people who are not a people.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; A people who are not a people. a people
[2:17:27] who had no right to the natural
[2:17:29] inheritance of spiritual Israel. But I'm
[2:17:32] going to find them among the nations.
[2:17:34] I'm going to find Gentiles who will
[2:17:36] trust in me.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give my grapes and my figs
[2:17:40] to those who will love me back.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Pretty serious.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; The point of those verses was to show
[2:17:48] you that God uses the fig.
[2:17:52] He uses the grape as a type of the
[2:17:56] spiritual life of the nation of Israel.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew what he was doing
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; when he cursed the fig tree.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus was enacting judgment on Israel's
[2:18:08] religious system. They were outwardly
[2:18:11] alive, full of pomp
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; and circumstance,
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; icons blaring.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:18:22] Got his picture on the wall. Got the
[2:18:25] cloud on my lapel.
[2:18:29] Got the belt buckle on.
[2:18:32] I'm one of them. Got the right bumper
[2:18:35] sticker.
[2:18:37] Jesus was exposing the religious system
[2:18:40] of the second temple period by saying,
[2:18:43] "You look all right on the outside. You
[2:18:46] look lively. You look like you're
[2:18:48] thriving. Your leaves are unfurling and
[2:18:51] unfolding, but there's something that is
[2:18:54] very wrong. You are inwardly barren, and
[2:18:58] this is the season that Messiah is
[2:19:01] coming to you.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; You say all of these years you've longed
[2:19:10] for Messiah
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; and you've missed, remember the prophet,
[2:19:13] he said in the Old Testament, you've
[2:19:15] missed your day of visitation. You say,
[2:19:17] "We believe Messiah's coming. We believe
[2:19:19] Messiah's coming. We believe Messiah's
[2:19:21] coming." But you made no spiritual
[2:19:23] preparation
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; for the coming of Messiah.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; And so when he comes, you don't even
[2:19:28] know who he is.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Have I been with you so long and you
[2:19:31] don't even know that I am?
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said?
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; You're looking for the father. Here he
[2:19:37] is.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; He said it. Here he is.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; And you didn't even know he was among
[2:19:43] you. Right?
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Because you've forgotten what the father
[2:19:46] is, who the father is,
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; what his desires are.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; You've hoarded. You've chased after
[2:19:52] other things.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; As the prayer went forth today, you you
[2:19:57] you have found other things to to to
[2:20:01] sort of saturate the hunger.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, I it's like sugar.
[2:20:09] It's so good in the moment.
[2:20:12] It's so wonderful in the beginning, but
[2:20:15] it doesn't stay with you very long.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; It spikes you. And if you're not
[2:20:20] careful, you'll find yourself empty and
[2:20:22] hungry.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Hungry.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; You want to stir up your appetite, eat
[2:20:28] more fruit.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Everybody will tell you. Anybody will
[2:20:32] tell you you you want to eat more other
[2:20:35] things, eat more fruit then because even
[2:20:38] the natural sugar in the fruit stirs the
[2:20:42] appetite of the body,
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; sends you into a fast. I mean, I enjoy
[2:20:47] it, but it sends you into a fast high
[2:20:51] and then a long crash.
[2:20:54] It doesn't give you what you need in the
[2:20:57] long term.
[2:20:59] Some of these entertaining things that
[2:21:01] we uh that we run after, they give us
[2:21:04] some momentary pleasure,
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't satisfy
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; in the long term.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; If you could have seen in the night,
[2:21:15] what I saw in the night last night,
[2:21:17] those things that are creeping in in the
[2:21:19] door, those things that are climbing in
[2:21:22] through windows and uh even sliding
[2:21:26] under doors. And I'm asking the Lord,
[2:21:29] how is it possible that these things
[2:21:32] could invade the private homes of the
[2:21:35] saints of God? How is it that the enemy
[2:21:38] I want you to know something. I'm pretty
[2:21:40] particular on this. I believe that the
[2:21:42] enemy is a trespassor on my little two
[2:21:45] acres.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; If he shows up, he has no business being
[2:21:49] there.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't belong to him.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; I take very seriously what is mine.
[2:21:56] Amen. I claim it. I pray over it. I
[2:22:00] sanctify it. I do everything I can to
[2:22:02] make sure that the devil doesn't have an
[2:22:05] easy pass
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; into my place and out of my place
[2:22:09] because I need to have an atmosphere and
[2:22:11] you do too to be able to worship the
[2:22:13] Lord and bring the presence of God. I
[2:22:16] don't need horrible dreams.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; I don't need filthy dreams. I don't need
[2:22:20] tormenting dreams. So I do everything
[2:22:23] that I can to sanctify my home, my
[2:22:26] property, my my my place.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; You should too.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; The answer came and I saw it even in the
[2:22:33] spirit. I saw how that these things had
[2:22:36] been invited in like an easy pass.
[2:22:40] Did you know that sometime you're on a
[2:22:42] toll road and you come to a a a toll
[2:22:46] booth and in the old days you had to
[2:22:48] come to a complete stop and you had to
[2:22:50] dig for change. That's why a lot of our
[2:22:53] vehicles have these little coin slots
[2:22:55] around. So you keep your coins handy and
[2:22:58] you drive down, you slow down. Sometime
[2:23:00] a complete stop you had to come and you
[2:23:03] throw the coin in and the coin registers
[2:23:05] and the arm goes up. But somebody in
[2:23:08] their amazing uh ingenuity uh came up
[2:23:12] with an easy pass.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; And uh for a while you just flashed that
[2:23:19] thing. You just flash it up. You still
[2:23:21] had to slow down. Still had to come
[2:23:23] almost to a complete stop. And sometimes
[2:23:25] in traffic you did come to a complete
[2:23:27] stop. You just Well, first I think you
[2:23:30] had to swipe them. Then the technology
[2:23:33] went a little higher and you just
[2:23:34] splashed them. Beep. arm goes up, you go
[2:23:38] right through. Not anymore. There are
[2:23:41] places in this nation where you get an
[2:23:43] easy pass. You can install something
[2:23:45] right up on the front of your vehicle,
[2:23:48] right up on the In fact, some uh new
[2:23:51] vehicles come with the computerized
[2:23:52] ability to to to program your number in
[2:23:55] your vehicle and it will flash it up.
[2:23:58] But you put a little something up there
[2:23:59] in the top and there is a a reader and
[2:24:03] as you get in that lane that your
[2:24:05] number, your easy pass, you pay for it
[2:24:07] monthly or yearly and and it registers
[2:24:11] that you are a paid subscriber and you
[2:24:14] don't even have to slow down,
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; You've just got an easy pass. Are you
[2:24:19] hearing me?
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; I saw that some of us had subscribed.
[2:24:25] Uhhuh.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; We had given the enemy an easy pass.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; I saw it in the toys.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; I saw it in the movies.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; I saw it in characters and heroes and
[2:24:42] she
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; and when that enemy wants to harass and
[2:24:50] hinder, he don't even have to flash a
[2:24:53] badge.
[2:24:54] He doesn't even have to explain why he
[2:24:57] wants to be a squatter
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; or why he wants to be a trespasser
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; on our land,
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; on our stuff,
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; in our home.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Friday night, that was last night.
[2:25:09] Friday night he dealt with me through
[2:25:10] the night about spiritual priesthood,
[2:25:14] the priesthood of the believer and the
[2:25:17] responsibility of the believer to
[2:25:20] function in in a in a holy manner as a
[2:25:23] priest
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; particularly the men.
[2:25:27] Now the priesthood of the believer is a
[2:25:29] genderless scriptural concept.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; But the priesthood of the home
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; in a marriage, it belongs always to the
[2:25:40] husband.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; He becomes the spiritual priest of the
[2:25:44] home. It's not enough for him to pray.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; He's got to teach his family
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; how to pray.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; He's the gatekeeper of the house. I
[2:25:55] things I know he taught me again, showed
[2:25:58] me again.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; And if he's not doing his job, I think
[2:26:01] that's kind of what led to the
[2:26:03] experience last night. It's just an easy
[2:26:05] pass.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; And sometime mama can pray and sometime
[2:26:10] mama can cast out devils and sometimes
[2:26:12] mama can get the broom like the Kendrick
[2:26:14] brothers movie.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know if daddy has
[2:26:18] installed an easy pass.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Now I'm really going to preach.
[2:26:23] I gave you an opportunity to jump in on
[2:26:25] the gospel.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm really going to tell you what I
[2:26:30] saw.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; If daddy has installed an easy pass,
[2:26:34] then the enemy comes and goes. And it
[2:26:36] hardly matters to him. The carrying on.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; You see, tongues is not what moves the
[2:26:42] enemy. It's authority. Yes, sir.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have any authority in
[2:26:46] your tongues,
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Hello. If there's not a life behind it,
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; then it's jibberjabber in the pr to the
[2:26:56] prince of darkness.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; And he just says, I don't care about
[2:27:00] your mumbo jumbo. The doors wide open
[2:27:03] spiritually and I'm going to come in and
[2:27:05] I'm going to pitch my tent.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; I saw the spectrum.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; I prayed against it this morning
[2:27:15] standing on the platform. I prayed for
[2:27:18] neurological healing
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; in the brains of the saints.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Craziness, isn't it? Almost. You hear
[2:27:26] this talk, it's almost sounds like crazy
[2:27:29] talk,
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; but we're living in such an hour where
[2:27:33] there's more mental illness
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; around us than wellness.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; And some of it is simply because of our
[2:27:42] choices.
[2:27:45] what we choose to believe, what we
[2:27:47] choose to embrace, what we choose to
[2:27:49] entertain, what we choose to meditate
[2:27:52] on, it wires.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; It keeps us in that place.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; And that's why as you look around, you
[2:28:04] recognize that just about everybody
[2:28:06] around you in your life
[2:28:10] is on the spectrum somewhere.
[2:28:14] It seems that almost everybody's got a
[2:28:16] little autism or a little bit of ADHD
[2:28:20] or a little bit of so and so. And they
[2:28:22] may laugh at Robert Kennedy and they may
[2:28:26] make fun and they may think he's just a
[2:28:28] big dummy.
[2:28:30] You may be one of them. But I want you
[2:28:33] to know he's a lot of things,
[2:28:36] but he's not a dummy.
[2:28:38] He understands simply understands what
[2:28:42] big pharma refuses to understand
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; and that is drugs are not always the
[2:28:50] answer.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Reconditioning and changing your
[2:28:54] behavior and rewiring the synapsis of
[2:28:57] your brain and making up your mind that
[2:29:01] you're going to be what God called you
[2:29:03] to be. Believe what God's word said you
[2:29:05] are. You're going to raise up a holy
[2:29:08] standard in your own life,
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; your family,
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; not someone else's,
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; yours.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; You're going to be a spiritual priest,
[2:29:21] Dad, to your home. You're going to I
[2:29:24] tell you what, if I were you, I'd go
[2:29:25] home today and revoke the devil's easy
[2:29:27] path.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Some of you ought to start in a toy box.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You ought to go through some
[2:29:33] of those hideous things you've bought
[2:29:35] for your children
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; because you didn't want them to be left
[2:29:38] out from the other church kids who were
[2:29:40] allowed to play with that that kind of
[2:29:42] stuff.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Let's see how tough it gets now.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; The things we set our kids down in front
[2:29:51] of that what rewire them, rewire their
[2:29:53] brains. Let me tell you something. It's
[2:29:55] not normal. I don't care who says it is.
[2:29:58] It's not normal for little children to
[2:30:00] go around telling people, "I'm gonna
[2:30:02] kill you."
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; No, they didn't get that from the Old
[2:30:06] Testament.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; That's not normal.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; You need to understand that's not
[2:30:12] normal.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Something is out of line.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; The enemy has been given an easy pass.
[2:30:19] Somebody better recognize it and do
[2:30:21] something about it while you can
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; because these are the kinds of things
[2:30:27] that will keep us from standing in the
[2:30:30] line to receive what God has put our
[2:30:33] name on.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; If my name is on it, I want it. If it's
[2:30:38] promised to the end time believer, I
[2:30:40] want it.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; You don't understand. You don't
[2:30:46] understand the times we're living in,
[2:30:48] Brother Shelley. You don't understand
[2:30:49] what teenagers go through today. You
[2:30:52] don't understand this, that, or the
[2:30:53] other. I tell you what I do understand.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; I do understand that the world is
[2:30:58] putting its stamp
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; on the brains, on the minds of children.
[2:31:05] And what goes on out there, we have
[2:31:07] nothing that we can say about it that
[2:31:09] will effectively make a difference. But
[2:31:11] what goes on in here, it's somebody's
[2:31:14] responsibility to cry out against it.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; If it hair liips the devil,
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; we better be careful what we're putting
[2:31:23] in front of their eyes.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; Violence and all of the things that
[2:31:27] people are so crazy about in this hour.
[2:31:30] It's absolutely rewiring the circuits of
[2:31:33] our brains, causing us to process things
[2:31:36] differently. And that's why you have
[2:31:39] scrolled all week. Some of you women
[2:31:41] have scrolled all week with your thumb,
[2:31:44] men too.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; And that's why you can come in here on a
[2:31:47] Sunday morning so easily and use your
[2:31:50] thumb
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; to scroll past the part that you don't
[2:31:54] like what the preacher says because
[2:31:56] you've absolutely put yourself in that
[2:31:59] kind of a frame of mind with your thumb.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; You want me to tell you what Jesus said?
[2:32:07] He said it would be better to have your
[2:32:10] eye plucked out.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to just make this up to
[2:32:14] the 2025. Might be better for you not to
[2:32:17] have a thumb.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Now, please understand that I don't mean
[2:32:22] that in the natural and in the physical.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; What I mean by that is a people who call
[2:32:28] themselves the bride of Christ filled
[2:32:30] with the Holy Ghost, sanctified by the
[2:32:32] washing of the water of the word, ought
[2:32:34] to have enough
[2:32:37] control
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; to be able to use that thumb
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; for something other than filling our
[2:32:44] minds with the garbage.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; That will keep us from our spiritual
[2:32:52] destiny.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; Who are you preaching to? You.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody but you.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Pretend you're the only one here.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; And that's who I'm preaching to. Amen.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; You, you, you, you, you. So, somebody
[2:33:08] goes out, I think he was talking about
[2:33:10] me. He was.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; And the one next to you, and the one
[2:33:13] next to you, and the one next to you.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Because the word of the Lord is to all
[2:33:17] of us.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; Who do you think is going to make a
[2:33:21] difference for your home if you don't
[2:33:23] make the difference?
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I my teenagers, my
[2:33:29] my my 10, 11, 12, you know, because
[2:33:31] that's how we look at 10 year olds, 11
[2:33:33] year olds, and 12 year olds. They're not
[2:33:34] teenagers. That's
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; There's a huge difference between a
[2:33:38] 10-year-old and a 13-year-old.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; In fact, there's a period of time in
[2:33:43] there where the difference of all your
[2:33:47] lifetime from from the baby all the way
[2:33:49] to the death. There's a period of time
[2:33:52] in there where where a one year
[2:33:56] can make the biggest difference
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; in someone's ability to process life.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's why we better be trying to deal
[2:34:10] with them in the present and preparing
[2:34:13] them for the next. That's right.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; And that's why wise people, wise parents
[2:34:21] sometime are careful about uh you know
[2:34:24] age groups and things like that.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; Because kids are just like parents. They
[2:34:31] talk.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. And they talk about
[2:34:35] whatever interests them and they talk
[2:34:37] about whatever they're going through at
[2:34:39] the moment and whatever they're dealing
[2:34:41] with and whatever they're facing. And
[2:34:43] there are times that things like that
[2:34:45] happen and there's uh some in the crowd
[2:34:49] that are processing life differently
[2:34:51] because they're not in the same age
[2:34:53] group and they've not been raised in the
[2:34:55] same spiritual environment
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; and they're not quite ready
[2:35:04] to process
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; what they hear.
[2:35:09] And if we were raising wise children and
[2:35:11] wise teenagers, and I pray we are, then
[2:35:14] surely they ought to be able to look
[2:35:16] around. But here's the thing, they lose
[2:35:18] themselves when they find an ear
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; and they just of course because they
[2:35:24] feel like they're not heard
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; and so they just want to say it. And
[2:35:28] sometime they don't process the fact
[2:35:30] that there's an ear there that might not
[2:35:32] have the ability to to fully grasp or
[2:35:36] process the depth and the adult nature,
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; the mature nature of what you're saying.
[2:35:43] I want you to know something. We've got
[2:35:44] to be very, very wise in the hour that
[2:35:47] we're living in right now. I agree with
[2:35:49] you that children are are hearing and
[2:35:52] they are exposed to things at a much
[2:35:54] early age. But I don't agree with you if
[2:35:57] you say that that necessarily prepares
[2:35:59] them mentally to be able to process it.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; Just think about all the things that you
[2:36:06] didn't know till you were fully grown.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Think about the things you didn't know
[2:36:11] about marriage till you were married.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; And you'll understand. I I can assure
[2:36:17] you that in my my younger day, uh, men
[2:36:21] didn't know when when somebody else's
[2:36:24] wife,
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; you get it. You sure?
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:36:34] It just You just didn't talk about it.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether it should be or
[2:36:41] shouldn't be, but I'll tell you
[2:36:42] sometimes it makes me extremely nervous
[2:36:45] when I see little ears and I'm thinking
[2:36:49] somebody's going to have to do some
[2:36:50] explaining. Hallelujah. It won't be me.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. We've got to use wisdom. I'm
[2:36:59] telling you, somebody better get that
[2:37:01] easy pass out of the hand of the devil.
[2:37:02] I'm going to I'm going to close in a
[2:37:04] minute. I am. I'm just going to leave it
[2:37:05] like this.
[2:37:07] We better make up our mind. Listen, why
[2:37:09] don't you just become a little Holy
[2:37:12] Ghost fililled warrior, man or woman?
[2:37:15] Why don't you just anoint your house?
[2:37:19] [Music]
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just anoint your house?
[2:37:22] Why don't you just go through things?
[2:37:23] You'd be surprised what we bring in.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; What we let in
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; the enemy? Somebody said, "Well, you
[2:37:30] don't you're not saying that objects are
[2:37:31] cursed." Well, I don't have to say that.
[2:37:33] The Bible said so.
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said, "You're not saying
[2:37:37] that there are evil spirits that attach
[2:37:39] themselves to things like that." Oh,
[2:37:40] yes, I am saying that. I don't care if I
[2:37:43] make the podcast. Uh uh I am saying
[2:37:46] that.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; They're looking for a way in.
[2:37:51] You
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; remember the experience that I had many
[2:37:53] years ago uh with a cocking gun. What it
[2:37:57] looked like was a cocking gun. But my
[2:37:59] cocking wasn't white and it wasn't
[2:38:02] cocking.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; It was blood. Somebody said, "You'll
[2:38:05] never see blood in a spiritual
[2:38:07] experience. You may never see them in
[2:38:08] yours, but I've seen them several times
[2:38:11] in mine."
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; This was the blood of Jesus.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; And the blood of Jesus, the the hoots
[2:38:18] and the hows, let's say it that way, the
[2:38:20] hoots and the hows of this old world,
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; uh, the the wolves,
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; they run in packs of three
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; and they'll harass you spiritually
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; and they'll look in at the window. And
[2:38:33] in this particular experience, they're
[2:38:35] looking in the window. And I knew
[2:38:38] nothing would satisfy their hunger, but
[2:38:40] my flesh.
[2:38:42] Here come the gun.
[2:38:46] And I'm just cocking the window. And
[2:38:49] this isn't cocking. This was the blood
[2:38:52] of Jesus.
[2:38:54] Sister Shosana sings it sometime. Devil,
[2:38:58] Satan,
[2:39:00] you can't cross the bloodline.
[2:39:03] He can if you give him an easy pass.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; He can if you bring the Halloween
[2:39:15] costumes in and
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; all the things that people get into
[2:39:19] these days.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; He can then you give him an easy pass.
[2:39:26] Hear me.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Hear me. Some of you wouldn't want me to
[2:39:30] see. You wouldn't want anybody that you
[2:39:33] respect in this house to see some of the
[2:39:35] things that you have purchased for your
[2:39:37] children to play with.
[2:39:40] The things that I wrestle with in the
[2:39:42] night on occasion are the things that
[2:39:45] Hollywood so quickly picks up on and
[2:39:48] they do everything they can to sell them
[2:39:51] so that they become common. The whole
[2:39:53] the whole Harry Potter thing was
[2:39:55] absolutely I don't care. I don't care if
[2:39:59] she was a a starving
[2:40:02] woman who had didn't even have a cup of
[2:40:05] tea. That doesn't mean that God inspired
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; to make her the millionaire billionaire
[2:40:13] she is.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; May God help her. I've actually prayed
[2:40:17] for her by name and asked the Lord to
[2:40:19] help her because what she's done with
[2:40:22] her books and movies that were made
[2:40:24] after has so desensitized people
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; to that realm of of spiritual wickedness
[2:40:32] of witchcraft and sorcery etc.
[2:40:37] until I know Christians and I want you
[2:40:40] to see these big old air quotation marks
[2:40:42] because that's exactly how I feel. And I
[2:40:45] won't even say believers
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; because I know believers aren't
[2:40:50] interested in that kind of stuff
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; because they understand that if
[2:40:54] Hollywood is pumping it,
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; come on. If Hollywood is pushing it,
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; it's likely to be something to pull the
[2:41:02] wool over
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; on the church's eyes. Boy, do I sound a
[2:41:07] bit like a fanatic. That's because we
[2:41:09] don't hear enough of it.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; And then when we pull it out and hit it
[2:41:12] with both barrels, it makes us all feel
[2:41:14] a little fanatical. But it's absolutely
[2:41:17] the truth. Amen.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; If you're going to tell them about
[2:41:21] another realm, tell them about the
[2:41:22] spirit realm.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; And tell them about angels.
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; And tell them about how God assigns
[2:41:28] angels to deal with things that come
[2:41:30] against us.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; We go into restaurants, we fight them.
[2:41:33] We go into Walmart, we fight them. Drive
[2:41:35] down the road. Driving down the road
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; in my own vehicle,
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; bothering nobody and following the law,
[2:41:44] you'll see people go by. You're going
[2:41:46] the speed limit. you're not doing
[2:41:47] anything to cause anybody any harm. And
[2:41:49] you'll see people going down the the
[2:41:51] road, fingering you and mumbling
[2:41:55] something and mad at you and throwing
[2:41:57] their hands up in the air and you're
[2:41:59] trying to figure out. Now, I know good
[2:42:00] and well,
[2:42:02] boy, I try to be pretty courteous in my
[2:42:05] driving because I know people aren't
[2:42:08] looking.
[2:42:11] And so, I know I haven't done anything.
[2:42:13] I'm trying to figure out what in the
[2:42:14] world what in the world is wrong with
[2:42:15] these people. and you've been in similar
[2:42:17] situations. And it's not anything you've
[2:42:19] done at all. It's the difference that
[2:42:22] your life makes.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; It's worth guarding.
[2:42:32] &gt;&gt; It's worth watching.
[2:42:35] Let me let me just finish a moment of
[2:42:37] this and we'll go. We can go. Jesus was
[2:42:40] exposing the hypocrisy that was taking
[2:42:43] place in the religious world. these fig
[2:42:45] trees in Israel. And I want you to hear
[2:42:47] this now because it wouldn't have been
[2:42:49] fair. I agree. It wouldn't have been
[2:42:51] fair for Jesus to rebuke a fig tree for
[2:42:55] not having figs in a season where there
[2:42:57] were no figs. But something caused him
[2:43:00] to expect figs.
[2:43:04] This wasn't just a random thing.
[2:43:07] Something caused him to expect by what
[2:43:12] he saw with his eye. The thriving life
[2:43:16] of the tree leaves in place that he
[2:43:19] would find a fig and he found none and
[2:43:22] he cursed it. I'm I I want to know,
[2:43:25] don't you? Inquiring mind, somebody
[2:43:27] wants to know why he would have
[2:43:29] expected. Well, there's a there's a real
[2:43:32] explanation for that. Uh would you show
[2:43:34] us the definition there in the Hebrew of
[2:43:37] the word that we used in Hosea, first
[2:43:40] ripe? Now I asked charity to divide it
[2:43:43] first ripe
[2:43:45] because in King James it's combined and
[2:43:48] it looks like such an odd word. When I
[2:43:50] looked at it I thought I don't think
[2:43:51] that's a word I've ever paid much
[2:43:53] attention to as one word first ripe. So
[2:43:57] I divided it just for the sake of you
[2:43:59] being able to understand it. It means
[2:44:02] exactly. You didn't need the Hebrew. It
[2:44:04] means exactly what it sounds like. It
[2:44:06] means first ripe. It sounds like first
[2:44:10] fruits, doesn't it? The word is uh often
[2:44:15] transliterated, which is an English
[2:44:18] spelling of a Hebrew or Greek word. It
[2:44:21] is transliterated
[2:44:24] as becka or beura.
[2:44:27] And it's from the root bakar which means
[2:44:30] to be early first born earliest early
[2:44:33] fig first ripe fig.
[2:44:36] Listen to this. It refers to those first
[2:44:40] figs of the season
[2:44:43] that ripen before the main harvest. They
[2:44:48] are especially valued because they are
[2:44:50] considered sweet
[2:44:53] and a sign of what? Read it.
[2:44:56] fruitfulness.
[2:44:58] There's a Spanish word that one of the
[2:45:01] few Spanish words. It comes from a
[2:45:03] Spanish root. It's one of the few words
[2:45:06] in horiculture that comes from a Spanish
[2:45:08] root. Most of the horiculture words come
[2:45:11] from Latin roots. But there's a word
[2:45:14] that is used. It's briba.
[2:45:17] Brebba. It comes from the Hebrew.
[2:45:19] Really, it certainly has somehow
[2:45:22] extended from the Hebrew. But you'll
[2:45:25] hear an expression in in certain places,
[2:45:28] particularly Europe, and they'll say
[2:45:31] briba figs.
[2:45:33] And this is an early crop uh of figs
[2:45:38] that develop on the shoots, the stems
[2:45:44] of last year's wood. Now, how many of
[2:45:49] you understand what that means? It's
[2:45:51] simple.
[2:45:52] There are certain
[2:45:54] uh varieties of hydrangeas.
[2:45:58] That's a good southern flower.
[2:46:01] And there are certain uh varieties of
[2:46:04] hydrangeas that bloom on new shoots, new
[2:46:08] wood, new growth. You cut that new
[2:46:11] growth off, you won't have any flowers.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; But there are older varieties like a lot
[2:46:17] of us have that bloom on old wood. Yes.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; So last year's new wood is where the
[2:46:25] blooms will come this year. And it's
[2:46:28] that way with a fig tree.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; There is often an early small select
[2:46:35] crop of figs. Usually smaller than the
[2:46:40] regular harvest that come with the
[2:46:44] leaves
[2:46:45] or sometimes slightly before.
[2:46:49] It's possible under that Hebrew word
[2:46:52] first ripe. It's possible to have a few
[2:46:56] delicate,
[2:46:58] sweet little figs on a tree where there
[2:47:02] are no leaves at all, just buds about to
[2:47:06] break out into a leaf. Jesus knew what
[2:47:10] he was doing.
[2:47:11] He saw how beautiful the leaves had
[2:47:14] unfolded at Passover time, which is
[2:47:17] actually several months before there
[2:47:20] should have been a regular harvest of
[2:47:22] figs. But he judged by the outside and
[2:47:26] saw that there should have been some of
[2:47:30] those first ripe figs, those briba figs
[2:47:34] or bikura figs. But when he got there,
[2:47:37] he saw that this little bush was all
[2:47:40] about show.
[2:47:44] She had produced the most amazing crop
[2:47:47] of, you know, when a leaf first comes
[2:47:49] out, it's it's generally uh the most
[2:47:52] beautiful and unusual shade of green.
[2:47:56] Light green. Not quite like brother
[2:47:59] Gregory's shirt. Not maybe always quite
[2:48:02] that light green, but light green.
[2:48:05] lovely color. As the leaf hangs there a
[2:48:07] while, it deepens in its green. It gets
[2:48:09] darker and darker. He saw those
[2:48:11] beautiful light green fresh looking
[2:48:14] leaves. And he said, "Oh my, I'm going
[2:48:17] to have some fig here. I'm going to use
[2:48:20] this lesson
[2:48:22] to prophesy something over Israel. And
[2:48:25] I'm going to use this lesson to speak
[2:48:27] something to my disciples." And so it
[2:48:29] was not being unfair or unreasonable for
[2:48:32] him to expect there to have been figs
[2:48:35] even though it wasn't fig season. Are
[2:48:39] you following me?
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 28:4. You don't have it. I didn't
[2:48:42] give it to you. I'm going to just give
[2:48:44] you a portion of it. It says, "And the
[2:48:46] glorious beauty shall be as a hasty
[2:48:49] fruit before summer." That that is the
[2:48:52] word bura. And it is the word that means
[2:48:55] when it says hasty fruit in English,
[2:48:57] that's what it means. one that has come
[2:49:00] on the tree before the regular crop of
[2:49:03] figs would even be on the tree. These
[2:49:07] figs were valued because of their
[2:49:09] sweetness. And here is something that
[2:49:12] you ought to know. If there are no
[2:49:15] bikura,
[2:49:16] if there are no breba or briba figs, if
[2:49:20] there are no early figs, it will
[2:49:23] absolutely affect the rest of the crop.
[2:49:26] So the sign that there were no early
[2:49:29] figs was a sign that something was
[2:49:32] seriously wrong in the in the root in
[2:49:35] the heart of this fig tree. You
[2:49:38] understand?
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; The outside looked just right. The
[2:49:42] outside looked like it would be
[2:49:44] producing fruitful early figs and a
[2:49:48] bumper crop of normal figs in their
[2:49:51] season. But the reality is it was a
[2:49:55] showoff.
[2:49:56] It was a hypocrite, so to speak. And
[2:49:59] Jesus said, "I'm going to teach a lesson
[2:50:01] here. I'm going to show Israel this
[2:50:04] will." And listen, here we are today. I
[2:50:06] tell you, he picked a good one. Here we
[2:50:08] are today still talking about it,
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; still preaching about what it meant and
[2:50:12] what it could mean. Around Passover, the
[2:50:15] spring trees with leaves should at least
[2:50:17] have those little tiny figs beginning to
[2:50:20] form. And the barrenness of this tree,
[2:50:23] no Breba figs, no early figs, was a sign
[2:50:26] that the coming crop would also fail.
[2:50:28] And perhaps the tree would not even make
[2:50:32] it through the next season. Something
[2:50:34] was seriously wrong. Not in the leaves.
[2:50:37] Where?
[2:50:40] One of the first things the Lord said to
[2:50:41] me in this season was, "I'm going to
[2:50:43] deal with hypocrisy
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; with my people, in my people, in my
[2:50:51] bride
[2:50:53] first because the problem isn't in the
[2:50:55] leaf. It's not in the uniform.
[2:50:59] It's not particularly in the outward.
[2:51:02] It's something in the roots. It's
[2:51:04] something underneath the surface of the
[2:51:05] ground that I'm calling my people to
[2:51:07] deal with. I'm calling my people to deal
[2:51:10] with it so that I don't have to judge
[2:51:12] the whole tree. It's kind of a serious
[2:51:14] word. I'm closing. It's kind of a
[2:51:16] serious word. Musicians are coming. But
[2:51:19] this shows it wasn't about botany. It
[2:51:21] was about prophecy.
[2:51:23] Jesus wasn't looking for lunch. He was
[2:51:26] executing an act of judgment that would
[2:51:28] stand until the hour that we're living
[2:51:30] in today. In fact, the very next scene
[2:51:32] in Mark 11, do you know what it is? It's
[2:51:35] Jesus cleansing the temple. The very
[2:51:38] next scene after the cursing of the fig
[2:51:40] tree is Jesus going to the temple and
[2:51:42] cleansing it because you've made my
[2:51:44] father's house a house of merchandise.
[2:51:46] It's about getting ready for Passover.
[2:51:48] It's about getting all the the the the
[2:51:51] leavenan out.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; Let's deal with hypocrisy in the tree,
[2:51:55] he said. And then he goes into the
[2:51:56] temple and he cleanses it physically.
[2:52:00] And how many of you believe that was
[2:52:01] also a prophetic demonstration?
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; God saying there's going to come a day
[2:52:05] because I don't want to live in this
[2:52:06] kind. I'm not looking for a house of
[2:52:07] stone. I'm looking for one of flesh. And
[2:52:10] I'm going to have a people that will do
[2:52:11] spiritual inventory
[2:52:13] &gt;&gt; from time to time.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that
[2:52:16] God gives us the opportunity from time
[2:52:18] to time as uh as old Jack Co used to
[2:52:21] sing? Aren't you glad he gives us
[2:52:23] opportunity from time to time to check
[2:52:24] up on our payments to the Lord?
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; He used to sing that little chord. I'm
[2:52:30] I'm checking up on my payments to the
[2:52:32] Lord. I'm going to pay the debt I know I
[2:52:34] owe. into glory land. I will go because
[2:52:36] I'm checking up on my payments
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; when that capstone come flying across
[2:52:43] the plane. I hope you can follow me.
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; When I move from thing to thing
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; when that capstone I'm I'm doing that's
[2:52:51] just one side of it. It's shaped like
[2:52:52] this. When that capstone we call it
[2:52:55] sometime a headstone, but I don't want
[2:52:57] you to think about the kind that's in
[2:52:58] the cemetery.
[2:53:00] This is the keystone.
[2:53:04] When the stonemasons build an arch,
[2:53:07] there's a keystone in the top of it.
[2:53:10] Very important. It's holding it all
[2:53:12] together.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; That keystone come loose, the arch
[2:53:15] collapses.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; So, we can call it capstone, keystone,
[2:53:19] headstone,
[2:53:21] all of those terms describing the same
[2:53:24] sort of term in masonry. When that
[2:53:28] capstone
[2:53:29] first it slides down,
[2:53:33] I thought it would set on top. I thought
[2:53:36] it would surely finish the building.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; Rather, it slides down and that black
[2:53:43] gloved hand swats it out of the way. And
[2:53:47] the scripture comes, that stone that the
[2:53:50] builders rejected,
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; it was to be the cornerstone,
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; but now I'm making it the chief. I'm
[2:53:57] making it the chief. One translator said
[2:53:59] the chief cornerstone. But the reality
[2:54:01] is he was rejected as a cornerstone. So
[2:54:04] that stone becomes the capstone.
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; You understand? Same same rock.
[2:54:11] &gt;&gt; Now it comes to hang down. This is for
[2:54:14] you that have followed me.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; It comes to to sit right there on the
[2:54:18] top. It is the final. It is the
[2:54:20] finishing touch. it. In fact, it's the
[2:54:23] most important part of the whole thing
[2:54:25] because without that, we're still
[2:54:27] looking. How many times do you think he
[2:54:30] said 80 pages worth? How do you know?
[2:54:33] Because I put them all in the same place
[2:54:35] this week. 80 pages worth
[2:54:39] of times, he said. And they haven't
[2:54:42] found it. And they don't know where it
[2:54:44] is. That great pyramid in Giza, it never
[2:54:48] had its capstone. It never had its
[2:54:51] headstone. It's prophecy.
[2:54:54] &gt;&gt; It's prophecy. Yes, it's prophecy. The
[2:54:56] Old Testament speaks about the pyramids.
[2:54:59] They're the only surviving memorial
[2:55:01] after the uh uh from from the time of
[2:55:03] the anti-dolivian. And he also talks
[2:55:06] about that and mentions that it's a
[2:55:08] memorial in the desert. It's a memorial
[2:55:10] in the sand. It's more than that. It's
[2:55:12] been a prophecy. Now, he's always
[2:55:15] careful to say, I'm not a I'm not one of
[2:55:17] those who follow the pyramid doctrine.
[2:55:19] And the reason why is there was
[2:55:21] something that was going around in that
[2:55:23] period of time is sometimes referred to
[2:55:26] as British Israelism.
[2:55:28] And it's this idea that Britain was a
[2:55:31] part of the last the lost tribes. It was
[2:55:35] being taught in the 20s and 30s among
[2:55:37] Pentecostals and and some of it was even
[2:55:40] taught around the message. Brother
[2:55:41] Brandham keeps distancing himself from
[2:55:43] this because what ended up happening to
[2:55:46] those people, they believe that the
[2:55:48] pyramid was deeply tied into Britain and
[2:55:50] they believed that the stone of scone
[2:55:53] was actually the the uh I know you don't
[2:55:56] want to hear all this, but you have to
[2:55:57] because there's somebody watching this
[2:55:59] that if I miss those points,
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; they'll tell all over the world he's
[2:56:03] preaching pyramidology.
[2:56:05] Uh so I want you to know that we're not
[2:56:07] embracing Israel Britishism and all the
[2:56:09] different terms that have come to
[2:56:11] explain it. Uh the the stone of scone
[2:56:14] which is the stone I've seen the throne
[2:56:17] the the chair it sits under and u the
[2:56:21] kings and queens are coronated around
[2:56:24] that kind of thing. And um they were
[2:56:28] believing and and preaching in the 20s,
[2:56:30] 30s, 40s and even today there's a group
[2:56:32] still groups of people who believe that
[2:56:35] uh it later began to teach that Charles
[2:56:38] this was many years ago that Charles
[2:56:41] would then raise up to be the
[2:56:42] antichrist.
[2:56:45] And uh I could go on. You you'd be
[2:56:49] surprised if I told you the names of
[2:56:52] some of the people that followed that in
[2:56:53] the early days. Brother Brandham just
[2:56:56] kept separating himself from that. I'm
[2:56:57] not part of that. I'm not trying to put
[2:56:59] the religion in the pyramid and so
[2:57:01] forth. But remember, Brother Brandham
[2:57:03] leaned heavily on a writer by the name
[2:57:05] of Clarence Larkin.
[2:57:08] Nothing wrong with that.
[2:57:11] How do we know? Because we see that the
[2:57:13] things that he borrowed.
[2:57:15] And the the reason why that doesn't
[2:57:18] offend us is because we understand that
[2:57:21] that's really what men of God do.
[2:57:24] They research, they dig, they borrow,
[2:57:26] and then they have to depend on whatever
[2:57:28] their calling is or whatever their
[2:57:30] anointing is to be able to discern which
[2:57:33] of these things is worthy of the word.
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; And that's why his ministry was so
[2:57:39] important. He helped us to see the
[2:57:40] things that line up with the word and
[2:57:42] the things that don't line up with the
[2:57:44] word. Are you still following me?
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Well, there's this uh what is the book
[2:57:48] called? Is it called Revelation? What is
[2:57:50] Larkin's book? one of his books called
[2:57:52] Revelation something. What is it?
[2:57:55] Dispensational what? Truth. That's
[2:57:58] right. That's right. Dispensational
[2:57:59] truth by Lin. There's a whole whole
[2:58:01] chapter in dispensational truth. We know
[2:58:04] brother Brandham read it because he he
[2:58:05] emphasized the theme of watchmen what of
[2:58:07] the night. He emphasized the church
[2:58:09] ages. He he was preaching there
[2:58:11] initially uh from from the influence of
[2:58:14] Larkin and the help of the Holy Spirit.
[2:58:16] He was preaching spirit, soul, body,
[2:58:20] early part of his ministry. One day he
[2:58:23] grabbed the wrong word and and stayed
[2:58:25] with it and and we don't worry about
[2:58:27] that because we understand what it
[2:58:28] means. But if you the same book has a
[2:58:32] whole chapter on the pyramid, who built
[2:58:35] the pyramid and and I have a lot I could
[2:58:37] tell you about the about that, but you
[2:58:39] didn't come to hear that today.
[2:58:42] There are many things in that chapter
[2:58:45] that he preached because he saw that it
[2:58:47] was the truth and people have understood
[2:58:51] it's it's a sign. It's a memorial.
[2:58:55] We're not we're not a uh uh we don't
[2:58:58] follow uh astrology,
[2:59:01] but we know that God placed a truth in
[2:59:04] the skies first and foremost before we
[2:59:07] had a written record of the word. And
[2:59:10] then he put one out there in the desert.
[2:59:14] And then he put one in printed form.
[2:59:15] Hallelujah. Thank God. Because I might
[2:59:18] not have been able to count all the
[2:59:19] steps in the pyramid of Giza and get the
[2:59:22] message. And I might not have been able
[2:59:23] to remember the names of all the stars
[2:59:24] and get the message. But brother, I can
[2:59:26] tuck this book not only under my arm,
[2:59:28] but in my heart.
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:30] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing that one doesn't
[2:59:32] contradict the other.
[2:59:33] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? But when that
[2:59:35] when that pyramid came flying across,
[2:59:39] now this would would wouldn't have been
[2:59:40] so profound had I have known all these
[2:59:43] things from the message. But at this
[2:59:45] time, I was still pretty green.
[2:59:49] And so when God would show me something,
[2:59:51] I'd go right to the message to search it
[2:59:52] out and see if I could find anything in
[2:59:55] there that would help me understand what
[2:59:56] I saw. But when that when that little
[3:00:00] capstone I thought, "Oh, it's going back
[3:00:02] up. It's going to, this is vision one,
[3:00:05] trans vision number one. Um, it's going
[3:00:08] to go back up there and crown the
[3:00:09] pyramid. But instead, it came flying
[3:00:11] across the plane with shouts of grace,
[3:00:14] grace, as Zachariah said, and struck me
[3:00:17] right there.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; It's amazing because brother Brandham
[3:00:23] uses the language about striking. He
[3:00:25] says the same thing. I found it. He says
[3:00:28] the same thing about that capstone
[3:00:30] striking the bride.
[3:00:32] This is just a symbol the forehead but
[3:00:35] remember what it represents sir
[3:00:37] &gt;&gt; that is the that's a that's the
[3:00:38] intellect that's actually and and
[3:00:40] intellect is not wrong
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; unless you lean on this and not what God
[3:00:44] reveals here
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; but it starts here brother Bram said
[3:00:47] even faith as a revelation starts here
[3:00:50] &gt;&gt; as a mental concept
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; truth starts as a mental concept come on
[3:00:54] drops down to the heart there was
[3:00:55] something on that I know you're
[3:00:57] listening some of you
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; there was one eye
[3:01:01] Crazy,
[3:01:04] strange.
[3:01:06] The Bible says the eyes of the Lord. But
[3:01:10] there was just one eye.
[3:01:12] If you follow the message, you hear
[3:01:14] Brother Bam saying, "Oh," he said, "I
[3:01:16] know that." He said, "They call that the
[3:01:17] seal of the United States. That ought to
[3:01:19] be maybe the seal of Egypt or something.
[3:01:20] the seal of, you know, he he talks about
[3:01:22] the different things on the dollar bill,
[3:01:24] but he said, "I'll tell you that eye,
[3:01:27] it it may mean something in pagan world.
[3:01:31] It may mean something inh
[3:01:34] uh, you know, mythologies and false
[3:01:36] religion, but he said, I'll tell you
[3:01:37] what it represents to me. It's the
[3:01:39] allseeing eye of God."
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; And he breaks out in the old song we
[3:01:46] used to sing. Some of you aren't old
[3:01:48] enough to remember the old hymn. It's
[3:01:50] probably in the red book.
[3:01:53] There's an eye
[3:01:55] watching you.
[3:01:58] All along on the road to the soul's true
[3:02:01] abode, there's an eye watching you.
[3:02:04] Everything that you do, there's an eye
[3:02:07] watching you. And somebody said that is
[3:02:10] enough to terrify the children.
[3:02:14] It must not be. That's a That's the
[3:02:16] That's the lie that they that they
[3:02:19] placed on Santa Claus.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what they told us? Uh he
[3:02:24] knows when you've been naughty. He knows
[3:02:26] when you've been good. He knows you.
[3:02:27] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's because uh they were trying to
[3:02:32] put Santa Claus in in where God belongs
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; because he he's not real. So he couldn't
[3:02:37] know what's going on at your house.
[3:02:39] &gt;&gt; He knows when you've been sleeping. Come
[3:02:41] on. He knows when you're awake.
[3:02:45] and that and that you know what I sing
[3:02:47] when I there's an eye watching you and
[3:02:51] it's not Santa Claus.
[3:02:53] &gt;&gt; It's an allseeing eye of God.
[3:02:56] &gt;&gt; And and that don't terrify me.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it terrify you when you're weak?
[3:03:01] It does not.
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it terrify you when you're
[3:03:04] naughty? It does not.
[3:03:07] Because I know that if I can trust that
[3:03:09] eye,
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; he didn't come to watch me to condemn
[3:03:14] me.
[3:03:15] &gt;&gt; He come to watch me to help me get over
[3:03:17] whatever it is
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; that's trying to hold me earthbound.
[3:03:22] And brother, when I'm navigating like
[3:03:24] you are the the the narrow uh you know
[3:03:28] turns and curves of the mountain trying
[3:03:30] to get up, I'm glad that I
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; there's no judgment in that eye
[3:03:37] &gt;&gt; for his wife.
[3:03:42] And
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; it struck as a as a representation of
[3:03:46] the of the crowning. He sometimes called
[3:03:49] it a crowning. Sometimes he called it a
[3:03:51] capping.
[3:03:53] But here's what you need to remember.
[3:03:56] It cannot strike you. He said
[3:03:59] until everything else
[3:04:03] has been formed. I'm going to say
[3:04:06] birthed because I saw it as contractions
[3:04:10] of a woman's delivery. The contractions
[3:04:14] of a woman in labor because it's a
[3:04:17] manchild.
[3:04:20] It's Christ.
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's Christ. Somebody said, "Where where
[3:04:25] do you get that kind of language?" The
[3:04:26] New Testament. Forgive me. The New
[3:04:28] Testament.
[3:04:30] He said, "I travail,
[3:04:32] little children. I travail
[3:04:35] in in in in travailing uh like birth
[3:04:38] painans until Christ
[3:04:42] be formed
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; in you."
[3:04:47] And the greatest glory of this end time
[3:04:50] bride is that Christ is formed in her.
[3:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And he said you can't have the
[3:04:59] crowning, the capping until you lay the
[3:05:02] foundation.
[3:05:03] And what did he say the foundation was?
[3:05:06] Faith.
[3:05:11] Stature of the perfect man.
[3:05:14] Faith is the foundation. Anybody in here
[3:05:16] got faith? Let me see your hand. You got
[3:05:18] faith. God can build on that.
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; If you got faith, he can build on that.
[3:05:24] &gt;&gt; How? He can build on that.
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't have no faith."
[3:05:28] You're unscriptural. You do have faith.
[3:05:30] Unto every man is given a measure of
[3:05:32] faith.
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; The faith is there. But there's another
[3:05:35] faith.
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; There's another faith that births.
[3:05:39] There's another faith that forms
[3:05:41] and that is a super sense of faith. And
[3:05:45] if we could have finished this, we would
[3:05:47] have gotten to that because Jesus turns
[3:05:50] to them.
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I will.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; It won't take a m but a minute. Oh, you
[3:06:00] said that already. Who knows? I think
[3:06:03] some of you are mad. I don't know when
[3:06:04] I'll see you again.
[3:06:09] Don't shake my hand and tell me how good
[3:06:11] it was if you clamped down and sat down
[3:06:13] on me when I was trying to deliver it.
[3:06:15] Just keep it to yourself.
[3:06:19] I always depend on Brother Robert.
[3:06:25] And it's not just because he wants his
[3:06:27] voice heard, but it is heard. It is
[3:06:29] heard on every recording.
[3:06:32] And when he's not here, it's missed and
[3:06:34] needed
[3:06:36] like like yours.
[3:06:39] In 11:22,
[3:06:41] Jesus answering saith unto them, have
[3:06:43] faith in God. He's just cursed the tree.
[3:06:49] In the morning in verse 20, they passed
[3:06:51] by, they saw the fig tree dried up from
[3:06:53] the roots.
[3:06:56] And Peter calling to remembrance saith
[3:06:58] unto him, Master, behold the fig tree
[3:06:59] which thou cursest is withered away. I
[3:07:01] want you to know them disciples wasn't
[3:07:03] quite sure what was going on.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; He must have not really wanted breakfast
[3:07:07] if he cursed the very thing that might
[3:07:09] could have given us breakfast tomorrow.
[3:07:12] And then Jesus answered, saith unto
[3:07:14] them, have faith in God.
[3:07:16] My he's going to preach on the
[3:07:18] foundation of it all now. Have faith in
[3:07:19] God. For verily I say unto you, that
[3:07:21] whatsoever or whosoever shall say unto
[3:07:23] this mountain, be thou removed, and be
[3:07:25] thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[3:07:27] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[3:07:28] that those things which he saith shall
[3:07:29] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever.
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; He saith, that's verse 23. He shall have
[3:07:37] whatsoever.
[3:07:39] He saith.
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; Am I not reading it right? Believing you
[3:07:45] sh I must have I'm sorry. I must be
[3:07:47] reading in a different translation.
[3:07:49] didn't even know it. And all things
[3:07:51] whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
[3:07:53] believing.
[3:07:56] Well, doesn't this I think that was
[3:07:57] about the same, wasn't it? Pretty close.
[3:08:01] He was teaching a faith lesson to the
[3:08:03] disciples.
[3:08:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[3:08:04] &gt;&gt; He was bringing a prophetic rebuke to
[3:08:06] Israel,
[3:08:07] &gt;&gt; but he was teaching the talmine, have
[3:08:09] faith.
[3:08:10] &gt;&gt; You see what happens when you curse
[3:08:12] something? The the root the the death
[3:08:14] strikes the root.
[3:08:18] Now, when brother Brandon preached on
[3:08:19] that, you know what he talked about?
[3:08:22] Cancer.
[3:08:25] He probably I don't know, but every time
[3:08:28] I read it recently,
[3:08:31] he went straight to cancer.
[3:08:34] He said the root if if if if we only
[3:08:37] understood, if we only knew the
[3:08:39] authority that we have,
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; we would speak the word of faith,
[3:08:44] that thing would death would strike the
[3:08:46] root of it.
[3:08:48] and choke out the life of the tumor
[3:08:54] potentially every time.
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; Do you always see that result? No.
[3:09:03] Because God has a program and a plan
[3:09:05] that we try to understand, but we fall
[3:09:07] very short of understanding it.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; But it never changes the principle. The
[3:09:12] principle is if you can get the life out
[3:09:14] of the tumor.
[3:09:16] &gt;&gt; Well, just ask the doctor. That's what
[3:09:18] he's trying to do
[3:09:19] &gt;&gt; is get life out of the tumor.
[3:09:24] &gt;&gt; 50 plus years ago, they started telling
[3:09:26] people don't feed the tumor.
[3:09:30] The first thing you do when you find out
[3:09:31] you've got something like that, you you
[3:09:33] stop all processed food and no sugar of
[3:09:36] any form of any kind. That's what they
[3:09:39] started. maybe longer maybe 70 years ago
[3:09:42] they were saying it beginning to say it
[3:09:43] because those things feed the life of
[3:09:46] the tumor. Ain't that interesting? You
[3:09:48] hear brother Brandham didn't know a
[3:09:50] whole lot about science didn't know a
[3:09:51] whole lot about neur neurosciences
[3:09:53] particularly but boy could he lay it out
[3:09:55] there
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; you cut the life off.
[3:09:59] &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm feeling bad. Haven't you done
[3:10:00] that with a wart? Haven't you done that
[3:10:02] with a skin tag?
[3:10:04] &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to cut the life out
[3:10:06] of that thing
[3:10:07] &gt;&gt; and watch it shrivel to die?
[3:10:11] Whatever it is that's ailing us,
[3:10:14] whatever's growing in us, it's foreign,
[3:10:17] it's not ours, it's not of us, it's not
[3:10:19] of our cell structure,
[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; There's power and authority in the name,
[3:10:24] in the word, in the book, in the book,
[3:10:25] in the name, in the blood. And we ought
[3:10:28] to use it. I tell you, we ought to use
[3:10:30] it when we need it. And that's that
[3:10:31] would be just about every day. Let's
[3:10:33] stand. Let's revoke the enemy's easy
[3:10:36] pass.
[3:10:41] There's an eagle that soarses around
[3:10:43] this little bride.
[3:10:46] It It's It's prayer.
[3:10:49] His name is prayer.
[3:10:51] It
[3:10:52] &gt;&gt; He He He's
[3:10:56] here to take your needs higher than you
[3:10:59] can get them.
[3:11:04] Uh intellectual faith can only get them
[3:11:06] so far. But when that super sense of
[3:11:09] faith kicks in,
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you today.
[3:11:19] I want to be in the center of your will.
[3:11:23] The reality is, Lord, we just don't
[3:11:25] always pray about what we do.
[3:11:28] I started to say earlier, but I really
[3:11:30] got the wind kind of knocked out of me
[3:11:32] in the beginning. But I I started to say
[3:11:35] to the people then uh I wonder how many
[3:11:38] of you really pray about uh decisions
[3:11:41] you make and
[3:11:44] uh trips you plan and where you're going
[3:11:47] to be when you're going to be there. I I
[3:11:49] wonder I was going to see if I could
[3:11:51] even get people to raise their hand.
[3:11:54] I I I know it's like this. You say,
[3:11:56] "Pray for me." And everybody says,
[3:11:57] "Well, I'm going to pray for you." And
[3:11:59] sometimes, you know, in your heart that
[3:12:01] you are not going to be in their mind
[3:12:04] until they see you again.
[3:12:06] It's kind of hurtful. And we we have to
[3:12:10] believe that there's somebody that means
[3:12:11] what they say.
[3:12:14] And they're taking our name before the
[3:12:15] Lord daily. I believe it. I believe
[3:12:17] there's a saint in this house. I believe
[3:12:19] there are people in this house that if
[3:12:21] they tell you, "I'm going to pray for
[3:12:22] you," they do. And I'm very thankful for
[3:12:25] those prayers. Aren't you? I I wonder if
[3:12:29] you say to somebody, "Did you pray about
[3:12:30] it?" "Oh, yes, I prayed about it."
[3:12:34] I like to take it further sometimes. I
[3:12:37] don't do it as often as I should. I like
[3:12:40] to take it further and say, "Well, what
[3:12:42] did he say?"
[3:12:44] Well, he didn't really say anything.
[3:12:47] Well, then how do you know?
[3:12:51] How do you know his will?
[3:12:55] just because you asked him if it was so.
[3:12:59] Where was the answer?
[3:13:02] Lord, you said you were going to lead us
[3:13:06] even with your eye.
[3:13:09] Oh,
[3:13:10] [Music]
[3:13:11] thank you for the eye of the Lord. The
[3:13:15] steadfast
[3:13:16] and faithful eyes of the Lord. They they
[3:13:19] watch over us.
[3:13:22] As I stand here, I'm reminded of that
[3:13:25] white eagle
[3:13:26] that hovered over the bed that night
[3:13:29] some many years ago. Two laser lights,
[3:13:33] red glowing laser lights down on my
[3:13:36] chest
[3:13:38] as he examined again the base nature of
[3:13:40] who I am.
[3:13:42] And it so reminded me, Lord, that in one
[3:13:46] glance, you know everything there is to
[3:13:49] know about me
[3:13:56] and not me only,
[3:13:59] but your people.
[3:14:02] We don't want to walk in condemnation
[3:14:04] nor guilt, but we want to walk with a
[3:14:07] sense of care and concern
[3:14:11] for our spiritual health.
[3:14:16] And when we need help, we want to wave
[3:14:18] the flag for somebody to see, I need
[3:14:21] help. It's not not all about a feeling.
[3:14:28] It's about faith.
[3:14:31] Father, I ask you today if you would
[3:14:33] pour some oil on our faith.
[3:14:39] Take it to a higher level as we come
[3:14:42] together just now to worship you before
[3:14:44] we leave.
[3:14:47] Precious Lord,
[3:14:49] precious Jesus,
[3:14:53] don't go too far. We have a little baby
[3:14:55] to dedicate.
[3:15:00] Father, I see that you are drawing
[3:15:04] a line in the sand and I want to be
[3:15:08] standing on your side,
[3:15:12] holding your hand. So let your kingom
[3:15:17] come.
[3:15:19] Let it live in me. This is my prayer.
[3:15:26] This is my plea.
[3:15:29] And father, I see that you are drawing
[3:15:34] a line in the sand. And I want to be
[3:15:38] standing on your side,
[3:15:41] holding your hand. So let your kingom
[3:15:47] come. Let it live in me. This is my
[3:15:53] prayer.
[3:15:55] This is my plea.
[3:15:58] Let the worshippers arise.
[3:16:05] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[3:16:12] I'm surrendering
[3:16:14] my all.
[3:16:20] I surrender to the king.
[3:16:26] Oh, let the worshippers arise.
[3:16:32] [Music]
[3:16:34] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[3:16:41] Lord, I'm surrendering my all.
[3:16:49] I surrender to the king.
[3:16:57] And father, I hear it growing louder.
[3:17:01] It's the song of your redeemed. As the
[3:17:05] saints of every nation,
[3:17:08] they're awakening to sing. And from our
[3:17:12] heart there comes an anthem. Oh, to hear
[3:17:16] the heavens ring. This is our song.
[3:17:21] Oh, a song to our king. Let the
[3:17:25] worshippers arise.
[3:17:29] Oh,
[3:17:31] let the sons and the daughters sing.
[3:17:38] Oh, I'm surrendering my all. I surrender
[3:17:43] to the king. I surrender to the king.
[3:17:51] Oh,
[3:17:52] let the worshippers arise.
[3:17:57] [Music]
[3:17:59] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[3:18:06] Oh, I'm surrendering my all.
[3:18:10] [Music]
[3:18:14] I surrender to the king.
[3:18:19] Oh,
[3:18:21] let the worippers arise.
[3:18:28] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[3:18:35] I'm surrendering my all.
[3:18:42] I surrender to the king.
[3:18:46] [Music]
[3:18:53] set up
[3:18:56] [Music]
[3:18:58] that I can't control. I want more of
[3:19:02] you, God. And I want more of you, God.
[3:19:08] Set a fire down in my soul that I can't
[3:19:12] contain, that I can't control. I want
[3:19:16] more of you, God. I want more of you,
[3:19:22] God. Set a fire down in my soul that I
[3:19:27] can't contain, that I can't control. I
[3:19:31] want more of you, God. Oh, I want more
[3:19:35] of you, God. Won't you set a fire down
[3:19:40] in my soul that I can't contain, that I
[3:19:43] can't control? I want more of you, God.
[3:19:48] And we want more of you, God. Won't you
[3:19:52] set a fire down in my soul that I can't
[3:19:56] contain, that I can't control? I want
[3:20:00] more of you, God. And I want more of
[3:20:04] you, God. There's no place I would
[3:20:07] rather be.
[3:20:10] No place I would rather be. There's no
[3:20:14] place I would rather be. Oh, then here
[3:20:17] in your love. Here in your love. And no
[3:20:21] place I would rather be. There's no
[3:20:24] place I would rather be. And no place I
[3:20:29] would rather be. Oh, then here in your
[3:20:32] love. Right here in your love. There no
[3:20:35] place I would rather be. There's no
[3:20:39] place I would rather be. Oh, no place I
[3:20:43] would rather be than here in your love.
[3:20:47] Right here in your love.
[3:20:50] Set a fire down in my soul that I can't
[3:20:54] contain, that I can't control. I want
[3:20:58] more of you, God. And I want more of
[3:21:02] you, God. Won't you set a fire down in
[3:21:06] my soul that I can't contain, Lord, that
[3:21:09] I can't control? I want more of. Oh, we
[3:21:14] want more.
[3:21:18] Won't you set a fire down in my soul
[3:21:22] that we can't contain, that we can't
[3:21:24] control. Oh, we want more of you, God.
[3:21:29] Oh, we want more of you, God.
[3:21:33] Set a fire down in my soul that I can't
[3:21:37] contain, that I can't control. I want
[3:21:41] more of you, God. And I want more of
[3:21:45] you, God.
[3:21:49] Oh, we want more.
[3:22:02] Lord, we come to you today.
[3:22:06] &gt;&gt; We heard your word this morning, Lord.
[3:22:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, any access we've allowed to the
[3:22:13] enemy,
[3:22:15] &gt;&gt; we retract it.
[3:22:16] &gt;&gt; We take it back. We take authority over
[3:22:18] our families, over our homes. We say you
[3:22:22] have no place.
[3:22:23] &gt;&gt; You're not welcome in a child of God's
[3:22:25] home. You're not welcome on this
[3:22:27] property.
[3:22:30] any access that we've allowed on this
[3:22:32] property. Lord, we take it back.
[3:22:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for this place. We
[3:22:37] thank you for the the peace that we feel
[3:22:39] when we drive on.
[3:22:42] &gt;&gt; Let us not take that for granted, Lord.
[3:22:46] &gt;&gt; Let us take what we've heard seriously.
[3:22:48] Let us take this time seriously.
[3:22:51] Let us press into what you have for us.
[3:22:54] Not just when we come corporately, Lord,
[3:22:56] but every day.
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; Whenever we can have a minute, a second,
[3:23:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask that you would just speak
[3:23:03] to us. Speak to us as individuals, Lord.
[3:23:07] &gt;&gt; In this season, let us have a servant's
[3:23:09] heart.
[3:23:10] &gt;&gt; When we see a need, Lord, we ask that
[3:23:12] you would just give us a servant's
[3:23:14] heart. Even if that's not a part of our
[3:23:16] nature, Lord, I ask that you would just
[3:23:18] give us that heart to say, "Yes, I'll do
[3:23:21] it." Lord, I ask that you would just
[3:23:24] help us in this season. Help us to
[3:23:25] prepare our our lives
[3:23:28] &gt;&gt; as we come into camp meeting. Lord, we
[3:23:30] ask that we would prepare our lives to
[3:23:32] be able to help someone else.
[3:23:38] &gt;&gt; Use us for your glory, Lord.
[3:23:42] Use us for your glory, Lord.
[3:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:23:46] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord.
[3:23:49] We thank you, Lord. Amen.
[3:23:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just by faith claim
[3:23:55] every promise
[3:23:57] &gt;&gt; that you have made us in your word,
[3:24:00] &gt;&gt; every promise that you have personally
[3:24:03] made by your spirit to us.
[3:24:07] &gt;&gt; We realize and recognize that some of it
[3:24:09] requires labor. It requires preparation.
[3:24:13] And we come to you again asking for
[3:24:16] grace, strength, leadership to prepare
[3:24:20] our hearts.
[3:24:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:24:22] &gt;&gt; the one thing that we never want is to
[3:24:26] forfeit.
[3:24:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to claim.
[3:24:34] We want to possess.
[3:24:37] &gt;&gt; You said footsteps means possession.
[3:24:40] We want to step all over our promises,
[3:24:43] claim them as our own,
[3:24:47] &gt;&gt; not let them filter
[3:24:49] &gt;&gt; to someone else because we refuse.
[3:24:54] &gt;&gt; We say yes
[3:24:56] &gt;&gt; to whatever you have for us, Lord.
[3:24:59] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:25:01] &gt;&gt; we step into your feast and we take the
[3:25:04] lowest seat. We'll be faithful in the
[3:25:07] few things
[3:25:09] &gt;&gt; because you said Lord that if we would
[3:25:11] be faithful in the few things, you would
[3:25:13] give us rulership and authority over
[3:25:16] many things.
[3:25:17] &gt;&gt; So we surrender to you right now. Lord,
[3:25:20] I pray for every mom, every dad,
[3:25:25] every husband, every wife.
[3:25:28] If there is any way, and I don't mean
[3:25:30] fanaticism, Lord, may we not go out of
[3:25:34] here paranoid,
[3:25:37] may we go out of here spiritled,
[3:25:40] Lord,
[3:25:40] &gt;&gt; but may we go out conscientious and
[3:25:43] sensitive to your spirit.
[3:25:46] Show us, Lord, anywhere, anything
[3:25:50] that we might have taken in that has
[3:25:54] caused the enemy
[3:25:56] &gt;&gt; to have the easy path.
[3:26:01] I saw, Lord, that there were angels that
[3:26:04] had actually tried to on our behalf
[3:26:09] revoke the enemy's privilege.
[3:26:12] But I saw that it was not their
[3:26:14] responsibility
[3:26:16] and therefore their efforts could not be
[3:26:18] successful.
[3:26:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[3:26:20] &gt;&gt; you have called us to be Lord over our
[3:26:23] homes, over our families. And when we
[3:26:25] say that, not in a rulership way, but in
[3:26:29] a way to claim authority and
[3:26:32] responsibility.
[3:26:34] &gt;&gt; And we do that right now. We want our
[3:26:36] children's minds to be clean and
[3:26:38] wholesome and holy. and we want to see
[3:26:41] them growing in the things of God. And
[3:26:44] how can we sew into someone else's life
[3:26:47] when we're allowing the enemy such uh
[3:26:51] such free range
[3:26:53] in our own business?
[3:26:56] We just say you're a trespasser
[3:26:58] regardless.
[3:27:00] You knew when you walked in you didn't
[3:27:02] belong here. And we say to the Lord,
[3:27:04] forgive us, oh God, for laying down our
[3:27:07] responsibility as watchmen for our
[3:27:09] family,
[3:27:11] for our household,
[3:27:13] but we also thank you for the leadership
[3:27:16] and wisdom that the Holy Spirit brings
[3:27:18] to our lives. And we just say we
[3:27:21] surrender. Why don't you just do that
[3:27:23] now? I realize some of you are
[3:27:26] struggling. I pray God will give you
[3:27:28] grace and help you get over it.
[3:27:32] Nonetheless,
[3:27:34] we're here to surrender.
[3:27:36] &gt;&gt; We lay it all before you, Lord.
[3:27:40] We thank you for every good and perfect
[3:27:42] gift.
[3:27:43] &gt;&gt; It's because of you.
[3:27:46] It's because of you.
[3:27:49] Thank you for the prayer warriors.
[3:27:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you for those who stand in the
[3:27:53] gap.
[3:27:57] Thank you for those who strain the
[3:27:59] hardest to hear your voice in all
[3:28:02] things.
[3:28:08] You're holy.
[3:28:11] You're so holy, Lord.
[3:28:15] &gt;&gt; You're holy,
[3:28:17] Jesus.
[3:28:19] Somebody just tell him with your words,
[3:28:20] you're holy, God. You're holy.
[3:28:24] You're set apart from everything else.
[3:28:26] You're holy.
[3:28:29] May we walk before you in holiness.
[3:28:34] It's the character of God.
[3:28:38] &gt;&gt; It's not religion. It's not fancy
[3:28:40] leaves.
[3:28:43] The scripture goes on to say, you'll
[3:28:45] you'll know a tree
[3:28:48] not by the leaves,
[3:28:51] not by the healthy color. You'll know a
[3:28:54] tree by the fruit it bears.
[3:28:57] Lord, may we bear fruit in this season.
[3:29:08] I remember the man in the Bible who
[3:29:10] said, "Oh, oh, give me a chance.
[3:29:13] Let me prune it. Let me let me fertilize
[3:29:16] it.
[3:29:18] Let me dig around it." Right? Let me see
[3:29:21] if I can't save.
[3:29:24] Let's see if I can't get the life moving
[3:29:25] again. Lord, may we be that steward
[3:29:28] today.
[3:29:30] &gt;&gt; May we say, "Oh, God, give me the grace
[3:29:32] to dig around my own roots.
[3:29:38] and we just prophesy life to the root
[3:29:42] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[3:29:45] &gt;&gt; Just lay your hand gently and quickly on
[3:29:47] someone next to you. Father, we stand in
[3:29:50] agreement
[3:29:51] &gt;&gt; with one another. We want to see each
[3:29:53] other go higher.
[3:29:56] &gt;&gt; I want to see brothers go higher. I want
[3:29:58] to see sisters go higher. I want our
[3:30:01] teenagers higher. our children, Lord,
[3:30:05] each discerning on their own level the
[3:30:08] importance, the priorities.
[3:30:11] We want to see them growing. We want to
[3:30:13] see them soaring,
[3:30:14] [Music]
[3:30:18] strengthened in every way.
[3:30:21] If the foundation is right, the house
[3:30:23] can be built right.
[3:30:26] &gt;&gt; If the foundation is wrong,
[3:30:30] &gt;&gt; the house will fall flat.
[3:30:33] Lord, let us get the faith foundation
[3:30:35] right right now. Faith is the substance
[3:30:38] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[3:30:40] things not seen. May we see that a
[3:30:43] relationship with you
[3:30:45] &gt;&gt; is not just a small part of our life.
[3:30:50] &gt;&gt; It's the reason why we were born.
[3:30:53] Lord, bless my sister. Bless my brother,
[3:30:56] bless those who have an active
[3:31:00] visible part and those who behind the
[3:31:05] scenes carry a great portion of the
[3:31:07] load.
[3:31:12] Let peace surround us.
[3:31:15] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't call this a peaceful service,
[3:31:17] but you're a peaceful God.
[3:31:20] &gt;&gt; Let peace surround us.
[3:31:22] as we come and give this little
[3:31:24] beautiful baby girl back to you. Come,
[3:31:26] Lord, and remind us of the great value
[3:31:30] of life.
[3:31:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:31:32] &gt;&gt; How fleeting it can be.
[3:31:38] Greet your brother, your sister that
[3:31:40] you're with. And when you can, slip back
[3:31:42] to your seat. We're going to make this
[3:31:43] as quick as possible for those of you
[3:31:46] who are in a hurry and need to go now.
[3:31:48] It's been a long service.
[3:31:54] Ben and Kendra, come and
[3:32:00] whoever's coming to stand with you,
[3:32:02] whoever you've asked to do that.
[3:32:22] Today is Fouse's birthday.
[3:32:26] We say happy birthday to Sister Fouse in
[3:32:29] Japan.
[3:32:32] Tuesday is Paul West's birthday and
[3:32:36] he's getting uh to the place of almost
[3:32:39] being Hawaii,
[3:32:42] but not quite, but almost.
[3:32:45] Uh, it would have been our beautiful
[3:32:48] Jennifer's birthday on Tuesday.
[3:32:51] There are no birthdays in heaven. I'm
[3:32:53] sorry to disappoint you there.
[3:32:56] It's called eternity.
[3:33:00] The days don't run in 365 days. The
[3:33:03] years don't run in 365 days. Every day,
[3:33:06] if you if you love your birthday, every
[3:33:08] day is your birthday. If you hated your
[3:33:10] birthday, you'll never have one. So, it
[3:33:12] doesn't matter.
[3:33:14] And on Tuesday is Ezekiel Joseph's
[3:33:17] birthday.
[3:33:20] Grace, and that's what mom and daddy
[3:33:22] need lots of.
[3:33:25] Where is he? Hey, it's your birthday
[3:33:28] coming up. Hi.
[3:33:33] And then Saturday is Hannah Elizabeth's
[3:33:37] birthday. Where is she?
[3:33:42] Happy birthday.
[3:33:45] And today is Vivian's day, not her
[3:33:48] birthday. I'm sorry. I could have My
[3:33:51] legs aren't the big part of me. It's up
[3:33:53] here. I could have got by.
[3:34:10] I hope you can always be as sweet as you
[3:34:12] are beautiful.
[3:34:17] You'll have to work hard at it because
[3:34:18] you are some pretty.
[3:34:22] This is pat. You don't have to fret.
[3:34:25] Close your eyes.
[3:34:30] Go right back to sleep. Father, Lord
[3:34:34] Jesus, we thank you for this beautiful
[3:34:37] baby girl that you've given to Ben and
[3:34:39] Kendra. Lord, we lift Vivian Joe up to
[3:34:43] you.
[3:34:45] And we just ask, oh God, that you would
[3:34:47] continue to surround her in every way.
[3:34:52] bless her body physically, keep her
[3:34:55] whole.
[3:34:56] Uh Lord, uh anoint her immune system to
[3:35:00] fight off all the germs and things that
[3:35:04] go around to make us sick.
[3:35:08] Lord, may she be protected in every
[3:35:12] other way
[3:35:14] until she's old enough to make you her
[3:35:16] choice.
[3:35:18] We're so thankful for her. We're so
[3:35:21] thankful.
[3:35:24] May she, Lord, know that she is deeply
[3:35:27] loved by her mom and dad and sisters and
[3:35:31] her extended family,
[3:35:34] her faith family.
[3:35:37] May she never have to wonder.
[3:35:40] May she always know.
[3:35:42] Lord, use her. If you've let her be born
[3:35:45] here at the end time, there must be a
[3:35:48] purpose for her life that perhaps is
[3:35:50] bigger than generations before her. Use
[3:35:53] her for your glory.
[3:35:56] May her mind be protected from the
[3:35:58] onslaught
[3:36:00] of this wicked world around us. May she
[3:36:02] never know the sting of Leodysia.
[3:36:06] May she only know the peace
[3:36:09] of those who live in the city.
[3:36:12] Glory be to God.
[3:36:17] You see how she's looking?
[3:36:23] I see you.
[3:36:28] Excuse us. We're just having a moment.
[3:36:33] I see you want to smile,
[3:36:35] but you're not sure. Now, let Daddy
[3:36:38] pray. God didn't give you to me. I tried
[3:36:41] to take you. It didn't work.
[3:36:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. She laughed. You see her? She
[3:36:45] went,
[3:36:46] "God gave you to Ben and Kendra
[3:36:49] Ellsworth."
[3:36:51] So, they're the only ones that can give
[3:36:53] you back to God.
[3:36:56] Oh my.
[3:37:00] You're like candy.
[3:37:05] Can you pray loud without the mic?
[3:37:11] Cheese.
[3:37:47] Jesus.
[3:37:51] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[3:38:01] [Music]
[3:38:23] Lord, we thank you for this extended
[3:38:26] family, for Mimi and uncles and aunts
[3:38:30] and cousins. And Lord, we just ask also
[3:38:34] for the church family that we could be
[3:38:37] all that she would need us to be.
[3:38:42] She's not just another baby in the
[3:38:44] church. Lord, everyone you give us, we
[3:38:48] want to see their value and realize
[3:38:53] the great responsibility of stewarding a
[3:38:55] life, trying to move a spirit, a soul
[3:38:58] toward you.
[3:39:00] May we take it seriously.
[3:39:05] Why don't you all turn around and let
[3:39:07] everybody see how beautiful she's
[3:39:09] looking today?
[3:39:14] And because
[3:39:16] he lives,
[3:39:18] [Music]
[3:39:21] I can face

[3:39:30] he lives.
[3:39:33] You're still too. All fear
[3:39:38] is gone.
[3:39:42] And because
[3:39:44] I know congratulations
[3:39:46] [Music]
[3:39:49] big sisters,
[3:39:51] &gt;&gt; cousins
[3:39:54] &gt;&gt; and life is worth a living. Let me get
[3:39:56] Isaiah.
[3:39:59] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[3:40:03] &gt;&gt; You okay? You're bandaged.
[3:40:09] And because
[3:40:11] he lives.
[3:40:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:40:15] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. For a minute
[3:40:18] &gt;&gt; tomorrow
[3:40:21] [Music]
[3:40:23] because
[3:40:25] he lives.
[3:40:28] &gt;&gt; Look around all these people.
[3:40:30] &gt;&gt; All fear is gone.
[3:40:33] &gt;&gt; Stranger than others, but they're all
[3:40:35] good people. on
[3:40:37] because
[3:40:39] I know
[3:40:42] I know he holds the future.
[3:40:48] [Music]
[3:40:50] My life is worth the living
[3:40:56] just because
[3:40:59] he lives.
[3:41:04] How sweet to hold
[3:41:10] a newborn
[3:41:14] baby
[3:41:18] and feel the pride
[3:41:22] [Music]
[3:41:24] and joy
[3:41:26] they bring. You do. You do. God greater
[3:41:34] still
[3:41:38] this calm
[3:41:40] assur.
[3:41:43] Am I startling you?
[3:41:45] &gt;&gt; This child
[3:41:47] Vivian can face uncertain
[3:41:51] days because
[3:41:54] he lives.
[3:41:56] Sing the last time. And because
[3:42:01] he lives,
[3:42:02] &gt;&gt; because Jesus lives,
[3:42:05] I can face tomorrow.
[3:42:10] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt about it
[3:42:12] &gt;&gt; because
[3:42:14] he lives.
[3:42:18] Oh, all fear is gone.
[3:42:25] on
[3:42:26] because
[3:42:28] I know
[3:42:33] he holds my future.
[3:42:37] [Music]
[3:42:39] &gt;&gt; My life
[3:42:40] &gt;&gt; in my life is worth
[3:42:44] living
[3:42:46] just because
[3:42:49] he lives.
[3:42:52] Lord, go with us and keep us in your
[3:42:55] tender care and help us to serve you
[3:42:58] with all that we are. In the lovely name
[3:43:00] of Jesus Christ, we pray. Saints said,
[3:43:04] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[3:43:06] Amen. You're dismissed to go.
[3:43:12] Who are you looking at? Who are you
[3:43:14] looking at, Vivian?
