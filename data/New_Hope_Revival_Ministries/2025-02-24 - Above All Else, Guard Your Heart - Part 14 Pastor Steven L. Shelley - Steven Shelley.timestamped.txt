[43:30] right now in you and even before we were
[43:35] born you found us in you it's in you
[43:38] where we are redeemed where we have our
[43:41] peace where we have our healing and
[43:44] right now we find ourselves in Christ we
[43:49] are in Heavenly places when right now in
[43:53] Christ Jesus because of the blood of the

[44:01] complicated but Lord we're reaching
[44:04] right now with our faith we believe you
[44:07] are the king of kings you are alive and
[44:11] in you flows healing
[44:16] Deliverance the enemy will try to
[44:19] disqualify us but the blood it qualifies
[44:22] us

[45:57] [Applause]
[45:59] lord it's good to have the mans back
[46:02] today they yeah
[46:07] might I think so how long have you all
[46:10] been married now five months that is
[46:12] very newly
[46:14] yeah nice to meet the brother there
[46:17] wonderful God bless all of you we're so
[46:19] glad that you're here today brother man
[46:21] had to be called out to work last
[46:25] weekend when the store storm hit but
[46:27] we're glad that they're here today we're
[46:29] glad to see all of you just uh honored
[46:33] to be in the house of the Lord the Lord
[46:34] is faithful to us in every way we're
[46:38] going to receive the tithe and offering
[46:40] today for the purposes of the Kingdom
[46:42] brother Kate is already at the piano
[46:44] he's going to sing you know I I was
[46:48] reading something that I had written um
[46:51] some months ago I was reading it today
[46:54] just before coming to service a lot of
[46:58] times we don't say anything when it's
[47:01] time for the tithe and the offering we
[47:03] don't say a lot about it um and it
[47:06] becomes a ritual to us and tithing
[47:11] should never be a ritual to us because
[47:14] it is keeping Covenant with the lord
[47:16] it's it's what he has asked of us and so
[47:19] we keep that uh that Covenant with him
[47:23] and and our offering that we give to him
[47:25] you know we talk about projects that
[47:27] we're doing sometimes and and you're
[47:29] giving and of course it helps to keep
[47:31] the lights on and all of that kind of
[47:33] stuff but you know anytime that we give
[47:35] to the Lord we want to give with purpose
[47:38] we want to give because what we're
[47:41] actually doing is we're putting our
[47:43] faith to the prophetic Vision what God
[47:46] is doing on this property what he's
[47:49] doing with this body now what he does in
[47:52] other bodies that's what God gave to
[47:54] them but what he does here when you give
[47:56] give you are actually putting your faith
[47:59] your might your dollars behind the
[48:01] prophetic vision and you are putting
[48:04] your blessing on it saying I agree with
[48:06] this I agree with what God is doing and
[48:09] so as you give your tithe and offering
[48:11] today keep that in mind I am giving this
[48:14] as unto the Lord always it's unto the
[48:16] Lord but I am giving it in faith
[48:19] believing in the prophetic vision of
[48:21] this house and what the Lord is doing on
[48:23] our behalf so brother Ellas can I call
[48:26] on you brother Austin Yantis I'll call
[48:28] on you Jesse I forgot to welcome you I'm
[48:31] so glad that you're here glad I look
[48:33] that

[48:40] military but we're glad that he is back

[55:21] 40
[55:22] people and uh we have to come and press
[55:28] in and you've done well this morning and
[55:31] part of that is because these musicians
[55:34] create such a lovely atmosphere for us
[55:37] to come and worship the Lord in spirit
[55:39] and in truth I have no apologies that
[55:43] Hawke is H praying a few syllables in
[55:47] another language I'm not going to
[55:49] apologize to you or any other preacher
[55:52] or because they get on my last nerves
[55:56] when they're preaching and they say oh I
[55:58] feel like speaking in tongue oh I feel
[56:01] like well he felt it and there's liberty
[56:05] in this house and he did it if it
[56:08] confused
[56:10] anybody if there are any unbelievers or
[56:13] non-believers here and that confused you
[56:15] I'll be glad to see you after church and
[56:18] explain to you what it's about I don't
[56:20] think we have uh offended the Apostle
[56:23] Paul
[56:28] you know he's the character that said I
[56:30] speak in tongues more than you all so I
[56:33] think we're
[56:34] okay um and if not you streaming and you
[56:39] can just turn it off and find something
[56:42] else more
[56:43] edifying but I like Liberty where the
[56:46] spirit of the Lord is we're not going to
[56:49] let folks go on forever like that
[56:51] without some interpretation but I'm so
[56:54] thankful for the authority
[56:56] that we can catch in prayer would you
[56:59] thank the Lord for these
[57:03] [Applause]

[57:30] most awful debilitating humiliating
[57:33] diseases that people can suffer and uh I
[57:37] am did the musicians really go
[57:39] down I guess that really normally is the
[57:42] key isn't it I have a
[57:46] song I guess when I say clap for them
[57:49] that really usually is that well I
[57:50] changed my
[57:53] mind let us see you all peeking back

[59:17] right
[59:20] along all the more you know him the more

[59:33] attending another church but this is
[59:35] their church and I saw it on the
[59:37] calendar and I thought well she's still
[59:40] grieving the loss of her husband so
[59:42] let's pray she has a particularly
[59:44] blessed birthday today that God will be
[59:47] with her tomorrow is is our
[59:49] daughter-in-law's birthday Jenna and uh
[59:52] she is uh out of town in Texas visiting
[59:55] her parents and some friends that were
[59:57] going to be in town for a few days she's
[59:59] a brave girl to get on airplane with a
[1:00:01] bab 9-month old baby by herself but God
[1:00:04] was so gracious helped him every step of
[1:00:06] the way and there was a gentleman
[1:00:09] sitting beside her it didn't say a word
[1:00:10] the whole flight as the plane landed he
[1:00:14] looked over and said let me help you get
[1:00:16] your bag she said oh no no no that's all

[1:11:01] man good
[1:11:02] job
[1:11:04] amen open your Bibles this
[1:11:07] morning
[1:11:11] wo I used to sing that when I was
[1:11:14] 19 and it sure was
[1:11:17] easier had a lot more breath but uh
[1:11:21] still singing but uh I could use an
[1:11:24] oxygen mask about now if anybody's got
[1:11:26] one proverbs 4 you know the scripture
[1:11:30] you know the series this is the
[1:11:32] characteristics of and
[1:11:35] strongholds of the spirit of offense
[1:11:38] this is uh part
[1:11:41] three of dealing with anger and
[1:11:46] offense offense is the big the big daddy
[1:11:51] but he
[1:11:53] partners and
[1:11:55] manifests with all kinds of other ugly
[1:11:59] Spirits negative spirits and if you are
[1:12:03] a person who's got a little root of
[1:12:05] anger in you oh my when you get offended
[1:12:09] you hold on to it longer and that anger
[1:12:13] Foams up the Amplified version said
[1:12:15] Foams up in you you fly off the
[1:12:20] handle and uh God's not
[1:12:23] pleased well
[1:12:25] he's just not pleased and so we keep
[1:12:29] pressing we keep pressing uh we've got
[1:12:32] to we've got to see it before we can do
[1:12:36] anything about it amen but when we see
[1:12:39] it we can we have authority over it when
[1:12:41] we see it we begin to have authority
[1:12:45] over it we can deal with it and we can
[1:12:48] give people in our lives permission to
[1:12:50] call us out
[1:12:52] hello a husband can say to his wife call
[1:12:55] me
[1:12:57] out you you can't get mad at her if you
[1:13:00] told her to call me out when you see me
[1:13:03] moving in
[1:13:05] anger because I want to have a right
[1:13:08] spirit before God you can have all the
[1:13:11] Revelation you can understand the
[1:13:13] mystery you can know why the prophet
[1:13:14] came you can get all the seals together
[1:13:18] you might even be one of those who
[1:13:19] thinks they've got all the
[1:13:21] Thunders but if you can't deal with
[1:13:24] those
[1:13:25] issues of offense and anger and
[1:13:28] bitterness and jealousy and
[1:13:30] resentment uh you haven't won the battle
[1:13:34] brother brandom didn't say the last
[1:13:35] battle the great battle that was going
[1:13:37] to be fought in the end time he didn't
[1:13:39] say it was going to be over the
[1:13:40] Mysteries he said the battlefield is
[1:13:43] going to be the battlefield of the mine
[1:13:45] he wasn't talking to the church world he
[1:13:47] was talking to the bride so isn't it
[1:13:49] good to know we've only got one more
[1:13:51] battle got one more and everything thing
[1:13:55] we deal with is it it surrounds it kind
[1:13:57] of comes around that one battle it's a
[1:13:59] mind battle your your problem is in your
[1:14:02] mind and your Victory is in your mind
[1:14:06] and the word of God defeats his enemy
[1:14:08] all the time under any circumstances
[1:14:12] Proverbs 4:23 says keep thy heart with
[1:14:15] all diligence for out of it are the
[1:14:21] issues of Life put away from thee a
[1:14:25] forward mouth uh and perverse lips put
[1:14:29] far from thee let thine eyes look right
[1:14:32] on and let thine eyelids look straight
[1:14:36] before thee Ponder the path of thy feet
[1:14:42] and let all thy ways be established turn
[1:14:47] not to the right hand nor nor the left
[1:14:52] come on remove thy foot from
[1:14:57] evil Lord Jesus we thank you that you
[1:15:00] have called us to be alert and you have
[1:15:04] called us to be sober to be vigilant the
[1:15:08] New Testament tells us because we have
[1:15:11] an
[1:15:12] adversary who roams about like a roaring
[1:15:17] lion seeking whom he can devour but you
[1:15:22] gave us the promise in your word greater
[1:15:24] is he that is in us than he that is in
[1:15:27] the world and we have a lion not one
[1:15:31] acting as a lion but we have a lion the
[1:15:34] The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:15:38] prevailed and he lives in this little
[1:15:41] bride and when we praise the Living God
[1:15:45] he Roars from our lungs it's the sound
[1:15:49] of the king when we praise you and when
[1:15:52] we press through our feeling and worship
[1:15:56] you anyway it's it's that lion who's
[1:16:00] sounding and roaring within us he gives
[1:16:03] us the victory because he is also the
[1:16:06] lamb that was slain before the
[1:16:09] foundation of the world come Lord Jesus
[1:16:13] and let your word find an anointed
[1:16:15] lodging place in our lives and we will
[1:16:18] give you all the praise all the honor
[1:16:21] and all the glory for it's in the most
[1:16:23] lovely and exalted name name of the Lord
[1:16:26] Jesus Christ that we pray and the Saints
[1:16:28] said you may be seated thank you for uh
[1:16:32] all the time that you spent standing in
[1:16:35] the service this morning the word
[1:16:38] offense is from a Greek word scandalon
[1:16:42] and it means a stumbling block or a trap
[1:16:45] a snare and it actually means the place
[1:16:49] that you put the bait if you had a mouse
[1:16:53] trap for instance
[1:16:55] and there's that little place where you
[1:16:57] put the cheese and uh the the little
[1:17:00] mouse comes around to get that cheese
[1:17:02] and that place where the cheese would
[1:17:05] lay is the scandalon in Greek it means
[1:17:08] the bait the place where the bait is
[1:17:11] when you start looking at that and
[1:17:13] recognize that when we're reading
[1:17:15] through the scripture and we read the
[1:17:17] word offense for instance when Jesus
[1:17:19] talks about offense the word is where
[1:17:23] the cheese is laid where the bait is
[1:17:26] we've got an adversary who's got a bait
[1:17:29] out for us we have to make up our mind
[1:17:32] by the word of the Lord by the strength
[1:17:34] of the Holy Ghost within us that we are
[1:17:36] not going to take the devil's bait I
[1:17:39] want to hear somebody say Amen now you
[1:17:41] got to make up for all those folks that
[1:17:42] aren't here this morning with their amen
[1:17:45] somebody said we're going to be
[1:17:46] streaming somebody said we're going to
[1:17:47] be pulling from home well I don't hear
[1:17:50] you when you're at home but I hope I can
[1:17:53] feel you in a little while but we want
[1:17:55] to get somewhere this morning and when
[1:17:58] we look uh I don't want to spend a lot
[1:18:00] of time in a in a review but when we
[1:18:02] look at that word offense there's a a
[1:18:05] slew of synonyms do you still have those
[1:18:09] charity you could put those a slew of
[1:18:11] synonyms for the word offense because
[1:18:13] some people like to say well I'm not
[1:18:15] easily offended oh you're not well let's
[1:18:18] see if we can uh can pull up these
[1:18:21] synony annoyed are you easily annoyed
[1:18:26] I'm leaving a little time here for you
[1:18:27] to say oh me do you get angry resentment
[1:18:32] indignation
[1:18:33] irritation come on
[1:18:35] men exasperation come on
[1:18:39] women wrath displeasure disapproval
[1:18:42] dislike hard bad or ill feelings
[1:18:50] disgruntlement
[1:18:52] animosity vexation
[1:18:55] aversion opposition and enmity all
[1:18:59] synonyms words with similar
[1:19:03] meanings now offense is one thing to
[1:19:06] deal with but what we find out is that
[1:19:09] that Spirits run together I mentioned to
[1:19:12] you last Sunday that brother Brandon
[1:19:14] would sometimes be uh coming toward a
[1:19:16] prayer line and maybe already in a
[1:19:19] prayer line praying for somebody tell
[1:19:21] people if you particularly sense that a
[1:19:24] demon presence was there he would say
[1:19:26] bow your head and and because that demon
[1:19:29] when he comes out he's going to be
[1:19:31] looking for a place to go he's going to
[1:19:33] find a similar lodging place do you
[1:19:36] understand they know where they can go
[1:19:39] they know what kind of people are opened
[1:19:41] and what kind of people are closed in
[1:19:44] fact we hear brother Brandon more than
[1:19:46] once saying uh oh my what's that I'm
[1:19:48] paraphrasing I can read them if you need
[1:19:51] them uh oh my what's that he said
[1:19:53] there's a spirit over there crying out
[1:19:56] to a spirit over here he's looking for
[1:19:59] help we might say he's looking for
[1:20:03] reinforcement you know one spirit is I
[1:20:06] is might be easier to deal with but when
[1:20:09] they partner when they when they
[1:20:12] cooperate then you've got a bigger issue
[1:20:15] and we find that offense never likes to
[1:20:19] work
[1:20:20] alone and we're not talking about
[1:20:23] legitimately getting your feelings hurt
[1:20:25] legitimately somebody wrongs you
[1:20:28] legitimately you can be offended and not
[1:20:31] have a demon Spirit operating in your
[1:20:33] life I want you to know but if you are
[1:20:37] offended and it's not because there's an
[1:20:40] evil spirit trying to attack your life
[1:20:42] you've got to get rid of that thing
[1:20:46] now uh uh for instance we mentioned the
[1:20:49] scripture said be
[1:20:51] angry and send not let not the sun go
[1:20:56] down on your wrath which means you're
[1:21:00] going to get angry sometime but you've
[1:21:02] got to let that go that means we can't
[1:21:05] let it build
[1:21:06] overnight When the Sun Goes Down in the
[1:21:10] Hebrew it means a new day has begun you
[1:21:13] and I look at a new day when the sun
[1:21:15] comes up but the Bible and Hebrew
[1:21:18] scripture looks at a new day when the
[1:21:20] sun goes down and the morning and the
[1:21:24] evening
[1:21:25] evening the evening and the morning were
[1:21:28] the first day and the evening and the
[1:21:30] morning were the second day so when that
[1:21:33] sun goes down you got to turn loose of
[1:21:35] that anger you've got to forgive who has
[1:21:38] legitimately wronged you and hurt your
[1:21:41] feelings so that when you get out of the
[1:21:42] bed the next
[1:21:44] morning it's
[1:21:46] gone well you act like it's easy I don't
[1:21:49] remember saying it was easy have you
[1:21:52] ever slept on it and woke up the next
[1:21:53] morning preach
[1:21:55] and still had something to deal mhm yes
[1:21:58] oh yes and uh you know we think sometime
[1:22:01] our answer is to stay away from
[1:22:04] folks but you don't have to have nobody
[1:22:06] around you on to
[1:22:10] Stew come on De simmer you and you you
[1:22:14] you you know me myself and I we can do a
[1:22:17] lot simmering and and and regurgitating
[1:22:21] and you know all this stuff and gets on
[1:22:24] it us so as Believers these things are
[1:22:27] going to come Jesus said you better know
[1:22:28] offenses are going to come and as we
[1:22:31] reach the end of the end they're going
[1:22:32] to come more often and and he said but
[1:22:35] just make sure you're not the one doing
[1:22:37] the
[1:22:38] offending he said it I'm paraphrasing
[1:22:41] but he said it so what we look at is we
[1:22:44] find that there are three categories of
[1:22:47] partnering spirits that operate with
[1:22:50] offense uh the first category is the
[1:22:53] self-centered nature of offense you see
[1:22:57] the reality is we are easily
[1:23:00] offended because we are focusing on
[1:23:06] ourselves it's not all about
[1:23:09] you I love saying
[1:23:12] that it's not all about me it's not all
[1:23:16] about you this is a big old
[1:23:19] world I don't want to hurt your feelings
[1:23:22] and and be a and and you be offend Ed
[1:23:25] and leave here with an offense but the
[1:23:28] reality is we don't want you to go but
[1:23:31] if you pass from this life uh tomorrow
[1:23:36] we're going to cry we're going to the
[1:23:38] loss will be great but the reality is
[1:23:41] the sun's going to rise and it's going
[1:23:44] to set and life has to go on whether we
[1:23:48] want it to or not it has to go on it
[1:23:51] doesn't all center around you and once
[1:23:54] we realize that we will begin to
[1:23:57] understand that offense is really an
[1:24:01] issue sometime of just focusing on our
[1:24:04] own feelings instead of thinking about
[1:24:07] somebody else and these are the
[1:24:09] characteristics of someone who has a
[1:24:11] fence that is rooted with a
[1:24:14] self-centered nature easily
[1:24:17] provoked prideful Behavior
[1:24:21] self-focus Uh second category the
[1:24:23] stronghold of B Bess if your offense has
[1:24:27] brought you into the realm of bitterness
[1:24:30] brother brandham talks about bitterness
[1:24:31] don't you ever let that root of
[1:24:32] bitterness spring up in your life he
[1:24:35] said when you do that when you take on
[1:24:37] those things you you are shutting
[1:24:39] yourself out of the Kingdom that's
[1:24:42] pretty heavy words isn't it uh and and
[1:24:45] underneath that is bitterness holding
[1:24:47] grudges and unforgiveness you've got to
[1:24:50] let it go and then number three there
[1:24:54] are those who operate with a with a
[1:24:56] spirit of offense and it behaves with
[1:25:00] isolation
[1:25:02] misinterpretation gossip
[1:25:04] slander and this causes Division if
[1:25:08] there's ever been an hour Church where
[1:25:10] we need to be
[1:25:13] together it's now we need a Unity that
[1:25:17] can't be uh manufactured a Unity that
[1:25:21] only the Holy Spirit can bring when we
[1:25:24] make up our minds to live the
[1:25:27] unoffendable life is it really possible
[1:25:30] to live an unoffendable life it is but
[1:25:33] it's an ascended life and that doesn't
[1:25:36] mean some Eastern mysticism it means
[1:25:38] getting up above your stuff it means
[1:25:41] being who God called you to be and
[1:25:43] anointed you with a flying eagle
[1:25:46] anointing and that flying eagle
[1:25:49] anointing wants to lift you up above
[1:25:52] your hurt your father issues your mama
[1:25:55] issues your come on your
[1:25:58] past we got to get past our past we've
[1:26:01] got to deal with stinking thinking we've
[1:26:04] got to realize the way to win this mind
[1:26:07] battle is to meditate on the word of the
[1:26:10] Lord the truth of the hour what God has
[1:26:13] given us let somebody squeeze out an
[1:26:16] amen even if it hurts you get it
[1:26:18] squeezed out would you and so we're
[1:26:21] talking about the first of the spirits
[1:26:24] a and it's anger and I'm going to just
[1:26:26] read the one one scripture and then move
[1:26:29] to the new material this morning
[1:26:31] Proverbs 14 17 King James he that is
[1:26:35] soon angry dealth foolishly and a man of
[1:26:40] wicked devices is hated Amplified
[1:26:43] handles it this way and this is the this
[1:26:47] really needs to be said because this is
[1:26:49] how anger operates the Greek word there
[1:26:52] soon angry I is is a word as you might
[1:26:57] have read in the devotional this week it
[1:27:00] is a word that means to foam up quickly
[1:27:04] when I think of that I think of being a
[1:27:06] kid in in third grade and making a
[1:27:10] volcano did anybody make a volcano you
[1:27:13] might not have made it in third grade
[1:27:14] maybe you were Advanced and you did it
[1:27:16] in kindergarten or something I don't
[1:27:17] know but whenever you did it you pour
[1:27:20] lots of baking soda in and then you put
[1:27:24] that down in the volcano and when it's
[1:27:26] time to make your presentation you pour
[1:27:28] vinegar on it isn't that what we did you
[1:27:30] pour vinegar on it and guess what it
[1:27:32] Foams up quickly this is the same
[1:27:35] reaction it's a chemical reaction that
[1:27:38] causes that and scientifically when we
[1:27:41] look at brain science we find out that
[1:27:43] it's sort of a chemical reaction that
[1:27:45] causes us to react in Anger it Foams up
[1:27:51] quickly he who Foams up quick ly you're
[1:27:54] going to foam up you're going to be
[1:27:57] angry sometime but you don't want to be
[1:28:00] somebody who flies off the handle we say
[1:28:02] in the South you don't want to be
[1:28:04] somebody who Foams up quickly you want
[1:28:07] to be somebody who is in control let me
[1:28:09] tell you this our emotions are not our
[1:28:14] enemy your soul life is not your enemy
[1:28:18] God gave you your emotions so that you
[1:28:22] might be able to make contact with your
[1:28:26] environment you need them you need to be
[1:28:30] you need to have
[1:28:31] emotion uh brother brandom talks about
[1:28:34] religion with no emotion he said it's
[1:28:37] dead he said that's no more than a like
[1:28:41] a rut being in a rut and he said a rut
[1:28:43] is no more than a than a grave with both
[1:28:46] ends kicked out of it he said if it's
[1:28:48] got life if your religion has life it's
[1:28:51] going to have some emotion to it amen
[1:28:55] did you hear that out
[1:28:56] there it's going to have a little Al
[1:28:59] you're not going to come to church like
[1:29:00] you're dead your preacher is not going
[1:29:01] to act dead worship leader it's not
[1:29:04] going to act like a six-foot icicle
[1:29:06] blocking a good picture in the
[1:29:08] baptistry he's going to get under the
[1:29:10] spirit of what he's
[1:29:12] doing that's what brother brandom said
[1:29:15] John I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:29:18] day and that's why he had a vision
[1:29:21] that's why he could write for us through
[1:29:23] a scribe the book of the Revelation
[1:29:25] because he got in the spirit of what he
[1:29:26] was called to do every one of us are
[1:29:28] called To
[1:29:30] Worship in order to worship like God
[1:29:33] intended and that's scriptural that's
[1:29:35] what is worship like God intended is
[1:29:37] scriptural worship you want to know what
[1:29:38] that looks like read the book of
[1:29:40] Psalms The Book of Psalms tells us what
[1:29:43] Godly biblical worship looks like we
[1:29:45] don't get to choose it we don't get to
[1:29:47] say I'm an
[1:29:49] introvert we don't get to say I'm a
[1:29:51] quiet person I don't show any emotion we
[1:29:53] don't don't get to do that we do it
[1:29:55] exactly like the Bible said it or we
[1:29:57] don't do it at
[1:30:00] all you don't have to always be
[1:30:02] loud but the Bible give there's nine
[1:30:05] forms of davidic Praise mentioned in the
[1:30:08] Book of Psalms one of them has to do
[1:30:10] with the posture of the body you C you
[1:30:13] can certainly sit and worship you don't
[1:30:15] have to be standing all the time to
[1:30:17] worship Bible mentions that you can lay
[1:30:19] prostrate on the floor in worship you do
[1:30:21] that in some of our churches they're
[1:30:22] going to have the deacons come
[1:30:24] and and collect you because they're not
[1:30:26] going to know what you're
[1:30:27] doing but we were here just at our
[1:30:30] fellowship meeting and one of the former
[1:30:31] Amish brother laid down in the aisle on
[1:30:34] his belly well he's got biblical order
[1:30:36] for
[1:30:37] that he prostrated himself not prostate
[1:30:42] prostrate it's there's a difference
[1:30:44] believe me he prostrated himself right
[1:30:47] there on the floor in the presence of
[1:30:49] God and Worship the Lord and he has
[1:30:51] every right to do it and any church that
[1:30:55] wouldn't allow somebody to exercise
[1:30:57] biblical praise needs to be
[1:31:02] shook but you don't have to do
[1:31:05] that and then the Bible mentions
[1:31:08] standing tells us tells us we can use
[1:31:12] our voices we can
[1:31:15] sing we can use a loud voice did you
[1:31:18] know the Bible said praise the Lord with
[1:31:19] a loud voice so if you're nervous you
[1:31:22] better get over your nervous Ness
[1:31:24] because heaven is going to be a noisy
[1:31:27] place and if you miss
[1:31:31] it the only other alternative is going
[1:31:34] to be louder than that so you better get
[1:31:36] your nerves under control if you don't
[1:31:39] like shouting you better not get on my
[1:31:41] cloud because when I gave the Lord my
[1:31:44] heart at s years old 50 years ago I gave
[1:31:47] in my heart he filled me with the Holy
[1:31:49] Ghost it's been genuine and real to me
[1:31:52] ever since
[1:31:54] now that doesn't mean the flame hadn't
[1:31:56] flickered but it's never gone out by the
[1:31:58] grace of God the Bible helps us and he
[1:32:01] tells us you can use your hands to clap
[1:32:04] you can use your hands to raise before
[1:32:06] the Lord and you can use your hands to
[1:32:08] play instruments so the Bible tells us
[1:32:12] how we should praise him and when we
[1:32:15] praise him we create an atmosphere for
[1:32:17] the word to go forth and not only be
[1:32:19] preached with power but that it might be
[1:32:22] received with the Effectiveness in our
[1:32:24] individual lives anger means foaming up
[1:32:28] quickly you don't want that you don't
[1:32:30] want to deal foolishly in life because
[1:32:32] you can't be trusted because you're
[1:32:35] quick to fly off the handle you just
[1:32:37] don't want that at all let's catch what
[1:32:39] brother random said in the resurrection
[1:32:41] of Jesus can you take me since I read
[1:32:44] this last Sunday can you go all the way
[1:32:46] down to the place where he said the
[1:32:48] human heart was made to be happy see it
[1:32:53] there in the middle of the screen the
[1:32:54] human heart was made to be happy worry
[1:32:57] will cause cancer temper will cause
[1:33:00] cancer don't oh don't you just wish this
[1:33:04] was easy to do you just want to say yes
[1:33:07] sir and always do it but it's not always
[1:33:09] easy but he said don't ever be
[1:33:14] upset we're failures seems like before
[1:33:16] we get started but we can control that
[1:33:20] you see we're supposed to control our
[1:33:22] emotions instead of our emotions
[1:33:24] controlling us why because we're a
[1:33:26] word-based people we're not living by
[1:33:29] the sway of this world we're living
[1:33:32] under the influence of the revealed word
[1:33:33] of God somebody ought to say amen and
[1:33:37] that makes you behave a little
[1:33:38] differently than the world around you
[1:33:41] behaves amen don't never be upset just
[1:33:44] walk in his love there's a key there
[1:33:46] walk in his love amen if you'll just go
[1:33:51] down he said no KN that you're walking
[1:33:54] in him nothing can harm you there's
[1:33:57] nothing can harm you neither Powers
[1:33:59] things present things future nothing can
[1:34:02] separate us from him we're in him as
[1:34:04] brother Hawk was praying this morning
[1:34:06] and we never come in by our own will he
[1:34:09] by choice elected us and brought us into
[1:34:12] him amen now we know predestination is
[1:34:15] by forn knowledge you did make a choice
[1:34:18] but he knew your choice before the
[1:34:20] foundation of the world and he set you
[1:34:22] up that's what the word word
[1:34:23] predestination means prefixed Destiny
[1:34:27] before you ever come here God knew what
[1:34:29] your choice would be and he placed you
[1:34:31] your name was written in the Lamb's Book
[1:34:33] of Life not the night you got saved but
[1:34:35] before you ever showed up in this world
[1:34:37] is't that
[1:34:38] good now look at James 1 with me just a
[1:34:41] moment here James
[1:34:44] 1:8 uh I think I might have read 19 and
[1:34:47] 20 but let's do 18 through through 21
[1:34:50] now of his own will his will he begat
[1:34:56] us with the word of Truth by his
[1:35:00] choice he birthed
[1:35:02] Us by the word of truth that we should
[1:35:07] be a kind
[1:35:08] of first fruits of his creatures now how
[1:35:13] many of you know Jesus was a first
[1:35:15] fruits first fruits of the Resurrection
[1:35:18] I don't know what you believe but I
[1:35:20] believe brother brandham was a type of a
[1:35:21] first fruit
[1:35:24] because as far as I know in this
[1:35:26] generation or we could say
[1:35:28] dispensation he was the first son that I
[1:35:31] know of to come to
[1:35:34] maturity that's just real simple he won
[1:35:38] the battle he had a lot of
[1:35:41] battles he had a wife that didn't always
[1:35:43] understand the call that was on his
[1:35:45] heart I'll tell you what some folks
[1:35:46] won't tell
[1:35:47] you she had some
[1:35:50] issues she was left alone to raise the
[1:35:55] children and then preach that when she
[1:35:57] got when when he got home you
[1:36:03] remember she let the little kids cut
[1:36:06] their
[1:36:09] bangs that would probably be nothing in
[1:36:11] in the day we're living in now around
[1:36:12] the message ranks but once upon a time
[1:36:16] we we knew what he said keep the
[1:36:18] scissors out of your hair real simple
[1:36:21] just keep them out that means bangs ends
[1:36:24] uh inet whatever just live by a simple
[1:36:28] rule and don't compromise or you'll look
[1:36:30] like some of the Jackson
[1:36:32] Camp yeah right it right they' just inch
[1:36:35] at a time until there's nothing left
[1:36:37] that's not what we've been taught in
[1:36:39] this word or in this m you still
[1:36:42] here I I I didn't know if you'd hung up
[1:36:45] on me or not truth is the truth but you
[1:36:49] know Sister M she let the girls cut
[1:36:51] these little bangs put their scissors
[1:36:53] that you you can't do it without
[1:36:54] scissors so they cut those little bangs
[1:36:57] and made those little flybacks they used
[1:36:59] to like and and I don't know what
[1:37:01] brother brand said to her privately he
[1:37:03] said but I know what he said from the
[1:37:05] pool pit he said I don't like
[1:37:07] that he said I wish you wouldn't do
[1:37:10] wouldn't do
[1:37:12] that she didn't always
[1:37:15] understand I was one time standing in
[1:37:17] the den uh brother George Smith has been
[1:37:21] here he's heard me tell this he was in
[1:37:23] the room
[1:37:24] room and sister Rebecca was still alive
[1:37:27] and we were having a great
[1:37:29] conversation and uh somebody mentioned
[1:37:32] brother Brandon what did he ever get
[1:37:35] upset about things in family and in life
[1:37:39] and she said well yes he he was a normal
[1:37:42] man he he was a he was a normal husband
[1:37:46] does that shock
[1:37:48] you uh he he had the same kind of quirks
[1:37:51] and feelings that anybody else has he
[1:37:54] said so himself he talks about his own
[1:37:58] complexes you're not the only one that's
[1:38:00] got a complex I'm not he had some too
[1:38:03] give me just a moment my lips are
[1:38:05] getting
[1:38:10] sticky so somebody I I don't remember if
[1:38:13] I asked the question or
[1:38:15] not I don't think I did I think someone
[1:38:18] said well what kind of things would
[1:38:19] upset brother Brandon and with my own
[1:38:22] ears I heard it she sister Rebecca said
[1:38:25] well he was pretty particular about his
[1:38:32] toast
[1:38:34] toast yeah
[1:38:37] he come on now he locked it
[1:38:45] a certain
[1:38:48] color would you have wouldn't you left
[1:38:51] to have traveled in time and got brother
[1:38:54] brandom a toaster like we have today and
[1:38:56] sent it
[1:38:57] back all digitalized it's bad when you
[1:39:01] have to say honey come here I can't use
[1:39:02] the
[1:39:04] toaster got screens and all kind of
[1:39:06] little things on it I don't know how to
[1:39:08] set the thing but but maybe brother
[1:39:10] brandom could have could have punched
[1:39:12] the color he wanted on his toast but I
[1:39:15] know this I know yesterday my wife made
[1:39:17] me some eggs two eggs lord it's all we
[1:39:20] could afford to eat I like three but I
[1:39:23] thought I better save
[1:39:25] them uh and and she said well I I looked
[1:39:28] at the plate there was only one egg
[1:39:30] there I didn't say
[1:39:31] anything and she said oh I got another
[1:39:34] one coming she said I I uh uh broke the
[1:39:37] Yol on the first one well I've eaten
[1:39:40] Broken Yolk eggs but I don't like them I
[1:39:43] like over easy eggs or over medium eggs
[1:39:46] and I don't know that I would have
[1:39:47] pitched a tantrum over it but I sure did
[1:39:50] appreciate her knowing that if I had a
[1:39:53] rather I would rather my egg yolk not be
[1:39:56] broken you get it brother Brandon would
[1:39:59] rather his toast not be
[1:40:02] burnt and she said sometimes he'd get a
[1:40:04] little little agitated with Mama because
[1:40:07] the toast was overdone she said that
[1:40:09] wasn't a knock down drag out or anything
[1:40:11] like that uh somebody said well did he
[1:40:13] raise his voice she said well
[1:40:16] uh why do you tell that brother I've
[1:40:19] been told by ministers you shouldn't
[1:40:22] tell that why
[1:40:24] you made him more than a man and when
[1:40:27] you found out he wasn't perfect in
[1:40:31] recall you left
[1:40:33] him but those of us who realize from the
[1:40:36] start that God always uses
[1:40:40] men none of whom are perfect none of
[1:40:43] them who have perfect
[1:40:45] recall when you get that in your goat
[1:40:48] when you really know that by
[1:40:50] understanding then when you come across
[1:40:52] something that was maybe told a little
[1:40:55] different or played out a little
[1:40:57] different it doesn't shake you off
[1:40:59] because you have let him be a man let
[1:41:02] him be human and it's important to do so
[1:41:07] because if not you and I won't think we
[1:41:09] can ever make it but there was a there
[1:41:12] was one in our generation thanks be to
[1:41:15] God who became a first
[1:41:17] fruits and if you understand the concept
[1:41:20] of first fruits the priest would go out
[1:41:22] into the looking for grain that had
[1:41:25] become aib in Hebrew which means ripe
[1:41:29] and and he would find a little patch of
[1:41:31] it and he'd say this is ripe here this
[1:41:34] is a be and he would cut that and tie it
[1:41:38] together and on the on the time of first
[1:41:40] fruits uh just after Passover he would
[1:41:44] wave that out in the field he would wave
[1:41:47] that mature grain before the Lord and he
[1:41:51] would say in the the same manner that
[1:41:54] this grain has become mature May the
[1:41:58] grace of God be upon the field so that
[1:42:01] the rest of the grain will also come to
[1:42:04] its maturity so that in that regard
[1:42:07] brother Brandon was sort of like a first
[1:42:09] fruits in his day a mature son w we saw
[1:42:13] his life we saw his ministry we saw his
[1:42:18] humanity and we have
[1:42:21] hope since we know we don't have a high
[1:42:23] priest who can't be touched we have one
[1:42:25] that can be touched we have hope that
[1:42:29] even as he struggled to get there you
[1:42:31] and I may have a
[1:42:32] journey but the same God that
[1:42:36] perfected his truth in that vessel is
[1:42:40] able to bring every one of us to our
[1:42:43] place of adoption completion and
[1:42:45] maturity that'd be a good place to say
[1:42:47] amen amen so he said of of his own will
[1:42:52] begat he us with the word of truth that
[1:42:54] we should be a kind of first fruits of
[1:42:56] his creatures wherefore my beloved
[1:42:58] Brethren let every man let every man and
[1:43:01] every wo man be swift to
[1:43:05] hear you know I want to just say this
[1:43:08] you know what that means that means you
[1:43:10] can't be thinking of what you're going
[1:43:11] to say when I'm talking to
[1:43:16] you and when you're talking to me I
[1:43:19] can't be thinking about my answer
[1:43:23] this conversation may take longer than
[1:43:25] you think it should because I'm supposed
[1:43:28] to hear
[1:43:29] you before I answer
[1:43:33] you do you know how to know oh this is
[1:43:36] going to get so sticky do you know how
[1:43:38] to know if someone is hearing you or if
[1:43:41] they're just contemplating their
[1:43:44] answer if they're contemplating their
[1:43:47] answer they're always going to lead
[1:43:49] their answer with well I know
[1:43:56] watch and usually after well I know
[1:43:59] there's going to be a big
[1:44:01] old buut excuse
[1:44:05] me in the
[1:44:08] way I hope that's not too carnal for you
[1:44:11] spiritual folks it's going to usually be
[1:44:14] followed by the word
[1:44:16] but well I know
[1:44:18] but well I heard you but no you didn't
[1:44:22] hear you weren't listening you were
[1:44:25] getting your answer ready you can't
[1:44:28] communicate with somebody who won't hear
[1:44:32] you we've got to hear one another we
[1:44:36] have got to be swift to hear
[1:44:40] and slow to
[1:44:43] speak if you'll do that five minutes of
[1:44:46] conversation with each other you'll get
[1:44:48] more said by listening to the other
[1:44:52] party that doesn't mean just just in a
[1:44:53] disagreement it just means in life if
[1:44:56] husbands would take time to listen to
[1:45:00] their wives instead of forming an excuse
[1:45:03] or an answer hear them and then speak
[1:45:07] back and then Vice versy you know what
[1:45:10] that means we wouldn't have the conflict
[1:45:13] that we have in our homes just a minute
[1:45:16] Amen brother
[1:45:18] shell we wouldn't have the conflict we
[1:45:20] have in our friendships and in even our
[1:45:23] church
[1:45:24] relationships we've got to hear each
[1:45:26] other what do you pre I'm just preaching
[1:45:29] the book slow to speak and don't foam up
[1:45:36] quickly don't
[1:45:39] overreact control your
[1:45:42] emotions amen for the wrath of man the
[1:45:46] anger of man the hotess of
[1:45:50] man the agitation of man worketh not the
[1:45:55] righteousness of God now if you think
[1:45:59] you can't make it you can't overcome
[1:46:01] that you can't whip that you're
[1:46:04] forgetting verse 21 look at it with me
[1:46:06] would you wherefore lay
[1:46:09] apart all
[1:46:11] filthiness and superfluity of
[1:46:14] naughtiness boy those are Big King words
[1:46:17] aren't they and superfluity of
[1:46:20] naughtiness and receive here's some you
[1:46:23] might catch with
[1:46:27] meekness the the
[1:46:30] what glance this way just a minute when
[1:46:32] you
[1:46:34] can with
[1:46:36] meekness the
[1:46:39] engrafted
[1:46:41] word which is
[1:46:46] able to save your
[1:46:49] soul your soul according to the Bible is
[1:46:53] your mind your will and your
[1:46:59] emotions did you know that the word of
[1:47:02] God that has been engrafted into your
[1:47:05] life is there to save you in the area of
[1:47:10] your mind your will and your
[1:47:14] emotions so God is asking you to be to
[1:47:19] be swift to hear slow to speak slow to
[1:47:23] boil
[1:47:24] up and when you think I can't do that
[1:47:27] I'm just a human I I got so much stress
[1:47:29] in my life and so much anxiety he comes
[1:47:32] around and says then whereby lay apart
[1:47:35] all filthiness and superfluity of
[1:47:38] naughtiness and receive with
[1:47:41] meekness the word the engrafted word
[1:47:45] which is able to save your mind will and
[1:47:47] emotions your soul now that word
[1:47:50] engrafted in Greek is INF futos and it
[1:47:54] means
[1:47:56] inborn a word inborn in you implanted by
[1:48:02] Nature implanted by others instruction
[1:48:06] boy that brings up an argument Among Us
[1:48:08] in the message doesn't it when did the
[1:48:10] seed get there well it had to be there
[1:48:12] before he could it could manifest that
[1:48:15] we know we believe there was a
[1:48:18] representation of God in you before you
[1:48:21] were born because he knew you before the
[1:48:23] foundation of the world but we also
[1:48:25] believe what brother brandom said when
[1:48:26] he's speaking about the woman at the
[1:48:28] well she received the seed of the word
[1:48:31] as she sat on her mother's knee and
[1:48:33] heard the instructions of truth but the
[1:48:35] reason why that word that her mother
[1:48:37] shared with her had effect in her life
[1:48:40] is because there was already a
[1:48:42] representation of God's forn knowledge
[1:48:44] in her so you've got to have something
[1:48:47] there so that when it falls it falls in
[1:48:50] a right place or you will shed it like
[1:48:53] the world around you you believe what
[1:48:56] you believe today because you came
[1:48:58] here
[1:49:00] wired to receive it but somebody had to
[1:49:04] bring it to you some tape had to get it
[1:49:07] some preacher had to get it to you some
[1:49:10] witness had to get it to
[1:49:12] you
[1:49:13] Hallelujah and you didn't do like the
[1:49:15] little lady who threw the seal book in
[1:49:17] my
[1:49:18] face you received it because there was
[1:49:22] something in you there was a
[1:49:23] representation in you that right there
[1:49:26] just that ought to be enough to make you
[1:49:28] shout your shoes right off your
[1:49:30] feet the very grace of God the very
[1:49:34] mercy of God with tens of thousands of
[1:49:38] people spurning and rejecting truth
[1:49:41] around us God let little oh
[1:49:46] you hear that truth and not just say
[1:49:49] Amen with your tongue but say Amen with
[1:49:52] your
[1:49:54] life I've been looking at that word in
[1:49:57] John 3:16 in the Greek uh whosoever
[1:50:02] believeth I've been looking at that word
[1:50:04] believeth in the original Greek and I've
[1:50:06] been finding out that it means even more
[1:50:09] than
[1:50:11] believe it actually is a an indication
[1:50:16] in Greek of a continual
[1:50:18] process which the modern Church would
[1:50:20] never have you to believe they would
[1:50:23] want you to believe if you believe it
[1:50:25] once that's all you have to do but that
[1:50:27] word doesn't just mean once and for all
[1:50:29] once and done I'm just telling what the
[1:50:31] word means the word actually means and
[1:50:34] continuously choose to
[1:50:38] believe it is good because that's what
[1:50:41] the book said and that's exactly how it
[1:50:44] goes many people can believe up here
[1:50:48] that Jesus died on the cross and go on
[1:50:52] and live like
[1:50:55] hell no matter what they believe but he
[1:50:59] who really believes is somebody who
[1:51:03] chooses to acknowledge it not once and
[1:51:06] then forget it but continues to choose
[1:51:11] to stay attached to that truth how many
[1:51:13] of you are still fighting this good
[1:51:14] fight of Faith as a Christian because
[1:51:16] you didn't just believe it and throw it
[1:51:18] away you
[1:51:20] continue even on a Monday hey
[1:51:24] Hallelujah to believe it to Fellowship
[1:51:27] it now I want to tell you this I hope
[1:51:30] you get this I hope you like it I like
[1:51:32] this and if you don't like it don't tell
[1:51:35] me that word
[1:51:38] engrafted inudo inborn implanted by
[1:51:41] Nature implanted by others instruction
[1:51:44] to implant or
[1:51:49] incorporate
[1:51:50] something in a
[1:51:53] permanent
[1:51:55] way you who have received an engrafted
[1:51:58] word that engrafted word becomes a part
[1:52:01] of
[1:52:02] you engrafted means drawing now you
[1:52:08] drawing life from it it drawing life
[1:52:12] from
[1:52:13] you that's what it
[1:52:15] means and in medicine it means something
[1:52:19] even more
[1:52:21] special in medicine the word engrafted
[1:52:25] refers oh good we we I passed it to
[1:52:29] her in medicine engraftment mean refers
[1:52:33] to the process of new cells working
[1:52:36] properly and rebuilding the immune
[1:52:40] system after a
[1:52:42] transplant when someone has received an
[1:52:46] organ
[1:52:49] transplant that's what this is talking
[1:52:51] about
[1:52:53] there are new cells
[1:52:55] working properly rebuilding the immune
[1:52:59] system in your body so that your body
[1:53:03] will continue to receive the
[1:53:06] organ or else it goes into what
[1:53:09] rejection
[1:53:11] mode and there are many times when an
[1:53:14] organ is initially received later
[1:53:18] rejected by the body and has to be
[1:53:20] removed and that's okay if you've got a
[1:53:23] dozen waiting on you but if you don't
[1:53:25] you can be in some pretty serious
[1:53:26] trouble in fact people have died because
[1:53:29] their body rejected the only choice they
[1:53:31] had for an organ at that time let's go
[1:53:34] on to look at this it is the beginning
[1:53:36] of the recovery
[1:53:38] process white blood cells are the first
[1:53:41] cells to engraft followed by red blood
[1:53:45] cells and platelets now let's look at
[1:53:48] this again just a little more just a
[1:53:49] little deeper here engraftment is when
[1:53:52] the blood forming cells you received on
[1:53:57] transplant
[1:53:59] day so before you receive the organ as
[1:54:03] you are receiving the organ they they
[1:54:06] give you blood forming cells also not
[1:54:11] your
[1:54:14] own sometimes in the form of an
[1:54:17] anti-rejection cocktail they call it
[1:54:21] which is both medicine and and blood
[1:54:25] cells those blood cells that you
[1:54:27] received on transplant day start to
[1:54:30] grow they're not your own cells they
[1:54:33] were given to
[1:54:34] you and they start making healthy blood
[1:54:38] cells isn't that amazing it's an
[1:54:41] important milestone in transplant
[1:54:44] recovery once you get to that place one
[1:54:47] more paragraph about it the cells you
[1:54:50] received on transplant day uh know where
[1:54:55] they
[1:54:56] belong in your body oh my oh
[1:55:03] my oh
[1:55:05] my they move through your blood stream
[1:55:09] into your bone
[1:55:11] marrow and when these cells begin to
[1:55:13] grow and make new blood cells guess what
[1:55:16] is called engraftment now let's go back
[1:55:19] to what Paul said
[1:55:22] James excuse me
[1:55:24] sorry wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[1:55:28] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[1:55:30] with
[1:55:31] meekness the engrafted
[1:55:35] word how many of you have had an organ
[1:55:37] transplant I have
[1:55:40] spiritually he said I the the prophet of
[1:55:43] the Old Testament prophesied I'll take
[1:55:45] your Stony
[1:55:47] heart Hallelujah and I will engraft in
[1:55:52] you you my Living
[1:55:55] Word and my Living Word transplanted
[1:55:59] into your life will bring renewal and
[1:56:02] regeneration to your Fallen human
[1:56:05] spirit and I will not just pass my word
[1:56:08] over you but I will make it a part of
[1:56:12] who you are it's an engrafted word that
[1:56:15] we have receed so brother sister amen we
[1:56:20] can overcome offense
[1:56:23] and anger and bitterness and jealousy
[1:56:27] not because we're superheroes but
[1:56:30] because we have a
[1:56:32] word that has been
[1:56:37] engrafted it has stimulated in us a new
[1:56:40] kind of
[1:56:43] cell it has transformed us from
[1:56:48] needy to sufficient
[1:56:52] this word has what has this word
[1:56:57] has praise His
[1:56:59] name I'm I'm going to
[1:57:04] fly look at Galatians
[1:57:07] 5:23 because that word
[1:57:09] meekness is there receive with meekness
[1:57:14] the engrafted word which is able to save
[1:57:17] your
[1:57:18] souls now you can know what save your
[1:57:20] souls means the the engrafted word has
[1:57:24] the
[1:57:26] ability to
[1:57:28] transform your
[1:57:30] mind I claim it I claim that I stand on
[1:57:36] that
[1:57:38] promise someone recently sent me a note
[1:57:42] of encouragement and said brother Shelly
[1:57:45] thank you for speaking up about mental
[1:57:49] illness because it's a taboo subject in
[1:57:51] the church
[1:57:52] church I don't know what's doing
[1:57:55] that but I want you to know that there
[1:57:58] is a mental
[1:58:00] unwellness in people in this age in this
[1:58:04] hour like we have never seen it before
[1:58:07] and it is not to be ashamed of it is not
[1:58:10] to to hide
[1:58:12] from it is most likely the
[1:58:15] results of hurts and
[1:58:18] wounds and wrong programming
[1:58:23] and past
[1:58:24] issues that weigh so heavy in our lives
[1:58:29] that it produces anxiety it produces
[1:58:32] depression come on panic
[1:58:36] attacks I don't remember what the
[1:58:38] percentage was but it was shockingly
[1:58:41] high I heard a statistic this week on
[1:58:44] the news of how many women of a certain
[1:58:48] age are on medication
[1:58:52] to balance them out not hormonally but
[1:58:55] emotionally and
[1:58:56] mentally because of the high levels of
[1:58:59] anxiety and depression in their
[1:59:04] lives and and I think it was something
[1:59:07] like three and
[1:59:11] five three and
[1:59:13] five depending on now now here's the
[1:59:18] kicker
[1:59:20] longterm if you you need help get
[1:59:24] it but don't look to that prescription
[1:59:27] as your long-term
[1:59:30] solution the long-term solution is to
[1:59:33] step back and let that engrafted
[1:59:37] word begin to produce healthiness and
[1:59:41] wholeness in your body and it can do
[1:59:44] that as you water the word and how do we
[1:59:46] water the word by coming into his
[1:59:48] presence it's not just hearing the
[1:59:50] preaching we have to do it's daily
[1:59:52] entering into the presence of the Lord
[1:59:55] by engaging the word by engaging him in
[1:59:58] praise and worship by visiting what we
[2:00:01] believe two times a week is not enough
[2:00:04] to remain spiritually strong and
[2:00:07] emotionally and mentally
[2:00:11] healthy there are some skinny folks in
[2:00:14] this
[2:00:15] house but I don't believe it's because
[2:00:17] you only eat physical food twice a week
[2:00:24] we have to have daily
[2:00:27] sustenance nutrition for our body and we
[2:00:30] spiritually I know it's an old worn out
[2:00:32] cliche I know people are about tired of
[2:00:34] hearing it but brother brandham just
[2:00:36] simplifies it and says a Christian is
[2:00:39] going to read his Bible every day and
[2:00:44] pray and and I can hear the wheels are
[2:00:47] turning but he didn't have four children
[2:00:50] to take care of and he when he said that
[2:00:52] and he he wasn't a homeschool mom and he
[2:00:54] wasn't a dad who worked 50 hours a week
[2:00:57] let me tell you
[2:00:59] something if you have not yet understood
[2:01:01] the life and death importance of the
[2:01:03] word you will you will eventually
[2:01:06] realize it but you may be too
[2:01:10] frazzled too emotionally disturbed and
[2:01:13] mentally
[2:01:14] ill to do anything about it if you keep
[2:01:18] putting off what we have to have daily
[2:01:24] folks know they don't we know we don't
[2:01:26] get the vitamins and minerals that we
[2:01:29] used to get from our food and yet there
[2:01:32] are some people so spiritually you know
[2:01:35] high on the
[2:01:36] pole that they think it' be just a shame
[2:01:40] to take a multivitamin you know that
[2:01:42] would just be and it's so expensive and
[2:01:45] it's let me tell you something you'll
[2:01:47] have plenty of money to buy yourself a
[2:01:49] multivitamin if you quit buying so many
[2:01:51] potato chip and candy
[2:01:54] bars and $7 coffee
[2:01:57] drinks so please don't tell me that a
[2:02:01] that a multivitamin and a mineral
[2:02:03] supplement is too much and cost too much
[2:02:05] money it's a
[2:02:07] lie get rid of some of your
[2:02:10] subscriptions cut out Netflix and Hulu
[2:02:14] and uh and Apple TV and Disney plus and
[2:02:18] whatever else next thing you know you're
[2:02:22] spending $200 don't mention the cable
[2:02:25] bill that's another 200 bucks just
[2:02:28] about you'll have plenty of money to buy
[2:02:31] better food and eat and take some
[2:02:34] supplementation if you need to and if
[2:02:37] you don't don't pretend to be more
[2:02:39] spiritual than somebody
[2:02:41] else understand it's the same way in the
[2:02:44] spirit we have to keep feeding and
[2:02:47] nourishing
[2:02:57] praise the lord it's
[2:03:00] true receive it with meekness he said
[2:03:02] the engrafted word now we got to
[2:03:05] understand uh here Galatians 523 he's
[2:03:09] talking about uh these beautiful things
[2:03:12] that we need in our life the fruits of
[2:03:14] the spirit
[2:03:15] meekness
[2:03:17] Temperance against such there is no law
[2:03:20] you've got to have meekness to receive
[2:03:22] the engrafted
[2:03:25] word you can't be a knit
[2:03:27] all oh I'm
[2:03:30] preaching you ain't running the aisle
[2:03:32] but I'm still
[2:03:34] preaching you've got to have some some
[2:03:37] humility to receive this engrafted
[2:03:41] word you've got to humble yourself you
[2:03:44] you well I I you know I couldn't listen
[2:03:46] to much of that uh why you know he
[2:03:48] didn't even have a barely a grammar
[2:03:50] school education you don't have to have
[2:03:52] a grammar school education to be
[2:03:56] meek and if you'll be meek God will give
[2:03:59] you the engrafted
[2:04:01] word I guess you see those posts that
[2:04:03] people are making all the time uh if if
[2:04:05] the pastor doesn't have a a a a
[2:04:08] doctorate of theology it's a false
[2:04:11] Church well I want you to know
[2:04:12] somebody's lost their
[2:04:15] mind because that disqualifies just
[2:04:18] about everybody in the book
[2:04:23] Paul was maybe the most intelligent in
[2:04:25] the in the New Testament and he had to
[2:04:27] forget most of what he
[2:04:29] knew to be able to be the greatest
[2:04:31] Apostle the world has ever known I'm not
[2:04:34] against Bible study I'm not against an
[2:04:37] education that's not what I'm preaching
[2:04:40] but if you think your qualification for
[2:04:43] Ministry is in a a a
[2:04:45] frame on your wall then Moses is
[2:04:50] disqualified
[2:04:51] because although he did get the
[2:04:53] education of Egypt he had to go to the
[2:04:55] backs side of the desert to get rid of
[2:04:58] it and Paul remember he had to go down
[2:05:01] and get rid of some of what he learned
[2:05:03] so that God and that's the meekness that
[2:05:05] it requires it's the humility that it
[2:05:08] required you've got to be willing to to
[2:05:10] to say hey I may know something up here
[2:05:13] in my head that doesn't make it
[2:05:16] so we're living in an hour now where we
[2:05:19] know just because somebody knows it
[2:05:23] doesn't mean it's
[2:05:26] true there is an engrafted word that can
[2:05:29] only be received with meekness not
[2:05:34] Hess I'm going to catch him I can't wait
[2:05:37] to catch him in a mistake I'm I I I just
[2:05:41] can't wait to catch him in
[2:05:43] in that's not
[2:05:46] meekness that's
[2:05:50] pompus party
[2:05:53] God will do for you what he did for old
[2:05:55] Saul of Tarsus he'll meet you on the
[2:05:58] road to
[2:05:59] Damascus and knock you off
[2:06:03] your high
[2:06:05] horse he knows how to get our attention
[2:06:09] and when he does we don't need to meet
[2:06:11] him with some lofty words or superfluity
[2:06:14] of
[2:06:15] naughtiness we need to receive with
[2:06:17] meekness the engrafted word somebody
[2:06:19] ought to thank God for the truth
[2:06:22] and it takes that meekness and let me
[2:06:24] just run down this real quick let's look
[2:06:26] at what meekness means because some
[2:06:28] people do not know what it means some
[2:06:30] people think me meekness is
[2:06:34] weakness some people think meekness is
[2:06:41] and indeed it is not in the
[2:06:44] original
[2:06:47] language it means
[2:06:49] gentleness mildness by implication
[2:06:53] humility having a mild submissive Spirit
[2:06:57] somebody said that must be talking to
[2:06:59] women no it's talking to all of God's
[2:07:04] children we all have to be submissive to
[2:07:06] the
[2:07:07] word we
[2:07:09] do we have to have some help with our
[2:07:12] will remember this engrafted word is
[2:07:15] able to save your soul your soul is made
[2:07:18] up of mind will and emotion we've got to
[2:07:22] be willing to Bow our
[2:07:25] will and receive his will his mind his
[2:07:30] leadership those of you that have gone
[2:07:32] ahead in the assignment you know already
[2:07:35] that it means avoids
[2:07:37] unnecessary harshness I was doing really
[2:07:41] well until I got to that
[2:07:47] phrase and my transparency for the day
[2:07:50] is this I have a problem with
[2:07:54] unnecessary
[2:07:58] harshness sometimes I use
[2:08:02] it as
[2:08:05] humor as
[2:08:09] sarcasm but it doesn't always have the
[2:08:12] right
[2:08:13] effect if I want to be meek before the
[2:08:17] Lord and before his people I've Got to
[2:08:20] Now not not in you know not necessarily
[2:08:23] in preaching because if you don't have
[2:08:24] boldness and a little bit of authority
[2:08:26] in the preaching in this hour you'll
[2:08:28] never catch anybody's attention because
[2:08:30] they're they're already W that you're
[2:08:32] sitting there I see you sometime you
[2:08:33] don't even have your phone in your hand
[2:08:34] and your thumb's
[2:08:37] working you honestly think that you can
[2:08:40] get me to move on by by thumbing
[2:08:46] me I'm not moving on till I'm done
[2:08:53] amen I'm not under contract
[2:08:56] here I'm under a responsibility but I'm
[2:09:00] not talking about pit
[2:09:03] mannerism I'm talking about an everyday
[2:09:06] life I'm talking about with my own
[2:09:09] family I'm talking about just an
[2:09:12] agitation
[2:09:14] ill
[2:09:17] irritation some people get on my nerves
[2:09:20] with their question s you don't have to
[2:09:23] raise your hand in the room if you know
[2:09:25] it's
[2:09:27] you and a and I want the Lord to help
[2:09:31] me and I want to have strength to help
[2:09:35] myself because the reality is most of
[2:09:38] the time if I if I can catch myself I'm
[2:09:42] not angry I I'm not really trying to
[2:09:45] drive home a point I have just somehow
[2:09:49] adopted This Heart harness I'm not the
[2:09:52] only one I I but I am not uh talking
[2:09:56] about anybody but me right
[2:09:58] now and that's not
[2:10:01] Meek a a and if that can hinder me from
[2:10:05] receiving the full engrafted word I want
[2:10:07] to ask the Lord and I want your prayer I
[2:10:11] want to be uh open and transparent
[2:10:13] before you I don't want to be harsh if I
[2:10:15] don't need to be sometime you have to be
[2:10:18] sometime you have to say no
[2:10:22] and you have to mean
[2:10:24] it but if I don't have to
[2:10:28] be I I would rather be another way I
[2:10:33] don't know if you're quiet because you
[2:10:34] feel sorry for me quiet because you've
[2:10:37] been victim of
[2:10:39] me or or quiet because you can't believe
[2:10:42] I'm saying but I need to say that
[2:10:45] because I know that sometimes we need
[2:10:48] just realness so that we can deal with
[2:10:51] our own
[2:10:52] stuff well well you're preaching to
[2:10:55] yourself how does that feel well it's
[2:10:57] not
[2:10:58] fun but it's part of the the calling
[2:11:02] it's also my
[2:11:03] responsibility to let this word work in
[2:11:07] me amen pray for me and I'm going to
[2:11:11] pray for you that we would now now
[2:11:14] listen it says
[2:11:15] avoids unnecessary harshness and I know
[2:11:18] by saying that that I will be reminded a
[2:11:20] dozen times this
[2:11:23] week by people who may not remember what
[2:11:26] else I

[2:11:34] Benjamin will now remember that one
[2:11:37] little
[2:11:39] phrase and call me out but it's part of
[2:11:42] what we need now here is this I didn't
[2:11:45] make this up I didn't add this this is
[2:11:47] part of the full definition of the word
[2:11:49] does not mean will
[2:11:52] weak weekness doesn't mean
[2:11:56] weakness but rather
[2:11:59] strength under
[2:12:02] control somebody say help us

[2:12:28] a wonderful time yesterday I spent all
[2:12:31] day long in this
[2:12:36] word and I broke this down but it
[2:12:39] wouldn't we wouldn't have the time to
[2:12:40] hit it this morning but I love I love
[2:12:43] the meaning of that overtaken in a fall
[2:12:45] it it it's uh it's it's a word that can
[2:12:48] mean uh surprise it's a word that can
[2:12:52] mean caught up
[2:12:55] to if a man has been caught up
[2:12:59] to by a fa that has been chasing
[2:13:04] him instead of saying I Told You

[2:13:44] humbleness of Mind meekness and
[2:13:46] longsuffering that doesn't sound like
[2:13:48] somebody foaming up with anger all the
[2:13:49] time hello
[2:13:51] spitting and sputtering flying off the
[2:13:54] handle quick
[2:13:56] reaction I need some more
[2:14:00] omes thank you sister Flo James 1:22 and
[2:14:03] 23 this is the next two verses I wanted
[2:14:06] you to see the the continuity and
[2:14:08] context of the
[2:14:09] scripture the verse before this says
[2:14:12] with meekness receive the engrafted word
[2:14:14] which is able to save your soul now the
[2:14:16] next verse says but be ye isn't it
[2:14:18] interesting but be ye doers

[2:16:58] word that God is sending to try to get

[2:17:14] word and not hears only for let me see
[2:17:16] what time it is yes for if any be a
[2:17:18] hearer of the word and not a doer he's
[2:17:20] like into a man beholding his natural
[2:17:23] face in a glass he goes off and forgets
[2:17:26] what he
[2:17:28] sees here's how the spirit of anger
[2:17:30] Works anger fuels offense leading to
[2:17:35] rash decisions and spiritual blindness
[2:17:38] well I just ain't going back to
[2:17:42] church that's a big decision for a for a
[2:17:45] for a flash of
[2:17:48] moment you're going to make some d I'm
[2:17:51] just going to quit my job because nobody
[2:17:52] there appreciates me that's a bad
[2:17:55] decision until you think it
[2:17:58] through CU somebody's got to pay your
[2:18:01] bill and it ain't GNA be
[2:18:06] me and all of us don't have Rich daddies
[2:18:09] and
[2:18:11] mamas you better know but the atmosphere
[2:18:15] is just so bad uh let me tell you
[2:18:18] something very few people
[2:18:21] work in in in a church
[2:18:24] atmosphere unless they work for a
[2:18:28] church just because it's bad there don't
[2:18:30] mean it ain't going to be bad somewhere
[2:18:33] else and well the language is just so
[2:18:36] bad folks people are foulmouthed and
[2:18:39] filthy mouthed in this
[2:18:45] generation when my family was was
[2:18:47] smaller and my girls were younger and
[2:18:50] we're sitting in a restaurant and and
[2:18:52] people would start using foul language
[2:18:54] many times I have turned around and said
[2:18:58] hey this is my
[2:19:01] wife these are my
[2:19:03] daughters can you use nicer language or
[2:19:07] say your language a little little
[2:19:10] softer because they've never heard those
[2:19:13] words I don't say them in front of
[2:19:16] them and they don't know those words
[2:19:18] I've told you some of the experiences
[2:19:21] one time we were down the
[2:19:23] beach and uh we
[2:19:28] were sitting right by the water I found
[2:19:31] if you just get right down at the
[2:19:34] water you don't have to see his M but
[2:19:37] the
[2:19:38] water we don't go when it's crowded but
[2:19:41] this was the time that we I had to be
[2:19:44] there and we were down by the water and
[2:19:46] there was a big group of one of the
[2:19:49] colleges had a break and there was a big
[2:19:51] group of them behind us and they were
[2:19:53] just carrying on like
[2:19:56] foolishness and I just walked back and
[2:19:58] of course my wife she's just about to
[2:19:59] die and my girl my family they're just
[2:20:02] about to dig holes in the sand and hide
[2:20:05] and I understand now they just hated to
[2:20:08] see me shot right on the
[2:20:10] beach but back then I did it didn't
[2:20:13] matter and I just walked up and I said
[2:20:15] you know what you all are here to have a
[2:20:18] good time nice time I'm here to have
[2:20:20] nice time you think there's any
[2:20:22] possibility you could clean up your your
[2:20:24] language just a little bit I don't want
[2:20:27] to have to explain to my children what
[2:20:29] some of those words mean they're not old
[2:20:32] enough to hear
[2:20:33] them and you know
[2:20:35] what every one of them said yes sir yes
[2:20:38] sir yes sir I'm so sorry yes sir I'm so
[2:20:40] I'm so sorry they respected that I went
[2:20:43] back and sat down and of course my
[2:20:44] family's M I can't believe you did that
[2:20:46] I can't believe you did that you EMB us
[2:20:48] a
[2:20:49] birad a little while later here come one
[2:20:51] of them with his
[2:20:54] chair I didn't go up there to make a
[2:20:58] friend he come down with his chair put
[2:21:01] his chair right beside me and said you
[2:21:02] mind if I sit with
[2:21:04] you I said well go right ahead he said
[2:21:07] you see my daddy's a Church of God
[2:21:10] preacher and he would be ashamed of me
[2:21:14] if he heard me using the kind of
[2:21:15] language I was using right up there he
[2:21:18] said to come down here I traded out my
[2:21:20] my my uh beer for a Diet
[2:21:25] Coke because he'd be ashamed of me to
[2:21:28] know and then a little while later we
[2:21:30] just sit quietly then he starts pouring
[2:21:32] his life
[2:21:35] out caught up in a wrong
[2:21:38] swirl needed somebody to remind him who
[2:21:41] he
[2:21:42] was that's that's the reality of a lot
[2:21:45] of folks around us if we're acting like
[2:21:48] them and talking like them and doing
[2:21:50] what they do we're going to make them
[2:21:53] comfortable my Ministry is not to make
[2:21:56] them comfortable it's to make them
[2:21:59] miserable and then offer them a way
[2:22:02] out isn't that right here's how that
[2:22:05] Spirit of anger works it fuels offense
[2:22:08] leading to rash decisions and spiritual
[2:22:10] blindness offense often arises when
[2:22:13] individuals hold on to anger instead of
[2:22:16] choosing forgiveness and
[2:22:18] discretion anger is often a response to
[2:22:23] unresolved offense it can lead to wrath
[2:22:27] and Malice hindering
[2:22:29] [Music]
[2:22:31] peace and Reconciliation are you with me
[2:22:35] Proverbs 16:32 few more minutes he that
[2:22:37] is slow to anger is better than the
[2:22:40] mighty and he that ruleth his
[2:22:43] Spirit than he that taketh the city you
[2:22:46] want to be a hero you want you want to
[2:22:48] be a a a some
[2:22:51] body rule your own
[2:22:55] Spirit control your
[2:22:58] anger and the reason why we don't want
[2:23:00] to maintain an offended heart is because
[2:23:03] an offended heart is the breeding ground
[2:23:06] of
[2:23:08] deception Proverbs 19:11 in the
[2:23:10] Amplified says good sense makes a man
[2:23:14] restrain his anger and it is his glory
[2:23:18] to overlook a transgression or offense
[2:23:21] we need less
[2:23:25] temper and more
[2:23:28] Temperance Galatians 5:22-23 but the
[2:23:31] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[2:23:35] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[2:23:39] meekness Temperance against such there
[2:23:42] is no law did I get him out of order
[2:23:44] charity I may have the word
[2:23:47] Temperance in the Greek means self self
[2:23:52] control how many of you want to
[2:23:55] be exercising
[2:23:59] self-control you put your fist through
[2:24:02] the
[2:24:07] wall you slammed a door and the glass
[2:24:13] broke you raised your arm and your
[2:24:16] family flinched
[2:24:21] that's not
[2:24:22] Temperance that's uncontrolled
[2:24:26] temper you yelled at the little wife
[2:24:29] that you claim to
[2:24:31] love you snatch your children by the
[2:24:37] elbow you mistreat the dog because
[2:24:40] you're
[2:24:42] angry that's not
[2:24:44] Temperance that's
[2:24:48] temper you threw a chair across the
[2:24:51] kitchen my goodness you need
[2:24:54] jail you need
[2:24:57] bars you need an overnight locked
[2:25:03] away that's not
[2:25:06] Temperance that's
[2:25:08] temper Temperance is self-control the
[2:25:11] virtue of one who Masters his desires
[2:25:16] and passions if you can't control your
[2:25:19] desires and Passions you will surely
[2:25:21] find a
[2:25:23] road yielding to lust and when lust has
[2:25:28] finished it brings forth unbelief and
[2:25:31] sin and adultery and
[2:25:38] fornication Temperance it's a fruit of
[2:25:41] the
[2:25:44] spirit Restraint of one's emotions
[2:25:47] impulses or desires
[2:25:51] Temperance God help
[2:25:55] us look at second Peter uh chapter 1
[2:25:59] verse 5-8 you'll be familiar with this
[2:26:01] and beside this giving all diligence add
[2:26:04] to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[2:26:07] knowledge remember this is not a head
[2:26:10] knowledge this is a knowing this is a
[2:26:15] knowing and Mary knew no man Mary
[2:26:18] conceived of a baby knowing no man
[2:26:21] that wasn't head knowledge that was
[2:26:23] intimate knowledge that's the kind of
[2:26:24] knowledge we're talking about here an
[2:26:26] intimate
[2:26:27] knowledge have you been intimate with
[2:26:29] the
[2:26:30] word have you opened up your life good
[2:26:34] question and allowed the word of God to
[2:26:39] overshadow your life are you willing to
[2:26:42] change your
[2:26:44] opinions your
[2:26:46] decisions because the word says
[2:26:48] something different that's
[2:26:51] knowledge add to your knowledge
[2:26:54] Temperance
[2:26:56] self-control and to
[2:26:58] Temperance
[2:27:00] patience not quick to boil to foam and
[2:27:04] to
[2:27:05] patience godliness brother brandom said
[2:27:08] that is to be just like God somebody
[2:27:11] said that's impossible it can't be
[2:27:14] impossible if the word encourages it it
[2:27:18] may not be easy
[2:27:21] but nothing worth having is cheaper free
[2:27:25] we got to work to get to that place
[2:27:28] somebody said I thought it wasn't by
[2:27:29] works no it's by faith and faith is
[2:27:34] demonstrated by works are you still here
[2:27:37] good I need 20 more minutes or so when
[2:27:40] or so that's a that's that's a variable
[2:27:42] or
[2:27:43] so a a and and to patience
[2:27:47] godliness and to
[2:27:49] Godliness brother of kindness you know
[2:27:51] what I'm going to say don't you cuz I've
[2:27:52] said it so many times in these 30 plus
[2:27:55] years that I've preached to some of
[2:27:59] you when I first heard brother brandom
[2:28:02] preaching the stature of a perfect
[2:28:05] man because I had read this scripture in
[2:28:08] Peter many many many many many many
[2:28:10] times and it never hit me like this
[2:28:12] until I heard brother brandom sit
[2:28:13] preaching it in the statute of the
[2:28:14] perfect man that to be Godly is to be
[2:28:16] just like God and then the scripture
[2:28:18] says and to Godliness
[2:28:21] you've got to add something to your
[2:28:23] godliness you are living a life that
[2:28:26] manifests
[2:28:28] God and you still got to add something
[2:28:30] to that wouldn't you have thought that
[2:28:33] would have been the top of the top of
[2:28:34] the top
[2:28:35] godliness and yet the scripture said and
[2:28:38] to Godliness you got to add something
[2:28:41] what brotherly kindness is higher on the
[2:28:44] stature of a perfect man we we uh he
[2:28:48] placed it on the pyramid so that you can
[2:28:50] see it uh getting higher and
[2:28:54] honing more narrow at the top so once
[2:28:58] you have seen that birthing into
[2:29:02] godliness where you're behaving like God
[2:29:06] somebody said that's just far-fetched
[2:29:08] and out out out of possibility oh no no
[2:29:11] no no no no no no no you have received
[2:29:14] the engrafted word the engrafted word is
[2:29:17] working on you your body is preparing
[2:29:21] itself to receive that word that God has
[2:29:25] attached to
[2:29:26] you and if we yield to the word instead
[2:29:29] of our emotion if we yield to the word
[2:29:32] instead of our
[2:29:34] past if we yield to the word instead of
[2:29:37] our
[2:29:39] excuses well I've always handled it like
[2:29:41] that before that was
[2:29:44] then I told you about the song that
[2:29:46] brother lenel wrote and sent to me this
[2:29:48] week
[2:29:50] where he talks about uh loving people
[2:29:54] and telling your children you love them
[2:29:55] and how how uh how hard is it to stoop
[2:30:00] over and love your children and love
[2:30:02] people around you and tell them you love
[2:30:04] them because you don't know how much
[2:30:05] longer you're going to have
[2:30:07] them and that line in the chorus that he
[2:30:09] wrote talks about uh and don't just tell
[2:30:13] me I was raised that
[2:30:15] way because that was then
[2:30:22] this is
[2:30:23] now you know what that means church are
[2:30:25] you looking this way are you hearing me
[2:30:29] you know what that means it means we got
[2:30:31] to quit making those kinds of excuses
[2:30:33] well my mama didn't never tell me she
[2:30:35] let my dad didn't hug me my
[2:30:38] my that's ever more the reason that is
[2:30:41] ever more the reason why you and I need
[2:30:43] to go higher than our
[2:30:46] parents what about my kids don't like it
[2:30:49] tough
[2:30:53] well my kids are grown tough love them
[2:30:59] anyway well I don't want to embarrass
[2:31:01] them oh wait till they come in the house
[2:31:03] then bear hug
[2:31:05] them let them know Well they're going to
[2:31:08] think I've lost my mind
[2:31:10] good reality they already think that now
[2:31:13] they're going to have
[2:31:15] proof love
[2:31:17] them you that have little babies coming
[2:31:20] or you that are carrying little baby

[2:31:24] now do what I did and talk to mama's
[2:31:28] belly you are wanted you are loved you
[2:31:31] are going to manifest the promises of
[2:31:34] God for your
[2:31:36] life this is your daddy talking get used
[2:31:39] to my voice you're going to hear it
[2:31:42] every day for the first 30
[2:31:47] years I wish
[2:31:51] do you think that has any effect on a
[2:31:53] baby in the womb
[2:31:56] absolutely read the scripture over
[2:31:59] them and don't quit don't get shy when
[2:32:02] they're
[2:32:03] grown Speak
[2:32:06] Life give them a father's
[2:32:09] blessing a mother is the Fifth Gospel
[2:32:12] but it does not replace the blessing of
[2:32:16] a father a father speaking to his
[2:32:19] children blessing his children speaking
[2:32:22] life into his children and the reason
[2:32:25] why we won't do it is because we're not
[2:32:27] walking in meekness and Temperance we're
[2:32:30] walking in offense and anger and we
[2:32:32] don't want to be called out by our own
[2:32:33] family as Hypocrites sometime so we
[2:32:36] neglect what we ought to do because we
[2:32:38] can't
[2:32:42] control what we do you almost seem like
[2:32:46] you're mad not at all I'm just a
[2:32:47] passionate fell
[2:32:51] I've told some of these former Amish who
[2:32:52] come and worship with us every other
[2:32:54] month and I speak to them uh other times
[2:32:57] on the phone and and they Dro by at
[2:33:00] different time and and some of them have
[2:33:02] said to me you know we didn't grow up in
[2:33:04] that kind of environment and I said
[2:33:06] build a new environment make a new
[2:33:09] atmosphere it's not part of our culture
[2:33:11] not part of our
[2:33:15] nature that was then this is now
[2:33:20] it's it's it's well anyway we shouldn't
[2:33:23] even have to talk like this to Godliness
[2:33:26] brotherly kindness how is it possible
[2:33:28] you're just like God and still you need
[2:33:30] something more right because you can
[2:33:32] have all of God and the characteristics
[2:33:35] of God in your heart and still not come
[2:33:39] to a place where you treat your brother
[2:33:42] right so he's saying as you come into
[2:33:45] the fullness of being like God don't
[2:33:47] forget
[2:33:50] that he's here or
[2:33:52] there your brother's right in front of
[2:33:55] you how can you say you love a God that
[2:33:57] you can't see when you don't know how to
[2:34:00] treat your
[2:34:03] brother that you do
[2:34:06] see am I still your preacher am I
[2:34:11] fired godliness brotherly kindness and
[2:34:13] brotherly kindness charity which is
[2:34:17] love King James uses the word charity
[2:34:20] here and it throws people off sometime
[2:34:23] because they think that means taking a
[2:34:25] you know a box of oranges to the
[2:34:29] neighbor or giving to the
[2:34:31] Goodwill no no no no no no no this is
[2:34:35] love this is perfect love this is Godly
[2:34:39] love this is necessary
[2:34:42] love now let's look at a few places in
[2:34:45] the message and we'll be done I still
[2:34:47] have 30 minutes but I won't take a all
[2:34:50] if you help me with what time we have
[2:34:52] left verse foundationally paragraph 65
[2:34:56] Blasphemous names first foundationally
[2:34:59] is Faith second add to your faith virtue
[2:35:01] to your virtue Knowledge from knowledge
[2:35:03] Temperance from Temperance patience
[2:35:05] patience godliness and from
[2:35:08] godliness Brotherly Love brotherly
[2:35:12] kindness and then love being the
[2:35:15] Capstone seven of those seven Church
[2:35:17] agenes Seven Stars of the church es and
[2:35:20] all of it tempered together by the Holy
[2:35:22] Spirit there's the key that is the key
[2:35:24] folks we don't have enough of the Holy
[2:35:29] Ghost what am I supposed to do about
[2:35:31] that keep coming for a refill Lord fill
[2:35:34] me fill me that today fill

[2:35:48] every cell in my
[2:35:51] body we need
[2:35:53] him tempered together by the Holy Spirit
[2:35:56] now that's what it takes to become a
[2:35:58] servant of
[2:35:59] Christ Christ builds his church in seven
[2:36:02] Church ages his bride a person woman
[2:36:04] Church seven Church ages constitute and
[2:36:06] make the bride some out of this age some
[2:36:09] out of that age some out and all
[2:36:11] together shaping like a pyramid let's go
[2:36:15] on shaping like a pyramid the next 220
[2:36:18] stature of a perfect man and Temperance
[2:36:21] Oh my he said we've come to Temperance
[2:36:24] now you've had Faith first you have to
[2:36:27] have that to begin with then you add
[2:36:29] virtue to your faith if it's the right
[2:36:31] kind of
[2:36:32] virtue which is not just
[2:36:34] power it's also
[2:36:37] character The Virtuous Woman didn't mean
[2:36:39] a powerful woman necessarily she will be
[2:36:42] she will be a powerful woman if those
[2:36:44] virtues that are mentioned are
[2:36:46] demonstrated in her life but that virtue
[2:36:49] is not just strength and power that
[2:36:51] virtue is also character add character
[2:36:53] to your faith if it's the right kind of
[2:36:56] virtue then you add knowledge and if
[2:36:57] it's the right kind of knowledge now
[2:37:00] you're going to add what Temperance stay
[2:37:03] with me just another
[2:37:05] moment hold your thumb still you can't
[2:37:08] scroll the preacher Temperance doesn't
[2:37:11] mean stop drinking alcohol you know the
[2:37:13] temperance movement well where did they
[2:37:16] get that word self-control
[2:37:22] there's not a person in this room that
[2:37:25] wouldn't
[2:37:26] enjoy a couple of hours of not
[2:37:30] caring about
[2:37:35] anything it is the truth but I'm not
[2:37:38] just going to get
[2:37:43] drunk I I'm going to exercise
[2:37:47] self-control there's got to be another
[2:37:52] way I know the way it's coming into the
[2:37:54] presence of the Lord It's believing what
[2:37:57] the word said it's it but you got to
[2:37:59] keep it doing it it's a it's a constant
[2:38:01] Choice amen he said temperates doesn't
[2:38:04] mean stop drinking alcohol here no no
[2:38:06] Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure
[2:38:08] not in this case this is Bible
[2:38:10] Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's
[2:38:13] just one of the lust of the flesh but
[2:38:15] we're talking about Holy Spirit
[2:38:17] Temperance that means how oh oh you want
[2:38:20] to know how brother brandom defined it
[2:38:23] somebody read it I I just can't read
[2:38:30] it how to control your tongue not be a
[2:38:37] Tattler you're like a rattler if you're
[2:38:39] a
[2:38:40] tadler got Venom how to control your
[2:38:45] temper not fly off every time anybody

[2:39:08] Holy Ghost the world around us has fuses
[2:39:10] about that long you might ought to be
[2:39:14] careful not just women that'll not just
[2:39:17] men that'll talk to you like a saor
[2:39:19] there's women out
[2:39:23] there it's getting worse all the time
[2:39:26] not just fly boy a lot of us going to
[2:39:27] fall off before we get started aren't we
[2:39:29] talk about going
[2:39:31] up no no
[2:39:33] no aren't we see then we wonder why God
[2:39:36] is not in the church not in his church
[2:39:39] doing Miracles and things that used to
[2:39:44] do and these and add Temperance to it oh
[2:39:48] temperance how to answer in
[2:39:52] kindness when wrath is spoken to you how
[2:39:54] to hold on to your mind instead of

[2:39:59] time said you bunch of Holy Rollers down
[2:40:01] there don't jump out and roll up your
[2:40:03] sleeves now but talk with Godly love

[2:40:12] just going to show him who
[2:40:14] boss yeah that don't sound like the Holy
[2:40:17] Ghost talking in you
[2:40:19] is that the way you want to be he said
[2:40:22] when you're rifled upon R rled upon rile
[2:40:26] not bad let him be your example when
[2:40:30] they said if thou be the Son of God turn
[2:40:32] these stones into bread he could have
[2:40:34] done it and showed he was God but he had
[2:40:36] Temperance self-control when they called
[2:40:39] him be he said I'll forgive you that
[2:40:41] right they pull handfuls of his beard
[2:40:43] out of his face and spit in his oh he
[2:40:46] must had a beard
[2:40:53] interesting we get so condemned sometime
[2:40:55] for having one they pulled handfuls out
[2:40:58] of his fa and spit in his face and said
[2:41:00] come down off the cross he said father
[2:41:03] forgive them they don't even know what
[2:41:06] they're doing I'm just reading you right
[2:41:09] from the prophet's
[2:41:11] message paragraph 227 few
[2:41:14] more now if you got it like that add it
[2:41:17] to your faith if you still blow up and
[2:41:19] Sass and fuss and stew and carry
[2:41:23] on
[2:41:25] uhhuh you ain't got
[2:41:28] no I'm glad he didn't finish it because
[2:41:31] we all know what he's talking about you
[2:41:33] ain't got
[2:41:34] no you can't add that because it won't
[2:41:38] add see it won't vulcanize now he's on
[2:41:42] to steal you couldn't take a piece of
[2:41:44] rubber you know and vulcanize it to a
[2:41:46] piece of
[2:41:47] iron you just just won't
[2:41:50] work no it's got to be flexible just
[2:41:52] like the rubber is see and when your
[2:41:54] faith and your Temperance becomes the
[2:41:56] same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that
[2:41:59] he had then it will vulcanize with him
[2:42:02] it will come into Union with him you're
[2:42:05] added to it when your virtue is like his
[2:42:08] virtue then it'll add to it isn't that
[2:42:12] simple when your knowledge is like his
[2:42:15] knowledge I come to do thy will oh god
[2:42:17] with the father's word he defeated every
[2:42:19] devil Heaven and Earth will pass away
[2:42:21] but the word will not see when you got
[2:42:23] that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize
[2:42:25] with your faith you won't struggle to
[2:42:27] add
[2:42:28] it when you got the right kind of
[2:42:30] temperance like he had it'll vulcanize
[2:42:32] if you having just a man-made halfway s
[2:42:35] up belief or Temperance oh I ought to
[2:42:38] slap him
[2:42:40] down but maybe I better
[2:42:43] not because they might put my name in
[2:42:45] the paper about it
[2:42:50] that ain't the kind of temperance he's
[2:42:51] talking about don't try to add that it
[2:42:53] won't work but when you can really with
[2:42:55] the sweetness from your heart forgive
[2:42:57] every
[2:42:58] man hold your peace let it be gone then
[2:43:02] it'll vulcanize you can add that to your
[2:43:06] faith phw you still here you believe he
[2:43:09] was on the track there I do too what
[2:43:13] what paragraph Was that we stopped off
[2:43:16] with oh we not done yet
[2:43:20] 3:51 and now we've put the blood of
[2:43:22] Jesus Christ in see and that brings the
[2:43:25] faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of
[2:43:27] Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus
[2:43:29] Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ
[2:43:32] the patience of Jesus Christ the
[2:43:33] godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly
[2:43:36] kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of
[2:43:40] God which is Jesus Christ he's the head
[2:43:44] and controls you and your feet is the
[2:43:46] foundation Faith amen controlled by the
[2:43:48] head you are there is the perfect man of
[2:43:51] God when he possesses these virtues
[2:43:54] remember what he went on to say if these
[2:43:55] be in you and abound you won't be
[2:43:59] unfruitful you will not
[2:44:02] be paragraph 312 we're going to go back
[2:44:05] just a minute in the sermon then
[2:44:08] sixthly the Bible said here adding
[2:44:10] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now
[2:44:13] that word in the Greek is fraternal
[2:44:16] affection fraternal that's where they
[2:44:18] get the word Fraternity in
[2:44:20] college now today when we think about a
[2:44:23] fraternity we're not thinking about
[2:44:25] smart Godly young
[2:44:30] men always doing the right thing we
[2:44:33] thinking about a bunch of nutcases Gone
[2:44:36] Wild whipping each other with wet towels
[2:44:40] and drinking theel
[2:44:43] silly going to school on Monday with a
[2:44:47] headache and black eyes and but but
[2:44:51] that's not what it means scripturally a
[2:44:53] fraternity is a Brotherhood that can't
[2:44:56] be broken no matter what comes our way
[2:44:59] we are fighting for one another in the
[2:45:01] trenches of life we are uh a team we are
[2:45:07] vulcanized together to use brother
[2:45:09] brandom's expression there we're not
[2:45:11] leaving anybody
[2:45:13] behind we're bringing them all with
[2:45:17] us we we pledge to one another
[2:45:21] faithfulness in this fraternal affection
[2:45:23] brotherly
[2:45:25] kindness when we get to that brotherly
[2:45:28] kindness put yourself in his place on
[2:45:31] the matter that will help you that helps
[2:45:34] me I have to remind myself what would I
[2:45:37] do what if I were in that position what
[2:45:40] if I was going through that
[2:45:42] myself what if I'd been through
[2:45:45] that no wonder the Bible tells us and
[2:45:48] when you men Golden Rule people laugh at
[2:45:50] you Christian people even sometime laugh
[2:45:53] at you when you mention to them that the
[2:45:55] Golden Rule do unto others as you would
[2:45:57] have them not as they would treat
[2:46:00] you your kids go to the oh ungodly
[2:46:04] Egyptian public schools out
[2:46:07] there and then they come home and
[2:46:09] they've got this
[2:46:12] mentality well he did it to me
[2:46:14] first he said it to me first he treated
[2:46:18] me that way first first that that's not
[2:46:20] what it says it didn't say how you're
[2:46:22] treated is how you respond it said do
[2:46:24] unto others as you would like to be
[2:46:31] treated he were mean to me I guess he
[2:46:35] was you went after him like a
[2:46:39] barracuda 3:13 my brother sinned against
[2:46:42] me said Peter shall I forgive him Jesus
[2:46:46] said oh yes you're going to have to
[2:46:49] forgive
[2:46:51] him seven times a
[2:46:54] day Lord you know I can't forgive
[2:46:56] somebody seven times in one day that's a
[2:47:00] good thing because that's not the
[2:47:02] requirement it's 70
[2:47:05] times
[2:47:08] seven if I didn't want you to stay off
[2:47:10] your phone while I'm preaching I'd tell
[2:47:11] you to pull out that big smartphone of
[2:47:13] yours and let you figure up because I
[2:47:15] know most of you couldn't probably do it
[2:47:17] in your head anymore
[2:47:20] thank you
[2:47:23] Nathan
[2:47:25] 490 times in a day I've got to forgive
[2:47:29] somebody I'm
[2:47:32] moving aren't you moving I'm just
[2:47:36] leaving if if I got somebody in my life
[2:47:39] that I have to forgive 490
[2:47:41] times they ain't in my life a day wh
[2:47:45] what what if it's your
[2:47:47] child what what if he your
[2:47:51] spouse what if he your
[2:47:54] preacher some of us are stuck with each
[2:47:57] other so we're going to have to learn
[2:47:59] what Jesus was trying to teach us even
[2:48:02] if you should have to forgive 490 times
[2:48:06] a day this is what we do because we're
[2:48:09] new create new Creations new creatures
[2:48:12] in Christ
[2:48:15] amen brotherly kindness now you see if a
[2:48:18] brother is All Out Of
[2:48:19] [Music]
[2:48:23] Tune don't be impatient with him
[2:48:27] see no
[2:48:31] see be kind to
[2:48:33] him go
[2:48:40] anyhow I'm not liking this sermon very
[2:48:43] much are you somebody said not long ago
[2:48:46] how can you believe these things the way
[2:48:48] you do and still go to the Assemblies of
[2:48:50] God and the Oneness is Oneness all the
[2:48:52] rest and but see brotherly kindness see
[2:48:55] boy I wish we could get some of that
[2:48:57] around this
[2:49:02] message hoping someday patient with him
[2:49:05] see temperate enduring with him
[2:49:07] knowledge to understand what he believes
[2:49:11] what it wouldn't hurt you
[2:49:14] sometime to
[2:49:16] know before you
[2:49:20] call somebody serpent
[2:49:22] seed it wouldn't hurt you to know a
[2:49:25] little bit about where they are because
[2:49:27] let me tell you something the mentality
[2:49:29] that we have had adopted around this
[2:49:31] message if you present it to them one
[2:49:33] time and they don't throw their whole
[2:49:34] life down and embrace it and put the
[2:49:36] pictures up then it ain't in them is
[2:49:41] wrong that's not even kind that's not
[2:49:44] even like Christ and if that's your
[2:49:47] understanding of this message you're
[2:49:48] you're just as much in a denomination as
[2:49:50] those folks out
[2:49:53] there did I just say
[2:49:56] that because we hear and receive from
[2:50:01] where we
[2:50:02] are and brother I've had people flat
[2:50:05] turn it down don't want to hear another
[2:50:06] word until they got in a in a bind and
[2:50:10] they started needing prayer and and they
[2:50:12] call for prayer and you just gently say
[2:50:14] I have to a few people that I knew very
[2:50:16] well just gently I've said well you know
[2:50:18] if I'm in a
[2:50:21] cult and I'm just following the dead man
[2:50:23] and don't even know who Jesus is I
[2:50:24] believe that is what you said is it why
[2:50:27] would you ask me for
[2:50:31] prayer it's like all the way back to
[2:50:33] high
[2:50:34] school when those guys would roll around
[2:50:36] me on the field Holy Roller Holy
[2:50:42] Roller and I'd just look at him and say
[2:50:45] look I'd rather roll into heaven than
[2:50:46] strut into hell and keep living my life
[2:50:50] and then behind the locker way off to
[2:50:52] the corner captain of the football team
[2:50:55] said Steve my parents are messed up
[2:50:58] marriage ruined they're going to get a
[2:51:00] div would you
[2:51:03] pray going on down the hall and one
[2:51:05] catch me along the way and say my my
[2:51:07] grandmother's in the hospital see if you
[2:51:09] reckon you could go by and pray for her
[2:51:11] on your way home from school today well
[2:51:14] sure I would same thing same thing now
[2:51:19] you saywell if I'm if I'm so wrong why
[2:51:21] in the world would you want prayer and
[2:51:23] and you'd be amazed sometime what they
[2:51:25] say well you've been
[2:51:28] consistent I've seen you just keep
[2:51:29] living the same life and there must be
[2:51:32] something to it well sure I'll pray for
[2:51:34] you no matter what you think about me
[2:51:36] I'll pray for you look what an
[2:51:37] opportunity it might give us to share
[2:51:40] the faith that God has sown into our
[2:51:42] lives please don't put people out as
[2:51:45] quickly as your mind tells you you want
[2:51:47] to
[2:51:49] show them a little Mercy show them a
[2:51:51] little Grace let's believe for isav God
[2:51:55] anointed your eyes to see the word he
[2:51:57] can anoint somebody else's eye well how
[2:52:00] do you know that the whole uh seed ever
[2:52:03] seed of God hadn't come in here's how I
[2:52:05] know I'm still
[2:52:08] here when that last seed of God has come
[2:52:15] in don't be impatient with him somebody
[2:52:17] said let's let's go on uh he said
[2:52:21] knowledge to understand what he believes
[2:52:22] come musicians remember it's in his
[2:52:24] heart that's what it is virtue in
[2:52:26] yourself to let it go out with kindness
[2:52:29] meekness to him having faith that
[2:52:33] someday God will bring him in oh Lord I
[2:52:37] have some folks I want to see you bring
[2:52:39] in I don't care if they ever call the
[2:52:43] name William brandom or not I just want
[2:52:46] them to know you in the fullest Capac
[2:52:48] ity that they can know you
[2:52:52] in if they learn to appreciate what I
[2:52:55] appreciate and receive Revelation that I
[2:52:58] that I'm going to dance a double
[2:53:01] jig but I have had to come to the
[2:53:04] reality that everybody can't see what
[2:53:06] you see and that doesn't mean they're
[2:53:09] unsavable or
[2:53:11] unlovable whosoever calth upon the name
[2:53:14] of the
[2:53:17] Lord they're not
[2:53:20] Overcomers the bride only the bride's
[2:53:22] going to
[2:53:23] overcome 3:16 brotherly kindness the
[2:53:26] seven thing one 2 3 4 five brother Ram
[2:53:28] tapped chalkboard don't need to know
[2:53:30] that see seven thing then now you're
[2:53:31] coming next thing then add charity which
[2:53:33] is love that's the capping Stone one of
[2:53:37] these days maybe you're thinking this
[2:53:39] morning as we close I could never get to
[2:53:42] that
[2:53:43] place oh
[2:53:46] yes oh yes yes you
[2:53:50] can and here's how one more
[2:53:53] quote just one more I've been planning
[2:53:57] this perfect strength by Perfect
[2:54:00] weakness number 54 perfect
[2:54:03] strength by Perfect weakness when we are
[2:54:07] insufficient
[2:54:10] ourselves then we are subjects to yield
[2:54:14] to God's
[2:54:16] spirit come on
[2:54:19] you with me as long as we think that we
[2:54:23] can do
[2:54:25] it we can't do it but when we get to a
[2:54:29] place where we know we can't do
[2:54:32] it then we yield oursel to God and guess
[2:54:36] what he does it through us that's his
[2:54:39] plan so then if it's us trying to do it
[2:54:42] it will
[2:54:43] fail but if we'll just yield ourselves
[2:54:46] to God then God can't fa fail there's
[2:54:49] only one thing that God cannot do and
[2:54:51] that's fail he cannot do anything else
[2:54:55] excuse me he can do anything else but
[2:54:57] fail but he cannot fail so as long as
[2:55:01] we're trying in ourselves and depending
[2:55:03] on our own abilities and so forth well
[2:55:06] we'll do nothing we'll foam and spit and
[2:55:09] sputter and temper and whatever El but
[2:55:11] when we get to a place where we know
[2:55:12] we're nothing oh Jesus oh
[2:55:17] Jesus folks this is opposite of the
[2:55:20] denominational Church message the
[2:55:22] denominational Church message is you're
[2:55:24] you can do
[2:55:26] anything you can do anything yeah oh
[2:55:29] yeah you can be president you can do
[2:55:32] anything that's not
[2:55:34] reality everybody everybody is not going
[2:55:37] to make it to that kind of a position
[2:55:40] doesn't mean you're not smart it's the
[2:55:43] same uh uh humanism that says everybody
[2:55:47] that runs a have a prize that's not what
[2:55:49] the scripture
[2:55:51] said the one that endures to the end and
[2:55:54] passes the line he's the one that gets
[2:55:55] the prize but today we don't want to
[2:55:57] hurt no child's feelings so everybody
[2:55:59] gets a ribbon and and you know good
[2:56:02] participation or something they call it
[2:56:04] oh my goodness setting our children up
[2:56:07] for a lifetime of disappointment and
[2:56:09] failure because somebody's going to do
[2:56:11] it while they're over there rejoicing
[2:56:14] that they participated somebody's going
[2:56:16] to pass them say same way same
[2:56:21] way they're just pumping people up with
[2:56:24] self-esteem I hear the message all the
[2:56:28] time it's a Joel osin gospel that
[2:56:32] doesn't mean that he doesn't say amazing
[2:56:34] things that you can apply to your life
[2:56:37] but everybody can't apply that kind of
[2:56:40] mentality and it's so opposite of what
[2:56:42] we've been taught really in the message
[2:56:45] because the message tells us from the
[2:56:47] word by the way that if we empty
[2:56:50] ourselves and recognize I can't do
[2:56:53] anything without
[2:56:56] him the bride she's not
[2:57:00] dumb she's not lazy she's not
[2:57:04] stupid we're not ignorant backwood folk
[2:57:07] that don't know how to get in or get out
[2:57:09] like they say but we have learned I pray
[2:57:12] we have if we haven't we got to learn it
[2:57:15] quickly that we're nothing without him
[2:57:18] without the bridegroom the bride is like
[2:57:20] a
[2:57:22] Wallflower but with him she becomes a
[2:57:25] beautiful queen we must have him we've
[2:57:28] got to have him I just wish that
[2:57:30] sometimes they would add that to a
[2:57:32] little little add of that just a touch
[2:57:34] of that to the gospel that they preach
[2:57:36] without Jesus just flat out get up there
[2:57:38] in front of hundreds of thousands of
[2:57:40] people and say without Jesus you are a
[2:57:45] flunky nobody buy that book
[2:57:50] can you imagine how many copies of that
[2:57:52] book could sell in the self-help section
[2:57:55] but it's a reality without Jesus we were
[2:57:58] not made to succeed without Jesus we
[2:58:02] were created to only Excel connected to
[2:58:14] him but as long as we're trying in
[2:58:16] ourselves let's go ping down but when we
[2:58:19] get to a place where we know we're
[2:58:21] nothing God can use us the important
[2:58:22] thing one of the uh one of the important
[2:58:24] things that we must Master especially
[2:58:27] you young preachers and lay members
[2:58:28] alike there's one thing that we've got
[2:58:30] to master if we expect to fulfill God's
[2:58:32] desire in our life that is we have to
[2:58:34] master our thought of human
[2:58:37] ability if we NE if we ever get to a
[2:58:39] spot where we think we can do it with
[2:58:41] our own intelligence and out of our own
[2:58:43] abilities we've got to master that in
[2:58:45] such a way we can get rid of the thing
[2:58:46] and lay it aside so that God can use us
[2:58:49] two more paragraphs and make a complete
[2:58:51] surrender and make a complete surrender
[2:58:54] and make a complete surrender we cannot
[2:58:57] use one ability we've got to make a
[2:58:59] complete surrender and to come to God
[2:59:02] you've got to surrender to him both soul
[2:59:04] body and spirit everything that you are
[2:59:07] has to be
[2:59:12] surrendered everything that you are has
[2:59:14] to be surrendered to God in order that
[2:59:15] he can work his will in you and me now
[2:59:19] that's hard I know because we're always
[2:59:21] wanting to put our part in something
[2:59:23] that we know we know we want to do it we
[2:59:25] say well I just know it should be done
[2:59:27] this way but as long as you're doing it
[2:59:30] that way it's going to be wrong and God
[2:59:33] will never use that effort maybe with
[2:59:36] the help of the Lord we're going to get
[2:59:38] uh into that in a few minutes and just
[2:59:39] show you how God cannot use your ability
[2:59:44] that is the truth let's stand together

[3:13:27] the same life you took an
[3:13:31] Abram and you breathed over him
[3:13:36] life and you made him an
[3:13:40] Abraham Abram was a good

[3:14:49] of the perfect
[3:14:51] man the John 1 one man in the beginning
[3:14:55] was the word the word was with
[3:14:57] God that word became
[3:15:00] flesh your Prophet told us that in the
[3:15:02] last days that word in us would become
[3:15:05] flesh again that it would flesh out that
[3:15:07] it would manifest in our
[3:15:11] lives we feel like Lord that we're we're
[3:15:14] the hindrance we're we're the one in
[3:15:16] your ways
[3:15:18] we have not been able to control these
