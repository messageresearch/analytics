TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and I want to tell you what a privilege it is to come to you here on this fine Christian television network I'm so happy to be a part of the ministry of this network sharing the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ throughout the nations of the world and I'm excited because I believe there's a lot of activity in the realm of the spirit and I believe that we are approaching probably the most exciting time in the history of mankind I know that if you read the news or you watch the television news you will see that the world is shaking and groaning wars and rumors of wars Global threats of terrorism signs in the skies Heavens wonders you know it's really the Bible just coming to fulfillment and reality before our eyes Okay preacher then why would you say it's an exciting time and perhaps the best time well there's never been a more appropriate hour for the Lord Jesus Christ to embody himself by the holy spirit in a body of Believers in a corporate people all over the world those who are washed in the blood of the Lamb Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire to embody that company of Believers and use them for a harvest yes it's time now for souls to come in to the kingdom of God because we are living in the end time there are uncertainties of course we don't know every detail of what tomorrow holds but I I want to remind you those of you who have Blessed Assurance of your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ I want to remind you that he is the one holding tomorrow and because of that we can rest in him we can take our rest in the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that we are swiftly approaching an hour where we will re will we will see a return of the spirit and power of Elijah in a corporate body of people that are being prepared even right now as we speak they're still in the fire those purifying fires of trials and tribulation but they're coming out of that fire just around the corner and when they do they're going to be filled with a new kind of fire the fire and power of God to heal the sick raise the Dead Set captives free and fulfill that portion of scripture concerning the end time and what God wants to do in and through a body of people if you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ if you have not trusted him in his power to save you and to deliver you you can do it now you don't have to wait until you can join a church or get to a preacher I pray that God will lead you in finding a body of people that you can in fellowship with because that's absolutely important to be strengthened I certainly believe that but you don't have to wait until Sunday to call on the name of the Lord you can call on him now right where you are and he will hear you and forgive your sins and set you free from the powers of Darkness that desire to reside in your life not only to reside there Satan is out to destroy you but greater is he once you get him in once you invite him in Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world I want to begin a series today on the spirit and power of Elijah and in order to do that we're going to study past present and future we want to look at the Elijah of the Old Testament we want to examine some of his characteristics and attributes we also want to look at some scriptures that tell us that the spirit and power of Elijah will be of of such importance that it will not just visit the Earth as it did in in the historical scriptures but that there will actually be a return and another return perhaps another Return of the spirit and power of Elijah so we're looking at another anointing with a specific purpose a specific calling and pattern that is so important and valued by God that in his sovereignty he would decide I don't just want this spirit in the earth once but I want it to return and return and return and return and I believe that we are about to see another installment of the spirit and power of Elijah not in just one man as it was in Elijah and Elisha and John the Baptist Etc but in a corporate body of people the body of Jesus Christ specifically the overcoming remnant bride now we mentioned a minute ago the darkness that's covering the Earth this was prophesied in both the older Covenant and the newer Covenant or the older Testament and what we've called the New Testament or newer Testament both testify of Darkness that would surround the Earth but what an amazing opportunity for you and I to arise and shine and reflect the glory of God you know what it comes down to it comes down to a body of people having to put in action what they have taught what they have preached what they have believed like my granny used to say we've got to practice what we PR prach and it's time for those who name the name of the Lord those who have experienced the power of God through salvation to arise perhaps you have you know become a little slack it happens maybe you're in a slumbering state and so I ask that the holy spirit of God will come to you right now and awaken you out of your sleep out of your lethargy that he will shake you and anoint you and encourage encourage you and Empower you to move forward I know you've been through a lot how do you know that you don't know me preacher well I tell you what I know I know that the body of Christ all over the world has been in the fire I know that I know that it feels like the fires of persecution it feels like even fires of Destruction but what it really boils down to is the fire of God purifying us getting us ready so that when Satan comes he will not find anything in us that agrees with him but all that is in us will only agree with the Lord Jesus Christ that is the deepest desire of my heart and I've been I've been following the Lord a long time since I was a seven-year-old boy and yet I feel God dealing in my heart and in my life right now at this particular moment I'm being a little transparent with you because I love you and I want to help you I want to encourage you in this hour I feel God dealing in my life in a deeper way than I have felt him in a long time now it's not always easy when God comes and puts his finger on some things in your life that he wants to uh extract that he wants you to expel to get rid of uh it's not always easy to see yourself Through The Eyes of God's word word or Through The Eyes of the Holy Spirit but when you do you're helpless you can't fix yourself you can't change the things about you that are not like you'd like for them to be not really because they're rooted deeply in in our soul but what we can do is allow the work of the Holy Spirit you know we kind of have to take our hands off the off the steering wheel of our automobile and let let God Drive let him be in charge let him be in control and when he puts his finger on something in your life in my life that that that he's not happy with that disappoints him that brings him pain what we have to do then is allow him to finish the work you know pinpointing where we need change is only part of the process in fact that's the easiest part of the process it's when God reaches in and begins to pull it out by the roots and I don't know if you're if you're a gardener or not but I confess it's something that I enjoy doing I don't get enough time to do it like I really have enjoyed in times past but I know that when you're pulling a weed out of the garden uh we have something called crab grass that that runs it'll it'll jump in the flower bed you know and just run right through it and you start pulling that up and it keeps coming and keeps coming and keeps coming and uh you're surprised sometime how long that root system is but if you don't get that thing out and every little root attached you'll come back later and find that it is growing again and thriving again because you maybe removed everything above the dirt and perhaps you even remove part of the roots but you left something in there underneath the surface and it's thriving again and taking over The Garden of your heart so allow the Holy Spirit to lay the axe to the root of the tree let him go as deep as he needs to go get that root dig it right out you know as I said that I I I saw something in the eye of my spirit and I saw uh one of my sons with a splinter it just came to me a splinter in his finger I've had one in mine but having four children they've all had one uh at one time or another and sometimes large I had my youngest son running out in the woods barefooted and stepped on a really a stump and a real big piece of of wood went right up in his foot and you know we love our children and we don't like for them to suffer and when I found out what had happened I reacted in a very silly way you know what I said I said to him you'll never play in the woods again I'll never let you run barefooted in the yard again now wasn't that a silly thing he's a boy he's he's going to want to run through the woods and I want him to and I don't always want him to have to wear shoes either but that was my first reaction but once we were able to get all that dug out I think he had to go to the emergency room that time there was so much of it once all that is dug out and the wound is is clean C and it's bandag so that no more dirt can get in that wound begins to heal and uh as as hard as it is you know I've gone in with the tweezers to try to dig them out and that's not easy because you you know that your child is hurting in the process but you also know that it's necessary to ignore it would cause infection it has to be dealt with oh holy spirit of God we want to give you full Sway and Our Lives to deal with us to get to the root of the issue that's hindering our fellowship with you with God and our fellowship with one another and if you'll commit to do your part and that's really let go and let God that's your part he'll do his part I know that I know above all things God is faithful there are many things we could say about God but one of the most important things that I know about him and his character his attributes is he is faithful uh faithful in a way that you know really we humans we're not really capable of being faithful like God is but we sure try to be faithful in all things but God never misses he never misses an appointment he never forgets your prayer needs or your prayer request he never forgets to keep the Earth in its orbit and and the stars shining and all the things that to go on and and in the Earth as it continues to go God is just a sovereign and good and faithful God and I just encourage you to Bow before him humble your heart before him and let his word work in you let his blood cover even a multitude of sin if you're bound if you're addicted if you have issues that you are not able to uh be free from allow the work of God to have full control in your life and he will do what only he can do and when you get to that place and when I get to that place when the corporate body of Jesus Christ begins to get to that place where we have been purified by his refining fire I believe that is the hour that we will see The Return of the spirit and power of Elijah to to demonstrate yes to demonstrate the works of God but also to set in action One Sweep final sweep of harvest and uh after that I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ is going home to the marriage supper of the lamb and the scriptures record what will happen on the earth in the earth during that period of time and it looks black and it looks bleak but then our Lord comes back with the redeemed praise God he comes on a White Horse He Who is faithful and true and uh puts a stop to some pretty awful Warfare going on in the Earth at that time the Earth gets a renovation in the future as you know and Jesus our lord Yeshua our Messiah Reigns from Jerusalem in a glorious 1,000 years of peace you know sometimes when we talk about that uh it feels to us like a fairy tale it it it seems like a good novel that someone wrote a good piece of fiction but I want you to know that it is as real as anything has ever been I believe that with all of my heart that that these promises that we have are sure and that we're going to see yes there's going to be some more shaking in in the earth Peril and Terror I want you to know I fully acknowledged that we're going to see the rise of the Antichrist and the Antichrist system we're going to see false religion grow all over the world uh so similar to the wheat the Bible describes the tear so similar to the wheat that that many people could be deceived into thinking that they have the right Faith the right religion when in all actuality they have joined themselves with a false system a harlot system of false religion and so we know that if it is indeed the one prophesied by the Scripture it has to look very similar in many aspects to the original Faith to to the word of God to the triumphant church that the Bible describes and so that disqualifies a lot of religions and that's not to say that the enemy won't have his way in using many religions many denominational systems to distract people from the true church but when that Antichrist system uh takes its Authority in the earth it will be very similar the Bible describes to the original faith and that's how many will be deceived but I have a promise and I want to share it with you and that is the Bible said that the elect of God would not be deceived it says they would be deceived if it were possible you know that is a big if if if if it were possible and I happen to believe that it will not be possible for the true genuine elected bride of Jesus Christ to be deceived and so uh what should we do if we have this idea that we're being called to that Holy Remnant the first thing we need to do is lay down our lives again just like we did when we got saved Just Surrender again and say Lord I'm beginning to recognize that I have a higher Destiny in my life and I lay it down I just want to lay my life down before you and I'm going to wait on you to pick it up and use it in any way that you see fit well I'm having such a good time just sharing with you almost like we were sharing a good cup of coffee together or uh a nice piece of pie but I guess I better get to the scripture here because I want to lay a little foundation for the series that we're beginning I'm going to start in the Book of Malachi that's that little prophetic book just before what we call the New Testament it it's it's uh the last book of the Old Testament Malachi chapter 4 beginning in verse 4 all the way to verse 6 let's read it remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments verse five behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord now this was many years after the Prophet Elijah had lived on the earth and had already been caught up into heaven as we read in the scripture and yet Malachi says Elijah will come again before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and then verse six and we're going to refer to verse six probably many times over the course of the next few broadcast and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now this sounds like an extremely prophetic and important event that will preedee the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and so if it's that important in Scripture that it forer runs that great and Dreadful day of the Lord then we should examine it to see what it means has it already been completely fulfilled and has no future application at all or is there a possibility that there have been installments of fulfillment through the church ages Through The Years starting with Elisha who was uh the follower or the student of Elijah the prophet then moving to John the Baptist is there a possibility that uh at the end of the church ages there has also already been a return of the spirit and power of Elijah are we uh truly expecting and should we be expecting that there will be another installment in the last day army of the Lord and then the scripture talks about those two witnesses those two Olive branches one of whom will be Elijah or at least have the spirit of Elijah that's another installment and so uh this is interesting an interesting study to me I often have thought about why not why not the return of the spirit of of Isaiah uh why not the return of the spirit of Joshua or some of the other great men Malachi for instance this great prophet we're reading from today and we could go on and on but only two uh mentioned in the scripture who will have a a continued kind of ministry at least by the release of their spirit and That Was Elijah and in some manner also Moses and so there must be something in the anointing and the calling that were on those two men's lives that God said Sending uh two men one time with that Spirit into the Earth is not enough it needs to go back and back and back and each time the spirit and power of Elijah returned to the Earth they accomplish the same kind of ministry and it is a Ministry of reconciliation it is a Ministry of exposure because it exposes the fallacy of false religion and lukewarm Christianity it exposes false Doctrine uh it brings somewhat judgment to the to the prophets of ba it it it accomplishes quite a few things and uh one of the things that we think about because of the life and commission of John the Baptist which we'll talk about in a future broadcast was to prepare a people for the Lord and so this Spirit of Elijah and power of Elijah is to prepare a people for the Lord for the coming of the Lord a full Redemption of a body of people to be presented to the Lord as his treasure as his inheritance oh this this baffles me that I could be a treasure uh that I could be what Jesus will inherit I look at my life I look at at you know what I've been through and sometimes struggle to keep my spirit right and I think oh some inheritance you know I I'm not I'm not you know really that valuable that big of a treasure that the Lord would would would inherit that he would earn and yet he doesn't see it that way at all that's the blessing he doesn't see it that way at all because he sees me as fully purchased fully redeemed fully Walking In His Image how is that possible because he sees me through the filter of his blood when he sees me we used to sing this song often when he sees me he sees the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah he sees me as worthy and not as I am he views me in garments as white as the snow for the Lamb of God is worthy and he washed me this I know that's how he can see me through the blood because that's the cleansing agent that has washed me and made me whole and he's not finished with me yet he's not finished with you yet and yet when he sees me he sees me completed perfected In His Image and he knows that His Holy Spirit and his blood and his word his sanctifying power is more than enough to accomplish what else needs to be accomplished in my life so that I could truly be his peculiar treasure that valuable Pearl in the field and that's what God is looking for that's what he is uh searching out in this hour and you and I get to be a part of that praise God I want to say that when we examine the word spirit and power we begin to learn a lot about what should and will be accomplished each and every time the spirit of Elijah and power of Elijah returns to the earth I have to go already but I want to pray as we go off the air that God will do a mighty work in your life as you trust him more and more father I thank you right now that you have given me this opportunity to address your people and some of them are already walking in the faith and others of them you're wooing them and calling them right now in this hour and I ask you in the mighty name of Jesus to wash us all the same in your precious blood draw Us by your spirit into right standing right Fellowship right communion with you heal the sick as you promised in your word and we'll be careful to give you glory honor and praise in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you thank you for watching today byebye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] go
