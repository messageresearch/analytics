[0:00] i want you to understand
[0:02] what we mean when we sing let the
[0:04] worshipers arise
[0:07] there is an authority
[0:09] in the bride of christ
[0:11] that the church at large does not have
[0:15] she doesn't have that same authority she
[0:18] doesn't have his heart like you do and
[0:20] his ear like you do not in this hour
[0:24] but this is what the prophet said he
[0:26] said now sons and daughters
[0:29] who has the most power before god
[0:32] what is an angel
[0:34] an angel is a servant that's right that
[0:37] right
[0:38] he said they're his servants what are
[0:40] you
[0:41] his son
[0:42] and daughter
[0:44] who has the most power in heaven then a
[0:47] sinner that's been saved by grace or an
[0:50] archangel
[0:52] that's standing by his right side
[0:55] the sinner
[0:58] the sinner
[0:59] that's been saved by grace
[1:02] has more authority in heaven
[1:09] oh
[1:11] hallelujah
[1:13] the sinner that's been saved by grace
[1:16] has more authority in heaven than the
[1:18] archangel that stood by his side without
[1:22] sin
[1:23] because he's a son son has more
[1:27] authority than a servant of course
[1:31] so when you come into his presence to
[1:34] praise him you don't come as a beggar
[1:38] you don't come as just a servant you
[1:41] have a special invitation as one of his
[1:45] sons to come before him and worship him
[1:51] this is the week of purim and on
[1:54] wednesday night as the sun goes down we
[1:57] begin to think about purim on thursday
[2:01] until thursday night and we think about
[2:04] a little girl
[2:06] she wasn't much to look at
[2:09] but born for a purpose
[2:12] born for a reason little hadassah we
[2:15] call her esther and she came
[2:19] knowing not in the moment what her
[2:21] purpose was but god revealed it to her
[2:26] and when all the other girls concubines
[2:29] came they were all painted up like the
[2:32] world likes to paint up dolled up like
[2:35] the world and frizzy hair and jewels and
[2:39] all that stuff hanging on her on them
[2:42] and they didn't find favor but esther
[2:46] she asked the servant she asked the
[2:48] chamberlain of the king what must i do
[2:53] what can i do to gain his favor
[2:56] oh let me tell you something little
[2:58] bride god has sent a servant to tell us
[3:02] from the word what we must do to be
[3:05] pleasing in his side let's come like
[3:08] esther today i want to worship him i
[3:12] want to get in here and worship him like
[3:14] esther i want to be able to reach up
[3:17] when he extends his scepter toward us
[3:21] today i want to be able to reach up and
[3:24] touch the tip of his scepter and hear
[3:27] him say my beloved what do you have need
[3:31] of today
[3:32] oh make sure as you're going before the
[3:35] king to worship him you remember who you
[3:37] are you're a son of the most high god
[3:41] you weren't born in the ephesian church
[3:43] age you weren't born in thyatira or
[3:47] smyrna or
[3:48] all the other philadelphia you were born
[3:51] for such a time as this to live in
[3:55] laodicea the most wicked age of all not
[3:59] so that you can be overcome by the
[4:01] lukewarm spirit of the age but so that
[4:04] you can overcome in all things remember
[4:08] your authority as you worship him today
[4:15] i'm surrendering my own
[4:22] i surrender to the king
[4:29] [Music]
[4:41] i'm surrendering
[4:48] i surrender to the keys
