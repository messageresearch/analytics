[0:00] but i want you to know you have an elder
[0:02] brother
[0:04] you have one who chose to be made lower
[0:07] than the angels
[0:16] for both he that sanctifieth and
[0:19] they who are sanctified are
[0:23] all of one
[0:27] you hear it one substance
[0:31] one life of a living god
[0:34] they are one for which cause
[0:38] he is not ashamed to call them brethren
[0:41] you know that is a a small phrase
[0:44] with a huge testimony he is not ashamed
[0:49] of your weakness he is not ashamed of
[0:52] your shortcoming
[0:54] he became like us and walked as
[0:57] our brother so that he might understand
[1:00] the struggle
[1:01] of this life and even when we fail him
[1:04] and even when we disappoint him
[1:05] he doesn't say i'm none of them i don't
[1:07] even know who they are
[1:09] but i want you to know you have an elder
[1:11] brother
[1:13] you have one who chose to be made lower
[1:16] than the angels
[1:18] he chose to come as the seed of abraham
[1:21] in the natural that he might be a real
[1:23] brother
[1:24] to us that he might understand
[1:27] the life that we live and the suffering
[1:29] that we go through
[1:31] and the temptations that we face and
[1:33] even when we
[1:34] are embarrassing he is not ashamed to
[1:38] say
[1:38] they're mine they're mine i'm going to
[1:42] claim them
[1:43] just like we claim our children
[1:46] there's been times we'd like to
[1:48] disassociate ourselves from that
[1:50] but we love them so much that we
[1:54] just have to love them in their in their
[1:55] shortcoming and love them in their
[1:57] failure
[1:58] just like he loves us what a promise
[2:01] this
[2:01] is i wish that i could say today that
[2:04] i've never
[2:05] embarrassed him or that i've never
[2:07] brought him shame
[2:09] but the reality is the truth is all
[2:12] sons have fallen short we've everyone
[2:15] brought a moment of of of shame
[2:19] and as he would look at us see us
[2:22] knowing that we're living way below what
[2:25] we were created to live
[2:27] but he doesn't give up on us have you
[2:29] got a problem
[2:30] go to the throne have you got a sickness
[2:34] go to the throne have you got to worry
[2:37] go to the throne
[2:39] are your children causing you to pace
[2:41] the floor go to the throne
[2:43] let us therefore come boldly
[2:46] unto the throne of grace that we might
[2:49] receive the mercy
[2:50] that is needed and find grace to help us
[2:54] in the time of need and there is a key
[2:57] there's a very
[2:58] important feature here it's how we
[3:01] approach the throne
[3:02] not begging not pleading not bowed down
[3:05] with shame
[3:06] but come boldly as one who knows
[3:09] i'm going to be recognized when i get
[3:11] there
[3:12] you don't have to worry he's going to
[3:14] know who you are
[3:16] he's going to know what your need is
[3:18] before you well what if i get down
[3:20] before that throne and i don't know what
[3:22] to ask for
[3:23] and i just stutter and stammer all
[3:25] around don't you worry
[3:27] he knows the need before we ever ask him
[3:31] and he knows who we are and as the song
[3:34] said this morning
[3:35] he sees my weakness you're going to
[3:38] spend time telling the lord
[3:39] how low down you are and how weak you
[3:42] are and how frail you are
[3:44] when he already knows that's not what
[3:46] he's asking you to do
[3:47] he's already seen our failure he's
[3:50] already seen our moment of weakness
[3:52] he's already seen our sin and unbelief
[3:54] but yet he says come
[3:57] accept it come accepted in the beloved
[4:01] come boldly to the throne of grace no
[4:04] shame
[4:05] no condemnation just filled with
[4:08] faith and accepting our position
[4:14] you
