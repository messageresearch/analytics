that I've done and I'm still getting tons of great feedback from them and so I'm going to continue to do them as long as the Lord allows me to do it today I'm uh joined by a very special guest brother Bobby WS he's been a huge friend to our family and a huge blessing to us and when I started this podcast uh after the very first one he called me and told me how much it me how much it meant to him and what a blessing it was and I actually had to you know given them the idea about you know it would be amazing to get you down here on one and that day has finally come so I'm super excited to have them and welcome on the podcast I'm glad you're here well thanks for having me I'm I'm I'm excited for it this is something I've been looking forward to and I'm glad it worked out yeah everything I always said everything happen for a reason reason for everything we're going to get to that and it was a time you know it worked out perfect today for sure because we're coming down we're headed south and we're not going to Tucson this year first time first time in 60 years I haven't gone to Tucson that's crazy to think about yeah are you is that a little bit Bittersweet better sweet uh yes and no yeah really I mean we're not having Harmon this year yeah so we had harbon 17 years in a row and that was a that was a challenge I'll be honest with you it takes a toll on you for sure no I not toll it just a lot of pressure yeah with singers that don't know how to sing and I shouldn't say that no but people that want to sing you know people that I know good people good people you know everybody you know everybody's a singer in their own way and I I learned the lesson and one time there this guy got up and set bad I mean it was bad and I said man next time we won't have him sing and the a brother come up afterwards he said you know what that guy meant to me when he sang that song and never said it again cuz you never know on them things when you touch somebody you never know the songs and you were on Harmony enough that you how I run that I always told him if you get I trust you if I didn't trust you you wouldn't be on stage sir you would not be there you'd meet Mr WS nobody wants to me this no but it was uh if they felt led to sing another verse go ahead because you get something pulling on you you better do that you better do what the Lord lead you to do not Mr WS or brother WS you have to L if you do it again yeah and that's the way I did that things that's and that's the way I am and you know we started Harmony we'll go right into that Harmony we'll go right into harmony started Harmony because I was in Tucson and I got tired if you went to Brother gre's Church they did people didn't talk to you you want to brother McHugh's Church they didn't get along yeah and I like Good gospel music I go to I go to the nqc National quet Convention I used to go with brother green and we used to used to be in Louisville and I take my dad and I had 12 tickets to that every year and brother Billy Paul would go with us and the people from voice of God I'd give them tickets and they'd all come and and I like Good gospel music I really do I like good singing it and um I talked to brother green one year about that I said why don't we just do that let's just have a little Harmony in Tucson so I didn't say Harmony we we sat down one day at First Cafeteria with brother green and about six or seven other brothers young men there and um we had to come up with a name we couldn't come and then and one then they come to Harmony in the desert I said that's the that's what we're going to do Harmon because it's music that yeah Harmony we wanted Harmony cuz we had different we had different names and you know Believers and singers or whatever and that's that's how we got there with brother green and the harmony got started because I wanted everybody to love each each other there's no preaching there at Harmony no preaching at all and if you do you get shut off your M your might get shut off you meet Mr words but I mean not being smart about it but that's just the way it was there was no preaching and you know I wanted people to Fellowship I wanted to show the love is what I wanted to do there we met a lot of good people I mean we met people um from all over it I mean and just thinking about like us like the kids or whatever we met people from Harmony that we would have never met ever if it wasn't before Harmony I mean like Hunter aong and people like that uh Abe and you know will and all them we never met them if it wasn't for Harmony and you know being able to go there and it's been good I mean the kids all got together the kids would be more friendlier than the adults but I think we had a we had Harmony was good it worked for 17 years it was good uh it was uh like I said no preaching and uh nothing against preachers or whatever but I mean I didn't want it to be a a thing like that I wanted to sing it good singers We There was good singers from all over the country I mean wow I couldn't believe we had some that kind of caliber around it I I knew that but I didn't for sure and the reason I did it I didn't have brother green do it I didn't have it at the church the first year was at the Civic Center in tucon before Christmas I thought that'd be good because everybody don't have Christmas well I found out that people do have Christmas I learned that one that was our first one right before Christmas and then we went to the fox seed for two years and that was a really interesting experience and uh now what what year did was the first one that been 17 years 2006 I believe and that was the Civic Center and then we uh brother uh it was really interesting cuz I don't know music I don't know a note from a do man I'm not stupid on that them guys were say play C or D or give me f or whatever and I don't have a clue just say sing the song to him that's what I say just sing it but that's the way I am and and then and brother Swanson come to me afterwards and he was professional he used to travel with Billy Graham and them okay and his daughter pharoh was a violinist and it got down at first night or second I he says you don't have a clue what you're doing I said you got that right but you know what when the Lord tells me to do something I do it I'm just going to be honest with you that's you know and that's what I told him and it I reminded him that a couple years ago he didn't like it but that's what he told me but you know Harmony was good for different people we met got some marriages out of it you know yeah some girl married somebody from Texas he's from New Zealand so they live in New Zealand and so and then kids and idah they got some married there well a kid from Tucson got married there really uh yeah Noah oh not Noah uh Jordan's brother Enoch Enoch yeah might so so that was I forgot that yeah yeah you know there about five six marriages so we call it eHarmony so I remember but it's yeah you were yeah but it was you know it was good for the kids to do that and we had some choirs there with the kids and that went very well for a short time the kids really enjoyed it and uh I don't you know I how should I say I like good music and there was really good music there I mean there's some good sign there and like at Harmony there when they somebody uh if I felt somebody put something together I just did it brother Terry Tidwell was brother Swanson was singing there and brother Josh Duff was sit beside me and always had sat in the corner and listen I try to keep it quiet where I was at and and uh brother Josh you sit beside me and brother uh Swanson was singing up there and I brother Terry come in first time I I met brother Terry one year he was there Tidwell and I said Go sing with him and he says do what I said Go sing with him are you sure I said yeah go sing with him kep down with the song and brother Swanson come back he said how' you know I wanted him sing with me he said I prayed for that this morning wow so when you feel led to do something you have to do it and they beautiful I remember the like same kind of situation that happened uh the last year the kids as kids were there there was that younger boy that was practicing and Benjamin was sitting next to you and you told Benjamin to go up there and sing with them and of course Ben's like are you sure like really and you're like no go do it yeah and he did it and ended up that oh it's beautiful that's the things that's that's how I do that's that's how I do every lot of things that way I'm my wife don't like it but I'm that way we're going to do it you know I just do it that way cuz you know you when you feel led to do something you better do it for sure you know you know like calling people I'll do that I'll call people I she knows I was on the phone all day today talking to people when I come under my mind I talk to people for sure just a cool call just say hi or whatever how you doing you know that's the way I look at them things cuz you never know when somebody needs it yeah no that that's and brother brandham was love I knew brother brandham you know I lived a block and a half from him when we lived in tcel he lived there at Park Avenue so that's how I got to meet brother Brandon what was it like growing up around brother brandom and the family and uh interesting we were there uh Joe I call him Joe because I grew up with him he was my best man in my wedding and now I'm not trying to brag on this I'm not bragging Joe is a good friend of mine still to this day we're good friends and I don't like people using him and abusing him I'll be honest with you they tried to come to me that way and I just sorry but um brother Brandon was lived right around the corner he'd come over and pick up Joe cuz Joe stayed with us I mean we took care of him cuz he go out to eat he didn't want to go out to eat with his had mom he just 10 12 years old he didn't want he didn't like going out to eat go to F with the old people and didn't like that so he'd come over he stayed spend the night and stuff we did a lot of things in the we were kids we used to go down the university and play football at nighted cuz we had lights down there we go down throw the football at the University and just different things of kids but brother Brandon was very uh humbled we were there we're on a Saturday morning I can remember it uh he we're riding our bikes Joe and I were riding our bikes here and he said boys come here I want to show you something and that's when the Life Magazine come out with the with the with the with the Angels mhm and he tipped it over and showed us he said now look at this magazine he showed us that morning that picture wow see that I go back with brother brandham CU we met brother brandham when I was 12 years old I had an operation and I was out here that winter with my dad cuz I couldn't go back to school and I met Joel that day that year we got along really well as kids and um and that's we met him the first time when I was out here and then uh we just clicked him and I just clicked this you know and uh uh my ab Maran and Gan Norman that's my dad's sister okay and my uncle Willard is my dad's brother and he's the one that give my uncle Jean the magazine okay the magazine the show brother brandham and that's how that goes about and my uncle Jee was the one that brought brother brandham back when the seven Steel when he did the Seven Seals he drove him home wow I didn't know that okay yeah he drove him home and uh J was hot with him he was over there voice uh Sun said all lot with brother bandam H my uncle jene was a hunter and uh that's where my dad was when brother brandham grabbed his hand you call him little Dy my dad was 6'4 big man you always called me little Donnie and he touch he says what's that on your ear he said I don't brother B I don't want to bother with it he says what's he said you know what's wrong he says I kind of know what's wrong but it's all right that's when brother brandham said I was quicking power he had cancer he had brain cancer so that's he was a quicking power that was my dad and uh it said he and then the quote it said he'd never had a scarf from it or anything no no no quit bleeding bleeding for 6 months or something like that just the drop of blood out of his ear there so and uh so that's uh that's that little testimony and then uh we went fishing with brother brownon one time with my uncle Jean MH and we're at Speedway and two sou Speedway in Fourth Avenue there's a fruit store right there I remember right the place cuz I was sitting in the back seat with my brother Mike and uh he kept B me ask him ask him cuz I had Polio when I was younger 13 months old and and uh brother Brown says Bobby if you didn't have the polio You' never know where you'd go you know there's everything happened for a reason he said you probably would never stop you know and I and I look at that that's what I say to everybody I look at that all the time there's a reason for everything and it's tough sometimes I'm going to tell you yeah it's tough to look at reasons why you things happen that way and uh CU it's tough for me to get around man you see that at har manyy I mean I'll sit there give a little red light and fight and do this or that but I mean it's just the way it is cu if I didn't I'd probably be you never know I could have been an alcoholic I could have been anything you know so that's that's what I look at if I had to nickel for every time you have told me you know something you know that's for a reason or everything's for a reason you know it's it's something that ever since I met you and you started telling me that that I've tried to live by because sometimes things are super hard to understand but you know the Lord has you yeah you boys got in a wreck yeah you know but that's what I tell people 3 seconds it's over man you have a second chance uh like a flat tire oh man I got a flat tire and uh or red light man I got to get to church I'm late but you never know there's a reason behind that stuff just like like uh in during Thanksgiving time I was driving back down from Myrtle Beach and it was supposed to be like a 7-hour drive ended up taking me almost 11 hour drive because of the traffic and rain and stuff and even then like I was getting so frustrated and I caught myself and I even said it out loud a couple times Everything's for a reason everything's for a reason and I would get up maybe another mile or so and there'd be another car accident thank you Lord you know that could have been me if I was if I wouldn't have been stuck in that traffic a little ways back yeah and you got to look at them things that way I mean because everything's you know the Lord works this mysterious ways I'm just going to tell you that he just handles things in mysterious ways that you you'll never figure out why you did this or why that girl left me or you know why did that guy do that to me or whatever and you know or why did I say that other guy but you know people look at you you got already you know people do watch everything you do and say and for sure you know that's the Reas I never use my name I use my name in I mean they don't need to know who I am can I've just been Hest with you you know I'm a businessman and they don't need to who know I am it doesn't matter who I am you know I'm kind of crazy but that's all right hey it's okay it's just Mr wordss that's Mr WS coming out um there's there's also something that you have that you've always given out and you probably I don't even know how you probably thousands and thousands of them little stickers yeah have faith I got two things in my wallet that stay in my wallet at all time it's the $2 bill that you gave me and the sticker that says have faith and that is that stays in my wallet no matter no matter what I got that in the back of my phone I give them out and it opens doors that you don't even know that opens when I pass them out cuz I don't we were at the airport the other day in Idaho Go Minneapolis and this lady come up to Jenifer she says what kind of religion are you we said we're Christians what you know and she looked holy you know she you know she was clean and neat and I give her that half face s and then there's a g ahead of us in the airplane she discovered him an operation and she was she was sucking air she wasn't doing very good she was I gave her one of the little stickers and she give me the thumb sign in the airport she said she turned her phone and she said see I got it right here she had it on her phone already but you never know you know you never know who you touch and things like that that's I'm just crazy that way and different things I mean shouldn't have say crazy but I just if I feel led to do it I do it for sure and you that's how you've lived your life really yeah they wonder why I do things yeah but that's what I do that's how I you know that's how I've been you know uh what's the story about your grandfather and uh the bu uh bevil my graa words Helman wz follow brother Bram way back he was one of the first ones here and uh he come to brother brandom and he told him he had a dream but the devil was after him and the devil kept going coming after him and getting bigger and bigger and he just said boo boo it got smaller and smaller and smaller and he he mentions that in one of his servants right yeah yeah he talks about that that was my grandpa yeah and I I wanted to get that out there because I didn't know if anybody actually I mean I know a lot of people that know you know that story but just so they can have that connection yeah that was and my grandpa he was a he was a True Believer he was he would travel yeah he was he was a praying man he was a he was quite a guy do you remember being in any of brother brand oh yeah I was in me Phoenix we used to go to Phoenix we come we'd travel up there' be about 12 14 of us in a pickup and we'd eat hamburgers on the way home that's how one of the things I remember we order 40 hamburgers and it we laid at night cuz we're were coming home up in Phoenix it always at the reman cuz that's when when D would go down there in the winter time it be January meetings there the remm and what what was some of the service that like does anything like did anything really stick out to you in any of the services that you can remember nothing else no but I was in the service when brother Brandon was at the Tabernacle his last service oh really yeah I was in those last service when you did communion wow I was there did that service feel any different yeah that was quite a service cuz I was sitting on the front row normally I'm not in to sit around the front row I'm not a front row guy in church I'm the back row left hand or right hand side but brother R was there and he had communion and and he preached a little bit but I was there on a Wednesday night at Tucson Tabernacle and uh brother Bron was sitting in the middle of the church there and brother green said anybody want to give a testimony brother Brown was the first one just jumped right on the seat I will I always want to be the first and brother G kind of jumped back it was kind of I was sit there in the right side in the back my folks and that's I remember that brother Brown was at Wednesday night service so that's I remember that as well I'm on the tape where brother green I mean brother Bram says I'm glad you got this church here so them boys don't ride their bicycles on Sunday morning that was me that was me it says I didn't know that yeah so that was me um what what was now you were born in Minnesota though right yeah we from Minnesota and then you moved to Arizona yeah now 64 now why did y'all move there was it my dad was going to work with brother Brandon so that's what yeah yeah now what was it what do you remember when your dad came back and didn't have that cancer spot on his ear anymore like do you remember like he didn't say a word to us really he didn't say a word to us well he just Brown didn't tell him till he heard it on tape really yes I didn't realize that okay I'm pretty sure that's the way it was he didn't he he did wow I that's amazing yeah I mean it's yeah quickening Power for sure so so we're we go back with brother Brandon way back I mean brother y'all's families were really close I mean yeah sister Brandon lived at our house on copper when they come back from the accident okay and they stayed at our house and copper lived there for a year and a half or so and uh yeah that's we I knew the family Sarah and Becky and and you're still close to the family yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm close and we talk quite often so but he's a good friend I wouldn't spoil her friendship for yeah you know for sure and he he's uh he's got a lot of pressure on it just remember Brother Joseph cuz he's got everybody pulling and running from every direction front back sideways upside down I mean it's it's tough I mean you get that pressure there but Brother Brad was really humble he wrote in our Bibles and then December he my mother gave us Bibles to brother R up sign them really yeah I guess you probably still have that I still got the Bible yeah I didn't getting tattered I got to get somebody to fix the Bible what was St John 524 what he left me wellow it I that's pretty special yeah that was and I was probably the last one to see him before they got they left that next day I took over a bag of lemons cuz we had a lemon tree was just loaded that year and I took it over to the house and brother brand I talked to him I give him the lemons cuz everybody was gone and see brother Brandman talked to him in a Park Avenue in this place where he see there was two apartments there in Park Avenue the kids stayed at one side brother Brown sister Brown stay on the other side they cooked on the one side and brother Brown had his office on the one side and did anything seem different about him that last day you saw him or uh no he was just getting ready to go just just getting ready like just normal day yeah yeah it was kind of cloudy and rainy a little Misty you know cuz we left the same time we w we were going to Florida with my f folks and they were going that way and uh so and I was when I got to news it was tough yeah yeah it was tough were you with Brother Joseph and then when when you found out or no no they were out they were on the trip that's right I'm they were in the rep there I'm sorry I don't know why I was no no but uh yeah that was quite a tragedy yeah yeah but you know you hear different story but we seen the I seen the car I mean it was like I said everything happened for reason you never know you know yeah that is definitely one of the circumstances where you just got to you know yeah it's Ty ofon yep y everything you know you shake your head on a lot of things but that's just the way it is I mean that's way life is one day maybe we'll understand it when we you know get to heaven maybe we won't but the Lord had a proud care for yeah he's you know he's got to laid out for sure you know Jennifer and I always always said this you know the Lord's will you know whatever we do that's one thing I got I got a great wife you got it let's talk about how how did you and sister jennif oh you don't want to go back that far oh no yeah I do whoa boy She chased me Mighty hard did she I can imagine no she didn't like me at all cuz I gave her a hard time but she's been a great wife she's been good like got good kids i' been lost of that's tough yeah but Lord's will be done for a reason but you know everything goes on you know in life uh it's interesting people though you know you around H many you see different people what they do and what they try to do you know but but there's good people and know what I always said I don't care where you go to church just go to church MH you know you want to go to brother shirs that's great if you want to go to whatever I don't care it don't matter to me just go there and shake hands you know be a brother you know put your arm around if they need something go help them there's so much like fighting between the churches and stuff nowadays and it's just sad it's stupid because the at the end I mean especially around you know the message churches because you're everybody believes the same thing I mean well there still yeah and it's it's just sad that there's got to be so much Division and fighting amongst the churches yeah that's re they wanted Harmony because I done 10 churches or 12 churches in tuca when he started that I didn't like that yeah that's one reason I did it you know is that one of the reasons why you did it in Arizona yeah yeah yeah cuz I was down there yeah I went to an auction and the one brother would even talk to me because I went to Brother Green's church now how stupid is that and we're still going to church I mean we're going to go we're trying to go the same place I mean really give me a break you know I shouldn't say it that way but but and no I mean it's the truth you know I mean it's it's sad to you know have situations like that yeah it's but it's way life is people are funny and they they for a reason still so and sometimes you can't figure out the reasons and and it's just that's for sure maybe you'll understand it one day one thing about Tucson they got a lot of things going there they got Sabo yeah you know a lot yeah a lot of that's got a lot of lot of character there I mean I take care of you but they got a lot of things there Eagle Rock and stuff and some and uh Sunset you know yeah so I mean it's and people that come in for harmony enjoy going and right hikes up there and seeing all that stuff because I mean it's important for sure man she the den yeah I was up there when they did the I was up there when they were building that my dad helped build that the walls and stuff okay I think I've only been in there one time but it was I went with brother George Smith he took us in there oh and it was with sister grade Mr gra went with us yeah and uh that was the only time i' had ever been in it that was pretty special yeah I if you can you know if anybody has a chance to go in it I'd definitely recommend it it's pretty amazing yeah Steven's got it open there does he yeah Steven Smith George's son and he's got it there and so they'll welcome you yeah it's definitely a beautiful oh it's thing to look at brother brat laid that out you knew that first yeah he laid that the way he wanted it okay I did not know that yeah yeah wow appr will you just tell me when and how like you got saved and baptized and where it was at and stuff I believe it I got saved on a Tucson Tabernacle brother brand when he was probably communion I was there and I was having a tough time I'll be honest with I was crying and and uh took communion and uh that's probably when I was 13 years old you know and then I got baptized in Smo Canyon what two years later or the K baptized me in Sabino the water in the water you baptized in Sabino yeah so you said well there's a pool right there when you go across the road there and that's where I got baptized at well so when since you were so young when brother Bam passed away and stuff uh what was it like when after you passed away and you started growing up listening to the message and studying and stuff what kind of effect did that have on you you know well I was going to high school there in Tad I was uh ampai Sarah was going there his daughter Sarah and uh so that I knew was right and wrong so I didn't do anything with the I I worked when I was a kid I mean I I I'd hire 10 kids at from church and we I did a lot of things pained houses move furniture Brother Joseph helped me cuz I he was he wanted to be part of the kids and you know and I I made him work I just be honest with you he wanted to if you wanted me to pay him he had it work but we did that I did that for years with the kids and you know brother brandom I was we they have special meetings brother green used to have christas meetings there and you know and people would come in and I remember when the Believers first come there Tucson that year that's kind of where the Christian music I mean the gospel music for the B they the Believers from Canada and I remember them guys going on the trip and they come to our house before they left that next day and that's I got good friends with them Brother Art and brother minow I'm still good friends with them to this day and they and that's a lot of their music is there you know singing that and and that that was you know I was uh church it was different and then I remember the kids 77 I graduated 1970 but they heard of the tape that 1977 the world is going to come to an end M Nam kids are getting married like unbelievable young kids yeah 15 16 thought they had to get married and some of them are still together a lot of them aren't and I I think that was wrong but that's hindsight I always say that's 1010 but you know that was part of the deal there that that was 1977 when everybody thought they should go they had to get married yeah they want to have kids before they could you know and that's that's one thing that was struck me a lot you know I look at things I look back to the message and that we were going have meetings and travel to different meetings around we I remember going to Christmas meeting we went to uh in December I think it was 1960 when brother Brown preached at Christmas meeting at Jeff we went back there for Christmas meeting and he passed out candy at church brother brandom did he preached a service there and passed out candy to the little kids in church I remember going to that meeting I remember that one cuz I thought that was really interesting to go to that and we went to Brother sop man's house to uh for Christmas lunch you know we were there at Christmas so uh do you have any stories that you can share about you and brother green or something that sticks out to you about brother green yeah brother green he was quite a guy I mean going to singing him and my dad are big guys and they'd always argue who who weighed the most who was worth more brother green or my dad I mean they did that all the time and uh so your dad your dad and brother green were pretty close oh they were really they were the best of friend they were the best of friends okay I did not realiz we see we were there we weren't there that Sunday morning when the when brother green opened the church in Tucson but we were there every every since then really yeah my brother my dad always felt sorry for brother green cuz brother green did a lot for everybody I mean he did the he did the telephone interviews and he did Brother green did more behind the scenes than people give him credit for but he wasn't brother green was very worthful he he was he wanted it done he got it done yeah you know and uh he was he was a good man brother the great was a good man he was good uh I used to go to church there and I could sit i' sit in the back and watch the church and I could tell him what was going on of his church and I'd go tell him that and he quized me how do you know that I said brother green I just telling you this is the way it is so I would do that with him I'd go back to his office he always had the office back there I go sit there before church quizy talk to him and that's how I did that I did that many times my wife wondered where was at but that's where was at so how when did you move back to Minnesota Minnesota 73 when I got married you know what happens when you get married you do what she says yes sir you all qu qu well you know the Lord's been good to me back there so I can you know it's been really good for me there a businessman go and so that's the reason we know what I mean uh you have a pretty interesting story and I remember you called me on the phone and told me about it when it happened about a singer that you ran into at a restaurant we were brother Josiah AO M the AOS let's go back to AOS they come to Harmony with their dad mhm and I did in the harmony I don't know these people I don't know people that come to Harmony I mean I don't know if you know I don't I didn't know people like you folk when you guys come I didn't yeah you can tell me who they are I don't matter to me you know that's what I did I mean I didn't care you could sing great yeah you can't get rid of us oh maybe I can but maybe the AOS come down and they call me and brother AO quizzing me a lot what do you do this and do this hey man you don't know me what do you want can we sing this many S I say whatever I lead whatever I do this is how I do it well we we got a couple songs we made up and we like to do and I and I I push back in that stuff I mean I don't you don't you any push me into this that's how I am and they come down and they become really good friends they come over to where you met his wife they come to we had a little Harmony and uh I don't want to yeah during Co wasn't it wasn't it that to co no no we went to Phoenix at Co with the brother Garcia we went there that fall take it was Thanksgiving and they come over there and then one car quit and the other they had trouble with the other thing and they could get there but that's where Josiah's met his his wife and I told Jennifer I says man the Sparks are flying out there tonight with them too they're really fine and that's how they got together there but they come down and Josiah's so we didn't go to their wedding they invited us to wedding but it was just December was just a wrong time to try to get there to Tucson they would have had the week earlier we could have made it but they couldn't do that CU somebody did something but like I said everything happens well anyway uh we took him out to eat at Sunday after church and we went to cheddar and we were walking out this gentleman was standing outside there with a suit on and and I'm crazy enough and said morning sir and always say morning CU you got to look at the bright side he said I like your attitude I said yeah that's good he said what do you do I said I don't have he said what are I said what do you do he said I'm gospel singer I said really I said your gospel I just said we just had a little Harmony over here singing oh really and then I said then Josiah's walked out cuz he went to the restaurant and we were standing outside the cers there I mean Cheddars and we started talking and I invited him church at night and uh and he come and he sang and in two sept and they're good to me they understand Mr word and he got to say I said he's going to can he sing tonight they go let one song I said no two and they were blowed away how good he sing he was a good singer really Jeremiah Brown uh I really I looked him up when you told me the first yeah yeah well that's where we met and you never know and then we Barber my sister she said yeah right so they sang at a little at a a retirement Hall that's what he does in the winter time he sings at retirement homeall for the El so he said Barbie you want to go over and hear him yeah okay so we went over and my brother-in-law come with him with us because because he he did the he was a building inspector for or Valley so he want he wanted to see that building cuz he was a building inspector for 35 years or so we went there and we went out to eat afterwards we go to Mud mudpie or whatever it was called and uh their car blew up his car blew up that night so he had to get a record and I gave him my car that I had in Tucson to drive for a week or 10 days really you told me didn't even know the Gap you tell me I was like you didn't know you're like no it don't matter that's you know when you when you feel led to do it you do it that's what I'm telling you in things that's how you do it so we let him use the car and got good friends and I mean he'd come to church again and sang again so are you still in contact with him at all or I wish I was I tried to call him but he him and his wife split up oh after that 40 some years really yeah sad yeah that's crazy sad this is my 50th anniversary for my wife so unbelievable when is your anniversary I was going to it was August 28th same like yesterday what long time it's a long time for her to put up with me put up with me yeah yeah you a kidding but that's yeah that's good so I mean that's what happened there but that was that was quite a deal you never know when you touch somebody like that and you got it and I gave him one them half Bas stickers you know that's what it was you've started a lot of conversations with them yeah it just opens the door and them stickers just opens the door and I pass them out all the time I'm not I give a guy a day two of them I remember you gave a stack of them to Mom to hand out here when she where I don't remember where they saw Oh Sister Green Funeral yeah sister green F yeah had a lot of a lot of people wanted them yeah so yeah they're great they're great they're just they just open up you never know one sure you see somebody's you never know Faith Like a mustard seed I mean yeah everybody knows that too yeah he say it's a mustard seed yeah they say faith like the Bible say faith like it must receive that's the little things you do in life you know not the big things you know sure and that's what I look at you don't have to do the big things you have to be the best singer just go to church and pray for everybody and you know yeah some people can sing some people can't some people can do you know people can lay block some people can't you know and life that's just the way life is for sure why I was a president of the turf Association we had some tough times here and U I got to be president president which I did want but they had some tough times and I said I'll come back I'll be the vice president but I'm not going to be the secretary treasure I ain't doing that stupid trick I ain't doing that I ain't going to get to figure out the checkbook of that I ain't doing that I'll be the president vice president and then work up to president so my president I uh so we're going open meeting with a prayer I'm the president I could do what I want and we opened her with with a prayer and I got more thank yous for doing that than anything else I did when I was a president wow and they've done it every since the the guys that we have brought the guy that got on the board they I I think 90% of them I think I think most of them open on prayer wow that's awesome so that's just you know yeah you just because they know they see you know we stand out Jennifer and I stand out she stands out more than I do being a woman wearing a dress all the time you know we they don't we don't drink we don't party yeah they know we just do our thing and and they know how are you pitter patter let's get at it that's how I am and the thing and they know that and they respect that you know so they they respect that so that's what they do so that's that's how I I did it prayer that's awesome are you still the vice president no no you only get you're a ter oh yeah so um the only thing I would ask you to do is would you mind say in a prayer I like to get the guest to pray over just pray over the audience and um but I also it kind of has become like the I won't say Trend but I ask a lot of people at the end of every podcast if you have something that you could say to the younger generation um some advice or anything that you would have for the younger generation what would it be I always tell the kids if you get down and out just give me a call just give me a call I'd rather you call me than go to your funeral CU I tell you what things are tough tough enough but they're not that tough because you don't know if you do something crazy you don't get a second chance and you don't know how many lives you touch I always like the movie It's a Wonderful Life cuz I look at that and watch that how that was if you weren't here what would happen if you weren't here and I look at that cuz if I wasn't here this wouldn't have happened when they got married or this or that you know and or whatever where you meet some somebody you know you you just that I look at that cuz I watch that movie and that I look at that really it touches me I'll be honest with you because if you would have done this I couldn't have done that you know my whatever you know that's what I look at with the kids kids if you ever get down and even adults if you ever just give me a call just give me a call my phone's out all the time he's got Joshua's got my number just call him and give you my number and that's fine cuz I don't give my number out and if I call you it'll be no caller ID and that and you're not just saying that you really do mean that cuz I remember the first or second year I was at Harmony and we were getting ready to do the choir yep you got up I mean there was probably aund or something 100 or so kids maybe a couple more and you got out there and said if you ever need me call me and someone said well what if we don't have your number and you they said get ready and you gave I got myund and something kids and I had one girl call me so you never know and it may have and you may have done that just for that one girl yes yeah but like I always said if he gets somebody on your mind call them yeah do that cuz you just don't know what you're going to do when you touch somebody sure yeah little girl got in trouble you know Harmony last year or was it two years ago I had her sing a couple times and they said what you doing that you know they kind of you know they kind of quiz you yeah but that girl always going through some troubles and uh she had in trouble and uh she come back to Lord but I mean you just never know you know I I just uh and uh like the MC's for harmony you know I never picked him till I you know I I I I would sit there and think about it like I had a couple of them do a couple three or four times in a row and my brother used to critique me all time hey what do you got that guy doing for what are you doing this for you know but it's easier said and done if you're not there yeah you know but I give people Liberty when they when they do things you know you got to do you got to have faith you got to have that faith in things like that so but I'm truly telling you kids if you get trouble give Joshua a call you'll give you my phone number it's on like I said I'll call you back cuz it's I'm serious on that because You' never know kids have a tough time they got that crazy phone and there's things in there you know I mean sure it's hady to have a phone I've had a phone phone for 40 some years so but I uh cell phone but it's just uh it's just the way you abuse things and do that thing so you know just the way you overlook things too yes sir for sure you like say a little blessing yes sir would you mind praying here de gracious Heavenly Father we come to you this evening and Lord thank you for Joshua on his
