[0:00] our Messiah our Lord when he said you
[0:03] got to get this straight you religious
[0:06] Crooks when you've seen
[0:10] me well I said we want to see the father
[0:13] he said I've been with you all this
[0:17] time ain't that interesting he said you
[0:21] you've had him with you the whole time
[0:23] and you've refused to see him because
[0:26] you wanted him to be an old man with
[0:29] white hair and a and a gavel sitting on
[0:31] a judge's bench or you wanted him to be
[0:35] some ethereal cloud or you wanted him to
[0:38] look like this or that or the other so
[0:40] when he came in a body of Flesh you
[0:43] didn't even know who he was you students
[0:47] of the law you religious Hypocrites you
[0:50] didn't even know him when he walked
[0:53] among
[0:54] you no wonder he said you're nothing
[0:57] more than whed supplers but on the
[1:00] inside your Graves full of dead men's
[1:04] bones your religion is going to damn you
[1:08] because you fail to see the truth it
[1:12] stands before you come on there's only
[1:16] one scripture in the Bible that even
[1:17] mentions the three other than the titles
[1:20] and that's a scripture that says there
[1:22] are three that bear record in heaven I
[1:24] have no problem with that that's the
[1:26] word says the Father the word and the
[1:29] spirit
[1:30] father son Spirit father word spirit and
[1:34] don't forget you folks now trying to
[1:36] talk us out of the Oneness of God don't
[1:38] forget the rest of the
[1:40] scripture somebody said but there was a
[1:43] voice and somebody said there was a dove
[1:45] and somebody said who was he praying
[1:49] to it's so easy to get caught up in
[1:53] craziness but the rest of that verse
[1:56] said and these three are three
[2:01] [Music]
[2:03] no these three are
[2:05] one you've got three different Offices
[2:08] here you've got three different
[2:09] manifestations here but in the end
[2:11] there's only one Spirit if we've got
[2:14] more than one Spirit to worship I'm very
[2:18] confused with what the scripture teaches
[2:20] there's one Jesus had a father so man
[2:24] said who was the father and the church
[2:26] says the
[2:28] father but the Bible didn't say
[2:31] that the Bible said and the Holy
[2:34] Ghost overshadowed
[2:37] Mary and she conceived the Lord Jesus
[2:40] Christ so who is the father of the Lord
[2:44] Jesus Christ the Holy
[2:46] Ghost then how could there not be two
[2:49] because there's only one spirit in the
[2:51] first place according to the scripture
[2:53] the ministry is different the office is
[2:57] different the administration may be
[2:59] different but here oh
[3:04] Israel the Lord our God is one go why
[3:07] don't you have a crucifix on here
[3:09] because for any of you that don't know
[3:11] the
[3:14] news he ain't on the
[3:21] [Music]
[3:23] cross somebody said where is he in
[3:25] heaven no
[3:30] Hallelujah I know where Jesus is he's
[3:34] living in his wife he's living and
[3:39] breathing and moving in his
[3:43] bride he's the same yesterday today and
[3:50] forever he's not a historical
[3:54] document he's a living reality
[4:03] sir
