[18:31] [Music]
[18:44] the service at all but I want us to go
[18:46] to the Lord in prayer because we just
[18:48] had an emergency note to come in from
[18:51] Brother Cliff Hall's that Naomi is not
[18:54] doing well at all and they are thinking
[18:57] about putting her in a coma so that they
[19:00] can force more air into her lungs
[19:04] I know you all don't know this and we
[19:06] don't tell everybody's business I don't
[19:08] even know if her extended family knows
[19:11] this but she and her husband yoris who
[19:14] live in the Netherlands are faithful
[19:17] streamers
[19:18] and not only are they faithful streamers
[19:20] they are faithful to pay their tithe
[19:23] and I believe that God can move for
[19:26] Naomi
[19:27] and I want us just to go to the Lord in
[19:29] prayer and ask for a miracle for her
[19:32] that God would just give her a great
[19:35] healing today Father in the name of
[19:39] Jesus Lord we lift up our sister Naomi
[19:43] to you
[19:45] to the best of her ability she has
[19:49] remained true to the message that you
[19:53] have sent
[19:54] and she is leading her children and with
[19:58] her husband they have made a stand for
[20:02] your word and they are faithful Lord to
[20:06] support the work of this house
[20:10] Lord I know that that doesn't mean much
[20:14] in this world but in the Kingdom to keep
[20:18] Covenant with you is of Great Value and
[20:22] I'm asking you on their behalf that you
[20:26] would stand Lord in intercession for her
[20:30] need right now Lord she's in that very
[20:35] precarious place right on the edge and
[20:39] the doctors feel they need to sedate her
[20:42] to put more air flow into her lungs and
[20:47] Lord we know the dangers that go along
[20:50] with that so we are declaring according
[20:54] to your word that with your stripes
[20:58] Naomi is healed in the name of Jesus
[21:02] that you would reach into that hospital
[21:05] room today
[21:08] and give her a Miracle of Miracles
[21:14] drive back the hand of the enemy
[21:18] and loose her from the infirmity that
[21:22] has tried to take her body oh for her
[21:25] children for her husband we pray for her
[21:29] parents for her family we lift them up
[21:32] to you right now may Faith prevail

[52:08] um good morning I wanted to give a brief
[52:10] testimony of everything that's been
[52:13] going on in my family as far as my mom
[52:14] on November 11th I got a phone call when
[52:18] I was at work and it was my mom she was
[52:20] headed to the hospital and with a pretty
[52:22] severe break in her leg and she told me
[52:26] that she would have to have emergency
[52:27] surgery
[52:28] and at that moment everything changed
[52:30] because she was the second caregiver for
[52:32] my grandmother who was bed bound so I
[52:35] didn't know what to do
[52:36] and I just cried and so I went on and I
[52:39] said you know what lord I can't do
[52:40] anything now that evening the doctor
[52:43] called me with a report as to what was
[52:45] going on he said that she had a pretty
[52:47] severe break her ankle shattered into
[52:49] three pieces
[52:50] and that due to the break and the skin
[52:54] was broken and she was in a stable that
[52:57] it is potential that she could lose her
[52:58] leg
[53:00] um at least below the knee and
[53:03] at that moment I almost just lost it I
[53:07] didn't know what to say or do
[53:09] and God is so faithful because the sweet
[53:11] presence of the Lord came and just
[53:14] rushed in like a mighty Russian wave and
[53:16] peace fell over me and he just whispered
[53:19] into my heart she's not going to lose
[53:21] her leg
[53:23] and I said to the doctor sir I thank you
[53:26] for everything you've done for my mom I
[53:29] thank you for what you're doing but God
[53:31] is her healer and I know he will hear
[53:34] heal her and I stand here today to tell
[53:36] you that when the report came from the
[53:38] nurse or the the front receptionist she
[53:41] said ma'am I want you to know it is a
[53:44] miracle you kept your leg so God is the
[53:47] same any promise you have just know he's
[53:51] going to meet it he's the same God

[1:04:00] the brightness of the Moon last night
[1:04:03] man can't do that
[1:04:06] it's above the natural

[1:04:25] the changing of the seasons
[1:04:28] all of these things that look so natural
[1:04:30] to us
[1:04:33] it's by the hand of God that they were
[1:04:35] created
[1:04:40] Supernatural
[1:04:44] and God continues to do Supernatural
[1:04:47] things
[1:04:49] that are not as common to us
[1:04:53] and we praise him for it

[1:10:52] taking you a while to get back and get
[1:10:54] settled in and we're glad to see you in
[1:10:57] the house of the Lord today is
[1:11:00] uh the anniversary of a
[1:11:03] fairly substantial manifestation
[1:11:08] of God's Supernatural power
[1:11:11] that took place just one generation ago
[1:11:15] in 1961
[1:11:18] brother Branham had been teaching on the
[1:11:21] church ages
[1:11:23] and uh from from the first few chapters
[1:11:26] of the Book of Revelation he had been
[1:11:29] going over those with the people
[1:11:32] and on January the 8th
[1:11:35] 1961 in a sermon that
[1:11:38] he called Throne of mercy and judgment
[1:11:41] but it is now called I think Revelation
[1:11:45] chapter four part three
[1:11:49] and uh
[1:11:51] there was a pillar of fire that came
[1:11:53] into the building
[1:11:55] and there had been a drawing on the
[1:11:57] board of the phases of the Moon
[1:12:01] and how that it had uh waned as it came
[1:12:05] toward laodicea until there was just a
[1:12:09] tiny sliver of light
[1:12:12] and we have photographs of when the pope
[1:12:15] was visiting I think it was Jerusalem
[1:12:17] and they took a picture of the phases of
[1:12:19] the moon that looked very similar to
[1:12:21] what had been drawn out on the board but
[1:12:24] the Holy Spirit came and the pillar of
[1:12:26] fire came the supernatural presence of
[1:12:29] God came and copied
[1:12:33] what was written on the board now talk
[1:12:35] about vindication if if if the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost were to come and take my notes and
[1:12:40] ride them on that wall over there I'm
[1:12:41] telling that'd be Vindication and so the
[1:12:44] pillar of fire just came and wrote on
[1:12:47] the wall the exact drawing that had been
[1:12:51] up there of the phases of the moon well
[1:12:52] the people screamed
[1:12:54] and brother Branham rebuked them if
[1:12:57] you'll go back and listen to the tape
[1:12:58] you'll hear brother Brandon bringing
[1:13:00] correction to him he said no no no
[1:13:02] that's not it
[1:13:04] it's there
[1:13:06] and what he went on to explain was they
[1:13:09] were moved by a reflection
[1:13:13] what they were seeing was a reflection
[1:13:15] of what God had drawn on the wall now
[1:13:18] that is a lesson for us
[1:13:20] because we can get excited over
[1:13:21] something that's only a reflection we've
[1:13:24] got to look to find the real where's the
[1:13:25] real in here see and that's what he
[1:13:28] taught the people is powerful and uh he
[1:13:31] said so so he pointed out to them he
[1:13:33] said it's there he pointed to them the
[1:13:36] real Pillar of Fire that was hanging in
[1:13:39] the room he said some were looking at
[1:13:41] the reflection and then it began to move
[1:13:43] over people's heads through the audience
[1:13:46] and sister Gladys Dowd was there in that
[1:13:49] meeting and she screamed she's one of
[1:13:52] the voices that you will hear scream did
[1:13:54] anybody get to meet sister Gladys Dowd
[1:13:57] am I the only one in here sister Weems
[1:14:00] got to meet her did anybody else well
[1:14:02] brother West was with me and he's gone
[1:14:04] to be with the Lord but maybe someone
[1:14:07] else was with me but I don't remember
[1:14:08] who now
[1:14:10] sister Terrell I think maybe sister
[1:14:12] Terrell was with us but we got to go and
[1:14:15] meet sister Gladys Dowd and she told us
[1:14:18] this story of what it felt like when she
[1:14:21] saw with her own eyes the pillar of fire
[1:14:24] come and vindicate the truth there on
[1:14:27] the wall now talk about being
[1:14:29] life-changing
[1:14:31] and is that as that cloud began I mean
[1:14:33] excuse me as that fire began to move
[1:14:35] over people's heads brother Brandon
[1:14:37] began to call out names and diseases and
[1:14:40] cities where people were from because of
[1:14:43] the presence of that light and those of
[1:14:45] you that have read the Supernatural
[1:14:47] series written by brother Owen Jorgensen
[1:14:50] in book six it mentions that sister
[1:14:54] Gladys down was in the service and that
[1:14:57] she was one of the ones screaming on the
[1:14:59] tape and she saw it with her own eyes
[1:15:03] and what happened was the light began to
[1:15:07] wane and wax in front of them until it
[1:15:11] matched they watched the light on the
[1:15:15] phases of the moon began to change
[1:15:17] before their eyes until it matched
[1:15:20] exactly what was written on the board
[1:15:22] and you know that is a very powerful
[1:15:25] thing a powerful thing and today is the
[1:15:28] anniversary of that I like what brother
[1:15:31] Greely said today he's still a
[1:15:34] supernatural God I are you with me
[1:15:38] he's still a supernatural God and if it
[1:15:41] would be his mind he can come he doesn't
[1:15:43] vindicate Prophets
[1:15:45] he vindicates his word and by doing so
[1:15:49] the prophet's Ministry of course and the
[1:15:51] truth that he brought is Vindicated to
[1:15:53] us but if God was all the time
[1:15:55] vindicating me and we would look to men
[1:15:59] but he vindicates his word brother
[1:16:01] Branham even told us that the man can be
[1:16:04] false and the anointing can be genuine
[1:16:09] now you know that's really something if
[1:16:12] you don't understand that you go and
[1:16:14] listen to the message anointed ones at
[1:16:16] the end time and he'll explain it to you
[1:16:18] because in in Pentecost we used to think
[1:16:22] if a man was anointed he must be close
[1:16:25] to God
[1:16:26] then we found out he was running off
[1:16:29] with the piano player
[1:16:31] or touching boys just being honest
[1:16:35] we saw all kinds of things happen
[1:16:37] divorce his wife and married two or
[1:16:39] three more and he'd been used of God and
[1:16:41] revealed Secrets told people their names
[1:16:43] done all kinds of things because the
[1:16:47] gift that was in his life was a genuine
[1:16:49] gift and the anointing was falling on
[1:16:52] that gift when the man himself was not
[1:16:55] genuine
[1:16:56] so we want to know we want to know that
[1:16:59] this truth can produce a life among us
[1:17:02] I'm telling you it can
[1:17:04] it can cause us to line up with the word
[1:17:08] Hallelujah
[1:17:10] amen did you all have a good night last
[1:17:12] night
[1:17:13] I know there was a lot going on there
[1:17:15] was a terrible accident there on the
[1:17:18] Bleecker Junction a connection there is
[1:17:21] at 169 what is that what
[1:17:24] 250 on both sides is it 250
[1:17:28] where 250 connects there at Bleecker
[1:17:31] Junction terrible car accident they tell
[1:17:33] me there was a loss of a life there and
[1:17:36] power was out ours was off for just a
[1:17:39] few minutes but some of you didn't get
[1:17:41] power till after midnight on this side
[1:17:43] of 250. you know that'll really mess you
[1:17:46] up won't it it'll change things doing
[1:17:49] without power but God helps us
[1:17:53] he helps us and we we have one worry
[1:17:56] ward in our house only one and she was
[1:17:59] quite disturbed about different things
[1:18:01] and the power going out and and just
[1:18:04] just really messing up life for us and I
[1:18:07] said we're just gonna have to start
[1:18:08] praising the Lord so I just made up a
[1:18:10] song much to her
[1:18:12] horror
[1:18:14] and I just started singing even with the
[1:18:17] lights off you know we're just going to
[1:18:20] praise the Lord
[1:18:22] it wasn't long before they came on
[1:18:25] he's good and he's God he's God in all
[1:18:30] of those circumstances and that's just a
[1:18:33] you know that's just a little
[1:18:34] inconvenience but my we will certainly
[1:18:38] face more serious things than that in
[1:18:42] the course of the next few years so we
[1:18:44] want our life to be focused on him
[1:18:47] and we want to be standing for the truth
[1:18:49] of the word of God
[1:18:51] how many of you understand that I also
[1:18:54] understand that today is an anniversary
[1:18:56] for sister Beth Polk how many years ago
[1:19:00] five years ago

[1:19:06] torn aorta is that right

[1:19:12] people have died with the with a tear in
[1:19:15] their aorta bleeding out from the inside
[1:19:17] and she died on the table and God gave
[1:19:21] her her life back and added five years

[1:27:18] thank you
[1:27:20] thank you to the musicians
[1:27:23] Hebrews chapter 4.
[1:27:39] so I was kind of trying to see
[1:27:43] what kind of night you had in in your
[1:27:46] sleep
[1:27:48] mine was a very unusual night last night
[1:27:51] and I've been up for quite a while now
[1:27:54] and there were many many dreams
[1:27:58] many many spiritual dreams and some
[1:28:01] experiences
[1:28:03] I don't know how much of it we'll share
[1:28:05] this morning but uh it's it's powerful
[1:28:08] to think about
[1:28:10] this is going to be a year of the
[1:28:12] supernatural
[1:28:14] and a year of divine recovery
[1:28:17] and so we're we're believing that we
[1:28:20] will recover all
[1:28:22] how many of you are believing to recover
[1:28:24] all in your life that the enemy has
[1:28:28] stolen squandered
[1:28:30] thieved away packed away
[1:28:33] he's the original kleptomaniac
[1:28:37] the thief that word thief in the Greek
[1:28:39] is klepties
[1:28:41] he is the original kleptomaniac what
[1:28:44] good does your health do him yet he
[1:28:47] likes to steal your health
[1:28:49] he likes to take your finances what good
[1:28:52] do they do the devil he doesn't need
[1:28:53] money to do his job he just takes them
[1:28:56] for the thrill of you not having it
[1:28:59] but when you catch him in the act you
[1:29:02] don't just demand that he pay back what
[1:29:04] he stole but you demand that he give
[1:29:07] that seventh portion that he give
[1:29:09] reconciliation on top of the recompense
[1:29:13] and so that's what we're believing for
[1:29:15] not just restoration but we're believing
[1:29:17] for restitution
[1:29:20] that he has to give back more than he's
[1:29:22] taken from our lives and this is a year
[1:29:25] of such Divine recovery so so don't dare
[1:29:29] sell yourself short
[1:29:31] if I should share any portion of last
[1:29:35] night with you it would be this uh he
[1:29:38] reminded me of Esther
[1:29:41] and how that she had to see herself in
[1:29:45] the vision she had to see herself in the
[1:29:49] program of God
[1:29:51] she didn't see what a difference she
[1:29:53] could make
[1:29:54] Mordecai is talking to her she doesn't
[1:29:57] see what kind of a difference that she's
[1:30:00] going to be able to make in the plight
[1:30:02] of the Jewish people because she
[1:30:04] remember she had been hiding who she was
[1:30:08] Stay With Me
[1:30:10] I'm not even preaching yet
[1:30:12] she she had been hiding her true
[1:30:14] identity like some of you been doing
[1:30:18] she didn't want anybody to know really
[1:30:20] who she was and Mordecai began to talk
[1:30:23] to her and he said you know you're going
[1:30:25] to have to let it be known who you are
[1:30:27] you're going to have to stand up for
[1:30:29] your people
[1:30:30] and he said how do we know that that you
[1:30:33] were brought to the kingdom
[1:30:37] for such a time as this
[1:30:40] and I want you to know the bride is
[1:30:42] Awakening for such a time as this
[1:30:46] because she's going to make a difference
[1:30:48] in the world around her yes she's
[1:30:51] pushing back the darkness to manifest
[1:30:54] who he is
[1:30:56] the light of Lights
[1:30:58] he said I am the way the truth and the
[1:31:01] life he also said I am the light of the
[1:31:04] world
[1:31:05] and we know that a city on a hill cannot
[1:31:08] be hid
[1:31:09] and so as it has been said it's our time
[1:31:12] to shine and we want to see ourself in
[1:31:15] the vision
[1:31:17] the enemy wants you not to be able to
[1:31:19] see yourself in the vision well what
[1:31:22] difference could I make and you're going
[1:31:25] to have to make a conscious effort this
[1:31:27] year to place yourself in the vision
[1:31:31] if you're part of the Bride then the
[1:31:33] bride's inheritance is your inheritance
[1:31:35] so you place yourself in the vision of
[1:31:39] the bride's future
[1:31:40] you do that by faith this is a new age
[1:31:43] imagery this isn't imagining we're not
[1:31:45] drawing a vision board or a dream board
[1:31:48] or something like they teach people to
[1:31:50] do in in in network marketing that's not
[1:31:54] what we're talking about we're talking
[1:31:56] about discovering what the bride's
[1:31:58] purpose is and then placing yourself
[1:32:00] there instead of disqualifying yourself
[1:32:04] you need to qualify yourself and
[1:32:07] understand that his blood has perfected
[1:32:09] you
[1:32:10] that's how I know you're perfect for the
[1:32:12] job
[1:32:13] because the blood made you that way
[1:32:16] now you people that don't entertain the
[1:32:18] word but twice a week you're never going
[1:32:21] to make it
[1:32:23] you're never going to overcome I can
[1:32:26] tell you that right now my three hours a
[1:32:29] week with you are not going to be enough
[1:32:31] for you to overcome in this hour you'll
[1:32:35] never see yourself in the vision of the
[1:32:38] bride's future until you learn to Feast
[1:32:40] on the word every single day
[1:32:44] every day
[1:32:46] you need to be in the word every day
[1:32:51] every day somebody said I don't have
[1:32:54] time to listen to a sermon three hours a
[1:32:56] day you don't have to be in the word
[1:32:58] three hours every day but you need to be
[1:33:01] in the word
[1:33:02] you're sitting in a chair with your
[1:33:04] phone in your hand
[1:33:07] and then telling me how busy you are
[1:33:10] I don't mean to be ugly that's not busy
[1:33:15] that's not busy that's filling up time
[1:33:18] and space we're going to have to make
[1:33:20] sure that we use some time every day for
[1:33:24] the word of God in order to be able to
[1:33:26] grow because Satan's working overtime to
[1:33:28] take you out of the vision
[1:33:31] foreign
[1:33:32] I preached a message I think in 1996
[1:33:35] seeing yourself in the vision
[1:33:38] and God Revisited some of that with me
[1:33:41] in the night last night and I see myself
[1:33:43] in this vision and you you can see
[1:33:46] yourself there
[1:33:50] let me let me give you this one example
[1:33:51] I know you're standing but brother
[1:33:53] Branham talks to us like this you know
[1:33:56] when we were in Pentecost we were afraid
[1:33:58] every time we every time we we left a
[1:34:02] good service and went home and and the
[1:34:04] devil told us we didn't have the Holy
[1:34:06] Ghost
[1:34:07] and it wasn't for us and all that was
[1:34:10] just emotion and then we'd call our
[1:34:12] prayer partner on the phone and they
[1:34:14] wouldn't answer
[1:34:15] and we thought the Rapture had taken
[1:34:17] place
[1:34:18] I couldn't tell you how many times
[1:34:20] growing up I thought the Rapture already
[1:34:21] happened
[1:34:22] and I'd surely been left
[1:34:25] that's not seeing yourself in the vision
[1:34:29] then we heard brother Branham and he
[1:34:31] said once you know who you are in him
[1:34:32] you can no more be lost than God could
[1:34:35] be lost
[1:34:39] that's powerful stuff
[1:34:42] if that becomes a revelation to you you
[1:34:44] don't have to fear hell
[1:34:47] you've just got to fear missing your
[1:34:49] opportunity to see yourself in the
[1:34:51] vision
[1:34:52] you place yourself in there and then you
[1:34:54] don't have to Fear the Future because
[1:34:57] you know who the future is and you know
[1:35:00] who owes the future so I take that one
[1:35:02] step further and say there can't be a
[1:35:04] rapture
[1:35:06] there cannot be a Rapture without me
[1:35:09] I don't ever have to fear missing the
[1:35:11] Rapture again there can't be a Rapture
[1:35:13] without me I was his seed when I got
[1:35:16] here
[1:35:20] and he knew how to get his seed
[1:35:22] he reached me didn't you have to repent
[1:35:24] sure I did didn't I have to follow
[1:35:27] through sure I did but I've known I've
[1:35:29] got to see myself in the Rapture Vision
[1:35:31] not take myself out of it okay praise
[1:35:36] God Hebrews chapter 4
[1:35:44] verse 14 we've been reading this seeing
[1:35:47] then
[1:35:48] that we have a great high priest
[1:35:53] let me just mention that our great high
[1:35:56] priest does not have an inferiority
[1:35:59] complex
[1:36:03] he knows who he is
[1:36:05] he has no identity crisis
[1:36:08] aren't you glad that your high priest
[1:36:10] doesn't hesitate
[1:36:12] he knows exactly his position
[1:36:16] that is passed into the heavens
[1:36:20] Jesus Yeshua the Son of God let us
[1:36:29] I've told you what that means it means
[1:36:32] throw your life around it
[1:36:34] drop your Bulldog jaw in it
[1:36:39] don't you turn loose no matter what the
[1:36:42] devil says
[1:36:44] don't you turn loose no matter what your
[1:36:47] loved ones said
[1:36:49] you dig your jaw down into it and let
[1:36:52] that bone slip down like a bulldog and
[1:36:55] say I'm holding on
[1:36:57] because I have a great high priest
[1:37:01] the next verse says for we have not a
[1:37:03] high priest which cannot be touched with
[1:37:06] the feeling of our infirmities but was
[1:37:08] in
[1:37:09] All Points tempted like as we are yet
[1:37:13] without sin
[1:37:15] let us therefore come
[1:37:18] reluctantly
[1:37:22] beat down
[1:37:24] boldly
[1:37:26] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:37:29] obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
[1:37:32] the time of need isn't God good now I
[1:37:36] want to read one more place you've been
[1:37:39] standing a moment you're going to be
[1:37:40] seated for a while so let's just stand
[1:37:43] this one out if we can and if we can't
[1:37:45] you may be seated Hebrew it's always the
[1:37:48] case Hebrews chapter 2
[1:37:51] verse 12-18 saying I will declare thy
[1:37:54] name unto my brethren in the midst of
[1:37:57] the church will I sing praise unto thee
[1:38:00] and again I will put my trust in him and
[1:38:04] again behold I and the children which
[1:38:06] God hath given me now I tell you that's
[1:38:09] pretty powerful there you're taking a
[1:38:12] stand for your children how many of you
[1:38:15] know it's time to take a stand for your
[1:38:17] family
[1:38:19] if you don't oh if you don't stand in
[1:38:22] the gap for your family who will
[1:38:26] we must do it
[1:38:29] Hallelujah verse 14 for as much then as
[1:38:33] the children are partakers of Flesh and
[1:38:37] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:38:41] of the same that through death he might
[1:38:45] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:38:49] that is the devil you want to know why
[1:38:52] Jesus died he died to destroy the power
[1:38:54] of death
[1:38:56] he had to die to destroy the power of
[1:39:00] death as brother Greeley told us the
[1:39:03] other night the the the the the accuser
[1:39:06] came to him
[1:39:08] but he didn't find anything in our Lord
[1:39:10] that would agree with him
[1:39:12] so he just has to throw up his hand and
[1:39:14] run away that devil that torments you so
[1:39:17] if he came to you one time
[1:39:20] and didn't find something in you that
[1:39:22] kept saying Amen to him he'd have to go
[1:39:25] and leave you alone
[1:39:26] he'd have to go find something else to
[1:39:28] whoop you with
[1:39:30] but the reason why he gets to to write
[1:39:32] us is because we give him a saddle
[1:39:36] that's what the old timers used to say
[1:39:39] you you can't give the devil a saddle
[1:39:41] he'll ride you all night you've got to
[1:39:43] make sure there's nothing in you that
[1:39:45] agrees with him if he comes to tell you
[1:39:47] how lonely you are and you agree with
[1:39:49] him guess what
[1:39:51] he gets on your back
[1:39:55] if he comes to tell you how mistreated
[1:39:56] you are and you agree with him guess
[1:39:58] what he does
[1:39:59] he'll ride you all over town
[1:40:01] come on he came to destroy the power of
[1:40:04] death that is the devil and he goes on
[1:40:06] and delivered them
[1:40:08] who through fear of death were all their
[1:40:11] lifetimes subject to bondage watch that
[1:40:12] no no no no no
[1:40:14] watch this
[1:40:16] they were their whole lifetime subject
[1:40:19] to bondage because they feared death
[1:40:23] it's true today
[1:40:26] you you you've got to be like Jake Hess
[1:40:28] you've got to say death ain't no big
[1:40:30] deal
[1:40:31] death is just a doorway to get over
[1:40:33] through there brother sister there's
[1:40:35] nothing to hold us here
[1:40:37] one more verse or two or three for
[1:40:40] verily he took not on him the nature of
[1:40:42] angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:40:44] Abraham thank God he did wherefore in
[1:40:48] all things it behooved him to be made
[1:40:50] like unto his Brethren that he might be
[1:40:52] a merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:40:54] things pertaining to God to make
[1:40:57] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:41:00] people the last verse for in that he
[1:41:03] hath suffered for in that he himself for
[1:41:07] in that he himself hath suffered being
[1:41:11] tempted he is able to sucar them that
[1:41:16] are tempted aren't you glad he is May
[1:41:20] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:41:22] his word you may be seated but don't let
[1:41:25] your attention go to sleep
[1:41:28] I I want you to look
[1:41:31] at a mass a quotation from the Hebrew
[1:41:35] series
[1:41:37] I read this to you
[1:41:40] recently
[1:41:42] paragraph 172
[1:41:46] of the message Hebrews chapter 2 number
[1:41:49] two
[1:41:50] man always feared death
[1:41:54] that's what we just read in the
[1:41:56] scripture
[1:41:58] man was forever in bondage
[1:42:02] because he feared death
[1:42:06] now look what our Lord did Christ
[1:42:11] became sin
[1:42:14] now that's different than just carrying
[1:42:17] sin
[1:42:18] the church says he carried our sin
[1:42:23] if he carried our sin it would be like
[1:42:26] us are you with me
[1:42:29] it would be like carrying a sack of
[1:42:31] potatoes with you somewhere
[1:42:33] and if I should come along and lift that
[1:42:36] burden off your back and take that sack
[1:42:38] of potatoes I could no longer say that
[1:42:41] you were carrying the sack of potatoes
[1:42:44] so if sin was like a sack of potatoes
[1:42:47] and we say he carried our sin or he bore
[1:42:51] our sin all he would have to do is lay
[1:42:53] that down
[1:42:55] and you'd be lost
[1:42:57] is that right but the Bible didn't just
[1:42:59] say he carried our sin the Bible said he
[1:43:03] became sin the actual Greek teaches us
[1:43:06] that he was transfigured
[1:43:11] he was changed by our sin
[1:43:16] now Jesus was not ugly
[1:43:20] I want you to know that he was not an
[1:43:22] ugly human being
[1:43:24] he was beautiful to look upon
[1:43:27] until he became sin
[1:43:31] have you ever seen what sin can do to a
[1:43:35] beautiful person
[1:43:37] have you ever seen the the wrinkles that
[1:43:40] form like the Grand Canyon on their face
[1:43:44] the the look of their skin their ears
[1:43:48] change nose changes mouth changes
[1:43:53] there's nothing any more identifiable
[1:43:56] than a life of sin
[1:43:59] yet Mars the physical form so when
[1:44:02] Christ on the cross
[1:44:04] became sin his physical body the prophet
[1:44:08] of the Old Testament said his physical
[1:44:11] body was marred by sin scarred made ugly
[1:44:16] by sin he was changed from beauty to sin
[1:44:23] and in order for that to take place it
[1:44:26] had to be a supernatural work of the
[1:44:28] father
[1:44:28] so he wasn't just carrying your sin
[1:44:31] around to help you out he literally took
[1:44:35] your sin and became that
[1:44:40] so he hung there with the sin of the
[1:44:44] whole world not only on him but in him
[1:44:48] though he was guilty of no sin of his
[1:44:52] own brother Branham said Christ became
[1:44:56] sin made low to take death upon himself
[1:45:02] you know this is
[1:45:04] it's it's
[1:45:06] anyway it's powerful
[1:45:08] and he's not ashamed to be called our
[1:45:11] brother
[1:45:12] for he was tinted just like we are
[1:45:17] tempted
[1:45:19] and he can be the right kind of an
[1:45:22] intercessor because he stood the same
[1:45:24] kind of a Temptation that you stand and
[1:45:28] he took your place can you say Amen
[1:45:31] knowing that you couldn't take it
[1:45:34] yourself
[1:45:36] so don't you see brother sister the
[1:45:38] whole thing is
[1:45:39] Grace all of it is
[1:45:42] Grace it's not what you do anyhow it's
[1:45:45] what he's already done for you now you
[1:45:48] can't do one thing to Merit your
[1:45:50] salvation your salvation is a gift
[1:45:53] Christ became
[1:45:57] he became sin he was judged of the
[1:45:59] father
[1:46:03] the father has to judge sin
[1:46:06] so Christ became sin that he might
[1:46:10] receive the Judgment of his father
[1:46:13] the Bible tells us he was cursed hanging
[1:46:16] on that tree
[1:46:17] how could God be cursed How Could the
[1:46:19] Father curse him the father could have
[1:46:22] never cursed him in his glorified
[1:46:24] condition
[1:46:26] but because he became sin
[1:46:29] the father had no choice
[1:46:32] it was legal I want you to see this it
[1:46:36] was lawful it was legal it was according
[1:46:42] to the righteousness of God that he be
[1:46:44] judged to die
[1:46:46] so the father had to turn his back
[1:46:50] now we understand the word in Greek is
[1:46:53] kenosis
[1:46:56] and kenosis is an emptying and we can go
[1:46:59] through these scriptures again sometime
[1:47:02] kenosis is an emptying of oneself
[1:47:07] of all the deity that was in him every
[1:47:10] bit of that God every bit of that deity
[1:47:14] that was in the body of Our Lord must
[1:47:16] leave him it had to leave him
[1:47:20] because that deity couldn't die
[1:47:24] how many of you know deity can't die
[1:47:26] this isn't complicated don't look like
[1:47:28] it's complicated it's not complicated
[1:47:30] don't don't look like it's some big real
[1:47:32] confusing thing oh no it's exactly how
[1:47:35] he was made 100 God
[1:47:39] 100 man so all the father had to do was
[1:47:42] walk out
[1:47:44] God just left him
[1:47:47] what is that scriptural it sure is
[1:47:49] that's what kenosis is my father my
[1:47:52] father
[1:47:53] that's not talking about a trinity
[1:47:56] that's talking about the omnipresence of
[1:47:58] God
[1:47:59] my father my father why hast Thou
[1:48:03] forsaken me
[1:48:05] because the the God within him the deity
[1:48:08] the 100 percent of God that he was could
[1:48:12] not die under the curse like that
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:15] so he emptied himself
[1:48:18] you talk about a beautiful plan
[1:48:21] talk about a real story to be told he
[1:48:25] emptied himself of all that was God
[1:48:27] about him
[1:48:28] and he died the empty shell of a man
[1:48:30] somebody said well then how in the world
[1:48:32] could his death make a difference for us
[1:48:36] who knows
[1:48:39] who knows
[1:48:42] if all of God left him and he died a man
[1:48:46] what kept Him from being just like any
[1:48:49] other man
[1:48:55] give me something else all those things
[1:48:57] are probably 100 percent true give me
[1:48:59] something else
[1:49:02] his blood
[1:49:06] his blood
[1:49:08] the only thing in that moment that set
[1:49:11] him apart from any other man on the
[1:49:13] planet was that he did not have human
[1:49:16] blood he had blood that was specifically
[1:49:19] created for Redemption so there he hangs
[1:49:22] an empty shell of a man God leaving him
[1:49:25] through kenosis brother Brandon preaches
[1:49:27] by the way I'm not making this up I'm
[1:49:29] not pulling it out of my hat
[1:49:32] he emptied himself of these things
[1:49:34] died an empty shell of a man
[1:49:37] but here is what the devil wasn't
[1:49:40] counting on
[1:49:41] that blood
[1:49:45] that blood that come running down that
[1:49:48] cross out of his veins that Fountain out
[1:49:52] of Emmanuel that opened up that day that
[1:49:56] wasn't man's blood that was blood like
[1:49:59] Northern man had ever had specifically
[1:50:01] created with the Zoe cell of life in it
[1:50:05] the very life of God
[1:50:06] and so that's how you were redeemed you
[1:50:10] were redeemed not because God died for
[1:50:12] you you were redeemed because a man died
[1:50:15] for you but he shed God's blood
[1:50:21] he said oh Father father why hast Thou
[1:50:24] forsaken me and the father had no choice
[1:50:27] but to turn from him because he had
[1:50:31] become
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:33] our sin
[1:50:35] how many of you think you understand
[1:50:36] that let me see you if you do I think
[1:50:39] I'm understanding that he said now you
[1:50:42] can't do one thing to Merit your
[1:50:44] salvation your salvation is a gift
[1:50:47] Christ became sin that you might become
[1:50:51] righteous
[1:50:52] oh and he's the right kind of a chief
[1:50:55] Captain for our Salvation because he
[1:50:58] suffered just like we suffered he'd been
[1:51:00] tempted just like we're tempted and he's
[1:51:03] not ashamed to be called our brother
[1:51:05] because he knows what we go through with
[1:51:08] oh nobody knows
[1:51:14] help me now
[1:51:15] I feel real good
[1:51:18] I can see some of your whole lot tighter
[1:51:20] than I am right now
[1:51:22] I'm gonna preach till I'm tired how
[1:51:24] about that
[1:51:25] he got happy I'm going to get happy
[1:51:28] because he got happy
[1:51:29] all right let's go on
[1:51:31] oh bless me his name
[1:51:34] for verily he took not on him the form
[1:51:36] of angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:51:39] Abraham Oh my he didn't become an angel
[1:51:42] remember this he didn't become an angel
[1:51:44] he become the Seed of Abraham and we
[1:51:46] being dead in Christ take on Abraham's
[1:51:49] seed and her heirs according to the
[1:51:53] promise
[1:51:54] see he never took on the form of an
[1:51:56] Angel he never become an angel he become
[1:51:59] a man and by the way your dead loved
[1:52:01] ones don't become angels
[1:52:05] why would they need to be angels
[1:52:08] they're Sinners that have been saved by
[1:52:10] grace if they called on the name of the
[1:52:13] Lord that's all they needed to do
[1:52:17] they don't need to wear diapers and play
[1:52:20] harps
[1:52:23] come on
[1:52:26] you know people put an angel in their
[1:52:28] house and they say that's my Aunt Mary
[1:52:32] that's bad theology
[1:52:36] bad theology he become the Seed of
[1:52:39] Abraham and took the sting of death in
[1:52:42] his own flesh
[1:52:43] to reconcile us back to God and now sets
[1:52:47] there for an intercessor
[1:52:50] my how could we reject it friend
[1:52:54] isn't that a good question how could we
[1:52:57] reject it the deity of Jesus Christ is
[1:53:00] the next quote
[1:53:02] and this is one that I love
[1:53:06] even if it was 1949.
[1:53:10] I love this
[1:53:13] he said how was it God's blood God has
[1:53:17] no blood how could it be because it was
[1:53:21] God's creative blood that he created
[1:53:25] in order to redeem us and came and lived
[1:53:29] in the same body that he created
[1:53:31] therefore he could not
[1:53:34] God had to suffer Temptation don't
[1:53:38] change this slide just yet
[1:53:42] he had to suffer sexual temptation
[1:53:54] nobody would want to entertain the
[1:53:57] thought
[1:53:58] of Our Lord having to be tempted by
[1:54:02] sexual temptation
[1:54:04] but he was 100 God
[1:54:07] and he was 100 man
[1:54:12] together
[1:54:14] oh I just love it I've had some
[1:54:16] religious Fanatics to follow me around
[1:54:18] through the years
[1:54:20] and they cannot handle this
[1:54:23] they cannot handle the fact that all
[1:54:26] means all and that all matter means all
[1:54:29] manner
[1:54:31] but what did he do he dismissed it
[1:54:34] how did he find the strength to dismiss
[1:54:38] and to resist he did it because he kept
[1:54:42] his eye on the go on the mission on the
[1:54:47] purpose
[1:54:48] there was a struggle with it
[1:54:53] father if at all possible
[1:54:56] let this cup
[1:54:59] nevertheless
[1:55:05] when we get so high and mighty we ought
[1:55:08] to practice the prayer of the Lord
[1:55:10] nevertheless not my will after we've
[1:55:12] told God how we want him to do it
[1:55:15] we ought to end every bossy prayer
[1:55:19] we ought to end every bossy Prayer by
[1:55:21] saying not my will Lord nevertheless
[1:55:23] here's what I hope for nevertheless not
[1:55:27] my will but your will be done
[1:55:30] he struggled to flesh
[1:55:32] was weak the spirit willing as long as
[1:55:36] he leaned on the deity as long as he
[1:55:39] leaned on the spirit he was strong but
[1:55:43] as soon as he started thinking with the
[1:55:46] flesh
[1:55:48] he got weak all over again he learned in
[1:55:52] the short years this is what you've got
[1:55:54] to hear he learned in the short years of
[1:55:58] his life how to get back to the goal
[1:56:03] and to do it without sinning
[1:56:09] now how do you think he was capable of
[1:56:12] doing that
[1:56:13] somebody said because he was God not at
[1:56:15] all
[1:56:16] it wasn't God tempted with sexual
[1:56:18] immorality
[1:56:20] it was man that was tempted that way he
[1:56:23] learned what you and I have to learn
[1:56:25] that the victory is in our mind
[1:56:29] the victories in our thoughts
[1:56:32] you've just got to get a hold of the
[1:56:33] thought and you've got to get a hold of
[1:56:35] it immediately
[1:56:37] in that what we've taught you through
[1:56:39] the scripture you've got to cast down
[1:56:41] imagination you've got to pull it down
[1:56:43] and take it captive you've got to punge
[1:56:46] it beneath the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:56:49] you've got to keep putting yourself in
[1:56:51] the vision
[1:56:52] and say there's more to live for than a
[1:56:56] few seconds of pleasure
[1:56:59] [Music]
[1:57:01] I wish somebody could help me today
[1:57:04] there's so much more to live for
[1:57:08] purpose and vision in life then a few
[1:57:12] seconds of pleasure
[1:57:14] he had to even be faced with the
[1:57:17] filthiness of sexual Temptation so that
[1:57:20] he could fulfill all
[1:57:22] let's go on
[1:57:24] he had to suffer all kinds of Temptation
[1:57:27] to be tempted by the devil in riches and
[1:57:31] powers and dominions and so forth he had
[1:57:34] to suffer all of that
[1:57:37] in order to do it he couldn't be as God
[1:57:41] in spirit he had to be God in flesh
[1:57:46] he had to learn to allow the spirit that
[1:57:50] was in him to strengthen him even to his
[1:57:54] flesh and the way our flesh is
[1:57:56] strengthened by the spirit is when we
[1:57:58] lean on the word and we lean on the
[1:58:00] truth and we constantly wrestle down
[1:58:03] every lie and every thought that exalts
[1:58:07] itself against the truth of who we're
[1:58:09] born to be
[1:58:11] you weren't born to be a fornicator
[1:58:13] you weren't born to be an alcoholic you
[1:58:16] weren't born to be subject to the flesh
[1:58:18] you were born to be subject to the
[1:58:20] spirit but it doesn't become an
[1:58:22] automatic thing it wasn't automatic for
[1:58:24] our Lord
[1:58:25] it's not going to be automatic for us
[1:58:27] but how many of you believe it's worth
[1:58:29] the war
[1:58:30] I said Do you believe it's worth the war
[1:58:34] paragraph 104
[1:58:37] 1963 how can I overcome
[1:58:40] he said how he said look Temptation was
[1:58:43] for him
[1:58:45] you know that
[1:58:47] the Bible said he was tempted in all
[1:58:49] points
[1:58:50] like as we are yet without sin this is
[1:58:53] how can I overcome 1963.
[1:58:57] on the new sheet it's the bottom of page
[1:59:00] two good do you think you do do you have
[1:59:02] it or did I did you're just working on
[1:59:04] getting it
[1:59:05] I just want to make sure I didn't leave
[1:59:07] it off
[1:59:08] he was tempted by drinking
[1:59:16] oh I just love it I just love it I just
[1:59:21] love it
[1:59:24] the thought crossed his mind
[1:59:30] oh look at my own folks been with me all
[1:59:33] these years heard me preach this time
[1:59:35] and time again and still looking at me
[1:59:37] like I'm off my rocker
[1:59:42] because you just can't imagine him
[1:59:45] thinking I'd like to drink that whole
[1:59:47] fat of wine
[1:59:51] I'm so tired of Peter
[1:59:57] Simon is running me crazy
[2:00:02] and now his wife's mad at him
[2:00:08] that's just a little inside joke
[2:00:11] from from The Chosen
[2:00:16] I got all of
[2:00:22] all that's mine give me a vat
[2:00:25] let me just swim in it for a few seconds
[2:00:29] up
[2:00:30] he caught that
[2:00:35] he caught that
[2:00:38] he pulled that down
[2:00:41] he repented of the thought by focusing
[2:00:45] on the righteousness of the commission
[2:00:49] you can too
[2:00:53] he was tempted by drinking he was
[2:00:55] tempted by women
[2:01:02] he was tempted by everything that could
[2:01:04] be tempted by he was tempted by
[2:01:06] everything that we are he was a man
[2:01:09] and yet you couldn't put a mark on him
[2:01:12] yes sir so just remember this folks you
[2:01:16] are not God does not judge you for being
[2:01:18] tempted
[2:01:21] your your trouble with him is when you
[2:01:25] yield to that
[2:01:27] because your next thought after yielding
[2:01:29] is to justify
[2:01:31] and you can never justify yourself
[2:01:34] because the blood of the Lamb has come
[2:01:38] to justify you
[2:01:40] when you start trying to justify
[2:01:43] Yourself by telling us how stressed you
[2:01:46] are
[2:01:49] you are refusing the justification of
[2:01:53] the Lamb
[2:01:55] and you are leaning on emotional
[2:01:57] justification and how many of you know
[2:01:59] there's just not enough
[2:02:02] excuse
[2:02:04] to forgive us
[2:02:07] when we reject the spirit
[2:02:10] and choose the flesh
[2:02:12] so I want you to know there is no ways
[2:02:14] none
[2:02:15] that a man can be tempted that our Lord
[2:02:17] wasn't tempted and yet he did every bit
[2:02:20] of it without sin
[2:02:21] not because he was God but because he
[2:02:24] was man who learned to lean who learned
[2:02:26] to pull down the thought who learn to
[2:02:29] let the spirit lead instead of the flesh
[2:02:31] always leading he was in every way our
[2:02:33] example he had to go through it so that
[2:02:35] he could learn and understand how to
[2:02:38] suit her
[2:02:40] how many of you know the Bible said
[2:02:42] though we were a son
[2:02:44] though he were a son
[2:02:46] yet he learned obedience
[2:02:48] by the things he suffered
[2:02:51] do you know how he learned he learned by
[2:02:52] suffering
[2:02:55] was any God why didn't he know it all
[2:02:57] why did he have to learn anything
[2:02:59] because he was 100 God and 100 man but
[2:03:03] God in him had need to learn nothing the
[2:03:05] man in him needed to learn everything is
[2:03:07] that right can you trust a savior like
[2:03:10] that let me see your hand if you can
[2:03:12] trust a high priest like that A Savior
[2:03:14] like that a mediator like that my
[2:03:16] goodness that ought to make you the
[2:03:18] happiest people on the face of the Earth
[2:03:21] isn't that the truth we we ought to be
[2:03:23] the happiest people that have ever lived
[2:03:25] on the planet
[2:03:26] not because we have an excuse for our
[2:03:28] sin but because we have a way out
[2:03:32] Devil Couldn't put a mark on him
[2:03:35] paragraph 105 this is one of my favorite
[2:03:38] things right here this is the definition
[2:03:42] of overcoming according to brother
[2:03:44] Branham overcome means read it for me
[2:03:48] would you
[2:03:53] was Jesus an overcomer
[2:03:55] why because he recognized the devil in
[2:03:58] every one of his tricks
[2:04:02] was brother Branham an overcomer
[2:04:04] why
[2:04:06] because he learned to recognize the
[2:04:08] devil in every one of his tricks do you
[2:04:10] know when you're going to be an
[2:04:11] overcomer
[2:04:16] well we've been Overcomers
[2:04:19] because we've overcome
[2:04:21] we've recognized the enemy it's just
[2:04:24] when he gets close enough to get in the
[2:04:25] bed with us
[2:04:28] it's just when he gets so close to us
[2:04:32] that we can't emotionally discern what's
[2:04:34] him
[2:04:35] that we don't overcome
[2:04:40] you know there's a lot of situations
[2:04:42] that we don't have to put ourselves in
[2:04:45] there's a lot of Temptation that we
[2:04:46] don't really have to go through
[2:04:48] if we'd learn where to put ourselves
[2:04:55] there's a reason why the Bible said it's
[2:04:57] good for a man not to touch a woman
[2:05:01] brother Brandon said any man
[2:05:04] any man that Drew a woman into his arms
[2:05:07] and he says drew a woman draws a woman
[2:05:09] into his arms for a hug
[2:05:12] any man
[2:05:14] is going to experience some sort of a
[2:05:17] sensation
[2:05:22] so do you want to know how not to be
[2:05:24] living like that and having experiences
[2:05:25] like that
[2:05:27] then don't be hugging women
[2:05:30] you men don't be hugging women
[2:05:35] it's really kind of simple
[2:05:37] hug your wife
[2:05:40] hug your mother
[2:05:43] you don't even you don't even draw your
[2:05:45] mother into your arms and pull her up to
[2:05:47] your bosom
[2:05:49] there's a proper way there's a right way
[2:05:52] you've got a granny in the church
[2:05:55] when I give my daughter-in-law a hug I
[2:05:57] hug her with a side hug
[2:06:00] to respect her and to respect the word
[2:06:05] that's what you're supposed to do
[2:06:09] because any natural born man he said
[2:06:12] that he talks about sexual glands
[2:06:17] resting and residing in the lips
[2:06:28] there's
[2:06:30] all kinds of chemicals
[2:06:33] and hormones that are released in the
[2:06:35] body
[2:06:38] I have a help app and my health app was
[2:06:41] telling me all the different things
[2:06:45] that
[2:06:46] kissing
[2:06:48] can do for my physical health
[2:06:51] I started looking for my wife
[2:06:56] I don't need a doctor
[2:07:00] I just need my wife's lips
[2:07:11] don't get religious
[2:07:17] it's not right
[2:07:20] for people who are not married to one
[2:07:22] another
[2:07:27] do you know how much stuff
[2:07:31] could have been prevented
[2:07:35] if a man and a young woman or a young
[2:07:37] man a young woman an old man or a woman
[2:07:39] whatever they are
[2:07:40] made a pledge to one another we're not
[2:07:43] going to kiss each other until we're
[2:07:44] married
[2:07:46] somebody said don't you find that to be
[2:07:48] old-fashioned I find it to be a good
[2:07:50] plan if you want to stay out of trouble
[2:07:55] some people won't choose that because
[2:07:56] they don't want to stay out of trouble
[2:08:00] I don't even suggest let me tell you
[2:08:02] what a prude I am I don't even suggest
[2:08:05] that that men and women boys and girls
[2:08:08] hold hands
[2:08:10] that are not married to one another
[2:08:14] because I understand how the enemy uses
[2:08:18] something like that
[2:08:20] somebody said I just don't know how
[2:08:22] anybody could live that way you can if
[2:08:25] you choose to
[2:08:28] and it's ever more the sweet it's ever
[2:08:31] more the precious it's ever more the
[2:08:34] holy
[2:08:37] when you wait until the appropriate time
[2:08:43] she doesn't belong to you
[2:08:46] until you vowed publicly before God and
[2:08:48] your friends
[2:08:50] the saints of God
[2:08:53] there's a right way in the wrong way and
[2:08:55] young people today even around this
[2:08:56] message get way off course
[2:09:01] we've had couples through the years and
[2:09:03] I refuse to marry
[2:09:06] not because of gossip but because I saw
[2:09:09] with my own eye
[2:09:11] the way they were rubbing on one another
[2:09:14] and it's not a good example for the rest
[2:09:17] of the body
[2:09:19] we're going to be tempted because we're
[2:09:21] living in a body of flesh but we can
[2:09:24] sometimes remove ourselves
[2:09:27] from situations
[2:09:29] it's one of the reasons why I believe in
[2:09:31] chaperones does that make this a cult
[2:09:35] if it does that's all right you tell
[2:09:38] them I don't care if that's what it
[2:09:40] makes it
[2:09:44] because Christianity in in its and it's
[2:09:48] rare and it's in its root
[2:09:50] fulfills every requirement
[2:09:54] for a cult
[2:10:00] so I'm not worried about words that get
[2:10:02] tossed around like that
[2:10:04] young men and young women need
[2:10:06] chaperones
[2:10:07] and they need chaperones that can talk
[2:10:16] and they need chaperones that can stand
[2:10:19] up and say hey I don't care if you hate
[2:10:21] me or not
[2:10:22] you do that one more time I'm going to
[2:10:24] blow the whistle from the highest
[2:10:25] mountain
[2:10:29] now sometimes they come along and they
[2:10:31] think because they're already in the 30s
[2:10:34] a grown in adults I've had that line
[2:10:38] used on me several times
[2:10:40] that they don't need to be what they do
[2:10:42] they need a chaperone
[2:10:45] your parents that don't enforce that
[2:10:47] you're asking for trouble
[2:10:51] my this is good
[2:10:53] why are you preaching this way today
[2:10:54] you're are you hammering on something
[2:10:56] particular that
[2:10:59] to overcome means to recognize the devil
[2:11:02] in every one of his tricks
[2:11:05] I understand that I miss quite a
[2:11:07] conversation on the on the night of the
[2:11:10] Hanukkah party about the way we do
[2:11:12] things
[2:11:13] and I miss the conversation so I didn't
[2:11:16] get a chance to put my two cents in now
[2:11:18] it's my chance
[2:11:20] we do it because we understand what
[2:11:22] happens when we don't do it the Bible
[2:11:25] Way
[2:11:26] the Holy Ghost way
[2:11:29] the way of righteousness
[2:11:31] let me tell you something you don't have
[2:11:34] to live a defeated life like that you
[2:11:36] can do the right thing
[2:11:39] I don't care what the enemy is tempting
[2:11:41] you with our Lord took it all born it
[2:11:44] all rejected it all defeated it all he
[2:11:47] overcame so you and I can overcome and
[2:11:51] what does it mean to overcome to
[2:11:52] recognize the devil in every one of his
[2:11:54] tricks
[2:11:56] people will pull you in
[2:11:58] they'll pull you into their stuff
[2:12:02] there's a whole lot of manipulation that
[2:12:04] goes on in friendships
[2:12:06] people will pull you into their stuff
[2:12:08] you refuse to be pulled in
[2:12:11] remember when when the pastor don't
[2:12:13] agree with them they're always going to
[2:12:14] look for somebody that will agree with
[2:12:16] them
[2:12:18] you just cut that right off and say
[2:12:20] we're not going there we're going to
[2:12:22] overcome we're going to recognize the
[2:12:24] devil in every one of his tricks he said
[2:12:27] lots of people say there is no devil
[2:12:30] it's just a thought don't you believe
[2:12:32] that
[2:12:33] there's a real devil he's just as real
[2:12:37] as you are or anybody a real devil and
[2:12:40] you must recognize him real and you must
[2:12:43] know he's a devil
[2:12:46] and he's real
[2:12:49] I understand there was people talking
[2:12:51] about whether hell is a literal place or
[2:12:53] not the Bible said it was and brother
[2:12:55] random said it was what else do you need
[2:12:58] of course it's a literal place
[2:13:01] where the church got it wrong is they
[2:13:03] called it an eternal hell in its
[2:13:04] Everlasting fire
[2:13:07] which means it has a beginning and it
[2:13:09] has an end because it's a created place
[2:13:11] the Bible said the soul that sin and
[2:13:13] shall surely die one day the soul that
[2:13:16] has sinned will cease to exist
[2:13:18] but the soul that has Zoe life
[2:13:22] oh
[2:13:26] we'll never die can you say man never
[2:13:30] die
[2:13:31] then the same time and you you recognize
[2:13:34] him let's see the same time that you
[2:13:37] recognize him and know that he's the
[2:13:39] devil and he's against you than to
[2:13:40] overcome
[2:13:42] look
[2:13:43] look at this how simple you must
[2:13:45] recognize that the god in you
[2:13:49] is greater
[2:13:50] and my dear then that old real devil
[2:13:54] oh he may be real but you've got one
[2:13:57] living in you that's greater and
[2:13:58] mightier than he is that's the one
[2:14:01] that's in you
[2:14:02] and has already overcome him how many of
[2:14:05] you are glad for your intercessor now
[2:14:07] glad for your great high priest now oh
[2:14:11] look what else he says in the ending
[2:14:13] this he said and by his grace
[2:14:16] I underline that for you
[2:14:19] anybody want to read that
[2:14:27] this is not an unfair War
[2:14:30] if it is it's stacked in our favor
[2:14:34] because you've got more power and more
[2:14:36] Authority
[2:14:38] you've got more overcoming power than
[2:14:40] that enemy to us you're more than a
[2:14:43] match for him amen There's real
[2:14:45] overcoming when you recognize
[2:14:47] it's in the recognizing
[2:14:50] it's in the not hiding
[2:14:52] no
[2:14:53] don't hide
[2:14:55] recognize
[2:14:57] recognize that that nothing has come
[2:15:00] upon you but such is common the man
[2:15:04] and nothing has tempted you or Common
[2:15:06] Man
[2:15:08] that hadn't tempted him
[2:15:10] and he overcame what do you do when you
[2:15:13] fail you tell me what you do when you
[2:15:14] fail
[2:15:18] you run to him
[2:15:21] fast as you can
[2:15:23] and once you've run to him and you know
[2:15:25] that he has forgiven you how do you know
[2:15:27] he's forgiven you
[2:15:29] because you felt better no sir
[2:15:33] what does feelings have to do with it
[2:15:35] well I ask him to forgive me but I'm not
[2:15:37] sure if he did or not because I don't
[2:15:39] feel any better
[2:15:41] what does feeling have to do with it
[2:15:43] somebody tell me what the word said did
[2:15:46] you meet the word requirement
[2:15:49] did you repent of your sin did you say
[2:15:53] Lord give me the grace to recognize the
[2:15:56] devil every time he comes to tempt me
[2:15:58] the next time if you did whether you
[2:16:01] feel better or not
[2:16:04] you're forgiven
[2:16:06] and you ought to live like a forgivened
[2:16:08] person
[2:16:09] a forgiven person
[2:16:12] all right one more confirmation and
[2:16:14] evidence Southgate California 1962. I
[2:16:18] hope you're with me
[2:16:19] he said I made a remark if I had two
[2:16:22] drops of the literal blood of Jesus in a
[2:16:25] glass
[2:16:28] how I would hold it to my heart and weep
[2:16:31] stand there watching that I didn't
[2:16:34] stumble to spill it as I walked with it
[2:16:37] to wherever I was destined to go with it
[2:16:40] hold it there
[2:16:41] brother Branham is making this remark
[2:16:43] about the preciousness and the value of
[2:16:47] the blood
[2:16:48] and he said if I had a glass and had two
[2:16:50] drops of that literal blood in that
[2:16:52] glass I would walk different
[2:16:58] very very careful that's a key
[2:17:01] you're catching it
[2:17:03] it's a key I would walk very careful I
[2:17:05] would stand there watching
[2:17:07] I'd hold it to my heart I'd weep over
[2:17:09] the preciousness of that blood that's
[2:17:11] what's wrong with the church
[2:17:13] we've quit weeping over the precious
[2:17:15] value of the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:17:20] I looked around this room and I saw some
[2:17:23] passion in here
[2:17:24] passion is not action or movement
[2:17:27] passion is something that strikes in the
[2:17:29] inner in the inner recesses of who a
[2:17:31] person is and when some of you were
[2:17:33] singing that song like oil upon his feet
[2:17:36] like wine for him to drink
[2:17:40] I pour my love on you and you begin to
[2:17:43] sing it you begin to mean it you begin
[2:17:45] to you begin to feel it and in your mind
[2:17:48] it was as though you were pouring pill
[2:17:50] or fragrant oil
[2:17:53] on his feet like perfume and your tears
[2:17:57] were falling down on his feet and ankles
[2:18:00] as you worshiped before him realizing
[2:18:04] how precious oh how precious it is to
[2:18:08] know that we have an audience with him
[2:18:11] when we come to worship
[2:18:13] not because we're worthy of one
[2:18:16] but because he made us Worthy
[2:18:19] and and brother random said I I would I
[2:18:21] would watch
[2:18:28] that I didn't stumble
[2:18:30] one way you do that is you keep your
[2:18:32] eyes on your feet
[2:18:35] because you're watching to see that
[2:18:37] where you step
[2:18:38] is going to be able to support you
[2:18:42] without tripping you
[2:18:45] without trapping you
[2:18:47] there are certain times in our life that
[2:18:49] we don't always have the time to stop
[2:18:51] and look down at our feet
[2:18:52] but there are certain times when we get
[2:18:54] in situations like some of us are in
[2:18:56] right now that the enemy is really
[2:19:00] working overtime
[2:19:01] to get us and we recognize it we better
[2:19:04] not make any steps that we're not
[2:19:06] carefully watching
[2:19:12] I have a
[2:19:14] an app that measures
[2:19:17] through my watch and through through the
[2:19:20] camera
[2:19:22] the the time
[2:19:25] variation between Heartbeats
[2:19:30] and and there's 200 000 articles
[2:19:34] that are written to support the science
[2:19:38] that the time between your heartbeat not
[2:19:42] just the strength of it
[2:19:44] but the time between your heartbeat can
[2:19:47] be just as telling
[2:19:49] of what's going on in your body as your
[2:19:51] heart rate itself heart rate
[2:19:55] is not much of a measurement really
[2:19:59] but if you really wanted to know
[2:20:03] you you watch the amount of time between
[2:20:06] and it not only can measure the time but
[2:20:08] by that science
[2:20:10] is able to tell you lots of things about
[2:20:13] what's going on in your body at that
[2:20:14] moment including whether you're
[2:20:16] vulnerable for sickness
[2:20:18] and what your stress level is
[2:20:22] and the app is so intuitive
[2:20:25] that it will even tell me sometime
[2:20:28] your stress level is at 97 percent
[2:20:36] try sitting down
[2:20:39] for at least 10 minutes
[2:20:42] and make no major decisions
[2:20:49] because science proves
[2:20:52] that people make dumb decisions I'm
[2:20:56] going to give some of you a good excuse
[2:21:01] when they're under those levels of
[2:21:04] stress and pressure
[2:21:06] they can't make decisions that are that
[2:21:09] are wise enough taking in the whole
[2:21:12] picture because they're acting out of
[2:21:14] the out of the fight or flight
[2:21:17] instead of acting out of a place of
[2:21:19] relax so I don't I'm not a meditator you
[2:21:22] know I don't do I don't fold my legs
[2:21:24] like a Swami or something and do yoga
[2:21:29] when it says you should take 10 or 12
[2:21:31] minutes to meditate I have no problem
[2:21:33] with that
[2:21:34] because I know exactly how to do that
[2:21:37] I know exactly where to find my source
[2:21:41] when it's time to meditate
[2:21:43] how many of you know where the source is
[2:21:46] it's right in the word
[2:21:49] I don't know if I can see the scripture
[2:21:51] fast enough
[2:21:53] that I could share it with you
[2:21:56] but it talks about
[2:22:11] I'll get it for you another time
[2:22:15] it's here somewhere as I just put it
[2:22:17] here
[2:22:18] but how many of you know the Bible tells
[2:22:20] us how to meditate
[2:22:22] we arrange our heart we turn our heart
[2:22:25] toward his word
[2:22:28] let the meditation of my
[2:22:30] heart
[2:22:32] be acceptable
[2:22:34] you start checking your emotions
[2:22:37] and you check your thoughts and you
[2:22:40] check where your heart is and you start
[2:22:43] looking on who you're created by God to
[2:22:46] be
[2:22:47] and that's bigger than what you're going
[2:22:48] through at the moment
[2:22:50] I don't care how big it is
[2:22:52] I don't care how terrible what you're
[2:22:54] going through is at the moment we've got
[2:22:56] a god who's going to help us get through
[2:22:58] it all if you believe that same man
[2:23:01] he said I would watch every step that I
[2:23:04] didn't stumble placing my feet just
[2:23:06] where they should be I thought how I
[2:23:09] would hold those two drops of blood
[2:23:16] but you know
[2:23:18] in the sight of God tonight
[2:23:21] setting before me
[2:23:23] is a greater thing to him
[2:23:27] don't miss this
[2:23:29] than his own blood
[2:23:31] I said don't miss this
[2:23:34] because it's the purchase
[2:23:40] anybody know what he's talking about you
[2:23:46] [Music]
[2:23:48] it's not the price
[2:23:50] that's the most precious it's the
[2:23:53] treasure that the price has purchased
[2:23:56] you and I are more precious than two
[2:24:01] drops
[2:24:03] of the literal blood of Jesus Christ
[2:24:07] because had you have been the only
[2:24:09] person lost he would have shed his blood
[2:24:14] just to purchase your way out if you
[2:24:17] believe that same man
[2:24:20] Glory
[2:24:22] glory be to God that makes you higher
[2:24:24] than an angel
[2:24:26] it makes you up more value than the
[2:24:29] literal blood of Jesus he shed his blood
[2:24:33] for you and here I hold you in listening
[2:24:35] tonight of the Gospel
[2:24:40] he goes on
[2:24:42] then how close I must be to tell you
[2:24:45] exactly the truth because God will make
[2:24:48] me answer for it at the day of the
[2:24:50] judgment
[2:24:51] more than if I took the blood the
[2:24:54] literal blood and threw it on the ground
[2:24:56] listen
[2:24:59] sure you want to be a preacher
[2:25:03] it would be a greater penalty to mislead
[2:25:06] the people the purchase of his blood
[2:25:08] that it would be to throw the blood from
[2:25:10] the charger that I had in him oh God
[2:25:16] that's for me
[2:25:18] that's what I have to remember
[2:25:20] that you are the elect Lady of Jesus
[2:25:25] Christ
[2:25:27] I must not allow my frustration ever
[2:25:31] caused me to forget
[2:25:33] that you are more valuable and for me to
[2:25:37] mislead you
[2:25:39] is more dangerous more hideous than if I
[2:25:44] should toss the literal blood of Jesus
[2:25:46] out the window from a charger because
[2:25:49] you are what the blood was created for
[2:25:53] are you listening
[2:25:56] you are what the blood was created for
[2:26:00] you are what the blood was shed for so
[2:26:05] you are of the greatest value
[2:26:08] now look at Colossians 2.
[2:26:12] let's have just a little more time
[2:26:15] I want to read Colossians 2 14 and 15 in
[2:26:18] the Amplified
[2:26:20] having canceled
[2:26:22] and blotted out
[2:26:25] and wiped away
[2:26:27] the handwriting of the note the bond
[2:26:31] with its legal decrees and demands this
[2:26:35] is so important
[2:26:39] when you were purchased with the blood
[2:26:42] of Jesus Christ a legal transaction took
[2:26:45] place
[2:26:47] and every demand that God had made on
[2:26:51] you was met
[2:26:53] by that blood
[2:26:55] it was a legal transaction
[2:26:59] it cannot be broken
[2:27:03] it's a powerful Covenant
[2:27:06] remember I've been telling you that that
[2:27:09] the the he that sanctifieth and he that
[2:27:13] is Sanctified is one
[2:27:16] so you
[2:27:18] that promise that God has made that
[2:27:21] Covenant that God has made cannot be
[2:27:24] broken
[2:27:26] it's in force and it's in force forever
[2:27:30] as long as you walk in fellowship with
[2:27:32] what has happened in your life
[2:27:35] and we'll find the greater balance
[2:27:38] probably won't get to it today but we
[2:27:40] will
[2:27:41] having canceled and blotted out and
[2:27:44] wiped away the handwriting of the note
[2:27:46] the bond with its legal decrees and
[2:27:48] demands which was enforced and stood
[2:27:51] against us hostile to us
[2:27:54] this note with its regulations decrees
[2:27:57] and demands he set aside
[2:28:01] and cleared completely out of your way
[2:28:08] every
[2:28:10] legal accusation every legal charge that
[2:28:16] Satan made
[2:28:18] against your life
[2:28:21] Jesus took every bit of that
[2:28:24] all the way to the cross
[2:28:26] and it was canceled
[2:28:32] my sin
[2:28:34] oh
[2:28:36] the Bliss
[2:28:40] of that glorious
[2:28:42] thought
[2:28:45] my sin
[2:28:47] not in part
[2:28:49] but the whole
[2:28:51] was nailed to the cross
[2:28:56] and I bear it no more
[2:29:00] praise the Lord
[2:29:01] It Is Well with My Soul
[2:29:06] this note with its regulations decrees
[2:29:09] and demands he set aside and cleared
[2:29:11] completely out of your way by nailing it
[2:29:14] to his cross the deed how many of you
[2:29:16] know the deed has been cleared
[2:29:18] all the way back to the beginning
[2:29:20] brother Branham taught us
[2:29:23] way back to the beginning in in uh it is
[2:29:26] the rising of the sun is one of the
[2:29:27] places where he talks about that
[2:29:30] having canceled and blotted out in white
[2:29:33] all right let's go on don't we have
[2:29:35] another verse verse 15. God
[2:29:38] God disarmed the principalities and
[2:29:41] Powers
[2:29:45] that were arranged against us
[2:29:48] I don't know if you're in a good mood or
[2:29:49] not to hear this
[2:29:51] and made a bold display and public
[2:29:55] example of them in triumphing over them
[2:29:59] in him and in it
[2:30:02] the cross
[2:30:04] can I have verse 15 in the King James
[2:30:08] can you find that for me
[2:30:11] so that people can recognize it
[2:30:20] talks about spoiling
[2:30:22] and having spoiled principalities and
[2:30:26] Powers
[2:30:27] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[2:30:30] over them in it
[2:30:38] that's like nanny nanny boo boo
[2:30:48] he not only Beat the Devil
[2:30:50] he mocked him
[2:30:53] [Music]
[2:31:04] having spoiled principalities and Powers
[2:31:07] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[2:31:12] over them in it
[2:31:18] oh
[2:31:21] that's good
[2:31:26] that word that that phrase
[2:31:29] triumphing over them in it
[2:31:33] it means disarmed
[2:31:37] the power it's the same root word as
[2:31:41] putting off
[2:31:43] divested exposed
[2:31:46] are made naked
[2:31:50] so basically Jesus stripped
[2:31:54] the devil's clothes off of him
[2:31:58] and made him stand naked
[2:32:01] in his defeat
[2:32:04] now we're not talking literal
[2:32:07] we're talking about a language that Paul
[2:32:10] chose to use when he's writing to the
[2:32:14] church in colossi
[2:32:17] he wanted them to know that this was
[2:32:19] such an open defeat
[2:32:22] that it was paraded around in front of
[2:32:26] all the underworld
[2:32:29] every demon that followed him
[2:32:32] every Angel Fallen by listening to his
[2:32:36] influence had to see the enemy
[2:32:39] ultimately defeated disarmed and
[2:32:42] stripped naked
[2:32:44] and if they choose to continue to follow
[2:32:47] such a defeated foe
[2:32:49] it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to
[2:32:51] me
[2:32:52] but it would make even less sense for
[2:32:54] any of us to follow him when we realize
[2:32:56] that Jesus has ultimately defeated him
[2:32:59] and took his ammunition and the and the
[2:33:02] prophet tells us he's now no more than a
[2:33:05] tool in the hand of God to to perfect
[2:33:08] the Saints and he also tells us that the
[2:33:12] only weapon the enemy has the only Power
[2:33:14] he has the only Authority he has to use
[2:33:16] against you is what you hand over to him
[2:33:21] you know this puts some responsibility
[2:33:23] on the believer
[2:33:24] because we can no longer say the devil
[2:33:26] made me do it
[2:33:28] because we now realize that if he made
[2:33:30] us do anything it's because we gave him
[2:33:32] the power he has no power to make us do
[2:33:35] anything
[2:33:36] if you did it you did it because you
[2:33:38] chose to do it you chose to recognize
[2:33:41] that the enemy has already been stripped
[2:33:43] of his power stripped of his weapons
[2:33:46] and embarrassed publicly and openly
[2:33:49] he is that defeated
[2:33:51] he's that defeated
[2:33:53] he's that defeated one day you're going
[2:33:55] to look upon him in his ruin
[2:33:58] the nations of this world are going to
[2:34:00] pass by
[2:34:01] looking through that great chamber into
[2:34:04] the underworld
[2:34:07] and see the defeat the ultimate defeat
[2:34:09] of the enemy
[2:34:12] and the nations of this world are going
[2:34:13] to say is that the one
[2:34:16] is he the one that made the Nations
[2:34:18] tremble
[2:34:21] and all it took for you to overcome him
[2:34:23] was a boo
[2:34:27] just a tiny little boo
[2:34:30] why because everything you are is behind
[2:34:33] that boo
[2:34:36] everything God made you every Redemptive
[2:34:38] blessing it's yours
[2:34:40] and so when you say boo to the devil
[2:34:42] it's not just it's not just a boo
[2:34:44] it's all of Heaven backing you up now
[2:34:47] how many of you are tired of the devil
[2:34:49] running you all around
[2:34:52] you ought to be past tired of that
[2:34:55] you ought to be ready to have the
[2:34:57] victory over that thing once and for all
[2:34:59] now now just a couple more things and
[2:35:01] we'll close
[2:35:03] let's see if we can do it let's see if
[2:35:04] we can close let's see if we can close
[2:35:06] before two let's see if we can close
[2:35:08] before ten till two
[2:35:11] let's just see if we can make a game
[2:35:22] oh Luke's standing up there Luke
[2:35:23] Jernigan
[2:35:25] when my notes were printed off and he
[2:35:27] just said I just didn't know what to do
[2:35:28] about the show they just kept on coming
[2:35:29] out
[2:35:34] 27 pages I said well here's what you
[2:35:36] don't know Luke
[2:35:37] is I've already preached about 12 of
[2:35:39] them pages
[2:35:42] but I added a few things so I had to
[2:35:44] reprint
[2:35:47] Owensboro Kentucky deep calleth under
[2:35:50] the Deep 1953 can I give you two more
[2:35:53] thank you
[2:35:55] thou Spirit of the devil
[2:35:59] that has bound my brother
[2:36:02] I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of
[2:36:07] God who came to this earth and fought
[2:36:10] principalities and robbed Satan and you
[2:36:14] have no legal right to hold him anymore
[2:36:24] Hallelujah
[2:36:27] where did Brother Berlin get an idea
[2:36:29] like that I just read it to you in the
[2:36:31] scripture
[2:36:33] he wasn't out of the word he was in the
[2:36:36] word
[2:36:37] thou Spirit of the devil that it ishma
[2:36:40] that has bound my brother I charge thee
[2:36:44] by Jesus Christ the son of God who came
[2:36:47] to this earth and fought principalities
[2:36:48] and robbed Satan and you have no legal
[2:36:51] right to hold him anymore
[2:36:54] and we stand under the commission of
[2:36:56] Jesus Christ said they shall cast out
[2:36:59] Devils come out of that man in the name
[2:37:02] of Jesus Christ leave him
[2:37:05] well that's how brother Branham did
[2:37:07] Deliverance Ministry
[2:37:10] he didn't coddle the spirit
[2:37:13] like message preachers do sometime today
[2:37:17] he didn't coddle it
[2:37:19] you didn't give it a bottle to suck
[2:37:22] I'm just telling you how I did it
[2:37:24] he didn't sit him down and interview him
[2:37:27] find out how the parents treated them
[2:37:31] let's see if we can figure out how this
[2:37:33] devil got in he didn't worry about how
[2:37:34] it got in
[2:37:36] he just knew there was a way to get it
[2:37:37] out
[2:37:40] he abolished the superstitious ideas and
[2:37:44] there are some great superstitious ideas
[2:37:46] among the charismatics today that
[2:37:48] they're really very superstitious
[2:37:52] because they think the only way that
[2:37:54] someone can have True Deliverance is
[2:37:56] you've got to discover the root in some
[2:37:58] field that they have special gifts of of
[2:38:01] finding the devil's name
[2:38:03] you don't have to have it I I know they
[2:38:06] have names
[2:38:07] and I know it can be revealed
[2:38:09] but you don't look any less powerful
[2:38:12] by not knowing its name
[2:38:14] because it ain't his name that's going
[2:38:16] to make the difference and it ain't your
[2:38:18] name that's going to make the difference
[2:38:19] it's that name of Jesus Christ you
[2:38:23] ought to help your preacher this morning
[2:38:26] they shall cast out they'll come out of
[2:38:28] that man in the name of Jesus Christ you
[2:38:31] know how we pray Lord If It Be Your Will
[2:38:35] would you help our brother
[2:38:39] foreign
[2:38:41] because it might not be God's will to
[2:38:43] help him you know
[2:38:45] it's God's will to help him
[2:38:47] it's God's will to help him we ought to
[2:38:50] raise up and try to help him he said can
[2:38:52] you hear me can you hear me now and this
[2:38:54] can you hear me now say Amen
[2:38:58] the brother says amen
[2:39:00] the brother says amen all right you may
[2:39:02] raise your head look this way
[2:39:05] I didn't know how deaf he was
[2:39:08] just a deaf Spirit like a dark cold
[2:39:10] Shadow go
[2:39:12] like that moving to him now he has
[2:39:16] perfect hearing now
[2:39:19] he said listen just a moment come here
[2:39:20] sir I'm going to whisper real low this
[2:39:23] microphone is very sensitive say man the
[2:39:25] brother said amen I love the Lord the
[2:39:27] brother says yeah I love the Lord
[2:39:29] say glory to God the brother says glory
[2:39:31] to God
[2:39:32] the Bram said I'm whispering
[2:39:35] see this I'm going to put my hand over
[2:39:36] the microphone so you won't hear it just
[2:39:38] me praise the Lord the brother continues
[2:39:40] to repeat and respond to what brother
[2:39:42] random is saying
[2:39:43] he said now I'm just barely Whispering
[2:39:45] listen to this
[2:39:47] can you hear me all right hear me now
[2:39:49] sir I can hear you playing yes
[2:39:52] now watch can you hear me now yes I can
[2:39:55] hear you playing amen God bless you
[2:39:57] you're healed my brother
[2:40:06] don't miss this
[2:40:09] he said now see watch the disease
[2:40:12] now if the man keeps believing
[2:40:14] that'll never
[2:40:16] come to him
[2:40:19] again
[2:40:21] because the devil wasn't talked out of
[2:40:23] his stronghold
[2:40:25] he was kicked out
[2:40:28] he wasn't invited
[2:40:31] would you mind very much leaving the man
[2:40:34] would it trouble you if I ask you to
[2:40:37] come and help get out of the man so he
[2:40:39] can hear no no no no
[2:40:40] he was dealt with by the authority of
[2:40:43] Jesus Christ how many of you believe the
[2:40:45] bride has that Authority it's part of
[2:40:47] the bride's inheritance it's part of the
[2:40:49] bride's inheritance now you need to
[2:40:52] understand that everybody that's hard of
[2:40:53] hearing doesn't have a demon but this
[2:40:56] demon was affecting this man's hearing
[2:40:59] there was no other reason for him to
[2:41:01] have hearing loss and so moving the
[2:41:05] demon moved the loss it moved the
[2:41:08] disease
[2:41:10] now this is the last one
[2:41:13] I think
[2:41:18] I gotta find it speak to the Rock
[2:41:22] Owensboro Kentucky
[2:41:24] paragraph 29 the devil hates me
[2:41:28] and I know he hates you too
[2:41:30] and he's the enemy
[2:41:32] but as long as God's my friend this
[2:41:34] brother Phantom
[2:41:36] I don't have no fear of him
[2:41:39] I want to tell you something you've got
[2:41:40] the same right
[2:41:43] as long as you know God's your friend
[2:41:46] I am a friend of God
[2:41:53] I don't have no fear of him
[2:41:56] did they hear it
[2:41:59] that's Tally's favorite song and it must
[2:42:01] be Zeke's now I am a friend of God I Am
[2:42:06] A Friend Of God I Am A Friend Of God he
[2:42:10] calls me friend
[2:42:14] it don't get much better than that are
[2:42:16] you singing it darling
[2:42:19] he said
[2:42:27] I just drive him right on back
[2:42:30] take the word of God and move him right
[2:42:32] on back out of his out of the place that
[2:42:34] he thinks he's holding he hasn't got no
[2:42:37] strongholds he's absolutely legally
[2:42:42] legally I told you this is a legal
[2:42:45] transaction legally defeated in every
[2:42:48] place
[2:42:51] thank you brother Austin for helping me
[2:42:53] so much
[2:42:54] I dreamed of you last night
[2:42:57] and I dreamed of three Austins
[2:43:03] clear as clear as a bell two are sitting
[2:43:05] here this morning
[2:43:08] and
[2:43:09] I saw God doing something
[2:43:14] when I first saw God doing something and
[2:43:17] a voice said for Austin
[2:43:21] I was moving toward Austin Yantis and
[2:43:24] the Lord said yes him and him
[2:43:27] and him
[2:43:30] and all three Austins were standing
[2:43:32] there side by side
[2:43:34] I told Brother Greeley a couple dreams I
[2:43:36] had last night I dreamed about a
[2:43:38] preacher that I haven't had any contact
[2:43:40] with in years
[2:43:42] and I don't know but a couple things
[2:43:44] about him I don't know very much about
[2:43:45] him he believes this message but in the
[2:43:48] dream he had come to me for a word from
[2:43:50] the Lord he said brother Shelley I need
[2:43:52] a word from the Lord and I just felt
[2:43:54] like in my heart you'd give me a word of
[2:43:55] the Lord I said north I mean excuse me I
[2:43:57] said South
[2:44:01] and he looked shocked
[2:44:03] and and I said you you had to before the
[2:44:06] Lord would it be North or would it be
[2:44:07] South and the Lord said South
[2:44:10] and then I had a dream about Alan Fox
[2:44:12] and I saw that that in this dream now it
[2:44:16] was just a dream that he wanted that he
[2:44:18] had wanted to play the guitar and and
[2:44:21] and and help lead others in worship I
[2:44:24] don't know if Allen's ever played the
[2:44:25] guitar I don't know I don't I don't know
[2:44:29] but that had been shattered it looked
[2:44:31] like so like the enemy had got involved
[2:44:34] in politics or something and and pushed
[2:44:36] him out of the way and and in my dream
[2:44:38] it was as though he thought in his mind
[2:44:40] he could never have that again and the
[2:44:42] word of the Lord came to him and said
[2:44:44] you contend for every promise
[2:44:48] that I have ever given you it's not too
[2:44:50] late for every word to come to pass just
[2:44:53] like that well in that dream I I then
[2:44:56] raised up and said for all the saints
[2:45:00] and I began to speak that over Lord give
[2:45:03] the people strength
[2:45:06] to stand up and fight
[2:45:09] for every promise that you've ever made
[2:45:12] and that's when he took me to Esther and
[2:45:15] talked to me about seeing myself in the
[2:45:18] vision telling people you you've got to
[2:45:20] see yourself there not take yourself out
[2:45:22] but see yourself there so anyway it was
[2:45:25] quite a Time
[2:45:26] and I just noticed that Austin Hodges
[2:45:28] was helping me so so well so faithful
[2:45:31] not distracting but so helpful I
[2:45:33] appreciated it
[2:45:35] he said he's ah I just drive in baby
[2:45:38] right on back take the word of God and
[2:45:39] move him right
[2:45:40] on back out of the place he thinks he's
[2:45:43] a holding he hasn't got no strongholds
[2:45:45] he's absolutely legally defeated in
[2:45:48] every place
[2:45:50] he said the devil
[2:45:52] the devil hasn't got one legal right at
[2:45:58] all nowhere
[2:46:02] foreign
[2:46:07] and a password that's all
[2:46:15] wonder what he helps you get access to
[2:46:20] isn't that what a password does
[2:46:27] he hasn't got no legal right
[2:46:30] to any man
[2:46:34] that'll accept the promise of Jesus
[2:46:38] Christ all a man or a woman has to do is
[2:46:42] accept the promise of Jesus Christ and
[2:46:45] the devil's what wept
[2:46:48] now look at this you you all will
[2:46:50] remember this because when I taught on
[2:46:52] the
[2:46:53] on the uh
[2:46:55] what's that series called sister Jada
[2:46:58] that you all have been listening to you
[2:47:00] and brother
[2:47:02] transformed they called it
[2:47:04] on the app we had this quote in in that
[2:47:08] series
[2:47:09] and I love it
[2:47:12] yes sir he's whipped in sickness
[2:47:17] he swept in disappointments
[2:47:21] he swept in everything
[2:47:24] he swept in death
[2:47:27] he can't scare me he can't scare you
[2:47:32] that's all he is
[2:47:35] a big old shadow
[2:47:38] who are we talking about the devil
[2:47:41] the devil the devil the devil the very
[2:47:45] thought of the devil causes a lot of
[2:47:46] church people to get nearly to a nervous
[2:47:49] breakdown if they think they do anything
[2:47:51] that puts them on the devil's radar they
[2:47:53] start backing up I'm preaching to some
[2:47:56] of you because I've seen you do it
[2:47:58] anybody listening
[2:48:00] you start making a little ground
[2:48:03] afraid to testify I know how the enemy
[2:48:06] does he's tried to do me the same afraid
[2:48:09] to testify because you don't want to you
[2:48:11] know draw any unnecessary attention and
[2:48:13] and the devil just treat you any worse
[2:48:15] than he already does you know and so we
[2:48:18] back up well he's just a big old Shadow
[2:48:20] anyway he's already defeated he's swept
[2:48:23] in all these things
[2:48:25] so he just might as well go on down the
[2:48:27] street
[2:48:28] I just seen his red light go up over a
[2:48:30] wheel I just saw a dreadlock go up over
[2:48:33] the hill a while ago didn't you
[2:48:35] other friends talk about the devil
[2:48:37] leaving in the
[2:48:39] I start saying a forward but I guarantee
[2:48:41] you that ain't so
[2:48:44] the prophet drove afford I know the
[2:48:46] devil don't drive afford
[2:48:49] but whatever it was
[2:48:52] he went he I saw his red light brother
[2:48:54] random said go up over the hill a while
[2:48:55] ago didn't you
[2:48:58] he's gone
[2:48:59] he's gone
[2:49:01] yes sir all right praise the Lord I
[2:49:03] begin to feel pretty good now
[2:49:06] I want you to know folks this is the
[2:49:08] inheritance that we have
[2:49:13] it's the last scripture as you're
[2:49:16] standing and musicians are coming
[2:49:22] Psalm 46
[2:49:26] verse one through three
[2:49:28] God
[2:49:30] is our refuge and strength
[2:49:33] [Music]
[2:49:36] why don't you swing your arms and get
[2:49:38] some blood flowing
[2:49:40] God is our refuge and strength
[2:49:45] a very present help in trouble

[2:50:07] the mountains be carried into the midst
[2:50:09] of the sea
[2:50:12] though our aorta tears
[2:50:16] though the waters thereof or are and be
[2:50:18] troubled though the mountains shake with
[2:50:20] the swelling thereof Selah why why do we
[2:50:23] have such confidence because God is our
[2:50:26] refuge
[2:50:28] strength a very present help
[2:50:31] in the time
[2:50:34] trouble

[2:50:58] worship him before we go home today
