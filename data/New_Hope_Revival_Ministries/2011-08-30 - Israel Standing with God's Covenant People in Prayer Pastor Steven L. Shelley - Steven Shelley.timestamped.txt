[0:01] [Music]
[0:14] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of the
[0:16] New Hope Revival ministries right here
[0:19] in Smith Station Alabama I count it a
[0:21] privilege to be able to come to you
[0:23] today in this video blog and share with
[0:26] you a few of the things that the Lord
[0:28] has placed on my heart during this past
[0:31] season when we look at some of the
[0:33] things that are happening in our nation
[0:35] right now we can't help but be disturbed
[0:39] in fact sometimes we get hindered by the
[0:42] news but I truly believe that if we will
[0:45] keep our eyes focused on the Lord Jesus
[0:48] Christ that he will help us face the
[0:51] uncertainty of today and of tomorrow
[0:55] we've just had a shaking on the east
[0:57] coast in fact even the National
[0:59] Cathedral in Washington DC received some
[1:02] structural damage and as I'm speaking to
[1:05] you right now we've spent the morning in
[1:08] prayer because a hurricane is headed
[1:10] toward the east coast of our nation by
[1:14] the time you watch this video blog the
[1:16] damage that's going to be done will
[1:19] already be done people will be putting
[1:21] their lives back together I trust and
[1:24] pray that we as a nation will do
[1:27] everything that we can to lift up Jesus
[1:30] in this hour not only with our words but
[1:33] with our lives the one thing I've
[1:35] learned about following the Lord is our
[1:38] problems look so big so huge like a
[1:41] mountain before us when we're looking
[1:43] and focusing on our problems but when we
[1:46] learn to look to Jesus and put our hope
[1:48] and trust in the Lord It's amazing how
[1:51] our problems shrink in his presence it's
[1:55] like the words of the old song that
[1:57] we've sung for so many years turn your
[1:59] your eyes on Jesus look full in his
[2:03] wonderful face and the things of this
[2:06] Earth will grow strangely dim in the
[2:09] light of his glory and grace problems
[2:14] heartaches adverse circumstances and
[2:17] situations just somehow shrink when we
[2:20] put our focus and our attention on the
[2:22] Lord Jesus Christ and I'm encouraging
[2:24] you to do that today what I really want
[2:27] to share with you is my heart for Israel
[2:30] and I know sometimes it's hard to focus
[2:32] on another Nation when we're facing such
[2:34] uncertain times in our own Nation but I
[2:37] truly believe that the Church of Jesus
[2:39] Christ has a very serious responsibility
[2:43] to pray daily for the Peace of Jerusalem
[2:46] to pray for the nation of Israel and the
[2:48] Jewish people who are still many of them
[2:51] scattered all over the world we need to
[2:55] specifically pray that God will gain
[2:58] victory over all all of the enemies of
[3:01] Israel and the nation and the people I
[3:04] love Israel I visited it the first time
[3:08] in
[3:09] 1979 when I was 11 years old and it
[3:12] changed my life I was standing with my
[3:15] dear grandmother who has been with the
[3:16] Lord over 20 years now uh in the in the
[3:20] Museum of the Holocaust we call it
[3:23] yadvashem it was in the old Museum now
[3:27] there's a beautiful beautiful Memorial
[3:29] Museum in Jerusalem uh much more
[3:32] advanced than the one that I was
[3:34] standing in in
[3:35] 1979 I was standing in a room where all
[3:38] the walls were covered with a mural
[3:40] mural of bodies those who had been
[3:44] killed massacred in the Holocaust for an
[3:47] 11-year-old child to stand in a room a
[3:50] surrounded on the Walls by the naked
[3:53] bodies of the Jewish people was a moment
[3:56] that I'll never forget as long as I live
[3:59] but as I was standing there I had a
[4:01] spiritual vision and in that Vision I
[4:03] was caught away into a place it was very
[4:06] similar to what we read about in The
[4:08] Book of Ezekiel in fact I heard the
[4:10] voice of the spirit saying son of man
[4:13] what do you see I heard the whole
[4:16] chapter uh unfolding as I was in in e as
[4:21] Ezekiel it was as though I was Ezekiel
[4:24] in this experience I knew then from that
[4:28] moment on when I heard the spirit of the
[4:29] Lord speaking out of me that there would
[4:31] be a mighty Army raised up I knew that
[4:35] my life was somehow marked to pray for
[4:38] the Jewish people and for Israel it was
[4:41] not until 2002 that I was blessed to
[4:44] visit that Nation again and since 2002
[4:47] I've been over 20 times by myself with
[4:50] other members of our church and on
[4:53] several occasions I've been able to take
[4:54] my entire family I want you to know that
[4:57] one of the best things that we can do
[4:59] for Israel right now is pray pray for
[5:02] her protection pray for her safety pray
[5:04] for her Prosperity we need to be
[5:07] Watchmen on the walls we need to
[5:10] remember that the LIE of replacement
[5:13] theology has done tremendous damage to
[5:16] the relationship between the church
[5:19] Israel and the Jewish people we need to
[5:21] continue to repent for the lie of
[5:23] replacement Theology and we need to join
[5:26] ourselves in Covenant to pray to believe
[5:29] that God will have his way with his
[5:31] people I want to share with you for just
[5:34] a moment a portion of scripture from
[5:37] Romans chapter 11 verse one said I say
[5:40] then hath God Cast Away his people God
[5:44] forbid for I am also an Israelite of the
[5:47] Seed of Abraham and of The Tribe of
[5:49] Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his
[5:53] people which he fornew and then it goes
[5:56] on to talk about this time in the life
[5:58] of the prophet Elijah when he also
[6:01] believed that he was the only one that
[6:03] all others had forsaken God he said they
[6:07] have killed your prophets and they have
[6:09] tore down your altars and I am left
[6:12] alone to seek and they seek my life but
[6:15] the answer comes in verse four God said
[6:18] unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000
[6:21] men who have not bowed the KNE to the
[6:24] image of Baal even so then at this
[6:26] present time the Apostle said also there
[6:29] is a Remnant according to the election
[6:31] of Grace I love this chapter I read it
[6:35] often let me skip down a few verses it
[6:38] speaks about the Gentiles I say then
[6:41] have they stumbled that they should fall
[6:43] God forbid but rather through their fall
[6:46] salvation is coming to the Gentiles for
[6:49] to provoke them to jealousy you see we
[6:51] have a responsibility to Israel and to
[6:54] the Jewish people now if the fall of
[6:57] them be the riches of the world and the
[6:58] diminishing of them The Riches of the
[7:00] Gentiles how much more their fullness
[7:04] for I speak to you as Gentiles in as
[7:06] much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles
[7:09] if by any means I may provoke you to
[7:12] emulation them which are my flesh and
[7:15] might save some of them he goes on to
[7:18] talk about the branches that are being
[7:20] broken off he talks about the Wild Olive
[7:23] Branch he talks about the Nations being
[7:26] grafted in he also speaks about the fact
[7:28] that we should should not boast against
[7:30] the root and we know that Israel and the
[7:33] Jewish people represents that root God
[7:36] has a covenant with Israel and he still
[7:39] cares about even the land of Israel I
[7:44] understand that so many of the prophetic
[7:46] promises in the Bible we can apply them
[7:48] to our life but we also need to
[7:51] understand the context of scripture and
[7:53] we need to remember that the greatest
[7:55] portion of the Old Testament was
[7:57] prophetic promises concerning the future
[8:00] of Israel and the Jewish people I was
[8:04] recently reading in Jeremiah chapter 31
[8:07] and I was reading about the promise of
[8:10] prosperity and what God's going to do
[8:12] specifically it speaks about a time when
[8:15] grapes would be planted again in Samaria
[8:18] and I want you to know that I'm
[8:20] personally aware and perhaps some of you
[8:22] are of Ministries who are standing
[8:24] alongside the Jewish people at this very
[8:27] moment just planting grape vines in The
[8:31] Vineyards and there will be several
[8:33] hundred people in just a few days that
[8:35] will start bringing in the Harvest I'm
[8:37] talking about gentile people who have no
[8:40] agenda who only want to go and love the
[8:43] Jewish people and stand with them and
[8:46] support them and let them know that we
[8:49] understand that we are blessed when we
[8:52] bless Israel remember the scripture said
[8:55] I will bless them who bless you and
[8:58] curse them who curse you you in fact I
[9:00] believe the only hope for the United
[9:02] States of America is to keep ourselves
[9:05] aligned with the nation of Israel I
[9:09] believe our future and our prosperity
[9:11] depends on our attitude toward Israel
[9:14] and the Jewish people so I'm calling you
[9:17] to pray you who love Israel let's get on
[9:20] the wa on the watch let's climb up on
[9:22] the walls again and let's pray not
[9:24] selfish prayers of what we would like to
[9:27] see God do let's pray the scripture read
[9:30] what God has promised in his word and
[9:33] pray that back to him and let him know
[9:36] I'm coming alongside the Jewish people
[9:38] believing that you will keep your word
[9:42] and your promise to them recently the
[9:45] Lord has been calling us back to spend
[9:47] some time in Israel my wife and my four
[9:50] children and I will leave in about a
[9:52] month from now and we'll be spending
[9:54] five weeks in our apartment in Jerusalem
[9:57] we Have No Agenda we just know the Lord
[9:59] is calling us we feel like that perhaps
[10:03] maybe the majority of our time is going
[10:05] to be spent in intercession just walking
[10:07] in Zion just loving the people and
[10:11] identifying ourselves with the promises
[10:13] that God has made in that Nation let me
[10:16] tell you the enemies of Israel are real
[10:19] and their agendas against her
[10:21] Annihilation are real and we as the
[10:25] Church of Jesus Christ we must stand in
[10:28] agreement pray for the Peace of
[10:30] Jerusalem if you want to know what time
[10:32] you're living in you can watch Jerusalem
[10:35] you can compare what you see going on
[10:38] right now in Israel with the scriptures
[10:40] and find exactly where we are in God's
[10:44] calendar in fact we're about to enter
[10:46] the holiest time on the Hebrew calendar
[10:49] the high holy days the Feast of trumpets
[10:52] we're going to to enter into that time
[10:55] of
[10:56] rosashana rashash Shana we often say the
[10:58] Jewish New Year and sakote and simota a
[11:03] very special time where we are reminded
[11:05] of the promises that God has made to
[11:08] Israel the Jewish people and also to the
[11:11] Gentiles to the Nations to those of us
[11:14] who love Israel I I just had to share it
[11:17] I've recently heard people making
[11:19] statements uh something like you know
[11:22] God no longer cares about the land of
[11:24] Israel it's now his people that he cares
[11:27] about and so forth but I want you to
[11:28] know I started searching the scripture
[11:30] and I found numerous scriptures where
[11:33] God says I love even the land even the
[11:37] dirt why does God love the land of
[11:39] Israel the dirt because he made a
[11:41] covenant agreement with that piece of
[11:44] land he gave that to his people and that
[11:48] promise is an eternal promise and though
[11:51] the enemy rages and though we see
[11:53] Division and though we see threats and
[11:56] we don't know exactly what things are
[11:58] going to look like between now and then
[12:00] we know how things are going to turn out
[12:02] in the end because God is faithful a
[12:05] great friend of mine a great man of God
[12:07] who's lived his entire life to preach
[12:10] the gospel in the nations of the world
[12:12] often makes this statement the greatest
[12:15] proof that there is a God is the nation
[12:18] of Israel because we see that God has
[12:21] been so faithful to keep his word to
[12:25] Israel and the Jewish people you know
[12:27] what that tells us it reminds Rems us
[12:29] that if God has been that faithful to
[12:32] his promise to the Jewish people he will
[12:34] be faithful to every promise that he has
[12:37] made to you and I so that's where we are
[12:40] right now we're Standing on the Promises
[12:42] of God we're believing for a great
[12:44] outpouring of the Holy Spirit In Our
[12:47] Lives we want to see the bride of Christ
[12:49] raised up to do what she's been called
[12:51] to do and during this time of of waiting
[12:54] and an interim period believing that God
[12:56] is going to keep his promise to the sons
[12:58] of the Kingdom we can be on the watch
[13:00] and we can pray for Israel and the
[13:02] Jewish people like never before father
[13:05] we thank you right now that you have
[13:07] awakened our hearts to love the Jewish
[13:10] Nation we Have No Agenda except your
[13:12] agenda to love them to serve them to
[13:16] show them our love for you by loving and
[13:20] serving them we pray for the Peace of
[13:22] Jerusalem we pray oh God that you will
[13:24] deal with the enemies of Israel while
[13:26] bringing salvation to both Jew Gentile
