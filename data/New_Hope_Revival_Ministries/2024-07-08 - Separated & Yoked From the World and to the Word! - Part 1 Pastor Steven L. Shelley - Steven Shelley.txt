breathed on your people and we do not take it for granted Lord we do not take it lightly you promised that where two or more were gathered in your name that you would be in the midst and I thank you that you've never failed you've always kept your promise and Lord there have been times that you had to make up one of the two it was just me and you and you have been faithful always faithful to

with me thank you for singing it and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy that we share as we te [Music] there none other has ever sing the sing this verse with me if you will before we go on i' stay in the garden with [Music] him though the night around [Music] me and though b bs me go through the [Music] voice his voice to me is calling the last time and he walks [Music] he talks and he tells [Music] me as we [Music] te not another has [Music] ever known Hallelujah Give the Lord a praise with me would you Jesus Jesus lift your voice up and thank him that he's with us hallelujah one man in God one God and one man that's a majority [Music] hallelujah praise His name he's life to me is life to me he's on our hands and I don't ever want to let him down he's on our hands it's up to us what we do with him isn't that right pilate had him on his hands and he failed he's on our hands now it's up to us to do what's right with him and for him we were born for that purpose for that reason he is not a last resort he's our first resource if we go to him first he meets us first and I have found found out that when we go here and there and finally get around to him he still comes he may come hanging his head but he comes I don't want to wound him I don't want to hurt his heart I want to make him number one the one thing I've learned about his jealous character is that if he is not Lord of all he will not be Lord at all he is not a lucky rabbit's foot he is not a horseshoe over the door oh no sir he wants to be Lord of everything every situation we can easily make him Lord over some things but other things we try to sort ourselves and we do ourselves and we do him a great disservice we just let him come and be Hebrews 13 8 why don't we just let him be Hebrews 13 and8 in every situation in every trial in every concern in every burden sing the chorus with me one last time and he walks with me and he [Music] talks and he tell me I am his own and the joy as we te there none other has ever known in the Lord good let's clap for these musicians for Chad leading the singing David and Ashley and Zack and and these ladies and sister Laurel and brother Cade we're blessed we are very very very blessed to have a sound Among Us that breaks open the heavens you may be seated just a moment it's not that the heavens are brass to the bride but there is a lot uh between us and that Dimension there is a lot of Darkness that comes there are a lot of burdens and worries and troubles and concerns and and thoughts and I sense there are even some missing this morning because of such things as that and we are so blessed that God has created Among Us a sound that opens up the heavenlies and if you need something the way is made for it to get to you if you need to go up the way has been made for you to get up a little higher than what you're going through at the moment and let me tell you something there's no need to worry about anything when you're in here it's going to wait on you how many of you found that to be the truth it's going to wait on you it'll meet you at the door sometime in your automobile before you get to lunch why some sometimes uh you can get all agitated and twisted up trying to decide where to go eat peace until it's time to decide where to go eat you everything that you have faced until you got here today most of it'll be waiting on you when you leave here the hope is that something will transpire in your life that when you leave this atmosphere you'll be able to face it a little differently than you did before you came that's why it's vital for you to be in the presence of the Lord it's vital and and uh I know it's the scripture said where two or more but let me tell you something he'll be the one he'll make it up you know a religious Jew can't pray uh he can read the Psalms and he can do all kinds of things alone but in order to have a a certain level of prayer he has to have a minion he has to have nine others who will join with him for this special level of prayer and and so sometimes you'll see religious Jews in the airport looking for other religious Jews so that they can stand in the corner 10 and have this special level of prayer and uh I've been I've been locked in a in a tight bathroom on an Lal flight to Israel while while the religious Jews were making a minion outside the door well I'm slightly claustrophobic and I had to interrupt the prayer because I get in there and get out as fast as I possibly can it's a little tight in there for me but I'm so thankful that I don't have to go find another believer or are are nine other believers to face a to find that special level of prayer I can go anywhere I want to go if I'm willing to come his way I'm going to be open and free with you today and I I want to I want to ask something of you I I want to ask you to look at me I don't often do that I'm not a lot to look at but I'm asking you to do that today it it's it's most distracting at times when I can see that your attention is somewhere else I don't want you to miss what God may have for you today it's not that I think that I have something on my own that's so important but I've been with him about this today and I try to do that every single week and I don't wait until Saturday night or Sunday morning oh I'm an hour I'm at least an hour hour and a half in the word every Sunday morning before I get here but that's not to decide what to preach usually it is to pull things together and make sure that I'm ready but I I want you to know last Monday morning I woke up my heart was being stirred and and uh I started riding on it Wednesday morning after church Tuesday night I started riding on it the Lord's taking me in a slightly different direction today I ask for your prayers we are excited to hear good reports about what the Lord is doing in Indiana we're so thankful that our precious Miller family from Missouri uh brother Truman and sister Martha who've been with us for so many years long distance they made their way over to the meetings in Indiana we heard that even our brother Ryan Jasper who was with us here some months ago he was over to Indiana for the service Friday night I believe he had to leave yesterday uh to get back to his church but we're just thankful to hear and so you look around see some folk missing quite a few of them are there supporting brother gy and that's exactly what we want we're so thankful for it there's not a jealous bone in my body I'm so thankful that they are there to amen the word do it's a different atmosphere God can meet needs even our own people can have a need met there that they that they haven't had particularly ministered to here that doesn't offend me that's the way that God works and uh I'm just so thankful that all of you didn't feel compelled to go I'm so thank ful you know some of the charismatic type groups of Morning Star in particular when we were moving around some of their uh folks in different conferences and things around the country they take off the month of July they closed their church and their Ministries down for the whole month of July so that people can take their vacations then and visit family then and do all the things they do then and then they kick back in uh August the 1st and they just go right on and they hardly Miss A Beat and uh while you some of you folks would love it others of you would stand on your head come on and so we just have to take the little bit slacker Sundays and we just have to go on with it and I'm so thankful for all of the many years that brother gy and sister Joyce have stood with us here there have been many reasons that they could have run away but they have been very very faithful they have raised their families here and we are so thankful for that in fact he's going to fill in for me in a couple of sunds when I'm out of out of state for for a little while with my wife in Utah and I'm thankful for for for knowing that when I leave that you're in the best of hands and and and it's just a wonderful thing and so charity and and Josh are there and uh and supporting brother gy and now Nathan and shos are streaming the service now they're on their way home from Virginia because he felt compelled to to visit his granddad you know his granddad's days sister Joyce's dad brother Ira his days are limited here on the earth and and if I was a member of that family and I felt a comp compelling to go I said and that's exactly what I would do you you don't want any regret you don't ever want to have to have a regret so uh sister shos texted to let me know that she couldn't speak for the senior GES but the junior GES are are traveling home Benjamin and Jenna and Eliana are coming home thank you Jesus on Tuesday and they'll be here for church Tuesday night when they were planning this trip they planned it around the time that her grandparents were going to be in Dallas from Arkansas her Dear Dad goes all the way to Arkansas to pick up his elderly parents 91 and 81 and brings them and uh lets them have some time with with other members of the family and they've come from other places to be gathered and it was a perfect opportunity for them to meet Eliana and we're thankful they've kept us in the loop with FaceTime and pictures and so forth but my days of mour are almost over and I'm thankful for that and Joshua also traveling home today God is good to us today is Sister Audrey Lewis's birthday and she hasn't been able to be here in some while but we are thankful for her we have been praying for Jamaica did you see how hard Jamaica was hit during this hurricane and we've been pray praying a lot of flooding a lot of damage and a lot of uh infrastructure uh you know taken down and we've been praying for them especially mother Chambers who is still going pretty strong in it it's amazing how God has preserved her but today is Sister Audrey's birthday and uh she was one of the first who who sent me a text on Father's Day I'm not her father she's a couple of years older than I am but but spirit spiritually she wished me a happy Father's day so I'm real delighted to return the favor today and and wish her a very happy birth day and we love her and we're thankful for her why don't we just let her know that we love [Applause] her and then on Wednesday well they're all out

coming I I was going through some text I found the text where David said to me I've got a friend who works with me named Jesse who's coming to church I found that text this week and uh and I appreciated what God did and has done for Jesse he's come a long way and I thank God for him and so we have uh we want to be excited for roa's birthday she's turning 20 how did that happen and then Friday is one of my dearest friends through the year is brother Harold and Sister Louise Weir they are streamers she has been most faithful to stream she is uh up 80 plus her birthday is on Friday I want to tell just one little thing about Sister Louise other than the fact that she only eats french fries once or twice a year that right there is is is uh really a hard thing to do only one CE or twice and it used to be when I was up there having meetings she would say I'm going to have french fries but this will be the last time this year I wished I was that dedicated I'm not but anyway she and her husband I met them the same weekend that I saw sister Alfreda in Michigan at the missionary camp that I or the missionary meetings that I preached so many years ago early 9s for brother Samuel John son and the wears had brought a quilt and the quilt was the life and Ministry of brother brandom made into a quilt and I thought it was one of the most amazing things I'd ever seen in my life and I wanted it and uh I said to Sister Louise do you think the sister it's not mine she said the woman who made it goes to our church I said well do you think she would sell it to me she said no I don't think so and I said well I'd like to to have it and I I would give her $1,000 for it that's a lot of money I don't know where I was going to get it but wasn't going to pull it out of the wallet that's for sure and nope no I don't believe she'd sell it well years later I met the woman who made the quilt and her name was Sister Whitaker and she had a daughter named Stacy so I found the way to get the quilt I want you to know that quilt has cost me many thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars but I got the quilt and yes sister Sharon it was worth it if sister traine would have lived to Saturday I'm glad she didn't because she was in terrible shape for so long but if she would have lived she would have been 94 years old on Saturday nikisha's birthday is Saturday we love sister nikesha and Nia and we want to say to sister nikesha happy birthday on Saturday and brother James skip Yantis has a birthday on Saturday as well so we want to say happy birthday to him he's here we better do it today happy birthday [Applause] brother are you just North of 60 that's what I thought I had it right but you're still moving around really well right playing uh cornhole and disc golf and just living the life of luxury with all of that beautiful uh outdoor activity God is good let's stand Fellowship meetings here August 3rd and 4th camp meeting uh a October 15th through the 20th who's going to be preaching the Holy Ghost he is I'm counting on him are you with me now you're going to remember to look at me even though I'm not pretty thank you so much Ma I didn't hear you but I'm assuming you will Matthew 25: 31-40 Le let's hear what God would say to us today I've been wrestling in the night for some of you I I could call you by name but it wouldn't do much good but I'm asking that God gives you Victory I want you to have victory in him he is the Victor our Victorious King isn't he isn't he Victorious when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him boy that sounds good to me then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory beautiful language and before him this is read letter words of Jesus and before him now listen isn't that unusual he's speaking about himself he is the one that's going to sit on the throne of Glory this is red letter this is Matthew this is the gospel and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now in that day Church there's going to be sheep Nations and there's going to be goat Nations and sheep nations are going to be made up of those Nations that have had sympathy and compassion and prayer concern and love for Israel and the Jewish people and there is only a Remnant left in this nation but thank God there's a Remnant that prays every day for for the nation of Israel it's a blessing to do so and goat nations are those that will that will reject her and turn her down and uh despise her and accuse her and and and if you had to guess uh will there be more sheep Nations or goat Nations what would you think goat Nations but we we learned that it's not just Nations that are going to be divided all of God's sheep are going to be divided from goats and they're similar you know they're they're cousins and they both taste good did you know that and uh they eat similar diet and they sound similar but they're not the same and it's going to take one smarter than we are to decide who is a sheep and who is a goat but not only Nations will be divided but also individuals will be divided let's go on and he shall set the sheep on his right hand this is individually now he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats they're going on the left and uh he goes on then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you what's the next phrase when was the kingdom prepared for the sheep from wasn't an afterthought part of the original plan for I was a hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him the sheep saying Lord when saw we thee unhung hered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when when saw we thee a stranger and took thee or naked and clothed thee all questions or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me remember he is our elder brother he didn't say that that you've done to my children like so many have quoted he said that you have done to my brethren to the least of my brethren he is our elder brother both our Papa and our elder brother and when you have done to them even the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me do you believe that do you understand that I'm thankful for that promise I'm very thankful is that verse third that's verse what what verse have we come to 40 all right one other place but I'll let you be seated God bless you as you take your rest I'd like to also read Red Letters From The Book of Matthew again chapter 11 verse 25 through 30 and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes are you all looking at me I mean I I'm very serious this morning very serious I don't like to be that serious when brother brandham was quoting this verse he would often misquote it he had a habit of running verses together I'm glad he's the only one that's ever done that I know none of us have ever done that I've done it many times and then someone said now where is that at you go looking for oh oh well part of it is over here and part of it is over there when brother Brandon was quoting this verse he would often say thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and H has revealed them unto babes do you know what he would say next such as would learn a and there's nothing wrong with that just didn't say it right here in this particular place because if we know anything about children babes toddlers they they learn some things and you can't teach them some things when they're when they're nursing the there there is a season for learning all thing are you with me there's a season for learning all things and I want to be in the right season to learn what I'm supposed to learn I want to get it under my belt because I don't want to be uh 3540 years in the faith and still toddling around like like like a a baby or like a toddler when I was a boy I enjoyed boy things but when I became a man the Apostle Paul said I I had to put away some of those childish things and I want you to know folks we're kind of growing into that place you know you're not measured by your years here on the earth spiritually you're you're kind of being measured by your years in the faith and I know as as we have learned in the natural that babies don't all grow at the same time H they they grow at different spurts have you ever somebody said over a little baby well must be having a growing spurt because they seem to be eating a little more and you know what in fact we see that we see that you're growing and the baby needs a little more nourishment and it eats a little more and and it's that way spiritually sometime we eat a little more when we need it well the reality is we're now in a place where we're going to need God's food his nourishment spiritual food in due season we're going to need it more and more all the time because it's only the word of God that's going to change us I know this is going to be a little rough here for a little while but we're going somewhere uh we are we are being separated and we are being yolked and I want to call this message separated and yolked and I want to give it a subtitle from the world and to the word we are being separated from the world and we are being yolked to the word isn't that exactly right and that's why we find this in Matthew 11 25 and 30 I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed him unto babes let's go on even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever listen he to whomsoever the son will reveal him you can't know the fatherly aspect of God unless it is revealed to you by the son Nobody Knows the father like the son and nobody knows the son like the father and when we have the Son of God he reveals to us the nature and the character of the Father which is sometimes uh in our human way of thinking uh a little regimented or a little rigid but I want you to know the Father's Love For Us is so great that he has paid the ultimate sacrifice he became the son he stepped down into a condescended form died on the cross securing eternal life for us does that sound like somebody who hates you does that sound like somebody who wants to crush you to powder no it sounds like somebody who loves us and loved us with such a love that he came up with a masterful plan that he might be able to win us and to redeem us oh what a blessed people we are redeemed of the Lord for such an hour as this to know that the son is revealing the father that the bridegroom is revealing to the bride the very nature of the Creator it's powerful and as with someone was praying the glory I think brother Hawk the glory of knowing that we are the the reproduced Christ in the earth I tell you that's a powerful thing to know that God has reproduced himself in the life of his sons powerful somebody said that may be too big of a description is it if the very life of God is in you if the very Spirit and the fullness of who Jesus Christ is and was has been now emptied into the bride is it really so much to say that he has reproduced himself in a multi membered body in a many-membered bride I don't think it's so very much at all I think it's a logical understanding we know that Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that demands that demands that the bride be the mystery of Christ revealed if it was the responsibility of the son to reveal the father it is now the wife's responsibility to reveal the bridegroom now that's what the word teaches us somebody said is that just quotations no that's the book that's from the absolute that's from The Prophet's quotebook the Holy Bible anybody with me that's where he quoted from 1611 right there blackb Bible and he was quoting from that you sound like you're getting a little aggressive well I don't mean to sound that way but this one this message has cost me something and therefore it's of greatest value to me when when you labor for something and you have to fight some imps to come to something you would like to think that someone would value the effort because whether we recognize it or not it's our destiny ha it's our destiny that's being revealed and we are not yet what we will be in fullness we are now now in measure what we will soon be in fullness and we'll only get there by being separated from the world and yoked to the word giving you a chance to agree because it's just the truth even so father for so it seem good in thy sight verse 27 again all the things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him praise God I'm one of them I want to stop and say thank you Lord that I am one of them that the son has revealed the father to Hallelujah come he said red letter come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest rest I will give you what rest rest what was it that the children of Israel missed they missed rest here Hebrews why did they Mis rest not because they didn't have the word Moses was a faithful deliverer of the word but the Bible tells us that the reason why Israel failed why they came short of rest is because they didn't do their part with the word when Moses delivered the word the word was no longer on the hands of Moses when Moses delivered the message when Noah when Noah delivered the word the the word was no longer weighing heavy on Noah's hands it was now on the hands of the people and they mocked him they made fun of him rain are you with me rain what is rain we've never seen rain I don't believe in a flood cuz I don't I don't know what rain is never seen anything like that but I want you to know it came and the Word was on their hands and the Bible said what happened was they perished they perished they lost everything including their lives because the word was on their hands and they failed to do anything about it the children of Israel fail oh my it's getting tied in here the children of Israel fail uh to enter into rest we've been talking about that and why did they fail to enter into the promise two reasons we can think of from the word number one they believed an evil report you have to measure what some people say you can't take it at face value because they've been spending too many times too much time with the 10 and not enough time hear me not enough time with the two if you hang around evil report negative report you you're going to be a negative person a Negative Nancy and if you're not careful it'll just spew out of you so when someone's listening to you regurgitate an evil report give me just a moment then it it just bathes them have you ever been bathed around the carismatic world they call it slime and I've had it I've been slimed it's not a good feeling I don't know a lot about slime when I was a kid we didn't play with slime we played with Play-Doh we didn't always get to have the pretty colors and the nice little gadgets and detachments and and factories that they they buy now for Play-Doh but Mama knew how to make it and Granny knew how to make it and and uh sometimes that was all we had sometimes it was our own fault cuz we Lo left the lids off of our store bought kind and it turned hard I don't care how hard you try to keep the colors separate they'll get mixed up and and so that's what we played with but but one generation after me there was a a a television network for kids then called Nickelodeon I never saw it but I was told know that they're the ones who made slime a famous play uh Toy like playdo but it's kind of a little green it's green and gooey and kind of you know drops down slink slink is you know drops down Play-Doh is is really moldable but I don't think you can any of you have ever played with slime I don't think you can you make things out of slime so I get that in my mind uh I will be honest with you I have a terrible confession to make when I was a kid on occasion I did see Scooby-Doo and and and in Scooby-Doo there were some enemies that would spew what looked like slime and it would come dripping off you you know what I'm talking about kind of sliding down and piling up on the ground I've been there I've been there I've been around people who vomit negativity who vomit evil report and you're just covered with it and you take it with you and before you know it you're agreeing with the 10 oh you're afraid to amen cuz I'm taking so much time to get started you're afraid I'll never get through so you're not going to cheer me on thank you brother so it's important to know we've got to choose sometime we have to pick and choose sometime because I don't I don't want to be one of them who says the the ground opens up and swallows the inhabitants of the promis land not even worth having because the Earth opens up and swallows you so you don't even know how long and everybody there is a giant when as we have said several weeks now just one family of giants see how the devil will have you looking at everybody around you everybody's against me no no everybody's not now let me be honest with you somebody's are and if everybody's for you something ain't right you're not separated if if all your friends and all your acquaintances and everybody you know is for you nobody ever sends text about you something's wrong no but know this everybody is not against you somebody's for you and somebody's praying for you whether they tell you or not somebody's wrestling on your behalf and you you know I know people like to be engaged people like to be told I'm praying for you I'm fighting on your behalf sometimes people like to hear that but there's a time to share we should share we should encourage we should let people know I'm in the battle but I want you to know if you've got any wisdom at all there's a time to stand back and do your your caring on your knees and do your concerning in prayer am because sometimes you might discern that this is not the devil trying to kill somebody this is God trying to bring somebody to the rest two reasons why I may have to break this up and come back and preach tonight uh the reality is two reasons why they didn't go and enter into that rest one they they got under the influence of an evil report and the whole generation paid the price for listening to to them they should have stood up against them just like you ought to do sometime when somebody's sliming you you they may not even be attacking you they're just sliming you with their stuff sometime you ought to just stand up and say that may be how you feel that's legitimate but that's not how I feel that's just want you to know we don't all feel that way I want you to know for me I'm fully persuaded I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that the son has revealed the father to me I'm fully persuaded so you know keep your Negative Nancy report to yourself your evil report keep it to yourself I don't want to be slimed sometimes you you have to stand up to somebody you love and care about and say whoa sounds like a sounds like a p PE to me pray tell brother Shelly what a PP personal problem they're not all for sharing sounds like you've got a p PE it'll get 1 mention if nothing else I'm going to go pray I'm going to live my life in prayer for you but I'm not going to take on your PP oh somebody ought to hear me I've watched this thing I've been watching this thing for a long time down through the years of my life and I've watched how people attract certain kinds of people and and and and how people click up based on their own weakness when they ought to be clicking up based on strengths instead of weaknesses come on but the enemy brother brandom told it right the enemy will try to pull uh you into a little place of straggling behind or off to the side or he may even fool you into thinking that you're running ahead of us I'm just waiting on them to catch up that's how the enemy works sometime and what the enemy does is he comes right in to cut you off so what's really happening is you're being separated from the vine are you calling the local church the Vine I tell you what the local church better be an extension of the vine or we're connected to the wrong thing our truest connection is to Christ he is the life of the Vine but God ordained a local assembly to keep us connected yes and the enemy he'll he'll cut you off and in an hour like that I've said this the Holy Ghost has said it I've said it prophecies have said it Visions have said it dreams have said it we have to in an hour like that we have to circle the wagons and we have to say enough is enough we are being separated from the world and we are being yolked to the word and there's no in between There's No Gray in the are you with me some of you try see some of you trying to be way out there somewhere ahead of what I'm saying and you'll certainly leave here with the wrong impression of this message stay with us that's why I've asked you kindly to look this way it's because I want to see your eyes and I want to know if you're connected or not I know we come to get blessed but sometimes we come to get tuned and sometimes we we come to get adjusted oh you're just mad CA there's so many missing I want you to know nothing could be further from the truth I am so blessed with who's here today I am so thankful that we we are no longer a church that can't function without a handful of people without certain ones I'm so glad that you can function without me when I need to be gone a and in some manner we can function without you when you need to be gone if that's if that's the way it has to be I I'm glad that God uh will help us to feel our respons responsibility at times he made sure the piano was covered I personally asked Kade to pray about staying with us this weekend because I felt like the organ would be a blessing and uh to us and his gift particularly would be and he graciously cancelled his plans to be here I appreciate that had he not been able to do it had he not been willing to do it it we wouldn't have stopped I'm so thankful that we have come so far that even if there is somebody missing we'll just come together and and my what God did I don't know how long it's been since Chad LED worship but he just steep right in God stepped right in God use the songs that brother Cade was singing to lift a burden out of my heart to remind remind me of what I needed to be reminded of before delivering this message to you your worship your praise to see sister Anna Christine come down the aisle to worship today and the next thing you know brother Austin's coming with the baby and Michael's in place and you brother Ellas is all I every one of you played a part yes sir so that we can bring glory to God today even with so many missing this is so wonderful I even question the Lord about some of this that I'm going to do this morning if I can get to it because I think others should hear it but I want you to know God knows I prayed this morning in my off God you know you knew before the foundation of the world who be in the house and who'd be streaming Jesus said uh what what was the other let's see the children of Israel they missed it the rest by two things one by getting under the influence and the spirit of an evil report number two Paul said in Hebrews that they failed to mix Faith with the word that was spoken to them somebody get that reference for me real quick he uh uh Hebrews is it four Hebrews chapter 4 or is it three four talks about the rest but where where is the verse that said they failed to enter into the rest because they did not mix the word the word they heard did not Prosper them because they did not mix it with faith can someone Google that search it or find it let's read that I I didn't plan to use it this morning but I I I feel to slow down a moment and and use this come on folks what does it say can can you pull that up for me Momo can you give me Hebrews There It Is For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them are you looking at it there it is not being mixed with faith in them that heard it because of that they failed to enter into the rest here's Jesus crying out in the gospels come unto me all ye that labor verse 28 Matthew 11 all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn learn of me any message that is sent from God must be a message that reveals Jesus Christ to us not a denominational Jesus the Jesus of the Bible come on not the one that turned his head at your sin but the one that gives you more grace when you need it the most he's not turning his head away from your sin or your unbelief he's just pouring more grace on you that's the Bible Jesus not the churchy Jesus not the denominational Jesus not the religious Jesus that's the Jesus of the Bible thank God he's been revealed to you thank God if he's been made known to you Jesus said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart right in heart I want you to know he wasn't a he didn't twist his booty when he walked he wasn't limp wristed so if that's what you think meek and lowly is you don't know the Jesus of the Bible are you with me sir some people make Jesus looked like he was gay weak CZ he was meek and lowly the Bible said he was meek and lowly in heart his demeanor that moved from his heart to his behavior was one of meekness and mildness but when he discerned that the words of his father were being disregarded are you with are you with me are you looking at this way as ugly as it may be when he discerned that the words of his father were being casually NE neglected or intentionally uh defamed and defiled that Meek lowly sheep toen children toen Jesus he rose up and and he called the religious leaders snakes he did was he not meeking lowly in that moment he was in heart yeah yes sir he wanted the truth to be in the hearts of the people more than anything else so much so that he went to the Cross to get you that's what he had woo he loved you so much he wanted what was in him to be in us and he went all the way but I want you to know he wasn't a he wasn't everybody's buddy he wasn't one you know the you're the best you're the you're the most he he wasn't trying to be in the club or in the click thank you Jesus he had more Fellowship off with a handful he enjoyed that way more than he did with the crowd but he had to go to the crowd to minister the words of his father yes are you with me he said come unto me take my yoke let me lay a Yol on your shoulder that's not like the Yoke that you've carried with the world you've once been yolked with the world but now I'm separating you from the world and I'm offering you another yoke this yoke is not representing bondage this yoke is res is representing relationship you are a slave to me yes Christ but you're not one who wears a yoke of bondage you're you're what the Bible reveals to us is a love slave the Bible talks about slaves who had reached the end of their indentured agreement and were free and rather than to go off and enjoy their new found Freedom they chose to remain at the house of their master and serve him all of the days of their life and they would take their earlobe because what you do to your ear is represented in the from the natural to the spiritual they didn't go and get their ears picked piered so they could wear mud flaps like women do today but they would take their earlobe and lay it up against the door frame of the of the door and and the the owner would Bor it with an all what you use to punch leather and that man would now become a love slave he had been a slave uh being yolked up to slavery to to uh you know indentured lifestyle but now he liked his treatment so well he voluntarily said I don't ever want to leave this place so let me put my earlobe here and let you bore it with an all and I will forever remain in your servitude and in your service this is I don't know where you are this morning but I know where I am this is what we need more than anything else in all the world we need to make up our mind but once your earlobe got pierced through you didn't change your mind then it became a legal ordeal that was a sign that you'd never leave that you would stay married to your vow the rest of the days of your life I want you to know I've already had H I'm about to talk some more in tongues uh I've already laid my earlobe against the the house and I've already had it bored through with an awe and I have fully decided there is nothing out there that I'm attracted to there's nothing in this world that holds an attraction for me like my relationship ship with the one who meets me in the garden of my heart while the de is still on the Roses sir I am persuaded that many folks have never fallen in love with Jesus for years they have gone to church for years they have tried to do what is right but they've never entered into a love affair with him their praise their worship their talk even their amen sometime reflects their lack of relationship they amen more over what sounds like rules than they do intimacy you see there's a vow and we've got to be faithful to that vow right no doubt about it but some people are more comfortable by the structure of religion than they are laying at his feet and I want you to know something you know we we're we're not church church folks if you really believe you're a part of the bride of Christ then you are watching your steps there came a woman to brother BR I'm not even preaching my sermon yet maybe I have to save it there came a woman to brother Brandon one time she didn't go to the Tabernacle she went somewhere else she began to tell him a dream that she had I might be able to to find it if you if you just won't rush me isn't God good I know it already sounds like I'm mad that is not what I wanted that's I'm not mad oh Lord knows I'm not mad I feel passion I I feel like I've got to sound a little bit of an alarm I've got this strong sensation this strong feeling inside that you're wanting someone else to fight for you and you're not willing to fight for yourself and that's wrong folks that's absolutely wrong you can't expect oh oh I might know where it is you you can't expect somebody else to fight for you if you won't fight for yourself oh yes oh yes it may be in this maybe it's not oh praise the Lord if I didn't think it mattered I'd just skip it let me see maybe I can do it here itn't got good and all the time Hallelujah you me just a moment I want I want to share this little dream with you it's part of our destiny oh yes there it is oh no that one's not it oh yes here it is you've heard that before it it happens to be in the message Christ is revealed in his own word isn't that a good truth that's what the word's for in paragraph 160 they won't have it so I'll just read it to you a little lady here this was 65 August the 22nd just a few months months before brother brandom's taken from the scene and a little lady here she don't belong in this organization uh belong in this congregation he corrected himself she comes from somewhere else and she come in this morning got a picture there she give it to my son who was very much astonished I don't know whether she ever heard about this or not I I don't know but she had a picture of this Angel of the Lord a and that that was on the seven Church ages Seven Seals opened out there when it did said look back just stay a minute he's she's stumbling look back through there and she seen that the picture standing in the sky in a dream she looked back through there and seen it seen somebody in white marching forward and behind it said it look brother brandom it was you you were marching in there but here's what I want to get to behind you was people of different colors that means red and white and yellow God loves the little children of the world black and white and Asian or precious in His sight you you know it he said she said to me brother brandom you were marching in there behind you was people of different colors packing banners what were they packing look at me what were they packing what what banners banners they were packing banners you know those things that some of you wrinkle your nose and cringe over [Music] banners banners you streamers what were they packing banners so get yourselves all untangled about what you might see here since it's really nothing to you anyway Marching In Here people of different colors packing banners would you like to know what was on the banners Georgia Alabama what was on the banner Georgia Alabama all different kinds of plac places he said all different kinds of places she said all different kinds of places but when it come time to remember them it wasn't Switzerland Germany Canada Ghana it was Georgia and Alabama those those are the ones she remembered those are the ones he remembered but listen packing with banners Georgia Alabama all different kinds of places what were they doing marching that's right brother how were they marching why am I little stirred up because they were marching they were marching forward and listen at where they were going they were coming up so they must have been going forward and slightly upward W that sounds good to me in the year of mountain climbing coming up into the headship Oh I thought somebody I thought my amers were a few of them were still here coming up into the headship to where Christ amen was was being revealed in this vision and he goes on we in the last days and the last hours of the days do you see him now in his word and it goes on I I I got so stirred Monday morning yes sir when I woke up because I woke up to a glimpse of what this woman saw it it was not a dream or a vision it was somewhere in between but the last thing I remember remember before my eyes popped open completely aware of my bedroom of my sound machine of my fan in my face of my wife beside me I caught a glimpse of what this little woman saw and I saw the uh some people it wasn't just women on now like the preview of the Bride but there were men and women and they were packing banners and they were marching forward up into the headship of zachariah's Prophecy that the Capstone The Headstone will come with shouts of Grace Grace because in 2024 if anybody ever needed Grace woo I do you do and we don't just need Grace folks we've had Grace ever since we knelt down and give our heart to the Lord we need Grace Grace we need a double portion of God's grace and favor hello Upon Our Lives not to entertain us but to help us move forward and upward into a place where Christ is our headship where you don't see or Pastor anymore but you see Christ where I don't see congregation anymore but I see Christ because we've moved up into the into a place where he is our headship he is our absolute he is the lover of our soul and nothing else satisfies us because we have been separated from the world like sheep set on the right and goats on the left and we have been yolked to a Christ who says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest why didn't they get to rest because they believe the evil report because they had the word they heard the word they listened to the word but they didn't apply the word that's right are you wantan me to help you here they spent more time on YouTube then they did feasting on the word of God they spent more time with the with the Fox News than they did with the word of God come on they spent more time with tunes on the radio now sports clips and hunting shows and all the things that capture our attention none of which even those of you who feed on the critics of brother brandham none of which I could say in and of themselves are evil sometimes they're necessary thank God for Google and you you YouTube I start say Yahoo because it's made mechanics out of Brothers who needed to fix their own car because sometimes they couldn't afford to get somebody else to do it so they Googled and youtubed it ordered their part and fixed their car I couldn't call everything they're evil but I want you to know if there's a church of people spending more time learning how to improve their golf game or how to throw their frisbee then they are feasting on the word it's no [Music] wonder they can't enter into rest now if you think I'm calling you as a Pastor to be a fanatic I'm not you've had your time in fanaticism you don't want to spend any more nights in fanaticism but what you do want to do is spend the rest of your life so wholeheartedly in love with Jesus Christ that he is your number one passion he means more to you than crossw word puzzle or word fine no no no no I have I have a Pastime I enjoy my family tree I enjoy that I'm not preaching against something that brings peace to your mind or causes you to rest and relax you need that we're living in a fast paced crazy Speed World sometime times you need to unplug sometimes my watch and my phone says hey you need to slow down and I'm not even moving your heart rate is accelerated and your stress levels are high and your health is going to be in Jeopardy if you spend more time in that place find something to do that will bring you rest that will bring you peace I'm telling that's pretty it's amazing amazing isn't it so we need that but it cannot be our reason for getting up in the morning you say well I have to work a job God bless you I know what that feels like I have one to work as well but what I do understand is if you realize you're not going forward or you're not going upward with the same urgency that the hour seems to to be demanding then you ought to dedicate a bigger portion of your life to his word some of you would that would look like uh listening to a sermon but I want to encourage you that in order to properly place the messages that God has given us you need the Bible you need the Bible you need the bi e you need the foundation of the scripture we need the foundation of the scripture we can't properly place the quotations if we don't understand the foundation of the Scripture A and for those Blowfish who believe that the message can stand by itself I totally reject that as heresy it is not what he preached it must lay upon the proven word of God it must fit it must line up it must Dove tail or you and I have misapplied this is an our to fall in love with your Bible I'd like to encourage people back to your old Leather Bible uh a paper Bible if that's what you have but if you don't get back to that get it on your phone get it on your your laptop get it on your iPad get it on your tablet get it on your CD player get it on on your on your iTunes get it wherever and whenever and if you've never experienced the joy of having someone read the Bible to you get it find it I grew up my grandmother had the Bible on real toore the first Bible that I ever heard uh read by scorby and later by CM Ward if anybody knew I actually met him and knew CM Ward if anyone knew these great voices they read the Bible my grandmother instilled a love for listening to the Bible on a real toore then a cassette she made sure every one of her children had the whole Bible on cassette she made sure that every one of children had the whole B grandchildren had the Bible on cassette then CD and now you don't need neither you can stream them what good does it do to hear the word of God oh I'm not getting a whole lot of help this morning it's a little late now but it's nothing but the truth if you don't understand the scripture you will misapply the sermon that your pastor preaches you will misapply the message that you hear from Brother brandom you will misapply it if you don't know the book if you don't know the Bible I agree when they say we understand the Bible more and better and more clearly and it's a new book because we have the message I AG agree with that 1,000% and you know what you may not agree with it but you have been feeding on it here some of you for 30 years some of you 20 some of you 10 and what I've tried to give you is the foundation of the scripture with the message of the hour stacked on top because that's what caused me to see that Jesus was not historical figure like George Washington but he was a living reality and he not only wanted to do what he did in the Bible but he wanted to continue to do what he does in seven Church Messengers and now in a thundering bride here what I'm telling you a thundering bride when I woke up Monday morning and the last thing I saw was people marching with banners men and women they were Godly let me remind you that they were Godly on the outside because what you are on the inside will reflect on the outside whether you want it to or not the way you fix your hair as a woman will reflect what's going on come on now in your life at the moment sir sir I look folks you know sometimes the way you twist your mouth and face and look at me when I'm preaching you would think that you think and maybe you do that I don't have a clue what I'm talking about but I have watched women under a wrong Spirit literally change the side that they put their ponytail on and discerned in the spirit that that not every time I think it's amazing when folks can do something sisters can do something with their hair and I think it's amazing when they can do different things with their hair but through the years oh it's quiet I have even discerned at times that women would do things like that because they were fighting something they were under some kind of a spirit and they didn't even realize what it was doing and how it was affecting them on the outside but they dress es were getting tighter not because they were eating more chocolate pie but because they were choosing them that way and I noticed that they were twisting a little more than they used to twist like I told these young girls at message you know that family that was visiting here you that are awake that family that was visiting here a few weeks ago uh I didn't know but the little wife who married the English husband the wife was in those youth camps at byc in the early 90s when I was preaching there and she told me are you the brother Shelly it's been so yes I I was and she remembered my suspenders and and she said where are your suspender I said well I got married and my wife said the suspenders are a no no I'm not married to a grandpa yet now she is can I have them now can I wear them now I'm a I'm a Pap Pap now can I have them but the sister said but I remembered they matched your tie and I would preach to those young girls back in the early 90s that you can wear flats and twist your hips to try to catch somebody's attention so that proves to me it's not just the the height of your heel sometimes it's a spirit that wants to get on you that's right to draw someone's attention from something that it ought to be on come on so you you and I have to understand that we're in a Warfare constant Warfare and what we what we are experiencing we we bring that with us when we come together in jesus' name and we want to know that there's a way to to rid ourselves of the Slime before we get in his presence if possible and there's one way I know that's better than any other way and that is bring yourself under the authority of the Bible bring yourself under the influence of the Bible the scripture let this book talk to you if you're hung up in the gats skip you can come back to it you don't have to read listen well I've got a reading plan how's that working for you for some people it doesn't work very well so Find Your Way some people open it up read something flip it over read something else fine but do it let your children see you that's why I said because I I don't often use my Bible Bible at home I I use it on my computer my phone but let your family know not to boast or bra but let them know that's right I'm not always on Facebook I'm not always doing my family tree sometime I'm under the influence and the authority of that word because I'm recognizing the importance of being separated from the world like sheep on one side and goats on another and I'm recognizing The Importance of Being yolked but not to a habit which includes overeating for me but whatever whatever you have been yolked to in the past may God give you a spiritual divorce may you rise up with strength beyond your human understanding and and marry your s to that word well brother it's dry it's dry to me because I'm in a rough place and it's dry to me I didn't say it will always be pleasant I didn't say you'll always read and want to run around the room I didn't say it'll always feed your soul like Mana from on high I just told you to get under the influence of that word and let that word talk to you because the word itself reveals Jesus to us again then we take on top of that the message of the hour and he reveals to us that Jesus is not just a figure but a living reality my testimony about hearing brother Brandon was that he raised Jesus from the pages of history and stood him on the platform and made him a living reality to a generation of people who came around 2,000 years after the Christ and it's what I want to do and I know I can't do that I can't raise Jesus up out of the book and stand him here on this platform unless I am under the influence so I'm not trying to put anything on on you that I'm not willing to wear myself God is calling us to that higher walk uh we're coming up to to to his headship I'm swimming against the tide of preachers who are telling their congregations around this message every weekend we're there we're past that we're finished with this prayer lines are no longer needed tongues are no longer needed things like this are no longer needed so I'm swimming against that Tide while trying to keep a balance I tell you what I'm not interested in I'm not interested in just a little jerking and a little moving around and a little squealing I'm not interested in just physical manifestation I love that oh just leave me in that I'm a happy man but in the end it's more it's going to take more than chill bumps it's going to take more than the hair standing up on our arms and legs it's going to take a transformation it's going to take coming up into the headship of Jesus Christ where we quit making our own decisions and we let him be our decision maker Jesus said I don't are you with me I've let you off the hook some of you haven't glanced this way in 10 minutes I I I'm feeling that upward pull I'm going I want to tell you something I'm going you hear me I'm going I'm going I'm going to yield my life to that upward pull I'm going to lay at his feet I'm I'm going to love him more in the in the closing hours of my life than I have ever loved him before I have to I have to church is not enough it's not enough some people use that as their excuse to stay home shame on you shame on you for using that as your excuse but it's not enough if you were at home laying with the Lord then surely you would we would be able to know because you'd walk different when you show up I want you to know those who are under different burdens and are not able to always be here you need to know that some of those folks don't depend on Church alone right they have developed a relationship with Jesus Christ that sustains every day every day he's good every day I want to hear somebody say he's good every day he's good all the time all the time all the time he's good he's good he's good page one is finished I want to bring this to a close for now I am not going to feel guilty for my tone or my demeanor I'm not don't ask me to don't expect me to I Wrestled for this one this one cost me something and I'm going to deliver it with boldness I hope I have if I hadn't I'm going to re regain my boldness now and move forward to finish because if I'm letting it slip I don't want to do that I want to deliver this with a little bit of the passion I I want you to be able to apprehend this the way it apprehended me the way it Arrested me I got up Monday and I went into the den like I normally do I opened up my laptop and I be to dig for what I had seen and I remembered that it that brother brandom had described this scene but I couldn't remember the details if it was his experience or he was telling someone else's but but I found it and I found some other things and one thing led to another and God just started talking to my heart when brother brandham was talking to close Brethren about the Fulfillment of the tent Vision that we have mentioned to you occasionally through the years he was sitting at a table with brother Arnon West I was listening to a tape this week and I heard brother brother brandham call out to brother West brother Arnon West named after the river in the Bible brother Benny West's father and he would sometimes say I can't remember if you're from Georgia or Alabama and that is because when he first started uh following they were Alabama they were Georgians but but then they moved to the Huntsville area and they were alabamians so I was I heard brother brandom calling out to brother Arnon not remembering where he was from exactly when they had a meal with him on one occasion he took a napkin and he drew out a drawing and he said uh this is relevant to my tent vision our brother West saw the napkin thought maybe even he had it from his dad I don't think I ever saw it or or a copy of it it looked not like tent poles it looked like telephone poles and they were not connected together by canvas they were connected together by by line by wire making them wonder if it had something to do with the telephone hookup because in that day brother Perry green had discovered that there was a way to connect people to the services that they couldn't travel to and so throughout 65 there were preparations made in each City to set this thing up can you imagine in ' 65 the technology was small there were people still on community lines what did you call party lines in 65 can you imagine waiting on your turn to use the phone you pick it up and you hear am I preaching on it I can't imagine how they pulled it off but brother green went to these cities and he made these arrangements for this tent for this telephone hookup to go out so that the services could be carried people would meet in their homes and even in churches with telephone lines and would hear what a wonderful thing back then before there was a television camera you you know operating and before there was was so many things that we have today but the last thing that he said to brother Arnon about this tent vision is that there was a significant connection between Alabama and that tent Vision I've never forgot that as I sat there so stirred by what I had experience waking up as I read this as I remembered this Alabama connection a little bride marching forth and from all kinds of places I'm not trying to say anything like exclusivity no no no but of all the places could have been Virgin Islands could have been Haiti could have been could have been Missouri could have been California I love the fact that Georgia and Alabama made it to the what banners Victory banners that they were waving brother brandham tells us that Christ is coming back with Victory banners waving powerful it's just another way of saying I got the victory woo I don't need a flag I got flags here I wave mine before the Lord because I have found out I don't have to I don't have to do it here and feel him only here I discovered something many years ago I don't know if it works for everybody so I won't say that it does but somewhere in my journey I discovered that even if I'm just almost not serious I don't want to say jesting but I want to say very casually without intention lifting my handso I discovered years ago maybe it doesn't work for anybody but me maybe I'm the only one well that'd be great put that on my tombstone he was the only one but I discovered sometime many years ago that when I lift my hands like that he comes to me my little old granny she said honey when you don't feel like nobody loves you he said you just go in the in the bathroom or or turn on the light look in the mirror and you just say into that mirror Jesus I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love you she said I'm not going to tell you you'll see him you may not even always hear him but she said I promise you you'll Fe feel him telling you back maybe not the first few times but it's some you'll feel him telling you back and I love you my granny taught me that as a child somewhere along the way I learned that even if I was just carrying on and somebody would say something like dinner's ready I know you can't imagine me getting excited about dinner but I would say oh praise the Lord I really wasn't particularly thanking God at the moment for dinner it just become an extension of of of me but I discovered that when I did that if I paused a moment if I waited a moment if I became aware of what I was doing he came he came can you imagine that that he knows hand signals can you imagine that he is so in love with you that he will take god of the universe will take attention from you however he can get it yes he so longs to have fellowship with you that even when you're thanking God for biscuit he said I'll take that praise folks that doesn't sound like a god who wants you to lose that sounds like a god who's determined I know I know eliana's on my watch see she's telling me see she's telling me it's 142 let me read this one just one The Shepherd of the Sheepfold paragraph 56 the day is far spent and you're going to gather the sheep and separate them from the mules from the camels from the goats hear this well and from the other animals that eat in the same pasture from the same word from the same Bible out of the same book out of the same building called Church do does anybody get the importance of that statement we're not all sheep over here eating the word there may be a goat there may be a mule that this goes out let me tell you something there are people out there that watch these services to find something else to spread about us to me you're just a mule trying to eat grass you didn't you didn't tune in to feed or to feast or think that we strange ones could possibly encourage you on your journey you you came to mock but there's coming a day there's coming an hour when we're going to discover that some of us have sat in church service after service eating grass and we're going to find out that we were we were goats there there's a separation coming and there are three kinds of Believers as much as it Grieves me in every Church Believers make Believers and unbelievers I I I want to I I want to be the real deal don't you then I've got to bring myself under the influence of the scripture now he said from the other animals that eat the same pasture from the same word from the same Bible out of the same book out of the same building culture but just the Sheep listen listen you who complain about the number of quotes you you who complain about the length of the service you complain folks you don't do that when you're sitting in front of YouTube you you don't do that when you're when you're sliding down the slippery slope of [Music] telegraph you don't do that when you're connecting Snapchatting and doing some of the things that people do and can do for hours and never even change their position never even go to the bathroom you can sit some of you kids can sit and watch a movie or a video that's two and a half three hours long and never go to the potty but you come to church and you go four times in one sermon wow it's not a bladder problem it's not a stomach problem then it's a matter of wanting to get out to get to escape to have a break and what I don't understand is why we can give our attention and affection to everything else but Grumble if somebody comes with more listen i' I've come today and I don't talk like this often enough but I came today not just with scriptures and quotes I came with a message I don't need you now to say anything I came with a message and it was from the Lord and you'll have to discern you'll have to pray you'll have to judge if it was from him or not for you but I came knowing a and I don't know how long I'll be on this but I came knowing that for me it's life or death to get this off of me I don't want it on me I want it off of me I kept hearing multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision I heard the scripture the Lord saying repeating the verse of scripture where where the the servant of Moses said choose you this day whom you will serve it's the world or the word and if you choose the word it's a relationship that you have to cultivate that's right sir it's not one that you can lay down and pick up and lay down and pick up and lay down and pick up for some of you you come in here and you get under the inspiration of the anointing of the holy spirit that I have prayed down and others I know that's bold I know that sounds pretty but it's a truth because people come with all kinds of stuff and you expect it to always be just what you need it to be and some people never even squeeze a little prayer that says God would you show up today would you meet us today would you help us today would you help our pastor would you help our preacher would you help our song leader so really we if you're one of those you can't complain about anything if you can't take your bones down to the voting booth and vote you don't have any right to criticize the president you have now or the one you'll get next I feel the same way about the service he came today and don't you think that for one minute I think that it was only because of me if you read that into what I said you are so wrong but I want you to know that I know and you know that if we were depending on some of you to bless the service on with a casual prayer or thought we'd be waiting right on out into eternity because we take for granted what we have until we we go off somewhere else and most of us can see that in our deadest moment most distracted service it's so much better than what a lot of people have Sunday after Sunday after you don't have to say anything now we really appreciate it when we don't have it but we're humans and when we have it all the time sometimes it doesn't mean near the same to us but I'm telling you we're as we get into this final thing that God is going to do he is doing he's beginning to do he's moving us forward into his headship but I got problems but I got lost children but I got bills up you don't understand seek ye first it's the book it's the [Music] key seek you first the kingdom of God God and all of his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you I can testify others in this house can testify if you will focus on the kingdom God will get a hold of your children God will help their bodies God will help the job God come on seek you first oh my I'm closing I'm going to give the devil one more black eye musicians are coming to help us close God's word calls this is a message called God's word calls for total separation from unbelief Jesus has constantly told us there is a separation and we find you musicians I want you to listen when you're up here because I may take another minute than I thought Jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that's predicted to the human race before the great final day when we Ascend into the presence of the Lord there will be a final separation he will separate the sheep from the goats and I want to be honest with you I believe this is a barn full of sheep I'm I do I believe you're sheep I I don't want you to leave this place thinking you know he was just calling me a goat because I don't amen everything he says nothing could be farther from the truth if I was depending on everybody's amen I know I'll only get it from some of you when you're in a good mood so that's not the one that keeps me going the one that keeps me going is from the person who who who who has every reason to be sour but they're aimen in anyhow because they're hoping that somewhere faith will kick in there will be a final separation he will separate the sheep from the goats let's go on God will continually has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight he said that's what he always does you can see it in every meeting he separates Faith from unbelief that's what we want the word to do in our own Hearts he speaks out he declares himself to those who will believe him and have faith in him now we find out in numbers I didn't want to leave without getting to this little part here is if it's been quiet maybe it'll be frigidly silent now now we find out in numbers the 6th chapter that a nazarites call now now you know what a Nazarite is not a Nazarene some people say Jesus was a Nazarite he was a Nazarene he was from Nazareth he may have taken at some point in his life a Nazarite vow but he wasn't a Nazarite he was a Nazarene and they're not the same thing a Nazarite call was to separate themselves from all the world to the word of God so there we are separating from the world and being yoked joined to the word of God he said that is a azerite call separated we find out that Samson was a Nazarite unto the Lord now we know by scripture that Samson's Nazarite vow was unlike many of those who took a Nazarite vow many who took a Nazarite vow in the scripture there was a beginning and an ending there was an Iration it was for a specific period of time but Samson was to be under the vow of a Nazarite for his entire life like you and this sign was that he was to wear his hair long with Seven Locks now we know that's not a new testament call because the New Testament tells us that we know it's a shame shame for a man to have long hair but in under this old Covenant that's how a man distinguished himself as having been under a vow or a contract of Nazarite his hair was to grow out without scissors and it was divided as Samson's was for sure into Seven Locks it was a sign of Separation that he was called for a is it spinning that he was called for a purpose you missed the last word that he was called for a purpose now can you flash the definition up there real quick of a Nazarite did you did you do that one for me honey Nazarite an Israelite consecrated to the service of God under vows to abstain from alcohol look a Nazarite like Samson couldn't even go Among The Grapes not only could he not partake in alcohol he couldn't even go into the vineyard he couldn't even eat raisins I talk about God saying you want to make sure you don't he didn't eat grap drink grape juice he didn't certainly drink wine he couldn't go in the in the Groves the the uh Vineyards thank you or eat dried grapes which was very sustaining food dried uh dates and dried grapes were were were Staples but he had to he had to stay away from all that uh uh he was to let his hair grow and he could not have contact you can read at number six with the dead and that included unless a special release was granted it meant even his parents if even his parents died if he was under that vow and not granted some special release he could not bury the dead he could not go to the funeral he could not go into the house where a corpse was laid out now that's a pretty serious vow and if you think that Jesus is not kind of for some of that he says in the New Testament Let the dead bury the dead you tend to them you love them you nurture them you minister to them while they're alive basically helps us to know it's it's not of a great value you can do do it if you have to to to to help your grieving process but it's not of a great value to go sit out in the cemetery and talk to the tombstone I'm just being honest it helps some people but don't don't start depending on that when they leave here they're they're out of here they they love you oh but they don't want to come back hello so nazari he had to make did do you know he had to go to the other side did you know that's why Samson was in a little bit of trouble there he should not have come near to the carcass of the lion that he killed probably not even killed the lion but God said Samson I'm with you it's not in the keeping of the rule it's in your obedience I want to bless you and so he sent a beehive didn't he you know the story and and gave honey and Samson said I'll take it to my mom and daddy because I've caused them enough heartache I might as well give them a bucket of honey uh uh as some little bit of reward are you still with me I'm going to close with this I really am I really am same sermon God's word calls for total unbelief I got to I got to get this off this was one of the things I have to get off of me and we're done but I think today when we see our sisters wearing long hair as the Bible said they should it does say that 1 Corinthians chap 11 a woman's long hair is given her for a covering it's clear very clear wearing long hair as the Bible said they should I think it's a Nazarite sign this is Brother brandom's understanding it's kind of how he interpreted this and and and I put my amens and Hallelujah right in there with him I think it's a nice way of typing the separated life it's a type he said I think it's a Nazarite sign that they want to of the Lord and I know it sounds flat what year was this 64 can you imagine the modern Pentecostal World Phoenix Arizona 1964 he says this he said and I know that sounds flat I want it to go home I want this message to be heard he's saying see because it is it looks like somebody is trying to do to keep something that God told them to do he did in the word he did thank you for your amen no matter what the price what the world has to say about it out there or how many scornful laughter critics that doesn't bother a person that's totally separated from the things of the world to the things of God there's got to be a separation from the world and a and a joint joining to the word do you follow that let's go on they'll obey the word and separate themselves from the things of the world because the word separates them there it is the book it's why we got to have the foundation I know they stand look look look now look long before there was a scroll behind me I was teaching the Old Testament I've been preaching and teaching the Old Testament since I started in 1975 because I could clearly see the only way to understand the New Testament properly fully was to understand the Old Testament I don't believe either of them should stand totally alone I believe they're both both wings of the eagle I I believe we need them both to understand each of them believe it with all my heart so it wasn't about a Jewish thing it was about loving the Bible the whole book all of it the world always knows its own but as I've said that remember criticism on account of the word of God is only what what it's criticism on account of the word it doesn't feel good when people stare at you when you walk in into a restaurant with other sisters or I have three girls my wife my two daughters and four with my daughter-in-law and they've are raising uh Eliana with with their conviction that she shouldn't wear pants either and we're not sure when she'll would get old enough to know when and not to so there's a there's a way of fixing that you can do it like I raised my my two girls we raised our two girls we didn't put on didn't put them on them in the beginning then we didn't have to explain why we were taking them off I know that fell flat there's a way out but he said when you get criticism on account of the word of God I see how they look I see how people watch us when I go in with them and God forbid they have on denim because if they were denim that clearly identifies you as being a fanatic it seems a jean skirt you know that's even a just a pop culture mock they want to know if you're the if you're Dugger if you're a Dugger or or a pilgrim we've even had people ignorant enough to ask if we were Amish remember any criticism you get on account of your stand for the word it's only Growing Pains of his grace and I have to be honest with you I love it I'm not a girl so I don't have to go through the emotions of the female mindset when people are staring but I love it I can strut like a duck when I walk somewhere with a Godly family I don't walk in with my head down like I'm some corn pone that don't know better hello I want everybody to know yeah and we know what we're doing and when they ask my wife if she's doing it because she married me I love her testimony I love when she can say to them I lived this life way before I met my husband when I gave my heart to the Lord I'm giving her testimony the holy spirit of God taught me how to dress he showed me what to do I led him I had rebelled against the teaching of my parents and I didn't embrace it because my parents taught me I had already come to the conclusion at one point in my life they were crazy but when I gave my heart although although let me say in my wife's defense she didn't wear them in front of her mom and dad she had enough respect somebody said that's being a hypocrite no it's called r p c it's called called respect she respect they knew but she respected them enough and there's nothing wrong with having a little respect anybody getting me but she will tell people who ask her you do that because the church you go to you do that because your husband makes you no I do it because when I gave my heart to the Lord I let the Holy Spirit show me the way and people shut up they don't know what to say because they think that every woman who dresses like you dress is beat down and mistreated by their husbands and forced to wear denim skirts for the rest of their life well let me tell you something everybody's not what you think they are and they may judge you and they may criticize you but you just remember if they do it's just growing pains of Grace that's right it shows that you have separated yourself to be a Christian you've not only separated yourself from the world from the bar from the alcohol from The Swinging From The Dope From the pill popping from the wh hopping but you have separated yourself unto from something and unto something else it's it's a Nazarite vow to separate a call from God that separates you from the things of the world I'm nearly done he said I believe tonight that every every man and woman every boy and girl that's born of the spirit of God is a Nazarite under the Lord because they've separated them things themselves from the cares of the world and from whatever the world has got to say you live in this city here where there's great schools and now we see our nation calling for higher standards of Education which is all right nothing to say about that but that education cannot give you salvation anybody like to amen that can't do it can't do it a scientist can't split a grain of wheat and tell you how many different chemicals is in it but it can't a can he can't but it can't find the life that's in there he can't explain it and education can learn you help us brother brandom teach you mathematics and it can teach you history and whatever more but it can't bring light to you your education will not do that anybody believe that that sheep skin on your wall it didn't bring the Light of Christ to you God has one way of bringing light to you that's when you're ready to separate yourself from all the things of the world and all the cares of the world and cling only to the promised word Paul was a Nazarite under the Lord he was separated from his Orthodox Church to the word of the Living God Aaron was a Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated from among the Brethren to Bear the birthstones and to be the high priest last paragraph it is a total separation we're not going to go back into the world no more stood in Marvel about how he had come to Christ away from his addiction he dedicated his life to Ministry on Bourbon Street and ended up because I'm telling you something there are high moments in your life that you can flee from every devil even the smell of a devil send you running but there are lower moments in your life when you are tired in body and mind worn out that one little so you've got to be careful where you hang out the total separation cleave only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in she is separated from the cares and the traditions of churches she is separated only to God and God is the word and as a husband and wife is one so so does the bride and the word become one for the word oh my this is too good to skim over because we're tired it's too good to skim over let it sink in for the word is living through the bride yes sir that's how and and listen that's her credentials listen Holiness is a badge of honor separated living is a badge of honor it can keep family strong it can keep people out of the lion's mouth it can keep people off the Bourbon Street and the whiskey and the every other you know tobacco pot upper downer shooter whatever it's a badge of honor it's her identification it's her credentials the fact that she has let the word live through her the fact that she has let the word so influence her that she doesn't care doesn't mean she donees notice but at the end of the day she has no sister in Christ has no intention of pleasing the world around her because they turn up their nose she knows that her chest is given her for her husband and to nurse her children right it's not to show the rest of the world there's something wrong with a husband that wants his wife to show her stuff to other men he spent too much time in pornography himself self I guarantee it you see it's a vicious cycle and a and a woman doesn't want she wants to show herself to her husband in the privacy of a of a bedroom not marching down the street like this world does my God my family told me I they went to Atlanta shopping and in a in a nice store stands a woman in her bra I don't usually say that I grew up my my family was so oldfashioned my Granny if they ever mentioned it and I overheard it they either called them unmentionables or a brazer you would never think that a woman would wear such a thing to do her job with a little light shirt over and it opened not one button so you could see as she was serving the ladies or whatever their their transaction standing there in their bra brother brandom said those things he said that day would come and people mocked him then he said they'll wear their outward they'll wear their underneath clothes as outerwear and we're living in that world and that little bride of Christ oh don't miss what is being said to us today that little bride says I don't [Music] care if they strip off and March down the road that is up to them I don't get my identification from a society that doesn't know the difference in what is decent and what is not decent and I don't get my validation from a world that don't know which pronouns go to a male and which pronouns go to a female you're going to let that world judge you and look down on you because you put on a skirt God's word listen I know it sounds harsh coming from a preacher but it's a love affair it's Christ saying won't you love me more than yourself won't you love me more than your image won't you love me more than than your worth if you get your worth from the nods of the twisted sick world that we live in you need that approval there's somebody in this house you need you need that approval from a world that's lost her rocker they're having to say things like can you define for me what a woman is what does it take to make a woman what what identifies a man man is a man I think that you have gotten that concept by kindergarten you have if you grew up with brothers and that's the world we live in and yet they're they're elements of the body of Christ who need the work you need you need that dope head to look twice at you that means means something to you because you caught his attention no sir this this wife of Jesus Christ I don't care if she's 13 I don't care if she's 16 she doesn't need the dangles and bangles and and Jangles of this world to feel value to feel like she's worth something your worth is not some diamond on your finger your worth is not some uh spiders glued to your eyeballs something tells me I'm not supposed to see somebody's eyelashes at at 25 yards something tells me God didn't make that women that way on purpose you can sit in traffic and look way across there at the at the intersection and see some poor girl with tarantulas she thinks that she gets her value because some dopehead I know I need to shut up because some dope had whistled at her CUA somebody likes that spider look let me tell you something it's like the it's like the it's like the preacher said I'm not going into that your value to Christ you young girls you young unmarried girls if you've got to twist your body if you've got to lower your standard to attract uh the the boy of your dreams he's not worth he's not worth your effort if he's got to have a peekaboo look at you he's not worth your time he can't buy you a pizza without Googling you he's not the kind of man that you want to train and raise your children hello you know this the little girl from the church I'll tell it the little girl from the church went out she went out in the world she wasn't married she had a boy he had her if you know what I mean and he was done with her he had no intention of marrying her he just wanted to deflower her he wanted to take her purity and instead of instead of it shaking her to the core she said I'll just find me somebody else that'll have me and she goes from boy to boy she gets passed around like a piece of meat and she dares to make fun of the little girl that uh has stayed with the faith this girl's long traded in her glasses she's got contacts now and she's fixed everything that needed to be fixed and when she sees those little girls at the church that she used to be one of she she used to think they were all pretty and now she thinks she's pretty and they're just homely little plain Janes you know so she goes to them and she's going to set them straight and she's going to she's going to see if she can get them to live a little because even if you're right and Jesus is coming soon you don't want to miss out on some of the pleasure and the fun that I've had in my life and so instead of trying to crawl back to God she thinks she could be of a service in helping pull some of them away so she she starts her work she goes back and visits some of them and begins to talk to them and she gets some cornered and tells them how they need to live a little loosen up a little put a little color here and fix a little something there and show a little peek-aboo to the world and on and on and on and and she thinks they're just going they're so naive and gullible you know pushovers to even do like that she thinks I'm going to it's not going to be hard for me to pull them right into the world and they look at her in the face and they tell her we love you and we're praying for you and we want to see you come back to God but we need to tell you something straight any day I choose I can be what you are but you'll never fully be what I am again kind of tough talk in it but it was the truth they were looking she was looking to persuade and Pull and that she thought they were pushover they knew they knew they weren't so stupid they knew what was going on and they said we Cho we choose we make our choice every day to be what we are nobody is keeping making us forcing us we have made a choice and when your choice is Jesus and to follow the world there word and not the world there's no greater Choice let's stand father I want to be separated from the world I want to be yolked to the word I'm not ashamed of a Nazarite vow I'm not ashamed to be separated I'm not ashamed that we have tried to raise our children to be separated we ask Lord that you help us it's not about dress only it that has been the focus of these last 30 minutes but that that's not what it's all about but it's a portion of Our Testimony because what you do on the inside what's going on on the inside oozes its way to the outside we want to represent you in everything that we say or do the enemy is out to deceive to lie and to cheat us but Lord you are bigger than the LIE of the enemy take us uh your little bride today and wash us in your word strengthen us Lord in this house to there it's the cream of the crop

sister father father father every one of us in this room at some time or another in our life we have made a commitment to follow you Lord we're here today we're in this house today because we committed to following you so Lord strengthen my brothers strengthen my sisters today to get under the influence of your word to let your word work in our hearts let it not be a cliche to get in the word but let it be a passion Lord read what our life is about Jes strengthen us to continue to make good choices better choices Lord I Thank you for every brother and every sister under the sound of my voice that is committed so many times through the years to follow your word we're not going back now we're going up and onward and forward into whatever you have for us but we get weary we get distracted we get under influence and we need you to help us today so we ask for each other the the way that we receive strength like David said is to pray for somebody else and my prayer returned to my own bosom Lord through the sisters who have a particularly hard place living in this mixed up world would you raise them up with strength with conviction with passion may you Shield them Lord from the stairs and the glares and the grumbles of a God's Society of for God forsaken Society may they keep their eyes on you and desire to continue to reflect you in every decision that they make may they shine in this dirty world may they cause others to dig deeper to pray harder to find a way back to the god of their childhood for so many Lord it's not about just the way we look on the outside we give you the inside of us the Brokenness the woundedness the bitterness that comes sometime everything that the enemy has slimed us with and poured over us we don't want a negative or evil report to influence us in this hour we don't want the word to all around us not prospering us to find the rest that you made so readily available to us if we'll mix it with faith and let it do its work in US Lord I ask you to strengthen this body I say again I do not believe it's the only place but I believe it's one of the places where you have placed your name in the end time and I do believe there is a holy Remnant in this house that will March into the head ship of Christ no matter what the devil says I believe there is a band of Overcomers under the sound of my voice who will rise above the spirit of leoda and they'll even rise above the spirit of denominationalism that has crowded into this message we thank you Lord that the revelation of Jesus Christ will never be denominated it will never ever be a system we refuse to let it be that in our own lives we yield to the upward call we yield to it right now strengthen whoever it is that stands in need of strength today to keep keeping on to keep keeping on the brothers who have a responsibility Lord for their children for their families for their wives strengthen them now Lord the pressure of the outward appearance may not be on them like it is a sister but the inward pressure the pressure to be a godly man of integrity and character is ever on them find the opportunity to make a living without cheating somebody that's a pressure that every brother faces strengthen them today strengthen them Lord send a Prayer Revival send a burden for prayer in this house like we have once known restore to us the joy of Salvation bring us back under the voice of deliverance we pray in the name of Jesus we fight our way Lord back forward in your name [Music] Jesus of soul tell him me is all consuming fire is in your G thank God thank God it is Jesus I want you to know that I will follow you all of my days no one else in history is like you history itself belongs to you you're Alpha and Omega you have to me now I will share eternity with [Music] you it's all about you [Music] Jesus and all this is for you for your glory and your Fame it's not about me my you God and I Surrender yes you Lord God and I surrender to your your way let me say one thing one last thing to you as you're dismissed to go today let me let me remind you that if someone is standing on shaking ground someone not not fully committing there is a tendency to want you where they are it it's sad but it's the reality you see if you're not doing well and everybody around you is pulling there's something in us sometime that wants to pull people down to where we are we're struggling they're not so we kind of want to invite them into our struggle you're going to have to make up your mind to let your back bone be solid Lord like a saw log pray for those who struggle pray for those who feel distracted pray for those who battle unbelief but don't allow your own walk your own testimony to be pulled down see what you can do to press into the word and to press into Christ and maybe God will use the influence to pull them back to where they need to be I've watched people congregate together and pull together because of a similar struggle make up your mind you're going all the way amen I have a feeling that there are so many of you who have an intention and a and a and a purpose to go all the way and I believe you will may God bless you as you leave today would you love one another we're so thankful for you being here I know it's very late and I have overstayed my welcome and I I wished I could apologize but I don't have it in me now maybe Tuesday night I will feel more repentant but tonight uh today tonight almost I'll just say love somebody if you are stiff and sore because you've been sitting so long may God restore lubrication to your joints may God heal your stiffness and and may he take your pain and and may He cause you to skip all the way to the house it wasn't my intention to for you to hobble out crippled up from the length of the sermon thank you Chad for leading us thank you musicians for adding to this atmosphere love one another just love one another let somebody know we're we're we're fighting this fight together and I Surrender [Music] to your will to your way [Music] Jesus Lover of My Soul God bless you brother love you in your Jesus I want you to know that I follow all of my [Music] days like you history itself belongs to you [Music] you [Music] have me now I will share eternity with you it's all about you Lord It's About You Jesus all this is for you for your glory and your Fame it's
