Description:
Sometimes the deepest hurts come from those closest to us, but like Joseph, we have a choice: bitterness or believing in God's greater plan. From pit to palace, your current situation isn't your final destination. When you understand the purpose of your training, even the difficult moments become meaningful.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there are certain difficulties and situations and trials that only Believers face and here is the reality of the believer you don't mind as much when you recognize hell is persecuting you you don't mind as much when you realize your enemies are against you you don't mind as much when the world doesn't want anything to do with you because what Fellowship have light with Darkness but where the believer is often trapped it's when the hurt when the trial when it comes from the Brethren betrayals even more difficult when it comes from brothers friends family ask Joseph Joseph was so by his Brethren betrayed by his own family blood all blood related and yet Joseph is a nearly perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ Judah could have starved to death had it not been for yourself had it not been for his brother Judah would have died there's a problem with that it's from the loins of Judah that Jesus came right had he died Not only would salvation have not come to all the children of Jacob but Salvation wouldn't have come to you and I well couldn't have God raise somebody else up he could have but he already had a plan through Judah so God preserved his life and guess what he used a Brother Joseph who could have been offended who could have been bitter who could have wanted Vengeance who could have wanted to take revenge who could have killed them all and been Justified even under the law for doing so but he chose rather to take God's perspective and God's perspective said I got a plan in all of this I haven't left you Joseph I'm taking you from the pit to the Palace I've got a plan I've got a plan for your life it hurts you're bleeding on the inside the Betrayal feels more than you can bear the Bible doesn't talk to us much about the time that Joseph spent in the pit but it wasn't a party oh it was I'm sure there were days of pity party you ever had one don't you look at me like you've never had a pity party some of have you been in one a whole week he called me to train you that's what he said 50 years ago when he called me to this work to train you because you've got something to do and you don't always train with a carrot thank God for every carrot he's ever given me to keep me moving along but it wasn't the carrot that brought me to my knees it was the staff it was the rod it was the Whip and you don't even despise the rod when you understand its purpose when you understand that to be trained means to be told and then an example set before you that you can follow that's what training looks like so I have to practice this when I don't feel like when I don't want to it's my responsibility to wna you got to make yourself W sometime for somebody else sometimes what we think we want or deserve is not what we need at all sometimes we need somebody to look us right in the eye and say suck it up buttercup get up just get up and press on
