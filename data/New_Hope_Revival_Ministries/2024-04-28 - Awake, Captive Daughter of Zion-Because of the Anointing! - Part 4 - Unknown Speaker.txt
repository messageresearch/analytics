help and uh his uh direction for us this week we had a good service here Tuesday night how many of you enjoyed the ministry of brother farmer I mean it was outstanding and I thought about it replayed it in my mind and got blessed all over again I've not watched it again but I've played it in my mind again and we were just blessed it just worked out I was not feeling very well at all but I asked for the farmer before that happened and then I thought Lord you had everything under control you did and we decided to get up Wednesday morning anyway just my wife and I boy that felt so strange uh three of the kids in Virginia for the annual tent meetings there and I don't know how many I don't know how many are there but there are hundreds of Believers gathered in that in that Valley and that big old white tent and God is meeting needs and I've heard uh some of the preaching and his a lot of what I've heard has been outstanding and uh we're thankful I'm thankful that they're under the word I very much would like to have had them with me today but I am thankful that they're sitting under the word of the hour I'm thankful they're not stuck in a denominational church somewhere today I'm thankful they're not in a charismatic church today I'm thankful that they're sitting where the full Council of God's word is going to be preached and uh I know needs are going to be met and they have a lot of fun meeting people that I have known Through The Years uh someone offered Joshua a a uh golf cart ride it's down in a valley and to get to the bathroom is a hike up a hill and uh so those Brothers they they like to run it's like byc you know the ones that gets the golf carts they like to use them I think yeah and so here come Joshua out and he he said would you like a ride and he saidwell I don't really need well okay if you're offering I'll take a ride and he got in and asked him uh who he was and where he was from and he and uh brother horn couldn't believe that that he was my son and uh he began to tell him stories I I kind of like to be there to defend myself you know I said well if you see him today you tell him I haven't ever forgot the night he kept me up all all night long talking he was preaching to me I had preached until I couldn't stand up and then he he got under the inspiration and then he preached to me till the sun come up in my room finally I said you're gone you're leaving brother but anyway so we had we had a great time I uh I did appreciate your prayers the Lord did help me and uh so did the shots and I'm thankful this is one of those times that I'm very thankful that I could get some help that would that would uh work pretty quickly and uh so we have had a very lovely time away for three nights uh there's nothing if you're feeling a little low you get a little blue sometime there's nothing like the sun you don't have to be at the beach I know we think we do you can you can sit in a lawn chair in your yard and soak up and it's not my mind it's actually scientific fact it's proof and uh of course if you if you slather on too much chemical then uh you're blocking all the good benefits that you get from the Sun but I can feel my mood rising up I I can feel myself uh being refreshed and we need that from time to time God is good amen so uh we want to we want to welcome Cade this morning uh this is his first Sunday officially since he has made Alabama his resident so let's welcome him we're very very grateful we believe the Lord knows exactly what he's doing his time timing is always just right there are there are many gifts in the body of Christ and there are many gifts in this body none of them alike none of them the same and they shouldn't ever try to be one like the other many men have ruined their Ministry by trying to be Cowboys when they weren't Cowboys if you're not a man I'm not a cowboy I'm not a man of the Wilderness and I'm not going to try to make myself a man of the Wilderness and uh so many people have given up their identity to try to be like somebody else you don't have to but what you do have to do brother sister is rise to the highest point of the call that God has placed on your life there's one thing I have very little tolerance for and that's for somebody who says something like this boy I'd love to play the piano like that that really gets my goat first of all it's a lie you're not even telling the truth you're not even being honest with yourself when you say something like that somebody said what in the world do you mean by that I mean if if you don't even try have you ever took a lesson have I I couldn't afford a let did you ever ask sister Wes to sit down on the piano and show you a lick a lot of these other musicians did see no what you mean is you'd like to wake up and be like that little girl that the go Holy Ghost fell on and she never learned to lick and she just played well that is a very rare gift it doesn't happen very often but the proof of the desire right is in the pursuit right and so you may never play the piano like someone else you may never sing like someone else you may never preach like someone else but you can rise to the very highest point of the gift and the calling of God that he has placed in your life jealousy is cruler than the grave it's the biggest torment in the body of Christ in this hour is self-comparison don't you comp compare yourself with anybody else there is only one of you and you know what I say to that thank God and that's a good thank God and and it's a real thank God we couldn't handle but one of you you couldn't handle but one of me so don't you ever sit on a Pew and measure yourself up try to fit yourself or make yourself or wished or uh uh I would I would catch more attention or or I would get the girl or or something stupid like that come on you just let God but if you have a desire if you have a desire to play you can play you may not be gifted to play but you can play you can take lessons you can you can play I Can Read I can write I can sew my daddy shirts you can play that if you want to be used of God you have to give him what you already possess what you already have and you offer it up to him and you use it for his glory with a prayer of dedication God I want this to grow I want it to bring glory and honor to your name they are very talented musicians who can play behind someone or accompany someone and their gift is for accompanying someone who's singing and they're not lead pianists and then there are those who are lead pianists and uh lead guitarist and then there there are other guitar players that fill in and without them it would sound it would sound empty because you need that filling in and and I realize that a fill someone filling in the strings doesn't get as much attention as as someone who's twanging a a lead line but we're we're in a body of Christ and we're finding our place and where we fit and where we belong and don't you ever let the enemy discount you in your own mind amen uh I I was telling them you know uh there are certain songs that I have wanted to sing my whole life I even sang One for brother brother gy that I've wanted to sing for several years and it sounds simple but I I I talked Mar Beth into coming up here a couple three years four years ago on a Saturday and we worked on that song and it certainly had nothing to do with her I never could sing that song and it really disappointed me that I couldn't I really wanted to sing that song but you know what there there's got to be a reason God didn't give it to me everybody has has got to be who God has created them to be amen I don't know why I said that except for the fact that when I was going to mention Cade I also wanted to mention that there is there is a touch uh on his music uh that is is minstral psalmist like like it it speaks it bypasses my soul it speaks to the to the inside of the inside and I'm very very thankful for that and it only means a different gift it doesn't mean a better gift or a higher gift I don't know what in this world we would have done without sister Laurel through these years she is the most faithful and accomplished musician that I have ever known and she has she is willing to give up her time so many many many times and uh I like to tell that she was in labor and still at the post of Duty I verified it with her a few weeks ago because we had a we had a a sister who's water broke working here on the campground and I didn't think that was Sister Laurel but I knew that that wonderful watch Night Service she was in labor and we said to her I know there was some who said to her you you you know you don't have to do this she never took a second thought she sat there on the piano in labor I want to say it again in labor labor pains not pregnancy uncomfortableness how do you know it was labor pains because she left the and and her background is a lot more conservative even than mine and she's embarassed Ed by talking about her labor it's almost a lifetime ago but we know it was the real kind because she left the piano somewhere over in the service it was sister ny's first first weekend with us from Jerusalem and she left the service and went and had Zion before midnight so you know uh we we need to and sister West you know she she has brought that old sound that has been so comforting to me through the years I miss brother Steve Curry I got a feeling that Steve Curry would would have really loved Kate I got a feeling that he would I can almost see him knuckling them on the top of his head you know and um so anyway and we're just blessed blessed we're blessed sister sha has a song that she was working on for the service and the musicians weren't quite comfortable enough to play it today but it's coming so if you came in and heard it it's in in progress and we'll and will'll arrive shortly uh well Ben I don't know what would it be yeah and I'm so relaxed you know and that's why people are looking so nervous because they don't know what I'm about to say and um I've had so much vitamin C and and they and they know it's going to be a long one they can tell cuz I'm not rushing through um let let me sing uh too much to gain to lose I I don't know what key but we'll we'll get it it's got to be good now since I bragged on you I have cross the hot burning desert [Music] wondering the right road to choose but somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water and if feat is one word I don't use you sing it with me oh too many [Music] Sun Li behind the mountain there have been too many rivers my feet have walked through too many Treasures are waiting Over Yonder oh I've got too much to gain to lose there are two many miles behind me and to many trials are [Music]

right road to [Music] choose but somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water and defeat is one word I never use oh too many sunsets behind the mountain there are too many rivers that my we have walk through to many Treasures are waiting over Yonder and I've got too much to gain to lose sing that line again I've got too much to gain to lose I do I do I do give him praise amen let's thank the Lord for these musicians right [Music] [Applause] now let's stand for the word I appreciate Benjamin and and Joseph taking their time to travel this week to get kad's things and get them back for him because he starts his new job tomorrow Benjamin and Joseph attended church there where Kate has been for about a year brother Josh Bennett and um he found out that uh among those who were there either members or visitors or whatever they were that we have we have a lot of streamers we have a lot of folks streaming a man introduced himself to Benjamin at the end of the service and he Saidi told my wife when you walked in that's our favorite worship leader going right there and she said now I'm up close I know it's you so uh you never know what kind of a blessing your worship is to other people the atmosphere that you create it is vitally important be seated just a moment uh I want to just say something to you very quickly and then we'll go right to the word forgive me but uh I I made a post last Monday I think it was concerning another Ministry some of you may not have saw that uh it it goes out to a special list one I've been on I've been on social media so long that I have some tools that are no longer available and thankfully they hadn't taken them away from me but I can and maybe you can too I don't know for sure but on my computer in the beginning I created custom lists and um I tried through the years when I added a friend or a friend added me to to categorize those friends so that if the if the day ever arose that I wanted to Target an audience I could do that and so I have a group of those who follow the ministry of brother brandom and and there are about 4,000 5,000 people on it and so I uh when I woke up Monday morning someone had sent me a clip of of another church and I like to keep my nose where it belongs this is lots to keep up with around here and uh I don't like to be in the middle of everybody's stuff if I can help it but before I ever got out of bed on Monday and I wasn't late Rising someone had sent me a clip of a of a preacher who was rip raring snorting mad just mad and I thought well I'm I'll listen to it because I may be in it there was no explanation and I dodged the bullet sort of but there was uh another good Minister that I I admire and respect whose name was being called very um blatantly and angrily and and hatefully to be honest with you it in such a way that it just hurt my heart and uh it hurt me in such a way that after all these years of having this this precious message that I really thought that all the civil wars were finished I was in them and I know what they were like and I was really thinking that that we weren't we weren't going to have to go back to something like that but but one of I I wouldn't even call the minister a good friend he's just a man I respect and I and I made a post and I just honored him on that uh list as a general he was in brother bram's meetings as a young man and he is pastored the same church all of these years in Louisiana and when when I am am hungry when when I when I have listened to the prophet and I do that every week when I have listened to the prophet and I just want something that's kind of updated for me right now he is where I go and there are several you who do go to brother Tim pu's Ministry and uh he's he's long- winded and uh he's word-based and there are probably things that I know for sure there are a few things that we might not see eye to eye on but folks what does that really matter at the end of the day what would you do if you found two men who agreed on every little letter of application we know the word is right but but we we might not all apply it the same way and there may be those who have Christmas and there may be those who do some things that I wouldn't do or don't want to do but I can spit that out most of the time when someone has had a Ministry really dedicated to to helping the young people especially and those camps in Louisiana we never participated in them in the early days they were always on Easter Sunday and in those days we were still Easter people and we had special services on the Easter weekend all the way from sunrise service through and we just never really sent our young people that way because we we enjoyed having them at home and uh as the years went by some of the young people would go and they would be blessed always a prayer line on a Saturday night always sister Rebecca can testify to you because she was there many times as a young girl younger woman younger girl how old were you when you were in those camps and and and you can testify that they were a blessing you have done so in your life and uh well you young people get excited I don't guess we've ever had much of that that around here huh young people get excited and they dance and they and they jump up and down and they go through the prayer line and they get blessed and they get helped and one of the things I appreciated the most about this past year or year before last I think it was I streamed some of those camps and uh is is the thing that that brother puit said as the camp was coming to end he said now what God has done for you in this Camp is for now and it's good and it's real but he said you're going to have to leave here and feed that experience you're going to go home and you're going to have to keep that fire burning and and no pull to get people to come there no encouragement to tell people that's the only place where God is moving but but just go home and feed this and and don't be satisfied with a feeling but get a relationship because you won't always feel it so just a lot of wisdom in that and and and so I heard this clip and a pastor that I'm very well acquainted with was just ripping by name and almost mocking in such a way that that brought such grief to my heart and I thought you know I'm not close enough to brother puit to call him on the phone and say you know stand firm brother or whatever you know I but I could I could make a little post here and and just give him a little honor and and a little bit of respect and so I wanted to explain to you why I did that on on Monday if you saw it and I would have done that Tuesday night but brother farmer was here and I didn't think it was maybe the right atmosphere to do that in but would you just pray and you say well would you tell us what it's about yeah I will uh it it has to do with the gifts it has to do with emotion and it has to do with how the church is to operate and uh I have an answer for all of it the prophet told us that every church every Church every single church is Sovereign there's the answer it's it's that's the answer and for me to stand here and call another pastor's name and tell him how he has is to conduct the gifts that his that's wrong that's not my place and call it of the devil or out of order or not the word of the hour is just wrong we don't want to get caught up in things like that we've got to be seed spitters and so I I just want you to pray for those involved because you're you're sitting in a service like that can you imagine sitting in a meeting like that and it's pretty gets pretty tense there kind of a little tense in here and I'm not doing anything so you can imagine when when someone's being targeted by name and uh so I I would like to pray for the for the hurt people uh a sister that a lot of us know made a comment on that post and she said it hurts me so much when when preachers ERS are are attacking one another and you know I think sometime we preachers forget that our words have great effect and they can wound people who we wouldn't even know would be wounded by some of the things that we would say I'm only mentioning that to answer the three or four questions that came in why did you make a post like that uh because you don't normally just break out and make a a post about another Ministry or something but you know there is a five-fold Ministry in the body of Christ and we we we need them we need them all and they all bring something very special to the table are you with me all right let's stand and enough of that and uh I'd like to go to Jeremiah chapter 30 are you up for the word a little bit it's 12:22 can I take a little time great Jeremiah 30 and 8 in the King James it says first for it shall come to pass in that day saith the Lord of hosts that I will break his yoke from off thy neck that's what we've been hearing about and will burst thy bonds we've been hearing about destroying yolks now we're hearing a similar phrase burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him when we look at that in the Amplified Bible and I really thankful this morning for the for the Amplified rendition of this because it catches something in the original that the king James does not express for it will come to pass in that day says the Lord of hosts that I will break the oppressor Yoke from your neck and I will burst your bonds and listen at this and strangers will no more make slaves of the people of Israel does that sound like something going on in the Middle East right now they are hostages and slaves that are still being kept spiritually we have the application of the promise that the enemy cannot hold us in slavery but one of these days in the near future Israel is going to get the natural fulfillment of that promise she'll never be oppressed by strangers again she'll never be made slaves of Again by another Nation or another people and she will no longer be held hostage by her enemies I love the way the amplify caught that and uh I think it's so real and so relevant for where we are today Romans 8 and verse 11 one more verse while you're standing but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Messiah Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated in the message testimony from shreport Louisiana brother brandom makes a very powerful statement in paragraph 29 that I want to open with today and and this is what he said and as I said last night there is a portion and we know brother brandham I didn't hear it this morning but it's very unlikely that brother brandham said portion because he didn't use to catch the r he usually said potion as I said last night there is a potion or portion of word laid for every age it's all the word of God aren't you glad we got the whole thing yes sir but there is an alloted portion of word for every age now we know that there was an allotted portion of the word for the last age we're sure of that and for what God did a generation ago there was certainly a portion of word laid aside for that age that was the closing Twi light hours of leoda and now we are beginning to stretch ourselves out of the church ages toward the Millennium can you say Amen we we know we know we're still encumbered by church anity we know that we are still weighted down by the lukewarmness of leoda but there is something that happens to the believer when he or she begins to Feast on the word there is a a stimulation that Revelation brings that causes him or her to take a bite out of the age to come and and what a privilege it is to live over here still in Satan's Eden so to speak and be able to reach Beyond the Veil into Millennial Authority and take a bite oh hallelujah it's like the grapes that were brought back on the poles out of the land of promise they Those Grapes of escol they were able to get a sampling of what it was about to be like when they took the promised land and so the richness of this word of the hour the richness of what God does Even in our age in our generation in our time is he takes that which is yet to come to full reality he brings it back to toward us we reach toward it we're not exactly pulling it into time but we are we are reaching toward it we're meeting somewhere and it causes a stimulation that that brother brandom said it's none other than the Fulfillment of the scripture we are made to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we never physically have to leave the house we never physically have to leave this realm but spiritually we're lifted up into the word and it feeds us and it strengthens us and it sustains us it quickens us so there was a great portion of the word that was laid aside for the last Church age but even in the lap over even in the stretching period God will emphasize for us today certain aspect aspects of the word that was laid up for the last age it's all the word it's all right it's all good it's all helpful beneficial all true but he'll come by the anointing that's why we need an encounter with the anointing we need the the original logos among us we need that inspiration that will take a portion of that word laid up for every age bring it right into us right into us even this morning if you've got a heart to believe if you've got faith to receive it he'll bring the word right here to you today he'll update that word in your heart it'll no longer just be something you've heard it will become a part of you it'll digest in your inner being and you'll not walk out of here knowing a revelation you'll walk out of here being a re Revelation a revelation is not just a knowledge that we gain a revelation is a transformation in who we are a revelation will transform us from the struggles of leody deia from the battles of the pest house from the Mind Battle of Satan into a kingdom that says I know what the word said and the word is talking about me when and you and I can get to a place where we realize that when we read the book we're reading our story we're reading what is sent to us it's for us and when we eat that word that word becomes a part of who we are and then we begin to be like even like Christ in the sense in the sense that the word was fleshing out the word was becoming flesh does anybody understand that I know you do I know some of you do without a doubt but it's not just excuse me it's not just the portion of word that is laid for every age that we need he said and there is some anointing comes down that projects I want you to hear this that projects that portion of word for that age so the word is laid aside for the age but an anointing an unction remember the anointing makes the difference the anointing is what searches the message searches the word laid aside for this age the anointing is it's what searches that word and brings out of that laid up stored up food it brings it toward us IT projects it in our Direction so that we can become personally acquainted with it it's more than just hearing a tape you can hear all the tapes and be blessed and be strengthened but when that anointing comes and projects a portion of that message in your direction all you got to do is open your mouth you don't even have to chew sometime just open your mouth and God will just shove it right in but youve in order for that to happen you've got to have a a Hungry Heart and you've got to have a willing heart and you've got to understand that this message is not just a sermon preached in any church anywhere this word is the very thing that's going to cause a bride to be ready and so outside of this message it it's going to be Mighty hard to be prepared sir it's going to be Mighty hard if if at all possible going to be Mighty hard to be prepared now that doesn't mean unsaved because we know that if you call on the name of the Lord whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord is saved but how many of you know it's not enough to be a virgin you've got to be a virgin that's filled with the oil you got to have the oil and that oil is not just feeling stimulation uh uh you know hair standing up Goosebumps and pimples no no no so one of the things that that the minister was saying is is is we we're not looking for a Revival of emotion I I would have to say Amen but what we are looking for is something that has some emotion in it because if it doesn't have emotion in it brother brandom said it's graveyard dead then then then it's become a grave so the emphasis should not be on the emotional part of it but you can't take a hold of a Livewire come on you you you can't put your finger in a light socket and not experience something real amen and so there's going to be emotion and just because there's emotion doesn't mean that that anyone is trying to drag you back to denominational Pentecost but I'll tell you something if you've never had a genuine Pentecostal experience you must you've got to so you're not really going back to anything you've never had one in the beginning you got to go to it then you move on and uh so how the gift should operate in the church is is Sovereign it it is at the the discretion of the pastor who the prophet told us holds the highest spiritual office in the church and uh if he were to be a man that he thought he could handle that kind of stuff let him do it if he can't then then put it in a room but don't take it away from the people and quote this misrepresented idea that that which is perfect is come and so nothing else matters you see those chapters are not just speaking about gifts they're speaking about love and by the time you get to that verse we're talking about perfect love now is the message perfect it is until man starts touching it so if you could have been there that night and it was coming right out of his mouth it was as pure as it possibly can that was as pure as it possibly could be but once man starts putting his hand on it taping off the parts he likes did you know doctrines were started around this message because people would take pieces of a tape and there were gaps everywhere at least now at this point we've got a lot of the gaps filled in because there were various copies that people found and most of those confusions are all taken care of but you get editors involved and somebody emphasizing how many times he knocked on the pull pit like what a what in the world does that matter come on now you know or our brother randam cleared his throat I don't think he was sending hidden signals to the bride I think he was excited about the word that was coming forth and he got caught up even like he did the night that he climbed up on top of the pull pit and swung his legs over on the front side and began to rock him back and forth that is quite emotional somebody said well you know we got the tape where he said he was out in the woods he ran around a tree they said yeah but that wasn't in church well the pull pit was in church and you know they used to say Brother Cleveland used to tell me he said I'd just love to be in in the Tabernacle and testimonies would go forth and brother Brandon would slip in and he would Rejoice with those testimonies he would get so excited hearing people tell what God had done in their life and so you there can be order in something without taking the life away our young people need to be able to experience the I hope to see every one of these young people so filled with the Holy Ghost staggering around like drunk men babbling in other tongues I look for that there's a Time time and a place a and a moment for such things as that when the preaching is going forth that's not the time for tongues interpretations or or intercessions like that but there's times and places and uh you know I'm thankful I'm thankful uh that there are those who have come to understand that God still speaks and here's how he does it he does it by the anointing he takes the portion of word lay made up for every age then an anointing comes down and takes that portion and projects that word for that age to whoever needs to get a hold of it I don't know about you I'm not ashamed to say I'm very thankful and humble to say that I'm glad the anointing projected the word in my direction he said and you see where we're at today read what we're supposed to be doing then you'll know how far we are I'm thankful that I know how far we are I I can only see one thing left the coming of the Lord Jesus at any time a Rapture hello for the bride church and we're to meet him in the air now these things has got to come to pass in this day just as he promised he would do it and we know we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that these things are on the horizon it doesn't matter what kind of church you go to people who have any kind of real connection with an experience in Christ are are saying well watching the news the election the War uh Ukraine all the things that are going on and they're saying my this is really becoming a a a sweltering situation Iran hot under the collar all the hoodies and all of the various terrorist groups Hezbollah and those who really Packa punch much much more than Hamas they're all hot under the collar and they're ready they're just wild beasts just ready and there there has to be a h something going on to let us know we're closer than we have ever been before look up remember he reminded just look up your Redemption draws nigh then you're going to have to quit playing Church you're going to have to quit petting your feelings you're going to have to quit that he didn't call my name she didn't recognize me he forgot to mention my birthday you're going to have to get above all of that and you're going to have to realize it's now manifesting time and you're going to have to start manifesting something you can no longer just say I believe it and keep living the same old defeated broken addicted life now the proof is in the pudding you really want to learn to play the piano get at it you really want to be Rapture Ready get at it the word is there yes sir you just Feast on it well I don't have time then you're entirely too busy amen don't let me see you on social media you don't have time to be there come on sir you need to be getting spiritually fat cuz some of us still have some yolks look this way some of us still have some stuff on our neck our neck's not fat enough we got to get that thing broke off it's coming it's coming it's coming it's coming well I want to go back just a moment and and and pick this up because uh and I'll be mindful of the time but when we were together last we went to number and we talked about a this red heer upon which had never come a yoke and there was no blemish and we read two portions of quotations where brother an was talking about it and in one of those he talked about uh looking at a red object through red red through red doesn't look red red through red looks white and in scriptural signs of the time Birmingham Alabama this is what I want to remind you of but remember the bride will be a called out separated and different filled Holy Ghost born washed in the blood of the Lamb she'll abstain from thank you for helping me you're doing so good everything that's filthy around her husband that don't mean she'll sneak around behind her husband's back she's not this bride is not a flucy she's not sneaking around behind her husband's back she doesn't want to carry anything she doesn't want to bring anything into the presence of her husband because she knows he is altogether lovely and pure she is a Chase virgin pure by the word how is She chased wasn't she touched by denominational hands she was wasn't she ravished by preachers she was didn't the systems of church anity abuse her they did come on now was she completely pure when she heard the word she was not she was contaminated but there is a glorious glorious thing that happens when this word comes to you it not only rolls off the ugliness of yesterday but it restores you to [Applause] virginity you know in certain cultures women have come to uh have surgery there is a surgical procedure that uh is require ired In some cultures to restore a woman's membrane to her to her physical point of being a virgin but that didn't change that didn't change her emotions she may she may be physically put back in order but she's already lost something emotionally anybody with me she's already given up something emotionally mentally that she'll never be able to get back from a natural restoration of a surgery I hope that's not too to uh to plain it's actually quite interesting to me and uh because remember that the sign that that a man and a woman have been together is a blood token it's a blood sign and uh that that had to be preserved throughout the marriage and because if that man ever grew tired of that wife and he said I just want to put her away and and he said why would you want to put her away well she wasn't really a virgin to begin with they say oh wait a minute you don't did you forget we have the token we kept the bed sheet I'm sorry if that sounds too plain uh but it is it is a reality we kept the token of The Virginity and we're back well I want you to know there's something about this word that spiritually takes us those who have been touched those who have been manhandled by the church because we were on a journey and uh I had all kinds of responses the next day or two after the sermon Sunday several people I mean eight or 10 people texted they said I don't think I completely understood the question so they begin to tell me their Journey well first I was in the Methodist then I was in the Baptist and then I and you know the list got longer and longer and longer and you may regret that don't regret that that's part of your pedigree that's part of who why you're where you are today what I love about it is you didn't settle down somewhere and stay in a portion of Truth and a portion of error but you said I'll just take the truth of justification and go on and I'll take the truth of sanctification and go on and I'll take the truth of a Pentecostal blessing and go on until the fullness of the word comes but I want you to know we understand emotionally every one of those stops sister took something out of us we lost friends we we we were hurt we were wounded some of us got the right boot you still here the right boot of Fellowship didn't feel too good they didn't know they they thought they were really you know straightening us out woo we ought to go back and kiss him now thank you for kicking me out of your Lodge I didn't belong there anyhow I was on my way to the perfect word every bit of that took something out of us emotionally then we come to the pure word and here is what God says about the bride that receives his word she is a chased virgin pure by the word no matter no matter that she's been manhandled no matter that she's been ravished no matter that she took a a portion of God and a portion of Doctrine a man's Creed now the word and her are the same are the same you are now Justified and you stand here today pure untouched a Virgin by the word because you have become one with that word and as a man in his wife wife becomes one uh I I'm just just wondering just just wondering if you're hearing me as a man and his wife become one in Union so does the real genuine Church of God untouched pure you're not an adulteress you're not a fornicator the word has purified you and cleaned you when he becomes in Christ he the Bible is punctuated with an amen every promise don't make any difference what the denomination says the soul that's in The Believer mind will and emotion punctuate it because it is the word of God it is the word in him speaking out do do you follow me the revelation of Jesus Christ he said that's like the Virgin the word virgin means pure holy unad alterated and Sanctified things that are to be let's go all the way down to toward the end it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there that's exactly right but you've got the word to do that for you the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect I want to skip on the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in yes sir she stands perfect F so it doesn't matter want to make sure we're clear cuz we're moving on for this doesn't matter about your Baptist doesn't matter about your method doesn't matter about your family church doesn't matter nothing matters though though the the word has bled for you she stands perfect virgin unadulterated and then I'd like for you all to read that I don't think we believe that we we must believe it it is the truth it is the truth in John chap 7 verse 37-39 in the last day that great day of the feast this is at the end of of seot it's at the end of Tabernacles Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believe believeth on me as the scripture has said out of you've got a river in your belly you don't have to go find the river you are the source of the river you're the mouth of the river you're the origin of the river you've got a river in your belly Jesus said if you believe on me out of his belly shall flow Rivers come on rivers of Living Water if you don't think he's talking about the spirit read the next verse but this spake he of the logos the spirit the anointing the pillar of fire the manifested presence of God the one who overshadowed Mary sir this same Jesus same one same spirit with which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified but it was never to be another Holy Ghost it was always to be the very same Holy Ghost are you still there first John here let's let's move to this before we before we uh oh no it's one oh No 1 John 2: 18-20 little children children it is the last time and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time we have learned about that suffix uh prefix excuse me we have learned about that prefix there that that Greek portion anti we look at that and we think it always means against anti-slavery means against slavery and anti-slavery indeed does mean that but not every time we see that anti as a prefix before a word does it mean against in fact when we are looking at the word Antichrist we're not looking at at a false Christ in the sense that we're looking at the presentation of another Christ not one who comes to present himself as against Christ but one who comes to present himself as another Christ so it is against Christ no doubt about it but he doesn't come telling you that he doesn't come preaching that Christ is error he comes presenting himself as though he were the Christ little little children Antichrist are here and because of that we know that we are living in the last time let's get the next verse they went out from us but they were never they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us now look at verse 20 but ye have an what do you think that unction is it's the anointing it's the logos it's the pillar of fire it's the same spirit it's what makes the difference the reason why you can hang on to the word is because you've got something in you hanging on to the word it's not you doing that something in you holding on to the word but ye excuse me but ye have an unction from the Holy One and she what how is it possible because he lives in us he who is omniscient [Music] doesn't mean that our mind knows everything what it means is the source of everything that we need to know sir is living in US sir right now give me just a minute Benjamin would you get me a rag something is closing me up isn't he good nobody's picking up any smoke or anything smell are you in my briefcase all right let's go on in the message what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 112 it talks to us about the unction he said it's to give unction to the preacher it's to give Holiness to the group it's to set the church in order was in my in my backpack to set the church in order it's to bring a Unity of spirit all of this is what the unction does gives anointing and unction to the preacher it gives Holiness to the group because we can't earn that we can't manufacture that thank you it can't be manufactured he represents it to us it brings Holiness to the group it's to set the church in order it's to bring a Unity of spirit it's to unite us together with power power it's to unite us together with with love with brotherly love what would anybody want to do without the unction it sounds to me like if the unction is missing we're missing a whole lot of what we have to have so the the the anointing the unction makes the difference we're still talking about climbing mountains we're still talking about mountain climbing and we are not going to climb any higher without any of these different aspects that the spirit of God has highlighted but we're sure not going to go any higher without that anointing to do these things that the prophet has told us he said I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran whatever you are if we've all been uh if we've all been by one Holy Spirit baptized into one body and become members of the body of Jesus Christ there's there's nothing present nothing future hunger starvation nothing can separate us from the love of God the love of Christ the love of God that's in Christ because we are born of his Spirit come on washed in his blood we are a that's what God came to do that's what the holy spirit is for yes sir that's right now verse 20 in the Amplified for a moment but you have been anointed by but you have been anointed by you hold a sacred appointment from you have been given an unction from the Holy One and you know the truth or you know all things because you know the truth that word unction I'm not sure if you have that or not but that word unction the translation of that it's it's the word charisma it's the anointing it's a very same it's very same word 5545 an anointing unction it means the applying or smearing of anointment in the reception of spiritual privileges a supernatural sanction blessing and endowment oh my oh my did you know you have a supernatural sanction did you know you've received spiritual privileges hello I'm asking you a question did you know you've received spiritual privileges did you know you've received a supernatural sanction and a blessing and an endowment from on high Hallelujah and where did that come from where did Charisma come from Charisma comes from Christos amen and Christos is messia Christos is the anointed one Christos is the messiah and you have received something something from him has been smeared on you hello yes sir I mean this is the literal literal translation of this phrase not only in the New Testament like we have here but also in the Old Testament when you think about an anointing you know they don't anoint they didn't anoint in the Bible like we anoint today you say oh no I know that they took off the Ram's Horn filled it up with oil and and poured the whole thing out that wasn't all they did no no no no no no no yeah they poured it right over the top of the head they emptied out the horn right on top of their head and then the priest would take his hands and smear that oil cuz it's not something dropping on you it's just like brother brandom teaches us about the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can get that Holy Ghost on your flesh and die and go to hell right you can talk in tongues and die and go to hell and it be the Holy Ghost doing it it's not just getting that on you that's going to make you have that full Born Again experience it's when that anointing when that when that Crystal it's when that chisma is rubbed in yes when it penetrates the mind and the will and the emotions it gets deeper than that and it goes into the very essence of who you are I know most of the preachers preach that the inside of the inside is the soul but the very meaning of the word soul is mind will and emotion and so we know that that is not the better description of the of the very essence of who you are when Adam became a living Soul it was because something Divine a portion of divinity was added to his body that was dead and lifeless and God breathed breath into the nostrils of man and Man became a dead body became what a living soul and mind will and emotions connected that man to his physical environment but his but his mind will and emotions is not what what he got in the Divine exchange it was the essence of God it was the very Breath of God can you imagine God coming and breathing his breath into you well you better be able to imagine it because that's what supposedly happened to you when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got hooked up to to resuscitation from the Divine and he filled up your inner being with the very Breath of God and I want you to know when that happens you you can't be the same so your trouble doesn't come from that Divine Essence your trouble comes from that which is in between cuz the mind go everywhere the mind has a tendency to pull toward the flesh the mind has a tendency to pull toward the solish realm always self self selfish realm And the emotions has more of a tendency to roll toward the flesh then it will to the very essence of who you are that God life that is within you if we can ever get our emotions connected to the god life that's within us yes we'll have full control of who we are no more flying off the handle I'm going to slow down here now no more flying off the handle no more getting all upset needing a shot calm us down straight jacket come on we just say okay I've got to pull this back this is not who I am the word says who I am I I I can't let this rip me apart I can't let this diagnosis move me out of Faith how many of you have ever exercised that at a at a critical hour in your life let me see your hand when you felt like you were going to panic and and go over the edge and somehow by the grace of God you exercise the truth that had been presented to you and it worked can you imagine that it actually worked and it will work so if you look at this uh reception of spiritual privileges a supernatural sanction blessing and endowment if you were to take a look at the Jewish uh the the the Jewish New Testament commentary and that that comes from Dr David Stern in the commentary of that verse he says it could easily read you you have received the messiah's anointing am it goes on to say this you have an anointing but because of the context this could be rendered you have been messiah messiah given a place in Messiah that's good just think I will tell you now that's very good somebody in this house has been Messiah it's time for us to live like that cuz we've received an unction from Messiah and that has Messiah Us in first John John 2:27 and 29 it's made very plain he said but the anointing which ye have received of him what's the word abideth in you and ye need not let any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall you see here's the difference we're not getting under a Revival atmosphere and dying the next week we're receiving a portion that will sustain us because it's not a visiting anointing it's not a day of Visitation Church it's a day of habitation it's not a visiting anointing but it's an abiding anointing it's one that comes stays in us and teaches us all things and reveals what truth is and exposes the lie and screams at us about the error in our own life and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him boy it's like glue everybody look this way it's like glue yes sir it glues you into Christ and Christ into youall boy that's that's pretty good news news and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if ye know that he is righteous ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him in questions and answers paragraph 107 he said now that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God remember that the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God when God uh become into a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth It's condescending it's coming down God the Father the logos that was way up over Israel he was holy he could not bear sin there had to be a blood offering right in Eden then the logos become flesh and dwelt Among Us and where this Loos dwelt in human body which was the sacrifice Jesus Jesus when man was made in the image of God and and then God gave town in the image of man to redeem man that brought man oh my hallelujah hallelujah I know this isn't new material but this is oh folks this is what sets this message apart I just recently come to understand that there's a there's another division out there it's taking really taking the people back to Tunis in such a way as to say that Christ was not Divine until his baptism to see something like that is is is so is so close it's just a one one millimeter above trinitarianism we know it's not right that is is not right Mary the body of Mary didn't even create the egg if if Mary through through the process of ulation would have created the egg and the spirit would have fell on an Earthly egg I don't know what that egg would have been I'm not smart enough to tell you what the results of that would have been but I know that's not what he said happen he said that God planted he placed that egg sir so am I to think it was just a ordinary egg like any woman in the town would have produced no no it was a Divine egg overshadowed by a Divine Sperma so it was a god body a body given by God fertilized by God it's for us then to say that he was not Divine until the Holy Ghost fell on him in the Jordan River there is a very significant thing that took place that day it was the beginning of the adoption and though he were a son he had to have the same adoption process you do the Bible said so he had to learn through obedience and so he had to have a beginning of an adoption and an ending of an adoption and on the Mount of transfiguration the adoption ended and the voice said not just this is my son I'm going to dwell in him but the voice said hear him because when you've heard him you've heard me that's an adoption that's entirely different but the body that he had and and and to to to be so confused after all of these years uh because people get weary of preaching the same message they get tired of preaching this same message since the way back in the 50s and so they they must have to find some creative way to make it more juicy it don't get any juicier than this right here when a man made in the image of God and then God came down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together heaven and Earth hugged and kissed each other God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship when the logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us oh that's good enough for me Jesus said I came from God and I go to God is that right after his death burial resurrection and Ascension where the body was taken up to set at the right hand of God he said now I don't mean God's got a right hand God's a spirit and he goes on to explain to us in a beautiful way but at the right hand means in power and authority of God that in the name that in that name that in that name everything in heaven is named after and subject to it everything in Earth is named after it and subject to it oh my oh my I just want to speak the name of Jesus do you understand when you speak that name you're speaking the name that everything in heaven is named after and everything on Earth has to carry that name a name above all names sir Jesus Christ now this Loos that was in him we're we're closing sometime now this Loos that was in him I I mean there's some folks don't seem to have even made their way in here to church yet I was kind of preaching till everybody got here now this Loos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sir David did I hear you then good many sons to God which is Anointed with some some diluted version or you know watered down or a little little more alcohol added or little more water no same same same many sons which is Anointed with this same logos I want to do one more with you and that is the unveiling of God paragraph 186 the anointing is a person I I I don't want you to see a ghost I I don't want you to think that that it's a mist or a cloud or some sort of ethereal movement the anointing is a person the word Christ means an anointed one then Moses was then Moses was Christ in his day he was the anointed one that is absolutely the truth to worship Moses would have been wrong to worship brother brandham is wrong to worship a pastor is wrong but to say that Moses was Christ in his day is exactly right because it means the anointed one Moses had the message for that hour it's exactly right to say it that way then Moses was Christ in his days he was the anointed one Jeremiah was Christ in his days with a portion for the word of the word for that day sir but when Jesus came he was higher than Moses wasn't he higher than Jeremiah higher than Elijah when Jesus came he became he came as the Redeemer the anointed one and that was both Moses and all that was in Moses all the word and all the godhead bodily Hallelujah was in him that's the reason the whole temple veil rent The Mercy Seat come in perfect view Plain View he was the anointed one thank you all for being with me he said now notice now the veil in human flesh the promise word to this age must also be veiled notice sin loving church members and sinners cannot see it listen listen because of the human Veil it's going to take a mighty move of God's power yes sir for you to be able to see Christ in me and for me to be able to see Christ in you and we're going to see it we're going to see it we're going to recognize it it's going to set set things in motion it'll eventually cause the molecules of your body to vibrate on higher level than they've ever vibrated on before and sickness and disease will have to start fleeing your body immediately amen has to go has to leave you it can't live in that place where those molecules become charged with the very fullness of who God is then sickness starts moving old age starts having to go away come on and the next thing you know a body changes upon you is that really it yeah that's it we we just we see each other's crooked noses one of these days that's the reason they couldn't see him he's a man where did he come from what Fellowship card does he have what church does he belong to I want to speak on that tonight what church does he belong to see H what church does he belong to what group what school did he have where did he get his education well this man was born according to the tradition or according to the legend of him around here the man was born out of holy wedlock why sure he's of the devil then he's of the devil born out of holy wedlock Joseph just married her to keep her from being stoned cuz she was an adulterous and the man came around and tell us priests what to do and there was God standing there mocked and ridiculed and misunderstood and lied about God was standing there revealing in that word and all they could see was the [Music] rumors all they could see was their understanding of it my God why H has Thou forsaken me the very song they were singing in the temple that David had made them for years ago pertaining to Christ all bones all my bones to stare at me they pierced my hands my feet there they he was there they was standing there singing that the very man dying on the cross and when they got through when he died the god of Heaven come down like he did on Mount sini with Holy Fire burnt the temple veil top to bottom tore it apart and what could they do look right there out of the temple window on Calvary there are there are archaeologists who believe that the real Calvary is the same place across the valley where the red heer was offered and if that is indeed the case remember we just have the words we just have the words of folks Through the Ages that that Gordon's Calvary is Calvary but archaeologist believe that if if this Christ really was to fulfill this whole thing he would have had to die on the Mount of Olives directly across the Valley from the temple and remember the bridge let me see if I could just another minute It's 121 that's good we got time thank you thank you goodness if I could show you this I think you'd enjoy seeing it in the Lord good yeah yeah yeah charity it's coming to you in a in a text I know that makes it harder but just let me do that cuz everybody's waiting on me I think we showed this not too long ago come through can we can you look across the valley here where where this altar is see the red heer look across the valley there and see this bridge that's been built all the way down into the valley to make it and and look it's it's in direct alignment with the with the door going into the temple which is in direct alignment with the veil going into the holy of holies so this is just one rendition this is the most most authentic Orthodox rendition of how the red heer would have been offered directly across as long as the ramp stood there the priest would then slay and take the blood all the way back across if if that is if if there's any truth to that we don't know then Christ could have likely have died there near that same spot and if he did then it's the only explanation because we know for sure that from the position of Gordon's Calvary the calvary that most people go to visit there's no way in the world that the priest from the Temple Mount could have seen Jesus dying on the cross and brother brandham not knowing the tradition of the Jewish fathers I assure you it's very unlikely that he knew knew of this most likely was speaking under inspiration and he said they could look right out there and see Christ I'm telling you that ought to shook him up yes sir and yet they didn't know they didn't know who he was they couldn't see it and there was God in plain view the sacrifice but they don't see it yet today God in this last day has rent those Traditions away let's let's amen that we can't get too caught up in that we remember them we commemorate them we celebrate them we don't try to keep them because to keep them would be holding on to something that has given away to the reality of Christ oh my sir you mean you would hold on to a Seder and reject Christ on never no no you would celebrate with a Seder right to remember Christ oh there's a balance to all things he said yet rent those Traditions away and brought the word for this age right plain in View and they still don't know it they just don't know it see it's just so simple it's so far away from the things of the world it's totally away from their own thinking and their own understanding I want you to stand musicians are coming and I want to read one more and I want you to realize that if you have received an unction of the Holy One in your life you have been Messiah I want you to look at your neighbor and say I've been Messiah Messiah and in that message the Messiah paragraph 22 he said then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah then if we can yield our ourselves to be the anointed paragraph 22 messiah in shreport then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was it would have been last week's we become Messiahs yes sir it's it's the same thing yes Messiah at Messiah little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones oh folks that's God's church he standing light in the he his standing light is the light of Messiah risen Christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out and then it comes back again God's anointed one God's Messiah church if Messiah means the anointed one it means king then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still still I've been Messiah Hallelujah because it was his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his dominion and so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain the trouble today we've organized the church to death we've got organization instead of Messiah light russellite proelite let's add bromite and all the other kinds of light but we need Messiah light yes yes yes what the church needs today the light of Messiah oh I love him for his goodness he says God called Messiahs God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest that's good word God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church yes and anoints him some mess Messi oh my do you see it I do and I love this last paragraph he said the same things he did in his church yes same thing grab me some water please same power he had in his church his church becomes his Dominion he's King over this dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God that's what you were doing this morning that praise becomes so sweet when you realize that out of your mouth is Flowing an offering offering spiritual sacrifices to God thank you the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name there you are messes Messiah little Messiah little anointed ones anointed of what the main one Hallelujah anointed off of what the great one now to say that the anointing is not needed or necessary or as I heard someone recently say the word has replaced the anointing we now have the word the word is what we what move oh my goodness don't you understand that the word was first only unction it was logos first not not word first it wasn't printed page first it wasn't spoken word it was thought first because it was Spirit form it's Living Word it's Living Word that's equal it's Living Word it's not record of word a written recording of word or or magnetic recording of word it's Living Word a tape as powerful as it can be cannot restore one's spiritual virginity but the Living Word represented on that recording when it interacts with a human being a faith it quickens and it becomes alive aren't you glad you're a part of it just talk to the Lord just a moment before we worship just talk to him Lord thank you thank you thank you Lord thank you for your word
