[0:21] [Music]
[0:37] you
[0:38] [Music]
[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:52] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:54] cry welcome to the program today we're
[0:58] doing a study here together on the
[1:01] process of spiritual adoption we just
[1:04] want to emphasize that through the
[1:07] scripture that spiritual adoption is not
[1:10] something that takes place with one
[1:12] event but that it is a growing learning
[1:16] process it is as we read I think in the
[1:21] last time we were together how that a
[1:23] son is under tutors and governors
[1:26] trained and taught instructed and even
[1:30] tested to prove whether or not he has
[1:33] come to that place of maturity where he
[1:36] can really be trusted to conduct the
[1:39] business of the father and I personally
[1:42] believe that some exciting times are
[1:45] beginning right now as the body of
[1:48] Christ begins to hear these truths and
[1:51] they begin to position themselves to be
[1:55] elevated exalted into that place of full
[2:00] spiritual adoption which as we have
[2:03] discussed before it is a place of
[2:05] maturity and we have to come into a
[2:07] measure of maturity before we can walk
[2:10] in this place and I just appreciate you
[2:12] being here today I want to teach you
[2:14] some more through the scripture and I

[2:51] from you to know that you are watching
[2:53] and hopefully that this program is is
[2:56] helping you in your spiritual journey
[2:58] let's look to the Word of God
[3:01] gather okay we're going to get right
[3:03] into part 6 of the process of spiritual
[3:08] adoption we read the last time we were
[3:11] together in Galatians chapter 4 and I am
[3:17] strongly tempted to go back and read it
[3:20] again and talk about it a little bit
[3:21] more but i think i might ought to move
[3:24] on let's let's do go back to Galatians 4
[3:27] however but let's go down to verse 19 we
[3:31] stopped reading the last time we were
[3:33] together way up in the chapter and we
[3:37] didn't get all the way down to this so
[3:39] let's go all the way down to to
[3:41] Galatians 4 19 it says my little
[3:44] children of whom I travail in birth
[3:48] again until Christ mushiya Messiah be
[3:55] formed in you what does that mean the
[4:00] Apostle is writing to the church in
[4:02] Galatia and if you study you'll find out
[4:06] that the church in Galatia was having
[4:09] some difficulty because many of the
[4:12] members of this church the Jewish
[4:14] believers who had received the Messiah
[4:16] were having a hard time balancing the
[4:21] Grace and the law they were really
[4:24] struggling with this and in fact in the
[4:27] in the next few verses after verse 19
[4:30] the Apostle begins to talk to them about
[4:33] the two sons of Abraham one that was
[4:37] born of the free woman and one that was
[4:41] born of the bondwoman it's a very very
[4:43] interesting portion of Scripture and I
[4:46] invite you to read it later at your
[4:49] leisure and I believe you would be
[4:51] blessed by the instruction that Paul was
[4:53] giving to the church in Galatia but now
[4:56] he's saying i am in birth pains I'm
[5:00] travailing in birth in prayer in
[5:04] intercession for you until Christ be
[5:08] formed in you in the womb of your spirit
[5:12] let Christ before
[5:14] and of course anything that is formed in
[5:17] the womb of the Spirit is formed there
[5:19] for your personal benefit as a believer
[5:23] but it's also formed there so that you
[5:26] might have grace to give birth to it to
[5:30] bring it forth what would that mean to
[5:32] have Christ formed in our spiritual womb
[5:35] and then have the opportunity to bring
[5:37] Christ forth from our lives that's what
[5:41] ministry is all about and we are all
[5:44] ministers we're all called to ministry
[5:47] in one form or another are we all
[5:49] preachers no but we're all ministers God
[5:54] has it's a part of knowing the Lord when
[5:58] you when you know something as good as
[6:00] Jesus you've got to tell it you've got
[6:04] to want to help other people you can't
[6:06] keep it to yourself and so this is a
[6:10] it's sort of a measure because if we
[6:14] don't have enough of the Lord in us then
[6:17] we can kind of lock it up but I'm
[6:18] telling you when you come to a place
[6:20] that Christ is fully formed in the womb
[6:22] of your spirit you've got to let it out
[6:24] and you've got to let the good graces of
[6:27] God shine and you want to pray for
[6:28] people and you know when you're this
[6:31] kind of on the line just barely walking
[6:35] with the Lord somebody says pray for me
[6:38] and you say well I'll be praying for you
[6:40] but when you in Christ is fully formed
[6:43] in you and somebody says pray for me
[6:45] you're just ready rightly and I'll pray
[6:47] for you right now because you just want
[6:50] so desperately to bring forth that which
[6:53] God is planted in the womb of your
[6:55] spirit especially if that is Jesus
[6:58] Christ and it and it is and that's what
[7:01] adoption is it's also the reason why I
[7:03] chose to read that scripture is because
[7:06] Christ being formed in us is another
[7:09] aspect of what spiritual adoption and
[7:14] spiritual maturity is all about it is
[7:16] having the fullness of Christ formed in
[7:20] us now I think most anybody out there
[7:23] would like to have the power that Christ
[7:24] had to calm the storms too
[7:27] to multiply the loaves and fishes to
[7:30] heal the leper to raise the dead most
[7:34] people would desire to have the power
[7:36] but the Bride of Christ we are not just
[7:41] pursuing the power we're also pursuing
[7:44] the character of God the attributes of
[7:48] god mercy and loving-kindness and
[7:51] forgiveness and love and compassion and
[7:55] all that Christ was all that Christ was
[7:59] we often heard William Branham say in
[8:03] the past generation great man of God and
[8:06] we have access to eleven hundred and
[8:09] eighty two sermons that he preached
[8:11] during the time of his ministry he
[8:13] passed away in 1965 and we often listen
[8:17] to those tapes and find spiritual food
[8:20] in due season and I remember hearing
[8:22] brother branham's say many times that
[8:24] all that the father was he poured into
[8:28] Jesus the Son and all that Jesus was
[8:32] which is also all the father was he
[8:35] poured into the church body and and that
[8:39] is for me that is an amazing revelation
[8:42] to know that all that Christ is if he is
[8:46] fully formed in me is available to me I
[8:50] have access to all that Christ is let's
[8:54] not say was all that Christ is and
[8:57] that's what the world is in need of the
[9:00] world needs what Christ is his truth he
[9:04] is truth he is the spirit of truth
[9:07] there's something about the truth of the
[9:10] Messiah that sets captives free that
[9:14] breaks bondages and yolks in people's
[9:17] lives that there's something about the
[9:20] truth of of Jesus the Messiah that that
[9:24] causes demons to flee and disease
[9:27] trembles and shrieks away and so many
[9:31] powerful demonstrations are possible
[9:35] when Jesus is allowed to have his way
[9:38] and he wants to work
[9:41] through us he will work around us if he
[9:44] has to but it is his desire to work
[9:48] through us and I believe it's the desire
[9:50] of every spirit-filled believer to have
[9:53] the Lord Jesus Christ fully formed in us
[9:57] now I want to read a few scriptures I
[9:59] won't get probably too far in teaching
[10:02] on these scriptures but I want to go
[10:05] ahead and get them to you and then the
[10:07] next time we meet together we'll talk
[10:09] about them the reason why I'm reading
[10:11] them is I want to show you what I
[10:13] believe is part of the adoption process
[10:17] even in the life of the Lord Jesus
[10:20] Christ now some people really have a
[10:24] problem with that Jesus was the son of
[10:27] God he was Mashiach the Messiah how is
[10:31] it that he would have a need to be
[10:32] adopted well let's look at the scripture
[10:35] let's look at Hebrews chapter 5 verses 8
[10:38] through 10 and maybe you'll see what I'm
[10:41] talking about Hebrews chapter 5 verses 8
[10:45] through 10 though he were a son this is
[10:49] established he was a son of God yet
[10:54] learned he obedience by the things which
[10:59] he suffered now let's compare that real
[11:03] quickly with Galatians for one now I say
[11:06] that the air as long as he as a child
[11:10] differ if nothing from a servant though
[11:13] he be Lord of all verse 2 but it's under
[11:15] tutors and governors until the time
[11:17] appointed of the father now we hear a
[11:20] real comparison not a comparison but a
[11:26] week we hear the same concept being
[11:30] spoken about in both of these scriptures
[11:33] not a contrast but these scriptures are
[11:37] companion scriptures because we see that
[11:39] what's happening in the natural with a
[11:41] natural born son was also happening with
[11:44] the Messiah the Son of the Living God
[11:47] though we were a son in the natural
[11:50] though he is a son though someone is the
[11:53] son he still needs governor
[11:54] and tutors to help him get to the place
[11:56] where he is then adopted or are
[12:01] celebrated by the father at the time
[12:04] appointed and over here we see Jesus
[12:07] being the son of God but learning
[12:09] obedience being trained in obedience and
[12:14] how did he get that training by the
[12:17] things which he suffered though he were
[12:20] a son yet learned he obedience by the
[12:23] things which he suffered and being made
[12:26] perfect being made perfect he became the
[12:30] author of eternal salvation unto all
[12:34] them that obey Him called of God a high
[12:38] priest after the order of Melchizedek so
[12:43] there was even a process of full
[12:47] spiritual adoption in the life of the
[12:51] Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ now when
[12:54] did that start well really the process
[12:59] that we'll talk about in a few weeks in
[13:01] the Jewish faith it starts with
[13:04] circumcision it begins eight days old
[13:07] the this the first ceremony of the
[13:10] beginning of the process is circumcision
[13:14] and then some years later as as a
[13:17] teenager we have the the Bar Mitzvah
[13:21] this celebration that this child has has
[13:25] come to a certain place of maturity and
[13:28] he is now celebrated as a son of the
[13:32] commandments a student of the law but
[13:37] already having some maturity because
[13:41] anyone who knows about the process
[13:43] preceding Bar Mitzvah knows that they're
[13:45] studying of the laws and the
[13:47] commandments of God that are very very
[13:50] important part of the process to get to
[13:53] that place but then there is another
[13:55] celebration of maturity that takes place
[13:58] at about the age of 30 and some of this
[14:01] was borrowed from from Greek and Roman
[14:04] culture but it was happening
[14:07] in the time of Yeshua in in Second
[14:11] Temple Jerusalem we see that happening
[14:14] now excuse me Matthew chapter 3 which
[14:19] where we want to read now and I want to
[14:22] show you that the the beginning of part
[14:28] of this process happen when our Lord was
[14:32] being baptized by John the Baptist and I
[14:37] want to read all of the places Matthew
[14:41] Mark and Luke where it talks about this
[14:45] baptism but will only do a few verses so
[14:47] I hope maybe you're familiar with this
[14:49] Matthew chapter 3 verses 16 and 17 and
[14:54] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[14:58] straightway out of the water now this is
[15:02] a clear indication that he wasn't
[15:04] sprinkled because he came up out of the
[15:08] water which would have been more like
[15:11] the tradition of the day which was the
[15:13] Jewish mikvah the immersion this very
[15:17] holy sacred time of cleansing and a
[15:22] symbol of cleansing and so Jesus when he
[15:25] was baptized went up straightway out of
[15:27] the water and lo the heavens were opened
[15:30] upon him or unto him and he saw the
[15:33] Spirit of God descending like a dove now
[15:37] there was not a dove that came and
[15:39] appeared over the head of the Lord Jesus
[15:41] Christ the scripture said it was the
[15:44] Spirit of God descending like a dove in
[15:48] the manner of a dove and lighting upon
[15:51] him the Spirit of God descending like a
[15:54] dove and lighting upon him and lo a
[15:58] voice from heaven saying this is my
[16:02] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[16:09] now this is a it's a beautiful type it's
[16:15] a beautiful type of the Father God
[16:18] announcing that this
[16:21] is my son I want you to know this is my
[16:25] son one of the other translations of the
[16:29] New Testament says this is my beloved
[16:32] Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in
[16:36] King James it says in whom I am well
[16:39] pleased but another translation says in
[16:42] whom I am pleased to dwell I think
[16:45] that's even a more accurate translation
[16:47] actually look at mark chapter 1 verses
[16:50] 10 and 11 and straightway coming up out
[16:53] of the water he saw the heavens open and
[16:56] the spirit like a dove descending upon
[16:59] him and there came a voice from heaven
[17:02] saying thou art my beloved Son in whom I
[17:06] am well pleased or again in whom I am
[17:10] pleased to dwell and then the third
[17:14] place that we read about the baptism of
[17:16] Yeshua was in Luke chapter 3 verses 21
[17:20] and 22 now when all the people were
[17:22] baptized it came to pass that Jesus also
[17:26] being baptized and praying the heaven
[17:29] was open and the Holy Ghost descended in
[17:33] a bodily shape like a dove upon him so
[17:37] now we've got more of a description it
[17:40] was a physical form like enough and
[17:43] descended upon him and a voice came from
[17:46] heaven which said thou art my beloved
[17:50] Son in the I am well pleased so three
[17:56] different tellings of the baptism of the
[18:00] Lord Jesus Christ by John the Baptist
[18:02] but although a slight variation in the
[18:05] word wording but much consistency in
[18:10] what happened now I want you to go
[18:13] forward a period of time this was the
[18:15] beginning this was we you know we read
[18:19] about him in the temple and we're going
[18:21] to read that in another program we read
[18:24] about him in the temple as a young lad
[18:26] and and then there was not a lot written
[18:29] about his life until this point where he
[18:34] sort of came out of the like John the
[18:37] Baptist was called out of the wilderness
[18:39] to introduce the coming of the Messiah
[18:42] the lamb of God which taketh away the
[18:43] sins of the world and in like manner the
[18:46] Lord Jesus grew up and he matured in the
[18:49] home of his earthly father Joseph and he
[18:52] was taught many things as probably as
[18:55] The Apprentice of a carpenter and and
[18:58] there were some other things that were
[18:59] going on in his life that we don't
[19:01] really read about it it's not until his
[19:05] baptism that we really see the the
[19:08] beginning of his ministry the beginning
[19:11] of his earthly ministry now there are
[19:13] movies that were made that showed Jesus
[19:16] working miracles when he was a child and
[19:18] turning little clay pigeons into real
[19:20] pigeons and so forth and if you want to
[19:23] believe that then that's perfectly all
[19:25] right with me but I don't believe that
[19:27] that that that's how the early life of
[19:30] Jesus Christ was I do believe there were
[19:32] some supernatural things going on in his
[19:34] life I believe he had supernatural
[19:36] knowledge and wisdom of his father's
[19:39] business we see that in the scripture
[19:41] but I believe that it was not until this
[19:43] baptism this public celebration of who
[19:48] he was that he really started
[19:51] functioning in his destiny as the
[19:54] Messiah although all along he was the
[19:57] Living God made flesh but now he was
[20:00] coming to his his hour to his season
[20:03] let's look at Matthew chapter 17 verses
[20:07] 1 through 9 now we're going to read two
[20:11] or three tellings of the Mount of
[20:14] Transfiguration we just did three on the
[20:16] baptism we're going to do three on the
[20:18] Mount of Transfiguration I just want
[20:20] them in your spirit I want you to it's a
[20:23] good idea to make notes and to write
[20:24] down where these things are found
[20:26] Matthew chapter 17 verses 1 through 9
[20:29] and after six days Jesus taketh Peter
[20:32] James and John his brother and bringeth
[20:35] them up into a high mountain apart and
[20:38] was transfigured before them and his
[20:41] face did shine as the Sun and his
[20:44] raiment was white as the light and meh
[20:48] old there appeared unto them Moses and
[20:51] Elijah talking with him then answered
[20:55] Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is
[20:58] good for us to be here if thou will let
[21:02] us make here three Tabernacles one for
[21:04] the one for Moses and one for Elijah and
[21:07] while he yet spake behold a bright cloud
[21:11] overshadowed them and behold a voice out
[21:15] of the cloud which said this is my
[21:19] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[21:24] now we've got the same salutation from
[21:27] the voice of the Spirit of the Father
[21:29] that that came upon him during his
[21:32] baptism but three words are added to
[21:37] that salutation this is my beloved Son
[21:40] in whom I am well pleased hear ye him
[21:46] now those three words just three little
[21:49] tiny words are extremely significant
[21:51] because whatever happened between the
[21:55] baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua
[21:57] and this Mount of Transfiguration that
[22:00] we start reading about in Matthew 17
[22:02] whatever happened during that span of
[22:05] time he was now in a place like many
[22:09] sons in Israel during that time at about
[22:13] the age of 30 years olds give or take a
[22:16] little bit it was according to the to
[22:18] the child to the man the young man
[22:21] growing up and according to the will of
[22:22] his earthly father this ceremony would
[22:26] take place where the young man would be
[22:30] celebrated publicly at the gate of the
[22:32] city i'm going to show you that in a net
[22:35] and in one of the future broadcast and
[22:38] and basically these very words would be
[22:41] spoken over him this is my beloved son
[22:44] the father would take his hands and put
[22:45] it on the head of his son publicly in
[22:48] front of witnesses at the gate of the
[22:49] city and basically he would say this is
[22:52] my beloved son i'm pleased with him here
[22:55] he him meaning he is now authorized to
[23:00] conduct business
[23:02] my behalf and this appears to be what
[23:07] was happening to our Lord Jesus Christ
[23:09] in Matthew 17 now I have to hurry to get
[23:13] in these other readings so that we can
[23:16] spend the next program teaching from
[23:18] them mark chapter 9 verses two through
[23:20] eight and after six days Jesus taketh
[23:23] with him Peter James and John leadeth
[23:26] them up into a high mountain apart by
[23:28] themselves he was transfigured before
[23:30] them and his raiment became shining
[23:33] exceeding white as snow so as know
[23:36] fuller on earth can wipe them and there
[23:39] appeared unto them Elijah and Moses and
[23:41] they were talking with Jesus and Peter
[23:43] answered and said to Jesus master it is
[23:46] good for us to be here and let us make
[23:48] three Tabernacles one for the one for
[23:50] Moses and one for Elijah almost
[23:52] identical to what Matthew recorded for
[23:55] he whisked not what to say for they were
[23:58] sore afraid now there's a little bit of
[24:00] a different explanation there because
[24:02] now we know why Peter made this
[24:05] statement because he was afraid he
[24:07] didn't know what to say here he is
[24:10] standing on the Mount of what we call
[24:13] now the Mount of Transfiguration some
[24:15] people believe that was mount a bore and
[24:16] others are like me who believe it was
[24:18] mount her moan but whether it was table
[24:21] or her moan it happened and it was on a
[24:23] mountain and and Jesus was there and
[24:26] Peter James and John were there and
[24:28] supernaturally Moses and Elijah showed
[24:31] up now that we've got and and Peter
[24:34] makes this statement and I hear people
[24:36] criticizing Peter misunderstanding Peter
[24:39] all the time and who knows what I would
[24:41] have said if I would have been there but
[24:43] mark explains some of Peters babbling a
[24:47] little bit and he said for he Wis not
[24:49] what to say he didn't know what to say
[24:51] what do you say in a moment like that
[24:52] and and it says because they were sore
[24:56] afraid alright and there was a cloud
[24:58] that overshadowed them and a voice came
[25:02] out of that cloud saying this is my
[25:05] beloved son hear him now mark does not
[25:11] record the phrase in whom I am well
[25:13] pleased Matthew does mark leaves that
[25:16] out Matthew says this is my beloved Son
[25:19] in whom I am well pleased here you him
[25:21] mark says this is my beloved son hear
[25:24] him in either case though the the
[25:28] additional word here you him or hear him
[25:31] was added to what was spoken over him at
[25:34] his baptism I think I've got time maybe
[25:37] to get in the third reference it would
[25:40] be very good to start off the next
[25:42] program being able to teach from these
[25:43] scriptures without reading them into the
[25:45] record so we'll do that real quick Luke
[25:48] 9 verses 28 through 36 and it came to
[25:52] pass about eight days after these things
[25:54] he took Peter James and John and went up
[25:58] into a mountain to pray and as he prayed
[26:00] the fashion of his countenance was
[26:03] altered and his raiment was white and
[26:07] glistering and behold there talked with
[26:10] him two men which were Moses and Elijah
[26:12] who appeared in glory and speak of his
[26:16] decease which he should accomplish at
[26:18] Jerusalem Luke tells us part of the
[26:22] conversation they were speaking to him
[26:25] about what was to take place in
[26:28] Jerusalem concerning Yeshua now that's
[26:32] why I thought it was so important to
[26:34] read all three tellings because
[26:36] basically the facts remain consistent
[26:38] but we get a little bit more information
[26:41] here we know a little bit about what
[26:43] they were talking about the other riders
[26:44] just say they were talking but here we
[26:47] find out that that one of the topics of
[26:49] discussion was that his decease which he
[26:52] should accomplish at Jerusalem but Peter
[26:54] and they that were with him were heavy
[26:57] with sleep and when they were awake they
[27:00] fell asleep at some point here they saw
[27:02] his glory and the two men that stood
[27:05] with him and it came to pass as they
[27:07] departed from him Peter said unto Jesus
[27:10] master it is good for us to be here and
[27:13] let us make three Tabernacles one for me
[27:15] and one for Moses and one for Elijah not
[27:18] knowing when he said so again that's
[27:21] kind of similar to what Mark had said
[27:23] while he thus spake there came a cloud
[27:26] and overshadowed them and they feared
[27:29] they entered into the cloud now that is
[27:35] an interesting addition to the story the
[27:39] cloud came down overshadowed them not
[27:44] just him overshadowed them and they
[27:48] feared as they entered into the cloud
[27:52] all of them entered into the cloud and
[27:57] there came a voice out of the cloud
[27:59] saying this is my beloved son hear him
[28:03] and when the voice was passed Jesus was
[28:06] found alone and they kept it close and
[28:08] told no man in those days any of those
[28:10] things which they had seen now when we
[28:13] meet again we're going to talk about
[28:15] this process of adoption in the life of
[28:18] the Lord Jesus Christ father thank you
[28:20] for letting us be together today bring
[28:22] your word to living reality in our lives
[28:26] in this day in the wonderful name of the
[28:28] Lord Jesus Yeshua we pray amen I have to
[28:32] hurry thank you so much for watching the
[28:34] Eagles cry tune in again next time will
