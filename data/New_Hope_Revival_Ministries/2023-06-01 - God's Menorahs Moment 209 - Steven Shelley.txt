Description:
When the Holy Ghost fell on the people on the day of Pentecost, cloven tongues of Fire fell on them and it changed them forever.  That Fire spilled over on to the streets of Jerusalem and the uttermost parts of the earth.

God is looking for believers of this Truth who will burn with that same passion.  May we all and allow the Fire of the Holy Ghost to so consume us, that it will spill over into the nations.  We must catch that vision and bring freedom and deliverance by the power of the Holy Ghost to a dying world.
