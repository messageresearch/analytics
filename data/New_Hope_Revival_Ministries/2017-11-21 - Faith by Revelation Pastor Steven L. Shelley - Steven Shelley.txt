TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello there I'm pastor Shelly from the New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm excited to be able to speak to you today on the gospel channel the Lord has established a great friendship and a wonderful partnership with the gospel Channel and we've had great fellowship with those brothers and the precious staff there for a number of years now and now that God has blessed us with a studio of our own in Alabama United States of America we're able to come to you a little more often in this format and I hope that you are tuning in to our program the Eagles cry I believe that the Lord has used it to encourage many of you out there and I also believe that he's going to use it in more profound ways in days to come and I'm excited about that I remember the first time I went to Iceland and met those brothers and saw what they were doing in the vision that they had this tiny little island less than 350,000 people and at that time there were 300,000 tourists that would come every year now I think they're probably even more tourists than ever and that excites me and I I met these people who had a desire to take the gospel not just to Iceland but all across the world and God opened the doors and they've been available to you across the United Kingdom now for for multiple years and expanding all the time by the grace of God we're just so thankful for what he's doing we'd like for you to partner with them in prayer and with your finances if the Lord lays on your heart to sow into the gospel channel then that also makes it available for us to be able to come to you from Alabama on a regular basis these folks are just dedicated to getting the gospel to you to encourage you you know we understand that there are people who will be surfing channels and they will see this and maybe it will catch their eye maybe not but we also believe that by the Spirit of the Lord we can pray a prayer in and you can be arrested to hear what you need to hear I've had many testimonies through the years of people saying I was just flipping the channels and something drew me and so we have a great opportunity if you're a believer you're Christian watching this program we need to partner together in faith and we need to believe that God will use this ministry this television outreach to speak to whoever it is that the Lord has on his heart whoever it is that he wants to be spoken to for such a time as this because we recognize that the Lord deals with this people in cycles and seasons you know what I found is that God will speak to us he will make certain truths certain portions of Scripture come alive at certain seasons of our life and had we come across that truth that revelation months before years before it might have just gone right over our head but years later it comes around it's exactly what we need at the time and it lays upon a foundation line upon line precept upon precept so I'm just excited for an opportunity to to come to greet you to share what's on our heart and to come without pressure you know I have no reputation that I'm trying to maintain I just want to be a servant of Jesus Christ in the end time and I had no ambition I can assure you I had no ambition for television it was not something that was really on my grid that first time that the Lord gave a prophecy and said I'm going to put you there we come from a conservative community of faith and and most people that we're in fellowship with don't even have television in their homes and haven't had them for many years raising their children and yet we realize that with all the evil and with all the junk that can be made available by television it's also a glorious tool to speak to you reach you and to reach literally millions of people like you I remember one time some years ago we were on the gospel channel doing some programming and it may have been our own program the Eagles cry I was actually in Israel at the time that these programs were airing the apartment that we maintained in Jerusalem in the neighborhood of French Hill and an email came in and the email was from the Palestinian territory it was from Ramallah and the truth is Ramallah is only a few miles from the neighborhood where our apartment is but because of the conflict and because of everything that was going on at that time it would have been very difficult for me to have gone into Ramallah knocking on door to door witnessing for Jesus Christ it would have almost been impossible at that particular moment and yet this email comes in from Ramallah telling us what life and what hope was offered by the television program that they saw I'm telling you it excited me then and it excites me to mention it again now because that's the gift that God has given us with television and so we just we just believe that you've got loved ones that you'd like to see saved that you'd like to say born again and they may not ever watch Christian television but while you're praying for them to be saved also pray for somebody else's loved one who might come across the gospel channel or other channels out there where they may hear the gospel especially in an uncompromised manner for the hour that we're living in the bold truth of God's Word is important and it's what people need I find that people are not looking for pretense they're certainly not looking for hypocrisy they're looking for sincere faith and the real character of Jesus Christ to be on display that's our desire and I believe it's the desire of many people who are doing this for a Astri so by you praying for your loved ones we're partnering with you asking God to bring your loved ones in you can also pray for other people's loved ones that might come across this program or other programs on the gospel channel so that way we form a network in prayer and in faith standing together if you have particular prayer needs that you'd like for us to pray about we invite you to call the number on your screen or send an email the one thing I will commit to you is that we will pray individually over your prayer requests I believe that if you send a need and you care enough and you have enough confidence in us to send it this way it's the least that we can do to join together with you in faith and I'm gonna do more than that I'm gonna tell you I expect the testimony I expect a report whenever you get a chance to say God's moving maybe the whole victory is not here yet keep praying and that's exactly what we'll do you see we're in this thing together we're living in the end time and things are very serious out there and if there's ever been a time that we need to draw together exercising our faith and coming together in fellowship with truth this is the hour and so again I just greet you and I'm telling you I'm extremely blessed and excited to be coming to you again today one of the times we were together recently it was a transparent time for me I began to talk about something that was going on in our own faith community where God was speaking to us about how that through the years of waiting on the promises of God to come to pass that it's easy for your hope to become deferred for it to be seized upon by the enemy who wants to discourage us and what happens is in that moment the level of our unbelief starts creeping up a little higher and a little higher until actually there's more unbelief than there is faith now I want you to know that it doesn't take a lot of faith it takes faith to every man is given the measure of faith then faith is certainly like a muscle the more you exercise it the stronger it gets but I don't ever want you to look at faith like I don't have enough I need to get more if I would have had more faith my loved one would have been healed or particular tragedy would have been adverted wouldn't have happened I don't think that's the way God wants us looking at faith I think that there are different levels of faith and even different kinds of faith I think there are different administration's of faith and I just want to talk about that with you a little bit today we did a series I think one time on the Eagles cry about the difference between intellectual faith and faith by revelation I just want to share a little bit of that with the audience today because I truly believe that once faith moves from the realm of just an intellectual concept into that realm or into that dimension of revealed faith by the Spirit of God I believe it changes things in fact as I was thinking about this program today and I was thinking about faith by revelation I was looking at my own life at my times of discouragement where my faith was at that particular moment and I'm persuaded that I wouldn't probably even be here I probably wouldn't be alive to be speaking to you today had it not been for that dimension of faith that's more than just saying I believe but revealed faith faith that comes by the inspiration of the Spirit of God it drops down another notch when I think about the revivalist of the past many great men and women of God used in the great healing revival I think particularly now of of those who had what was called Bulldog faith men like Jack : even before him you precious folk in the United Kingdom would be more familiar with with a Smith Wigglesworth these were men who had faith they didn't just have intellectual faith I believe that's where all faith starts is in the realm of the intellect in the realm of the mind you hear the truth you hear the gospel of Jesus Christ you hear that he has power to save to heal and to deliver and something inside of you says this makes sense you read it in the Bible and something says this is true you don't have the evidence to prove that it's true necessary necessarily it's like the wind we can't see the wind when it's blowing but we know it's blowing by the results so when we look at the results that we have won in our own lives victories that we have won results that we have seen in our own lives it helps us to believe more but in that moment when there's no reason to hope when there's no evidence that would make you believe everything says this is not going to happen and all of a sudden in a moment of Prayer the Spirit of God is quickened on the inside of the inside of who you are and faith drops down kind of like that bulldog faith we're talking about it goes down into another gear like a truck trying to pull itself up the side of a hill on a slippery day on a wintry day and the gear has to shift down into a lower gear to pull a little bit harder that's the kind of faith I'm talking about the Jack Coe kind of faith where at times under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit someone would come with a swelled belly a cancerous tumor growing in their abdomen and by the inspiration of God I'm telling you I don't believe that he punched everybody in the stomach that had an infirmity in the stomach in fact we know that in his ministry he would go service after service without any you know what seems to be almost violent faith a physical demonstration of faith but I believe he was waiting for something and when that moment would come and he knew that he knew that he knew that he knew that God was standing behind him see that was faith by revelation that if I do a certain thing the results are going to be there I don't think that's where we need to start by punching our loved ones in the belly I want you to know that's not in any way what I'm suggesting but what we do need to do is to believe God that our faith will not just be pen and paper faith or I read it on a on a page faith even if the pages in the Bible but the kind of faith that you could say I know that I know that I know that I know it's not I feel it's not I think it's not even I believe it's I know in order to introduce you to faith by revelation my mind immediately goes to a couple of places in scripture and one of those places is Hebrews chapter 11 which is often called the Hall of faith instead of the Hall of Fame because many of God's men are mentioned here and some women who had faith against all odds when all circumstances were against them for instance like Abraham who hoped against hope and Abel and Enoch and Noah and it goes on even Sarah it speaks of of her conception it talks about Isaac and Jacob and Joseph a Moses again is mentioned and Rahab the harlot anyway it's an amazing chapter to read but verse 1 of Hebrews 11 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen if you can see it it doesn't take faith to access it you can just reach out and grab it but if it can't be seen and yet there is a burning hope a burning desire a burning belief that it can be that what hasn't manifested yet can be manifested that what we haven't seen with our eyes yet we can believe until we do see it with our eyes this is how faith operates it doesn't operate by what has already been it operates from that realm of the unseen it is the substance of things hoped for you see there are times in our life when our faith reached out to grab a hold of something and nothing came so what do you do do you you pull your hand in and say just as I thought nothing happened or do you keep your hand out believing until what you believed for is placed in your hand to me that's bulldog faith one of the great generals of God said that the prayer of faith is like a hand that reaches into the heavens and refuses to come back empty-handed I believe when there's no seemingly no reason to keep believing but I'm going to believe anyway and then those there's another verse here that that comes to my mind just a few places down that I I think I would like to look at it's verse 6 actually and it says but without faith it is impossible to please him so faith is not optional because we have to believe first in him and so faith is necessary one of the scriptures that speaks in the Gospels concerning the condition of men's hearts at the time of the end it says nevertheless when Jesus comes when he comes will he find faith in the earth and I'm telling you the answer to that is yes because there's always been a people of faith before Jesus was ever born of a Virgin Mary in Bethlehem there were people of faith the Bible is filled with with the Hebrew people those who believed God by covenant who trusted God who walked with God even when it was very very difficult to do so to the extent that in order to occupy the promise of God the promise that had been made to them they had to physically go in and make it happen so I'm telling you this book this precious Word of God at least the written record of God's Word is a book of faith I think you will find faith from Genesis all the way through to the book of Revelation but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is if you're going to come to God and approach him there has to be a belief even an intellectual faith even something that that you've reasoned in your mind there has to be a divine creator maybe you've looked around and you've seen the world and you've you've you've marveled at the miracle of the human body I've often wondered how anyone could study the miracle of the human body and believe that once upon a time a couple of cells in a mud puddle somewhere divided themselves and out walked a man I could never believe something like that but when I read God's record when I read how faithful God has been through history according to the record that is written in his word it's very easy for me to believe that there is a divine creator that there is a loving God who spoke someone said Oh preacher Shelley don't you believe in the Big Bang Theory of course I said I believe in the Big Bang Theory it's real simple God spoke it and there was a bang and the world the earth appeared by the power of the spoken word the world that we know today was created by that which flowed for from God I tell you that's a powerful truth to begin to get a hold of without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and I like this next part and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him I want to tell you something I believe that God is and I believe that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him why because I read it in the Bible yes that was the beginning of my faith I read it something in me said this is the truth there was a witness in my inner spirit this is the truth but that's not why I believe it today I believe it today because the existence of God has been proven to me in my life the way that he has watched after me and cared for me the way that he has strengthened me and led me to navigate difficult circumstances in my life circumstances where the victory that followed could have never been attributed to the work of a man or to the work of a multitude of men so supernatural that only a supernatural God one who is above all who knows all who loved me only a god like that could have orchestrated the circumstances of my life so I now believe that God is not just because I read it in the word but because it has been proven to me by the Spirit by the reality of my own life and I believe that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him no longer just because I read it in the Bible but because God has proven it to me in my own life God is faithful and he rewards faithfulness I often say it like this everything that happened to me it's not good and I can't say that it's good but I can say what the Bible says it is for my good someone said well if God allowed such a terrible thing to transpire in your life that God must be very very cruel and you know I would almost agree with you if God saw in one dimension like you and I see but because our Creator sees in all dimensions I have to believe that it's not cruelty at all it's God knowing me and seeing my beginning and my end he sees the journey from my beginning to my end and he knows exactly what it will take to bring me into the image that he has called his sons to be in here at the end time and he also knows the outcome when I'm in the middle of a dark trial and it looks hopeless and it looks like I might surely be destroyed God isn't wringing his hands and eternity saying oh I wished I knew how this was going to turn out absolutely not before the trial ever begins before the circumstance ever begins in my life God has already seen the end and he knows he has a mission he has all knowledge and he can see exactly where I will be when it's all over how could a loving God asked Abraham to take his only son Isaac up to Mount Moriah and offer him to God how could God make such a requirement of Abraham well the big question for me is how could Abraham do such a thing how could he be willing to do such a thing I'll tell you why because Abraham had a faith that was not just an intellectual concept I think there's a possibility that there's a God out there he had a relationship with God he could hear the voice of God speaking in his inner being way before he even knew a name for the voice that was speaking to him he had learned to trust that voice and to trust that God is working all things for his good he also had a lot of hope by revelation and he knew that even if indeed he got up on top of that mountain took a dagger a knife and took the life of his son Isaac the New Testament tells us that he believed that that his God had power to raise the dead and so it was easier I didn't say easy I said it was easier for Abraham to hear the voice of God in this manner because he trusted the heart of God for him instead of being angry or bitter or hurt instead of saying what kind of God are you that you had asked for my son you gave him to me he was a promise look what I've been through to get him and now you're gonna take him when God said to Isaac going up that mountain that day God will provide himself a sacrifice that wasn't just religious jargon for Abraham no sir that was real faith faith that started in the intellect it started by hearing an inner voice and he had to make a decision do I believe the voice when God said Abram I'm gonna call you out from your people and send you to a land that you don't know anything about and you know Jewish tradition is that that Abraham's father was an idol maker and so Abram grew up with many false gods in his life who never spoke to him who never performed any miracles for him and yet it was the only faith the only religion the only only culture that he knew anything about and then he hears this voice I'm gonna separate you from your people and send you to a land you're gonna go looking for a city that I am building and he had to make a decision in his intellect in his own mind he had to use his own intelligence to make a conscious choice do I believe this voice am I losing my mind or is this a real God speaking to me I believe it was by revelation it was by the plan of god that abraham believed and recognized it started in the realm of intellectual faith but as he watched God unfolding himself revealing himself along the journey it was no longer just an act of obedience based on a thought or on intellectual faith it became faith by revelation and that's why Abraham was able to do not just taking Isaac but but all of those separations we have ministered in the past on the 7 separations of Abraham it started out by being separated from his family and even his family that went with him is nephew lot he even eventually had to separate from him because of the arguments and disagreements among the herdsmen and so it seems that Abram and later Abraham knew only separations and sacrifice for so long for a big portion of his life's journey then how did he keep doing it again and again and over and over again I don't think it was just because I heard a voice and I believed it was true I think it was much more than that I think God took that intellectual concept of faith and saw the obedience in in Abraham's heart in Abraham's heart and because of that because of that obedience God said I'm gonna I'm gonna begin to reveal by my spirit what faith can really accomplish and so it's a marvelous journey this journey of faith when we were talking to you recently we spoke about the man who brought his his son to Jesus who was very vexed of the enemy in fact the demon spirit that was binding this lad would throw him into the water and throw him into the fire and try to destroy him ofttimes the Bible said and this father in desperation brought his son to the disciples of our Lord and asked them to cast this spirit off of their of his son and they were not able to do anything about it and so he came to Jesus and Jesus said to him if you believe if you can only believe all things are possible the response that Jesus gave was because of the way the father approached him saying I brought my son to your disciples they couldn't do anything about it is there something you can do it was not really the boldest act of faith and yet there was some faith present if for no other reason because of the desperation that was in that man's heart and so jesus said all things are possible only believe to him that believeth all things are possible and I love what the man said he said lord I believe help thou my unbelief we were talking about our in every one of our lives we have experienced that moment that season of unbelief and if it's not dealt with now it doesn't just go away those nagging doubts and that element of unbelief it expands and it grows it actually affects us in the same way that worry and fear would affect us it's like acid in our in our inner being and so it has to be dealt with it has to be confronted and we we don't come in shame and and it is it is perhaps embarrassing maybe you do feel some shame because your faith has wavered and you have struggled with unbelief but I'm encouraging you not to stand before the Lord today covered in shame for that inner struggle that takes place what I'm asking you to do is before your loving father and ask him to take your faith to another level to reveal to you by the spirit from his word and even from your own life how good he is and how it is his desire to bring you closer to him and how that he's going to guide you and protect you and keep you through all the circumstances of your life and everything that happens in your life it's not going to be good and I'm not going to tell you that it is but remember again it's for your good God is working something in your life he is working something in my life that's going to show forth a greater glory a greater reflection of who he is if you think things are troubled now in the earth I'm telling you this is the beginning things are going to wax worse and worse the closer we get to the coming of the Lord we're going to see the world front getting darker and darker we're going to see hatred getting stronger and stronger the Bible tells us that men's hearts will fail people will have heart failure and heart attacks for fear why are you telling us this I thought you were trying to encourage us I am if you and I allow the Spirit of God to reveal faith to us to bring us to another dimension and another level of our faith then when those things begin to happen in the earth around us people who don't have the Lord people who don't have that faith they're gonna need something they're going to need somebody and I'm not sure that you and I would be prepared to help them with just our intellectual faith the kind that begins in Sunday school when we hear that Jesus died on the cross for us and it's easy for us to accept that as little children and so faith begins in that realm in the realm of our mind in the realm of our intellect but something tell me that it's going to take a much deeper faith a much stronger faith in that to be able to provide what's going to be desperately needed perhaps you know some of the things that are going on in our own country tragic shootings and loss of life and there are people who need ministry now it hasn't just affected one little town or one Church or one one congregation or or one family but this is the kind of thing that has ripple effect and it touches a nation and I wouldn't I wouldn't be afraid to say that this tragedy has affected people around the world I want you to know that in that moment there are people right now who need ministry who need love and who need prayers we can't all fly to the place where tragedy takes place but we can go down on our knees and we can pray and we can believe that God will send those who are available and you know it might be you it might be he might send us he might tell us to go out of our comfort zone to minister in that moment we're going to have to go with something more than just a bible school story we're gonna have to go with something that is so supernatural so spirit revealed so powerful that no matter what the enemy says to us or what he does to us on the rest of our journey that we have the grace to bring our unbelief to God lord I believe help thou my unbelief and now I'm gonna keep pressing on in faith and I believe that there are those of us right now who are being positioned to operate in that kind of faith by revelation I was thinking about my friend Peter I say that because I kind of like this character this man called Peter in the Bible I know he had a temper short fuse at times I know he was uneducated I know he was a fisherman but I'm telling you something he opened up his heart for revelation what he lacked in in training you know the kind of knowledge that you learn through school or through education what he lacked in that area I'm telling you he made up for it in that realm of believing he didn't pass every test with flying colors but in the end he came through because he had more than just the intellectual faith he had faith that had come to him by revelation in Matthew chapter 26 verses 30 through 35 it talks to us about Peters betrayal he actually betrayed the Lord he actually said I don't know what you're talking about i-i-i-i I would never I would never deny you know that's what he had told the Lord earlier I will never deny and now it's just a little maid who says you're one of them your speech betrays you and he says I have no idea what you are talking about in Matthew 26 30 through 35 it's it's actually Peter telling the Lord these things I will never do this I will never he said in verse 33 Peter answered and said unto Him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended and that's when Jesus said to him verily I say unto you this night before the crow thou shalt deny me three times and Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all of the disciples Peter wasn't lying Peter had just never been faced with that moment that kind of difficulty had never been a part of who Peter was it had not been a circumstance that he had ever had to deal with before he wasn't lying to the master he believed he believed that the intellectual concept of faith that he had thus far was going to be enough to get him through any tests that came along and he would pass it all with flying colors in Luke chapter 22 verse 31 through 34 this is when Jesus had said to Peter Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for you that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren we believe in the chronology of the scripture that that that this event of course took place before the denial Jesus is saying you're going to be sifted you're going to be tempted but I'm going to pray for you that your faith fail not well when when the rubber got down to the road we say sometimes and when the temptation was actually there it seems that Peter yielded and that he failed the test and yet Jesus prayed that your faith fell not so what are you gonna do with that preacher man I'm gonna tell you the truth Jesus prayed that Peters faith would not fail and it did not the faith that Peter had was not enough to pass this test with flying colors and he denied and he ran away in shame but that same Peter that very same Peter who failed the Lord whose faith was not strong enough in that moment but it wasn't destroyed he didn't allow his mistake his failure to destroy his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ it definitely affected how he felt about himself but it did not affect how he looked at the Lord I think that's very very powerful because in our lives we will fail and it will look like our faith was not enough to sustain us do we fall into bitterness do we give up like so many people do I'm gonna quit the church I'm gonna quit God what's God ever done for me whoa what about all those other times what about his track record in your life we can't forget that can we if we fail today let it be because we miss stepped but don't put that on God don't hang that on him and don't allow the enemy to use your failure to cast doubt on who God is if you will allow the Lord he'll pour some oil on your faith he'll give you deeper revelation and your faith will go to another level and nothing that the enemy would bring into your path would cause you to completely to totally lose faith and give up in Matthew chapter 16 I love this so very much this is when Jesus came to to Caesarea Philippi and his disciples were around him and and I like to visit this place when I'm in Israel it's it's in modern times called Baniyas and you can still see the the remainders the the archaeological discoveries through the years of the ruins of some of these temples because Caesarea Philippi was known to be a place where there were many pagan temples temples dedicated from from anything they were worshipping anything from the Caesar to pan to the goat God a God who was was personified or who was displayed as dancing goats so these were some pretty confused people worshiping in these temples in Caesarea Philippi and Jesus's passing through this area with his disciples and he asked them in the hustle and bustle of all of this idolatry whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and that's in verse 13 and they said some say you're John the Baptist and some say Elias others Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he says to them who do you say that I am and I don't know how long there was a gap you know the scripture doesn't tell us if there was a five-minute pause and no one said anything but the way this is worded it makes me believe that Peter did not hesitate he said thou art listen bleh he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God in Jesus Yeshua answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also under thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it how could Peter make such a statement thou art the Messiah thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God I'm telling you I believe that it was by revelation that Peter was able to identify once and for all who Jesus who Yeshua actually was we find out later that when we're looking at at Peter's life here was the time he denied that he was even identified with the Lord but remember he didn't deny the Lord he was denying his relationship with the Lord I want you to pay some very close attention and put some thought power into this statement he denied I don't know him I'm not one of them I'm not one of his followers these are the kinds of things that these verses translate as but he didn't say to that little woman he's not the Messiah he's not the Son of the Living God he just denied having relationship with him he denied being identified with him he could never deny who he was because it had been revealed to him by the Spirit of the Lord I think it's very interesting because that wasn't all of Peter struggles we read of some other struggles we read of a time when the Lord said get behind me Satan when he was dealing with the spirit that was operating in Peters life he said in Matthew 16 21 through 23 in verse 23 get thee behind me Satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those that be of men so in that moment Peter was not thinking savoring adoring the things of God he was hung up on the common thoughts of men on the world around him on what was going on circumstances of his own life of his own identity and so the Lord rebuked him he didn't destroy him he didn't cast him out of the fold in the same manner that Peter didn't deny who the Lord was he just denied that he had relationship with him it was by revelation that he knew Jesus you are the Messiah the Son of the Living God what I'm trying to say is that each time the Spirit of God reveals truth to us each time that we see it in our own personal life and we know that the Spirit of God is quickening something to us and we know that it was God who did it our faith is strengthened unbelief may still creep up we may still fail we may even deny our relationship with him but once who Jesus is has been revealed to you I don't believe you will ever deny who he is in fact I believe that even if you walk away if you choose not to be in relationship with him I think you may say some things that you regret later but I think there's always something in your heart pulling you back because of the revelation that you received I'm counting on that because I believe there are those who are what we call backslidden those who have fallen away from the Lord those who have let their unbelief get so big in their life until they just gave up on trying to keep a relationship they gave up on that day-to-day walk with Jesus Christ in fact some people have never even been taught or have never even understood that a day-to-day relationship with God is possible and that it wasn't just for Abraham or Noah our Peter it's also available for you in order to have faith we have to believe that God is and we have to believe that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him so let's seek him don't don't remain in your failures don't let your past keep you from moving forward I don't care what you've done it doesn't matter to me what you've done my faith my confidence is in his ability to forgive to deliver and to set free if you once knew the Lord and you've walked away from him now for many many years and you say I've wasted my life well it's true you've wasted time that you could have been using for the glory of God but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer in fact everything that's going on in your life right now is about Redemption He desires to bring every one of us back to the original thoughts that he had about us before the foundation of the world and so if you've wasted time God knows that he knows what you could have been doing and what you should have been doing but he also knows and knew before you knew exactly what you were going to be doing and he has this amazing ability to redeem time he can take those years that are wasted if you're willing to surrender to him if you're willing to confess your unbelief if you're willing to pray ask the Lord to open up a relationship that you've never known with him before take time to read God's Word and take time to let the Spirit of the Lord quicken it and make it alive to you it's one of the reasons why we need preaching God can reveal self to us when we read the word on our own individually that's absolutely the truth but the Bible says that he has chosen the foolishness of preaching and that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and how can we hear the word unless it's preached to us unless it's delivered to us you need fellowship with God's people you need individual time private time with him in reading his word and in worshiping him and praising him for the things that you have watched him do in your life and if you're willing to recommit to him and let him reveal and unfold to you a greater relationship if you're willing to have a greater dependency on him you can't do it by yourself listen I cannot do it by myself that's been proven to me time and time again I know it's true and that's why I can so boldly say you can't do it by yourself but again the good news is you don't have to because the Lord is willing and he's ready and he's reaching out for you perhaps even right now he can take all that wasted time all those moments of of loss what looks like days you could never get back and he can so fill you with a burning passion for his kingdom he can draw you forward in such an accelerated manner that you'd be able to accomplish more in the time that you have left on the planet than you might would have ever been able to do in those years and furthermore were they really wasted years I don't know if all was lost because what I find out about my life is even in those moments when I was really spinning my wheels when I wasn't going anywhere when I wasn't really taking any new territory in there in the realm of the Spirit or growing in the Lord it was still part of the journey it was still part of preparation and if I'm willing to go back and revisit some of those darker moments in my life sometimes there are lessons that I can see now that I couldn't even see then so that's another way that God can redeem the time that you were not serving him with all that you had to offer he just wants your heart it's not your hands it's not your work it's not your labor first and foremost he wants your heart he wants you to surrender everything that you have to him and let him draw from you everything that he's given you already in giftings and in callings I believe that every person listening to me now created of our Father I understand that you were born of a union between your mother and father but I also understand that it was God who placed that spirit who you are you became a living soul because of that spirit that was placed in that little embryo that little baby that was forming in your mother's belly the circumstances of your conception may not have been beautiful and the circumstances of your birth may not have been beautiful and the circumstances of your early life may not have been beautiful but I'm telling you if you'll let Jesus come in and rule and reign in your heart your life can be beautiful now because the beauty of life is not about its circumstances it's about the measure of peace that you can find Jesus Yeshua is SAR Shalom he is the Prince of Peace I'd like to share this with you before we pray there was a great man of God who ministered over a period of time from the late 40s all the way to the middle 60s his name was William Branham and I know that many of you are familiar with this great miracle ministry and although there have been all kinds of things confusing thoughts and criticisms that have surrounded his ministry I've studied his teaching I've studied his life now for for many years over 25 years and in that period of time I've come to learn some really precious things about who Jesus is when when brother branham was in his early days of life he had married he had a son and a baby girl and if you know anything about his life story you'll know that he felt the call he had a commission even from the time he was a child the Lord told him that he was going to to use him and that he should keep himself pure and clean in life etc and he had this experience where he he met these Pentecostal people he had the only only maybe Church upbringing he had no Christian upbringing and the only church that he had been around up until that point was was the denominational Church one that perhaps wasn't teaching the full gospel the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and those things that are related to the Holy Spirit he meets these people coming back from a trip who are you know he saw things he had never seen before and he experienced things that he had never experienced before he had an opportunity to share and the next thing you know they wanted him to come preach all over the country and he went home to tell his wife and what God was doing and his mother-in-law was very very disappointed because she felt like that Pentecostal people were those folks from the wrong side of the tracks and you're not gonna drag my daughter among those people in fact she just called them trash and I don't know if you know anything about the origins of the Pentecostal movement in America but that's how it was looked at so brother Branham made a terrible decision in his life to listen to his wife to his mother-in-law to not go to stay where he was and I'm sure that he could have had a measure of success in that but God was calling him to something higher it was under tragic circumstances that there was a flood in his hometown and tuberculosis was rampant and pneumonia was rampant and he ended up losing his his precious little baby girl Sharon rose and he lost his wife hope and it was devastating to him he tells a story that he was one day standing out by the grave he had a little boy still who needed his mother his wife was gone his little baby girl was gone and he was standing there and and quite a reputable man from the community stopped and saw him standing by the grave and walked over to him and he said called him by his first name he said bill how did you do it how are you making it how are you how are you getting by how did you keep your religion with all that tragedy that you've been through and that's kind of an expression that's used here in the south your religion although it's got to be much more than religion it's got to be a relationship and brother Bentham proved that he had more than religion he had a relationship but he said to this man he said all I I didn't I didn't I didn't keep my religion it kept me what he was talking about was more than what we understand his religion he was talking about faith my faith kept me I couldn't have kept my faith but my faith refused to let go of me this is the kind of faith I'm going to believe God to make real in your life that kind of faith that's revealed by the spirit not based on circumstances no matter what you're going through if you will let God reveal that measure of faith to you you can hold on no matter what's going on Father in the name of Jesus Christ we pray right now for every need I'm asking you Lord to reveal that kind of faith by the Holy Spirit to every needy person watching this program right now I'm going to believe Lord that their faith if they're willing to open up their lives that by the spirit their faith will go to another level and that their faith will hold them no matter what they're facing in life we ask this in the precious name of the lord jesus christ and for his glory well I have to stop I'm not finished but I have to stop I'd like to pray for you if anything that was spoken today ministered to you if you could relate to it I'd be so delighted if you'd phone the ministry if you send an email we would be glad to pray for you we'd be glad to send these scriptures to you if you didn't get to mark them down and you'd like to have them anything that we could do in that way to encourage you that's what we would very much like to do let your intellectual faith move to a higher level by the Spirit of God deal with your unbelief and let your faith hold you anchor you no matter what you're facing it's a real pleasure to be able to speak to you today until we meet again god bless you bye bye for now [Music] you you [Music]
