Description:
God is raising up a people who have no desire to cover up their sin.  They stand at the bottom of the hill of the Lord and worship the One True God as ‘God Sovereign’ with a heart of humility.  These will not allow their failures, inferiorities, anger issues or lack of integrity and unbelief keep them from worshiping Him at the bottom of the hill.  They’ll keep worshiping until God cleanses their hands and purifies their heart.  Those sons and daughters will rise, ready to inherit God’s promises NOW.  That is our “Promised Land.”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're not calling heaven the promised land we're calling inheriting the promises of god now the promised land god is raising up men who have no desire to cover up their sin who have no desire to cover up their shortcoming they just desire to bring all of that into the presence of the lord and see what god will do with it when you come to him bring it all somebody said but the lord said i can't ascend to the heel of the lord you come stand at the bottom of the hill and worship god with everything you have your warts your lack of integrity if you have it your anger issues your inferior autis your insecurities don't you let any of those things keep you from worshiping the lord if you can't worship on the holy hill you worship at the bottom of the holy hill and you say here i am lord with all my failures with all my sin with all my unbelief with all my hang-ups with all my slacknesses but i'm here to worship you and to call you holy and to call you god sovereign god sovereign god supreme the only true living god not three pieces of pie trying to function as one but one god functioning in three divine offices and many more expressions of who he is in the everyday life of the believer he's not looking for subjects he's looking for servants and there is a difference a subject will obey because his very life and substance depends on obeying the edict of the king but a servant a real son who chooses to be a servant he doesn't worship in fear he doesn't approach god afraid he approaches god with boldness knowing that there's a more perfect sacrifice that's crying out on his behalf you stand at the bottom of the hill in worship if that's all you can do until god cleanses your hand and purifies your heart and then you do like the scripture said get up don't stand at the bottom of the hill at cadets barney forever there's a promised land that we're supposed to take right now right here and now we're not calling heaven the promised land we're calling inheriting the promises of god now the promised land
