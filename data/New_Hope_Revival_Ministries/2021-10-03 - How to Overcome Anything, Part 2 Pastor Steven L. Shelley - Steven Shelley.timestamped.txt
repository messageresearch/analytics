[32:46] hallelujah
[32:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[32:55] you may have your seat today
[33:06] i remember
[33:09] hearing brother branham talk
[33:11] about sound waves
[33:14] and he said noah's message is still in
[33:17] the sound waves in the earth and if we
[33:19] could ever tap into it we could hear
[33:21] noah's message
[33:23] he talked about
[33:25] how the television signals go through
[33:27] the atmosphere and
[33:30] talked about if they could find
[33:32] something to tap into it as they did
[33:33] with television that's how you get your
[33:35] television signal and radio signal and
[33:38] so forth
[33:39] and
[33:40] these sounds are in the atmosphere and
[33:42] i'm
[33:44] making an assumption that before the
[33:46] service this song was practiced shout to
[33:48] the lord all the earth i had not been
[33:51] thinking about this song at all i did
[33:53] not hear them practicing the song but as
[33:56] i walked up through here
[33:58] and opened that back door i started
[34:00] singing it so it must have been in the
[34:03] atmosphere it must have been something
[34:05] that pleased the lord
[34:06] that's why i lingered on it
[34:08] because that sound in the atmosphere
[34:11] it's changing things whether we know it
[34:14] or not if our words whether positive or
[34:17] negative are changing things in the
[34:19] atmosphere
[34:21] when we're singing praise to the lord
[34:23] it's shifting things and i believe that
[34:26] there's shift in the atmosphere when we
[34:28] give praise and adoration to the spirit
[34:32] of the living god he is
[34:34] marvelous to us
[34:36] he is marvelous
[34:39] oh hallelujah
[34:41] i'm grateful for his grace in our lives
[34:44] he is
[34:46] he is mighty
[34:48] he is powerful
[34:50] he is working on our behalf
[34:53] even when we don't feel him he's working
[34:57] and i am grateful today
[35:00] that he is working on my behalf he is
[35:02] changing me into his image
[35:05] from glory to glory he's changing me
[35:10] because he wants me to come into his
[35:12] image
[35:13] he
[35:14] it's his desire that's what he desires
[35:17] is for me to come
[35:19] that's why we're still on the earth
[35:22] because he has a bride that is going to
[35:25] come into his image
[35:28] oh my
[35:32] let me get there quickly lord
[35:35] i don't want to be delaying this thing
[35:38] i don't want to be delaying it i want to

[39:37] we've had a week where we did not gather
[39:39] together
[39:40] we had a marvelous time in the camp
[39:42] meeting
[39:43] brother brooks
[39:46] just given it everything he had to
[39:48] minister in song and in the word and how
[39:51] the lord met us here and
[39:54] the uh the song that the choir sang on
[39:57] sunday and how blessed we were by that
[40:00] and
[40:00] just letting it reverberate in our minds
[40:04] through the week that we are overcomers
[40:06] not we're gonna be
[40:08] we are
[40:11] you see friends we're a part of i am
[40:18] not i was
[40:19] and i'm going to be
[40:21] but we're a part of i am
[40:23] he's a part of us
[40:25] he's living in us
[40:28] and so that doesn't mean we're gonna be
[40:30] overcomers it means present tense we are
[40:34] overcomers
[40:36] well i didn't look like much of an
[40:37] overcomer this week
[40:39] [Music]
[40:41] it's irrelevant
[40:43] because he is i am
[40:46] and i am lives in me
[40:48] i am an overcomer
[40:51] and all of these trials that are put in
[40:54] my life
[40:55] to bring me forth as pure gold they're
[40:57] put there for a reason
[40:59] and god allows them to come whether they
[41:02] be big or whether they belittle because
[41:04] he is training us
[41:07] he is
[41:08] shaving off all of those things that
[41:11] don't need to be there and through it
[41:13] all i'm still an overcomer
[41:16] well i didn't overcome the trial that he
[41:18] put me through that's all right it'll
[41:19] come back around in a while he'll let
[41:21] you go through it again
[41:23] because
[41:24] you're going to overcome it
[41:26] you are
[41:28] you're going to see the present tense
[41:30] reality of overcoming something that in
[41:33] a pastime you may not have
[41:36] because it's a part of i am
[41:38] that is who he is in you
[41:41] and as we allow him to become more i am
[41:44] in our lives
[41:47] oh my friends
[41:49] it is becoming more of a reality every
[41:52] day
[41:54] that i was put on this earth
[41:57] not just to represent jesus
[42:00] christ but to be a living reality of
[42:04] jesus christ because he dwells in me
[42:09] hallelujah
[42:12] oh blessed be the name of the
[42:14] lord i am
[42:17] i am
[42:19] that's who he is
[42:21] and that's who i am
[42:23] because he dwells
[42:25] inside of me

[48:50] and i'm so glad that you're here today
[48:53] i feel the presence of the lord
[48:55] i sure appreciated and enjoyed what
[48:58] brother greeley was sharing with him it
[49:00] seemed like everything he shared was
[49:02] just so good
[49:03] i chewed on it
[49:05] i appreciate the lord
[49:08] i appreciate him for giving us those
[49:10] nuggets
[49:11] and they may come back to you sometime
[49:13] this week when you need them he's good
[49:15] like that isn't he
[49:17] and we've had lots to chew on this week
[49:20] and uh it was a wonderful thing to hear
[49:22] some of the young people say last sunday
[49:24] night they said my i can't believe we're
[49:26] going to go a whole week without being
[49:28] in church it's one thing when the
[49:30] seniors say that because the
[49:33] they they have come through that way
[49:35] faithful and they're going to be here
[49:37] and we know that and we count on them
[49:39] but it's especially encouraging when
[49:41] young people uh say i i don't know about
[49:44] being out of service for a whole week
[49:46] but um i don't know about you but i
[49:49] needed this time and i'm here today
[49:51] feeling strong because of the goodness
[49:54] of the lord and because of some rest and
[49:58] we have had testimonies come in this
[50:00] week of what god has done for us during
[50:03] camp meeting and some who have already
[50:06] gone home have sent their testimonies
[50:09] back
[50:10] and we won't take time to share all of
[50:12] those this morning but
[50:14] they were significant and god met people
[50:17] here
[50:18] and he carried the saints home a lot of
[50:21] you were here when uh
[50:23] all of our friends from indiana
[50:26] left and drove home and they got in
[50:29] about little after four o'clock monday
[50:32] morning and they had to start shores at
[50:35] five
[50:37] and then worked that day
[50:39] but you know i heard from some of them
[50:40] uh monday evening and the strength of
[50:43] the lord was just carrying them
[50:45] they milked the cows with a lot of
[50:47] anointing on them at five o'clock monday
[50:50] morning and
[50:52] the strength of the lord was upon all of
[50:54] us i believe that i really do and god
[50:56] met needs there were some who said they
[50:58] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:01] and that's why we gather
[51:03] is so that people can have a personal
[51:05] experience with the lord
[51:07] i'm so happy about that
[51:13] stacy and i and benjamin and mariah took
[51:16] brother brooks and sister ruby to the
[51:19] airport on monday around lunchtime just
[51:21] before lunchtime
[51:23] and they were so encouraged and so
[51:26] blessed
[51:27] and to see them high after a
[51:30] hard-working week brother
[51:32] brooks gave a lot
[51:34] and
[51:35] they are in their 60s for those of you
[51:37] who have asked they are in their 60s and
[51:42] getting very close to 70
[51:44] and uh pastoring two churches
[51:47] and sister ruby does most of the driving
[51:50] she's the chauffeur
[51:51] and gets him back and forth but uh they
[51:55] are hoping that they can do something to
[51:57] sort of minimalize those miles between
[51:59] the two places you can just imagine what
[52:02] a toll that takes and you're giving i
[52:05] want you to know that your giving
[52:08] made a tremendous difference in what we
[52:11] were able to give to brother brooks this
[52:13] year
[52:14] and i don't mind to tell you i think you
[52:16] might be interested to know of course we
[52:18] didn't have to split the honorarium just
[52:21] having one speaker here but i want you
[52:23] to know we were able to give him an
[52:25] extra thousand dollars that he has never
[52:27] received before and you did it that was
[52:30] your giving and uh
[52:32] [Music]
[52:34] every penny that you designated for
[52:37] special speaker every penny of it went
[52:40] to him
[52:41] and he was so grateful i know you think
[52:44] about a pastor having two churches and
[52:46] you think my he must really be making it
[52:50] but i wish that we were not streaming
[52:52] right now because i would be able to
[52:54] really tell you just how how hard it is
[52:58] but god is helping them
[53:00] and they're getting by but your giving
[53:02] has made a difference does it make you
[53:04] feel good to know that you sowed into
[53:07] such a life like that in the ministry
[53:09] like that and that it was needed and it
[53:12] was appreciated never taken for granted
[53:15] so thank you all all of the expenses of
[53:17] camp meeting were met because of your
[53:19] giving there was nothing left over there
[53:22] was no no uh extra expense that we had
[53:26] to figure out how we were going to pay
[53:27] out of our regular weekly finances so
[53:30] again to god be the glory one of the
[53:32] most successful
[53:34] times that we have had together
[53:37] financially and you say that doesn't
[53:39] matter well it matters to those of us
[53:41] who have to make it work
[53:44] day after day after day after day after
[53:46] day and it could not have happened
[53:48] without you

[1:00:53] few scriptures and a few quotes that i
[1:00:56] highlighted and i said added so if you
[1:00:59] can find a way to get those
[1:01:01] thrown in there uh
[1:01:04] while you're sh i don't even know if you
[1:01:05] can do it at the same time or not that's
[1:01:07] on me and i'm sorry that i forgot to
[1:01:09] mention to you i highlighted it in
[1:01:11] yellow and and put uh added with today's
[1:01:14] date on there and if something happens
[1:01:16] that we can't get it again that's on me
[1:01:19] and not on you all
[1:01:20] isaiah chapter 10
[1:01:22] and verse 27 and it shall come to pass
[1:01:27] in that day
[1:01:29] that his burden shall be taken away
[1:01:33] from off thy shoulder
[1:01:36] and his yoke
[1:01:37] from off thy neck
[1:01:40] and the yoke
[1:01:41] shall be destroyed
[1:01:43] because
[1:01:45] of the anointing
[1:01:47] i want to read it again and it shall
[1:01:49] come to pass in that day that his burden
[1:01:53] shall be taken away from off thy
[1:01:55] shoulder
[1:01:56] and his yoke from off thy neck
[1:01:59] and the yoke shall be destroyed
[1:02:03] because
[1:02:04] of the anointing
[1:02:06] let's look at that in the amplified
[1:02:08] before we pray
[1:02:11] in the amplified it reads a little
[1:02:13] differently
[1:02:14] and it shall be in that day that the
[1:02:16] burden of the assyrian
[1:02:19] now when you are reading about the
[1:02:22] assyrian
[1:02:23] in in the in the prophetic scriptures
[1:02:27] you will find that it is also a type of
[1:02:30] the antichrist or the antichrist spirit
[1:02:34] so when we're looking at this in the
[1:02:36] amplified we know specifically whose
[1:02:40] burden it is who is it that is
[1:02:43] uh
[1:02:44] putting this burden on the
[1:02:47] on the neck
[1:02:48] of god's people and it is the assyrian
[1:02:52] but it is a reference to antichrist it
[1:02:56] shall be in that day that the burden of
[1:02:59] the assyrian shall depart from your
[1:03:02] shoulders
[1:03:03] and his yoke from your neck
[1:03:06] the yoke shall be destroyed because of
[1:03:10] fatness
[1:03:11] now that word fatness is the original
[1:03:14] word for anointing
[1:03:16] which prevents it from going around your
[1:03:21] neck
[1:03:22] god is saying that he is going to so
[1:03:25] increase
[1:03:26] the anointing on his children
[1:03:29] in that day
[1:03:31] that their necks are going to swell with
[1:03:33] prosperity
[1:03:36] that fatness is oil
[1:03:38] it's not just talking about blubber
[1:03:41] it's talking about oil and his oil is
[1:03:44] going to be so mightily increased
[1:03:47] on their lives
[1:03:49] that their necks will be enlarged
[1:03:52] and there will the yoke that has bound
[1:03:55] them in the past will not be able to
[1:03:57] contain
[1:03:59] the oil of god on their neck
[1:04:02] which speaks of shoulders and government
[1:04:05] and authority in his people it's a
[1:04:07] pretty powerful promise isn't it
[1:04:10] lord jesus we come to you today
[1:04:14] knowing that you have not left us here
[1:04:19] for such a time as this without a
[1:04:22] strategy to overcome
[1:04:25] you have anointed us
[1:04:28] with oil fresh oil green oil
[1:04:31] that comes from the squeezing of the
[1:04:34] olive
[1:04:35] the freshest and the purest of the oil
[1:04:40] you saved the best for last
[1:04:43] you have strengthened us
[1:04:45] for standing
[1:04:47] for running for climbing for pressing in
[1:04:51] to the kingdom of god
[1:04:53] you have not left us starving
[1:04:56] you have not left us destitute
[1:04:58] you have not left us dry and dead and
[1:05:02] without spirit life but you have
[1:05:04] provided hallelujah you have provided
[1:05:08] everything we need to be anointed
[1:05:12] for such an hour for such a time
[1:05:16] for such a difficult season as the one
[1:05:19] we're walking in in the earth right now
[1:05:22] but we are well prepared
[1:05:24] because as our brother told us today the
[1:05:27] i am is in us
[1:05:30] we are a part of the i am
[1:05:33] and so all that he is all of that
[1:05:37] anointing and all of that fatness of the
[1:05:41] messiah the anointed one every bit of
[1:05:44] that has been poured out upon our heads
[1:05:47] and if we will depend on what you've
[1:05:50] gifted us
[1:05:51] if we will depend on what you have
[1:05:53] provided for us there is not one thing
[1:05:57] that we cannot overcome in this hour
[1:05:59] so today lord let your word talk to us
[1:06:03] as we study together for a few moments
[1:06:05] let it talk to us
[1:06:07] let it inspire us and instruct us
[1:06:11] let us be prepared to face whatever we
[1:06:14] have yet to face
[1:06:16] we know there's nothing new under the
[1:06:18] sun
[1:06:19] but we know that evil has increased
[1:06:22] and we know that freedom is diminishing
[1:06:25] and so we must look to you lord in this
[1:06:28] hour
[1:06:29] in ways that we have never looked to you
[1:06:31] before
[1:06:32] knowing that your grace is always
[1:06:36] sufficient for every trial that we face
[1:06:40] give us grace today to study your word
[1:06:43] and we will give you the glory and the
[1:06:46] honor and the praise for it's in the
[1:06:48] lovely name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:06:51] pray amen
[1:06:53] and the church said again
[1:06:55] amen you may be seated
[1:06:57] would you turn in your bible if you have
[1:07:00] it there
[1:07:01] because this is a portion of scripture
[1:07:05] that specifically describes the hour and
[1:07:09] the season and the church age that we
[1:07:13] are living in and though we're going to
[1:07:15] put it up here on the screen it wouldn't
[1:07:17] be a bad idea for you to be able to find
[1:07:20] it in your own printed bible and so if
[1:07:24] you have it i invite you to go to
[1:07:26] revelation chapter 3. we're going to
[1:07:29] look together for a few moments
[1:07:32] at the characteristics of the last
[1:07:34] church age
[1:07:36] and we are finishing up by the grace of
[1:07:39] god today or tuesday night one of the
[1:07:42] two
[1:07:42] on the anointing to overcome
[1:07:46] anything
[1:07:47] and i was
[1:07:49] blessed of the lord to be able to start
[1:07:51] the meeting off and then to sit back
[1:07:54] and watch god unfold himself to brother
[1:07:57] brooks
[1:07:58] i i was so blessed
[1:08:00] he had just a title just the title the
[1:08:03] theme of the camp meeting but i loved
[1:08:06] how every message that he brought laid
[1:08:09] on the on the one he just brought it
[1:08:11] just was lying upon line upon line upon
[1:08:15] line and i'm thankful for the blessing
[1:08:17] of being able to go back and hear some
[1:08:19] of it already this week i'm not quite
[1:08:22] finished but i intend
[1:08:24] to go back and hear every one of those
[1:08:26] messages again i assure you they're
[1:08:29] nothing but the truth if you believe
[1:08:31] that you can squeeze out an amen here
[1:08:34] revelation 3 verse 14 and unto the angel
[1:08:38] of the church of the laodicean's right
[1:08:41] these things saith thee amen
[1:08:45] the faithful and true witness
[1:08:47] the beginning of the creation of god how
[1:08:51] many of you know that's the lord jesus
[1:08:52] christ the beginning of the creation of
[1:08:56] god he said i know thy works
[1:09:00] that thou art neither cold or hot
[1:09:03] i would
[1:09:04] thou art cold
[1:09:06] or hot put your finger there just a
[1:09:08] minute
[1:09:09] now if there should be anyone listening
[1:09:11] to this this morning or in the future
[1:09:14] that doesn't understand where we are on
[1:09:17] those seven churches of asia minor let
[1:09:21] me just remind you that there are
[1:09:24] several different applications
[1:09:26] of those words of instruction that are
[1:09:30] given to those churches
[1:09:32] first and foremost those seven churches
[1:09:35] of asia minor were
[1:09:38] literal contemporary
[1:09:40] churches of their day
[1:09:42] they existed in building and in
[1:09:45] congregation they existed with
[1:09:47] individual government but under the
[1:09:50] leadership of anointed pastors
[1:09:53] and apostles
[1:09:55] who would visit those churches and pour
[1:09:59] ministry and life into them in what was
[1:10:03] a very difficult time can you say amen
[1:10:06] i mean this was an hour where the church
[1:10:09] was being tried
[1:10:10] and men and women of god were being
[1:10:13] singled out for great persecution and so
[1:10:16] they needed an anointing in that hour to
[1:10:20] overcome the spirit of their age which
[1:10:22] was of course a part of the ephesian
[1:10:25] church age now every one of those
[1:10:27] churches has a name
[1:10:29] and to every one of those churches there
[1:10:31] was a sign an angel
[1:10:34] and every one of those angel messengers
[1:10:37] we can look at that with a literal
[1:10:38] application and we can say that god was
[1:10:41] speaking through the pastor to those
[1:10:44] churches no doubt at all
[1:10:46] and we see that there was great great
[1:10:49] difficulty in that time but we also know
[1:10:53] by revelation
[1:10:55] that those seven churches beginning with
[1:10:58] ephesus and ending with laodicea are not
[1:11:02] just
[1:11:02] instructions or descriptions of seven
[1:11:06] literal churches that existed all at the
[1:11:09] same time in the second temple period
[1:11:13] but they are also descriptive of church
[1:11:17] ages of history so literal church
[1:11:21] and also church ages periods of history
[1:11:26] where those particular descriptions of
[1:11:29] what was in the church
[1:11:32] literally in that hour also become
[1:11:36] descriptions of ages of history where
[1:11:40] all of the hindrances that those literal
[1:11:43] churches were going through in the same
[1:11:45] day
[1:11:46] as those ages would unfold we saw that
[1:11:51] that same prevalent spirit predominant
[1:11:54] spirit became the spirit of the age for
[1:11:58] instance if it was lukewarmness
[1:12:01] in the literal church then as that age
[1:12:04] unfolded in history the spirit of
[1:12:07] lukewarmness became predominant in that
[1:12:11] entire age now we we have we have some
[1:12:16] interpretations and understandings of
[1:12:19] how long these church ages lasted but we
[1:12:22] also know that they lapped over one
[1:12:25] another
[1:12:26] and so we may not be able we can give
[1:12:28] you what we have but we may not be able
[1:12:31] to pin it down to a definitive moment
[1:12:34] where one church age came to an end and
[1:12:38] another church age began
[1:12:40] now this is more more important than
[1:12:44] what a lot of people realize
[1:12:46] because in order to overcome in your age
[1:12:52] you've got to know what you're dealing
[1:12:53] with
[1:12:54] somebody said well lord knows i sure do
[1:12:57] know what i'm dealing with if anybody
[1:12:59] knows what they're dealing with i guess
[1:13:01] i do but you also have to see
[1:13:04] what has been given as the remedy to
[1:13:06] overcome
[1:13:08] it was given to those seven literal
[1:13:10] churches of asia minor in their day and
[1:13:13] it has been a sign to every one of those
[1:13:16] church ages now when we get to laodicea
[1:13:20] the seventh of those ages we see a
[1:13:23] culmination of all of the evil
[1:13:27] all of the darkness all of the
[1:13:29] wickedness that each of those church
[1:13:32] ages suffered now are dealt with now it
[1:13:36] has culminated or consummated into the
[1:13:39] last of the seven church ages and it has
[1:13:42] become the most wicked it has become the
[1:13:45] darkest
[1:13:46] it has become the most evil the
[1:13:48] description of that last day church age
[1:13:52] is very very sad that's what we're
[1:13:54] reading right now but it was in that
[1:13:57] last church age
[1:13:59] somewhere from pentecost all the way up
[1:14:03] to the rapture
[1:14:05] not sure uh every little specific date
[1:14:08] or
[1:14:09] moment or or just where laodicea ends
[1:14:13] and a bright age begin not knowing all
[1:14:16] of those details definitively we are
[1:14:19] able to recognize that with every evil
[1:14:23] that has culminated into the last church
[1:14:25] age god has also provided a way to
[1:14:30] escape
[1:14:31] a way to overcome the spirit of the age
[1:14:35] and those who overcome the spirit of the
[1:14:39] age of laodicea are in fact overcoming
[1:14:42] the spirit of all the other six church
[1:14:45] ages as well
[1:14:47] so if you can survive and then overcome
[1:14:51] in laodicea you've not just overcome the
[1:14:54] enemy and the predominant spirit in
[1:14:57] laodicea but you've gone all the way
[1:15:00] back to the beginning because all of
[1:15:03] them have marched against the church in
[1:15:06] this last church age but look what god
[1:15:09] did he said in that last church age i am
[1:15:13] going to provide the most light
[1:15:16] when it's the darkest it has ever been
[1:15:19] out there i'm going to make it shine
[1:15:22] brighter in my people than it has ever
[1:15:26] shown before are you with me
[1:15:29] now listen it's not always about yelling
[1:15:32] it's not always about shouting it's not
[1:15:35] always about spitting and sputtering
[1:15:37] sometimes it's about teaching just a
[1:15:39] moment making sure we understand what
[1:15:43] we're facing in this hour
[1:15:45] so if you read what the church of
[1:15:47] ephesus was dealing with and you go all
[1:15:50] the way through the list to laodicea you
[1:15:52] will understand that that spirit just
[1:15:55] gets darker darker darker darker as it
[1:15:59] comes up to the age that we're living in
[1:16:01] but oh
[1:16:02] listen church god did not leave us here
[1:16:06] groping in the darkness of the church
[1:16:08] ages
[1:16:09] no sir he provided a light
[1:16:13] he provided a word of deliverance and an
[1:16:18] overcoming anointing for his bride in
[1:16:21] this church h2
[1:16:23] not just the first few but in all of
[1:16:26] them he has made a way
[1:16:28] to escape if you believe that i want you
[1:16:31] to say amen
[1:16:32] i know thy works
[1:16:34] that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:16:37] i would
[1:16:38] thou wort cold
[1:16:41] or hot
[1:16:42] i want you to be one or the other
[1:16:45] all right let's go on
[1:16:49] so then because thou art
[1:16:52] look
[1:16:53] warm
[1:16:55] now what does that mean
[1:16:57] it's not cold
[1:16:59] it's not
[1:17:00] hot it's kind of
[1:17:03] tipid or tepid
[1:17:05] it's
[1:17:06] room temperature
[1:17:09] i want you to know that there are people
[1:17:11] who can't drink cold water
[1:17:13] i like it cold
[1:17:15] i don't like it room temperature i can
[1:17:17] drink it but i can drink a whole lot
[1:17:19] more water if it's cold i know they say
[1:17:22] it's not good for me and you shouldn't
[1:17:23] do that and all that but i've i've just
[1:17:25] i've just experienced that if i've got
[1:17:27] to drink a lot if i've got to get a lot
[1:17:29] down i need a little coolness to it
[1:17:32] i can stand there and drink it a whole
[1:17:34] lot more when it's not lukewarm i
[1:17:37] immediately remember working in the in
[1:17:40] the fields digging sweet potatoes or
[1:17:43] whatever we were digging at the time
[1:17:45] with my grandparents
[1:17:47] we didn't have yetis
[1:17:51] didn't know what yetis were
[1:17:53] we didn't have those coolers that they
[1:17:55] have now that you can put a bag of ice
[1:17:58] in and have it for three days
[1:18:00] nothing like that we just had mason jars
[1:18:04] and uh big ones we had some big ones big
[1:18:07] old gallon jars
[1:18:09] and they would put water in it in the
[1:18:11] morning
[1:18:12] we didn't have ice maker either
[1:18:15] but they would use up their plastic
[1:18:18] butter tubs and containers like that and
[1:18:21] they would make ice
[1:18:22] and they would take an ice pick
[1:18:26] because you didn't you you know you
[1:18:27] didn't they didn't my grandparents
[1:18:29] didn't have ice trays
[1:18:31] that you could just flip out those
[1:18:33] beautiful little
[1:18:34] uh you know even little ice cubes no no
[1:18:37] no you just turned it out of a butter
[1:18:39] tub and then you went to work with it
[1:18:42] with an ice pick
[1:18:44] you know that is messy
[1:18:46] you have ice everywhere you got water
[1:18:48] everywhere you've got a genuine mess
[1:18:51] every jug was filled almost to the top
[1:18:54] and then some of those big old pieces of
[1:18:57] ice out of the butter tub
[1:18:59] were were put in
[1:19:01] in it and
[1:19:02] uh the lid was secured and a big old
[1:19:06] towel some big old fluffy towel was used
[1:19:10] to wrap around those jugs and off to the
[1:19:14] field we were sent
[1:19:16] for us it was fun
[1:19:18] we didn't quite realize that there was
[1:19:20] so much work involved it felt almost
[1:19:23] like a camping trip and here we go with
[1:19:26] our jugs of water and our towels and
[1:19:29] whatever else we had and you get out
[1:19:31] there and first break
[1:19:33] was always the best
[1:19:36] because you were sent out with leftover
[1:19:39] biscuit
[1:19:40] from breakfast
[1:19:42] they were still just a nice temperature
[1:19:45] you stopped you got a you got a bite or
[1:19:48] two of a biscuit
[1:19:50] and you drank cold
[1:19:53] water
[1:19:54] now the ice had melted some the the
[1:19:57] towel was now good and wet how many of
[1:20:00] you know what that come in handy for
[1:20:02] you lay that towel on the back of your
[1:20:04] neck and it starts cooling you down
[1:20:07] because by 11 o'clock in south alabama
[1:20:10] it was already very very hot
[1:20:14] even in early fall digging sweet potato
[1:20:16] time it was already very very hot and
[1:20:20] you needed the moisture of that jug
[1:20:23] sweating to lay that on the back of your
[1:20:25] neck then you have lunch
[1:20:28] at whatever time one o'clock or
[1:20:30] something like that you have lunch and
[1:20:32] if it was packed then you ate right out
[1:20:35] in the field if it wasn't you went back
[1:20:37] to the house
[1:20:38] but about three o'clock in the afternoon
[1:20:41] you'd have another water break and
[1:20:43] another bite of your biscuit if you if
[1:20:45] you kept any of that in a a rag or
[1:20:48] napkin or something you'd have another
[1:20:49] body of that and uh that water
[1:20:53] i don't care how many towels it was
[1:20:55] wrapped in ice is gone
[1:20:58] most of the sweating of the jug is gone
[1:21:02] and that water is hardly fit to drink
[1:21:06] but you're thirsty
[1:21:08] and you take a big old sip of it
[1:21:11] and it is lukewarm
[1:21:14] it it it's really getting toward warm
[1:21:18] no real coolness to it at all and if
[1:21:21] you're hot and you're sweaty and you
[1:21:23] work pretty hard you pour that down and
[1:21:26] you can't my i can hear my granddaddy
[1:21:28] now don't drink too much
[1:21:31] just enough to wet your whistle
[1:21:33] don't drink too much you know why
[1:21:36] because we would just guzzle it
[1:21:38] and as soon as that warm water would go
[1:21:41] down into our stomach as hot as we were
[1:21:44] our temperature so hot our skin so hot
[1:21:48] it would go down if we drank too much
[1:21:50] and hit that stomach and i want you to
[1:21:52] know within just a few seconds you could
[1:21:55] really feel sick
[1:21:58] what did it that luke warm water
[1:22:02] hitting your your belly
[1:22:04] with all that uh
[1:22:06] overheatedness you know that you're
[1:22:08] going through all around you you put
[1:22:10] that warm water on your belly and the
[1:22:12] next thing you know you're back to work
[1:22:15] and i this only happened to me a few
[1:22:17] times but it started churning
[1:22:19] just like you'd eaten something that you
[1:22:21] shouldn't eat so i have no problem
[1:22:24] understanding that the word that is used
[1:22:27] here is only used one time in greek only
[1:22:30] used one time in the old testament in
[1:22:32] the new testament and it doesn't mean i
[1:22:36] will politely
[1:22:38] turn my head
[1:22:40] and let this water dribble out of my
[1:22:42] mouth
[1:22:43] it doesn't mean that i will like a man
[1:22:46] would spit in a spittoon i will just
[1:22:49] just spit that water up the word is
[1:22:52] translated vomit
[1:22:55] and it means to expel
[1:22:58] what you have taken into your stomach
[1:23:01] with violent force
[1:23:04] so anybody that's a parent here you have
[1:23:07] experienced projectile vomiting
[1:23:11] everybody's hungry now
[1:23:15] you jesus is saying
[1:23:17] i can stand it if you're hot
[1:23:21] i can stand if you're cold
[1:23:24] but the problem with this church age is
[1:23:26] she's neither hot
[1:23:29] nor is she cold
[1:23:31] and when i take that in it so disturbs
[1:23:35] my system that all i want to do is vomit
[1:23:38] that out of my mouth
[1:23:41] and so jesus is saying to first the
[1:23:44] literal church in laodicea
[1:23:46] and more importantly for us to the
[1:23:49] entire church age that we are living in
[1:23:52] right now because you're not hot because
[1:23:56] you're not cold but because you exist in
[1:23:59] a lukewarm condition i will vomit you
[1:24:03] i will expel you
[1:24:05] from my mouth and i don't know about you
[1:24:08] but that doesn't sound like something i
[1:24:09] want jesus to do concerning my life
[1:24:13] he's saying i will push you out
[1:24:16] and i don't know
[1:24:17] exactly if you get it or not but we want
[1:24:20] to be as close to him in this last
[1:24:23] church age as we can possibly get
[1:24:25] and we want him drawing us but in this
[1:24:28] case he's not saying i'm going to draw
[1:24:30] you in your lukewarm condition in fact
[1:24:32] he's saying i'm going to push you away
[1:24:34] i'm going to vomit you out of my mouth
[1:24:37] are you with me now let's read on and
[1:24:39] catch the next verse
[1:24:41] so
[1:24:42] because thou sayest i am rich
[1:24:45] this is the first church age in history
[1:24:49] to say i am rich
[1:24:53] i am increased with goods
[1:24:57] i have need of nothing
[1:25:00] and you know not
[1:25:02] that you are wretched
[1:25:04] you are miserable
[1:25:07] you are poor
[1:25:09] you are blind
[1:25:11] you are naked
[1:25:12] i want you to know that's an indictment
[1:25:14] against the church of laodicea and
[1:25:17] against those who experience the
[1:25:18] laodicean church age
[1:25:20] their testimony is we are more
[1:25:23] prosperous than we have ever been stay
[1:25:26] with me church
[1:25:27] our buildings are larger
[1:25:30] our programs are more successful
[1:25:33] we even have coffee shops
[1:25:37] we have all the things that any other
[1:25:40] social club would have
[1:25:44] we have need of nothing we have more
[1:25:47] money for missions and we have more
[1:25:49] money for this and we are increased with
[1:25:52] goods we have everything that we've ever
[1:25:54] needed and jesus is saying you don't
[1:25:57] even know
[1:25:59] you testify i'm rich you don't even know
[1:26:02] you're poor
[1:26:04] you testify that you are increased with
[1:26:07] goods but you're wretched
[1:26:10] and you're miserable and you don't even
[1:26:12] know it this is not an indictment
[1:26:14] against the world or the secular life
[1:26:18] this isn't an indictment against the
[1:26:20] last day church
[1:26:22] the church of the last day the
[1:26:24] denominational system that prevails in
[1:26:28] the last hour
[1:26:30] now you may not know it but we are
[1:26:32] living in the last of the last days
[1:26:35] and this is the condition of the modern
[1:26:38] church
[1:26:40] just a moment i'll help myself amen
[1:26:42] brother
[1:26:43] this is the description of the modern
[1:26:46] church
[1:26:47] we have to have three services a day
[1:26:50] three services a sunday
[1:26:53] and we don't we even have to tell people
[1:26:55] hold back on your giving sometime
[1:26:57] i don't know if they do that or not
[1:26:59] because we are so rich
[1:27:01] and we have everything we need of this
[1:27:03] is jesus talking and he said you don't
[1:27:06] even know that you're wretched you are
[1:27:08] miserable you are poor you are blind you
[1:27:12] are naked i don't know about you but
[1:27:14] that doesn't sound like a commendation
[1:27:16] that doesn't sound like a trophy that's
[1:27:18] about to be handed out it sounds like an
[1:27:20] awful indictment against a religious
[1:27:21] bunch of people if you're with me say
[1:27:23] amen i sure wished you were if you're
[1:27:26] not i hope you'll get there in a moment
[1:27:28] and jesus said i counsel thee to buy of
[1:27:33] me
[1:27:35] gold
[1:27:36] tried in the fire
[1:27:38] if you want to be rich
[1:27:39] let me talk to you about your riches
[1:27:42] your riches needs to be gold that you've
[1:27:44] gotten from me gold that has been tried
[1:27:47] in the fire not filthy lucr
[1:27:50] come on now
[1:27:52] not not not turning the church into a
[1:27:54] business
[1:27:56] but if you want to have some riches here
[1:27:58] it needs to be gold that has been tried
[1:28:01] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:28:03] white raiment
[1:28:05] that you may be clothed and that the
[1:28:08] shame of thy nakedness i i want you to
[1:28:11] see how apropos it is
[1:28:14] that the last day church is the only
[1:28:17] church and the only church age that is
[1:28:19] rebuked
[1:28:21] for for being
[1:28:23] immodest
[1:28:26] and not only immodest naked
[1:28:29] you're just naked and i want you to know
[1:28:31] you may not agree but we're not just
[1:28:33] talking spiritually here we're talking
[1:28:36] to a church that has so lost its vision
[1:28:38] and so cast off restraint
[1:28:43] that they fill up their social media
[1:28:45] with bikinis
[1:28:50] my social media is filled up right now
[1:28:53] with precious young men that we watch
[1:28:56] grow up and and their date for the
[1:28:59] for the prom looking like hoochie
[1:29:04] i'm thinking to myself what kind of mom
[1:29:06] and daddy
[1:29:08] is going to send a warm-blooded young
[1:29:10] man
[1:29:12] off to a prom
[1:29:14] with a with a uh uh a young lady
[1:29:20] who looks like that
[1:29:22] she looks like she's just wallowed in
[1:29:24] out of the bedroom
[1:29:25] you can say amen or oh me there's
[1:29:28] nothing left to the imagination and this
[1:29:31] is the condition of the modern church
[1:29:33] she's not only spiritually naked and has
[1:29:36] not covered up her unrighteousness with
[1:29:39] his his righteousness
[1:29:41] but she has cast off restraint
[1:29:44] and there is such an out there such a a
[1:29:47] a spirit of immodesty
[1:29:50] that is prevailing in the last day
[1:29:52] church so much so that anybody who
[1:29:55] opposes that's made fun of are you with
[1:29:57] me
[1:29:58] anybody that stands to cover up their
[1:30:00] bodies in this hour is referred to as
[1:30:03] being legalistic
[1:30:05] but surely there's got to be something
[1:30:07] in between naked
[1:30:09] and a nun
[1:30:12] surely there can be a balance
[1:30:15] for godly people to have a godly
[1:30:18] testimony in the wicked hour that we're
[1:30:20] living in he said i've got some clothing
[1:30:23] to give you
[1:30:24] and we know what that clothing is the
[1:30:26] robe of his righteousness and i want to
[1:30:28] cover up your spiritual nakedness i'd
[1:30:31] like to help you with some of your
[1:30:32] natural nakedness too i believe he's
[1:30:34] saying and anoint your eyes with i save
[1:30:38] that thou mayest see
[1:30:40] did you know here's the problem they're
[1:30:42] all of these things and they can't see
[1:30:44] it
[1:30:45] they can't recognize it they don't even
[1:30:48] know it and jesus is saying i can give
[1:30:50] you some ointment for your eyes but when
[1:30:53] i do your eyes are going to pop open and
[1:30:55] you're going to see
[1:30:57] that instead of rich you're poor
[1:31:00] instead of increased in goods and
[1:31:02] prosperity you're really naked and blind
[1:31:06] and wretched
[1:31:08] and without hope
[1:31:10] i talk about an eye-opener
[1:31:12] this is an eye-opener and when a message
[1:31:15] like this comes to the modern church
[1:31:19] she hardly has the faith
[1:31:21] to receive such a message as this it's
[1:31:24] not prosperity it's not positive
[1:31:26] thinking
[1:31:28] are you with me
[1:31:30] it's not osteen enough
[1:31:37] and so the church of this hour has a
[1:31:40] hard time
[1:31:42] recognizing when a message comes like
[1:31:44] that to dress her
[1:31:47] and to open her eyes
[1:31:50] and to help her to recognize her real
[1:31:52] condition
[1:31:54] she usually puts up all of her her
[1:31:57] blocks and
[1:31:58] and and her barricades and her barriers
[1:32:02] and she says i don't want anything to do
[1:32:04] with that and it's a very sad reality in
[1:32:07] the hour we live in if you know that and
[1:32:09] believe that same man
[1:32:11] but he said as many
[1:32:13] as i love
[1:32:17] this is jesus
[1:32:20] jesus is love
[1:32:22] how many of you know he is love
[1:32:25] jesus loves the sinner how many of you
[1:32:27] know he loves the sinner
[1:32:30] oh yes and he's not ashamed to be seen
[1:32:33] with the sinner
[1:32:35] he's not ashamed to take the lowly path
[1:32:38] of those who are deprived to those who
[1:32:41] are depraved to those who have fallen
[1:32:43] and who have yielded themselves to sin
[1:32:46] but listen
[1:32:48] the same jesus says as many as i love i
[1:32:52] rebuke
[1:32:53] and chasten
[1:32:55] is this red letter in your bible look
[1:32:57] and see
[1:32:58] this is red letter if you've got a red
[1:33:00] letter edition
[1:33:02] this is the words of jesus this isn't
[1:33:04] the preacher talking
[1:33:06] this isn't an apostle talking
[1:33:08] this is the savior talking
[1:33:10] the one who so loved the church
[1:33:14] that he gave his life to redeem her
[1:33:17] no man ever paid such a price for the
[1:33:21] church as jesus did
[1:33:23] and if anybody has gained the right and
[1:33:26] the privilege to bring correction to
[1:33:28] that church that he died for jesus has
[1:33:32] and he said as many as i love i rebuke
[1:33:35] and chasten be zealous therefore and do
[1:33:38] what
[1:33:39] repent
[1:33:41] he's not talking to the sinner
[1:33:44] he's not talking to the unrelieved
[1:33:47] he's talking to his church
[1:33:50] so even the church of god needs to
[1:33:54] repent
[1:33:56] and recognize that we have stepped off
[1:33:58] the path
[1:34:00] even in this house we have the need to
[1:34:04] come back and say lord
[1:34:06] i have confused things along the way
[1:34:09] i've missed the path that you have
[1:34:12] chosen for me and so i'm going to be
[1:34:14] zealous
[1:34:16] not to labor my way into the kingdom
[1:34:20] but i'm going to be zealous to repent my
[1:34:23] way into the kingdom of god
[1:34:26] what a glorious privilege is given to us
[1:34:29] in repentance
[1:34:30] if you believe that's amen
[1:34:32] behold listen behold i stand
[1:34:39] at the door and knock
[1:34:41] if any man hear my voice
[1:34:44] and open the door i will come into him
[1:34:47] and we'll sup with him and he with me
[1:34:50] can you help me to see can you help me
[1:34:53] to discover what door it is
[1:34:56] that jesus is knocking on in the
[1:34:58] reference here
[1:35:00] this is not knocking on our heart this
[1:35:03] is what the church has said the bible
[1:35:05] doesn't say he's knocking on the door of
[1:35:07] our heart
[1:35:08] this is jesus knocking on the door of
[1:35:11] his own church
[1:35:13] he's speaking to laodicea
[1:35:16] he's speaking to a church that has put
[1:35:18] him out
[1:35:19] and he said behold i stand at the door
[1:35:22] and not
[1:35:23] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:35:26] door i will come into him and we'll sup
[1:35:29] with him and he with me he's talking to
[1:35:33] the church that has put him on the
[1:35:35] outside
[1:35:36] now is it true that by the spirit of
[1:35:39] conviction jesus knocks on our heart and
[1:35:42] calls us to repentance absolutely so
[1:35:45] but the church has taken this verse and
[1:35:48] casually placed it on the salvation
[1:35:51] experience
[1:35:53] because they don't want to deal with the
[1:35:55] reality of the context
[1:35:57] and the context is i have been shut out
[1:36:01] of my own church
[1:36:03] help me
[1:36:05] she's got all kinds of programs my name
[1:36:08] is on the door
[1:36:11] it's all about me they say
[1:36:14] and yet they have been without me so
[1:36:16] long
[1:36:18] that they don't even recognize i'm not
[1:36:20] in them i'm not with them anymore
[1:36:23] i'm standing on the outside of a locked
[1:36:25] door and i'm knocking to come into my
[1:36:28] church
[1:36:30] to sup with my own people
[1:36:32] to have fellowship with those who say
[1:36:35] they wear my name
[1:36:38] very very serious indictment and i know
[1:36:41] you already know this can we read on
[1:36:44] just a moment here
[1:36:47] is there another verse there's not
[1:36:49] another verse
[1:36:51] 21 i'm thinking
[1:36:53] yeah let's do 21.
[1:36:58] it should be in the original in the
[1:37:00] original document we had
[1:37:02] 21. give us just a moment
[1:37:06] to him
[1:37:07] that overcometh
[1:37:14] here he's talking about
[1:37:16] a church
[1:37:17] that's mistaken
[1:37:19] in her own identity
[1:37:22] she says i'm this
[1:37:24] and jesus says you're none of that
[1:37:27] you're something entirely different than
[1:37:30] what you have testified
[1:37:32] we're talking about a church where jesus
[1:37:35] says i'm actually knocking on the
[1:37:36] outside you want to find me
[1:37:39] you can't find me around the altar
[1:37:43] you can't find me in your revival
[1:37:44] meeting
[1:37:46] you can only find me at the door
[1:37:49] you put me out
[1:37:51] brother branham said it's jesus sitting
[1:37:52] in the corner
[1:37:54] just like he was in the end of his life
[1:37:57] in the gospels
[1:37:59] invited to a party
[1:38:01] invited to a gathering and yet he came
[1:38:04] in and there was no one to wash his feet
[1:38:07] come on
[1:38:08] there was no one to anoint his head or
[1:38:11] anoint his feet or welcome him to the
[1:38:13] party until this prostitute comes in
[1:38:16] think about it
[1:38:18] a fallen woman a woman who had a
[1:38:21] reputation of living with with all kinds
[1:38:24] of men and servicing all kinds of men
[1:38:28] and her reputation was well known and
[1:38:31] any money that she made was not made
[1:38:34] from from virtuous work
[1:38:38] it was made from prostitution and yet
[1:38:40] she comes in and she wants to worship
[1:38:45] the lord
[1:38:47] and as soon as she begins to break her
[1:38:50] heart open before the lord and wash his
[1:38:53] feet and anoint his feet and dry his
[1:38:57] feet with the hairs of her head which
[1:38:59] again is another story
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:04] i know you're having a hard time
[1:39:07] don't have a hard time have a good time
[1:39:09] come on have an easy time get with me
[1:39:12] and let's see if we can go somewhere
[1:39:14] here's a modern church that could not
[1:39:16] even fulfill this kind of a thing
[1:39:19] because she's chopped her hair off
[1:39:23] she wanted to look so much like a man
[1:39:26] that she she's chopped her hair off so
[1:39:29] that she could look like a man
[1:39:31] and how in the world would that woman
[1:39:34] representing the church be able to dry
[1:39:37] his feet
[1:39:39] with her butch haircut
[1:39:41] it's absolutely impossible you can say
[1:39:43] amen oh me or we don't you know it's
[1:39:45] still the truth so far away
[1:39:49] here's a prostitute because in this hour
[1:39:52] even the ungodly all women
[1:39:56] they knew that it was a virtue
[1:39:59] for some the only virtue they had
[1:40:01] to keep uncut hair
[1:40:04] here's this woman not missing her
[1:40:06] opportunity to do what everybody in that
[1:40:09] party should have been doing all the
[1:40:11] guests there should have been honoring
[1:40:13] his presence and welcoming him there but
[1:40:16] she was the only one that saw the value
[1:40:21] in his presence
[1:40:23] she was so glad that she had this
[1:40:25] opportunity that she pressed in without
[1:40:28] an invitation
[1:40:30] she wasn't invited to this social event
[1:40:32] but she passed and saw him going in and
[1:40:36] she said i must go and worship him
[1:40:39] i've got to show my thanks giving my
[1:40:42] thankfulness and my gratitude to him and
[1:40:44] that is what she did and wasn't that a
[1:40:46] rebuke and here the disciples raised up
[1:40:49] don't you know don't you know they're
[1:40:50] all talking all over whispering all
[1:40:52] don't you know what kind of woman that
[1:40:53] is can they see what kind of woman he's
[1:40:56] going to ruin his sterling reputation by
[1:40:58] rubbing around with a woman like that oh
[1:41:00] she's touching his feet
[1:41:04] and jesus said i came in here and nobody
[1:41:08] bid me welcome nobody anointed my head
[1:41:10] nobody anointed my feet and this woman
[1:41:13] has unceasingly done these things
[1:41:16] since she arrived and jesus was putting
[1:41:19] greater value on her dedication to him
[1:41:22] than all of those that had invited him
[1:41:24] to the party to draw a crowd so they
[1:41:26] could have a higher esteem in the
[1:41:27] community they didn't really want him
[1:41:29] there
[1:41:30] listen the church of today the modern
[1:41:33] church of today would be better off
[1:41:36] if he wouldn't bother them at all
[1:41:41] they're using his name
[1:41:44] as a way to draw but they have
[1:41:46] unwelcomed his presence
[1:41:49] you don't have to say anything
[1:41:51] they've unwelcomed his presence
[1:41:53] so he's either in the corner with dirty
[1:41:55] feet or lucked out of the church
[1:41:58] altogether knocking on the door of his
[1:41:59] own house i don't know about you
[1:42:03] but i don't like the idea
[1:42:06] of somebody locking me out of my own
[1:42:08] house
[1:42:11] we once had a tenant
[1:42:13] in jerusalem
[1:42:15] who wanted to lock us out
[1:42:17] of our own house
[1:42:21] that is a
[1:42:23] tough feeling
[1:42:25] it's hard to get past that one
[1:42:28] you're really going to want to throw
[1:42:30] somebody out on their head
[1:42:33] when out of the goodness of your heart
[1:42:35] you're allowing someone
[1:42:37] to stay somewhere their time is up now
[1:42:39] it's time for them to go and they let
[1:42:41] you know i have no intention of leaving
[1:42:43] your home
[1:42:45] now that's that gets serious this
[1:42:46] happened to us not not just once in
[1:42:48] israel happened to us twice
[1:42:50] and both times the lord prevailed and
[1:42:52] made a way and so forth and we got the
[1:42:54] keys to our own house back
[1:42:56] i want you to know it's a pretty
[1:42:58] uh
[1:43:01] awful feeling
[1:43:02] to think you're being locked out of your
[1:43:04] own house
[1:43:05] and jesus is standing outside of his own
[1:43:08] church in this hour knocking to get in
[1:43:10] nothing could be a sadder picture than
[1:43:12] this
[1:43:13] and he immediately moves i hope you're
[1:43:16] with me
[1:43:17] he immediately moves from this very sad
[1:43:21] description
[1:43:22] of the last day church
[1:43:24] and speaks to the overcomer watch this
[1:43:27] to him that overcometh
[1:43:30] overcometh here's jesus locked out
[1:43:33] here's jesus shut out here here's a
[1:43:36] church that thinks she's this when in
[1:43:38] reality she's something else and then
[1:43:40] all of a sudden jesus has a message for
[1:43:43] those who overcome to him that
[1:43:45] overcometh will i grant to sit with me
[1:43:49] in my
[1:43:50] throne even as i also overcame
[1:43:57] and am set down with my father
[1:44:01] in his throne
[1:44:02] this is the promise to the overcomers of
[1:44:06] laodicea let me ask you are there any
[1:44:09] overcomers here this morning
[1:44:13] is there anybody here that by the grace
[1:44:16] of god
[1:44:18] and by the anointing of the flying eagle
[1:44:22] you have every intention of being one of
[1:44:25] those
[1:44:27] who overcomes the spirit of this age and
[1:44:31] all the other ages
[1:44:33] culminated into this hour
[1:44:35] you plan to sit with him in his throne
[1:44:39] even as i also overcame and am set down
[1:44:43] with my father in his throne this may be
[1:44:46] disputable but some have said that this
[1:44:50] is the greatest honor
[1:44:53] that is promised to the overcomer of any
[1:44:56] age so far
[1:44:57] that he saved the highest position of
[1:45:00] authority for those who overcome the
[1:45:03] darkest and the most evil of all ages
[1:45:06] for to them it is granted that they
[1:45:09] would sit with him in his throne even as
[1:45:11] he sat as he overcame and sat down with
[1:45:14] his father in his throne is there
[1:45:16] another verse there or are we at the end
[1:45:18] of that chapter he that hath an ear
[1:45:22] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:45:26] the churches
[1:45:27] he that hath an ear would you read that
[1:45:28] with me he that hath an ear again he
[1:45:32] that hath an ear it's a powerful phrase
[1:45:36] and it's a repeated phrase
[1:45:39] and if you want to jot this down
[1:45:40] revelation 2 7 says he that hath an ear
[1:45:44] revelation 2 11 he that hath an ear
[1:45:47] revelation 2 17 he that hath an ear
[1:45:51] revelation 2 29 he that hath an ear
[1:45:54] revelation 3 6 he that hath an ear
[1:45:58] revelation 3 13 he that hath an ear
[1:46:01] revelation 3 22 he that hath an ear
[1:46:07] it sounds to me like that one of the
[1:46:10] keys
[1:46:12] to overcoming anything that the enemy
[1:46:16] launches against you is to have an ear
[1:46:19] to hear what the spirit says to the
[1:46:23] church
[1:46:24] i said it seems to me like
[1:46:27] that it's a key
[1:46:29] having an ear to hear
[1:46:31] what the spirit is saying to the church
[1:46:34] did you know everybody doesn't have that
[1:46:36] spiritual ear
[1:46:38] to discern what the spirit of the lord
[1:46:41] is saying to his church in the last days
[1:46:44] may god grant you in our grace to be one
[1:46:46] of those who has an ear to hear what the
[1:46:49] spirit is saying
[1:46:51] now in a message turn on the light if
[1:46:54] you'll show me that one please 1964.
[1:46:59] he said
[1:47:00] remember
[1:47:04] this
[1:47:05] is the seventh
[1:47:07] church age
[1:47:09] the laodicean
[1:47:11] church age
[1:47:13] according to revelation 3
[1:47:16] they
[1:47:17] reject
[1:47:19] christ
[1:47:20] you can't change the continuity of the
[1:47:22] word
[1:47:23] this church age has rejected christ
[1:47:26] of every church age that was mentioned
[1:47:30] in the bible
[1:47:33] now here is a disputed fact in fact i've
[1:47:35] had someone here in the church dispute
[1:47:37] this when i have said it before in the
[1:47:40] past when i mention that laodicea is the
[1:47:43] worst of the age ages i've had someone
[1:47:46] raise up and say well i don't think it's
[1:47:49] any worse than any of the other ages
[1:47:51] we look back at those who were
[1:47:53] slaughtered and murdered and stood and
[1:47:55] so forth i'm just telling you what the
[1:47:57] scriptures is showing us here and what
[1:47:59] the message of the hour is showing us
[1:48:01] laodicea age was worst of all of them
[1:48:07] and here's why
[1:48:09] it turned him out
[1:48:11] it rejected him
[1:48:14] it put him on the outside so jesus is
[1:48:18] standing outside the modern church in
[1:48:22] the laodicean church age are you with me
[1:48:25] and then in the message turn on the
[1:48:27] light let's look at it 1964 turn on the
[1:48:30] light same message but a little bit a
[1:48:33] little bit
[1:48:34] uh
[1:48:35] closer to the beginning of the message
[1:48:37] he said but the thing is today
[1:48:41] the church grain
[1:48:43] don't want to mature
[1:48:46] it wants to stay like it was back in
[1:48:49] moody's time
[1:48:51] sankey finney knox calvin they were all
[1:48:56] right
[1:49:00] they were the light
[1:49:02] of the hour
[1:49:04] this is powerful
[1:49:06] this is the period of the reformers
[1:49:09] it's the age of the man
[1:49:12] and god was faithful in that church age
[1:49:16] to have a man like a moody
[1:49:19] a man like a finney
[1:49:21] a man like a knox a man like a calvin he
[1:49:24] said they were all right
[1:49:26] they were the light of the hour we could
[1:49:30] say they were the light of their
[1:49:33] hour
[1:49:35] but this
[1:49:36] is another hour
[1:49:39] this is another day now look at this
[1:49:43] this phrase
[1:49:44] this is the advancement
[1:49:47] of the gospel
[1:49:49] i'm telling you that's a powerful
[1:49:51] message
[1:49:52] the gospel the good news has come to a
[1:49:56] higher
[1:49:57] level
[1:49:58] there has been an advancement
[1:50:01] in the gospel
[1:50:03] why because it's coming to its maturity
[1:50:09] we could say based on that phrase that
[1:50:12] it's getting ready to produce a mature
[1:50:14] harvest
[1:50:16] he said so we can't live in what luther
[1:50:19] said
[1:50:24] to say i'm i'm lutheran
[1:50:26] but then you're only part of the way
[1:50:28] there
[1:50:30] we can't live
[1:50:31] in what luther said somebody said well
[1:50:33] i'm wesleyan you can't live only in what
[1:50:36] wesley said
[1:50:38] or some of the rest of them
[1:50:40] we're living in the light
[1:50:43] that's predicted
[1:50:45] or we could say prophesied for this day
[1:50:49] so what we do is we take the truth of
[1:50:52] luther
[1:50:53] and we take the truth of wesley and we
[1:50:56] take the truth of pentecost and we let
[1:50:59] it sit in the light that has been
[1:51:02] prophesied for this day and then we
[1:51:05] apply it to our life
[1:51:08] and when we do that it releases an
[1:51:11] anointing to overcome
[1:51:13] anything that the enemy would launch
[1:51:17] against you
[1:51:19] i
[1:51:20] am anointed to overcome anything
[1:51:26] not because i'm anything but because the
[1:51:28] one who anoints me
[1:51:30] see
[1:51:32] this is the hour where the yoke is
[1:51:35] destroyed
[1:51:37] this is the hour where god brings forth
[1:51:39] the people and he fills them with the
[1:51:42] fatness
[1:51:44] of his anointing
[1:51:46] yes it's the oil of his glory
[1:51:51] and it causes her neck
[1:51:54] her strength
[1:51:56] to be renewed
[1:51:58] is anybody with me
[1:52:00] the neck represents the strength of the
[1:52:04] man
[1:52:05] not
[1:52:11] not what some of you sisters say
[1:52:15] one who i'm
[1:52:16] one who's streaming right now
[1:52:18] particularly comes to mind
[1:52:20] who just recently said this to me and it
[1:52:21] just make made me laugh real good
[1:52:25] because we all know that
[1:52:27] we all know that the man is a is the
[1:52:30] head of that house
[1:52:32] but i just loved it how the little
[1:52:33] sister said this she said oh yes he's
[1:52:36] the head of the house but you know i'm
[1:52:38] the neck
[1:52:42] see how quiet it gets there's some big
[1:52:44] old necks in this house
[1:52:48] what was she saying what what are people
[1:52:50] saying when they say that let me mean it
[1:52:52] i just turn
[1:52:53] the head down the neck i just
[1:52:56] turned why this is bible
[1:53:02] somebody said what do you mean is bible
[1:53:03] i didn't say the bible says it's right
[1:53:06] but the bible tells us what a woman can
[1:53:09] do and how she can lead a man
[1:53:12] right
[1:53:14] this is not the neck i'm talking about
[1:53:17] this isn't the female neck
[1:53:20] or is it it's the bride's neck
[1:53:23] it's the strength of the lord it's the
[1:53:26] fatness of the lord one version said
[1:53:29] it's the prosperity
[1:53:31] of the lord upon her and it causes her
[1:53:35] neck to be so large that the yoke that
[1:53:38] oh my
[1:53:40] i like this
[1:53:42] that the yoke that once enslaved her
[1:53:46] can no longer contain her
[1:53:50] because of the blessing
[1:53:52] and the anointing
[1:53:54] and the oil of the lord the fatness of
[1:53:57] the lord that's being poured out on her
[1:54:00] is anybody with me
[1:54:02] all right good now it's time to refresh
[1:54:05] it's 12 57 we have just a little bit of
[1:54:08] time left
[1:54:10] i want us to look again at the summary
[1:54:14] i want us to look again at the summary
[1:54:17] of the end time
[1:54:19] for just a
[1:54:20] moment we looked at this just a few
[1:54:23] weeks ago
[1:54:25] it's questions and answers
[1:54:28] question number 392
[1:54:31] the church age ending
[1:54:34] and has blacked out
[1:54:36] the bride is called
[1:54:39] we have already entered into
[1:54:42] the tribulation period question mark
[1:54:46] someone
[1:54:48] is assuming
[1:54:51] when you assume you venture without
[1:54:53] authority
[1:54:55] someone has been sitting in these
[1:54:56] anointed messages that brother branham
[1:54:59] has been preaching
[1:55:00] and he has placed them by that anointed
[1:55:03] word into heavenly places in christ
[1:55:06] jesus come on i've been there
[1:55:08] i've been sitting in my home when the
[1:55:10] prophet placed me in heavenly places in
[1:55:13] christ jesus by the word he was
[1:55:15] preaching i could feel myself being
[1:55:17] lifted up
[1:55:19] and strengthened and encouraged by the
[1:55:22] anointed word of god so someone has been
[1:55:24] under the influence of the message that
[1:55:27] brother branham has been preaching and
[1:55:28] they are assuming
[1:55:31] that by what he is saying we have
[1:55:33] already entered into the tribulation
[1:55:36] period
[1:55:37] now i want you to see what brother
[1:55:38] branham's answer is
[1:55:40] it's pretty emphatic
[1:55:42] no
[1:55:45] no
[1:55:47] no
[1:55:51] i wished
[1:55:53] that i could just have more time on that
[1:55:54] see
[1:55:55] the bride
[1:55:57] when she's taken from the church
[1:56:02] then the church age
[1:56:04] will
[1:56:05] cease
[1:56:08] now if we were really studying this and
[1:56:10] had all kinds of time and you were
[1:56:12] really pulling this morning
[1:56:13] we could take a moment here
[1:56:15] and we could balance out
[1:56:18] these different statements that the
[1:56:20] prophet made concerning the ending of
[1:56:22] laodicea and the beginning of a bright
[1:56:25] age
[1:56:26] and i can show you places where he
[1:56:29] seemed to indicate that the rapture
[1:56:31] would be the beginning of the bright age
[1:56:34] and i can show you places where he be
[1:56:36] where he seemed to indicate that once
[1:56:38] the message catches you out of the
[1:56:40] church not the bride out of the earth
[1:56:43] but once the message catches you out of
[1:56:46] the church the bright age has already
[1:56:48] began for you
[1:56:50] but we're not going to have the time to
[1:56:52] lay i have them or they're here
[1:56:54] but i'm not going to take the time to
[1:56:56] balance those out for you this morning
[1:56:58] when you might not yet be interested in
[1:57:01] hearing that
[1:57:02] but here he says
[1:57:04] when she's taken from the church
[1:57:07] then the church age will cease
[1:57:11] and he goes on
[1:57:13] laodicea
[1:57:14] goes into
[1:57:16] chaos the bride goes
[1:57:20] to glory
[1:57:23] and the tribulation period
[1:57:26] sets in
[1:57:28] upon the sleeping virgin
[1:57:31] for this is important if you have any
[1:57:33] interest in end time events this next
[1:57:35] statement is very important for three
[1:57:37] and a half years
[1:57:40] there is no more
[1:57:42] seven year tribulation ahead of us
[1:57:47] at the time of rapture
[1:57:49] there will only be three and a half
[1:57:52] years of tribulation
[1:57:54] left the week has been divided for us
[1:57:58] and the first part of that week
[1:58:01] has been fulfilled during the early
[1:58:04] ministry of the lord jesus christ so we
[1:58:08] are not looking for a seven year
[1:58:09] tribulation period now can anybody see
[1:58:12] the year can you can you look there and
[1:58:14] see the year 1964.
[1:58:18] it doesn't get any later than that
[1:58:20] except 65.
[1:58:22] so i don't care what you might read in
[1:58:25] other places or here in other places
[1:58:28] this is how brother branham was teaching
[1:58:30] the end time
[1:58:32] concerning the tribulation period
[1:58:34] if you go to the assembly of god or the
[1:58:36] church of god or the baptist or
[1:58:38] methodist or some other groups you will
[1:58:40] find them still preaching very strongly
[1:58:43] that there will be another seven year
[1:58:45] tribulation period and that's simply
[1:58:47] because they've missed the fact that the
[1:58:50] week was divided by the ministry of the
[1:58:52] lord jesus christ it has been fulfilled
[1:58:55] every bit of it is going to have its
[1:58:57] fulfillment
[1:58:58] but we're looking for the three and a
[1:59:00] half years left while israel is getting
[1:59:04] its prophecy
[1:59:05] now that's the ministry
[1:59:07] of who
[1:59:09] the two witnesses and the 144 thousand
[1:59:13] that are sealed for that purpose
[1:59:16] then tribulation sets in upon israel
[1:59:21] then comes the battle of armageddon
[1:59:24] which destroys all things that's pretty
[1:59:26] serious isn't it you really believe this
[1:59:28] one day you really believe the events
[1:59:30] are going to unfold like this
[1:59:32] oh i do
[1:59:34] i do
[1:59:36] i do i believe they're unfolding now
[1:59:39] i believe they're unfolding now
[1:59:41] it's an unpopular message but i believe
[1:59:43] they're unfolding now
[1:59:45] and then the bride returns back with the
[1:59:48] groom for a thousand years the
[1:59:51] millennium reign after that comes the
[1:59:53] white throne judgment after that comes
[1:59:56] the new heavens and new earth and the
[1:59:58] new city coming down from god out of
[2:00:00] heaven eternity and time blends together
[2:00:04] now i'm going to bring that quotation to
[2:00:06] you often
[2:00:09] any time that we start talking about end
[2:00:12] time events i want to bring that back in
[2:00:14] front of you because i want you always
[2:00:17] to have a reference
[2:00:19] for the order
[2:00:21] of things to come i hear people saying
[2:00:23] stupid things
[2:00:27] i hear people saying stupid things
[2:00:30] such as why it doesn't matter how all
[2:00:32] this is going to come it doesn't matter
[2:00:34] how at all
[2:00:36] i'm going to be there as long as i'm
[2:00:37] there i'm going to go jesus is going to
[2:00:39] be all right
[2:00:41] now this is a stupid statement to make
[2:00:44] it's how quiet it's going to get in here
[2:00:46] i'm not calling you stupid
[2:00:48] you know better that's what makes it so
[2:00:49] bad
[2:00:50] when people make statements like that
[2:00:53] then you're actually denying the word
[2:00:57] because the lord went to a whole lot of
[2:01:00] trouble to get you and i the revelation
[2:01:03] of jesus christ
[2:01:05] listen john paid a prize
[2:01:10] boiled in oil banished to patmos
[2:01:14] where he had to live under the threat of
[2:01:16] wild beasts
[2:01:18] and thieves that had been banished there
[2:01:20] for their punishment he could have been
[2:01:22] murdered at any time
[2:01:24] then he was boiled in oil first you know
[2:01:27] boiled in oil like a french fry
[2:01:32] who's ever heard of being fried in oil
[2:01:34] and having no effect on your body
[2:01:37] god was preserving him
[2:01:39] but it cost him something
[2:01:42] he's the only one of those disciples who
[2:01:44] went out into punishment like that and
[2:01:46] came back to live to tell about it
[2:01:48] and the greatest portion of his ministry
[2:01:51] took place after he had overcome the oil
[2:01:54] and after he had overcome the isle of
[2:01:56] patmos
[2:01:58] and he preserved this word god was
[2:02:01] speaking to him about end time events
[2:02:03] and he preserved this word for us in
[2:02:05] fact some of it had to be sealed up
[2:02:07] until a very special moment in time when
[2:02:10] god was going to lose that and then a
[2:02:12] generation ago god sent a prophet who
[2:02:14] could capture the mind of god and who
[2:02:17] could help us
[2:02:19] to understand what was underneath those
[2:02:22] things
[2:02:23] and as brother brooks preached while he
[2:02:25] was here the the understanding of every
[2:02:27] symbol
[2:02:29] every symbol in the book of revelation
[2:02:31] we now have understanding of what that
[2:02:33] represented what that type was what that
[2:02:36] symbol was how many of you know we're
[2:02:38] blessed
[2:02:39] oh people we're blessed to have heard
[2:02:42] what we have heard we are blessed
[2:02:45] and so look at all the sacrifices that
[2:02:47] were made to help you and i in the end
[2:02:50] time know
[2:02:52] what was going to unfold in our hour so
[2:02:55] don't tell me it doesn't matter
[2:02:57] don't tell me it doesn't matter how how
[2:02:59] you're baptized
[2:03:02] the bible says it does
[2:03:04] don't tell me it doesn't matter if god's
[2:03:05] one or god's three the bible said it
[2:03:08] does
[2:03:09] somebody said i don't think doctrine
[2:03:11] matters much at all i want you to know
[2:03:13] you're very very deceived
[2:03:16] if you make such a statement like that
[2:03:19] because without sound doctrine we are
[2:03:22] like ships
[2:03:24] without a sail
[2:03:27] we're just floating along on the sea of
[2:03:30] life but because god gave a revelation
[2:03:33] of jesus christ which is not just a
[2:03:35] doctrine it's an eternal truth
[2:03:37] come on now
[2:03:39] we need to know it we need to see it we
[2:03:41] need to be able to understand it as much
[2:03:43] as possible we need to prepare for it
[2:03:45] and we need to tell our family
[2:03:49] you're about to see some things unfold
[2:03:52] on planet earth
[2:03:54] don't be surprised
[2:03:56] this is how it's going to go
[2:03:59] so to say that having an understanding
[2:04:01] of the end not having an understanding
[2:04:03] of the end time is okay
[2:04:05] it's like saying i don't need a
[2:04:06] revelation of jesus christ
[2:04:09] because the revelation of jesus christ
[2:04:12] is who he is in this hour and at every
[2:04:15] hour to come
[2:04:16] it's what he was then what he is today
[2:04:18] jesus christ the same what
[2:04:21] yesterday today and forever so don't
[2:04:24] make statements like that because you've
[2:04:26] perhaps in the past been confused or
[2:04:28] bored
[2:04:29] some of you are bored with me but i
[2:04:31] don't have the i don't have the
[2:04:33] privilege of saying okay what does it
[2:04:34] matter no matter the board so let's just
[2:04:36] go in and not not worry with that we
[2:04:38] have to worry with it
[2:04:39] whether you have a near to hear it or
[2:04:41] not because it's our obligation to bring
[2:04:44] this to your attention because we know
[2:04:47] there's going to be overcomers in the
[2:04:48] last day
[2:04:50] and so he goes on time and eternity will
[2:04:52] blend together now i want to read a
[2:04:54] quotation before we go
[2:04:57] from the church age book and i'm not
[2:04:59] going to go into all of my explanations
[2:05:01] of what i how i feel about the church
[2:05:03] age book
[2:05:05] i'm just going to tell you that i've
[2:05:06] read these very very carefully and i
[2:05:08] believe them to be based right on the
[2:05:10] word
[2:05:11] so this is from the sardisian church age
[2:05:14] and it says see
[2:05:16] this this scripture by the way i mean
[2:05:19] this quotation by the way is
[2:05:21] directly referencing revelation 3 21
[2:05:25] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[2:05:28] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[2:05:32] overcame and am set down with my father
[2:05:35] in his throne
[2:05:37] see the bride is with him in
[2:05:41] the throne would you say in the throne
[2:05:43] in the throne
[2:05:46] and she is to judge the world
[2:05:50] she has to be sitting in the judgment
[2:05:53] with him
[2:05:55] there's a powerful statement coming here
[2:05:57] that is exactly what daniel saw
[2:06:03] now he goes on and this was in the uh i
[2:06:07] gave you this this morning so i don't
[2:06:09] know if you found it or not
[2:06:10] because i stopped there in the original
[2:06:13] but then i decided i wanted to go on and
[2:06:15] finish this paragraph
[2:06:17] and he quotes
[2:06:18] daniel 7 you should see it there
[2:06:21] 9-10
[2:06:24] i beheld
[2:06:26] till the thrones were cast down
[2:06:29] and the ancient of days did sit
[2:06:32] whose garment was white as snow
[2:06:35] and the hair of his head like the pure
[2:06:38] wool his throne was like the fiery flame
[2:06:41] his wheels as burning fire a fiery
[2:06:46] stream issued and came forth from before
[2:06:49] him
[2:06:50] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[2:06:54] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[2:06:57] stood before him the judgment was set
[2:07:01] and the books were opened and i've just
[2:07:04] read from daniel 7
[2:07:07] verses 9 and 10
[2:07:09] and then the quote continues see
[2:07:13] it is the same scene
[2:07:17] first he has spoken about
[2:07:20] the overcomers
[2:07:22] sitting with jesus in his throne
[2:07:25] then
[2:07:26] he takes us to daniel
[2:07:28] to the ancient of days
[2:07:31] then he ties the two together by saying
[2:07:34] see
[2:07:35] it is the same scene
[2:07:38] for the thousand thousands
[2:07:41] who are ministering to him
[2:07:44] are the bride
[2:07:48] this powerful truth
[2:07:51] churches weren't
[2:07:52] teaching any connection
[2:07:55] between
[2:07:57] the bride sitting with jesus in his
[2:07:59] throne
[2:08:00] and the ancient of days and those
[2:08:02] thousands times ten thousands of men of
[2:08:05] those who were ministering to him so
[2:08:07] brother branham is bringing us some
[2:08:09] revelation here he said for those who
[2:08:12] are ministering to him are the bride for
[2:08:15] who ministers to the husband but the
[2:08:18] wife
[2:08:20] and you won't worship
[2:08:22] the lord
[2:08:24] when you have an opportunity to
[2:08:27] help me
[2:08:29] you won't push in a little bit and
[2:08:32] raise your hands and
[2:08:34] really minister
[2:08:37] do you understand that when we worship
[2:08:40] the lord as we did this morning we are
[2:08:43] ministering to him and do you understand
[2:08:46] that this is going to be a part of our
[2:08:49] daily existence throughout the 1 000
[2:08:52] years of millennium we are going to sit
[2:08:55] with him in his throne judging the
[2:08:59] nations and ministering to him with our
[2:09:02] praise
[2:09:04] somebody said that sounds like the most
[2:09:06] boring eternity i can imagine well
[2:09:08] that's because it's been too long since
[2:09:11] you've had a moment in the presence of
[2:09:13] the lord
[2:09:14] if you've had a moment in the presence
[2:09:17] of the lord you will understand that you
[2:09:21] become the beneficiary
[2:09:23] you are offering your praise to him and
[2:09:27] you are receiving the benefit
[2:09:30] you are receiving strength and the glory
[2:09:34] of the lord is strengthening your neck
[2:09:37] so that no yoke the devil forms against
[2:09:39] you will be able to bind you and hold
[2:09:42] you back
[2:09:43] and you're really ministering your own
[2:09:46] deliverance
[2:09:50] when you worship the lord and when you
[2:09:52] praise the lord you're really
[2:09:54] ministering your own deliverance that's
[2:09:56] why you'll see people refusing to praise
[2:09:58] him because they're not interested in
[2:10:01] deliverance they're not looking for
[2:10:03] deliverance they're looking for
[2:10:05] something else
[2:10:06] once people understand the significance
[2:10:09] of entering into the presence of the
[2:10:12] lord and pouring your praise on him
[2:10:15] you forget about what other people are
[2:10:17] doing
[2:10:17] [Music]
[2:10:20] i'm telling you they could be slapping
[2:10:21] you upside the head with a banner
[2:10:24] [Music]
[2:10:26] and you are so lost in what you're doing
[2:10:30] they could be turning cartwheels across
[2:10:32] the front
[2:10:33] and you're not sitting there saying look
[2:10:35] at that soulish manifestation look at
[2:10:37] them they're in the flesh
[2:10:39] you're so lost
[2:10:41] in your ministry to the lord
[2:10:45] did you know some people would rather
[2:10:46] minister up here than they would rather
[2:10:48] minister to the lord i want you to know
[2:10:51] my survival
[2:10:53] is not based on what i do up here
[2:10:56] my survival is based on what i do just
[2:10:59] me and him
[2:11:00] when i take that moment to minister my
[2:11:03] praise to him
[2:11:06] and brother branham said the same scene
[2:11:08] we read about in revelation 3 21 it's
[2:11:11] the same scene we read about in daniel
[2:11:13] chapter 7 verses 9 and 10 because nobody
[2:11:17] will be able to minister to the husband
[2:11:20] like the wife
[2:11:24] just a moment
[2:11:27] hallelujah
[2:11:30] in the smernian church age
[2:11:33] the quotation starts off character
[2:11:36] look at it a moment
[2:11:38] character
[2:11:39] is a victory
[2:11:42] not a gift
[2:11:44] do you know what that means
[2:11:47] do you know that means you're gonna have
[2:11:48] to fight
[2:11:49] to have
[2:11:50] character you're going to have to fight
[2:11:53] to have integrity
[2:11:54] the character and integrity of jesus is
[2:11:56] not just going to fall on you the
[2:11:58] inspiration that you can have it will
[2:12:01] fall on you
[2:12:02] and then you're going to have to fight
[2:12:04] hell
[2:12:05] are you willing to fight hell
[2:12:08] you're going to have to fight hell to
[2:12:09] press in
[2:12:11] because it's one thing what you do in
[2:12:13] the spotlight it's another thing what
[2:12:15] you do when there's nobody but you and
[2:12:17] him
[2:12:18] that's that's how we know a man has
[2:12:20] integrity by what he does when no one is
[2:12:22] looking or what a woman does when no one
[2:12:25] is looking and brother branham wanted to
[2:12:27] make sure that we understood that though
[2:12:29] we are going to have the attributes and
[2:12:31] character of jesus christ it's not going
[2:12:33] to fall on us like ripe cherries from a
[2:12:36] tree it's going to require a warfare
[2:12:39] but we have the victory
[2:12:42] are you with me
[2:12:43] character is a victory
[2:12:46] not a gift we're nearly done
[2:12:48] a man without character can't reign
[2:12:52] because power apart from character is
[2:12:56] satanic
[2:12:57] we see that in the new age
[2:13:00] but power with character is fit
[2:13:04] to rule
[2:13:05] you want to be fit to rule
[2:13:07] that's what you're called to do you
[2:13:09] might as well win the victory you might
[2:13:11] as well press into his character he goes
[2:13:14] on and since he wants us
[2:13:17] to share
[2:13:18] even his throne
[2:13:22] hallelujah
[2:13:26] this is a powerful invitation
[2:13:30] don't want you just to spend a thousand
[2:13:31] years on your face before my throne
[2:13:35] but i am inviting you to share my throne
[2:13:40] to sit with me in my throne as
[2:13:43] overcomers
[2:13:44] even as i overcome and have sat down
[2:13:47] with my father
[2:13:49] he said he wants us to share even his
[2:13:51] throne on the same basis that he
[2:13:54] overcame and is set down in his father's
[2:13:56] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[2:13:59] with him then we have to overcome are
[2:14:02] you listening
[2:14:03] then we have to overcome
[2:14:08] then we have to overcome
[2:14:16] i am an overcomer
[2:14:19] why because i'm a part of i am he told
[2:14:21] us that this morning he could have
[2:14:23] preached an hour on that
[2:14:25] because i'm a part of i am
[2:14:28] because i am told me
[2:14:30] who i am
[2:14:32] because i choose to get my identity from
[2:14:34] i am
[2:14:35] that's right
[2:14:37] that's what these young people were
[2:14:38] singing about up here
[2:14:41] i doubt very seriously they've all had a
[2:14:43] glory week
[2:14:44] where nothing ever bothered them and
[2:14:46] nothing ever come against them
[2:14:49] and nothing you know dared come in their
[2:14:52] presence because they're a bunch of
[2:14:53] overcomers
[2:14:55] i've got a feeling that the enemy has
[2:14:57] probably fought them any way that he
[2:14:59] possibly could
[2:15:01] because they were getting up here
[2:15:02] bragging on jesus
[2:15:04] and the devil can't stand for you to
[2:15:06] brag on jesus in fact he'll turn it
[2:15:08] around and say well you're just bragging
[2:15:10] on yourself
[2:15:11] well i'm going to tell you something
[2:15:12] there's not many in this room who who
[2:15:15] are that that sad
[2:15:17] that you think you can do it without him
[2:15:19] i want you to know most of the people in
[2:15:21] this room understand that if we are to
[2:15:23] overcome it is only because the
[2:15:25] overcomer lives inside of us
[2:15:28] hallelujah then we have to overcome to
[2:15:31] sit with him are you there
[2:15:33] and the little oh it's going to get
[2:15:35] quiet watch watch watch watch watch
[2:15:40] i i mean how could it get more quiet
[2:15:43] and the little
[2:15:44] temporary suffering we go through
[2:15:51] come on
[2:15:54] let's get the little cup out
[2:15:59] so that we can drag the prison bars
[2:16:06] i was preaching from the bible now i'm
[2:16:08] preaching from lady and the
[2:16:12] let's get the cup out and let's drag the
[2:16:14] bars and let's sing like the hound dog
[2:16:17] nobody knows
[2:16:21] the trouble i've seen
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:24] it's true
[2:16:28] but don't stop there
[2:16:33] most people who like to live like that
[2:16:36] what they really mean is nobody
[2:16:38] understands nobody cares nobody suffers
[2:16:41] like me nobody's had the hard time i've
[2:16:44] had if anybody else had had hardship
[2:16:48] like i have it maybe give up a long time
[2:16:50] ago
[2:16:53] come on now
[2:16:54] but the song don't stop but nobody knows
[2:16:56] the trouble i've seen
[2:16:58] it goes on to say nobody knows
[2:17:02] but jesus
[2:17:06] who else do you need to know
[2:17:09] who else do you need on your boat
[2:17:12] who else do you need guiding your life
[2:17:15] and sustaining you with strength and
[2:17:18] power let me tell you something you
[2:17:20] can't tell jesus something that he
[2:17:22] doesn't already know
[2:17:24] about your suffering and your hardship
[2:17:27] and it's true it's true we don't all
[2:17:30] suffer the same way
[2:17:33] it's true we don't all go through the
[2:17:36] same things
[2:17:39] but we all must suffer and we all must
[2:17:43] be tested
[2:17:44] and here's the problem when you look at
[2:17:47] mine you think i could sail through that
[2:17:52] when i look at yours i might be tempted
[2:17:55] to think hmm
[2:17:56] i wish that was all i had to deal with
[2:17:59] come on help me
[2:18:00] but the truth is they're tailor-made
[2:18:06] by a sovereign god
[2:18:07] who knows exactly what it's going to
[2:18:09] take to get me in his image
[2:18:12] can't god can't get upset with nobody
[2:18:15] else
[2:18:16] and you better not get bitter toward him
[2:18:20] you better say lord you give and you
[2:18:23] take away
[2:18:24] blessed be your name
[2:18:28] she ain't what i thought she was
[2:18:36] he ain't what i expected
[2:18:41] whoa
[2:18:42] i feel like preaching now
[2:18:48] but you knew what i needed
[2:18:52] hallelujah
[2:18:54] you can look at your wife an entirely
[2:18:56] different way you can look at your
[2:18:58] husband in an entirely different way
[2:19:01] you didn't need a bed of ease
[2:19:03] you needed a her
[2:19:07] you needed a hymn
[2:19:09] oh i wish my children were more like so
[2:19:11] until you
[2:19:12] oh honey
[2:19:14] where are you getting that instagram
[2:19:19] unless you've lived with them you don't
[2:19:20] know what they go through
[2:19:23] you don't know what they go through
[2:19:29] he picks them out for us
[2:19:32] he knows what we need to be challenged
[2:19:35] into his image he knows what we need to
[2:19:37] be perfected in his likeness he knows
[2:19:40] what we need to come forth in his
[2:19:42] character i'm almost done if you'll get
[2:19:44] with me i will be
[2:19:47] i'm so glad that he's in charge
[2:19:50] and the little temporary suffering we go
[2:19:52] through now listen folks i'm telling you
[2:19:54] right now if you will take that attitude
[2:19:57] i challenge you in the name of jesus
[2:19:59] take that attitude
[2:20:00] if you will take that attitude and take
[2:20:02] it again and take it again and take it
[2:20:05] again and take it again your suffering
[2:20:07] will accomplish what it was sent to do
[2:20:09] you can graduate and go into something
[2:20:11] else
[2:20:12] your trial that has been sent to perfect
[2:20:15] you you can pass that you graduate from
[2:20:18] that you can go on to your next lesson
[2:20:20] if you try to maintain the attitude that
[2:20:23] says the little temporary suffering that
[2:20:26] i'm going through right now it's not
[2:20:28] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[2:20:30] glory that will be revealed in us when
[2:20:33] he comes you ask me preacher how is that
[2:20:37] possible you choose what you look at
[2:20:41] and if you choose to look at your
[2:20:43] suffering you'll see the seriousness of
[2:20:45] your suffering if you choose to look at
[2:20:48] the glory that's going to be revealed
[2:20:53] yes
[2:20:54] it'll be like assistance
[2:20:57] to get you to the next place
[2:21:00] you're not the exception to the rule
[2:21:03] we are the bride we're the body of
[2:21:05] christ we're making our way to the
[2:21:08] kingdom
[2:21:09] he said
[2:21:10] in this little temporary suffering we go
[2:21:12] through now is not worthy to be compared
[2:21:14] to the tremendous glory that will be
[2:21:16] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[2:21:19] treasures
[2:21:22] are laid up
[2:21:24] for those who are willing to enter into
[2:21:27] his kingdom through
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:30] are you willing
[2:21:36] are you willing
[2:21:41] now this is the last
[2:21:43] quotation
[2:21:46] it's also from the church age book
[2:21:49] if you're skimming through the book
[2:21:52] you'll find there are sectional headings
[2:21:54] there
[2:21:55] and this one is under the heading the
[2:21:57] overcomer's throne
[2:21:59] i want you to listen carefully to it
[2:22:00] because it's a powerful piece of writing
[2:22:03] it's inspirational and it's very very
[2:22:05] helpful
[2:22:06] and it comes from the laodicean church
[2:22:08] age section of the book the last
[2:22:10] the last church age
[2:22:12] it starts off with revelation 3 21 to
[2:22:16] him that overcometh while i grant to sit
[2:22:18] with me and my throne even as i also
[2:22:20] overcame and have sat down with my
[2:22:22] father in his throne you should be able
[2:22:24] to find that because i actually put the
[2:22:26] heading there for you that's right thank
[2:22:28] you
[2:22:29] i put the heading there the overcomers
[2:22:31] throne because i love the way it sounds
[2:22:33] say that with the overcomer's throne
[2:22:37] i like it
[2:22:39] didn't say the overcomers tomb
[2:22:44] didn't say the overcomers ultimate
[2:22:46] defeat
[2:22:47] it said the overcomer's throne god's got
[2:22:50] a way to get you there
[2:22:52] you believe that
[2:22:54] musicians would you slip this way
[2:22:57] but leave your
[2:22:58] hearing ears on would you please
[2:23:00] as you come
[2:23:02] now what are we
[2:23:05] to overcome is that a good question
[2:23:08] what are we
[2:23:10] to overcome
[2:23:12] he said that is the normal question to
[2:23:14] ask here
[2:23:16] but that is not the actual thought
[2:23:19] of this verse
[2:23:21] for it is not so much what
[2:23:24] we are to overcome
[2:23:27] but how
[2:23:30] you see our overcoming will be based on
[2:23:33] our trial
[2:23:34] and since all of our trials are not the
[2:23:36] same we can't boil it down to say what
[2:23:38] we all will overcome but we can look at
[2:23:41] how we are to overcome powerful powerful
[2:23:44] he said a quick look at those scriptures
[2:23:48] which involve the lord jesus
[2:23:52] overcoming
[2:23:57] will bring out the truth of this
[2:24:00] proposition i don't know what that is
[2:24:02] exactly
[2:24:04] in matthew 4
[2:24:06] wherein jesus is tempted of the devil
[2:24:10] he overcame listen
[2:24:14] he overcame the personal temptations of
[2:24:18] satan
[2:24:25] how
[2:24:26] how by the word
[2:24:30] and
[2:24:33] and the word only
[2:24:36] how are you going to overcome by the
[2:24:38] word
[2:24:40] and by the word only
[2:24:42] can you remember that when you're in the
[2:24:44] heat of the battle when you're in the
[2:24:45] thick of the fight can you remember that
[2:24:47] can somebody help me remember can i help
[2:24:50] you remember can we help each other
[2:24:53] remember
[2:24:55] that even our lord was tempted this way
[2:24:59] and he overcame
[2:25:01] every temptation every personal
[2:25:04] temptation of satan by the word and by
[2:25:07] the word only that's that's powerful for
[2:25:09] me
[2:25:10] in each of the three major trials
[2:25:14] that correspond exactly
[2:25:17] to the temptation of the garden of eden
[2:25:20] the lust of the flesh
[2:25:23] the lust of the eye
[2:25:25] and the pride of life
[2:25:28] jesus
[2:25:29] overcame
[2:25:35] by the word
[2:25:40] powerful
[2:25:42] he fell
[2:25:43] to the personal temptation of satan
[2:25:50] by read it out for me i know you're
[2:25:53] tired
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:25:57] by failing to use the word
[2:26:03] she had the word
[2:26:07] she was a product
[2:26:09] of the spoken word
[2:26:11] she had the word
[2:26:13] [Music]
[2:26:17] but something brighter
[2:26:22] caught her eye
[2:26:25] and what we find out is it was actually
[2:26:28] the promise
[2:26:29] of what was already promised
[2:26:33] she could have every bit of that by
[2:26:35] staying with the word
[2:26:37] but satan twisted that truth
[2:26:41] threaded through the serpent
[2:26:43] some discrepancy of the truth
[2:26:46] and it glittered
[2:26:50] it shined it shimmered
[2:26:52] it caught her eye
[2:26:54] she gave up everything she had
[2:26:57] to overcome by she gave that up
[2:27:00] so that she could take a hold of a false
[2:27:03] promise
[2:27:05] that would lead her away
[2:27:07] from the very thing that she was created
[2:27:09] to possess
[2:27:12] a piece of the tree of life
[2:27:16] it's really
[2:27:18] rather simple
[2:27:20] she fell to the personal temptation of
[2:27:23] satan by failing to use the word adam
[2:27:27] fell in direct disobedience
[2:27:30] to the word do you know what it means to
[2:27:34] directly disobey it means to disobey
[2:27:37] intentionally
[2:27:40] to know exactly what you are doing you
[2:27:44] are not seduced you are not deceived you
[2:27:48] know exactly what you're doing
[2:27:52] she fell to the personal temptation of
[2:27:55] satan by failing to use the word he fell
[2:27:58] in direct disobedience to the word
[2:28:01] because he had to be her covering
[2:28:04] the new testament tells us that he was
[2:28:06] not deceived
[2:28:08] but jesus overcame how
[2:28:12] by the word are you still here
[2:28:24] i'll give that to you tuesday night i
[2:28:26] guess because i had a had a verse
[2:28:28] that goes right along with that but
[2:28:30] let's go on
[2:28:32] and right now let me say that this is
[2:28:35] the only way
[2:28:38] let me say this is the only way
[2:28:41] let me say this is the only way to be an
[2:28:45] overcomer also it is the only way that
[2:28:49] you can know if you are overcoming
[2:28:57] because that word can't fail
[2:29:00] i love this
[2:29:01] i know this is dull for some folks but i
[2:29:04] love this and i'm going to tell you why
[2:29:05] because you can't trust your feelings to
[2:29:07] tell you that you're overcoming
[2:29:11] you can't trust your feelings to tell
[2:29:13] you you're overcoming when you're up
[2:29:15] singing with the group i'm an overcomer
[2:29:19] you probably feel like an overcomer
[2:29:23] good you should
[2:29:25] but when you go out there in that world
[2:29:28] and you're fighting hell and the devil
[2:29:30] breathing his hot breath on your neck
[2:29:34] you may not feel like an overcomer
[2:29:38] so you better not pull the feeling up
[2:29:40] you can't say now devil i felt god this
[2:29:43] morning
[2:29:44] hear me
[2:29:46] i really felt the anointing on that song
[2:29:49] and i really felt like an overcomer
[2:29:52] the enemy's going to say how do you feel
[2:29:54] now
[2:29:56] and you're going to say well now that
[2:29:57] you mentioned it i i'm not feeling too
[2:29:59] good right now your hot breath is going
[2:30:02] down my neck and i i'm toe to toe with
[2:30:04] my enemy and i i'm not feeling much like
[2:30:06] an overcomer let me tell you something
[2:30:08] it's not by feeling we're gonna make
[2:30:10] make this thing it's not by motion
[2:30:14] hallelujah
[2:30:16] whoa i just want to see somebody sister
[2:30:18] ronda i just want to meet somebody who
[2:30:21] is in the thick of it
[2:30:25] i mean it feels like looks like smells
[2:30:29] like
[2:30:30] they're going down for the last time
[2:30:32] but they've got the loudest praise
[2:30:36] i just want to meet a paul and silas
[2:30:40] i just want to meet somebody who is
[2:30:43] really going through it but you'd never
[2:30:46] be able to know it by their praise
[2:30:52] you'd never know it by their tude
[2:30:58] they keep the right attitude
[2:31:01] they walk in the right spirit
[2:31:03] they overcome by their praise
[2:31:07] listen if paul and silas did it i can
[2:31:12] if those men and women the scriptures
[2:31:14] written about if they were able to go
[2:31:16] through what they went through and keep
[2:31:18] their praise on
[2:31:21] keep their victory keep victory in their
[2:31:23] step somebody said i just feel like a
[2:31:25] hypocrite when i do that you ought to
[2:31:27] feel like a child of god
[2:31:30] there's nothing about a hypocrite we're
[2:31:32] not talking about putting on we're
[2:31:34] talking about getting touch with the god
[2:31:37] who's more than enough
[2:31:40] when you praise him you're not saying i
[2:31:42] got it i got it i got everything i'm i'm
[2:31:44] the one i'm it's about me when you
[2:31:47] praise him you're saying and none of
[2:31:48] it's about me it's all about him it's
[2:31:50] all about him it's all about him
[2:31:56] amen we've got to go home
[2:31:58] right now let me say that this is the
[2:31:59] only way to be an overcomer also it's
[2:32:02] the only way that you can know if you're
[2:32:03] overcoming because that word can't fail
[2:32:06] because that word can't fail because
[2:32:09] that word can't fail hallelujah that
[2:32:12] word can't fail
[2:32:14] he said now notice again how jesus
[2:32:16] overcame the world systems of religion
[2:32:19] when he was repeatedly badgered by the
[2:32:21] theologians of his day he constantly
[2:32:24] applied the word
[2:32:26] i when i wrote a subtitle for this
[2:32:29] section i in my notes i wrote that
[2:32:32] phrase he constantly applied the word he
[2:32:37] constantly applied the word that is not
[2:32:41] a passive action
[2:32:44] that is not something you do passively
[2:32:47] that is something that you do actively
[2:32:49] it's an act of your will to apply the
[2:32:52] word it's an act of your will it's an
[2:32:55] act of your faith to apply the word he
[2:32:59] constantly applied the word ben did you
[2:33:01] know jesus constantly applied the word
[2:33:05] no matter what he was going through he
[2:33:08] constantly applied the word
[2:33:12] he spake only what the father gave him
[2:33:14] to speak
[2:33:16] we're nearly done
[2:33:18] hallelujah
[2:33:21] there was not a time when the world was
[2:33:23] not utterly confused by his wisdom
[2:33:27] for it was the wisdom of god
[2:33:30] in his own personal life contending with
[2:33:33] himself oh oh my oh my
[2:33:37] now now that really dismisses
[2:33:41] the argument of a lot of people
[2:33:45] no wonder he overcame
[2:33:47] he was jesus
[2:33:50] well i know why he overcame i know why
[2:33:52] it was so easy for him to apply the word
[2:33:54] he was the word
[2:33:56] as though he got some automatic pass
[2:33:59] because of the duality of his nature
[2:34:02] well i want you to know if that's the
[2:34:03] case we don't have a high priest
[2:34:06] who can be touched with the feeling of
[2:34:07] our infirmities the reason why we know
[2:34:09] that we have a high priest touched with
[2:34:11] the feeling of our infirmities is
[2:34:13] because god condescended
[2:34:15] into the body and personal life of a man
[2:34:17] and who who experienced everything you
[2:34:20] and i experience
[2:34:21] come on now
[2:34:22] so his ability to overcome was not based
[2:34:25] on the fact that he came from god
[2:34:26] because you came from god too
[2:34:29] hello
[2:34:31] his ability to overcome in all things
[2:34:34] was directly attached to the fact that
[2:34:38] he constantly constantly constantly
[2:34:42] consistently
[2:34:44] perseverantly
[2:34:47] or with perseverance
[2:34:50] applied the word
[2:34:51] he applied the word he applied the word
[2:34:53] in his own personal life contending with
[2:34:55] himself how is that possible because his
[2:34:58] flesh
[2:34:59] pulled in one direction
[2:35:01] and his spirit life pulled in another
[2:35:04] direction
[2:35:05] no wonder he said oh
[2:35:08] the flesh is weak
[2:35:11] my spirit is willing
[2:35:13] but my flesh is weak
[2:35:15] i know what is ahead of me but but oh if
[2:35:18] it be possible let this cup pass from me
[2:35:21] he was contending with himself there's
[2:35:23] never been a greater example of how god
[2:35:26] and man
[2:35:29] were in direct conflict with one another
[2:35:32] while living in the same body
[2:35:35] we can understand what paul was going
[2:35:37] through because we understand what jesus
[2:35:39] was going through
[2:35:41] we can understand what each other is
[2:35:43] facing because we understand what jesus
[2:35:45] was going through
[2:35:47] i'm hurrying it just don't look like it
[2:35:49] and his own that's what happened you
[2:35:51] locked me up for a
[2:35:52] week in his own personal life contending
[2:35:56] with himself he overcame by obedience
[2:36:01] you just take the word
[2:36:04] you just take the word
[2:36:05] you just do what the word says do
[2:36:08] you apply the word
[2:36:10] and you obey the word you speak the word
[2:36:13] you apply the word you obey the word you
[2:36:16] speak the word you apply the word you
[2:36:19] obey the word come on now he overcame
[2:36:21] because he constantly applied
[2:36:24] the word don't you think we already know
[2:36:26] this sure i know you know it
[2:36:29] but the knowing and the practicing it is
[2:36:32] where we struggle we w.e me and you this
[2:36:36] is where we struggle
[2:36:43] i did not fall
[2:36:47] he overcame by obedience to the word of
[2:36:49] god one more paragraph in this i knew
[2:36:51] this would be long
[2:36:54] he said now then
[2:36:56] oh sorry so so sorry
[2:36:59] in his own personal life contending with
[2:37:01] himself he overcame by the by by
[2:37:04] obedience to the word of god it's
[2:37:05] actually two paragraphs i was in the
[2:37:07] wrong place
[2:37:08] in hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days
[2:37:11] of his flesh when he had offered up
[2:37:13] prayers and supplications with strong
[2:37:15] crying and tears unto him that was able
[2:37:17] to save him from death and was heard
[2:37:21] and was heard
[2:37:23] not because he was god
[2:37:26] but because he feared god
[2:37:31] jesus had his prayers heard
[2:37:34] not because he was god but because he
[2:37:37] feared god
[2:37:41] the first few times brother isaiah
[2:37:44] brooks said i worship the word i felt it
[2:37:46] in here
[2:37:49] i felt some of us
[2:37:55] what do you worship
[2:38:00] do you worship
[2:38:02] i love it
[2:38:03] i think it's a powerful statement i
[2:38:05] think it's full of revelation
[2:38:08] i worship the word don't you get your
[2:38:10] bible in your mind
[2:38:17] the word
[2:38:19] in the beginning
[2:38:21] was the word
[2:38:22] and the word was with god and the word
[2:38:24] was god i worship the words powerful
[2:38:27] powerful
[2:38:28] powerful we apply the word we speak the
[2:38:30] word we believe the word we obey the
[2:38:32] word
[2:38:33] we surrender to the word
[2:38:36] and in the fact that he feared
[2:38:38] it's why his prayer was heard
[2:38:45] would you move on
[2:38:47] though he were a son yet learned the
[2:38:50] obedience by the things which he
[2:38:52] suffered and being made perfect he
[2:38:54] became the author of eternal salvation
[2:38:57] unto all them that obey him oh my
[2:38:59] goodness
[2:39:02] what was he obedient to would you read
[2:39:05] the next four words
[2:39:07] the word of god
[2:39:09] and this is the last paragraph
[2:39:11] now then there will not be one person
[2:39:13] who will sit on the throne
[2:39:16] of the lord jesus christ unless he has
[2:39:18] been living
[2:39:19] that
[2:39:20] word
[2:39:23] this is where rubber meets the road
[2:39:27] this is where your talkie talkie
[2:39:30] and your walkie walkie
[2:39:32] have to line up
[2:39:35] this is the most difficult part of
[2:39:38] worshiping the word
[2:39:42] when it comes down
[2:39:44] to having a choice whether to obey the
[2:39:46] truth
[2:39:47] or not
[2:39:49] we must choose every time every single
[2:39:53] time to obey the word
[2:39:55] come on
[2:39:57] any time we're put in a position where
[2:40:00] we obey man or the word
[2:40:04] we must always are you with me
[2:40:06] we must always obey
[2:40:09] the word
[2:40:12] there will not be one person who will
[2:40:13] sit in the throne of the lord jesus
[2:40:15] christ unless he has been living that
[2:40:17] word your prayers your fastings your
[2:40:20] repentances no matter what you present
[2:40:23] to god none of that will gain you the
[2:40:27] privilege of sitting in
[2:40:30] that throne
[2:40:33] so now
[2:40:35] what does that do
[2:40:38] for man's common response
[2:40:43] i've got to pray more got to read more
[2:40:45] got to fast more
[2:40:47] all those things are true
[2:40:50] we should pray more
[2:40:53] it's the one thing we can never do too
[2:40:55] much of he said pray we should pray more
[2:40:58] read we should read more
[2:41:01] not true
[2:41:02] life romance or
[2:41:05] word read the word yes we should read
[2:41:07] more fast yes we should fast more but
[2:41:10] even if you pray more read more and fast
[2:41:13] more that's not enough
[2:41:18] what you've really got to do is believe
[2:41:20] more
[2:41:21] somebody said how could you put it in
[2:41:23] the believing because you'll never obey
[2:41:25] it unless you believe it
[2:41:27] when you believe it you are duty
[2:41:28] duty-bound there's something in your
[2:41:30] heart that wants to surrender to what
[2:41:32] you know is soul
[2:41:34] when you see by grace of by eyes of
[2:41:36] faith and grace what what living this
[2:41:39] word can accomplish in your life you're
[2:41:41] going to want to get it right
[2:41:44] none of these things will grant you the
[2:41:46] privilege of sitting on the throne let's
[2:41:47] finish
[2:41:49] it will be granted only to the word
[2:41:53] bride
[2:41:55] the word the word the word the word is
[2:41:56] all you talk about the word the word the
[2:41:58] word the word the word the word it's the
[2:42:00] word bride
[2:42:02] as the throne of the king is shared with
[2:42:04] the queen because she is united to him
[2:42:08] so only they who are of that word even
[2:42:11] as he is of that word will share that
[2:42:15] throne do you see anything wrong with
[2:42:17] that statement
[2:42:18] nor do i
[2:42:20] thank you sister bonnie i think it's
[2:42:21] good too
[2:42:22] i'm going to read it again then
[2:42:24] it will be granted only to the word
[2:42:26] bride as the throne of the king is
[2:42:28] shared with the queen because she is
[2:42:29] united to him so only they who are of
[2:42:32] that word even as he is of that word
[2:42:35] will share that throne
[2:42:38] now just one question before we stand
[2:42:41] how does one become
[2:42:44] a part of that word
[2:42:52] by joining the church
[2:42:55] within which church would you join
[2:42:59] and what would you do in a church like
[2:43:00] this
[2:43:01] who has no membership
[2:43:03] if you had to join the church
[2:43:05] to be a part of that word you couldn't
[2:43:08] even do it here
[2:43:12] well
[2:43:13] be baptized it's essential
[2:43:17] obedience to christ and water baptism is
[2:43:20] essential it's vitally important in your
[2:43:23] experience with the lord
[2:43:25] but that's not how you become a part of
[2:43:27] that word
[2:43:31] repent and be baptized no
[2:43:34] come down here to the altar and accept
[2:43:36] the lord as your savior and then you can
[2:43:38] believe well listen folks that's how you
[2:43:40] recognize who you are
[2:43:42] it's when you begin to surrender your
[2:43:44] life but the truth is
[2:43:46] if you are ever going to be a part of
[2:43:49] that word
[2:43:55] you always were
[2:44:03] you can't change
[2:44:05] your eternal destination
[2:44:08] by saying a little prayer
[2:44:12] now if you think i'm off the scripture
[2:44:14] you better you better open up your bible
[2:44:16] and i just suggest you go to the book of
[2:44:18] hebrews
[2:44:20] and read it until you believe it
[2:44:23] and when you're done that's right go
[2:44:24] right over there to ephesians and read
[2:44:26] all of that too
[2:44:27] and if you can see yourself in any of
[2:44:29] that you ought to be okay
[2:44:33] because we have to obey that's what you
[2:44:35] can do you can do what your part by
[2:44:38] saying yes
[2:44:40] the bible said repent and be baptized
[2:44:42] that's what you do
[2:44:45] the bible tells us to to prefer christ
[2:44:49] to to live in obedience all of these
[2:44:52] things are things that we can do
[2:44:56] because we are a part of that word
[2:45:01] but the bible says
[2:45:04] that we were elected
[2:45:09] chosen
[2:45:11] in
[2:45:12] christ before the foundation of the
[2:45:16] world
[2:45:18] by the time you got here
[2:45:20] he already knew
[2:45:24] everything there was to know about you
[2:45:28] [Music]
[2:45:29] you can't get good enough to become a
[2:45:32] part of that word the only way that you
[2:45:35] can realize you're a part of that word
[2:45:38] is to receive
[2:45:39] the truth that god brings to you
[2:45:44] you can't take somebody else's truth you
[2:45:47] can't even survive on the truth of
[2:45:49] another age
[2:45:51] but when god allows you to recognize the
[2:45:56] day that you are living in and the word
[2:46:00] that has been sent to that day
[2:46:04] that is the grace of god
[2:46:08] by his election by his foreknowledge
[2:46:12] he has predestinated us are you saying
[2:46:15] brother that i don't have a choice no
[2:46:22] what i'm saying is
[2:46:24] he knew your choice
[2:46:26] and chose you
[2:46:28] before you could even choose
[2:46:31] him
[2:46:34] you chose him
[2:46:36] because he chose you oh do you believe
[2:46:38] that's not the word i believe the bible
[2:46:40] said i have cho you have not chosen me
[2:46:45] but i have chosen you
[2:46:48] why would he do such a thing it's
[2:46:50] because he knew the only way
[2:46:53] that you would be able to overcome in
[2:46:54] this wicked laodicean church age was to
[2:46:58] know by grace that you are a part of
[2:47:00] that word and that word is constantly
[2:47:03] working in you as you surrender to it to
[2:47:06] make you come forth in the overcomers
[2:47:09] anointing you are anointed to overcome
[2:47:12] anything and everything the enemy would
[2:47:15] launch against you in this hour but it
[2:47:18] is not by your success
[2:47:21] your success is by depending
[2:47:25] on his success
[2:47:27] let's stand
[2:47:29] he said little children i ride unto you
[2:47:35] that you overcome
[2:47:39] it's a message of instruction even as i
[2:47:42] have overcome
[2:47:43] [Music]
[2:47:47] how did he overcome
[2:47:50] by constantly applying the word
[2:47:53] how did brother branham overcome
[2:47:55] by constantly applying the word
[2:47:58] how are you and i going to overcome
[2:48:01] by constantly applying the word
[2:48:04] i apologize for your weakened condition
[2:48:06] this morning i somehow have warned you
[2:48:08] out i assume that because we had not had
[2:48:11] a service this week you'd come into the
[2:48:13] house of the lord refreshed but i will
[2:48:15] carry that it's on me but i had to
[2:48:17] deliver what i feel like the lord had
[2:48:20] laid on my heart
[2:48:21] we must
[2:48:23] we must
[2:48:24] we must overcome we must receive that
[2:48:28] anointing to overcome i want us to sing
[2:48:31] we've been made more than conquerors i
[2:48:33] want us to sing it like people who
[2:48:35] recognize that even without fighting
[2:48:38] you've won the prize

[2:48:44] yielding to him you've already won
