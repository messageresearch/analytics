TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry welcome to the broadcast today we're in the middle of a series on the spirit and power of Elijah past present and future we are examining together the life of Elijah the Prophet right out of the book of Kings from the Old Testament of the scripture and we are examining his strengths and even at times his weaknesses because the Bible tells us in Malachi that the spirit of Elijah is such a unique anointing that it will return to the earth more than one time and just when the earth is positioned to be smitten with a curse Malachi said the spirit of Elijah will return again and we have seen that throughout the scriptural history and we want to look at that a few more programs we're there's just this is such a big subject that we're covering a lot of ground but it's taking us some time to get there so I hope you'll bear with us stick around let me remind you before we look to the scripture today that we are happy to pray with you about your prayer request it's an honor to do so just contact us the contact information will be given to you there on your screen and we'll help you pray and I'd also like for you to stand with this great Christian television network stand with them in your prayer support and if God makes a way of provision for you and you'd like to sew sew into the ministries that bring you fine Christian Broadcasting I thank God for every network that airs this little program the Eagles cry and I pray often that God will bless them and prosper them so whatever you can do to be a blessing so that this continues to go forward while I know that God will richly bless you for your dedicated prayer and for any sewing that you might be able do financially to help them continue in the great work of God right here in the end time we want to look at the scripture today as I described earlier to find out more about the characteristics of Elijah the Prophet he was number one a man of the wilderness number two he was a man who was not afraid to confront false religion and he was also courageous in in his challenge to call people back to from the norm of the day a lukewarm faith to a fiery faith God used him to turn hearts back back to the beginning back to the original back to the foundation and he was also a man who demonstrated the raw power of God he had the grace of God to be able to speak to the heavens and they would give their water in rain or shut him up with the authority of his words so that it rain not he was a prophet of fire as we talked about when he met that great challenge on them on Mount Carmel showed that the Living God the God of the Bible is victorious and he really exposed the fallacy of Al a false god a figment of men's imaginations but today I want us to talk about the fact that Elijah also experienced some emotional lows in his life we read on the last broadcast from the book of James you might remember that chapter 5 we read 17 and 18 I want to reread James 517 in the Amplified Bible it said Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have with feelings affections and a constitution that means a will like ours and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain and no rain fell on the earth for three years in six months I reread that verse because I want you to know that though he was a mighty powerful prophet of God who demonstrated the raw power of God he was still a man with feelings with emotions with highs and with lows like every other man on the earth every other woman on the earth too and so I want you to note that I want you to note that he experienced tremendous emotional highs but would often very quickly find himself in the lowest place of discouragement I noticed in the scripture in first Kings chapter 19 beginning in verse 4 here's one of those low moments and I'd like to point out in chronology that this was immediately after the great showdown on Mount Carmel he had just saw perhaps the greatest demonstration of supernatural power the fire of God that he'd ever seen in his life and from that great event verse 4 tells us he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die imagine that the greatest campaign of his ministry the greatest crusade revival evangelistic outreach that he had ever known in his ministry and one day later he sits under a tree in the wilderness and says oh let me die as though he had no reason to live he said it is enough now o Lord take away my life for I am no better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto Him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again and the angel of the Lord came again the second time touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee and he arose and did eat and drink listen at the supernatural element the supernatural manifestation of that food prepared by the angel he went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the Mount of God now he went from a extreme emotional high look what the lord is done to an extreme emotional though I might as well die all my father's have died God met him even in that place of emotional Oh God met him by the angel gave him food to eat another good nap and fed him again and the strength of that meat lasted 40 days and 40 nights so that he could get to his next great assignment I'm pointing that out because I want you to know that if this generation should experience a company of men and women anointed by the spirit and power of Elijah they won't be superhuman no there they will be regular ordinary human beings same constitution of someone else same emotion same will same struggle same battle and yet chosen for a high purpose for a high calling I say that because I think it's important for us to know that even though God used Elijah in such an outstanding way he was still a human being he still struggled and maybe maybe friend a little bit more than the ordinary person I know in my own small ministry that there have been times in my life when God really used me in what I thought was a profound in supernatural way and I just felt that that euphoria of being used of God there's not a greater feeling in all the world you'd leave the pulpit you'd be almost on a high for what God had done and grateful and humble that he would let you be a small part of that I've gone back to the hotel I've gone back to my home or to the home where I was staying and fought the enemy all night long solo so discouraged listening to lies that the enemy would put in my mind all night long I understand what it means to come under that kind of an attack when the anointing is on us why we feel like we could kill a bear wrestle with a giant or defeat an army you know but sometimes when that anointing lifts off of us it doesn't just leave us like it was when it came it seems that it even pushes our emotions down a little bit more why are you saying that because i want to encourage some of you who are watching this program around the world who fight with your emotional highs and lows this is something that we need to guard ourselves concerning we need to take a little warning in this it may happen that we who come under the inspiration and the anointing of the spirit and power of Elijah to help bring in the final harvest it may be that we have to guard more than ordinary folk around us that we when those moments of aloneness come when we feel so lonely in the battle here's another example 1st Kings same chapter chapter 19 at beginning in verse 14 and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down nine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away how depressed he got look how discouraged he got and how he had this tendency to feel like he was the only one now I know you you and I've probably never felt that way have we ha yes we have they're probably been times that we felt all alone in this battle I mean good friend surrounding us and still feeling so lonely and so misunderstood and here was the mighty prophet Elijah feeling the exact same way well that doesn't make me feel like I have an excuse to be down in the dumps but it helps me to understand that if it happened to a great man of God like that well I'm no better than that so I might have to to face some of the same things and as we have said if God raises up a company of men and women who function in the spirit and power of Elijah they're going to be ordinary folk they're going to fight emotionally some time to stay on top and we must not give up in those moments where we feel like we're the only one we must not judge you know the intentions of other men's hearts because truly we're not the only one and God made it clear see he made it clear to Elijah here let's go down just a moment verse 15 and the Lord said unto Him gold return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint has Al to be king over Syria and Jehu the son of NIMH she shalt thou anointed king over Israel and Elijah the son of chef at of a boat mahalo shall anoint to be a prophet in thy room and it shall come to pass that him that escaped at the sword of hazael shall you who slay and him that escaped it from the sort of Jay who shall Elijah slay but look at verse 18 yet I have left me seven thousand Elijah you you thought you were the only one I even I alone him left he said God had to remind his profit yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel all the knees which have not bowed under bail and every mouth which have not kissed him what an encouragement it must have been I'm not sure that Elijah was prepared to hear that at the moment but eventually it must have encouraged him to know here I feel like I'm the only person holding on to the faith and yet there are seven thousand others praise God who are holding on that's like reinforcement and so it appears that when this kind of her all power gets demonstrated in someone's life that it works on them it works on their emotion and so we must guard against this tendency God wants to fill us with incredible joy you know joy is the remedy for depression joy is the remedy for a lot of stuff and yet we sometimes get joy and happiness a little bit confused happiness is an emotion that is based on your circumstances you know you're having a birthday everyone's there to celebrate it's a happy time but if you're in the midst of a deep dark trial you don't feel very happy and so happiness goals and comes often times based on what's going on around us our present atmosphere or our present circumstances but not joy joy is a deep abiding place in the Lord that gives us strength remember the scripture the joy of the Lord is our strength it is my strength and so we want to ask the Lord to to give us his joy that will strengthen us in those times when we go from emotional highs being used mightily of God to a moment of almost feeling Forsaken and like we're the only one if we could ask for a a real baptism an outpouring of joy that would help balance our emotions so maybe the highs aren't quite as high and the lows aren't quite as low but we can just remain a little more even I believe that what that does is it cuts out a lot of the opportunity and advantage that Satan has to work on our minds to discourage us to lie to us you know he's the father of all eyes and he delights in lying to the children of God nobody loves you nobody appreciates you he'll say nobody really cares the sacrifice you're making to try to be a blessing in their life if you get caught it listing to the lies of the enemy you'll spend your whole life asleep under the juniper tree you won't even wake up and and accept the provision of the Lord you know there are times that people get so low that even the Lord comes to encourage them and they're close to it I'm glad that Elijah was able to be awakened by the angel eat this good food that God prepared go back to sleep get a little more rest for his physical body this is one of the things that I think affects our emotions is not getting the proper rest that we should get and I see Elijah here getting some rest and then bread is good and it's good nice to have bread nice to have but he needed some flesh he needed some he needed something that would give him some more strength because he was about to have an extension of strength God was about to take that nourishment that he gathered from that from that food that he ate and stretch it for a 40 day period now that is absolutely supernatural we don't ever want to get so low in our emotions we don't ever want to allow ourselves to get so low that we miss the instructions of the Lord and you know that's what Satan wants he wants to press us down that's what depression is it's being pressed down and he wants to dulles and press us down ultimately so that we can miss the father's instructions so that we can miss the gentle leadership of the Holy Spirit and so I'm going to ask the Lord sincerely to help us get ready men and women of the remnant Bride of Christ that God would help us to get ready to let the joy of the Lord sustain us in such a way that we get better control you know I think we can do this with the help of the lord i'm not going to dare think I can do this myself but with the help of the Lord I think I can bring some control to to my emotions I believe I can surrender to joy I believe that I can make a conscious decision when the enemy comes to disturb my peace and he will do it brother every morning he has a new assignment against you and I to disturb our peace because it's when we're at peace that we have rest rest brings confidence and trust but if we get disturbed in our peace and our soul is in turmoil then we have a hard time finding that place of rest in him and that's why so many people spend the biggest portion of their life just kind of spinning their wheels striving struggling to stay on top of the water I think they call it treading water when you're out there you can't touch bottom and you it seems like the shore is too far to swim too so you're just constantly moving quickly your hands and feet just to keep your head above water and boy you'll wear out in a hurry like that and hidden that the plot of Satan to wear out the Saints didn't the bible talk about the fact that he would seek to even change the times and the seasons to wear out the saints of God he has an assignment against the children of the Lord to wear you out physically if possible and to wear you out emotionally and so I just offer this this bit of instruction or advice or suggestion and I just asked that you make a conscious effort to push in the joy to position yourself ass for it I don't know if you've ever asked for joy or not do it ask the Lord Lord released to me ultimately your joy the joy that gives me strength the joy that gives me a song to sing in the midst of my suffering you know it it's a sacrifice to sing when you're in prison when you've been beaten when you're still in the stocks and and change of prison you've got to reach way down inside of you to get a song when you're really in the in the heat of a trial but Paul and Silas did what they did was they reach right down inside their spirit man and they pulled up joy they knew joy they had had joy that experience joy he just got pushed down by all the suffering and persecution that the children of God were going through in that hour but they were able to make the decision instead of moaning and groaning about their suffering are their wounds boy there were many they were in bad shape but in the midst of their bleeding in the midst of their suffering they reach way down into the inner man and pulled up joy out of the wells of salvation therefore with joy shall you draw water from the wells of salvation and that's what Paul and Silas did and you know what it did instead of a moan and a groan it birthed a song in them and they sang praises to God in the midnight hour I don't know if you've ever tried that strategy but I have and I tell you the song that God gives you in the midnight hour in the midst of your stripes in the midst of your suffering that's the sweetest song to the Lord I believe he loves that song it might not sound like anybody else's song but it's a song of praise it's a song of worship that's birthed out of your trial out of your suffering out of your pain you know the enemy wants to lock you in your pain he wants to shut you in so that all you can see is how bad things are but if you can reach right down into the inside of the inside finding that place of hope find that place of joy put your mind back on the Lord look read the Psalms that's what I do some time when I feel overwhelmed i just opened up my Bible and begin to read the Psalms out loud have you ever been in such a place in your spiritual life that you couldn't really pray well isn't that the trick of the enemy because prayer is one of the ways that we bring ourselves in back into fellowship in contact with God so if the enemy can suppress you that you can't find the words to pray or the strength to pray or the faith to pray then really you're just locked in you're really in a prison so what I do some time when I just don't have though I just don't know what to pray I I don't have hardly the strength to pray or maybe my faith is gotten weak then I just read the songs and I say Lord I may not feel like it right now but I believe that I believe this I may not sound like it I may not even be living like but but I believe that you're the God who is underneath the everlasting arms I believe you're the God who whose name is a strong tower and the righteous run into it you may think that this is too basic but I go back to Psalm 23 oftentimes I either quote what I can remember or read it to the Lord Lord you're my shepherd I feel like a dumb sheep right now I really do lord but you are my shepherd and if you're my shepherd you'll lead me and then go through the rest of it but beside the still waters you'll lead me in green pastures you will prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you get down there toward the bottom surely goodness and mercy by the time I get to that I'm already restored really surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you start out in pain and you end up realizing that no matter where you go goodness and mercy is coming behind you God hasn't forgotten you or forsaken you the enemy is just working on your mind and working on your emotions I want you to know that that that from from a scientific point of view your brain doesn't control the mind but your mind has controller influence over the brain and so sometimes we we think of them as the same but the soul is the mind and the will and the emotions the brain is is this computer up here that communicates with the rest of our body and we would think that the brain being the the control tower of the physical body we would think that the brain has the ability to to control or direct the mind but the mind in the realm of a soul actually has the ability to direct the brain what in the world are you saying I'm saying that if our mind is in a dark place if our mind is in a negative place and all we can think about and concentrate on and focus on is negativity it's like acid in our spirits first of all it's like acid in our spiritual life but it actually becomes like acid in the brain and so our physical brain hear me our physical brain can become greatly affected by what's going on in the soul what's going on in the mind in the will and in the emotions so when you realize that you're getting in that kind of a dark place let the Word of God be strength to you let the Psalms be your vocabulary if you can't find your own words use God's Word this is how Jesus met Satan's temptation in the wilderness he said Satan it is written let me pray father thank you for the promise of your word thank you for the truth that sets us free thank you for giving us this precious book as a vocabulary to you in pressings prayer and in worship when we need to press back in find our place of joy and restoration and we don't know what of what to say or what to do next thank you for the word that guides our path I pray right now that you'll help every one of us to guard our emotions so that we can remain in a place where you can instruct us and help us we ask these things in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory alone thank you for taking time to stay with me and watch the Eagles cry if you'll tune in again I'll be back god bless you bye bye for now you
