TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the water that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right at Christ in you the hope of war [Music] we want to welcome you to the program today I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope revival ministries and I'm here representing the gospel channel and brother Eric Erickson we're just so delighted to have you with us this evening and I pray that something will be said that will speak to your heart encourage you to keep on keepin on to serve the Lord Jesus Christ with all of your strength and with all of your might we know by the Word of God that we're living in the end times it's a confusing time for many many people but for the children of God we shouldn't be confused these are the days that we have looked for the scriptures are coming to pass before our very eyes and we want to know that we are living in the center of God's perfect will I don't know about you but I believe with all my heart that this life is not all there is I believe there's an eternity and I believe that one of these days we're going to step across into that land of eternity to live with the Lord for ever and ever some will go by the way of the grave death will claim this body but I believe that there will be those who are alive and remain at the time of the coming of the Lord and the scripture tells us in Thessalonians that will be changed in a moment at the culmination of that great event that the Scriptures have foretold and those which have died in Christ will rise first and we which are alive and remain will be caught up together to meet them in the air I believe that is the resurrection of the bride of Jesus Christ and I'm looking forward to that in fact I'm planning today for that event whenever it may come somebody said well I've heard all my life that the Lord is coming Jesus is coming well I want you to know he is coming it may not be in all of our lifetime but he is coming again and I can say by the scripture and by the news pay for that we are closer to the coming of the Lord today than we certainly were say 5 years ago 10 years ago yes my grandmother and my great-grandmother looked for the coming of the Lord but that doesn't discourage me from continuing to look for his coming I'm thankful for the gospel channel I'm thankful for another way to minister to reach out to find those who are hurting those who are discouraged maybe even those who do not know the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior while while Mercy is still being extended and while we have time why don't you invite him into your life why don't you surrender your will and your way to the ways of God and I tell you it's not an easy life necessarily but it's the most glorious life that any person could live because we all face problems and we face sickness and we face difficulties but it's only those who know the Lord Jesus who really have somebody to help them when they get in those situations I want you to know he's a healer I've seen God heal just about any condition or disease that would come to your mind and he is still a healer he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever so I for one am very grateful to brother Eric Erickson and the gospel channel for the work that they have been doing for the Lord for so very long now and I'm especially thankful that we get to partner with them and speak to you today you know we've just entered into a new year a little while back and I believe that it's going to be a good year because really in a year when we're serving the Lord is a good year they're going to be things that are hard to deal with we're going to meet some obstacles and some hindrances on the way I'm sure of that but I know that as we get closer and closer to the coming of the Lord God's going to do a glow work in his people it's the promise of the scripture I could say that prophets and sages for hundreds of years have been looking for that generation just before the coming of the Lord that would walk in the fullness of who God has called us to be sometimes people refer to it as the sons of God the manifestation of the sons of God because the scripture says that all of creation groaneth for the manifestation of the sons of God and I realized that through the years some of these scriptural thoughts have been taken to the excess you can't take any portion of Scripture and interpret it by itself it has to lay in the continuity of the word remember the Bible said line upon line and precept upon precept its foundation first secure strong stable and then we're building on that foundation I don't believe that Scripture contradicts Scripture I believe that if there's a contradiction it's because we're somehow either misinterpreting the scripture or miss applying it I believe one of the mistakes that people make today in seeking to explain God's Word is by trying to do it with a carnal mind the Bible tells us that the carnal mind is actually enmity with God or an enemy at conflict with God that's why we must be renewed our minds must be renewed daily I say more than daily all through the day sometimes I have to say lord help me right now with my thoughts I want to think the thoughts that are true and lovely and pure that have virtue I want to stop the voice of the enemy when when he comes to say well that's not going to work and that's going to be a flop and that's going to be a failure you see I never had an M Bishan to do television of any sort or any kind but the Lord laid the burden on our heart he prophesied through multiple people that the day would come that we would have this open door and sure enough because God keeps his word the doors begin to open and so we stepped in feeling very inadequate very insufficient looking at some of Christian television today how eloquent and anointed many people are and feeling like well we could never measure up to that but if I would listen to the enemy and believe everything that he says I would be paralyzed by fear I would never do anything for the Lord I would let the fear of failure keep me from even stepping out I want to encourage you in this new year not to let the fear of failure keep you from doing something in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible tells us that everything we do we should do in that lovely precious and set-apart name and that means we're doing it unto the name we're doing it unto the glory of God and so really when we stepped into this role it was up to the Lord whether we stood or whether we fall whether we failed or whether we succeeded his strength is actually made perfect in our weakness when we feel that we do not have the strength to continue to carry on in his name he is as close as the mention of his name I don't know why I feel like saying this right now but I feel like mentioning to you the important aspect of praise when we praise the Lord when we sanctify our thoughts and we place them upon the goodness of God and we begin to speak his praise I tell you I don't know if you what you would think about me if you worked near my desk if you work down the hall for me like my son does there are times that my mind is is you know bogged down with responsibilities and having several things that needed to be done yesterday while trying to figure out what to do today which one of them should be the priority for today while already feeling like I missed the deadline and all of a sudden I just start praising the Lord right out loud father I just thank you that you have got everything under control you're a good good father you never make a mistake I just thank you for for your good care for me thank you for providing for my family thank you for the food that you give me in the clothing that you provide you know I tell you you you just start tracing him and thanking him his presence draws near and the list just gets longer and longer of things that you would like to praise him for it has a profound effect on your mindset your attitude what you do then the rest of the day and how you feel scientists have even proven that thinking thoughts of gratitude can absolutely have a chemical reaction in the body that's healthy it's a rewiring of the brain that we desperately need in an hour where we're bombarded with so many things that tend to bog the thinking process down so we not only get the profound spiritual benefit of connecting with our Creator and giving him some of the praise that's due his name but we also have a wonderful effect that takes place in our physical body and who out there couldn't use some help in their health I believe that God wants to to give us everything that we have need of and we just have to position ourselves according to the Word of God to be able to receive what the Lord has you know when I was seeking the Lord about this new year one of the things that that he spoke into my spirit was that this was a year to take sides with the Word of God we're living in an hour where this generation even universally they they so often desire not to take a side over the other you know they don't want to take one position over another position and we just all need to get along and we just all need to be tolerant and I understand the concept of tolerance I understand the concept of peace and I understand that it's much better for us to get along in love than to constantly war with one another but I also believe that there are certain truths that we cannot compromise on the sovereignty of God the infallibility of the scripture the sanctity of human life marriage as God has defined it in his word standing in alignment with the nation of Israel these are some of the principles that I feel are so very very important I believe understanding the simplicity of the Godhead based on the scripture is important I believe having understanding and having the baptism of the Holy Ghost is very very important in the in the perilous days in which we live I believe that there are giftings of the spirit that were given to the early church but are still in effect today I believe that God still desires to speak to his children I believe in visions I believe in dreams I believe that God is still leading his people in a supernatural way why do you believe that preacher because I read it in God's Word and it's time to take sides with God's Word when the scripture is silent maybe we should just be silent but when the scripture speaks we should not be afraid to say what the book says and not as a hypocrite not as one who has an answer for everything but cannot find the strength to live anything you see if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything if you're gonna make your stand in this new year make your stand for the Word of God take sides with Jesus Christ recognize from the scripture that there are not thousands of ways to God there are not hundreds of ways to God in fact there are not ten ways to God or even two there's only one way to God the true God the God of the Bible the Bible call Jehovah we know that there is no name in scripture big enough to contain the fullness of who he is even our Jewish friends because they want to keep the sanctity of the name of God often refer to him as Hashem the name what words are big enough to describe who he is and how he works how he interacts in the hearts and lives of men and women alive today and how he has moved in the lives of people throughout history he's bigger than the world the world cannot contain him and we need to understand that it's not our choice we try to figure out which of these directions is for us there's only one way Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh to the Father except he come through me and I believe that with every fiber of my being if you believe that say man because it's nothing but the truth it's only by Jesus Yeshua our Messiah that we have access to God and it's only by inviting the Lord Jesus into our life that we can actually enter in to the relationship that we need with God our Creator so you find out what the Word of God says and in this year of your life determined that you're going to stand for the word I'm not encouraging you to be mean or hostile or rude judgmental or critical to someone who doesn't see the Word of God as you do in fact I'm talking about a personal stand I'm talking about making a stand as an individual I am going to take sides with Jesus Christ I'm not going to bite my tongue when I'm asked about who I am and who I am who I serve who I belong to I'm going to speak in love but I'm going to speak I think it's very important because we're certainly nearing the end of time as we have come to know it we have families that need the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ they need they need his help and his strength and I want you to know the only way we're going to bring them to Jesus is to live the Jesus life in front of them many many people around the world have had their belly full of religion but they have never seen enough of what it means when someone has a true relationship with Jesus Christ then it's not about religion it's about relationship it's about knowing God when the Spirit of the Lord began to speak to us about this being a year to take sides with the word he had spoken to us earlier about entering into a season concerning the Word of God that we needed to take God at His Word if he said it that settles it we used to say in the church when I was a boy if God says it I believe it that settles it but the truth is whether you believe it or not whether I believe it or not if God said it it is forever settled it is so then why isn't it important why is it important for me to believe God if God says it why is it important for me to believe it it's important for me to believe it because my faith activates the Word of God in my life it takes a word that was given to a tremendous amount of people a very general Word of God whosoever whosoever would call upon the name of the Lord the Bible tells us that God so loved the world this is such a huge blanket of God's love to all mankind and it takes that huge blanket of God's Word and makes it very very personal when I believe it when I believe it as an individual it activates that word of God in my life that means that I can take God at His Word and every promise in the book God's book God's Word becomes my promise what about that I mean that's pretty exciting that what God has said that he wants to do I now by faith connect with that word and I know by revelation because faith unlocks the Spirit of God to bring revelation into your life from the word and by that revelation I now know that it's my promise it's my inheritance it's for me and I can believe it and I can hold on to it and I can see it become a reality because God said it that settles it let me read a verse of scripture to you today John chapter 8 verses 31 and 32 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if ye continue you in my word then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth of God's Word if you continue in the word you will know the truth and the truth will make you free or make you freedom you become freedom I'll tell you that's a wonderful promise from God's Word it means that nothing of this world can bind me if I continue in God's Word his word therefore continues in me making me freedom hallelujah you see I am freedom not because I've done something good in my own self but because I have believed on the Word of God I have made a conscious decision to continue in the word that word continue in the Greek means to stay in a given place to abide it also means that we should that you would stay in a state or in an expectancy it also means to dwell to remain or to be present so that word continue when the scripture says in the King James Version if you continue in my word it means if we choose to stay in a state of expectancy concerning the Word of God concerning the truth of God's Word again a conscious decision if there's one thing I want to get across to you as we study the Scriptures together from time to time it is that God wants to take this word and make it personal he wants to make it a reality in your life again it's not a dead dry history book or a record of what God was but rather it's a book that becomes a foundation and if we build our lives on that foundation as we learn some time ago it's like the man who built this house on a rock if your life is built on Jesus Christ if your life is founded and built on the Word of God then no matter how the winds howl or the storms blow or the rain comes crashing down that house your house a house for God will stand the Word of God must not be looked at as as something that cannot be made personal we must allow the Holy Spirit of God to take this word and make it personal to us one man of God said it like this we've got to see ourselves in the word and I think one of the examples that people often use they say well put your name in the word if you if you can't just read it and see yourself in it put your name in there and one of the examples they use is for God so loved the world that's broad but what if I should say for God so loved Stephen L Shelley that's me that makes it personal so I'm reading my name in God's Word someone said oh I I don't know if that's theologically sound it's absolutely theologically sound it's the only way to make God's Word personal in your life what's the benefit of making God's Word personal that's continuing in the word to make it personal to let the Spirit of God reveal it to you to study the word to take sides with the word all of these all of these Russians all of these things that we have mentioned concerning the word taking God at His Word all of these things could be defined as continuing in the word and here's the benefit if you continue in my word if you stay in that state of expectancy you're going to know that you're my disciples indeed and you're going to know the truth the truth is not a book the truth is not a church the truth is not a doctrine what is the truth or should I ask who is the truth because the truth is a person his name is the Lord Jesus Christ again he said I am the way the truth the life I want to know the truth and in knowing the truth in being intimately acquainted with the truth then I can be made freedom hallelujah and living in that state of freedom there is no bondage there is no addiction there is no oppression that can attach itself to my life if it comes as an attack the living word of God in me that has made me freedom will quickly identify the bullets the arrows that the enemy is using against me and we pull those down in the authority of Jesus Christ and we continue abiding in the word or in the vine who is the vine well Jesus said in John 15 he is the vine and we are the branches how many of you are happy about being grafted your you're a part of that vine let's say connected I'm so thankful to be connected in fact the branches of a vine have the same SAP running through them that the that the vine itself has that means that the same life that is in the vine Jesus Christ is the same life that is in me now in this born-again experience the life the same life oh my that is so very powerful because that means that whatever the vine accomplishes the branches could also accomplish so any good that I do any any good deed that I do any any work that I do for God it's not me accomplishing it it's not my earthly life doing any good but it's him it's his life it's Jesus doing his work through me no wonder he said greater works than this shall you do when I go to my father if I go away then I'm going to come again to you one other scripture said I'm going to send another comforter to you aren't you glad he abides have you ever sung that old hymn he abides I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way the comforter abides not only with me what else he abides in me Oh hallelujah let me read this verse these two verses of scripture to you in the amplified bible i still do a lot of my reading and preaching from the King James Version of the Bible I do indeed but I also very much like to read scriptures in the amplified perhaps you might find a parallel Bible it's a wonderful tool to have where you can have the version the King James Version and perhaps the Amplified Bible next to it or maybe the new American Standard just don't get too carried away with a with a modern version that waters down the truth of the scripture I don't want you to do that and if you ever get in a place where you're not sure then there are so many tools out there to look up the original meaning of the original language when you start looking at the meaning the original words that were used it just amplifies and that's one of the reasons why I like the amplified it says in John 8:31 32 amplified so Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in him if you abide in my word and that in brackets hold fast to my teachings and live in accordance with them hallelujah that's what it means to abide in the word continue in the word it means holdfast to the teachings of Jesus Christ and then live in accordance to them it's not optional for you and I we can't decide yay or nay yes I think I'll live by the word or no I don't I know it's true but I'm not going to live by it if we know it's true and we are indeed children of God then it becomes absolutely necessary that we live by what we know I think that's a very important truth to walk in in this new year is that we would not just call him Lord but we would let him be Lord we would make him lord over every part of our lives I believe that your desire I do I believe there are many people who will see this program and your desire is that Jesus would rule and reign over your life he doesn't do that externally he doesn't do that from from billions of light-years away in a place called heaven Jesus wants to rule and reign over your life from within allow him to do sit on the throne of your spirit that Ark of the Covenant that we study when we study the tabernacle of Moses that the outer court and the holy place and the Holy of Holies the inside of the inside the Holy of Holies is in your spirit that's where Jesus desires to make his throne and he wants to rule through the dimension of your soul and through the dimension of your body your flesh but he wants to do it internally from the inside of the inside that's how the Word of God can make you freedom it's because he he recreates from the inside out oh my what a wonderful life what a wonderful life we can have if we can not only know this truth but constantly remind ourselves when things aren't going so good that's a good time to remember but Jesus you're on the throne of my spirit and I'm gonna listen carefully for your voice for your direction for your leadership because I know that if I do it by myself I'm gonna make a big ol mess a big genuine mess that's what I do when I call the shots but when I listen for the still small voice of the Spirit of God within his life in me then I know the will of God and I can do the will of God because once the will of God is revealed to us from the inner man from the inside of the inside the grace is automatically available once we understand the leadership of the Lord from the realm of the Spirit the grace is already there the grace is already in our account to do what God is leading us to do to do what Jesus is directing us to do from the inside of the inside I hope that my terminology or vocabulary doesn't confuse you or make this sound more complicated than I want it to be because it's not that complicated in fact I think the church world has done a pretty good job at making it complicated I don't want to do that I want to make it simple enough that you can understand we're a triune being body soul and spirit as the New Testament teaches you can you can conform to God's Word with your body you know you can go to church you can take communion you can read your Bible you can treat your neighbor good and still not have Jesus ruling and reigning from the inside of the inside you can from the realm of a soul which is the mind the will and the emotions you can determine emotionally I'm going to serve the Lord as a Christian I'm going to I'm going to be identified with Jesus Christ but if you do it from the body by believing your behavior your actions are what matter the most or if you do it from the realm of the soul believing perhaps that your your emotions are what's going to strengthen you when the battle gets tough it's not going to stand when circumstances get rocky or stormy the only way to be able to stand for Jesus Christ in the perilous days that we live in now is to understand salvation Redemption from the inside out from the spirit man all the way through the mind the will and the emotions and all the way through to the body you see my hands were given to me as a gift from God to help my neighbor and to serve the Lord my eyes were made to see God's Word to read it he gave me a brain to help understand a spirit a mind to help understand the Word of God and so if we look at some of these external my feet we sing a song of when I was a boy we son this beautiful song and I still sing at some time I was born to serve the Lord my hands were made to help my neighbor my eyes were made to read God's Word my feet were made to walk in his footsteps my body is the temple of the Lord but we can't serve Him with our body only it has to come from the inside of the inside and it translates itself into good works the Spirit of God Jesus living in my spirit affects my emotion it affects that realm of the soul my mind my will and my emotions and then his life keeps transcending it keeps coming forward even into the body and so I want to do the things that please God it's not from the outside in it's from the inside out otherwise we can be whited Sepulcher the Bible tells us Jesus said we can be very beautifully decorated tombs on the outside but on the inside still full of dead men's bones because the transformation has to take place on the inside first and then work its way to the outside let me get back to my subject okay he said if you abide in me hold fast or in abide in my word hold fast to my teachings and live in accordance with them you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth in amplified it says will set you free so you're going to be set free and then by the revelation of his word you're transformed into freedom made freedom it's such a state of being free that nothing that is bound nothing that is not free can abide it can't stay very long it has to be moved out and again that's the work of the Holy Spirit to help us to do that when we read these beautiful promises I'm going to be set free there's going to be no bondage in my life sometimes we wonder well I believe it's true why doesn't it work in me why doesn't that word of God perform in my life what it says it comes to perform for instance we read in the New Testament that we have been made more than conquerors through Jesus Christ who strengthens us what about the fact that we don't always conquer what about the fact that sometimes we we are conquered by circumstances by thought paradigms etc habits that we want to break but instead of us conquering them they seem to conquer us does that mean that God's Word doesn't work does that mean that it only works for some what does that mean I guess it could be so discouraging if you didn't have the understanding of Scripture you just give up and say well it may work for you granny but it doesn't work for me well there's some truths that we need to understand about how to help God's Word to be effective in our lives and I don't mean that God needs our help but he does need our cooperation he does desire our yielded Ness and our surrender so one of the things we want to do if we want to be made free or freedom or set free or if we want to be made more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ one of the things we do is we continue in the word we abide in the word and we choose to live in a constant state of expectancy of faith if God said it that settles it when fear dread doubt whatever it is comes creeping in we just deal with that by taking it to the Word of God the scripture tells us that we are to take every thought captive so we take all of our thoughts and we bring them back to the word if they don't line up with God's Word we reject those thoughts if they are in continuity with God's Word something on the inside of us says amen amen amen amen and we continue to believe to embrace to reach forward and lay hold of the truth that God's Word is trying to speak to us one of the things I think we have to understand is that all truth comes in seed form when God begins to open up our lives with a truth from his word we don't always get the whole you know almost said I don't know if you know this expression or not but I almost said the whole kit and caboodle I hope you I hope you understand what I mean you you know you you another expression that we use in the South sometime you get the whole shebang it means you get the cart and the horse all at the same time well it doesn't work that way we don't we don't plant the seed in the morning and get the harvest in the evening there there's a cycle there's a season seed time and then growth there there has to be water applied to the seed there has to be something to fertilize if the soil is deficient there has to be fertilizer supplemented and you've got to weed out those chokers you've got to dig up those creepers that will come and try to wrap themselves around your harvest so you've got to use the hoe and you've got to be willing to pull the weeds and you've got to be willing to water the plant you've got to be willing to put a little a fertilizer on it when necessary and it has to get the right light etc so the seed is the word of God the Bible tells us that we hear it in the parables of Jesus Christ I love the way that Jesus taught in parables I like that some people think that he taught in parables because he wanted to to hide the truth but it's different it's not hiding the truth a parable conceals the truth in such a beautiful way to prepare our heart with expectation to receive the truth it's a very wonderful and effective way of teaching so the purpose of a parable was not to conceal the truth ultimately but to or to hide it just a bit until we get the understanding of the parable until we take the natural parable the natural story and compare it with the Word of God and with the spiritual and then we really see what it means like like the parable of the sower the seed was the Word of God but my look at all the things that begin to emerge to try to choke out the good Word of God in your field in your life well we have to be diligent we have to be fervent somebody said well you know rather Shelley that that sounds like work it is it is work but it's good work it's glorious work it's not all toil and sweat and labor and backache oh no sir there's great reward when we can look at areas of our life and see the Word of God beginning to flourish when I can see areas of my life let's say my field that were once planted with bad thoughts dark thoughts thoughts that would disqualify me thoughts that would make me feel insignificant or insufficient and now I look back over that place in my field in my garden and I see another plant growing in its place I see now instead of dark plantings I see green plantings a vibrant flourishing thoughts you see the Word of God is flourishing in areas of my life that were once very dark and dismal and when you see that happening in your own life yeah you get excited it's it's like I don't know if you if you care for gardening but I think a lot of you people do across the United Kingdom I think that a lot of people in the United Kingdom loved loved gardening and they loved their gardens and you know if you've ever planted something and and watched it grow it starts out as something so tiny and hard and you know it's easy to lose I don't know if you've ever been planting seed to only have a few and and drop one in the wrong place and you're trying to find it it seems so insignificant but when you see that thing beginning to grow and beginning to sprout and beginning to get strength and get taller it fills you if you if you care for gardening it fills you with a sense of accomplishment it works the same way in the spirit when we begin to see areas of our life that were once very unfruitful very barren certain certain painful places that we have it we've experienced in the past and it seems that the fruit that is produced from those dark painful experiences is rotten fruit it's it's darkness it's it's more pain but when we begin to learn the principles of God's Word and we pull out those those bad weeds those bad seed and get rid of all that and we begin to replace it with the truth of God's Word for today in our life and we see that beginning to take over and spread a little bit it gives us a sense of accomplishment even though we know it's not what we have accomplished but it's what His Word is accomplishing in us so yes there's some toil involved I think one of the main things that I would say is consistency is is required to be persistent to be willing to keep coming back and abiding in that state of expectancy that what God said it may not you may see the fruit of it today you may not see the fruit of it tomorrow but keep expecting keep looking keep believing I'm reminded of the Prophet and his servant when the word of the Lord went out and said there's going to be rain and the servant of the Lord goes out it looks he comes back all there's nothing nothing there go look again well there's nothing yet go look again finally he comes back with the report well huh there was a little cloud there was a tiny little cloud about the size of a man's hand and what did the Prophet say oh I hear the sound of abundance of rain he just needed a little sign and sometimes we we ought to be rejoicing over the little movement that we see toward what God has promised you know it doesn't the whole harvest doesn't come in overnight but but we see it beginning to come in and that gives us great joy so these are some of the things we can do we we praise the Lord for what we see happening we we thank God that barren areas of our life are now planted with truth and we expect it to keep coming forth so here's the point that I wanted to bring you today I said all of that to kind of boil it down to this we are responsible for the Word of God not only are we taking sides with God's Word not only is it important for us by faith to take God at His Word but we are somewhat responsible for what we do with the Word of God once we are presented it is presented to us I should say once the Word of God is made real to us we see it we can believe it we can embrace it then it's important how we approach it how we steward it what what do we do with it what we do with the seed after it's planet will determine where there are not it bears fruit in our life so when God presents something to you from his word maybe you you've been reading the Bible all of your life and you've looked over certain aspects of truth all of a sudden you're watching the gospel Channel you hear one of these preachers saying one little sentence that sparks something in you there's an awakening that takes place in your thought process and you say wait a minute is that really what God's Word said you grab your Bible you start looking up the scripture and and the next thing you know another scripture comes to mind and you're able to connect those scriptures together my this is good when those things begin to happen in our lives that is the basis of Revelation when the Spirit of God starts connecting truth with truth then we're moving from one place of glory one realm of glory to another realm and it becomes very very important so when we hear the word of God we should start agreeing with it immediately and we should start believing that word and we should start acting upon it as soon as possible let me read you another very good scripture that I'd like for you to hold on to and that's in mark chapter 4 beginning in verse 24 Jesus has just said if any man has ears to hear let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend and now in verse 24 and he said to them listen very carefully to the SI i I ask you to listen to this this is so good for me and he said to them be careful what you are hearing be careful what you are hearing and we could go back to the grandmothers old saying you know your ears are not a garbage can and they're not and we should indeed be careful what we hear and and what we what we let in our ear gate or our eye gate we are Watchmen at the gate to make sure that we don't allow things to come in and abide in us and linger with us that would defile us or cause us to miss believe God's Word or to fall in total unbelief he says be careful what you are hearing now listen the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear oh my how many of us have ever heard a sermon heard God's Word neighbor shared the Word of God or preacher shared the Word of God at our church or on gospel channel and we just let it we say prover bleah in one ear and out the other or we shed the word of God like a duck shed water we just hear it and we just let it pass away we just let it flow right past us but this is not how we should treat God's Word because it has great value what a treasure it is to have the written record of God's Word so that we can then meditate on that written record of God's Word while calling on the Spirit of God to come and make that word alive in us be careful what you're hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure the measure you give will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you my this means that with power and with a with an increase in your relationship with the Lord that's what's promised here virtue and knowledge is this knowledge it's not just head knowledge its intimate knowledge it's entering into a deeper place of fellowship and relationship and virtue is of course power and and authority to operate from the Word of God so the measure of careful thought and study we give to the word is the same measure that we get back in virtue and knowledge let me leave my commentary out and just read the verse in the amplified the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more Alleluia here's the abundance and more besides will be given to you who hear hallelujah so I want to say it does matter what we do with the Word of God that we read it does matter with what we do with the Word of God that we hear and so I think this is why the scripture tells us study to show yourself approved unto God dig a little deeper in this great storehouse of God's Word direct your life not according to feeling but according to God's Word position yourself to receive your inheritance by obeying God's Word by never ignoring it or disregarding it or treating it common or ignoring a truth when God is absolutely trying to make it real to us and he does that one of the ways that God does that with this word is by repetition and by confirmation we keep hearing something over and over again sometimes people will have that with a number they keep running into a particular number over and over again and they don't understand why and then one day they're reading the Bible and there's chapter and verse it's the number that they keep seeing over and over again oh I don't believe it can work that way listen it certainly can God can do all kinds of glorious and amazing and unusual things to connect you with His Word and so if seeing a number and a dream over and over or every time you look at the clock it's a certain number and and later something begins to kind of unfold to you and you find a verse that si oh yes that can be God I'm not saying it is every time but that can be God and if indeed he's connecting you with a certain place a certain portion of Scripture it's because there's something in that word that's part of your inheritance and you want to line yourself up in faith align yourself in faith to be able to become a beneficiary to make that word of God that was spoken in a very general way make it become a very personal truth to you that's my prayer for you that's that's what I'd like to bless you with in 2018 it's an awareness of the value of God's Word in your life and if you feel like I read it but it doesn't happen in my life I read it but it doesn't work for me you tell that dirty devil he's a liar he is a liar and the father of all lies and you start continuing in the word and abiding in the word by staying in a constant state of expectancy never entertaining doubt and when it comes rebuke it and send it on the way and tell everybody around you I'm going to stand firmly on God's Word and you begin to see through the cycles of of seed time and harvest you'll begin to see the Word of God working mightily in your life in this great year of 2018 and beyond until Jesus comes I bless you in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for staying with me today I hope that something has been said that will cause you to to let God's Word work mightily in your heart now and forever thank you again for watching see you next time bye-bye [Music]
