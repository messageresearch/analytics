[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope a lord hello and welcome to episode 10 in a series that we have entitled schemes and devices we are exposing the enemy his plots and plans against the children of God I am so thankful that the scripture reveals so many different truths about how to be watchful how to be vigilant how to be alert so that we are not taken by surprise at any attempt of the enemy to discourage or to defeat us I'm Pastor Steven Shelley from New Hope revival ministries and we're coming to you in partnership with the gospel channel and I just pray that this series has been a blessing to you and I would have to say that it must have been because we have heard from so many different people who have watched the program and who have taken the time to let us know what a blessing it has been to you and also to share with us your prayer requests and I just covenant with you that I will be faithful to take those prayer requests before the Lord and my faith is no more special than your faith we both have been given as a gift of God faith that's what the scripture tells us but when we join our faith together we become a pretty part powerful team we become partners in faith and I truly believe that when we bind together when we agree together that we can absolutely see the victory that we've been hoping for and longing for so continue to reach out with your prayer requests and let us know if this program in this series has been of a particular blessing in your life and I'd like to say again that any Epis that you missed and I think that every episode has been important and I believe that that you would be blessed and strengthened and encouraged if you would take an opportunity to go back and watch anything that you've missed and you can do that on our YouTube channel and new hope revival ministries you can find it by doing a search on YouTube you can even subscribe to the channel and what that means is you'll be notified when any additional content has been added and I'm just excited about using any method that that is available to help get the truth the gospel and encouragement to the people of God and that's why I'm also so thankful for the gospel channel and I just encourage you to partner with them with your prayer support with your financial support and let's just believe God for great expansion in the area of Christian media all over the world until Jesus comes back and receives his bride and I truly believe that we're living in the end of the end we're living in the last of the last days and I believe that there are going to be beautiful demonstrations of God's love and God's power on planet earth I know that things are dark out there but I'm so thankful that when the world around us is getting darker it's time for the people of God to arise and shine and let the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ reach out from our lives to a world that needs hope and needs help and you and I as believers we have the hope and we have the help through Jesus Christ that the world needs I want us to go to our study today when we were together the last time in episode 9 we ended our program the teaching from that particular episode with a verse of scripture that I have always found to be particularly sad it's in second Timothy chapter 4 in verse 10 where the Apostle Paul says for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and the word that is used for world there is a word that means the age the time frame and so we could say that the scripture could redeem us have forsaken me having loved this present age and I want you to know that the love of the world to love the world to love the age that you're living in to embrace the spirit of this last age is a very very dangerous place for people to live in this hour there are so many things that the scripture speaks to us about in not loving the world we're in the world but as children of God as children of the light we are not of this world our citizenship is in a higher place and years ago we used to have a song that said I'm a citizen of two worlds and it's hard to choose between them but I want you to know as the day's grow as we move along and we see what's happening around us in the world it's getting easier and easier to choose our other citizenship to choose the other world the one where we are going by salvation by grace from Jesus Christ and salvation through his blood we have the opportunity to go to that other place to live for all eternity with the Lord you know I know there are people who still struggle to believe such a thing but the Bible tells us that if in this life only we have hope we are of all men most miserable I want to tell you today wherever you're watching this program my hope is not in this world my hope is in the law Jesus Christ my hope is in the Word of God and I believe that there is victory and deliverance available for you in your life right now one of the things that we do to position ourselves to receive what God has for us in this hour is to make sure that we are not in love with this world we are in love with Jesus Christ and we are pursuing him and his destiny purpose and plan for our future I want to read a portion of Scripture as we get started today it's found in Philippians chapter 3 beginning in verse 17 and I'll read all the way to verse 21 and I'm going to read it today from the amplified bible brethren together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set you this was the Apostle speaking to the people asking them to make sure that they follow the example and the pattern that has been set before them for there are many of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears who walk live as enemies of the cross of Christ The Anointed One they are doomed and their fate is eternal misery perdition their God is their stomach their appetites their sensuality and they glory in their shame siding with earthly things and being of their party this is what happened to Dimas he fell in love with the spirit of his age instead of falling in love with the Messiah with the Lord Jesus Christ he followed the appetites of the world the senshu and the lust for the things of the world instead of for the things of God verse 20 but we are citizens of the states the Commonwealth the homeland which is in heaven and from it all so we earnestly and patiently await the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah a savior who will transform and fashion anew the body of our humiliation to conform to and be like the body of his glory and majesty by exerting that power which enables him even to subject everything to himself all what powerful words we are left with in this verse of scripture that even our body this lowly body that we live in here this body of humiliation will be totally transformed and fashioned after his glorious body and in his majesty by exerting that power which enables him even to subject everything to him selves we are citizens of another homeland I want you to remind yourself of that when when the spirit of this age is wearing on you if it's pulling to you you know maybe sometime it's not the pull of the spirit of the age it's the heaviness looking around and seeing so much darkness can be a heavy weight upon you but I want you to know it is important that we keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture tells us that if we put our shoulder to the plow and we look back that he has no pleasure in us it's better that we not make a vow than to make a vow and break that Val so I want to encourage you today if you feel like that you have fallen into a backslidden condition if you are no longer pressing toward Christ but you're just sort of coasting along or maybe sliding backward it is not too late for you to stand firm and know where you're standing and take God at His Word to ultimately see the enemy's access to your life cut off I believe that you and I as children of God can find a place in Christ where we recognize who we are and whose we are and we greatly limit the devil's access to be able to touch us we were recently studying together putting on the helmet of salvation in hope and I want to encourage you to continue to do that that your thoughts that your mind would be guarded dig into God's Word by the spirit and let God give you the ammunition that you need to defeat the works of darkness that would move against your life in this hour when we make up our minds that we are not going to be enticed we are not going to be allured by this present age we can know for sure that God will reward us for standing against the spirit of this age when we start making a stand to be different to swim against the current you know if it's if it's popular oftentimes if it's popular it's not godly I'm not saying every time but I'm saying the scripture tells us follow not a multitude to do evil to send the scripture also says though hand join in hand the wicked will not go unpunished so just because the majority is doing it just because the majority says it's alright there's no harm in that doesn't mean that it's good for you and it doesn't mean that it's what God has for your life you know I don't want to settle for second-best I don't want to settle for for a permissive will I want to know that I am walking in the fullness of my purpose my why the reason why I was born when we come to that place of having that desire and pouring that out before the Lord I truly believe that he honors that I believe that he will bless us in that when we set our affection on things above and not on the things of this earth when we make up our mind I'm not going to follow the world I'm not going to follow the fad I'm not going to just go with the flow but I'm gonna take a stand for truth for biblical truth for righteousness for holiness when we do that we begin to catch a vision of our heavenly citizenship you know I I grew up in a little old-time Pentecostal church and life was hard I've shared that with you before life was hard for these old Saints they worked very hard we our church was in a textile area and I tell you the work in the textile mill was hard work even the sisters even some of the ladies worked on those big old cotton looms and they were making hosiery or making denim a lot of denim was made in our area and those shuttles would would fly back and forth in those looms and sometimes they would shoot out and hit people in the head or the arm and sometimes those men and women would come in literally bruised from their jobs and sometimes even greater accidents would take place in those cotton mills and times were a little bit hard and but I want you to know I would often as a little boy sit on the front row of the church and I would watch those Saints gather around the piano that's the way it was done there was an acquire with robes or anything like that but in the corner an upright piano and that's what they call the choir so to speak the piano player would start playing and the song leader would start and and some of the saints not all of them but a handful of them would gather behind the piano and they would just sing there was no choir practice there was no reading of the music they just sung they just opened their mouths and let it fly and I want you to know the look that the transformational look that would come over their faces when they began to sing of another place oh I want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever of his saving grace on the hills of glory let me lift my voice cares all past home at last ever to rejoice in that moment the look of the changed look that would come over their face and they would sing with everything that was within them because in that moment they were not focused on their problems they were not focused on family issues they weren't focused on bills that were due they were focused on another home another place jesus said I I go away to prepare for you a place and if I go away I will return unto you again and receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also I believe that I still believe in those words of Jesus and I believe like those old Saints gathered around the piano that the more often we can get our minds on the other citizenship the land of our origin the land of our future the eternal home of the soul I believe the more often we can put our mind on that we are lifted up out of the circumstances and the depressions of life and it causes us to be less and less eluard by the things of this present age by the world around us we used to sing another song in the church I grew up in I don't want to get adjusted to this world and truly this is one of the keys to pressing in in times like the ones we're living in now to make sure that we don't get lulled to sleep by the present age that we don't become lukewarm because so many around us are lukewarm but we keep our eyes on Jesus Christ and in doing so we're remembering our other citizenship the home of the soul as we said a moment ago and and I really believe it's in that moment that we find the strength and we find the hope to keep pressing in and I believe we're strengthened by that against a lot of the things the enemy would throw our way to pull us or to attract us citizenship has rights and privileges as a citizen we're given free access to enter and exit our respective country so as citizens of another land as citizens of another home we have certain rights and privileges as we read just a moment ago in in this verse of scripture in Philippians even in a foreign land the citizen is granted special privileges and immunities due to the nation of which they are a citizen the second benefit of being delivered from this present age is that we live with an expectation of Christ's return we not be like Dimas we must not get our eyes on this present world but we must realize that we have a promise a blessed hope we have the the truth that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to receive those that are his those that are looking for him the complete Jewish Bible takes this verse and translates it like this and it is from there that we expect a deliverer the Lord Yeshua the Messiah verse 21 he will change the bodies we have in this humble state and make them like his glorious body we not only have a promise for the soul the spirit but we have a promise for this physical body we'll never be able to look with excitement for the Lord's return until we have truly been delivered from this present evil age the enemy will use anything he can to get you focused on the world around you he'll use entertainment he'll use pop culture he'll use popular music he'll do anything and everything he'll make it shine you know so many young people have been born with god-given gifts that could have been used to to build the kingdom of God to advance the purposes of Christ and yet the enemy was hanging around with his glitz and glitter and he was able to attract them in the same manner that he attracted Dimas and what a tragedy it is when God given gifts are used to serve sin to serve the enemy instead of serving God I just want to remind you I want to exhort you and encourage you because I love you don't get adjusted to this world don't allow the popular trends of immorality the blurring of the gender lines all of the things that are happening around us look God's Word is our pattern God's Word is our absolute truth in that word he defines and emphasizes the sanctity of life in this word he defines what God's idea of marriage and morality looks like and it may seem archaic in a world that has really forgotten and forsaken God but but to us to the citizens of light to the citizens of another Kingdom I'd rather align my life with this word and know that I have hope of a better world of another place of an eternity with him than to relax myself and fall into the popular way of the world around me be alert by this present age and and gamble with my own soul you know the Bible talks about the value of the soul and really our soul is the most valuable thing that we possess our our inner man is the most valuable thing that we really own it's not our possessions it's not our properties it's not our automobiles it's really the inner man and I think that we should really learn to value what God has given us in our spirit being we can feed that man by the Word of God I want you to know the spirit man that that spirit being on the inside of us it's not nourished by the things of the world it's not nourished by the sloppy entertainment of Hollywood oh no it's only strengthened and nourished by the pure meat of God's Word and you know as Christians there comes a time that we are weaned from the milk of the word and we begin to dig our teeth into the meat of God's Word and I think it's only the depth the meat of God's Word that's going to sustain us in such an hour as the one that we're living in right now as long as we're in love with the world we will never long for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but when we begin to divorce ourselves from the allure from the pull of this present age then we have more room in our life to begin to fall in love with what is on the other side and put our focus on that I remember one of God's great servants telling the story of being in a zoo with his son and it was such a wonderful experience for his little boy to be able to see all the amazing animals and it was a little bit sad that they were contained and that they were in cages but but the joy of being able to interact with them and and see them was was mostly worth understanding that the animals were not free to roam but then they came to the display of the eagle That Bird that was built for the heights and this great servant of God began to describe the look the faraway look in the eye of that eagle who was contained he wasn't born to hop around in a cage he wasn't even born to live in an in an aviary he was born for the sky to be free in fact in our nation the American Bald Eagle is the symbol of freedom and the symbol of Liberty and you know you and I as children of God we're like that eagle we weren't born to become formed to this world we weren't born to be contained and restricted and held back into this world or owned by the world around us we were born to be free we were born to soar through the sky we were born to express our love our devotion our appreciation to the Lord Jesus Christ and to point others to the light of the truth of the gospel when we're beginning to examine some of the strongholds that the enemy likes to have over our life and we have studied some of those thus far in this series it's tempting sometime to focus on what we see instead of the root cause it's often that way in medicine we go to the doctor we tell him all of our symptoms what we're experiencing and he prescribes for us medication that more often helps us with the symptom and we take that for a while and another symptom pops up and we take that he we take another bit of medicine and another and we go back and so they changed the medicine and and and things change but maybe sometime they're never really getting completely better and there's a reason for that it's because there's a root behind the condition we've got to find out what the root problem is what is the root cause of what we're experiencing now and we want to deal with that it's not just the fruit but it's the root we've got to go down and find out through discerning of spirits what is the root of this attack where did this originate where have I opened up a door for the enemy to be able to capture not so much of my attention in this manner the Bible tells us in Galatia ian's chapter 5 verses 22 and 23 but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such various no law I would say that every believer watching this teaching today knows those two verses of Scripture as the fruit of the Spirit and there's no doubt in my mind that's exactly what it is when we are filled and refilled with the Spirit of God these are the expressions of that spirit in filling in our life we should be expressing love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness meekness temperance faith against such there's no law these are the fruit of the Spirit on a trees outermost regions are branches and these branches are connected to to a main component of that tree or the main trunk of the tree the trunk is supported firmly beneath the soil by roots all of us know this if anything happens to the root system of that tree guess what happens the whole tree dies the tree can sometimes sustain damage to the limb to the trunk and still survive but if the roots are damaged if the roots are destroyed then over a period of time the entire tree dies if if only the addiction is dealt with in somebody's life then the help is not complete many many times in order for someone to walk in freedom from addiction it's important to understand that behind that addiction to alcohol to drugs to pornography to whatever the addiction is to food whatever the addiction is it's important to discover that behind that addiction there is always a root cause and so that addicted person can go through all kinds of rehab and all kinds of programs and can most often find relief but temporary relief why because the trunk of the tree the branches of the tree are being dealt with but the root is not being ministered to or health is not being provided for the root we're not finding what is the origin what is the cause and more times than not rejection is the root of the spirit of addiction many people fall into addiction it's not what they set out to do it's not what they set out to be it doesn't control their life in the beginning they still have the control most often they're able to to enjoy that addiction whatever it is and turn it on and turn it off in the sense that I'm getting the the charge or the thrill from the alcohol or from the drugs but yet I have to get up in the morning and go to work so I limit myself or I know I know just you know how much I can drink and still get up and be able to function I mean people begin to learn how to sort of turn that thing on and off but when addiction is not dealt with at the root this attraction and this compulsion to those things that will only destroy us in the end then it becomes uncontrollable and instead of you controlling the addiction or the substance it controls you does that make any sense to anyone watching this program I believe that most every person watching me today your family your life has in some way been touched by that spirit of addiction the route is often rejection but there is always a deeper problem behind the the habit or the abuse of a substance therefore the addiction is not the root of the problem the problem lies in the root it's like cutting a branch or pulling a leaf off of a tree branches grow back leaves grow back these spirits will just strengthen and the addiction will get stronger and you will lose control of this other spirit that begins to take ahold of your life so if you only treat the addiction or you only treat the symptom it's very likely that it will come back but the problem must be it can be and it must be dealt with on the root level the Bible tells us in in the words of Jesus in Matthew chapter 12 verse 33 either make the tree sound healthy and good and it's fruit sound healthy and good or make the tree rotten diseased and bad and it's fruit rotten deceased and bad for the tree is known and recognized and judged by its fruit it's very very possible to allow the holy spirit to reveal to us the root of the problem we were talking about recently how dabbling in in certain areas of the new age or of the occult can open up our lives to the demonic there are many many things that the enemy is watching over if he can capture your attention by some of those things my old granny used to say it's not the it's not the first pint of whiskey but it's the first drop that begins to make the alcoholic now I know there are many people that don't believe that kind of a statement but in reality it's more true than we care to admit the enemy watches over these things he entices us toward those things not for the purpose of relaxing us oh no that's not his purpose that may be what it serves in our lives temporarily but the enemy desires to take that very thing that once brought you a few minutes of relief or relaxation or you helped you deal with your stress the enemy desires to take that very same thing and control your life with it I really really believe that if we can fill our lives with the love of Jesus Christ if we can fill our our minds with the truth of God's Word we have the power and the ability to choke out any thought that the enemy tries to plant in our heart any addiction that the enemy wants to drag us into sometimes we have to muster all the strength we have as a human being and then it's still not enough to break ourselves free we call on the name of the Lord we ask God for deliverance to break every chain and when you're praying for your loved ones the whole purpose of even bringing this out to you today it's when you're praying for your loved ones don't just pray about the fruit don't just pray about the mess of life that you see them living and what you see them dealing with on the surface but why don't you begin to ask the Spirit of God to go down to the root of the problem to deal with the rejection to deal with the bitterness to deal with the resentment to go down into the deepest part of who that person is and began to minister his love I want you to know the love of Jesus Christ is the remedy for all rejection mentality for all the bitterness for all the woundedness for everything that is wrong in your life or in the life of your loved ones the love of Jesus it doesn't just neutralize what the enemy is doing it absolutely can cancel it can cut it out like a cancer I believe in in deliverance let's just call it what it is I believe in deliverance I believe that there's power in the Word of God there's power in the truth of who God is by the Spirit of God we have power to break yokes to see our loved ones set free sometimes we think well if I can get them in a different environment if I if I can get them to another preacher if I can listen it's deeper most of the time it's deeper than that let's pray about the route if you're needing healing today let's not just pray about the symptoms let's pray about the root of the disease of the infirmity hi I'm gonna say something that a lot of people may not completely agree with but even medical science is beginning to tell us that oftentimes what we see manifesting in our physical body as sickness is the result of something going on on a much deeper level in our human emotions what in the world are you saying preacher one minute you sound old-fashioned and then the next minute you you're talking hocus pocus but no friend this isn't hocus-pocus at all what what researchers are finding out is that we hold onto our wounds and we hold onto our hurts and we hold on to some of the ways that we have been mistreated and abused in life we never get it dealt with we never really bring it to the love of Jesus Christ and submit it under the blood and and and and become set free from from that past we hold on to it not really understanding how to move beyond it and that in itself can begin to have a very serious effect on the physical body we know that many diseases have emotional roots now that doesn't mean that it's in someone's mind and and they're not really sick that's not what I'm saying at all that's another issue altogether I'm talking about real infirmity real sickness that's caused from an emotional problem or a spiritual problem but I have good news for you there's not a case that's too difficult or too complicated for the Lord Jesus Christ he knows how to heal us on every level of who we are not just our physical body but he knows how to heal us at the root of our condition the root of rejection can usually be dealt with in your life by a decision to forgive there is such power in forgiveness the enemy would never be able to use that root of rejection in your life again if you could find the strength if you can't find it in yourself find it in the Lord find it in the truth that he has forgiven you of so much if Jesus can forgive us from so much so much rebellion so much sin so much unbelief all the things that we may have gun committed in our past life and yet he just forgives us his love reaches deeper than that his blood is able to wash every bit of that away and we didn't deserve forgiveness in fact we were forgiven before we asked we asked because that's how we receive but it was already done if we can sometimes remember that that we were unworthy of this forgiveness but God so freely provided it for us why because he loved us sometimes in reminding ourselves of that forgiveness the Bible even says that to the one who is forgiven much love it much there's just something about knowing I am forgiven that helps give me power to forgive other people I truly believe that a lot of this root of rejection in Our Lives can be ministered to it can be abolished it can be cut out of our life if we make a choice a decision to forgive those who have rejected us I truly believe that we can make a decision to lay down bitterness to lay down resentment to lay down judgment how could you make it sound so easy preacher because we're not doing it by ourselves we don't have to do this on our own we don't even have to forgive those who have wronged us on our own did you know you can ask the Lord I know because I've experienced it in my own life when I didn't have power strength grace goodness whatever is necessary to forgive those who had wronged to me I found the strength that I needed to forgive by calling on the Lord for His grace for his strength for his love for his power in that amazing it's amazing that he is for us not against us and that everything we need to deal with every issue in our life he provides if we ask you don't have to be ashamed to say Lord I cannot forgive him I in my own strength I cannot make myself forgive that person who's so wrong to me who so abused me who so took advantage of me but I am asking you for for strength to forgive I'm asking you for grace to forgive and you know what often happens he pours out his love toward you you begin to feel the love of God towards you and when you do it makes it so much easier forgiveness is not about setting the other person free anyway it's about setting you free if that person in your life whoever they are if they're still involved in your life or if it's a part of your distant past if you'll call on the Lord I believe he'll help you get to the root of the problem and I believe he'll give you the love and grace that you need to be completely set free in the absence of forgiveness the person can never go free they may get a temporary fix but the addiction will come back the habit will come back the substance abuse will come back and sometimes it will even get worse when you treat the root of the tree you're treating the fruit when you treat the root when the root gets healthy the tree becomes healthy and the fruit that is produced from the tree becomes healthy and when we begin to look at the root of different issues in our life there's a scripture that talks about witchcraft and the root of witchcraft or manipulation is rebellion and I think maybe some of you remember that in 1st Samuel Chapter 15 the Bible talks about that Samuel the Prophet prophesied or spoke the Word of God to Saul that he should attack utterly destroy the Amalekites for opposing the children of Israel when they first arrived in the land of promise generations before and according to the instructions that were given not just men but women and children and everything had to be dealt with it was a time of possessing the inheritance that God had given to the people and and if any of of that which was living in the land at the time if it was allowed to continue to thrive there was the possibility that would it come back and and that this thing would never be dealt with and so God gave very specific instructions and King Saul as instructed he went out to conquer the Amalekites but he failed to follow through on all of God's directives he destroyed all the people and the animals but he reserved the choicest livestock for his men and himself and he also preserved the life of King Agag who was the king of the Amalekites I think you probably remember the story and when samuel confronted saw for failing to obey God's commandments completely he rebuked Saul by saying first samuel 15 verse 23 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry I find this interesting because rebellion is likened to witchcraft and stubbornness is likened to idolatry you see every every negative manifestation in our life has another root it has another spiritual root or spiritual cause so we learn here there there's a spirit behind rebellion and it's not the Holy Spirit rather it's the spirit of witchcraft or manipulation how can a stubborn person be guilty of idolatry he makes an eye of all of his own opinions his opinions become like gods like idols to him stubbornness says I'll do it my way and God says that is idolatry when we choose to do it our way instead of considering God's way the scripture says we are guilty of idolatry I don't know if you've ever known someone who so trusted in their opinions that they actually worship their own ideas but that's exactly what the scripture is talking about in these in this portion of Scripture rebellion and witchcraft are like identical twin sisters if you find one you'd better look for the other if witchcraft is present manipulation is present then rebellion is somewhere at the root of the manifestation of that manipulation or witchcraft they're seldom separated they operate together in the New Testament when the Bible speaks about witchcraft first it calls it a work of the flesh secondly it's referred to as an evil spiritual power first a work of the flesh and then an evil spiritual power so if we start talking about witchcraft as one of the schemes and devices of the enemy we have to understand that witchcraft is more than just someone belonging to a group a coven of witches and operating in in in dark magic or in curses or incantations we have to understand that there's a form of witchcraft that's a work of the flesh and that is when we rebel against the purposes of God in our life we're already operating in a measure of witchcraft we see in Galatians chapter 3 at verse 1 who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified this is the Apostle Paul talking to the church at Galatia using a term that translates in English who has bewitched you we could paraphrase that by saying who has cast a spell on you that you are not obeying the truth see it was rebellion we know the truth we hear the truth but we refuse to do it we're going to walk in our own way it's like the Old Testament talks about it on more than one occasion when the people were doing their own way their own living their own life and the scripture calls it like this every man did that which was right in his own eyes that's so dangerous the Bible has given us an absolute truth of what is right and what is wrong and we're obligated in fact it's really a privilege as citizens of the kingdom of God to live by what God has called us to live by it's a privilege it's not a heavy burden on our shoulders the Bible says there's a scripture that says His commandments are not Grievous to me why because I left him when you love the Lord you want to bring your life into alignment with what God's Word says so that you can also enjoy the benefits and the blessings of walking in the word I want to encourage you to make sure as you're searching your life to see if there is any open areas there that that need to be dealt with because the enemy is accessing through those through those areas while you're searching make sure that there is no rebellion in heart you are fully surrendered you are fully committed to follow the Lord Jesus Christ all the way to surrender to submit to the Word of God and what God is calling you to if indeed you are then it becomes much easier to find the freedom that you're looking for if while searching your life you find some areas that you're still holding on to your will to your way I want it to be this way this is how I want it to turn out this is what I'm after I'm not going to settle for anything less than this but if this is not God's Way then you're actually operating in a spirit of rebellion which will manifest in your life like witchcraft it can cause you a tremendous amount of trouble that you just absolutely do not want to have father I ask right now I know that we've covered some unusual subjects here and we've maybe had a couple of subjects in one and in one lesson but I just pray for sincere hearts that are watching this program right now I just pray that you will by your grace and mercy put your finger on every area of their lives as they submit it and hold it before you where there might be an element of rebellion where there might be an element of demanding their own right instead of your way and your purpose and your plan and I pray that you'll point that out and that you will provide the grace as they call on your name so that every open door that the enemy is taking advantage of to launch attack against them and those they love I pray that it can be slammed shut in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and access denied we just say right now by faith to the enemy access denied I'm a child of God washed in the blood of Jesus I pray right now Lord for any person watching this program who has a route of rejection in their life that's holding them back or that's driving them to addiction the woundedness of rejection the pain of being rejected and yet it grows like a root in their life and they're having a hard time dealing with the addiction or dealing with the fruit because there's a root problem I pray Lord that you will deal with people now that you will release power and strength right now for every person in that condition so that they might be able to forgive so that they might be able to release to set free all of those who have wounded them or rejected them that the root could be healed that that that the root could be dealt with so that good fruit godly fruit the fruit of the Spirit could be produced in their life I pray this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen any man I want to invite you again to contact us with your prayer requests I truly believe that the Lord wants to move on your behalf will join our faith together we'll believe God for a brighter future I know that if we can see God move in the root of the problem we can see more beautiful fruit we can see the fruit of the Spirit we can claim this verse of scripture for our life more love more joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance we claim that out of our life in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for watching this program tuning in again next time bye bye father [Music]
