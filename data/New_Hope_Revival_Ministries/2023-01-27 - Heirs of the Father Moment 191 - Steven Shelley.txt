Description:
We are heirs of the Father and joint heirs with Jesus.  Everything in Christ has been poured into the Bride of Jesus Christ.  That is power, that is authority.  That is supernatural.  That is our inheritance given through the blood and body of our Lord Jesus.  We are entitled to it by election and His precious blood price. That is how we walk in salvation, in healing, in deliverance.  Jesus is our High Priest of our confession, and He takes it before the Father.
