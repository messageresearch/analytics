[0:00] you and i who have lived our whole life
[0:03] as just men
[0:09] we graduate to something else
[0:12] god men
[0:20] isaiah prophesied 600
[0:24] some say 700 years before messiah was
[0:28] born
[0:29] that there was going to come a child
[0:32] there was going to come a son
[0:34] there was going to come one who would be
[0:36] wonderful and counselor
[0:38] mighty god and the everlasting father
[0:41] the prince of peace don't don't miss
[0:43] that because
[0:45] it gives us a great prophetic
[0:47] understanding
[0:48] of the godhead he's not only the son
[0:52] but he is the everlasting father
[0:55] there's only one being talked about in
[0:58] isaiah chapter 9
[1:00] and verse 6. it's not two different
[1:02] persons
[1:03] or three different persons here in the
[1:06] godhead but
[1:07] that same son that is given
[1:11] that also is the everlasting father
[1:15] it also is the child that's born to us
[1:19] the one upon whom shoulders the whole
[1:22] government of god
[1:24] would sit upon we're blessed to know him
[1:27] if you believe we're blessed to know him
[1:29] today say amen
[1:30] i didn't say just know about him we're
[1:33] blessed to know him
[1:34] in an intimate way by the spirit of
[1:37] adoption we
[1:38] are allowed to call him papa god
[1:41] abba father not just our father
[1:45] but my father there's power
[1:49] in that there's power in understanding
[1:52] the relationship
[1:54] that god has made available to us
[1:57] with him do you believe he was the word
[2:00] made flesh
[2:01] do you believe that all that was in the
[2:04] father was in him
[2:06] he would be fullness then wouldn't he he
[2:08] is
[2:09] in fact the express image
[2:12] of god and the entirety of the godhead
[2:16] the bible
[2:17] tells us that the entirety of the
[2:19] godhead
[2:20] dwelt in him it dwelt
[2:24] in his physical form but for some reason
[2:28] he wasn't born with it all
[2:32] i want you to think about the process he
[2:36] wasn't born
[2:37] in completion he who would be complete
[2:41] he who would be the first
[2:44] perfect god man
[2:47] god in spirit man
[2:51] in fleshly body and yet there was
[2:54] a process there was a development
[2:58] there was a growing up that had to take
[3:01] place in his life
[3:03] he chose to do it that way for you
[3:06] because he was looking for a patterned
[3:09] son
[3:10] he was to become a pattern son
[3:14] one that you and i could look at his
[3:16] life
[3:17] and pattern our life after his life
[3:20] knowing that if he who was god in the
[3:23] flesh
[3:24] would be born without the total
[3:26] completion
[3:27] and manifestation of what had been
[3:30] prophesied of him but he would grow
[3:32] and he would come up into the stature of
[3:35] the perfect man
[3:36] we look at that and we say if he had to
[3:39] do it
[3:40] and did it by the grace of god he turns
[3:42] around and said because i did
[3:45] because i was able you are also
[3:48] able he was showing himself in such a
[3:51] way
[3:52] that you and i can look at him and say
[3:53] my if he could grow up into something
[3:57] then i can grow up into something as
[3:59] long as i've got the same spirit in me
[4:01] that he had in him same spirit
[4:05] again we look at it and we say oh but he
[4:07] was god
[4:08] yes but he was man he was growing
[4:12] into something did you know he had to
[4:14] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[4:20] he was all god yet he was all man
[4:25] he had to have the same infusion
[4:28] you see he received who god was
[4:31] as an earnest
[4:35] when he was created
[4:38] in the womb of mary to become a begotten
[4:41] son
[4:43] he received an earnest of all that he
[4:45] would be
[4:46] when you were born again through
[4:48] repentance
[4:49] through justification the process
[4:52] of the new birth begins you receive an
[4:56] earnest
[4:57] of what you will one day carry the
[4:59] fullness of
[5:01] you get enough of the spirit of god and
[5:03] your repentance and in your conversion
[5:06] to lead you to guide you to direct you
[5:09] to bring you to all truth the bible said
[5:12] but you can't get by without the baptism
[5:15] of the holy ghost
[5:17] it's not just an infilling it's not just
[5:19] god filling us up
[5:21] but it's god filling us up and then
[5:23] plunging
[5:24] us beneath the holy ghost we are
[5:28] baptized in the spirit just like we are
[5:31] immersed in baptism with water
[5:35] if somebody could see ahead
[5:38] and recognize who you are
[5:41] as an adopted son of god going through
[5:45] your
[5:45] process just like jesus went through his
[5:49] just like brother william branham had to
[5:52] go through
[5:52] his you're going through yours
[5:56] so that at the end of this
[6:00] [Music]
[6:01] you and i who have lived our whole life
[6:04] as just men
[6:09] we graduate to something else
[6:13] god man
[6:26] you
