[0:28] oh
[0:37] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly
[0:40] and you're watching the Eagles cry I
[0:43] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[0:44] today and tell you what a privilege it
[0:47] is to be able to come to you in the
[0:49] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[0:52] hope that something will be said today
[0:55] that will inspire your
[0:57] faith maybe give you a little encourage
[0:59] encouragement to keep pressing on toward
[1:02] the kingdom of God I want to remind you
[1:05] that Jesus loves you he sees you where
[1:07] you are he knows your need he's waiting
[1:11] on you just to surrender that need to
[1:13] him take your hands off of it and let
[1:17] God take charge let him be in control
[1:20] you know so many times we come to the
[1:22] Lord with burdens and we say Lord I'm
[1:25] giving you my burden I'm giving you this
[1:27] need and we maybe kneel at the altar and
[1:30] lay it before him and when we get up we
[1:33] pick it up and take it home with us I
[1:35] want to encourage you not to do that I
[1:37] want you to know that the Lord is
[1:38] standing near right now ready to take
[1:41] your burden ready to carry your need if
[1:44] you'll just absolutely in faith turn
[1:47] loose of it and let God be in full
[1:50] control he is so faithful he never makes
[1:53] a mistake he never forgets one of his
[1:55] own he will in every situation come
[1:59] through for us if we can just believe
[2:02] only believe all things are possible and
[2:06] I believe that we are studying together
[2:10] the difference I guess between
[2:13] intellectual faith and Faith by
[2:16] Revelation a mental concept of believing
[2:20] and a spiritual revelation of belief um
[2:25] I think the difference is trust and I
[2:28] think one of the reasons why we so
[2:30] desperately need a clear Revelation from
[2:34] the Lord that our faith can be anchored
[2:37] in a revelatory truth is I think the
[2:41] main reason why we need that is so that
[2:44] we can trust so that we can really trust
[2:48] that the Lord will take care of it all
[2:52] and we'll talk about that uh in this
[2:54] session and maybe one more uh we are
[2:58] studying Peter we've been talking about
[3:00] the transition of Peter's Faith from a
[3:03] mental concept to a pure Revelation and
[3:07] at the end of the broadcast the last
[3:09] time we were together I was sharing with
[3:11] you a story that warms my heart a story
[3:15] of one of God's generals William
[3:17] brandham we refer to him out of respect
[3:20] and love as brother brandham because his
[3:22] life and Ministry has been such an
[3:25] inspiration in my own life and in my own
[3:28] Ministry and I was sharing sharing with
[3:30] you how that uh in the great Ohio flood
[3:33] many years ago brother brandom lost his
[3:36] wife and his baby girl and he was left
[3:39] to take care of a little baby boy all by
[3:42] himself he's standing by the gravide
[3:45] very very distraught and missing his
[3:48] wife and little girl so much and a man
[3:51] pulls up and begins to talk to brother
[3:52] brandom and he asked him did you hold on
[3:55] to your faith did you hold on to your
[3:57] religion during this awful time of loss
[4:01] and brother brandom just simply replied
[4:03] no it held on to me and I wanted to
[4:06] start the program the same way we ended
[4:08] the last program by reminding you that
[4:12] that's the kind of faith I'm talking
[4:13] about the kind of faith that holds you
[4:16] when you don't have enough strength to
[4:18] hold on it holds on to you and in
[4:21] finishing that story he gives one more
[4:25] uh very special statement that I really
[4:27] have enjoyed so much he said I was tied
[4:31] to him in the hours when my strength was
[4:35] gone and there was nothing that I could
[4:37] do so many times there are circumstances
[4:41] that there's nothing that we can do to
[4:43] change them and brother brandom said my
[4:46] anchor held within the veil of his word
[4:50] Yonder and I want you and I to come to
[4:54] that place where no matter what happens
[4:58] we can say my faith is anchored in the
[5:02] word of God out there it is holding on
[5:05] behind the veil even though I can't
[5:07] always see what it's attached to you
[5:11] know sometimes we we mentioned last week
[5:14] God is silent there are times in the
[5:17] middle of our crisis when we want so
[5:20] desperately to hear from God and it
[5:22] seems that we cannot and you may
[5:24] remember that I mentioned that in those
[5:27] times when God seems to be silent it
[5:30] almost seems that the devil has more to
[5:32] say and he just talks and talks and
[5:35] talks trying to discourage you trying to
[5:38] fill your life with hopelessness and
[5:40] despair but it may be that you have to
[5:43] shut him up you have to take authority
[5:45] over him you have to do what our lord
[5:48] Jesus did in his own Temptation in the
[5:50] wilderness Satan it is written you shall
[5:54] not tempt the Lord thy God or man shall
[5:56] not live by bread alone some verse of
[5:59] scripture that that fits that applies to
[6:03] the situation that you're going through
[6:05] at that particular moment that's one
[6:07] thing I love so much about the printed
[6:09] record of God's word the the Bible is
[6:12] because there's always a scripture
[6:14] somewhere that can speak to my need and
[6:18] I'm I'm amazed at how often the holy
[6:21] spirit will lead us when we're looking
[6:23] through the Bible reading through the
[6:24] Bible and how he will just direct us to
[6:27] the right little verse that just speaks
[6:29] to the need and speaks to our present
[6:32] circumstances and again this is why I
[6:35] feel like it's so important to let the
[6:37] holy spirit of God reveal the truth of
[6:40] the scripture to you until it becomes a
[6:42] part of who you are so that in death in
[6:45] grief in loss in tragedy whatever the
[6:48] situation is you've got something
[6:50] holding on to you when you feel like you
[6:53] can't hold on to him there's so many uh
[6:56] other uh aspects to this that I want to
[7:00] bring in as we try to bring this study
[7:02] to a close and one of those is if our
[7:05] faith is only a mental faith if it's
[7:08] only a an intellectual concept uh and
[7:11] not real trust and not real Spirit
[7:14] revealed Faith then what often happens
[7:17] is the enemy comes in with
[7:20] reasonings uh and we often get caught up
[7:23] when our soul begins to reason and and
[7:26] there will be all these elaborate
[7:28] excuses and reasoning that start
[7:30] flooding our mind and we have to take
[7:32] authority over uh and bring uh into
[7:36] captivity every thought that will exalt
[7:39] itself against the sovereignty uh of the
[7:43] Lord Jesus Christ and and his absolute
[7:46] ability to deliver all of these things
[7:49] start coming and the Soul starts crying
[7:51] out with reasonings and that's why
[7:54] intellectual Faith Can can actually be
[7:56] deceiving sometime because it is based
[7:59] on information and perceived facts or a
[8:05] perception of a fact what I'm trying to
[8:08] say is there are times that our faith
[8:12] cannot be based on fact alone it has to
[8:15] be based on something Beyond the Veil
[8:19] something Beyond uh natural vision in
[8:23] other words in those moments when there
[8:26] seems to be no reason to Hope but we
[8:29] hope in way um when everything is so
[8:32] discouraging and and the details and it
[8:34] seems like every day the story just gets
[8:37] worse and worse and yet there's
[8:39] something inside of you that's moving in
[8:41] the opposite direction when you when you
[8:43] would almost feel like giving up and yet
[8:46] there's something inside of you that
[8:47] says I will not give up I will keep
[8:50] pressing toward the lord and that is so
[8:54] important for us to understand that our
[8:56] faith cannot be based in facts alone
[8:59] alone because the fact may be that you
[9:02] have an incurable heart condition uh the
[9:05] fact may be that divorce is imminent uh
[9:09] the fact may be that your children are
[9:11] running away from God but my faith
[9:14] cannot be based in that fact alone my
[9:18] faith has to be based on something else
[9:21] the absolute word of God uh the word of
[9:24] God that is revealed to us by the Holy
[9:26] Spirit and so uh sometimes we have to
[9:30] just make up our mind uh I'm not going
[9:33] to read the news I I'm not going to
[9:35] listen to what the world says around me
[9:37] I'm going to shut myself in uh to the
[9:42] promises of God I'm going to hide
[9:44] underneath the arms the the wings the
[9:48] psalmist David talks about hiding under
[9:50] his wings and underneath his feathers
[9:53] and and you know what that's exactly
[9:55] where we need to be sometime just
[9:57] underneath the Lord's wings uh just let
[10:00] him gather us up I love that I love that
[10:03] analogy and I can see it so often um
[10:06] I've learned about the eagle a lot and I
[10:08] I love the eagle and uh we were just
[10:11] blessed a few a few weeks ago to have a
[10:14] a an eagle visit us here on our
[10:17] Campground and um we we've seen them the
[10:20] last few years uh a couple of eagles
[10:22] circling over the parking lot but it had
[10:25] been many years since uh I actually saw
[10:28] an eagle that was perched in a tree and
[10:31] uh a couple Sunday mornings back one of
[10:33] our brothers saw this big beautiful
[10:35] Eagle perched in a tree and we all went
[10:38] out and enjoyed it so much because the
[10:40] property that God gave us where our
[10:42] church is and where I'm speaking to you
[10:44] from right now he told us many years ago
[10:47] that we should name this property
[10:49] Eagle's refuge and so we believe it is a
[10:53] refuge for some of God's Eagles and do
[10:57] you know spirit filled and prophetic Le
[11:00] people are often referred to in the
[11:02] Bible uh as an eagle and and so I like
[11:06] that analogy and we learn about the
[11:09] eagle uh when the little baby eagle is
[11:12] learning to fly that the mother
[11:15] sometimes even the father uh I think but
[11:17] generally the mother will take the
[11:19] little eaglets out to to test their
[11:21] wings and to learn how to fly and how to
[11:25] navigate the currents of the wind and
[11:28] they start out sometime by the little
[11:30] eaglets holding on to the back of its
[11:34] mother and and sometimes has to use its
[11:36] beak and and little Talons to hold on to
[11:39] the back of his mother and then there
[11:41] comes a time where she just drops them
[11:43] and and lets them uh begin to try to fly
[11:47] and set their wings for themselves but
[11:49] they tell us that there are five primary
[11:52] feathers on the end of uh of the Eagle's
[11:55] Wings and those feathers can be rotated
[11:58] in a certain direction that creates a
[12:01] centrifugal type Force so that if that
[12:04] little baby eaglet gets too far away
[12:07] from Mother's care she just starts
[12:09] rotating those wing tips and it creates
[12:13] almost like a suction that pulls that
[12:15] little baby eaglet right back up under
[12:18] the mother you know what I like that and
[12:20] I don't mind that at all I'm so grateful
[12:24] to serve a living God who loves me so
[12:28] much that if I should get a little too
[12:31] confident or get a little too far from
[12:33] him that he has the ability just to draw
[12:36] me a at his own will draw me right back
[12:40] up underneath him for protection from
[12:43] harm and from the elements um and so
[12:46] just remember that you can't always base
[12:50] how you feel on what you know with a
[12:53] mental concept because again the facts
[12:56] can be awful Grim but sometimes we have
[13:00] to take those things into consideration
[13:03] but also look to the Unseen look to the
[13:07] things that we cannot see and know that
[13:10] God is working behind the scene to bring
[13:15] everything uh into our lives for our
[13:18] good now that doesn't mean that
[13:20] everything that happens to us is good
[13:23] but everything that happens to us
[13:26] happens to us for our good and not for
[13:29] our harm and you know the Bible said uh
[13:33] uh I have good plans for you God has
[13:36] good plans for you to prosper you and to
[13:40] strengthen you uh especially uh when we
[13:44] are completely and totally surrendered
[13:48] our our lives are laid down for the sake
[13:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ and so in those
[13:55] times when facts
[13:58] contradict Spirit revealed Faith what
[14:00] are you going to go with what the facts
[14:02] say or what God's word has said I I
[14:05] think if I were you every time I would
[14:08] choose God's word and that's why we need
[14:11] that Revelation because even the Bible
[14:14] can be like facts to us that we're not
[14:17] connected to but when the spirit reveals
[14:20] the word to us uh it becomes more than a
[14:23] fact it becomes a living reality one
[14:27] that we can hold on to when there seems
[14:30] to be no logical reason to keep holding
[14:32] on people get often times caught up in
[14:36] the facts here's a scripture that's a
[14:38] bit unusual in the book of 1 Timothy
[14:41] chap 1 and verse 4 it says neither give
[14:46] heed to fables and endless genealogies
[14:51] which minister questions rather than
[14:53] Godly edifying which is in faith so do
[14:58] and I'd like to read that in the
[15:00] complete Jewish Bible another version of
[15:03] the Bible it says have them stop
[15:06] devoting their attention to myths and
[15:09] NeverEnding genealogies these divert
[15:13] people to speculating instead of doing
[15:17] God's work which requires trust I think
[15:21] that Dr David Stern did an amazing job
[15:25] in his translation of that verse I like
[15:28] it so much I want to read it again is
[15:29] that okay have them stop devoting their
[15:33] attention to myths and NeverEnding
[15:37] genealogies these divert people to
[15:40] speculating instead of doing God's work
[15:44] which requires trust I'm amazed
[15:49] sometimes at how people get so caught up
[15:52] with all kinds of conspiracy theories
[15:55] and all kinds of ideas uh that people
[15:59] just get so obsessed with and and they
[16:02] spend all of their time digging and
[16:05] researching uh this Scandal and that
[16:08] conspiracy theory and that idea and that
[16:11] approach and they give their lives to
[16:14] those kinds of things it becomes such a
[16:17] diversion it becomes such a distraction
[16:21] and I like the way this is
[16:23] translated uh don't don't give yourself
[16:26] to those things there may be questions
[16:28] even in Scripture that that we can't
[16:31] completely understand on our own we cry
[16:34] out to God for more understanding and
[16:37] for Revelation but we're not going to be
[16:39] caught up in those things to the point
[16:42] of of doubting or to the point of being
[16:44] distracted we're going to continue to do
[16:47] God's work we're going to continue to
[16:50] trust him we're going to continue to
[16:52] believe that he is more than able to
[16:55] keep that which we have committed unto
[16:58] him against that day uh that's what
[17:00] we're going to have to do we're just
[17:02] absolutely going to have to do that I I
[17:05] hope you don't mind if I share uh
[17:08] another uh quotation here from a sermon
[17:11] of brother brandham that I love so
[17:13] deeply I I don't often do that here on
[17:16] the on the Eagle's cry but but I love it
[17:19] so much that I have to believe that
[17:22] somebody out there will love it as much
[17:24] as I do uh he is ministering he had this
[17:28] great gift god-given gift to be able to
[17:32] often discern the heart to know what the
[17:35] need was and God would use him uh in so
[17:39] many different ways sometimes God would
[17:42] even reveal to him someone's name and
[17:45] their doctor's name and what their
[17:48] disease was and how long they had
[17:50] suffered with it why would God do such a
[17:52] thing well it it really elevates the
[17:56] faith level in the room not only for the
[17:59] individual being prayed for but also for
[18:01] the whole corporate body when you see
[18:04] God personally dealing with someone um
[18:07] when you realize and recognize that God
[18:10] really does know your need he really
[18:14] knows your situation um it releases an
[18:18] anointing often times on your faith it
[18:20] just gets you know kicked up to another
[18:23] notch and I love hearing some of these
[18:26] prayer lines where brother would pray
[18:29] for people and there was a particular
[18:32] disturbance in this service uh during a
[18:35] time of prayer and he said it is a devil
[18:38] there's a devil here a demon spirit and
[18:41] I like this he said he knows his time
[18:44] has come and so in the service he was
[18:47] trying to cause a disturbance this evil
[18:50] spirit because he knew that God was
[18:53] about to deal with him once and for all
[18:56] and so uh brother Bram starts looking
[18:58] down and he he calls out a woman and he
[19:00] said you're extremely nervous aren't you
[19:03] lady just hysterically nervous I see you
[19:06] trying to do things and you just can't
[19:08] because you're so nervous you have a
[19:10] mental nervous condition uh and Satan is
[19:14] even told you you're going to lose your
[19:15] mind there may be someone watching this
[19:18] broadcast right now that Satan has told
[19:20] you the same thing you're just going to
[19:22] lose your mind and you feel overwhelmed
[19:26] with anxiety and you you almost believe
[19:29] what he says but brother random said but
[19:31] he lied to you lady and then he looks at
[19:34] another woman in the crowd he said that
[19:36] little lady sitting right there second
[19:38] one on the right she's also bothered
[19:40] with nervousness isn't that right lady
[19:43] and she answers and and he says to this
[19:46] which I really like this demon knows
[19:50] that if that woman will have way believe
[19:54] Jesus Christ the son of God and me his
[19:57] prophet that'll have to leave her now
[20:02] that is so contrary to what we've been
[20:05] taught about faith and and that's why so
[20:07] many people get this idea when they
[20:09] don't see their prayers answered when
[20:11] healing doesn't come as quickly as we'd
[20:14] like for it to come we think I don't
[20:16] have enough Faith what's wrong with my
[20:18] faith or or perhaps we pray for a loved
[20:21] one who is sick and eventually that
[20:24] loved one dies and we're so grieved and
[20:27] we torment ourselves with guilt and we
[20:30] get in in our minds I didn't have enough
[20:32] Faith oh if I would have just had enough
[20:35] Faith but I want you to know that
[20:37] sometimes that is not this the truth of
[20:40] the situation at all not the reality at
[20:44] all it's only our perception because
[20:47] often times according to what this man
[20:49] of God ministered to this woman if I can
[20:52] just get that woman to halfway believe
[20:55] it it's not it's not 100% Faith but but
[20:58] just trying to believe you know putting
[21:01] her faith in that right direction then
[21:04] that thing will have to leave her and
[21:07] then brother brandom says that demon in
[21:09] that's troubling this woman and the
[21:11] demon that's troubling that other woman
[21:13] they're calling out to one another for
[21:15] help because again they knew their time
[21:18] had come and they said uh he said
[21:22] they're trying to get help to accumulate
[21:25] unbelief but he has lost the battle you
[21:28] see unbelief Works similar to Faith in
[21:32] the sense that in a room a a demon
[21:37] Spirit can come in with accusation and
[21:40] and in a good spirit meeting where God
[21:42] is trying to have his way and a demon
[21:45] Spirit an evil spirit can come in with
[21:47] unbelief and with doubt and with
[21:50] accusation and that Spirit cries out to
[21:53] another spirit and and who cries out to
[21:55] another Spirit until uh until doubt and
[21:59] unbelief get stronger in the building
[22:02] than faith and that ought not to be we
[22:05] we ought to have authority over that in
[22:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[22:10] believe we do and all of a sudden
[22:12] brother brandom said faith is gathering
[22:15] and that is a a statement that I love so
[22:17] dearly because here the enemy was trying
[22:21] to accumulate unbelief he was trying to
[22:23] fill up the room with doubt and all of a
[22:26] sudden just by saying that it caused the
[22:29] Believers in the room to start pulling
[22:31] on the Lord oh Father oh God bring
[22:34] Deliverance to these women uh set these
[22:36] women free oh Father and just the faith
[22:40] pool the faith pull the pool of their
[22:44] faith caused Faith to gather in the room
[22:48] and in a in an atmosphere of gathered
[22:51] Faith anything can happen because Jesus
[22:55] steps in to an atmosphere of gathered
[22:59] faith and he comes down to begin to pray
[23:01] for that woman he tells her many things
[23:03] about her life that I won't even take
[23:05] your time to read right now but he ends
[23:08] up by saying I challenge you in the name
[23:11] of Jesus Christ you selfish ungodly
[23:15] Spirit to a duel of Faith now that's a
[23:18] powerful statement because this demon
[23:21] Spirit and the servant of the Lord the
[23:23] servant of the Lord challenges that
[23:25] Spirit to a duel of Faith see I showed
[23:28] you in the Book of James that even
[23:30] Devils even demon Spirits believe they
[23:33] believe and tremble the Bible said but
[23:36] their belief system is absolutely 100%
[23:42] uh intellectual it is a mental concept
[23:45] of believing but this servant of the
[23:48] Lord had more than a mental concept of
[23:51] Faith he had Spirit reveal Faith whose
[23:53] Faith do you think was going to win that
[23:55] evil spirit who believed that he could
[23:57] continue to trouble that woman or this
[24:00] servant of the Lord who had seen Jesus
[24:02] Christ the same yesterday today and
[24:05] forever proving himself time and time
[24:07] again see his faith was based on that I
[24:10] know whose Faith would win yours just
[24:13] like his if your faith is is assurance
[24:17] and Trust because you have seen because
[24:20] you know by Revelation that God is able
[24:24] to do exceedingly abundantly above
[24:27] anything which we could even ask or
[24:29] think your faith is going to win every
[24:30] time it will win every time that devil
[24:34] will not be able to stand against you so
[24:36] he challenges this demon Spirit to a
[24:39] duel of faith and then he says you're
[24:41] exposed come out of this woman in jesus'
[24:44] name and then he turns to the woman go
[24:47] in peace my daughter and may God be with
[24:49] you and bless you he didn't say let me
[24:52] get your name down so I can send it out
[24:53] in my newsletter let me snap a picture
[24:56] with you so I can promote my Ministry he
[24:58] just said go your way the Lord has made
[25:00] you whole I love that I know this was a
[25:04] special servant of the Lord but I want
[25:06] you to know you and I can operate in
[25:08] this kind of Faith Lord do it so anoint
[25:12] our faith in this moment Lord that we
[25:15] can believe you even for the impossible
[25:18] our faith can't rest in just the history
[25:21] of what God did 50 60 years ago our
[25:24] faith has to rest in the fact that he is
[25:27] the same Hebrews 13 and8 I quoted it
[25:30] just a moment ago he is the same
[25:33] yesterday today and forever brother
[25:35] brandham taught that even the Rapture
[25:38] the catching away of the saints of God
[25:40] is a revelation and it comes by faith
[25:43] God reveals this whole Rapture mystery
[25:47] because even in this moment we're being
[25:49] caught up in the spirit uh absolutely I
[25:52] believe in a physical catching away but
[25:54] I also believe that there's preparation
[25:57] going on in the bride right now to get
[25:59] us ready uh mentally spiritually it uh
[26:04] um on the inside there's a
[26:06] transformation or taking place even a
[26:08] Rapture taking place but it will
[26:11] culminate in the physical Gathering of
[26:14] the Saints of the most high God so I
[26:17] cannot overemphasize enough to you how
[26:20] desperately we need Revelation in our
[26:23] lives I think I just want to take this
[26:25] time now as we leave the program to
[26:28] today to pray for you again that God
[26:30] will give you some real Supernatural
[26:33] Revelation from his word father I thank
[26:36] you right now that you've given me this
[26:38] great privilege to minister into the
[26:41] lives and the homes of those who are
[26:43] watching this program right now we come
[26:46] to you in faith believing that you are
[26:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[26:52] knowing that if you ever healed the sick
[26:54] body when you were on this Earth nearly
[26:56] 2,000 years ago that that you can still
[26:59] heal the sick today if you ever raised a
[27:02] person from the dead and I know you did
[27:05] you are more than able to continue with
[27:07] resurrection power so I ask that you
[27:10] will pour down the holy spirit of God
[27:12] upon us until our belief our faith our
[27:15] mental concept of what we believe is so
[27:19] super anointed and so charged with the
[27:22] resurrection power of Jesus Christ that
[27:24] it becomes such a revelation that it
[27:27] holds us that it moves us and that we go
[27:31] forward in that Faith to do great things
[27:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[27:36] pray God bless you thank you for
[27:39] watching the Eagles cry tune in again
