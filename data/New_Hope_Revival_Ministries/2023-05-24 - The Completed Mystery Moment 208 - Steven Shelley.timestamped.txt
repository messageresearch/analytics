[0:07] we have to say there's something yet in
[0:10] that mystery of God that has not yet
[0:13] been completely made known
[0:16] now I believe a portion of that is what
[0:18] I have just quoted to you a moment ago
[0:20] that that the mystery of God is revealed
[0:24] in Christ
[0:26] Christ is the mystery of God
[0:29] and I believe that a portion of the rest
[0:32] of that that the mystery of Christ is
[0:37] revealed in the bride or the bride is
[0:40] the revealing of the mystery of Christ I
[0:42] think that's a key
[0:44] to see this mystery finished
[0:49] let me see if you heard what I'm saying
[0:51] I think that this is a part it's you
[0:55] being able to identify your position in
[0:59] this equation
[1:01] you see there's no doubt in my mind that
[1:04] brother Branham helped us to see clearly
[1:06] that Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:10] is Jesus of the new
[1:12] but now I want to ask you who are you
[1:17] who are you
[1:19] brother Brandon asked us at the end of
[1:22] his ministry several times from
[1:25] scripture
[1:26] what house will you build me
[1:30] right one of the last messages what
[1:34] house will you build me so now Christ is
[1:38] looking for a place to live
[1:40] now the church at large teaches that
[1:42] Christ comes to live in US
[1:45] and that's not a great great Revelation
[1:47] there but what is great and what is
[1:50] powerful and what is missing in this
[1:53] hour is he doesn't just come to live in
[1:55] us to make us feel warm and fuzzy
[1:59] he comes to live in us because he wants
[2:01] to burst out of us doing the same things
[2:05] that he did while he was on planet Earth
[2:08] and so he wants to he wants to raise the
[2:11] dead
[2:12] he wants to heal the sick
[2:16] he wants to manifest Deliverance through
[2:20] his bride
[2:22] and that is a fully adopted bride that's
[2:26] coming to maturity
[2:28] right and when she stands in the
[2:31] fullness of her maturity what will you
[2:34] have you will have a mystery of God
[2:36] completely finished
[2:41] a process
[2:43] from the logos
[2:46] remember how he talks about that
[2:48] Fountain of Light
[2:50] that bubbling Fountain of color
[2:53] and he said are you with me
[2:56] and he said out of that Fountain of
[2:59] Light Came to logos so that's the
[3:02] beginning of the mystery right there
[3:04] you see there was a time when God was
[3:06] not God
[3:09] somebody said God is eternal he's
[3:12] Eternal in spirit
[3:14] but not Eternal in office
[3:16] because in order for him to be God in
[3:19] office there has to be something created
[3:21] or something that can recognize who he
[3:24] is and worship him
[3:26] so in the very beginning it was just
[3:29] spirit and light God
[3:31] eternal
[3:32] you you can say father
[3:35] you can say the eternal spirit of the
[3:37] father but in order to manifest that he
[3:39] was the eternal spirit of the father he
[3:41] had to birth something
[3:43] he had to create something do you
[3:45] understand where I'm going so the
[3:47] mystery of God started before the
[3:51] foundation of the world
[3:53] and the Mystery of God will be finished
[3:56] at the end of the laodicean church age
[4:02] it took all
[4:07] seven Church ages
[4:09] for this mystery of God to be finished
[4:13] Paul was a part of it
[4:16] iranius and March and Luther and Wesley
[4:18] these
[4:19] were all apart in finishing the mystery
[4:23] of God
[4:24] one of these days it's going to be
[4:26] finished in you and it's not going to be
[4:29] you anymore but it's going to be he who
[4:31] is who has possessed you
[4:36] see the whole concept of demon
[4:37] possession is an end to type for
[4:39] something that's great and real and that
[4:42] is a people that are fully possessed by
[4:43] God
[4:45] you see that Old Demon is what he always
[4:47] is an imitator an impersonator and he
[4:52] tries to control people with evil
[4:54] but there's going to be a fully adopted
[4:57] manifested bride
[4:59] she will come forth in the last of the
[5:01] last days
[5:03] he will have the saith the Lord and
[5:06] without the saith the Lord Brother Adam
[5:08] said she will keep her peace
[5:11] she won't speak without no saith the
[5:13] Lord because she's going to be so fully
[5:16] surrendered to him
