[0:07] but according to the example of of Cain
[0:10] and Abel every one of us is given the
[0:13] commission to watch
[0:16] we're watching for one another
[0:18] not because one another is the enemy but
[0:21] because there's an enemy that wants to
[0:23] get in here
[0:24] I want to tell you tonight there's an
[0:26] enemy that wants to get in here and he
[0:29] wants to sit here
[0:30] he wants to be with don't you start
[0:32] thinking about people
[0:34] this isn't people it wasn't a person
[0:36] that invaded the garden
[0:39] it wasn't a serpent that invaded the
[0:41] garden he was created to live there
[0:44] it was a fallen angel in spirit form a
[0:48] spirit
[0:50] that was able to press himself
[0:53] into a human flesh and it happens again
[0:56] and again and again and again a spirit
[1:00] will take a hold of you when you're not
[1:03] mixing your faith personally with the
[1:06] word I need some help now a spirit will
[1:10] take a hold of you it's one thing for a
[1:12] spirit to whisper to you and you swat
[1:14] him up against the wall but if you give
[1:16] him a place to see it
[1:19] if you pull up a chair and entertain him
[1:22] more than once he will take advantage of
[1:25] your spiritual Garden
[1:27] it's only by discernment sometime it's
[1:29] only by spirit that we can really
[1:32] recognize that the enemy is not just
[1:35] putting a passing thought in our mind he
[1:37] intends to occupy the processes of our
[1:41] thinking
[1:43] to stay low stay left to build up
[1:47] for years to
[1:49] years because ours to stay long enough
[1:51] to create in us a stronghold that will
[1:54] keep us out of all the benefits that God
[1:57] is pouring out all around us you got to
[2:00] keep putting yourself in and every time
[2:02] Satan comes to try to disqualify you you
[2:04] just understand that your qualification
[2:07] your calling your commissioning didn't
[2:09] come from Darkness
[2:11] it came from the light
[2:14] Hallelujah the devil didn't put you in
[2:17] the garden and the devil can't take you
[2:19] out of the garden
[2:20] but he can invade the garden if you're
[2:23] not watching the games
[2:26] God could no longer trust Adam
[2:32] to guard the gate
[2:35] so he had to put cherubims there
[2:38] and a flaming sword that turned in all
[2:41] direction that speaks to you and I of
[2:44] the two-edged sword of the word
[2:47] Adam was no longer trustable in his
[2:50] condition
[2:53] so God said I'll put something there
[2:55] that I can trust
[2:57] a part of me
[2:59] in the beginning
[3:01] what's the
[3:03] word and the Word was with God and the
[3:06] Word was God when God positioned that
[3:10] flaming sword at the gate
[3:13] of the Guard Eastgate
[3:15] of the garden
[3:18] when God did that he was positioning a
[3:20] placing of a part of who he was there it
[3:24] was there to keep the enemy
[3:27] from sabotaging the purposes of God
[3:32] and disturbing the rest
[3:35] in the garden
[3:37] You Know The Enemy can't take your
[3:39] garden
[3:41] unless you let him in
