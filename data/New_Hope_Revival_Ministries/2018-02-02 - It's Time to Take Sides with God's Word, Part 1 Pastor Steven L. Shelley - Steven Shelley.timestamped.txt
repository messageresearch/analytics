[0:10] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:14] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:17] the realm of the Spirit
[0:19] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:37] is surrendering our mind to the water
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right at Christ
[0:43] in you the hope of war
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] we want to welcome you to the program
[1:03] today I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from
[1:06] New Hope revival ministries and I'm here
[1:09] representing the gospel channel and
[1:11] brother Eric Erickson we're just so
[1:13] delighted to have you with us this
[1:14] evening and I pray that something will
[1:17] be said that will speak to your heart
[1:19] encourage you to keep on keepin on to
[1:23] serve the Lord Jesus Christ with all of
[1:25] your strength and with all of your might
[1:27] we know by the Word of God that we're
[1:30] living in the end times it's a confusing
[1:33] time for many many people but for the
[1:35] children of God we shouldn't be confused
[1:38] these are the days that we have looked
[1:40] for the scriptures are coming to pass
[1:43] before our very eyes and we want to know
[1:46] that we are living in the center of
[1:49] God's perfect will I don't know about
[1:51] you but I believe with all my heart that
[1:53] this life is not all there is I believe
[1:57] there's an eternity and I believe that
[1:59] one of these days we're going to step
[2:01] across into that land of eternity to
[2:03] live with the Lord for ever and ever
[2:06] some will go by the way of the grave
[2:09] death will claim this body but I believe
[2:13] that there will be those who are alive
[2:15] and remain at the time of the coming of
[2:18] the Lord and the scripture tells us in
[2:21] Thessalonians that will be changed in a
[2:24] moment at the culmination of that great
[2:27] event that the Scriptures have foretold
[2:30] and those which have died in Christ will
[2:33] rise first and we which are alive and
[2:35] remain will be caught up together to
[2:37] meet them in the air I believe that is
[2:40] the resurrection of the bride of Jesus
[2:42] Christ and I'm looking forward to that
[2:45] in fact I'm planning today for that
[2:48] event
[2:49] whenever it may come somebody said well
[2:52] I've heard all my life that the Lord is
[2:55] coming Jesus is coming well I want you
[2:57] to know he is coming it may not be in
[3:00] all of our lifetime but he is coming
[3:03] again and I can say by the scripture and
[3:06] by the news pay
[3:07] for that we are closer to the coming of
[3:09] the Lord today than we certainly were
[3:12] say 5 years ago 10 years ago yes my
[3:16] grandmother and my great-grandmother
[3:18] looked for the coming of the Lord
[3:20] but that doesn't discourage me from
[3:22] continuing to look for his coming I'm
[3:25] thankful for the gospel channel I'm
[3:28] thankful for another way to minister to
[3:32] reach out to find those who are hurting
[3:35] those who are discouraged maybe even
[3:37] those who do not know the Lord Jesus as
[3:40] your personal Savior while while Mercy
[3:43] is still being extended and while we
[3:45] have time why don't you invite him into
[3:48] your life why don't you surrender your
[3:51] will and your way to the ways of God and
[3:55] I tell you it's not an easy life
[3:57] necessarily but it's the most glorious
[3:59] life
[4:00] that any person could live because we
[4:03] all face problems and we face sickness
[4:06] and we face difficulties but it's only
[4:08] those who know the Lord Jesus who really
[4:11] have somebody to help them when they get
[4:14] in those situations I want you to know
[4:17] he's a healer I've seen God heal just
[4:20] about any condition or disease that
[4:23] would come to your mind and he is still
[4:26] a healer he is Jesus Christ the same
[4:30] yesterday and today and forever
[4:34] so I for one am very grateful to brother
[4:37] Eric Erickson and the gospel channel for
[4:40] the work that they have been doing for
[4:42] the Lord for so very long now and I'm
[4:45] especially thankful that we get to
[4:47] partner with them and speak to you today
[4:50] you know we've just entered into a new
[4:53] year a little while back and I believe
[4:56] that it's going to be a good year
[4:58] because really in a year when we're
[5:01] serving the Lord is a good year they're
[5:04] going to be things that are hard to deal
[5:06] with we're going to meet some obstacles
[5:09] and some hindrances on the way I'm sure
[5:11] of that but I know that as we get closer
[5:15] and closer to the coming of the Lord
[5:18] God's going to do a glow
[5:20] work in his people it's the promise of
[5:23] the scripture I could say that prophets
[5:26] and sages for hundreds of years have
[5:29] been looking for that generation just
[5:33] before the coming of the Lord
[5:35] that would walk in the fullness of who
[5:38] God has called us to be sometimes people
[5:42] refer to it as the sons of God the
[5:45] manifestation of the sons of God because
[5:47] the scripture says that all of creation
[5:50] groaneth for the manifestation of the
[5:54] sons of God
[5:55] and I realized that through the years
[5:57] some of these scriptural thoughts have
[5:59] been taken to the excess you can't take
[6:03] any portion of Scripture and interpret
[6:06] it by itself it has to lay in the
[6:10] continuity of the word remember the
[6:12] Bible said line upon line and precept
[6:16] upon precept its foundation first secure
[6:21] strong stable and then we're building on
[6:25] that foundation I don't believe that
[6:27] Scripture contradicts Scripture I
[6:30] believe that if there's a contradiction
[6:32] it's because we're somehow either
[6:35] misinterpreting the scripture or miss
[6:38] applying it I believe one of the
[6:40] mistakes that people make today in
[6:42] seeking to explain God's Word is by
[6:46] trying to do it with a carnal mind the
[6:49] Bible tells us that the carnal mind is
[6:51] actually enmity with God or an enemy at
[6:56] conflict with God that's why we must be
[7:00] renewed our minds must be renewed daily
[7:04] I say more than daily all through the
[7:08] day sometimes I have to say lord help me
[7:11] right now with my thoughts I want to
[7:14] think the thoughts that are true and
[7:16] lovely and pure that have virtue I want
[7:20] to stop the voice of the enemy when when
[7:24] he comes to say well that's not going to
[7:27] work and that's going to be a flop and
[7:29] that's going to be a failure you see I
[7:31] never had an M
[7:32] Bishan to do television of any sort or
[7:35] any kind but the Lord laid the burden on
[7:38] our heart he prophesied through multiple
[7:42] people that the day would come
[7:44] that we would have this open door and
[7:46] sure enough because God keeps his word
[7:49] the doors begin to open and so we
[7:53] stepped in feeling very inadequate very
[7:56] insufficient looking at some of
[7:59] Christian television today how eloquent
[8:03] and anointed many people are and feeling
[8:07] like well we could never measure up to
[8:09] that but if I would listen to the enemy
[8:11] and believe everything that he says I
[8:14] would be paralyzed by fear I would never
[8:17] do anything for the Lord I would let the
[8:20] fear of failure keep me from even
[8:22] stepping out I want to encourage you in
[8:25] this new year not to let the fear of
[8:28] failure keep you from doing something in
[8:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[8:35] Bible tells us that everything we do we
[8:38] should do in that lovely precious and
[8:41] set-apart name and that means we're
[8:44] doing it unto the name we're doing it
[8:47] unto the glory of God and so really when
[8:52] we stepped into this role it was up to
[8:54] the Lord whether we stood or whether we
[8:57] fall whether we failed or whether we
[8:59] succeeded his strength is actually made
[9:03] perfect in our weakness when we feel
[9:06] that we do not have the strength to
[9:08] continue to carry on in his name he is
[9:11] as close as the mention of his name I
[9:15] don't know why I feel like saying this
[9:17] right now but I feel like mentioning to
[9:20] you the important aspect of praise when
[9:25] we praise the Lord when we sanctify our
[9:29] thoughts and we place them upon the
[9:31] goodness of God and we begin to speak
[9:35] his praise I tell you I don't know if
[9:39] you what you would think about me if you
[9:41] worked near my desk if you work down the
[9:45] hall for me
[9:46] like my son does there are times that my
[9:49] mind is is you know bogged down with
[9:53] responsibilities and having several
[9:56] things that needed to be done yesterday
[9:58] while trying to figure out what to do
[10:00] today which one of them should be the
[10:03] priority for today while already feeling
[10:06] like I missed the deadline and all of a
[10:08] sudden I just start praising the Lord
[10:11] right out loud father I just thank you
[10:13] that you have got everything under
[10:15] control you're a good good father you
[10:19] never make a mistake
[10:21] I just thank you for for your good care
[10:24] for me thank you for providing for my
[10:27] family thank you for the food that you
[10:30] give me in the clothing that you provide
[10:32] you know I tell you you you just start
[10:35] tracing him and thanking him his
[10:37] presence draws near and the list just
[10:40] gets longer and longer of things that
[10:42] you would like to praise him for it has
[10:45] a profound effect on your mindset your
[10:48] attitude what you do then the rest of
[10:51] the day and how you feel scientists have
[10:54] even proven that thinking thoughts of
[10:57] gratitude can absolutely have a chemical
[11:01] reaction in the body that's healthy it's
[11:04] a rewiring of the brain that we
[11:07] desperately need in an hour where we're
[11:10] bombarded with so many things that tend
[11:14] to bog the thinking process down so we
[11:17] not only get the profound spiritual
[11:20] benefit of connecting with our Creator
[11:23] and giving him some of the praise that's
[11:25] due his name but we also have a
[11:28] wonderful effect that takes place in our
[11:31] physical body and who out there couldn't
[11:34] use some help in their health I believe
[11:38] that God wants to to give us everything
[11:41] that we have need of and we just have to
[11:43] position ourselves according to the Word
[11:46] of God to be able to receive what the
[11:49] Lord has you know when I was seeking the
[11:52] Lord about this new year one of the
[11:55] things that that he spoke into my spirit
[11:57] was that
[11:59] this was a year to take sides with the
[12:02] Word of God
[12:04] we're living in an hour where this
[12:06] generation even universally they they so
[12:10] often desire not to take a side over the
[12:15] other you know they don't want to take
[12:17] one position over another position and
[12:20] we just all need to get along and we
[12:22] just all need to be tolerant and I
[12:25] understand the concept of tolerance I
[12:28] understand the concept of peace and I
[12:31] understand that it's much better for us
[12:34] to get along in love than to constantly
[12:38] war with one another but I also believe
[12:41] that there are certain truths that we
[12:44] cannot compromise on the sovereignty of
[12:49] God the infallibility of the scripture
[12:53] the sanctity of human life marriage as
[12:57] God has defined it in his word standing
[13:01] in alignment with the nation of Israel
[13:04] these are some of the principles that I
[13:07] feel are so very very important
[13:11] I believe understanding the simplicity
[13:14] of the Godhead based on the scripture is
[13:17] important I believe having understanding
[13:21] and having the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:24] is very very important in the in the
[13:27] perilous days in which we live I believe
[13:31] that there are giftings of the spirit
[13:33] that were given to the early church but
[13:36] are still in effect today I believe that
[13:39] God still desires to speak to his
[13:42] children
[13:43] I believe in visions I believe in dreams
[13:46] I believe that God is still leading his
[13:49] people in a supernatural way why do you
[13:52] believe that preacher because I read it
[13:55] in God's Word and it's time to take
[13:58] sides with God's Word when the scripture
[14:02] is silent maybe we should just be silent
[14:05] but when the scripture speaks we should
[14:08] not be afraid to say what the book
[14:11] says and not as a hypocrite not as one
[14:16] who has an answer for everything
[14:18] but cannot find the strength to live
[14:20] anything you see if you don't stand for
[14:23] something you'll fall for anything if
[14:26] you're gonna make your stand in this new
[14:29] year make your stand for the Word of God
[14:32] take sides with Jesus Christ recognize
[14:36] from the scripture that there are not
[14:39] thousands of ways to God there are not
[14:42] hundreds of ways to God in fact there
[14:46] are not ten ways to God
[14:48] or even two there's only one way to God
[14:53] the true God the God of the Bible the
[14:57] Bible call Jehovah we know that there is
[15:03] no name in scripture big enough to
[15:06] contain the fullness of who he is
[15:09] even our Jewish friends because they
[15:12] want to keep the sanctity of the name of
[15:14] God often refer to him as Hashem the
[15:18] name what words are big enough to
[15:22] describe who he is and how he works how
[15:26] he interacts in the hearts and lives of
[15:30] men and women alive today and how he has
[15:33] moved in the lives of people throughout
[15:36] history he's bigger than the world the
[15:40] world cannot contain him and we need to
[15:42] understand that it's not our choice we
[15:46] try to figure out which of these
[15:49] directions is for us there's only one
[15:52] way Jesus said I am the way the truth
[15:57] and the life and no man cometh to the
[16:01] Father except he come through me and I
[16:04] believe that with every fiber of my
[16:06] being if you believe that say man
[16:09] because it's nothing but the truth it's
[16:12] only by Jesus Yeshua our Messiah that we
[16:15] have access to God and it's only by
[16:19] inviting the Lord Jesus into our life
[16:22] that we can actually enter in
[16:24] to the relationship that we need with
[16:27] God our Creator so you find out what the
[16:31] Word of God says and in this year of
[16:34] your life determined that you're going
[16:36] to stand for the word I'm not
[16:38] encouraging you to be mean or hostile or
[16:41] rude judgmental or critical to someone
[16:45] who doesn't see the Word of God as you
[16:47] do in fact I'm talking about a personal
[16:50] stand I'm talking about making a stand
[16:53] as an individual I am going to take
[16:57] sides with Jesus Christ I'm not going to
[17:00] bite my tongue when I'm asked about who
[17:03] I am and who I am who I serve who I
[17:07] belong to I'm going to speak in love but
[17:10] I'm going to speak I think it's very
[17:13] important because we're certainly
[17:16] nearing the end of time as we have come
[17:20] to know it we have families that need
[17:22] the salvation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:25] they need they need his help and his
[17:29] strength and I want you to know the only
[17:33] way we're going to bring them to Jesus
[17:35] is to live the Jesus life in front of
[17:39] them many many people around the world
[17:41] have had their belly full of religion
[17:45] but they have never seen enough of what
[17:48] it means when someone has a true
[17:52] relationship with Jesus Christ
[17:55] then it's not about religion it's about
[17:59] relationship it's about knowing God when
[18:02] the Spirit of the Lord began to speak to
[18:04] us about this being a year to take sides
[18:09] with the word he had spoken to us
[18:12] earlier about entering into a season
[18:16] concerning the Word of God that we
[18:18] needed to take God at His Word if he
[18:22] said it that settles it we used to say
[18:26] in the church when I was a boy if God
[18:28] says it I believe it that settles it but
[18:32] the truth is whether you believe it or
[18:35] not whether I believe it or not if
[18:38] God said it it is forever settled it is
[18:42] so then why isn't it important why is it
[18:46] important for me to believe God if God
[18:50] says it why is it important for me to
[18:54] believe it it's important for me to
[18:56] believe it because my faith activates
[18:59] the Word of God in my life
[19:02] it takes a word that was given to a
[19:06] tremendous amount of people a very
[19:09] general Word of God
[19:11] whosoever whosoever would call upon the
[19:15] name of the Lord the Bible tells us that
[19:18] God so loved the world this is such a
[19:21] huge blanket of God's love to all
[19:25] mankind and it takes that huge blanket
[19:29] of God's Word and makes it very very
[19:31] personal when I believe it when I
[19:34] believe it as an individual it activates
[19:38] that word of God in my life that means
[19:42] that I can take God at His Word and
[19:45] every promise in the book God's book
[19:50] God's Word becomes my promise what about
[19:54] that I mean that's pretty exciting that
[19:57] what God has said that he wants to do I
[20:00] now by faith connect with that word and
[20:04] I know by revelation because faith
[20:08] unlocks the Spirit of God to bring
[20:12] revelation into your life from the word
[20:15] and by that revelation I now know that
[20:18] it's my promise
[20:21] it's my inheritance it's for me and I
[20:26] can believe it and I can hold on to it
[20:28] and I can see it become a reality
[20:31] because God said it that settles it let
[20:35] me read a verse of scripture to you
[20:37] today John chapter 8 verses 31 and 32
[20:42] then said Jesus to those Jews which
[20:45] believed on him if ye continue
[20:49] you in my word then are you my disciples
[20:53] indeed and ye shall know the truth and
[20:58] the truth shall make you free the truth
[21:05] of God's Word if you continue in the
[21:08] word you will know the truth and the
[21:13] truth will make you free or make you
[21:19] freedom
[21:20] you become freedom I'll tell you that's
[21:26] a wonderful promise from God's Word it
[21:29] means that nothing of this world can
[21:33] bind me if I continue in God's Word his
[21:38] word
[21:39] therefore continues in me making me
[21:44] freedom hallelujah
[21:47] you see I am freedom not because I've
[21:51] done something good in my own self
[21:54] but because I have believed on the Word
[21:57] of God I have made a conscious decision
[22:00] to continue in the word that word
[22:05] continue in the Greek means to stay in a
[22:10] given place to abide it also means that
[22:15] we should that you would stay in a state
[22:19] or in an expectancy it also means to
[22:24] dwell to remain or to be present so that
[22:30] word continue when the scripture says in
[22:33] the King James Version if you continue
[22:36] in my word it means if we choose to stay
[22:41] in a state of expectancy concerning the
[22:47] Word of God concerning the truth of
[22:50] God's Word again a conscious decision if
[22:54] there's one thing I want to get across
[22:56] to you as we study the Scriptures
[22:58] together from time to time it is
[23:02] that God wants to take this word and
[23:05] make it personal he wants to make it a
[23:09] reality in your life again it's not a
[23:12] dead dry history book or a record of
[23:17] what God was but rather it's a book that
[23:21] becomes a foundation and if we build our
[23:25] lives on that foundation as we learn
[23:28] some time ago it's like the man who
[23:30] built this house on a rock if your life
[23:33] is built on Jesus Christ if your life is
[23:37] founded and built on the Word of God
[23:40] then no matter how the winds howl or the
[23:44] storms blow or the rain comes crashing
[23:48] down that house your house a house for
[23:52] God will stand the Word of God must not
[23:57] be looked at as as something that cannot
[24:00] be made personal we must allow the Holy
[24:04] Spirit of God to take this word and make
[24:07] it personal to us one man of God said it
[24:10] like this we've got to see ourselves in
[24:13] the word and I think one of the examples
[24:17] that people often use they say well put
[24:20] your name in the word if you if you
[24:22] can't just read it and see yourself in
[24:26] it put your name in there and one of the
[24:28] examples they use is for God so loved
[24:31] the world that's broad but what if I
[24:34] should say for God so loved Stephen L
[24:39] Shelley that's me that makes it personal
[24:43] so I'm reading my name in God's Word
[24:47] someone said oh I I don't know if that's
[24:49] theologically sound it's absolutely
[24:53] theologically sound it's the only way to
[24:57] make God's Word personal in your life
[24:59] what's the benefit of making God's Word
[25:02] personal that's continuing in the word
[25:05] to make it personal to let the Spirit of
[25:08] God reveal it to you to study the word
[25:11] to take sides with the word all of these
[25:15] all of these
[25:16] Russians all of these things that we
[25:19] have mentioned concerning the word
[25:21] taking God at His Word all of these
[25:24] things could be defined as continuing in
[25:28] the word and here's the benefit if you
[25:31] continue in my word if you stay in that
[25:34] state of expectancy you're going to know
[25:37] that you're my disciples indeed and
[25:39] you're going to know the truth
[25:42] the truth is not a book the truth is not
[25:46] a church the truth is not a doctrine
[25:50] what is the truth or should I ask who is
[25:55] the truth because the truth is a person
[25:58] his name is the Lord Jesus Christ again
[26:03] he said I am the way the truth the life
[26:08] I want to know the truth and in knowing
[26:12] the truth in being intimately acquainted
[26:16] with the truth then I can be made
[26:20] freedom hallelujah and living in that
[26:24] state of freedom there is no bondage
[26:27] there is no addiction there is no
[26:30] oppression that can attach itself to my
[26:34] life if it comes as an attack the living
[26:38] word of God in me that has made me
[26:40] freedom will quickly identify the
[26:43] bullets the arrows that the enemy is
[26:46] using against me and we pull those down
[26:49] in the authority of Jesus Christ and we
[26:52] continue abiding in the word or in the
[26:55] vine who is the vine well Jesus said in
[26:59] John 15 he is the vine and we are the
[27:02] branches how many of you are happy about
[27:05] being grafted your you're a part of that
[27:08] vine let's say connected I'm so thankful
[27:12] to be connected in fact the branches of
[27:16] a vine have the same SAP running through
[27:20] them that the that the vine itself has
[27:23] that means that the same life that is in
[27:26] the vine Jesus Christ is the same
[27:30] life that is in me now in this
[27:33] born-again experience the life the same
[27:37] life oh my that is so very powerful
[27:42] because that means that whatever the
[27:44] vine accomplishes the branches could
[27:47] also accomplish so any good that I do
[27:50] any any good deed that I do any any work
[27:55] that I do for God it's not me
[27:58] accomplishing it it's not my earthly
[28:00] life doing any good but it's him it's
[28:04] his life
[28:05] it's Jesus doing his work through me no
[28:10] wonder he said greater works than this
[28:12] shall you do when I go to my father if I
[28:16] go away then I'm going to come again to
[28:19] you one other scripture said I'm going
[28:22] to send another comforter to you aren't
[28:25] you glad he abides have you ever sung
[28:27] that old hymn he abides I'm rejoicing
[28:30] night and day as I walk the narrow way
[28:33] the comforter abides not only with me
[28:38] what else he abides in me Oh hallelujah
[28:43] let me read this verse these two verses
[28:46] of scripture to you in the amplified
[28:49] bible i still do a lot of my reading and
[28:52] preaching from the King James Version of
[28:55] the Bible I do indeed but I also very
[28:58] much like to read scriptures in the
[29:01] amplified perhaps you might find a
[29:03] parallel Bible it's a wonderful tool to
[29:06] have where you can have the version the
[29:09] King James Version and perhaps the
[29:12] Amplified Bible next to it or maybe the
[29:15] new American Standard just don't get too
[29:18] carried away with a with a modern
[29:21] version that waters down the truth of
[29:24] the scripture I don't want you to do
[29:26] that and if you ever get in a place
[29:28] where you're not sure then there are so
[29:31] many tools out there to look up the
[29:33] original meaning of the original
[29:35] language when you start looking at the
[29:38] meaning
[29:39] the original words that were used it
[29:41] just amplifies and that's one of the
[29:44] reasons why I like the amplified it says
[29:47] in John 8:31 32 amplified so Jesus said
[29:52] to those Jews who had believed in him if
[29:55] you abide in my word and that in
[29:59] brackets hold fast to my teachings and
[30:03] live in accordance with them hallelujah
[30:08] that's what it means to abide in the
[30:11] word continue in the word it means
[30:14] holdfast to the teachings of Jesus
[30:17] Christ and then live in accordance to
[30:21] them it's not optional for you and I we
[30:25] can't decide
[30:26] yay or nay yes I think I'll live by the
[30:29] word or no I don't I know it's true but
[30:32] I'm not going to live by it if we know
[30:34] it's true and we are indeed children of
[30:38] God then it becomes absolutely necessary
[30:41] that we live by what we know I think
[30:45] that's a very important truth to walk in
[30:47] in this new year is that we would not
[30:50] just call him Lord but we would let him
[30:54] be Lord we would make him lord over
[30:57] every part of our lives I believe that
[31:00] your desire I do I believe there are
[31:03] many people who will see this program
[31:05] and your desire is that Jesus would rule
[31:09] and reign over your life he doesn't do
[31:13] that externally he doesn't do that from
[31:17] from billions of light-years away in a
[31:20] place called heaven Jesus wants to rule
[31:23] and reign over your life from within
[31:28] allow him to do sit on the throne of
[31:31] your spirit that Ark of the Covenant
[31:35] that we study when we study the
[31:38] tabernacle of Moses that the outer court
[31:41] and the holy place and the Holy of
[31:43] Holies the inside of the inside the Holy
[31:47] of Holies is in your spirit that's where
[31:51] Jesus
[31:52] desires to make his throne and he wants
[31:55] to rule through the dimension of your
[31:58] soul and through the dimension of your
[32:00] body your flesh but he wants to do it
[32:05] internally from the inside of the inside
[32:09] that's how the Word of God can make you
[32:11] freedom it's because he he recreates
[32:15] from the inside out oh my what a
[32:18] wonderful life what a wonderful life we
[32:21] can have if we can not only know this
[32:25] truth but constantly remind ourselves
[32:29] when things aren't going so good that's
[32:32] a good time to remember but Jesus you're
[32:35] on the throne of my spirit and I'm gonna
[32:38] listen carefully for your voice for your
[32:41] direction for your leadership because I
[32:44] know that if I do it by myself
[32:46] I'm gonna make a big ol mess a big
[32:50] genuine mess that's what I do when I
[32:53] call the shots but when I listen for the
[32:57] still small voice of the Spirit of God
[33:00] within his life in me then I know the
[33:06] will of God and I can do the will of God
[33:09] because once the will of God is revealed
[33:11] to us from the inner man from the inside
[33:16] of the inside the grace is automatically
[33:20] available once we understand the
[33:23] leadership of the Lord from the realm of
[33:26] the Spirit the grace is already there
[33:30] the grace is already in our account to
[33:33] do what God is leading us to do to do
[33:37] what Jesus is directing us to do from
[33:40] the inside of the inside I hope that my
[33:44] terminology or vocabulary doesn't
[33:47] confuse you or make this sound more
[33:50] complicated than I want it to be because
[33:53] it's not that complicated in fact I
[33:56] think the church world has done a pretty
[33:58] good job at making it complicated I
[34:01] don't want to do that
[34:03] I want to make it simple enough that you
[34:06] can understand we're a triune being body
[34:10] soul and spirit as the New Testament
[34:12] teaches you can you can conform to God's
[34:16] Word with your body you know you can go
[34:19] to church you can take communion you can
[34:22] read your Bible you can treat your
[34:24] neighbor good and still not have Jesus
[34:28] ruling and reigning from the inside of
[34:31] the inside you can from the realm of a
[34:35] soul which is the mind the will and the
[34:37] emotions you can determine emotionally
[34:40] I'm going to serve the Lord as a
[34:42] Christian I'm going to I'm going to be
[34:44] identified with Jesus Christ but if you
[34:48] do it from the body by believing your
[34:51] behavior your actions are what matter
[34:54] the most or if you do it from the realm
[34:57] of the soul believing perhaps that your
[35:00] your emotions are what's going to
[35:02] strengthen you when the battle gets
[35:04] tough it's not going to stand when
[35:08] circumstances get rocky or stormy the
[35:11] only way to be able to stand for Jesus
[35:14] Christ in the perilous days that we live
[35:17] in now is to understand salvation
[35:20] Redemption from the inside out
[35:23] from the spirit man all the way through
[35:27] the mind the will and the emotions and
[35:29] all the way through to the body you see
[35:32] my hands were given to me as a gift from
[35:35] God to help my neighbor and to serve the
[35:37] Lord my eyes were made to see God's Word
[35:41] to read it he gave me a brain to help
[35:44] understand a spirit a mind to help
[35:47] understand the Word of God and so if we
[35:51] look at some of these external my feet
[35:53] we sing a song of when I was a boy we
[35:56] son this beautiful song and I still sing
[35:59] at some time I was born to serve the
[36:01] Lord my hands were made to help my
[36:04] neighbor my eyes were made to read God's
[36:06] Word my feet were made to walk in his
[36:09] footsteps
[36:10] my body is the temple of the Lord but we
[36:13] can't serve Him with our body only it
[36:15] has to come
[36:16] from the inside of the inside and it
[36:19] translates itself into good works the
[36:23] Spirit of God Jesus living in my spirit
[36:26] affects my emotion it affects that realm
[36:30] of the soul my mind my will and my
[36:32] emotions and then his life keeps
[36:35] transcending it keeps coming forward
[36:37] even into the body and so I want to do
[36:40] the things that please God it's not from
[36:43] the outside in it's from the inside out
[36:47] otherwise we can be whited Sepulcher the
[36:52] Bible tells us Jesus said we can be very
[36:56] beautifully decorated tombs on the
[37:00] outside but on the inside still full of
[37:04] dead men's bones because the
[37:07] transformation has to take place on the
[37:10] inside first
[37:11] and then work its way to the outside let
[37:15] me get back to my subject okay
[37:17] he said if you abide in me hold fast or
[37:20] in abide in my word hold fast to my
[37:23] teachings and live in accordance with
[37:26] them you are truly my disciples and you
[37:30] will know the truth and the truth in
[37:33] amplified it says will set you free so
[37:39] you're going to be set free and then by
[37:42] the revelation of his word
[37:44] you're transformed into freedom made
[37:47] freedom it's such a state of being free
[37:52] that nothing that is bound nothing that
[37:56] is not free can abide it can't stay very
[37:59] long
[38:00] it has to be moved out and again that's
[38:04] the work of the Holy Spirit to help us
[38:06] to do that when we read these beautiful
[38:09] promises I'm going to be set free
[38:11] there's going to be no bondage in my
[38:13] life sometimes we wonder well I believe
[38:16] it's true why doesn't it work in me why
[38:20] doesn't that word of God perform in my
[38:23] life what it says
[38:25] it comes to perform for instance we read
[38:29] in the New Testament that we have been
[38:31] made more than conquerors through Jesus
[38:34] Christ who strengthens us what about the
[38:37] fact that we don't always conquer what
[38:41] about the fact that sometimes we we are
[38:44] conquered by circumstances by thought
[38:48] paradigms etc habits that we want to
[38:52] break but instead of us conquering them
[38:54] they seem to conquer us does that mean
[38:58] that God's Word doesn't work does that
[39:01] mean that it only works for some what
[39:04] does that mean I guess it could be so
[39:07] discouraging if you didn't have the
[39:10] understanding of Scripture you just give
[39:12] up and say well it may work for you
[39:14] granny but it doesn't work for me well
[39:17] there's some truths that we need to
[39:19] understand about how to help God's Word
[39:23] to be effective in our lives and I don't
[39:26] mean that God needs our help but he does
[39:29] need our cooperation he does desire our
[39:33] yielded Ness and our surrender so one of
[39:37] the things we want to do if we want to
[39:40] be made free or freedom or set free or
[39:44] if we want to be made more than a
[39:47] conqueror through Jesus Christ one of
[39:50] the things we do is we continue in the
[39:53] word we abide in the word and we choose
[39:57] to live in a constant state of
[40:01] expectancy of faith if God said it that
[40:06] settles it when fear dread doubt
[40:10] whatever it is comes creeping in we just
[40:14] deal with that by taking it to the Word
[40:19] of God the scripture tells us that we
[40:22] are to take every thought captive so we
[40:25] take all of our thoughts and we bring
[40:28] them back to the word if they don't line
[40:31] up with God's Word we reject those
[40:34] thoughts if they are in continuity with
[40:37] God's Word
[40:38] something on the inside of us says amen
[40:41] amen amen amen
[40:42] and we continue to believe to embrace to
[40:46] reach forward and lay hold of the truth
[40:49] that God's Word is trying to speak to us
[40:53] one of the things I think we have to
[40:55] understand is that all truth comes in
[40:58] seed form when God begins to open up our
[41:03] lives with a truth from his word we
[41:07] don't always get the whole you know
[41:10] almost said I don't know if you know
[41:13] this expression or not but I almost said
[41:15] the whole kit and caboodle I hope you I
[41:19] hope you understand what I mean you you
[41:21] know you you another expression that we
[41:25] use in the South sometime you get the
[41:27] whole shebang it means you get the cart
[41:30] and the horse all at the same time well
[41:33] it doesn't work that way we don't we
[41:35] don't plant the seed in the morning and
[41:38] get the harvest in the evening there
[41:41] there's a cycle there's a season seed
[41:44] time and then growth there there has to
[41:48] be water applied to the seed there has
[41:52] to be something to fertilize if the soil
[41:55] is deficient there has to be fertilizer
[41:58] supplemented and you've got to weed out
[42:01] those chokers
[42:03] you've got to dig up those creepers that
[42:06] will come and try to wrap themselves
[42:09] around your harvest so you've got to use
[42:13] the hoe and you've got to be willing to
[42:16] pull the weeds and you've got to be
[42:17] willing to water the plant you've got to
[42:20] be willing to put a little a fertilizer
[42:22] on it when necessary and it has to get
[42:26] the right light etc so the seed is the
[42:30] word of God the Bible tells us that we
[42:33] hear it in the parables of Jesus Christ
[42:36] I love the way that Jesus taught in
[42:38] parables I like that some people think
[42:43] that he taught in parables because he
[42:46] wanted to to hide the truth but it's
[42:50] different it's not hiding the truth a
[42:52] parable conceals the truth in such a
[42:56] beautiful way to prepare our heart with
[42:59] expectation to receive the truth it's a
[43:02] very wonderful and effective way of
[43:05] teaching so the purpose of a parable was
[43:08] not to conceal the truth ultimately but
[43:11] to or to hide it just a bit until we get
[43:15] the understanding of the parable until
[43:17] we take the natural parable the natural
[43:19] story
[43:20] and compare it with the Word of God and
[43:22] with the spiritual and then we really
[43:25] see what it means like like the parable
[43:28] of the sower the seed was the Word of
[43:30] God but my look at all the things that
[43:33] begin to emerge to try to choke out the
[43:36] good Word of God in your field in your
[43:40] life well we have to be diligent we have
[43:43] to be fervent somebody said well you
[43:45] know rather Shelley that that sounds
[43:48] like work it is it is work but it's good
[43:52] work it's glorious work it's not all
[43:55] toil and sweat and labor and backache oh
[43:58] no sir there's great reward when we can
[44:03] look at areas of our life and see the
[44:06] Word of God beginning to flourish when I
[44:10] can see areas of my life let's say my
[44:13] field that were once planted with bad
[44:16] thoughts dark thoughts thoughts that
[44:19] would disqualify me thoughts that would
[44:21] make me feel insignificant or
[44:24] insufficient and now I look back over
[44:27] that place in my field in my garden and
[44:30] I see another plant growing in its place
[44:35] I see now instead of dark plantings I
[44:39] see green plantings a vibrant
[44:44] flourishing thoughts you see the Word of
[44:49] God is flourishing in areas of my life
[44:52] that were once very dark and dismal and
[44:57] when you see that happening in your own
[44:59] life yeah you get excited
[45:02] it's it's like I don't know if you if
[45:04] you care for gardening but I think a lot
[45:08] of you people do across the United
[45:10] Kingdom I think that a lot of people in
[45:13] the United Kingdom loved loved gardening
[45:16] and they loved their gardens and you
[45:19] know if you've ever planted something
[45:21] and and watched it grow it starts out as
[45:24] something so tiny and hard and you know
[45:27] it's easy to lose I don't know if you've
[45:30] ever been planting seed to only have a
[45:31] few and and drop one in the wrong place
[45:35] and you're trying to find it it seems so
[45:38] insignificant but when you see that
[45:40] thing beginning to grow and beginning to
[45:43] sprout and beginning to get strength and
[45:45] get taller it fills you if you if you
[45:48] care for gardening it fills you with a
[45:50] sense of accomplishment it works the
[45:53] same way in the spirit when we begin to
[45:55] see areas of our life that were once
[45:58] very unfruitful very barren certain
[46:03] certain painful places that we have it
[46:07] we've experienced in the past and it
[46:10] seems that the fruit that is produced
[46:14] from those dark painful experiences is
[46:17] rotten fruit it's it's darkness it's
[46:21] it's more pain but when we begin to
[46:24] learn the principles of God's Word and
[46:26] we pull out those those bad weeds those
[46:29] bad seed and get rid of all that and we
[46:33] begin to replace it with the truth of
[46:35] God's Word for today in our life and we
[46:39] see that beginning to take over and
[46:40] spread a little bit it gives us a sense
[46:44] of accomplishment even though we know
[46:46] it's not what we have accomplished but
[46:49] it's what His Word is accomplishing in
[46:52] us so yes there's some toil involved I
[46:56] think one of the main things that I
[46:58] would say is consistency is is required
[47:02] to be persistent to be willing to keep
[47:06] coming back and abiding in that state of
[47:10] expectancy that what God said it may not
[47:14] you may
[47:15] see the fruit of it today you may not
[47:18] see the fruit of it tomorrow but keep
[47:20] expecting keep looking keep believing
[47:24] I'm reminded of the Prophet and his
[47:27] servant when the word of the Lord went
[47:29] out and said there's going to be rain
[47:31] and the servant of the Lord goes out it
[47:34] looks he comes back all there's nothing
[47:36] nothing there go look again
[47:38] well there's nothing yet go look again
[47:41] finally he comes back with the report
[47:44] well huh
[47:46] there was a little cloud there was a
[47:49] tiny little cloud about the size of a
[47:52] man's hand and what did the Prophet say
[47:54] oh I hear the sound of abundance of rain
[47:58] he just needed a little sign and
[48:01] sometimes we we ought to be rejoicing
[48:04] over the little movement that we see
[48:07] toward what God has promised you know it
[48:10] doesn't the whole harvest doesn't come
[48:12] in overnight but but we see it beginning
[48:14] to come in and that gives us great joy
[48:17] so these are some of the things we can
[48:20] do we we praise the Lord for what we see
[48:23] happening we we thank God that barren
[48:27] areas of our life are now planted with
[48:30] truth and we expect it to keep coming
[48:33] forth so here's the point that I wanted
[48:35] to bring you today I said all of that to
[48:39] kind of boil it down to this we are
[48:42] responsible for the Word of God not only
[48:45] are we taking sides with God's Word not
[48:48] only is it important for us by faith to
[48:53] take God at His Word but we are somewhat
[48:57] responsible for what we do with the Word
[49:01] of God once we are presented it is
[49:06] presented to us I should say once the
[49:09] Word of God is made real to us we see it
[49:12] we can believe it we can embrace it then
[49:16] it's important how we approach it how we
[49:19] steward it what what do we do with it
[49:22] what we do with the seed after it's
[49:25] planet will determine where
[49:28] there are not it bears fruit in our life
[49:31] so when God presents something to you
[49:34] from his word
[49:35] maybe you you've been reading the Bible
[49:37] all of your life and you've looked over
[49:40] certain aspects of truth all of a sudden
[49:43] you're watching the gospel Channel you
[49:46] hear one of these preachers saying one
[49:47] little sentence that sparks something in
[49:50] you there's an awakening that takes
[49:53] place in your thought process and you
[49:55] say wait a minute is that really what
[49:57] God's Word said you grab your Bible you
[49:59] start looking up the scripture and and
[50:02] the next thing you know another
[50:03] scripture comes to mind and you're able
[50:05] to connect those scriptures together my
[50:08] this is good when those things begin to
[50:10] happen in our lives that is the basis of
[50:13] Revelation when the Spirit of God starts
[50:16] connecting truth with truth then we're
[50:19] moving from one place of glory one realm
[50:23] of glory to another realm and it becomes
[50:26] very very important so when we hear the
[50:29] word of God we should start agreeing
[50:31] with it immediately and we should start
[50:33] believing that word and we should start
[50:36] acting upon it as soon as possible let
[50:39] me read you another very good scripture
[50:42] that I'd like for you to hold on to and
[50:44] that's in mark chapter 4 beginning in
[50:48] verse 24 Jesus has just said if any man
[50:53] has ears to hear let him be listening
[50:55] and let him perceive and comprehend and
[50:58] now in verse 24 and he said to them
[51:01] listen very carefully to the SI i I ask
[51:04] you to listen to this this is so good
[51:07] for me and he said to them be careful
[51:10] what you are hearing be careful what you
[51:16] are hearing and we could go back to the
[51:19] grandmothers old saying you know your
[51:23] ears are not a garbage can and they're
[51:25] not and we should indeed be careful what
[51:28] we hear and and what we what we let in
[51:33] our ear gate or our eye gate we are
[51:37] Watchmen at
[51:38] the gate to make sure that we don't
[51:41] allow things to come in and abide in us
[51:44] and linger with us that would defile us
[51:47] or cause us to miss believe God's Word
[51:51] or to fall in total unbelief he says be
[51:55] careful what you are hearing now listen
[51:56] the measure of thought and study you
[52:01] give to the truth you hear oh my how
[52:07] many of us have ever heard a sermon
[52:09] heard God's Word neighbor shared the
[52:12] Word of God or preacher shared the Word
[52:14] of God at our church or on gospel
[52:17] channel and we just let it we say prover
[52:21] bleah in one ear and out the other
[52:24] or we shed the word of God like a duck
[52:27] shed water we just hear it and we just
[52:31] let it pass away we just let it flow
[52:34] right past us but this is not how we
[52:36] should treat God's Word because it has
[52:39] great value what a treasure it is to
[52:43] have the written record of God's Word so
[52:45] that we can then meditate on that
[52:47] written record of God's Word
[52:49] while calling on the Spirit of God to
[52:52] come and make that word alive in us be
[52:55] careful what you're hearing the measure
[52:56] of thought and study you give to the
[52:59] truth you hear will be the measure the
[53:03] measure you give will be the measure of
[53:06] virtue and knowledge that comes back to
[53:10] you my this means that with power and
[53:15] with a with an increase in your
[53:18] relationship with the Lord
[53:20] that's what's promised here virtue and
[53:23] knowledge is this knowledge it's not
[53:26] just head knowledge its intimate
[53:28] knowledge it's entering into a deeper
[53:31] place of fellowship and relationship and
[53:34] virtue is of course power and and
[53:39] authority to operate from the Word of
[53:42] God so the measure of careful thought
[53:45] and study we give to the word is the
[53:47] same measure that we get back in virtue
[53:51] and knowledge
[53:52] let me leave my commentary out and just
[53:54] read the verse in the amplified the
[53:57] measure of thought and study you give to
[53:59] the truth you hear will be the measure
[54:01] of virtue and knowledge that comes back
[54:04] to you and more Alleluia here's the
[54:08] abundance and more besides will be given
[54:13] to you who hear hallelujah so I want to
[54:18] say it does matter what we do with the
[54:22] Word of God that we read it does matter
[54:26] with what we do with the Word of God
[54:28] that we hear and so I think this is why
[54:32] the scripture tells us study to show
[54:34] yourself approved unto God dig a little
[54:38] deeper in this great storehouse of God's
[54:42] Word direct your life not according to
[54:47] feeling but according to God's Word
[54:51] position yourself to receive your
[54:55] inheritance by obeying God's Word by
[55:01] never ignoring it or disregarding it or
[55:05] treating it common or ignoring a truth
[55:09] when God is absolutely trying to make it
[55:14] real to us and he does that one of the
[55:17] ways that God does that with this word
[55:19] is by repetition and by confirmation we
[55:24] keep hearing something over and over
[55:26] again sometimes people will have that
[55:28] with a number they keep running into a
[55:31] particular number over and over again
[55:33] and they don't understand why and then
[55:35] one day they're reading the Bible and
[55:37] there's chapter and verse it's the
[55:39] number that they keep seeing over and
[55:41] over again oh I don't believe it can
[55:42] work that way listen it certainly can
[55:45] God can do all kinds of glorious and
[55:49] amazing and unusual things to connect
[55:51] you with His Word and so if seeing a
[55:54] number and a dream over and over or
[55:56] every time you look at the clock it's a
[55:59] certain number and and later something
[56:01] begins to
[56:01] kind of unfold to you and you find a
[56:05] verse that si
[56:06] oh yes that can be God I'm not saying it
[56:09] is every time but that can be God and if
[56:13] indeed he's connecting you with a
[56:14] certain place a certain portion of
[56:16] Scripture it's because there's something
[56:18] in that word that's part of your
[56:20] inheritance and you want to line
[56:23] yourself up in faith align yourself in
[56:27] faith to be able to become a beneficiary
[56:30] to make that word of God that was spoken
[56:33] in a very general way make it become a
[56:36] very personal truth to you that's my
[56:41] prayer for you that's that's what I'd
[56:43] like to bless you with in 2018 it's an
[56:46] awareness of the value of God's Word in
[56:50] your life and if you feel like I read it
[56:52] but it doesn't happen in my life I read
[56:54] it but it doesn't work for me
[56:56] you tell that dirty devil he's a liar he
[57:00] is a liar and the father of all lies and
[57:03] you start continuing in the word and
[57:05] abiding in the word by staying in a
[57:08] constant state of expectancy never
[57:11] entertaining doubt and when it comes
[57:14] rebuke it and send it on the way and
[57:16] tell everybody around you I'm going to
[57:19] stand firmly on God's Word and you begin
[57:23] to see through the cycles of of seed
[57:26] time and harvest you'll begin to see the
[57:29] Word of God working mightily in your
[57:32] life in this great year of 2018 and
[57:37] beyond until Jesus comes I bless you in
[57:41] the matchless name of the Lord Jesus
[57:43] Christ thank you for staying with me
[57:46] today I hope that something has been
[57:49] said that will cause you to to let God's
[57:53] Word work mightily in your heart now and
[57:57] forever thank you again for watching see
[58:00] you next time bye-bye
