[1:00:08] enjoyed that new song that we sung there
[1:00:10] at the end a little hard to learn
[1:00:13] sometime a new song but I thought it was
[1:00:15] just so appropriate for the hour that
[1:00:17] we're walking through right now to look
[1:00:20] back one of these days and know that God
[1:00:22] was winning every Victory and and and
[1:00:25] and the main thing Benjamin sent that to
[1:00:28] me this week was having a particularly
[1:00:31] difficult day uh one of three that I had
[1:00:35] and uh he sent me that song in a text he
[1:00:38] said Dad I know it's not your style of
[1:00:41] of music but he said I think you'll
[1:00:43] appreciate the words and boy did I ever
[1:00:45] I just spent the rest of the afternoon
[1:00:47] just declaring God you didn't fail you
[1:00:50] did not fail you never fail you cannot
[1:00:54] fail it's not in you to
[1:00:56] fail and we need to remember that
[1:00:59] sometime when things don't turn out the
[1:01:01] way we want them to or the way we expect
[1:01:04] them to God is not to blame he never
[1:01:07] fails he always makes decisions that are
[1:01:11] right and we will trust him no matter
[1:01:13] what AM amen uh let's turn this morning
[1:01:17] are you ready for the word can you give

[1:01:44] the
[1:01:46] issues of
[1:01:48] life life flows
[1:01:52] out of the heart is that okay to to to
[1:01:56] just
[1:01:57] emphasize put away from thee a frower
[1:02:02] mouth first of all Proverbs has
[1:02:06] addressed a father to a son has
[1:02:10] addressed guarding the heart keeping the
[1:02:14] heart now he's talking about the
[1:02:17] mouth put away from the award mouth and
[1:02:22] perverse lips put far from from thee let
[1:02:27] thine eyes look right on does anybody
[1:02:33] understand that language let our eyes be
[1:02:37] focused
[1:02:39] forward and let thine eyelids look
[1:02:43] straight before thee if we were going to
[1:02:46] paraphrase that this morning we would
[1:02:48] say don't look to the right don't look
[1:02:51] to the left but keep your eyes straight
[1:02:54] ahead on the the prize the prize is not
[1:02:58] a mansion it's not streets of gold it's
[1:03:02] not a place where the candle is not
[1:03:04] needed but but the S so n is the light
[1:03:07] but the goal is Jesus to be with him for
[1:03:12] all
[1:03:13] eternity our present goal is that he be
[1:03:18] formed in us even now and father is
[1:03:22] talking to son in Proverbs and he is is
[1:03:26] saying to him you must guard your heart
[1:03:29] because out of your heart your life
[1:03:31] flows you've got to watch your frow
[1:03:34] mouth you've got to put perverse lips
[1:03:36] far away from you he said Ponder the
[1:03:40] path of thy
[1:03:43] feet and let all thy
[1:03:46] ways read that for
[1:03:48] me let all thy ways be
[1:03:52] established turn not to the right hand
[1:03:55] he repeats himself he gives it a
[1:03:57] different language but says the same
[1:04:00] thing turn not to the right hand nor to
[1:04:03] the left remove thy
[1:04:07] foot from Evil this is not only the
[1:04:12] instructions of a father to a son in Old
[1:04:16] Testament times but it is instructions
[1:04:19] from a father to a son in New Testament
[1:04:24] times if if you believe that say amen
[1:04:27] amen you may be S be
[1:04:30] seated there is a an inspirational
[1:04:34] speaker
[1:04:36] who uh has had some influence over my
[1:04:41] life in some of his
[1:04:44] writings he writes also about journaling
[1:04:48] and about time management and and about
[1:04:51] priorities and about getting it done and
[1:04:54] about not
[1:04:56] procrastinating does anybody have a
[1:04:58] problem with
[1:05:00] procrastination and uh he talks a lot
[1:05:03] about it and has even developed the
[1:05:06] system but you you have to be quite
[1:05:08] disciplined to follow through on his
[1:05:11] system his name is Michael
[1:05:13] hayatt and he made this statement I
[1:05:15] don't know if I gave it to charity or
[1:05:17] not but he made this statement that
[1:05:19] really really says a lot to me it says
[1:05:22] if your heart is unhealthy
[1:05:26] and we're not talking about the blood
[1:05:28] pump we're talking about Le l in Hebrew
[1:05:33] and that is the
[1:05:34] seat of the mo of the
[1:05:37] emotions it is the
[1:05:40] mind it's not in the chest after
[1:05:43] all but it is symbolized in scripture to
[1:05:49] the blood pump the heart but we find
[1:05:53] that our mind does not uh it it doesn't
[1:05:56] exist in our blood pump it actually
[1:06:00] exists in our
[1:06:01] brain but spiritually the heart can be
[1:06:07] summarized as the mind he said if your
[1:06:10] heart your mind is
[1:06:13] unhealthy it threatens everything else
[1:06:17] can anybody see that family friends
[1:06:23] career we could go on on
[1:06:27] choices
[1:06:29] everything I like this so much that I
[1:06:32] made it a point to put it in my notes
[1:06:34] and when I started searching for the
[1:06:37] heart health because of a dream that I
[1:06:40] had that was the first note that came up
[1:06:43] in the search o of my own personal notes
[1:06:46] if your heart is let's read it out loud
[1:06:48] together if your heart is unhealthy it
[1:06:52] threatens everything else family friend
[1:06:55] 's career everything I like that it's
[1:06:59] very true in Genesis chapter 2 stay with
[1:07:03] me this morning I want to go to verse
[1:07:05] seven and 8 and the Lord God formed Man
[1:07:11] Out of the Dust or of the Dust of the
[1:07:14] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[1:07:18] the breath of life and Man became a
[1:07:22] living Soul we're going to call this
[1:07:25] this morning Above All Else Above All
[1:07:30] Else guard your heart in verse 8 of
[1:07:34] Genesis 2 he goes on to say and the Lord
[1:07:37] God planted a garden Eastward in Eden
[1:07:44] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:07:50] formed now we often talk about the
[1:07:53] Garden of Eden but remember Eden was a
[1:07:56] larger place than a garden and in Eden
[1:08:00] it was a land it was a place uh I don't
[1:08:04] know if you exactly how you would
[1:08:07] describe it it was uh larger than a
[1:08:11] town it was a region I think we could
[1:08:14] say and in the region of Eden God not
[1:08:19] Adam God planted a garden yes sir now
[1:08:23] that word planted in the HEB Hebrew is
[1:08:26] Nat and it means to
[1:08:30] establish to plant to fasten or to fix
[1:08:37] so God established a garden he planted a
[1:08:41] garden he fastened it and fixed it
[1:08:45] Eastward in the land of Eden are you
[1:08:48] following me and then the word Eden in
[1:08:52] Genesis 2:8 is aen
[1:08:56] which is the feminine part of the word
[1:08:58] Edan and it means Delight pleasure
[1:09:02] delicate so we can say that the Garden
[1:09:06] of Eden or Gan Edan is the garden of
[1:09:12] delight now God chose that name for a
[1:09:15] reason he wanted us to understand that
[1:09:19] his ultimate goal for you and I is that
[1:09:22] we live in a place of rest in a place of
[1:09:25] safety and in a place of
[1:09:29] delight did you know it's one of the
[1:09:31] basic Cravings of of a of an individual
[1:09:34] of a human being to have a place of rest
[1:09:38] to have a community to have something of
[1:09:40] a safe Zone to live in and we Thrive
[1:09:45] when we feel safe come on now and I want
[1:09:49] you to know that we may emphasize
[1:09:51] sometime our our roaring lion we may
[1:09:54] emphasize our raging enemy but I want
[1:09:57] you to know that even in a world gone
[1:09:59] wild even in Satan's Eden there is a
[1:10:04] place of safety there is a place of rest
[1:10:08] there is a place of pleasure and of
[1:10:10] delight and it is in Christ and it is
[1:10:13] only in Christ and it's not being in
[1:10:16] Christ in word only or or in in language
[1:10:20] that comes out of our mouth but it's
[1:10:22] really when the rubber meets the road
[1:10:25] that we can testify I'm so hidden in
[1:10:29] Christ that the waves are not going to
[1:10:32] take me out I'm I'm anchored to the Rock
[1:10:36] of Ages I'm planted myself in a place of
[1:10:40] rest in a place of pleasure in a place
[1:10:43] of delight so come what
[1:10:47] may I know who's I am is that okay you
[1:10:53] see the first purpose that God gave to
[1:10:56] Adam in in this land and in this Garden
[1:11:00] of Gan Eden was that he would dress and
[1:11:05] keep the garden now notice the language
[1:11:09] dress and keep because Proverbs 4:23
[1:11:13] said keep the heart with all diligence
[1:11:16] it's a very similar word in the Hebrew
[1:11:19] language the word of instruction that
[1:11:22] Solomon is passing down to a son
[1:11:25] the same is the same instruction that
[1:11:28] God was giving to Adam as he placed him
[1:11:31] in the Garden of Eden guard the garden
[1:11:35] keep the garden the father to the son
[1:11:38] guard the heart keep the heart now why
[1:11:42] would the heart be likened to a garden
[1:11:45] because anybody that's ever have had a
[1:11:48] garden knows it's an endless
[1:11:51] cycle you can't plant the seed and go
[1:11:53] back in a few months and get a heart
[1:11:55] Harvest because things will spring up I
[1:11:58] need a little help this morning things
[1:12:01] will spring up
[1:12:04] overnight yes they will did you know it
[1:12:07] seems like sometime that weeds grow
[1:12:10] faster than what you
[1:12:11] planted and and you can watch their
[1:12:14] progress almost overnight and we've
[1:12:17] talked about this numerous times through
[1:12:19] the years that you even should be
[1:12:22] careful when you're pulling up a weed
[1:12:24] that you don't shake any of the seed off
[1:12:27] because sometimes in our
[1:12:29] tug of trying to get something out of
[1:12:32] the
[1:12:34] garden you see
[1:12:36] me we we spill some seed some spores
[1:12:41] that are hiding on the underside of the
[1:12:44] leaves and they go back into the ground
[1:12:46] and they become very fertile because
[1:12:48] you've just given them a fertile place
[1:12:50] to grow you have broken up the ground
[1:12:53] that's now you've shaken some loose
[1:12:55] seeds in and what you're doing is you're
[1:12:58] reproducing your problem right anybody
[1:13:02] with me so now you don't have one weed
[1:13:05] in the way you've got an innumerable
[1:13:08] number of weeds getting ready to spring
[1:13:10] up so you've got to let them spring up
[1:13:13] you'll never chase them out by trying to
[1:13:15] get a magnifying glass and find them but
[1:13:18] you'll have to let them spring up before
[1:13:20] you can uproot them and so to guard and
[1:13:24] to keep is a full-time
[1:13:26] job it's it's what the scripture says we
[1:13:30] should remember above all else I want
[1:13:33] you to say With Me Above All Else else
[1:13:36] above all else it is my responsibility
[1:13:40] say that it is
[1:13:42] my not my
[1:13:45] husbands not my wives not my
[1:13:49] pastors not my children not
[1:13:53] presidents not governors
[1:13:58] not
[1:13:59] doctors not
[1:14:01] lawyers it above all things it is my
[1:14:05] responsibility to guard my garden to
[1:14:10] guard my
[1:14:12] heart now this sprung out of a dream or
[1:14:17] an experience that I had on the evening
[1:14:20] of September the 4th and when I woke up
[1:14:23] on September the fifth I wrote it down I
[1:14:26] went to the chair I took my laptop and I
[1:14:30] transcribed the dream that I had and in
[1:14:32] this dream there was a person a person
[1:14:36] that I
[1:14:37] recognized I'm going to try to leave it
[1:14:40] gender nutral because it doesn't really
[1:14:42] matter if it was a man or a woman it was
[1:14:44] just a person a human being someone that
[1:14:48] I knew someone that I loved someone that
[1:14:51] I cared about there was something going
[1:14:54] on on like a it it wasn't exactly like a
[1:14:58] foot race it was kind of more like a
[1:15:00] Spartan competition or something like
[1:15:03] that because there were there were
[1:15:05] obstacle type uh events or courses that
[1:15:10] were set up around the field it was
[1:15:13] around field but it wasn't just running
[1:15:16] track there were some hurdles to jump
[1:15:19] over and and there was eventually toward
[1:15:23] the very end of that uh racetrack there
[1:15:27] was a wall that had to be
[1:15:30] climbed I noticed because I was sort of
[1:15:33] sitting in the in the bleachers looking
[1:15:36] down over the race and I did see a few
[1:15:38] other people in the competition but my
[1:15:42] focus was on the person that I
[1:15:44] recognized the one I
[1:15:46] knew and this person had done very well
[1:15:49] getting around the track I I was
[1:15:52] actually amazed I said oh my this you
[1:15:55] know this person has lost weight and
[1:15:58] they're more fit it looks like this is
[1:16:00] you know I never thought I'd be here for
[1:16:03] my friend watching this person compete
[1:16:06] in a in a competition or something like
[1:16:10] this a and as they came as as this
[1:16:13] person came to the last part of that
[1:16:17] competition there was a wall as I
[1:16:19] mentioned that had to be scaled it had
[1:16:21] to be climbed and and the person had to
[1:16:24] make their way down the other side but
[1:16:26] it was quite high and jumping was
[1:16:28] probably not the best you know jumping
[1:16:30] all the way down was probably not the
[1:16:32] best solution I noticed that it wasn't
[1:16:35] like a rock climbing wall there were no
[1:16:38] places particularly in the wall to put
[1:16:41] your feet so you were going to have to
[1:16:44] depend on sheer strength to not only
[1:16:48] climb but to
[1:16:50] adhere like Spiderman so to speak
[1:16:54] forgive the refence to the wall to be
[1:16:57] able to get over the wall to the other
[1:16:59] side I watched this individual uh do
[1:17:03] quite well time and time and time again
[1:17:07] but each and every time as that person
[1:17:09] would get to the top part of the wall
[1:17:12] even one time so close to the top that
[1:17:17] the person began to sort of lift their
[1:17:19] leg like they were going to try to find
[1:17:22] some inertia to to ort of uh haul
[1:17:27] themselves hurl themselves over the top
[1:17:30] but each time they begin to slip down
[1:17:33] the wall slide down the wall most of the
[1:17:37] time collapsing at the bottom the last
[1:17:39] time the person fell quite hard on their
[1:17:43] back and it looked as though the wind
[1:17:46] had been knocked out of them and the
[1:17:49] word of the Lord came in this experience
[1:17:52] and said tell this person by my name
[1:17:56] whatever you
[1:17:57] do guard your
[1:18:01] heart this was to be the word of the
[1:18:03] Lord to that person and for some reason
[1:18:06] it seemed in the dream or experience to
[1:18:09] be directly related to the fact that all
[1:18:13] of these times they had tried to get
[1:18:16] over the wall and yet something had kept
[1:18:20] uh causing them to fall to collapse as a
[1:18:25] puddle or a heap at the bottom and then
[1:18:27] the last time as I mentioned it looked
[1:18:29] like even the wind was knocked out of
[1:18:32] them and it didn't maybe seem like an
[1:18:35] appropriate word of the Lord to deliver
[1:18:38] in a situation like that but I believe
[1:18:40] the Lord was saying the reason why
[1:18:43] there's such a struggle to get over this
[1:18:48] thing you see that's why I want to just
[1:18:50] leave it
[1:18:51] genderless and I want to leave it
[1:18:53] nameless
[1:18:55] because in reality I've actually spoken
[1:18:57] to the person that it was about but you
[1:19:00] can think it was you if you want
[1:19:02] to I maybe shouldn't have even said that
[1:19:06] because then I won't have any text this
[1:19:08] afternoon asking me was it me was it me
[1:19:10] was it me was it me was it me I should
[1:19:11] have just left it like it was but I did
[1:19:14] actually speak to the person that it was
[1:19:16] about but the reality is every one of us
[1:19:19] have got a
[1:19:20] hurdle every one of us have got a wall
[1:19:22] to get over and the the reality is no
[1:19:25] matter how much weight we've lost or how
[1:19:28] how healthier we get or or how more fit
[1:19:31] we get we don't have within ourselves
[1:19:34] what it takes to get over the last wall
[1:19:37] to win the prize if we do it it's going
[1:19:40] to be because of the help and the grace
[1:19:42] of God and we can't even depend on him
[1:19:46] if our heart is not
[1:19:52] right we expect God to bless us because
[1:19:57] we go to
[1:19:58] church we expect God to bless us because
[1:20:02] we pay our tithe we expect God to bless
[1:20:06] us because we say we believe the message
[1:20:09] but the reality is we can become quite
[1:20:13] clean on the
[1:20:15] outside but the but the reality is that
[1:20:19] there are
[1:20:22] issues there are flows
[1:20:25] that are coming out of us because our
[1:20:29] heart has not been properly guarded now
[1:20:33] some of you seem extremely drowsy this
[1:20:37] morning and I'm only going to say this
[1:20:41] once I'm talking to
[1:20:44] you you in fact are the
[1:20:47] one that I'm talking to this morning and
[1:20:51] I feel again that I'm not here to just
[1:20:54] give you a little sermon but I'm here to
[1:20:57] give you something perhaps the word of
[1:21:00] the Lord for where you are right now
[1:21:03] you're going to keep falling again and
[1:21:06] again and again you're going to have the
[1:21:09] wind knocked out of you again and again
[1:21:12] and again until you discover what's
[1:21:15] growing in your
[1:21:16] garden until you discover what's coming
[1:21:20] into your heart what you have allowed to
[1:21:23] grow
[1:21:25] in your inner
[1:21:27] man if I were to ask you the question
[1:21:30] which is the most important part of who
[1:21:32] we are outer man or inner man of course
[1:21:36] it's the inner man because it's out of
[1:21:39] the inner man that everything else
[1:21:43] flows IT issues forth we can have some
[1:21:47] fun with this word issues because in the
[1:21:51] in the in the na in the original
[1:21:53] language I'll show you in a moment it's
[1:21:55] both referring to something that issues
[1:21:59] out that that flows out like water from
[1:22:01] a from a from a tap but it's also a word
[1:22:06] that can be used for life's
[1:22:10] issues like jealousy Envy bitterness
[1:22:15] unforgiveness
[1:22:18] hatred oh my let's get together let's
[1:22:22] get together because I've got a feeling
[1:22:25] that the Lord if he hasn't already I've
[1:22:29] got a feeling that the Lord is about to
[1:22:31] help you do some
[1:22:32] gardening and I want you to know that if
[1:22:35] you got if you've got any smarts at all
[1:22:37] and I believe you do then you will get
[1:22:41] busy and anticipate his
[1:22:45] arrival because once he gets to your
[1:22:47] garden
[1:22:50] brother he's going to deal with the
[1:22:52] toughest stuff he's going to deal with
[1:22:55] that which has roots that go all the way
[1:22:57] back to your
[1:22:59] childhood because he wants to walk with
[1:23:01] you in the cool of the day in your
[1:23:07] garden he wants to have fellowship and
[1:23:10] he walks with me and he talks with me
[1:23:15] the song is called in the
[1:23:17] garden and we think it's talking about
[1:23:20] somebody's flower
[1:23:21] bushes but in reality it's talking about
[1:23:25] the garden of the Inner Man and when I
[1:23:28] hear the scripture say above all I
[1:23:32] believe it means just that above all
[1:23:36] when we sing the chorus above all powers
[1:23:39] above all names Above All Creatures
[1:23:43] above all created things I think that's
[1:23:46] what it means above aou L all all means
[1:23:51] all that's all that's so more than your
[1:23:56] skirt
[1:23:58] length which some of you could use a
[1:24:01] little
[1:24:03] help some of you just flat out need a
[1:24:06] bigger size all the way
[1:24:08] around because you've got too many
[1:24:12] curves that are moving and
[1:24:16] shaking but above
[1:24:20] that above your
[1:24:23] hair come on
[1:24:24] on above a a brother how he lives in his
[1:24:31] job and how he refuses dirty jokes and
[1:24:35] how his language shouldn't be like like
[1:24:38] the world listen if you have a Leo de
[1:24:41] and vocabulary you may need somebody to
[1:24:44] wash your mouth out with
[1:24:46] soap because there are certain things
[1:24:49] that are not curse words but they are
[1:24:52] vulgar and they are uh pop culture and
[1:24:56] they
[1:24:59] smack of the world around us and they
[1:25:02] don't sound like holy ghost filled
[1:25:05] people they don't sound like redeemed
[1:25:07] sons of God there are things that we say
[1:25:10] that do not sound like Christians it
[1:25:13] sounds like Instagram and it sounds like
[1:25:16] Facebook and it sounds like texting uh
[1:25:20] uh uh you know lol's and what do you
[1:25:23] call those not emojis
[1:25:27] uh abbreviations or something like that
[1:25:30] of laugh out loud and rolling on the
[1:25:33] floor laughing and OMG I hope that means
[1:25:37] oh my goodness because it would be a
[1:25:40] unchristian to say oh my God in that
[1:25:42] kind of context that wouldn't be like a
[1:25:45] Christian Christian wouldn't talk like
[1:25:48] that you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:51] because that's using the name of God
[1:25:52] which is not a name but it's using the
[1:25:54] office of God in vain when we use the
[1:25:58] name of God it should be to praise him
[1:26:00] or to call on him because we need his
[1:26:02] help it shouldn't be his
[1:26:04] slang come on brother sister but above
[1:26:08] all
[1:26:10] that Above All Above the fact that some
[1:26:14] of us could be a little more faithful in
[1:26:16] our
[1:26:18] tithing above all what does all mean all
[1:26:23] it's all it means all there's nothing
[1:26:26] else left when you say above all the
[1:26:29] scripture says above all guard your not
[1:26:34] your
[1:26:36] closet your heart not your
[1:26:39] career your heart not your
[1:26:43] family above all Say it With Me Above
[1:26:45] All Else guard your
[1:26:50] heart because out of your heart
[1:26:55] heart are the
[1:26:59] issues of life it's powerful powerful
[1:27:03] powerful scripture
[1:27:05] verses in Genesis 2:15 he said and the
[1:27:09] Lord God took the man and put p u t
[1:27:15] put when I see the word put in a
[1:27:19] complicated sentence like
[1:27:22] this I'm taking back to my pre-reading
[1:27:26] days or my early reading days See Spot
[1:27:33] Run I think immediately of Dick and
[1:27:37] Jane because the word put is a small
[1:27:41] word that was often used in Dick and
[1:27:44] Jane See Jane put the
[1:27:48] book on the table now this was not first
[1:27:53] first dick and readers this is moving up
[1:27:55] a little bit but put put the cat
[1:28:00] down put seems like such a small little
[1:28:03] word in this verse for such a a a
[1:28:06] serious and complicated and even complex
[1:28:10] truth but it says and the Lord God took
[1:28:13] the man and put
[1:28:15] him that word put is actually a much
[1:28:19] bigger word in Hebrew it it it's the
[1:28:22] word yanak
[1:28:24] and it means to
[1:28:27] rest and the Lord God took the
[1:28:31] man and rested him into the Garden of
[1:28:37] Eden it means to
[1:28:40] allow to
[1:28:42] bestow and even more importantly we
[1:28:45] combine the meanings to settle
[1:28:49] down and
[1:28:52] remain God put the man we now know his
[1:28:56] name was Adam which means of the red
[1:29:00] Earth God put
[1:29:03] Adam he placed him he rested him he
[1:29:07] allowed him he was bestowing something
[1:29:11] on him to put him there and he expected
[1:29:14] him
[1:29:15] to settle down and remain so the Garden
[1:29:20] of Eden is a place that God expects you
[1:29:25] and I to
[1:29:26] find and to remain there it's a garden
[1:29:31] of delight it's a place of Joy how many
[1:29:35] of you know how important it is to find
[1:29:37] a place of
[1:29:38] Joy the enemy comes every day to knock
[1:29:41] you out of your garden he comes every
[1:29:43] day to take you out of Joy he comes
[1:29:46] every day to take you out of rest
[1:29:49] pastor's preaching now he comes every
[1:29:51] day to take you out of your place of
[1:29:53] comfort Fort the place where you have
[1:29:55] fellowship with him it it isn't that
[1:29:58] that Satan cares where you live
[1:30:03] geographically it's not that at all but
[1:30:06] he doesn't like it when your heart is at
[1:30:09] rest because remember the heart is the
[1:30:12] mind and the mind is closer related to
[1:30:16] the soul than it is the spirit now I
[1:30:21] know there's going to be those who hear
[1:30:23] this who have it a little bit different
[1:30:25] and and and so I would just say it
[1:30:27] depends on on whether you believe that
[1:30:31] it is Body Spirit Soul or Body Soul
[1:30:35] spirit I have to do what the prophet
[1:30:38] told me to do since he said it both
[1:30:43] ways if we find brother brandom saying
[1:30:46] Hell is eternal and hell is not Eternal
[1:30:50] if we find brother brandom saying God is
[1:30:52] a trinity
[1:30:54] and God is not a
[1:30:57] trinity can I give you should I give you
[1:30:59] some more do you need some more th this
[1:31:02] is like a workbook for me this is like
[1:31:05] good exercise for me because then I have
[1:31:09] to say which one of
[1:31:12] these hear this which one of these fits
[1:31:16] the
[1:31:19] absolute they both can't be the absolute
[1:31:24] that's God cannot be an absolute Trinity
[1:31:27] and absolute not a
[1:31:32] trinity hell cannot absolutely be
[1:31:35] Eternal and it can't be absolutely not
[1:31:37] Eternal at the same time it's got to be
[1:31:41] one to the other so guess what we were
[1:31:42] told to do take it
[1:31:46] back to the prophet's quotebook which is
[1:31:49] the
[1:31:51] Bible That's you don't often hear saying
[1:31:54] like I said the other day in paragraph
[1:31:57] 11 page 9 on
[1:32:01] 1963 but he did tell us what is written
[1:32:04] it is written he did tell us chapter and
[1:32:08] verse because it's chapter and verse
[1:32:12] that we build our lives on because men
[1:32:16] are in a place of progressive revelation
[1:32:19] but God has never had a further
[1:32:23] revelation of anything he's never had a
[1:32:26] further thought he thought all of his
[1:32:32] thoughts
[1:32:34] originally and now he just rethinks
[1:32:39] them he just revisits them brain science
[1:32:44] tells us that if we would spend more
[1:32:46] time revisiting our positive healthy
[1:32:51] thoughts than we do our negative
[1:32:54] thoughts that eventually the negative
[1:32:56] thoughts would burn
[1:33:01] up there are brain scans that you can
[1:33:04] find on YouTube that will show you what
[1:33:07] it looks like when a when a portion of a
[1:33:11] dendrite ceases to
[1:33:14] exist it just sort of flashes a little
[1:33:18] light and it's poof it's
[1:33:21] gone you can't revisit that
[1:33:24] unless someone says something or you
[1:33:26] read something or you see something that
[1:33:30] causes that to come come to you then it
[1:33:33] starts rewriting it right back into the
[1:33:36] recesses not of just your spiritual man
[1:33:39] but of your natural physical real estate
[1:33:42] the real estate of your brain uh this is
[1:33:45] an amazing gift that God has given
[1:33:50] us I don't have to think about every
[1:33:52] move that I'm going to make and
[1:33:54] everything that I'm going to do through
[1:33:56] the day I develop a routine I develop a
[1:33:59] habit and as long as I stay with that
[1:34:01] I'm okay because my brain will prompt me
[1:34:04] without
[1:34:07] language to do what is next but if I
[1:34:11] fill up my brain I'm not going to stay
[1:34:13] here long but if I fill up my brain with
[1:34:15] negative energy
[1:34:17] thoughts they make those twisted if
[1:34:20] you've ever seen pictures of dendrites
[1:34:23] you know know that there are some that
[1:34:25] look healthy like the tree of life and
[1:34:27] there are those that look twisted and
[1:34:31] gnarled this is science now I'm not
[1:34:33] making this up twisted and gnarled like
[1:34:37] Sleepy Hollow
[1:34:38] trees you understand what I mean like
[1:34:41] haunted haunted picture trees Twisted
[1:34:45] ugly trees you isn't it crazy to think
[1:34:48] you've got some ugly trees growing
[1:34:53] here here you and I have been given the
[1:34:56] privilege to eat from the Tree of
[1:34:59] Life and yet we choose to keep going
[1:35:02] back and
[1:35:03] revisiting he said she said he did she
[1:35:07] did I'm going to preach to you now
[1:35:10] because Above All
[1:35:13] Else guard your heart you want to get
[1:35:18] over the mountain you want to get over
[1:35:20] the uh you want to get to the top of the
[1:35:22] mountain you want to get over the wall
[1:35:24] above all
[1:35:29] else well I need to pray more you
[1:35:33] do I need to read the Bible more you
[1:35:36] do I need to hear the message more you
[1:35:39] do but above all else you better put a
[1:35:43] Watchman on the wall of your
[1:35:46] heart because your mind will and
[1:35:49] emotions is where the enemy is going to
[1:35:51] fight you day in in and day out he's
[1:35:56] going to fight you in the Battlefield of
[1:35:58] the Mind which is the
[1:36:01] heart it's the
[1:36:04] heart that's where he's going to fight
[1:36:07] you if you are recently recovering from
[1:36:10] an addiction he's going to try to drag
[1:36:13] you back into that addiction because
[1:36:16] your brain has been wrongly wired to
[1:36:20] believe you did it you did it I did it
[1:36:25] we have wrongly wired our brain to
[1:36:28] believe that this is the only piece we
[1:36:31] have a
[1:36:34] joint this
[1:36:36] kind not the beer
[1:36:38] joint we have wired ourselves and you
[1:36:41] know we have excuses to go with it why
[1:36:43] there are some states where it's
[1:36:47] legal and there are
[1:36:50] dispensaries and and and they and you
[1:36:52] know even answer
[1:36:55] patience and we say all of these kinds
[1:36:58] of
[1:36:59] things not taking note that science is
[1:37:03] getting clearer every day that it's
[1:37:06] going to be a a a win lose situation if
[1:37:10] you get hooked on the stuff even though
[1:37:12] it's a plant it's going to be a win-
[1:37:15] lose situation because you are going to
[1:37:18] destroy brain
[1:37:19] cells over a period of time of which
[1:37:23] they're finding out you may never be
[1:37:25] able to regrow you may never be able to
[1:37:28] re uh to replace the cells that you have
[1:37:37] damaged because it's not the
[1:37:40] plant it's the smoking of the plant it's
[1:37:43] the burning of the plant it's the
[1:37:46] inhaling the plant that is causing
[1:37:50] people's bodies so much
[1:37:52] damage somebody said I quit smoking
[1:37:54] cigarettes and so I I do these
[1:37:57] ecigarettes what do they call them
[1:38:02] Vapes so that means you're afraid to use
[1:38:05] a little essential oil on your
[1:38:08] finger God forbid you'd put it in your
[1:38:11] mouth like I do every
[1:38:13] day but you're willing to inhale
[1:38:17] chemicals that go right down into the
[1:38:20] lungs and start
[1:38:24] immediately immediately
[1:38:27] deforming the cells that it touches
[1:38:31] because your lungs weren't made to come
[1:38:33] in contact on a regular basis with those
[1:38:37] man-made chemicals so those things
[1:38:40] attach themselves are you here attach
[1:38:43] themselves to the very cells of your
[1:38:45] lungs and as soon as they do damage is
[1:38:50] caused now that's no problem because
[1:38:52] cells become damaged every day they fall
[1:38:55] off and new cells appear here's where
[1:38:57] the problem lies in things like alcohol
[1:39:01] and things like nicotine and things like
[1:39:03] chemicals from Vapes and and even the
[1:39:06] smoking of the marijuana and the and the
[1:39:08] on and and even too much
[1:39:11] sugar for the food
[1:39:13] addicts these things not only damage
[1:39:16] cells but they start working on the DNA
[1:39:20] of the
[1:39:22] cell sir and the RNA and if you're not
[1:39:25] careful what happens in most most cases
[1:39:29] is when that cell goes to be
[1:39:32] replaced because there's been
[1:39:36] damage the cell that replaces it can you
[1:39:39] guess it's a damaged cell it's not a
[1:39:43] whole cell it's not the cell like you
[1:39:45] had before you damaged it it's what we
[1:39:48] call a mutated
[1:39:50] cell and guess what it's going to
[1:39:53] multiply and reproduce itself and guess
[1:39:56] what the next one's going to be mutated
[1:39:58] and the next one is going to M be
[1:40:00] mutated and depending on what kind of
[1:40:02] cell it is it's going to end up being a
[1:40:07] tumor and depending on what kind of
[1:40:09] tumor it is it may be something that
[1:40:11] takes your breath or it may be something
[1:40:14] that takes your life you see the enem is
[1:40:17] a
[1:40:18] liar you don't have to have those things
[1:40:21] to get by
[1:40:23] you've just got to guard your heart and
[1:40:26] you can't guard it until you clean
[1:40:29] it you've got to discover what it is
[1:40:32] that's growing in your heart that's
[1:40:35] causing you not to be able to get over
[1:40:37] the
[1:40:38] wall you need to discover what's growing
[1:40:41] in your heart that takes you back to the
[1:40:44] pornography that takes you back to the
[1:40:47] self-pleasure that takes you back to
[1:40:49] whatever it is Sir that's keeping you
[1:40:52] from
[1:40:53] overcoming remember there is an
[1:40:56] overcoming bride that is being raised up
[1:40:59] in this hour it doesn't matter how many
[1:41:03] give up it doesn't matter how many lay
[1:41:06] down there's going to be
[1:41:09] some that refuse to give up because they
[1:41:14] have recognized by Revelation the reason
[1:41:18] why they were
[1:41:20] born you weren't here to be come a a a
[1:41:24] dump for
[1:41:28] chemicals you're not here to become a
[1:41:32] dump for whatever it is that the enemy
[1:41:35] is sending against you whether it's a
[1:41:37] physical stimulant or whether it's an
[1:41:40] emotional
[1:41:41] stimulant if it's not bringing you
[1:41:44] closer to
[1:41:45] Christ that's
[1:41:49] right somebody said I don't even know
[1:41:51] how to get rid of these things well the
[1:41:52] first thing you need to do is separate
[1:41:54] it from its Life
[1:41:58] Source that's not a bad idea when you're
[1:42:00] dealing with things like honeysuckle
[1:42:02] vines in the natural they're a
[1:42:06] mess they're a mess but you know you can
[1:42:08] do a little bit better with them if
[1:42:09] you'll cut some of them and let them die
[1:42:12] then you can haul them out and you can
[1:42:14] go back in not too close to the root now
[1:42:17] because you need to be able to go back
[1:42:18] in and find where they are you see this
[1:42:21] is the way it works you've got to
[1:42:23] separate whatever that is and I may get
[1:42:26] very personal so I hope that you are
[1:42:28] awake because if I ask you a question
[1:42:31] you're going to look
[1:42:34] dumb if you're
[1:42:38] snoring how can someone watch a two-hour
[1:42:43] movie never
[1:42:47] doze
[1:42:50] hello but you let the preacher get a
[1:42:53] little too close for
[1:42:55] comfort and you'd be surprised how
[1:42:58] drowsy you
[1:42:59] get come on now it's just we can say
[1:43:02] that it's this I've had it all I've it's
[1:43:05] all been sent to me in the
[1:43:07] past I've got it all I've read it all
[1:43:10] I've seen it all but the reality is it
[1:43:14] depends on what Zeal you come
[1:43:19] with it depends on where your loyalty is
[1:43:23] is it to your employer more or is it to
[1:43:25] your own spiritual life there comes a
[1:43:29] time where we've got to find what it is
[1:43:31] that really
[1:43:32] matters because husband can't do it for
[1:43:35] you and wife can't do it for you and
[1:43:39] pastors can't do it for you but Above
[1:43:41] All
[1:43:42] Else you've got to guard your
[1:43:47] heart you've got to guard your mind yes
[1:43:51] sir I believe that it's what the
[1:43:53] scripture
[1:43:54] says it's Body Soul and Spirit or Spirit
[1:43:59] soul and Body Soul in the middle because
[1:44:02] the spirit of God breathed life into
[1:44:06] Adam who was a physical body made from
[1:44:10] the red Earth of Eden and it was nothing
[1:44:14] but a physical body until the Breath of
[1:44:17] God came in it and when the breath of
[1:44:19] Spirit came in it the scriptures
[1:44:23] clear Man
[1:44:26] became a living
[1:44:29] Soul he was Spirit first he was body
[1:44:33] first but when spirit and body came
[1:44:36] together he was given a soul and that
[1:44:40] soul is not your enemy that soul is
[1:44:44] where your victory has to
[1:44:46] be that soul is the Battleground the
[1:44:50] mind is the Battleground it's not not
[1:44:53] your enemy it's only the arena it's only
[1:44:57] the venue where the battle rages but
[1:45:00] blessed be the name of the Lord It's
[1:45:03] where the battle rages that the victory
[1:45:06] is born it's where the battle is Raging
[1:45:10] that Jesus the
[1:45:13] Victor can come and be
[1:45:18] Lord he wants to be Lord he wants to be
[1:45:21] your leader
[1:45:23] he doesn't want you to be led by
[1:45:28] smut he doesn't want you to be led by
[1:45:36] Vanity it's a false Doctrine to teach
[1:45:39] that that having deodorant on is is sin
[1:45:42] or Pride that's a false Doctrine I
[1:45:44] reject
[1:45:47] that while anti persin is certainly not
[1:45:50] good for you you can find something that
[1:45:54] smells better than pure old bo body odor
[1:45:58] that doesn't make you
[1:45:59] holy it makes you
[1:46:02] repulsive so if you're sitting here this
[1:46:04] morning and you think you're so holy
[1:46:07] because you
[1:46:09] stink you came out of the old school
[1:46:12] that's right I'm glad I graduated from
[1:46:15] that kind of problem so while you're
[1:46:18] worried about not putting on a little
[1:46:19] mum or a little bit of deodorant to cut
[1:46:22] down on your
[1:46:24] stench there's something worse than that
[1:46:27] growing in your
[1:46:33] heart we're jealous and envious of one
[1:46:36] another but we wouldn't dare want to
[1:46:38] smell good because that would be
[1:46:42] vanity
[1:46:44] hello we wouldn't dare want to match our
[1:46:47] clothes you know because brother brandom
[1:46:49] said well it didn't matter you know I
[1:46:50] just wear a coat and a pair of pants and
[1:46:52] so for it doesn't really matter you know
[1:46:54] just a pair of serious sucker bres that
[1:46:56] I can press on the backseat of my
[1:46:58] automobile and so forth but let me tell
[1:47:00] you something you're not living in the
[1:47:02] 1950s any longer you're living in 2020
[1:47:06] and it matters how you present yourself
[1:47:09] to the world around you because you are
[1:47:12] ambassadors of the Lord Jesus
[1:47:16] Christ how you treat your landlord
[1:47:19] matters how you treat your employees
[1:47:22] matters
[1:47:24] how you slop to Walmart
[1:47:27] matters woo I hear some preaching going
[1:47:30] on here because you're not just
[1:47:33] representing Jernigan family or Shelly
[1:47:36] family or McFarland family or Yantis F
[1:47:39] you're representing the kingdom of God
[1:47:43] the God of all gods the one who is Holy
[1:47:48] the one who matters so please don't get
[1:47:51] caught up in whether whether or not your
[1:47:53] sleeve has covered your
[1:47:58] elbow while you've got ugly
[1:48:02] stuff you speak to your wife like she's
[1:48:05] a dog that's ugly
[1:48:08] stuff you try to sneak around and
[1:48:11] manipulate your husband to get him to do
[1:48:13] what you want him to do that's ugly
[1:48:16] stuff on I believe you're less likely to
[1:48:20] get to heaven with that growing in your
[1:48:22] heart than if you were to show your
[1:48:26] elbow you see how the enemy gets
[1:48:29] everything out of whack that's why God
[1:48:31] had to call us even out of the Holiness
[1:48:33] movement that's why God had to even call
[1:48:35] us out of Pentecost as a movement as a
[1:48:39] denomination not that the experience is
[1:48:41] wrong not that Living Clean and holy and
[1:48:44] separated is wrong but it's like the
[1:48:46] prophet tells us they they come along to
[1:48:48] a certain thing and they put a period
[1:48:50] there
[1:48:52] soon as the Pentecostal started
[1:48:54] jabbering in tongues they said we've got
[1:48:56] the fullness well the Bible tells us
[1:48:58] that that is not the fullness the
[1:49:00] fullness is the
[1:49:02] seal what we get so excited over is just
[1:49:06] the
[1:49:06] earnest we get excited over the one
[1:49:09] infilling and the many refilling but
[1:49:12] it's something even more than that
[1:49:14] promise to the overcoming redeemed of
[1:49:17] the Lord and that is that we step into
[1:49:20] that place where we are sin
[1:49:25] until the day until the day of
[1:49:30] Redemption come
[1:49:33] on I'm disturbed about their Christmas
[1:49:36] trees and all the other Pagan idols and
[1:49:39] things that they get so excited about
[1:49:41] even around this message their their
[1:49:44] their weddings their their cleavage that
[1:49:47] these girls show at their wedding day
[1:49:51] you you I understand the con ction
[1:49:53] between cleavage and
[1:49:54] weddings that should be on the wedding
[1:49:59] night I understand that that's what the
[1:50:02] husband has been wanting to see I get
[1:50:04] all of that I understand the chemistry
[1:50:07] of the human
[1:50:09] man but in front of God and
[1:50:14] everybody never wore Powder and Paint
[1:50:17] mascara and ey Shadow and all that until
[1:50:20] the wedding day
[1:50:23] don't have time to take your call
[1:50:24] Brother wherever you're from somewhere
[1:50:25] in Africa God bless
[1:50:27] you little
[1:50:31] busy why in the world do these girls
[1:50:34] want to want to put on that kind of a
[1:50:36] thing on the day that matters so much
[1:50:40] you've already got him so you're not
[1:50:42] doing it for him who are you doing it
[1:50:45] for the
[1:50:51] photographer you you're doing it for
[1:50:53] social
[1:50:56] media I think I'm going to dye my hair
[1:50:58] I'm getting
[1:51:01] married that's not going to change who
[1:51:03] you are you're just fixing up the old
[1:51:07] barn but it's the inside it's the manure
[1:51:10] on the inside of your barn that we need
[1:51:13] to be
[1:51:16] most most Above All Else concerned about
[1:51:20] in this hour
[1:51:24] amen you don't want to get me on those
[1:51:27] things those outward things they don't
[1:51:29] matter as much as the inward but they
[1:51:32] matter they matter because if one
[1:51:35] generation lets down the bars if one
[1:51:39] generation lets down the guard the Old
[1:51:42] Guard
[1:51:44] dies and the Next Generation swallows
[1:51:48] whatever
[1:51:50] works and that's why you've got fath
[1:51:52] Facebook full of message Believers with
[1:51:54] their little children dressed up with
[1:51:56] their little Jackal lanterns going door
[1:51:58] to door they think they've got so much
[1:52:02] Revelation on the word but they're so
[1:52:05] stupid that they can't see evil lurking
[1:52:09] at the
[1:52:11] [Applause]
[1:52:13] door we'll just dress our children up
[1:52:15] and take them right down to the very
[1:52:18] places of this
[1:52:21] world show in the customs of the
[1:52:28] Heathen for you it may be an innocent
[1:52:31] piece of uh Jolly Rancher candy but it's
[1:52:34] not you that we're worried about it's
[1:52:36] what it
[1:52:37] represents and here's where we're going
[1:52:39] to go in a minute it's what it opens our
[1:52:41] lives up
[1:52:47] to my old granny shouldn't have been a
[1:52:49] preacher woman but she was and until she
[1:52:53] heard
[1:52:53] better but she had some pretty good
[1:52:57] sense and she said it's not the first
[1:53:02] pain it's not the first fifth that makes
[1:53:05] the
[1:53:07] alcoholic it's not the first drag on a
[1:53:11] cigarette I mean excuse me it's not the
[1:53:13] first
[1:53:15] carton not the first
[1:53:17] pack but why would you even want to open
[1:53:21] the door you say somebody's got a pill

[1:54:26] experience I'm not against doctors I'm
[1:54:28] not against medication but I want you to
[1:54:30] know getting one from your buddy on the
[1:54:32] street that that's not um that's not a
[1:54:35] good
[1:54:40] idea I wasn't even sure whether I wanted
[1:54:42] to eat a frozen french fry from a bag
[1:54:44] that that opened up on the way home from
[1:54:47] the grocery store
[1:54:50] yesterday we used usually eat real
[1:54:53] french fries you know real potatoes if
[1:54:55] we're going to eat them but but for the
[1:54:57] sake of what what my wife was putting
[1:54:58] together she got a couple bags of frozen
[1:55:01] fries and when we went to take it out of
[1:55:03] the car the the end of it was open I
[1:55:05] said I don't know if I'm eating that or
[1:55:09] not let's let's let's cook it extra
[1:55:12] extra long make it extra crispy make it
[1:55:15] extra hot then I'm going to pray and
[1:55:17] sanctify it I don't know what people are
[1:55:20] doing you don't know what crazy people
[1:55:22] people are doing in this
[1:55:24] hour so you're going to take a pill from
[1:55:26] somebody on your
[1:55:28] job and swallow it and not know what's
[1:55:31] going on in your body
[1:55:36] folks you better be careful with
[1:55:38] influencers and you better be careful in
[1:55:41] following
[1:55:43] Trends and you better be careful huffing
[1:55:47] uh you know um laundry detergent pods
[1:55:54] and doing tricks with light bulbs in
[1:55:56] your mouth
[1:55:58] and Garling with
[1:56:02] antifreeze all the things that are cool
[1:56:05] these things aren't
[1:56:08] cool excuse me for saying stupid again
[1:56:10] children don't use the word it's a
[1:56:12] terrible word you you must be at least
[1:56:14] 21 to ever use it and that's in rare
[1:56:17] cases or circumstances but that is just
[1:56:19] playing out
[1:56:23] stupid the bigger problem that we're
[1:56:26] facing as Believers is what's going on
[1:56:30] inside the garden what's going on inside
[1:56:34] the heart what's going on inside of the
[1:56:37] mind and the will and the emotions it
[1:56:40] matters because it multiplies it matters
[1:56:44] because it produces itself it matters
[1:56:47] because it wants to TW twine its way
[1:56:51] through your life life until it cuts you
[1:56:54] off from your source which is the Tree
[1:56:57] of
[1:57:00] Life unresolved anger bitterness that's
[1:57:04] never been dealt with resentment that is
[1:57:08] never been ministered to you've never
[1:57:10] tried to dig it out so so resentment
[1:57:13] becomes bitterness and bitterness
[1:57:15] becomes exclusiveness and inclusion and
[1:57:19] pulling away and then it becomes hatred
[1:57:24] and if you've wished harm on someone
[1:57:27] else you've murdered
[1:57:33] them if you've told something that hurts
[1:57:35] someone's
[1:57:40] influence murder brother Bram say it's
[1:57:42] like taking a gun to someone it matters
[1:57:45] what you say it matters what you
[1:57:48] say so God put him I got to hurry God
[1:57:52] put him in the garden settled him down
[1:57:55] to remain at rest and then that word
[1:57:58] dress in Genesis 215 dress it's
[1:58:02] avod and it means to
[1:58:05] till so if anyone tells you that it
[1:58:08] didn't mean to do any kind of Labor
[1:58:10] they're
[1:58:12] wrong if anybody tells you that Adam had
[1:58:15] nothing else to do in the garden they're
[1:58:20] wrong he didn't
[1:58:23] toil but he did
[1:58:26] dress he did
[1:58:29] till he did
[1:58:31] serve he did work he had something to do
[1:58:35] he had something to keep he had
[1:58:38] something to
[1:58:40] cultivate because that word dress means
[1:58:43] exactly that Genesis 2 15 and the Lord
[1:58:47] God took the man and put him into the
[1:58:49] Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[1:58:52] it that word keep is Shamar and it means
[1:58:55] to keep to guard to observe listen to
[1:58:58] what else it means it means to give heed
[1:59:02] it means to preserve and look at what it
[1:59:04] means it means to
[1:59:07] watch like a Watchman it's one of the
[1:59:09] four Hebrew words that's translated to
[1:59:11] English in the Old Testament for a
[1:59:12] Watchman one who sits up on the wall one
[1:59:15] who sits up on the tower is anybody with
[1:59:18] me and you watch for the enemy to come
[1:59:20] in you're watching
[1:59:22] uh in the daylight and you're watching
[1:59:24] in the night time and you're watching if
[1:59:27] you can't see in the dark you've got
[1:59:29] night vision goggles on spiritually and
[1:59:32] you understand that as a believer that
[1:59:35] the devil pulls out the stops at
[1:59:39] night
[1:59:40] Sir so forgive me for using the word
[1:59:43] that you shouldn't use under the age of
[1:59:45] 21 again but it's just kind of
[1:59:49] stupid to go to bed watching something
[1:59:54] thing that has no wholesome value at
[1:59:57] all because sometime that stuff will
[2:00:00] hang up in your in your
[2:00:03] subconscious it'll affect your dreams
[2:00:05] and you'll be going around telling
[2:00:06] people you had a dream from the Lord
[2:00:08] about
[2:00:12] them you'll be influencing and directing
[2:00:16] someone else's
[2:00:17] life by an impression or a feeling or a
[2:00:21] dream that may have come from an
[2:00:24] imagination that is not completely
[2:00:26] Sanctified be careful what you share
[2:00:29] under the
[2:00:31] pretense of being from the
[2:00:34] Lord I'll be totally honest with you
[2:00:37] when someone tells me they have
[2:00:38] something from the Lord for me I receive
[2:00:41] it as coming from them first
[2:00:45] right I just assume in my mind they love
[2:00:48] me and they want to help me and they
[2:00:51] want to say something to me either
[2:00:53] instructive or corrective uh but but you
[2:00:57] should understand that the corrective
[2:01:00] forms of prophetic unctions should not
[2:01:03] be without some sort of
[2:01:08] judgment so for you to go to one another
[2:01:11] individually and and with something that
[2:01:13] is
[2:01:14] corrective from the Lord is out of
[2:01:19] order because they're supposed to to be
[2:01:22] a Watchman on the wall there's supposed
[2:01:24] to be some judgment
[2:01:28] involved so be careful leaving the
[2:01:31] impression that God has spoken this
[2:01:34] because some of us just seem to believe
[2:01:36] when people start sharing what's in
[2:01:38] their heart that they're speaking on
[2:01:40] behalf of the Lord they may be or they
[2:01:42] may not be but if you've had as many
[2:01:44] prophecies Visions dreams unctions
[2:01:47] feelings Goosebumps hair raising pimple
[2:01:50] feelings that people have shared with me
[2:01:52] about
[2:01:54] me you would eventually get to the place
[2:01:57] where I am I receive it is from a friend
[2:02:00] a brother a stranger whatever you are
[2:02:03] and then I take it to the
[2:02:05] Lord if it doesn't line up with the
[2:02:07] Bible it's not from
[2:02:09] him and if the Lord can't come and say
[2:02:13] Amen in my
[2:02:17] spirit it's not from the Lord for me
[2:02:20] until it is
[2:02:22] it doesn't mean the vessel is false it
[2:02:24] doesn't mean the person is false it
[2:02:26] doesn't mean the gift is false it
[2:02:29] doesn't make a false prophet it doesn't
[2:02:31] make a false discerner I'm not talking
[2:02:34] about that you're my brother or my
[2:02:36] sister you're not
[2:02:38] false you're for
[2:02:41] me but I cannot base my
[2:02:46] life on something from a
[2:02:49] friend unless the amen of the holy
[2:02:53] spirit is on
[2:02:57] it you'd be surprised how much of my
[2:03:00] time is filled up with people who come
[2:03:03] with
[2:03:05] confusion even around the world but but
[2:03:08] even in this little house with confusion
[2:03:11] over things that have been said to them
[2:03:13] that they have no absolute clue
[2:03:16] whatsoever where it come from what it
[2:03:19] means what it meant why it was said
[2:03:23] so sometimes my friends my brothers my
[2:03:27] sisters that you love me so much
[2:03:30] sometimes you make way more work for me
[2:03:32] than I have
[2:03:36] deserved sometimes you're putting me in
[2:03:38] a situation where I can't even give a
[2:03:41] good answer because I wasn't
[2:03:43] there I find that our
[2:03:47] memories are so clogged up anymore the
[2:03:50] preacher's preaching
[2:03:53] our memories are so clogged up anymore
[2:03:55] that I find out that someone you can
[2:03:57] have a conversation with someone one day
[2:03:59] and the next day they can't even
[2:04:03] remember I'm not just talking about old
[2:04:05] people young people are about as bad or
[2:04:07] maybe
[2:04:08] worse because they've got more listen
[2:04:11] they've got more ADHD than anybody else
[2:04:15] because that thumb it's that thumb you
[2:04:17] your problem is in your thumb
[2:04:27] and your attention span has gotten so
[2:04:30] short that's when you go to tell
[2:04:32] somebody tomorrow do you know what she
[2:04:35] said you may or may not be telling what
[2:04:38] was said that's right and if you are
[2:04:41] you're certainly punctuating it with how
[2:04:44] it made you
[2:04:47] feel because we have a tendency to
[2:04:49] remember how we felt
[2:04:52] all the preachers
[2:04:55] preaching more than what was
[2:04:59] said and and so if you go back to the
[2:05:01] person who was sharing out of the
[2:05:03] goodness of their heart what they
[2:05:05] remember and what is remembered by the
[2:05:07] person that the word was supposed to be
[2:05:09] delivered to is so diabolically
[2:05:12] opposite until you never can track down
[2:05:16] really what was going on in the first
[2:05:18] place because no one really remembers
[2:05:21] although they both will often say I know
[2:05:24] exactly what was
[2:05:27] said remember that if you're giving some
[2:05:30] inspiration from the Lord or instruction
[2:05:32] to somebody the the important the most
[2:05:36] important thing is for them to be able
[2:05:38] to understand what you're
[2:05:46] saying otherwise it's a dream without
[2:05:48] interpretation
[2:05:53] if a dream is
[2:05:54] interpreted it carries the weight of a
[2:05:59] vision if a message in tongues is
[2:06:02] interpreted it carries the weight of a
[2:06:07] prophecy these things
[2:06:09] matter being understand being able to
[2:06:12] understand what God is saying what
[2:06:14] someone is sharing with you from the
[2:06:15] Lord it matters and if they don't
[2:06:18] understand what you're saying you've not
[2:06:20] delivered the message
[2:06:25] L sometimes we do it for for the sense
[2:06:28] of let me get this in now before it
[2:06:32] happens but remember if the person
[2:06:35] you're speaking to doesn't understand
[2:06:38] the context of the message that you're
[2:06:41] delivering they're better
[2:06:43] off less
[2:06:46] confused and calling on the Lord amen
[2:06:54] sometimes we actually have to hold
[2:06:57] things because we realize that people
[2:06:59] are not in a frame of mind to receive
[2:07:03] what the Lord is
[2:07:05] saying did you know we can put someone
[2:07:07] in a very vulnerable position a
[2:07:10] dangerous and vulnerable position by
[2:07:12] trying to force feed them something that
[2:07:14] they're not emotionally prepared to
[2:07:19] hear even advice
[2:07:23] because their anger their resentment
[2:07:26] their rejection could accidentally be
[2:07:28] directed toward
[2:07:32] God this modern prophetic movement has
[2:07:35] got this idea that if they reject what I
[2:07:38] say they've rejected God you're not the
[2:07:41] only cowboy in the
[2:07:45] rodeo sir to reject something from a
[2:07:48] person is not necessarily to reject it
[2:07:50] from God
[2:07:52] remember that we're all
[2:07:56] Sons Papa doesn't just love one of us
[2:07:58] enough to straighten us out and help us
[2:08:01] straighten out other people but he loves
[2:08:03] us each and
[2:08:04] everyone and he wants to help us all and
[2:08:08] he wants to direct us all and I just
[2:08:10] want to tell you this the reality for a
[2:08:13] lot of us is this we don't need a vision
[2:08:16] we already know what we're supposed to
[2:08:19] do we don't need a prophet
[2:08:22] we already know what we're supposed to
[2:08:25] do we don't need tongues and
[2:08:27] interpretation because most of the time
[2:08:30] we already know what we're supposed to
[2:08:34] do and the only reason why we stay in
[2:08:37] listen is because we want to hear the
[2:08:39] opposite so we can say well so and so
[2:08:42] told me that I didn't have to do so
[2:08:44] honey I don't care if president Trump
[2:08:48] President elect Trump would would te he
[2:08:50] text me all the time
[2:08:52] time well he says it is
[2:08:55] him how how many of you does he
[2:08:59] text I get texts from him all the time
[2:09:02] hey Steve this is President Trump I want
[2:09:05] to see you in
[2:09:07] Washington hey Steve I have put two gold
[2:09:12] make America great hats up in your
[2:09:15] name send 29.95
[2:09:23] hey Steve this President Trump I'd like
[2:09:25] to see you in the in in your job on your
[2:09:28] job with a trump
[2:09:32] watch I don't think it's him I if it
[2:09:36] does he better get busy figuring out how
[2:09:38] he's going to get us out of the mess
[2:09:39] we're in and stop texting me about
[2:09:47] watches most of the time we already have
[2:09:50] the leading of what we know we should do
[2:09:52] what we're supposed to do what God is
[2:09:56] expecting out of us but we're hoping
[2:09:58] that someone might tell us something
[2:10:00] else so that we can lay our options out
[2:10:02] let me tell you something you don't have
[2:10:04] any options other than the perfect will
[2:10:07] of God for your life you were born for a
[2:10:10] purpose for a reason and that's the only
[2:10:13] option you
[2:10:15] have it would be better for you to walk
[2:10:17] the rest of your life alone that's right
[2:10:21] on
[2:10:22] than to walk it with the wrong
[2:10:24] person or out of the mind of God out of
[2:10:27] the perfect will of God it's important
[2:10:30] to know and discern the perfect will of
[2:10:33] God let me tell you something the
[2:10:34] believer has an amount of discernment
[2:10:37] built in to their Holy Ghost experience
[2:10:41] and we need to sharpen that and we need
[2:10:43] to exercise that but whatever we do we
[2:10:46] don't need to be looking for the next
[2:10:47] great
[2:10:49] word we just need to walk
[2:10:53] steady because sometimes we get carried
[2:10:55] out carried away with what season we're
[2:10:58] in the season of this or the season of
[2:11:01] that or the season of the other Above
[2:11:04] All Above All
[2:11:10] Else even if this is a war season even
[2:11:13] if this is a rest season even if it's
[2:11:16] this is a suddenly season even if it
[2:11:19] above all all
[2:11:22] else guard your heart because it's out
[2:11:26] of your heart that your life
[2:11:32] happens as a man thinketh in his
[2:11:36] heart most
[2:11:39] translations make it pler than
[2:11:43] ours he
[2:11:45] is as a man thinketh in his heart so he
[2:11:49] is
[2:11:52] well that's exactly what the father is
[2:11:54] saying here to the son guard your heart
[2:11:56] because out of that out of your heart
[2:11:59] flow the issues of life is that
[2:12:04] okay I couldn't deliver a clear word to
[2:12:06] the person that I saw in this experience
[2:12:09] until I began to understand so I spent
[2:12:12] an an an odd amount of
[2:12:15] time on on bunny Trails of of great
[2:12:18] proportion but good ones to try to
[2:12:22] understand what it really means above
[2:12:24] all else to guard your heart and I want
[2:12:28] to get to that before I close just a
[2:12:30] little of it before I close but in order
[2:12:33] to do that I've got just a minute of a
[2:12:35] section to finish can I do that in in
[2:12:38] verse 15 the word used I may have given
[2:12:40] you this I did the word used in Hebrew
[2:12:43] it's 108 the word used in Hebrew for
[2:12:47] work is the same one this is good to
[2:12:49] hear the same one as is used for manual
[2:12:53] labor but it's also the same word that's
[2:12:55] used for worshiping
[2:12:59] God it's used to describe a a form or a
[2:13:04] degree of physical
[2:13:07] labor but it's also used in places to
[2:13:10] describe the act of
[2:13:13] worship because this guarding and
[2:13:16] keeping this this dressing and keeping
[2:13:19] of the garden was physical labor but it
[2:13:23] was in a place of
[2:13:27] delight the Bible said that when the
[2:13:30] when the fall happened and the curse
[2:13:34] came God didn't say to Adam you're going
[2:13:37] to work for the first time in your
[2:13:40] life he didn't say you're going to labor
[2:13:42] for the first time in your life what did
[2:13:44] he say what's the word you're going to
[2:13:47] toil the word is used there toil
[2:13:51] you're going to you're going to labor by
[2:13:55] the sweat of your brow it means to toil
[2:13:59] it it means to labor Under Pressure it
[2:14:03] means to work Under Pressure it means to
[2:14:06] work under expectation it means to work
[2:14:09] under a
[2:14:11] load before the fall Adam's labor was an
[2:14:15] act of worship he was guarding the
[2:14:19] garden he was keeping the garden he was
[2:14:23] dressing the
[2:14:25] garden it was costing him some
[2:14:28] effort but it was considered
[2:14:32] worship because when you work for
[2:14:38] God when you labor for God not under
[2:14:42] pressure but for
[2:14:47] pleasure when I study that's
[2:14:51] that's my
[2:14:56] pleasure if God could have only called
[2:14:59] me to live somewhere in a
[2:15:02] cabin with
[2:15:07] internet so that I could study and just
[2:15:11] write put thoughts together and send
[2:15:14] them down the mountain to somebody never
[2:15:17] have to work under pressure of people's
[2:15:20] expectations
[2:15:27] never have to be called on
[2:15:29] to help
[2:15:33] fix
[2:15:36] situations that aren't biblical in the
[2:15:38] first
[2:15:40] place that's toil for
[2:15:43] me it's not really worship it's toil but
[2:15:48] it's
[2:15:49] necessary I'm with
[2:15:52] willing but what I really
[2:15:55] love is digging in the
[2:15:58] word I don't do it to be smart or to
[2:16:02] look like I'm smart that's kind of hard
[2:16:04] to fake in my condition I'm not trying
[2:16:07] to look smart but for me it's like
[2:16:11] worship Lord your word
[2:16:14] matters you know you can show God the
[2:16:17] same message by just reading
[2:16:19] it you don't have to be a scholar you
[2:16:22] don't even have to be a an extremely
[2:16:24] obsessive student but we should all be
[2:16:27] students of the word we should all read
[2:16:31] somebody said I don't know how to study
[2:16:32] just get a dictionary that's a good
[2:16:34] place to start just look up
[2:16:36] words then of course you're going to
[2:16:38] discover that what it means in English
[2:16:40] is not the real meaning anyway so then
[2:16:42] you're going to have to get a
[2:16:43] concordance or a lexicon and you're
[2:16:45] going to have to find out what the
[2:16:46] original word was that's going to take
[2:16:48] you to a deeper level we're not all
[2:16:50] called to teacher preach the word but
[2:16:52] we're all called to eat it to Feast on
[2:16:56] it it is the Tree of Life to us it is
[2:16:59] our source of life and so anything we do
[2:17:02] like that is is maybe physical effort
[2:17:06] but it's worship so what Adam was doing
[2:17:09] in in weeding or whatever little bit of
[2:17:11] cultivating he was doing it was worship
[2:17:14] because he was
[2:17:16] stewarding you that are awake hear me he
[2:17:19] was being a good
[2:17:24] Steward of the garden that God
[2:17:27] had put him
[2:17:31] in you and I are good stewards of our
[2:17:35] own
[2:17:36] garden when we make effort to discover
[2:17:41] through
[2:17:42] prayer what's keeping us from getting
[2:17:45] over the
[2:17:47] wall what's growing in US preacher
[2:17:50] preach
[2:17:51] anyway somebody will hear it
[2:17:55] later what's what's preventing
[2:17:59] us if we're fit enough to jump over the
[2:18:02] hurdles and do all the other exercises
[2:18:05] of the event why can't we get over that
[2:18:07] last
[2:18:09] wall because the enemy knows if we get
[2:18:13] over that last
[2:18:17] hump if we ever get the victory over the
[2:18:20] mind will and
[2:18:21] motion if we ever win that greatest
[2:18:24] battle ever fought and may I just tell
[2:18:26] you spiritually it's already
[2:18:29] won you just need to raise up and
[2:18:32] appropriate the
[2:18:33] victory how do I do that by starting
[2:18:37] every day making a better choice a
[2:18:40] better decision a better choice a better
[2:18:43] decision a better choice a better
[2:18:45] decision you're redeemed your behavior
[2:18:48] doesn't lose you your behavior doesn't
[2:18:51] take you out of God's
[2:18:54] economy so just start making better
[2:18:57] choices and quit returning to the
[2:19:02] vomit quit returning to the pig pin now
[2:19:06] make a better choice today and this
[2:19:09] afternoon and tonight and in the night
[2:19:12] and in the morning yes sir sir I told
[2:19:15] you some time ago the enemy the battle
[2:19:17] gets hotter in the
[2:19:18] night go to
[2:19:24] bed go to bed you want something to help
[2:19:27] you go to
[2:19:33] bed your body was designed to sleep at
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:40] night when the day comes get out of bed
[2:19:45] if you're physically able to do so get
[2:19:47] up
[2:19:51] now when it gets dark start winding
[2:19:55] down you get home from an event you're
[2:19:59] out a little late you get home at 10:00
[2:20:02] you don't have to spend an hour and a
[2:20:04] half catching up on Facebook what you
[2:20:09] missed while you were at
[2:20:14] dinner catch you five
[2:20:17] minutes build you on a computer a little
[2:20:19] friends list those people that you
[2:20:21] really want to know what's going on in
[2:20:23] their lives and ignore the
[2:20:26] rest you don't have to know what they
[2:20:28] had for
[2:20:30] dinner you don't have to know where they
[2:20:34] vacationed there are some folks you care
[2:20:36] about find you a way of separating those
[2:20:38] folks out and take you 5 10 minutes to
[2:20:41] keep up with them and
[2:20:44] then brush your
[2:20:48] teeth wash your dirty face
[2:20:52] case go to
[2:20:55] bed don't lay there for hours on your
[2:20:59] phone following one search after another
[2:21:04] one Trail after
[2:21:08] another if you get a notification in
[2:21:11] your messenger that somebody that's not
[2:21:13] on your friend's list wants to talk to
[2:21:15] you it may not be a good idea to even
[2:21:18] care
[2:21:25] I had a surprise one last
[2:21:27] night and I looked at it I don't always
[2:21:32] because a lot of times I've got a it'll
[2:21:34] say you've got you've got 30 from
[2:21:37] unknown it's whatever the con whatever
[2:21:39] it says and a lot of times it's group
[2:21:41] chats that people think that we have so
[2:21:44] much time in life we lazy sorry
[2:21:46] preachers that don't ever do anything
[2:21:48] for a living you know we've got time to
[2:21:50] read everybody's opinion in these group
[2:21:53] group things that they put together on
[2:21:55] uh uh uh um what's the other one
[2:22:00] what'sapp because the rest of the world
[2:22:02] uses what'sapp so
[2:22:04] much if I'm in contact with brother
[2:22:07] fiser and others it's through
[2:22:09] WhatsApp and I don't like it I wish I
[2:22:11] didn't have to have it I don't need
[2:22:14] something else to keep up with but last
[2:22:16] night I had a little message someone and
[2:22:18] and you can just look at the list and
[2:22:20] and if you don't and if you don't
[2:22:21] recognize you just delete because
[2:22:24] sometimes it's a you know a beautiful
[2:22:28] Filipino looking Asian looking woman who
[2:22:32] wants to
[2:22:37] connect well I have never searched that
[2:22:41] out God is my
[2:22:44] witness I never have done anything on
[2:22:46] there that would make that woman know
[2:22:48] who I am it's not that way that's not
[2:22:51] the way it
[2:22:54] works my mother is dead and she gets
[2:22:57] emails from uh from
[2:23:02] women wanting to know if she wants to
[2:23:05] see their
[2:23:08] chest well I know my mother never
[2:23:12] emailed a woman wanting to see her
[2:23:16] chest you get real caught up in that
[2:23:20] digital world and you'll be
[2:23:25] invited every now and again one will
[2:23:28] come in my spam filter and it says
[2:23:30] something like this we saw you looking
[2:23:33] at
[2:23:37] pornography we uh we have uh reversed
[2:23:41] your camera and we have pictures of you
[2:23:45] and what you were
[2:23:47] watching and if you'll send you know

[2:23:53] account will delete the
[2:23:57] files and if not I mean I've gotten 10
[2:24:00] or 12 through the years and if not we're
[2:24:03] going to release
[2:24:05] it well now I just delete
[2:24:09] them but the first few I got some years
[2:24:12] ago I was a little more arrogant and I
[2:24:14] said I want you
[2:24:18] to and if you want me to I'll send you
[2:24:21] the
[2:24:22] emails of my closest
[2:24:25] friends if you don't already have them
[2:24:28] so that you can inform them of what kind
[2:24:30] of per because there's a lot of things
[2:24:32] you might be able to find out you may be
[2:24:34] able to find out my birthday you may be
[2:24:37] able to find out my social security
[2:24:39] number these days but there's one thing
[2:24:41] you'll never be able to hold over me is
[2:24:45] that never heard another
[2:24:48] word you get in trouble if you chase
[2:24:51] down but last night there was someone
[2:24:54] from someone who's not friends that come
[2:24:56] up on messenger and it was a sister and
[2:24:58] she said are you the brother Steve
[2:25:01] Shelly that preached a message in an
[2:25:05] Arbor Michigan called sh devil about 30
[2:25:09] years
[2:25:14] ago cuz she said if you are I'd like to
[2:25:17] know it because I remember that message
[2:25:20] message I was blessed by that message
[2:25:23] and I would like to tell you that well I
[2:25:25] had a feeling that one was
[2:25:30] safe so I answered
[2:25:33] her and I looked up the date and that
[2:25:35] was I think it was November of 90
[2:25:38] whatever it was uh uh 92 I can't
[2:25:41] remember now exactly but I looked it up
[2:25:43] and I said that was me and I was 24
[2:25:46] years old and now I'm 56 with four
[2:25:49] children and and one is married and a
[2:25:52] and a six-month-old granddaughter
[2:25:54] pastoring a church uh still working for
[2:25:57] the Lord and that was the end of
[2:26:00] that but most of the time if you're
[2:26:03] involved in that kind of world the enemy
[2:26:05] will try to use those things to put
[2:26:09] hooks go to bed you may have to make a
[2:26:13] decision I don't care if you want to
[2:26:15] talk to
[2:26:17] me look folks please understand if it's
[2:26:20] life or death you can be you can be
[2:26:24] located sometimes it's just a trap don't
[2:26:27] fall in it come on make a better
[2:26:29] decision for
[2:26:32] yourself don't click on a link if you
[2:26:35] don't know what it is if somebody send
[2:26:37] you something and you don't know what it
[2:26:39] is delete
[2:26:42] it if it was from them they'll ask you
[2:26:45] about it if they don't it don't matter
[2:26:48] anyhow whatever you do Above
[2:26:52] All
[2:26:53] Else guard your
[2:27:01] heart you
[2:27:04] must I told you charity I probably
[2:27:06] wouldn't get to page
[2:27:08] 27 this page
[2:27:16] two the word used here is let me let me
[2:27:19] put that back up the word used for in
[2:27:21] Hebrew for work is the same one as is
[2:27:24] used for manual labor and I'm I'm almost
[2:27:25] finished for today and it's also used
[2:27:27] for worshiping God the picture we get is
[2:27:30] of the man of the man's work is that it
[2:27:32] was not backbreaking labor by which he
[2:27:35] hoped to e out a
[2:27:37] living that does happen later in the
[2:27:39] chapter or in the text but at this point
[2:27:42] his work consists of tending the garden
[2:27:45] and
[2:27:46] delighting in God's creation
[2:27:51] which perhaps better fits a description
[2:27:57] of and just one more thing on that
[2:27:59] before we move on and that's Genesis
[2:28:01] 2:16 And1 17 and the Lord God commanded
[2:28:03] the man saying the very next verse of
[2:28:06] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[2:28:07] freely eat but of the tree of the
[2:28:09] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[2:28:11] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[2:28:13] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely
[2:28:17] die put that back up just one second sis
[2:28:21] look at verse
[2:28:24] 17 but of the tree of the knowledge
[2:28:32] of
[2:28:34] Tove and
[2:28:37] raah good and
[2:28:43] evil those are important words to keep
[2:28:46] in mind when going through the Hebrew
[2:28:48] scripture
[2:28:50] good and evil Tove and raw remember when
[2:28:53] you are bringing
[2:28:56] forth Harvest maturity from the seed
[2:29:01] that have been planted in You by God he
[2:29:03] calls that good
[2:29:06] Tove he might even call it very good to
[2:29:12] may but when you are not bringing forth
[2:29:15] the purpose of your
[2:29:18] birth your
[2:29:21] Destiny your
[2:29:23] why the reason you were
[2:29:26] born God doesn't call that
[2:29:29] bad it's not good and
[2:29:32] bad he uses the same Hebrew words here
[2:29:35] Tove and raw good and evil it's it's
[2:29:39] good it's
[2:29:42] delightsome to be bringing to maturity
[2:29:44] and manifestation what God has planted
[2:29:47] in you but not to do that is not
[2:29:51] bad are you watching
[2:29:54] me I have on a new
[2:29:57] tie you need to look at
[2:30:00] it it's very
[2:30:04] sharp it's not good and bad
[2:30:09] it's Tove and raw are evil it's evil can
[2:30:15] I tell you that it's evil according to
[2:30:17] God's word it's evil if you're living
[2:30:25] below the
[2:30:28] purpose that you were here to
[2:30:36] live if you get the
[2:30:39] wife and you get the
[2:30:43] life and you even get the white picket
[2:30:47] fence and you're living below what God
[2:30:51] birthed you into this world brought you
[2:30:53] into this world to be to manifest to
[2:30:56] display to
[2:30:59] represent you may have gotten all the
[2:31:01] other
[2:31:02] things you may have 30,000
[2:31:07] followers but you're taking them to the
[2:31:12] ditch you may have the admiration of
[2:31:15] your whole family or your whole church
[2:31:18] family but if if you're not bringing
[2:31:20] forth a portion of your destiny purpose
[2:31:23] God doesn't say that's
[2:31:26] bad help me he says it's
[2:31:30] evil that's why we that's why we preach
[2:31:34] we need the Zeal of building the Lord's
[2:31:39] House to consume us to devour us to eat
[2:31:42] us up until we stay constantly on guard
[2:31:47] guarding and keeping Above All Else
[2:31:50] yes sir guarding my heart my mind my
[2:31:53] will my
[2:31:56] emotions I dare say that most of us
[2:31:59] spend our lives following our
[2:32:03] emotions we make choices following our
[2:32:09] emotions we make decisions following our
[2:32:13] emotions hello our
[2:32:18] reactions follow
[2:32:20] how we
[2:32:22] feel I'm preaching to you you may be too
[2:32:26] tired to hear me but I'm
[2:32:31] preaching we Fellowship based on our
[2:32:36] prejudices Andor our
[2:32:38] jealousies Andor the things that are
[2:32:41] running a
[2:32:42] Muk we follow our emotions we're led by
[2:32:46] our feelings so many many many times
[2:32:53] she makes my heart go pitter patter he
[2:32:56] makes my heart it may be a it it it may
[2:32:59] be
[2:33:03] aib you may be out of static
[2:33:10] Rhythm I know she's the one because of
[2:33:12] how I feel how it makes me feel brother
[2:33:15] sister let me suggest that you take
[2:33:18] three tongs
[2:33:22] first before you make a decision based
[2:33:24] on
[2:33:25] a your heart doing a
[2:33:28] flip some people that happens to them
[2:33:31] they need to go right to the emergency
[2:33:32] room because it means something's really
[2:33:35] wrong we we we we take jobs
[2:33:41] we we we make friends we choose
[2:33:44] relationships based on how we feel what
[2:33:48] our emotions are
[2:33:50] we come to church if we feel like
[2:33:53] coming now we're having a particularly
[2:33:56] hard time
[2:34:01] folks I can say it but you won't believe
[2:34:04] it we are
[2:34:06] all in a
[2:34:11] battle I I'm being transparent when I
[2:34:14] tell you that there's seven days in a
[2:34:17] week and I had four four good
[2:34:23] days and
[2:34:25] three pretty crummy
[2:34:28] days but I'm here this
[2:34:31] morning not because I feel to be feel to
[2:34:35] be I I mean I do I I can't say that I
[2:34:38] did want to be here but I'm not always
[2:34:40] here because I feel like
[2:34:44] coming what if what if Sunday was one of
[2:34:46] my crummy days
[2:34:50] I I have to I have to come I cannot
[2:34:53] follow my feelings I cannot follow my
[2:34:57] emotions and to a certain extent you
[2:34:59] can't either because our emotions are
[2:35:02] not the
[2:35:03] enemy our emotions are something that
[2:35:06] God gave us to help us after we have
[2:35:10] made a good choice after we've made a
[2:35:14] decision by the leadership of the word
[2:35:16] and the spirit then we get the emotion
[2:35:19] to go with it but too many of us spiral
[2:35:22] into an emotional
[2:35:25] whirlpool and we make decisions based on
[2:35:28] the spiral instead of on the word come
[2:35:32] on
[2:35:33] now somebody say above all
[2:35:37] else I've got to guard my
[2:35:40] heart I can't live by my emotions I've
[2:35:44] got to live by the
[2:35:46] word see it
[2:35:52] I if I don't bring forth what God
[2:35:54] created me to bring forth he caused that
[2:36:04] evil I'm going to put this tree I wanted
[2:36:07] to talk about the two trees but I'll
[2:36:09] I'll put that away for another time I
[2:36:12] want to do one more little thing and and
[2:36:17] close in Proverbs 4:23 there let's go
[2:36:20] back to that verse just one more time
[2:36:22] charity would you just try to remind me
[2:36:24] that I I left out that section on the
[2:36:28] trees the tree of life and the tree of
[2:36:31] the knowledge of Good and Evil remember
[2:36:33] up to that point the only knowledge that
[2:36:36] Adam and Eve had was the knowledge of of
[2:36:39] that which was God of that which was
[2:36:42] good and they were better
[2:36:44] off we're better off without the
[2:36:47] knowledge of evil because once you begin
[2:36:49] to know what the opposite
[2:36:51] is the enemy tantalizes
[2:36:57] you he tries to lead us and lure us into
[2:37:01] the deeper consumption of the knowledge
[2:37:04] of that which is evil instead of that
[2:37:06] which is of god and good if you will eat
[2:37:09] of God and refuse to eat of the
[2:37:12] knowledge of
[2:37:13] evil if you'll refuse not to build your
[2:37:16] life on the smut and the stench of the
[2:37:21] world around you you you will continue
[2:37:23] to draw Your Life
[2:37:25] Source from Jesus who is the Tree of
[2:37:28] Life in in Proverbs 4:23 again it says
[2:37:31] keep thy heart with all
[2:37:37] diligence with all diligence is noted in
[2:37:40] the margin to be translated As Above All
[2:37:43] keeping above all keeping keep your
[2:37:47] heart it's a verb that means means to
[2:37:50] guard to keep to watch to observe to
[2:37:53] preserve it's very much like the word
[2:37:55] that was used when Adam was told to keep
[2:37:57] the garden stay with me to keep
[2:38:00] something in the in this sense means
[2:38:03] more than simply to maintain ownership
[2:38:05] listen it refers to maintenance care and
[2:38:09] support to keep your heart to guard your
[2:38:13] heart doesn't just mean Own
[2:38:15] It it means keep it healthy yes keep it
[2:38:20] protected keep it
[2:38:24] maintained sometimes when people are
[2:38:26] talking about guarding their heart they
[2:38:28] mean you've been hurt don't put yourself
[2:38:30] out there again that's dumb
[2:38:35] advice you can't live in a cave will the
[2:38:39] person in this room that's never been
[2:38:43] hurt never had your feelings hurt will
[2:38:46] you stand up
[2:38:49] you can't even hold up
[2:38:53] Eliana because she's not quite six
[2:38:56] months old and and and and if you were
[2:38:58] to tell her no real
[2:39:00] Stern or take something away from her
[2:39:03] and say no you'd H her
[2:39:07] feelings her daddy came in the room last
[2:39:10] night in the living room and handed her
[2:39:11] to me and and she smiled at me real big
[2:39:14] and then turned and watched him walk out
[2:39:16] of the room and she was not happy she
[2:39:18] wanted her daddy he hurt her
[2:39:22] feelings not on purpose but he hurt her
[2:39:25] feeling there's nobody in this room that
[2:39:28] hasn't had their feelings hurt you can't
[2:39:30] go live in a cave guarding your heart
[2:39:33] doesn't mean not putting yourself in
[2:39:36] life it doesn't mean hiding from
[2:39:39] folk it doesn't mean living in a
[2:39:45] cave it doesn't mean never coming to
[2:39:47] fellowships
[2:39:49] it doesn't mean never eating with the
[2:39:52] Saints that's not guarding your
[2:39:55] heart that's pulling yourself
[2:39:58] away from one of your life sources
[2:40:01] because we not only get life and
[2:40:04] strength and health from the from the
[2:40:07] root we get it by being intertwined with
[2:40:11] other

[2:41:08] manipulation don't guilt
[2:41:10] me I'm a busy man don't guilt me into
[2:41:14] something that's manipulation it's a
[2:41:17] form of Witchcraft it's evil it's the
[2:41:19] devil it's
[2:41:23] demonic if a husband has to guilt his
[2:41:26] wife that's demonic if a wife has to

[2:42:07] [Music]
[2:42:09] no you know what one of the first words
[2:42:11] a baby says it's not mama or da da
[2:42:14] that's the only one we tell
[2:42:17] people some times the first word is
[2:42:20] no cuz that's the word they hear the
[2:42:24] most sometimes we need to say
[2:42:27] it sometimes we need to even say it to
[2:42:32] ourselves I'm past my limit my tank is
[2:42:35] empty my strength is gone my energy is
[2:42:38] drained
[2:42:43] no because above all
[2:42:47] else I know you're too I I know I
[2:42:51] know
[2:42:53] diligently guard your
[2:42:55] heart in order to speak to the person
[2:42:58] that I had this little thing about and
[2:43:00] and I believe it was for every one of us
[2:43:02] I do but I believe it was specific to
[2:43:04] this individual as well I looked up this
[2:43:07] this word this uh verse in in a couple
[2:43:10] of other and I want to give them to you
[2:43:12] and and then and then unfortunately I
[2:43:14] have to close in the Amplified it says
[2:43:18] keep and guard your heart Proverbs
[2:43:22] 4:23 with all
[2:43:28] vigilance and above
[2:43:30] all that you
[2:43:34] guard
[2:43:36] Vigilant that means to be
[2:43:39] awake
[2:43:44] uhoh I better have some
[2:43:47] water CU there's only a handful of
[2:43:49] vigilant people here this
[2:43:54] morning
[2:43:57] alert well I hear
[2:44:00] you brother Billy can can I make fun of
[2:44:05] you I got a sweet nice text from Sister
[2:44:08] Laurel I asked to be notified when
[2:44:11] brother Billy came through surgery and
[2:44:13] she'd let me know the doctors reached
[2:44:15] out and he's going to be fine and it was
[2:44:17] it wasn't even I mean it was just a very
[2:44:19] short time the phone rang I saw it
[2:44:21] brother Billy and I took it and I said
[2:44:23] hello he's hello brother
[2:44:30] shall he was
[2:44:34] awake but he wasn't
[2:44:41] alert he was aware enough to remind me
[2:44:45] of of something that we had talked about
[2:44:49] but after that I Saidi going to let you
[2:44:51] go I think you need some around oh
[2:44:56] okay kind of reminded me of Otis if you
[2:44:59] don't know who Otis
[2:45:04] is you can be sitting in a service
[2:45:08] awake and not
[2:45:10] [Music]
[2:45:12] alert vigilance is defined as the action
[2:45:16] or state of keeping careful watch for
[2:45:19] possible danger or difficulty that's
[2:45:22] exactly what God calls us to do with our
[2:45:25] hearts be
[2:45:29] vigilant be
[2:45:31] alert because
[2:45:33] your
[2:45:37] adversary a and then let me give them
[2:45:39] give them this verse it's musicians
[2:45:41] start to come Proverbs 423 in the
[2:45:43] complete Jewish Bible because this is
[2:45:46] the one that settled it for me
[2:45:53] above everything else guard your
[2:45:57] heart would you all read that for me
[2:46:02] for let's do it one more time for it is
[2:46:05] the SCE of consquences can can we do it
[2:46:10] one more time for it is the source of
[2:46:15] consquences
[2:46:23] who can who who uh ellias say that out
[2:46:26] loud for me again would you for it
[2:46:39] is for out of
[2:46:42] it are the issues of
[2:46:46] life for out of the heart
[2:46:50] out of the abundance of the
[2:46:51] heart the mouth
[2:46:53] talks whatever's on your
[2:47:01] mind it's not so hard listen to me it's
[2:47:05] not so hard to know how much time
[2:47:06] someone's spending in the
[2:47:10] word all you have to do is listen to
[2:47:12] them
[2:47:14] talk doesn't make them bad it makes them
[2:47:17] actually worse than bad it makes them e
[2:47:20] evil because if all we're talking about
[2:47:23] is what the world is talking about it
[2:47:25] means we couldn't possibly be bringing
[2:47:27] forth the
[2:47:30] seed so it's more than just bad bad
[2:47:33] company it's almost evil now it does
[2:47:36] please I know there's a couple of folks
[2:47:38] that have a tendency to move toward the
[2:47:40] religious
[2:47:41] side so for you let me be careful to say
[2:47:45] that God doesn't
[2:47:47] care he is not not
[2:47:49] offended that you sometimes play Dutch
[2:47:56] Blitz you are not
[2:48:02] evil you are not evil because you go and
[2:48:06] and play a around of of disc golf I like
[2:48:09] to call it
[2:48:12] frisbee that's not of itself evil
[2:48:18] if you're constantly leaving your wife
[2:48:20] and children to do it without spending
[2:48:23] ample time with them you're moving
[2:48:25] toward
[2:48:28] evil because if you were able to produce
[2:48:31] a son or
[2:48:32] daughter or at least do your part as a
[2:48:36] man then you have as part of the siege
[2:48:39] of your destiny the
[2:48:41] responsibility of leading them to Christ
[2:48:44] not
[2:48:46] once all the time every day so everybody
[2:48:51] needs that break and that male bonding
[2:48:54] time but if that becomes all you talk
[2:49:01] about college football
[2:49:05] is it's a
[2:49:07] religion in the
[2:49:11] South I don't think God is offended if
[2:49:14] you happen to know who's winning
[2:49:17] or I I don't think God is offended if
[2:49:20] you happen to wear
[2:49:22] a orange tie
[2:49:28] or long as it's not for
[2:49:33] Tennessee but if that's all you talk
[2:49:35] about you see out of the abundance of
[2:49:38] the heart the
[2:49:41] mind the will the emotions the mouth
[2:49:46] speaks so whatever your heart is filled
[2:49:50] with and that's why you walk up to
[2:49:52] somebody and you
[2:49:54] spew about what's on your
[2:49:57] mind and sometimes you walk
[2:50:00] away without ever asking them how they
[2:50:03] feel or how they're doing or is there
[2:50:06] anything you can pray with them
[2:50:08] about because your mind your heart is
[2:50:10] filled with your
[2:50:12] problem and that's all you can see at
[2:50:14] the moment and that's all you want to
[2:50:16] talk about
[2:50:19] if you have daddy issues
[2:50:22] or uh you know past divorce
[2:50:28] or if that permeates your
[2:50:33] conversation there's too much of that in
[2:50:35] your
[2:50:42] garden if you're hearing someone's
[2:50:46] hurt and that immediately starts you you
[2:50:50] know your computer calculating your
[2:50:54] hurts and before you can even really pay
[2:50:57] attention to their problem their pain or
[2:51:00] speak any Word of Life to them you're
[2:51:03] already
[2:51:05] comparing your pain with their pain then
[2:51:09] your garden is crowded
[2:51:21] and above all
[2:51:22] else with vigilance and
[2:51:27] diligence guard your heart for it is the
[2:51:33] source of life's
[2:51:37] consequences decisions that we make in
[2:51:40] our heart with in our mind in a garden
[2:51:43] that's overgrown and
[2:51:46] crowded are going to be influenced by
[2:51:49] the by the stuff so we're going to make
[2:51:53] decisions based on what's growing in the
[2:51:57] garden we're going to speak based on
[2:52:00] what's growing in the
[2:52:05] garden well the potatoes were
[2:52:10] overcooked the meat was
[2:52:13] tough the row was
[2:52:17] stale the but butter was
[2:52:23] plastic well how was the
[2:52:31] napkin oh it was
[2:52:35] fine how was the water was the water
[2:52:38] okay well the glass was a little
[2:52:41] dirty some of our Gardens are just full
[2:52:45] of so many wrongs that have been done to
[2:52:48] us and so many complaints through the
[2:52:50] years and so much negative that we see
[2:52:54] negative
[2:52:56] First and positive last in every
[2:53:01] situation Lord will you walk through the
[2:53:03] garden of my heart
[2:53:11] again Daniel
[2:53:14] skipworth did some gardening work for me
[2:53:16] you know he worked at a
[2:53:20] lawn in garden and all of a sudden if
[2:53:22] you know Daniel you know his personality
[2:53:24] and all of a sudden he was a
[2:53:27] horticulturist I liked it it was very
[2:53:31] beneficial and uh the palm trees in my
[2:53:34] yard that started out about that tall
[2:53:36] and now they're very high Daniel and I
[2:53:39] planted those and they were hard to
[2:53:42] plant and he said brother Shelly while
[2:53:44] you're doing such and such he said I'm
[2:53:46] going to run up front and I'm going to
[2:53:48] I'm going to pull some weeds out of the
[2:53:49] front bed oh you of by all means go do
[2:53:56] it and he went and did he come out and
[2:53:58] he said I'm done now we can finish thus
[2:54:00] thus and
[2:54:01] thus a few days later I I happened to be
[2:54:04] walking across the front of the yard and
[2:54:07] I looked in the garden bed and I said
[2:54:16] no sister Doris's
[2:54:19] flowers she gave me these flowers sister
[2:54:22] Flo and I planted and Daniel has weeded
[2:54:25] them
[2:54:28] all thank the lord it's happened more
[2:54:31] than once my wife cleaned me out one
[2:54:35] year but they're they're not fancy
[2:54:38] flowers They're amazing flowers that pop
[2:54:41] up everywhere and you have to pull a
[2:54:43] Chad you probably did it
[2:54:47] too there amazing you think you've got
[2:54:49] them on you'll never get one back but
[2:54:51] the next year they're somewhere else in
[2:54:52] the yard just go dig them up and bring
[2:54:53] them cuz they're everywhere but I didn't
[2:54:55] know that in the beginning you see you
[2:54:58] need the Lord's
[2:54:59] help to show you what is a
[2:55:03] weed and what's a seed of your
[2:55:06] destiny cuz if it's supposed to be there
[2:55:08] you want it to be there may not be
[2:55:10] pretty right
[2:55:11] now it may just be a a
[2:55:14] scrawny
[2:55:16] stem but if God God wants it there one
[2:55:19] of these
[2:55:21] days he's going to look at it and it's
[2:55:23] going to be beautiful he's going to
[2:55:25] bless it and it's going to
[2:55:27] Blossom because that's a part of what
[2:55:29] he's planted in you if you just do it by
[2:55:32] your own Vision if you do it by your own
[2:55:34] feeling if you do it by your own thought
[2:55:37] you're liable to uproot something that
[2:55:41] God has put there and folks I'm closing
[2:55:44] but it might even be a thorn in in your
[2:55:52] flesh who wouldn't want to pull up a
[2:55:55] thorny
[2:56:00] Bush who wouldn't want to yank something
[2:56:02] out if you poked yourself a time or two
[2:56:06] we have haven't we in
[2:56:10] gardening who wouldn't want to get rid
[2:56:12] of that so you never had to feel that
[2:56:14] pain again but what you may not realize
[2:56:16] is God placed that that thorn
[2:56:19] there to find your
[2:56:23] flesh the preacher's
[2:56:27] preaching I was I'm talking about him
[2:56:30] you
[2:56:32] know he may have placed that there so
[2:56:35] that you would be able to quickly
[2:56:37] readily find your flesh and identify the
[2:56:40] desire of the
[2:56:42] flesh but it's there and it may not be
[2:56:45] beautiful to you I remember time that I
[2:56:48] used to think that succulents were some
[2:56:50] of the ugliest plants that i' have ever
[2:56:53] seen and now I like them a lot I think
[2:56:55] they're beautiful
[2:56:58] plants I just needed to understand a
[2:57:01] little bit more about
[2:57:02] them sometimes that thing that God has
[2:57:05] placed allowed to be placed in your
[2:57:07] heart sewn into your heart even that you
[2:57:09] don't understand because it doesn't look
[2:57:12] like the other things in your life that
[2:57:14] are flourishing if God put it there you
[2:57:17] want to leave it there the only way to
[2:57:19] know the difference is to keep inviting
[2:57:21] him to have fellowship with you in the
[2:57:23] garden of your heart come back lord walk
[2:57:26] with me again through the Garden Of My
[2:57:30] Heart Lord show me the prickly things
[2:57:33] that need to go and show me the prickly
[2:57:36] things that need to
[2:57:41] stay show me the things that I chopped
[2:57:45] off but the root remained
[2:57:49] a a visiting preacher came through and
[2:57:52] gave me a word or preached an inspiring
[2:57:54] sermon and I I went to my garden with
[2:57:57] with whackers and I whacked it all down
[2:58:00] but nobody seemed to tell me I didn't
[2:58:03] know that I was supposed to dig at the
[2:58:06] very root of it until it
[2:58:10] hurt because I
[2:58:13] didn't it keeps sprouting
[2:58:17] up I need you Lord to walk with me you
[2:58:20] show me you point out to me the things
[2:58:23] that need to die by the root father give
[2:58:26] me Grace to separate those ugly things
[2:58:28] from their life Source Above All Else
[2:58:31] Lord give me wisdom and discernment to
[2:58:34] guard and keep my heart this is a wicked
[2:58:37] hour this is a wicked day but the bride
[2:58:39] of Christ is moving toward the headstone
[2:58:43] we're coming up into the stature of a
[2:58:45] perfect man and you have said to this
[2:58:48] body today above all else we must be
[2:58:52] Watchmen on the wall not only to help
[2:58:55] protect each other but even
[2:58:59] ourselves Lord take me high enough
[2:59:02] sometime to see my own
[2:59:10] heart may I stop making decisions based
[2:59:14] on
[2:59:15] emotion and seek your word
[2:59:24] Lord may I quit making excuses God
[2:59:26] didn't tell me what to do when your word
[2:59:28] is full your word is full of what to
[2:59:32] do and I keep turning a blind eye to the
[2:59:36] symbolism and the richness of scripture
[2:59:39] I dismiss it because I don't want it to
[2:59:41] have anything to do with my life and yet
[2:59:43] you keep bringing me back to that
[2:59:45] scripture to remind me there is my
[2:59:48] answer there is my answer and I keep
[2:59:51] stepping on my
[2:59:55] answer like brother Bobby says don't
[2:59:57] play the dumb act sometime we play the
[3:00:00] dumb act we do know what God wants from
[3:00:04] us we do know what you want
[3:00:07] Lord but sometimes we pre pretend to be
[3:00:10] ignorant because we know the cost is too
[3:00:15] great Lord help us to be willing
[3:00:19] cut out the bitterness of of the past
[3:00:23] and and live in the
[3:00:26] now Above All Else above all else may we
[3:00:30] be vigilant may we be
[3:00:37] determined to guard our
[3:00:40] heart to control our
[3:00:44] emotions to deal with our thoughts
[3:00:48] if the heart is is our mind spiritually
[3:00:52] then it doesn't start with our words it
[3:00:54] starts with our
[3:01:00] thoughts may I have the mind of
[3:01:06] Christ may I pray until I have the mind
[3:01:10] of
[3:01:15] Christ Lord let the Zeal
[3:01:19] of building you a house consume me until
[3:01:21] there is nothing left but an eternal
[3:01:30] yes may I stop doctoring
[3:01:33] history and rewriting my
[3:01:37] past and just dig it up by the root and
[3:01:41] be rid of it
[3:01:49] I've tried tending to my garden
[3:01:52] alone and I keep making
[3:01:58] mistakes walk through my heart with me
[3:02:04] Lord I don't want to keep something
[3:02:07] based on
[3:02:08] fondness that needs to
[3:02:13] go if you really didn't want any of
[3:02:15] sister dar's flowers in my garden I
[3:02:18] don't
[3:02:20] either I don't want anything hanging
[3:02:23] around taking up space affecting my
[3:02:29] fruitfulness I've got to have a garden
[3:02:31] that you want to spend time with me
[3:02:34] in above all
[3:02:37] else I Repent oh God for letting
[3:02:42] down my own guard and I ask for your
[3:02:45] strength to be vigilant on the wall
[3:02:49] watching after my own thought
[3:02:57] life we're depending on you
[3:03:03] Jesus let's stand
[3:03:06] together we're depending on you
[3:03:13] Jesus I want to be
[3:03:16] used in the service of the
[3:03:19] Lord how many of you
[3:03:22] really don't just jump on the bandwagon
[3:03:25] because somebody on your road
[3:03:27] did how many of you really desire to be
[3:03:31] used in the service of the Lord hold up
[3:03:34] your hand to
[3:03:39] him salvation to you is
[3:03:43] free but in order to be used in the
[3:03:45] service of the lord it's going to cost
[3:03:47] you everything everything everything
[3:03:50] everything
[3:03:51] everything
[3:03:54] everything everything
[3:03:59] familiar the ly wolf song that we sing
[3:04:02] sometime we're not going to sing it just
[3:04:04] now but we sing it
[3:04:06] sometime take my houses and lands change
[3:04:10] my dreams and my plans I'm placing my
[3:04:14] whole life in your hands and whatever it
[3:04:18] takes for my will to
[3:04:21] break that's what I'll be willing to
[3:04:25] do take the dearest things to
[3:04:29] me if that's how it must
[3:04:32] be to Draw Me Closer to
[3:04:36] You hard
[3:04:38] words hard
[3:04:40] reality I mentioned recently it cost
[3:04:43] brother brandham his first wife and his
[3:04:46] baby girl
[3:04:49] he let the influence of his
[3:04:51] mother-in-law separate him from the call
[3:04:54] to
[3:04:56] go and it cost
[3:05:00] him he thought losing his chair was the
[3:05:03] only
[3:05:05] penalty but he lost more than his
[3:05:07] favorite
[3:05:12] chair and one day after she's gone
[3:05:18] he's visiting her grave in the
[3:05:23] cemetery and just like that she steps
[3:05:26] out from behind a
[3:05:33] tree some people in the modern Church
[3:05:35] would call that
[3:05:38] necromancy I call it the grace of
[3:05:41] God who thinned the veil and let brother
[3:05:45] brandham catch a glimpse
[3:05:48] and she spoke to
[3:05:51] him comforted his heart we're we're
[3:05:55] we're
[3:05:58] okay you better do what you're called to
[3:06:03] do God cared so
[3:06:08] much the price was great but God's Great
[3:06:11] Grace and
[3:06:13] comfort wanted to take him to the next
[3:06:16] level I've got to go I have to go to the
[3:06:19] next
[3:06:22] level let's let's come around the altar
[3:06:25] this morning and stand for just a moment
[3:06:27] and we're we I'm I'm I've slowed down to
[3:06:29] nearly a crawl and I'm going to get out
[3:06:31] of the way but but before I do I I want
[3:06:35] us to sing this little song before
[3:06:37] Benjamin comes and Lead leads us in
[3:06:39] worship I want us to sing the old song
[3:06:41] Jesus used me I I want to be usable and
[3:06:45] I I can't be usable if my heart is
[3:06:50] overcrowded by the past if it's
[3:06:53] overcrowded by unforgiveness or
[3:06:56] bitterness or
[3:06:57] resentment it chokes out the good seed
[3:07:00] again and again and again I need to do
[3:07:02] some some some pulling up and digging
[3:07:06] out and and then I need to be a better
[3:07:08] guard I need to be a better
[3:07:12] Watchman I need to not only guard my
[3:07:15] heart but then I have to see about my
[3:07:18] eyes and my
[3:07:20] lips and my
[3:07:24] feet Proverbs that verse goes on to tell
[3:07:28] us if you're willing if you're willing
[3:07:31] to be used if you think it's going to be
[3:07:33] all easy we you should know better by

[3:16:18] oh Jesus
[3:16:23] Messiah you are the Lord of all the Lord
[3:16:27] of
[3:16:29] all now sometimes getting a glimpse of
[3:16:33] your garden can be a little
[3:16:37] overwhelming that's why mine looks like
[3:16:39] it does in the
[3:16:41] natural because if you let it go too
[3:16:43] long it has a life of its own
[3:16:47] that can be discouraging and
[3:16:48] overwhelming especially in a time when
[3:16:50] you're already dealing with strong
[3:16:52] emotions but here's what you have to
[3:16:54] remember you are not just a church
[3:16:57] member somewhere you're a Son of God I
[3:17:01] am a Son of God let me hear you say it I
[3:17:04] am a Son of God that's all of us isn't
[3:17:06] it not just men but I am a Son of God
[3:17:10] and because of that the blood does more
[3:17:13] than just save you or become some reconc
[3:17:17] ilation for you it redeems you and it
[3:17:19] takes you all the way back to the
[3:17:22] original thoughts of God concerning your
[3:17:26] life and even when you have let your
[3:17:28] inner man become a
[3:17:31] jungle your relationship as a son does
[3:17:34] not
[3:17:36] change it greatly affects your
[3:17:39] fellowship because he no longer has
[3:17:42] freedom to come and walk with you in the
[3:17:43] cool of the evening in the garden of
[3:17:45] your heart
[3:17:48] you have to invite him to come to point
[3:17:50] out the mess the stuff that has to go
[3:17:53] and maybe even before you can do that
[3:17:56] you've got to you've got to remove some
[3:17:57] stuff you know about cuz there may be
[3:18:00] some things we know that's growing that
[3:18:02] we need to get rid of don't even need
[3:18:04] the Lord to point it out we could make
[3:18:06] some room for him to
[3:18:09] come he does that because he loves
[3:18:12] you and you caring about your heart
[3:18:16] remember that's not
[3:18:18] toil that's not heavy labor or fleshly
[3:18:22] striving the Bible calls it
[3:18:25] Worship You caring about guarding and
[3:18:28] keeping your heart becomes an effort of
[3:18:32] cultivation that is not toil or sweaty
[3:18:36] labor but it's worship to the Lord the
[3:18:39] fact that you would come before him
[3:18:41] today and ask for his help to to clean
[3:18:45] out your heart
[3:18:47] to get rid of some of the thoughts that
[3:18:49] need to go and then invite him to have
[3:18:52] fellowship with you there to him that's
[3:18:55] worship he sees your desire to worship
[3:18:59] as more important than the particular
[3:19:02] details of what needs to be dealt with
[3:19:05] so don't stand here guilty and feeling
[3:19:09] condemned because you've let some things
[3:19:12] go that you should have dug out a long
[3:19:14] time ago make up your your mind today
[3:19:17] that you're going to move forward in a
[3:19:19] worshipful attitude to start cultivating
[3:19:23] and taking care of some of the things
[3:19:26] that you've let grow there too long and
[3:19:29] then eventually you're going to have
[3:19:30] room for him to come and have great
[3:19:33] fellowship with you there you're going
[3:19:35] to need the
[3:19:36] Lord we're going to need the Lord in the
[3:19:40] days ahead we're going to need not only
[3:19:43] relationship but we're going to need
[3:19:45] Fellowship like we've never needed it
[3:19:49] before when you feel like there's nobody
[3:19:52] else let me tell you something he
[3:19:55] desires to be for you more than enough
[3:20:00] can anybody testify that in that moment
[3:20:03] he is more than enough his grace
[3:20:08] remember that thorny Bush that you
[3:20:10] wanted to get rid of and God wouldn't
[3:20:12] move it and he wouldn't help you move it
[3:20:14] remember what he said my my
[3:20:18] grace my grace is
[3:20:21] sufficient you leave it right there
[3:20:23] that's to make sure that you don't
[3:20:25] become exalted in your bride
[3:20:27] Pride that's for you to know that your
[3:20:30] flesh is still alive and it has to be
[3:20:33] dealt with every day that thorn in the
[3:20:35] flesh that the Apostle had everybody's
[3:20:38] got something like that but remember his
[3:20:40] grace Lord your
[3:20:43] grace is sufficient so we stand here
[3:20:47] today not
[3:20:50] condemned hopefully
[3:20:52] convicted and now we offer to you our
[3:20:55] sincerest worship come Lord and give us
[3:20:59] Grace to get her done may we not put it
[3:21:03] off another hour may we not put it off
[3:21:06] another minute one of the things that I
[3:21:10] didn't get to was a quote where brother
[3:21:13] brandham said if you have one
[3:21:18] ought in your heart against
[3:21:22] anybody you're in danger of
[3:21:25] Hellfire now that's a pretty strong
[3:21:29] warning if you stand here today and
[3:21:32] there's odd in your
[3:21:34] heart that lays there toward somebody
[3:21:38] today you tell the Lord I need your help
[3:21:42] but I am serving an eviction notice on
[3:21:46] that ought on that
[3:21:49] thought that is not right that is not
[3:21:53] wholesome that is not healthy that is
[3:21:55] not true I don't want that odd in my
[3:21:58] heart I want it out and I'm asking you
[3:22:01] Lord to come even now with your grace
[3:22:04] give me strength to drive it out of the
[3:22:08] garden give me strength to separate it
[3:22:11] from my heart would you just maybe put
[3:22:13] your hand on somebody next to you right
[3:22:15] now and and uh uh maybe your their
[3:22:18] shoulder and and just agree with them
[3:22:21] you don't have to pray some fancy prayer
[3:22:23] but let's just agree right now that
[3:22:26] we're going to make worship this worship
[3:22:29] of important part cultivating and
[3:22:32] keeping and guarding watching for
[3:22:35] thoughts that need to be cast
[3:22:38] down watching for words that come out of
[3:22:41] the abundance of our heart that we
[3:22:44] really don't want to speak because
[3:22:46] they're death and darkness and Shadow
[3:22:48] instead of love and light father help us
[3:22:51] put a watch over our heart and to stay
[3:22:53] on our lips but that's not totally your
[3:22:56] responsibility because you told us that
[3:22:59] we should exercise Temperance as one of
[3:23:01] the fruits of the spirit and that we
[3:23:04] should be able to show and exercise
[3:23:06] self-control over our own emotions our
[3:23:09] thoughts and our words Lord would you
[3:23:11] let us begin to bring forth the fruit of
[3:23:14] of temperance in our lives longsuffering
[3:23:17] and meekness and Lord may we be able
[3:23:21] today to see that this is not an
[3:23:24] undoable task this is a task that we
[3:23:27] just have gotten slack in raise us up
[3:23:30] and remind us that we don't have to do
[3:23:33] this alone it's your desire to help us
[3:23:37] with the inner troubles father right now
[3:23:39] strengthen my brother strengthen my
[3:23:42] sister in the name of Jesus remind them
[3:23:47] right now who they are remind them lord
[3:23:50] of the Revelation that has set them
[3:23:53] apart Hallelujah remind them of their
[3:23:56] identification in
[3:23:59] Christ remind us that we were in you
[3:24:03] when you suffered in you when your flesh
[3:24:06] died in you when you resurrected to life
[3:24:10] and because of those
[3:24:12] promises you see the bride of Christ
[3:24:15] that's another people that just serve
[3:24:17] him when things are going
[3:24:19] well that little bride serves him and
[3:24:22] loves him in every circumstance of life
[3:24:26] because she's a part of him she came
[3:24:29] from him to neglect him would be to even
[3:24:33] neglect who she is awaken us awaken us
[3:24:39] to a fresh reality of who you are in our
[3:24:42] lives break the hold of the enemy on our
[3:24:48] thoughts in the name of Jesus we call
[3:24:52] death upon every thought that seeks to
[3:24:56] separate us from our Liberty in Christ
[3:24:59] we call death to it the end to it in the
[3:25:02] name of Jesus we take the axe to the
[3:25:06] root of that thought that tries to exalt
[3:25:10] itself and take preeminence in our heart
[3:25:13] only Jesus there's only room for Jesus
[3:25:17] on the throne of preeminence come and
[3:25:20] sit Lord on the throne of preeminence in
[3:25:23] our life and Rule and Reign strengthen
