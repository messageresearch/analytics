TRANSCRIPT
========================================
It's about hearing what Jesus preached. Somebody said, "What did Jesus preach?" Uh, he preached to them that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning him. All of it. How many of you know there was no New Testament yet? He was preaching from the scripture, from the law, from the law, from the five books of Moses, from the prophets, from the Psalms, the poetic book, and on and on and on. It's not about making anyone culturally Jewish. It's about getting a greater understanding of who the Messiah is and what his birth, ministry, and death, resurrection, what it has really meant to us and what it means to us that he fulfilled it all. But I'd like to know, what did the Passover mean? And how is it that Jesus fulfilled it? Well, I'm not going to spend the rest of my life studying Easter because I know that Jesus had nothing to do and never has had anything and never will have anything to do with Easter. So why would I spend my life embracing, studying, researching Easter? But when I find that there is something that points me and that I might possibly have the opportunity to understand more about the image by looking at the shadow, especially when the shadow is in the word. It takes an image to cast a shadow. It takes an image in the light to cast a shadow. So the shadow is similar to the image, but it's not something that would give you as full or as complete of a picture. It's only a silhouette or an outline. It's a shadow. Do you understand? But there has to be an image. And there has to be an image in the presence of light to be able to cast a shadow. That makes that verse live. For we have a shadow. We have something that has been cast by an image in the light of good things to come. Don't judge people in meat or drink or holy days or new moons. Don't do that. These are shadows of things to come. And when the real comes, when the real image comes instead of the shadow, you will understand more completely and perfectly the shadow. And then you will see how that God is perfect. I want to present to you again a God who is perfect in all of his ways. A God who never makes a mistake. A God who never changes his mind about anything concerning his word. But the reality is, who in this world would want to hang to the shadow when you can hang to the image that produced the shadow? It's Jesus Christ. the same yesterday, today, and forever. But if there's something that we could use, study, pray about that would help us to understand the image more, then what would that be? It would be what the scripture calls shadows, types, symbols. Once you understand what the feast are, you can understand how Jesus fulfilled them. It doesn't matter how many times we returned to animal sacrifice. It doesn't matter how many years animal offerings were in place. None of those animals could atone for the sins of mankind. They were only a symbol of an offering given to God so that God would appease be appeased is what many people uh seem to look at it. But it's really saying, I I I thank you that you've given me a way to separate myself from my own behavior, from my own actions. But the blood of an animal only covered the surface of the sin. It never addressed the issue and it never brought full redemption or atonement. How many of you glad that the blood that Jesus shed for us was God's blood created specifically for the purpose of redemption? And it didn't just cover sin. What did it do? It remitted it. It brought us to what? Justification. And justification is boiling it down. Just if I'd never sin. Brother Brandham said, "You never did it. You never did it in the first place. It has been totally annihilated from the mind of God. Not just covered, undone, dissolved. Praise God. It does not exist.
