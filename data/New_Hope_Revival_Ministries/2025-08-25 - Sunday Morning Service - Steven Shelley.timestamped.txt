[44:26] I'll always be fascinated by your last
[44:29] prayer
[44:31] that you wanted most of all
[44:34] &gt;&gt; to be one with us.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And now it's crying out inside of us too
[44:43] to be one with you and to be where you

[45:01] lay our life before you.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Let your will be done in us.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; According to your perfect plan,
[45:11] &gt;&gt; you know everything that is within us.
[45:16] That we can't overcome on our own, but
[45:20] it's because of you. You had confidence
[45:24] in your own blood.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; So, we're putting our confidence in your
[45:28] blood.
[45:30] [Music]
[45:31] What a plan.
[45:35] It's your life flowing through us.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; As we've heard, it's your heartbeat that
[45:43] we're longing for.
[45:45] So father we just commit everything that
[45:47] we are
[45:49] &gt;&gt; emotionally spiritually physically we
[45:52] just commit that before you
[45:56] without hesitation or qualification we

[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; because you have come.
[1:08:52] And we say come closer Lord.
[1:08:55] We say b
[1:09:02] come closer Lord.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Minister to every heart.
[1:09:10] Put your finger on every need right now.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:42] Lord, if you if you need to be seated,
[1:09:45] you certainly can. I know you've been
[1:09:47] standing a long time. You can worship
[1:09:50] sitting down.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; We love you today, Lord.
[1:09:56] We don't want to miss you.
[1:09:58] We don't want to get ahead of you. We
[1:10:00] don't want to drag behind you.
[1:10:03] We want to walk with you, Lord.
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:11] You didn't just want to lead us. You
[1:10:13] wanted to walk with us.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; You wanted to walk hand in hand with us,
[1:10:20] Lord.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; You've identified yourself as a
[1:10:26] co-inheritor,
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; heirs of the father, joint hes with
[1:10:34] Jesus.
[1:10:36] Lord, that's who we are.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; What does it mean joint hes with you? My
[1:10:45] equal. It's an equal portion.
[1:10:50] This was your desire from the beginning
[1:10:53] to have a bride in the last days
[1:10:56] that you could pour an equal portion
[1:11:00] of who you are into them
[1:11:03] and they would make right choices in
[1:11:06] preparation for such a union, a holy
[1:11:11] union.
[1:11:13] It's so holy and so complete that many
[1:11:16] Christians find it
[1:11:20] almost offensive.
[1:11:24] There are some even here today who find
[1:11:26] it just too much work.
[1:11:30] Lord, convict our hearts.
[1:11:35] Convict our hearts, Lord, that we would
[1:11:38] realize that there is no price too great
[1:11:42] that we would win, that we would have
[1:11:46] union,
[1:11:48] oneness
[1:11:49] with you. Yes.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; May we have strength to quieten our own
[1:12:02] thoughts, our own minds.
[1:12:08] There will be a bride
[1:12:10] who has your leadership.
[1:12:14] one that you won't even have to speak
[1:12:16] to,
[1:12:19] but you will guide us with your eye.
[1:12:24] We will know you and know so much about
[1:12:26] you, and we will have experienced so
[1:12:29] much of our precious bridegroom, King,
[1:12:36] that we'll know what you want.
[1:12:40] And that's why you could trust that
[1:12:42] bride with thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:12:47] This was the promise of the last of the
[1:12:49] last days that you would have a people,
[1:12:52] a bride who would not move
[1:12:55] unless she had thus saith the Lord.
[1:13:01] That wasn't just through one man. It was
[1:13:04] her being your voice, your microphone,
[1:13:08] your amplifier.
[1:13:10] to a world that's sick and dying.
[1:13:20] We bless your name.
[1:13:23] You alone are worthy.
[1:13:26] Father, even folk like us can get
[1:13:31] churchy.
[1:13:33] We can get to a place where we just
[1:13:36] barely make it through the motions.
[1:13:40] And then suddenly you come.
[1:13:43] And then there's those who can't really
[1:13:46] enter in because they're worried.
[1:13:48] They're concerned about what some
[1:13:50] streamer is going to think.
[1:13:55] They're going to question church order.
[1:14:00] So we just say today, Lord, that every
[1:14:03] church is sovereign.
[1:14:07] You placed an authority in the church
[1:14:10] and we lean on that today.
[1:14:13] We'll do as you would desire and we'll
[1:14:16] follow your leadership.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; No matter who's watching,
[1:14:22] may your presence reach through,
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; minister to needs.
[1:14:28] Folks are pretty tired of church.
[1:14:31] They're looking for you to come and
[1:14:33] visit with us.
[1:14:36] We exalt you and we give you glory. We
[1:14:39] give you honor and we we give you time.
[1:14:50] We say have your way Lord. Your own way.
[1:14:54] Your way not ours.
[1:15:02] The Lord is good.
[1:15:06] The battle is over.
[1:15:10] Victory is one.
[1:15:14] It's already
[1:15:17] done.
[1:15:21] The battle is over.
[1:15:26] Victory is one.
[1:15:30] It's already
[1:15:32] done.
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:35] Just be seated a moment. Just be seated
[1:15:38] a moment. Now you've stood in his
[1:15:40] presence. Now sit in his presence for

[1:16:41] Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] [Music]

[1:16:52] When you say hallel hal is 10,000
[1:16:56] praises, multiplications of praises.
[1:17:00] many myriads, multitudes in Hebrew of
[1:17:04] praises. Hal
[1:17:07] unto unto and there's no J. It's Yah.
[1:17:13] So it's multiplied praises unto Yah,
[1:17:18] God,
[1:17:20] his holy sacred name. Sing it again now
[1:17:24] that you have been reminded what you're
[1:17:26] saying. Hallelujah.

[1:19:23] Don't we love him?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Why else would we choose this life
[1:19:34] if it wasn't because we loved him?
[1:19:44] Bless his name.
[1:19:47] Bless his name.
[1:20:02] The only real peace that I have,
[1:20:09] dear Lord, is in you.
[1:20:16] The only
[1:20:18] real peace
[1:20:21] that I have,
[1:20:24] dear Lord, is in you.
[1:20:31] With all life's frustrations,
[1:20:36] I need you.
[1:20:40] And I know I do. Cuz
[1:20:47] the only
[1:20:50] real peace
[1:20:52] that I have,
[1:20:56] dear Lord, is in you.
[1:21:02] The only
[1:21:05] real peace
[1:21:07] that I have,
[1:21:11] dear Lord, is in you.
[1:21:18] The only
[1:21:20] real peace
[1:21:23] that I have,

[1:21:53] real peace
[1:21:56] that I have,
[1:21:59] dear Lord, is in you.
[1:22:06] Yes. The only
[1:22:09] real peace
[1:22:12] that I have,
[1:22:15] dear Lord, is
[1:22:19] in you.
[1:22:21] [Music]
[1:22:24] Is that your testimony?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; I I said, is that your testimony?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe you find peace in something else.
[1:22:33] There's no peace in this world, but in
[1:22:35] him. Right?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, you get out in God's creation,
[1:22:39] you feel his presence, you feel peace.
[1:22:42] That's because he's there.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; It's not because the trees are pretty.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; It's because he's there. I feel him.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I felt his wonderful visitation through
[1:22:53] the night.
[1:22:55] And um I know that he's here and I know
[1:22:58] that he wants to speak to our hearts. I
[1:23:01] don't want to disturb him. But let's
[1:23:03] thank God for the musicians.
[1:23:06] We're so thankful for their labor among
[1:23:08] us.
[1:23:11] I don't want to scold you all in any
[1:23:13] way, but I'm going to ask you all to
[1:23:15] skip your coffee break. I'm going to ask
[1:23:18] you to go to the restroom and come on
[1:23:20] out here and be with us as quickly as
[1:23:21] you can simply because I don't want you
[1:23:24] to uh to spend any time outside of his
[1:23:29] presence if you can help it. Um, he is
[1:23:33] saturating somebody. I want to be that
[1:23:36] somebody. I want to be a sponge and soak
[1:23:39] it all in.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful Sunday for Christie to
[1:23:44] be with us today, Sister Williams's
[1:23:46] niece. And I say that because she's a
[1:23:49] worshshiper.
[1:23:51] She loves to worship. What a presence uh
[1:23:56] to for her today. And uh because it's
[1:24:00] her and she knows us and we know her and
[1:24:03] she knows the church, then we don't have
[1:24:04] to we don't have to put on airs. We can
[1:24:07] just be who we are in worship and she's
[1:24:09] just right there with us. Thank you so
[1:24:11] much for having that lovely spirit.
[1:24:13] We're glad you're here. Glad he's here.
[1:24:17] We did. We invited him, but we didn't
[1:24:18] have to. He was coming because we came.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He comes with us.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Uh we miss those who are not here today.
[1:24:26] We have quite a number of people out and
[1:24:29] sometimes I wish we had a a chat board
[1:24:32] or something where we could post in
[1:24:35] there and say I'm going to be out of
[1:24:37] town
[1:24:38] because then maybe somebody who uh had
[1:24:42] the thought, well, I don't know if
[1:24:44] anybody going to be gone, so I'll I'll
[1:24:46] go away this weekend. Well, if they knew
[1:24:48] maybe so many were going to be away,
[1:24:50] they they might would schedule a little
[1:24:52] differently. I don't know. But uh we it
[1:24:55] is what it is. God is good to us. We're
[1:24:59] not upset with people for for being
[1:25:01] away. No, not at all. In fact, I've
[1:25:04] stood in the gap uh two times
[1:25:08] uh this week even today asking the Lord
[1:25:12] just wait a little longer. He promised
[1:25:16] us he has promised us many great things
[1:25:19] and I wouldn't want anybody to miss it.
[1:25:22] Anybody understand? I would want
[1:25:24] everybody to be right in the middle of
[1:25:26] it. Let's stand if we can. And I'll tell
[1:25:32] you if I get the liberty,
[1:25:35] I'll share with you a couple things that
[1:25:38] he visited me with in the night. And I
[1:25:41] want Liberty to do it. And if he gives
[1:25:43] the liberty and you pull the liberty in,
[1:25:45] then we'll do it. If not, we'll hold it.
[1:25:48] But um God is good. Matthew chapter 13
[1:25:53] verse 34 and 35. We are still in a
[1:25:59] series
[1:26:01] of sermons.
[1:26:03] We are making our way from the vine to
[1:26:06] the king's table. from the choosing and
[1:26:09] washing and crushing of the grapes all
[1:26:12] the way through the processes of
[1:26:14] fermentation
[1:26:16] so that we can one day be wine in the
[1:26:19] chalice of the great king. And you sang
[1:26:23] about it today. Now on the pathway the
[1:26:26] wine press falls heavy, but it's
[1:26:29] bringing forth only the best of the
[1:26:32] wine.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Would you choose it any other way?
[1:26:36] Wouldn't you want to be the best of the
[1:26:38] best?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And the only way to do that is uh
[1:26:41] perhaps to be submitted. It the I think
[1:26:44] the verse goes on to say uh so into
[1:26:47] submission
[1:26:49] and and uh that's a big thing. It's a
[1:26:52] big thing to to agree to.
[1:26:55] There are certain things that you agreed
[1:26:57] to before you got here
[1:27:00] and there are some things that you will
[1:27:02] agree to now if you if you get to move
[1:27:05] forward in him.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And um I saw mantels,
[1:27:11] I saw anointings, I saw scrolls, I saw
[1:27:15] the callings of the Lord last night and
[1:27:19] um I saw them. I I don't know how to say
[1:27:23] it exactly, but um I believe that we
[1:27:27] come here with a with an assignment
[1:27:30] and with a prefixed destiny according to
[1:27:33] the scripture.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; I I believe we can fall out of God's
[1:27:37] perfect will. Just lay a foundation
[1:27:39] here. We can fall out of God's perfect
[1:27:41] will into a permissive will. And we pray
[1:27:44] when we come back to the perfect will
[1:27:46] that God will redeem the time and that
[1:27:49] anything we missed while we were cold,
[1:27:52] indifferent, or backslid or whatever you
[1:27:54] want to call it, encumbered by the
[1:27:57] snares and troubles of life that God
[1:28:00] will redeem it and bring it back to us.
[1:28:02] But I saw something last night that I
[1:28:04] don't know where to place. I'm not sure
[1:28:06] exactly how to theologically place it
[1:28:08] because I saw that there were uh things
[1:28:12] that God intended to accomplish, things
[1:28:15] that he wanted, he desired to do through
[1:28:18] our lives, but I saw them filtering
[1:28:23] down
[1:28:25] like trickling down to other people
[1:28:29] because many have not been willing to
[1:28:33] take what is theirs.
[1:28:37] And I've always sort of thought in my
[1:28:39] mind, well then it's just held in
[1:28:41] reserve for us until we get ready to go
[1:28:44] and obey God. But that's not what I saw
[1:28:47] in the night. What I saw in the night
[1:28:49] was it was nearly bypassing. And I
[1:28:51] thought, how horrible, how tragic that
[1:28:54] these promises would bypass some, but
[1:28:57] they were it was trickling down to
[1:28:59] others.
[1:29:01] And I saw that uh and I asked, you know,
[1:29:04] I prayed into it. I'm stumbling because
[1:29:07] I want to be careful how I say it, but I
[1:29:10] prayed into it and the Lord put a piece
[1:29:12] in my heart. And he let me know that
[1:29:15] there's a remedy uh for that. There's a
[1:29:18] prevention for that. And that is if we
[1:29:20] all just get willing as fast as we can,
[1:29:24] ready to submit to him as fast as we
[1:29:26] can. Uh because I don't mind you getting
[1:29:30] good things from God. I don't mind you
[1:29:32] doing some of the things that I'm called
[1:29:34] to do, but I won't mind. You understand?
[1:29:37] I'm not jealous over what he's called
[1:29:39] you to do or what he wants you to do,
[1:29:42] but what he wants me to do, I want to do
[1:29:44] it.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I want to get the reward for it.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And so, if I were you this morning, I
[1:29:50] would uh this is what I've done. If I
[1:29:53] were you this morning, I would make it a
[1:29:55] serious uh concern in my life to say,
[1:29:58] "Lord, I'm stepping up." I I just I saw
[1:30:03] that many are putting things off just
[1:30:05] like you've got all the time in the
[1:30:07] world. None of us do. Doesn't matter how
[1:30:10] old or how young. That's not how God
[1:30:13] does these things. None of us have much
[1:30:15] time to get done what we've been called
[1:30:18] to get done. And we are not the ones who
[1:30:22] get to decide the timing. We we can't
[1:30:25] say, uh, Lord, I'd like to do that when
[1:30:27] I get old, or I'd like to do that when I
[1:30:30] get married, or I'd like to do that when
[1:30:32] my children are raised. I need to know
[1:30:35] you're hearing me.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Um, but we shouldn't do that. We should
[1:30:40] say, Lord, your will in your timing.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; And and and then we ought to hear the
[1:30:46] spirit when he says, "Now is the time.
[1:30:50] Now is the time.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Now is the time. And And why not now?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Because we've waited for it
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; plenty long.
[1:31:02] Matthew chap 13 verse 34 and 35. I
[1:31:07] wasn't sure I would be able to pull
[1:31:09] myself back out of that place to even
[1:31:12] get up here. And I appreciated Joshua. I
[1:31:16] didn't ask him to take the service. uh
[1:31:18] he knew that brother Greley was gone and
[1:31:20] he and he mentioned it and he never said
[1:31:22] I'll well I'll do it. He just did it. I
[1:31:24] appreciate that very much and I'm glad
[1:31:26] that he would just keep singing until we
[1:31:29] could move on. Uh because some people
[1:31:32] they they wouldn't wouldn't want to do
[1:31:34] that. But you know there's a there's
[1:31:36] just we just get into a place sometime
[1:31:39] we can't do it. We just can't move. I
[1:31:41] don't want to move.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; You ever been there? I don't want to
[1:31:45] move. I want to stay right where I am
[1:31:47] cuz I don't want to change anything I
[1:31:49] feel.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Matthew 13 uh verse 34 and35 we we
[1:31:56] covered the the vessel of
[1:31:58] misunderstanding. Now we've entered in
[1:32:00] to a vessel of public gaze which is a
[1:32:04] shallow vessel with a wide opening. And
[1:32:07] this was where the Lord took me in the
[1:32:09] night. All these things spake Jesus unto
[1:32:14] the multitude in parables,
[1:32:17] and without a parable spake he not unto
[1:32:21] them. I want you to think about that
[1:32:23] just a minute.
[1:32:25] Just just think about it a moment. All
[1:32:28] these things spake Jesus unto the
[1:32:30] multitude in parables. And without a
[1:32:32] parable,
[1:32:34] outside of a parable, he didn't say
[1:32:36] anything to them.
[1:32:39] It's interesting that it might be
[1:32:41] fulfilled.
[1:32:43] You you you've wondered in your mind why
[1:32:45] why was he always teaching parables like
[1:32:49] object lessons? Here's the reason. That
[1:32:52] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[1:32:54] by the prophet saying, "I will open my
[1:32:57] mouth." Old Testament now I will open my
[1:33:01] mouth in parables. I will utter things
[1:33:04] which have been kept secret from the
[1:33:07] foundation of the world. No better
[1:33:11] mouth, no greater voice than God, his
[1:33:16] word in flesh
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; to come along and speak those secrets
[1:33:21] that had never been spoken from before
[1:33:24] the foundations of the world. and and
[1:33:27] yet in a parable.
[1:33:31] Secrets yet in a parable. May God add
[1:33:35] his blessing to the reading of his word.
[1:33:37] You may be seated. And you who are so
[1:33:40] weary in the knees right now from
[1:33:42] standing so long, remember me.
[1:33:50] You would think that if God was going to
[1:33:52] speak to us as the prophet prophesied
[1:33:57] that he was going to speak things that
[1:33:58] had been kept secret from the foundation
[1:34:02] of the world and now the word has been
[1:34:05] made flesh and he's on the scene.
[1:34:09] Wouldn't you think that the secrets
[1:34:11] would be so easy to to hear and to
[1:34:14] discern and interpret and understand
[1:34:16] that he could just open his mouth and
[1:34:18] speak plainly?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you think that? But the Bible
[1:34:22] said it was parables that he spoke in.
[1:34:26] And without parables, he said nothing.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; And he did it because he was here to
[1:34:31] fulfill what the prophet of the Old
[1:34:33] Testament said. I will open my mouth in
[1:34:36] parables. I will utter things which have
[1:34:39] been kept secret from the foundation of
[1:34:41] the world. So even in this day
[1:34:46] where we have had the mysteries of the
[1:34:49] ages preached to us, delivered to us one
[1:34:53] generation ago.
[1:34:56] And there are so many who like to look
[1:34:58] at those things and tell us we know it
[1:35:01] all and we've received it all and we
[1:35:03] understand it all. And yet we realize
[1:35:08] that many of the things that were spoken
[1:35:11] to us
[1:35:12] were in parables.
[1:35:19] We could almost call them riddles
[1:35:24] because if you say one thing in one
[1:35:26] sermon and the next sermon say something
[1:35:28] entirely different,
[1:35:31] either you're delusional
[1:35:34] or you're speaking in a parabolic way.
[1:35:39] For those who have ears to hear, let
[1:35:41] them hear what the spirit says to the
[1:35:44] church. There are just certain things
[1:35:47] that cannot just be put out there
[1:35:52] as plainly as he would have liked to
[1:35:54] have done it, as plainly as a pastor
[1:35:56] would like to do it. Uh because it would
[1:36:00] just be so confusing to some who have so
[1:36:03] little spiritual discernment that that
[1:36:05] they they just wouldn't be able to catch
[1:36:07] it. And we get in a vicious cycle of
[1:36:10] that kind of thing through the years.
[1:36:12] There's always somebody in the house
[1:36:15] that is quick to misunderstand and take
[1:36:18] something to to a wrong understanding or
[1:36:20] to a place where it doesn't need to be.
[1:36:23] So that's why it's vital that every one
[1:36:26] of us have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:29] for ourselves.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:33] because you believe Brother Brandham is
[1:36:35] a prophet. That's nonsense. Amen.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have the Holy Ghost because
[1:36:40] your mother had the Holy Ghost or your
[1:36:43] father had the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:36:44] nonsense.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have any grandchildren.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And and even the devil believes
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; that God sent a prophet.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Sure enough.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; In fact, he has a five-fold ministry in
[1:36:58] the earth right now. And in that
[1:37:01] five-fold ministry, there are apostles
[1:37:03] and prophets, pastors, teachers, and
[1:37:07] evangelists. And they're not competing
[1:37:10] with the messengers to each of the seven
[1:37:12] church ages. They don't have to compete
[1:37:14] with them. I don't have to compete with
[1:37:17] Paul.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; If there's an apostle in the land, he
[1:37:21] doesn't have to compete with brother
[1:37:23] Brandham
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; because those messengers had their
[1:37:26] office, their job, their commission, and
[1:37:29] they did it. and God took them off the
[1:37:31] scene
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; in spite of what some people think. If
[1:37:35] if brother Brandham had not finished the
[1:37:37] commission that God gave for him to
[1:37:39] finish, he would have never I tell you
[1:37:42] if you are a person who believes that
[1:37:45] the devil has more authority and power
[1:37:47] in your life than the one who created
[1:37:49] you. I feel sorry for you.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You see, I heard a message that has
[1:37:55] certainly made it real to me. The devil
[1:37:57] can't kill me.
[1:37:59] until God is through with me.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; I don't understand why that happens in
[1:38:05] some people's life in their 20s
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; or their 30s.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; And being an empath, it breaks my heart
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; when I hear news.
[1:38:17] I'm making my way through a writing
[1:38:20] uh of a woman who has become some kind
[1:38:24] almost a scientist. And I'm not going in
[1:38:26] to the detail of what I'm reading about,
[1:38:28] but it's very interesting
[1:38:32] because it is confirmation of something
[1:38:35] that the Lord showed us some years ago.
[1:38:38] And I finally found somebody who could
[1:38:40] write about it in a rather scholarly
[1:38:43] way. And her her understanding, she's
[1:38:46] not a preacher. I'm not reading a woman
[1:38:48] preacher particularly,
[1:38:50] but I'm reading her her understanding of
[1:38:53] numbers.
[1:38:55] I like it. And this for her, it was
[1:38:58] birthed out of a horrible tragedy.
[1:39:02] Three older children and a gap and then
[1:39:08] six children. Boom, boom, boom, boom,
[1:39:10] boom. Can you imagine? Nine children,
[1:39:13] three older, six younger.
[1:39:16] And coming back from an event,
[1:39:20] all six of those children died.
[1:39:24] at one time in an automobile accident
[1:39:28] and her life was devastated and ruined
[1:39:31] and she didn't know how she could face
[1:39:34] another day and God began to show her
[1:39:37] some things that comforted her heart to
[1:39:40] let her know there's more waiting on us
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; than just gold streets.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Interesting. A lot of times the greatest
[1:39:51] things that God quickens and makes real
[1:39:53] to us in our life, it it's birthed out
[1:39:56] of a lot of pain
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; and a lot of sorrow. And I don't believe
[1:40:00] there's any real worshippers in this
[1:40:02] house that haven't known
[1:40:05] at least their share. And some people
[1:40:08] might say more than their share, but
[1:40:10] then that would again question the
[1:40:11] sovereignty of God.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; That's where a worshshiper is born. But
[1:40:19] if a worshipper has come through some
[1:40:22] horrible things and has truly repented,
[1:40:26] God restores their heart for him.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; And those are the ones that you're going
[1:40:31] to see doing the extra, going the extra
[1:40:34] mile. Not just a hand lifted up or
[1:40:37] singing along with a song, but you're
[1:40:39] going to see some pushing a little
[1:40:41] beyond the comfort zone. Maybe they're
[1:40:44] not. Maybe they're not pushing beyond
[1:40:45] their comfort zone. Maybe they are.
[1:40:47] Maybe they're pushing. They're pushing
[1:40:49] beyond your comfort zone. Good.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; If my praise agitates you, hallelujah,
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; may it provoke you
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; to be more than a nominal Christian.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; There, this message didn't come to
[1:41:06] nominal Christians.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; It came to overcomers.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And somebody's going to overcome.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; I am. Me, too.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; That ought to be your testimony. I'm
[1:41:19] going to overcome. It's not a time to
[1:41:21] fill your life with so many things other
[1:41:23] than the word.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; We're coming down now to an hour where
[1:41:27] it's got to be the word we feast on more
[1:41:29] than any other thing.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; You understand? So vital, so important.
[1:41:34] And what God's doing right now, there's
[1:41:37] a burden over the house. That's the
[1:41:39] Lord. The burden of the Lord. Jeremiah
[1:41:41] called it. It's the burden of the Lord.
[1:41:44] Jesus called it the zeal. quoting after
[1:41:46] the prophet when he said, "The zeal of a
[1:41:49] my father's house hath consumed me."
[1:41:52] There's a zeal over this house. And
[1:41:55] really, the message to you this morning
[1:41:57] is get in
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; or you're going to be left absolutely
[1:42:04] sitting there with a wonder look on your
[1:42:07] face trying to figure out what blew
[1:42:09] through here.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] Brother Brandham referring to some of
[1:42:14] those visions that are now so questioned
[1:42:17] among the critics. He said, "It passed
[1:42:19] right through me."
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He could have had the silver tip
[1:42:27] grizzly.
[1:42:29] God had always been faithful to give him
[1:42:31] what he showed him,
[1:42:34] but that was because his servant was
[1:42:36] always cooperating.
[1:42:39] It it it takes some cooperation on your
[1:42:41] end to bring a vision to pass.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; If there's a vision that God's going to
[1:42:48] meet you at such and such a place on
[1:42:50] such and such a day, I wouldn't see how
[1:42:53] far I could get away from that place on
[1:42:55] that day.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Would you? I'm just trying to talk in
[1:42:59] simple terms. I'd want to be right in
[1:43:01] the middle of wherever that word came
[1:43:04] and and and nothing lost. But but
[1:43:07] brother Brandon was talking about the
[1:43:08] weather. Some things were shifting there
[1:43:11] over the camp and he got pulled a little
[1:43:15] out of the perfect plan.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And he said that vision went right
[1:43:21] through me and there was no real actual
[1:43:25] fulfillment of the silver tip grizzly.
[1:43:29] And many have said that makes brother
[1:43:31] Brandham a false prophet. I tell you it
[1:43:33] does not. It makes him a human being.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And if you can't see him as thus, you
[1:43:40] really don't have any place among us,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Because God wanted us to see both the
[1:43:48] divine purpose
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; and the human vessel,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; right? There was no silver tip grizzly
[1:43:56] fulfillment, but he recognized where it
[1:44:00] was missed and he said, "It went right
[1:44:02] through me.
[1:44:04] I don't want that to be my story.
[1:44:08] Maybe I just interpreted my own
[1:44:10] question. Maybe the answer came to my
[1:44:13] own question. I I was trying to figure
[1:44:16] out this morning reflecting back on what
[1:44:19] I saw. How is it that that it can be
[1:44:21] assigned to me
[1:44:24] and then filtered down to somebody else
[1:44:27] if I'm not in the right place at the
[1:44:29] right time? If it was for me, if it was
[1:44:32] to me, if it was something that I was
[1:44:34] supposed to do, maybe the uh the Holy
[1:44:37] Ghost, the brown bear. Thank you so
[1:44:39] much. Uh
[1:44:42] it was the brown bear, the silver tip he
[1:44:45] got. Oh, I'm so thankful that you texted
[1:44:48] and that I saw it. Thank you.
[1:44:51] Because that would have been more emails
[1:44:54] than I could possibly answer this week.
[1:45:04] Maybe I've answered my own question.
[1:45:08] If God has something assigned for us,
[1:45:10] we're not where we ought to be to to get
[1:45:12] it. Maybe
[1:45:14] it it it's not going undone. I can't
[1:45:17] accept that God will let something go
[1:45:19] undone. That's the old church mentality.
[1:45:22] I came out of a denominational church
[1:45:24] that that sort of believed that uh there
[1:45:28] would be people that would go to hell
[1:45:31] because there was nobody to tell them.
[1:45:35] And that's how they drafted all the
[1:45:36] missionaries.
[1:45:38] And that's how they forced people to get
[1:45:40] out and do things. And some of them were
[1:45:42] some of them were called and some of
[1:45:44] them were sent. And some of them just
[1:45:46] got up and went because they were under
[1:45:48] guilt.
[1:45:50] And they were told there's going to be
[1:45:52] souls crying out in hell. Why didn't you
[1:45:54] tell me? Now, that's not what we read in
[1:45:57] scripture. By the way,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; in scripture, we read that that it's not
[1:46:03] it's God's responsibility.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; To reveal itself,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; we just have to say yes. And if you
[1:46:11] won't say yes, somebody else will say
[1:46:14] yes.
[1:46:16] But because you said no doesn't mean
[1:46:19] that someone is to be lost. That's you
[1:46:23] you you can't you can't shift scriptures
[1:46:27] to fit
[1:46:29] a mission purpose.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; It is what it is. Let me tell you
[1:46:33] something. God can send angels.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; God can raise up orangutangs.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Why not?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; He spoke through a jackass.
[1:46:46] multiple times really.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; But once Balam's
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; he finds a way.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; There's you a blooper. Put that one in.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Cussing in the pull pit. Donkey just
[1:47:00] wouldn't have fit in that moment where I
[1:47:02] was feeling. God can use a rooster.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; When I first come around the message,
[1:47:09] somebody said, "Well, reckon God could
[1:47:11] even use a woman?" like like a woman
[1:47:13] should be in the same category with a
[1:47:15] rooster or a donkey.
[1:47:20] Of course he can. He can use a woman. If
[1:47:24] he can use a man, he can use a woman.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; That is ridiculous.
[1:47:31] And there's more divorces and remarages
[1:47:34] that run in that kind of preaching
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; than in the kind of preaching we're
[1:47:39] doing here.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:43] Because a woman can only lay down and be
[1:47:46] stepped on for so long and then she
[1:47:48] decides, "Look, I I got to find
[1:47:50] something. God's got to help me, too. If
[1:47:52] he can help you, he's got to help me.
[1:47:53] I've got to get some help here from the
[1:47:55] Lord." And uh you know how it goes.
[1:47:59] Now, uh you'd think that we would have
[1:48:02] all the answers and that what spoken to
[1:48:04] us through Brother Brandon would have
[1:48:06] been always so plain that anybody could
[1:48:08] get it. and he seemed to think in his
[1:48:11] understanding that it was as plain as it
[1:48:14] had ever been. But now that he's off the
[1:48:17] scene and we go back and listen to what
[1:48:19] he said and read what he said, we find
[1:48:22] out that there are still huge questions
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; that we would like to understand better.
[1:48:29] And only the Holy Spirit can do that.
[1:48:32] And that's why we've got to have him
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; for ourselves.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; You've got to have your own experience
[1:48:38] with God. You do believe that, don't
[1:48:39] you?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; You've got to taste the original mana
[1:48:42] for yourself. You do believe that, don't
[1:48:44] you? That's a quote.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; So, you can amen that.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; We've got to go in. And listen, that
[1:48:51] that mana doesn't come out to where we
[1:48:53] are.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; We have to go into where it is.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; It's behind the veil.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; It's in the ark of the covenant under
[1:49:01] the mercy seat.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; That's where the original pot is. So,
[1:49:06] you're going to have to I'm going to
[1:49:07] have to figure out how to get in there
[1:49:08] and get some of that.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And God has made a way. Hallelujah.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; He has made a way. He's made a way, but
[1:49:18] we don't want anything to pass right
[1:49:20] through us. We want to be right on it.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And so, may God help us all uh to
[1:49:26] understand uh every parable and every
[1:49:29] symbol. And um you murmurers, some of
[1:49:33] you who murmur lately, and you say
[1:49:36] things like, "I don't know why all the
[1:49:38] talk about the vision is or I don't know
[1:49:40] why they're all why they're excited
[1:49:41] about that." You know, you need a life,
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; you need to get out of your own head.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:49:55] You need to understand that God gives
[1:49:57] parables because he wants to give
[1:49:59] interpretations.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; He gives symbols because he wants to get
[1:50:04] understanding. He wants to give
[1:50:06] understanding. He wants you and I to get
[1:50:08] understanding.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And if we don't understand the s
[1:50:11] symbols,
[1:50:13] we don't we don't even know the
[1:50:14] parables. How will we know what the
[1:50:17] parable is trying to tell us? Oh, I'll
[1:50:20] give you examples
[1:50:22] because this is the vessel of public
[1:50:25] gaze.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; That means you're going to be looked at.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; How many of you don't like to be looked
[1:50:32] at? Be careful how you say that.
[1:50:38] Cuz sometimes our lifestyle says
[1:50:41] something else. We love to be seen.
[1:50:44] The reality is the deepest part of who
[1:50:46] we are, we'd rather just hide. I think
[1:50:48] the servants of God would just rather
[1:50:50] hide behind
[1:50:52] who we are and just do what we do
[1:50:55] without anybody else knowing it. I'm
[1:50:57] sure you feel that way. But there are
[1:50:59] times that God turns a spotlight on you
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; because he wants to refine you
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; and he wants to get you to a place where
[1:51:09] he can use you as an example.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; And true refinement doesn't take place
[1:51:14] secretly.
[1:51:16] It often takes place publicly.
[1:51:19] You see, in order to hang in the hall of
[1:51:21] faith or the hall of fame,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; you first got to hang in the hall of
[1:51:25] critics.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; He's you're going to be scrutinized and
[1:51:33] studied and
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; and and then the end result is going to
[1:51:37] be like what it was for Abraham. Can you
[1:51:39] imagine that? God his testimony, his
[1:51:42] memorial in the hall of faith reads. Can
[1:51:45] you imagine? It reads, "And Abraham
[1:51:48] staggered not at the promises of God."
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; If if you're standing in the hall of
[1:51:54] faith, that's what his testimony reads.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered none of the promises
[1:52:00] of God. You and I knowing the scripture,
[1:52:02] we know he staggered.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; We know that he decided, I'm going to
[1:52:07] put, you know, my thoughts in here and
[1:52:10] and sound like Sarah had a good idea.
[1:52:13] And it was a product of Sarah's mind and
[1:52:17] Abraham's loins
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; that produced an Ishmael.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't turn out too good in the end.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Still didn't turn out too good if you've
[1:52:28] read the news.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; It's still the seed of Ishmael
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; that's mocking the sons of the promise,
[1:52:34] the sons of Isaac. still today just just
[1:52:37] like just like but Abraham being a
[1:52:39] patriarch uh we honor him and we're
[1:52:42] thankful for him and we learned
[1:52:44] something. We learned that no matter
[1:52:46] what he did, no matter how he moved, God
[1:52:50] so redeemed and so sanctified
[1:52:54] his story
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; that now we read in the New Testament
[1:52:59] you staggered not.
[1:53:02] You know how many of you have staggered?
[1:53:07] We're not going to get over there and
[1:53:08] read about it. We're going to get over
[1:53:10] there and read
[1:53:13] Isabelle staggered not.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Brent staggered not
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; at the promises of God
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; because he's redeeming purposes in us.
[1:53:30] Don't you fret. If you won't do what he
[1:53:32] called you to do,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; somebody's going to raise up and do it.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Now, just remember this. They're going
[1:53:40] to get the reward.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; You don't get to be slouchy, sloppy,
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; disobedient, and still get the blessing.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I don't really care
[1:53:50] about the reward if I can just have
[1:53:52] eternal life. If I can just see Jesus."
[1:53:54] I want you to know something. You may
[1:53:56] not uh may not care much about it now.
[1:54:01] But if you could catch a glimpse over
[1:54:02] there at eternity and understand there's
[1:54:05] only one class of people that's going to
[1:54:08] live with him
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; in the city.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; That's those who wear the overcomer's
[1:54:15] garment.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; And it's a cloak of humility, not a
[1:54:19] cloak of pride,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; not a cloak of religious pride. It's one
[1:54:23] of humility. The church at large, the
[1:54:26] denominational church at large, those
[1:54:28] who call upon the name of the Lord and
[1:54:30] find salvation, their place is certainly
[1:54:32] at the base of the mountain.
[1:54:36] They they see the glory. They worship
[1:54:38] God. They bring their praise unto God.
[1:54:42] But it's only his wife.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. That lives with him inside
[1:54:48] that pyramid city.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; That mountain of Zion. And brother,
[1:54:54] you're going to want to be there.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; If you have an invitation to be there,
[1:54:59] you're going to want to be there.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Now, over there, you know, to have
[1:55:05] eternal life, no, there'll be no
[1:55:06] jealousy there. There'll be no envy
[1:55:08] there. And so, that's wonderful.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; But if you've got an opportunity to go
[1:55:13] all the way, you ought to do it.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Anybody following me?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; We can answer questions later if you
[1:55:19] have some. So here we find that in the
[1:55:22] vessel of public gaze, we're going to be
[1:55:26] looked at and scrutinized.
[1:55:29] Now, I shared with you an experience
[1:55:31] last Sunday. I had to rush through it
[1:55:33] because I did so much other preaching
[1:55:35] like I'm doing now. So I'm going to slow
[1:55:37] down a little bit. I'm going to share it
[1:55:38] again for a reason. I have a I have a
[1:55:41] bit of a commission to do it. and I'm
[1:55:43] going to do it and then I'm going to
[1:55:45] show you some things in the scripture
[1:55:46] really really uh carefully and but
[1:55:48] hopefully quickly as possible. Some
[1:55:51] years ago,
[1:55:54] we were having a wonderful time in a
[1:55:56] beach house in Fort Morgan. and brother
[1:55:59] and sister West had arranged to have
[1:56:03] that house for the week and we were
[1:56:05] invited to come and and and spend some
[1:56:07] time with them and we did and and we
[1:56:10] found out how different Fort Morgan,
[1:56:12] Alabama is from from even Gulf Shores
[1:56:15] and Orange Beach and we saw sea life
[1:56:18] that we hadn't seen anywhere else and we
[1:56:20] just enjoyed it. And Mariah was just a
[1:56:23] little baby at the time. She turned 19
[1:56:26] this past week. She now has her own
[1:56:29] automobile.
[1:56:31] She paid for it in cash. Isn't that
[1:56:34] pretty good?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Pretty good. Pretty good.
[1:56:41] And this time she was just a little
[1:56:43] baby, so I volunteered to stay behind a
[1:56:45] couple days while she napped. And then
[1:56:48] when she would wake up, I would take her
[1:56:50] back down to the beach. And I was laying
[1:56:52] her down. She was asleep. And I went in
[1:56:55] uh tiptoed out of the bedroom into the
[1:56:57] little bathroom that was adjacent. And I
[1:57:00] thought, I might get a shower. I feel so
[1:57:02] sticky. Then I thought, "No, that might
[1:57:03] wake her up. I better not do that. I'll
[1:57:06] just wash my hands." And so I found some
[1:57:08] liquid soap and I just wanted to wash
[1:57:11] the nasty beach salt water and that
[1:57:16] sweat and sand mixed together. You know
[1:57:18] what I'm talking about.
[1:57:20] It's fun when you're there, but as soon
[1:57:22] as you get away from it, you want it off
[1:57:23] of you. Or at least I do. And uh so I
[1:57:26] went in and and I began to wash my hands
[1:57:29] and I there was a towel hanging there
[1:57:31] and I thought, "Well, we can wash those.
[1:57:33] I guess they're for us to use." And I
[1:57:35] reached up to dry my hands on that towel
[1:57:38] and a voice spoke out in in in the room.
[1:57:42] I mean, to me it felt like an audible
[1:57:44] voice. Perhaps it was an internal
[1:57:46] audible voice, but it sounded almost as
[1:57:49] though if you'd have been there, you'd
[1:57:50] have heard it. Now, if you've ever had
[1:57:52] that happen, it's hard to explain.
[1:57:54] People look at you funny when you call
[1:57:55] it audible, but audible simply means you
[1:57:58] were able to hear it.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; I either heard it with my natural ear or
[1:58:02] my spiritual ear. I'm not sure if you
[1:58:05] would have heard it if you were there,
[1:58:06] but a voice spoke out and said, "I will
[1:58:08] give you a sign and I will make you a
[1:58:12] gazing stock."
[1:58:14] What a what a strange I I'm just washing
[1:58:18] my hands.
[1:58:20] You know, I'm not asking for something
[1:58:22] spiritual, just drying my hands. But the
[1:58:26] words affected me deeply because there
[1:58:28] was a part of me that responded to this
[1:58:31] message. I will give you a sign. Yes,
[1:58:34] Lord. That sounds good.
[1:58:38] But quick reflection on I'll make you a
[1:58:41] gazing stock. No, Lord,
[1:58:45] that doesn't sound good. Not that. It
[1:58:49] was like a deep cut. I couldn't imagine
[1:58:51] at the moment what it was about. I
[1:58:54] certainly had not been asking for any
[1:58:55] form of promotion. But the very thought
[1:58:58] of becoming a spectacle, exposed,
[1:59:01] inspected,
[1:59:03] scrutinized, and even further ridiculed
[1:59:06] was unsettling.
[1:59:08] He just did what he often does. He
[1:59:11] repeated the strange sentence again,
[1:59:13] this time much louder. And I think I
[1:59:16] would describe it as forceful. He said,
[1:59:19] "I will give you a sign and I will make
[1:59:24] you a gazing stock." And yet even the
[1:59:26] second time I dared to say, "No, Lord.
[1:59:29] No, not that."
[1:59:31] I can't say that at the moment I could
[1:59:34] even fully begin to unpack the process
[1:59:36] or digest what it could completely mean.
[1:59:40] But I knew that it didn't sound like
[1:59:42] fun.
[1:59:44] And as I said last week when I mentioned
[1:59:46] it to my wife,
[1:59:48] she didn't think it sounded like fun
[1:59:50] either. She didn't think it sounded fun
[1:59:53] to be married to a gazing stock. She
[1:59:56] didn't seem thrilled with it at all. I
[2:00:00] just prayed into it. Whatever it means,
[2:00:02] Lord, I know that eventually I'll have
[2:00:05] to say yes.
[2:00:07] Isaiah 7:11 was the scripture that he
[2:00:09] gave me. And and and you can put that up
[2:00:12] for us if you will. Ask via a sign of
[2:00:15] the Lord thy God. Ask it either in the
[2:00:18] depth or in the height above.
[2:00:22] In the amplified it says, "Ask for
[2:00:24] yourself a sign, a token or proof of the
[2:00:27] Lord your God, one that will convince
[2:00:29] you that God has spoken and will keep
[2:00:32] his word. Ask it either in the depth
[2:00:34] below or in the height above. Let it be
[2:00:36] as deep as shol as the grave or as high
[2:00:40] as heaven." I I like that part.
[2:00:44] Uh it seems like asking abundantly and I
[2:00:48] I like asking abundantly. Don't you? If
[2:00:50] you ask abundantly, you can expect an
[2:00:52] abundant harvest, an abundant result.
[2:00:56] Are you with me?
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; I told the Lord that if it was about
[2:00:59] scrutiny and criticism that that I
[2:01:02] seemed to have been a magnet for that my
[2:01:04] entire life since before I was even
[2:01:06] seven years old. So, I wasn't really
[2:01:09] asking for much more of that. And he
[2:01:11] called me again,
[2:01:14] this time to Hebrews 10:32:33.
[2:01:17] Didn't you just read this? I did. I'm
[2:01:20] reading it again.
[2:01:22] But call to remembrance the former days
[2:01:24] in which after ye were illuminated, ye
[2:01:27] endured a great fight of afflictions.
[2:01:30] Just when you think you fought them all,
[2:01:33] here comes some more. partly whilst you
[2:01:36] were made a gazing stock, both by
[2:01:40] reproaches and afflictions, and partly
[2:01:43] whilst you became companions of them
[2:01:46] that were so used. Now, do you
[2:01:48] understand what he just said? You know,
[2:01:51] I made you a gazing stock and I joined
[2:01:53] you to other gazing stocks. Well, thank
[2:01:56] the Lord. Then I thought I got something
[2:01:58] to praise him for. If I'm going to have
[2:02:01] to be a gazing stock, at least I can be
[2:02:04] joined to other who others who have been
[2:02:08] chosen to be gazing stocks. How many of
[2:02:12] you know there's a little bit of there's
[2:02:14] a little bit of comfort in knowing that
[2:02:15] it's not just you that's going to be
[2:02:17] evaluated, inspected, scrutinized,
[2:02:20] carefully worked over.
[2:02:24] That somehow brings a little comfort.
[2:02:26] I'm thankful for that. You've been
[2:02:28] there, some of you. In the Amplified, it
[2:02:30] reads, "But be ye ever mindful of the
[2:02:32] days gone by in which, after you were
[2:02:34] spiritually enlightened, you endured a
[2:02:36] great and painful struggle, sometimes
[2:02:39] being yourselves a gazing stop, publicly
[2:02:42] exposed to insults and abuse and
[2:02:45] distress, and sometimes claiming
[2:02:47] fellowship and making common cause with
[2:02:50] others who were so treated.
[2:02:54] I I needed some answers. And the Lord
[2:02:56] began to unpack the answers. And I want
[2:02:58] you to understand it because
[2:03:02] if you haven't lived it yet, you're
[2:03:03] about to.
[2:03:06] And you won't be able to come back and
[2:03:08] say, "We had no clue. Nobody told us."
[2:03:11] You You're warned.
[2:03:14] A gazing stock is a person or or a thing
[2:03:17] gazed at by many, especially with
[2:03:20] curiosity or
[2:03:23] contempt.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people are looking at you
[2:03:27] crazy because they're trying to figure
[2:03:30] you out.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; They're amazed at your unusualness.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Your nature toward weirdness,
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; the world calls it. uh your peculiar way
[2:03:44] and and they're squinting as though it
[2:03:46] helps them to to know you better. You
[2:03:48] see them across the room trying to
[2:03:50] figure you out.
[2:03:53] There are other times that someone is
[2:03:55] looking at you like that because they
[2:03:56] don't like you and they want you to know
[2:04:00] they don't like you. So they're
[2:04:01] squinting and they're looking and
[2:04:03] they're evaluating and they're thinking
[2:04:05] in their mind. There are some of them
[2:04:06] holy rollers.
[2:04:08] There are some of those blue jean
[2:04:10] skirtwearing women.
[2:04:12] They must all have 10 children and a
[2:04:15] hateful husband.
[2:04:18] People are always trying to figure out
[2:04:20] why you do your hair different and why
[2:04:22] you don't do exactly like everybody else
[2:04:25] does. And they're just sure that you
[2:04:26] must be a part of an abusive cult. And
[2:04:29] so they're watching you carefully.
[2:04:33] Some because they're interested in the
[2:04:35] in the look of uh of joy or uh the the
[2:04:38] light on your countenance and others are
[2:04:41] looking at you with disgust.
[2:04:43] Why don't you come on in to this century
[2:04:47] and why do you have to look like you
[2:04:49] came across I remember in the 80s when
[2:04:52] they used to talk about the church they
[2:04:54] would say you folks look like you just
[2:04:56] stepped off the Mayflower.
[2:05:00] It's obvious that people in this area
[2:05:02] don't know very much about what Amish
[2:05:04] are because we were also accused of
[2:05:06] being Amish a time or two just simply
[2:05:09] because we did a little different than
[2:05:11] somebody else. You knew it when you
[2:05:14] signed up.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Nobody sold you anything and then later
[2:05:22] gave you the rules.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; You've been called. You've been
[2:05:25] appointed. You've been chosen. You've
[2:05:28] been singled out
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; because God wanted you to be a parable.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Hear this.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; He wanted you to be a parable
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; in a confused world.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; The message hasn't been interpreted yet
[2:05:44] of of what you are and who you are. But
[2:05:47] it will be when you bring forth the
[2:05:50] proof,
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; when you manifest the the tokens
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; that you have been with him.
[2:05:58] That's when the understanding will come
[2:06:00] to the parable that you are.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see. Now,
[2:06:06] you see, they speculate and they and
[2:06:08] they scrutinize and they try to figure
[2:06:10] it all out and and they say, "Well, I
[2:06:12] bet they don't listen to country music."
[2:06:14] That's right.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; I expect they don't even wear bikinis.
[2:06:23] That's right.
[2:06:26] They're just constantly trying to
[2:06:28] speculate, figure out, and guess. But
[2:06:32] there's a promised season coming for the
[2:06:35] bride
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; where she will rise up into the fullness
[2:06:39] of the whos sunship,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; full adoption, full manifestation of
[2:06:44] sunship. It won't be a year-long
[2:06:48] revival. It won't be a decadel long move
[2:06:51] of God. It'll be a short work.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; It'll be a quick work, but it will be
[2:06:57] the manifestation of the sons of God on
[2:07:00] the earth in a way that the world has
[2:07:03] not completely ever seen except in a
[2:07:08] demonstration
[2:07:10] of a mature fruit, a wave sheath
[2:07:14] offering. Christ being the first. Every
[2:07:18] messenger to his age also in some way
[2:07:21] waved over the people so the people
[2:07:23] could catch a glimpse of what an
[2:07:24] overcomer looks like. But it won't be
[2:07:27] just one man overcoming as we get ready
[2:07:30] to leave here. It'll be a body of
[2:07:33] people. I wouldn't call it a multitude,
[2:07:36] but I would call it a group of people
[2:07:38] all over the world that have been
[2:07:40] singled out, picked out to be picked on.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Chosen to be picked on.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Chosen to be spending some time in the
[2:07:50] fermentation vessel of public gaze.
[2:07:53] Looked at as a parable that can only be
[2:07:56] understood as a parable until the
[2:07:59] interpretation comes. and the
[2:08:00] interpretation will be the manifestation
[2:08:03] of his life.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; When you and I can manifest that life
[2:08:08] and that perfect love, nobody then will
[2:08:11] have to try to figure out anymore what
[2:08:14] you are
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; or who you are.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; They'll know. They'll know. They'll know
[2:08:20] because they'll see the life of Jesus
[2:08:23] Christ in you.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Will there be a harvest? Of course.
[2:08:27] There has to be a harvest.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; You can't put men and women on the
[2:08:33] planet who have the power of the
[2:08:35] creative spoken word, who live under the
[2:08:39] word revealed in their day and manifest
[2:08:42] the very life of the one who redeemed
[2:08:44] them and not expect others who have not
[2:08:47] yet had faith, who have not yet
[2:08:50] believed. You can expect that they'll
[2:08:53] just forever stand back gazing and not
[2:08:56] want to understand and become a part of
[2:08:59] what you have tasted.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Some will move by curiosity and will
[2:09:05] quickly fall by the way. But there will
[2:09:08] be those whose seed of destiny is
[2:09:12] awakened in that hour.
[2:09:15] even loved ones who God has held out of
[2:09:20] this truth
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; until such a season as the one I'm
[2:09:26] describing
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; because he knew more about our loved
[2:09:29] ones than we knew about about them. And
[2:09:32] he knew that some people can take the
[2:09:34] criticism and the scrutiny and the
[2:09:37] church hurt and the church abuse and all
[2:09:40] the things that happen on a Christian's
[2:09:43] journey. Some can take it and weather it
[2:09:46] and come out on the other side smelling
[2:09:48] like Christ. But others would be like
[2:09:51] the children of Israel in the beginning.
[2:09:54] He said, "I couldn't take them straight
[2:09:56] in or else they would have become
[2:09:59] dismayed. They would have become
[2:10:01] confused by facing the enemies.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; So I had to bring them by a what? A
[2:10:08] desert route.
[2:10:12] I'll read you a quote in just a minute
[2:10:14] where brother Brandon predicts it was 40
[2:10:16] miles.
[2:10:18] How could it possibly take 40 years
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; to go 40 miles?
[2:10:24] It was God's choice
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; because he understood that the children
[2:10:30] of Israel, his own Hebrews, they were
[2:10:34] operating under a parabolic anointing.
[2:10:37] They were operating under a a parabolic
[2:10:40] mantle. We know that because of what the
[2:10:43] New Testament tells us. Everything that
[2:10:45] happened to them happened to them for
[2:10:48] our
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; in sample or example
[2:10:56] had to happen.
[2:10:58] Somebody had to murmur.
[2:11:01] Somebody had to complain against the
[2:11:03] prophet.
[2:11:05] Somebody had to steal the wedge.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be swallowed by the
[2:11:12] earth. I'd be careful.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; I mean that. I I would. You see, I'm
[2:11:20] just under this impression that God can
[2:11:22] do whatever he wants to do and he's not
[2:11:24] bound by the center of your Bible.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; That little page or two between the Old
[2:11:30] Testament and the New Testament, that
[2:11:32] doesn't limit him.
[2:11:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[2:11:37] and forever.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; He can move toward us in a new covenant
[2:11:40] way. If he wanted to show us something
[2:11:43] right out of the old book, he could do
[2:11:44] that, too.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because he's still
[2:11:48] talking to us through earthquakes. And
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Naam prophesied he's a God of the
[2:11:54] whirlwind. He still is.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; He still talks to us out of those kinds
[2:12:00] of things. That seems kind of Old
[2:12:01] Testament, doesn't it? But God's still
[2:12:03] doing that.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Benjamin and I were talking about it, I
[2:12:07] think on Tuesday of this week there, the
[2:12:09] earth just opened up
[2:12:12] and swallowed them
[2:12:14] and they're just watching them go down
[2:12:16] into the heart of the earth. God gave
[2:12:19] them an opportunity.
[2:12:22] And then the New Testament says, "And
[2:12:23] everything that happened to them was for
[2:12:25] a reason,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; and it was an example
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; to you and I.
[2:12:32] I I got a feeling that example is so
[2:12:34] that we could see where they went wrong
[2:12:37] and steer away from it.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; I think that them being an example is
[2:12:42] where we can see where they went right
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; and try to do right like they did right
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; even more so
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; because we have the understanding of the
[2:12:54] newer covenant.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:12:57] this whole thing gazing stock being
[2:12:59] looked on with curiosity or contempt in
[2:13:02] Hebrews the word is theatroso
[2:13:05] and it's the word that we uh uh root of
[2:13:08] the word that we use in English theater
[2:13:11] because it is to bring upon the theater
[2:13:13] to be made a spectacle of to be put on a
[2:13:15] stage and made a gazing stop by even
[2:13:18] reproaches and afflictions like the
[2:13:20] Bible said 1 Corinthians 4:9 for I think
[2:13:23] that God had set forth us the apostles
[2:13:25] last as it were appointed to death. For
[2:13:29] we are made a spectacle unto the world
[2:13:31] and to angels
[2:13:34] and to men. I want you to know
[2:13:39] that if you're chosen to be a parable,
[2:13:42] if you're chosen to be a gazing stop, if
[2:13:44] you're chosen to be a spectacle, you're
[2:13:47] known in every realm.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; You're known in every dimension. Not
[2:13:52] only does heaven know who you are,
[2:13:54] somebody on earth is going to know who
[2:13:56] you are.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Some man or woman's going to come in uh
[2:14:00] contact, they're going to cross paths
[2:14:02] with you because God's got a parable he
[2:14:04] wants to demonstrate
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; to to men, to women, to neighbors, to
[2:14:10] co-workers,
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; to to co-shoppers in Walmart and the
[2:14:15] mall and wherever else you are.
[2:14:18] But there's also representation,
[2:14:20] knowledge of who you are and what kind
[2:14:23] of a destiny you carry in the lower
[2:14:25] regions,
[2:14:27] in the darkest places,
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; among the damned, among those who are
[2:14:33] workers of iniquity, of another seed
[2:14:37] entirely. They're going to know who you
[2:14:39] are, too. You're going to be a parable
[2:14:41] to them, too. There's something that God
[2:14:44] wants you to show them, too. You can
[2:14:48] overcome. You can overcome.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; You're going to show angels that you can
[2:14:54] overcome. You're going to show your
[2:14:56] savior that you can overcome. And you're
[2:14:59] going to show the regions of darkness.
[2:15:01] I'm an overcomer. Not because I'm
[2:15:03] anything, but because greater is he
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; that is in me than he that is in the
[2:15:12] world.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; We compare these verses of scripture. To
[2:15:18] be made a gazing stop means that God
[2:15:19] would place me in seasons where my walk
[2:15:22] will not be hidden. Lord, may they be at
[2:15:25] this point in my life. May they be short
[2:15:27] in duration.
[2:15:29] my life, my decisions, my endurance,
[2:15:31] these would be openly observed. It was a
[2:15:34] divine head up. I It was a divine heads
[2:15:36] up. God was trying to tell me about this
[2:15:39] end season, this end cycle. He He was
[2:15:42] saying, "I will not test you in secret
[2:15:44] now. I will test you in public."
[2:15:50] I gave the example of somebody saying
[2:15:53] that uh I'm giving honor to a woman
[2:15:55] preacher because there's a dedication.
[2:15:58] Uh you know, I'm just amazed at how
[2:16:01] people zoom in on videos and things.
[2:16:03] Wow. It's just amazing that you can do
[2:16:05] that because I can't imagine unless that
[2:16:07] camera gets in pretty close that you
[2:16:09] could read that inscription there. That
[2:16:11] that is a that is a Torah scroll. It's
[2:16:14] the first five books of the Bible. And
[2:16:16] yes, it was dedicated in loving memory
[2:16:18] of my grandmother, Sister Mildred
[2:16:20] Shelley, 1923 to 1990, who inspired me
[2:16:24] to love Hashem, the name and Erits,
[2:16:26] Israel, the land of Israel. She inspired
[2:16:30] me to love it by taking me there as an
[2:16:33] 11-year-old boy in 1979. My life was
[2:16:36] changed forever. I'm not holding up a
[2:16:39] woman preacher or trying to ma make some
[2:16:41] statement there. It was just a It was
[2:16:43] just a way for me to remember the gift
[2:16:46] and and the fact that somebody's got
[2:16:48] enough time to scrutinize that and talk
[2:16:51] about it and say, "We don't believe the
[2:16:53] message." And uh we went through this
[2:16:55] some years ago because we don't have
[2:16:56] pictures of Brother Brandham here. They
[2:16:58] don't belong in here.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; And as long as I'm the pastor, they
[2:17:02] won't be in here. Not that I'm ashamed
[2:17:04] of him in any way, shape, form, or
[2:17:06] fashion. I just didn't come to church to
[2:17:09] look at Brother Brandham. I didn't even
[2:17:10] come to church to look at a picture of
[2:17:12] the pillar of fire.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, even he said about
[2:17:15] the cloud, that's my Lord there." I
[2:17:18] didn't come to church to look at a
[2:17:19] picture of my Lord in a cloud.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I came to see him,
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; the living word doing among us today,
[2:17:29] what he did in those days and in Bible
[2:17:34] days. your folk just like you don't see
[2:17:37] a you don't see a crucifix
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; neither do you see an empty tomb
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; be
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; because we're looking to follow the
[2:17:47] living word
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; and constantly being pointed back to
[2:17:52] parable
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; will keep us from understanding what was
[2:17:59] really being spoken to us. The goal is
[2:18:03] not to see how much like brother
[2:18:05] Brandham we can get. The goal is to be
[2:18:08] one with Christ. And I personally needed
[2:18:12] this message.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Me
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; to get me to that place. Yes.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; But I'm not against someone who can fall
[2:18:22] in love with Jesus and get an
[2:18:24] understanding of who he is if they can
[2:18:26] do it outside of hearing what I hear and
[2:18:30] claiming what I claim. Power to them.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; But I know what it took for me.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; It took recognizing what God did and
[2:18:40] what he said.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for it. And I want you
[2:18:44] to understand the balance. We can pay
[2:18:47] respect without becoming men followers.
[2:18:51] If we become men followers, we've become
[2:18:53] men pleasers.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; And the scriptures forbid that that be
[2:18:57] our our behavior. And the scriptures
[2:19:00] forbid that that be our identification.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; It can even become a blasphemous name.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Just a hollow name.
[2:19:14] It's ridiculous.
[2:19:16] I watched a little video on YouTube this
[2:19:19] weekend. Absolutely ridiculous. Now,
[2:19:22] they're saying that if you have gotten
[2:19:24] your your uh quote from anywhere but the
[2:19:29] official app,
[2:19:32] you can't really trust it.
[2:19:35] If it didn't come from Jeffersonville,
[2:19:38] they're referring to the hub. I want you
[2:19:40] to know the hub was was a a a creation
[2:19:44] of some brethren in British Columbia who
[2:19:47] have placed the messages of brother
[2:19:49] Brandham in in multitudes of languages
[2:19:53] around the world and preachers can
[2:19:55] download them. They don't have to go
[2:19:57] anywhere to get them. They can download
[2:19:59] them in their homes. They can print them
[2:20:01] out. When I first started doing
[2:20:03] missionary work in this message in the
[2:20:05] 90s, I I spent an evening in a hut with
[2:20:09] with a one light bulb that had been
[2:20:12] temporarily run from homes way off
[2:20:15] somewhere. They had out of out of
[2:20:18] respect to a visitor. They had run an
[2:20:20] extension cord and hung a light bulb
[2:20:22] over my head so that I could have some
[2:20:24] light. The walls were made of mud and it
[2:20:27] was as humble as it could be. And I sit
[2:20:30] there listening to a preacher in the
[2:20:32] message scold me and school me on what
[2:20:36] brother Brandham said. And before I
[2:20:39] leave, I look over at the table and I
[2:20:42] realize that this poor brother has about
[2:20:46] that many books
[2:20:50] and less than that of recorded messages.
[2:20:54] And he believes in his mind, I've got it
[2:20:57] all. I understand it all and I can
[2:21:00] school someone. I left there with such a
[2:21:03] burden.
[2:21:05] Not to condemn, but to give, to do
[2:21:08] anything that I could do to make it
[2:21:10] possible for him to have access to it
[2:21:12] all. And if he's read it all and heard
[2:21:14] it all and still wants to train me, I'm
[2:21:17] willing to hear what he has to say. But
[2:21:20] you can't take a handful of sermons and
[2:21:22] tell me you've embraced it all. Now, it
[2:21:24] only takes one to have a to to to really
[2:21:26] have a revelation, a beginning
[2:21:28] revelation. Brother Brown talks about
[2:21:30] that those hot natives over there would
[2:21:32] just hear one message and they would
[2:21:34] believe it. That's not what I'm talking
[2:21:35] about. I'm talking about then to teach
[2:21:38] someone else.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; You got to know a little more. Now, you
[2:21:41] don't. They just can download it. They
[2:21:43] can have it all. They can read it all.
[2:21:45] They can compare it all. They can take
[2:21:47] it all back to the word. But but here
[2:21:49] this this campaign is going on to say,
[2:21:52] "Well, that's not out of
[2:21:53] Jeffersonville." This is how the man
[2:21:55] said it, the official app
[2:21:58] out of Jeffersonville, Indiana. And if
[2:22:01] that's not the app you have, you can't
[2:22:03] trust the quotations that come from
[2:22:06] these other apps. And I'm thinking to
[2:22:08] myself, if that doesn't sound like a
[2:22:10] denominational headquarters,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; don't don't stress. Don't strain to say
[2:22:16] amen if you don't agree. you sit there
[2:22:18] quietly. It's the most ridiculous thing.
[2:22:21] So, we're we got people running
[2:22:23] deleting. They just plainly say there's
[2:22:25] only one official app. And so, now we've
[2:22:28] got to all delete our our other apps
[2:22:31] even though they've got a whole lot more
[2:22:32] to offer those ministers over there who
[2:22:34] don't speak English. We got to delete
[2:22:36] them all because it doesn't line up with
[2:22:39] Prophet Jr.
[2:22:44] Well, I want to tell you something.
[2:22:45] We've come way too far to find oursel
[2:22:48] entangled in that kind of politics.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Just get it. Get what you can. Read what
[2:22:56] you can. Hear what you can. And most
[2:22:58] importantly, be
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; be what you hear.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Be what you read.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Pray. We need to pray until we can
[2:23:09] manifest
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; in our own lives
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; what we have heard.
[2:23:15] Amen.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; There's that's nothing but the truth.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; I've got to hurry.
[2:23:22] This was a divine heads up. I'll test
[2:23:24] you in secret.
[2:23:26] I've done that. And now in public. This
[2:23:29] is the essence of the vessel of public
[2:23:31] gaze. A time when God allows the
[2:23:33] refining fire to burn in full view of
[2:23:36] everybody else. The crash and burn.
[2:23:40] Everybody sees it. Now, if you'll think
[2:23:43] back over the last few years of your
[2:23:45] life, perhaps the last few years of our
[2:23:47] church life,
[2:23:51] you might catch a glimpse of what that
[2:23:53] looks like.
[2:23:55] When we begin to hear that there's a
[2:23:57] little something more, we get so
[2:23:59] excited. We get so full of vim and vigor
[2:24:03] and zeal and burden and the spirit of
[2:24:05] the Lord is on us and we're ready. We're
[2:24:08] ready to prophesy and we're ready to
[2:24:10] call out sin and we're ready to do all
[2:24:12] kinds of amazing and glorious and
[2:24:14] wonderful things. The problem is
[2:24:18] sometimes we haven't matured enough in
[2:24:21] the new in the new that God is making
[2:24:23] real to us and we kind of get a little
[2:24:27] we kind of get a little bit like
[2:24:32] babies.
[2:24:35] Brother Brandham talks about those
[2:24:36] Pentecostal babies. They've never
[2:24:39] experienced anything or it's been a long
[2:24:40] time since they've experienced anything
[2:24:42] like that and they just get a little out
[2:24:44] of hand and and now they think that they
[2:24:46] can they can uh you know walk and talk
[2:24:49] and and tell everybody else what's wrong
[2:24:52] with them.
[2:24:54] I I don't think that that kind of a
[2:24:56] person ought to be thrown out.
[2:24:59] I think that person is sort of saying
[2:25:02] their life is saying I I just want to be
[2:25:04] usable.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; And you know, brother Vanam said that
[2:25:08] the the the the test on someone's gift.
[2:25:13] You want to test somebody's gift, see
[2:25:15] how well they take correction.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; That's a quote.
[2:25:22] If you can correct them by the word and
[2:25:24] they're willing to adjust, he said that
[2:25:27] that's genuinely most likely to be
[2:25:30] something that God has placed in them.
[2:25:33] But if you say a little something and
[2:25:34] they get so mad and they stomp around
[2:25:36] and they want to quit,
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; then you understand that that gift,
[2:25:42] whatever it was they were operating in,
[2:25:43] that's not likely to be the Lord.
[2:25:45] Because the one thing we know is the
[2:25:47] spirit of the prophet is subject under
[2:25:48] the prophet. Amen.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; In in other words, anything that happens
[2:25:52] out there
[2:25:54] needs the sanction of the authority
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; that's up here.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; That's what it means. It means that you
[2:26:04] don't rule. You don't you don't lead.
[2:26:06] Let's say you don't lead a body from the
[2:26:09] pew.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; The body is led from here. Whoever is in
[2:26:13] whoever is the one that God placed,
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; it's that's not because it's me. It's
[2:26:18] whoever. And and so if there's a gift
[2:26:20] that operates out there, there's an
[2:26:21] order that it has to come in.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; And and uh so it's all right. If someone
[2:26:27] asks you to hold your peace, do it. And
[2:26:30] then you're showing who
[2:26:33] I just want to be a help. I don't want
[2:26:35] to be a distraction.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; So we ought not to hold those kinds of
[2:26:39] things against people.
[2:26:41] Like the Lord showed me years ago. uh
[2:26:45] you know Hannah took her son to to uh
[2:26:49] the prophet Eli and and gives him there
[2:26:53] and and and says I just want him
[2:26:55] dedicated to the service of the Lord.
[2:26:58] And then the Bible said she you know she
[2:26:59] prayed so hard to get him and when she
[2:27:01] finally got him the Bible said she goes
[2:27:03] up every year to see him and to do what?
[2:27:07] To take him a new little coat.
[2:27:11] One time God spoke to me from that. He
[2:27:14] said, "Why do you think she had to go up
[2:27:15] every year and take him a new coat? He
[2:27:18] was living in the tabernacle.
[2:27:22] He wasn't out in the playing in the
[2:27:24] rocks and getting his coat ripped up."
[2:27:27] How many of you know why she had to take
[2:27:29] him a new coat every year? Cuz he was
[2:27:31] growing.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; And I preached a message called growing
[2:27:35] pains.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; And we need to let God's people
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; grow. Amen.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; And if if growing causes growing pains,
[2:27:45] we need to be tolerant of that.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Wow, you're quiet.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; Not so critical.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Like we're going to throw people out.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; We don't compromise, but we understand.
[2:28:01] I've said this before and I don't want
[2:28:03] to embarrass anybody. So, I'm not going
[2:28:04] to call names, but there were two little
[2:28:07] beautiful girls who came here from the
[2:28:10] from the dry, dusty deserts of this
[2:28:14] country.
[2:28:16] Saros and
[2:28:19] maybe Hila monsters
[2:28:22] thrive in the desert. These sweet little
[2:28:25] girls come here many, many years ago and
[2:28:27] they got in this atmosphere of liberty
[2:28:30] and freedom. And when the spirit of the
[2:28:32] Lord would move, they would screech.
[2:28:36] Such a glorious
[2:28:39] screech of response.
[2:28:45] It would pierce.
[2:28:48] It would make the fillings in your teeth
[2:28:50] vibrate. It felt like
[2:28:54] But who could be ugly?
[2:28:57] Who who who could be mean over something
[2:29:01] like that when you know that it's just
[2:29:03] first reaction,
[2:29:05] first response to feeling something a
[2:29:09] little more. My God, I wish somebody
[2:29:12] would screech like that this morning.
[2:29:16] I wish somebody would get in an
[2:29:18] atmosphere that you're unfamiliar with a
[2:29:20] little more than you've ever known
[2:29:21] before and you just react that way like
[2:29:24] a banshee scream.
[2:29:30] It's not because that's how you're going
[2:29:31] to do every time the spirit ever moves,
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; but you're allowed some growing pains.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; You're allowed some spiritual growth and
[2:29:41] some spiritual maturity.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to fall in the
[2:29:44] floor every time the spirit of God
[2:29:47] comes. Sometimes you're going to humble
[2:29:49] yourself in the floor. Sometimes you're
[2:29:51] going to be prayed for and you're going
[2:29:52] to find it difficult to stand up and you
[2:29:55] may fall out. Sometimes you just feel
[2:29:57] like you want to fall because you want
[2:29:58] to get as low as you possibly can. That
[2:30:01] doesn't mean every time God touches you,
[2:30:03] you're going to do that. Right.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; At one time the some of the thunder
[2:30:08] people were teaching that that if you if
[2:30:10] you were coming under the inspiration of
[2:30:12] the seven thunders, you'd fall forward.
[2:30:17] And so the people felt like anytime they
[2:30:20] wanted to fall, they had to pitch
[2:30:21] theirelves forward so they could be
[2:30:23] under the inspiration of the thunders.
[2:30:26] That's a denominational concept that we
[2:30:28] have to do it the same way every time we
[2:30:30] do it. So that Come on.
[2:30:34] I don't care if you fall or you don't
[2:30:36] fall. It doesn't matter if you shake or
[2:30:39] you don't shake. Cry or you don't cry.
[2:30:43] Talk in tongues or don't talk in tong.
[2:30:45] But whatever you do, get under the
[2:30:47] spirit. Get under the anointing. Get in
[2:30:50] the channel where God's spirit is
[2:30:54] moving. And don't you let your gift or
[2:30:58] calling or mantle filter down to
[2:31:01] somebody else because you wouldn't make
[2:31:03] yourself available
[2:31:05] [Applause]
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; in such an hour as this.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; How tragic that would be. I got to
[2:31:16] hurry. God said, "I'm going to make you
[2:31:18] a sign before men and angels so heaven's
[2:31:21] going to know." And so this message to
[2:31:24] me was suggesting that part of my
[2:31:26] calling was to become a living sign. And
[2:31:29] don't think that I'm trying to say I'm
[2:31:31] somebody. Believe me, you're the living
[2:31:33] sign as well. What God does with with
[2:31:37] the with the papa in the pull pit.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; It's what God wants to do in the people.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; You won't perhaps you might not have the
[2:31:47] same calling or the same uh gift or
[2:31:49] anointing or or whatever office in the
[2:31:51] five-fold ministry. That's not what I'm
[2:31:53] talking about. But the but we know that
[2:31:55] God when he when he raises somebody up
[2:31:58] to lead a body of people, you can expect
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; that some of the things that he dreams
[2:32:04] and some of the things that he sees and
[2:32:06] some of the things he hears is simply as
[2:32:08] a parable
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; because God wants you to understand that
[2:32:13] you're the parable, too.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; You see 2 Corinthians chapter 3:2, this
[2:32:17] is what it means. 2 Corinthians 3:2, "Ye
[2:32:21] are our epistle,
[2:32:27] written in our hearts,
[2:32:30] known and read of all
[2:32:35] men."
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Welcome to the gazing stop mantle.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Welcome to the
[2:32:44] parabolic
[2:32:46] mantle.
[2:32:48] called commission.
[2:32:50] You're you're a living letter.
[2:32:54] An epistle was a letter from the apostle
[2:32:56] to the churches.
[2:32:59] It's like a newsletter
[2:33:01] directly addressing that body of
[2:33:04] believers. And yet we can say today like
[2:33:07] the messages of brother Brandham, those
[2:33:09] letters that that the apostles Peter and
[2:33:13] Paul and wrote to the churches there,
[2:33:17] Corinthians to the church in Corinth,
[2:33:20] Romans, to the converts at the church of
[2:33:24] Rome, Ephesians,
[2:33:27] those out of Ephesus, and it goes all
[2:33:29] the way through
[2:33:31] Thessalonians to the church at Thessal
[2:33:34] Thessalonica.
[2:33:37] And we can say that
[2:33:40] you are that newsletter.
[2:33:43] You're the one who's reporting on this
[2:33:46] hour and what God is desiring to do in
[2:33:49] this hour. And because you don't look
[2:33:52] just like them and talk just like them
[2:33:53] and act just like them and vote just
[2:33:56] like them,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; you become the parable. and they're
[2:34:01] scratching their head trying to figure
[2:34:03] out what it is you're saying. So, make
[2:34:06] sure that you're living what you're
[2:34:08] talking.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody cares in this house high you jump
[2:34:12] or how wild you dance
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; as long as it's not vulgar or
[2:34:16] provocative. Make sure your skirt is
[2:34:19] long enough.
[2:34:21] Some of you could use a little help
[2:34:23] there.
[2:34:25] But you worship freely
[2:34:28] as long as when you go out of here,
[2:34:30] you're going to live
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; as dedicated to the truth
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; as you've demonstrated before our eyes.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; I don't say that to be critical. I say
[2:34:40] it to be as sincere as I know. I just
[2:34:42] don't mind loud praise. I don't mind uh
[2:34:45] a little bit of wild worship. I don't
[2:34:48] mind a little bit of emotion. If it
[2:34:50] doesn't have any, it's dead. But I want
[2:34:53] it to be because there's also sincerity
[2:34:55] of faith
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; and and character and quality of life.
[2:34:59] We got to live like he tells us to live.
[2:35:01] Are are you here?
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; One one uh one Sunday there came some
[2:35:06] folks here from another place.
[2:35:10] We were having a gathering down under
[2:35:12] the tabernacle some years ago. And these
[2:35:15] women were clearly not from our tribe,
[2:35:18] but they came here with a commission and
[2:35:20] a purpose. And one of those women began
[2:35:23] to prophesy
[2:35:25] after the service. And then even down
[2:35:27] under the tabernacle, she prophesied.
[2:35:30] She had no way of knowing what God had
[2:35:32] spoken many years before about my own
[2:35:34] personal life that I would wear a
[2:35:37] parabolic mantle and be uh commissioned
[2:35:40] with a parabolic anointing. She had no
[2:35:42] way of knowing that. And yet, as she
[2:35:44] began to prophesy over this place down
[2:35:46] there, uh she prophesied that this was a
[2:35:50] a congregation that would walk in purity
[2:35:52] of heart and that they would function in
[2:35:55] the in in a parabolic anointing, which
[2:35:58] is as a sign. They would function as a
[2:36:01] sign and they would do so because I had
[2:36:04] been given a parabolic mantle, which is
[2:36:07] exactly what the Lord said many, many
[2:36:10] years ago. Now what that means is is
[2:36:13] every church operating as a parable? I
[2:36:15] don't know. I don't know.
[2:36:18] I don't know. Maybe they are. Maybe
[2:36:20] every church around this message, maybe
[2:36:22] every church of every flavor on on in
[2:36:24] this county is operating as a parable. I
[2:36:27] don't know. I'm not commissioned to tell
[2:36:29] them where they are. I'm commissioned to
[2:36:31] remind us where we are.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; That means we're not always going to
[2:36:35] understand everything that happens.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; It's a parable.
[2:36:43] That doesn't mean it'll always be that
[2:36:44] way. The understanding will come. But if
[2:36:48] you can receive a message that declares
[2:36:51] the secrets that were hidden from the
[2:36:53] foundation of the world and still come
[2:36:55] to a place after studying it all these
[2:36:57] years that you say, "I don't understand
[2:36:58] it all." You're going to have to admit
[2:37:00] eventually that that's because some of
[2:37:02] it came like like the teachings of
[2:37:04] Christ. It came in a parabolic form.
[2:37:08] And if that be the case, then if it's
[2:37:10] for us, we ought to be able to try to
[2:37:12] pray and want to know. I desire to know.
[2:37:15] I'd like to know.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; I hear I hear our preachers telling us
[2:37:22] that the revelation of the seven
[2:37:24] thunders is here. Well, I want to know
[2:37:26] where it is and what it is.
[2:37:34] Some have said it's the virtues.
[2:37:37] That's incorrect.
[2:37:42] Doesn't fit the scripture. It doesn't
[2:37:43] fit all the quotes.
[2:37:46] Some have said it's seven men who have
[2:37:48] seven thundering messages to awaken the
[2:37:51] bride. I don't think that's probably
[2:37:53] correct either.
[2:37:57] But the very fact that we're having to
[2:37:59] say we're not sure
[2:38:02] is pudding proof
[2:38:05] that some of it came to us in parables.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; And I can show you the quotations if you
[2:38:11] need them. If you're a purist and you
[2:38:14] need them, I can certainly show them to
[2:38:15] you
[2:38:17] where he says more than one time
[2:38:22] it went by me
[2:38:24] in an unknown tongue. I could not make
[2:38:27] it out. And then there was another part
[2:38:31] where he said, "And that concerning the
[2:38:33] third pull tent vision, there was a
[2:38:35] portion there where he said, I will take
[2:38:37] that to my grave."
[2:38:39] Now, that would have been brutally
[2:38:42] unfair of him to do that had he not had
[2:38:47] an understanding that somehow someway
[2:38:51] that little bride reading between the
[2:38:54] lines, praying and asking God for
[2:38:58] understanding would come to the
[2:39:00] understanding of what it takes. How
[2:39:03] cruel and how unfair that would have
[2:39:05] been to tell people, I've got something
[2:39:08] you need to know to make the rapture,
[2:39:09] but I'm taking it to my grave.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; Let's let's be real here today.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; That's that'd be terribly unfair.
[2:39:20] Had he not known
[2:39:23] that there would be a people at the end
[2:39:25] who wouldn't go along with the crowd who
[2:39:27] says, "Oh, we know. We know. We know. We
[2:39:29] know." Well, what is it? Well, we know.
[2:39:30] We know. We got it. We know what it is.
[2:39:32] Well, what is it? We know it was in the
[2:39:36] seals.
[2:39:38] Well, that's real funny because he said
[2:39:40] it wasn't more than once.
[2:39:45] It's a parable.
[2:39:48] Why do you even talk about it? Because
[2:39:49] we have to know at some point. And it's
[2:39:52] like this. You're not going to know if
[2:39:54] you're not reaching to know. You're not
[2:39:56] going to know if you're not praying to
[2:39:57] know. You're not going to pull if you
[2:39:59] don't know you're supposed to be
[2:40:00] pulling. And why is it even important?
[2:40:02] Because he said it's going to take the
[2:40:04] revelation of those seven unknown
[2:40:06] thunders to wake up the bride.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. If there's if
[2:40:10] that's the truth, and I happen to
[2:40:12] believe it is, then we're going to have
[2:40:13] to do more than run around saying, "I
[2:40:15] know what they are. I know what they
[2:40:16] are." Oh, what are they? I don't I
[2:40:18] wouldn't want to say. You wouldn't want
[2:40:21] to say because you don't really know.
[2:40:24] uh that caused that kind of a preacher
[2:40:26] into I'm not trying to be I know it
[2:40:28] sounds I I came here to be bold but I
[2:40:32] didn't come to be mean
[2:40:34] but that that caused the integrity of
[2:40:37] that kind of a man really it caused it
[2:40:39] into great question to run around
[2:40:41] telling me you know
[2:40:44] and then can't tell us can't show us
[2:40:48] where it is some places he said it
[2:40:50] wasn't written at all
[2:40:53] other places. You said, "Well, it would
[2:40:54] have to be written somewhere in the
[2:40:55] word. We just might not identify it a as
[2:40:59] such until he shows us where it is." You
[2:41:03] know what that means? That means it
[2:41:04] might not be in the book of Revelation.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; It may be written somewhere else in the
[2:41:09] word
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; and we would have to see that by the
[2:41:13] spirit if if that's necessary. Maybe
[2:41:15] it's not, but I think it might be. And
[2:41:16] if it is, so what do we do in the
[2:41:18] meantime? Well, we don't get lazy
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; and we don't give up
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; and we don't see how many uh times we
[2:41:28] can miss our appointment
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; we keep putting oursel in the position.
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want it. Come on.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; You saw me leave
[2:41:46] this morning. I left because I came
[2:41:48] under such an emotion that I couldn't
[2:41:50] stand there because I knew that I would
[2:41:52] be noticed
[2:41:56] and I ended up in the washroom weeping,
[2:42:00] begging the Lord, hold off just please,
[2:42:03] Lord, just a little bit because I could
[2:42:07] feel something coming over this
[2:42:09] atmosphere. I'm not trying to be weird,
[2:42:11] wild, strange. just I'm just being
[2:42:13] trying to be real which I may find this
[2:42:15] morning that I can't be but I'm hoping
[2:42:18] for that moment.
[2:42:20] I felt something moving and knew I felt
[2:42:22] like I knew in my heart where it was
[2:42:24] moving
[2:42:26] and then my mind begins to go to those
[2:42:28] who aren't here
[2:42:30] who would very much like to be in a
[2:42:32] service in an atmosphere where we might
[2:42:36] get another installment of what God said
[2:42:38] we would would see and hear and feel and
[2:42:40] experience.
[2:42:41] I would want to be right smack dab in
[2:42:43] the middle of that. Didn't God know?
[2:42:46] Yes, he knows. But I'm so thankful that
[2:42:48] he doesn't mind sometime when we say,
[2:42:50] "Lord, please.
[2:42:53] Show a little mercy.
[2:42:56] Hold back just a just a bit. Give us
[2:42:59] just a little while longer.
[2:43:02] I feel like the Lord uh moved for me
[2:43:05] simply because of what he dealt with me
[2:43:07] in the night.
[2:43:09] those things that were were to be
[2:43:11] assigned to you, to you, to you, to you,
[2:43:13] and we're not stepping up to take them.
[2:43:15] And so I they just started doing just
[2:43:17] filtering down.
[2:43:20] God's going to find somebody.
[2:43:23] Just take this as a as a as a whatever.
[2:43:28] He's going to find somebody to do what
[2:43:31] he told you he wanted to do in you. I
[2:43:34] hope it'll be you. That will be up to
[2:43:36] you. Somebody said, "Why don't God just
[2:43:38] make me?" Well, he can.
[2:43:41] Just ask Yonah
[2:43:45] the dove.
[2:43:47] Just ask Jonah. His name means dove.
[2:43:50] Just ask him.
[2:43:52] If God didn't know how to get him where
[2:43:53] he needed to be.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody said a man couldn't even live
[2:43:58] in a whale's stomach like that. Well,
[2:43:59] it's a good thing the Bible didn't call
[2:44:01] it a whale.
[2:44:03] Bible called it a great fish.
[2:44:05] And if you'll go up there to the Georgia
[2:44:08] Aquarium, they just lost one. I was sad
[2:44:10] to hear that. You'll find a fish up
[2:44:12] there big as a whale
[2:44:16] called a whale shark.
[2:44:18] There's all kinds of creatures. And
[2:44:20] listen, this might have been a creature
[2:44:22] that never existed before and never had
[2:44:24] an offspring.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the creator here.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; You going to let some scientists tell
[2:44:30] you that a man couldn't have been in the
[2:44:32] belly of a whale? If the word said it,
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; I believe I believe it.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; You believe you believe it.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; He knows how. God can do anything but
[2:44:42] fail.
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Now I got to hurry. Oh,
[2:44:50] I didn't do I didn't do that for you to
[2:44:52] say that, but thank you. I know you mean
[2:44:54] it.
[2:44:57] So Jesus didn't say anything except he
[2:44:59] said in a parable.
[2:45:01] I like that.
[2:45:03] because he told us this this
[2:45:05] congregation would be walking in a
[2:45:06] parabolic anointing and that means your
[2:45:09] life will become a living parable.
[2:45:12] Brace yourself if you haven't already
[2:45:14] because that don't always mean
[2:45:17] fire and glory.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; It don't always mean rolling in the
[2:45:22] floor and talking in tongues and seeing
[2:45:24] visions and visiting with angels. And as
[2:45:26] one preacher uh uh mentioned lately, he
[2:45:29] said, "There are those people around us,
[2:45:31] you know, who who who have breakfast
[2:45:32] with angels
[2:45:36] and lunch with angels and supper with
[2:45:39] ang.
[2:45:42] And if I know I do, I'm going to tell
[2:45:44] it. I'm going to tell it. And I might
[2:45:45] tell it with your name attached to it
[2:45:47] just so you'll know that somebody
[2:45:50] desired." Listen, I loved it. I loved it
[2:45:55] because a little while later, this other
[2:45:57] little preacher gets up there to take
[2:45:58] take his part of the service the next
[2:45:59] day or whatever it was and he said, "You
[2:46:01] know, I I love the fact that the angels
[2:46:04] of the Lord are with us and he said, I I
[2:46:06] hear brother Brandham saying the reason
[2:46:07] why we don't see them is because we
[2:46:10] don't talk about them." He said, "But if
[2:46:13] we talked about them more, so if anybody
[2:46:16] in here had breakfast with angels, tell
[2:46:18] us."
[2:46:19] Hallelujah.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; Don't mock somebody because you don't
[2:46:22] know whether they did or not.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Why a lie might provoke you
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; to pray, Lord,
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; let me be aware.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Just let me be aware.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; Because whether you saw them at the
[2:46:37] breakfast table or you didn't see them
[2:46:39] at the breakfast table, the word says
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; they were there,
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; doesn't it? In camps roundabout.
[2:46:48] Glory, glory, glory.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; Why do Why do people want to be so Boy,
[2:46:52] Brother Green got stirred one time. He
[2:46:56] got stirred when they were having such
[2:46:58] critical things to say about people who
[2:47:00] saw angels.
[2:47:01] He got stirred and he just broke off and
[2:47:04] preached for weeks on angels. He said,
[2:47:07] "While I'm at it, I'm going to tell you
[2:47:09] all some supernatural experiences that
[2:47:10] I've never told anybody, but I'm going
[2:47:12] to tell them all right now." And he just
[2:47:14] unravels. thing because he wasn't on the
[2:47:16] earth much longer. Just go ahead and
[2:47:18] tell it. He said, "I've had multiple
[2:47:21] encounters.
[2:47:22] I read this week the things he wrote
[2:47:24] while we were in Israel together. I read
[2:47:27] the things he wrote and he wrote a a
[2:47:29] note back to his congregation and he
[2:47:31] said, "I've had two visitors since I've
[2:47:33] been here in the apartment."
[2:47:37] Just letting them know. Didn't tell them
[2:47:39] what they said. Didn't tell them who
[2:47:40] they were, whether they were angels or
[2:47:42] what they were. They weren't natural
[2:47:43] because I was there and he didn't get
[2:47:45] any visitors,
[2:47:48] but just he wanted the congregation to
[2:47:50] know, "Thank you for praying for me. God
[2:47:52] is meeting with me like he promised he
[2:47:54] would. I've had two visitors that have
[2:47:56] showed up since I've been here in the
[2:47:57] apartment." That was like maybe the
[2:47:59] second or third day that he had gotten
[2:48:01] there. Uh for he said, "I've made up my
[2:48:03] mind to talk about it." Because here is
[2:48:06] the quote where he said, "If you talk
[2:48:07] about it, they'll come. If you talk
[2:48:10] about them, they'll come." It works that
[2:48:12] way sometime. If all you talk about is
[2:48:15] SEC football,
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; the angels could care less about I know
[2:48:20] I know I know I know that everybody
[2:48:22] believes that when they pray that God's
[2:48:24] going to let their favorite team win.
[2:48:27] &gt;&gt; Well, that's going to be impossible cuz
[2:48:29] if you got Christians on one side and
[2:48:31] Christians on the other and they're
[2:48:32] praying their team wins, how's God going
[2:48:35] to evaluate it?
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; Does he Does he sometimes speak? Yes, he
[2:48:41] does. I've seen him. I've watched him
[2:48:43] do. God can do a lot of things, but
[2:48:46] angels don't come when we talk about
[2:48:48] those things. But when we talk about
[2:48:49] super, let me tell you something. This
[2:48:51] let me tell you this. Let me go ahead
[2:48:53] and tell this.
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; If you will talk about the supernatural,
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; you will become aware
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; of the supernatural.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; It's always around us. That supernatural
[2:49:06] dimension and realm is always there,
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; but we're not aware of it because we're
[2:49:10] busy here, we're busy there, we're doing
[2:49:12] this, do that. You just talk about it.
[2:49:14] Then you become aware of it. Then you
[2:49:15] start watching for it. Then you start
[2:49:17] thinking about it.
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to tell everything
[2:49:20] yet. Well, oh my, the hair just stood up
[2:49:22] on my arm. You know, you don't have to
[2:49:24] tell that every time. Yeah,
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; that's God helping you to get ready to
[2:49:29] recognize his presence or to recognize
[2:49:32] the angels or to recognize the heavenly
[2:49:36] uh creatures or or the hosts
[2:49:39] because he's the he's the captain of
[2:49:41] angel armies and all angels don't
[2:49:43] operate the same. They don't all look
[2:49:45] the same.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; I I can tell you that by experience.
[2:49:49] They don't all show up the same. They
[2:49:50] don't all do the same work. They don't
[2:49:52] all look the same. I don't care. I'll be
[2:49:54] honest with you, if I never see another
[2:49:57] manifestation of an angel, I'll be all
[2:49:58] right as long as they're with me.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, the mighty one, the
[2:50:06] one that showed up for me some just a
[2:50:08] couple years back on on a beach out
[2:50:11] there at at top sale, I'm telling you,
[2:50:15] that's the one I want. Lord, if you'll
[2:50:17] let him be near me all the time, I won't
[2:50:20] have to worry about nothing or nobody
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; because he showed me that he had come
[2:50:25] from the one who had power over all and
[2:50:28] that he had been built and created in
[2:50:30] such a way to let me know
[2:50:33] &gt;&gt; that the Lord is mighty.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; He's I'm telling you, he is mighty. The
[2:50:38] the Bible calls him in he in a in a in a
[2:50:41] translated Hebrew word, he's terrible.
[2:50:45] And when we hear terrible, we think that
[2:50:47] means, you know, that's just awful. But
[2:50:49] boy, it means terrifying.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; He knows how to move.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:51:00] we'll pick this up another time, but
[2:51:04] here's what I want to show you about
[2:51:05] because I want to make sure you
[2:51:06] understand what it means to live under a
[2:51:07] parabolic mantle or a parabolic
[2:51:09] anointing or be a part of a parabolic uh
[2:51:12] body of believers. Uh somebody told us
[2:51:15] that we were that we were a prophetic
[2:51:18] class
[2:51:20] because God had sent this prophetic
[2:51:23] message to a prophetic class. So either
[2:51:26] brother Bam said it or leave said it,
[2:51:28] whoever said it, it's real. It's right
[2:51:30] and I like it. A prophetic class.
[2:51:34] And we are. You got to be. You can't
[2:51:36] understand a prophetic truth if you
[2:51:39] don't have a prophetic nature about you.
[2:51:42] And that's why we need to talk about
[2:51:43] these things. Why do we talk about?
[2:51:45] Because we need to talk about them.
[2:51:46] Because we need to become uh uh uh have
[2:51:49] a good foundation so that when we begin
[2:51:51] to see these things come to pass,
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; we'll know. Hey, that's that's what the
[2:51:57] Lord said.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Why? That is what the Lord told us he
[2:52:01] was going to do. Glory to God. When
[2:52:04] somebody when one of your loved ones
[2:52:06] comes stumbling in here one day and
[2:52:07] flops down in this altar and prays
[2:52:09] through the Holy Ghost, you'll be able
[2:52:10] to rise up and say, "Hey, that's what
[2:52:12] God told us was going to happen
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; and now it's happening."
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; You have to know
[2:52:19] God is always moved in in prophetic
[2:52:21] parables and in prophetic
[2:52:23] demonstrations, in prophetic
[2:52:25] intercession, and in prophetic acts all
[2:52:28] the way through the Bible. and act the
[2:52:31] prophetic acts and prophetic
[2:52:33] demonstrations are are pretty much the
[2:52:35] same kind of a thing. And if you have no
[2:52:37] grid for that, uh, I want to help you
[2:52:39] just a moment because this is what the
[2:52:40] Lord showed me to do. Turn to Isaiah 20.
[2:52:43] Got to hurry.
[2:52:46] Wow.
[2:52:50] Isaiah 20 uh uh verse two, sweetie.
[2:52:54] Isaiah 22 20 and verse two. At the same
[2:52:57] time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of
[2:53:01] Amos, saying, "Go
[2:53:04] and loose the sackcloth from all thy
[2:53:07] loins,
[2:53:08] and put off thy shoe from thy foot." And
[2:53:12] he did so, walking naked.
[2:53:18] I didn't hear it.
[2:53:21] Naked and barefoot.
[2:53:25] And the Lord said, "Like as my servant
[2:53:27] Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot
[2:53:32] for 30 minutes."
[2:53:36] Lord have mercy. I doubt he was invited
[2:53:39] to preach any of the camp meetings.
[2:53:43] He probably didn't get one invite to a
[2:53:46] youth camp for three whole years while
[2:53:49] he walked around
[2:53:54] naked.
[2:53:59] It'd be one thing if he was 18,
[2:54:06] but at his age,
[2:54:09] he was beyond the stage of tight.
[2:54:14] He was now saggy and flappy and flabby.
[2:54:23] You needed that visual.
[2:54:26] It'd be like your granddaddy
[2:54:29] walking around in the yard for three
[2:54:31] years.
[2:54:40] Smile.
[2:54:42] Won't hurt you to enjoy yourself.
[2:54:48] Now, let's finish reading.
[2:54:51] Come on, class.
[2:54:54] I need back to back to the board.
[2:54:57] The Lord said, "Like as my servant
[2:55:00] Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot
[2:55:02] three years for a sign and a wonder upon
[2:55:05] Egypt and upon Ethiopia."
[2:55:09] You may not have noticed this,
[2:55:12] but Egypt and Ethiopia are not
[2:55:14] neighbors.
[2:55:17] And we don't have any full proof that he
[2:55:20] was ever in Egypt or Ethiopia.
[2:55:25] What we do know is that God had called
[2:55:27] him to do something very odd.
[2:55:31] I pray that you don't get similar
[2:55:34] calling.
[2:55:36] I pray I don't get similar calling.
[2:55:40] This example is the most extreme of the
[2:55:43] examples. I thought I would lead with
[2:55:45] it.
[2:55:47] You don't really want to think about it.
[2:55:49] Do Absolutely. I want you to think about
[2:55:50] it. I want you to think about what you'd
[2:55:52] have done if you'd have been Isaiah.
[2:55:56] And then I want you to think about the
[2:55:57] little old things that God has asked you
[2:56:00] to do.
[2:56:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just being real. And you just
[2:56:04] couldn't do it because somebody might
[2:56:05] misunderstand you. They will. Especially
[2:56:08] if you're in the vessel of
[2:56:09] misunderstanding.
[2:56:11] Or somebody might gaze on you.
[2:56:13] Especially you. They will. if you're in
[2:56:15] the vessel of public gaze.
[2:56:19] And at the end of the day, doesn't
[2:56:20] matter if you were misunderstood or not.
[2:56:22] And it doesn't matter at the end of the
[2:56:23] day if somebody was gazing at you or
[2:56:25] not. What matters, I want you to hear
[2:56:28] me, church. What matters is at the end
[2:56:30] of the day, did you obey the Lord?
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; I expected a little better
[2:56:42] reaction than that.
[2:56:45] Isaiah's shameful exposure was not
[2:56:48] humiliation. It was God demonstrating,
[2:56:52] a prophetic parable,
[2:56:55] a prophetic act that had little to do
[2:56:58] with with Egypt and Ethiopia in the
[2:57:01] natural, but in the spiritual,
[2:57:05] God was doing something to Egypt and to
[2:57:09] Ethiopia.
[2:57:11] And he did it by a parabolic prophetic
[2:57:14] act in a in a prophet Isaiah whom I
[2:57:17] would just go ahead and tell you one of
[2:57:19] the greatest prophets of the Old
[2:57:20] Testament.
[2:57:23] &gt;&gt; You just just read them all and then you
[2:57:25] come back and see if you wouldn't say
[2:57:27] that he had one of the most profound
[2:57:29] prophetic ministries.
[2:57:32] Now, you talk about visions and who's
[2:57:34] supposed to have a vision and what is a
[2:57:36] vision? And even some have snickered a
[2:57:38] little bit and said, "Well, what is a
[2:57:40] transvision?" Read your Bible and come
[2:57:43] back to me.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Just read your Bible.
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; You got a King James version, don't you?
[2:57:50] Look up the word trance. See if it's in
[2:57:53] your Bible. See, if the Bible doesn't
[2:57:55] describe a a a particular uh kind or a
[2:58:00] particular installment of a vision, that
[2:58:02] doesn't come like a trance.
[2:58:06] It's very biblical.
[2:58:09] It's highly important at times
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; that God would take you out of your
[2:58:15] present consciousness
[2:58:17] to be able to show you something that he
[2:58:19] wants you to see that in other
[2:58:21] circumstances you would be too
[2:58:23] distracted by your present environment
[2:58:25] to be able to see. So God just pulls you
[2:58:27] a little bit out. He pulls you a little
[2:58:29] bit out of your present reality.
[2:58:32] Somebody say, "Well, isn't that an
[2:58:33] altered state of consciousness?" Yes, it
[2:58:35] could be called that. And by the way,
[2:58:36] that's not evil either because that's
[2:58:38] what a dream is.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; You have to be in a particular place in
[2:58:46] your sleep cycle to even have a dream.
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; Your consciousness had has to be so
[2:58:51] affected in such a state of rest. It's
[2:58:54] the deepest rest
[2:58:57] and you have to be in that place to
[2:58:59] really be able to have a fullon dream.
[2:59:03] Did you know there are people that don't
[2:59:05] dream in color? Did you know there are
[2:59:06] people who only dream in black and
[2:59:08] white?
[2:59:11] Did you know there are people who dream
[2:59:14] uh uh and have dreams in dreams?
[2:59:20] Did you know there are people who have
[2:59:22] had a dream of having a dream of seeing
[2:59:26] a vision?
[2:59:31] They dreamed of having a dream and in
[2:59:33] the dream that they dreamed of having
[2:59:35] they were seeing a vision.
[2:59:38] Explain that I just did.
[2:59:42] Why did God do it that way? You talk to
[2:59:45] him when you get a chance and you ask
[2:59:47] him and I'll I'll teach it. You bring me
[2:59:50] the syllabus and I'll teach what he
[2:59:52] tells you. We don't understand sometime
[2:59:55] exactly why. All I know is what the
[2:59:58] scripture said that in the last days.
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; Now for you to say that was only in 1906
[3:00:05] Isuza Street Pentecost
[3:00:08] then you would be denying that we're
[3:00:10] still in the last days. If Isuza was the
[3:00:13] last days, where do you think we are
[3:00:15] now? In the last of the last days. And
[3:00:18] he said, "In the last days,
[3:00:21] young men would see visions and old men
[3:00:25] would dream dreams."
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[3:00:31] &gt;&gt; And and and that doesn't mean they'll
[3:00:32] all be spiritual dreams. Sometimes it's
[3:00:36] taco dreams and pizza dreams. You ate
[3:00:38] something you had no business eating at
[3:00:40] bedtime. Torments your sleep and gives
[3:00:43] you these crazy monster dreams.
[3:00:47] But that doesn't mean that God can't
[3:00:48] give godly dreams,
[3:00:51] &gt;&gt; directional dreams.
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that he can't let you see
[3:00:55] something uh uh by vision that is not
[3:00:57] really in front of your natural eye, but
[3:01:00] rather in front of your spiritual eye.
[3:01:03] &gt;&gt; Like a few Sundays ago uh in our last
[3:01:05] fellowship meeting, the presence of the
[3:01:07] Lord was so real in that Sunday morning
[3:01:09] service. And I started down the the
[3:01:11] hallway there and I zoom zoom zoom.
[3:01:16] Now I already have to watch myself. I
[3:01:19] have a a floater and there's something
[3:01:21] else on my eye. I'm still waiting on the
[3:01:24] specialist to call me back. Have you
[3:01:26] ever been there? The doctor said he
[3:01:28] would call me. He hadn't called me. Of
[3:01:30] course, I did give me the number and
[3:01:32] tell me I could call if I wanted to. I
[3:01:34] must not have wanted to because I still
[3:01:36] haven't gone back. But if you've ever
[3:01:37] had a floater like that or something in
[3:01:39] your view, sometime you move your head,
[3:01:41] it moves. You move your eye, it moves.
[3:01:42] So sometime you're swatting at nats that
[3:01:44] ain't there.
[3:01:47] But this was different.
[3:01:49] I've experienced this before. It's just
[3:01:52] glimpses. It's just flashes of things.
[3:01:56] And uh when that comes, it's usually
[3:01:59] because the Lord is going to show
[3:02:00] something else to me. And it and and I
[3:02:03] can go in that stage a long time before
[3:02:05] I ever see a complete picture. But well,
[3:02:10] could that be your imagination? Well, I
[3:02:12] g I guess it certainly could be
[3:02:14] something that you But
[3:02:17] wouldn't you if you're imagining the way
[3:02:19] I understand the imagination is you have
[3:02:21] to utilize it. You you have to actively
[3:02:24] engage it. You have to call on your
[3:02:26] imagination to think of something. And
[3:02:28] and I I think I'm relatively sound. I I
[3:02:32] mean, I'm not 100% sure of my sanity,
[3:02:35] but I think I'm relatively sound. And I
[3:02:38] don't think that I was imagining
[3:02:40] something. Uh, in fact, I think if I was
[3:02:42] going to imagine something that made me
[3:02:44] stagger, I would imagine it when I was
[3:02:46] sitting in my leather motorized
[3:02:49] recliner,
[3:02:50] not going down the hall, stumbling like
[3:02:52] a drunk man.
[3:02:54] We don't know how to explain these
[3:02:56] things.
[3:02:57] They don't make one of us any more
[3:03:00] special than the other. We just need to
[3:03:03] believe. We just need to believe that it
[3:03:05] can happen.
[3:03:08] &gt;&gt; And if it can happen to any one of us,
[3:03:10] it can happen to another one of us.
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; And we ought to be walking close enough
[3:03:14] to the Lord that if he wants to use us
[3:03:16] in a way he's never used us before that
[3:03:18] he could find us available and we be
[3:03:20] stepping up. I wouldn't want to think it
[3:03:22] was filtering down to somebody else
[3:03:24] because I was afraid to do a little
[3:03:25] something he asked me to do.
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; I I hope it's not walking naked for
[3:03:32] three years as a sign to a nation that
[3:03:35] they better get their act together.
[3:03:37] But that was talk about the vessel of
[3:03:39] public exposure. He was there
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; like literally
[3:03:45] exposed
[3:03:47] like as my servant Isaiah. He said, "I
[3:03:49] sometimes God strips us
[3:03:52] in public view,
[3:03:54] not to shame us, but to make his message
[3:03:57] unignorable."
[3:04:00] If a prophet prophesies to you with no
[3:04:02] clothes, you're going to close your eyes
[3:04:03] of hope. But you ain't going to ignore
[3:04:05] what he had to say cuz you're certainly
[3:04:08] going to think, "My, what in the world
[3:04:10] would possess a man to be that bold?" Of
[3:04:13] course, I you know, I'm sure we could
[3:04:16] file that under Old Testament
[3:04:19] behavior
[3:04:21] and we would think that if we had a New
[3:04:24] Testament prophets, we had New Testament
[3:04:26] prophets today after the five-fold
[3:04:28] ministry, we would find them to be more
[3:04:30] reasonable,
[3:04:34] more normal maybe in our mind.
[3:04:37] Uh well, we know that those who bridge
[3:04:40] the gap, like John the Baptist, he
[3:04:42] wasn't exactly normal.
[3:04:45] He he he lived in the wilderness, slept
[3:04:48] in caves,
[3:04:50] he wore camel hair, ate locust and wild
[3:04:54] honey,
[3:04:56] hadn't been to the barberh shop,
[3:04:59] probably smelt like a locust.
[3:05:01] Come on. And if any of the religious
[3:05:04] people came to his services, he just
[3:05:06] called them vipers and scorpions. And no
[3:05:09] wonder, no wonder they chopped off his
[3:05:11] head. But he had a message, didn't he?
[3:05:14] Let me give you one more and we'll go
[3:05:15] home. Hosea,
[3:05:18] this is a prophetic act. This is a
[3:05:20] parabolic anointing.
[3:05:22] Hosea was told to marry
[3:05:28] a prostitute
[3:05:30] from the temple.
[3:05:32] of a false god.
[3:05:35] I hope that's Old Testament doings, too,
[3:05:39] because I'm not performing the ceremony
[3:05:41] unless I know it's God. You understand?
[3:05:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:05:45] &gt;&gt; Hosea 1:2, the beginning of the word of
[3:05:47] the Lord by Hosea. And the Lord said to
[3:05:50] Hosea, "Go take unto thee a wife of
[3:05:54] whoredoms, and children of whoredoms,
[3:05:57] for the land hath committed great
[3:06:00] whoredom, departing from the Lord."
[3:06:05] So he went,
[3:06:08] next verse, and took Gomer,
[3:06:12] the daughter of Dlame,
[3:06:14] which conceived and bare him a son.
[3:06:19] This was a parabolic mantle, a parabolic
[3:06:23] anointing. This marriage was a prophetic
[3:06:27] act. It's one of my favorite stories in
[3:06:31] the Bible that birthed one of my
[3:06:34] favorite songs of all time.
[3:06:37] And and it it I don't have the words in
[3:06:40] front of me, but it it it is Hosea
[3:06:44] speaking to his children.
[3:06:47] go plead with your mother because he
[3:06:50] married her. She bore him three
[3:06:53] children, wasn't it? Bore him children.
[3:06:56] And then she leaves him and goes back to
[3:07:00] the whoredoms of the false temple. And
[3:07:04] one day he sins for her by his children.
[3:07:09] She refuses to come.
[3:07:12] It'll all be forgotten. I'll forgive you
[3:07:15] and welcome you back into my home. I
[3:07:17] love you. Can you imagine? He loved her.
[3:07:22] He knew that she had now gone back to
[3:07:24] giving herself to the male worshippers
[3:07:26] who came to that filthy temple.
[3:07:31] She might have all diseases,
[3:07:34] but he loved her and he wanted her home.
[3:07:37] And he knew it was a part of what God
[3:07:39] was trying to say perhaps to Israel. Go.
[3:07:43] plead with your mother and they she
[3:07:46] refused and one day he sees her on the
[3:07:50] auction block
[3:07:53] &gt;&gt; and she's being auctioned off to the
[3:07:56] highest bidder and he is standing in the
[3:07:59] crowd bidding
[3:08:01] on his unfaithful
[3:08:04] wife.
[3:08:08] Can you find those words?
[3:08:17] I know we have it, but I'm not sure if
[3:08:18] you I don't remember exactly how to tell
[3:08:20] you to find it.
[3:08:24] The bids were getting high
[3:08:29] and he continues to bid
[3:08:33] on his own. And when she sees who it is,
[3:08:38] she she's baffled.
[3:08:42] Go plead with your mother were the words
[3:08:44] of Hosea as he sent his children to
[3:08:48] extend his mercy. So they journeyed down
[3:08:51] the old path that lead that led to much
[3:08:54] destruction.
[3:08:56] All the while their loving hearts were
[3:08:59] hurting. That is their mother.
[3:09:04] Their
[3:09:06] mother.
[3:09:09] Don't you know? Their hearts were
[3:09:12] breaking for the condition of their
[3:09:16] mother. Their hope was crushed inside as
[3:09:20] their compassion was denied.
[3:09:23] The woman they so loved seemed like a
[3:09:26] stranger. Heartbroken and alone, they
[3:09:30] took the long road home. For sin now
[3:09:33] reigned, and all hope seemed gone to
[3:09:37] change her.
[3:09:39] One day, the word was told. Some slaves
[3:09:42] were being sold. A restless love sent
[3:09:46] Hosea seeking. One by one, they brought
[3:09:50] them in, so beaten down with sin. Within
[3:09:54] his chest, his anxious heart was
[3:09:56] beating. All at once, she caught his
[3:09:59] eye. From his lips, the bids were high.
[3:10:05] She could not believe the voice that she
[3:10:09] could hear.
[3:10:11] Would he through judgment take her life
[3:10:14] forever end his pain and strife?
[3:10:18] What would happen as she saw him drawing
[3:10:21] near her?
[3:10:26] And this was what he said. I've come to
[3:10:29] take you home.
[3:10:32] I know that you've done wrong,
[3:10:35] but for you, I'd give my life through
[3:10:41] through sorrow.
[3:10:45] And I give my life through the sorrow,
[3:10:48] pain, and strife. I couldn't let you go.
[3:10:52] Let's leave the past behind.
[3:10:56] Beautiful line. Love conquers one more
[3:11:00] time. He took her hand and said,
[3:11:03] "There's a new day just ahead. I
[3:11:07] couldn't let you go."
[3:11:10] Now you think about it.
[3:11:14] A prophet who desired to be heard.
[3:11:19] If you've been called with a message,
[3:11:21] you want to be heard. I wonder what the
[3:11:24] church thought about him when they found
[3:11:28] out that all of a sudden he's taken a
[3:11:30] wife among the
[3:11:33] And I wonder how they delighted, how
[3:11:35] they laughed, how they talked, how they
[3:11:37] chatted, how they judged when they found
[3:11:40] out she'd left him and gone back to her
[3:11:43] whoredoms.
[3:11:45] And I wonder what they had to say
[3:11:48] when they found out that he had gone
[3:11:50] down there and bought her back
[3:11:54] because he loved her anyhow.
[3:11:58] Why would God why would God ask a
[3:12:01] prophet who he wanted to be heard to go
[3:12:04] and do something like that because he
[3:12:06] was sending a message to Israel. This is
[3:12:08] what you've done.
[3:12:09] &gt;&gt; This is what you've done. This is what
[3:12:12] you've done. But I've come to take you
[3:12:15] back.
[3:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; The new the Old Testament says there
[3:12:20] came a time he divorced her
[3:12:24] and yet he came back and said, "I can't
[3:12:26] break my vow.
[3:12:29] You're mine.
[3:12:30] &gt;&gt; And I still want you.
[3:12:33] &gt;&gt; Even though you've been put away, I
[3:12:35] still want you because I love you." Now,
[3:12:38] what a message
[3:12:41] that's greater than anything I've set up
[3:12:43] here today.
[3:12:45] And how did it come? In a parabolic
[3:12:47] anointing.
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; In a parabolic act, in a prophetic act.
[3:12:53] And I'm closing. Musicians are coming.
[3:12:55] I'm not done, but I'm closing. Of
[3:12:58] course, we have to. We could only take
[3:13:00] in so much.
[3:13:06] But I need to at least give you a
[3:13:11] a New Testament example because they're
[3:13:13] mel they're mel several
[3:13:16] in Acts 18 and6 while they're getting
[3:13:19] ready to play.
[3:13:21] This was Paul. And when they opposed
[3:13:24] themselves and blasphemed,
[3:13:27] he shook his raignment
[3:13:29] and said unto them, "Your blood be upon
[3:13:32] your own heads. I am clean. From
[3:13:36] henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."
[3:13:41] A Pharisee of Pharisees.
[3:13:44] Couldn't he have just delivered the
[3:13:45] message without shaking the garment?
[3:13:48] But the shaking of the garment was the
[3:13:50] full release of what God wanted them to
[3:13:54] know.
[3:13:57] You've stubborn. You've hardened your
[3:14:00] heart. You've stiffened your neck.
[3:14:03] You've spent all your time condemning
[3:14:05] the Gentiles. And you won't hear the
[3:14:08] word of the I'm going to the Gentiles.
[3:14:10] And he shook his garment against him. I
[3:14:12] can show you and I will Tuesday night,
[3:14:14] the Lord willing. What about Agabus
[3:14:17] who took the girdle of Paul and wrapped
[3:14:19] it around his arm and and bound up
[3:14:21] himself and said, "This is what's going
[3:14:22] to happen to you if you don't hear the
[3:14:24] word." This is the first church age
[3:14:26] messenger that Agabus, a five-fold
[3:14:29] prophet, is bringing correction to. And
[3:14:32] yet, he goes right on down and and we
[3:14:35] know what happened. And it it had to
[3:14:37] happen that way,
[3:14:39] no doubt. But somebody had to be willing
[3:14:42] to be obedient. And it came in a
[3:14:44] prophetic act. If God said, "I'm going
[3:14:46] to shake Alaska."
[3:14:48] If God said, "That old dragon out there
[3:14:50] is going to shake his tail and I'm going
[3:14:52] to shake Alaska." It shouldn't take
[3:14:54] somebody having to throw a rock in the
[3:14:56] air. But it did
[3:15:00] &gt;&gt; because that's how God deals in the
[3:15:01] prophetic.
[3:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:03] &gt;&gt; He had to set that thing in motion. And
[3:15:05] when he threw that rock up in the air,
[3:15:07] it was a parabolic anointing. It was a
[3:15:10] prophetic act that said now it can
[3:15:12] begin. Now, now is time for that word of
[3:15:16] promise to be activated.
[3:15:19] &gt;&gt; You understand that
[3:15:21] &gt;&gt; it takes some foolish things. Sometime
[3:15:24] God chooses
[3:15:27] the foolish things
[3:15:29] to confound the wives.
[3:15:33] This is part of what it means to be in
[3:15:35] the gazing pot,
[3:15:38] the pot of the vessel of public gaze. If
[3:15:42] you're not tough enough to handle it,
[3:15:45] you've still got time to bail.
[3:15:48] But if I could catch a glimpse and you
[3:15:51] could catch a glimpse of what God has
[3:15:53] promised for those who are willing to
[3:15:55] obey him no matter what the cost.
[3:16:01] There's probably many of us in here who
[3:16:02] have felt like at times God was
[3:16:04] requiring too much of us.
[3:16:07] But he will never ask from us anything
[3:16:11] that he doesn't provide grace
[3:16:14] to be able to do it.
[3:16:18] Do you believe that?
[3:16:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:16:21] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that God is calling most
[3:16:23] of us to prophesy barefoot and naked for
[3:16:26] three years. I don't believe that God is
[3:16:28] calling most of us to hang upside down
[3:16:30] in a whale like Jeremiah. I don't
[3:16:32] necessarily believe that God is. But
[3:16:35] what if he did?
[3:16:40] If you can't obey the voice of the
[3:16:42] spirit when he says, "I want you to go
[3:16:43] up there and worship." I'm not saying
[3:16:45] that he's told any of you that and you
[3:16:46] didn't. But what if he had?
[3:16:51] I do know that there are people among us
[3:16:53] that I love dearly who treat worship
[3:16:55] kind of like it's a a sport of
[3:16:56] observation
[3:16:58] and I I feel sorry for you that you find
[3:17:00] yourself in that place because uh the
[3:17:03] really worship is a is a all hands on
[3:17:06] deck kind of blessing is everybody get
[3:17:08] in while you can and worship God. Don't
[3:17:10] worry about what anybody else is doing
[3:17:12] or saying.
[3:17:13] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to come up here to do
[3:17:14] it. But I'm just saying what if the
[3:17:16] spirit of the Lord's been telling you
[3:17:17] and you didn't do it. You you really
[3:17:19] think God's going to trust you with a
[3:17:20] message to a nation if he can't even
[3:17:23] prod your heart and get you to feel like
[3:17:25] you want and and here's the word of the
[3:17:26] Lord to you. If you don't begin to cry
[3:17:29] out
[3:17:31] to receive and to embrace the promises
[3:17:34] of God that have already been made to
[3:17:36] you.
[3:17:39] I used to would have told you that he'll
[3:17:41] just hold them in reserve until he can
[3:17:44] bring you into a place where you receive
[3:17:46] them. But he showed me clear last night
[3:17:50] and I saw mantels. I saw scrolls. I saw
[3:17:53] commissions. I I saw uh acts of
[3:17:56] obedience. I I couldn't even begin
[3:18:01] to describe it. But I saw it as it as it
[3:18:04] slipped over the shoulders around
[3:18:08] people that I'm standing before today.
[3:18:13] And it just comes filtering down as
[3:18:15] though it was going to fall. And it did
[3:18:16] eventually begin to Someone else reached
[3:18:19] up and said, "I'll take that. My God, I
[3:18:22] want my part. I don't want your part.
[3:18:24] I'm greedy, but not for you, your part.
[3:18:26] I I'm greedy for my part. I want what
[3:18:29] God has promised me, but but but if I
[3:18:33] were you, I'd ask the Lord, Lord, make
[3:18:35] me that that hungry for for it. Lord, if
[3:18:38] there's any promise that applies to me
[3:18:40] uh in this end time thing, I want it. If
[3:18:43] you've made some precious, I want it. I
[3:18:45] I'm going to position myself
[3:18:49] to receive it. I don't want it to fall
[3:18:52] on somebody. I know it would be a
[3:18:53] blessing to them, but if it's mine like
[3:18:57] the little dream they I think even
[3:18:58] brother Brandham told told about it,
[3:19:02] it went all around in the days of the
[3:19:04] healing revival.
[3:19:07] how he stands in the presence of God and
[3:19:10] sees all those packages, all those
[3:19:12] things that could have been his name on
[3:19:15] them.
[3:19:17] Well, why are they here? Why are they
[3:19:18] still here? My name is on them. You
[3:19:20] never ask. You didn't ask for them. So,
[3:19:23] here they sit. Boy, that makes me want
[3:19:24] to be greedy, doesn't it? You? It makes
[3:19:26] me want to say, Lord, if there's
[3:19:27] anything hanging around with my name on
[3:19:29] it, help me get ready
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; to receive it.
[3:19:35] Let's stand.
[3:19:38] There's all kind of nice birthdays this
[3:19:40] week. Brother George Smith turns 80 on
[3:19:44] Tuesday. If you if you know how to reach
[3:19:46] him, harass him.
[3:19:50] There's a possibility that he'll join us
[3:19:53] in October.
[3:19:56] Whether he does or not, I love him. And
[3:20:02] I can't hardly believe he's turned 80.
[3:20:03] He's still going everywhere.
[3:20:06] Maya has a birthday this week. And Naomi
[3:20:10] streaming in the Netherlands has a
[3:20:12] birthday this week. And Tally Talia,
[3:20:17] I call her Taliana
[3:20:20] after Polyiana, but that's not her name.
[3:20:24] She has a birthday this week. She turns
[3:20:26] eight. Is that right? Where is she? She
[3:20:29] in here. Eight years old.
[3:20:32] Sister Martha West has a birthday on
[3:20:34] Thursday. And Sister Flo
[3:20:37] has a birthday on Friday.
[3:20:40] And Sister Natalie Hollowell has one on
[3:20:42] Saturday. And I had written down here
[3:20:45] that we pray for Brother Austin because
[3:20:47] he had some awful kidney stone pain this
[3:20:50] week. I don't have an update, but I have
[3:20:53] certainly prayed for him. Sister Megan
[3:20:56] Kino needed our prayers today. and
[3:20:58] Sister Pam, Aunt Pam Tibo, uh, needed
[3:21:03] some help. She's suffering in her with a
[3:21:06] terrible headache. This is becoming
[3:21:08] common, and we want the Lord to move for
[3:21:11] her. He's an ontime God, isn't he?
[3:21:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure how long we'll be able to
[3:21:17] keep pushing things off. So, we
[3:21:19] certainly want to be led of the Lord in
[3:21:23] all of our decisions, and we want to be
[3:21:26] where God would have us in the in the in
[3:21:28] the right place at the right time to
[3:21:30] receive whatever he has for us. Is that
[3:21:33] how you feel? Do you want to know that
[3:21:35] you're in the perfect leadership of the
[3:21:37] Lord? Even if it looks goofy to people,
[3:21:40] even if people don't understand your
[3:21:42] decision, you you certainly want that.
[3:21:45] Uh, Benjamin, I know it's kind of dry
[3:21:47] right now and and I would normally sing
[3:21:49] to help you get started, but just come.
[3:21:52] I I think I've delivered my my burden
[3:21:55] for this moment. Just come and lead us
[3:21:58] in something to worship the Lord with.
[3:22:01] He's
[3:22:04] [Music]
[3:22:09] the weapon may be formed, but it won't
[3:22:13] prosper.
[3:22:17] And when the darkness falls, it won't
[3:22:20] prevail.
[3:22:24] &gt;&gt; Because the God I serve knows only how
[3:22:28] to triumph.
[3:22:32] And my God will never fail.
[3:22:39] Oh my God will never fail. Cuz
[3:22:46] the weapon may be formed, but it won't
[3:22:51] prosper.
[3:22:54] And when the darkness falls, it won't
[3:22:58] prevail.
[3:23:00] Oh, because the God I serve knows only
[3:23:04] how to triumph.
[3:23:08] Oh, and my God will never fail.
[3:23:14] No,
[3:23:16] my God will never fail.
[3:23:21] And I'm going to see a victory.
[3:23:25] I'm going to see a victory
[3:23:29] for the battle belongs to you, Lord. And

[3:26:06] belongs to you, Lord. Oh, and I'm going
[3:26:11] to see a victory.

[3:27:35] is you take what the enemy meant for
[3:27:39] evil and then you turn it for good. My
[3:27:43] God, you turn it for good.
[3:27:47] And I'm going to see a victory.
[3:27:51] I'm going to see a victory.

[3:29:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to see a victory.
[3:29:26] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:29:31] &gt;&gt; For the battle
[3:29:33] belongs to you, Lord.
[3:29:37] And I'm going to see a victory.
[3:29:40] I'm going to see a victory
[3:29:45] for the battle. It belongs to you, Lord.
[3:29:51] Here we are today. Do with us Lord as
[3:29:56] you desire.
[3:29:58] &gt;&gt; We surrender our will.
[3:30:01] &gt;&gt; We say yes to whatever you require.
[3:30:05] &gt;&gt; We say yes to whatever you would ask of
[3:30:08] us.
[3:30:09] &gt;&gt; Many times the enemy would try to tell
[3:30:11] us that the ship has sailed and we have
[3:30:14] missed our opportunity. And yet today,
[3:30:17] Lord, we hear the call, the upward call
[3:30:20] of the spirit saying, "Now is the time
[3:30:24] to claim, to take possession of every
[3:30:28] promise, to wrap your faith around the
[3:30:31] promise and say, Lord, even now, I'm
[3:30:35] willing to receive it and to be it and
[3:30:38] to do it, to be obedient to you above
[3:30:42] all things." Now Lord, in order to keep
[3:30:46] us that way, you have to shake us
[3:30:49] sometime. And we embrace right now the
[3:30:52] siftings and the shakings of the Lord if
[3:30:56] they'll pull us into a more surrendered
[3:30:58] and submitted life to you. Oh God, cover
[3:31:02] us as you promised in that secret place.
[3:31:06] Stretch forth the pavilion over our
[3:31:10] lives. Oh God, we pray. Lord, whatever
[3:31:14] distracts us right now in this hour,
[3:31:17] would you give us grace and faith to get
[3:31:19] our eyes off of the stuff and get our
[3:31:22] eyes on the promise? And the promise is
[3:31:25] mature sons are going to come forth even
[3:31:28] in this near hour. Lord, this is the
[3:31:30] promise. You're the prize. You're the
[3:31:34] prize. You're the goal. You're the
[3:31:36] vision that is before us. We want to be
[3:31:38] everything you've called us to be. We
[3:31:41] want to do everything you've called us
[3:31:42] to do. And we understand that sometime
[3:31:45] the doing is never found until the
[3:31:48] yielding. So we yield.
[3:31:50] &gt;&gt; We just yield, Lord. It's easy to say
[3:31:53] it, but when you call on us, may we find
[3:31:56] grace to yield even as we have promised.
[3:32:00] Your word matters to us, Lord.
[3:32:03] We we look around this room and we see
[3:32:06] those who struggle and those who have
[3:32:07] problems, huge, big burdens to carry,
[3:32:11] physical needs in their body. You're the
[3:32:14] same healer that you always were. We ask
[3:32:17] you to let healing be manifested in your
[3:32:20] faithfilled people today. Oh God, may
[3:32:24] there be testimonies
[3:32:26] of how you have corrected uh many
[3:32:29] problems and healed many different kinds
[3:32:33] of infirmities because our faith was
[3:32:36] able to reach up and take a hold of the
[3:32:39] promise of who you are. Continue to stir
[3:32:41] us, Lord. Let it become so contagious.
[3:32:45] Let it be like Jeremiah who fell under
[3:32:48] such a prophetic burden of the Lord that
[3:32:50] he said, "When I thought I would shut
[3:32:52] up, when I thought I wouldn't tell it
[3:32:54] anymore, it was like fire shut up in my
[3:32:58] bones. Oh God, may the burden of the
[3:33:01] Lord and his house consume us all. And
[3:33:04] should we try to hold back, may it burn
[3:33:08] in our bones like a fire until we have
[3:33:11] fully yielded and obeyed your voice,
[3:33:14] Jesus. We're not here to play church.
[3:33:17] We're here to rise up and be what you've
[3:33:20] called us to be. Now, Lord, let it be
[3:33:23] that every person can come with us. Let
[3:33:25] it be that every heart would turn toward
[3:33:28] you. Lord, I pray that there would be no
[3:33:30] misunderstanding over what I've shared
[3:33:33] today. I did not want to. I didn't want
[3:33:36] to do it. I did it to be obedient to
[3:33:39] you. Now Lord, it's up to you to touch
[3:33:42] hearts, to open understanding. May no
[3:33:46] one go out of here with some kind of
[3:33:48] misunderstanding, but may they see the
[3:33:50] heart of the matter. May they hear your
[3:33:52] voice in it. Lord, it's time.
[3:33:57] &gt;&gt; It's time.
[3:34:00] The two and the fro has to come to an
[3:34:03] end now. It's time, Lord, for us to
[3:34:05] settle
[3:34:06] &gt;&gt; and get ready.
[3:34:10] It's time, Lord, for us to carry your
[3:34:13] mantle.
[3:34:14] &gt;&gt; May we hunger for it. May we position
[3:34:19] ourselves for it. I love what you've
[3:34:21] already started today. I bless your
[3:34:24] name. You're worthy to be praised. Would
[3:34:26] you just lift your hand to him before we
[3:34:28] leave? I know the time. Would you just
[3:34:31] lift your hand to him? Lord, you're so
[3:34:33] good.
[3:34:34] We could just worship on through the
[3:34:36] afternoon. It would really be easy to do
[3:34:39] that. But I understand.
[3:34:45] May the Lord just strengthen you right
[3:34:47] now. May he just plug you in.
[3:34:49] Hallelujah.
[3:34:51] May he just give you strength and
[3:34:53] energy.
[3:34:55] May he just fill you with his life
[3:34:59] from the oldest to the youngest.
[3:35:03] The very fact that you woke up this
[3:35:05] morning is proof that you're not done.
[3:35:10] &gt;&gt; The very fact that you woke up, you made
[3:35:13] yourself made your way to the house of
[3:35:15] God is proof today that part of this
[3:35:17] word is for you.
[3:35:19] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[3:35:23] [Music]
[3:35:26] Lay your head on his chest.
[3:35:29] Hear his heartbeat.
[3:35:31] Discern his will.
[3:35:34] Find what he wants you to do and do it.
[3:35:41] There's strength when we stand together
[3:35:42] in faith. When we pull away from the
[3:35:45] body, that's when the enemy has room to
[3:35:47] come in and divide. But when we pull
[3:35:49] together into his presence,
[3:35:54] the enemy's choked out,
[3:35:56] &gt;&gt; his distractions become smaller, and our
[3:35:59] determination becomes stronger.
[3:36:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see the victory.
[3:36:05] &gt;&gt; In fact, I want to be the victory. Sing
[3:36:07] a little of that again, just a little
[3:36:08] bit. The battle's yours, Lord.
[3:36:14] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:36:18] I'm going to see a victory
[3:36:20] &gt;&gt; for the battle.
[3:36:22] &gt;&gt; For the battle
[3:36:24] belongs to you, Lord.
[3:36:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to see a victory.
[3:36:32] I'm going to see a victory
[3:36:35] &gt;&gt; for the battle.
[3:36:36] &gt;&gt; For the battle
[3:36:38] belongs to the Lord.
[3:36:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to see a victory.
[3:36:45] I'm going to see a victory
[3:36:49] for the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[3:36:56] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:36:59] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:37:03] For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[3:37:13] How many of you believe you're going to
[3:37:15] see the victory?
[3:37:18] &gt;&gt; I feel
[3:37:35] just do what you want to do, Lord.
[3:37:49] We're just yielded.
[3:37:53] We're not trying to make anything
[3:37:55] happen. We're just yielding.
[3:37:59] We yield.
[3:38:19] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:38:24] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:38:27] For the battle
[3:38:30] &gt;&gt; belongs to the Lord.
[3:38:33] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:38:37] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:38:40] For the battle
[3:38:43] belongs to you, Lord.
[3:38:47] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:38:50] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:38:54] For the battle
[3:38:57] belongs to you, Lord.
[3:39:01] Hear
[3:39:03] me
[3:39:05] in this hour in this sovereign storm.
[3:39:08] Hear me I say me I say I am preparing
[3:39:13] your heart. Seek me with all of your
[3:39:16] hearts. This hour this moment is
[3:39:18] sovereign. This moment is a display of
[3:39:21] my will for you.
[3:39:24] &gt;&gt; Seek me. I am calling you to a higher
[3:39:26] place than it will be. This year I will
[3:39:29] drive you to a high place.
[3:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:39:41] &gt;&gt; We spread our wings, Lord.
[3:39:44] We spread our wings with our eye on the
[3:39:47] higher.
[3:39:48] Lord, we look to the higher.
[3:39:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[3:39:52] &gt;&gt; Our desire to find the higher. Lord, we
[3:39:55] set our wings. We're ready that you
[3:39:58] would carry us to a higher place. Glory
[3:40:01] be to God.
[3:40:04] Glory be to God.
[3:40:09] Glory to his name.
[3:40:28] Oh my,
[3:40:30] he's so good.
[3:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:40:35] &gt;&gt; I want to give you just a moment to love
[3:40:38] one another in this atmosphere. Not a
[3:40:40] lot of chatting, just love. I want to
[3:40:43] give you just a moment to hug those that
[3:40:45] you can get to or God bless you. God
[3:40:48] bless you. God bless you. It's one of
[3:40:52] the highest things that you could say to
[3:40:55] one another is God bless you. I don't
[3:40:58] want to be moving around in time like
[3:40:59] this. No, I I I'm inviting you to I feel
[3:41:01] like that's what he wants us to do. Let
[3:41:04] it go deep.
[3:41:19] God has a purpose, a plan, and he has a
[3:41:22] timing. Amen.
[3:41:24] Amen. I'm waiting on you. Is that right?
[3:41:29] The Lord has a purpose, and he has a
[3:41:31] timing for all things.
[3:41:41] I just want to give you this as you go.
[3:41:44] Get ready to go
[3:41:46] because I'm so thankful that Sister
[3:41:48] Shosana sent that text and I wouldn't
[3:41:50] normally see it, but it just happened to
[3:41:53] flash there on my computer. I didn't see
[3:41:56] it on the phone. I'm so glad that she
[3:41:58] asked, "Do you mean the brown bear or
[3:42:01] the silver?" And I said, "Silver tip
[3:42:03] grizzly." I want to read this to you so
[3:42:06] that you'll have it if you ever need it.
[3:42:08] Uh it is paragraph 11 of one of the
[3:42:11] sermons of the countdown.
[3:42:14] It's 62 September the 9th in the
[3:42:18] morning. The message countdown. And
[3:42:20] these countdown sermons I've gone
[3:42:22] through several of them yesterday
[3:42:25] looking for something and they're
[3:42:27] wonderful.
[3:42:29] In paragraph 11, he said, "So going on
[3:42:31] 32 years of ministry, I've tried to stay
[3:42:34] true to the word. I don't know of one
[3:42:36] thing I've ever had to alter on because
[3:42:38] I read it out of the Bible. Said just
[3:42:40] what the Bible said and let it go like
[3:42:42] that." And so I haven't had to take back
[3:42:45] or rearrange because I just said it the
[3:42:47] way the Bible says it. And I find out if
[3:42:50] God has spoken anything, then we must go
[3:42:52] with that word in order to make it be
[3:42:54] fulfilled.
[3:42:56] We seen that as I told you last night of
[3:42:58] a vision just recently that I had to be
[3:43:01] there, a warning to be there and telling
[3:43:04] me six months before to be on that spot
[3:43:07] and stand there and saying go down there
[3:43:10] three times with them
[3:43:13] and I just walked on with the other men
[3:43:16] and the vision passed right through
[3:43:19] exactly God's part and I was left
[3:43:24] standing.
[3:43:26] So, we want to remember, you've got to
[3:43:28] stay on the word. Just stay right with
[3:43:31] the word. And where the word leads, you
[3:43:34] go right with the word and it'll bring
[3:43:38] you out. All right. I'm sure brother
[3:43:42] Brandham felt pressure to go along. Even
[3:43:45] though the the spirit was calling him in
[3:43:48] another direction, he was considering
[3:43:50] the feelings of the other brothers and
[3:43:53] what they were thinking and what they
[3:43:54] might need. And it moved him out of the
[3:43:58] place that he was supposed to be. And he
[3:44:00] said, "God's part went right through me.
[3:44:04] I was left standing there." Does that
[3:44:07] grieve your heart like it does mine? I'm
[3:44:11] also thankful it happened
[3:44:13] because it's been a lesson to me,
[3:44:17] but I'm I'm I'm grieved. I I would like
[3:44:20] for him to have had what he expected.
[3:44:23] Uh even if it was a bear,
[3:44:26] God gave one to David and he he gave
[3:44:29] them to brother Brandham many times.
[3:44:31] There are those who say, "Well, then he
[3:44:34] had to he'd have to come back and shoot
[3:44:36] that bear." No, because God's part's
[3:44:39] already done. It went right through him.
[3:44:42] I don't want to be in that position that
[3:44:44] I let unsanctified mercy or human
[3:44:48] compassion or uh worries about what
[3:44:51] somebody thinks or how they feel about
[3:44:53] about where we are. I wouldn't want to
[3:44:56] let anything like that hinder an
[3:44:58] appointment with the Lord. Do you
[3:45:01] understand that? I I'd want to be I I
[3:45:04] hear him talking sometime about uh
[3:45:07] situations in the beginning where a
[3:45:10] vision would come and and it would
[3:45:12] almost be right.
[3:45:15] But but no, no, you were supposed to be
[3:45:17] sitting there and you were to be there
[3:45:19] in that chair. Now, if you'll swap
[3:45:21] chairs, can you imagine? I can. I can
[3:45:24] imagine. That don't stretch me at all.
[3:45:27] It helps me. So, so you get where you're
[3:45:30] supposed to be and you get where you're
[3:45:32] supposed to be and then we can move on
[3:45:34] in the fulfillment of the vision. Does
[3:45:37] that make any sense to anybody?
[3:45:40] Boy, it's bigger than I can tell you.
[3:45:43] Lord, go with us today. I I just feel
[3:45:46] like you're pleased. I know there are
[3:45:48] those among us who would now like for it
[3:45:50] to go here or go there or to be this or
[3:45:52] to be that, but that's not your plan for
[3:45:55] for right now.
[3:45:57] uh you want us to chew
[3:46:00] and digest and meditate and contemplate
[3:46:03] and ruminate on what you've said
[3:46:07] so that we can be quick to obey.
[3:46:11] Again, I ask Lord that no one would
[3:46:12] leave with a misunderstanding but that
[3:46:15] we could go with peace here today.
[3:46:18] And I just pray Lord that in this hour
[3:46:21] of
[3:46:25] enlistment
[3:46:28] that your troops would volunteer
[3:46:31] willingly
[3:46:33] as the scripture speaks.
[3:46:36] We volunteer willingly
[3:46:39] to be what you have us to be. Bless our
[3:46:42] children. Bless these mamas who are
[3:46:44] expecting.
[3:46:46] Bless those who are traveling home
[3:46:47] today.
[3:46:49] [Music]
[3:46:50] We give you glory and honor.
[3:46:53] It's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:46:54] Christ we pray. And the saints said,
[3:46:57] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you leave here
[3:46:59] today. I want to say this as you're
[3:47:00] slipping out. We have a little bit of a
[3:47:03] need uh uh in the church. God has been
[3:47:06] very good and faithful to us. I try not
[3:47:08] to ever be one who mentions it because
[3:47:10] we are certainly moving forward on other
[3:47:13] projects. But we have some equipment
[3:47:16] that needs to be updated and uh it's
[3:47:20] it's costly. And as far as the budget,
[3:47:23] well, we've got the bills paid for the
[3:47:25] month, but we're probably going to need
[3:47:28] what we have in surplus to start paying
[3:47:31] first of the month bills pretty soon. So
[3:47:33] if the Lord would speak to your heart
[3:47:35] and you want to mark something, you
[3:47:36] could market media, you could market
[3:47:38] equipment, uh you could do anything like
[3:47:41] that and it would be greatly
[3:47:43] appreciated. Uh Benjamin has sent his he
[3:47:46] purchased it, but he sent his uh he's
[3:47:51] had some problems with his in-ear
[3:47:52] monitor for leading worship and sent it
[3:47:55] off and got a new cord. Got the new cord
[3:47:57] back and the whole thing sort of went
[3:48:00] out and we've sent it off. We have no
[3:48:02] idea what the cost to repair it would be
[3:48:04] and it might even require it to be
[3:48:06] replaced. And we've got some storage
[3:48:08] equipment up there that's got that needs
[3:48:10] to be replaced. And we've just purchased
[3:48:13] equipment for the fellowship hall for
[3:48:15] sound so that we can have some uh m nice
[3:48:20] good worship down there. We're thankful
[3:48:23] for that. And uh if you just feel to
[3:48:26] over the next few weeks just put it in.
[3:48:29] You can market media or you can uh
[3:48:32] equipment or whatever. I just wanted you
[3:48:34] to be aware of the need with no
[3:48:35] pressure. If the spirit says so, help
[3:48:38] us. If not, pray that the need will be
[3:48:40] met. Amen.
[3:48:42] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed to go.
[3:48:44] Go in peace.
[3:48:47] Let's be sensitive to what the Lord has
[3:48:50] Tuesday night 7:00.
[3:48:55] I'm going to see victory
[3:49:01] for the battle.
[3:49:04] God bless you, Elisha. I love you. God
[3:49:08] bless you.
[3:49:12] &gt;&gt; Mimi's for Papa's birthday.
[3:49:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to celebrate Papa's
[3:49:16] birthday today?
[3:49:22] Oh, look at these.
[3:49:25] What a handsome boy.
[3:49:28] I love you, Isaiah.
[3:49:31] Very much.
[3:49:33] Look at these sweet girls. Oh, God bless
[3:49:36] you,
[3:49:39] [Music]
[3:49:42] Oh, God bless you, Maya.
[3:49:45] Look here. Tally the birthday girl.
[3:49:48] Just a few days
[3:49:51] I'm going to see a victory.
[3:49:57] God bless you, Joseph.
[3:49:59] [Music]
[3:50:02] Hello, Aana.
[3:50:05] I didn't mention
[3:50:07] I didn't I don't know why I didn't, but
[3:50:09] I didn't mention that we've got a brand
[3:50:11] new little baby in the house this
[3:50:15] morning for the first time.
[3:50:17] We're so happy to have Abel.
[3:50:24] I know.
[3:50:26] Thank y'all though.
[3:50:30] The Lord has touched Sister Ashley. We
[3:50:34] were praying for her and the Lord's
[3:50:36] touched her. I'm so thankful. Scared us
[3:50:38] a little bit. Faith had to kick in.
[3:50:41] Amen. And has touched him as well. Abel
[3:50:45] Joshua Yantis.
[3:50:49] What threw me was T-Bo was trying to pop
[3:50:51] up, but mama's T-Bo, baby's Yantis.
[3:50:56] Uh let's make sure we continue to pray
[3:50:59] for them and love them and let them
[3:51:01] know. Uh how many of you glad to have a
[3:51:03] new one with us?
[3:51:07] [Applause]
[3:51:10] Glory.
[3:51:12] Glory.
