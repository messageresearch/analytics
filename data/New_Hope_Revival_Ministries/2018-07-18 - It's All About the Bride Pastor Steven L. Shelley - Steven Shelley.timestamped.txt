[0:00] it started with God it started with his
[0:04] love and yet it's not all about God it's
[0:09] not all about Jesus it's not all about
[0:12] the bridegroom everything we read in
[0:17] that word is about a greater pursuit
[0:20] it's about a greater love story
[0:23] it is not about your response to him it
[0:30] is about his desire for you you are the
[0:36] object of his affection when you realize
[0:42] that then you say not with your mouth
[0:46] with your life it's all about Jesus it's
[0:53] all about the bread I've experienced
[0:57] some things that were as far away from
[0:59] the fragrance of rose as you could
[1:02] possibly be but when I get through it
[1:05] and when I get over it and when I get
[1:08] finished with it I'm going to smell like
[1:11] him because that's what's on the
[1:14] Sullivan prophesy that's what Sullivan
[1:17] prophesied in his song over the bride
[1:19] and I'm going to come out of the
[1:21] wilderness not seeing how I can make it
[1:24] alone
[1:25] but leaning you know the difference
[1:29] between Laodicea Laodicea Church says I
[1:32] don't need anybody I don't need it
[1:35] but the bride says oh god I can't even
[1:39] get up out of this wilderness
[1:41] unless I'm leaning on my beloved I can't
[1:45] walk on my own I can't talk on my own I
[1:48] can't live on my own I must be leaning
[1:52] on him she's lived her life in the
[1:56] wilderness but I tell you there's a time
[1:59] that we called the bride's revival and
[2:02] in that branch revival the bride comes
[2:04] up out of that wilderness leading on her
[2:07] bridegroom leaning on her beloved and
[2:10] she smells like him and thinks like him
[2:13] and walks like him and talks like him
[2:16] and in that moment you'll understand
[2:19] it's all about the bride he placed in
[2:25] his bride a seed and that seed is him
[2:31] and that seed in you didn't make you a
[2:35] Jew and that seed in you didn't make you
[2:38] a bride his seed in you made you a part
[2:43] of him I thought you were unworthy I
[2:49] thought you were the ratings and the
[2:51] scrapings I thought you were failures
[2:55] and so broken you couldn't get up and
[2:59] the devil told us all those things you
[3:02] know how we've been made to feel and
[3:04] wouldn't you think that feeling that
[3:06] love wouldn't make you see Jesus you
[3:11] can't see Jesus with those lies all you
[3:16] seeis how unlike him you are all you see
[3:19] is your ugly mug when you look in the
[3:21] mirror it's only when you understand
[3:25] [Music]
[3:28] he did it all
[3:34] for a bride
[3:38] [Music]
[3:50] you
