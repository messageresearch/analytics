[0:37] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly
[0:40] and you're watching the Eagles cry it's
[0:43] a real joy to welcome you to the
[0:45] broadcast today and to let you know that
[0:47] I count it a privilege to be able to
[0:50] speak to you in the holy and exalted
[0:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[0:56] Messiah it's a joy and I mean that I
[1:00] thank him for the strength and the
[1:01] health to be able to come to you today
[1:04] and share with you some of the good news
[1:07] I hope I can encourage you along the way
[1:10] to keep pressing on toward Christ toward
[1:14] the lord Jesus whatever you're dealing
[1:16] with in your life right now it may be
[1:19] tough it may look Bleak but I want you
[1:22] to know that there is hope and life in
[1:26] the Lord Jesus if you'll trust him with
[1:29] everything that that is within you he is
[1:31] faithful to bring us through if we can
[1:34] help you in your in your need of prayer
[1:37] you have a need physically or
[1:40] spiritually you need provision the one
[1:42] thing that we can do is stand with you
[1:46] in faith and in prayer so feel free to
[1:49] contact our ministry and we will
[1:52] certainly take your needs with a
[1:54] petition before the Lord and you know
[1:57] what I just believe if we pray together
[2:00] he'll hear the prayer that's what the
[2:01] scripture said where two or more agree
[2:05] as touching on any one thing in my name
[2:07] he said well I'm going to give it to
[2:10] them and you know what in my life he has
[2:13] a proven track record I've been
[2:15] following the Lord for a long time he
[2:18] came to me as a small child and and
[2:21] invited me to follow him to be his
[2:24] disciple and uh I've been following him
[2:27] I have made many mistakes along the way
[2:30] and uh I thank him for Grace I thank him
[2:33] for Mercy I love the fact that he's
[2:36] patient with folk like me to teach me
[2:39] and sometimes retach me have you ever
[2:42] learned a lesson that you didn't learn
[2:44] all the way and he had to come and bring
[2:46] that back around and teach you all over
[2:48] again well that's how it works with our
[2:51] own children uh certain lessons they
[2:53] learn right away certain children learn
[2:56] faster than others some children if they
[2:59] touch the the hot stove one time they
[3:01] never touch it again they suffer that
[3:04] little bit of pain and that is the end
[3:06] of that and then there are other
[3:08] children who seem to possess a strong
[3:11] will and they'll touch it several times
[3:14] to see if they get the same results and
[3:16] they will if you touch a hot stove I
[3:19] don't care how many times if it's still
[3:21] hot it's going to hurt and you know God
[3:24] is patient he's patient with each of us
[3:27] uh if we're one of those who touches it
[3:29] one once and then moves on to the next
[3:31] lesson or if we're one of those that
[3:34] just has to keep testing and trying it
[3:36] to see if it'll hurt every time you know
[3:39] I'm afraid I've been I've been the
[3:40] ladder a time or two and and I've had to
[3:43] touch it again and go back around that
[3:45] mountain again to learn what what God
[3:48] wanted me to learn but I'm better off
[3:51] for it and you will be too uh try not to
[3:54] get discouraged in the school of life
[3:56] and let God teach you and train you with
[3:58] the patience that he has I tell you he
[4:01] has more patience even than than a
[4:04] mother he really does to just keep
[4:07] working in our lives and bringing us
[4:09] through for his glory for his mighty
[4:13] purposes uh we are studying together the
[4:16] spirit and power of Elijah past present
[4:19] and future and we're looking at Malachi
[4:23] 45 and six for our theme where the
[4:26] scripture promises behold I will send
[4:29] you a Elijah the prophet before the
[4:31] great and terrible day of the Lord this
[4:34] indicates to us that the spirit and
[4:37] power of Elijah was of such significance
[4:40] in the mind of God that it was to be
[4:43] sent and resent to the Earth and so to
[4:47] help us understand uh the
[4:50] characteristics of the Elijah from
[4:53] scripture that Prophet that we're
[4:55] familiar with uh we that this is how we
[4:59] uh helped to discern other visitations
[5:03] other applications of the spirit and
[5:06] power of Elijah by looking at the life
[5:08] of the original one and so uh I was
[5:11] looking at a scripture here just a
[5:13] moment ago in First Kings chapter
[5:16] 17 uh beginning in verse one where it
[5:19] talks about really this is some training
[5:23] going on for Elijah and it says and
[5:26] Elijah the tishbite who was of the
[5:29] inhabit of Gilead said unto Ahab as the
[5:32] Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I
[5:35] stand there shall not be due nor rain
[5:39] these years but according to my word up
[5:43] to this point we don't know very much
[5:45] about Elijah the Bible doesn't talk much
[5:48] about his formative years his his uh you
[5:52] know childhood his teenage years his
[5:55] schooling or training or uh we don't
[5:58] know very much about him at all and all
[6:00] of a sudden he appears on the scene
[6:02] Elijah the tishbite and he is
[6:05] prophesying to the king and so there are
[6:08] things that we don't know about him but
[6:10] I can assure you that he was in school
[6:13] from the time he was born Spirit school
[6:17] where God was teaching him and training
[6:19] him to get him ready to be able to
[6:22] deliver what a bold and courageous move
[6:25] it was for Elijah to go right up and
[6:28] give the word of the Lord to the king
[6:31] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[6:33] saying verse two now verse three get
[6:36] thee hint and turn Eastward and hide
[6:39] thyself by the Brook cherith that is
[6:42] before Jordan this was the first
[6:45] characteristic that we were talking
[6:47] about on the Last Broadcast and that is
[6:50] Elijah was a man of the Wilderness he
[6:54] understood because God instructed him so
[6:57] to pull himself away he Ood the value of
[7:01] being separated in fact the very Brook
[7:04] of water that God sent Elijah to was
[7:08] called cherith and that is before Jordan
[7:12] it's it's it leads into the Jordan River
[7:16] and that word chth means separated so
[7:19] this was a further level of Separation
[7:23] in the life of Elijah uh what I want you
[7:27] to know is that when God pulls you away
[7:31] when he slows you down gives you the
[7:34] unction to pull aside and because he
[7:36] wants to speak to you he's not going to
[7:39] leave you there by yourself he's going
[7:41] to show up he's going to make provision
[7:45] he's going to minister to you and that's
[7:47] what we find out here in First Kings 17
[7:50] verse 4 and it shall be that thou shalt
[7:53] drink of the
[7:55] Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to
[7:58] feed thee there so this chapter begins
[8:01] with a prophecy that says there shall be
[8:04] neither due nor rain these years but
[8:07] according to my word what a bold
[8:09] statement Elijah said it's not going to
[8:11] rain again and no Dew is going to form
[8:14] on the ground in the morning unless I
[8:17] prophesy it unless I decree it unless I
[8:19] declare it this sounds like a drought on
[8:22] the horizon and sure enough we read the
[8:24] scripture and find out that's exactly
[8:26] what was happening and it wasn't going
[8:28] to change until Elijah the prophet
[8:30] called for the change called for the
[8:33] shift but God said Elijah I'm going to
[8:36] pull you aside down here to the brook
[8:38] cherith separate you from what's going
[8:40] on in the earth just like he did uh in
[8:43] Goan when the children of Israel were
[8:46] protected of the plagues that were being
[8:49] sent to Egypt to deal with the stiffness
[8:51] of Pharaoh's heart and yet God had his
[8:54] people down there in that little area
[8:56] called Goan where they were protected
[8:59] from from the from the fierceness of the
[9:01] plague the worst of the fierceness of
[9:04] those plagues they were protected so
[9:06] here's Elijah in his little Goan uh by
[9:10] the Brook and God said though there be
[9:12] no water falling and no water rising
[9:15] from the ground there will still be
[9:16] water in that Brook how many of you know
[9:19] if it's not raining eventually there's
[9:21] not going to be any water and and rather
[9:24] quickly in in the land of the Bible
[9:27] where it only rains a few short weeks
[9:29] weeks out of the entire year I've been
[9:31] in Israel enough to know that when
[9:34] there's no rain it is Dusty dry and when
[9:38] it begins to rain the ground is so hard
[9:42] that it cannot even receive the rain and
[9:45] the rain just washes off the top of the
[9:47] hard dirt and I've been to places where
[9:50] it comes so quickly through those Wades
[9:53] that it just washes the road away cars
[9:55] and everything and and it happens so
[9:58] quickly that people don't even realize
[10:00] it's going to happen and so if there was
[10:02] a if there was a drought on top of the
[10:05] dry season we're talking about a
[10:08] terrible situation and yet God said you
[10:10] go right down there to that Brook and
[10:12] I'll give you water to drink this helps
[10:14] me it encourages me to know that I if
[10:18] God is leading he's providing he's
[10:21] taking care of my needs if I can only
[10:24] learn to trust him and listen at this
[10:27] you're not only going to have water
[10:29] water to drink but I have commanded the
[10:32] birds the Ravens to feed thee there I
[10:36] mean that's good news now how God was
[10:39] going to do that I don't know if it was
[10:41] going to be supernaturally created bread
[10:45] or if God was going to send the Raven
[10:48] down to the neighbor's house uh uh where
[10:50] the bread was cooling on the wind seal
[10:54] and God said my Prophet needs some of
[10:56] that and the Raven just goes down picks
[10:58] it up with his beat carries it to Elijah
[11:00] I don't know how the food was provided
[11:03] but it it wasn't Elijah's he didn't cook
[11:05] it he didn't have the supplies to make
[11:07] it and yet God fed the Prophet Elijah by
[11:11] the birds of the air so he went and did
[11:13] according to the word of the Lord for he
[11:15] went and dwelt by the Brook cherith that
[11:18] is before Jordan and the Ravens brought
[11:20] him bread and flesh now don't don't
[11:23] forget that wasn't just bread but at
[11:26] least a sandwich because it there was
[11:28] bread and meat in the morning and bread
[11:32] and flesh in the evening and he drank of
[11:34] the brook two full meals a day and it
[11:38] came to pass after a while that the
[11:40] brook dried up because there had been no
[11:43] rain in the land now God could have
[11:46] continued to supernaturally supply The
[11:49] Source but it was time for a change of
[11:53] location and so that's what happened the
[11:55] brook ran dry let me encourage you that
[11:58] if you're in a situation where the
[12:00] supply is cut off and the brook runs dry
[12:03] that's not a time to be upset with God
[12:06] that's not a time to say he's forgotten
[12:09] me he was providing for me so well and
[12:11] then all of a sudden he stopped perhaps
[12:14] he's trying to speak to your heart
[12:16] perhaps he's trying to reassign you lead
[12:18] you on to new and fresh territory it
[12:21] might be geographical it might be just
[12:24] spiritual he may be just getting ready
[12:26] to take you to another level in the
[12:29] of the spirit and in the in the arena of
[12:32] ministry and so we have to be sensitive
[12:35] to his voice you know we get comfortable
[12:38] amen we get comfortable and and we we
[12:41] like it things are going good and and
[12:44] people really love me here and uh all is
[12:47] well and I have what I need and the next
[12:50] thing you know the spirit comes by and
[12:52] says I need you over there and you say
[12:54] wait a minute I I'm very happy here I
[12:58] don't want to go anywhere where else and
[12:59] so what does God end up having to do
[13:02] sometime he has to end up letting the
[13:04] Brook Run dry so that we get the picture
[13:08] and uh I think I've talked about that
[13:10] that one that that child that we have
[13:13] sometime that keeps touching the stove
[13:15] because he has to learn the lesson I
[13:17] have to be honest and tell you that I
[13:19] have missed this this subtle message of
[13:22] the Lord rather really it's not so
[13:24] subtle it's pretty obvious when the
[13:26] Supply runs out something's got to be
[13:28] adjusted Ted and it may not always mean
[13:31] God sending you somewhere else it it may
[13:34] not mean that always but it means that
[13:36] you need to stop and re-evaluate what's
[13:39] going on and and make sure that you're
[13:41] still uh functioning in the fullness of
[13:44] what God would have for you in this
[13:46] particular season now I might mention
[13:50] that when the brook ran dry God didn't
[13:52] forget about his needs he was just
[13:54] moving him on to another place and we
[13:56] won't do it maybe right this moment but
[13:59] we could we could talk about the next
[14:02] level of of provision well why don't I
[14:04] just read it uh verse eight and the word
[14:06] of the Lord came unto him again saying
[14:08] or unto him saying arise get thee to
[14:11] zarapa which belongeth to zidon and
[14:14] dwell there behold I have commanded a
[14:16] widow woman there to sustain thee see he
[14:21] commanded that the brook continue to to
[14:23] supply his water and that the Raven
[14:25] bring him bread and flesh in the morning
[14:27] and bread and flesh in the evening when
[14:29] the brook ran dry the Ravens quit coming
[14:32] God had it all in his hand and so he
[14:34] said get up it's time for you to change
[14:37] locations but don't worry I have already
[14:40] commanded did you see this I have
[14:42] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[14:46] thee I've already prepared her I've
[14:48] already chosen her and uh there's a
[14:51] great scripture in the New Testament
[14:53] that talks about that there were many
[14:54] many widows in Israel at that time but
[14:57] it was one that was chosen Chen elected
[15:00] selected by God to be used in the
[15:04] sustaining of the Elijah Ministry of the
[15:07] ministry that Elijah had in that hour
[15:10] everyone wasn't wasn't selected to do
[15:12] that but this particular widow woman was
[15:15] commanded and Elijah arose uh verse 10
[15:19] and went to zarap and when he came to
[15:21] the gate of the city behold the widow
[15:23] woman was there Gathering sticks and he
[15:27] called to her and said fetch me I pray a
[15:29] little water in a vessel that I may
[15:31] drink that's that's a little bit Bold
[15:33] And as as she was going to fetch it he
[15:36] called to her now remember there was
[15:37] this law of hospitality and so that was
[15:41] uh you know relatively not a shocking
[15:44] thing uh I need some water I'm traveling
[15:47] but after that he calls to her and and
[15:51] says fetch me I pray thee first a little
[15:53] water and then he said bring me I pray
[15:55] thee a morsel of bread in thy hand now
[15:58] he said asking for a snack and uh so she
[16:02] responds and says as the Lord thy God
[16:05] liveth I don't have a cake of bread but
[16:08] a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[16:10] little oil in a cruise and behold I'm
[16:13] out Gathering two sticks and that I may
[16:16] go in and dress it for me and my son
[16:18] that we may eat it and die now I don't
[16:22] know if you hear the hopelessness in
[16:23] that but I do we've got just enough oil
[16:27] and just enough meal to make one little
[16:30] cake we're going to divide it we're
[16:32] going to eat it we're going to lay down
[16:34] and die because there's nothing else no
[16:36] more meal in the barrel no more oil in
[16:39] the cruise and then Elijah challenges
[16:42] her her faith in an unbelievably
[16:46] powerful way I love this he said unto
[16:49] her fear not do you know fear paralyzes
[16:54] us from stepping out in faith and and
[16:57] how many times in the Bible does the
[17:00] captain of the host show up the an angel
[17:04] uh a messenger of God uh Gabriel you
[17:08] know great great uh instances in the
[17:11] scripture where something super
[17:12] Supernatural takes place and a a mighty
[17:15] visitation entails and the and the
[17:18] greeting the salutation is fear not why
[17:22] is it that way because that messenger
[17:25] knows that fear is in the house fear is
[17:27] present and and fear paralyzes Faith
[17:31] there's a remedy for fear the Bible said
[17:34] perfect love casteth out fear and if the
[17:38] enemy can can SE fear in our lives he
[17:42] really can paralyze us from doing the
[17:45] will of the father and so the prophet
[17:48] under the unction and inspiration of the
[17:51] Holy Spirit deals with the fear first
[17:54] and and explains to her that she should
[17:57] not be afraid to go and do as thou has
[18:01] said just continue on with your program
[18:04] but make me a little cake first she's
[18:07] already told him she doesn't have a cake
[18:09] she's just got a little bit left she's
[18:11] going to have to make a a mini cake and
[18:14] now he says make me one first if there's
[18:16] not enough to make one cake only a mini
[18:19] cake how is he asking for a cake but he
[18:22] does make me a little cake first and
[18:25] bring it unto me and after
[18:28] make for thee and for thy son for thus
[18:33] saith the Lord God of Israel this is
[18:36] powerful word uh the barrel of meal
[18:40] shall not waste neither shall the cruise
[18:43] of oil fail until the day that the Lord
[18:47] sendeth rain upon the earth now that was
[18:50] a promise on multiple levels a promise
[18:55] that I don't care how many cakes you
[18:57] make I don't care how many times you
[19:00] visit that meal Barrel there's always
[19:02] going to be enough meal there to make
[19:05] the necessary cake I don't care how much
[19:08] oil you use in making those cakes every
[19:11] time you go back to that cruise of oil
[19:14] it will not fail now I want you to
[19:17] notice that there was no promise here
[19:20] that it would be filled up I don't see
[19:23] anywhere where it says the next time you
[19:25] go to the meal Barrel it's going to be
[19:26] full and running over and the next time
[19:28] you you go to get oil from the cruise
[19:31] it's going to be you know gushing out
[19:33] the top but what the promise is is that
[19:36] the meal shall never waste and the oil
[19:40] shall never fail and what that what I
[19:42] believe that means I may be adding a
[19:44] little bit here to by my own
[19:47] understanding but here's what I think
[19:49] that means because I've watched God move
[19:51] this way basically every time she went
[19:54] to that Barrel she had to use Faith she
[19:57] had to reach in and get the last bit of
[20:00] meal and God would always keep putting
[20:04] meal in that Barrel every time she went
[20:07] to use the oil but when she would look
[20:09] back there it would not have been
[20:11] diminished there was still just enough
[20:14] meal just enough oil not a full vessel
[20:19] but she'd pour it out and yet look back
[20:22] and there would be just enough so each
[20:24] time she made a cake she had to exercise
[20:28] her faith in that promise oh my that's a
[20:32] key that's a key for you and I each time
[20:36] if you know sometimes we say if I just
[20:38] had a a million dollars what could I do
[20:41] for God if I just had a way of all my
[20:43] bills being paid I wouldn't worry I
[20:45] wouldn't be in such a fix so forth and
[20:48] Etc we just have all these ideas in
[20:51] America people say things like if I
[20:53] could win the lottery you know if I
[20:55] could hit the jackpot uh I want you to
[20:58] know if you had uh all that abundance
[21:01] falling down on you you might not have
[21:03] to use your faith you might even forget
[21:06] about the God who supplied it the next
[21:08] thing you know you might start thinking
[21:10] you did something good to earn all of
[21:13] that in the storehouse and so uh in
[21:16] order for for God to keep us sometime in
[21:18] a place where we continue to put our
[21:21] full trust and all of our hope in him
[21:24] and in his promise we find that there's
[21:27] not a a full barrel of meal and a full
[21:29] Cruise of oil but have have you ever
[21:32] found out I have that God often as you
[21:36] pour it out you look back and there it
[21:38] is again filled up spiritually speaking
[21:41] here filled up you know you you you
[21:44] write the last check and you wonder how
[21:46] you're going to write the next one but
[21:48] somehow God supplies somehow the need is
[21:51] there sometimes you surprise yourself
[21:53] you get surprised at how God
[21:56] supplies uh and I don't mean you know
[21:59] always enough to waste and and and to
[22:02] spree but but my God shall supply all of
[22:07] my needs according to his riches in
[22:10] glory I believe that promise I truly
[22:13] believe it and so every time and and
[22:16] listen at this that is going to continue
[22:20] God said that is going to continue until
[22:23] the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon
[22:27] the Earth that's the prophecy of Elijah
[22:29] so she not only got a present promise
[22:32] one for right now every time you need
[22:34] the a meal it'll be there every time you
[22:37] need oil it'll be there until the day
[22:40] until the day that the rain begins so
[22:43] what God was giving her was a promise
[22:45] for the present and a promise for the
[22:47] future as long as you need this Supply
[22:50] it will be there but as soon as the rain
[22:52] begins to fall again God will use
[22:55] another means to supply your need how
[22:58] did Elijah learn that lesson CU it had
[23:01] just happened it was happening to him
[23:03] God sent him down there the birds fed
[23:06] him the brook gave him water now God
[23:08] said go I've got a widow prepared and so
[23:11] really he wasn't afraid to put that on
[23:13] her because he knew that God had already
[23:16] set her aside that's what it means God
[23:19] has prepared a widow it seems like that
[23:21] she was still moving in some
[23:23] hopelessness because she said we're
[23:25] going to lay down and die but she had
[23:27] been prepared preped by God to sustain
[23:31] in that hour I I love this promise it it
[23:35] really encourages uh encourages me to
[23:39] keep believing and keep pressing forward
[23:43] and she went verse 15 and did according
[23:47] to the saying of Elijah and she and he
[23:52] and her house did eat many days now we
[23:56] know why God gave this promise through
[23:58] Elijah he was going to stick around he
[24:01] wasn't just going to eat that one cake
[24:03] he was going to get to enjoy cakes from
[24:06] her oven day after day after day as God
[24:11] continued to supply and sustain and
[24:14] verse 16 gives us the Fulfillment and
[24:17] the barrel of meal wasted not Hallelujah
[24:21] neither did the cruise of oil fail
[24:24] according to the word of the Lord which
[24:26] he spake by
[24:29] Elijah and then it goes on and we
[24:31] continue to read of the exploits of
[24:35] Elijah the prophet so I want you to know
[24:38] that before God could launch Elijah into
[24:42] the fullness of his Destiny he had to
[24:46] pull him aside and deal with him
[24:49] challenge him stretch him a little bit
[24:51] work on him I want to just briefly
[24:54] mention the second characteristic as we
[24:57] leave you today
[24:59] Elijah preached without fear against the
[25:03] religious order and the spiritual Norm
[25:08] of his day to call people back to the
[25:12] faith now this is a powerful attribute
[25:16] and characteristic in the life of this
[25:20] Elijah the prophet he preached without
[25:23] fear against the religious order and the
[25:26] spiritual Norm of his day to call people
[25:30] back to the faith how long halt ye and
[25:33] one of the ways he did that we'll talk
[25:35] about it next time we're together he
[25:37] started out in this challenge how long
[25:42] halt ye between two opinions if God be
[25:46] God serve God I want to say that to you
[25:50] I want to leave that thought in your
[25:51] mind how long will you stand on the
[25:55] fence between two religions between two
[25:58] Fai faiths if Jesus be God then turn
[26:02] loose of your other gods and serve the
[26:06] Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart
[26:09] yes you'll be misunderstood yes many of
[26:12] you will be rejected in your culture yes
[26:15] many of you will have you'll create
[26:17] problems in your family but I want you
[26:19] to know that you can't hold on to God
[26:23] the Living God Jehovah God the god of
[26:26] the Bible the god of Jesus Christ you
[26:29] can't hold on to that God and hold on to
[26:32] the god of another religion and another
[26:34] Faith there are not many ways to God
[26:37] there's one way to God Jesus said I am
[26:40] the way the truth and the life and no
[26:44] man cometh unto the father but by Me
[26:48] Jesus is the door he is the gate if
[26:51] you're ever going to get to God you'll
[26:53] have to go by Jesus Christ Lord I ask
[26:57] you right right now to minister to every
[27:01] need that is represented in this
[27:04] television congregation right now around
[27:07] the world I ask you to continue to teach
[27:11] and lead and equip us to follow you with
[27:15] all of our hearts release your healing
[27:18] virtue I pray right now in the mighty
