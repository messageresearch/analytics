[0:00] when we praise we are emphasizing what
[0:03] God has done the horse and ride are
[0:05] thrown into the
[0:08] sea but when we worship we're not
[0:11] emphasizing as much what God has done
[0:15] we're now emphasizing who God
[0:19] sh who God
[0:26] is many people never get that far
[0:30] many praisers never get to
[0:34] worship many have not yet experienced
[0:38] being bathed in your own
[0:42] tears because you praised beyond your
[0:46] manhood your
[0:49] manliness you praised beyond your per
[0:52] I'm going to preach today if I have to D
[0:54] I'm going to preach it you praise beyond
[0:57] your
[0:58] dignity you praised beyond your
[1:03] reputation your staunchness your
[1:05] religion call it what it is it's
[1:11] religion you can praise with
[1:14] religion but real worship only takes
[1:18] place with
[1:20] [Applause]
[1:21] relationship so if all you have is is a
[1:24] religious connection to God you'll be a
[1:27] wonderful praiser but if if you want to
[1:30] move beyond the realm of Praise into the
[1:32] realm of worship so the glory can fall
[1:34] down on your head and Change Your
[1:37] Life Worship comes out of an overflow of
[1:41] a relationship of intimacy with God
[1:44] Almighty with our savior and bridegroom
[1:47] King the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua see
[1:51] worship is not focusing on on the might
[1:53] of his hand or the strength of his arm
[1:56] worship is is focusing on simply who he
[1:59] is is You're
[2:02] Beautiful
[2:05] Jesus You're
[2:08] Beautiful Jesus I well I'm just not
[2:10] comfortable calling another man
[2:16] beautiful then you didn't praise your
[2:18] way to this place because if you praised
[2:21] your way to this place you forgot all
[2:23] that stuff you quit struggling over how
[2:26] a man can be the bride of Christ and how
[2:29] a woman can be the Son of God you get
[2:31] woo I'm preaching yes you get all that
[2:35] settled in the realm of Praise so the
[2:37] truth is some of us haven't praised
[2:40] enough we ought to be looking forward to
[2:42] some glorious days because some of our
[2:45] folks have some catching up to
[2:48] do with their
[2:50] praise because if you're still thinking
[2:53] like
[2:54] that I could never tell another man he's
[2:57] beautiful then why don't you remember
[2:59] that he's not not just a man he's God
[3:02] Almighty and there was a time in his
[3:05] life and Ministry that there was no
[3:07] Beauty in him to be found and no
[3:09] comeliness but I want you to know from
[3:12] the Mount of
[3:13] transfiguration when God glorified him
[3:16] even the marring that took place at
[3:18] Calvary none of that could take away
[3:21] from the resurrected beauty of the
[3:22] glorified
[3:24] Christ because congregations that will
[3:27] not entertain the glory in the last days
[3:30] will be judged not in the end they'll be
[3:33] judged in the last
[3:35] days congregations that will not
[3:38] entertain the glory of the Lord the
[3:39] angel of God will come and write kabot
[3:42] over the
[3:44] door and that is the last plague brother
[3:47] brandom said that is spiritual
[3:50] death when he talks about spiritual
[3:52] death he's not talking about out there
[3:55] right he's talking among those who claim
[3:58] to know the truth you'll sit right on
[4:00] the Pew and drop and die if you're not
[4:03] careful because you want to fit into
[4:05] some kind of a of a mold that someone
[4:09] has created but there's going to come an
[4:11] hour I'm telling you I believe it with
[4:13] all my heart that God's no longer going
[4:16] to tolerate
[4:17] religion in his
[4:20] house and he's going to deal with those
[4:22] places that refuse to entertain the
[4:25] presence of the
[4:28] Lord
