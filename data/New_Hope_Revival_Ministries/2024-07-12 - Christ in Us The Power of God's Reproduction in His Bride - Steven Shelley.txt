TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can't know the fatherly aspect of God unless it is revealed to you by the son Nobody Knows the father like the son and nobody knows the son like the father and when we have the Son of God he reveals to us the nature and the character of the Father which is sometimes uh in our human way of thinking uh a little regiment or a little rigid but I want you to know the Father's Love For Us is so great that he has paid the ultimate sacrifice he became the son he stepped down into a condescended form died on the cross securing eternal life for us does that sound like somebody who hates you does that sound like somebody who wants to crush you to powder no it sounds like somebody who loves us and loved us with such a love that he came up with a masterful plan that he might be able to win us and to redeem us oh what a blessed people we are redeemed of the Lord for such an hour as this to know that the son is revealing the father that the bridegroom is revealing to the bride the very nature of the Creator the glory of knowing that we are the the reproduced Christ in the earth I tell you that's a powerful thing to know that God has reproduced himself in the life of his sons powerful somebody said that may be too big of a description is it if the very life of God is in you if the very Spirit and the fullness of who Jesus Christ is and was has been now emptied into the bride is it really so much to say that he has reproduced himself in a multi membered body in a many-membered bride I don't think it's so very much at all I think it's a logical understanding we know that Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that demands that demands that the bride be the mystery of Christ revealed if it was the responsibility of the son to reveal the father it is now the wife's responsibility to reveal the bridegroom [Music]
