[0:00] praise is a powerful weapon if you
[0:03] always want to win in your life you have
[0:08] to cultivate an attitude of gratitude if
[0:13] you always want to win in every battle
[0:16] of your life you have to cultivate an
[0:20] attitude of praise and of worship True
[0:24] Praise releases
[0:26] power and true power inspires more
[0:30] sincere praise do you understand yes sir
[0:34] if you want Power with God we need
[0:38] Authority it's ours but if you want to
[0:41] see Power on
[0:43] display praise him not just with your
[0:46] song with your
[0:48] life not with just with your mouth with
[0:51] your life you can't change the fact that
[0:53] he's sitting on the throne Eternal you
[0:56] can't change the fact that he's still
[0:58] king of kings and Lord of Lords but when
[1:01] you're not giving him a place to sit
[1:04] when you're not building him a house to
[1:06] live in when you're not making him a
[1:08] habitation to dwell in you're taking him
[1:11] off his throne in your life your
[1:14] attitude while you wait on God your
[1:18] attitude while you wait on God to bring
[1:21] his word to pass is vitally
[1:24] important for the measure of your
[1:27] promise for the measure of your Harvest
[1:31] that's right brother if you wait and
[1:35] Grumble if you wait and
[1:37] murmur if you wait and make excuses for
[1:40] your
[1:41] life one day I'm going to serve him with
[1:43] everything I've got you don't get to
[1:45] choose that now is the time now is the
[1:50] acceptable hour to have a relationship
[1:53] with him I'm in a personal relationship
[1:56] with him where your desire is to
[1:59] overcome and make it and your desire for
[2:02] those around you is that they also
[2:03] overcome and make
[2:05] it I know what my praise has cost me
[2:09] hello I don't know what yours has cost
[2:12] you but I know the price of mine and
[2:14] it's valuable to
[2:16] me because the battle was
[2:19] hard come on the suffering was hard the
[2:22] trial was hard so the praise ought to
[2:25] match the intensity of the
[2:28] fire
[2:30] hallelujah
[2:33] hallelujah my praise ought to match the
[2:37] intensity of my
[2:40] trial you don't really believe that
[2:42] everybody ought to praise the Lord like
[2:43] that do you I didn't write this
[2:46] book let the high let the high praises
[2:49] of God be in their mouth and a two-edged
[2:52] sword in their hand remember we're not
[2:53] preaching on
[2:56] worship I'm preaching on praise and I
[2:59] don't care what the charismatics say
[3:01] until they learn the beauty of Praise
[3:04] they may call it worship all day long
[3:07] but that don't make it
[3:11] worship you've got to learn you've got
[3:13] to learn the tool you've got to learn
[3:14] the tool of Praise you've got to learn
[3:16] the effectiveness of High Praise it's
[3:19] got to become a revelation to you and
[3:21] you've got to get in that place so that
[3:23] the glory
[3:25] comes that's what breaks open the
[3:28] atmosphere
[3:32] but you don't want to live there you
[3:35] want to come on in praise breaks open
[3:37] the heaven worship lets the heaven come
[3:41] down it works
[3:48] together
