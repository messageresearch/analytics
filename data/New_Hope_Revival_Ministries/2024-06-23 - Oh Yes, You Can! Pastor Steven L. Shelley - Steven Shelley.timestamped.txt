[46:21] the truth remains he's coming he's
[46:24] coming if I'm not alive and and well at
[46:27] that time don't worry because the
[46:30] resurrection will catch me up I'm
[46:32] counting on that but I wouldn't be
[46:35] surprised if many of us who are in this
[46:37] room right now are not alive when their
[46:40] little bride is taken out of here and
[46:42] changed it's a reality it's not a fable
[46:45] it's not a myth it's a reality and only
[46:47] the righteous are going and none of us
[46:50] are righteous without him you can't live
[46:53] righteous enough amen you may be seated
[46:56] for just a moment moment again we're
[46:57] going to have you stand for the word to
[46:59] be read in a moment but it is wonderful
[47:02] to have you we we are certainly miss
[47:05] those that are not here today but we
[47:08] understand I want you to know that I'm
[47:10] not here today out of obligation or
[47:13] because I didn't get invited to be
[47:14] somewhere else I'm here today because I
[47:17] wanted to be here and I trust that's why
[47:20] you're here there's nowhere I'd rather
[47:22] be today than right here with you in the
[47:25] presence of the Lord
[47:27] and we have found out that we we just
[47:30] can't possibly attend every wedding that
[47:32] we're invited to if they're going to
[47:34] have them on the weekend and what better
[47:35] time to have them than the weekend and
[47:38] brother gy even they were invited we
[47:41] were invited he even said to me in my
[47:43] office uh I you go you go this time but
[47:47] I just didn't think that that's where I
[47:49] was supposed to be and it is so
[47:51] important in the last days to be where
[47:54] God would have you that's all that
[47:56] matters
[47:57] uh I agree with brother gley it's good
[47:59] to see Dawn uh in church today very good
[48:02] to see her and uh it's hard for me to
[48:05] imagine that she has a son now that
[48:07] little son that ran around here when he
[48:10] was younger now married it's hard to
[48:13] believe it really is but we're we're
[48:16] happy that he's happy and I know it's
[48:18] hard on Mom it's hard it's happy but
[48:21] it's hard I remember how my mom was but
[48:25] oh we're just thankful that God is
[48:27] taking care of us all and with his great
[48:30] tender care we're never alone when we
[48:33] have him his grace is sufficient for
[48:35] every trial that we face I think we've
[48:38] had plenty of singing um but I I will
[48:42] sing
[48:43] anyway
[48:44] um I'll sing uh Ben said maybe power in
[48:48] prayer so let's do that and uh I don't
[48:52] think we have to have another song but
[48:55] anyway we we don't have Cade to fall
[48:57] back on today he's busy uh they were
[49:01] having a wonderful service last night in
[49:03] North Carolina I didn't get to see but a
[49:05] tiny clip uh uh the the camera was not
[49:09] on the prayer line uh the deacons they
[49:12] said didn't think that the camera maybe
[49:14] should be on the prayer line when people
[49:16] came through and I understand that some
[49:19] people are a little bit uh you know shy
[49:22] about things like that but it sure is
[49:24] hard to be on the other end of something
[49:26] and not be able to see what the Lord is
[49:28] doing but we could see them when they
[49:30] came out of the prayer line and it was
[49:32] so wonderful to see Joseph I guess we're
[49:35] going to have to cut down on our JoJo
[49:39] calling him JoJo he's he's getting big
[49:41] now grown now and it was so wonderful to
[49:44] see Joseph come through the prayer line
[49:47] uh with tears on his running down his
[49:50] face and his eyes all red and his face
[49:52] all red touched by the Lord and that
[49:55] would make the trip there worth it and
[49:58] we're just thankful that he was touched
[50:00] and they certainly welcom Kate into back
[50:03] to his church where he was and and uh he
[50:06] was ministering there and and led the
[50:08] choir and so forth and we're thankful
[50:11] that God can use he'll use you wherever
[50:13] you are he'll use you if you if you go
[50:16] ready for him you believe there's power
[50:18] in prayer I

[53:21] amen thank God for the musicians
[53:27] wonderful wonderful to have sister
[53:29] Laurel back on the piano today we missed
[53:33] her and David back on the guitar again
[53:36] we're just blessed and thankful um we
[53:40] always miss those that aren't able to be
[53:42] with us let's all stand again for a
[53:44] moment we miss those who can't be here
[53:46] we sure do appreciate having them come
[53:51] back we're thankful for sister marbeth
[53:54] who did an amazing job
[53:57] and uh she has been out of the rotation
[53:59] for some time but we are so thankful to
[54:02] report that she is back in the rotation
[54:05] and won't just have to fill in but she
[54:08] will uh have her Sunday and Tuesday
[54:10] night too I want to give God praise when
[54:13] when uh it's Tove let me tell you why I
[54:15] want to praise the Lord for that it's
[54:17] Tove when we see someone this is what
[54:19] Tove means in Hebrew when we see someone
[54:22] bringing forth the seed of their Destiny
[54:25] God said that is Tove it's good it's
[54:28] Tove May it's very good he he also tells
[54:33] us in Hebrew that when we are not
[54:35] bringing forth the seed of our destiny
[54:38] what we were created to do that it's raw
[54:42] and somebody said well that must mean
[54:44] bad no it doesn't it actually means evil
[54:47] so God looks at it as evil when we are
[54:50] not bringing forth the seed of our
[54:52] destiny so when someone faces everything
[54:56] that they're going through in their life
[54:58] and they're willing to let God use them
[55:00] anyhow that's that's very Tove and we're
[55:04] so thankful for sister Mar Beth the gift
[55:06] that's in her life we're thankful that
[55:08] she has pressed through everything we're
[55:11] pressing you know there's an ining on

[55:38] him and and we miss him we've got a lot
[55:41] of talent here if they'll just step up
[55:43] and volunteer amen amen so this morning
[55:46] I want you to turn to the book of
[55:49] numbers and there's so much we could say

[56:35] Chapter 3 uh I'm missing some of my
[56:38] loudest amens this morning so I'm asking
[56:41] you to make up for them either with your
[56:43] amen or at least with your faith
[56:46] pool brother Robert's not here today and
[56:49] he has a good Hardy amen Austin Hodes is

[56:55] amens he gets in trouble sometime he's

[57:01] you but sometimes preachers need a
[57:03] little verbal help and that Dad don't
[57:06] that distract you most of the time it
[57:08] really helps me my granny used to say
[57:11] that when you say am man to a Holiness
[57:13] preacher it's like saying sium to a
[57:16] dog it just causes them to want to keep
[57:18] running so maybe that's why you don't
[57:20] amen cuz I'm so long- winded maybe
[57:22] that's what it is Numbers Chapter 13
[57:25] Verse 1 through3 and the Lord spake unto
[57:29] Moses
[57:30] saying send thou men that they may
[57:33] search the land of Canaan which or Canan
[57:37] in Hebrew which I give unto the children
[57:40] of Israel of every tribe of their
[57:43] fathers shall ye send a man everyone a
[57:47] ruler among them and Moses by the
[57:52] Commandment of the Lord sent them from
[57:55] the will Wilderness of pan all those men
[57:59] were heads of the children of Israel
[58:02] let's catch up and make sure you follow
[58:05] there were 12 tribes there were Chiefs
[58:07] among all the 12 tribes there were
[58:10] leaders and among the leaders of all 12
[58:13] tribes one man was elected nominated
[58:16] somehow to represent that entire tribe
[58:20] going over to Canaan land and spying out
[58:24] what was on the other side of the Jordan
[58:26] River do you understand and let's do one
[58:29] more and then you can be seated Numbers
[58:32] Chapter 13 same chapter verses
[58:35] 7-2 and Moses sent them to spy out the
[58:40] land of Canaan I I'm uh uh I I'm I'm in
[58:45] verse 17 I'm very very sorry you may not
[58:48] have pulled it up I see that I'm missing
[58:49] a one I'm in numbers 131 17- 20 my my
[58:55] bad honey I'm s sorry and Moses sent
[58:57] them to spy out the land of Canaan and
[59:01] said unto them get you up this way
[59:04] Southward and go up into the mountain
[59:07] Verse 18 and see the land what it is and
[59:10] the people that dwelleth therein whether
[59:13] they be strong or weak few or many you
[59:17] see the children of Israel had no idea
[59:20] what was on the other side all they knew
[59:22] is God said I'm giving you that land
[59:24] they didn't know if they were going to
[59:26] find many inhabitants or few inhabitants
[59:29] they didn't know what was waiting on
[59:30] them and what the land is and they that
[59:33] dwell in whether it be good or bad and
[59:36] what cities they be that they dwell in
[59:39] whether in tents or in strongholds and
[59:42] what the land is whether it be fat or
[59:45] lean whether there be wood therein or
[59:48] not and be ye of good courage and bring
[59:51] of the fruit of the land now the time
[59:56] was the time of first ripe grapes that's
[1:00:01] the early grapes father would you come
[1:00:04] now Lord as we study your word together
[1:00:07] this morning would you anoint our ears
[1:00:10] to hear it would you anoint your servant
[1:00:13] to teach it would you Lord let it spring
[1:00:16] up and root in our inner being that we
[1:00:20] can understand that these things are our
[1:00:23] examples that we also have a promised
[1:00:26] land to conquer we also have a promised
[1:00:29] inheritance and we must be faithful even
[1:00:33] as Moses was faithful and Joshua and
[1:00:36] Caleb we must follow their example and
[1:00:39] possess all that you have promised us
[1:00:42] strengthen us today keep us Alert in
[1:00:45] this hour and may the faithful of the
[1:00:47] people cause the word to Spring forth
[1:00:50] Among Us in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:52] Christ we pray and the Saints said amen
[1:00:56] you may be seated so we are reading a
[1:00:59] familiar portion of scripture and I'm
[1:01:02] going to read a few more verses I know
[1:01:04] it gets a little mundane when there's so
[1:01:06] much reading but I want you to be
[1:01:09] reminded of the details and instead of
[1:01:12] just uh marking them off like little
[1:01:15] PowerPoints or something uh I want to
[1:01:18] read it to you right out of the word
[1:01:20] there's one thing we can't do too much
[1:01:23] and that is read God's word and pray you
[1:01:25] you believe that that that's what we're
[1:01:27] told and I believe it's nothing but the
[1:01:29] truth numbers 13 and verse 23 and now
[1:01:34] they have crossed they have gone over
[1:01:36] and they have come to the brook of
[1:01:39] eshkol and uh that word eshcol means the
[1:01:43] clustering of the grapes it means where
[1:01:46] the grapes are clustered so the Bible
[1:01:49] goes on to tell us and they came unto
[1:01:51] the brook of eshcol and cut down from
[1:01:55] then a Branch with one cluster of grapes
[1:02:00] and they bear it between two upon a
[1:02:04] staff and they brought of the
[1:02:07] pomegranates and of the figs now I don't
[1:02:11] know about you I've seen some pretty big
[1:02:13] bunches of grapes we were uh helping
[1:02:16] along with Nathan there Harvest some
[1:02:18] grapes in Israel and there were
[1:02:21] beautiful clusters of of grapes that are
[1:02:24] made for wine they're extra juicy and
[1:02:26] they're about that tall can you imagine
[1:02:29] a cluster of grapes so large that it
[1:02:32] would take two men to carry it I'm
[1:02:35] telling you that is a you know that's a
[1:02:37] five four five foot long cluster of
[1:02:41] grapes and uh the children of Israel had
[1:02:44] never seen that in Egypt and that's for
[1:02:46] sure they'd never seen it on the other
[1:02:48] side of the Jordan on the other side of
[1:02:51] the Wilderness and so this was something
[1:02:53] like heaven to them I mean my
[1:02:56] uh like this you can feed a you can feed
[1:02:59] a neighborhood on grapes like that I
[1:03:01] just can't imagine a knife and a fork to
[1:03:03] eat a grape but it being so big I mean
[1:03:07] you know the grape must be extra large
[1:03:09] we weren't there we don't know we just
[1:03:11] know it was so big it took two men to
[1:03:13] carry it so there might have just been
[1:03:15] millions of little ones I don't know but
[1:03:17] it was a lot and they cut it down they
[1:03:20] bear it across and they also took
[1:03:23] pomegranates and figs in the land which
[1:03:26] were Staples and very necessary uh for
[1:03:29] the life of the children of Israel the
[1:03:32] place was called The Brook eshal because
[1:03:34] of the cluster of grapes which the
[1:03:36] children of Israel cut down from then
[1:03:39] and they returned from searching the
[1:03:41] land 40 days you know that's quite an
[1:03:45] Excursion that's quite an adventure 40
[1:03:48] days of roaming the land of promise
[1:03:51] taking it all in so that you can come
[1:03:54] back and give a thorough report
[1:03:56] you know it was very very important
[1:03:58] there are 2 million plus it could been
[1:04:01] could have been anywhere by this time it
[1:04:03] could have been closer to 6 million
[1:04:05] people we don't know but millions of
[1:04:08] people are waiting for a report of what
[1:04:12] is going to be on the other side of the
[1:04:14] river so their report was of utmost
[1:04:17] importance you might call it classified
[1:04:20] information you might say that it was
[1:04:22] quite a mission and they were to bring
[1:04:25] back a report with great detail and let
[1:04:28] them know are we just going to go in and
[1:04:31] and say scram and the enem is going to
[1:04:33] run from us or we going to have to go in
[1:04:35] and take lives or we you know how are we
[1:04:38] going to are we going to have to go to
[1:04:39] real war or are they just going to lay
[1:04:42] down and and serve us and so this report
[1:04:46] was of utmost importance it took 40 days
[1:04:49] to bring back a decent report and when
[1:04:52] they got back from the land of promise
[1:04:54] the land of Canaan they went and came to
[1:04:57] Moses and to Aaron his brother and to
[1:05:00] all the congregation of the children of
[1:05:02] Israel under the Wilderness of par Pon
[1:05:05] to cadesh and brought back word unto
[1:05:09] them and unto all the congregation and
[1:05:12] showed them the fruit of the land there
[1:05:16] must have been some oo and Oz can you
[1:05:18] imagine o you know to see grapes like
[1:05:22] that and we don't know how how Lush the
[1:05:25] pomegranates were how plentiful the figs
[1:05:28] were but we've got this we've got this
[1:05:30] image of the grapes in our mind and this
[1:05:32] was like school did did anybody have
[1:05:35] show and tail in school well we were
[1:05:37] bringing our little projects and showing
[1:05:39] them off these spies were giving quite a
[1:05:43] presentation concerning the the fruit of
[1:05:46] the land and and they go on it goes on
[1:05:49] uh uh to the next verse and they told
[1:05:51] him and said we came unto the land
[1:05:53] whether thou sest us and surely it
[1:05:57] floweth with milk and honey so there's
[1:06:00] plenty of milk and there's plenty of
[1:06:02] honey and this is the fruit of it and so
[1:06:06] they're taking it all in nevertheless
[1:06:09] the people that nevertheless is where we
[1:06:12] can get into some problem you know
[1:06:15] exaggeration is is
[1:06:19] dangerous it's dangerous to
[1:06:22] exaggerate it it it might not always be
[1:06:24] a lie but it is certainly another
[1:06:27] version of the truth a less accurate
[1:06:31] version of the truth so they said
[1:06:33] nevertheless the people be strong that
[1:06:35] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:06:38] walled and very great and more over we
[1:06:42] saw the children of anoch there these
[1:06:46] were famous children the amalekites
[1:06:48] dwell in the land of the South the
[1:06:50] Hittites and jebusites and amorites
[1:06:53] dwell in the mountains of Canaan and
[1:06:55] then the Canaanites dwell by the Sea by
[1:06:58] the coast of Jordan so now look here
[1:07:00] you've got amalekites Hittites jebusites
[1:07:04] amorites Canaanites five different
[1:07:08] tribes living in the land that God said
[1:07:12] I'm giving that land to you five enemies
[1:07:15] so to speak and so we go
[1:07:18] on and Caleb stealed the people before
[1:07:23] Moses and said let let us go up at
[1:07:28] once and possess it for we are well able
[1:07:35] to do what overcome to overcome it
[1:07:38] notice we often say take it when we sing
[1:07:42] the song let us go up at once to take
[1:07:45] the country but notice Caleb didn't say
[1:07:49] we are well able to take it he said we
[1:07:52] are well able to overcome it brother
[1:07:55] brandom said in order to overcome you
[1:07:58] got to face something that you got to
[1:08:01] get over and so you can't be an
[1:08:03] overcomer if you don't face
[1:08:06] opposition you can't be an overcomer if
[1:08:08] you don't fight the faithful battle you
[1:08:11] you can't get over something that's not
[1:08:13] in your way and so there they Caleb said
[1:08:17] yeah well you see the grapes and you've
[1:08:20] heard about the the Giants but but we
[1:08:22] want you to know we can go up at one
[1:08:25] want and possess it for we we possess we
[1:08:30] carry what we need to overcome it
[1:08:34] therefore anything that's in it any
[1:08:38] enemy that lives in your promise any
[1:08:41] enemy that lives in the land of your
[1:08:44] inheritance if God said I'm giving you
[1:08:47] that land he's also going to give you
[1:08:50] the power to overcome whatever stands
[1:08:53] between you and possessing your
[1:08:57] inheritance he'll not tell you to do
[1:09:00] something and not give you the authority
[1:09:02] and power to accomplish it and so it
[1:09:05] eliminates our
[1:09:08] excuses when we like to think we're the
[1:09:11] only one facing the kind of battle that
[1:09:13] we're facing we find out there's no
[1:09:16] temptation but such as common to man
[1:09:18] that's right if you've been tempted with
[1:09:20] a situation if you've been facing a
[1:09:23] trial somebody somewhere has faced a
[1:09:26] very similar situation to the one you're
[1:09:29] going through right now and the same God
[1:09:32] who brought them through if they were
[1:09:35] depending on him is the one who will
[1:09:37] bring you through you can't expect the
[1:09:41] possess the possession or The
[1:09:44] Inheritance without a battle the prophet
[1:09:47] tells us this isn't a picnic we we're
[1:09:50] not here in the last days going to a
[1:09:52] picnic we're in a battle and we're on a
[1:09:54] ble we're not on a playground we're on a
[1:09:57] battlefield and anything worth having is
[1:10:00] worth fighting to get come on all you've
[1:10:03] got to do is just read the book of
[1:10:05] promise we are to be a people of the
[1:10:08] book and that means that what's promised
[1:10:11] to us is supposed to be what we have in
[1:10:13] front of us as our vision as our goal if
[1:10:17] God said I'm going to give you
[1:10:18] overcoming power you're going to defeat
[1:10:21] every devil in your life you're going to
[1:10:23] overcome every habit every addiction
[1:10:25] every situation if God said that it's
[1:10:28] because he knows that he's given us not
[1:10:32] he's going to give us he's given us what
[1:10:35] we
[1:10:36] need not only take it but to overcome it
[1:10:40] to get on top of it to get to the other
[1:10:43] side overcome is not just getting higher
[1:10:45] than your problem overcoming is to get
[1:10:48] clear over to the other side of your
[1:10:50] problem so that you've got the authority
[1:10:52] then to deal with the problem sometimes
[1:10:54] you speak to a mountain from this
[1:10:58] side sometime you got to get over to the
[1:11:00] other side before you can talk to it
[1:11:03] because there's a promise sometimes that
[1:11:05] goes with a territory and our territory
[1:11:09] is not on this side of Jordan our
[1:11:11] promised inheritance is on the other
[1:11:13] side that's why the word tells us that
[1:11:15] we basically I'm going to paraphrase we
[1:11:17] have to poke our heads up above what we
[1:11:20] see with our five
[1:11:23] senses and we have to take the promise
[1:11:26] instead of the condition that we see
[1:11:29] remember we're not
[1:11:31] thermometers we're
[1:11:33] thermostats amen so if you are
[1:11:35] attracting problems and situation it's
[1:11:38] probably because you're destined to
[1:11:40] overcome that kind of
[1:11:42] thing so get ready because there're
[1:11:45] seeds of Destiny this isn't you know the
[1:11:48] power of positive thinking I'm talking
[1:11:50] about I'm talking about a seed of
[1:11:52] destiny that was swn into your life
[1:11:54] before before you got here because the
[1:11:57] Bible said before we ever came he knew
[1:12:00] us did you know he knew your name before
[1:12:02] you were ever born and if he knew your
[1:12:05] name he knew who your parents were going
[1:12:06] to be he knew that one of them might be
[1:12:09] a
[1:12:11] loser both of them might be
[1:12:13] losers I told you uh last week and it's
[1:12:17] true again this week that for for I
[1:12:19] don't play games very often I you know
[1:12:22] though I just don't I don't think I'm
[1:12:23] not saying that's I'm more spiritual
[1:12:25] than somebody else but I like to find
[1:12:27] something that kind of occupies my mind
[1:12:30] so lately for about a month I've been
[1:12:32] working on my really trying to work on
[1:12:35] my family tree I've been doing it for
[1:12:37] several years but I'm really trying to
[1:12:39] do it now with a little more intention
[1:12:42] and that means going back and correcting
[1:12:44] a lot of the mistakes that I made when I
[1:12:46] was in a hurry and uh that's no fun it's
[1:12:50] fun if you're discovering new new family
[1:12:52] members but it's not fun when you've had
[1:12:55] family members married four and five
[1:12:59] times I'm not going to tell you how many
[1:13:01] in my family had so many I will tell you
[1:13:04] that it was a different generation than
[1:13:06] the one we're in now and a lot of times
[1:13:08] it was because a spouse died but there
[1:13:10] were quite a few divorces along the way
[1:13:13] and trying to figure out whose kids
[1:13:15] belong to who when you're doing family
[1:13:17] tree because sometimes in an obituary it
[1:13:20] will say uh they're survived in the name
[1:13:23] of all the children and I know know that
[1:13:25] it be rude to to break it down but I
[1:13:28] wish they would for for people who want
[1:13:31] to do their family tree it'd be so nice
[1:13:33] if they'd say you know Survive by three
[1:13:35] daughters and two stepdaughters and a
[1:13:38] and a stepson you know something like
[1:13:40] that that would help us I know it's not
[1:13:42] supposed to matter but it it kind of
[1:13:44] matters like that when you start finding
[1:13:47] out that you've got everything from from
[1:13:49] revolutionary war heroes to to horse
[1:13:53] thieves
[1:13:56] I mean
[1:13:58] literally I mean I've got articles to
[1:14:00] prove that I've got family that was
[1:14:02] arrested for stealing somebody else's
[1:14:04] horse that's terrible get your own horse
[1:14:07] you know but but anyway I'm thankful I
[1:14:10] don't have to do any of that or be any
[1:14:12] of that uh but God knew he knew he knew
[1:14:15] you he knew your strengths before you
[1:14:18] were born he knew your weaknesses before
[1:14:20] you were born and he knew whether you'd
[1:14:22] have a good family life growing up or
[1:14:25] whether you wouldn't he knew all that
[1:14:27] and he placed within you in that
[1:14:30] moment if you're his predestinated child
[1:14:34] we believe what the word said he placed
[1:14:36] within you in that moment seed of
[1:14:39] destiny that would help you to overcome
[1:14:43] when you get to each situation and trial
[1:14:45] of your life because there's one thing
[1:14:47] God's not going to let you do he's not
[1:14:49] going to let you lose in the end of this
[1:14:52] you see he tells us in his word he knew
[1:14:54] from from the beginning who would choose
[1:14:56] him and who would not choose him and so
[1:15:00] I'm glad he knew my choice he knew every
[1:15:03] good thing about my growing up he knew
[1:15:05] every negative thing about my growing up
[1:15:07] and he placed within me seeds of destiny
[1:15:12] that he can use and bring forth in the
[1:15:14] right time in the right place for the
[1:15:17] right purpose and Caleb is one of those
[1:15:19] men Joshua one of those men that God was
[1:15:23] going to use in in a in a moment of a of
[1:15:27] a of a situation that could affect the
[1:15:30] whole nation there has to be somebody
[1:15:33] who God can use to calm the
[1:15:39] people Caleb stealed the people you
[1:15:42] still with me before Moses and said let
[1:15:45] us go up at once and possess it for we
[1:15:48] are well able to overcome it let's read
[1:15:51] on for just a
[1:15:52] moment but the men that went up with him
[1:15:55] the other spies they said we be not able
[1:16:01] to go up against the people for they are
[1:16:04] stronger than we now how do you
[1:16:08] know did you see them practicing war
[1:16:11] games did you did you visit their
[1:16:16] arsenals do you have reason to believe
[1:16:18] that they possess nuclear
[1:16:21] power why is it that you are so
[1:16:24] convinced vinced that we're not going to
[1:16:27] be able to go up against this people
[1:16:29] because they're stronger than we let's
[1:16:32] go
[1:16:33] on and they brought
[1:16:36] up not a negative
[1:16:39] report some of the other translations
[1:16:42] will say a negative
[1:16:44] report King James actually captures the
[1:16:47] expression of this better than any of
[1:16:49] the others by saying it's really an evil
[1:16:53] report now the word raah is not used in
[1:16:56] the original text there but it helps us
[1:16:59] to get an idea of what an evil report is
[1:17:02] an evil report is something that keeps
[1:17:06] us from expressing from manifesting the
[1:17:10] seed of destiny that God has placed
[1:17:12] within us it's a lie amen the truth is
[1:17:16] not going to keep you from being what
[1:17:18] God called you to be the only thing
[1:17:20] that's going to keep you from being what
[1:17:22] God called you to be is a lie so that's
[1:17:24] an evil report
[1:17:25] and there's going to be Hittites and
[1:17:27] there's going to be jebusites and
[1:17:29] there's going to be Canaanites and
[1:17:30] there's going come on that you will face
[1:17:33] in your life that will try to tell you
[1:17:35] why you
[1:17:37] can't why you can't overcome I'm going
[1:17:41] to wait on your help there will be
[1:17:44] plenty of enemies out there to tell you
[1:17:47] why you can't
[1:17:50] succeed uh and just because you flunk
[1:17:53] kindergarten and had to repeat it
[1:17:55] doesn't mean you can't have a decent
[1:17:58] job just because you were in special
[1:18:01] classes when you were growing up doesn't
[1:18:03] mean that you're going to be the a
[1:18:04] fortune five
[1:18:08] CEO 500 Fortune 500 uh you you you you
[1:18:12] can't base your present situation on
[1:18:16] your past God is the only one who can
[1:18:19] look at your past because he already
[1:18:21] knew it before you came and sort out
[1:18:24] each step that brought you to where you
[1:18:26] are you know sometime we we try to
[1:18:28] connect the dots of our life and had I
[1:18:31] not met that person I would have never
[1:18:32] known that and had I not come and had I
[1:18:35] and and look how God it's wonderful to
[1:18:37] do that if we can come out of the other
[1:18:39] side giving God praise but if we're
[1:18:41] going to come back with a negative
[1:18:43] report or an evil report when we see all
[1:18:45] that then then we just need to leave
[1:18:47] that alone they brought up an evil
[1:18:50] report of the land which they had
[1:18:52] searched unto the children of Israel
[1:18:53] saying the land through which we have
[1:18:56] gone to search it is a land that eateth
[1:19:01] up this sounds like
[1:19:04] Hollywood the land eats
[1:19:11] up the
[1:19:13] inhabitants
[1:19:14] thereof so it makes you wonder do we
[1:19:17] need to conquer the inhabitants or do we
[1:19:20] need to conquer the land itself because
[1:19:23] the land some somehow is eating the
[1:19:27] people I just don't believe that's what
[1:19:30] they saw I believe that's their
[1:19:32] interpretation of what they saw do you
[1:19:33] you want me to help you here just a
[1:19:35] minute they saw some Giants one
[1:19:38] family one
[1:19:40] family millions of people over there in
[1:19:43] the promised land they saw one family of
[1:19:46] Giants and from that one family of
[1:19:49] giants they decided that that that they
[1:19:54] got that fall in that fat and that
[1:19:56] ugly by eating their own
[1:19:59] people they didn't see anybody chewing
[1:20:01] on a
[1:20:02] leg this is not something they really
[1:20:05] saw this is their interpretation there
[1:20:08] are there are there there must be a
[1:20:10] reason for this genetic anomaly of these
[1:20:14] Giants it must be because they eat one
[1:20:17] another you know and so the land when
[1:20:19] they're giving this in an uh in a kind
[1:20:22] of the analogy of it they're saying the
[1:20:24] land swallows up eats up the inhabitants
[1:20:28] thereof and all the people that we saw
[1:20:30] in it this is a lie this is a lie all
[1:20:34] the people that we saw in it are men of
[1:20:36] great stature you'll never convince me
[1:20:39] there weren't some shorties among
[1:20:42] them and maybe not in the family of
[1:20:45] anoch but that was only one family of
[1:20:48] giants you can't tell me that every
[1:20:50] jebusite and every perizzite and hittite
[1:20:53] and whatever were were Giant GI no one
[1:20:55] family of giants but when they're coming
[1:20:58] back you know they got so excited and
[1:21:00] they're exaggerating and the land
[1:21:02] swallows up the people and and everybody
[1:21:04] we every man in the land is a is a giant
[1:21:09] this is a terrible exaggeration it's a
[1:21:11] lie it's an evil report let's read on
[1:21:14] for just a moment it's a lot of reading
[1:21:16] I know and here there we saw the Giants
[1:21:19] the son of an anoch which come of the
[1:21:23] Giants and we were in our own
[1:21:27] sight as
[1:21:29] Grasshoppers and so we
[1:21:32] were in their sight now we should turn
[1:21:36] that
[1:21:37] around and we should say we were in
[1:21:41] their sight as
[1:21:43] grasshoppers because this was an
[1:21:45] assumption it was a
[1:21:47] presumption we were in their sight as
[1:21:50] grasshoppers so we were in our sight as
[1:21:55] grasshoppers they
[1:21:57] imagined that the Giants were seeing
[1:22:00] them like grasshoppers so they began to
[1:22:04] see
[1:22:06] themselves that's what it says they
[1:22:08] began to see themselves as Grasshoppers
[1:22:11] and now not one family of giants but a
[1:22:14] whole land is full of giants you see
[1:22:17] what happens when you agree with an evil
[1:22:20] report over your life do you see what
[1:22:23] happens it changes es your perception of
[1:22:25] who you
[1:22:26] are and it changes everything you see
[1:22:30] and you start assuming what other people
[1:22:32] see in you or know about you or think
[1:22:35] about you I need some
[1:22:37] help so because we feel like they're all
[1:22:40] they're all Giants they must look at us
[1:22:43] like grasshoppers so we we we see
[1:22:46] ourselves as grasshoppers in their side
[1:22:49] and they begin to bring that back I'm so
[1:22:51] glad that among the 12 there were two
[1:22:54] that didn't see with carnal eyes that
[1:22:57] didn't believe the lies that didn't
[1:23:00] exaggerate the reality of what was there
[1:23:03] I'm glad there were two who came back
[1:23:05] with their eyes on the promise and they
[1:23:08] said if God said it that settles it I
[1:23:12] don't care if every man among the
[1:23:14] millions is a giant I refuse to see
[1:23:18] myself like a grasshopper and frankly I
[1:23:21] don't care how they see me
[1:23:25] I don't care if they see me as a
[1:23:27] grasshopper or a rhinoceros it doesn't
[1:23:29] matter because I'm going to see myself
[1:23:33] on the promise and not on the evil
[1:23:36] report isn't that
[1:23:38] right all the people we saw men of great
[1:23:43] stature uh we are in our own sight as
[1:23:46] Grasshoppers and so we were in their
[1:23:49] sight now if you look at that uh word in
[1:23:53] Hebrew evil report one of the meanings
[1:23:58] of that is again it gives us the idea of
[1:24:01] raw because the evil word has been
[1:24:04] placed there but that word is actually
[1:24:07] does not appear in the original Hebrew
[1:24:09] text that's for
[1:24:10] clarification but the the expression of
[1:24:13] this report there are several words that
[1:24:16] can be used for report in the Bible uh
[1:24:20] it can be it can also be translated a
[1:24:23] rumor
[1:24:25] same word is used in English from the
[1:24:27] Hebrew report or rumor but this
[1:24:30] particular
[1:24:32] expression uh it seems to mean in its
[1:24:35] root form to be
[1:24:38] sluggish to move
[1:24:40] slowly that's the problem that's the
[1:24:43] problem they they were
[1:24:46] drunk by their own
[1:24:49] negativity they were so negative they're
[1:24:52] captains leaders can you imagine how the
[1:24:55] rest of the tribe was if the greatest
[1:24:58] among them were sluggish and slow and
[1:25:01] lazy and who see everything from the
[1:25:04] from the uh half
[1:25:07] empty instead of the half full can can
[1:25:11] you can you imagine if you're working
[1:25:12] with people like that how easy it is to
[1:25:15] take on that kind of a spirit can you
[1:25:17] imagine if you've got leaders in the
[1:25:19] church that are like that how easy it is
[1:25:21] to take on that half empty thing you
[1:25:24] know you know we we don't never have
[1:25:26] enough we can't you know we we're Bound
[1:25:28] by this and bound by that and hindered
[1:25:30] by this and hindered by that uh I want
[1:25:33] you to know that this evil report to to
[1:25:36] move slowly to be
[1:25:39] sluggish if you look at this as First
[1:25:42] Corinthians tells us to in chapter 10 it
[1:25:45] says in the New Testament it says and
[1:25:48] all these things happen as in samples
[1:25:54] are
[1:25:55] examples to us it it's inspired the
[1:26:00] Bible tells us the whole book is
[1:26:02] inspired you can't understand the new
[1:26:05] without an understanding of the old what
[1:26:07] we see God doing and type and Shadow we
[1:26:11] see God doing an antitype and
[1:26:13] fulfillment in the New Testament and and
[1:26:16] so we've got so much to be thankful for
[1:26:18] because one thing we have had as a body
[1:26:20] of Believers is a foundation in the Old
[1:26:23] Testament yes and you need it to be able
[1:26:26] to embrace the
[1:26:28] grace and the promise of the New
[1:26:31] Testament are you still with me I'm
[1:26:33] going to try to move fast but you've got
[1:26:36] to get the foundation laid and so if
[1:26:39] there is a Old Testament ample or
[1:26:44] example there must be a new testament
[1:26:47] thought or concept or reality that we
[1:26:51] can connect the old Testament type in
[1:26:56] Sample example two did that make any
[1:26:59] sense we got to find something in the
[1:27:01] New Testament that we can directly draw
[1:27:07] connect to whatever this is supposed to
[1:27:10] be representing in the Old Testament now
[1:27:12] don't miss me the Old Testament is not a
[1:27:15] fable we are Bible Believers here and we
[1:27:18] believe if it said it happened it
[1:27:21] happened you don't really believe it
[1:27:23] flooded yes I do you don't really
[1:27:26] believe what one man got in the boat
[1:27:28] with his family and brought all yes I do
[1:27:30] I really believe that if the Bible said
[1:27:32] it I believe it you don't really believe
[1:27:34] that the Earth was recreated in just one
[1:27:37] week yes I do I believe it just like
[1:27:39] that somebody said you don't believe
[1:27:41] that the Earth that we live in now is
[1:27:43] billions of years old not as we know it
[1:27:45] now no we believe there was a pre-adamic
[1:27:49] creation and that creation was lost
[1:27:51] because of Lucifer's Ascension because
[1:27:54] of his rebellion and that Earth was
[1:27:57] plunged in a great Deluge many years
[1:28:00] before the flood the seeds of that of
[1:28:03] that land the seeds of that Civilization
[1:28:06] or that uh creation whatever it was lay
[1:28:10] beneath the waters in Genesis 1 and the
[1:28:13] spirit of God moved brooded upon the
[1:28:16] face of the deep the seed of AE brother
[1:28:19] random tells us the seed of a previous
[1:28:21] civilization lay beneath that water and
[1:28:24] in God's time he took the Earth off of
[1:28:26] the back burner so to speak and he said
[1:28:28] I'm going to
[1:28:30] recreate and in six days he
[1:28:35] recreated is't that amazing in the
[1:28:37] beginning he created something from
[1:28:39] nothing in the recreation he took the
[1:28:42] seed of what he had already created and
[1:28:46] remember every seed must bring forth
[1:28:48] after its own kind that's what the word
[1:28:51] tells us and we can run that from
[1:28:53] Genesis all the way to Revelation can't
[1:28:55] we and so God began to speak to this
[1:28:58] what was left and what the water had
[1:29:01] flooded and if you watch the language it
[1:29:04] didn't want to take time to do this this
[1:29:05] morning but if you watch the language of
[1:29:07] Genesis the Earth began to rise up out
[1:29:10] of the water the seed of everything that
[1:29:13] God had created in the original creation
[1:29:15] whatever it looked like it's now coming
[1:29:17] up out of the water and taking form to
[1:29:20] recreate the Earth so if they find a
[1:29:24] fossil or a dinosaur or a bone we're not
[1:29:26] like some fundamental Christians who
[1:29:28] deny their existence we just understand
[1:29:31] that they existed in a pre-adamic
[1:29:35] existence a pre-adamic earth and so sure
[1:29:38] they existed to tell your children they
[1:29:40] never existed would be a foolish lie
[1:29:43] what are these Bon well Satan made
[1:29:44] though no no come on folks he didn't
[1:29:47] make those bones they're remnants of
[1:29:49] something that was we don't focus on
[1:29:51] that we're in a recreated Earth if the
[1:29:53] Bible said it I believe it that settles
[1:29:56] it so if there is an Old Testament uh
[1:30:00] you know example type there must be some
[1:30:03] new testament reality so I found what I
[1:30:06] believe is part of this reality in
[1:30:09] Ephesians 4 and if you want to
[1:30:12] understand it uh a lot you can go and
[1:30:15] read the entire book of Hebrews because
[1:30:18] Hebrews is a parallel to to Joshua to
[1:30:21] Exodus to to many of the things that God
[1:30:24] was doing in the Old Testament type he
[1:30:27] fulfilled in the New Testament reality
[1:30:29] of Jesus Christ and we read about that
[1:30:31] in the book of Hebrews but here's a
[1:30:34] reality from Ephesians 4: 13 in the
[1:30:38] Amplified thank you for staying with me
[1:30:40] it says that it might develop until we
[1:30:45] all attain oness in the faith and in the
[1:30:52] comprehension I want you to to to notice
[1:30:56] now that we are about to read of a great
[1:31:03] stature something very
[1:31:07] tall something not of ordinary height
[1:31:11] but something of great stature and great
[1:31:16] height he said uh attain Oneness in the
[1:31:19] faith and in the comprehension of the
[1:31:21] full and accurate knowledge of the Son
[1:31:25] of God that we might
[1:31:28] arrive that we might arrive
[1:31:32] at really mature manhood this is
[1:31:36] spiritually so this is to Sisters too
[1:31:40] this is not this is not you you know uh
[1:31:43] working on the car or or or starting a
[1:31:47] fire without a match and you've really
[1:31:49] you know got the manhood thing down pat
[1:31:51] this is a spiritual manhood
[1:31:54] it's a high one we're actually talking
[1:31:57] about the stature of
[1:31:59] Christ see the enemy wants to cause you
[1:32:02] to be afraid of something that seems
[1:32:05] taller than you are I wish you'd hear
[1:32:09] me no wonder they come out saying
[1:32:11] everybody's a
[1:32:13] giant when reality there was just a
[1:32:15] handful of giants because this is an Old
[1:32:18] Testament type of a new testament
[1:32:20] reality there's going to be a people who
[1:32:24] refuse to fear the
[1:32:27] fullness of the stature that lays before
[1:32:31] them there's a tall guy let me say it
[1:32:33] this way there's a tall guy in your
[1:32:36] future and it's you it's you it's Christ
[1:32:40] first and then it's you so the enemy
[1:32:44] wants to make a an a fearful thing out
[1:32:48] of something taller than you are well
[1:32:50] you're not called to live a life of
[1:32:52] dissension you're you're called to live
[1:32:54] a life of Ascension and you're not
[1:32:57] climbing the corporate ladder you're
[1:32:59] climbing the spiritual ladder which is
[1:33:01] the attributes of Jesus Christ let's
[1:33:04] read it he said into the full and
[1:33:06] accurate knowledge of the Son of God
[1:33:08] that we might arrive at really mature
[1:33:11] manhood the completeness of Personality
[1:33:15] which is nothing less than the standard
[1:33:19] height of Christ's
[1:33:31] yes when when brother brandom is
[1:33:34] preaching the message the stature of a
[1:33:37] perfect
[1:33:38] man I always retitle that when I use the
[1:33:42] phrase the stature of the perfect man
[1:33:46] because we have an
[1:33:48] ample Christ is the first man to come to
[1:33:52] the full maturity
[1:33:54] of of of true sunship you heard what
[1:33:57] Hawke was saying here are you with me I
[1:34:00] know this is a lot for for a short
[1:34:02] amount of time but Hawke was praying and
[1:34:04] he said what a perfect Papa we have and
[1:34:07] then he said something we don't often
[1:34:09] talk about we we talk about how he is a
[1:34:12] perfect father but we don't often talk
[1:34:14] about how he was also an example of what
[1:34:16] it means to be a perfect son because he
[1:34:19] lived in perfect union he said I am my
[1:34:23] father father are one so perfect sunship
[1:34:26] looks like
[1:34:29] Oneness with the father this is the
[1:34:32] sunship promised to the overcoming
[1:34:35] believer that's the that's the sunship
[1:34:37] that's yours that's the sunship that's
[1:34:40] mine that we might also attain unto the
[1:34:44] stature of his maturity his completion
[1:34:49] his Perfection and it's not something we
[1:34:51] win for ourselves it's something that we
[1:34:55] receive as we
[1:34:57] overcome you see when he's preaching
[1:34:59] that stature of a perfect man he draws
[1:35:02] it in a pyramid from Peter and he places
[1:35:05] those virtues like one on top of another
[1:35:09] and you're climbing the pyramid to the
[1:35:11] top and and you you move from one virtue
[1:35:15] to the next are you still here and the
[1:35:17] Holy Spirit told us some years ago that
[1:35:20] it's not just you know passing through
[1:35:23] one virtue to the next it's really a
[1:35:27] birthing something's got to be birthed
[1:35:30] in you before you can climb higher what
[1:35:33] did the Holy Spirit say about this year
[1:35:36] this is a year for mountain climbing I
[1:35:39] he wasn't talking about Everest he
[1:35:41] wasn't talking about rir he was talking
[1:35:44] about Zion this is a year to climb
[1:35:48] higher on Mount Zion and what is Mount
[1:35:51] Zion spiritually it is is the it is the
[1:35:55] it is the measure of the stature of the
[1:35:59] fullness of the Christ the anointed one
[1:36:03] it's Jesus before us as an example in
[1:36:07] Jesus was the perfect father in Jesus
[1:36:10] was the perfect son in order for you and
[1:36:13] I to step into the completion and
[1:36:16] Perfection of a perfect son we've got to
[1:36:19] understand first our Oneness with the
[1:36:22] father Jesus said I don't do anything
[1:36:25] this is what he said I don't do anything
[1:36:28] unless I see or hear it of my father
[1:36:31] when the bride comes to that place that
[1:36:35] she realizes that the enemy has been
[1:36:38] trying to make us fearful of things that
[1:36:41] are taller than
[1:36:44] us and we begin to realize that's our
[1:36:47] destiny we're shorties
[1:36:50] now I feel like brother sadu you know he
[1:36:53] the word shorty a lot we're shorties now
[1:36:56] but we've got something to to climb
[1:37:00] toward we have a goal hear the Holy
[1:37:03] Ghost we have a goal before us it is the
[1:37:06] it is the measure of the Lord's
[1:37:09] Perfection and completion and it looks
[1:37:13] unattainable to us so when we look at
[1:37:16] our present situation all we see is
[1:37:20] Giants a whole land full of them reality
[1:37:24] there's only a few out to get
[1:37:27] you but you have now made them everybody
[1:37:30] everybody's a giant everybody's an enemy
[1:37:32] everybody's out to destroy me let me
[1:37:34] tell you somebody's in a prayer closet
[1:37:36] somewhere praying for you whether you
[1:37:39] know it or not everybody's not out to
[1:37:42] destroy you everybody doesn't want to
[1:37:44] see you fail somebody somewhere loves
[1:37:47] you and is calling your name before the
[1:37:50] Lord so that your vision can change and
[1:37:53] you will refuse to fear everything
[1:37:56] that's higher than what you're living
[1:37:57] right
[1:38:01] now now you're hearing Revelation I hope
[1:38:04] you can grab a hold of it because here
[1:38:07] is an Old Testament example of
[1:38:10] exaggeration based on the
[1:38:12] testimony uh uh evil report of
[1:38:18] 10 you can't always listen to the
[1:38:21] majority
[1:38:23] sometime you've got to listen to the
[1:38:27] minority so I want you to know that the
[1:38:30] enemy gives we have this example in the
[1:38:32] Old Testament of how the enemy the fear
[1:38:36] of the enemy the fear of the Giants that
[1:38:39] walked in the land produced a report
[1:38:43] given to a whole generation a whole a a
[1:38:45] whole nation not generation multiple
[1:38:48] generations of an entire nation could
[1:38:51] have crippled them it could have kept
[1:38:54] them all out of the promise if they
[1:38:58] would have listened to others around us
[1:39:00] if you would have listened to those who
[1:39:03] have spoken against you and against this
[1:39:06] church and against our destiny and
[1:39:09] against our future you would have given
[1:39:12] up a long time
[1:39:14] ago but many of you
[1:39:17] refused when there were even evil
[1:39:20] reports Among Us who said you never even
[1:39:24] fill up the church you've gotten
[1:39:26] now and we know what God can do he
[1:39:29] showed us two years ago that in one year
[1:39:34] that's he can send a
[1:39:36] wave all we need is a few more waves
[1:39:40] we're not looking for more people it's
[1:39:43] not that we feel like we've got to have
[1:39:45] more people or a bigger number but we're
[1:39:47] looking for people who are
[1:39:51] likeminded who refuse to fear the
[1:39:54] stature of the
[1:39:55] enemy because they've got their eyes on
[1:39:58] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:40:02] and we realize that a bride is being
[1:40:05] prepared in the last
[1:40:07] days to have Oneness with the
[1:40:10] Father the prophet said she will have
[1:40:14] thus saith the
[1:40:17] Lord or she
[1:40:19] will keep still right you see we're
[1:40:23] talking talking about a people emerging
[1:40:25] who will know the mind of
[1:40:28] God somebody said how could I ever know
[1:40:30] the mind of God really all you have to
[1:40:32] do is read the
[1:40:33] book this Bible
[1:40:36] reveals the mind of God hear a
[1:40:41] tape hear a
[1:40:43] sermon this these sermons reveal to us
[1:40:47] when we place them in the
[1:40:52] word that they've got to go back to the
[1:40:54] absolute brother brandom had an absolute
[1:40:57] you better have an absolute and for
[1:41:00] those who call the spoken word book uh
[1:41:02] they're they're absolute it's a very
[1:41:04] dangerous thing because man has worked
[1:41:07] on that editors have helped us with
[1:41:12] that you see there were there were
[1:41:14] certain things brother Ram said take
[1:41:16] that
[1:41:17] out but after brother bandham died they
[1:41:20] decided we'll put that back in if he
[1:41:22] wanted that out he knew there was a
[1:41:25] reason he had a reason he knew there was
[1:41:28] some confusion that could come out of
[1:41:30] that some misunderstanding out of that
[1:41:34] for instance the seven seal in the
[1:41:36] Rapture message in Yuma he knew there
[1:41:38] were some things there that could easily
[1:41:40] be misunderstood misunderstood by
[1:41:42] Immature people he said take it out but
[1:41:45] editors decided well he's gone now
[1:41:47] doesn't really matter we want the bride
[1:41:48] to have it all we'll put it all back in
[1:41:50] not realizing that if a if a if a
[1:41:53] prophet has the mind of God he had the
[1:41:55] mind of God when he
[1:41:57] said hello so there's a lot of confusion
[1:42:01] that we wouldn't deal with today if we
[1:42:03] didn't have editors but of course you
[1:42:05] have to have those who handle these
[1:42:07] things and print these things and record
[1:42:09] these things so forth and Etc prayer
[1:42:11] lines taken off I want you to know God
[1:42:14] has ministered to my heart so many times
[1:42:17] in the prayer lines that we have
[1:42:20] left many of them taken off years ago
[1:42:23] never even got to the filtering stage
[1:42:26] because they had already been removed so
[1:42:28] when we filter the tape instead of
[1:42:30] putting it back on it was just left off
[1:42:33] I'm saying that sometime you're you're
[1:42:35] coming to the end and he's ministering I
[1:42:38] think I read one to you recently maybe
[1:42:40] Tuesday night and and he's ministering
[1:42:42] to an individual he's talking to this
[1:42:44] woman he said that Devil's trying to
[1:42:47] tell you you're dying you're going to
[1:42:49] have a heart attack was that what it was
[1:42:51] and die but that's not it it's your
[1:42:53] nerves it's your hormones it's
[1:42:56] menopause somebody said wouldn't that be
[1:42:59] embarrassing I tell you it'd be a whole
[1:43:00] lot better than sitting there thinking
[1:43:02] you're dying of a heart attack or a
[1:43:03] stroke he said no sister your problem is
[1:43:06] in there and we're going to believe
[1:43:09] God to heal you to deliver you to fix
[1:43:11] you so there's a lot of things that are
[1:43:14] in there so everything everything that
[1:43:17] we have today in its written or recorded
[1:43:19] form we must take it back because that's
[1:43:23] what he said he actually said don't take
[1:43:26] my word for it he said check the
[1:43:29] absolute so once we read the word and
[1:43:31] hear the word and we hear the message of
[1:43:34] the hour we receive from what we hear
[1:43:36] placing the message on the word then it
[1:43:39] becomes the same when it fits the word
[1:43:42] when you find its doveet tail then you
[1:43:44] can take all of it and fight the devil
[1:43:47] but the Bible is our absolute
[1:43:53] if for no other reason because he said
[1:43:55] so if you're a purist because he said so
[1:43:59] what about the mistake he said so well
[1:44:01] what about all the mistranslations or
[1:44:04] names dropped or stories he said so he
[1:44:06] said this Bible we have is an absolute
[1:44:09] reality we can stand on that so we take
[1:44:12] what we hear we place it there and we
[1:44:14] begin to see a fuller picture we see the
[1:44:17] right interpretation of the word because
[1:44:19] of the message that God has sent us we
[1:44:21] should be very grateful for it
[1:44:23] but we shouldn't deoti men we shouldn't
[1:44:26] worship men no we should put our faith
[1:44:30] our trust beyond our pastor Beyond a
[1:44:33] prophet Beyond come on beyond our church
[1:44:35] members it's Christ who perfects us it's
[1:44:39] his Perfection we're working toward
[1:44:41] Satan wants you to be afraid of anything
[1:44:43] higher than you and Christ wants you to
[1:44:45] be willing to take a hold of anything
[1:44:47] that's higher than you because he knows
[1:44:49] it's him so he's saying come up and
[1:44:53] isn't that what he said in Revelation 4
[1:44:55] there's a door opening up John don't you
[1:44:58] want to come up here and see don't you
[1:45:01] want to come up in here there's a bride
[1:45:04] that will not be satisfied uh staying on
[1:45:06] the other side of the Jordan fearing
[1:45:08] things that are higher than they are
[1:45:11] they're going to climb they're going to
[1:45:13] go through the open door they're going
[1:45:15] to go through the open Heaven they're
[1:45:16] going to take a hold of the measure the
[1:45:18] stature the measure the fullness of
[1:45:20] Christ and they're going to manifest
[1:45:24] the only seed that's worth manifesting
[1:45:26] his seed anybody with me it's not your
[1:45:30] natural seed that's not worth
[1:45:32] manifesting but his spiritual seed in
[1:45:34] you is aren't you glad you carry it oh
[1:45:38] my I'm tired it's just 12:41 let me take
[1:45:40] just a few more moments now go to
[1:45:43] numbers
[1:45:46] four you've seen at least a glimpse I'll
[1:45:51] take some time in the future to to
[1:45:53] ground that old testament old testament
[1:45:56] example connecting it to a new testament
[1:45:58] reality I'll do that another time but I
[1:46:01] want to read this first this is numbers
[1:46:03] 14 next chapter over you still with me
[1:46:06] praise God and all the congregation
[1:46:09] lifted up their voice and cried and the
[1:46:13] people wept that night why because this
[1:46:17] evil report had been
[1:46:19] given we're going to die we're all going
[1:46:22] to die the Giants are going to eat us if
[1:46:24] the Giants don't get us the land is
[1:46:26] going to get us cuz the land eats up its
[1:46:28] own inhabitants hello can you imagine
[1:46:31] sitting around oh
[1:46:33] children we we we must try not to be
[1:46:36] afraid the land that God has promised us
[1:46:40] opens its mouth and swallows People Like
[1:46:42] Us children we must not be afraid
[1:46:45] everybody all 10 million 100 million we
[1:46:48] don't know how all 100 million of them
[1:46:50] are giants and if they step on us they
[1:46:53] crush us like grasshoppers real
[1:46:55] encouraging message isn't it it sounds
[1:46:57] like some of us when we when we've been
[1:46:59] listening to Too Much media social media
[1:47:02] and everything is rotten everything's a
[1:47:04] conspiracy I believe there are
[1:47:05] conspiracy theories no doubt about it
[1:47:07] you get don't get under that
[1:47:09] Spirit don't get under that Eric Norman
[1:47:13] I hung up on him one time my dear friend
[1:47:15] who's with the Lord I hung up on him one
[1:47:18] time because he was getting so carried
[1:47:20] away
[1:47:23] you see I wouldn't be surprised I don't
[1:47:25] know why I've asked the Lord why I
[1:47:27] wouldn't be surprised if that's not one
[1:47:29] of the reasons the Lord just called him
[1:47:30] home because you can get so caught up on
[1:47:34] everything being a conspiracy that you
[1:47:36] don't know what to believe and you start
[1:47:38] even losing sight of what is
[1:47:40] absolute everybody's got to have an
[1:47:43] anchor everybody's got to have an
[1:47:46] absolute everybody's got to have
[1:47:48] something to measure everything else by
[1:47:51] and so you've got to be a little bit
[1:47:52] careful there so the people wept that
[1:47:55] night and all all the children of Israel
[1:47:57] and here's what happens when people get
[1:47:59] their their dreams dashed you know oh
[1:48:02] we're going to take the land we're going
[1:48:03] to take the land we're going to take the
[1:48:04] land then they find out there's
[1:48:06] obstacles then they find out they're
[1:48:09] Giants then they find out that the giant
[1:48:11] grapes are not the only thing giant
[1:48:13] they're people there their whole family
[1:48:15] of in fact everybody's a giant if you
[1:48:17] listen to the 10 who gave the evil
[1:48:19] report so what do people do they begin
[1:48:21] to murmur against the leadership
[1:48:23] they murmured against Moses and against
[1:48:25] Aaron and the whole congregation said
[1:48:27] unto them would God that we had died
[1:48:31] come
[1:48:33] on would God that we had died in the
[1:48:38] land of
[1:48:39] Egypt or would God we had died in the
[1:48:43] wilderness yes you know I can see this
[1:48:48] we don't want Giants to eat us so we we
[1:48:51] wish we to starve to death in the
[1:48:53] wilderness so the vultures could have
[1:48:56] eaten our bones and we wouldn't have
[1:48:57] known anything about it it makes no
[1:49:00] sense this place that the children of
[1:49:03] Israel got in we wished we would have
[1:49:05] just died over there in Egypt forgetting
[1:49:07] the promise and look you selfish
[1:49:10] somebody if you don't want the promise
[1:49:13] maybe your son
[1:49:15] does maybe your daughter does maybe your
[1:49:19] granddaughter does maybe your grandson
[1:49:22] wants to inherit the promise so maybe
[1:49:25] maybe you should have died over there in
[1:49:27] Egypt or in the wilderness but thank God
[1:49:29] you didn't because now you're bringing
[1:49:32] forth another
[1:49:34] generation who may find the
[1:49:37] faith to conquer the giant who may get
[1:49:41] their eyes hear me they may get their
[1:49:44] eyes so fixed on the on the fullness in
[1:49:48] the stature of Christ that they that
[1:49:51] they're not looking looking at the
[1:49:53] height of their enemy and listening to
[1:49:57] the fear that the enemy spews they're
[1:49:59] looking at the at the man in the mirror
[1:50:01] who is no longer
[1:50:03] you but it's now Christ you look at
[1:50:06] Christ long enough you'll be like him
[1:50:08] that's what the word said you look at
[1:50:11] your enemy long enough you'll be like
[1:50:12] him that's
[1:50:15] right you like to write those little
[1:50:17] sayings down write that one down that
[1:50:19] was
[1:50:20] good you you spend your time looking at
[1:50:23] Jesus the Bible tells us more like him
[1:50:26] you look more like him you'll become but
[1:50:28] if you focus on your enemy you're only
[1:50:32] going to behave and mimic his behavior
[1:50:35] so maybe you're going to wish that you
[1:50:37] would have died a generation ago or died
[1:50:40] in the wilderness on the way over but
[1:50:42] think about your children and your
[1:50:45] grandchildren they may be the ones who
[1:50:47] don't let the height of the enemy keep
[1:50:49] them from the height of their Destiny
[1:50:52] and the height of their Destiny is the
[1:50:54] fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ
[1:50:56] I wish you were with me some of you are
[1:50:58] I appreciate it very much this sad bunch
[1:51:00] of people oh wish we W and there and
[1:51:03] wherefore hath the Lord brought
[1:51:06] us into this land to Fall by The Sword
[1:51:11] and our W I don't think you need the
[1:51:13] sword the land eats the people remember
[1:51:15] that our wives and our children should
[1:51:17] be a prey were it not better for us to
[1:51:22] return turn to Egypt that's real good so
[1:51:25] there's a little problem around the
[1:51:27] message something didn't turn out just
[1:51:29] like somebody thought it
[1:51:32] was somebody's interpretation of a sign
[1:51:35] wasn't exactly what the sign was and
[1:51:39] maybe there was a you know few less died
[1:51:41] when when they
[1:51:42] thought so why don't we just
[1:51:45] all throw it all away and return to
[1:51:49] Egypt where they worship frogs
[1:51:54] you know I'd rather take my
[1:51:58] chances with a prophet who had an
[1:52:00] imperfect recall
[1:52:02] that's because the message itself is
[1:52:05] what sits on the on the word that's
[1:52:08] right that's why we're following this
[1:52:09] truth not because of a cloud not because
[1:52:12] of a a pillar of fire in a
[1:52:14] photograph if that's what Vindicated the
[1:52:17] truth for you you were looking for
[1:52:19] something like that there were people
[1:52:21] who were looking looking for something
[1:52:23] that would unlock the
[1:52:27] word this message for me unlocked the
[1:52:30] word so all the other testimonies are
[1:52:33] are are just icing on the cake and a
[1:52:35] cherry on top I don't follow for that I
[1:52:38] follow because the word has been
[1:52:40] unlocked I no longer see Jesus between
[1:52:43] the
[1:52:43] lattice he's now in full view we know
[1:52:48] who he is we know he's not the second
[1:52:50] person of a trinity
[1:52:53] we know who he is he's who John said he
[1:52:55] was but we couldn't believe John because
[1:52:59] the church had told us something
[1:53:01] else John told us he was the word made
[1:53:04] flesh but the denominational system had
[1:53:07] told us that he was the second person of
[1:53:09] a
[1:53:10] trinity but you can't be the second
[1:53:12] person of a trinity and the word made
[1:53:14] flesh at the same time because the word
[1:53:17] made flesh is the word of God in in its
[1:53:21] entirety and morality now in a human
[1:53:25] body and that's why the fullness the
[1:53:28] scripture said the fullness of the
[1:53:29] godhead bodily
[1:53:31] dwelt in Christ so when Christ came
[1:53:35] there was no more no more God over there
[1:53:37] and God over there and God somewhere
[1:53:40] else there's a first person somewhere
[1:53:42] and a third person and a 10th person
[1:53:43] somewhere no no no no no When Jesus
[1:53:46] showed
[1:53:48] up the the entirety of the godhead had
[1:53:51] found a body and by the way the whole
[1:53:54] family of Heaven is named after
[1:53:58] him so do you know what your name is m
[1:54:02] Jesus Christ the New Testament said we
[1:54:05] bear the name of the family wo we carry
[1:54:09] the family
[1:54:10] name and it's not Shelly the family name
[1:54:14] is Ms Jesus
[1:54:16] Christ that's what I got to keep my eyes
[1:54:19] on not that not that giant let's go on
[1:54:23] my we got to
[1:54:27] hurry and they said one to another let
[1:54:29] us make a captain and let us return un
[1:54:32] Egypt that's always the
[1:54:35] answer like like like our nation let's
[1:54:38] just get us a new
[1:54:41] president as tempting as that as that
[1:54:44] sounds and we definitely have got to
[1:54:46] have a president because we don't have
[1:54:48] one now there's no doubt about it that
[1:54:50] we've got to get one please understand
[1:54:52] that not one man is going to be able to
[1:54:55] fix what's wrong because Washington is
[1:54:57] full of
[1:54:59] crooks on both sides of the aisle and
[1:55:02] the only way we could have real hope is
[1:55:04] to get rid of all of them and start over
[1:55:07] our Constitution doesn't allow that so
[1:55:10] we're going to have to put up with a lot
[1:55:12] of stuff until Rapture time now a good
[1:55:16] strong leader could make a a good
[1:55:17] difference there's no doubt about it but
[1:55:19] there's always going to be liberals
[1:55:24] my family said that she didn't mean it
[1:55:26] that way but I'm trying to keep up with
[1:55:27] the way things are going now and and the
[1:55:30] the strange looking little waitress that
[1:55:32] that we had yesterday little odd way
[1:55:34] about her just very very strange way I
[1:55:36] go up to pay the bill and she asked me
[1:55:39] she asked me what their name
[1:55:42] is I had Eliana Jane what their name is
[1:55:47] my family said well that wouldn't have
[1:55:48] been appropriate to say it well in my
[1:55:50] generation you wouldn't have been
[1:55:52] offended if someone said oh what's his
[1:55:55] name that wouldn't have been offensive
[1:55:57] because you you would have said it in
[1:55:58] your tone you wouldn't have said what's
[1:55:59] his name or what it what what is it what
[1:56:03] what's its
[1:56:04] name she said to
[1:56:07] me what's their
[1:56:12] name I considered that she was nervous
[1:56:15] she'd been rude the whole day I wasn't
[1:56:18] expecting her to be nice all of a sudden
[1:56:21] but I said oh she's one her name is
[1:56:25] Elana
[1:56:28] Jane I realized she didn't want to
[1:56:31] offend me cuz you know you can just
[1:56:33] imagine I looked like somebody who used
[1:56:37] various
[1:56:38] pronouns she didn't know which pronoun
[1:56:41] to use for the baby so she used a plural
[1:56:44] one instead of a singular one this world
[1:56:49] is in trouble if you keep your eyes on
[1:56:52] this you'll never see
[1:56:56] him you're going to have to take your
[1:56:58] eyes off of what's around you your
[1:57:01] enemies too and get your eyes on him the
[1:57:05] word he's the only thing that's going to
[1:57:07] remain Rock
[1:57:09] Steady in an
[1:57:11] election I'm depending on him to help me
[1:57:15] get through what this Earth is is about
[1:57:17] we we know that Earth birth pains are
[1:57:19] coming worse than what we have known
[1:57:22] the Bible tells us so come on then Moses
[1:57:26] and Aaron fell on their faces before all
[1:57:29] the Assembly of the congregation of the
[1:57:31] children of Israel stay with me just
[1:57:33] another few
[1:57:34] moments and uh Joshua the son of noon
[1:57:37] and Caleb the son uh of yeona which were
[1:57:41] of them that searched the land rent
[1:57:44] their
[1:57:45] clothes and they spake unto all the
[1:57:48] company of the children of Israel saying
[1:57:49] the land which we pass through to search
[1:57:51] it is an exceeding good
[1:57:55] land
[1:57:57] hello if the Lord Delight in us then he
[1:57:59] will bring us into this land and give it
[1:58:03] us a land which floweth with milk and
[1:58:05] honey do you understand that somebody
[1:58:08] saw the vision that it's not up to us to
[1:58:11] take the land it's up to him to help us
[1:58:14] get what he promised we don't overcome
[1:58:16] in our own power we get over in his
[1:58:19] power somebody spoke some reality here
[1:58:23] it is indeed a land flowing with milk
[1:58:25] and honey let's go
[1:58:26] on only Rebel not ye against the Lord
[1:58:31] neither fear
[1:58:33] ye the people of the
[1:58:37] land hello I hope you're hearing this
[1:58:40] you hearing this
[1:58:41] Luke jurnigan want to make sure
[1:58:45] everybody is hearing this because this
[1:58:47] is of utmost importance only Rebel not
[1:58:51] against the Lord neither fear ye the
[1:58:54] people of the land for they
[1:58:59] are
[1:59:02] bread
[1:59:04] bread it it's gone to from them eating
[1:59:10] us to us eating
[1:59:14] them now please understand this was not
[1:59:17] a a there there is a Prohibition in the
[1:59:20] in the Covenant that you can't eat flesh
[1:59:23] and drink blood that's right it's only
[1:59:26] spiritually that we that we eat the
[1:59:28] Flesh of Jesus Christ it's spiritually
[1:59:30] symbolically that we drink his blood
[1:59:33] otherwise we're
[1:59:34] vampires the Bible said the life is in
[1:59:37] the blood to consume the blood is to
[1:59:40] take something's life to try to consume
[1:59:42] its life and and that's why that's why
[1:59:46] Kosher meat is is butchered in a certain
[1:59:48] way because they're they're trying to
[1:59:51] understand what this scripture was
[1:59:53] saying so it's hung and cut in a certain
[1:59:55] way so that the uh uh the the the
[1:59:58] maximum amount of blood flows out of it
[2:00:01] so that you don't eat anything in its
[2:00:02] own blood this is really a spiritual
[2:00:05] concept that man once again is made a
[2:00:07] very natural way of trying to explain it
[2:00:10] I'll just stick with the spirit if you
[2:00:12] don't mind but anyway moving right along
[2:00:16] he's not saying Caleb or Joshua's
[2:00:19] talking now it just says they we don't
[2:00:21] know exactly which one brother brandom
[2:00:23] calls it in one place Joshua I read
[2:00:25] where many other people call it Caleb
[2:00:27] but one of the two somebody one of them
[2:00:30] is talking back here and uh they're
[2:00:33] saying that we're not going to rebel
[2:00:36] against God we're not going to fear the
[2:00:37] people of the land for they are just
[2:00:39] bread for us he's not meaning that we
[2:00:43] will physically eat them he's meaning
[2:00:46] that the more we
[2:00:48] conquer the more we Face our fears
[2:00:52] yeah it's an
[2:00:54] analogy the stronger we get and we just
[2:00:59] live from one Victory to a next from one
[2:01:02] glory to a next from One Faith and
[2:01:05] strength to the next faith and strength
[2:01:08] just like the Bible said you know like
[2:01:10] David you kill a lion and a
[2:01:14] bear then a Goliath don't look like so
[2:01:17] much of an enemy you're you know what
[2:01:19] are you you uncircumcised philistine
[2:01:22] uh God's already given me the lion God's
[2:01:24] already given me the bear he'll give me
[2:01:26] your head too so from one Victory you
[2:01:30] move on so you you knock one giant down
[2:01:33] you can go after the next one that's
[2:01:34] what that's the the analogy that's being
[2:01:37] spoken here but I like the way it
[2:01:39] reads they're just breed for
[2:01:42] us they're not really in our way they're
[2:01:46] really just little
[2:01:48] battles that we have to win to get to to
[2:01:52] the bigger Victory I wish you were
[2:01:54] listening to the bigger Victory that's
[2:01:57] on the other side we're not going to
[2:01:59] fear them is that right and look what
[2:02:03] the next verse said there's two more
[2:02:04] verses but all the congregate did that
[2:02:07] not sound like an amazing sermon to you
[2:02:10] fear the lord don't rebel against him
[2:02:12] we're going to eat them
[2:02:15] all wouldn't that encourage
[2:02:19] you well it didn't encourage the
[2:02:24] church isn't it amazing that a preacher
[2:02:27] can hear from God dig and and bring
[2:02:31] something from the word to feed the
[2:02:34] people to strengthen the people to bless
[2:02:37] the
[2:02:38] people to help guide and direct and
[2:02:42] correct shape and mold the
[2:02:46] people and when he delivers it I I if
[2:02:49] he's been with God it sounds like God to
[2:02:51] him
[2:02:53] him isn't it amazing
[2:02:56] when something inspired he thinks at
[2:02:59] least is inspired can go over in the
[2:03:02] house like a lead
[2:03:04] balloon or a rat sandwich or who's he
[2:03:08] preaching to or this is the wrong church
[2:03:11] or why is he picking on me but here's
[2:03:13] what happens when the people are not in
[2:03:16] tune thank God you are but when the
[2:03:18] people are not in tune with their leader
[2:03:20] they can't really hear the full
[2:03:22] effectiveness of what he says and so
[2:03:24] he's giving this amazing advice we're
[2:03:26] going to eat
[2:03:28] him we got to deal with them one way or
[2:03:30] the other we're going to mow them
[2:03:33] down come on
[2:03:35] team you think of your little sport
[2:03:37] analogy you know come on
[2:03:40] team like the like the little movie The
[2:03:42] Kendrick brothers made Facing the Giants
[2:03:45] and they brought it down to a football
[2:03:47] we can do
[2:03:50] this you know one time I showed the
[2:03:53] clip of the quarterback with the coach
[2:03:55] on his back or another dude on his back
[2:03:58] and he's and he's pulling him pulling
[2:04:00] him or whatever he was position he
[2:04:02] played he's got him on his back and he's
[2:04:05] plowing the field and pushing the
[2:04:07] obstacles and what have you out of his
[2:04:09] way because that's a pretty good analogy
[2:04:12] when he gets through with the sermon
[2:04:13] when you get through here's the here's
[2:04:15] the reaction of the people reminds me of
[2:04:17] so many people around this
[2:04:19] message but all the congregation B Stone
[2:04:23] them with
[2:04:27] stones
[2:04:29] nobody we don't have reason to believe
[2:04:31] that anybody believed the sermon we can
[2:04:35] make bread out of them hear
[2:04:39] me we can make bread out of them and the
[2:04:42] glory of the Lord appeared in the
[2:04:44] Tabernacle of the congregation before
[2:04:46] all the children of Israel because
[2:04:48] sometimes when the people can't say Amen
[2:04:52] God
[2:04:53] will come on and the Lord said unto
[2:04:55] Moses how long will this people provoke
[2:04:57] me and how long will it be a they
[2:04:59] believe me for all the signs which I
[2:05:01] have showed among them I will Smite them
[2:05:05] one more verse with the pestilence I
[2:05:07] will disinherit them and will make of
[2:05:10] thee a greater nation and mightier than
[2:05:13] they that's a pretty serious word isn't
[2:05:15] it now how many of you know In fairness
[2:05:18] Moses goes before God on behalf of the
[2:05:21] people and says please don't do that and
[2:05:24] so God settled with Moses and he said
[2:05:26] how about I'll just wipe out this
[2:05:29] generation the generation of the evil
[2:05:32] report hello and I'll raise up their
[2:05:39] sons all their fathers could see was the
[2:05:41] reasons why not how about I fall on a
[2:05:45] generation that all they can see
[2:05:50] is yes you can
[2:05:53] yes you can sir this sermon is already
[2:05:56] titled online yes you
[2:05:58] can turn to somebody and say yes you
[2:06:03] can and the reality is if you
[2:06:08] don't if you're called to it and you
[2:06:11] don't God will bypass you he won't let
[2:06:15] you stop the flow that's right he'll go
[2:06:19] down to your children and your
[2:06:20] grandchildren
[2:06:22] he'll find a younger
[2:06:26] people who won't keep their eyes on the
[2:06:29] Giants they keep their eyes on the
[2:06:31] fullness of the stature of Christ are

[2:07:38] make the promise brother brandom didn't
[2:07:40] make the promise God made the promise of

[2:07:51] God who made the promise and let's stay

[2:09:23] got that
[2:09:26] uhoh hello it's
[2:09:29] quiet if you haven't got
[2:09:34] that you're not even in the
[2:09:37] battle if everybody in your life agrees

[2:09:43] everything you're not even in the
[2:09:46] battle here you think you're fighting so
[2:09:49] hard and you're not even fighting you're
[2:09:51] not even in the battle God's got to
[2:09:54] place people in your life it don't make
[2:09:56] them
[2:09:57] right that you may not be right they may
[2:09:59] not be right but just because they're
[2:10:01] fussing with you don't mean they're
[2:10:02] right but God lets them be there at time

[2:10:23] Holy Roller there's got to be somebody
[2:10:25] to look at your wife and daughters when
[2:10:27] you walk into a room somebody's got to
[2:10:38] go how abnormal that is to be
[2:10:44] modest how weird how strange how
[2:10:48] crazy how Gaz it is
[2:10:52] is to cover your
[2:10:55] body
[2:11:00] hello oh my goodness
[2:11:03] people you know it's
[2:11:06] lingerie what people wear in public is
[2:11:09] lingerie are you really going to talk

[2:11:12] a minute on yeah
[2:11:14] lingerie they they don't even you know
[2:11:17] and put a little shirt over it oh my
[2:11:19] hanging out everywhere every it way
[2:11:22] hanging everywhere you can't tell
[2:11:25] whether they're fighting to get in it or
[2:11:26] fighting to get out of
[2:11:28] it it's like the Oldtimer said I've seen
[2:11:31] more cotton in an aspirin
[2:11:35] bottle and then they call you a Holy
[2:11:38] Roller some goody goody CU you don't do
[2:11:41] just like they do oh they got you got to
[2:11:44] have it it's a trial if you haven't got
[2:11:46] that you're not even the battle what did
[2:11:48] you join the church he said what you
[2:11:50] know what what what's the use let's go
[2:11:53] on what did you join the Army and get
[2:11:56] training for to lay around strut up and
[2:11:58] down the street and show off that's the
[2:12:00] way some Christians act that we want to
[2:12:02] be looked up to you need not expect the
[2:12:05] world to look up to you anymore that was
[2:12:08] a generation ago where someone really
[2:12:10] respected a woman who looked like a
[2:12:16] woman that's not this generation they
[2:12:19] resent it it's judgmental to them of
[2:12:23] course you're going to run into people
[2:12:24] who remember the good old days but this
[2:12:27] generation you know you're a you're a a
[2:12:30] prude you're you're judging me I didn't
[2:12:33] even talk to you I didn't even look at
[2:12:37] you you you know I want to say sometime
[2:12:40] when you're confronted like that you you
[2:12:41] know you've got so many holes in your
[2:12:43] body I think your brain slipped through
[2:12:45] one of
[2:12:47] them but I'm not judging you do like you
[2:12:52] want to but move and give me the
[2:12:56] freedom to move like I want to move he
[2:13:00] said don't wait don't wait they're not
[2:13:01] going to look up to you some you ain't
[2:13:03] going to be looked up to let's go
[2:13:06] on you're going to be looked down on for
[2:13:10] all that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[2:13:12] shall what suffer persecutions pick up
[2:13:15] the
[2:13:16] sword pick up the sword don't cry and
[2:13:20] belly a and say I'm I'm persecuted on my
[2:13:22] job my family persecutes me everybody
[2:13:25] hates me nobody loves me I think I'll
[2:13:28] eat
[2:13:29] worms no the prophet said pick up the
[2:13:32] sword cut everything free from
[2:13:35] you don't let their words slow you down
[2:13:39] don't let them be lies of giants in your
[2:13:42] ears don't let your enemies Tower over
[2:13:46] you you climb higher than they are every
[2:13:49] and keep going on is that what he said
[2:13:52] Joshua Caleb stealed the people few more
[2:13:56] minutes they said we can't take it we
[2:13:59] just can't do it that's all see they
[2:14:03] were looking at the amalekites Joshua
[2:14:05] and
[2:14:07] Caleb thank you sister Kathy was looking
[2:14:10] at the promise he said that's the
[2:14:13] difference I want you to tell somebody
[2:14:15] that's the difference they were looking
[2:14:17] at the
[2:14:18] promise I want you to tell somebody else
[2:14:21] yes you
[2:14:22] can oh yes you
[2:14:27] can they were looking at the promise
[2:14:30] that's the
[2:14:31] difference depends on what you're
[2:14:34] looking
[2:14:35] at if you look at your problems they
[2:14:41] grow you're your normal enemy six foot
[2:14:44] you know but you keep staring at your
[2:14:46] enemy
[2:14:51] brother Ram talks to us about you know
[2:14:53] brother Papa
[2:14:55] wz his dream of the of the shoe devil
[2:14:59] thing here's this big enemy towering
[2:15:01] over
[2:15:03] him and and he just starts using the
[2:15:05] Bible boo
[2:15:07] devil and the next thing you know what
[2:15:09] happens to his giant he begins to eat
[2:15:13] him because he starts getting little
[2:15:15] little
[2:15:17] little until he's no more than a frog
[2:15:19] leg on a plate
[2:15:21] don't eat frog legs but anyway Move
[2:15:23] Along depends on what you're looking at
[2:15:26] Joshua said we're more we're more we're
[2:15:31] more evil report we can't we can't I
[2:15:35] never will I don't have what it
[2:15:38] takes positive report oh yes you
[2:15:42] can oh yes you can I can't weather this
[2:15:46] storm oh yes you can I can't conquer my
[2:15:49] Temptation oh oh yes you can I can't get
[2:15:53] victory over my addiction oh yes you can
[2:15:58] what are you looking
[2:16:00] at if you're looking at the giant
[2:16:03] everybody looks giant if you're looking
[2:16:06] at your
[2:16:08] promise watch Giants begin to shrink
[2:16:12] watch enemies Begin to
[2:16:14] Fall watch them go from looking like
[2:16:16] your conqueror to your sandwich
[2:16:23] this is the
[2:16:26] concept you see the scripture reveals
[2:16:28] two ways I'm I'm going don't leave it up
[2:16:31] just leave it right up the scripture
[2:16:32] reveals two ways to deal with a
[2:16:36] giant in in 1st Samuel 17 we won't read
[2:16:39] it but in 1st Samuel
[2:16:41] 17 we can do like David did we can cut
[2:16:45] the giant down we can knock him down and
[2:16:48] cut his head off
[2:16:50] that's what David did but Goliath
[2:16:53] knocked him down the word got to him
[2:16:55] before the stone ever
[2:16:56] did it's the word of the Lord how dare
[2:17:00] you defy the
[2:17:02] armies of the most high God the reality
[2:17:07] the Revelation that there was one God
[2:17:10] mightier than the all the gods that
[2:17:12] people had made up in their mind that
[2:17:13] word hit the
[2:17:15] giant before the stone did the stone
[2:17:18] knocked him right over and David ran
[2:17:21] over and took the sword and cut his head
[2:17:24] off with the sword so you've got a
[2:17:26] choice what you want to do with your
[2:17:28] enemy you can hit him with a word you
[2:17:30] can cut his head
[2:17:31] off or the other way the Bible other way
[2:17:34] the scripture talks about dealing with
[2:17:35] giant you can eat
[2:17:38] them you can eat them it's a metaphor
[2:17:41] they're bread for us and if you would
[2:17:43] have seen the expression it's actually
[2:17:45] is actually something that's used in
[2:17:46] Hebrew more than once and it's a
[2:17:48] metaphor of bending over and harvesting
[2:17:51] something with your hand and drawing it
[2:17:54] to your
[2:17:55] mouth so Joshua or Caleb whoever was
[2:17:59] doing the talking here that's really
[2:18:00] what he said when he when when we read
[2:18:02] this in the scripture that's really what
[2:18:04] he did there's a metaphor attached to
[2:18:06] the phrase and he said you know these
[2:18:09] Giants they're just bread for
[2:18:13] us and he probably symbolized it with
[2:18:16] the hebraism he plucked it and Drew it
[2:18:20] up to his mouth or they can be breed for
[2:18:23] us now I want you to know if you'd have
[2:18:25] had an ear to hear that day if you'd
[2:18:27] have been spiritual your nine foot
[2:18:29] giant would have been reduced to your
[2:18:32] paper plate that you eat your baloney
[2:18:35] sandwich on that's all he was trying to
[2:18:37] do is to show them what looks like it's
[2:18:39] big enough to crush you with his toe is
[2:18:43] no more than a loaf of bread on your
[2:18:45] plate when you've got your eye on the
[2:18:47] promise instead of the size of your
[2:18:50] enemy I'm preaching to you today I got
[2:18:53] to go but I'm preaching to you today so
[2:18:56] you've got to look you got to look at
[2:18:58] your situation and see if it's really
[2:19:01] really
[2:19:03] that
[2:19:05] Gargantua so
[2:19:08] huge or will you turn and look at your
[2:19:11] promise and will it happen for you like
[2:19:13] it happened to Joshua and Caleb the
[2:19:14] enemy just starts getting little little
[2:19:16] I can get over this he said we're more
[2:19:18] than able they're only bread for us us
[2:19:21] come on brother brandham said why they
[2:19:24] look great listen they look
[2:19:27] great he's bragging on the they look
[2:19:29] great they're
[2:19:32] great they are great sir you hear what
[2:19:35] he's saying little humor here they are
[2:19:38] great they'll make great
[2:19:41] bread brother Bam's carrying the analogy
[2:19:44] the little joke a little further yeah
[2:19:46] they're great they're great J great men
[2:19:50] men of great stature well they'll just
[2:19:52] make great bread they'll just make a
[2:19:55] great
[2:19:58] snack I thought this was so amazing
[2:20:00] because my son showed me a video this
[2:20:02] week of a very popular worship group on
[2:20:07] uh on uh social media I don't know where
[2:20:10] all they are Tik Tok Instagram all the
[2:20:12] all the various places not to be they're
[2:20:15] there and they have
[2:20:18] apologized for one of their favorite
[2:20:21] songs and and you know what I'm done I'm
[2:20:25] done I'm done I when when the
[2:20:29] woke mentality reaches worship I'm
[2:20:32] through with that I don't ever have to
[2:20:35] hear another i' never heard him before
[2:20:36] anyway so they're not they're not going
[2:20:38] to miss my my
[2:20:40] dollar but you know they apologize he
[2:20:42] said this morning he just he just
[2:20:44] getting ready to run over that song
[2:20:46] again his favorite worship song and he
[2:20:47] said we we just you know we just
[2:20:49] realized that it that it sounds so
[2:20:52] violent e eat we eat Giants for our
[2:20:55] bread or or or our enemy becomes bread
[2:20:58] it just sounds so Old Testament did did
[2:21:01] am I saying it right
[2:21:05] Benjamin oh oh yeah yeah excuse me it
[2:21:07] wasn't the bread it was the
[2:21:10] water praise is the is the water our
[2:21:13] enemies drowned in it's the same kind of
[2:21:15] concept I don't know why they didn't say
[2:21:16] this probably don't sing this one it's
[2:21:18] too violent you know the song that we
[2:21:20] sing about
[2:21:21] Giants now they now we can't do the
[2:21:24] little phrase Praises of what our
[2:21:26] enemies drowning because enemies
[2:21:27] drowning it sounds too Old
[2:21:30] Testament it sounds too violent that
[2:21:32] that represents the Old Testament you
[2:21:34] don't read anything about like that
[2:21:35] going on in the New Testament you know I
[2:21:38] got a serious problem with that there
[2:21:41] was a lot going on in the Old
[2:21:43] Testament there was a lot going on in
[2:21:45] the New Testament too slightly different
[2:21:48] Covenant slightly different Grace but if
[2:21:51] you just go one generation past the New
[2:21:54] Testament you'll find out that the
[2:21:56] church has always been they were being
[2:21:58] persecuted then but one generation pass
[2:22:02] they were being persecuted like never
[2:22:04] before come on and murdered for their
[2:22:07] faith so there comes a time that your
[2:22:10] faith has to get you know your strength
[2:22:12] has to get a little violent we're not
[2:22:13] literally going to start eating one
[2:22:15] another or drowning one another in
[2:22:17] waters of Praise it's symbolic
[2:22:21] and it means we're not going to let the
[2:22:23] enemy defeat us we're going to praise
[2:22:28] Anyway come on and our praise will be
[2:22:32] like the Red
[2:22:34] Sea that Pharaoh's Army drowned
[2:22:39] in and when they looked over and saw
[2:22:41] Pharaoh's Army drowning in the Red Sea
[2:22:44] the enemy defeated what did Miriam do
[2:22:47] she picked up a tambourine and danced
[2:22:49] before the Lord
[2:22:52] The Horse and Rider thrown into the
[2:22:56] sea people are getting too
[2:22:59] strange too violent what battle are you
[2:23:03] are you you know what you're you're
[2:23:05] you're on a picnic then we're not on a
[2:23:08] picnic we're on a battlefield we got
[2:23:10] enemies we're not talking about people
[2:23:12] maybe you misunderstand we're not talk
[2:23:14] about people we're not facing physical
[2:23:17] Giants we're facing those giants in the
[2:23:20] spirit and they're only giant because we
[2:23:22] concentrate on them we focus on them and
[2:23:25] they grow you get the point the Bible
[2:23:28] teaches us to fear them not now let's go
[2:23:31] on we're more than able yeah yeah they
[2:23:33] different with us they're scared of us
[2:23:35] sure sure the fear of the Lord's upon
[2:23:38] every one of them here's a different
[2:23:39] report instead of us fearing them the
[2:23:42] fear of the Lord is falling on every one
[2:23:44] of them they're scared to death of us
[2:23:47] that's the kind of sermon you want to
[2:23:48] hear let's go take it get God give it to
[2:23:52] us so it's
[2:23:55] ours oh yes you can Samuel Duke oh yes
[2:24:00] you

[2:24:25] this far to make your enemy a
[2:24:27] snack
[2:24:30] hello let's go on and take
[2:24:34] it where where's the
[2:24:36] next oh if I could get that Pentecostal
[2:24:39] group together he's talking about his
[2:24:41] own generation that uncircumcised
[2:24:43] Philistine standing out there and they
[2:24:45] say we have to have this we have to have
[2:24:46] that he saw the Pentecostal Church
[2:24:48] churches reaching out for entertainment
[2:24:51] and for all kinds of fellowships and
[2:24:53] organizations because they wanted to
[2:24:55] attract and draw the people in he said
[2:24:57] we have to have all this all that
[2:24:59] nonsense he said we'll have to kind of
[2:25:01] go in the world Council of churches to
[2:25:03] have fellowship with them that's
[2:25:05] nonsense he said our fellowship is from
[2:25:08] God not with a council of men and
[2:25:11] man-made Dogma we are the people of God
[2:25:14] who expect
[2:25:15] Fellowship God that's where our rights
[2:25:18] is with God how can we fellow fellowship
[2:25:20] with God lest we Fellowship in his word
[2:25:23] because the word is God and the word
[2:25:25] made flesh when it
[2:25:31] becomes was that a misspeak oh no he
[2:25:35] said if you abide in me my word in you
[2:25:37] then ask what you will there you are see
[2:25:39] but the word got to abide in
[2:25:42] here if it don't the shower Falls and
[2:25:45] why it can't produce because you don't
[2:25:49] believe it no matter how much you
[2:25:51] profess to believe it you've got to
[2:25:53] believe it all
[2:25:57] right so Israel God Called Moses out and
[2:26:01] said I'm going to destroy the whole
[2:26:02] nation just step aside Moses interceded
[2:26:06] throwed himself in the Bree what caused
[2:26:09] him to do that it was Christ in Moses it
[2:26:12] was the nature of God in Moses you see
[2:26:15] God would have killed the whole world
[2:26:16] one time for sin but Christ throwed
[2:26:18] himself in the breach for the whole
[2:26:21] human race hello Moses thr himself in
[2:26:24] the bridge for Israel and he said you
[2:26:26] made a promise God you made a
[2:26:29] promise aren't you glad that Moses knew
[2:26:32] his
[2:26:33] God aren't you glad Moses knew how to
[2:26:36] deal with his God aren't you glad Moses
[2:26:39] wasn't afraid to talk to his
[2:26:41] God I'm glad he wasn't afraid that God
[2:26:44] was going to make him a a piece of
[2:26:46] dust he said now I'm just here to remind
[2:26:48] you God here you said they're all going
[2:26:51] to go down you said you made us a
[2:26:53] promise that you would take them that's
[2:26:56] right I hope you're hearing this to the
[2:26:59] land yes he said that's right what did
[2:27:01] Moses do to God when looked like God was
[2:27:04] going to do something
[2:27:11] contrary I don't believe he did it with
[2:27:13] a hearty spirit I believe he did it with
[2:27:16] great faith and reverence he just said
[2:27:18] here it is God read it for yourself
[2:27:21] your word said you were going to take
[2:27:22] these
[2:27:24] people you promised that you were going
[2:27:26] to take these people the promis now if
[2:27:28] you want to kill them
[2:27:30] all knowing what you
[2:27:39] promised he throw the word in his way
[2:27:43] amen
[2:27:45] amen oh I love that now I feel like
[2:27:47] shouting just talking about it put the
[2:27:49] word in the
[2:27:51] way God won't walk over his own
[2:27:55] word lay the word out there you can't
[2:27:57] come any closer you rotten dirty devil
[2:28:00] you can't get over the
[2:28:02] word and God's not going to step over
[2:28:04] his word as though he would disregard it
[2:28:07] or ignore it said you promised to do it
[2:28:10] you said you'd take them to a good land
[2:28:12] that was flowing with milk and
[2:28:14] honey I've told them what you
[2:28:17] said and here we are
[2:28:24] we're on your
[2:28:26] hands God said I'll take that stubborn
[2:28:29] bunch and let them R in the wilderness
[2:28:31] and he
[2:28:32] did but I'll take them children of
[2:28:35] theirs that they said they wouldn't go
[2:28:37] anywhere they'd perish in the wilderness
[2:28:40] and I will take them
[2:28:45] over that's
[2:28:47] right no matter what kind of pressure
[2:28:50] gets put on us by other churches and
[2:28:52] other groups and other folks and
[2:28:53] families and other believing churches
[2:28:55] and so forth Etc we must never get
[2:28:59] caught
[2:29:00] up in the arguments of a generation that
[2:29:03] have rotted in the wilderness
[2:29:06] anyway speaking
[2:29:09] symbolic we've got to we've got to focus
[2:29:11] on a generation that said this has
[2:29:13] nothing to do your
[2:29:14] age this is not your age so don't think
[2:29:17] it is if you're thinking age you've
[2:29:19] missed this if you think when we're
[2:29:20] saying young we mean young age-wise we
[2:29:23] don't we mean a generation that thinks
[2:29:27] differently than those who said we can't
[2:29:31] we're looking for somebody that says we
[2:29:33] can we don't care if they're 87 or
[2:29:37] eight it doesn't matter to us their age
[2:29:40] we're looking for somebody that says if
[2:29:42] God said we
[2:29:45] can we
[2:29:48] can if God said that we can defeat our
[2:29:51] enemies we'll just make them a
[2:29:54] snack

[2:33:27] said we can't take
[2:33:32] it and you know what happened it cost
[2:33:35] them another lap or two around the
[2:33:39] mountain that's
[2:33:41] judgment the prophet said judgment
[2:33:43] strikes at Kadesh Baria that's where the
[2:33:46] rubber meets the road that's where you

[2:34:04] something it'll cost you something the
[2:34:06] great mistake they made when they got to
[2:34:08] the land looked over in the promised
[2:34:09] land they said we can't take it what was
[2:34:11] the other 10 they looked at the
[2:34:13] circumstances The Prestige they would
[2:34:16] lose we're grasshoppers to the side of
[2:34:19] them
[2:34:20] but Joshua and
[2:34:22] Caleb what did they do Church they
[2:34:26] checked
[2:34:27] up they
[2:34:29] went back to the word back to the word
[2:34:33] and the Lord said I'll give you this
[2:34:37] land it's a good land flowing with milk
[2:34:41] and honey they didn't count what it look
[2:34:44] like amen what this was and what this
[2:34:46] evidence was God said I give it to you
[2:34:50] go get it and they were the only ones
[2:34:52] that went
[2:34:54] in a whole generation of people had to
[2:34:57] die on this side of the
[2:34:59] Wilderness so that a new generation of
[2:35:02] people could be let in and the and the
[2:35:04] scripture tells us in in uh Deuteronomy
[2:35:07] and I'll read it to you the next time
[2:35:08] we're together maybe or at least next
[2:35:11] Sunday he said only
[2:35:15] Caleb because he had another spirit
[2:35:21] he was part of the same
[2:35:23] generation but he had another
[2:35:26] Spirit something was a hold of him that
[2:35:28] said yes I
[2:35:31] can yes I
[2:35:33] can he said that's right oh let us check
[2:35:36] the promises of God for today that's

[2:35:40] time in Exodus this time not into a
[2:35:42] Promised Land of the Earth but into a
[2:35:44] promised land of glory where there's no

[2:35:47] to be there will you you do
[2:35:53] it I don't mean no

[2:37:01] little authority over you
[2:37:05] somewhere even if you're the top of the
[2:37:07] ladder you're the top of the food chain
[2:37:09] in a big Corporation other corporations

[2:38:12] whole race this whole journey is to try
[2:38:15] to keep you afraid of something higher
[2:38:18] than you
[2:38:21] and there's only one thing that's higher
[2:38:22] than you that's God the
[2:38:25] word in its completeness and
[2:38:27] fullness so everything else has to
[2:38:30] magnify be magnified in your eyes that's
[2:38:33] the way the enemy works on the
[2:38:34] emotions you keep looking at the mole
[2:38:38] hill just a little dirt you know down
[2:38:41] here like this you keep looking at the
[2:38:42] mole hill and guess what like granny
[2:38:45] used to say you've made a mountain out
[2:38:47] of a mole hill that's what happen when
[2:38:49] you look at it when you focus on it when
[2:38:51] you place your attention on it it just
[2:38:53] gets bigger and bigger and bigger and

[2:46:57] title was oh yes you can and I think I
[2:46:59] showed you why you can because God made

[2:47:05] on him it's not my ability my strength
[2:47:08] my smarts my good looks for sure that's
[2:47:11] going to get me through it's because of
[2:47:13] what he is and what he has
[2:47:16] done that we're able so it's always him
[2:47:20] it's always him it's always him but but
[2:47:24] he knows he knows what he can do you've
[2:47:26] got to keep that in your mind and you've
[2:47:28] got to understand that we are more than
[2:47:32] conquerors through Christ Jesus and you
[2:47:36] may have to tell yourself sometime oh
[2:47:38] yes I can because he did oh yes I can
[2:47:43] because he said right we could wipe some
[2:47:47] negativity out of our vocabul ulary
[2:47:49] focusing on him couldn't we let's sing
[2:47:51] it one more time this time with an
[2:47:53] emphasis in knowing he's the mighty
[2:47:55] conqueror he's the one that makes it a a
[2:47:58] possibility it makes it a a a more than
[2:48:01] a possibility makes it reality because

[2:49:43] a Lord we thank you that you are more
[2:49:46] than able you are more than a conqueror
[2:49:50] and you've made us that there's not a
[2:49:53] situation that we face that you've not
[2:49:56] already laid hold of the victory on our
[2:49:59] behalf so your Victory is our Victory
[2:50:02] your Resurrection is our Resurrection
[2:50:05] yes your overcoming is our overcoming so
[2:50:09] Lord right now as a body of Believers we
[2:50:12] look at you we look at you with eyes of
[2:50:15] Faith with spiritual eyes around this
[2:50:18] altar we look to the Lord we look to
[2:50:20] your word we cannot deny that there are
[2:50:24] obstacles in the way we cannot deny that
[2:50:27] there are hindrances in our way but when
[2:50:30] we see you they get smaller and smaller
[2:50:34] and smaller before us because you make a
[2:50:37] way where there is no
[2:50:40] way you've said to us yes you can and so
[2:50:44] we say to ourselves oh yes I can Lord if
[2:50:48] you you had enough confidence in us to
[2:50:51] call us to this journey then you surely
[2:50:54] have placed within us the seeds of
[2:50:56] destiny that we need to overcome in life
[2:51:00] to not have to depend on pills but our
[2:51:04] faith in you gets us through Lord I do
[2:51:07] not believe that it is your will for us
[2:51:09] to have to depend on man for our
[2:51:12] overcoming I believe you have made a way
[2:51:15] Lord help our faith Let It Grow
[2:51:19] oh God let let us have your faith let us
[2:51:23] have your faith let that super sense of
[2:51:26] Faith be upon us so that we can take you
[2:51:29] at your word no matter what the reports
[2:51:32] are Lord we choose to believe your word
[2:51:35] right now would you just lay your hand
[2:51:37] on someone near you and let's just pray
[2:51:40] over one another father we pray for each
[2:51:43] other in the mighty name of Jesus we may
[2:51:46] not know the depth of the problem we may
[2:51:49] not know the depth of the battle we may
[2:51:51] not know the depth of the enemy that
[2:51:53] this one is facing but Lord we know who
[2:51:56] you are we know the bigness of our God
[2:51:59] and we know your ability to help us
[2:52:01] overcome in every situation of life
[2:52:04] you're the Healer you're the provider
[2:52:06] you're the deliverer you're the Savior
[2:52:08] you're the way maker Lord we come to you
[2:52:12] right now on behalf of our brothers and
[2:52:14] sisters in this house and those
[2:52:16] streaming this service right now now we
[2:52:19] lift up our faith we join our faith with
[2:52:22] yours and we believe oh
[2:52:26] God that our Giants are
[2:52:29] shrinking that our enemy will drown in
[2:52:32] the waters of our praise and that we
[2:52:35] will
[2:52:37] metaphorically we will eat Giants for
[2:52:40] our bread they will not stand in our way
[2:52:44] of inheriting the bridal promises that
[2:52:47] you have made to us as our inheritance
[2:52:50] so Lord we don't look at the addiction
[2:52:53] we don't look at the compulsion we don't
[2:52:56] look at the
[2:52:58] predisposition we look at the bigness of
[2:53:01] our way maker right
[2:53:03] now and we say yes I
[2:53:06] can yes I
[2:53:09] can we don't look at the hopelessness
[2:53:12] that the enemy has tried to sew into our
[2:53:15] life that prevailing sadness that tries
[2:53:19] to follow us like grief we choose right
[2:53:22] now not to look at that but to look at
[2:53:24] the
[2:53:25] comforter the Holy Ghost in US is our
[2:53:28] comforter and we look to him right now
[2:53:31] to find comfort in every uncomfortable
[2:53:33] and painful situation you're the Mighty
