Description:
In the Old Testament God was very specific on how He wanted His dwelling place built and gave detailed instructions on how everything was to be structured. We believe that He no longer dwells in tents and temples but His desire is to inhabit a people, the Bride of Christ, and that she follow His divine pattern for how He wants His “temple” built today!

blessing to you so be sure to visit revive i.org I want to thank you for tuning in to the broadcast we're going to continue our study today that we started the last time we were together about God's pattern discovering God's pattern for our lives in this hour and uh I pray that something will be said today that will bless you and encourage you and help you along the way amen so let's get right back to the word of God we were in Exodus chapter 25: 8 and9 let me read that again for you to refresh your memory and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them imagine that God wanted to dwell among men he had had very intimate fellowship with Adam in the cool of the evening in the Garden of Eden but now many years had come and gone and now God said I want to have Fellowship again this time I have two million people that I want to meet with I want to dwell among and in order to do that he was giving Moses these instructions about making a tabernacle a sanctuary that I may dwell among them and then in verse n according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it I like the fact that God was specific enough and and it must have been a great comfort to Moses to know that he was not only going to be given this huge task of creating a sanctuary on the earth for God to dwell in but he was going to be given uh specific details and the pattern of how God wanted it to be constructed the reason why we're doing this study is we believe as we said earlier that the Bride of the Messiah the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is being prepared in this hour so that we might come into that special place of Oneness and fellowship with him that we might actually demonstrate his character and his anointing and his authority in the earth and in order to walk with him in that kind of surrender uh that kind of Oneness it it becomes imperative that we discover what God expects out of us what he desires to be present and active in our life and even the things that he he wants us to refrain from the things that he wants us to stay away from so that we can better reflect who he is and so I think in order to to move into that we have to establish the fact that from the beginning God has been meticulous from the beginning God God has been uh very picky about what he wanted and how he wanted things to be carried out and even constructed in the earth when we left you on the Last Broadcast we were talking about the four reasons why there was a need for the Tabernacle or the mishon in the wilderness number one it was so that God might dwell among his people and we finished with number two last week so that God might teach his people of his Holiness you see God didn't just want to be a God above his people far away in the Starry Sky uh so that they would have to guess and wonder and Marvel about his Holiness he wanted to come down with his manifested presence and teach his people I I think that's so wonderful that God cares so much about his people that he wants to teach us of his ways and his Holiness is something that still baffles our mind how how he is so holy and so pure and so righteous and how you and I fall so short and yet he invites us to come and learn of his Holiness and partake and participate in his righteousness all the righteousness that we can muster up in our human effort is still just like filthy rags in the sight of such a holy God but when we learn how to reach in by the spirit and access his Holiness then we become like a mirror we become a reflection a reflective purpose uh of the glory and the Holiness and the righteousness of God in the earth and when people look into us like looking into a mirror they will begin to see God reflected they will begin to see the character and the nature the compassion and the loving kindness of god let's face it I don't think there's enough of that on display in any of our lives but as we mentioned before there's a precious work that's going on on the inside of the inside of every believer in this hour and we don't have a lot of time left in this preparation process so don't be surprised if things get heated up in your life don't be shocked if things around you seem to become disheveled if they seem to become a little bit chaotic and if you find yourself pulled or even driven to your knees please understand that it's God's perfect way he's bringing us to a place of total surrender and perfect submission to his perfect will and even the thing things that are going on in the earth we just finished a series here on the eagle cry about the birth Pains of the Messiah and what we see going on around us in the world um for us it it's like a time uh post it's like a signpost uh it it it's like a clock to remind us what time it is it's time for the bride to arise and shine it's time for the overcoming Remnant to begin to to uh stand up and be counted for the kingdom of God and to be usable in the service of the Lord in this hour and so it all begins in Us by examining by by learning by discovering what God really wants to do in us and through Us in this hour so he wanted to teach his people of his Holiness and then number three so that God might teach his people of their sinfulness now this somebody said well I'm not sure exactly how this works well when we understand and begin to see the beauty of the Holiness of God uh it just stands to reason that when we look inward we see the contrast we see how holy he is and how Unholy we are how righteous he is how unrighteous we are and it it doesn't uh it doesn't come that way to discourage us or to defeat us it comes to remind us and to teach us that without him we could never make it you see I just couldn't get holy enough in my own works I have to access his Holiness his righteousness as I said just a moment ago so when we see how holy he is and how Unholy we are in this life without the help of the Holy Spirit we begin to get a picture of our dependence on him we're living in a society where people have become so independent and they don't want to depend on anybody and I don't need anybody I'm I'm smart enough and strong enough to get by on my own well I want to tell you mister you're not going to make it in this last hour without the help and the strength of the Living God I don't care how intelligent you are how smart you are how deep in Witchcraft and satanic power you are you're not going to be able to over come in this wicked hour that we're living in now and that which is approaching upon the Earth without the power of the holy spirit in your life without without understanding and reflecting uh the virtue of of the Living God without knowing um what it means to be connected to him and what it means to draw from his life and from his strength we're just not going to make it without about that connection in this hour and that's why if there's ever been a time to run to the lord it's now uh the Earth is shaking around us kingdoms are shaking and and natural calamities are increasing and we're living in the birth Pains of the Messiah let's run to God our creator let's repent of our sin let's turn our backs on false religion and the lies of Satan and let's embrace the word of God like never before let's dig into it in the time that we have left and pray diligently for the Holy Ghost to open this book to us so that we can understand and and really know what God wants to do with us in this short work of the end time that period of time where things will be extremely dark around us but the Bride of the Messiah will rise up in the midst of darkness and will accomplish some amazing uh unbelievable demonstrations of the power of God in the earth and uh it's going to be a contrast the best of times the worst of times uh the darker it gets out there the brighter it needs to be getting in here so God wanted to come down in the Tabernacle to dwell among his people to teach his people about his Holiness to teach his people of their sinfulness and he wanted to teach his people how to approach him with offerings some times called sacrifices in the in the older Covenant or in the King James uh translation I I should say of the Old Testament uh often referred to as sacrifices what these really were were offerings that were brought to God a system of of offering of worship of obedience of submission was set up with such minute detail so that the people would always know how to approach God and one of the lessons that people learned from the offering system was you don't approach God empty-handed you come with something you come before him with something and I'll tell you what the something is he's looking for now even more than your tithe even more than your offering or your gold or silver he's looking for you to come with an offering of a laid down life he wants you to bring to him the offering of of a sacrificed life a life that says I can't do anything without you I don't want to talk without you I don't want to walk without you I want to be a pipeline for God to be manifested upon the Earth in the last days that's the greatest offering that we could bring to the Lord in this hour is is a is a big Eternal yes with with no uh with no Clauses in the contract uh no no Wass uh no wiggle room is what we say sometime but just a life that's says if you said it I believe it if your word requires it I'm going to do it if your word tells me to stay away from it I'm going to run away from it with everything that is within me the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last days must discover God's pattern we must discover what God is looking for in our lives and we must become that and we must do it immediately because there's much Supernatural work to be done on the earth in this last hour I want us to quickly turn we've we've been in Exodus the second book of the older Covenant now I want us to turn clean over to the last book of the newer Covenant the book of the Revelation and I want us to go to Revelation chapter 11 I I want us to to read about uh a Visionary experience of John when he was caught up in to the heavenlies in verse beginning in verse one and there was given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and them that worship therein I want you to notice that he was to measure the temple of God he was to measure the altar in the temple of God and he was also to measure them that worship therein the people were also to be measured I want you to know that God is going to measure his people people in this last day and he's not going to do it by a Creed he's not going to do it by a Dogma he's not going to do it by some denominational system he's going to use another measuring device alog together and what is that it's his precious revealed word God is going to have a people who are measured by his word and when we read the word and we see see uh that there is a standard that has been set for us in how we ought to live our lives uh we need to quit trying to wiggle out we need to to quit trying to uh to get around the word of God and we need to just say Okay Lord life is short I was born for a purpose and and I'm just going to live by the book I'm just going to treat others like the scripture said and uh if there are things that are worldly that you're calling me away from I don't need them anyway um if there are things that you want me to do that I'm not doing and I read it in the word just give me the grace to do it now again please understand that our Salvation is not by works it's not by what we do or we do not do it's by Grace it's by faith we are not saved by works but we are saved unto Works which means the demonstration of our faith cannot be in any other Arena than in the arena of works how do we show our faith the New Testament talks about how do we demonstrate our faith how is our faith shown faith is demonstrated by our works our faith in the Messiah is displayed is demonstrated is manifested by our works so what kind of work should we have the works of God like those who came to Jesus and said what must we do that we might work the works of God that's not just about signs wonders and miracles that's about all the works of God the Redemptive works of God how we should redeem one another and love one another and pull one another in uh closer in this hour when the storms of life are raging all around us we need to Rally together with those of like Precious Faith Stand Together pray for our pastors pray for our leaders pray one for another the enemy has come down down Among Us with great wrath and he desires to destroy and to divide the body of Christ he wants to reak havoc in the kingdom of God but there is a little bride that is being prepared in this hour for her finest day a overcoming remnant of people who will step forth with the very word of God in their mouths and they will see Great and Mighty things accomplished on the earth some of which which like we read about in the acts of the Holy Spirit through the apostles now so uh notice back in Revelation chap 11 that uh John was given a re to measure like a rod and he was told to measure the temple The Altar and the worshippers but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they tread underfoot 4 and2 months and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,23 score days clothed in sackcloth this is the two witnesses uh that we read about in Zachariah uh these are the two olive trees verse four and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and it goes on to talk about the ministry of these two witnesses and and nothing would please me any more than to to read every bit of it to you because I I really appreciate this this language but let's just skip down to about verse 16 and the four and 20 Elders which sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped God saying we give thee thanks oh Lord God Almighty which art I I love that and was and art to come because thou has taken to thee thy great power and has reigned and and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the Dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the Saints and them that fear thy name small and great and should us destroy them which destroy the Earth and the temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his Temple the Ark of his Testament and there were Lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great ha so this gets really good as we as we read through these verses in Revelation 11 but what I want to focus on now is is as God gives this instruction to John he not only gives him the instruction to measure but he gives him a rod he gives him a measuring device he didn't say John you go find something to measure he gives him the proper measuring device and I want you to know that proper measuring device that has been given to us in this hour is the pure holy word of God that's how everything has to be measured not by the newspaper not by secular media the television not even by the church order not even by denominational Creed or Dogma but but it must be measured by the word of God now what does it mean to measure when we measure something it means to determine the dimensions of a particular something we want to know the length of it the width of it the height of it the breadth of it uh we want to ascertain the size the amount or the degree of something by using an instrument or device marked in standard units or by comparing it with an agreed standard and that's the problem today is everybody's using their own measuring stick and their own units of measurement to measure what a Christian what a child of God what a Believer is to be like in this hour and I just want to submit to you that it's not working so if if our little measuring rods and and yard sticks are no longer working why don't we go back to the original device of measurement back to the word of God this is God's uh design it's his desire if you want to know what pleases God uh you don't have to you don't have to to go to the prophet to hear what pleases God go to the word you don't even have to go to your pastor to discover what pleases God go to the word hopefully the true prophets of God and the true pastors of God are preaching to us breaking this bread of life down for us from the word but you've got the word of God you've got the standard of measurement and and we need to look to it and we need need to pray to the holy spirit of God to give us Revelation and understanding this word cannot be discerned with the natural mind it can only be discerned by the spiritual uh Mind by by thinking in that spiritual context and the only way we can do that is to do what the newer Covenant tells us and that's to put on the mind of Messiah try to take off the carnal secular mind of humanity and lay it aside and pick up the mind of the Messiah the mind of Christ and try to think his thoughts and if you if you get confused about how he would think about something where do we go to the word of God the word of God tells us what he thinks about the end time what he thinks about his bride what he thinks about those who despise Israel what he thinks about those who uh dare to raise a hand against the Jewish people or against his people all of his people around the world to discover God's mind is to is to discern the word and again that can't be done by education it can only be done by Revelation now God also measures to to determine Conformity to his pattern to his will and to his purposes God is very specific when he gives a pattern or a standard for something that he desires for instance in Genesis 6 verse 14-16 God gave specific dimensions specific measurements for the construction of Noah's Ark everything had to be by the Cubit to the Cubit to the letter no room for for fudging or smudging or stretching or shrinking it had to be exactly like God wanted it to be be in Exodus chap 25 and as we make our way through the next few chapters say up to about Exodus 31 God makes it extremely clear in meticulous detail about material and color choices of every item in the Tabernacle in the sanctuary that was to be built how according to the pattern what pattern the pattern that God showed Moses in Heavenly places when he was caught up in the spirit and each one of those items came with a color Choice with a material Choice uh whether it was AAA wood or or to be overlaid in gold and each one of those items also came with its own set of very detailed measurements um and it goes on I'm telling you when you get caught up in those measurements and those details you you read so from that we draw this conclusion that God is deeply concerned with the details of the place where he intends to dwell and he was going to come by his spirit and live where in the Tabernacle in the sanctuary the mishcon in the wilderness later in the temple and then later where first the Tabernacle then the temple and now where is it that God longs to dwell he longs to dwell in you and I and so if God is meticulous in his concern for detail about the Tabernacle and he is meticulous in his design and detail requirements for the temple what makes us think that we can live any way we want to live and name the name of the Lord and be righteous in his eyes what makes us think that we can get into bed with the world and and live like the world and dress like the world and smell like the world and and and be rotten like the world and still be the children of God I hear the spirit of God saying come out of her and be separate sayith the Lord God is looking for a people who will no longer partake in her sin in the sins of the world in the things of this life but those who will be holy before him we can't do it by ourselves our works are not enough we have to draw from the righteousness of God I want to pray for you right now father I'm asking you that your spirit will reach down into the home into the place of business wherever people may be watching this program right now that your Holy Spirit Will convict of sin and not only convict but give power to overcome and Grace to rise above the clutches and the bondages of sin Lord I pray that that addictions would be broken in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ that lives would be set free those who are bound by by uh sexual immorality those who are bound by by uh Lifestyles that are impure that are profane and Unholy I pray that you will reach out to the hurting right now by the power of the Holy Spirit and change every life for the glory of God I pray for the sick and the infirmed that you will Minister healing to them right now in the lovely name of our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I could feel the anointing in that prayer I pray that you could not only feel the anointing but that you allowed the Lord to begin a deep work in your life contact us at revival. org and let us know that that God's doing something good in your life tune in again next time to the eagle cry God bless you bye-bye for now [Music]
