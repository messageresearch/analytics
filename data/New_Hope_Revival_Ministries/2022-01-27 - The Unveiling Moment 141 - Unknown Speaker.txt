Description:
There has never been a more important time in our lives than now.  God wants to take us to higher levels of revelation, so we will produce His character, His attributes, His very Life in us.  Our response and reaction to His Word as we ponder and meditate, is so very important, because Jesus desires to live and finish His Endtime plan through us.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i've had a portion of scripture on my heart i just don't seem to be able to get it off my mind i brought it to the congregation here in alabama and i even traveled with it but i want to share it with you today it's a scripture where jesus is speaking about the word about what we hear and what we do with what we hear i know that all of us have heard amazing sermons preached from god's word many with power and with demonstration but i think it's very very important that we are not just hearers but we are also doers and i also believe that there are new levels of revelation and glory that god wants to give us personally as individuals as we engage the word that we hear as we go back and revisit and we pray we ask the lord father i want you by the holy spirit to open these passages of scripture up to my life and i want to understand with revelation how to apply them how i should react how i should respond to your word i believe the bible is a written record of god's word i believe that jesus christ is the living word of god i believe he lives in us by the power of the holy ghost and i believe that it is his desire to unveil his word to you and i personally we know that scripture is going to line up with scripture and we know that anything god speaks to us in this day in this hour it must fit the scripture perfectly but when i'm talking about receiving a personal revelation from the word i'm talking about that quickening life that comes from the inside when god unveils or opens up a scripture to us personally shows us how to use it how to apply it in our life the scripture is mark chapter 4 verses 23 and 24. i want to read it from the amplified version of the bible it says if any man has ears to hear let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend and he said to them be careful what you are hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who hear i'm thinking about all of the hours in my life that i have spent reading god's word or hearing god's word and i'm thinking about all of those missed opportunities that i've had along the way to let that word become real to me personally and individually i guess we've got a lot of making up to do here in the end time but i think there's never been a more important moment in our lives than now i believe it is right now that god wants to make his word a living reality to you and i as individuals this living word you see i believe that we need like never before a revelation of who our god is and then we need a revelation of of who we are in god once we receive and understand who god is and who we are in him then we can get a revelation of who he is in us if he's living in us if this is the life of jesus christ living in me then it will produce his character his attributes if i am truly bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and spirit of his spirit then through my life jesus desires to live to finish his end time plan i'm not just talking about reading the word or hearing the word but i'm talking about reacting to what we hear jesus said here the measure of thought and study do you do you go back and ponder meditate sometimes we use the word ruminate because of the sheep we study we pray we ask the lord to quicken his word and make it real to us and then we not only have a reaction but we have a response and our response has to be to mix the word of god with our faith because that's what activates it in your life
