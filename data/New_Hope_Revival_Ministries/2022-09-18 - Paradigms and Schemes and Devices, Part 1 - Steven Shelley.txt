under medication he's on medication right now he had a spider bite for last week that caused a lot of pain and swelling and he went all week without doing anything about it and waited a long time and finally did and had to have an antibiotic and some other something to help him and when we decided that we would ask him not that ben doesn't do ben does a marvelous job and i i said to benjamin yesterday i said i want us to make sure that we don't hurt ben in any way because ben is dependable i can depend on him and i don't i didn't want him to think uh that we were replacing him on second string but i just it just came to me yesterday morning as we were trying to navigate kind of an unexpected shift that the boys and jenna wouldn't be here today and trying to figure out and i said let's ask chad and don't just tell him there's no pressure but if he would like to and then i heard about this uh visit to the er and and i thought well surely he won't but you know he was willing he came in with clammy hands he came in nervous i said you don't have to be nervous you've done this many times before even though it's been several years now and i enjoyed it so much that wonderful familiar uh that the presence of god that has always come when chad would lead us so we are blessed today but i do want did want to honor ben and say thank you for being so faithful always and and we will depend on you as we did already this morning for for uh leading the service and you know i i just appreciate anybody and then anna christine she didn't have any forewarning just a few minutes before the service started but i just appreciated that she was willing to do it and when the musicians weren't sure she just played for herself and and god just moved and he blessed and this is what we we can expect when people have a desire to do something for god he comes and blesses and we're missing all of those who are not here today i hope that you have been praying for brother and sister greeley as they minister today and i think there's two services today so they're probably well into their first service but there'll be another service this evening in erie pennsylvania may god move and bless them and uh sister teresa texted yesterday to say they were leaving indiana on their way over to pennsylvania to be there today for the services and uh i know luke's parents are mighty glad and i think kathy and her husband do they go there too or they just live in there they go to church there too so he's got family there and i know that god is going to meet them today in a wonderful way but we miss them and all of those who are not here so many were reaching out that they need prayer and touches in their body and i could use one too but he's the great physician all we have to do is call on him he's always ready to help us and strengthen us amen and i know some people are looking for a reason not to be but i'm looking for a reason to be i'm looking for a reason to be here i want to be here it's my place my post of duty and precious brother paul drowned was texting he is such a help to us uh virtually and uh supports the preaching and i appreciate it so much and and he said i'm here he let me know i'm here at my post of duty and i sure appreciate that you can't be here right now physically but he's here with us spiritually and in the spirit and saying amen and you think it doesn't make a difference it's a faith pool it's a faith pull brother reed texts us this morning to say he would be streaming and wouldn't be able to be here with us today but but uh he will be pulling his faith will be pulling and god is good to us isn't he there's a few announcements that we need to make before we go to the word today and uh we always like to remember some of these folks on their birthday for no other reason to pray and lift them up and i saw where wesley miller has a birthday tomorrow so let's hold them up i think the miller family may be traveling toward toward toward maine i think it is that they're going to uh be having some family time there and then tuesday ben ellsworth is where he wanted to wish him a happy birthday he's hiding i can i can i can uh you know get him just as good as i can brag on him let's let's say happy birthday to ben may god bless him tuesday sister nakisha was coming to church today even though she's been fighting these headaches but with with sister audrey not feeling good with that arthritis and they watch her to make sure she doesn't fall and so nakisha wasn't uh able to come today but but tanaya's birthday is on tuesday too and we all love nya she's a special little girl around here so let's say happy birthday tanaya she's probably streaming the service we love her i see where the writers are streaming in south africa and so we happen to notice that saturday is sister rona's birthday so we will say happy birthday to sister rona let's send them our love in south africa today how about we save brother shelly from having to get all kinds of texts this week uh over what time the services are sometimes i feel like i'm church secretary and i don't mind doing that when i don't have anything else to do but that's usually only for a few hours when i'm sleeping that i don't have something else to do so if everybody i'm not trying to you know treat you like school children but you'd be surprised i sometimes become a phone book and and then somebody would say well when is so-and-so's birthday you know well i i can't always stop what i'm doing to figure that out but when i can i will but we are looking forward to a wonderful weekend coming up with brother dwayne jackson he has blessed us here before he was our youth weekend speaker last year and we felt like that we wanted him to come and and and he's just down to earth and just real and we just appreciated the fact that he came in worshiping you know he didn't come in like some grand speaker that couldn't worship with us but he came in worshiping with us and you know that that right there will cause the people to have confidence in the ministry when it comes because you're watching to see how people will enter right in to the spirit of the lord and both he and sister heather certainly do that and they're going to be coming with a a smile on their face and and so much to thank god for in the miracle birth of of little liam and we can't wait to meet him and uh so on friday evening this week there is a banquet for our younger people for young people there it's by invitation only meaning that we didn't invite a whole lot of extra parents and a whole lot of extra people because we're trying to do it as low budget as possible but it's not because we don't want you we wish we could just banquet with everybody but if we did then the young married couples would have to uh bring their children and this is one night out of the year that we can help uh make sure that they have something to go to and it's not there's no harm at all in them being away from their children just a few hours and thank you nannies and mimi's and aunties and whatever else for helping the kids come and dress up and i don't know why anybody would want to dress up like that but anyway they do and they enjoy doing it and so we come we'll be doing that on friday evening but everyone is invited to worship with us next saturday evening at seven o'clock and everyone is invited to come on saturday while the young people are uh playing ball and having fellowship with one another there'll be breakfast also a brunch uh in the morning and and the service at seven and we started a little bit later because it was real difficult to get everybody in here for six o'clock last time and since church is at 11 even if we go till midnight on saturday night we'll still be able to come into the house of the lord and hear what god is laid on brother jackson's heart for next sunday i'm looking forward to it i believe god's going to meet with us and i'm excited about that and then again camp meeting is october the 11th through the 16th it's unfortunate that brother brooks will not be able to be with us this year but we committed every bit of that to the lord we just gave it to god and we started praying and asking the lord what to do about someone else to come in and and to speak and we haven't gotten anything yet and it's getting right down to the to the nitty-gritty and uh but it's in the lord's hands he knows exactly what we need for that week and i wouldn't i wouldn't be disappointed if i were you because i'm very sure the lord will be here and i believe he's going to meet needs the lord reveals a theme to my heart he made it so real from psalm 66 5 it says come and see that's the theme for camp this year come and see the works of god he is awesome in his doing toward the sons of men how many of you can say amen so come and see i think i was reading from the new king james because that word terrible uh in the king james throws people off it it means awesome and full of power it doesn't mean terrible like a stomach ache how many of you know that so we have a lot to look forward to and then i'm going to be speaking in a meeting the end of october in north carolina and we'll let you know about that for any of you who might want to travel that weekend to be with some very old friends of ours we're looking forward to it in a place we've never ministered before but we believe that god's going to move and that will be the last weekend of october and it's about five and a half hours away something like that close to six hours away we'll give you more details later but we believe god's going to move in those meetings as well i had to clear the weekend with brother greeley to make sure that he would be here to preach for me and you know what he said he said what if i wanted to go i said well it's only five and a half hours away you can come friday night he said don't think i hadn't thought about it so uh if we if we all go if we all just go then we wouldn't even have to have a service here but we want that in god's hands whatever he wants let's thank the lord for the musicians god bless them bless them pour it on them lord let's stand ephesians chapter 2. god bless all of you streamers we see some who are the arnold's family from from france may god bless you all we love that family and this is some of their family i think and we're just so thankful to have them with us today ephesians chapter 2 are you ready for the word verse 15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace hold on i want you to look at this very carefully because this is a key to understanding how god is dealing with mankind in the end he's not dealing with with a group of people uh one way and another group of people another way he's making one new man the blood of jesus christ the blood of yeshua the messiah has made us one and we didn't come to this great work of redemption to be driven back to ordinances of men now the commandments of god that's one thing but modern judaism is corrupt i want you to understand that it's corrupt it's magical it's rooted in a lot of ugly stuff i was at the car wash i know you're standing i was at the car wash the other day with benjamin and and there was a boy there with a hamsa on his on his necklace and i thought to myself i said to benjamin i wonder if he even knows what that is it's sort of a charm that some of the jewish people wear those who are involved in kabbalah and i said he probably doesn't even know that he is attracting witchcraft spirits he just sees that and and sometimes people so long to be identified with the jewish people that they'll just do all kinds of things to try to identify themselves but this is serious business so we're not coming to judaism no god's not bringing us to that he's bringing us to his word and so just understand that the commandments of god are one thing the ordinances some of which could not be kept even in this hour because there's no temple so people really get hung up sometime and they miss what god is doing we we even have friends who uh who have come to the message and and now they think there's something so much more than the message of truth i want you to know something when god kept his word and sent an understanding and revelation of his word in the end time that's it we're not looking for a new revelation we're looking for more understanding of what god has already revealed don't get weak on me let's be strong in this so let's look at this carefully having abolished in his flesh because he fulfilled a whole lot of commandments in an ordinances by his flesh having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both this is jew and gentile unto god in one body hal by the cross having slain the enmity thereby religion is no longer there to divide the one new man and came and preached peace to you which were afar off how many of you know that's most of us most of us in the in the nations the the gentiles and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him listen through him no other way we both have access by one spirit unto the father oh that's good now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and what of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being what wow the foundation is apostles and prophets but the cornerstone the one who ties it all together the strength of the building is found in jesus christ if you believe that say amen and then a few more verses here in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord oh what a temple he's building in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit building up a people we are living stones we are lively stones we are the temple of the most high god do you believe that now before you're seated i know you're standing but before you're seated let's read just two verses 21 and 22 in the amplified watch this in him the whole structure is joined bound welded together can you all say that word harmoniously harmony [Music] like a song join together no ism no schism you understand no division what does division mean two visions one vision to lead us join together in christ not some special way made for one and another way for the other but joined together standing together built together harmoniously hallelujah in him the whole structure is joined bound welded together harmoniously and it continues to rise that's what i want you to know he's still building a holy habitation he's still building a holy temple continues to rise to grow to increase into a holy temple in the lord a sanctuary dedicated that's us that's not the building it's the building a sanctuary dedicated consecrated and sacred to the presence of the lord no wonder he can come no wonder his presence can fill this house because he's building a house here he's building a habitation here he's building a dwelling place here consecrated sanctified sacred to the presence of the lord dedicated as a witness and as a welcome to his spirit to come we want him we want him we're not going back to a dead letter we want him we want to live in christ we want a living word among us one who can do the same today that he did yesterday he's it goes on to say in him and in fellowship with one another no ism oh is there things that come up to divide us all the time then what was what must we do refuse we must refuse to be divided we refuse to be divided we refuse to let something divide us now in fellowship one with another you yourselves are being built up into this structure with the rest to form a fixed abode a dwelling place what house will you build me a to form a fixed abode a dwelling place of god in by through the spirit let me ask you how is god building a habitation and a temple to dwell in he's doing it by the spirit somebody said i thought it was by the word the word is a letter until the spirit breeds life you know that that's not taking away from the word the word must take preeminence among us but not the letter of the word the living reality of the word it's not the letter of the word that gives us a testimony it's the living reality of the word that gives us something to praise for are you with me father thank you right now that you are the living reality of the word you are the word and you are the living reality by the spirit of the word to each and every one of us we have not entered into religion we have entered into relationship and relationship is not by letter it's by spirit fellowship is not by regulation it's by the spirit so we welcome again and again and again and again the pure holy spirit of god to come and manifest himself in this house to lead us in the song to lead us in the worship to lead us in whatever direction the mind of god would take us for the rest of this service if the spirit of god should highlight someone who needs prayer let us be led let us have grace to follow that leadership let nothing divide let nothing cause division or for fellowship to be broken but may god just come and build us together lord may we find victory over the battle of the mind and we will give you glory and honor and praise for the church of jesus christ said what amen you may be seated this is why winning the mind battle is so important because the mind battle comes to accomplish two things it comes to separate you from christ and it comes to separate you from one another you see he comes to divide us from christ to isolate us from the reality of the word he comes also this mind battle this this enemy who comes to march against our mind and our thoughts he comes to divide us from god to separate us from our origin you see i came from god you understand that don't you and i'm going back to god if the enemy can separate me from my origin he separates me from my daily existence and so my relationship with christ if my relationship with christ is broken i'm no longer i'm no longer overcoming anything in fact i'm barely getting by i'm barely surviving i don't even know if you could call me a survivor once i'm separated from my life i'm withering on the vine i'm preaching to you this morning don't you wither on the vine hello stay connected to christ no matter what it costs you no matter what you have to put aside maybe your pride you have to lay pride aside maybe you have to reorder the priorities of your life maybe you have to put feelings aside remember brother branham tells us what does feelings have to do with it how many of you know that people can't talk without telling you how they feel well i feel well i feel well i feel well i feel well i feel you know you ought to just shock them sometime and you ought to just say what's feeling got to do with it somebody said i don't feel worthy what's feeling got to do with it somebody said i don't feel well i feel sick what's feeling got to do with it i don't feel like an overcomer what's feeling got to do with it it's a promise from the father i tell you man will lie to you but the word will never lie it'll never lie to us it'll stand when the world is on fire your carnal mind will make excuse for allowing the enemy to separate you from your origin oh he'll justify the enemy will justify everything he's a great sophist the prophet tells us he's a great arguer he knows how to argue he knows how to present his case he knows how to persuade us come on now but we've got to possess the reins of our mind i'm going to possess the reins of my mind i will not allow satan to be in control of the reigns of my mind how many of you know whoever's got the horse's reigns that's the one that's directing the horse if satan has the reins of your mind he is directing you that's just simple you seem kind of uh intent i am i feel a little intense i feel a little intense i feel like there's a battle going on how many of you how many of you slept like a baby last night let me see your hand where'd you come from i knew if i did it the other way around i might i might i might influence your answer so i wanted to get those of you who slept like a baby and i'm so thankful that you were not on watch you got to rest but i didn't have that pleasure last night how many of you get a night sometime where it's just like a a night of naps just every five minutes and you you look at your watch and you say my lord have mercy it's only been four minutes your door's off and you wake up and you think whoa i've slept two hours you look 10 minutes well that was my night last night and i knew and i said to my wife and the first thing my wife asked me every morning or if i get a chance i ask her first thing in the morning while we're still in bed did you rest well last night and when she asked me i you know sometimes you don't tell her exactly like it is and she said did you did you rest well last night i said no i did not did you she said no i did not i said it felt like a night of naps i knew when i woke up this morning and could hardly wake up because i just napped through the night now it's time to get up and your body thinks it's time to sleep you've been there how many of you had that kind of night last night let me see your hand sometimes it's what you ate you can't make everything spiritual but since they serve thai food in heaven i know it wasn't my thai food that did it to me i knew that there was something else going on and so it made me a little intense it made me mad i tell you i'm mad i'm not mad at anybody i'm not mad at anybody here i'm not mad at anybody streaming this service i'm mad at the enemy because i know that he is slick and sly and he's trying to divide us from our source of life and then he wants to divide us from one another and sometimes he does it in another order sometimes he tries to divide us from each other and then he tries to cut off our source of life we must make up our mind that we're a part of a building that's being fitly framed and joined together i tell you what i delight i delight in the thought of making the enemy's plans and plots fail what you have meant to do to divide or to hinder or to keep us defeated and discouraged and depressed in every trick that you have tried to play on us i rejoice in knowing that you will ultimately be defeated and the bride of jesus christ will continue to grow up into that holy temple dedicated consecrated set apart for the sacred to the presence of the lord so you can huff and puff and try to blow the house down but what you don't remember sometime is it's built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets the bride will stand she will stand she's built on the word and the lord jesus christ is the chief cornerstone holding it locking it all together so you tell the devil you're going to possess the reigns of your own mind boy i almost shocked some of you just a minute ago i almost said something i'd have regretted later i caught myself sometimes i feel like asking this question i'll clean it up i got your attention now don't i i'll clean it up for you sometime i just like to ask people whose donkey are you just just think about it a minute hmm you getting it who's who's driving you around who's riding on your back how long are you going to give him a saddle to ride in how long are you going to surrender the reins of your own mind to the one that's out to destroy you make up your mind today i'm going to possess them myself i'm not on a runaway train i'm not on a runaway donkey i'm not riding i'm not a runaway horse no siree i'm a thoroughbred and when that word goes forth i know exactly what i must do to line myself up with that are you ready all right now i want us to go here uh let me find the place where i want us to jump in we're we're we've covered paradigms pretty good would you go to slide 31 and uh that's probably in paradigms i'm not 100 sure yes that's it now these are different than what we have had in the past so it's gonna be a little bit harder for you to see all of that it is for me anyway so let's look at this quote accept god's gift tallahassee florida he said now healing is not something that you just say well i believe it i believe it now that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say well yes i see it i believe that i accept it then if you accept it on those basis you've got to accept it first god said i'm going to give you total deliverance total deliverance god said i'm going to heal your body god said i'm going to give you a mind that is sound how many of you believe you can have a sound mind in a crazy world don't leave me stay with me you've got to accept that truth you've got to believe that truth that's the a the b and then you've got to be willing to confess that truth and here's how brother branham tells us that we will confess it remember remember that a paradigm is something that is formed by a repetitious pattern of thought you keep thinking it over and over and over again until it molds you into a paradigm and repetition is how it got built and repetition is how we're going to tear it down that's what brother branham's talking about here in just a moment he said what you you accept it on those bases you keep saying it over and over he said say it out loud now i want to tell you there's power in that there's power in that brother brandon wasn't a neuroscientist but i tell you what he had some spiritual insight to how the mind and the brain work and it's not enough to say it inside it's not enough to say it to yourself did you know that every cell in your body is created to respond to the sound of your voice when god created you he tuned your body to your voice not mine not mine not your husbands not your wives he tuned your body your voice and your body together every cell in your body responds to the sound of your voice that's why as we mentioned tuesday night we cannot say this headache is killing me because we throw every cell in our body into a panic wait a minute brother shelly you you you seem to be indicating that even a cell has intelligence it does every cell in your body has a brain now we're saying this figuratively but scientifically it has a memory and in order for a cell to have a memory it has to have the ability to retain a thought are you with me and so when we speak words of chaos every cell in our body is covered by a wash of chaos but when we speak words of life every cell in our body must respond to that life because it's the word of the creator we're speaking that's why it's not just the power of positive thinking it's the power of thinking the word it's not just the power of speaking something positive it's the power of speaking the word because when you were created remember what your origin was you were once a thought in the mind of god when god expressed you he spoke you so you are a product of a thought that became a spoken word is that right and so when you were created thus every cell in your body has the ability to respond to the sound of your voice so it's not enough for your wife to say you're healed honey you're healed you're healed you've got to begin to confess that over your own body anybody with me brother branham said keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over i'm just quoting he said just keep saying i'm healed i'm healed say it until actually you believe it how many of you get that see you're first saying it because you know you're supposed to you know it works you've got a mental concept that there's power in what i confess over my own body you got that but the more you begin to say it the more your faith attaches to it and when your faith attaches to it your cells start responding oh yes how many of you know that's how cancer works in the body it affects one cell it doesn't have to find a clump of cells it can form a tumor later it just finds one it finds a weak cell one that's already in the process of dying because our cells die often and they are we we have new cells created in our body all the time including brain cells did you know for thousands of years the world did not believe in epigenetics the scientists did not believe that you could develop a better brain than the one you were born with they believe that you were absolutely bound to live with the thinking capacity that you were born with but through the science of epigenetics they begin to understand that not only can you begin to change and expand your ability to think clearly there is no limit to what you can contain because as you begin to ask the spirit of god to expand you and i tell you i'm already at the age where i'm asking him lord i need new brain cells healthy brain cells charged with the life of jesus christ i want a brain that's always growing and a mind an ability to remember and an ability to speak and an ability to have clarity clarity and and we're doing that we're literally now we see scientifically it's possible the word is always said it was god spoke to the prophet before people were even understanding what epigenetics was so you've got a little bride here on planet earth that's beginning to speak to her circumstances remember what he said in that authority of the spoken word you would be able to create a world he said step out into it and inhabit that world well really that's what we're doing we're actually trying to do that even now you follow what i'm saying because we look around at our circumstances and we see how adverse they are and we begin to reject them i'm not going to live in depression all my life i'm not going to live addicted to food all my life i'm not going to live addicted to this all my life i'm not going to be under this all my life we begin to speak those things and mean them and we say them based on the word not just because it's a good positive thought we begin to say it based on the word what the word said the living word not the letter the living word which is the truth that the spirit is in because we worship god not only in truth but we worship god in spirit also isn't that wonderful oh that's why worship is so important because every time you worship you're brought into the presence of your creator every time you connect with god in the atmosphere of his anointing you are brought one you're made one again you're coming into oneness again with him and everything that he is it's like it's like taking your head off and putting his head on your shoulder it is and everything that he is begins to flow through the veins of your body and your mind and your every every capillary the the very life of jesus christ listen this is what changed abraham this is what changed sarah's body if god can bring a children of israel dropping group bellyaching and complaining if he can bring them through a wilderness and there was not one sick among them what do you think he ought to be able to do with the people that are living under the restored word hello somebody said well we're not seeing it yet are you going to wait to jump aboard when you see it are you going to take it by faith and do what he tells us to do and you're just going to start speaking what the word said i'm so depressed i can hardly live even if it's the truth be careful how it comes out of your mouth because your subconscious mind doesn't know when you're joking so your cells receive whatever it is that you're speaking over the only thing you can do is reprogram by truth which is did you know that brain i don't want to get into this but did you know that brain scientists tell us that thoughts that have become deeply embedded and ingrained in the real estate of our brain did you know that thoughts like like neurons and dendrites they become permanent they take a permanent spay a thought can take up permanent space in your brain in the form of a dendrite and did you know that every time you revisit that thought it's like a tree caroline uh uh says what's your last name leif she says that every time you visit that thought again it's like adding growth it literally expands but did you know that god has made you better than a supercomputer and you also have the ability to cause a thought to leave your brain real estate by refusing to revisit that again and again and again that eventually with no brain activity and no neurons flowing through it it will leave your brain somebody said you couldn't prove it by me do you know why because we keep revisiting those things we keep going back to those things over and over and over again i'm just looking around i'm missing some folks in the service i'm wondering he said just keep saying i'm healed i'm healed say it until you actually believe it and when you believe it then it's going to take place don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess well i still feel bad today i guess you go right straight back in the same rut how many of you respect what he's telling us you go back to the same rut that you was in the beginning there's not a man or woman in here that's baptized with the holy spirit but what would start your confession i believe i've lost the holy spirit who would say such a thing who would say such a thing i believe i've lost the holy spirit i believe it's gone from me he said you'll go right down don't ever say it well what do i do if i feel like the holy spirit is is leaving me or draining out of me or i need a refilling of the holy ghost you run here you run up here to worship the lord and you say fill me up i want to be plugged in i want to be recharged by your spirit of but don't ever say don't ever say don't ever let it come out of your mouth he said there's no no holy ghost-filled christian that would make that kind of a profession would come up here and say the holy ghost is gone from me now in the message why are you ready to move on he said now bow your heads you may not have this one it just dawned on me i don't have a slide number here so you may not have it but i'm going to oh you do all right i probably picked it up a little bit further down let me see make sure that's it um i don't know if that's it or not but i'll start reading and if you find if you if you see that i'm reading the same you you can flash that one up he said now bow your heads paragraph 29 if you will it's a mental nervousness the woman asked this is a woman in a prayer line should i believe when i feel like i'm dying all the time this is this is what what the woman is saying should i believe when i feel like i'm dying all the time listen if you think i'm making fun of someone for feeling that way i'm not i know what it means and you do too to feel like you're dying sometime but she's asking brother graham and he said it's see you you must believe regardless of anything see you you never go to your feeling you go to your faith you could read this on your phone if you want to find it paragraph 29 of the authority of the word what did i call it i called it why that's the reason i look down at the next one this is the authority of the word to see if you have that you must believe you never go to your feeling you go to your faith he said there's where you're you're lacking of it sister i i want you to be well see but but it's a mental disturbance all the time i want you to hear me now he said you must just keep saying thank you lord for my healing thank you lord how you feeling wonderful thank god for my healing just keep on like that you'll get well he said see what i mean that's where you climb up over the rifles there it's a battle you've got to fight for you have victory you see he said lord bless this woman who i lay hands on and say to this evil spirit you're exposed god rebuke thee in the name of his son christ jesus may you leave the woman come out of her and may she go and be well in heaven grant this blessing god in heaven grant this blessing through christ jesus he said look raise up your feet now and say thank you lord raise up my hands and say thank you lord now i'm feeling fine see that's it all right go on off the platform walk on off yourself go on stand there let he said this sometimes evil spirits want to hold on it's left to the people's faith they have to leave in the presence do you hear what's going on in the prayer line that he he's just cast the enemy out leave this woman and torment her no longer and brother branham is now saying it matters how she goes down it matters how she goes away he said they have to leave in the presence that's true but when they get away they'll return you see if the patient can have enough faith to take it the thing away itself much the better all right now do you know what what brother brahm is telling us here he's saying i can cast the spirit that originates this kind of trouble i can cast that out she's got to go out now in the presence of the lord and this will be a whole lot more effective if she drives the thing out of her life you caught that didn't you see you you can't just depend on the preacher you're going to have a daily grind of keeping that paradigm ripped down keeping that thought process ripped down and submitted to the blood of jesus christ paragraph 82 of the message why he said now mean it in your heart just keep saying it over and over say if you don't believe it all together keep saying it until you believe it how many of you your mind struggles a little bit and you say well i can't lie it's no lie you're not telling a lie you're telling what the word said it's no lie to say what the word said it's right to say what the word said he said just keep saying it over i thank you lord for my healing because what is he christ is the high priest of our confession i wish we could put this one up i wish you could okay good thank you i'm sorry i didn't have the number i want you to find it go down to the highlights can you see the highlights down there at the bottom just above that it says hebrews 3 all right he's the high priest of our confession then he cannot do one thing for you he cannot do one thing for you can make no intercession until first you confess that it's done i know i've preached this before and some of you certainly know this but i'm wondering if some of you that have recently joined us if you've ever come across this or not because this can be life-changing his responsibility is to confess before the father every need that we have we have a great high priest who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities he is our great confessor brother branham calls him that he stands in intercession declaring our need in the presence of the spirit of eternal god but here brother branham tells us he cannot do one thing for you he can make no intercession until first you confess that it's done he said now is that scriptural he said hi priest of our confession then he can only act i'm not trying to push something over on you i want you to think on in a moment then he can only act when we do what now we confess all day long we're always saying something how many of you would would shudder in the thought that your confessor your intercessor is standing in the presence of the eternal spirit of god declaring what you're saying here on earth think about some of the things we say shall i give you a list somebody said no i just happen to have a list just a moment hallelujah what did i do with it it's here it's here it's here it's coming to you will i ever find where i was i don't know about that it's coming it's coming these are the ants these are some of the automatic negative thoughts just a moment i am really in a sweat we're in the battle let me say up front to every cell of my body i am not confessing this over my own life i'm giving you an example of some negative self-talk and automatic negative thoughts that people say if our intercessor if our confessor is standing in the presence of the eternal spirit of god saying in heaven what we say on earth can you imagine some of these things being said we better work on our confession is anybody following me i'm such an idiot i can't believe i'm so stupid you've never said that have you we've probably felt that way before but it's nothing to confess we're wasting our confessor when we say things like that we have the privilege of declaring things in the presence of the eternal spirit of god we've got one who has dedicated himself as an intercessor and as a confessor and he's only moving based on our confession so he certainly cannot confess these things in the presence of the father and this makes up a lot of what we say in the course of a day he's not only do we say i'm such an idiot i can't believe i'm so stupid he's such an idiot i can't believe he's so stupid i can't believe she's so stupid this is terrible this is horrible i can't stand this i should be able to handle this other people can he or she makes me so mad he or she is never there when i need him never there when i need her i can't believe this is happening to me my upbringing and my past prevent me from loving or trusting people things never go right for me some people confess i believe in murphy's law if anything can go wrong it'll go wrong for me you know why it's so quiet people can't change just a leopard can't change his spots people can't change i'm useless i'm no good i'm bad i'm a failure i'll never get another job i'm not a good mom i'm not a good dad even if you are don't ever say it even if you feel that way don't confess that i'm yielding to the best papa there's ever been i'm yielding my my will my ability my my my strength i'm yielding all of that to the one who knows how to make me the best daddy the best mama don't say i'm worthless don't people say everybody else is better than i am i could never do that i'm not a nice person i heard someone recently say not too far from me right now i could hit you between the eye with a songbook duck i've heard someone recently say i'm not a nice person now what kind of a confession is that i'll never be any good it's always my fault nobody likes me i'm not popular i can't cope why do things like this always happen to me this is the worst thing that could have ever happened i'll never be able to learn anything i'll never get better i'm not bright enough the worst always happens to me this won't work out i'm afraid to get excited because things never work out for me i never get things right the list goes on and on and on these are the kinds of things that we confess on a weekly basis we say things like this will never get any better my job situation will never get any better we say that and when we do the confessor is silent he can't speak those kinds of things in the presence of the eternal spirit of god what kind of heaven would it be if he was constantly confessing those things through eternity so he's confessing nothing before the father on your behalf you have the ability to begin to come into agreement with god's word somebody said i don't even know where to start you can start right here i am not what i ought to be i am not what i want to be but i am not what i used to be by the grace of god [Music] see that say that see i have every intention of growing in the grace and knowledge of jesus christ am an overcomer [Applause] who posted that list was that sister beverly reposted a list of confessions and affirmations on her facebook you ought to read them all i gave you a list one time of confirmations and affirmations that you can speak over your own life oh that sounds like new age oh that sounds like hocus pocus no it sounds like somewhere in the heavenlies there's an intercessor there's a confessor standing on your behalf nobody ever understands me i'm always so misunderstood you want to say that would you really want jesus to confess that before the throne is that something you want to fill the heavens with whoo so we are obligated to put the reins in his hands we cannot allow the enemy to drive us by old paradigms and thought processes we must confess the truth the word let me tell you something what i'm feeling here there are so many trust issues in this room there's so many trust issues husbands don't trust their wives wives don't trust their husbands how in the world can we build strong families you say but he's given me every reason not to trust him he probably has but you will remain in torment until you make up your mind that if you can have confidence in your husband to change you can have confidence in the one that's got a hold of him vice versa for a husband who has a wife who who is not cheater she's not been a cheater she's not lived that kind of a life and you know that she's not lived that kind of a life with you and yet there are so many trust issues that can come up in the heart of a husband toward his wife as though she has some kind of agenda that she wants to see you fail it's impossible if she loves the lord if she loves the lord and his word it is impossible for her to want you to fail but the enemy will tell you that and you will confess that there are husbands who have spoken to their wives you're out to get me if you believe such a thing like that you're going to have to get that to calvary as fast as you can or you're not going to have a marriage and you're going to raise a house full of warped children is that too rough because that kind of an atmosphere will twist the minds of those who live in that kind of an atmosphere whether they hear those words spoken or not home is to be a safe place everybody's got to feel safe when they get home it doesn't mean that spirits don't get a hold of people it doesn't mean that there are people that are driven by something they've not yet learned how to control but what it does mean is nothing is accomplished by making these kinds of confessions much can be accomplished if we get a hold of ourselves and begin to pull those paradigms down unfortunately for many of us paradigms have become strongholds and strongholds have become death structures and what we're really building is death the bible said we have the power of life and death and where is that power held you don't just start saying something out of your head it forms first as a thought so if you hold death and life in the tongue you hold death and life in your thought anybody with me i don't know why we i don't know why we're taking all this time brother shelley i don't know why we're going back over some of this i don't know why we need to aren't there mysteries we can talk about here's a mystery here's a mystery we're the bride of jesus christ and we're not winning the mind battle there's a mystery and it's one that we can win we can win this thing we are winning this thing by taking god at his word we're winning this thing all right let's go back here just a moment i'm using several different places so i i ask you to forgive me for for jumping remember we decide if temporary thoughts get to remain and become a part of who we are in the message the position of a believer in christ paragraph 25 brother random says now i don't mean to be belittling them i respect that i don't know what that is maybe it'll catch up in a minute but they're supposed to be i think that's later down so just leave that up and we'll get to it i think maybe now i don't mean to be belittling them i respect that but they're supposed to be up here and here they are way down here but do you know what it is it's hope instead of faith faith does the job right now hope hopes for it but faith is the product interesting faith really does it see we have lots of hope but not much faith you see hope is nearly passive faith is never passive faith must be active we can hope and do nothing we can't have faith and do nothing do you understand the difference when we have faith we move on that faith we confess that faith we bring our mind and our body and our life into alignment with that faith we're not just sitting over here hoping that things will get better oh one day some glorious day things will get better no hope is not enough faith has to kick in you follow what the prophet is saying he says now faith really does it see we have lots of hope but not much faith so we want to change from hope today to positive faith and there's only one way we can get positive faith and there's only one way we can get positive faith and there's only one way we can get positive faith with me there's only one way we can get positive faith that's by what could we try that one more time that's by positive thinking of positive things there's plenty of negative things oh there's plenty of negative things to think on there's plenty of negative things to talk about how many of you know you can shift the atmosphere of your home by talking about something positive how many of you know you can shift the atmosphere of your home by talking about something negative who likes a positive atmosphere better than a negative amsterdam i do can't you trust god folks can't we trust god i'm sorry i'm wearing you out can't we trust god can't we trust him to believe that he's going to do what he said he was going to do in the message life paragraph 98 he said and that's what we are here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world until the things of god which is eternally and that's what preaching is for now notice this this is interesting he uses a word here i've taught you this one before but he uses a word here that's kind of different he said that's what's preaching that's what preaching is for is to pervert the thinking to a higher and better and to the place where christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things which are above now when i think of the word pervert i always think of the negative but did you know what the actual meaning of the word pervert is it means to alter something from its original source it can be to the negative it can be to the positive i don't suggest that we start using the word pervert in a positive way without explaining to everybody what we're doing in our vocabulary but i'm telling you that the actual meaning is to alter something from its original course or meaning or state and then the next definition is to a distortion or a corruption of an original thought so brother branham is using the word here perhaps it was not the best choice of words but it helps to get a point across he said that's what preaching is for to to pervert let's say to change the thinking to a higher and a better and to the place where christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things which are above how many of you could use a change in your mind let me see you how many of you could use a change in your thoughts how many of you'd like to have some conversion going on in your mental ability that you could reach up and take a hold of something higher than the life you're living right now in a message the door inside the door in paragraph five brother branham says sometimes people are going wrong thinking they're doing right but it'll wind up wrong so always think right do right and guess what you'll come out right maybe you think brother branham is putting too much emphasis on the thought but i think he's bringing a balance to where we're living think right do right you'll come out right he said that's right now look at this quote he said do right that's your duty to god think right know that you've got to come out right and you will come out right to think right is your duty to yourself and your duty to mankind to do right is your duty to god and he goes on and explains this to us in many many different ways through the message in the message we would see jesus paragraph 59 i want to go all the way down to the bottom to a highlighted part that's it and i want to read and let our conversation be clean and pure our thoughts thinking the best things thinking god's thoughts staying upon god's program and away from the things of the world do you believe it makes a difference in the message god hiding himself in simplicity brother branham brings it to a prayer sort of like this he said lord jesus in the way of humility and the way of humbleness i offer you the congregation that's on their feet i offered them to you because they have stood in response to the call they're seeking deeper things they're seeking more life and hearing after hearing that the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses and there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power listen at his prayer the blood of jesus so thoroughly cleanses them that there's no more nothing that the complete word of god rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost wait a minute are you listening to what i'm telling you this morning if you're really hearing a statement like that somehow i wish we could have it for you somehow i have to believe that you're not hearing it because if you hear a statement like that surely your toes will say amen it's such a powerful thought here he said that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the holy ghost and this holy ghost is a creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes i want some of you to take out your smart phone and i want you to take a picture of that i'm wait on you if your phone came across with no way on the ark you probably won't get a very clear picture and this holy ghost is a creator he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes what amen amen i want to say amen i want to go to the schemes and devices for just a moment and i want to show slide 31 i want to take a little more time even though i'm fighting hard many thoughts make up a paradigm can be a negative paradigm it can be also a positive paradigm which becomes something in our subconscious mind or non-conscious mind you can make up your mind that you're going to read a chapter or two from the scripture every morning before you get dressed for work and you can form a habit that can become a paradigm and you can do it so that it becomes automatic for the first days you'll have to think about oop but you can program that to become a part of who you are yes my grandfather programmed himself to have a fork full not a spoon a fork full of peanut butter after every meal someone told him that it would help him he made up his mind he said to my grandmother i'm gonna i'm going to eat a fork full of peanut butter after every meal for the rest of my life she said well okay whatever after the first day she said this is your jar it's got your initial on it don't put your fork that you've eaten your dinner with in the jar of peanut butter for me use your own we kids reminded him for the first week don't forget your peanut butter papa it became a part of who he was one of the last memories that i have of my grandfather years later the day that he had the aneurysm he'd been eating that for full of peanut butter for years now after every meal i sat at breakfast with him that morning he'd recently retired civil service at fort benning and he was going out because they were having a a ceremony and the general was going to be there and they were going to present certificates and and and congratulations to those who had retired from the base civil service and he was so proud of himself so excited that morning he put on a coat and a tie and we sat down and had breakfast together and i remember this just like it was yesterday he goes out the door and closes the door rushing to make sure he's not late and he forgets the peanut butter my grandmother goes and opens the door and she says to him ralph and as she opens the door he's standing there because as he's getting in his truck he remembers i've got to go back and have my fork full of peanut butter why are you even using that as such an example i'm telling you that even habits i don't know if that was a positive habit or not it certainly didn't give him long health but it was something that he made up his mind to do and he did and he didn't let anything even rushing out that morning he it struck him i've got to go back and you can do the very same thing you can absolutely form a positive paradigm so that when the enemy gives you something negative you so quickly turn that thing around and confess the opposite of it now we have made fun because we know some people that have gone a bit off the deep end with some things flash's lights and crystals and all kinds of different things you know people can get quite overboard but these people have this habit of when they recognize that they have said something negative they catch it and they say cancel that well we've laughed at him because it can be very very hard to carry on a conversation with somebody who's talking away 90 miles a minute and all of a sudden they salt and pepper the conversation but cancel that cancel that cancel that cancel that but you know what if that's what it takes for us to change our vocabulary and catch ourselves confessing something that is not according to the word of god we might ought to try it cancel that blood of jesus against that i refute that i renounce that i refuse that because a negative paradigm can become a stronghold and a stronghold the problem with the paradigm is it can influence other members of the family and the household but once it becomes a stronghold they become bound your family members your household sometimes your co-workers they become bound to something that is not of their own doing a stronghold can be raised up over a house over a family over a church we've been given authority over strongholds here's the definition any argument that sets itself up against the knowledge of god it can be a stronghold let's go on a stronghold the very word that's used in corinthians there is a castle a fortress or anything on which one relies it's derived from the greek word echo meaning to have possession of the mind and emotions remember we are told to tear down strongholds now what is a stronghold something that has taken possession of the mind and the emotions are you still with me now the holy ghost is not a stronghold the holy ghost is our control tower we need to follow the leadership of the spirit amen we don't need anything that is not of god possessing our mind and controlling our emotions hello now let's go on any place where we have allowed satan to reign can be considered a stronghold in our life like all other spiritual battles a stronghold is not pulled down through carnal methods a spiritual battle is always won how by the spirit in the spirit how many of you are following that now here is a stronghold i want to give you an example of a common stronghold it's found in slide 36 it's found in proverbs 13 12 and it says hope deferred makes the heart sick you can be sickened in mind and body of disappointed hope you hoped something to be better and it's still not better hopelessness paralyzes many people in the bright church hopelessness hopelessness becomes a stronghold and causes us to say things like it'll never change it'll never be any better the family will never get out from under this curse the church will never grow hope deferred makes the heart sick the word sick is translated unstable the bible said a double-minded man is unstable did you know that makes the majority of us at times unstable do you know what it means to be double-minded it means to have in your mind thoughts of positive and negative and you alternate living off of one or the other you get a good touch from god is that too strong you get a good touch from god and you walk out of there living off the positive catch yourself watch yourself you do your mind i'm going to practice what i heard the next thing you know you have reverted back to your negative thought process and you are now speaking things contrary to god's word and blaming people around you making excuses for your condition by blaming it on someone else and then all of a sudden something good can come along and you shift back now let me tell you something we can't be trusted when we operate like that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways the bible said so no wonder we're full of full of trust issues it's because we have shown ourselves to be unstable because we fluctuate back and forth between the truth of god's word and our perceived reality god break out every stronghold that has offered us an alternative reality for what your word says my dad will never be better don't you believe a lie like that my children will never be free from the influence of their don't you ever believe a lie like that see the enemy will cause you as you wait on the promise as you wait on a change as you wait on things to get better in your life or in your circumstances the enemy will cause that hope deferred the word deferred slide 37 the word deferred here does not simply translate as delayed we get tired and weary of waiting on the promise has that ever happened to you hold up your hand well i don't want to identify oh go ahead and identify one more time to every one of us we're tired of waiting on the change we're tired of waiting on the promise at times this word deferred doesn't just mean when the promises are delayed it means when they have been seized or violently taken ahold of the enemy is after your hope if the enemy can steal your hope he can pervert your faith remember we're not just to have hope we're to have hope and we're to have faith faith will put the promise of god in action the enemy wants us to lose hope so that we will not exercise our faith you're going to quit using faith in a situation where you've lost hope i may not be preaching to you but i'm preaching to somebody right now we will quit exercising our faith in an area of our life where we have lost hope we have to remember that it's not just delay that has caused us to lose hope something has seized has violently taken a hold of our hope and we don't seem to be able to get up above it no matter how hard we try it has become a stronghold it has to be dealt with as a strong hold it requires more than an i'm sorry it requires an about face it requires 180 degree change it requires making a conscious decision that i am going to let the lord fill me again with hope and my hope is going to anoint my faith and my faith is going to put me into action and i'm going to take a hold of everything that god has ever promised me in my life i'm going to quit waiting on it to come [Music] and i'm going to run out to meet it well i sure wished i had a better job the proof of desire you say it's like the man who says i uh how many of you have ever said this i would oh would i ever love to play the piano how many have you ever said it you didn't mean it yes i did mean it no you didn't the proof of desire is proven desire is proven in the pursuit no what you meant was you'd like to wake up one morning able to play the piano like sister laurel it didn't happen to her well brother branham talked about that little girl that god gave to give i know people that god is given a gift but let me tell you that is a small percentage here's what i loved about sister anna and i hope she takes this in the right way the the look of her jaw when she hit the wrong note and you know what i celebrate that i celebrate that that's who i am i celebrate that because she could have said she could have said to austin i said austin would you go and ask sister and christina maybe she has a song i don't want to pressure her but just see maybe she has a song she could say this morning when she found out that it might not work that the musicians we wouldn't have time to run over it she could have said well i might hit a sour note i love you livy but i have to say to her sometime you can play you can play that you're waiting on someone to play that for you you sit down and play it you can sing the song you can play it what if i hit a sour note guess what you hit a sour note i would rather be you i would rather be you than someone who said oh i wish i could play the piano oh lord of mercy i would love to play the piano no you don't want to play the piano if you really wanted to pray play the piano you would prove it you'd get you a book at the goodwill why do you say it that way because i know people real good and people will say i can't afford to learn to play the piano go to goodwill find you a piano book oh don't dare spend a dollar just ask some of these people who wanted to play the piano who got piano books laying around they never opened just ask some of them can you borrow one of theirs they just bought and never picked up i'm not saying everybody should play the end of it don't just sit there and wait on the gift to you know gobsmack you upside the head when you are possessed with hope and when you have anointed faith you don't just wait on something to come and fall on you like ripe cherries from a tree if you really want something and you really believe something you run toward it you pursue it in some way [Music] someone recently told me i've always wanted to have a business have one have it don't let the enemy tell you you can't have it there was a prophetic word over this church that told us that god was going to give brothers businesses to prosper their families and to send forth the work of the lord claim that i'm one of them you can't necessarily go and quit your job and wait on that to happen but you can make up your mind if anybody can i can because i'm depending on the help of the lord once you know that god has something for you don't you let hopelessness be a stronghold in your life to keep you from pursuing it is anybody hearing what i'm saying he's after listen the enemy desires to seize our promises to seize our dreams to seize our breakthroughs do you believe that he's after them he comes to steal and to kill and to destroy if satan can steal if he can seize and steal your hope then he can establish a death structure over a person's life and i don't have time this morning to talk to you some about death structures but i will tell you this it becomes almost like a magnet of attraction for death and when i'm talking about death i'm not just talking about physical death i'm talking about all forms of death i'm talking about poor health i'm talking about poor mental health i'm talking about poor emotional health when a death structure is set up over your life and you don't recognize that it started as a paradigm of negative thoughts that the enemy has has anointed and magnified until it's become a stronghold over your life and the enemy is using that as a death structure to attract discouragement and defeat and hopelessness again all the things that go with it i'm going to just take a moment thank you we'll go there when we meet again i want you to understand a little bit of how that death structure can work in your life in what i gave you this morning charity in the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 91 i want you to look at this with me we're nearly done it must be accepted in the mind you must make a conscious decision to accept the truth of god's word in your mind then it is believed with the heart that takes faith then the word of god becomes a reality then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the holy spirit then your sense of god your conscience of god everything that's godly flows through you there is a cleansing that begins to flow through you brother branham said there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up let's go on there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well i remember miss jones tried to trust god and miss so-and-so miss doe tried to trust god for healing one time and she failed see has the enemy ever told you something like that you say i'd like to trust god with my body well you saw what happened to so-and-so brother branham said in paragraph 93 but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory how many of you want that place when i when i read something to you that the prophet said and you recognize that that is not active in your life your faith should move you to say hey i want that my faith is telling me hey i want this right here so that so that i don't even think about what happened to miss jones it don't even it don't even come up in my memory of others that may have trusted the lord and it didn't turn out so good for them i want to get to a place where that doesn't even come in my memory he said no matter about miss jones and what she did let's go on he said if you and god together and nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his track it ain't how long you can make the war linger it's stop it right now you've lied to me your last time i recognize who you are i recognize where that thought is coming from and this this battle this particular one it's ending now you're the only one that can make that decision i've had people say to me i'm afraid to get on fire for god because i see what happens to people they get on fire for god and then they just start sliding right back into i tell you what how about let's get to a place where those thoughts don't even come into our mind anymore and we just say i want to be so on fire for god till i don't know anybody around me i don't even know what they're doing i got my eyes on calvary and i've got filled with a holy ghost and i'm ready to take god at his word and slay some giants and whip some devils and it doesn't you're not here to try to drag the war out you're here to try to win the war and get it over with now in the in in the same message greatest battle ever fought paragraph 108 it's 136. that's on the clock i'm going to take about 10 more minutes and we'll be done 108 what you got then you've got a solar system hallelujah it's god set the stars in order and said hang there till i call you they stay there nothing's going to move them nothing is going to move them they're going to hang right where god hung them are you with me they stay there when god can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscious everything cleaned out until it stands with god behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there how many of you want to be there how many of you want to be there the proof of the desire is in the pursuit i hope you'll have more of a pursuit for that than you do learning to play the piano i hope you'll say i'm going to that's going to be my life oh thank you brother shelly for reading to the whole church about me there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right he come around and say you don't feel any better your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to god it shines out certainly just as clean and clear for the word of god to work through the power of god he said see that's the main thing there's your battleground your battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul oh thank you brother branham he confirmed what we're trying to teach we get so ripped apart about by putting the soul in the middle like the scripture did but in this quote he's telling us where the battle comes back here in the soul mind will emotions he said the mind back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul and then corrects the gate to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit not your human spirit he's talking about holy spirit or it rejects the spirit now he goes on you can have little consciences and little feelings and little sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just little sensations and things but when it comes to reality listen your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends god let none of them miss it your mind either accepts it or rejects it brother branham is serious enough about this that he praise god let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out your mind can receive doubt your mind can move in faith it's a door it's a doorway every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that if you and i will fortify our minds with the word of god satan can no longer hijack our mind to become his battleground i will say it again if you and i will fortify our minds with the word of god satan will no longer be able to hijack our mind and use it for his battlefield he can't battle against that no sir he can't battle against it now we know that's true one more paragraph he says these battles has raged since the day of the garden of eden the battle in the human mind satan started it what did he do when he met eve he didn't deny god's word but he did what he whitewashed it he adjusted it just a little bit like the church has done he stopped up some little channels here somewhere he said but surely god genesis 3 1. see surely god all these things that he promised he knew the word was right but he knowed he just couldn't he he couldn't just come right out and blast it out blast it like but he he did what he sugar coated it this is how the enemy operates this is how he operates you have a thought and along with that thought you have some kind of feeling and emotion that goes along with that thought that thought gets planted into your subconscious along with that feeling which causes your body to feel a certain way resulting in a certain behavior that is in alignment with whatever you choose for your thoughts we keep thinking these same thoughts and keep getting the same results we end up going around and around and around and around and around caught up in a paradigm held back by a stronghold operating in the death structure when the answer is rather simple we've got to think about what we're thinking about we've got to make sure that we are not allowing the enemy to hijack our minds we catch him in the act and begin to confess the truth of god's word which enables our confessor our intercessor to begin to confess in eternity listen when what you speak in time is confessed in eternity it brings a union no wonder it's creative no wonder it's creative because you're declaring on earth over here in time and the father it's being declared in eternity in the spirit your confessor is declaring that in eternity you are confessing that in time no wonder god moves to meet you at the place of your confession i want you to stand with me i want the musicians to come i know this has been a little tough i know it's been a little rough i know it's been a little long it's been a battle it's a battle to get it out i've never preached about the battle of the mind that it wasn't a battle of the mind to get it out it's a battle but if a half a dozen of you will take the challenge if just a half a dozen will take the challenge make yourself accountable to the holy spirit invite him to put his finger on your mind invite him to call out and point out to you when your mind goes off when it starts flying down that trail of negativity of doubt when you begin to make all those confessions over your body over your family over your situation that are contrary to what god's best has declared declared and decreed for you if you'll let the holy spirit bring you into accountability in that moment if you'll repent i want you to know we need to repent for our thoughts father forgive me i'm so sorry for entertaining the lies of the enemy i'm so sorry for giving real estate in my head to the lies of the enemy i am what your word says i am i am healed i am whole i am a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new i am an overcomer i have a high priest who's confessing on my behalf before the eternal spirit of the father i don't have to remain in depression i don't have to remain in addiction i don't have to remain in mental instability i can be whole i can be whole i don't have to be hopeless i can have hope because he is my hope i can allow the holy spirit to inspire my faith until it starts reaching an action to take the promise of god to claim it as my own it's mine it's mind it's mine every promise in the book is mine now i know you're weary because you have felt the battle even as i have but i want to invite you that will to come and worship with us as chad leads us in a little bit of worship here i want us to begin to push ourselves into the presence of the lord for just a few moments and let's see if god will give us strength to to to ensure that our minds are fortified against every mental attack i'm telling you right now there are so many of us even this morning who are battling in our mind but jesus is the answer he is the victory he is the truth he is the way he is the life oh yes we decree wholeness over our families
