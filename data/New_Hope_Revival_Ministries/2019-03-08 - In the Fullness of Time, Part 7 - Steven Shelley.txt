TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of the New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again in partnership a great cooperation with the gospel channel and we're excited to be here today we appreciate all of the correspondence the emails the phone calls with your prayer requests and occasionally a testimony that God is answered prayer he is a prayer answering God and when we hear from you it's so encouraging just before I came out here to record this program today we received a prayer request from Ireland and I've already prayed for that brother and asked the Lord to meet that need and so we invite you to continue to reach out that way in many of you have mentioned what a blessing this series we have finished now six parts today is episode seven in the fullness of time and many have reached out to say that you've learned something you've been in church some a few people said I've been in church all my life but I'm hearing things that I've never heard before well that is so encouraging to us because I remember I remember the first time that I heard some of these truths and how they encouraged me and how they changed my life they gave me a level of trust in God my Creator my sovereign Lord that I had never had before and I just want to encourage you to keep approaching his word digging deep I think we've mentioned before that you can go on YouTube we have our own YouTube channel new hope revival ministries and I know that we have mentioned that you can go and see the episodes that you may have missed and today when I was looking on the channel I thought well perhaps we can go back and add the script to the description of the video and we will try to do that so that you could keep up I try to keep up with the verses that I share with you on what episodes so maybe if we put it there you could do your own homework you could go and mark those verses down and read them for yourself and underline them in your Bible and ask the Holy Spirit to speak to your heart to anoint your eyes with eyesalve I am fully persuaded my friend that the Word of God is our daily bread and really it is so much more than that I know that the Bible is a written record of Jesus who is the Living Word but it points us in the right direction and it creates an atmosphere when we approach it in prayer when we're going to read the Bible and we just take a moment to perhaps bow our head and say now Lord I need the Holy Spirit to teach me I need you to make your word alive to quicken it to my heart when we do that it points us it guides us into a deeper relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and I feel so blessed any of you that have ever read or have done any research about how we got the Bible that we have today many lost their lives many gave the entirety of their life to preserve to translate to protect the written record of God's Word and we're a blessed people we are a blessed people indeed I have a desire in my heart to visit the Museum of the Bible that has recently opened in Washington DC I've been to many of the museums that are there but what a wonderful thought to know that there is an entire museum dedicated to the greatest book that has ever been written and I love the Bible when I say that I mean that from the bottom of my because every time I pick it up I hear the Spirit of God speaking and it's always so precious for the moment whatever my need is a lot of times a lot of times when I pick up the Bible I say Lord you know what I need today you know what I need to read you know what I need to understand would you direct my thoughts would you lead me to where I should read today and sometimes I I feel sometimes I sense a direction of where to go other times I just maybe try to follow a pattern in my Bible reading but it's just a wonderful wonderful gift that we have and that's why I love teaching preaching that's why I love sharing with you some of the nuggets that the Lord has blessed us with down through the years that the understanding of God's Word is ever-expanding because again it is a written record but it's a written record of a Living Word the Word of God is alive Jesus Christ is the Word made flesh he lives in our heart in spirit form here we have the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit of God living inside of us Christ in spirit form aren't we a blessed people we are a blessed people indeed so let's get into the study today and before we do that let me remind you again you can subscribe to the YouTube channel you can find us online we have a beautiful website revival dot o-r-g you can now download our new hope revival ministries app onto your smartphone or your tablet and you can keep up with all the programs another way of keeping up with the programs that you miss and one of my favorite things that we do is the New Hope moments you can find those usually one comes out every week and you can find that on the app and be inspired we just want to make as many resources available to you as possible because we understand that we need a daily connection with with him and we get that many times by hearing the anointed Word of God it makes us feel connected to him in fact by faith it does connect us to Christ and souls these are some of the ways that you can connect with us other than the program here and send in your prayer request as we mentioned earlier because we believe in prayer and we believe in the power of agreement there's a lot of things we can do too much of but but not prayer prayer is one of those things that we can never pray too much and remember that when we pray maybe we'll do some teaching here sometime on prayer because when we pray we're not begging we're not trying to to sell something to the Lord you know it's not a job interview or something like that or a sales pitch we're coming because he told us to come we're coming at his invitation to present to lay down our petitions to thank him first and foremost for all the things that he has already done in our lives and then to pray a prayer asking that our lives could come into agreement with God's purpose and plan for us every single day I want you to know that Christianity is not a religion it is a relationship and it is a day by day hour by hour minute by minute walk of faith but all what we be glad won't we be glad when we step into a dimension into a home that he has prepared for us I'm so glad friend that I know that this life is not all there is I'm so glad that I know that I know that I know that there is something even more real than the life we're living right now there is an eternity with God not just a hope not just a promise but it is a reality and we keep journeying on as pilgrims toward Christ and toward an eternity with him I remember one time a young child asked me brother Shelly won't we would be bored in heaven if all we do is go to church and well first of all most of the time church is not boring to me on the occasion it certainly can be but no there's a whole lot more there's a whole lot more waiting for us beyond our heavenly home the new heaven and the new earth eternal life with him we will worship the king we will be busy as the overcoming bride of Jesus Christ reigning with him ruling with him in his throne and there will be plenty of things going on that will keep us certainly occupied through the endless ages you know I've got to make it I've got to make it and I can not by my good behavior because sometimes I fail but because of his grace and because of the faith that he has placed in my heart to stay connected to him I pray that our time together is not in vain that God will use some of these I don't want to say doctrines I want to say truths but but some of it is really essential doctrines in understanding God's Word but you know you can hear a doctrine and you can associate yourself with a doctrine and not be personally connected to it but when God makes his word come alive and he reveals it to you and it becomes a personal truth a personal revelation to you I'll tell you it becomes more than a way been more than a comfort more than a weapon it becomes life to a strength to us when our Lord was tempted in the wilderness by Satan he answered him how by the word it is written and I'm telling you the Word of God can be a great weapon in our life but it can also be strength when we're weak it can bring healing to us when we're needy in body and mind it can lead us and guide us when we have questions I believe there are so many answers in the Word of God not just how to live a Christian life but but how to be a good person you know the book of Proverbs gives us such wisdom and knowing how to treat other people there are so many precious things preserved for us in God's lovely Word and I feel like I'm one of the most blessed people on planet earth to be able to come in and talk to you share with you teach you a little bit encourage you from this Living Word precious Word of God Galatians chapter four verses one through seven is our foundational scripture passage for this series and I want us to read it yet once again now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all verse two but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father verse three even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but verse four is the focus but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons hallelujah verse six and because ye are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts thank God for that witness that the very spirit of God's Son the Spirit of Jesus Christ has been sent forth into our hearts crying Abba Father Papa my papa my daddy I believe that we should approach the Lord with great reverence and great praise and great gratitude and Thanksgiving but I want you to know there are some times when we are so broken when we have lost so much and what we really need is daddys love we need Papa and I know there are many of you watching this program today like myself you didn't really have the love of your earthly father as a constant in your life and then perhaps that that makes you and I a little more needy in that area than someone who grew up in a home with a very loving father my mother did everything that she possibly could as a single parent to provide for me both Mama's love and when I needed it to be a dad but how many of you know there's just something missing in a situation like that but I want you to know I hope this sounds sincere because I mean it from from a place that I don't usually talk from but I'm telling you the Lord has been he has been he has been that Papa to me so many times you know I I worry sometime that people never come to know that way they never come to know him that way and and of course if he's never been presented to you in that way you if then you may have never known to open the door that he would come in and be that Papa to you I believe he comes at our invitation and well I I'm a I'm a daddy and I remember the fear that struck my heart as a brand-new married man my wife and I we kept ourselves pure like the scripture states like the scripture says and we married and we weren't we weren't kids and I was almost 30 years old and my wife a couple of years younger than I am and I loved her so much I knew that God had brought her to my life and I knew that I wanted to be a father but when when we heard the news rather shortly after we were married really just just a few weeks we found out and I remember the fear that struck my heart hi I never had a dad example how will I how will i how will I learn how will I know it was a fearful thing some of you understand and the only thing that I could take comfort in was what a Papa what a father God has been to me through my life and I asked him no I begged him pleaded with him would you would you please help me to be the kind of dad to my children that they will need and that they deserve and really I guess you could say I I know I have failed oh my fail every week in some way as a dad to my children I'm sure I do but I can tell you this in any place in any area of parenting that I have been successful in in any area that I've got it right it has been because I look to the example that had been set before me by my Heavenly Father if you can come to know him that way I remember there have been times in all of my children's life and my oldest our oldest son will be 21 years old this year and our baby will turn 13 this year and I remember it doesn't happen as often as it used to but I remember those times when I really didn't have to say anything I didn't have to have the right words all that Mama and I had to do was hold them while they cried it out and I'm telling you sometimes as Christians as adults parents grandparents we need a Papa we need a Papa who can just hold us while we cry it out there's nothing like experiencing his strong arms of love and knowing in the deepest part of who you are that he loves you and it is because God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart he has brought you into the spirit of adoption that you're able to respond to him in this manner Galatians 4:6 crying Abba Father Papa God verse 7 wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ I'm telling you we have an inheritance much of what much of which we will begin to understand and partake of before the coming of the Lord but so much more we will experience after that change takes place but I believe that we have an inheritance that we can claim now that we can walk in now I believe in fact we must come to understand in new and fresh ways the authority that God wants to give to us as sons of God if you are a little lady watching this program and you'd say well I can't quite identify with being a son of God well I understand that because we brother sometimes we we have to get our mind around being the Bride of Christ but the truth is these promises are not gender based he is looking for a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish one who is preparing herself to meet the Lord but what makes that possible is the gift of adoption the spirit of adoption and the glorious truth of sonship we are sons of God led by the Spirit so I want to move into the teaching that we have set aside for episode 7 of the fullness of time that word fullness it means to fill to the fullest it means to complete to fill to the top so that nothing shall be lacking to bring to full measure and so really when we look at verse 4 but when the fullness of time was come we realize that from the creation time so to speak let's look at it like this time had been filling up and filling up and filling up and everything was getting ready you might look at it like this the stage was being set every player every every actor every person who would have a role was being brought on to the scene many had come on the scene and many had left the scene there had been many different kingdoms and we we go through the scripture and we look at what was going on among the Canaanites and the Egyptians now we come toward the period of the New Testament we see the Romans coming on so kingdoms have come and gone and leaders and kings and dictators have already come and gone sin has become a serious problem God had to deal with that problem through the flood baptizing the earth - to begin again with Noah and his righteous family you just start looking through the scripture and you will see and and what if I should tell you that none of that was in vain none of that was wasted every bit of that was the the vessel of time getting fuller and fuller and fuller and fuller so that for such a time as God would determine that time was full he would send forth the apostle send send forth his son born of a woman born under the law but you and I who've been studying these scriptures together carefully for these past seven weeks and even before that we understand through John 1 that it wasn't just the sending of a son indeed it was the sending of a son but who was the son the son was the Word of God the Word was with God the Word was God the word became flesh dwelt among us so this son that was sent when time had been filled up just look at it like a vessel like a pitcher that you fill up with water and sometimes maybe it would get full and then a little something would happen and maybe it would get a little empty I don't know exactly how to paint the picture but then it would fill up and it would fill up and prophets would come we mentioned we mentioned kingdoms and political powers but prophets would come and they would die and another prophet would come another word of the Lord would come to generation God constantly calling his chosen people back to him but there came a time that the bucket that the vessel was filled to the brim to the top complete lacking of nothing to full measure and in that moment of Chronos time God said today is the day now is the season that a son will come and will pay the price I have that verse of scripture broke down in the original Greek all the way through that word son the coming of a son it's the wheel's word in greek it's the mature son and Jesus was the first mature son but the Bible tells us that because of him many sons will come to glory many sons how are we sons by the spirit of adoption how do we manifest that we are sons John 1 as many as are led we have to be willing to be led you know sometimes we get this attitude nobody's gonna tell me what to do I don't have to follow anybody well everybody's following somebody everybody's following somebody it's just part of life everybody answers to somebody in life so why not is believers why not surrender our will oh my I have a will I confess to you that I have a will and I daily I don't think that's an exaggeration i daily have to push that will down because it gets a little hottie it gets it gets to wanting to exalt itself against another will the most important will is the will of God in my life I must be led I must be led by the Spirit of God this is how we demonstrate that we are sons of God so Jesus Christ the real son he became the first mature son so that you and I might also come to the maturity that is scripture that is mentioned in the scripture and then it says that he was sent to redeem verse five to redeem them that were under the law and that word redeem is one of my favorite words because if it doesn't just mean to save something it means to take something all the way back to its original purpose why it was created in the first place and I guess every one of us we were born for a purpose and we got away from that purpose most all of us strayed in our youth we found our own way our own will our own support system our own vices our own addictions we set out to do it our way our circumstances may be different but really there there is that struggle that takes place in the heart of every man to do it his way every woman to do it her way but then we found him many of us and I pray that if you have not yet found him you will you will find him I know that he is searching for you I know that he is not lost I know that we're the ones that are lost I know that he is searching for you I know that you have to be aware of that to be able to recognize his call in your life sometimes it's loud sometimes he calls through preachers he may call through a Christian television program but sometimes the call is just this quiet pool on the inside of our life that that says there's a higher power there's something bigger than you are you are not on this in vain no matter what the circumstances of your of your conception were no matter what kind of environment you were raised in are brought up in you are not here by accident I feel most assured that God has an appointment with you in this hour and that is to redeem you back to the original purpose of your birth of your creation God is a redeemer by nature you've heard us say that before and what we have in in biblical history from the creation to the cross from the cross all the way to the Millennium it is God's unfolding plan of redemption I love that God not only wants to redeem mankind he wants to redeem the planet we all know that we have made a mess of the planet that God has given us to live on we've been careless but God has a plan of redemption he's going to end up renovating it by fire but there's a new heaven and a new earth that will come he wants to redeem the earth he not only wants to redeem my life in your life but even the earth oh my and to believe to think that we're a part of that plan and I believe I am Redemption always comes with a price the word redeem we we know that God altom utley had authority to do his way and his will but because man was lost because we were taken captive by our own lusts we had become enslaved by our own lusts by our own desires and then so we had to be redeemed away we had to be taken away stolen away so to speak but not stolen bought purchased with a price a ransom was paid so many circumstances and situation said that we could say kidnapped us so to speak but a ransom had to be paid to redeem now if we were just go be slipped into another existence or are some some little slight change we could look at it only in the sense that we were saved from tragedy or saved from something else but it wasn't just salvation it was Redemption Redemption has a cost we are not our own we are bought with the price and you know what that price is we've studied it together you and I the precious blood of Jesus Christ blood that was created specifically for my Redemption for your Redemption and we could go on that that adoption the word adoption there the spirit you have received the spirit of adoption it's another beautiful word because this is not adoption in the sense that we think of it today adoption in the time of the scripture was an entirely different process because even a natural born son had to be adopted in his own family so this is not just the taking in as we know adoption of an orphan or someone who doesn't have a parent to raise him and we we go through the proper authorities and through the proper procedures and we adopt a child into our home by fostering that child and then legally adopting him but in the Bible in the time of the scripture adoption was an entirely different thing even though Benjamin Judah and Joshua River are my natural born sons had we lived in the time of the Bible a first temple or second temple period and many years after adoption would have been a different process altogether though they were born a shellye they would be they would set as we read right here Galatians 4 they would be under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father until they had proven themselves they learned enough they had experienced enough under tutors and the governors and now it would be time for them to have authority to conduct business to carry on the affairs of the Shelly family and in that moment there would be a celebration there would be a declaration of full adoption and authority there would be a great family celebration and then their name would be just as real as my name to conduct business on behalf of the family and this was the process of adoption it was bringing them from natural-born sons to complete mature sons with the same authority of the father in the family so this is what the spirit of adoption has done is doing in my life and in your life bringing us to a place that when we surrender in obedience to the truth of God's Word remember we've got to quit resisting it with our own will and we've got to surrender to his will and when we do that we come to a fuller measure of the stature of a perfect man we come into a greater place of maturity and when we are growing in that grace of maturity we're no longer acting like like little brats if you will forgive me for saying it that way the Apostle Paul said when I was a child I thought as a child I spoke as a child I behaved myself as a child but when I became a man a wheeeeel son a mature son I put away my childish things I put my toys aside and I had to now conduct business because I had a family of my own this is what what we understand and so this is what's happening in our life this is a process and so getting saved what we call getting saved that's just a small part it's a bigger it's a bigger plan Redemption it's a bigger plan than just inviting the Lord into your life well well how do we know we're on the journey because we keep cooperating with we keep yielding to him and I encourage you to do that because this spirit of adoption comes by the spirit this adoption process comes by the spirit not by the letter of the law but by experiencing the Spirit of God that word spirit there in the spirit of adoption in Galatians is is numa which is breath wind it's the same word we use in Hebrew the the Ruach the very breath of God so it's by the breath of God that we come into a higher place of adoption and a higher place of authority I'm glad of that I'm glad of that because it means it's not just my responsibility to mature myself what I do is I have to yield let the spirit keep moving over my life I hope somebody gets that it's a daily yielding Spirit of God lead me Holy Ghost of God lead me today God my life and let me let me renew my relationship with with the Lord with Jesus Yeshua our Messiah and so we're no longer servants we start out just servants but that word servant is a word that can mean slave a bondman one one who who is serving in an indentured manner no freedom of his own but we are no longer servants but we are coming into sonship as sons oh my what a difference that can make in our life and so when we think about this in the fullness of time we're thinking again about that stage and we're thinking about how everything had to be set up because God in His sovereignty he knew that the Lord His Son Jesus Christ our Messiah would come that he would be rejected that he would be crucified that he would die that he would be that he would rise again on the third day that on the day of pentecost the church would be born and the gospel would need to go out and the good news of the baptism of the Spirit would need to go out and so I loved I loved reading and finding out that there were there was no time in history better from from the time of Calvary all the way back to the Garden of Eden there was no better time in the history of mankind for the Lord to come as the Son of God everything was set up in such a manner that his coming was in the fullness in the perfect timing of the Lord I have some notes here that I can share with you you know the Roman roads there was a lot that went on in in the in the Roman occupation there were some serious things that took place in the Roman occupation even of the city of Jerusalem but it wasn't just Jerusalem it was that an entire part of the world the entire region was being conquered so to speak by the Romans but because of this conquering and there were many dark dark things about it but because of it they they built a system of roads unlike there had ever existed before in fact the Romans historically were responsible for opening up the world they opened up the world to every community in that entire region through the Mediterranean the landscape was paved with Roman roads they would take mortar a concrete type mixture pour it into a trench sometimes three feet thick and cobblestones would cover the top and then they would pour salt on top of the cobblestones to harden the surface of the stone and the mortar and would you believe that men those roads built in the time of the Romans are still traveled on today I myself have traveled on roads that were laid by the Romans in the time of Christ they were so well done but what happened was for instance the Ignatian way you can read about the Ignatian way this was a road that stretched across Macedonia the Macedonian world allowing all the early apostles especially the greatest missionary of the time the Apostle Paul an easier means of travel and listen Paul as we know from the book of Acts he had a hard way to go in many ways he went through a lot of stuff but he would not have been able to cover the ground to to cover the territory that he covered had it not been for this great network of Roman roads in spite of thieves and and other threats along the way one could go from city to city across that entire macedonian region with relative ease this established a wonderful opportunity for the spread for the communication of the gospel had this happened had had Jesus come 100 years before it would have slowed down it would have greatly impeded the entire process of sending the gospel forth not only were there roads but remember by this time there were very established shipping routes and so we read of some of the experiences that the Apostles had in in ships and all of their experiences were were not pleasant but the routes were already set up God allowed the timing to be just right spice routes were already operating from the Orient all the way across the land of the Bible and through Macedonian all the way up to up to to Rome everything in place I love that because it reminds me that God knew exactly what he was doing this didn't just happen by chance this was God allowing the fullness of times to take place the vessel was filling up little by little by little so the world was ready physically that's the point I wanted to get to the world was ready physically for the coming of the Messiah for the coming of the savior of all mankind and then we find out that religiously the world was ready we've spoken about culture a little bit what was going on I'm telling you there there was a lot of philosophy that was going on that was anti God and against God and there was a lot of paganism in the land and very much idolatry and people were worshipping everything from the Sun God to the dancing goats it was a it religiously a very very sad time and even even Judaism the faith of the Old Testament the the the faith that God established in the earth it had also become very corrupt the religious climate in the land of the Bible the Land of Israel as a nation that religious climate was very difficult because there was this clash of paganism and of the of the Pharisee spirit that had taken over the faith of the Bible or we would say the faith of the Hebrews Judaism if you will remember the Maccabees had had revolted against this this occupation and they led Israel to a time of temporary relief a reprieve a little bit of freedom but since the time of the high priesthood and the religious establishment of the day during that same period it had so degraded roaded the the character of the leadership the integrity of the leadership had fallen and with a little bit of study about the the city of Jerusalem some years after Christ at the destruction of the temple in 70 AD you do a little reading there and you'll find that even the priesthood of the Holy Place the Holy Temple had become quite corrupt religion was a mess at this particular time and so the Pharisees they were offering a heavy burden of legalism and most of them with no character to draw people to it it was just a heavy burden and extreme legalism that they were trying to to lay on the on that on the shoulders of the worshippers and then there were various other groups or sects like the Sadducees and they offered no hope for resurrection you you know you better get it right because you only get one chance and that's it and it's over and it's finished and done and they didn't believe in eternal life by the resurrection and so that wasn't much to get excited about so you've got paganism invading the world expanding crazy coming from the far reaches of Asia and now reaching across the the entire area of the Mediterranean it's now crossing seas it's traveling the same roads I mean so things were being set up for the gospel to go forward but also error was was being able it was able to go into many many places because of the shipping routes and the roads etc and then you've got the paganism then you've got the faith of the Bible the scripture the Old Testament Judaism as we as we have mentioned earlier it was becoming corrupt and divided and hopeless very little hope being offered for the people they were very very oppressed and very confused and instead of looking for Savior they were looking for a middle very general to come as a messiah and save them from the oppression of the Romans but God knew exactly what he was doing he knew exactly what he was doing there was no hope anywhere else the pagans and all of their idolatry they were offering no hope to the people and now even the scripture even even Judaism as outlined in the Old Testament it was offering no hope to the people and guess what in that particular religious climate God sent forth his son so the world was prepared physically the world was prepared religiously and we can say from Scripture that the world was ready prophetically there were various prophecies from the Old Testament very well known prophecies among the people that would describe precisely the entrance of the Messiah into the world his birthplace would be talked about his flight into Egypt would be mentioned that he would be born of a virgin had been prophesied even the timing of his death had been prefigured in Daniels prophecy through the prophecy of the 69 weeks everything was in order prophetically so look at this physically religiously prophetically the scene was set the time was chosen the vessel of time was fooled and what did God do he came he came in a body made of flesh as we mentioned before not to a palace not to a not to a royal hospital but he came in the most humble of places and even the city of his birth was prophesied in Micah chapter 5 verse 2 but thou Bethlehem Ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of Judah you're just a tiny little country town yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting this was just a spirit of the Lord had fallen on Micah the prophet and he had risen up to prophesy the city of his birth and we know from the scripture Matthew chapter 2 verses 4 through 6 and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born this was Herod and they said unto Him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of judah are not the least among the princess of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel this was God's doings it was God's plan even the city chosen prophesied hundreds of years before it came to pass and notice that when it come time to announce the birth here is the son he has arrived on planet Earth the world will never be the same and that doesn't mean that for 2,000 years everything has been beautiful oh no the world continues to go farther and farther away from God but we have a hope today that they didn't have in any other hour until the fullness of time had come and when it was time to announce his coming was it to the most learn it was it to the most educated was it to the to the one who had the most power no Luke chapter 2 verses 8 through 20 tell us I don't know if I'll have time to read it all but but we know these scriptures let me start and there were in the same country Shepherds sheep keepers the keepers of goats stinky humble Shepherds keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord came unto them not to Herod not to the Emperor the ruler he didn't go to Rome to announce it no no the angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy the best news folk the best news the world had ever heard which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes we talked about those lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts what a production not just the angel of the Lord that's powerful but now a great multitude of heavenly angels the heavenly hosts all gathered down into one little field outside the city of Bethlehem what a beautiful thought praising God this great heavenly hosts saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherd's said one to another let us now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the LORD hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and verse 20 and the Shepherd's returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and what are you and I doing two thousand years later we're still rejoicing at the song of the Jools we're still rejoicing at this beautiful announcement and not only the beauty of the announcement but the reality of the Promised One for that little baby that was laying there in that little City of David Bethlehem the house of bread Bethlehem the house of bread that little baby he grew in wisdom in favor in knowledge we remember he baffled the teachers didn't he when he was separated from his parents he went through preparatory years coming into his place coming into his maturity though we were a son he had something to learn a hard lesson the lesson of obedience and indeed friend our Lord was faithful he was obedient even unto death and here we are 2,000 years later I am a product I am a product of this gift my life is what it is today because of this gift because he didn't remain the little baby he grew up he fulfilled all that was spoken of him he went to the cross betrayed by his own brethren murdered by his own kinsmen but it was a part of God's beautiful plan death the grave and hell couldn't hold him hallelujah he came forth victorious from the grave and he lives tell somebody he lives he lives in my heart he lives in your heart and if he doesn't live in your heart you can repent of your sins you can make the choice to obey God and his beautiful word and he will live in you by that spirit the spirit God called it tear through the through the prophet or the Apostle in Galatians the spirit of his son have come into your heart and it gives you that place and grace to say Papa daddy I need you father we come to you today thanking you for this fullness of time thanking you O God that you had everything in your great big capable hands and that this is not a just a lesson in history past but it is a present reality because you are a living Savior and you are a living God and there are people watching this program right now that don't know you in the fullness of salvation maybe they know about you maybe they've experienced you through religion but I pray right now that they will humbly call on your name that you will visit them in their home that your spirit will surround them there I pray that they will press in to a new birth to be born again born of the Spirit of God I pray Lord that you will so reveal these truths to them that nothing the enemy can say no lie of the devil would be able to dissuade them to pull them away from knowing who they are and most of all who you are the Living God the living Savior I pray Lord that you would fill believers with the Holy Ghost and fire and I pray that your healing virtue would be known in bodies right now those who are calling on your name for healing in their physical body I know that you are still the healer I trust you in that way and I ask you to come and visit break feathers and yokes and drive away demonic spirits that have come to torment the children of the Most High God and let us all come into a place of growth may we just mature in our relationship with you I pray in the beautiful name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua seiyya thank you for watching tune in
