[0:00] It takes more than air to make this
[0:02] thing work. And it takes more than air
[0:04] to make this instrument work. It takes
[0:07] breath. Living vibrating breath, not
[0:11] air. Breath.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; That's what makes this sound. That's
[0:16] what makes this sound. And that's what
[0:18] makes you sound.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; Because you and I are instruments unto
[0:22] the Lord.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; And we don't have much to say in the
[0:25] last day. We really don't have much to
[0:27] say of our own accord.
[0:30] We really desire to know the mind of the
[0:33] spirit.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet told us that in those
[0:36] last days the bride would have
[0:41] thus saith the lord.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Now I don't think thus sayaith the lord
[0:46] should be a punctuation on every
[0:48] interpretation of tongues or on every
[0:52] inspired gifted exhortation.
[0:56] You can if you know it. If you know
[0:58] that, you know that you know that you
[1:00] know. But once you roll something off of
[1:03] you and you roll it entirely on the
[1:06] Lord, it better be.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; He said in that last day the bride will
[1:13] have thus sayaith the Lord or she will
[1:15] do what?
[1:16] &gt;&gt; She'll keep still.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; She has nothing to say and nothing to
[1:20] do. Jesus had nothing to say and nothing
[1:23] to do. He said, "Except it be shown of
[1:25] me."
[1:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Of the eternal spirit of my father.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; So the prophet taught us that he moved
[1:32] by vision.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus ministered many times by vision.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Not just by sunship or by being the word
[1:44] manifest.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; He moved many times in ministry by
[1:49] vision.
[1:50] And you and I have been called to carry
[1:52] on.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:57] &gt;&gt; in the earth. Is that right?
[1:59] &gt;&gt; That doesn't make you Jesus.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; It makes you Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; I'm good with that.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Anybody follow?
[2:09] &gt;&gt; I'm good with that.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Married to the word.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Married to him. And without some
[2:16] uncction, she's going to say little and
[2:19] do little. But when that uncction comes
[2:22] and she knows who's she is and who it is
[2:26] that has taken control, he will be able
[2:28] to speak through her. He said as the
[2:32] final voice of God to the age.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; The bride. The bride.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; She won't be hot air.
[2:44] She won't just be a bunch of hot air.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; She's got to have the breath, the
[2:49] vibrating life,
[2:50] &gt;&gt; the breath, the spirit breath, the
[2:53] spirit life.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; In New Testament numa
[2:59] in in Old Testament ruach,
[3:02] it's more than wind, more than air. It's
[3:05] vibrating living substance because it's
[3:09] spirit breath, spirit life.
[3:13] I tell you, you've got a well. You get
[3:15] the Holy Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost.
[3:17] You better get the Holy Ghost because
[3:19] when you get the Holy Ghost inside of
[3:21] you, he is an artisian well.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; He never stops giving out.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; He just pumping, pumping, pumping,
[3:30] pumping out. And it's not air. And it's
[3:33] not oxygen.
[3:35] It's vibrating
[3:37] breath,
[3:38] &gt;&gt; vibrating life
[3:40] &gt;&gt; that come from the original life.
[3:42] There's something down on the inside
[3:47] of me that I it just keeps bubbling out.
[3:51] It just keeps coming out. And that's
[3:53] where
[3:55] [Applause]
[3:56] &gt;&gt; that's where my joy comes from. And
[3:59] that's where my life comes from. My
[4:02] peace
[4:04] comes from that.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; My get up and go. My press on
[4:12] &gt;&gt; the zeal of the Lord.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; It comes from something on the inside.
[4:19] It's not a pull from without. It's a
[4:22] pull from within.
