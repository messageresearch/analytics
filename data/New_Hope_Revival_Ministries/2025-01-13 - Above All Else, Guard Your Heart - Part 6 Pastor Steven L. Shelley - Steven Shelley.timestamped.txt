[47:33] the same yesterday and today and forever
[47:36] I'm thankful for what he has done and
[47:39] I'm grateful for what he's going to do
[47:41] but I'm grateful for what he is doing
[47:44] right now he has purposes in all
[47:48] things he told us in the word all things
[47:50] work together for good to those who love
[47:54] God and to those who are the called
[47:56] called according to his purpose we may
[48:00] not understand everything about all of
[48:02] the ways that we go but he promised that
[48:06] it would all work together for good
[48:09] because I'm one of his called you
[48:11] believe you are we're going to receive
[48:14] the tithe and offering today to give to
[48:16] the work of the Lord to see that his
[48:18] purposes are carried out for for this
[48:21] body what everybody else is doing God
[48:25] didn't call us to that he called us here
[48:28] called us as part of this ministry and
[48:31] he gave us a Ministry mandate a vision
[48:34] and we want to be a part of that Vision
[48:36] being carried out uh we would like to
[48:39] know every uh every Dot and every
[48:42] Crossing of every tea right now but
[48:45] that's not the way God does he reveals
[48:48] himself Peace by Peace by peace he told
[48:52] the children of Israel if I give it to
[48:54] you all at one time you wouldn't be able
[48:56] to maintain
[48:57] it and that's the way it is with this
[48:59] good old gospel if he gave it to us all
[49:02] at one time we'd let some things slide
[49:05] along the way and there would be some
[49:07] amalekites that would rise up and steal
[49:10] what really really belongs to us and so
[49:13] God gives it to us in bits of Revelation
[49:16] along the way and he helps us to
[49:18] maintain it he wants us to maintain it
[49:20] and that's what we're trying to do we
[49:22] want to maintain the vision that God has
[49:25] given us so if if you'll get your tithe
[49:27] and offering ready brother Cade's going
[49:29] to slip over to the piano and we're
[49:31] going to Usher into the preaching of the
[49:33] word we're real glad that brother shell
[49:34] is here this weekend things did not work
[49:37] out the way we thought but God has a
[49:40] purpose in it he knows what he's doing
[49:43] and so we just yield to his purpose and
[49:46] believe that he has something to say
[49:48] through our pastor today not next week
[49:51] today and that's that's what we're
[49:53] believing for for this house for today

[56:37] isn't he good you may be seated for just
[56:40] a moment we were not supposed to be here
[56:42] today but God sort of uh as brother gy
[56:46] was explaining he sort of changed our
[56:48] plans we made it all the way to Buford I
[56:52] don't know if you know where that is or
[56:54] not north of Atlanta
[56:56] all of Georgia is there top go is there
[57:01] just about any restaurant you can think
[57:03] of in the in the nation is there but
[57:06] none of them were open except one we
[57:09] found you'd be surprised to know that it
[57:11] was Olive Garden of all places all the
[57:14] other restaurants were closed and very
[57:16] few people were on the highway on Friday
[57:19] the roads had not been properly plowed
[57:22] or salted they were working on it but
[57:24] Atlanta is a big place
[57:26] we saw people slipping and sliding and
[57:29] we saw cars overturned some up on their
[57:32] sides some up on their turned over on
[57:34] the roof and uh it was just not a very
[57:38] pleasant thing but we were going to keep
[57:40] moving on and they called us and and and
[57:44] uh begin to tell us just how how bad it
[57:47] was and how dangerous it was and we were
[57:49] going to have to go over one of the
[57:50] highest peaks uh from Asheville I don't
[57:53] even know the name of that place but uh
[57:56] when you get to the top from Asheville
[58:00] going way up yeah that's right you go
[58:03] down into Irwin where the floods came
[58:05] through and uh they were saying that the
[58:08] top of the road had not been cleared and
[58:11] be very difficult to get through so
[58:12] anyway as defeated as we might have felt
[58:15] at the moment we uh had a nice lunch at
[58:18] Olive
[58:19] Garden we had a private
[58:22] waiter we were the only table when we
[58:25] sat down there were a few more that came
[58:27] and uh they told us what they could give
[58:29] us and what they couldn't give us so
[58:31] that was good because it busted us out
[58:33] of our routine what we would normally
[58:35] order we had to try something different
[58:38] and we had a great waiter and the kids
[58:40] were disappointed that we didn't get to
[58:42] make it but we'll we'll do Lord willing
[58:45] the weather better we'll go next weekend
[58:48] and we gave brother gley the option of
[58:50] preaching both Sundays and he is really
[58:52] still recovering in his voice I think
[58:54] and and uh didn't accept that part of
[58:57] the invitation but he will Minister next
[58:59] Sunday God is good and we want to give
[59:02] him praise I knew when I got home it
[59:06] took me all the way getting home to
[59:08] realize that there is a purpose there is
[59:10] I told my wife even uh last night
[59:12] there's a reason why we were to be here
[59:15] this weekend and God knows we're praying
[59:17] for all of those who are not able to be

[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:22] will look for me I'll be there two how
[1:09:26] many of you have a
[1:09:28] reservation you're lot kind of quiet
[1:09:31] this morning and I probably didn't help
[1:09:32] with that but uh maybe you'll come
[1:09:35] together in a moment we'll get the word
[1:09:37] to you that's our desire would you thank
[1:09:39] these musicians and all their labor for
[1:09:42] the Lord what a
[1:09:46] gift it's not easy what they do and
[1:09:50] we're blessed to have them if you
[1:09:52] believe that say Amen let's stand for
[1:09:54] the reading of of God's word today let's
[1:09:57] turn to James chap 1 verse 19 if you
[1:10:03] will we
[1:10:05] are we are going into a series within a
[1:10:08] series so to speak we're still working
[1:10:11] on above all
[1:10:12] else because of an experience that we
[1:10:16] had in the
[1:10:18] night and it's been in our heart because
[1:10:20] the scripture tells us in Proverbs 4:23
[1:10:25] that it is our responsibility to keep
[1:10:28] our heart with all diligence for out of
[1:10:31] it
[1:10:32] are the issues of life and so in all of
[1:10:37] the guarding and the keeping and the
[1:10:39] spiritual discipline that we do our
[1:10:42] heart is one of the most important
[1:10:43] things that we can keep a watch over do
[1:10:45] you understand that because that heart
[1:10:48] is not the blood pump that's the seed of
[1:10:50] the emotions and we know how emotions
[1:10:53] can lead us in a direction that doesn't
[1:10:56] glorify God Amen so we need his help we
[1:10:59] want to be on top of that as much as we
[1:11:02] possibly can we're looking at some of
[1:11:05] the things that can get in the heart
[1:11:07] that can get in the mind and the will
[1:11:09] and the emotions that can not only weigh
[1:11:12] us down but they can become paradigms
[1:11:15] and structures habits and repeated
[1:11:20] Cycles in our life and uh we said
[1:11:24] recently that you know wounded people
[1:11:28] who are not healed have a tendency to
[1:11:30] wound others and we don't want that uh
[1:11:34] uh if you get around people that are
[1:11:36] bleeding guess what'll happen you'll get
[1:11:38] bled
[1:11:39] on and so it's important as overcoming
[1:11:43] Believers in this last day that we keep
[1:11:46] guard we keep watch over our heart and
[1:11:50] if we
[1:11:51] recognize paradigms or or what we
[1:11:54] sometimes refer to as death structures
[1:11:56] that cause us to repeat these same
[1:11:59] spirals going down and not up uh we want
[1:12:03] to be able to identify them and do
[1:12:06] something about them and whether you
[1:12:09] realize it or not as brother gy said we
[1:12:11] have everything we need if Christ is
[1:12:14] formed in you the hope of glory you have
[1:12:17] everything you need to overcome every
[1:12:20] situation no matter what the enemy is
[1:12:23] trying to hold you with do you believe
[1:12:24] that yes and so James tells us in
[1:12:28] chapter 1 verse 19 wherefore my beloved
[1:12:31] Brethren let every man woman too be
[1:12:35] swift to hear slow to
[1:12:39] speak and slow to wrath the Amplified
[1:12:43] says it this way understand this my
[1:12:46] beloved Brethren let every man be quick
[1:12:49] to hear a ready listener slow to speak
[1:12:53] slow to
[1:12:56] take offense and to get angry you you're
[1:13:01] going to have to have a longer
[1:13:04] fuse in this hour you're going to have
[1:13:07] to find tougher skin in this hour
[1:13:11] because people are quite willing and
[1:13:14] ready to
[1:13:15] offend you know if you're involved in
[1:13:18] social media you understand the power of
[1:13:22] being cancelled and people can get upset
[1:13:25] with you and offended at something you
[1:13:27] say that may be absolute truth and uh if
[1:13:31] you're depending on social media for
[1:13:33] your income you can lose it overnight so
[1:13:36] somebody's going to have to have some
[1:13:37] broad shoulders in this hour I think the
[1:13:41] worst kind of an offense it seems is the
[1:13:43] kind that we receive in Christian
[1:13:46] circles in our church community in our
[1:13:49] faith community from our leaders or from
[1:13:52] our brothers and sisters and there's a
[1:13:55] tendency to hold on to it and nurse it
[1:13:57] and let it cause us to make decisions
[1:13:59] accordingly but God wants us to be free
[1:14:02] from all the weight and the baggage of
[1:14:06] yesterday if you believe that say Amen
[1:14:09] if I were to ask you how many of you are
[1:14:11] free from yesterday well there would
[1:14:13] maybe be a few hands and they would be
[1:14:16] raised mostly by faith the rest of us
[1:14:19] would realize that we're in a battle and
[1:14:22] we're going to win you know why because
[1:14:25] because the victory is won it's ours we
[1:14:27] just have to appropriate it we have to
[1:14:30] use it in in an hour like this so let me
[1:14:33] give you just a another verse here and
[1:14:36] we will uh then let you take your seat
[1:14:39] but we are to be slow to speak slow to
[1:14:42] take offense and slow to get angry and
[1:14:46] then I want you to to look at First
[1:14:49] Peter
[1:14:51] 4:8 and above all things here we hear
[1:14:54] the the same phrase above all things
[1:14:57] have fervent charity among yourselves
[1:15:00] for charity shall
[1:15:04] cover the multitude of sins this word
[1:15:07] charity is
[1:15:09] agape we we're familiar Agape or agapo
[1:15:14] we know that they are cousins to one
[1:15:17] another in the Greek language and the
[1:15:21] Amplified says it like this above all
[1:15:24] things have intense and unfailing love
[1:15:27] for one another for love covers a
[1:15:32] multitude of sins mine yours and
[1:15:35] everybody else's who will accept him by
[1:15:38] faith do you believe that
[1:15:41] forgives and
[1:15:44] disregards
[1:15:46] the offensive the offenses of others so
[1:15:50] this is not just his love for us but
[1:15:53] this is also our love for one another
[1:15:56] our unfailing love for one another
[1:16:00] covers a multitude of sins it forgives
[1:16:05] hear it and
[1:16:07] disregards the
[1:16:10] offenses of
[1:16:13] others just hard to
[1:16:16] offend a blood bought spirit filled word
[1:16:21] believing child of God now don't set out
[1:16:25] to do it because then you're making
[1:16:28] yourself an offender and you're going to
[1:16:29] answer to God for it the Bible said if
[1:16:32] we were to do this intentionally it
[1:16:34] would be better that a
[1:16:38] millstone that's bigger than some of
[1:16:40] those bobles that women wear around
[1:16:42] their neck a millstone is what you grind
[1:16:45] the the Grain on it's better that one of
[1:16:48] those were hanged around your neck and
[1:16:50] you were cast into the sea you would you
[1:16:53] would certainly swim like a Rock
[1:16:55] wouldn't you you'd go right to the
[1:16:57] bottom than to hinder or offend one of
[1:17:00] my little ones it's inevitable that we
[1:17:03] will offend one another but let it be
[1:17:07] unintentional and let us be tender and
[1:17:09] soft before the Lord that he can help us
[1:17:12] to know it and give us a strategy to
[1:17:15] make it right how many of you believe in
[1:17:19] reconciliation I do father we thank you
[1:17:22] today that your presence is here you
[1:17:25] have gathered us together for this hour
[1:17:28] for a purpose and that is that your word
[1:17:31] might speak to us and that it might
[1:17:33] become alive in us we pray that that
[1:17:35] will be the case even now that
[1:17:38] distractions will diminish and that our
[1:17:41] Focus will be upon you because it's not
[1:17:45] the written word only that we fall in
[1:17:47] love with but it's the person of the
[1:17:50] word it's you Lord Jesus Christ we ask
[1:17:54] for your help today and we give you
[1:17:56] honor and glory for all that you are
[1:17:58] doing in our lives in the precious name
[1:18:01] of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[1:18:04] Messiah we pray the Saints said amen
[1:18:07] amen you may be seated that word charity
[1:18:11] that we mention translated in the
[1:18:14] English it is the a uh it is the Agape
[1:18:18] it comes from the noun
[1:18:20] agapo it means to love with a
[1:18:24] affectionate regard to show Good Will
[1:18:30] benevolence it also means the kiss of
[1:18:35] Peace that's not the betraying kiss
[1:18:39] that's the sincere kiss that's not the
[1:18:42] kiss that uh says
[1:18:46] goodbye it's the clinging kiss it's the
[1:18:49] one that says I love you and I'm here
[1:18:52] for you and I'm going to be here for you
[1:18:55] when you need me somebody said well all
[1:18:57] I can do is pray well I wouldn't
[1:18:59] diminish that by describing it as all I
[1:19:02] can do we understand that one of the
[1:19:06] greatest things that we can do for one
[1:19:08] another brother bham said other than
[1:19:11] saying God bless you and he said there's
[1:19:13] power in that it may sound a little
[1:19:16] oldfashioned to say to one another God
[1:19:18] bless you but it's a good thing to say
[1:19:21] it means May the abundance of Heaven be
[1:19:23] upon you and I don't know anybody that
[1:19:26] couldn't use more of the favor and Grace
[1:19:29] and abundance of the Lord in your life
[1:19:31] amen but other than that one of the
[1:19:34] greatest things that we can do for one
[1:19:36] another is to pray for one another a and
[1:19:39] that's not saying I'm going to
[1:19:43] pray that's praying that's not going
[1:19:46] down and hitting the praying hands and
[1:19:48] and continuing to
[1:19:50] scroll hello come on that means really
[1:19:54] doing it
[1:19:55] and some situations require a fervency
[1:19:59] and an urgency and a calling out some
[1:20:02] situations require intercession
[1:20:05] intercessory prayer where we try to put
[1:20:08] ourselves in someone's position and say
[1:20:10] oh God move and move now do you believe
[1:20:15] God's moved by that kind of faith I
[1:20:17] absolutely do H that word charity kiss
[1:20:21] of Peace arms gift
[1:20:25] because that is some people's language
[1:20:27] of love to give or to receive something
[1:20:31] it's translated in one at least one time
[1:20:34] in the New Testament as a love feast and
[1:20:38] that goes back in um I would say more
[1:20:41] modern times but it would be to the
[1:20:43] times of John Wesley and the sanctified
[1:20:46] people they had Services of fellowship
[1:20:50] and spiritual worship and even sometimes
[1:20:53] communion and referred to them as feasts
[1:20:57] of love everyone showing one another
[1:21:01] that kind brotherly kindness and that
[1:21:05] love that is
[1:21:07] unconditional we don't know anything
[1:21:08] about that kind of love until we receive
[1:21:11] it from above amen uh that fileo love
[1:21:15] doesn't always work in the realm of
[1:21:18] that's human love and that doesn't
[1:21:20] always work in the realm of
[1:21:22] unconditional but there is a love
[1:21:25] whereby you and I have been loved that
[1:21:27] is not based on our uh reciprocation
[1:21:31] it's not based on what we give back not
[1:21:33] based on our Behavior or our track
[1:21:35] record it's simply his unconditional
[1:21:39] love for us and once you have needed it
[1:21:43] and received it and felt the impact of
[1:21:46] it it behooves us then to want to show
[1:21:49] that to somebody else you know the Bible
[1:21:52] tells us in 1 Corinthians chapter 13
[1:21:55] love just simply charity is the is the
[1:21:58] English translation it simply doesn't
[1:22:01] keep
[1:22:06] record it just doesn't write down every
[1:22:10] hurt it just doesn't rehearse over and
[1:22:14] over again how bad you wounded me you
[1:22:18] see this agape love
[1:22:21] covers a
[1:22:23] multitude of sins it doesn't mean that
[1:22:26] someone is off the hook it doesn't mean
[1:22:29] that there may not be repercussions it
[1:22:31] doesn't mean that there may not be
[1:22:33] restitution but it simply means I'm
[1:22:36] going to love you without regard for our
[1:22:40] Rocky past we've been through you may
[1:22:43] look around this room and see some folks
[1:22:45] that you've been through some junk
[1:22:48] with but if you can come if I can come
[1:22:51] to a place where we let the past
[1:22:54] strengthen us and not shade or diminish
[1:22:58] our love for one another then the
[1:23:01] purposes of God are actually being
[1:23:02] fulfilled in our life tribulations and
[1:23:05] trials situations where iron sharpeneth
[1:23:09] iron it's actually making us more like
[1:23:11] him the prophet tells us we're being
[1:23:14] honed in we're coming to a narrow point
[1:23:18] so that Jesus Christ The Living Capstone
[1:23:21] can come and take his rightful place
[1:23:24] place at the head of all things is he
[1:23:28] Lord of all in your
[1:23:30] life then he's got to be Lord over your
[1:23:33] heart he's got to be king over your
[1:23:35] emotions he's got to sit on the throne
[1:23:38] of your inner life and that's what we
[1:23:41] desire of him the word fervent there
[1:23:44] that is from the King James fervent
[1:23:47] charity means
[1:23:50] stretched Have You Ever Had Your Love
[1:23:57] stretched or
[1:23:59] strained this was used to describe the
[1:24:02] taught muscles of an athlete who strains
[1:24:06] to win a
[1:24:09] race I I'm around people who are it
[1:24:13] hasn't got on me in a while but I'm
[1:24:15] around people who like to work out and
[1:24:18] they like to use their muscles and and
[1:24:20] they like to stay healthy and that's an
[1:24:22] amazing thing uh but some of them
[1:24:26] haven't seemed to learn how this
[1:24:29] soreness and how these acids work and
[1:24:32] the the tearing down of the muscle
[1:24:35] building it stronger for the future and
[1:24:38] what they for instance they might go and
[1:24:40] have a good workout and come home and
[1:24:42] say I'm
[1:24:45] sore well that's not usually how it
[1:24:48] happens you may be
[1:24:50] fatigued but you're usually not sore
[1:24:53] until the muscle has some time to
[1:24:56] process the
[1:24:59] accident because sometimes we pull our
[1:25:02] muscles in ways that on a machine or
[1:25:05] with some free weights that we really
[1:25:08] don't use our muscles in everyday life
[1:25:10] so we're shocking ourselves the soreness
[1:25:13] doesn't usually kick in for up to 12
[1:25:16] between 12 and 24 hours but the fatigue
[1:25:20] and a little bit of uneasiness can be
[1:25:23] there but my when it
[1:25:25] hits it can really hit that muscle has
[1:25:30] become taught and uh strained and
[1:25:33] stretched and if you have hamstring
[1:25:38] issues it can be like a
[1:25:40] rock and it takes some time even for
[1:25:43] that to
[1:25:44] release this fervent charity means it
[1:25:49] has to be exercised again and again and
[1:25:52] again and again and you you got to use
[1:25:55] that kind of love beyond your comfort
[1:25:58] zone Beyond just normal everyday
[1:26:03] affection love you love you we go out
[1:26:07] the door love you we know it's true we
[1:26:11] know who means it and who doesn't mean
[1:26:13] it when we hang up the phone love you we
[1:26:17] know who means it and who doesn't mean
[1:26:19] it but listen fervent charity is not
[1:26:22] just love you and out the door we're
[1:26:24] talking about be above and beyond the
[1:26:27] Daily Grind loving one another when
[1:26:30] we're just simply unlovable I wonder is
[1:26:33] there anybody in this house since we
[1:26:35] have so much quietness to think is there
[1:26:38] anybody in this house that would be
[1:26:40] willing to admit I can often be nearly
[1:26:46] unlovable particularly grumpy and
[1:26:49] grouchy and hard to get along
[1:26:52] with am I singing anybody
[1:26:54] song but fervent charity fervent love
[1:27:00] says I want to take this intense moment
[1:27:04] and have a love
[1:27:10] Feast somebody has slammed the
[1:27:14] door picture has fallen off the
[1:27:18] wall the normal reaction is a that
[1:27:23] buzzard I'm going to be nice that
[1:27:27] Buzzard let's knock the picture right
[1:27:30] off the wall but fervent charity takes
[1:27:34] an
[1:27:35] opportunity to stretch
[1:27:38] itself and instead of you stomping off
[1:27:42] meeting anger for anger offense for
[1:27:48] offense you walk into the kitchen and
[1:27:50] say I'm going to make him a
[1:27:52] pie or it's going to get very
[1:27:55] quiet or if it's the other way around
[1:27:58] I'm going to stop on the way home and
[1:28:00] bring
[1:28:01] flowers oh it's
[1:28:03] quiet you see if this is not love
[1:28:07] you oh wow there's a lot of wiggling
[1:28:10] going on on the front
[1:28:13] here this is not love
[1:28:18] you this is I love you so much that I am
[1:28:22] willing to look Beyond on your offensive
[1:28:26] Behavior even your unkindness I'm in
[1:28:30] this for the Long
[1:28:32] Haul the reality is we actually are more
[1:28:36] likely to do that with our companion
[1:28:38] than with
[1:28:39] anybody but this is not speaking
[1:28:41] specifically to husbands and wives it's
[1:28:44] talking about anybody in the family of
[1:28:47] Faith it's talking about the body of
[1:28:50] Christ and it's more than love you pray
[1:28:54] praying hands praying for you thinking
[1:28:56] about you it's going beyond the normal
[1:29:00] comfort zone it's tightening up the
[1:29:03] muscles it's biting the bullet and going
[1:29:07] Beyond not to prove a
[1:29:10] point but to manifest the
[1:29:14] nature and the
[1:29:16] character of Jesus Christ we talk about
[1:29:20] it but we have come to the hour where
[1:29:22] we're going to have to man manest it the
[1:29:26] world around us is dying for that kind
[1:29:28] of a love and how are we going to be
[1:29:31] able to stretch ourselves and love the
[1:29:33] unlovable out
[1:29:37] there if we strain so much in
[1:29:43] here love doesn't mean you agree with
[1:29:46] everything that someone says or does
[1:29:50] love doesn't mean you always constantly
[1:29:52] Overlook the offense
[1:29:54] without ever calling someone into
[1:29:57] accountability but fervent charity says
[1:30:00] in spite of regardless of yeah the
[1:30:05] Golden Rule do unto others as you would
[1:30:08] have them do unto you not as they do but
[1:30:12] as you would have them to do that's
[1:30:15] beautiful it's beautiful but it's even
[1:30:18] more than that this fervent charity is
[1:30:23] being mindful of the opportunity to love
[1:30:27] one another in spite of all the
[1:30:32] things that agitate
[1:30:35] you about that
[1:30:38] person now I know that when someone
[1:30:40] comes and and they spend an hour or two
[1:30:43] hours with us they they often talk about
[1:30:46] how much love there is in this little
[1:30:49] body but once they've been here a week
[1:30:55] let's get
[1:30:56] real once they've been here a week or
[1:30:58] two and they begin to hear the tea
[1:31:01] they're calling it now did you know that
[1:31:04] it's they call it
[1:31:07] tea once the tea is spilled
[1:31:10] and you fill everybody in on everybody
[1:31:15] else's strengths and
[1:31:19] weaknesses newcomers are already forming
[1:31:22] opinions
[1:31:24] about
[1:31:25] Old-Timers before they ever have an
[1:31:28] opportunity to get to know them for
[1:31:30] themselves and what actually happens is
[1:31:33] just repeated offenses build up and
[1:31:35] build up and build up and wounds get
[1:31:38] larger and larger and larger and when
[1:31:42] someone is already dealing with
[1:31:43] woundedness or has already dealt with
[1:31:46] great offense in their life they have a
[1:31:48] tendency to attract more of the same
[1:31:50] until the cycle is broken by the word
[1:31:54] on and so it becomes a snowball flying
[1:31:57] down the hill at break neck speed
[1:32:00] anybody want to help me but we're going
[1:32:02] to have to put our life where our words
[1:32:06] have
[1:32:07] been maybe even a little less
[1:32:10] talkie-talkie and a little more walkie
[1:32:13] Walky is going to be important in this
[1:32:15] last hour amen so as uncomfortable as it
[1:32:20] gets when we have to do some
[1:32:22] weeding in our
[1:32:24] garden the scripture says above all else
[1:32:28] diligently guard that area of your life
[1:32:32] for your thoughts flow out of that your
[1:32:34] words flow out of that your deeds and
[1:32:37] actions flow out of that even your
[1:32:39] prayers are sometimes
[1:32:44] Twisted by how you feel at the
[1:32:48] moment you know I I don't have to wonder
[1:32:51] why we're not operating in the fullness
[1:32:53] of the pro promise of the restored
[1:32:55] creative spoken
[1:32:57] word because we're not yet trusted with
[1:33:02] it some of us would be more likely to
[1:33:06] use it when someone offends
[1:33:09] us than when someone needs us this is
[1:33:13] not to put a wart on somebody's nose
[1:33:17] this isn't to dig a pit for somebody to
[1:33:19] fall in this is to help somebody get up
[1:33:22] and get out of the m
[1:33:24] that they're in it's a word that calms
[1:33:27] the storm it's a word that causes the
[1:33:30] tumor to disappear it's a word that
[1:33:33] releases
[1:33:34] conviction are you with me it's a word
[1:33:37] that brings Resurrection Life to things
[1:33:40] that are already
[1:33:43] dead that's the purpose of this creative
[1:33:47] spoken word that is not being restored
[1:33:50] it has been restored it's just not in
[1:33:53] full manifestation in the body because
[1:33:56] we might still be using it for less than
[1:34:02] what God intended it for it's not for
[1:34:05] our
[1:34:06] Vengeance it's not to get
[1:34:09] even it's to further the kingdom of God
[1:34:13] so until we can weed our
[1:34:15] garden and deal with some of our
[1:34:19] woundedness and some people think it
[1:34:21] means they have to get in need
[1:34:24] deep and Wade through all the pain of
[1:34:27] the past the reality is just let one
[1:34:32] drop just one drop of his blood let it
[1:34:35] fall on that let him reveal to you by
[1:34:38] the spirit I your past and all of the
[1:34:41] stuff attached to it that's dying right
[1:34:44] now under the impact of the blood of the
[1:34:47] Lamb what she said what he said what
[1:34:50] they did it's dying right now under the
[1:34:54] influence of the blood of the lamb and
[1:34:56] you're coming forth as brother Hawke was
[1:34:58] praying in a resurrection life that says
[1:35:02] I'm no longer that old creature hey
[1:35:05] didn't a lot of that happen when you
[1:35:06] were when you were who you
[1:35:09] were didn't a whole lot of that stuff
[1:35:13] that you carry around today didn't a lot
[1:35:15] of that happen before you became a new
[1:35:17] creation in
[1:35:19] Christ didn't a lot of that stuff go on
[1:35:22] underneath the old the old you know when
[1:35:25] I the Apostle said all things have
[1:35:29] become new old things have passed away I
[1:35:33] am not my own anymore but I've been
[1:35:36] purchased by a
[1:35:37] price
[1:35:39] Hallelujah are you a new creation in
[1:35:42] Christ then where is that old man he's
[1:35:45] to be dead and everything that's
[1:35:48] attached with him has to Die the reality
[1:35:52] is it's not automatic IC the reality is
[1:35:55] it has to be dealt with you're the only
[1:35:58] one that can deal with it you're the
[1:36:00] only one that can bring order to the
[1:36:02] chaos The Authority is in your mouth the
[1:36:06] word is in your hand it's in your mouth
[1:36:09] come on the blood of Jesus Christ is not
[1:36:13] only available to be
[1:36:16] appropriated it it it is
[1:36:19] absolutely part of the inheritance of
[1:36:23] this bride to fully appropriate the
[1:36:28] power in the and the blood of Jesus
[1:36:32] Christ there's been no other blood like
[1:36:35] that it's God's blood blood created by
[1:36:40] God for the specific purpose of
[1:36:42] redemption it doesn't look like your
[1:36:45] blood it doesn't look like my blood it's
[1:36:48] a blood that in its chemistry has no
[1:36:52] more life than than yours but in
[1:36:56] reality if you broke it down if you
[1:36:58] could get to some of it you broke it
[1:37:00] down it might look like human blood in
[1:37:04] that sense but there's a life there it's
[1:37:08] zoy life it's God's own life and if his
[1:37:12] life is there in the blood his love is
[1:37:16] there so you've not only got his life
[1:37:19] flowing through you you've got his love
[1:37:21] flowing through you and we must tear
[1:37:24] open the the roof we've got to kick down
[1:37:27] the Walls we've got to burst the dams
[1:37:30] and we've got to let that love flow
[1:37:33] out I know that everyone has these
[1:37:36] different ideas about what love looks
[1:37:38] like and it's not putting a bottle to
[1:37:41] your neighbor's
[1:37:44] mouth it's not petting them when they're
[1:37:47] wrong you see this kind of love is
[1:37:50] sometimes
[1:37:51] corrective but here's what you need to
[1:37:53] remember it's
[1:37:54] always
[1:37:56] Redemptive in fact everything God
[1:37:59] does is Redemptive did you know if he
[1:38:03] allows you into a tough
[1:38:05] situation he does it not to punish you
[1:38:09] he does it to bring
[1:38:10] Redemption to that area of your life
[1:38:14] everything we experience in Christ is
[1:38:18] Redemptive I'm going to wait till you
[1:38:20] say amen and we've got to show the same
[1:38:23] same
[1:38:24] kind of
[1:38:26] Grace to one another you see there's
[1:38:30] redemption in
[1:38:33] Revelation it's not just following the
[1:38:36] instructions it's having a revelation of
[1:38:40] what you carry some of us aren't even
[1:38:43] fully aware of what we carry when we
[1:38:45] carry the life of God but we understand
[1:38:48] that all the father
[1:38:50] was he poured into that flesh body of
[1:38:53] his son and we say he wasn't 50/50 50%
[1:38:58] God and 50% man we say from scripture he
[1:39:01] was 100% God and 100% man that's a
[1:39:05] pretty powerful combination it was that
[1:39:08] way so that he could be touch with the
[1:39:09] feelings of our infirmities and yet
[1:39:12] carry within himself something so
[1:39:15] powerful that it could save the entire
[1:39:19] world right whosoever would call on that
[1:39:23] name and repent of their sin can be a
[1:39:26] partaker of that blood salvation is
[1:39:29] through calling on the name of Jesus
[1:39:31] Christ and having his blood applied to
[1:39:34] your heart we're talking about more than
[1:39:36] salvation we're talking about Redemption
[1:39:40] and the bride you know we're receiving
[1:39:42] some of our testings and and and judging
[1:39:45] and evaluations
[1:39:47] now because we
[1:39:51] bypass as his elect we know that we
[1:39:54] bypass some of that that happens in the
[1:39:57] end not because we're looking for a
[1:40:01] great escape only in fact I don't want
[1:40:03] to go anywhere until I can fully
[1:40:05] manifest the life and character of Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ I mean that I want to be one of
[1:40:12] those that he
[1:40:14] promised would be available in the last
[1:40:16] of the last days well we can't do that
[1:40:19] if we don't guard our heart we can't do
[1:40:22] that if we don't tend our garden we
[1:40:25] can't do with that we can't do that
[1:40:27] until we deal with our nature to
[1:40:31] carry
[1:40:33] offense we got to have fervent charity
[1:40:37] and that word cover in First Peter 4
[1:40:40] covers a multitude of sins it doesn't
[1:40:42] simply mean in this reference that it
[1:40:44] hides the sins leaving them where they
[1:40:48] were but it causes their what remission
[1:40:52] the script R said in fact that's more
[1:40:56] like it obliterates
[1:40:58] them you see the Old Testament made
[1:41:01] provision for
[1:41:03] covering the sin was there it was just
[1:41:07] covered by the blood of a lamb or a goat
[1:41:09] or whatever the the offering was but the
[1:41:13] blood that covers Us is more what the
[1:41:16] flesh could not do in that it was excuse
[1:41:18] me what the law could not do and that it
[1:41:20] was weak through the flesh God sent his
[1:41:23] own only son he came himself in the form
[1:41:26] of a son in the form of a man and gave
[1:41:30] us access to the life that was in the
[1:41:33] blood cell I want you to know the life
[1:41:36] that was in the the lamb the goat the
[1:41:39] turtle dove the the life uh that was in
[1:41:42] that blood cell would be animal life and
[1:41:45] that would fall on you and it would do
[1:41:47] you no
[1:41:48] good I don't want to be silly but it
[1:41:51] might make you you know squawk like a
[1:41:53] bird or or or or blate like a lamb but
[1:41:56] it wouldn't do you much good not under
[1:41:59] this Covenant under the old Covenant it
[1:42:02] covered
[1:42:03] sin but God knew it was underneath there
[1:42:07] but he had a way provided thank you
[1:42:09] Lord he didn't just provide a a a ram
[1:42:13] for Abraham's sacrifice but there're on
[1:42:16] the same Hill Abraham caught a
[1:42:19] vision of another animal so to speak
[1:42:23] but this one was God
[1:42:25] Almighty who would become the Lamb of
[1:42:28] God which taketh away the sins of the
[1:42:32] world not to cover sin but to
[1:42:36] obliterate my past sin has been
[1:42:41] obliterated
[1:42:42] remitted by the life of the blood of
[1:42:45] Jesus Christ so is my present sin if
[1:42:49] there is UN any unbelief remaining in me
[1:42:53] or the attributes of unbelief they are
[1:42:56] also
[1:43:00] obliterated by the power of the life of
[1:43:03] the blood of the lamb and should
[1:43:06] unbelief creep up in my heart again
[1:43:08] while I'm trying to tend my garden and
[1:43:10] guard it
[1:43:11] diligently the same life that prevailed
[1:43:15] for my past for my present it prevails
[1:43:19] for my future that doesn't give me a
[1:43:21] license to sin
[1:43:23] it doesn't give me permission to
[1:43:25] compromise on the word but what it does
[1:43:29] give is a Redemptive
[1:43:31] hope that when I fall
[1:43:34] short his life brings the measure up do
[1:43:39] you understand Grace that's what his
[1:43:42] grace does it doesn't give us uh the
[1:43:46] ability or permission to go and do
[1:43:48] whatever we want to do but it sets us
[1:43:50] free from what we have done
[1:43:54] and what we might do should we again let
[1:43:57] unbelief go untended and unguarded if
[1:44:01] you don't pluck it up it'll
[1:44:03] multiply it's like
[1:44:06] gossip the old analogy that they used to
[1:44:09] use you know this woman she she just
[1:44:12] started criticizing and condemning her
[1:44:15] preacher and preachers are easy Target
[1:44:19] because they're just always in your face
[1:44:21] they are
[1:44:24] and so she just you know I don't know
[1:44:27] what all she said you know he preaches
[1:44:29] at us but his wife is guilty he does
[1:44:32] this but you know his children do that
[1:44:34] and and uh you know I I saw him other
[1:44:38] day and who knows what he was doing and
[1:44:42] but she had details lots and lots of
[1:44:45] details but a Revival was coming and the
[1:44:49] the same preacher asked that the people
[1:44:51] would pray and repent and make right so
[1:44:53] that the atmosphere of the church would
[1:44:55] be ready for souls to be saved so she
[1:44:57] took it to heart even though it came
[1:44:59] from the same preacher that she just
[1:45:01] simply was not fond of and she prayed
[1:45:06] through and she went to see the preacher
[1:45:09] and she said I it pains me to say this
[1:45:13] but she said I have had terrible
[1:45:17] thoughts I I sometimes wonder if this is
[1:45:19] the kind of confession God was really
[1:45:21] looking for but I've had terrible
[1:45:24] thoughts about
[1:45:26] you awful thoughts and I I've spread
[1:45:29] awful Tales unsubstantiated rumors and
[1:45:33] and and I you you said we needed to get
[1:45:36] straightened out because of an
[1:45:38] evangelist was coming and Revival was on
[1:45:40] the way and so I'm here to confess my
[1:45:43] sin and and tell you I'm sorry for the
[1:45:45] things that I've said and he said well
[1:45:47] you're forgiven that's what the word
[1:45:48] said and I I hold no grudge I didn't
[1:45:50] know you were doing that but but of
[1:45:53] course uh I hold no grudge and the blood
[1:45:55] is sufficient and the grace of God is
[1:45:57] sufficient but I do well what can I do
[1:46:00] what can I do to make it right I want to
[1:46:03] make sure that it's behind us and he
[1:46:06] said well there's one thing you can do
[1:46:08] that might help the
[1:46:09] situation and she said what was that I
[1:46:11] know you've heard the
[1:46:14] story there is something you could
[1:46:16] do you know you live in an upstairs a
[1:46:19] flat over there uh uh across the way and
[1:46:23] he Saidi have a I have an extra feather
[1:46:26] pillow in here and I'd like to send you
[1:46:29] home with that feather pillow and I'd
[1:46:31] like for you to go up to your upper uh
[1:46:34] apartment there and open up the window
[1:46:36] and and Sh rip open that pillow and
[1:46:41] shake the feathers to the
[1:46:43] wind and she said well why would I do
[1:46:46] something like that he said I've got a
[1:46:48] I've got a reason I've got a mission
[1:46:50] behind it you got homework
[1:46:53] assignment and she said well what what
[1:46:55] will I do once I've emptied it out he
[1:46:58] said then I'd like for you to go and
[1:47:01] pick
[1:47:03] up every
[1:47:07] feather
[1:47:09] wow how could I do that some would land
[1:47:12] on the roof some would land on the stoop
[1:47:16] some would land in the flower beds on
[1:47:19] the balconies of my neighbors and some
[1:47:22] would find them way their way to the
[1:47:25] street and some might get caught on a
[1:47:28] windshield wiper blade of a car passing
[1:47:32] by there would be no way I can see uh
[1:47:36] one falling on a cat or a dog and them
[1:47:38] running off and there would be no way
[1:47:41] preacher that I would be able to gather
[1:47:44] up all those feathers and he said that's
[1:47:45] exactly right and neither will you be
[1:47:48] able to go back and gather and undo and
[1:47:52] straighten
[1:47:54] out or
[1:47:57] control the
[1:47:59] damage that your
[1:48:02] criticisms and and
[1:48:05] suppositions have
[1:48:08] caused she hung her
[1:48:10] head determined as she went home to be
[1:48:14] more careful not only with her words but
[1:48:17] with her thoughts it's easy to say I'm
[1:48:20] sorry
[1:48:23] just like it's easy to say I love you
[1:48:25] and it's easy to say I'll
[1:48:27] pray but it's not always easy to carry
[1:48:30] it
[1:48:31] out amen so we need to be extremely
[1:48:36] careful in this hour with our thoughts
[1:48:40] and our words I might have shared a
[1:48:43] little piece of this the other day uh
[1:48:45] Friday a week ago in a in a text from aw
[1:48:50] toer he had some powerful words of
[1:48:53] advice about hurtful and offensive sin
[1:48:56] the sin of
[1:48:58] Gossip he used the scripture in 1 Peter
[1:49:02] 4:8 never pass anything on about
[1:49:05] anybody else that will hurt them love
[1:49:08] covers a multitudes of sin and then this
[1:49:11] is what he said the tail Bearer has no
[1:49:14] place in God's
[1:49:18] favor for too long folks the reality is
[1:49:21] we sometimes dress up vicious
[1:49:25] talk as a prayer
[1:49:28] request you you forget
[1:49:30] we're Pentecostal by experience and we
[1:49:34] don't have to know the details to
[1:49:37] pray
[1:49:38] hello when we don't know how to pray the
[1:49:41] spirit within us knows how to intercede
[1:49:44] with groanings that can't be understood
[1:49:47] is that right it may sound sometime like
[1:49:50] a moan or a groan it might be a language
[1:49:53] that you never learned but the spirit
[1:49:56] knows the
[1:49:58] need but our curiosity
[1:50:03] craves the
[1:50:05] tea am I using that
[1:50:08] right our curiosity craves the detail
[1:50:12] tell me a little bit
[1:50:14] more so I'll know how to pray you might
[1:50:18] get by with that in an Evangelical group
[1:50:20] where there is no praying in the spirit
[1:50:23] but in a place where praying in the
[1:50:25] spirit is not only allowed but
[1:50:27] encouraged you don't always have to
[1:50:30] know just like I think it was last
[1:50:32] Sunday when I mentioned that that we had
[1:50:35] faced a crisis in our family on Saturday
[1:50:38] and most people just graciously said
[1:50:41] we're praying for you some tried to
[1:50:43] guess what it was I won't I wouldn't
[1:50:45] play with your family's life like that
[1:50:47] trying to guess what was going on but if
[1:50:50] you did and it caused you to pray thank
[1:50:53] you I appreciate it every text I got my
[1:50:58] wife got praying for your family you
[1:51:00] keep coming to my mind praying for your
[1:51:02] family you know that's enough sometime
[1:51:05] because I know that when you don't know
[1:51:08] and I don't know he
[1:51:10] does and really all you have to do is
[1:51:13] Lord I come into
[1:51:16] agreement with your
[1:51:18] mind and your
[1:51:21] will if it's your will I bless it
[1:51:24] whatever it is and I ask you to exalt it
[1:51:28] and bring it to pass if it's not your
[1:51:31] will my faith says you're God's
[1:51:35] Sovereign and supreme and you know how
[1:51:38] to stop it and you don't have to be
[1:51:41] creative or
[1:51:44] directive you don't have to tell God how
[1:51:46] to do it that's
[1:51:49] witchcraft all you have to do is come
[1:51:51] into agreement as it is in heaven yes
[1:51:55] sir as it is in
[1:51:57] heaven you don't have to know he said
[1:51:59] and then he said then she said and then
[1:52:01] he did and the next thing and then it
[1:52:03] went this way and it went that way and
[1:52:04] it went the other way
[1:52:06] and all the neighbors heard
[1:52:12] it we believe the spirit
[1:52:15] knows there's always going to be
[1:52:17] somebody who loves us who's curious
[1:52:23] at least one person ask a me and they
[1:52:25] didn't ask me but at least one person
[1:52:28] asked a member of my family you know
[1:52:30] what's going on with your
[1:52:35] family I don't think they got much
[1:52:39] information in fact that's just not the
[1:52:43] way to
[1:52:45] handle
[1:52:47] yourself or somebody else's crisis let
[1:52:50] the Saints say amen amen just
[1:52:53] pray maybe we ask because we want to
[1:52:56] know what we can do here's what we can
[1:52:59] do pray like crazy men and women pray
[1:53:04] like let me let me say it this way pray
[1:53:06] like you believe it pray like you think
[1:53:09] it
[1:53:11] works hey because it does
[1:53:16] work every time even when it doesn't
[1:53:19] look like what we think it ought to look
[1:53:21] like we know that he's Sovereign we know
[1:53:25] that he doesn't make mistakes and we
[1:53:28] know that he doesn't have to kill
[1:53:29] somebody to bring them into
[1:53:32] alignment with his
[1:53:35] will we're delivered from our
[1:53:37] denominational Pentecostal
[1:53:40] mindset we no longer believe God has to
[1:53:42] bring a car
[1:53:45] wreck or a bad doctor's report to get
[1:53:49] somebody to his will he knows how to
[1:53:52] press them press us shape us mold us
[1:53:57] make us he knows how to send a
[1:54:02] fish with a big mouth and a hearty
[1:54:07] appetite to swallow us up he sent the
[1:54:13] storm he moved on the
[1:54:16] fishermen something's got to be
[1:54:20] done gave Jonah the strategy throw me
[1:54:24] overboard the Bible's just clear God had
[1:54:27] already
[1:54:29] prepared the
[1:54:30] fish not only that he swam him closer to
[1:54:34] where he needed to go
[1:54:35] anyway God knows how to do that don't
[1:54:39] you think he's got a fish waiting for
[1:54:42] the one you're praying for bring it on
[1:54:45] Lord whatever it takes we want one
[1:54:48] another to be in the perfect will of God
[1:54:52] and we want to pray without
[1:54:55] manipulation I just simply don't trust
[1:54:57] some people's prayers I wouldn't tell
[1:54:59] some people what I was going
[1:55:05] through because we don't need more
[1:55:09] manipulation amen you don't need more
[1:55:12] manipulation in your life you just need
[1:55:15] the sovereignty of God to shine his
[1:55:19] light on everything that presses you on
[1:55:22] everything everything that burdens you
[1:55:23] on everything that concerns you as it is
[1:55:26] in
[1:55:28] heaven let it be done in
[1:55:31] earth we are just Earth and vessels
[1:55:34] being made into vessels of honor and
[1:55:36] glory for the kingdom of God do you
[1:55:39] believe that the tail Bearer has no
[1:55:41] place I got to hurry the tail place has
[1:55:43] no uh uh the tail Bearer has no place in
[1:55:47] God's favor if you know something that
[1:55:50] would hinder or hurt the reputation of
[1:55:52] one of God's children you ought to bury
[1:55:54] it
[1:55:57] forever I'm quoting
[1:56:00] toer but I
[1:56:07] agree God didn't call you or me to
[1:56:13] expose our brother's
[1:56:15] weakness or our sister's
[1:56:18] weakness love covers a multitude of
[1:56:23] sin I'm there look folks there are
[1:56:25] certain things that have to be dealt
[1:56:27] with abusive situations have to be dealt
[1:56:30] with I'm not covering that up that has
[1:56:33] to be dealt with that's not what we're
[1:56:35] talking about but giving the
[1:56:38] details just so that someone's
[1:56:40] reputation is scarred so that when they
[1:56:43] make their way back to God nobody still
[1:56:45] has any use for them and holds their
[1:56:47] past against them forever what good does
[1:56:49] that
[1:56:50] serve TOS her said none bury it forever
[1:56:53] find a little garden out back a little
[1:56:55] spot somewhere and when somebody comes
[1:56:57] around with an evil story take it out
[1:56:59] and bury it and say here lies in peace
[1:57:01] the story about my brother God will take
[1:57:04] care of it he said with what judgment
[1:57:06] you
[1:57:08] judge if you want to be good if you want
[1:57:11] God to be good to you this is
[1:57:13] toer if you want God to be good to you
[1:57:15] you're going to have to be good to his
[1:57:18] children you say but that's not Grace
[1:57:20] well he said Grace get you into the
[1:57:22] kingdom of God unmerited favor but after
[1:57:25] you are seated at the father's table
[1:57:28] listen he expects to teach you some
[1:57:30] table
[1:57:33] manners I'm going to read that again
[1:57:36] Grace gets you into the kingdom of God
[1:57:38] unmar favor but when you are seated
[1:57:41] after you're seated at the father's
[1:57:42] table he expects to teach you some table
[1:57:46] manners nobody's going to throw food at
[1:57:48] my
[1:57:50] table unless is me
[1:57:52] just
[1:57:53] kidding they're just
[1:57:56] manners and we don't have manners today
[1:57:58] like we used to
[1:58:00] have we were talking about it the other
[1:58:02] day where did that come from I don't
[1:58:03] know somebody decided no elbows on the
[1:58:07] table it's not a bad idea the way people
[1:58:10] lay around
[1:58:11] now come to church and lay
[1:58:15] around go to the table and lay
[1:58:17] around slouch
[1:58:19] around I wonder sometimes how people can
[1:58:22] see to
[1:58:24] drive have you ever seen how folks Drive
[1:58:27] these days they're so slouched down I'm
[1:58:29] wondering how their knees their legs
[1:58:31] must be tied in knots to get them down
[1:58:34] that far in the seat so that they have
[1:58:37] to reach up for the steering wheel
[1:58:39] anybody seen that going
[1:58:43] on that's ill-mannered in my
[1:58:49] estimation no hats at the table
[1:58:52] we heard all kinds of things growing
[1:58:55] up no dessert till you finish your
[1:59:00] plate I grew up in a in a house my
[1:59:03] mother's family where men ate
[1:59:07] first that was the way they did it men
[1:59:10] ate
[1:59:11] first what about children that's the way
[1:59:14] we do it now but that's not the way they
[1:59:15] did it then when I was a little boy the
[1:59:18] men sat at the table first and ate and
[1:59:20] then the women came and sat with the
[1:59:22] children o ouch terrible awful and fed
[1:59:28] the
[1:59:28] children while they
[1:59:31] ate I don't know that that's
[1:59:34] right but that's the way it used to
[1:59:37] be but God will teach you
[1:59:40] manners how to treat one
[1:59:43] another if you'll use him our Lord as
[1:59:45] the great
[1:59:46] example and he won't let you
[1:59:49] eat toer un unless you obey the
[1:59:52] etiquette of the table and what is that
[1:59:55] the etiquette of the table is that you
[1:59:57] don't tell stories about the brother who
[2:00:00] is sitting at the table with
[2:00:02] you no matter what his denomination or
[2:00:05] nationality or
[2:00:07] background you simply don't talk
[2:00:11] about your
[2:00:13] brother Proverbs 10:12 hatred stirs up
[2:00:18] stries but love coverest
[2:00:23] are you with me Amplified said hatred
[2:00:25] stirs up contentions but love covers all
[2:00:29] transgressions if someone is constantly
[2:00:31] dealing Inc
[2:00:33] contentions you can know that love is
[2:00:35] not involved Redemptive nature is not
[2:00:40] operating hello sir the Bible said
[2:00:43] that's more like
[2:00:44] hatred hatred stirs up contentions all
[2:00:47] the time love covers transgressions
[2:00:52] that word stries is translated as
[2:00:55] contentions quarrels and
[2:00:58] dissension hatred stirs up quarrels and
[2:01:02] Discord and
[2:01:05] dissension all of us have unhealed
[2:01:09] Parts we're working on them hidden
[2:01:12] faults as we read in the scripture few
[2:01:14] weeks ago and Psalm 19:12 who can
[2:01:17] understand his errors cleanse thou me
[2:01:20] from Secret faults
[2:01:22] we're cleansed by confession that is
[2:01:24] looking within our hearts to uncover
[2:01:27] deeper motivations if we are honest with
[2:01:30] ourselves we may discover for example
[2:01:32] that we're angry or fearful people
[2:01:34] despite how we otherwise wish to regard
[2:01:36] ourselves would you want to wake up one
[2:01:39] morning and realize that you are an
[2:01:40] angry
[2:01:44] person what you disguise perhaps as
[2:01:47] being
[2:01:50] opinionated has a root in
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:59] anger may have nothing to do with what
[2:02:01] you're angry
[2:02:03] about but that root of anger is
[2:02:06] there how would you like to wake up and
[2:02:09] recognize something like that about
[2:02:11] yourself that you're really a fearful
[2:02:15] person that a lot of your bumpy
[2:02:17] interactions with people are simply
[2:02:19] because you're operating in fear and
[2:02:21] their
[2:02:23] not and their lack of fear oh it's quiet
[2:02:28] maybe I'll take a little
[2:02:29] water their lack of
[2:02:35] fear offends
[2:02:38] you it agitates
[2:02:41] you the fact that there are people on
[2:02:43] your Pew that can face
[2:02:46] crisis as difficult as
[2:02:49] yours and come anyway
[2:02:53] and smile anyway and praise
[2:02:57] anyway can agitate your life if you're
[2:03:01] still operating in fear or
[2:03:04] anger it's exactly all I
[2:03:07] have it's all I have I only have one
[2:03:10] response stay with me a moment I only
[2:03:13] have one
[2:03:15] response I don't know what else to do
[2:03:18] how many of you facing situations you
[2:03:20] don't know what to do
[2:03:22] I only have one response I can't
[2:03:26] quit I can't lay out a
[2:03:30] church you come in here I I'm going I
[2:03:33] may be in Tennessee preaching next
[2:03:34] Sunday but what if you come in here the
[2:03:36] next Sunday and I'm not
[2:03:38] here and you ask somebody well where's
[2:03:40] the pastor well he just didn't feel like
[2:03:41] coming today he's dealing with some
[2:03:43] stuff what would you think of me you
[2:03:46] would undo it would unravel in your mind
[2:03:49] all the years of confidence that you
[2:03:51] have built up in me because you've seen
[2:03:53] me keep on ticking even after a
[2:03:56] licking all of a sudden you find out I
[2:03:59] just didn't
[2:04:00] come I'm taking a break I tell you I
[2:04:03] want to break somebody when they say
[2:04:05] that to me I'm taking a break from
[2:04:08] church church is not your problem you
[2:04:11] bring your problem which is you bring it
[2:04:13] on to church and give God an opportunity
[2:04:16] to do something with
[2:04:19] it what what if what if brother GRE got
[2:04:22] up here two weeks from now and said I'm
[2:04:23] sorry brother shelle's taking a break
[2:04:25] today he just really dealing with some
[2:04:27] stuff and just really didn't f up well
[2:04:29] isn't that what a vacation is no not for
[2:04:31] me because stuff follows
[2:04:34] me like it does you no I mean just for
[2:04:38] the sake of I'm dealing with something
[2:04:40] folks there's not anybody in this
[2:04:43] place even little Eliana who's not a
[2:04:46] year old she's dealing with
[2:04:49] something it's either hunger or wet
[2:04:52] diaper
[2:04:55] now everybody in here is dealing with
[2:04:58] something but I don't know what response
[2:05:01] we can have except that I'm going to
[2:05:04] just stretch my arms wide a't that what
[2:05:08] we were
[2:05:09] singing come on my
[2:05:12] soul don't you get shy on
[2:05:16] me I've only got one response and that
[2:05:20] is to praise the Lord
[2:05:23] when it's going good and when it's not
[2:05:25] going good what will I do I have no
[2:05:28] choice and really I'm not the only one
[2:05:32] who has no other choice you're a
[2:05:36] Believer you the first day you lick your
[2:05:39] wounds and feel sorry for yourself 12
[2:05:42] out of the 24
[2:05:45] hours it'll be 18 out of 24 the next day
[2:05:50] come on it's just the the way it works
[2:05:52] but if I don't act like I'm struggling
[2:05:55] people won't know that I am the reality
[2:05:58] is we're not
[2:06:00] performing we're pressing
[2:06:03] in oh somebody's got to
[2:06:08] press in fact a bunch of
[2:06:11] somebody's
[2:06:13] press toward the
[2:06:16] Mark it's a prize the prize is not being
[2:06:19] a a a a good Christian the prize is
[2:06:24] Christ he's the trophy are you with me
[2:06:28] good that was our number
[2:06:32] one if you find yourself unable to let
[2:06:35] something go for instance some pain or
[2:06:37] failure of the past remind yourself that
[2:06:39] you must do so if you want to move on
[2:06:41] with your life here's the problem some
[2:06:43] folks don't
[2:06:45] change make sure you hear this
[2:06:48] sir some folks don't change
[2:06:52] they want to be forgiven for the past
[2:06:54] while they keep repeating similar
[2:06:59] Behavior you got to deal with the
[2:07:02] root and I'll tell you what we discover
[2:07:06] the root of a lot of our stuff and why
[2:07:09] we still carry it is
[2:07:11] pride and nobody wants to jump up and
[2:07:14] say I'm filled with pride most of us
[2:07:17] feel that our pride has been crushed and
[2:07:19] crushed and crushed and crushed but the
[2:07:21] reality is we've just sort of driven it
[2:07:25] deeper can't afford for anybody to
[2:07:28] know God wants to help us if you find
[2:07:32] this to be a hopeless message you're not
[2:07:34] listening to the entirety there's so
[2:07:36] much hope in this I mean it because
[2:07:40] everything we hope for is found in
[2:07:43] trusting
[2:07:44] him focusing on how things could have
[2:07:47] been
[2:07:48] different is to be enslaved
[2:07:53] to a past that you cannot now
[2:07:56] alter the goal of scriptural
[2:08:00] repentance Tesa is to turn us back to
[2:08:04] God for
[2:08:05] life but to do this we must be willing
[2:08:08] to let go of what makes us
[2:08:11] sick that's one of the ways that we can
[2:08:13] guard our heart is through the
[2:08:16] practice of perfect love and perfect
[2:08:19] love is something that we will have to
[2:08:23] practice to cause it to
[2:08:27] bloom we have to choose
[2:08:30] it we have to choose
[2:08:34] Agape
[2:08:36] agapo we have to choose
[2:08:40] agapo until
[2:08:42] we can demonstrate
[2:08:45] it because that is the
[2:08:48] bridge to his perfect love flowing
[2:08:52] through us to somebody
[2:08:55] else the reality is love is a
[2:08:58] choice and we're faced all day long
[2:09:01] every day with reasons not to love
[2:09:05] somebody but there's something in us
[2:09:07] that constrains us can't explain
[2:09:12] it to this day there is a love in me and
[2:09:17] in you I'm
[2:09:18] sure even for someone who has betrayed
[2:09:22] you or wronged
[2:09:24] you even tried to destroy you and yet if
[2:09:28] there ever was a god-given
[2:09:31] love for that person you find it
[2:09:34] creeping up and out you find yourself
[2:09:37] thinking about them in a in a less harsh
[2:09:41] and less critical and more positive way
[2:09:43] and then you might find yourself praying
[2:09:45] for them yes because God gave you a love
[2:09:49] for them that you don't understand
[2:09:53] through the
[2:09:55] years we have been stolen from more than
[2:09:59] one
[2:10:00] time from more than one
[2:10:04] person we only called the police that I
[2:10:07] recall
[2:10:08] once and that was on a
[2:10:11] preacher who was stealing from us while
[2:10:15] we gave his homeless behind a place to
[2:10:19] sleep was that too carnal
[2:10:22] I cleaned that up for you in
[2:10:26] fact and then guess what I
[2:10:29] did I told
[2:10:32] him now get your stuff and
[2:10:35] get because I've called the
[2:10:38] police and they're on the
[2:10:40] way and you don't have long to get your
[2:10:43] stuff not
[2:10:45] mine please leave
[2:10:48] mine and and everybody else is off the
[2:10:50] campground that you took and get out of
[2:10:53] here as fast as you
[2:10:54] can the reality of what we had gone
[2:10:57] through as a family and a church family
[2:10:59] hit me some days later when my little
[2:11:01] children were playing with
[2:11:04] cars and one of the
[2:11:07] boys said to the other boy he called the
[2:11:10] name of the preacher and he said come on
[2:11:12] so and
[2:11:13] so I'm going to open the back door of
[2:11:15] the police car and you get in
[2:11:25] oh
[2:11:26] my that kind of infraction didn't just
[2:11:29] happen once it's happened multiple
[2:11:32] times but the reality is when God gives
[2:11:36] you a love for
[2:11:40] somebody I've I've worked hard to find
[2:11:42] one of those men I've been unable to
[2:11:45] find him to locate him for a couple of
[2:11:47] years now have no idea where he is but
[2:11:51] but I have a genuine desire to know how
[2:11:53] he's
[2:11:54] doing I want to know did he whip that
[2:11:57] thing did he overcome
[2:12:01] that did El Li to
[2:12:06] death did he find help and
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:10] hope you just can't help it sometime
[2:12:13] when God puts a love in your heart for
[2:12:16] somebody so use
[2:12:19] it by praying constructively for that
[2:12:23] person I want to introduce in the time
[2:12:26] that we have left this morning and I
[2:12:28] know we may have a visitor or two but uh
[2:12:32] we're never offended when people have to
[2:12:34] slip out but we don't you generally
[2:12:36] Rush on Sunday morning because we don't
[2:12:39] have a Sunday night service so we take
[2:12:40] our time and maybe we should post that
[2:12:43] on the sign so that everyone would
[2:12:45] know I'm going to skip a section of what
[2:12:48] I wanted to talk about in places a
[2:12:51] little bit later in the sequence I think
[2:12:53] it would better serve the continuity of
[2:12:56] what we're going to introduce this
[2:12:58] morning we're going to do a fairly
[2:13:01] comprehensive teaching on the spirit of
[2:13:03] offense over the next few services that
[2:13:06] we're
[2:13:07] here and in order to do that I want to
[2:13:10] just really break it down and help all
[2:13:13] of us to sort of understand I've been
[2:13:15] working through this for myself because
[2:13:18] the Bible tells us great peace have they
[2:13:20] which love the law of
[2:13:22] God and
[2:13:25] nothing nothing it didn't
[2:13:28] say nothing in the
[2:13:30] law it says nothing will shall by any
[2:13:34] means offend them they
[2:13:38] somehow grow
[2:13:40] up spiritually to become
[2:13:45] unoffendable let me use this example I'm
[2:13:49] not a skeptic
[2:13:51] when it comes to the
[2:13:54] supernatural I am a skeptic when it
[2:13:57] comes to people's interpretations of the
[2:14:01] supernatural but I'm not a skeptic when
[2:14:04] it comes to the
[2:14:06] supernatural if you tell me you saw an
[2:14:09] angel I usually say praise the
[2:14:12] Lord what did he look like I hope he was
[2:14:15] near
[2:14:17] me I don't know whether you did or not
[2:14:22] but because I
[2:14:23] have and many of the people that I trust
[2:14:27] have it would be easier for me to
[2:14:30] believe that you have than to believe
[2:14:32] you would stand Toe to Toe eye to eye to
[2:14:35] me and lie that you did when you didn't
[2:14:38] do you understand so I I because I know
[2:14:42] the supernatural in the sense that I've
[2:14:44] lived it and encountered it as some of
[2:14:46] you
[2:14:47] have when somebody tells me they have
[2:14:50] certain thing in intercession
[2:14:53] or I I just say praise the
[2:14:58] Lord I don't always necessarily agree
[2:15:01] with how people interpret what they
[2:15:03] see because if you pass anything through
[2:15:06] your
[2:15:09] opinion it's
[2:15:11] mixed and who has the victory enough to
[2:15:15] lay their opinion
[2:15:18] aside when they're describing what they
[2:15:21] felt or saw or heard well we all better
[2:15:25] come to a place where we can do that
[2:15:29] because it's vitally important for the
[2:15:31] future of Supernatural leadership among
[2:15:34] us if God's going to move the way we see
[2:15:37] him move the way we believe he can move
[2:15:39] we're going to have to come to a place
[2:15:41] where we can be a people are you
[2:15:44] here who are not tainting what they see
[2:15:47] or hear with their own thoughts
[2:15:51] but I believe it if if sister Megan
[2:15:54] comes and says brother Shelly I saw a
[2:15:56] blue flash of
[2:15:59] light what is blue well blue represents
[2:16:02] a spirit of
[2:16:03] Truth and I know that truth is present
[2:16:06] when the Gospel of Jesus Christ is being
[2:16:08] preached so I don't have a problem with
[2:16:11] that I'm not going to build a Doctrine
[2:16:13] about it I might not put it in the
[2:16:15] newsletter I might not come up here and
[2:16:18] talk about
[2:16:19] it but I might if I don't it doesn't
[2:16:22] mean I don't believe
[2:16:24] it but I'm not only responsible for what
[2:16:27] I believe I'm responsible in in helping
[2:16:30] you to believe
[2:16:31] it and if I'm not sure
[2:16:35] then you see brother brandham tells us
[2:16:38] for instance with some of those
[2:16:39] prophetic utterances and things that
[2:16:42] it's not to be rep repetitious it's not
[2:16:44] to be the same thing over and over again
[2:16:47] it's not just to be the quoting of
[2:16:50] scripture which we can all look up for
[2:16:52] ourselves but it should be
[2:16:55] more prophetic in the sense it tells us
[2:16:58] what to look for and when you see this
[2:17:00] you'll
[2:17:02] know doesn't mean that God can't work in
[2:17:05] different kinds of ways but I don't want
[2:17:07] to lose the point the point is when
[2:17:10] someone says I see this I felt that or I
[2:17:14] had a dream that I don't
[2:17:16] understand I told one the other
[2:17:19] day that some of the young couples that
[2:17:23] I was near that I don't
[2:17:27] understand it was about bears and
[2:17:30] friendly Bears of which I've never
[2:17:32] really met
[2:17:35] any if I can't understand it I just
[2:17:38] leave
[2:17:40] it but I believe in the Supernatural I
[2:17:43] believe God talks in dreams I believe
[2:17:44] God talks in Visions
[2:17:46] amen I'm just not skeptical so now when
[2:17:50] we come to this realm of
[2:17:55] offense it's easier for me to
[2:17:59] believe that you are
[2:18:02] genuinely wounded and
[2:18:05] hurt when you say you
[2:18:10] are sometimes I don't understand it when
[2:18:14] people tell me what hurt
[2:18:18] them my mind says oh goodness
[2:18:25] I is that
[2:18:29] all but I just can't imagine that
[2:18:32] someone would would want to carry
[2:18:36] something if it wasn't
[2:18:39] genuinely a hindrance to
[2:18:42] them I would think You' just
[2:18:44] automatically let it roll
[2:18:46] off and what causes some people such
[2:18:49] Brokenness and wounded
[2:18:52] you and I might have kicked it off a
[2:18:54] dozen times before
[2:18:58] lunch I get hate
[2:19:01] mail just like others
[2:19:05] do I can't believe what I
[2:19:09] hear or it'll get in
[2:19:12] me so I have to toughen my hide and I
[2:19:15] have to say you have to take The Good
[2:19:16] the Bad and the Ugly if you're going to
[2:19:18] be out there you understand what I'm
[2:19:20] saying
[2:19:21] saying I would just hope and
[2:19:25] pray that you would not put a
[2:19:32] pretense on your
[2:19:34] life and carry it if it wasn't rooted in
[2:19:38] some kind of
[2:19:42] reality if it's not real kick it
[2:19:49] off and what I'm I'm saying is you can't
[2:19:52] officially be
[2:19:54] offended at what you
[2:19:57] think somebody
[2:19:59] did or what you think they might have
[2:20:03] meant by what you think they
[2:20:07] did and it's like that gossip
[2:20:11] game you don't really know what really
[2:20:14] was said because somebody tells you what
[2:20:16] was said because if that has passed
[2:20:19] through one person used to be a lot no
[2:20:23] no just one I am I am so amazed sometime
[2:20:27] how one person young people you don't
[2:20:29] have to be old to
[2:20:31] forget young people can forget the
[2:20:35] details 20 minutes from when it
[2:20:38] happened and when they tell it you
[2:20:40] wouldn't even recognize the event you
[2:20:42] were
[2:20:45] there you pass after somebody and crush
[2:20:49] them when it wasn't even the the full
[2:20:53] reality of what happened you have added
[2:20:55] your perception and your understanding
[2:20:57] and
[2:20:59] your lack of memory and you've mixed it
[2:21:01] all in and you've made a soup and you're
[2:21:04] handing it to somebody and they may end
[2:21:06] up carrying it for weeks or
[2:21:11] years so my advice in a situation like
[2:21:14] that is is it
[2:21:17] necessary is it really necessary for you
[2:21:21] to tell somebody what somebody else said
[2:21:23] about
[2:21:27] them oh you don't know the answer to
[2:21:30] that I didn't hear amens or om or NOS or
[2:21:35] I'll tell you this if it's not necessary
[2:21:38] don't do
[2:21:40] it and if it's not
[2:21:43] Redemptive if it offers no opportunity
[2:21:47] for growth or
[2:21:49] change if you have have no
[2:21:52] Solutions I don't really need to know
[2:21:55] again all the
[2:21:58] problems do you
[2:22:01] understand is it
[2:22:07] kind if the same were said about you
[2:22:10] would it hurt you and wound you and
[2:22:12] cause you to
[2:22:15] struggle these are things we need to
[2:22:17] think about as we look toward understand
[2:22:20] understanding the spirit of offense we
[2:22:23] learned in this series already that the
[2:22:25] word offense comes from a Greek word
[2:22:30] scandalon like
[2:22:32] Scandal you might have this in the
[2:22:34] notes you might not meaning a stumbling
[2:22:38] block or a
[2:22:39] trap it's actually often used listen to
[2:22:42] this it's often used to describe the
[2:22:47] place where the
[2:22:49] bait is added to the Trap I'm going to
[2:22:53] say it again CU some of you weren't
[2:22:55] listening scandalon it means a stumbling
[2:22:58] block or a trap it actually often is
[2:23:01] used to describe the
[2:23:03] place where the
[2:23:05] bait is added to the Trap so if we were
[2:23:09] talking about fishing so to speak it
[2:23:12] would be the
[2:23:13] hook if we're talking about a a trap
[2:23:17] that drops down it'd be underneath the
[2:23:20] baset so to speak you lay the bait there
[2:23:23] and you prop up the trap and or o prop
[2:23:27] open the door and when the animal goes
[2:23:30] in to grab the bait and tries to start
[2:23:32] out the Trap is sprung and the and the
[2:23:36] door is shut and the animals
[2:23:38] trapped and that place where the bait
[2:23:41] lays is the
[2:23:43] scandalon it's the
[2:23:46] offense therefore others excuse me
[2:23:49] therefore offense can often become the
[2:23:52] bait that Satan will use to pull you the
[2:23:56] believer into his
[2:23:59] captivity brother sister you and I've
[2:24:01] got to have some discernment and we've
[2:24:03] got to make up our mind I'm not taking
[2:24:06] that
[2:24:07] bait or you're not
[2:24:12] listening you've been there
[2:24:15] before you've already been hurt you've
[2:24:18] already been offended you know what's
[2:24:20] about to
[2:24:22] happen as soon as the bait is
[2:24:26] laid you recognize the familiarity of
[2:24:29] what's about to take place and you my
[2:24:31] brother sister and me my brother sister
[2:24:34] we are faced immediately with a
[2:24:38] decision do I really want my little
[2:24:43] paw to be caught in the
[2:24:46] Trap do I really want to be a skin
[2:24:50] around somebody else's
[2:24:53] neck you know where I'm going is that
[2:24:56] little piece of
[2:24:58] cheese really worth my
[2:25:02] death you see that's this scandalon
[2:25:05] that's the word it's not just a trap but
[2:25:08] it's the place where the bait is laid in
[2:25:11] the Trap and the spirit of offense is is
[2:25:14] a baited
[2:25:17] trap because we're told grap peas have
[2:25:20] they which love and nothing shall offend
[2:25:22] them and yet we get offended nearly
[2:25:25] every day of our life is there anybody
[2:25:29] in here that hasn't been offended in the
[2:25:32] last 30 days with something you heard on
[2:25:36] the news or you saw or you heard or you
[2:25:40] perceived or like Papa Paul you saw
[2:25:44] people standing in a circle at a
[2:25:46] football game and you didn't understand
[2:25:48] that it was a huddle and you thought
[2:25:49] they were talking about
[2:25:55] you so the opportunity to be
[2:25:58] offended is an Ever
[2:26:01] reoccurring sort of thing
[2:26:05] amen
[2:26:07] repetitive it comes in the same door it
[2:26:10] comes through the same
[2:26:12] vessel it's dress sometime in the same
[2:26:15] words and phrases and expressions and
[2:26:19] what we have to do is when we recognize
[2:26:21] well we're not recognizing it very well
[2:26:24] because we didn't understand it to be a
[2:26:26] baited trap but if we can understand
[2:26:29] that like
[2:26:32] unforgiveness like Envy like
[2:26:35] jealousy like other things that we
[2:26:37] struggle with in our heart when we're
[2:26:39] trying to guard it and keep it clean the
[2:26:42] enemy baites us
[2:26:44] first and then my my my when we take the
[2:26:48] bait
[2:26:50] he slams the door shut and then we
[2:26:53] become the Geral on the wheel
[2:26:56] caught oh
[2:26:59] my I could be speaking about the seventh
[2:27:02] seal I could be talking about more of
[2:27:05] the third
[2:27:06] pull but since we're still learning to
[2:27:08] love one
[2:27:14] another you know we're here in this
[2:27:16] pyramid working our way to the top and
[2:27:19] after after we have become
[2:27:22] Godly which means just like
[2:27:26] God Peter and the prophet placed above
[2:27:31] that being just like God something
[2:27:36] called brotherly
[2:27:40] kindness brotherly
[2:27:43] love it's fraternal affection when we
[2:27:47] translate it to full English from the
[2:27:52] Greek it's recognizing that we're on the
[2:27:55] same
[2:27:56] team if you fail I
[2:28:00] fail if you trip I might
[2:28:03] trip if you don't succeed none of us
[2:28:07] succeed we are
[2:28:09] responsible as
[2:28:12] keepers not only first and foremost for
[2:28:14] our own mind but we are also somewhat
[2:28:19] responsible through the obligation and
[2:28:22] yet the privilege of Brotherly kindness
[2:28:26] fraternal love we are therefore
[2:28:30] responsible for the other
[2:28:37] Marines for the other team
[2:28:44] members if they fail we might
[2:28:48] fail does does anybody understand that
[2:28:52] so once you know brother sister that
[2:28:54] you're just like God I'm not going to
[2:28:56] ask you to raise your
[2:28:58] hand if you feel you've reached the full
[2:29:00] potential of
[2:29:02] godliness the the simplest description
[2:29:04] is just like God well God was never late
[2:29:08] he was always on time hello and God was
[2:29:12] never
[2:29:14] hoty he was
[2:29:16] righteous sometimes Stern and angry even
[2:29:19] but always righteous always
[2:29:24] upright he was not
[2:29:28] scandalous he wanted
[2:29:32] modesty so much so that he even taught
[2:29:35] the priest that they should be modest
[2:29:39] when climbing up and down the
[2:29:42] altar he required linen
[2:29:45] breaches underneath their
[2:29:48] ephod so they didn't show the nakedness
[2:29:51] of their thigh when they were climbing
[2:29:54] up to do the work of the
[2:29:55] Lord so we take all of the things we
[2:29:58] know about God into consideration and we
[2:30:01] understand that we have got to come to
[2:30:03] the measure of godliness before we
[2:30:06] before we rise above it to the place of
[2:30:09] Brotherly kindness and and who among us
[2:30:12] yet could say
[2:30:16] boldly that in me there is no doubt in
[2:30:19] me there is No Malice that in me there
[2:30:21] is no guile that in me there is no
[2:30:24] unforgiveness that in me there is no
[2:30:27] offense in me there is no anger in me
[2:30:30] there is no
[2:30:32] bitterness very few if
[2:30:36] any we all know each other too well to
[2:30:39] to fool each other about that
[2:30:42] right and once we get there we've got
[2:30:46] another Ladder rung to climb we've got
[2:30:49] another another place to move to and
[2:30:52] that's brotherly
[2:30:53] kindness and affection because you can
[2:30:56] be just like God in thought and word
[2:30:58] inde deed and still learning how to
[2:31:02] relate to your fellow
[2:31:05] brother or your fellow
[2:31:07] sister and we're going to come to that
[2:31:10] because the Capstone is not going to
[2:31:12] finish the pyramid in your life coming
[2:31:15] to the stature of a perfect man the
[2:31:17] perfect man which is Jesus Christ
[2:31:20] it's not a prophet of the Old Testament
[2:31:22] or the new it's not an apostle ancient
[2:31:26] or modern it's not a prophet ancient or
[2:31:28] modern the perfect man is Lord Jesus
[2:31:32] Christ and will'll never come into the
[2:31:35] stature and the fullness of who he is
[2:31:37] until we have been birthed from one
[2:31:41] virtue to the next and that means that
[2:31:43] even after we have become Godly we still
[2:31:46] have to learn how to deal with one
[2:31:47] another you think we have to wait until
[2:31:49] we're Godly practice learning how to
[2:31:51] treat each other no no no we better get
[2:31:53] at it
[2:31:59] yesterday when you see somebody doing
[2:32:02] something wrong I mean doing something
[2:32:05] that you know how to do and they're
[2:32:07] doing it wrong would you
[2:32:11] gloat would you flash them a look of
[2:32:15] hate or or would you in tenderness
[2:32:24] say that chord is
[2:32:32] f you don't plant that like
[2:32:40] that that's not how you
[2:32:45] make that pattern is not made that way
[2:32:49] you you don't don't put the sleeve
[2:32:53] first something you know how to
[2:32:57] do are you more likely to want somebody
[2:33:00] to try and
[2:33:02] flop if you are it's Pride if we get
[2:33:06] that way it's because we have too much
[2:33:09] pride and you would think that when
[2:33:12] someone got to to my
[2:33:16] age they would be thinking about helping
[2:33:20] someone
[2:33:21] succeed instead of
[2:33:24] delighting when they
[2:33:26] fail this comes from a root of
[2:33:31] Pride you can apologize again and again
[2:33:34] but if the root of that is not dealt
[2:33:36] with you'll just repeat that behavior
[2:33:39] over and over
[2:33:43] again you can make fun of me because I
[2:33:46] don't know how to do a certain thing
[2:33:51] if I can be still long enough you can
[2:33:53] help me learn how to do a certain thing
[2:33:55] or you can be like Brother David
[2:33:57] man and just do it for
[2:34:02] [Music]
[2:34:04] me but surely Brother David you wouldn't
[2:34:07] go home to your wife and say why that
[2:34:10] Pastor of
[2:34:13] ours messed up that song this
[2:34:16] morning preach 10 minutes longer than
[2:34:19] the long
[2:34:20] EST and to beat it all he can't even fix
[2:34:23] his own
[2:34:30] faucet in the scheme of life that
[2:34:32] doesn't really matter that he says
[2:34:35] that but it reveals
[2:34:38] something your heart will tell on you my
[2:34:41] heart will tell on
[2:34:44] me I told you an example I've said this
[2:34:47] several times I don't even really want
[2:34:48] to think about it because it affected
[2:34:52] me I one time saw one of my own children
[2:34:55] struggling to get in the door of this
[2:34:57] church with armfuls of stuff that they
[2:35:00] were bringing in that didn't belong to
[2:35:02] them but they were bringing it in and I
[2:35:05] watched
[2:35:06] adults not one but several this was
[2:35:09] years ago but don't
[2:35:12] worry years ago but I was I was far
[2:35:16] enough away that I couldn't get to him
[2:35:18] in time
[2:35:20] but I watched
[2:35:22] adults pause and
[2:35:25] watch one of my children struggle to try
[2:35:28] to open the
[2:35:30] door with a
[2:35:32] key while holding all these things I
[2:35:36] watched an adult pass within three feet
[2:35:38] of them and and watch them turn and see
[2:35:41] what they were doing but rather than to
[2:35:43] take a minute to offer a
[2:35:45] hand turn their head and walk on
[2:35:52] it reveals something to
[2:35:55] me for whatever reason Envy jealousy
[2:35:59] Strife something I had done probably
[2:36:03] probably had nothing to do with what
[2:36:05] that child had done it was probably more
[2:36:07] directed toward me than them but they
[2:36:10] just watched them
[2:36:12] struggle they would have rather them
[2:36:15] dropped somebody else's stuff perhaps
[2:36:22] then to give one second five seconds let
[2:36:25] me hold that while you get the door let
[2:36:27] me take the key and get the door for you
[2:36:29] it reveals something to me I don't want
[2:36:31] to be that
[2:36:33] person I can't afford to be that person
[2:36:38] that's right I can't afford to let
[2:36:40] something that has no relativity to what
[2:36:43] I'm dealing with now has nothing to do
[2:36:45] with it I can't afford to let that
[2:36:47] shadow my reaction
[2:36:50] now because I've left a root untended
[2:36:53] undug out something UND with in my life
[2:36:56] an
[2:36:59] offense I can't take out on your
[2:37:04] children what I know you've
[2:37:07] done if I forgive you if I've turned it
[2:37:11] loose and you and me the same you
[2:37:13] forgiven me whatever the infractions
[2:37:15] were along the way if we've done that
[2:37:17] you don't want my children to pay for
[2:37:19] what I've done that you've already
[2:37:20] forgiven me of I don't want your
[2:37:22] children to pay for what I've already
[2:37:25] forgiven you of are you here I know this
[2:37:28] is far too real we need more third pool
[2:37:32] preaching right now we need more we
[2:37:34] because we haven't heard that for the
[2:37:36] last 40 years so we need to hear this is
[2:37:39] what preachers do go right back to the
[2:37:41] same thing that they keep saying over
[2:37:43] and over again the problem and the
[2:37:45] reality is no one's really getting any
[2:37:48] closer to manifesting that because
[2:37:51] nobody wants to take the
[2:37:53] time and brother brandom never called
[2:37:56] offense a spirit so how could you get up
[2:37:58] and teach a whole lesson on the spirit
[2:38:00] of offense because it's just we could
[2:38:03] call it the nature of being
[2:38:08] offended there are just certain
[2:38:10] expressions and words that weren't used
[2:38:12] but it doesn't mean that the principle
[2:38:14] is not the same and here's how we're
[2:38:17] going to identify it in the scripture
[2:38:20] off fence like the bait in a trap is
[2:38:25] harmless if we ignore
[2:38:30] it well so and so's talking about you
[2:38:33] okay they've got a good
[2:38:36] subject and go
[2:38:38] on don't take the bait I wish you'd have
[2:38:41] heard what they said don't take the bait
[2:38:45] in fact be bold and say I'm not taking
[2:38:48] the bait do it I dare you I dare you if
[2:38:52] you're going to be offensive be this
[2:38:54] kind of offensive I'm not taking the
[2:38:56] bait it may be true and it may be ugly
[2:38:59] and it may be dark but I can't afford to
[2:39:02] poison
[2:39:05] myself I'm not taking the
[2:39:09] bait just not going to do it it's
[2:39:12] harmless if we if we ignore
[2:39:16] it but it's deadly
[2:39:19] when we consume
[2:39:21] it that little that little mouse just
[2:39:23] had to have the cheese he just had to
[2:39:26] have the peanut butter you and I just
[2:39:29] had to have the tea we had to have the
[2:39:32] details we had to know what was going
[2:39:34] around what was being said about us so
[2:39:37] we lingered and we asked questions and
[2:39:39] we listened to every
[2:39:43] morsel and it poisoned us
[2:39:51] the meaning of the English word offense
[2:39:53] is
[2:39:54] annoyance or resentment brought about by
[2:39:56] a perceived insult or disregard of
[2:40:00] oneself do you know that something may
[2:40:02] not even be intended to disregard
[2:40:05] us or to insult
[2:40:08] us but because we carry this tendency
[2:40:12] and predisposition to easily be offended
[2:40:15] we make it what we perceive it to be
[2:40:19] and then punish
[2:40:22] somebody the synonyms for offense here
[2:40:25] they are I think I gave you these
[2:40:29] annoyance
[2:40:31] anger
[2:40:33] resentment
[2:40:36] indignation you've got my righteous
[2:40:38] indignation stirred I hear people say as
[2:40:40] long as it's righteous but I kind of
[2:40:43] doubt it
[2:40:45] irritation irritation is a synonym for
[2:40:48] offense
[2:40:50] we who are easily irritated I said we I
[2:40:53] led with we I started with
[2:40:58] we there may be a
[2:41:03] root
[2:41:08] exasperation when my children were
[2:41:10] growing up I didn't allow
[2:41:15] sighing I was told many years ago that
[2:41:17] sighing could be a sign of
[2:41:20] demonization so I didn't let our
[2:41:22] children go around
[2:41:24] that it really serves little purpose
[2:41:27] it's not a good breath if you're going
[2:41:29] to breathe for life that's not a good
[2:41:32] one it's more like a despairing moan
[2:41:35] don't do it have faith hold on to God
[2:41:39] Wrath displeasure disapproval
[2:41:44] dislike hard bad or ill feelings disg
[2:41:49] grtl men animosity vexation aversion
[2:41:53] opposition and enmity all of these
[2:41:56] English synonyms for
[2:42:00] offense generally it means to feel
[2:42:02] annoyed or hurt by something or from
[2:42:06] what someone said or did are you
[2:42:09] following me a spirit of offense refers
[2:42:12] to a condition where a person is
[2:42:14] sometimes
[2:42:15] trapped I hope there'll be at least one
[2:42:18] person who will recognize that you have
[2:42:21] once been there in your life and
[2:42:23] hopefully thank God you can say I'm not
[2:42:25] living in that trap
[2:42:28] anymore a spirit of offense refers to a
[2:42:31] condition where a person is sometimes
[2:42:33] trapped by hurt feelings bitterness or
[2:42:37] unforgiveness leading to relational and
[2:42:41] spiritual
[2:42:45] damage I don't want to carry a spirit of
[2:42:47] offense and the bride said let's look at
[2:42:51] Ephesians you know this well few more
[2:42:53] minutes and we're
[2:42:55] done Ephesians 611 put on the whole
[2:42:58] armor of God that you may be able to
[2:43:01] stand
[2:43:02] against the Ws of the devil for we
[2:43:05] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[2:43:09] against principalities against Powers
[2:43:12] against the rulers of the darkness of
[2:43:14] this world against spiritual wickedness
[2:43:16] in high places guess what honey it's not
[2:43:18] your brother
[2:43:19] brother it's not your sister not your
[2:43:22] husband not your wife not your children
[2:43:24] not your
[2:43:26] neighbor it's the enemy that wants you
[2:43:28] to be offended and hurt and wounded and
[2:43:31] become angry and bitter and unforgiving
[2:43:34] he's out to seow seeds of discrepancy in
[2:43:38] your
[2:43:39] garden he's waiting for you to leave a
[2:43:42] moment unguarded so that he can come
[2:43:45] in and cause you to perceive something
[2:43:49] that may or may not be the truth
[2:43:51] recently I've heard more than one person
[2:43:53] saying I just know everybody in the
[2:43:55] church is talking about
[2:43:58] me you flatter yourself you
[2:44:05] do it
[2:44:07] probably is not the case and you
[2:44:11] probably know that it's not the case but
[2:44:13] the enemy keeps trying to bait you
[2:44:20] right and if you think that there is
[2:44:22] truth to it maybe you would practice
[2:44:26] doing less dumb things and letting
[2:44:30] somebody spread
[2:44:35] it you don't want to carry
[2:44:39] that so that you constantly
[2:44:43] feel the
[2:44:45] scrutiny of everybody around you because
[2:44:48] then if you you carry that it doesn't
[2:44:50] matter how many people look you in the
[2:44:52] eye and say I love you sister I love you
[2:44:54] brother you'll never be able to believe
[2:44:58] them I think that's the saddest thing
[2:45:01] about carrying a spirit of offense is
[2:45:03] you're never able really to receive love
[2:45:06] from
[2:45:07] anybody because you can't trust anybody
[2:45:11] because you've been so wounded Jesus
[2:45:13] Jesus Jesus this disturbs me in my
[2:45:17] spirit when I even talk about it I don't
[2:45:19] want to be warped into this kind of
[2:45:23] creature that can't receive love I need
[2:45:26] to know he loves me at times I need to
[2:45:29] know my family loves me at times I need
[2:45:32] to know my brothers and sisters love
[2:45:36] me and if I'm
[2:45:39] carrying continuing to carry the
[2:45:45] perceived offense
[2:45:49] we've got a way to do deal with some of
[2:45:51] this stuff musicians start this way
[2:45:53] would
[2:45:54] you I didn't get very
[2:46:03] far we're not fighting flesh and
[2:46:06] blood but principalities Powers rulers
[2:46:10] of oh yeah there they go again there
[2:46:13] they go again all that talk about
[2:46:15] spiritual warfare where do they find
[2:46:17] that in the message of the hour
[2:46:19] a lot of places in
[2:46:21] fact I didn't bring them all with me
[2:46:24] this morning didn't think I'd get to
[2:46:25] them but I can boil them down into one
[2:46:28] summary by saying he told us over and
[2:46:31] over again this is not a picnic
[2:46:35] right this is a
[2:46:38] battlefield if you come thinking that
[2:46:40] you're going to have listen even a good
[2:46:42] picnic it's often spoiled by uninvited
[2:46:46] guests
[2:46:47] correct this is is a battlefield and the
[2:46:50] battle is not flesh and blood the battle
[2:46:53] is against principalities and power
[2:46:55] spiritual wickedness in high places the
[2:46:57] battle is with your accuser the battle
[2:46:59] is with a
[2:47:01] lie you'll never win a battle with a lie
[2:47:05] with another lie you'll only win a
[2:47:06] battle with a Lie by telling the truth
[2:47:09] speak the truth into
[2:47:13] that if you allow the enemy to squeeze
[2:47:16] you to that place you'll you'll you'll
[2:47:18] be the person nobody loves me and
[2:47:21] everybody hates me and everybody's out
[2:47:22] to get
[2:47:23] me you see that can lead to mental
[2:47:27] illness it not only affects and stunts
[2:47:30] our growth spiritually but it can cause
[2:47:32] us to go running madly through the
[2:47:34] woods thinking that we're being pursued
[2:47:37] the scripture said so thinking that
[2:47:40] we're being pursued when no one is
[2:47:41] pursuing
[2:47:43] us it can run us into the throws of
[2:47:46] mental illness we don't want to to go
[2:47:49] there let it go let it go brother
[2:47:52] brandom taught us and we have been
[2:47:54] taught otherwise what you do then is you
[2:47:57] you recognize that
[2:47:59] complex and you move in the opposite of
[2:48:04] it rather than that people own it and
[2:48:07] they say things like you know I'm an I
[2:48:09] wear my feelings on my sleeve for
[2:48:11] heaven's
[2:48:12] sakes don't confess that even if it's
[2:48:16] the truth of your present reality don't
[2:48:18] confess that I wear my feelings on my
[2:48:21] sleeve tuck them
[2:48:24] away say I'm going to be undefendable in
[2:48:27] this last day I have to be I can't let
[2:48:31] my mind go there see when I said about
[2:48:33] it's easier to believe in the
[2:48:34] Supernatural it should be easier for all
[2:48:37] of us to believe that he didn't mean
[2:48:41] that she didn't mean that the way I took
[2:48:45] it he didn't mean that the way I
[2:48:47] interpreted it
[2:48:51] and if we if we start judging
[2:48:54] motives that's when we offend Matthew
[2:48:57] 7 is that right Matthew 7 judge
[2:49:02] not you see that's not talking about
[2:49:04] judging with a spiritual and righteous
[2:49:06] judgment if you look at that in the
[2:49:08] original you'll find that it means
[2:49:10] judging someone's motives and you better
[2:49:12] be careful how you judge someone else's
[2:49:15] motives because your motives will be
[2:49:17] judged the same way
[2:49:20] well I know what he said but I know what
[2:49:21] he
[2:49:22] meant I'm pretty sure I know why she
[2:49:25] said
[2:49:27] that have you ever heard that I'm pretty
[2:49:30] sure I know why he did
[2:49:33] that I know what's in
[2:49:35] there I know him better than he knows
[2:49:40] his that was when a brother and I ended
[2:49:44] up unfortunately parting ways
[2:49:49] when he told me I know you better than
[2:49:51] you know
[2:49:54] yourself unless you are the Holy Spirit
[2:49:57] that's not likely to be the truth but he
[2:50:01] does he knows my ins and outs my U
[2:50:04] risings and my downfalls he knows how to
[2:50:07] talk to me he knows how to whip me he
[2:50:11] knows how to whisper and he and you the
[2:50:13] same nobody know nobody knows your
[2:50:16] children like you know them you live
[2:50:17] with them all the time
[2:50:20] God knows you brother he knows you
[2:50:22] sister he knows you he's believing the
[2:50:24] best about you but he knows whatever is
[2:50:27] he knows the reality but he chooses to
[2:50:30] know because he's an omniscient God he
[2:50:32] knows you're not going to stay in that
[2:50:33] mess he knows somebody is going to
[2:50:35] present some truth to you and you're
[2:50:37] going to make up your mind to stop
[2:50:40] taking the devil's bait so yes spiritual
[2:50:43] warfare is true and I want to close by
[2:50:45] giving you this definition
[2:50:49] spiritual war oh it's a long one I must
[2:50:52] have wrote
[2:50:54] it spiritual warfare is the
[2:50:58] believer's active engagement in the
[2:51:02] spiritual
[2:51:04] realm there's a lot of commment so I
[2:51:06] promise you I did using the authority of
[2:51:10] Christ the power of the Holy Spirit and
[2:51:14] the word of God to confront and over
[2:51:18] overcome the forces of
[2:51:20] Darkness including Satan demons and
[2:51:23] their influence over individuals
[2:51:26] circumstances and
[2:51:28] systems in order to advance God's
[2:51:31] kingdom and bring about spiritual
[2:51:34] Victory freedom and
[2:51:37] restoration the key to that definition
[2:51:40] is active
[2:51:42] engagement there's a Warfare going on
[2:51:45] and if you choose not to engage
[2:51:49] you
[2:51:52] lose you give him the
[2:51:54] victory you give the accuser the upper
[2:51:57] hand the only way it's a fair fight is
[2:52:01] if you raise up and determine to engage
[2:52:05] the
[2:52:06] Enemy by using the weapons that God has
[2:52:10] given us to not only deter him but to
[2:52:13] defeat him God's word is enough
[2:52:19] if a life is behind it to defeat the
[2:52:23] enemy in every
[2:52:26] situation don't take the bait look at
[2:52:30] your neighbor and say don't take the
[2:52:35] bait in fact let me tell you this before
[2:52:38] this day is
[2:52:41] over 25% of us or more are going to have
[2:52:47] an opportunity
[2:52:49] to be
[2:52:53] offended some of us are going to go to
[2:52:55] lunch they're going to see the way some
[2:52:56] of you ladies are dressed and they're
[2:52:58] going to judge you immediately your
[2:53:00] legalists your your your pilgrims your
[2:53:03] menites your Amish your your you
[2:53:06] certainly believe that the way you dress
[2:53:08] has brought your salvation you might
[2:53:10] even hear them
[2:53:13] Whispering you might find that the
[2:53:16] waitress is just rude for no reason
[2:53:19] simply because of what you
[2:53:22] carry that reminds her of what she
[2:53:28] doesn't they're going to stare they
[2:53:31] always do if a woman has more than two
[2:53:36] children she's a gazing stock at
[2:53:39] Walmart one sister told me years ago I'm
[2:53:42] never taking my children to Walmart
[2:53:44] again well I don't blame you who'd want
[2:53:45] to do that anyway but you don't always
[2:53:48] have an option so you load them up and
[2:53:50] you take them well people look people
[2:53:53] make comments when people see I have
[2:53:55] more than two children they make comment
[2:53:57] they call me the
[2:54:00] Duggers they ask me am I after a
[2:54:03] television show you I don't know what's
[2:54:05] going to
[2:54:07] happen sister Sandy did you cook lunch
[2:54:11] Cassandra sister Cassandra did you make
[2:54:13] lunch today are you all eating out or
[2:54:14] what are you
[2:54:16] doing oh you're going home to
[2:54:19] cook that could be your opportunity
[2:54:22] Brother
[2:54:28] David don't be offended if it's not your
[2:54:31] favorite and if he didn't particularly
[2:54:34] like what she
[2:54:36] cooks don't stomp too
[2:54:40] hard I don't know I don't know what's
[2:54:43] but in the likelihood of Life all of us
[2:54:45] are going to have an opportunity and and
[2:54:47] here's your here here is your word of
[2:54:50] advice two hours of it boil down into
[2:54:53] one minute just determine I'm not taking
[2:54:56] the
[2:55:02] bait I'm just not going to take the
[2:55:05] bait I just refuse to take the bait I'm
[2:55:08] going to keep peace I'm going to stay in
[2:55:10] Shalom I'm going to restore my
[2:55:12] joy I'm going to use the authority that
[2:55:14] I have through the blood through the
[2:55:17] word through the name
[2:55:19] to defeat the thoughts that the enemy
[2:55:21] tries to use look they're talking about
[2:55:23] you look they're they didn't invite you
[2:55:26] look there there must be a reason they
[2:55:28] must have a
[2:55:30] motive they must want to talk about your
[2:55:33] family that's why they didn't include
[2:55:34] you because if they included you they
[2:55:35] couldn't talk about
[2:55:38] you it gets darker and darker and darker
[2:55:41] doesn't it I'm I I'm not taking the bait
[2:55:50] I'm not taking the
[2:55:53] bait if the enemy tells you your wife
[2:55:55] doesn't love you you tell him he's a
[2:55:57] liar she wouldn't stayed with you if she
[2:55:58] hadn't loved you she's already been
[2:56:01] through the roughest Parts praise God
[2:56:03] hallelujah vice
[2:56:07] versa in biblical spiritual warfare
[2:56:10] several things are emphasized prayer and
[2:56:12] intercession using the word as a weapon
[2:56:15] and defense the gifts of the Spirit such
[2:56:18] as
[2:56:19] discernment intercession and deliverance
[2:56:21] and the believer's Reliance on the blood
[2:56:24] of Jesus and the armor of God in
[2:56:26] Ephesians 6 can become incredible tools
[2:56:30] to use against the enemy when he tries
[2:56:33] to bring you under the influence of a
[2:56:35] spirit of
[2:56:37] offense spiritual warfare involves
[2:56:39] engaging the enemy through God's power
[2:56:42] and
[2:56:43] authority addressing strongholds like a
[2:56:46] fence and its part partnering spirits
[2:56:49] and we're going to talk about those a
[2:56:50] little bit later in the study because
[2:56:52] the enemy never tries to overcome us
[2:56:55] with only one thing he sends
[2:56:59] twins he sends
[2:57:02] triplets he sends a host and one
[2:57:06] piggybacks compliments and
[2:57:09] operates through the
[2:57:11] other and you get lower and lower and
[2:57:13] lower in your level of Victory and
[2:57:16] praise there's so much hope in this
[2:57:18] because God has given us everything we
[2:57:20] need to defeat the enemy if we only take
[2:57:24] the time above all
[2:57:27] else to guard this part of our spiritual
[2:57:32] life I've looked through the Bible Old
[2:57:35] Testament and New Testament do you know
[2:57:37] how
[2:57:38] many instances of
[2:57:40] offense
[2:57:44] hundreds hundreds
[2:57:48] before I went to bed last night I was
[2:57:50] going through one of the
[2:57:51] [Music]
[2:57:53] Psalms where
[2:57:55] David was
[2:57:58] lamenting and he said something like
[2:58:01] this in paraphrase if it would have come
[2:58:03] from one of my
[2:58:05] enemies have you ever been there I could
[2:58:09] have handled it so much better but it
[2:58:12] came from someone that I loved so dearly
[2:58:15] someone that I had had Fellowship with
[2:58:19] in spiritual
[2:58:21] things who's been
[2:58:24] there but nonetheless he had to overcome
[2:58:27] it because he recognized that God used
[2:58:31] that enemy to set up a situation with
[2:58:35] Absalom that needed to be dealt with
[2:58:38] once and for
[2:58:41] all
[2:58:43] Joseph couldn't he have died a bitter
[2:58:46] old man for how he was
[2:58:49] treated and yet he said what you meant
[2:58:52] for against me for evil God had a plan
[2:58:55] and he saved many
[2:58:58] people because of your jealousy you
[2:59:00] offended me you thought you were putting
[2:59:02] me down in the pit of offense that I
[2:59:05] couldn't get out of and God sent
[2:59:07] strangers
[2:59:09] Gentiles to come and lift me up out of
[2:59:11] the pit and now when I walk in a
[2:59:14] room the crowd bows their knee and says
[2:59:18] hail Joseph Prince of Egypt come on and
[2:59:22] God didn't do any of that just to exalt
[2:59:24] me as a man he did it to save a nation
[2:59:27] of people so you if you hadn't to come
[2:59:30] against me the way you did can you see
[2:59:32] yourself
[2:59:34] embracing can you see yourself embracing
[2:59:37] the very on they tried to
[2:59:40] repent they're walking out of Egypt
[2:59:42] they're coming along and they tried to
[2:59:44] repent and he didn't want to talk about
[2:59:46] it
[2:59:49] he wasn't
[2:59:51] superhuman he just believed the word can
[2:59:54] you imagine trying to apologize and
[2:59:57] repent and the person who who you need
[3:00:00] to apologize to they don't even want to
[3:00:02] hear what you have to say because they
[3:00:04] have already come to realize if you
[3:00:06] hadn't
[3:00:09] enough I wouldn't be where I
[3:00:14] am and because of that I had to get a
[3:00:18] hold of God I had to put my confidence
[3:00:21] in him and not in
[3:00:22] man and he brought me through and he'll
[3:00:25] bring me through the next
[3:00:27] time so I don't know if I'm to the place
[3:00:30] that I can say thank you for
[3:00:33] yielding but I can say I don't need to
[3:00:35] talk about
[3:00:36] it it's no longer a rude in me this is
[3:00:39] how Joseph handled it and you and I can
[3:00:42] do the same by God's Redemptive Grace

[3:12:42] Lord for so many of us we have to

[3:12:50] comprehend that kind of love whereby you
[3:12:54] have loved us we stand in awe today Lord
[3:12:59] of that unfathomable love it reaches
[3:13:04] farther than we can imagine and it has

[3:13:28] shown When we struggle to show that love
[3:13:31] to others help us in this hour to grow
[3:13:35] up to a place where we can be conduits
[3:13:40] for your love to flow into us and
[3:13:44] through us to someone else Lord Here We
[3:13:47] Stand today you said in your word two
[3:13:51] place in the gospels that it is
[3:13:54] impossible but that offenses will come
[3:13:58] translated it says to us that it is
[3:14:02] inevitable we're going to be offended
[3:14:05] we're going to have things happen that
[3:14:08] we don't understand and that wound us
[3:14:12] emotionally but lord it's not whether or
[3:14:15] not we have offence is coming our way
[3:14:19] it's how we deal with them it's how we
[3:14:22] react to them it's whether or not we
[3:14:24] continue in them or whether we step
[3:14:28] above them and take you at your word of
[3:14:31] Grace and go forward I pray right now
[3:14:35] across this room and those streaming

[3:15:04] who have wrongfully used us are spoken
[3:15:08] maliciously against us ultimately we
[3:15:12] want to see them redeemed and set free
[3:15:16] from the anger or from the bitterness
[3:15:20] resentment or rejection that has caused
[3:15:23] them to be offensive in their words and
