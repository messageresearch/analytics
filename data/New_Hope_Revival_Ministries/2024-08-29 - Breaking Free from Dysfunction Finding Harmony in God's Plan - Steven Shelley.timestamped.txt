[0:00] it's about learning to move together for
[0:03] the purposes of the Kingdom if you're a
[0:05] person who thinks about the kingdom let
[0:07] me tell you what you should be thinking
[0:09] about first and foremost your family did
[0:14] you know family a spiritual family a
[0:17] holy ghost family is a part of the
[0:19] kingdom of God it's a very important
[0:22] part of the government structure of the
[0:25] kingdom of God for for strong families
[0:29] to turn by the power of the Holy Ghost
[0:32] dysfunction into Super
[0:35] function we we don't use this
[0:37] dysfunctional word as an excuse to stay
[0:40] handicapped we say I I've taken what has
[0:45] fallen upon me but I don't intend to
[0:47] keep it I'm not going to hold on to it
[0:50] I'm going to turn loose of it as fast as
[0:52] I can and I'm going to believe that my
[0:54] family will not be handicapped by the
[0:57] past but but charged supercharged Ed
[1:00] anointed and and
[1:02] wise God wants your life Satan does not
[1:07] God wants your life to go forward in
[1:11] Harmony in shalom in peace all aspects
[1:16] of your life he wants them to flow
[1:19] together and only he can help you to
[1:23] bring that to
[1:24] pass there's a spirit that operates in
[1:28] this realm sometime that causes people
[1:30] to thrive they think in
[1:34] chaos you're not
[1:36] thriving you're not even fulfilling 1%
[1:41] of your destiny purpose if you're moving
[1:44] constantly in instability and confusion
[1:48] so every day that you go to bed and you
[1:50] think woo I got something done today
[1:52] just know that it was a small portion of
[1:56] what God will do through you is if
[2:00] you'll let him
[2:01] deal with the
[2:03] confusion with a familiar spirit that
[2:06] likes to hang that on a family for God
[2:08] is not the author of confusion but of
[2:11] Peace in all
[2:14] churches he wants a church to move
[2:16] together in harmony he wants a family to
[2:19] move together how in harmony he wants a
[2:23] church to to be able to move forward
[2:25] without a constant disturbance he wants
[2:27] a family to be able to move forward
[2:29] without a constant disturbance to
[2:32] prosper this is not a Prosperity Gospel
[2:35] we're talking about tonight but I want
[2:37] you to know God has some good things
[2:38] that he wants to do in your life if
[2:41] you'll deal with what's stopping it
[2:44] that's just good advice if that's
[2:46] weirding you out you ought to come back
[2:49] to the word come back to the New
[2:51] Testament in fact and read what God has
[2:54] promised us if we claim it he promised
[2:57] that we would not only have life
[3:01] which is his life but that we would live
[3:04] life with his life more how
[3:09] abundantly the enemy wants you to live
[3:11] in a position of
[3:13] meager barely having enough I'm talking
[3:17] about spiritually physically come
[3:20] on but the but God has a better plan for
[3:23] you he does he does
