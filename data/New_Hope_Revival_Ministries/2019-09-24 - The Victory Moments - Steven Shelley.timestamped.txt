[0:00] there's only one way that you can
[0:02] mortify the deeds of the body and that
[0:04] is through the spirit you better not
[0:14] miss up now you better not slip up now
[0:17] hear me now
[0:18] you better run faster and harder and
[0:21] press with more determination and faith
[0:24] than you have ever pressed with before
[0:26] because there is a victory yet to be won
[0:29] we have a victory yet to be won that
[0:32] battle that greatest battle ever fought
[0:35] is yet to be won in the rear in the
[0:37] realm of reality it's won in the realm
[0:40] of the spirit and we are invited to
[0:43] fellowship with the victory that's
[0:45] already been won for us on our behalf
[0:48] and one day when that truth strikes us
[0:51] on the inside of the inside and we
[0:54] realize I have won not you will overcome
[1:00] you have won you have overcome
[1:05] you just can't embrace it yet lord help
[1:10] me to get my mind around it and if I
[1:13] can't get this mind around it let me
[1:15] take up your mind because your mind
[1:17] already understands it and let me get my
[1:20] arms around it because it's the reason
[1:23] why we live there's only one way that
[1:26] you can mortify the deeds of the body
[1:28] and that is through the spirit not a not
[1:32] a not a spirit you're waiting for but a
[1:35] spirit that already lives inside of you
[1:37] and not just any spirit but his spirit
[1:42] his life how did you get that it came to
[1:45] you about your new birth when you were
[1:48] born again
[1:49] Kevin and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51] Yeshua the Messiah was applied to your
[1:54] life and that one blood cell broke open
[1:57] on your behalf and the life that was in
[2:00] that blood cell was the Zoe eternal life
[2:03] of God or the life of Jesus Christ and
[2:06] by the new birth the life that was in
[2:09] him has been transferred to you and by
[2:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you now
[2:15] have fellowship with him in a way that
[2:19] you could have never had it without the
[2:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to
[2:24] have the Holy Ghost you've got to have
[2:27] the Holy Ghost
[2:31] you
