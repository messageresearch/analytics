We give you praise and adoration because you are holy. You are righteous. the price you paid at Calvary. Lord, everything that you went through leading up to Calvary were temptations such as is common to man, yet you had no sin. And I thank you, Lord, that you bore our sin to Calvary. And as you your body laid in that tomb, you were taking care of business in paradise and in the lower regions of the earth. Lord, I thank you that you have the keys. You took the keys of death and hell and the grave. And now we don't stand here today in our own righteousness, but we stand in your righteousness, complete and perfect. Oh yes, we have to walk it out. But I thank you, Lord, that I don't have to strive today trying to come to you perfect enough to present my worship. But I thank you that because of your righteousness as I lift my hands to you, Lord, my sacrifice of worship is honorable to you because of the righteousness that I walk in. Because of you, I give you praise, Lord. I give you praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God be glory. &gt;&gt; Great things. He has done &gt;&gt; and is doing and will continue to do because he is &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today. and forever. &gt;&gt; Do you have a need on your heart today by the lifting of a hand that you'd want us to remember? Needs all over the house, out across the stream. The needs that you have, our heavenly father knows them and he knows how to meet them. He's the one that we can talk to and he'll hear us answer prayer. We want to pray for all of those that are affected by these storms that the Lord will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and pardon on whom he will pardon. Sister Kathy texted to say she was not feeling well today. Let's remember her to the Lord in prayer. Please continue to remember the situation in Jerusalem that God will give us a total breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I have paperwork on my desk that's very promising, but I'm waiting to hear from someone in Jerusalem who I need I need their help and they're slow to responding. So, I need the Lord to move in that area and we're going to have a need soon perhaps before next Sunday to be able to cover some of the expenses if we are able to uh renew the lease. And it looks like we may be able to, the Lord willing, Jonathan will be leaving uh sometime early February to go to the apartment and start he's going alone to start sorting through some of the things. And I'll go later, but it does look like that God is making a way. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For us to keep it yet another another lease cycle. I feel like it's more important. I haven't always felt this way, but I feel like it's more important now than ever. And I also feel like that it is somehow redemption. You know, we never never really I never went back really to reclaim our position in in Jerusalem. And I'm believing somehow this is the year spiritually to do that. And we need God to move in the ways I've mentioned. and and maybe some I haven't mentioned, but he's able. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; More than able. Remember the meetings that are coming up that God would move and just release an extra service, but there'll be a little extra fellowship to go along with it. God's perfect plan be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. We take these needs to our papa. Let's sing the chorus of this song. in the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, Prince of Peace, trust Trles vanish, hearts are mened in the presence of brother Hulk. Will you come and pray today, please? in the presence of Jehovah, God Almighty, Prince of Peace, trust Trles vanish. Hearts are mened in the presence of God. Holy God. Holy God. Holy God. We're just so thankful, Lord, that we can come before our king. As Benjamin was praying earlier, he was praying that we would come in one mind and one accord. &gt;&gt; And that is what I prayed before the service today. that we as your people will come to you Lord in one mind to seek you Lord. Seek your heart that you would have your way in our midst. Lord, I just pray also for the purposes of God for this house for Israel. You by your own spirit have spoken so many things and Lord, you're true to your word, but you're waiting for people to participate with your word to grab a hold of it by faith. people that are led by your spirit and when we Lord obey something happens. Would you give us a quickening heart that is quickened by your spirit and we would be quick to respond? That you would find people that you can trust. I am amazed that you, oh Lord, would come to this earth and you showed us how to do this life. You showed us what what it is to be a son of God. But what is amazing also Lord, it was always the plan that you would come into us and give us the strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To do exactly what you did to be obedient and to walk out this journey. Lord, I also pray for all of us in this house that we we could see the end that we would not be bogged down by today, &gt;&gt; but be strengthened in our inner man because of the hope that is before us. It's your completed body in perfect state. I thank you for overcoming power that you have that you have given because of redemption &gt;&gt; and that is what I pray for everyone in this house. Would you just minister to all of your people today, oh God, there are different needs in this body, but you are so personal. You know everything, every little detail. And so according to your wisdom and your grace, would you minister Lord by your spirit? And again I pray for Jerusalem &gt;&gt; a strategy that comes from above. Would you lead? Would you guide? Would you open up the way the provision and let the purposes of God in Jerusalem for this ministry unfold? May we step into it right now. Lord, may this be the time I pray in the name of Yeshua &gt;&gt; that is higher, that is stronger. And I just thank you. We're partaker of that name. &gt;&gt; What a plan. I bless you, oh God. In the name of Yeshua, I pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. We give you praise, Lord. We give you praise Lord. Worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb. Hallelujah. You may have your seats today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What a blessing it is to be in the house of the Lord. Sister Flo, we invite you to come and sing while she's getting ready to come and sing today. We want to welcome you to this house. Brother Jerry already, it's good to see you. The Lord bless you. We're glad you're in the house of the Lord with us today. &gt;&gt; And uh let's see. Chris and Annie and Rebecca, we're glad that you're here today. The Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; We're glad that you could be in the house of the Lord with us today. While Sister Flo is getting ready to sing, I just want to remind you that we have a week of cold weather coming. And uh just just a public service announcement to you. Do do you have a picture there, Maya, that you can flash up there? This is a beneficial piece for you to put on your faucets. They are somewhat expensive. But I am telling you this because I have found them to be such a blessing &gt;&gt; because you put it on your faucet and you turn the faucet on completely. As long as it is warm, they will not run. But as the temperature comes down, then it begins to drip of its own accord. And then as it gets colder, it gives a heavier flow of water to keep your faucet from freezing. The uh low uh Home Depot is lowest stock, but Lowe's in Columbus and in Opaikica seem to have plenty of them. But they are a worthwhile investment for you so that you do not have to go out and try to make your faucet drip right every night. You just put it on there, turn the faucet on completely and it you can leave it all week. Uh I have it on my own building that has no heat in it and it works so beautifully. So uh just I I tell you that because we don't want broken water pipes not on this ground and not at your home. We just are offering that advice to you. Let's worship together as sister. They say that it's even more effective than than covering than those little insulated things that you buy. They say it's way more effective than those. &gt;&gt; I I have found it to be a great blessing. This is a new song and I'm praying that I'll do the Lord justice. Do good. But I want to tell you this year in August I'll be 88 years old and I've tried this and I'm here to tell you it works. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; So you pray for me. If I don't do good, I know you'll forgive me. I thought about that this morning. the devil, you know how he comes at you when you try to do something for the Lord. And so I said, "Well, they love me and they'll forgive me." So, you know, well, let's walk on. Walk on for Jesus. But remember, when you get down and out, this works. &gt;&gt; What I'm fixing to tell you works. Try it out. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Dare you to. I dare you to maestro. Praise God. Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; When you're up against the wall and the mountains seem so tall and it seems like life's not always fair. You can run away and hide. Let the old man decide. Or you can change your circumstances with a prayer. When everything falls apart, praise his name. When you have a broken heart, just raise your hands and say, "Lord, you're all I need. You're everything to me." And he'll take the pain away. &gt;&gt; When it seems you call alone, &gt;&gt; praise his name. When you feel you can't go on, just raise your hands and say, "Greater is he that is within me." And you'll take the pain away. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; If you'll just praise his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; You can overcome by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And by the word of your testimony. You'll see the darkness go &gt;&gt; as your faith begins to grow. &gt;&gt; You're not alone. So how can you be lonely? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When everything falls apart, praise his name. When you have a broken heart, just raise your hands and say, "Lord, you're all I need. You're everything to me." And he'll take the pain away. &gt;&gt; Yes, you will. When it seems you're all alone, praise his name. When you feel you can't go on, just raise your hands and say &gt;&gt; that is within me. And you'll praise the heart away. If you'll just praise his name. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; It's a truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have found that it works. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Flo. headed toward 88 years old and still learning new songs &gt;&gt; to come and sing &gt;&gt; for the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a marvelous thing. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Brother Cade, are you slipping away? All right, we're getting ready to receive the tithe and offering. Something that we do every service. received the tithe and the offering. You are faithful to give to the Lord. We honor you. We bless you. We don't want it to be just something that is common, but it is part of our covenant with the Lord, giving of our tithe and our offering to him. It's what believers do. They're not stingy. They give to the Lord. They give to each other. They're generous. It's part of the word of God. And that's what we're going to do today. Brother Ellias, will you help us please? Brother Jonathan, would you also help him go to the people to give of the tithe and offering as brother Kate is singing and we're worshiping getting our hearts ready for the the word. We're not just starting at this moment. We've already been in process. As as we pause just a moment while brother Benjamin was leading us in worship, I could feel &gt;&gt; that rhythm of the spirit. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That brother Brandham talked about that he had a recording made of. I could I could hear it rising. I want it to happen with frequency that we get on the winds of the spirit and ride higher and higher and higher. Let's ride higher on the in the spirit as we're preparing to hear the word of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Amen. People said I never make it. Said I'd never see it through. But they don't know what keeps me going. I guess they never have met you. All my life was in shambles until the day you came along. turned my tears into laughter and you gave me a brand new song. I'm still holding on. Lord, I'll never let you go. You gave me a smile. You touched my heart. You touched my soul. And those bridges behind me, Lord, I burn them to the ground. I'm still holding on. You're the best thing I ever found. Voted likely not to prosper. Have you ever been there? Was left hanging over my head. You'll never count for nothing. That's what most people said. I've been known to be unsettled. I never stay around too long. You're the treasure I've been searching for. Lord, I'm still holding on. Oh, and I'm still holding on. Lord, I'll never let you go. Oh, but you gave me a smile. You touched my heart. You touched my soul. And all those bridges left behind me. Oh Lord, I burn them to the ground. Oh, cuz I'm still holding on. You're the best thing I ever found. People said I never make it. Said I'd never see it through. They don't know what keeps me going. I guess they never have met you. Well, my life was in shambles till the day you came along. turned my tears into laughter. And you gave me a brand new song, Lord. And I'm still holding on. And Lord, I'll never let you go. Oh. Oh. And you gave me a smile. You touched my heart. You touched my soul. With all those bridges left behind me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. I burn them to the ground. burn. Oh yes. Oh, cuz I'm still holding on. You're the best thing I ever found. &gt;&gt; Sing that chorus again. Sing it with him. I'm still holding on. &gt;&gt; And I'm still holding on. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; But I'll never let you go. Oh Lord, thank you for holding on to me cuz you gave me a smile. Lordise, &gt;&gt; touch my heart. You touch my soul. All those bridges, all those bridges left behind me. That's right. Oh Lord, I burn them to the ground. Oh, cuz I'm still holding on. &gt;&gt; Still holding on. &gt;&gt; You're the best thing I ever found. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; All those bridges left behind me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I burn them to the ground. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm still holding on. You're the best thing I ever found. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, you are. Yes, you are, Lord. Yes, you are, Lord. Yes, you are. Lord, if there's ever a time that we cannot hold on to you, you promised and you have proven yourself faithful &gt;&gt; to hold on to us &gt;&gt; and we're very thankful for that. You may be seated for just a moment. He is faithful in all of his ways. &gt;&gt; I want to say it again so that you'll hear me this time. He is faithful in all of his ways. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're here this morning, I want you to participate &gt;&gt; in this service because you may need it worse than anybody else and not know it yet. &gt;&gt; Before we gather here Tuesday night, you might be the one who needed this atmosphere the most. &gt;&gt; And so, I just ask those of you who are here uh to spend as much time with us in the sanctuary as you can. um not so much time in the other rooms of the church. The nurseries are cry rooms. They're not uh spend the afternoon rooms. And so I would very much appreciate it if you would uh take care of your baby as quickly as you can and come back into the service. Uh there are churches who operate nurseries and that's a place that you can either drop your baby off, your child off or or stay with them uh through the whole service. But we we really have cry rooms. And that is when they're fussy or when they're hungry. If we train them that every time they uh burp, we're going to take them out and keep them out the rest of the service, we're doing them an injustice. &gt;&gt; And so I'm just asking you with all the love that I can muster. And I mean it. I don't I'm not asking in a condemning way or a judgmental way, but we need this atmosphere. I don't believe it takes two people to take care of one baby. &gt;&gt; And if you've got a baby that needs two people to take care of them, you might ought to want to have that evaluated a little bit. Uh because uh I don't think it's really necessary. So let's spend as much time as we can in the Well, I'm not feeling it. Doesn't I don't think I mentioned feeling yet. uh because I have found out whether I feel him or not, I'm changed &gt;&gt; when I'm in his presence. &gt;&gt; And uh now it's more effective when I connect. &gt;&gt; Way more effective. But it but he soaks in me. I'm a sponge anyway by nature. I hope you are. We can't make it without him. If you think you can coast in 2026, you've missed it. Brother, sister, this is not time to even want to coast. And uh if you if you need to be uh nursed along and uh you know propped up all the time, you need another experience with the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's not judgment either because there's one available for you. &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes we put it off because we know it it's going to cost us a little something. It may cost you a little sleep. You come see my eyes. It may cost you a little sleep and uh it may make you a nervous sort of person sometime, but it's worth it. It's worth it to to reach out for another installment of who he is. &gt;&gt; I want you to know God didn't send a message of restoration for us to become a denominational people. &gt;&gt; And uh maybe you were looking for a church when you came. Well, you'll never be satisfied here because I didn't want a church. A church is just a institute. God never inst I don't see anywhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; where God says that church is his idea. It's meeting together in his name with expectation and anticipation &gt;&gt; uh to meet him and to encounter him. And we have to have a building to do it in. You all wouldn't fit in my living room. &gt;&gt; And so we have to have a building. But but this this is not an institution. &gt;&gt; This is a living. &gt;&gt; It's coinia. It's a living moving breathing organism. And if you try to make it a structure, he leaves. &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't leave me, he'll leave you. If he doesn't leave you, he leave. It's it's a it's an hour that we want to be as circumspect as we possibly can. And uh I only have two days a week to speak to you. And um I want to use this time as wisely as I possibly can. So I'm not wasting breath here. I'm telling you the urgency of this hour. Uh we are once again and have been now for several months on the precipice of something that God has been trying to bring us to for over 20 years. And every time we get right up to the door, one or two things happen. One of two things happen. either someone raises up to to stop us with some kind of spirit or uh we have some division that comes uh to some of the families or to some of the folks and uh we're there again. But we know that God is going to take us all the way &gt;&gt; because our eyes aren't on people. &gt;&gt; If you get your eyes on me, I will disappoint you probably seven days a week. &gt;&gt; But if you'll put your eyes on him, I tell you, he never fails. &gt;&gt; Uh, ask brother Jerry. When we fail, he doesn't turn us loose. &gt;&gt; He reaches, his hand reaches farther down. &gt;&gt; That old song from the depths of the pit. I tried so hard, but I couldn't touch him. But his hand reached farther down &gt;&gt; than I could reach up. Oh, hallelujah. It is not a mystery that I can love him the way I love him today. But it is a mystery to me how he can love me the way he loves me today. And his love is is steadfast. It is divine. It is perfect love. And without perfect love. Without that we're not going going to have a rapture. We're not going in a rapture without perfect love. &gt;&gt; And it's not easy. It's it's it's not something you can just sit down and, you know, fist up and grunt and wrinkle your forehead and I'm going to I'm going to have perfect love. No, no, no. You You're going to have to have the birth pains all the way up to the top. &gt;&gt; Every dimension of his character requires another birthing process. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I thought it was just one birth." It is into eternal life. But into full adoption, there's births all the way to the capping of this pyramid, &gt;&gt; into the stature of the perfect man. &gt;&gt; I'm going there by God's grace. And you have to kind of have an attitude sometime. I'm going if I go by myself. &gt;&gt; If nobody else goes, I have to go. I have to inherit it. &gt;&gt; He's going to have preeminence in my life or I'm going to cut things out uh until he does. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am because we're at the end of this thing. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't we blessed to not be frozen under today? &gt;&gt; And we could still have some stormy weather. Somebody's I just got another notification. There'll be tornado watches this afternoon. Uh I'm not going to be watching for any &gt;&gt; because if you watch for them, you might see them. But I'm going to be prepared uh that if I uh I know one time they one one come through this area and I was having lunch with the Gies at Taziki and the only way we knew that it was getting bad is when we went to open the door and the door we could hardly close the door. The wind had kicked up. I said, "Hey, something's going on here." And then we began to hear what was happening. God brought us through safely. A few years back, we had a tornado on Saturday and snow on Sunday. And I was in Tucson and missed it all. Hallelujah. But I saw the map and I saw Alabama just sitting there so pretty with all the frozen folk around us and we are praying for them. But uh I believe God heard somebody's prayer. Right. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you were praying or not, but I heard Benjamin more than one time say, "I'm asking you, Lord, that we would be able to have church on Sunday and that that weather would not hinder us from being in your house." &gt;&gt; And God heard that prayer. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. I'm very thankful. Let's stand again. I I know you were just standing uh but we're getting ready to go to the word. And if you were not here Tuesday night, I have some uh contribution statements here for Sister Annie, for brother Jason and and uh and your son has one here and brother Michael and sister Crystal, Nathan and Joanna Jacob Hendris has one and Levi who who's not here I don't think today maybe but the Mans and Sister Tiffany and brother Austin and and Josiah. So, uh, brother, you're always willing to help. Brother Ellias, would you go lay those on the back table back there? And if I called your name, get yours on your way out today. And it's uh on you. Now, I uh have emailed and I have mailed some. And if there's any problem with yours, something left off, wrong check number, uh we called it a check and it was a uh online, anything like that, all you have to do is let us know and we'll be glad to to help you get that corrected. Uh why don't we just sing uh uh just a a just something simple? Why don't we sing again? And they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. As we get ready to go to the word, I only saw one birthday this week. There may be more, but I could only find one on the calendar, and that was Sister Megan. And that's on Thursday, January the 29th. And so, we want to wish her a very happy birthday. And uh you don't look your age, so that's good. You can thank God for that. and and I um I think that I really look mine until I see some other folks and then I think, "Wow, I'm looking amazing these days." If he's younger than I am, nobody told him. I'm telling you, he is. But anyway, God is good. What does it matter? I have another one waiting on me. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew. Oh, I'm a multi-agle, Lord. I need to renew my strength. I need to scratch my talons on the rock of ages. I need to scrape my beak on that rock until I can breathe the very oxygen of heaven. They shall walk and not Oh, teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord. I'm still learning to wait. That sounds so good again. Oh, they that wait upon the Lord. They shall now as he goes. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord. Teach me Lord to wait again. Do you mind one more time? They that wait they that wait. I'm waiting on you. Jesus shall renew. They shall mount. He goes, they shall run. Woo! I'm going to run. I'm going to run on. Glory be to God. Teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord. I'm coming up on the rough side of the mountain. Oh, I must hold to God his powerful hand. Oh, I'm coming up. I am on the rough side of the mountain. Woo! But I'm doing my best. Let's go up one. Oh, I'm coming up. Coming up, Jesus on the rough side of the mountain. Oh, I'm going to hold to God his powerful hand. Oh, I'm coming up on the rough side of the mountain and I'm doing my best. Are you doing your best? Sing it if you are. I'm coming up. Coming up, Jesus on the rough side. Woo. That's where sons are formed. Yes, sir. I'm going to hold to God, his powerful hand. I'm coming up. Woo! On the rough side. of the mountain and I one more time I'm coming up on the rough side of the mountain I'm going to hold till his powerful hand. I'm coming up over the rough side of the mountain. Here I come, Lord God, doing my best again. We're coming on up, Lord. I'm coming up on the rough side. Woo! Oh, I'm going to hold to God his powerful hand. I'm coming up. Coming up. Jesus on the right side. of the mountain. And I'm doing my best. I said I'm doing my best to make it. Lord, that's all we can do. That's all we can do. If you'll give God your best, he'll do the rest. Give him your best. Give him all you've got. And he'll do the rest. I know he will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You give him your best, he'll do the rest. &gt;&gt; I know he will. &gt;&gt; I know he will. How do you know? because he's been doing it for me for over 50 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And didn't quit him &gt;&gt; and he kept me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't go through a period of not being in church &gt;&gt; and he kept me. &gt;&gt; I put him first and he kept me. &gt;&gt; And and he always will. &gt;&gt; When my attitude was good, he kept me. But when it wasn't so good, he kept me anyway. &gt;&gt; That's who he is. &gt;&gt; You've got to understand abiding. &gt;&gt; We're abiding in the vine. &gt;&gt; We're not just connected for Sunday and Tuesday. &gt;&gt; We're living in that vine. The life of the vine. Isn't he great? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's thank God for anointed musicians. &gt;&gt; We don't have to drag them. Turn with me to Joshua chapter 1. You thought I was going to Judges. Joshua chapter 1 12:19. I want to make a note of that so that it's when it's 3:19 I'll be sure to be stopped. 12:19 Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Non, Moses minister, saying, Moses, my servant is dead. Now, do you think that Joshua didn't know that? I think he probably knew it. Why would God have to state the obvious? I find that he has to do that very often with me. &gt;&gt; He has to state the obvious to me and for me a lot of time because I have a hard time accepting change and sometimes I have a hard time accepting reality. Come on. &gt;&gt; You could have said yes you do. If you can't say if you can't say me too, you could say yes you do. You can say something. So God has to come to to Joshua and has I got a feeling it thundered. Moses, my servant, is dead. &gt;&gt; So quit your whining and your crying and your belly aching and get on up there and do what I've called you to do." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now therefore, arise. Get up. Get up out of your grief. Get up out of your despondency. Get up out of your Well, I don't know which way to go. You do know which way to go. The way was made clear through Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just get up and follow in the way. Go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. This isn't the first body of water that God had to supernaturally make a way through. &gt;&gt; And the Jordan was nothing in comparison to the Red Sea. If God brought him through the Red Sea, he knows how to get them to the other side of Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses was not to go through. &gt;&gt; And so it was now that Moses is gone and uh Joshua is the man. And this was a hard responsibility to fall on his shoulders. I don't think he wanted it. I don't think he was zealous to have it, but I think he was willing to be obedient. &gt;&gt; Are you willing today if God should call on you to do something more than you're comfortable with? Would you be willing to do it? We must be. We must be willing. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He it goes on every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon you. You you you can't tread on anything while you're sitting down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God said, "Get up, Joshua. Arise." And now you can't just stand there. You've got to move your feet &gt;&gt; because every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses. I promised it to him. I'm going to bring it to fulfillment through you. &gt;&gt; So get up and get to walking. &gt;&gt; Amen. from the wilderness and this Lebanon, even under the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, under the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee. &gt;&gt; As they were singing this morning, it didn't say you won't ever feel alone, &gt;&gt; but you're not alone. &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever felt alone? &gt;&gt; You can feel alone in a crowd. &gt;&gt; But the reality is you are not alone &gt;&gt; because what he is, you are. Yes. &gt;&gt; That places him always on board. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what was in him is now in you. &gt;&gt; And union means one. &gt;&gt; Union is not two people walking in agreement. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Union is becoming one. &gt;&gt; Somebody say union is becoming one. This invisible union means that we are becoming one &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; You doubt the word is clear &gt;&gt; very clear. Thou sh there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor &gt;&gt; be strong. Be strong. &gt;&gt; Quit ye like men. Be strong and of a good courage. I can't just do that. You can. &gt;&gt; You must. You have to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a commandment of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "How do I do that?" You make up your mind. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word said. Just telling you what the prophet said. I know that many of you believe you're the exception to both rules. But you are not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I wasn't. Those who went before me, they were not the exceptions to the rule. I can because he said I can. I will because he said I will. &gt;&gt; You speak that over your life. &gt;&gt; You make that confession over your life. I'm telling you, there's power. &gt;&gt; There's power in your confession. &gt;&gt; You may say it weak. You may not have the strength to say it loud. You may not even say it like you mean it. But if it'll come out of your mouth and it agrees with the truth of God's word, you have a high priest &gt;&gt; and all he is there to do is to bear your confession. &gt;&gt; He just pushes your confession a little higher. &gt;&gt; So when you say, "I'm barely making it. I'm going under for the last time. I'm this, that, and the other." You are not confessing what is true. So don't be surprised if somebody just looks at you one day and said, "You're a liar." &gt;&gt; What comes out of your mouth is a lie. &gt;&gt; That's how you feel. That's not what the word say. &gt;&gt; Are you stirred this? I'm not upset, but I'm stirred. Yes, I am stirred because I've been with the Lord. I didn't have a choice but to be with the Lord this I had to make room for him in my life or I wouldn't have made it over. I don't remember one person asking me this week except my wife perhaps maybe one of my children could could have they do often but I don't remember anybody that I've ministered to much uh o over the past the last few weeks say pastor are you all right how are you getting along how do you feel what is your peace do you have peace do you walk in the victory or are you down and out do you feel a little hopeless but you know that's okay it's all right I'm not complaining that nobody asked me. I'm telling you, if I can make it &gt;&gt; like that, &gt;&gt; you can too. &gt;&gt; You can. You can. You can. &gt;&gt; You're called for this hour. &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land. That you don't want to miss the reading of the will. You you you don't want to be absent on that day when they're dividing up the inheritance which I swear unto their fathers to give them. Only be thou here comes again. You if you didn't know better, you'd think Joshua was a big old coward. But that's not it at all. He was willing that we know. And that makes him courageous. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Willingness makes a man courageous, a woman courageous. &gt;&gt; But God knew how large the task was going to be. So he just kept putting into him, "Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper." &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what side of the Jordan you're on, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You can prosper if you're not looking to the right hand or to the left. You've got Jesus in plain view. &gt;&gt; We must. Thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. Lord, we need you today. We need you today. &gt;&gt; Some are going to get blessed and some are going to get harassed and we're going to go home in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; I have determined in my heart to get blessed. &gt;&gt; I've determined that you're going to speak to me today &gt;&gt; and I'm here to hear what you have to say. Uh, let the Holy Ghost order, let the divine government of the Lord arrest this service that we would not walk out of here without receiving what you have prepared and set aside for us in this hour. &gt;&gt; In the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I am bridging a gap. I am drawing a connection. I am giving you typology. I'm showing you that this little lad was a prophetic picture of a Joshua generation. He was a prophetic picture. What little lad? The little lad that was there to position Samson to the pillars of this great house of false worship and realry. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Judges 16 uh uh 26 and 27. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. He was once a man that didn't need anybody to show him where to go &gt;&gt; or how to go or what to do when he got there. He was a man that seemed to have a a a godly intuition about the moment that God was going to break through and use him. And so even though he had a tendency to to wander into strange territory, it seems that he was always at the right place when God was getting ready to move. &gt;&gt; So Samson was intuitive by the spirit. Uh, it wasn't God who drove him down to the to the to the uh vineyard. It wasn't God who drove him this way or that way or the other way. It wasn't even God who put him in the lap of Delilah. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Didn't have to be that way. Somebody said, "Well, wasn't that his destiny to fall and to fail?" If it was, it was only for my benefit and your benefit because he was being mightily used of the Lord as long as he kept his eyes on the vow. When you leave your vow unguarded, when you leave your commitment, your covenant with God unguarded, unwatched, uncared for, you are walking in dangerous territory because then you become uh uh you can become a victim to every pull, to every sway, to every strange wind, to every contrary wind, and you may find yourself in a babble, in a confusion. like the very spirit of Babylon around us. So, we want to be repositioned. If we find ourselves at a at a wrong place or if we find ourselves blinded and unable to find direction, we want to ask that the Lord would reposition. I'm asking him. I know many will mock me. I know there will be those who watch this service who will mock me for even insinuating that the bride needs to be repositioned. But I am not insinuating it. I am declaring it in the name of the Lord. The bride needs to be repositioned in this hour. &gt;&gt; She has gotten away from her pillars. &gt;&gt; She is not earnestly content. I'm talking about as a whole, as a unit. She is no longer earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. &gt;&gt; She's laboring and straining too hard to defend the reputation of brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that if he were here today, he would tell you, "Don't worry about what they say about me. Get your eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; My old granny used to say, "I I don't care how dirty it gets today. It'll all come out on wash day. &gt;&gt; You let them say what they want to say. You let them rage like they want to rage &gt;&gt; and do what they want to do." Well, I I was listening to something that happened this week. There's a great shaking that's taking place in the Pentecostal and charismatic world. Somebody said, "There you go. You shouldn't even be interested in that. Why shouldn't I? They're my brothers. I have sisters over there. I have brothers over there that God has not yet applied the Isaf that brought me out." &gt;&gt; So, I'm praying for them. &gt;&gt; And God's been saying to them for years what he's been saying to his people for years. I'm going to shake everything &gt;&gt; that can be shaken. &gt;&gt; There is a word and there is a people that cannot be shaken. &gt;&gt; Because they're not worrying themselves on trying to defend the reputation of a prophet. &gt;&gt; We know that he was God's choice. I &gt;&gt; I I want you to know uh I I can't I've gotten to a place where I I can hardly listen to our president talk. The very sound of his voice seems to to bring some agitation to me. But I know that for this job, for this hour, for this season, he has been God's choice. He makes me nervous. He talks way too much. They need to reduce his medication so that he can uh just calm himself just a little bit because I'm standing there uh trying you know if I listen I don't listen much anymore but when I do I'm there pray oh God oh God ask my wife oh God shut him up oh God help him Lord not to go on and on and on and on into something that's just going to make things worse just let him get behind that desk and do what he's supposed to do and sign what he's supposed to sign and quit trying to explain it. Uh, Brother Brandham got in trouble trying to explain everything. &gt;&gt; I've gotten in trouble trying to explain everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But he was he's God's man. &gt;&gt; I want you to know I cannot explain everything about brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I can't explain how that he said some things and and did them. I I I don't know why that was the way it was, but it was. But my eyes are not on him. &gt;&gt; And my faith is not anchored in him. &gt;&gt; If yours is, you've got more trouble coming. &gt;&gt; But my my focus and the anchor of my faith is what he said his was. It's in the absolute inherency of scripture. &gt;&gt; That word never fails. And while many of our brothers and sisters have made it to be one word, one word. It's just all one Bible and and tapes and books. I don't do that. I never have. It is not the revelation that I have. My I believe God has given us a great message of enlightenment and understanding. We needed it. But it cannot replace the absoluteness of the scripture. And neither can it be joined to it in such a way that it all becomes absolute. &gt;&gt; Because as brother Joseph said yesterday, I totally disagree. I totally 100% disagree. I do not believe that everything on the tape is thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; I never believed it and I won't believe it now and I doubt very seriously I'll ever believe such an idea as that. That's not what he told us he came to do. It was to be a turning. It was to bring hearts. It was to connect generations. &gt;&gt; It was to turn hearts of fathers to children, children to fathers. Vice versy, which means connecting generations. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so it's important for us to be able to see that &gt;&gt; and spend our time uh uh in the word being strengthened by the truth &gt;&gt; and not trying to figure out the things that we don't understand. &gt;&gt; I don't understand some of you watching that. I don't understand why brother Brandon preached the message he did on marriage and divorce and then performed wedding ceremonies for people that were double married. I don't understand why he did it for his own brother, but I'm not called to defend that. &gt;&gt; I'm called to stand on the word. &gt;&gt; I believe marriage and divorce was a revelation from the Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe the churches had so confus I'm coming to you in a minute. You say not even talking to us. I'm coming to you in a minute. &gt;&gt; Uh I believe there was such a mess made in the denominations. Uh some said you just you know however many times just keep trying till you get it right and some said other things and some said when you come to the Lord you got to divorce and and separate and some I don't know what all they were saying but I believe the Lord came with an absolute &gt;&gt; guess where it was based &gt;&gt; it was there all the time &gt;&gt; Moses from the very beginning he said suffered you a bill of divorcement it, but it wasn't so. He permitted. He was permitted to do it, but it was not so. It was not in the mind of God to undo a vow that had been made. There it is. That's the answer. &gt;&gt; If you look at that, it will help you all the way through &gt;&gt; to understand how these things ought to be handled. But there, I wasn't there and I don't know the details. And if God led brother Brandham to do something like that, uh it didn't it didn't shake my confidence &gt;&gt; because I'm not here to defend. I'm not here to tear apart. But but I want you to know I was listening to one of these speakers this week while I was working and he was exposing some of this great scandal that's taking place in the charismatic movement where they're uh using Facebook to get information about people and then calling them out prophetically. No wonder they were saying no wonder they were saying that these people had similar uh uh you know giftings as brother Brandham because they saw them doing some of the same things they saw brother Brandham doing. And when they came to me with such an idea as that I said I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I spoke in a conference in Tucson where one of these men uh was was invited to speak and I was in that meeting and he we were told that he had the same kind of gifting. Now, we knew better, but he's got a word of knowledge. It's just like William Brandom. And we went I said, "I don't believe it, but I want to see it for myself." And and brother, did I see it for myself. We like not to pull the conference back together when he got through with his shenanigan. And now they have exposed some of these fellas from from studying on Facebook looking they're they're asking when they would go to a conference they were asking for the names of the spe of the participants in the conference. Why would they need that? Oh, I want to pray over these names. Well, if that's what you're doing, that'd be great. But instead, they were going on Facebook looking up these names, finding out details about their their dog's name. And you people that post what you had for supper last night, it wouldn't even take a prophet to tell you. I could just look you up and tell you what you ate cuz you've had to show me a picture of it. I've done it. I know what it what it what you're doing. But they but there comes some problems because some of the names they were calling. One little fella, he had a birthday dinner. It was his birthday and someone invited him to a birthday dinner and he missed that night of the conference and that was the night his name got called. These things have been going on for years. And would you believe that here is a a man who believes it's his job to uh to to speak all that out and to expose it and tell the whole world and and he just went right down the list. And if you didn't know any better, you'd think he didn't believe in the just because there's a thousand dozens and dozens and dozens of phonies and fakes and charlatans and janises and jambies and doesn't mean there hasn't been and can't be an a genuine. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is still genuine. &gt;&gt; But but I I I dealt with some of these very people that are being spoken about and I warned a few people about some of these things as we were going along with it. But what amazed me and the reason why I'm telling it is when they're listing the names of those who have been discredited right out there for the whole world to hear. They call the name William Brandom and they clump him in with the rest of them and it boils my blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and I want to spit, &gt;&gt; but I have to remind myself &gt;&gt; that's not what you called me to do, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "I must decrease." &gt;&gt; There was a man out there whose name was Chambers who was on the radio and writing articles and newspapers and things and sending them all around the world 20 plus years ago. and he came up with a story about brother Brandham and about the tunnels that were under his house in Jeffersonville that led out into the streets and how that he could uh go in and out through the through the uh through the uh what do you call it? uh the hole the the lid manhole cover and and he could go out and people didn't even know he'd come out of the house because he was going through the tunnels and and coming out and he was taking people in and all that kind of stuff. And I read that and you know I knew it didn't take some investigation. I knew it was just something that someone said I don't believe anybody would make that up. If you've ever been guilty of saying something like that, you're not living in 2026. &gt;&gt; For a long time now, people who want to malign and destroy, they don't have to tell the truth. &gt;&gt; They'll just make it up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there are people who believe such a thing as that. And it was a lie. There were no tunnels. He wasn't sneaking in and out or sneaking anybody in or out. It was just something that somebody did to try to destroy. That is the hour that I would want to be very careful what I put my hand on. &gt;&gt; And I don't understand why in 2026 that they would have to lump him in with the modern charismatic and Pentecostal charlatans of our day. But they feel the need to do it. And there's a part of me that would love uh to defend and and uh make the the opposite statement and blah blah blah. But the but the reality is we don't have time to get caught up in those kinds of fights. We've got to get ready because we're on the horizon of the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has come to us in the fullness of his word and he's coming again to receive his bride unto himself. And that should be our focus in all that we do and all that we say in how we live our lives. We should be living a life of preparation. I am preparing for my real life. This is the dress rehearsal. This is only the dress rehearsal. My real life is just ahead. It's waiting on me. &gt;&gt; There is a generation that will arise that will not go around the mountain. &gt;&gt; Not one more time. There is a people that will arise that will finally find their deliverance from Kadesh Barnea. They'll cross the Jordan. They will inherit the promises that are waiting on us on the other side. And we're not talking about heaven. &gt;&gt; Heaven is the smallest portion of the bride's inheritance. &gt;&gt; It's that moment between now and then. It's that hour between now and eternity that God desires to unfold the purpose of the little lad of the Joshua generation of the last day remnant bride. Those who will step forward to guide anyone left in the church system or anyone from the from the message system who desires to be repositioned at the pillar at the foundation at the very absolute of scripture. If you think I'm off the word, the reality is I've got so much word for this that I don't even know how to outline it and give it out. &gt;&gt; This Bible is full of precious promises. &gt;&gt; And even though there will be those who will tell you they're all fulfilled, they are not all fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And I am determined if I live or if I die. I'm determined to see their reality and their fulfillment in my life. And if I don't live long enough to be the reality of that, I will be I will die preparing myself for what I know is ahead. &gt;&gt; And if I care about people like I say I do. And if I love people like I say I do, I will be as concerned about preparing the next generation &gt;&gt; as I am building something for myself. &gt;&gt; You've got to make it. And your children have to make it. &gt;&gt; And they've got to know the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They've got to know the Bible. And we not just know it. &gt;&gt; We've got to live by it. &gt;&gt; And we've got to think like it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we've got to talk like it &gt;&gt; because our words matter. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; So, I want to I want to make this type again. and and uh boy, I sure did use a lot of my time, but uh I I just did. It's done now. I can't take it back. Right. So, I I don't want to go back over everything about this little ad that we've already talked about, but I want to move on into something here. I want you to know that when the mighty fall, when when movements fall, when pre preachers fall, when when we get disappointed, when we lose our way, God always raises up. He's done it throughout all the church ages. &gt;&gt; He all He did it in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; He always raises up a remnant. &gt;&gt; Amen. who will stay with the scripture. &gt;&gt; You've got to be part of that. &gt;&gt; You've got to understand solah &gt;&gt; scripture only the Bible alone. &gt;&gt; Meaning it is the complete authority. &gt;&gt; And every vision your pastor has, it has to line up with that Bible. &gt;&gt; Or don't you even regard it. every dream, &gt;&gt; everything Luther said, &gt;&gt; Luther said some terrible, awful, scandalous error. &gt;&gt; He said some horrible things. All the Jews be damned, he said. That's horrible. &gt;&gt; You might call him the father of anti-semitism. That's a hideous thing for him to say. He's partially responsible for the launching of the whole idea of replacement theology that the church had replaced the Jews. So I can tell you quickly that there's one of the church age messengers who was very flawed in part of his message. &gt;&gt; But he got one thing and maybe many others. But one thing I know that needed to be established to start cracking away at that system &gt;&gt; that was taking the world. The just &gt;&gt; shall live by priestly confessions. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Shall live by hail Marys. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Shall shall live by our fathers. &gt;&gt; No sir. indulgences or what do you call them? Rossaries. No, the just shall live by &gt;&gt; faith. &gt;&gt; He's responsible for restoring the message of justification. &gt;&gt; Trinitarian. He believed God was in three persons. He believed that when he got to heaven, he would meet the father and meet the son and meet the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; So did Wesley. &gt;&gt; Wesley restored the the doctrine of sanctification. &gt;&gt; And he taught it and he taught it well. And he believed in the power of the washing of the water of the word. And he believed in a manifestation of a second installment of God's grace to a person to be set apart and strengthened to come away from the things of the world. God bless him. But he believed that when he got there, he was going to shake the father's hand and shake the son's hand and shake the Holy Ghost hand. My, you're going to be disappointed. Oh, you're going to be so disappointed. But God used him and he brought a truth that had been lost that needed to be restored. So what did God do? God in the last of the church ages, what has been called the Leodysian church age, it has also been called the Pentecostal church age. If you listen to the way they lay the church ages out in the in the modern message movement, you'll find them making eight ages instead of seven. &gt;&gt; Because they will talk about the restoration of Pentecost as though it was its own age. No. &gt;&gt; No. That was Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That was Le Oysia. &gt;&gt; That's this age. You can't change the message halfway through the age. Therefore, this is still the Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; It does doesn't belong to the organizations anymore. &gt;&gt; It belongs to whoever will find a real experience. &gt;&gt; It's available no matter where you go to church. &gt;&gt; It's available &gt;&gt; if you'll just prepare to meet God. &gt;&gt; But then they they they had this uh restoration of Pentecost and then then they say, "Well, then we had this messenger who restored this that and the other." And certainly it's the truth. My point is this this message is either part of the seventh age or part of the millennium. &gt;&gt; And since I don't believe this is the millennium, &gt;&gt; then God sent the last church age messenger in the last church age, &gt;&gt; which was the age of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for God to come toward the end of Leodysia and tell us that we no longer need these things would be a really wouldn't make any sense in light of all the other church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it's one age and now the focus and the emphasis must not be on gifts. We must make our focus the the whole word, the entire word. And we must not make our focus talking in tonesues. &gt;&gt; Because while talking in tonesues, speaking in tonesues is an evidence &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. It's not necessarily the initial evidence, &gt;&gt; but it is an evidence. &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message tells us so, but not necessarily the initial. Meaning that if you don't talk in dong, you you you can't come to the assumption that the Holy Ghost hasn't come. If the Holy Ghost has come, he knows how. He can if you yield yourself. He can speak in heavenly languages through you or known languages also. He can. He might. He will. I hope he does. &gt;&gt; Because you need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you'll obey the word, listen, I know people who speak in tongues &gt;&gt; that I love and that I believe in them and have confidence in them, but I wouldn't dare go as far as to say because they spoke in tongues. Brother Brandham makes this mysterious statement. He he said, "You you can have the Holy Ghost. You could get the Holy Ghost every day for the rest of your life &gt;&gt; and die and go to hell. Woo. Did you know he said it? &gt;&gt; That's that's kind of rough, isn't it? But you come along and begin to understand. And you need to understand this because this is a part of the bride's favor. You didn't just get the Holy Ghost on your flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't make you jump and dance and run and holler and roll on the floor and run the pews and all these wonderful, glorious expressions of joy and praise. I love them all. Uh, as long as they're in order and as long as you're living right, I don't care how high you jump. But when you're feet touch the floor, I want you to be living right. That's what the word requires. &gt;&gt; But I like all that. But you can do that when all you've had is the spirit pour down on your flesh. &gt;&gt; You call that the Holy Ghost? Sure, it's the Holy Ghost. Sure it is. &gt;&gt; And you can get that middle ground. You can get a little touch of that Holy Ghost in that middle ground. &gt;&gt; But it's not until you've receive the full portion of the Holy Ghost on the inside of the inside that your spirit has finished its actual transformation of regeneration. And when that takes place, the Holy Ghost starts working itself back through that mind, will, and emotion &gt;&gt; and to the flesh. And I don't care what order I get it. I just want to make sure that I've got the Holy Ghost in all of who I am. Oh, I want him on my flesh cuz I don't want to be a corpse. &gt;&gt; And I want him in my mind and my will and my emotion because I don't want to be tossed about with every wind of doctrine. But more than anything else, I want to know that he has changed my fallen inner man, &gt;&gt; my spirit, &gt;&gt; and he has endued me. Harai, endued me with his life. &gt;&gt; So, please understand that God's not finished. anything and everything that he is determined to do, he can do it in in a in in an amazingly short amount of time. &gt;&gt; What we have been preparing for for so many years could all be over in 30 days. &gt;&gt; In 40 days, &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know. I'm not predicting. I'm not prophesying. I'm not putting an an amount of days on it. I'm just telling you that the reality is he could do it in 10 minutes. &gt;&gt; That's all. He's God. &gt;&gt; Oh, you'd be surprised how powerful he is when when we can cooperate with him instead of being in his way. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to cooperate with him? &gt;&gt; I don't want to be in his way. &gt;&gt; I want to cooperate with him. So when when a when a mighty something God does mighty and it falls and and and and the the news reporter could stand back and say it's totally lost. I know in Israel some years ago there were some horrible forest fires. Are you looking this way? Good. Horrible forest fires. totally totally destroyed some of the national forest in Israel and and these these uh secular uh sabras are they're they're a lot of them are nearly tree huggers. They love the environment and they love uh trees and they love course I like trees myself. I didn't hadn't hugged one in a while but I really like them. I like plants. I like living things and um I like birds. And you ought to know that something was coming if you had a bird feeder this week because I'm telling you, we've been having to fill it uh about every other day because they are eating. I'm telling you, and calling their cousins &gt;&gt; cuz they know something's coming and they're not going to be able to get food. So, they are fattening up. I'm I'm becoming my mother. I was standing at the window talking to them. That's how you know you're getting old when you talk to puppies and kitty cat. I don't talk to kitty cats, but I'll talk to puppy dogs and I talk to birds. And I said, "Look, little fella, you're fat enough. I think you've had your you're fool this week. You're filled. Now get out of the way, you little chickade." That's what he was. And let somebody else come and have some. They know something's going on. &gt;&gt; They know. They know that they they've got more uh uh seems like intelligence and than sometimes Christian people in knowing what's happening around us. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what was stirring. Had no idea really what was stirring in the atmosphere. But I knew when I pulled on the ground Tuesday evening, I knew something was stir disturbed in the atmosphere, but I wasn't sure exactly what it was. And a little later, they brought Elelliana in the office and she was just in a in a tither, they said. And I said, "Well, I wouldn't be I'm not trying to spiritualize everything and I wouldn't be putting anything on her, but I felt something in the atmosphere and I think there's something good in the atmosphere and something troubling in the atmosphere and she may be picking up on that." Did you know that we're made we're made and created in such a way that if we can be calm enough &gt;&gt; and quiet enough, &gt;&gt; we could even sense something of another dimension, something that's happening over there in another realm. Why would that be a good thing? It'd be a good thing because if it's something good, you want to pray it in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it's something bad, you want to be on guard &gt;&gt; that it doesn't get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because misery loves company. And confusion loves to divide and spread and multiply itself. Don't you be a part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's too late now in the hour. So when the mighty fall, God always preserves and raises up a remnant. And so Samson had a calling. He had the supernatural. He had a vow which was perpetual. The history, he had the history. He he had experienced the raw power of God. He knew when the anointing had left because he shook himself and it was no longer there. So he was sensitive enough to that to that feeling of demonstration that he recognized that something had happened. But see, compromise had blinded him. It seemed that he was always yielding to the fleshpool. carnality had bound him and it will bind all of us &gt;&gt; if we do not keep our eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Did you know there is sin and there is carnality and sometimes carnality can be sin &gt;&gt; but sometimes carnality what we call carnality is just a manifestation of humanity. We're just people. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I'm just a person." &gt;&gt; And I act like people. And sometimes it's carnal because it's not spiritual. But it's really just people. People. And And notice sometimes those are the ones who make everything spiritual. No. Sometimes it's just people. And I I want you to know that if you have authority and someone's willing, you can cast a demon out of them or drive a demon off of them. &gt;&gt; But sometimes the problem is a soul issue. &gt;&gt; And that's one thing. You can pray and fast and cry and try to get the power to come along and help somebody, but you cannot fix or cast out or repair somebody else's soul. &gt;&gt; That's mind, will, and emotions. &gt;&gt; If I could, I would. I would have delivered a lot of people from their souls. I would have delivered myself from my soul many times. Now, for you uh who have it the other order, just pretend like I'm saying spirit because I'm talking about the middle ground. Whatever you call the middle ground that sometime, not sometime, all the time, once you become a Christian, that's where your trouble is. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I thought it was on my flesh." Well, the reality is your flesh is just going to obey your outer man. And the desires of the flesh, they're just going to follow in the leadership of the inner man. &gt;&gt; So if there's a war going on between your regenerated spirit and your soul, your flesh is going to feel the war. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say you got scripture for that. Believe I do. The apostle said, "Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me? For in my innermost being, there is a warfare. And when I seek to do good, evil shows up. &gt;&gt; And the good that I would do, and on and on and on. And the reality of it is he was experiencing that inner war that you and I experience. I I don't think I'd be exaggerating to say on a daily basis &gt;&gt; something in there wants to war against the will of God &gt;&gt; in my life. &gt;&gt; I I think I mean I'm maybe not aware of it every day, but I think it would be safe to say that is poss. It's possible that you would have that warfare going on every day. Well, how do you how do you win? You win by by keep holding on. &gt;&gt; Cade told us how to win. Keep holding on &gt;&gt; and he'll keep holding on to you and feed the inner part, the middle, the I mean, excuse me, the inside of the inside. Feed that. &gt;&gt; I was reading a quotation from a sermon that I had preached here some years ago because I was looking for something and I happened to be talking about feeding that inner man and and and I and I said something like this there. It it receives no sustenance. It receives no nourishment from true romance novel. &gt;&gt; It receives no nourishment from your daily horoscope. &gt;&gt; It receives no nourishment from your favorite video game. &gt;&gt; It receives no nourishment from your favorite social media outlet. Right. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that feeds the inside of the inside, &gt;&gt; and that is the unadulterated word of God. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And whatever part of you you feed the most, &gt;&gt; it's going to lead. And you know that's a truth. &gt;&gt; If you're here, say amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to trick you. You weren't saying amen to what I said particularly. I said, "If you're here, say amen." Then everybody can participate. Carnality bound him. It will all of us if we don't keep our eyes on Jesus. Comfort shaved off the secret. He was looking to be soothed. Samson wanted to be soothed. So he found a beautiful woman, laid his head in her lap, and let her stroke his hair and massage his temples. He wanted to be petted. Oh, just a minute. Let me have a little water here. He wanted to be petted, &gt;&gt; rubbed on, not sexual. Not talking about that. That was another big part of his problem, lust. But that only manifested because he had this need to be petted, to be soothed. Now, you would like to say that every man has that and it's part of everyday natural life. Well, I want to tell you that that is true by design. However, you're going to have to sanctify that part of who you are &gt;&gt; or it'll put your head in the wrong lap &gt;&gt; and you'll find your soothing in some other thing or some other person. or or you'll find your crutch to be something else and your fix to be something else. So that has to be subdued. But you wouldn't think that mighty giant, that superhero of the faith needed to just be, "Oh, now now darling, now now you big brute. Everything is all right." I hear preachers doing it all the time. They call it preaching the message. What I find they're doing many times, God, help me not to feel this need to stroke and soothe what needs to be tamed. And only the Holy Ghost can tame, &gt;&gt; only the Holy Ghost can cause you to feel like you are not alone when you feel alone. Only the Holy Ghost can rewire and remake us. And he's the only one, him in us is the only one that can do that. But I hear preachers finding the need to excuse the sin in their congregation and the compromise in their congregation. And in doing so, they're just stroking the people like, "Now, now, now, this is Satan's Eden. Oh, bless your heart. You had to live in the last age. Oh, it's harder now." I hear people saying the the temptation. Some of you believe this. And I want you to know you're dead wrong. I'm telling you boldly, you're dead wrong. But they say things like, you know, the young people of this generation, they they have to go through so much that other generation didn't have to go through. No, the devices are different. The avenues are different. They no longer have to go to 7-Eleven to get the Playboy. &gt;&gt; But they are fighting. Whether you like it or not, young generation, I'm going to preach you into a Joshua group. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you before you get there that you're going to have to quit feeling sorry for yourself. &gt;&gt; As though you're the only generation that ever struggled to serve and struggle to overcome. &gt;&gt; My generation and the one before me and the one before me and the one Well, are you but but don't you understand that life was more simple? Sure. But it's the same devil. It's the same devil. It's the same fallen nature. It's the same temptation. It's the same pull. Yes, we're more bombarded. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's on every billboard. It's on every radio station, on every television station. &gt;&gt; It's in our faces more. &gt;&gt; But the reality is the pull is the same. That's right. &gt;&gt; The same root. And where would you be? I don't want to shame anybody, but where would you be if we had fallen in disgrace and laid in the ditch? &gt;&gt; Where would this generation be &gt;&gt; if all of those who went before them had give up? &gt;&gt; Where would you be if the old prayer warrior hadn't stayed on her prayer knees? And where would you be if there wasn't somebody in your face constantly preaching to you the truth? &gt;&gt; So we've had a generation before us in which many failed &gt;&gt; and many have lost their way. But let us not forget &gt;&gt; that there have been those who have overcome. &gt;&gt; How daily &gt;&gt; I don't consider myself as someone who has and never will have to again. I have to overcome like you do every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether you ask me how I feel or not. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; I'm saying that not for you to ask me cuz frankly wouldn't mean a thing. I'm saying it so that you will understand that you can you don't everybody don't have to know. And some of you are, of course, you're you're kind of built so that you don't want anybody to know. Well, we're not blind either. You know what I'm saying? But there are some folks they just have to tell everybody that they're on the last Oh, God. Oh, no. I just can't make it. No, just a I know names are flying in your head like mine. Pray for me that I don't call them. We're dramatic. And sitting right beside us or right in front of us is somebody fighting the same or worse and hadn't told a soul. &gt;&gt; But they showed up. &gt;&gt; Maybe they got bags under their eyes. Maybe they've wrestled all night, but they showed up &gt;&gt; because that's what God's people do. In every generation, there has to be a remnant of people that no matter what the church does, I mean, look folks, it's kind of dis I'll be honest, it's kind of disappointing to me because they preached to me a third exodus and I thought that was it. Nobody dared tell me I was facing another one. Brother Brandham only got to three. So they told me that once I came out of denomination and into this message, they sold it in such a way that I thought, well then the battle's just about over now and we won't never have to separate ourselves again. &gt;&gt; But what we find out now is that because carnality is prevailing &gt;&gt; and because people are feeling such a need to spend their time vindicating the signs, &gt;&gt; singing about the signs, and defending the servant, the prophet, that we have had the need to be separated again. &gt;&gt; And so what they sling at us as insults and sometimes what my children have felt as insults when they would go to the youth camps and be treated the way they have been treated. Really, it's not an insult at all &gt;&gt; when you tell us that we're not a part of that system that you all have created around the truth. You're really, really egging me on. You're really bringing strength to my going &gt;&gt; because I didn't know it, but I had to come out again &gt;&gt; because I chose. I determined. I am determined. I don't mean to boast. I want you to be with me. We got to do this together. But we are determined to stay on the word. &gt;&gt; And we won't know that we've arrived until we can live it. &gt;&gt; Until we can do it. &gt;&gt; Until we can tell the truth. &gt;&gt; And live the truth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; and manifest this seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell me what kind of gene is in you. Manifest it. Show me what life is in there. Show me what you came here with. Show me what he deposited in you. &gt;&gt; No. Tell me you've got the Holy Ghost. Show me you've got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not because you were soothed. Not because you laid your head in Delilah's lap and she rubbed your brow, but because you made up your mind. I'm going on with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you know what the alternative is? We talk like it's a vacation. It's not a holiday. You turn loose of him, you're in trouble, sir. &gt;&gt; Of course, you've seen the track record that he's going to hold on to you. But I'll tell you that doesn't mean that it's not going to get mighty hard. Brother Gley, I don't know how many I've had through the years come to me and say you you preached me back to faith, but you didn't tell me how hard it was going to be to go back to where I was. You told me the Lord would accept me. He would receive me. He would bring me in the fold. He would marry to the backslider. He would find me. He But you didn't tell me how hard it was going to be when I made up my mind. because it's like starting over. But oh, it's worth it. If you'll just make him everything, my everything, it's worth it. 117 carnality. Listen, Samson took his present and future for granted. And this is where we are. We are doing the same thing. Samson took his present and his future for granted because he knew what had happened in the past. I'm going to read it again. Make sure you heard me. He took his present and his future for granted because he knew what had happened in the past. And we've done the same thing many times. We know how God has helped us in the past. So, we just take for granted that it's just a free thing and we don't have to uh we don't have to pray more and we don't have to push in. But I want you to know it stripped him of everything he had known. &gt;&gt; And his yielding to the distractions reduced him to the grinding stone. But to rescue him, I said this, God did not send a committee, a council, or a system. He sent a kid. He sent a lad. Not a priest, not a warrior, not an elder, not a judge, but a young lad. Samson is definitely a type of the modern church. I've read you what the prophet has said many, many times, and I want you to listen to this. That that church, that Pentecostal church, that original church, both born on the day of Pentecost and revived at Isusa Street. She once slew lions and at other times shut the mouth of lions. She once carried gates. Do you know what that's a type of? It means government. Government is in the gate. Justice and judgment is determined at the gate. &gt;&gt; That's why we need holy sanctified gatekeepers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because justice and judgment is rendered in the gate. The elders of the city would sit at the gate. Not the ancient gate that Abraham walked through, but the other gate to the city of Dan has also been uncovered. And it's one of the places where you can climb the hill up the cobblestone and walk through the gate. You can't walk through the gate that Abraham walked through because it's preserved for you to see it. But you can walk through the gate that followed that gate some hundreds of years later. Still ancient. And you can see the seat, the seats, the stones, the places where the elders would sit. And there would be one, it's not there, but there would be one seat that was called a beimma, and it was a judgment seat. And when a decision was being rendered over any matter that concerned the city, the town, the community, or individuals in the community, one of the elders would sit on that seat, and he would read the determined decree of the elders. And it would either be justice with restitution or it would be judgment with penalty. It was not decided by presidents, not even kings. In cities, it was determined by elders sitting at the gate. The very fact that Samson carried the gates away of a city speaks of course it was a a pagan city. It was a city of the Philistines. Yes. But it speaks to us of the church's authority &gt;&gt; to stand in the gate &gt;&gt; in intercession and in prayer and in prophetic decree and determine things that we have no earthly authority over. Our authority comes from heaven. &gt;&gt; Our authority comes from the word. The mayor doesn't call us and the governor doesn't call us and the city council doesn't call us. But heaven is waiting on a generation who will take serious the responsibility to make sure the gate is occupied. &gt;&gt; It was the elders. It was the elders. You know why? Because the youth were distracted. They were on the video game. They were on the disc golf. They were on this, that, the other. I'm not saying that any of the on the phone. I'm not saying any of these things are sin. Sometimes I'm jealous that I don't have anything other than a a few plants to fool with. when I am in need of of course I wouldn't I wouldn't play with some of you if I was stressed anyway I love you all come go play golf with us are you kidding I know how that works like when people sit down beside can I sit here and eat I won't bother you. I won't ask any question. I won't say it never never goes that way, right? So, if I need any any kind of I shut my door and I either pray, which is most of the time, or I fool with a little plant or something. I I enjoy it. So, I'm not against hobby. I'm not against a pastime. My some of my family likes to play board games. They're not none of them fanatics about it because they'll go for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and and not so but any of these things I I I like sometime to see some documentary or something I I like or I'm interested in. I enjoyed The Chosen. I know a lot of people found every every mistake in it and and and I could have too, but I found rather found the things that encouraged me and inspired me and and helped me and explained a thing or two for me even and loved it. So, I'm not against I'm not against you don't have to be religious all the time. I'm not talking about that. But I'm talking about the fact that it had to be the elders because they had sort of lived their life and had their fun and now they were taking their old age serious and and they sat there every day because they knew somebody wasn't going to get along with somebody and somebody's cow was going to meander over into somebody else's field and somebody was going to have to set this thing straight and somebody was going to have to decide what would be the recompense and what would be the restitution and how it' all be solved. None of that sounds interesting to me in the natural. I don't do well settling uh earthly disputes. I don't I don't feel like I have the wisdom to make my own decision if the Lord doesn't help me. So, I certainly don't think I have the wisdom to fix everybody else's situation. But I have an addiction. And that addiction is I love when he gives me an assignment at the gate when he said, "This is what I want you to pray over, and this is what I want you to declare, and this is what I want you to prophesy, and this is the scripture I want you to read out loud. And you may not see the results. You may not hear of the results, but if you'll be obedient to me, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; I will increase the jurisdiction of your authority. and I'll come back to you again &gt;&gt; with another assignment. We're coming to the end of this thing and there's going to have to be a Joshua generation raising up now &gt;&gt; and there going to have to be some younger judges at the gate. There's going to have to be some younger spiritual authorities at the gate &gt;&gt; because we're coming to the end of this thing and we're not going to be able to wait until you're 50, 60, 70, 80 years old. You're going to have to ask the Lord if you if you care at all. If you care at all about the Lord's business, if you care at all about the Lord's work, &gt;&gt; you're going to have to make yourself available. &gt;&gt; And in order to do that, you're going to have to pull away from some of the other things. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to somehow overcome the need for somebody to stroke your hair &gt;&gt; and tell you that it's going to be all right. It's going to be all right whether your pastor tells you so or not. It's going to be all right whether your mommy tells you so or not. It's going to be all right whether your husband tells you so or not. It's going to be all right because God's word said &gt;&gt; you're going to make it. &gt;&gt; I believe that today &gt;&gt; without hearing a song, without hearing a sermon. I believe that today. But now Jason, tomorrow I may come to work singing I'm going to make it. You already said I would because I woke up not so sure just like you. But I sing my way there or I pray my way there or I read the word to get me there or I hear the message to get me there and by the time I the day is done I may be beat or whipped or whatever. You never know what you're going to go through in the course of a day and there are times that I believe it all day long and I head home and before I get home I feel the same kind of things you do. The squeeze is coming on the emotion. You're feeling this. You're thinking of that. All this stuff comes piling on again. And you know what I have to do sometime going home? Turn off the radio. Turn off the preaching. Turn off the music. And I just hum. He's already said I would. On occasion, I text Brother Gley, I could use some extra prayer. It's it's rare, but I do when I feel like I really need to. Rare have I ever made a post or because I know how hard it is when you're there to think your leader is there. And I made up my mind. I'm not I'm not a hero. I'm a I'm a rotten man. I'm not trying to boast. I'm telling you what I have to tell myself. This weight of this hour shouldn't just be on a handful of people's shoulders. It's got to be on a generation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we used to say the the generals, the older ones, but now we have to say that we're coming to Moses is dead, &gt;&gt; but I'll be with you. Just like I was with him &gt;&gt; and I'll help you make it through &gt;&gt; if you'll hold on to me. &gt;&gt; Anybody believe it? &gt;&gt; All right. It's 129. I'm hurrying. She once slew lions. She once carried gates, which means her prayers, the prayers of the Pentecostal church, shifted governments, changed nations. There's no authority in all of the heavenly realm that moves the supernatural hand of God like bridal intercession, like the cry of sons. And bridal intercession is different because it comes out of a place of intimacy and relationship. It's not begging your father or pleading with your husband. &gt;&gt; It's understanding that you're his wife because he wanted you. &gt;&gt; I don't know why, but he did. And here we are. And so I don't have to beg him. He wants to help us. He wants to help this church. &gt;&gt; He wants to help our young people. He wants to help this little bride. &gt;&gt; He wants to help reposition us all back to what once made us strong. &gt;&gt; You take the supernatural out of this message. You don't have much left. &gt;&gt; Then it's just doctrine. But you take the supernatural and you take the truth that was revealed and the doctrine that was made plain and you've got everything you need to whip the devil every day of your life, 24 hours a day if that's what it takes, 365 days of the year. This Pentecostal church that we so quickly criticize and condemn because we've seen how the mighty have fallen and we forget that God has kept and preserved a remnant of which I'm a part and which many of you are a part of. and and we think it's all in vain. It wasn't in vain. What God did in Pentecost was real &gt;&gt; and it wasn't until men tried to keep propping it up instead of doing it God's way &gt;&gt; that it began to get corrupt. She once shook nations. This Pentecostal experience swept the globe one generation ago. I want you to watch this. Approximately 644 million people. 644 million people worldwide consider themselves to be part of a Pentecostal or charismatic movement. 644 million. That accounts for about 8% of the global population. 8% of the people on the planet claim to have had a Pentecostal experience. And you tell me it's dead and over and these children don't count and this generation doesn't matter and it all ended in 77 and their souls don't matter. Sure they matter. Sure they matter. That's why that that harvest will have to come when the bride steps forward to do his work. Quick, short, but powerful. Are you still with me? Nearly 26% nearly 26% of all Christians consider themselves to be Pentecostal. This includes denominational Pentecostals like neo Pentecostal, classic Pentecostals, charismatics and independent movements and is expanding rapidly. Out of the 644 million people who claim to have had a Pentecostal experience, 92 million of them are classic Pentecostals. That's Assemblies of God, Church of God, uh, and others. United Pentecostal, 234 million charismatics. That's over double classic Pentecostals. And you sure can tell it by the confused mess their church is in today. We needed some We needed some uh oldtime Holy Ghost preaching, singing, shouting, praying, Bible thumping. That's what we needed. Instead of so much weirdness, instead of somebody's zipper vibrating and you're trying to interpret it, will you please interpret? Will you please tell me what it means? I think my I feel my zipper vibrating as though God is trying to send you a message through your zipper. Can you imagine such a thing? I'll give you the interpretation of that. The bass is too loud. That's why your zipper's vibrating. God ain't saying anything except turn down the base. But that's what they talk. Or they want to hand you an indivi an invisible sword. I don't need one I can't see. &gt;&gt; I need one I can see. Cuz I'm already fighting an invisible enemy. &gt;&gt; So I need a weapon I can get a hold of. &gt;&gt; And I got it. If you've got the word, you've got the sword. &gt;&gt; If you've got the revelation of the word, you've got the sword. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And so there's 234 million charismatics within traditional denominations and 259 million within independent churches. So some estimates suggest that if those who have had the Pentecostal experience but remained in their mainline churches and if the broader definitions of the charismatic movement were considered the number would be 1 billion. Could be as many as 1 billion people alive on the planet right now who claim to have had an encounter with the Holy Ghost. And the highest concentrations of those are in Africa. 230 million Africans claim to have had a Holy Ghost encounter. 195 million in Latin America. Maybe it's cuz they know how to praise. Listen, don't you feel sorry for poor little Asia? I know there's a lot of folks there that hadn't been reached yet, but already 125 million in Asia. And then there's North America, 68 million. So the power that God poured out at Isusa Street, the same power that he poured out on the day of Pentecost has had far more effect in other nations &gt;&gt; than this nation. &gt;&gt; And I know the answer to that. I know why it's been because she turned down the word. &gt;&gt; She wanted the feeling. She wanted the sensation. She wanted the experience, but she didn't want the word. &gt;&gt; She didn't want the standard. &gt;&gt; She didn't want Jesus name baptism. &gt;&gt; That put her on the other side of the other side of the tracks, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so it's a sad sad thing to think about. And then on the other hand, it's a great thing because the gospel has gone out and many of now what grieves my heart is they don't know what I know. And they're not going to know it because I tell them. They're only going to know it because I live it. Because they have to see it. And I don't blame them, but they will. And that short demonstration of God's full adoption power. Those dread champions will raise up out of a Joshua generation and complete the work. Yes, sir. they will complete the work. So they need to be protected and they need to be prayed for and they don't need to be soothed and petted. They may need it. They may want it, but that's not what's that's not the answer, Samson. That was not the answer. It cost you more than it was comfort. You don't need to be soothed. You don't need to be petted. You don't need to be celebrated. I want to and I will. But that's not your need. Your need is to see your need and pour your heart out to the only one who can equip you. Because as sure as I'm standing here, the Moses generation is leaving us one at a time. And the only reason why they're not all gone is because God has preserved some of them to help pray us forward. Some of us to help pray you forward. I don't care which side of it I fall on. Just let me do what he's called me to do. I was going to read you again and I'm not because I need a few minutes of of something else. But I was going to read you again this story that thrills me. I I'll do it Tuesday night. I will. But I I have an example that I love. And I think I love it so much because I met Dr. Miller shook his hand and heard him tell of what God did in Argentina because people prayed before Evita Peron was married to Juan Peron, president of Argentina, God sent from Georgia, a preacher and his wife to help establish Pentecost in Argentina. And they had little strategy and seemingly were spinning their wheels with no results. And God said, "Just just call a prayer meeting." And I love the story, but I I'll I'll leave it out for now. It culminates, as you remember, with the word of the Lord that came in September, I believe it was 51. Weep no more. The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and has overcome the prince of Argentina. Didn't look like it. Avita Peron had raised up an idol, a huge statue in Buenes Aaris. She was a necromancer and a pervert sick woman. And she was like Jezebel before her was was ruling the country through her husband, pulling them further and further and further into witchcraft and evil. Little did she know that in the heavenlies the lion of the tribe of Judah had roared. It took a few years and a lot of faithful servants including Tommy Hicks who went at brother Brandham's request to South America and God filled those soccer stadiums. When I think about the fact that just a few years that they they some some credit Pentecost beginning in 1895, some 1901, some 1904. So somewhere between 1895 and 1904, there were zero zero people that were known who had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And now 641 million claim to have had that experience. And that's not a long time coming. That's not so long ago. Can anybody say amen? And the same thing happened in Argentina from 1949 until 1951 when God sent them in 49 and there was nobody. And in 1951 and 53, the soccer stadiums were filled with hundreds of thousands of people calling on the name of the Lord. And it started in a prayer meeting with a bunch of old old sisters. It got a hold of some young kids and they began to seek the Lord. And the son of a pastor of a Pentecostal church was so rebellious and so full of the devil that he mocked everything that God did. And one night, God showed up in his dormatory room and he ran out screaming at the top of his lungs and it started a move of God. He was in Bible school acting like a devil. It started a move of God in that place that has taken so many so many have gone on the field around the world from Argentina. Argentina has sent hundreds of thousands of missionaries to other parts of the world because somebody prayed. I'm telling you, prayer makes a difference. &gt;&gt; And if church church intercession can do that, what do you think bridal intercession would be able to do? &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; I want to read something to you and close. I'm not ready for the musicians just yet. This comes from a message, God talked to Moses, and I was hoping to get through all of this, but I didn't. Paragraph 23. Moses was a type. Can you give me just a few more minutes, please? Moses was a type of the church, a type of the organization, the law, but Moses glorified himself instead of glorifying God as a perfect type before they crossed over into the promised land. We talked about that. And that's just exactly what the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterians, Pentecost, Lutheran, and all has done tonight. They're seeing who can have the biggest crowd or the best dress or the biggest church or the finest pews. They're trying to glorify their organization until God's just moved out. That's right. But remember, Joshua was right in the church all the time. Joshua was a part of the of the Moses generation. &gt;&gt; He was the one who taken them over. And today, the very signs and wonders and phenomenals that's been in the church, every time they had a revival through any age, these signs has broke out in the church. &gt;&gt; Am I to believe that we're coming to the last great revival, the bride's revival, and these signs won't be among them? Sure, they will. &gt;&gt; If God's doing it, they have to be present. &gt;&gt; Just like Joshua come with Moses all the way through. But the church age ceased with Moses and Joshua took the children into the promised land. But that wasn't the end of the battle. We all know. And I believe that the age has come now. The miraculous, the phenomenal, the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders, this great pouring out of God's spirit. It was the third exodus in the last days. And that's the thing that'll bring faith into the people. That'll take rapturing faith. That'll take a rapturing faith that'll take the church into glory. He said this move. Where is this move? All we need is to reposition ourselves. &gt;&gt; Throw our arms around the absolute. &gt;&gt; And say, "If I live or die, I'm going to live or die by this book." &gt;&gt; I need the I need the message. I need my pastor. I need the five-fold ministry. But that word is my anchor. Because men can fail me and disappoint me, but the word never fails. &gt;&gt; Men have a tendency to say one thing and do another sometime, but the word never compromises. The word never fails. &gt;&gt; He said, I believe this age has come now. He said, "How can the church be raptured when we haven't even got faith for healing?" This isn't to This isn't to belittle anybody that's sick. We've got to have rapturing faith first. That's right. How that God moves by his spirit. Signs and wonders begin to follow everywhere. God begins to move. Signs and wonders follows God. The world has always stoen criticized it from Adam down. They've done it every time. It's nothing new today that you should be criticized for accepting Jesus Christ. Now, if you accept it in some fanaticism or persecuted for the wrong thing, well, you deserve it. But he said, "Now look, if you've really God is working with you, proving himself by Bible evidence of signs and wonders, then you rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven." Are you here? For great is your reward in heaven. Moses in his journey bringing the children of Israel, God gave him a promise. Now, as God led that in the natural, led that in the natural, so is he leading the church today in the spiritual. He's He has to be. He has to be. &gt;&gt; Now, they were going to a promised land out of a chaos into a promised land from the ridiculous. Isn't that where we are in the ridiculous? This world around us. We need to move into the se into into the sublime. Musicians, come on. I I can't get to it. I want to I want to make sure before we go that you understand who this Joshua is that's going to lead this generation. It won't be a preacher or a or a prophet. It won't be an apostle, an evangelist. In the in the adoption message, what an appropriate message. Paragraph 69. Our Ephesians, our Joshua, &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Spirit. Joshua means Jesus, Savior, Yeshua. Joshua meaning the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as that was in the natural that he is our great warrior. The Holy Ghost is our great warrior. He's our great leader. &gt;&gt; We're going to follow him across the Jordan &gt;&gt; into the inheritance of the promise. As God was with Joshua, so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about &gt;&gt; getting us repositioned &gt;&gt; on the absolute. As God was, where am I? He's our great leader. As God was with Joshua, so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about. Thank you. And when sin comes in the camp, listen now. And when sin comes in the camp, the Holy Spirit demands a halt. &gt;&gt; What's wrong here in this church? Something's wrong. Oh, can't you see how we got too many sons of kiche now? Too many souls coming from seminaries and theological schools and going out and teaching this perverse things as the Bible said they would do. Seemingly not having the faith, separating themselves from you, having no fellowship with you and so forth, having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away. They don't know where they come from. They can't give any reason. We read that in the '9s and we're sure it's the Pentecostal denominations, the Samson of our day who's fallen. And now we read it in 2026 and and we're not so sure that it was just the old Pentecostal mess. But even in our own ranks and perhaps even in our own church, we've let the Holy Ghost slip. Perhaps we're not making room for him as much as we have in times past. And God is giving us an opportunity &gt;&gt; to go back to the basic and let God be God. &gt;&gt; Anybody want God to be God &gt;&gt; with all my heart? That's what I want. This Joshua generation will not walk in bride pride but will be dressed in the righteous garment of humility. You you can put on false humility, but it doesn't penetrate bondage and addiction in people's lives like the true humility of the Holy Spirit. There's a time to plat the whip. There's also a time to weep and there's also a time to say, "I'm starting over. I'm going back to what I know." If David would have taken the new and wore the ecclesiastical garments that Saul was willing to give him to go into battle, there'd still be not only Goliath, but all of his brothers. And you and I might be facing not only spiritual giants, but we might be facing physical giants even in this day had that thing not been dealt with. But he said, I it's mighty nice of you, king, but I' I've never proven that ecclesiastical vest. I I wouldn't know. It's too big for me. I'll just go with what I know. A slingshot and some smooth stones. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he went down to the valley of Elah and he picked up five smooth stones. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Brother Bam loved that. F A I T H J- E S U. Oh, he loved to go through all of that. Not with the new thing, not with the modern thing, not with the improved version, but with all he knew. This is what took down the bear. And this is what dealt with the lion. And this is what I know God will use to deal with this uncircumcised Philistine. You see, a Joshua generation will have to go back to the simplicity of their forefathers when they learned to trust God against all odds. when there was no reason to believe. Many of our forefathers were first generation Pentecostals who who weren't raised in Pentecostal environment. I even heard Jimmy Swagger one time in a youth camp that we were also a speaker at. I heard him tell the testimony. His parents didn't want his dad particularly didn't want him to have anything to do with Pentecost. They were considered uh irrational and trash. And his dad wasn't much better, but he didn't want him to run down there with the with his his mother. Jimmy Swagger's dad's mother had received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he'd he'd tell him, "You go down there one more time and let her talk that foolishness to you and I'll beat you with a belt." And he said, "I made up my mind that I had to have what she had." So against orders in fear of a bloody bottom, but I ran as fast as I could get down that dirt road in Faraday, Louisiana, and run into my grandmother's house. She'd say, "Granny, tell me one more time how you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost." And she'd say, "Child, I've done told you. I've done told you every day this week." He said, "Would you tell me one more time? You dry the dishes and I'll go sit down with you. You help me dry the dishes and I'll go sit down with you and tell you one more time." And he was so hungry and so desperate that he would do it day after day after day after day. And he said, "I I knew the details. I could have told it better than she could, but I really wanted her to tell it again because at the end of it, she would begin to feel it. And at the end of it, she'd start waving her little hands and hallelujah. And &gt;&gt; the next thing you know, she'd be speaking in heavenly language. And I knew my old grandma didn't know that. I knew that that was God. Now, the church perverted that and and and twisted that and made it a system. And they tried to build with flesh and carnality what God had birthed by the spirit. God sent a restoration prophet who preached like a man from another world about the need for a true Holy Ghost baptism. &gt;&gt; And a whole generation of businessmen and a whole generation of Baptist Methodists and a whole generation of even menite &gt;&gt; That's right. received the Holy Ghost, went for a healing, went to be healed, and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and it was it was part of the springboard for what we've just talked about. 641 million people around the world. numbers don't mean a thing to me except that I wanted you to know that it wasn't all man-made and it wasn't all phony and it wasn't all painted to fire. &gt;&gt; Some of it was real. Now we need this Joshua generation and I don't know where I fit again because in 1990 and 93 and 95 and 97 and through some of the I could identify with that little boy. I could really identify with him. Lord, I'm one of them. Make me one of them. Let me be one of them. And now, my goodness, I'm 58 years old in a few months. And I don't I don't think I can really identify myself with that little lad. I don't care if I'm a Moses generation or a John. I don't care what part of the fence I fall on, but I have to see it. I have to see a generation of young people who will cry out for the fulfillment of this full adoption. Only God can do it. Preaching won't motivate you to do it. Only God can sovereignly instigated and inspire it and ignite it. And I don't know when it'll be, but forgive me. Forgive me if I don't have time to massage your brow and pet you and pamper you to serve the Lord. I'm busy. I'm busy in the spirit. I try to be busy in the natural to do anything and everything that I can to fulfill my part of the of the role. I just want to see God fulfilling his word in in a people that he has been positioning. He's been preparing us. He's been moving us and getting us in place. And when I see us reaching for other things and satisfied with other things and longing to have a king like other nations, why can't we have this and why can't we do that and why can't we do the other and why can't we be more like other churches? is I realize we haven't yet seen who we are and why we're here. May God open our eyes. May God open our eyes. May God open our ears. May God burn out any hypocrisy that's in me. May God restore and renew our passion for all that he has prepared for his bride. May God raise up right here among us a generation that will take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Not just talk the talk, but live this life. And if we don't if we don't do it, if these young married couples don't take this mantle and do something with it, your children, not only will you suffer, &gt;&gt; but I tell you, your children will suffer. And I'll go a step further. They're already suffering. &gt;&gt; Your children are already suffering because you won't make him your number one priority. If you won't point them way, if you won't set the example, if you won't lead them in, they'll find a they'll find a door. They'll find somewhere to go in. But it might not be where we would want them. If they don't hear mama praying, if they don't hear daddy praying, if they don't ever see a Bible in your lap, if you don't ever sing a Bible song with them, if you don't ever teach them the simplicity of the gospel, how do you think you say, "Well, my mom and daddy didn't teach me and I came to it." They're not promised that. You weren't promised it. &gt;&gt; God's mercy brought you through, but they're not promised that. He's coming. He's coming in us. He's coming in us. He's coming in us before he comes for us. He's coming in us &gt;&gt; before he comes for us. He's coming in us. &gt;&gt; He's coming in us &gt;&gt; before he comes for us. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; You discouraged pastor? Not at all. I'm so filled with hope because I know it doesn't take 75 young pe young people. It only takes one. Let one get his wick lit. Just that one. And if he won't go weird, just let one get his wick lit and he won't be so strange you can't talk to him or her. She won't be so but she'll be salty. He'll be salty. He won't preach at you. He'll just live it in front of you and you watch what happens. I wish somebody's soul would catch on fire. Don't you bless Jesus is mine. He's been my fourth man in the fire.

We can't quit preparing, &gt;&gt; borrowing vessels all the things that we've been told to prepare ourselves to catch the wave of God, to catch the bride's move. We must keep digging ditches. &gt;&gt; It's hard to dig ditches when you you see no cloud. &gt;&gt; But if God said, "I'm going to fill them up," he's going to fill them up. We have to keep doing. Be not weary and welloing for you will reap in due season if you faint not. There is no discharge in this warfare. &gt;&gt; There's no respit. You you got to show up in him. I mean in him. Not only physically, spiritually in him. It's a good idea to pray to prepare your heart. Not wait until you get here, but prepare your heart leading up to the service. Some of you could come on in from the vestibule and and spend I know some of you with small children, it's almost impossible to do, but we don't all have little ones. Five minutes in the altar can prepare your heart &gt;&gt; for what God wants to do for you and through you &gt;&gt; or three minutes on your seat there with your head bowed just saying, "Lord, prepare me for what you want to do today." I have to say you so many of you are so faithful to be here and I'm so thankful to have a group of people like that but we could prepare for the service. Some of you have never let that be your habit and you're missing out. You're missing out. Ask the Lord for simple strategies. I don't think any of us are ready or desire to make complicated equations of how to get the spirit of God to have freedom among us. Nobody wants to try to map it out with geometry, but just Lord, show me something simple that I can do that will help create the atmosphere. maybe praying more for the musicians and praying more for the song leaders and service leaders. Spend an extra minute saying, "Lord, may they not be in your way, but may they be channels of your glory, pipelines for the oil of the Holy Ghost to flow through. There's little little things, simple things that we can do to begin to prepare our hearts. Now is the time. Now is the hour. I'm not trying to whip anybody up, but now is the time for you to ask the Lord. You that have waited on the rest of us, you ask the Lord what he would have you to do and do it. You don't have to toot your horn. You don't have to make it so like you're flying a flag to show us all. Just do it. Be obedient because what you do in secret, God said if you'll be faithful, he will reward you openly. &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing. And if you'll do that and do it under the Lord, he said he would reward us. Father, here we are today. To me, a lot of the cream of the crop is represented in this room today. And I'm asking you, Lord, to help us prepare ourselves for whatever it is that you want to do in our midst. May we get all the dead cats off the line and and get all the vessels borrowed and all the the ditches dug and anything you would have us to do &gt;&gt; to get ready to host the fullness &gt;&gt; of your manifested presence. bring us up. And may there be deliverance from depressions and anxieties and complexes. And Lord, we surrender. You ought to tell him right now. I'm going to let you have your words or else you're just listening to me. You've done that for two hours now. Use your words and tell him right now what you want him to do for just another few minutes. Would you do it? Lift up your voice to the Lord. Here we are, Lord. Here we are. Shift. Well, I don't know what to ask for. Then just say, "Come have your way in me, Lord. Come have your way in me. I'm ready to do it. Whatever you'd have me to do, I want to do it. I want to be a blessing to the body. I want to be an instrument of inspiration. I want to inspire others to go all the way. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to be a forerunner in the house, Lord, if you'll show me what to do. &gt;&gt; Jesus, I surrender. I yield. &gt;&gt; You never fail, Lord. You haven't given up on us. And that that thrills me. &gt;&gt; You see all things May we keep positioning. Open our understanding. Show us the way up is down. May we cloak ourselves in genuine humility from the bottom of who we are. May we recognize that we can do nothing without you. &gt;&gt; Our reasoning, our intellect, our natural ability is only a hindrance sometime. It's our yieldedness, our willingness that you're looking for. It's our obedience you desire. &gt;&gt; May we hold to your head. May we hold to your head for such an hour as this. May we never turn loose of your head. Sing some more and go when you're ready to do that. Blessed asssurance. Jesus is mine. And he's been my fourth man in the fire time after time. Born of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I'm washed in his blood. And what he did for me on Calvary is more than enough. And I trust in God, my savior, the one who will never fail.

All is at rest cuz I know the author of tomorrow has ordered my steps. So this is my story and this is my song. I'm praising my risen king and savior all the day long.
