TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i think sometimes we say i love him like he's a flavor like i prefer chocolate over vanilla but i want you to know that's not loving christ loving him is being willing to lay down everything that we have everything that we are everything that we're fond of everything we like laying it all down and loving him really loving him when we live in that place of relationship it is impossible to do it without joy you can't live in that love and rebel against what god's trying to do for you and through you and around you when you are living in the love of god you enjoy that time with him but but you don't completely cut yourself off from the rest of the body of christ because there's so much love in your heart the love you have for him the love he has for you you want to spread some of that around when you find something you really like that you really are fond of you want to share that you want to talk about that with somebody else i'm telling you the bride of christ must have communion with him we must have oneness we must have abiding we must have dwelling we must have intimacy with him it's about leaning on our beloved it's about trusting that if we can't stand on our own his shoulder remain solid it's not the will of the lord for us to only abide in that joy and have that joy remain uh dwelling in us when everything is going good that's not the joy of the lord the joy of the lord is what sustains us when everything's going bad the joy of the lord is what becomes a weapon when we understand that praise is not just uh standing in awe of him and lauding him as king of kings and lord of lords but praise is actually something that shifts the spiritual atmosphere around us because when the praises go up the blessings of the lord start filtering down that's when joy becomes a strategy to win a battle that needs to be won come on now shout when they heard the sound of the trumpet they shouted i don't know if it was a trumpet or the shouting i don't know what it was it was those sounds probably blending together in obedience to the lord that caused that wall to fall flat it just disintegrated and they didn't even have to step over it they just walked right in the strangest silliest strategy that you've ever heard for winning a battle and taking a wall city and yet it's what god chose i'm telling you if you will choose today to remain in the joy of the lord no matter what's going on in your life if you will choose today to remain in the joy of the lord no matter what's going on in your life you will find the victory it's on the other side of your shout you
