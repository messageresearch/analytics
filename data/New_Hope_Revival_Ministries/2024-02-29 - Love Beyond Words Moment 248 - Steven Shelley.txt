TRANSCRIPT
========================================
listen to me folks please it's so easy to be religious and to say I love the Lord yes and it's just words what does that look like if you really love the Lord what does that look like well I want I want to give you one example he means more to you than your buddies he means more to you than your hobbies he means more to you than your [Music] habits love the Lord is about priorities it's about placing things in the right beset in the right order and our priorities are right it's one of the reasons why fasting can be so effective is because it reminds us that the Lord is more important than the meal knowing that he hears you knowing that he sees you knowing knowing that he's mindful of you knowing that he looks at you and recognizes your love for him becomes more important let me tell you something he's jealous over you I hope you hear me he's jealous over you he loves you so much but what he wants more than anything else is to have fellowship with you and I as individuals and he wants us to come to the place where we become as a addicted to that experience to that moment of fellowship and intimacy with him more addicted it becomes more of a necessity to get along with him it becomes more of a necessity to hear his voice than to even hear your wife's Voice or your husband's Voice or your pastor's voice to long to hear the voice of the bridegroom love is not something that you can just pull out of your heart it's not something like a magic trick you can pull out of a hat God is the author of love the only way to overcome not loving one another is to draw closer to the Lord he is love amen the closer we get to God the more we'll love him the more we'll appreciate his love for us and the more we will learn to love one another the popular and the unpopular the those in our click and not in our click those we get along good with and like to relax with and those we don't like to relax with we've got to love them anyhow and it's not loving them in word that God is interested in when we learn to love one another it's not by word only it's by deed the love that God has toward us is perfected it is matured as we learn to show that love one to another and then that becomes perfect love it becomes matured love it becomes I love you whether you love me or not why don't this little bride make up our mind we're coming down off the gerbal wheel of performance we're not going to try to compare our life with someone else our family with someone else's family we're going to try to fall so in love with our brid groom that he matters more than possessions he matters more than fancy trips he's everything
