[0:00] even the spirit of laodicea would
[0:03] not be able to destroy you
[0:13] you are chosen for the job
[0:16] you were chosen for this age you were
[0:19] chosen for this generation
[0:22] and that's a powerful election
[0:26] it means that god knowing everything
[0:28] there was to know about you
[0:30] knew your way would be hard he knew you
[0:33] would have
[0:34] many obstacles he knew you would have
[0:36] many shortcomings weaknesses failures
[0:39] sin he knew that you would fight many
[0:42] battles climb many mountains swim many
[0:45] rivers
[0:46] but at the end of you he knew that even
[0:49] the spirit of the age
[0:51] even the spirit of laodicea would
[0:54] not be able to destroy you
[0:58] he saw that even in the most evil of all
[1:02] the ages
[1:03] you would potentially overcome
[1:07] that's powerful you talk about a
[1:10] cheerleader
[1:12] you talk about somebody cheering you on
[1:16] you not only have the great cloud of
[1:18] witnesses hebrews 11
[1:20] and 12 but you also have the greatest
[1:24] cheerleader
[1:24] that there ever has been you have the
[1:26] eternal spirit of god
[1:28] shaking a pom-pom
[1:32] on your behalf how do i know that
[1:35] because he placed you in laodicea
[1:37] when he gets stirred up on the inside
[1:39] and he begins to fall on this body of
[1:41] flesh
[1:41] you may find yourself doing something in
[1:43] the natural you would have never thought
[1:45] possible
[1:46] you may find yourself out running ahab's
[1:48] chariot
[1:50] you may find yourself slaying a giant
[1:52] with a slingshot
[1:54] you may find yourself dancing in the
[1:56] spirit like a wild man
[1:57] drunk on new wine you might find
[2:00] yourself shouting at the top of your
[2:02] voice forgetting about who you are
[2:05] and your reputation you've tried to
[2:07] maintain is a rock solid something i
[2:09] don't know what
[2:11] when that flesh and listen we talk about
[2:13] the flesh like it's the enemy it's not
[2:15] the enemy it just needs to get under the
[2:17] anointing
[2:19] and there's a bride in the last days
[2:22] that are going to have an anointing that
[2:24] doesn't
[2:24] fall and leave and fall and leave and
[2:26] fall and leave on their flesh
[2:28] but as they continue to surrender to the
[2:31] living word
[2:33] even their flesh receives
[2:36] a portion of the spirit of god
[2:39] that empowers them to function in a
[2:41] different way
[2:43] than those around them
