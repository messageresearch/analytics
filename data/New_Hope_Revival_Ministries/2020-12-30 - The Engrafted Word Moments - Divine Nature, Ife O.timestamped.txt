[0:00] the engrafted word has brought us a
[0:04] divine
[0:05] nature
[0:06] [Music]
[0:12] if you repented and asked him to come in
[0:15] he knew exactly
[0:16] where to go he took his holy perfect
[0:19] spirit divine nature
[0:22] fullness of god and place that
[0:26] on your human spirit and your human
[0:30] spirit was totally regenerated
[0:34] reformed transformed back
[0:37] to its original form back to what adam
[0:41] had in the garden originally before the
[0:44] fall
[0:45] so the first part of who you are that
[0:48] that experiences beaut the beauty of
[0:50] redemption
[0:51] is the spirit and now we're in the
[0:54] process
[0:55] of the soul but he wanted you to be a
[0:58] spirit-led
[0:59] being totally led by
[1:03] your spirit which is his spirit taking
[1:06] charge of your life this is what god
[1:09] wanted
[1:09] and it seemed there was no way to get it
[1:12] in the natural
[1:12] we couldn't work hard enough for it we
[1:15] couldn't dress
[1:16] holy enough to get all that in our life
[1:19] we really needed his help
[1:22] the engrafted word has brought us
[1:26] a divine nature that needs to flourish
[1:30] it needs to abound it needs to expand
[1:34] but it may not be able to accomplish for
[1:37] us
[1:38] what it is sent to us until we can
[1:40] recognize
[1:43] that it's within reach
[1:46] god placed it in the life
[1:50] of the believer
[1:56] you
