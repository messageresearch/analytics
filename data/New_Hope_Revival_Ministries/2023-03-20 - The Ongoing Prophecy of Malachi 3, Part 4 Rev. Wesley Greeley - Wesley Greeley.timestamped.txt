[1:27:20] would you turn with us today again to
[1:27:22] Malachi chapter 4.
[1:27:28] what's up
[1:27:37] we want the word to have its preeminence
[1:27:40] in this service
[1:27:43] the word is what we defeat the Devil
[1:27:46] with
[1:27:54] I would like to start in verse 13 of
[1:27:56] Malachi chapter 3 your words have been
[1:27:59] Stout against me saith the Lord
[1:28:01] yet you say what have we spoken so much
[1:28:04] against you
[1:28:05] you have said it is vain to serve God
[1:28:08] and what prophet is it that we have kept
[1:28:11] his ordinance and that we have walked
[1:28:13] mournfully before the Lord of hosts
[1:28:16] and now we call the proud happy
[1:28:19] yea they that work wickedness are set up
[1:28:22] yea they that tempt God are even
[1:28:24] delivered
[1:28:26] than they that feared the Lord spake
[1:28:28] often one to another and the Lord
[1:28:30] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[1:28:33] remembrance was written before him for
[1:28:35] them that feared the Lord and that
[1:28:37] thought upon his name
[1:28:39] and they shall be mine saith the Lord of
[1:28:42] hosts in that day when I make up my
[1:28:44] jewels and I will spare them as a man's
[1:28:47] Spirit his own son that serveth him then
[1:28:51] shall you return and discern between the
[1:28:53] righteous and the wicked between him
[1:28:56] that serveth God and him that serveth
[1:28:59] him not
[1:29:00] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:29:02] reading of his word and you may have
[1:29:04] your seats today
[1:29:07] I want to thank you for being in the
[1:29:08] house of the Lord with us
[1:29:11] God willing next Sunday brother Shelley
[1:29:13] and his family will be back
[1:29:16] uh
[1:29:17] their sabbatical will come to an end
[1:29:20] they'll be back home with us
[1:29:22] God has been good to us
[1:29:25] let us worship together you have pressed
[1:29:27] in we've pressed in together to see what
[1:29:30] the Lord would do in us and through us
[1:29:33] for us while we've been together
[1:29:35] without our pastor
[1:29:37] and I thank you that you have been
[1:29:40] willing to press in and do your part to
[1:29:44] pull the anointing in
[1:29:46] to the service God has been gracious to
[1:29:50] heal our bodies to
[1:29:52] touch Our Lives to
[1:29:55] press us along when we needed pressing
[1:29:58] sometimes that's exactly what he needs
[1:30:00] to do is to just nudge us back into the
[1:30:03] path we get out of sort sometimes and
[1:30:06] God has to do some extravagant things
[1:30:10] maybe to cause us to get back into line
[1:30:15] but he is faithful he is faithful
[1:30:20] before I go on I just want to wish
[1:30:22] brother and sister man a happy
[1:30:24] anniversary they had an anniversary on
[1:30:25] Friday the Lord bless you

[1:30:57] and friends I want to tell you again how
[1:30:59] thankful I am for this message of truth
[1:31:01] that God has given to us
[1:31:03] it is a message that was given to us and
[1:31:07] 60 years ago God broke the seals to us
[1:31:10] he he gave us what we needed from that
[1:31:13] uh from the book he helped the book to
[1:31:17] be open to us it was not a man that
[1:31:19] opened it it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:22] the lamb it was slain from before the
[1:31:24] foundation of the world and it is our
[1:31:27] duty as Believers to study it out to
[1:31:31] find what there is in this book that uh
[1:31:35] is is going to help us
[1:31:37] now I've been on this journey long
[1:31:40] enough to know that there are some
[1:31:41] passages of scripture that minister to
[1:31:44] you more frequently than others there
[1:31:47] are some passages of this book that we
[1:31:49] read and we're greatly confused by them
[1:31:53] some of these uh books in the Bible
[1:31:57] especially in the Old Testaments those
[1:31:59] little Minor Prophets we have called
[1:32:02] them uh but they were prophets
[1:32:04] nonetheless they had a calling of God to
[1:32:06] prophesy to the nation of Israel and we
[1:32:09] don't understand a lot of what they said
[1:32:12] and it seems like that it doesn't have
[1:32:15] any application my wife asked me a few
[1:32:18] weeks ago she says why is it that you're
[1:32:20] in that in those in those Minor Prophets
[1:32:23] so much I said I keep going back to read
[1:32:25] them to find out what the Lord would say
[1:32:27] to me maybe I am I'm not yet in a season
[1:32:32] of time where that that passage is
[1:32:36] applicable to me uh for the journey that
[1:32:39] I am on but somewhere along the way God
[1:32:42] chooses to take a passage of scripture
[1:32:45] and make it real to us he wants to make
[1:32:49] it real in our lives and the whole book
[1:32:52] is for our edification
[1:32:55] the entire thing and and we have been
[1:32:59] told if you can't find the Lord Jesus in
[1:33:02] every verse go back and read it again
[1:33:04] well I'm having to go back and read it
[1:33:06] again because there's some places that I
[1:33:09] can't find how it applies I know it's
[1:33:11] there because I know that everything in
[1:33:14] that older Covenant pointed toward the
[1:33:16] newer Covenant it pointed toward
[1:33:18] Abraham's seed Christ Jesus and it
[1:33:22] pointed toward Abraham's Royal seed me
[1:33:25] you and that's what it was pointing to
[1:33:28] but ultimately it was the Lord Jesus
[1:33:31] Christ that it was pointing to and to
[1:33:33] help us to see that we're a part of the
[1:33:36] story we're a part of what he wanted to
[1:33:39] do in the end time and we have been born
[1:33:43] into an age the laodicean age where that
[1:33:47] it was lukewarm
[1:33:50] a lukewarm age
[1:33:52] where that everything is just kind of
[1:33:55] so-so
[1:33:57] if it feels good do it if you don't want
[1:34:00] to do it don't do it
[1:34:02] and everybody gets this lazy attitude
[1:34:04] I'll do it if I want to do it and if I
[1:34:07] don't want to there ain't nothing you
[1:34:09] can do about it
[1:34:12] and then we bring that same attitude
[1:34:15] into the church
[1:34:17] and
[1:34:18] we try to exhort the people to worship
[1:34:22] together
[1:34:24] and then we have this understanding that
[1:34:28] we can't get anywhere by striving
[1:34:32] and so we don't want to drive you to
[1:34:34] striving by our exhortation what we
[1:34:39] really desire is before that we ever
[1:34:41] come into this building before we ever
[1:34:44] come through that green glass door back
[1:34:46] there we want to have all of the dead
[1:34:49] cats off of the line we want to have all
[1:34:52] of our issues settled and if we can't
[1:34:55] settle them we want to be able to leave
[1:34:57] them outside of that door and come
[1:35:00] inside of this building not with a heart
[1:35:02] of striving but with a heart of
[1:35:04] gratitude and with a heart of
[1:35:07] understanding that I have come to
[1:35:10] Worship the Lord and I'm not going to
[1:35:12] strive to do it I'm going to yield to do
[1:35:14] it I'm just going to say Lord I I know
[1:35:18] that I've been rotten this week I know
[1:35:21] that I've had some mistakes and some
[1:35:23] misunderstandings but I cannot afford to
[1:35:26] let them be before my face as I come
[1:35:29] into your house I've got to let them
[1:35:31] aside because I've got to press into
[1:35:33] your presence without striving
[1:35:37] too many times we come in before the
[1:35:39] Lord and not just here
[1:35:42] but we go through our day I just felt
[1:35:47] like the Lord inspired me to back up to
[1:35:49] this this verse your words have been
[1:35:52] Stout against me
[1:35:54] your words have been Stout against me
[1:35:58] and those of you that were here on
[1:36:00] Tuesday night this word stout is the
[1:36:03] same root as if when Pharaoh hardened
[1:36:06] his heart against the words of Moses or
[1:36:09] against ultimately the word of the Lord
[1:36:11] when Moses came in before pharaoh and
[1:36:15] Pharaoh says I don't have to do what you
[1:36:17] say
[1:36:18] and he hardened his heart
[1:36:20] and we have a book full of promises that
[1:36:24] God has given to us and our words have
[1:36:28] become Stout against the Lord we have
[1:36:30] really hardened our hearts at times
[1:36:33] against the Lord and we have used words
[1:36:36] that were Stout against him and we have
[1:36:40] said some of these same things what is
[1:36:42] the use
[1:36:44] what is the use
[1:36:46] why should I keep pressing why should I
[1:36:50] keep fighting why do I have to fight so
[1:36:53] hard when there's other people that it
[1:36:55] looks like it's so easy for them why why
[1:37:00] why
[1:37:01] and the words start becoming Stout
[1:37:04] against the Lord because we have
[1:37:06] hardened ourselves against the move of
[1:37:10] God to let him come and soften us
[1:37:14] so that our words can be something other
[1:37:18] than grumbling and mumbling and rather
[1:37:21] we want our words as I said a while ago
[1:37:24] we want to join our words our praise our
[1:37:28] gratitude our Thanksgiving together with
[1:37:31] the saints of God because we want the
[1:37:34] frequency to get where it needs to be
[1:37:37] now lest you think we're a bunch of
[1:37:39] Kooks frequency matters
[1:37:46] and I have heard Once Upon a Time
[1:37:50] that Enoch
[1:37:52] had a frequency had something in his
[1:37:55] voice that perhaps that was the way that
[1:37:58] he got the stones that there was sound
[1:38:02] that was made at the perhaps that was
[1:38:04] the way that the stones got into the
[1:38:06] pyramid in such a perfect shape because
[1:38:09] there was a frequency I don't know I
[1:38:12] wasn't there the Lord has not told me
[1:38:13] yes or no but this one thing I do know I
[1:38:16] have I have been in Services enough
[1:38:19] times in my life to know that there have
[1:38:22] been times that the frequency the sound
[1:38:24] the rumble the roar whatever word you
[1:38:27] want to use it has gone to a level where
[1:38:30] it started moving things there have been
[1:38:33] times where flags were flapped and
[1:38:35] popped and then there was a shattering
[1:38:38] of a of something in the spirit realm
[1:38:41] until the god came in and moved in a
[1:38:43] mighty because that the sound got right
[1:38:50] if we are constantly mumbling and
[1:38:52] grumbling
[1:38:54] we are creating a sound
[1:38:57] but it is a sound of negativity
[1:39:00] that is causing there to be a drawing of
[1:39:04] other spirits
[1:39:07] I don't know if you would remember when
[1:39:10] I've ministered back in December and I
[1:39:12] had a demonstration here about the light
[1:39:15] and how that when uh that there was a
[1:39:19] distortion in the color even though you
[1:39:21] could still see the light through that
[1:39:24] uh that glass picture when I dumped
[1:39:27] something dark into it you could still
[1:39:29] see the light but this is the kind of
[1:39:31] things that we do in the spirit realm
[1:39:34] when we allow words to come out of our
[1:39:37] mouth that are stout against the Lord
[1:39:39] that are hardness of our heart being
[1:39:42] portrayed out of our mouth we start
[1:39:45] causing our spirit to be distorted
[1:39:50] you see in the Book of Revelation and in
[1:39:52] the Book of Ezekiel both of these men
[1:39:55] went into the spirit realm they went to
[1:39:57] a place around the throne and there is a
[1:40:00] perfect color around the throne my God
[1:40:04] exudes in a perfect color and the Bible
[1:40:09] talks about this rainbow color that
[1:40:12] exudes out of the Throne of God it's a
[1:40:15] perfect color and when I as a Believer
[1:40:18] am carrying the nature and the character
[1:40:20] of God I am emitting these colors as
[1:40:24] well
[1:40:25] but there are times when my words my
[1:40:28] Stout words against the Lord they begin
[1:40:30] to distort my color
[1:40:33] and when my color is distorted I begin
[1:40:37] to emit something that draws demon
[1:40:40] spirits
[1:40:42] and as I am drawing demon Spirits I know
[1:40:45] this is a little much for some of you
[1:40:48] but as I am drawing demon Spirits then I
[1:40:51] am wondering why that I am fighting such
[1:40:54] a battle it is because then my words
[1:40:57] have become Stout against the Lord and I
[1:41:01] have allowed that perfect color that is
[1:41:04] bus that is supposed to be the part of a
[1:41:06] Believer it is now distorted and it is
[1:41:10] causing something in the spirit realm
[1:41:13] that I can't see with a natural eye but
[1:41:16] I can feel what's happening
[1:41:21] and then we start beating the air
[1:41:26] and we wonder why that we are in such a
[1:41:30] fix but it is because that God is
[1:41:34] calling a body of people into an hour
[1:41:38] where that we will be held accountable
[1:41:42] for Every Idle Word that comes out of
[1:41:46] our mouth
[1:41:48] we're getting closer and closer you see
[1:41:52] I don't know how to describe this in
[1:41:55] degrees but I believe as we grow in the
[1:41:58] grace and the knowledge of the lord we
[1:42:01] are held more accountable we are more
[1:42:05] responsible in degrees as God turns up
[1:42:09] that Notch however that looks like and
[1:42:12] we're responsible in more degrees for
[1:42:14] the words that come out of our mouth
[1:42:16] when we're a young Christian and we've
[1:42:19] just accepted the Lord Jesus God looks
[1:42:22] over a lot of our ignorance
[1:42:25] he looks over some of our stuff but as
[1:42:28] we are growing in Grace and knowledge
[1:42:30] God says okay that doesn't that I can't
[1:42:35] Overlook that anymore
[1:42:37] you're going to have to you're going to
[1:42:39] have to learn some lessons from that
[1:42:43] now because that we're believers
[1:42:47] we get Fiery trials
[1:42:50] we've discussed this over the past weeks
[1:42:52] we get Fiery trials
[1:42:55] and these fiery trials are not to
[1:42:58] destroy you
[1:43:00] these fiery trials are to prove you
[1:43:04] to see that you will come out on the
[1:43:06] other side with victory
[1:43:09] and then what happens is you come on the
[1:43:11] other side with Victory this gets turned
[1:43:14] up another notch
[1:43:17] now you're held more accountable
[1:43:20] the degree of to which you're held
[1:43:22] accountable it's turned up a notch
[1:43:26] it's called a test so that you can come
[1:43:28] out with a testimony
[1:43:33] you go through the fire so that when you
[1:43:36] come out the other side you are proved
[1:43:40] but what we find out as Believers the
[1:43:43] test never ends
[1:43:46] the one test ends but you go into
[1:43:50] another one
[1:43:51] it's the same way when these kids go to
[1:43:54] school as they're learning they get a
[1:43:56] test and then they start on the next
[1:43:59] chapter of the book and they have to
[1:44:01] learn some more and that at the end of
[1:44:03] that chapter they learn another they
[1:44:05] they have to take another test and the
[1:44:07] teacher has to make the she has to make
[1:44:10] the Judgment of whether she taught them
[1:44:13] well enough as she's grading the papers
[1:44:16] and everybody comes out with an F
[1:44:21] now the teacher has to back up and say
[1:44:25] are these kids
[1:44:28] not able to learn this or have I been a
[1:44:31] poor teacher
[1:44:32] but see the Holy Ghost doesn't have to
[1:44:34] do that because he's the perfect teacher
[1:44:38] he's perfect I am the one that's
[1:44:40] imperfect
[1:44:42] we as people are the imperfect ones so
[1:44:45] the Holy Ghost he comes back and he says
[1:44:47] well you passed that test so it's on to
[1:44:49] the next chapter
[1:44:54] I don't know about you when you went to
[1:44:56] school
[1:44:57] but as the next chapter came
[1:45:00] it got more difficult
[1:45:02] because I had already learned something
[1:45:04] in the previous chapter that was going
[1:45:07] to be a predecessor it was going to hold
[1:45:11] me to understand the next chapter and so
[1:45:14] I had to learn it and I needed to pass
[1:45:16] the test
[1:45:17] now there were some in the class that
[1:45:19] didn't pass the test
[1:45:21] and when they did not pass the test you
[1:45:25] could watch them through the next season
[1:45:27] as they became more and more confused
[1:45:31] because they didn't learn the previous
[1:45:33] chapter
[1:45:35] and so as they got to this next chapter
[1:45:37] because the teacher had to go on the
[1:45:40] teacher is wondering why and so maybe
[1:45:42] that student needed a private tutor or
[1:45:45] maybe a student could help them out on
[1:45:48] their level and they could give a nugget
[1:45:50] of some sort that would unlock the key
[1:45:53] to help that person to understand the
[1:45:56] chapter that they had just been through
[1:45:57] so now they could go on to the next
[1:45:59] chapter now as we're in a body of
[1:46:02] Believers and we're in this walk with
[1:46:05] the Lord and we understand that God has
[1:46:08] given us tests these fiery trials and he
[1:46:11] he is
[1:46:13] helped us to realize that we as
[1:46:16] believers
[1:46:18] cannot continue to be babies
[1:46:23] we're not in daycare anymore
[1:46:27] not in first grade
[1:46:30] not an elementary school
[1:46:32] see you go to the book of uh first John
[1:46:35] I believe and and John is talking and he
[1:46:38] and he says little children
[1:46:41] and then he says young man
[1:46:43] and he talks to the older man and then
[1:46:46] he comes back to the little children and
[1:46:48] the young man because there's different
[1:46:50] levels of understanding for all these
[1:46:52] groups and God has allowed us to grow
[1:46:56] and parents have to help their children
[1:46:59] to grow parents have to assist uh well
[1:47:03] here the mothers are the teachers it's
[1:47:07] going to say the mothers have to assist
[1:47:09] the teacher when the child comes home
[1:47:10] from school but you've got them all day
[1:47:15] but you're teaching them
[1:47:17] and maybe Daddy has to help to teach
[1:47:20] them something that maybe Mom can't
[1:47:23] explain just right that's where the LIE
[1:47:25] there is the fivefold ministry
[1:47:28] because all of these Ascension gifts the
[1:47:31] pastors the prophets the apostles the
[1:47:34] evangelists the teachers that they're
[1:47:36] all a part of these Ascension gifts and
[1:47:39] all that we bring to you is a word from
[1:47:43] the Lord that is built upon the apostles
[1:47:46] and Prophets
[1:47:49] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:47:52] is not going to move
[1:47:57] the foundation of the Apostles and
[1:48:00] Prophets remains but the Ascension gifts
[1:48:04] the five-fold ministry we have to go
[1:48:07] before the Lord and all of us are
[1:48:10] different and we all have a different
[1:48:12] way of administering our gift and giving
[1:48:14] it to you and some can take it from a
[1:48:17] teacher and and they have a hard time
[1:48:20] they have a hard time receiving from a
[1:48:22] fiery evangelist
[1:48:25] some people can receive from a quiet
[1:48:29] pastor and others one allowed
[1:48:33] Evangelistic kind of Pastor
[1:48:36] everybody receives different
[1:48:39] but the five-fold Ascension gifts by the
[1:48:42] grace of God we Ascend in prayer and in
[1:48:45] the throne room and we get something
[1:48:47] from the Lord and we come back down to
[1:48:50] earth and we present it but it has to be
[1:48:53] a grounded on the foundation of the
[1:48:55] Apostles and Prophets
[1:49:00] so we give you what it is that God gives
[1:49:04] to us
[1:49:05] and you have to take it and you have to
[1:49:07] chew on it I have to chew on it even
[1:49:10] though I'm the one that is presenting it
[1:49:12] or whatever preacher is presenting it we
[1:49:14] chew on it we we uh try to allow the
[1:49:18] Holy Spirit to let it work in our lives
[1:49:21] as we desire it to work in your lives
[1:49:23] and under the anointing there are things
[1:49:26] that are said that when we get out from
[1:49:28] under the anointing we may not have
[1:49:31] realized that we even said it
[1:49:34] but it is all a part of the delivery
[1:49:36] system that God gives in the end time
[1:49:40] because he desires for every one of us
[1:49:43] to grow and so as we grow and
[1:49:46] what we used to get by with
[1:49:51] we don't get by with today
[1:49:56] and real true believers
[1:49:59] don't carry an attitude of what can I
[1:50:03] get by with today
[1:50:06] True Believers say Lord how can I yield
[1:50:10] today
[1:50:11] what it is what is it that you want out
[1:50:14] of me
[1:50:16] that you would like for me to yield to
[1:50:20] you today
[1:50:22] how can I become more like you
[1:50:27] and God takes you through these seasons
[1:50:30] of time where he lets you be a child
[1:50:36] when I was a child
[1:50:39] I spoke as a child
[1:50:41] I acted as a child
[1:50:48] I think we have enough children around
[1:50:50] here
[1:50:51] to know what children act like
[1:50:54] especially when they don't get their way
[1:51:03] then we begin to question Lord am I like
[1:51:06] some of those children
[1:51:09] when I don't like what you request of me
[1:51:13] that I throw myself in the floor and I
[1:51:16] beat my head against the floor and I
[1:51:17] flop my legs up and down and I say I
[1:51:19] don't want to do it I don't want to do
[1:51:21] it I don't want to do it
[1:51:27] and the Lord says go ahead lay there and
[1:51:29] beat your head against the floor if you
[1:51:30] want to
[1:51:37] you ever felt that way as an adult
[1:51:40] where you just felt like throwing
[1:51:42] yourself in the floor and just having a
[1:51:44] big temper tantrum against the Lord
[1:51:49] I have
[1:51:54] now I I have to be honest with you and
[1:51:56] tell you I don't remember doing that as
[1:51:58] a child I very well may have you could
[1:51:59] have to ask my mother Adam no don't
[1:52:01] remember
[1:52:04] did I did she say I did I don't know I
[1:52:08] don't know
[1:52:10] and I don't
[1:52:11] I don't really get that way very often
[1:52:14] but there are some times that God makes
[1:52:16] a request of you
[1:52:18] that you don't want to do
[1:52:25] and the struggle goes on
[1:52:28] on the inside of you
[1:52:32] and it boils and it boils and it boils
[1:52:39] remember brother Branham preaching about
[1:52:41] a message called letting off the
[1:52:43] pressure
[1:52:45] because a lot of times when God requests
[1:52:48] something of us
[1:52:50] if we don't yield it to him and we allow
[1:52:53] that thing to go around and around and
[1:52:55] around around in our mind we become like
[1:52:57] a pressure cooker
[1:53:00] and I've heard enough stories in fact I
[1:53:02] think my mother had one to explode the
[1:53:04] top and it ripped the range hood off
[1:53:06] there's massive pressure inside of that
[1:53:10] pressure cooker and things happen when
[1:53:13] that pressure is not properly dealt with
[1:53:16] and so it builds up and builds up until
[1:53:18] that container can no longer hold the
[1:53:20] pressure that's inside of it and
[1:53:22] something's going to give
[1:53:24] there's only so much pressure that that
[1:53:28] pot can stand and Friends there's only
[1:53:30] so much pressure that you can stand
[1:53:35] and then what usually happens is we blow
[1:53:39] up
[1:53:40] against those that were closest to
[1:53:48] we don't really mean to
[1:53:51] we may not necessarily want to but we
[1:53:53] don't let the pressure off properly
[1:53:58] God gave us a means to let the pressure
[1:54:02] off
[1:54:04] and that part of that is by praising him
[1:54:10] using your voice
[1:54:13] because the greatest battle that's ever
[1:54:16] been fought is right here
[1:54:19] and it goes over and over and over and
[1:54:23] for every round
[1:54:25] of the speech that you hear going on in
[1:54:29] your head that you don't let the
[1:54:31] pressure off it's going to go around
[1:54:33] again and it's going to build up another
[1:54:35] degree of temperature and it's going to
[1:54:38] build up another degree of temperature
[1:54:39] and it's going to build up and if you
[1:54:42] don't do something to let the pressure
[1:54:43] off Lord I Thank you that I am blessed
[1:54:46] and highly favored
[1:54:48] thank you Lord for letting off two
[1:54:50] degrees
[1:54:55] we have been called
[1:54:57] to havely participate
[1:54:59] with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:02] to let the pressure off
[1:55:07] yet our words have become Stout against
[1:55:10] the Holy Ghost because rather than
[1:55:13] giving him praise and honor and Glory do
[1:55:16] his name We complain that we're in the
[1:55:19] shape that we're in
[1:55:22] and it doesn't let all any of the steam
[1:55:25] off
[1:55:26] all we think it has
[1:55:29] we think it has
[1:55:31] but it hasn't really because the root
[1:55:34] problem is not dealt with
[1:55:36] we've got to deal with the root problem
[1:55:38] and so as we uh come closer and closer
[1:55:43] to the coming of the Lord as we come
[1:55:46] closer and closer to rapturing Faith and
[1:55:49] divine love we are going to be required
[1:55:53] by the holy ghost that our words are
[1:55:56] going to be required of us and Every
[1:56:00] Idle Word is going to be dealt with
[1:56:04] either make the tree good and it's fruit
[1:56:07] good
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:09] or the tree evil and it's fruit evil
[1:56:12] I was not called to be an evil tree
[1:56:16] you were not called to be an evil tree
[1:56:18] you were called to be a good tree to
[1:56:22] bring forth good fruit and so we have
[1:56:24] got to actively pluck off anything
[1:56:27] that's rotten
[1:56:32] we have to allow the Holy Spirit
[1:56:36] prune
[1:56:42] why is so much
[1:56:44] in life so painful
[1:56:51] pruning
[1:56:56] yet God knows that this pruning is
[1:57:00] necessary
[1:57:03] you watch an apple tree
[1:57:09] my dad and my father-in-law both have
[1:57:12] apple trees
[1:57:14] that as these men have gotten older
[1:57:17] their apple trees have not been properly
[1:57:20] worked on
[1:57:22] they used to produce nice fruit
[1:57:25] but because that they can no longer get
[1:57:27] out there with a pair of pruning shears
[1:57:29] and keep that tree under control keep
[1:57:32] its growth down so then the tree gets
[1:57:35] bigger and bigger and bigger so the sap
[1:57:37] that comes up it's got to it's got to go
[1:57:39] to more extremities
[1:57:42] and so the fruit is not getting the
[1:57:45] nourishment that it needs
[1:57:48] because the tree has gone out of hand
[1:57:51] but if God can come along and prune us
[1:57:56] cut off those unfruitful branches
[1:58:00] things that have gone out of control
[1:58:01] this is what the fiery trials do this is
[1:58:04] what the Fuller soap does these are just
[1:58:08] different terminology for God doing
[1:58:10] things in our lives that causes the
[1:58:12] pruning process to be worked on on in US
[1:58:18] because he is not going to let you run
[1:58:21] away Wild
[1:58:24] you are not a wild horse
[1:58:29] you are not a mule
[1:58:32] you're a thoroughbred
[1:58:35] and a thoroughbred
[1:58:37] has got to be trained
[1:58:40] and this training requires a stringent
[1:58:43] process
[1:58:45] and it is it is not a feel-good process
[1:58:50] there are other people
[1:58:53] who are in a feel-good religion and
[1:58:56] that's all they'll ever have
[1:58:59] you weren't called to that I don't think
[1:59:02] I wasn't
[1:59:04] I wasn't called to that
[1:59:06] I was called to a higher calling where
[1:59:08] that the Lord would bring me into a
[1:59:11] place of perfection
[1:59:13] completion where that everything that he
[1:59:16] said in his word I say yes and amen
[1:59:19] I'm not squabbling and saying no that's
[1:59:21] not for me no that was Old Testament no
[1:59:24] that's that you know we're we're not
[1:59:27] going to discuss that because you know
[1:59:29] Paul said if if you guys don't want to
[1:59:31] do it don't do it but for me
[1:59:35] for me I want to take every word and I
[1:59:39] want it to be a completion process in my
[1:59:43] life
[1:59:43] and in order for that to happen I
[1:59:46] realize that it is necessary for me to
[1:59:48] go through the fiery trials
[1:59:50] I realized that God is he's not proven
[1:59:53] anything to himself he already knows
[1:59:59] think about that
[2:00:01] he already knows
[2:00:03] brother Joe sway he already knows
[2:00:06] he knew when job
[2:00:09] when Satan went in before him and and it
[2:00:12] was God's idea
[2:00:16] it was God's idea have you considered my
[2:00:20] servant job
[2:00:22] it was God's idea
[2:00:25] but job didn't get to see that
[2:00:28] conversation
[2:00:29] he didn't have no heads up the devil's
[2:00:32] coming
[2:00:36] God just gave the devil permission
[2:00:39] to
[2:00:41] beat you up and beat you up good
[2:00:45] job didn't get to know any of that
[2:00:51] God was working something in job
[2:00:54] but God had already seen the end of job
[2:00:57] he already knew the end
[2:00:59] and he knew that when Satan came before
[2:01:03] him he already knew the end of job's
[2:01:06] life so he could say yo Mr devil
[2:01:10] have you considered my servant job
[2:01:17] it just seems like a such an unfair
[2:01:19] process
[2:01:24] yet God knows you
[2:01:27] he knows me he knew Job and he knows
[2:01:31] what you can handle and he knows the end
[2:01:34] from the beginning
[2:01:37] all that stuff in between all those
[2:01:40] mistakes you made all that stuff you
[2:01:42] went through to get to today all that
[2:01:45] stuff God knew all about it but he
[2:01:47] didn't worry about all that in between
[2:01:48] stuff
[2:01:52] he knew your rough background he knew
[2:01:55] all the Uglies you were ever going to do
[2:01:56] he knew whether you were born in a
[2:01:59] Christian home he knew the Uglies you
[2:02:01] were going to do
[2:02:04] he knew all the Uglies I was gonna do
[2:02:07] yet he could see my end
[2:02:10] and he could say
[2:02:12] this is one that is going to go through
[2:02:15] fiery trials and those fiery trials are
[2:02:19] going to bring him out into a place
[2:02:21] where that he is in such a perfected
[2:02:24] complete State people are going to just
[2:02:26] be baffled that they could be through so
[2:02:29] many hard things in their life yet at
[2:02:32] the end they come to a completion in the
[2:02:35] Lord Jesus Christ it is because that he
[2:02:38] has already seen the end for you
[2:02:42] the devil can do anything he wants
[2:02:48] God knows that somewhere deep down
[2:02:50] inside of you you're going to have the
[2:02:53] same response that God said about job in
[2:02:57] all of those trials he never charged God
[2:03:00] foolishly
[2:03:13] now the Bible records
[2:03:16] some stuff that job said
[2:03:21] and it sounds kind of
[2:03:23] foolish to me
[2:03:30] I believe it was
[2:03:32] a week or so ago you remember I talked
[2:03:34] about Abraham the Bible said he
[2:03:35] staggered not at the promise of God
[2:03:37] through unbelief
[2:03:39] but what I read it looks like that he
[2:03:41] did some staggering to me you know that
[2:03:44] I'm just talking natural here
[2:03:52] but in the newer Covenant
[2:03:57] we're told that Abraham staggered not
[2:04:00] at the promise of God
[2:04:03] we read about job he didn't charge God
[2:04:06] foolishly
[2:04:09] now God had to yank a not in job
[2:04:13] where were you job you think you know so
[2:04:16] much
[2:04:18] you think you're so brilliant
[2:04:22] where were you when I laid the
[2:04:24] foundations of the Earth
[2:04:28] where were you at
[2:04:31] now we've taken that scripture and we
[2:04:33] said I was with him
[2:04:35] and I believe I was but God was trying
[2:04:38] to make a point to job you think you're
[2:04:41] you think you've got so much Authority
[2:04:43] you think you know so much but where
[2:04:45] were you when I laid the foundation of
[2:04:46] the Earth
[2:04:48] when the sons of God shouted for Joy the
[2:04:50] Morning Star saying where were you at
[2:04:53] were you there helping me to make all
[2:04:56] that stuff
[2:04:59] God just wanted job to
[2:05:01] remember who he was
[2:05:05] but at the end God had some words about
[2:05:07] job
[2:05:08] God didn't uh job didn't charge God
[2:05:11] foolishly
[2:05:13] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[2:05:15] God through unbelief
[2:05:17] but was strong given praise to God
[2:05:25] sleeping with Hagar
[2:05:29] bringing forth an ishmai stagger not at
[2:05:32] the promise of God through unbelief was
[2:05:34] strong given praise to God
[2:05:37] just being real
[2:05:39] being real
[2:05:45] I can dwell on that stuff
[2:05:47] just as much as I can dwell on all of my
[2:05:50] heartache and pain and your heartache
[2:05:51] and pain
[2:05:52] all the dumb stuff I've done all the
[2:05:54] dumb stuff you've done we could dwell on
[2:05:57] it if we wish to
[2:05:59] but what good does it do
[2:06:02] because I would rather look to the end
[2:06:04] of the story
[2:06:05] I would rather I would rather by faith
[2:06:09] reach to the end of the story and know
[2:06:12] that my story has already been written
[2:06:14] and I have a prefix Destiny and that
[2:06:18] prefix Destiny says that he is an
[2:06:20] overcomer he is one who lived in
[2:06:23] laodicea where it was lukewarm and they
[2:06:26] were blind and didn't know it and they
[2:06:28] were naked and didn't know it and they
[2:06:30] spewed all kinds of violent evil things
[2:06:32] and they just didn't really know what
[2:06:34] they were doing all the curse words
[2:06:36] became natural adjectives for everybody
[2:06:39] and they just kept on talking like it
[2:06:41] was nothing to them
[2:06:48] actors
[2:06:50] acting
[2:06:52] actor spewing vile vile words as they're
[2:06:57] leaving this world because there's no
[2:07:00] God conscience but we as Believers have
[2:07:04] a god conscience and we have had our
[2:07:07] stumbles we have had our struggles we
[2:07:10] have had those times where that we did
[2:07:12] ignorant things along the way yet we
[2:07:15] still hold to the word of God because it
[2:07:18] is the promise that has been given to me
[2:07:20] I have a prefixed Destiny and I will
[2:07:25] walk it out and my prefix Destiny says
[2:07:29] that the lamb was slain from before the
[2:07:32] foundation of the world and there was a
[2:07:35] book that was written by that lamb and
[2:07:38] in that book is a name and my name is in
[2:07:42] that book
[2:07:44] my name
[2:07:52] so we gotta allow God to deal with the
[2:07:54] heart problem
[2:07:55] we gotta Lao
[2:08:00] I know we worship for quite a long time
[2:08:03] but I would like to finish
[2:08:05] this today
[2:08:09] we talked about
[2:08:11] on Tuesday night we talked about pride
[2:08:13] and how pride has
[2:08:16] just
[2:08:18] taken over our nation well it has taken
[2:08:21] over the world
[2:08:24] Pride
[2:08:26] and pride
[2:08:29] because it is a prevalent spirit
[2:08:33] everywhere you go
[2:08:35] and because this is laodicea the age of
[2:08:39] people's rights
[2:08:41] everybody wants their rights
[2:08:44] and so I'm a proud American and I want
[2:08:47] my American Rights
[2:08:52] and pride Creeps in in all of these
[2:08:55] little ways and we see that the Bible
[2:08:58] tells us that Sodom there's their main
[2:09:01] sin was the pride that they had among
[2:09:03] them and God dealt with it and we see
[2:09:06] the pride you know I don't think it's
[2:09:09] any mistake that they called a pride
[2:09:12] parade
[2:09:13] The Same Spirit is pressing back into
[2:09:17] the earth once again it never died it it
[2:09:21] just changed Dwelling Places and now we
[2:09:24] see this Pride pressing into the Earth
[2:09:27] in this uh homosexual spirit and uh you
[2:09:31] know we've got all these all these
[2:09:33] initials say it gets longer and longer
[2:09:35] and longer all the time another initial
[2:09:37] and another initial to describe all of
[2:09:41] those that are involved in this Pride
[2:09:43] Parade but we would have nothing to do
[2:09:47] with that
[2:09:49] yet we allow Pride to creep into our
[2:09:52] lives
[2:09:55] we talked about Pride on Tuesday night
[2:09:59] being self-idolatry
[2:10:04] idolizing ourself
[2:10:06] because we are concerned that if we
[2:10:10] don't idolize ourselves nobody else is
[2:10:12] going to we're not going to get the
[2:10:15] prominent place or position that we
[2:10:17] desire to have if we don't build ourself
[2:10:21] up with with some kind of uh doing in
[2:10:24] words and and dress and all these other
[2:10:28] kinds of things that we do to try to
[2:10:31] build ourselves up to promote ourselves
[2:10:34] that's what Pride does self-promotion
[2:10:38] and if if nobody will have us then we
[2:10:42] self-promote
[2:10:46] because we want to be somebody
[2:10:50] everybody wants to be you know
[2:10:56] we see
[2:10:57] Pride
[2:10:59] in those that promote themselves
[2:11:06] but I remember when I was in school
[2:11:09] I think I've told you this once before
[2:11:10] there was a group of gals that
[2:11:14] term some of the upper echelon as snobs
[2:11:22] yeah it was when I was in school sister
[2:11:24] Beth
[2:11:25] but there was another group
[2:11:29] who had the same issue of Pride and they
[2:11:31] called they turned that word around and
[2:11:33] they called themselves the bonds
[2:11:40] you know you had one side of the track
[2:11:42] or the other so to speak
[2:11:44] but there was as much pride in those
[2:11:47] girls they called themselves the bonds
[2:11:49] as there was in the ones that were snobs
[2:11:54] that's true
[2:11:57] they were proud that they were raggedy
[2:12:01] they were proud that they were poor
[2:12:04] they were proud that they were looked
[2:12:06] down upon
[2:12:08] and that drives that Spirit of that
[2:12:10] Gothic spirit
[2:12:13] there's a pride in that goth spirit that
[2:12:17] they want to dress in all black they
[2:12:20] want to put on black lipstick and black
[2:12:22] eyeliner black eye shadow and they just
[2:12:25] want to be dark dark dark because
[2:12:27] there's a pride in it
[2:12:30] and pride gets in every Avenue of life
[2:12:34] even the ones who looks like that they
[2:12:37] don't have any Pride they still deal
[2:12:40] with pride in some way and God has to
[2:12:43] deal with it
[2:12:45] they're proud because they're able to
[2:12:47] hide and stay back from everybody and
[2:12:50] they don't have any responsibility
[2:12:51] they're proud because that nobody calls
[2:12:55] on them to do anything they're proud
[2:12:57] because of this and proud because of
[2:13:00] that but God deals with pride because it
[2:13:03] is whether you're rich poor whether you
[2:13:06] got stuff or don't have stuff it is a
[2:13:09] spirit of self idolatry you are
[2:13:13] idolizing the place that you are God
[2:13:17] grant us the grace that we allow the
[2:13:20] burning fire of the Holy Ghost of
[2:13:23] burnout every bit of pride in our lives
[2:13:26] until that there is none of it left and
[2:13:29] we all walk humbly before the Lord be
[2:13:33] because I still believe what I preached
[2:13:36] some time ago from Philippians
[2:13:42] sorry I gotta find it because I want to
[2:13:44] quote it correctly
[2:13:50] let this mind
[2:13:52] be in you
[2:13:54] which was also in Christ Jesus
[2:13:59] what was the mind of Christ
[2:14:02] who thought who being in the form of man
[2:14:06] or form of God rather thought it not
[2:14:10] robbery to be equal with God
[2:14:15] let this mind be in you which was also
[2:14:18] in Christ Jesus
[2:14:21] who being in the form of God thought it
[2:14:24] not robbery to be equal with God
[2:14:30] now if you stop right there
[2:14:37] God told me to have the same mind as he
[2:14:40] did
[2:14:40] he was in the form of God but he was
[2:14:43] said
[2:14:44] that wasn't robbery to be equal with God
[2:14:51] it wasn't
[2:14:54] but he
[2:14:56] came in the form of man
[2:14:59] he humbled himself as a man
[2:15:03] that is the word I want to dwell on he
[2:15:05] humbled himself
[2:15:08] you and I must find ourselves humbled
[2:15:12] before the very Living God who thought
[2:15:15] it not robbery to be equal with God but
[2:15:18] he made himself of no reputation he took
[2:15:22] on the form of a man he came and he
[2:15:24] endured all of the hardships of a man he
[2:15:27] was tempted in every way as a man yet
[2:15:30] without sin
[2:15:33] he gave the offer to you
[2:15:38] I'm giving you an offer now this goes
[2:15:40] back to that prefix Destiny and he knows
[2:15:42] all of the foolish stuff I did in
[2:15:44] between my start and my end yet he could
[2:15:46] put me a prefix Destiny he knew the end
[2:15:50] of all of it and he knew that I was
[2:15:52] going to eventually humble myself before
[2:15:55] the cross I was going to humble myself
[2:15:57] before the finished work of the cross I
[2:16:00] was going to allow the blood of Jesus
[2:16:02] Christ to cleanse me of all of my sins I
[2:16:05] he knew I was going to repent and repent
[2:16:07] and repent and repent and repent and
[2:16:09] repent and repent and repent and replant
[2:16:12] and repent
[2:16:16] and repent some more and some more and
[2:16:19] some more
[2:16:20] because he was going to continue to
[2:16:24] reveal my heart to me
[2:16:26] he was going to continue to reveal my
[2:16:29] motives to me and he was going to let a
[2:16:31] sure word come
[2:16:35] and that word would come as a sword to
[2:16:38] divide between my thought and my motive
[2:16:42] such a fine line that was going to
[2:16:45] divide between my thought and my motive
[2:16:48] because he was going to get me all the
[2:16:50] way to the end of my story that said he
[2:16:54] has come to completion
[2:16:58] so he takes me through all of this stuff
[2:17:01] fiery trials hurts betrayals
[2:17:05] disturbances distractions upsets anger
[2:17:11] rage bitterness unforgiveness lets me go
[2:17:15] through all of it so I can taste every
[2:17:16] bit of it and know how to react to it
[2:17:19] and after a while as he's letting me go
[2:17:21] through all of this he comes with a
[2:17:24] mighty word or of the Lord to me and he
[2:17:28] lets me see all of that nastiness that I
[2:17:32] have inside
[2:17:34] foreign
[2:17:41] and because that he is a god-rich in
[2:17:45] Mercy
[2:17:46] he extends to me
[2:17:49] the choice
[2:17:54] how many of you ever been in how many of
[2:17:56] you in this room
[2:17:58] have ever been
[2:17:59] in a horrible battle
[2:18:02] and God came and gave you a choice to
[2:18:04] walk out of it
[2:18:06] and you chose to stay in it
[2:18:15] now you may be sitting here
[2:18:17] saying what kind of a crazy fool would
[2:18:19] do that
[2:18:22] but I would dare say that every person
[2:18:25] in this room
[2:18:27] though you did not raise your hand
[2:18:29] you have sit in a service Once Upon a
[2:18:33] Time
[2:18:34] and God came with an atmosphere for you
[2:18:38] to lay down
[2:18:39] your heavy burden
[2:18:42] to lay down your Agony to lay down your
[2:18:45] bitterness your unforgiveness
[2:18:47] friends it's happened in every service
[2:18:49] now
[2:18:50] God has given us this opportunity as we
[2:18:53] press into praise it is happening every
[2:18:56] service that the atmosphere is prepared
[2:18:59] the atmosphere is made for us to lay
[2:19:02] down our heavy burdens
[2:19:07] and then the word comes along to give us
[2:19:09] instruction to be able to rebuild
[2:19:13] if we let go
[2:19:16] if we release something to him then the
[2:19:19] word comes because we can't let that
[2:19:21] place remain as a void
[2:19:23] when we say Lord you can have my
[2:19:26] unforgiveness now standing here today
[2:19:28] there may be unforgiveness in you that
[2:19:30] you say Lord I'll let you have it and
[2:19:32] you don't give it a hundred percent
[2:19:36] you may encounter it again tomorrow and
[2:19:39] you may have to again say I forgive
[2:19:47] now tomorrow
[2:19:49] you may not have the same atmosphere
[2:19:53] the same balm of Gilead
[2:19:56] the same soothing atmosphere that we've
[2:20:01] created today
[2:20:03] say I forgive
[2:20:06] and in the soothing atmosphere of the
[2:20:09] holy spirit that we had here today
[2:20:11] where you could say I forgive
[2:20:14] or Lord I let go of my anger
[2:20:17] against this person I let go of my
[2:20:21] bitterness that I've carried for the
[2:20:23] last 20 years
[2:20:26] the atmosphere was built for that
[2:20:30] we don't linger
[2:20:33] just because we want to linger
[2:20:37] we linger because we try to hear the
[2:20:42] voice of the spirit say and linger just
[2:20:44] another moment or two
[2:20:46] I'm doing something
[2:20:48] and that atmosphere that balm is just
[2:20:51] right for you to be able to say it but
[2:20:53] now tomorrow when you go out and you
[2:20:56] don't have all of this congregation
[2:20:57] helping to create the atmosphere you're
[2:21:00] going to come up against it most likely
[2:21:02] again tomorrow where that thing is going
[2:21:04] to come and it's going to try to get you
[2:21:07] to react in a negative way and now you
[2:21:11] have to with a spirit of of of of God in
[2:21:16] you you have to say I forgive
[2:21:19] I will not hold the bitterness I will
[2:21:22] not let anger take a hold of me
[2:21:28] I'm telling you that
[2:21:31] because if you can get a head start in
[2:21:36] the service where there is a right
[2:21:38] atmosphere where there is an atmosphere
[2:21:41] of love and kindness and forgiveness and
[2:21:45] beauty and balm and soothing if you can
[2:21:49] let go of a degree of that in that kind
[2:21:52] of an atmosphere it will give you a head
[2:21:54] start for what you may face tomorrow
[2:22:00] if you refuse in this atmosphere there's
[2:22:04] probably a good chance you're going to
[2:22:05] refuse when you face it by yourself
[2:22:10] but I'm telling you if you will take
[2:22:13] advantage of the atmosphere of the
[2:22:16] corporate body when an atmosphere is
[2:22:19] created for you to just say Lord I don't
[2:22:23] feel anything that those people are
[2:22:24] feeling
[2:22:26] yet I feel that the necessity I I know
[2:22:30] there are things that are in me and I
[2:22:33] just want rid of them
[2:22:38] you take the opportunity
[2:22:41] well what if I don't feel anything
[2:22:42] preacher
[2:22:44] what do feelings have to do with it
[2:22:53] I would dare say that most of the men in
[2:22:55] this room have to go to work tomorrow
[2:22:57] women included
[2:22:58] when you are supposed to go to work
[2:23:00] tomorrow there'll probably be at least
[2:23:01] half of us that say I don't feel like it
[2:23:12] yet we have a responsibility
[2:23:15] because the Bible tells us that a man
[2:23:18] that does not provide for his own house
[2:23:19] is worse than an infidel
[2:23:22] so it's a necessity that we get up and
[2:23:25] go to work provide for our homes
[2:23:29] it's a necessity
[2:23:32] and it is a necessity for you as an
[2:23:35] overcoming believer
[2:23:40] to get
[2:23:42] your stuff
[2:23:44] dealt with
[2:23:47] wow the presence of God is moving Among
[2:23:50] Us
[2:23:53] because he knows the end friends
[2:23:56] now you can sit here and you can ball
[2:23:59] yourself up and you can fall up your
[2:24:02] fist and you can grit your teeth and you
[2:24:04] can say I ain't gonna do it
[2:24:08] but he knows your name
[2:24:12] he knows your name and he knows the end
[2:24:14] of your story
[2:24:16] he knows all that he's called you to go
[2:24:19] through
[2:24:20] but he knows the end
[2:24:22] of your destiny
[2:24:26] and he has your name written down and so
[2:24:29] it's a whole lot easier
[2:24:34] it's a whole lot easier
[2:24:37] to say papa
[2:24:39] I don't want to be defiant
[2:24:42] I just want to say yes Lord
[2:24:50] oh
[2:24:52] Pride
[2:24:55] Pride causes us to hold on to things
[2:25:01] causes us to hold on to things that
[2:25:05] we think that we have a right to
[2:25:08] but I would encourage you as believers
[2:25:12] don't let the spirit of laodicea take
[2:25:14] hold of you
[2:25:18] then they that feared the Lord
[2:25:21] speak often one to another this is verse
[2:25:23] 16.
[2:25:25] got to try to finish
[2:25:27] they that feared the Lord spake often to
[2:25:30] one another this word feared is
[2:25:33] reverential awe
[2:25:36] or to be awestruck
[2:25:44] I think some of our problems
[2:25:47] has been that we have lost
[2:25:50] the reverential fear of the Lord
[2:25:56] church has become common
[2:26:00] the preachers we have have become common
[2:26:02] the worship leaders and musicians have
[2:26:06] become common
[2:26:08] the way that we conduct the service has
[2:26:11] become common
[2:26:19] the atmosphere
[2:26:21] becomes common
[2:26:26] you say really preacher
[2:26:29] you just watch how much running in and
[2:26:32] out there is
[2:26:35] you watch how much running in and out
[2:26:37] there is
[2:26:38] when the presence of the Lord is here
[2:26:42] there are some that are sitting in this
[2:26:43] room
[2:26:46] that we're a part of this church in
[2:26:48] those early days when we first got here
[2:26:51] when the reverential all of the Lord
[2:26:53] would come down in the building
[2:26:55] and you would lose your spit
[2:27:01] you didn't move
[2:27:05] in the early days
[2:27:08] some here will remember
[2:27:11] that we weren't standing in a foyer
[2:27:13] talking before a service
[2:27:16] we were in the altar there was noise
[2:27:19] around the altar in preparation for a
[2:27:21] service
[2:27:26] now I believe that we should have some
[2:27:28] preparation before we ever got here
[2:27:31] but there's nothing wrong with making
[2:27:34] some noise in the altar before the
[2:27:37] service rather than talking about
[2:27:39] everything under the sun that has
[2:27:42] happened in our week letting our hearts
[2:27:45] and Minds be prepared
[2:27:49] and already setting stage for a higher
[2:27:53] frequency than maybe we could gain if we
[2:27:56] just talked about the weather and talked
[2:27:59] about baseball and football and what the
[2:28:01] children did and where we went and
[2:28:04] how much we weigh and what we ate for
[2:28:07] dinner last night and all of these kind
[2:28:10] of things
[2:28:13] people we talk about everything
[2:28:19] they that were all struck
[2:28:23] by the Lord
[2:28:26] speak often
[2:28:29] to one another
[2:28:33] what are you talking about
[2:28:37] it's a question to us
[2:28:40] what are you talking about
[2:28:45] because things have become so common to
[2:28:48] us
[2:28:51] it doesn't thrill us anymore
[2:28:57] the things of God that thrilled us when
[2:29:01] we were new believers
[2:29:04] or when we first came here
[2:29:09] they don't thrill us anymore
[2:29:11] and we're not as all struck
[2:29:14] of the Lord
[2:29:16] as we used to be
[2:29:18] because we see this one's flaw and we
[2:29:21] see that one's flaw and we see our own
[2:29:22] flaws and we see the others flaw and we
[2:29:25] see our own flaws and all of this stuff
[2:29:28] just gets going and going and it's what
[2:29:31] we talk about
[2:29:33] it's what we talk about and these are
[2:29:36] the things that have become Stout to the
[2:29:38] Lord these are the things that have
[2:29:40] caused us to become hard-hearted before
[2:29:42] the Lord because we're talking about all
[2:29:45] of that stuff that has no Eternal value
[2:29:51] but they that feared the Lord
[2:29:54] speak often
[2:29:57] to one another
[2:29:58] and the Lord hearkened
[2:30:01] and heard it
[2:30:04] and a book of remembrance was written
[2:30:08] now a thought came to me earlier this
[2:30:10] week
[2:30:11] if there is a book of remembrance that
[2:30:14] was written
[2:30:17] because the Lord hearkened and heard
[2:30:21] how many blank pages do I have
[2:30:30] because I don't think he's writing down
[2:30:31] all the nonsense
[2:30:34] all of the foolishness
[2:30:36] he's not writing down the football
[2:30:38] scores
[2:30:40] he's not writing down what I had for
[2:30:42] lunch yesterday
[2:30:43] he's not writing down the temperature
[2:30:45] and whether it's sunny or cloudy he's
[2:30:48] not writing any of that down
[2:30:51] those that were all struck by the
[2:30:54] presence of the Lord
[2:30:56] those that were sharing the goodness of
[2:30:59] the Lord
[2:31:01] let me just stop here just a moment to
[2:31:04] share the goodness of the Lord and I
[2:31:06] want him to share it when he comes the
[2:31:09] next time but our brother that has been
[2:31:11] driving so far
[2:31:15] he gave a testimony last week that two
[2:31:19] months ago in in February the meeting
[2:31:21] that we had the Saturday and the Sunday
[2:31:24] his daughter was in the hospital dying
[2:31:27] the systems of her body were shutting
[2:31:30] down and I want him to tell you all of
[2:31:32] the details because it's profound what
[2:31:35] the Lord did
[2:31:37] and he said there's nothing that I can
[2:31:40] do the doctors are working on her but he
[2:31:43] said he told his daughter he says I'm
[2:31:45] going to Alabama to worship
[2:31:49] to find favor with the Lord for your
[2:31:52] healing
[2:31:56] before he got home his daughter was home
[2:32:02] with no tubes
[2:32:06] that is the goodness of the Lord
[2:32:13] God hearkened
[2:32:15] he heard brother Byler brother Emmanuel
[2:32:19] Byler when he told his daughter I'm
[2:32:21] going to Alabama to worship
[2:32:24] I can't fix you but I can go Worship the
[2:32:29] Lord and I can get the ear of the Lord I
[2:32:34] can get the ear of the Lord and a book
[2:32:37] of remembrance was written because
[2:32:39] brother saw that God did something
[2:32:42] fantastic something marvelous
[2:32:46] because
[2:32:47] that our brother feared the Lord there
[2:32:50] was a reverential awe brother became
[2:32:54] awestruck by the power and the anointing
[2:32:57] of the Holy Ghost that gets created in
[2:33:00] this place and he knew that he could do
[2:33:03] more good by getting in the presence of
[2:33:06] the Lord
[2:33:11] and then he shared that
[2:33:13] over a meal
[2:33:15] there's something that's been going on
[2:33:17] in me ever since
[2:33:19] this is the kind of things that the
[2:33:22] people that are all struck by what God
[2:33:25] is doing that's what they're talking
[2:33:27] about that's what's going into the book
[2:33:29] of remembrance that is the things that
[2:33:32] are being recorded on my behalf this
[2:33:35] book of remembrance that is being
[2:33:37] written and those that thought on his
[2:33:39] name shall see hear not only what we're
[2:33:43] speaking but what we're thinking
[2:33:46] and we said on Tuesday night we referred
[2:33:49] to the scripture out of the abundance of
[2:33:51] the heart the mouth speaks
[2:33:57] Philippians 4 verse 8 finally brethren
[2:34:02] whatsoever things
[2:34:05] are true
[2:34:09] whatsoever things are honest
[2:34:18] we are not
[2:34:20] going to continue to get away
[2:34:24] with being dishonest
[2:34:31] how many times have I heard my wife talk
[2:34:35] about her mother
[2:34:36] saying to them when they would tell a
[2:34:39] lie all liars shall have their place in
[2:34:41] the Lake of Fire
[2:34:46] now I realize that God is a god of Grace
[2:34:51] and there is a time that he Winks at how
[2:34:54] ignorant we are
[2:34:57] there are times where that he would
[2:34:59] allow us to get by with this honesty but
[2:35:03] friends I would remind you of of of the
[2:35:08] New Testament when uh ananias and
[2:35:12] Sapphira came in before Peter and Peter
[2:35:16] says why has the devil
[2:35:21] allowed this to come into your heart
[2:35:23] that you would lie to the Holy Ghost
[2:35:29] I personally
[2:35:32] do not want to be the one that has to
[2:35:34] pronounce that judgment
[2:35:43] but I remember
[2:35:46] profit from our generation
[2:35:50] using two instances
[2:35:53] that he tied to ananias and sephira
[2:35:58] and one of them was
[2:36:00] that a man came into the prayer line
[2:36:02] because he wanted to
[2:36:04] prove that brother Branham was using
[2:36:07] mental telepathy
[2:36:10] and he wrote all kinds of things on the
[2:36:13] back of his prayer card that were wrong
[2:36:16] with him
[2:36:17] and right before the people he tried to
[2:36:20] dispute with brother Branham
[2:36:22] and brother Branham said there's nothing
[2:36:24] wrong with you
[2:36:26] the man starts saying you're a fake
[2:36:28] you're phony you ought to read my prayer
[2:36:30] card and brother Brandon says it doesn't
[2:36:32] matter what's on your prayer card
[2:36:34] there's nothing wrong with you
[2:36:36] all of the sudden the spirit of the Lord
[2:36:39] drops and said
[2:36:43] you've lied to the Holy Ghost
[2:36:46] you didn't just lie to a man
[2:36:49] you lied to the Holy Ghost
[2:36:53] you're trying to prove that I'm a fake
[2:36:55] that I'm a fraud
[2:37:00] but now all of those things that you
[2:37:02] have written on the back of your prayer
[2:37:04] card
[2:37:05] you will now have them
[2:37:13] now I'm just going to tell you friends
[2:37:16] in my mind
[2:37:19] it would be a lot less painful
[2:37:21] just to fall dead
[2:37:23] and be carried out
[2:37:26] but now this man
[2:37:28] had to live the rest of his days with
[2:37:30] all of the things that he wrote
[2:37:33] tuberculosis being one of them
[2:37:36] all the rest of his days he had to deal
[2:37:39] with all of these problems in his body
[2:37:42] because he lied to the Holy Ghost
[2:37:46] the days of our playing around are
[2:37:49] quickly coming to an end
[2:37:51] it is high time that we awoke out of
[2:37:54] sleep
[2:37:55] our place of stupor
[2:37:59] and allow the Holy Ghost to extract from
[2:38:03] us that lying spirit that we carry
[2:38:08] the dishonesty that we have
[2:38:11] dishonesty that we have in paperwork
[2:38:15] even that we fill out
[2:38:17] how many hours that we've worked on a
[2:38:20] job
[2:38:21] dishonesty with what we have taken out
[2:38:23] of inventory dishonesty
[2:38:26] with what we said to someone along the
[2:38:28] way
[2:38:31] finally brethren
[2:38:34] whatsoever things are true
[2:38:36] whatsoever things are honest
[2:38:39] whatsoever things are just
[2:38:43] whatsoever things are pure
[2:38:47] whatsoever things are lovely
[2:38:50] whatsoever things are of
[2:38:53] good report
[2:38:57] whose report will you believe
[2:39:00] I will believe the report of the Lord
[2:39:05] when I'm in an atmosphere
[2:39:08] I'm human
[2:39:10] when I'm in an atmosphere
[2:39:13] and there's
[2:39:15] something wrong
[2:39:18] there's something about good atmosphere
[2:39:20] that you just want to decree a good
[2:39:23] report
[2:39:25] when you get out from under that
[2:39:27] atmosphere you have this temptation to
[2:39:30] go back
[2:39:31] to spouting the bad report
[2:39:35] when we're in an atmosphere of faith we
[2:39:37] can decree faith and we can decree
[2:39:40] healing we can decree all the good
[2:39:42] things of God when we get out from under
[2:39:44] it we revert back to our
[2:39:47] bad report
[2:39:49] our struggles
[2:39:52] but the Bible is telling us
[2:39:55] whatsoever things are true honest just
[2:40:01] pure lovely of good report if there be
[2:40:05] any virtue if there be any praise think
[2:40:08] on these things
[2:40:12] oh
[2:40:15] now this sounds like a new thought
[2:40:17] pattern
[2:40:21] and it ain't coming automatically
[2:40:25] because we're a bunch of humans
[2:40:29] with a human nature
[2:40:33] yet God allows us to come together
[2:40:35] service after service and experience his
[2:40:38] presence and he continues to give his
[2:40:40] word to us so tell us we got to get rid
[2:40:42] of the stinking thinking we got to get
[2:40:44] rid of these things that have cost us so
[2:40:46] much struggle we've got to think on
[2:40:47] things of good report we've got to think
[2:40:49] on things that are honest we've got to
[2:40:51] think on things that are true we've got
[2:40:54] to allow our minds to think in a pattern
[2:40:58] of Truth
[2:41:00] and if we elect if we Let Jesus Christ
[2:41:03] The Living Word the person of Jesus
[2:41:07] Christ the person of truth if we allow
[2:41:11] him to embody us
[2:41:13] our thought patterns will become
[2:41:14] different
[2:41:18] so after
[2:41:20] we're thinking on these things
[2:41:24] he tells us
[2:41:25] that those that think on these things he
[2:41:28] says these are mines saith the Lord
[2:41:32] these are mine
[2:41:34] and in that day when I make up my Jewels
[2:41:37] I will spare them as a man's Spirit his
[2:41:40] own son that serveth him then verse 18.
[2:41:43] see all of these things are moving us
[2:41:47] toward Verse 18 then you shall return
[2:41:52] and discern between the righteous and
[2:41:55] the wicked
[2:41:56] between him that serveth God and him
[2:42:00] that serveth him not
[2:42:03] when we think
[2:42:06] on things that are lovely things that
[2:42:09] are of good report things that are
[2:42:11] honest things that are true when we
[2:42:14] think on these kinds of things and then
[2:42:16] we get together with one another or what
[2:42:19] we're thinking on the word we're
[2:42:21] thinking on Truth we're thinking on
[2:42:23] Jesus Christ and we get together with
[2:42:25] our friends with our loved ones with our
[2:42:27] family we're sitting in our homes and
[2:42:30] we're discussing the goodness of God in
[2:42:32] our lives as we're thinking on these
[2:42:35] things rather than filling our minds
[2:42:37] with everything else this book of
[2:42:39] remembrances being written about us as
[2:42:41] the Lord is hearing all of this stuff
[2:42:43] and there is a shift in us a shift a
[2:42:46] shift a shift a shift a shift that is
[2:42:49] happening in us and then as we are
[2:42:52] returning see this was an ongoing
[2:42:54] prophecy as I've told you this was for
[2:42:57] the children of Israel those that had
[2:42:59] wandered away from the things of God
[2:43:00] this is for us as well because as we
[2:43:04] allow the Holy Spirit to give us the
[2:43:07] grace to think on things that are lovely
[2:43:09] and true and of good report we're
[2:43:11] thinking on things that are righteous
[2:43:13] we're thinking on things that are good
[2:43:15] then our discernment is going to change
[2:43:20] we are no longer going to be one of
[2:43:24] those that says
[2:43:25] about the Heathen that never goes to
[2:43:28] church
[2:43:29] but he loves the Lord
[2:43:37] if we really love the Lord
[2:43:41] we are going to love on the Lord
[2:43:48] now I'm not putting anybody in hell
[2:43:52] I don't have that good a judgment
[2:43:55] there will come a day I will sit with
[2:43:58] him in his throne
[2:44:00] I'm planning to sit with him in his
[2:44:03] throne because I am an overcomer
[2:44:08] even as he overcame and sat down with
[2:44:11] his father in his throne I am going to
[2:44:14] overcome and I'm going to sit with him
[2:44:15] in his throne
[2:44:18] and I recognize in Revelation 19 that
[2:44:20] there's going to be some people that are
[2:44:22] Before the Throne giving honor to the
[2:44:25] Lamb's wife in the throne
[2:44:28] and it's two groups of people
[2:44:31] there are going to be people that make
[2:44:33] it by the skin of their teeth
[2:44:37] or the plaque thereof I don't know how
[2:44:39] you want to say it
[2:44:44] there will be people
[2:44:46] who will overcome the spirit of this age
[2:44:50] they will lay aside their rights they
[2:44:53] will lay aside all of the foolishness
[2:44:55] they will lay aside all of that because
[2:44:58] they want to be just like Jesus they
[2:45:01] will recognize that they are carrying
[2:45:03] pride and they will take it before the
[2:45:05] Lord and say Lord I don't want this I
[2:45:07] give it to you I I I I I want it to go
[2:45:11] back where it came from I realize that I
[2:45:13] can't be like Jesus if I'm all the time
[2:45:16] trying to promote myself and make myself
[2:45:19] something that I'm not uh or just even
[2:45:22] even a a false pride of some sort that
[2:45:26] tries to you know that that you know
[2:45:29] pride comes in so many different forms
[2:45:33] even even our uh our pity parties
[2:45:41] our pity parties are born out of Pride
[2:45:44] because we want somebody to see that
[2:45:46] we're miserable
[2:45:49] and we've got to surrender it to the
[2:45:51] Lord
[2:45:53] our pity parties that come around
[2:45:55] because we've been injured we've been
[2:45:56] wounded we've been hurt we've been this
[2:45:58] we've been that friends we all have been
[2:46:04] and if we can just
[2:46:06] God
[2:46:09] I am yours and that is sufficient
[2:46:16] and I want to think on the things of the
[2:46:20] word of God because I am your Jewel
[2:46:26] the Kingdom of Heaven musicians are
[2:46:28] coming the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[2:46:30] unto a treasure hid in a field the witch
[2:46:33] when a man is found he hideth and for
[2:46:36] Joy thereof goeth and selleth all that
[2:46:39] he had and buyeth that field again the
[2:46:43] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a
[2:46:44] merchant man seeking goodly pearls who
[2:46:48] when he has found one pearl of great
[2:46:50] price when and sold all that he had
[2:46:53] and bought it
[2:46:56] at you
[2:46:59] you are so valuable to the Lord
[2:47:03] that he could not stand to leave you
[2:47:05] where you were
[2:47:07] so he gave everything
[2:47:10] he stepped out of Eternity into the
[2:47:13] realm of time
[2:47:14] and when he stepped into the realm of
[2:47:16] time and he took down the form of a
[2:47:18] human being and he took on all of the
[2:47:21] nature of a human being yet without sin
[2:47:24] he took on all of the sin he carried it
[2:47:28] he bore it to Calvary he hung on the
[2:47:31] cross with all of my sin with all of my
[2:47:34] shame with all of my condemnation and so
[2:47:37] I don't have to sit around and discuss
[2:47:39] all of my sin and my shame and my
[2:47:42] condemnation and my guilt I don't have
[2:47:44] to sit in my easy chair at the house and
[2:47:47] allow that gerbil will to go around and
[2:47:49] around and around and around and around
[2:47:50] around
[2:47:53] until that the pressure cooker is about
[2:47:54] to explode
[2:47:56] I can adjust as I do when I come in here
[2:48:00] with you corporately
[2:48:02] I may not be able to create the same
[2:48:04] atmosphere that I do when I have all of
[2:48:06] you but I have the ability
[2:48:09] I know that I have the ability by the
[2:48:13] grace of God and you do too
[2:48:18] you don't have the ability
[2:48:22] to create
[2:48:23] my atmosphere
[2:48:27] but if I'll create an atmosphere and
[2:48:29] you'll create an atmosphere and we can
[2:48:31] join it together that creates the
[2:48:33] corporate atmosphere yet when I am alone
[2:48:36] I have the ability because I have the
[2:48:38] Holy Ghost
[2:48:40] I have the ability
[2:48:42] to create atmosphere
[2:48:46] in my vehicle
[2:48:47] in my easy chair in my office
[2:48:54] and I'm realizing by this scripture
[2:48:58] that I cannot do it
[2:49:01] just by thinking about it
[2:49:03] I have to speak
[2:49:07] and it is a gift that I can talk to my
[2:49:11] brothers and sisters about the goodness
[2:49:13] of God and the more that we discuss the
[2:49:17] goodness of God
[2:49:18] the more that we discuss the presence of
[2:49:22] the Lord the more that we discuss the
[2:49:25] word of God the message of the hour all
[2:49:29] of the good things that God is doing and
[2:49:31] our eyes are being adjusted we're
[2:49:34] getting the proper eyeglasses in place
[2:49:36] to be able to see
[2:49:39] wow
[2:49:42] my eyes have been open that that
[2:49:45] situation right there I realized that I
[2:49:48] was calling that good when in fact it's
[2:49:51] evil
[2:49:54] and this situation over here because I'd
[2:49:57] been discussing so much about football
[2:49:59] and basketball and I'd been so carried
[2:50:02] away with providing for my family and I
[2:50:04] had been so carried away with my
[2:50:06] mistreatment by my boss that this over
[2:50:09] here I was calling bad when really it's
[2:50:11] good
[2:50:14] when we can talk often to one another
[2:50:19] recognize
[2:50:20] that I was foolish enough to agree with
[2:50:23] stuff by an intellectual mind the
[2:50:26] pruning the refiners fire that all of
[2:50:30] that is a part of this then I can know
[2:50:32] that there is a return of the true
[2:50:35] Discerning between righteous and wicked
[2:50:37] and between him that serves God in him
[2:50:40] that doesn't
[2:50:42] let's stand together today
[2:50:47] if there is anything
[2:50:51] if there's anything that we would want
[2:50:55] to ask the Lord for today as we're
[2:50:57] worshiping together
[2:51:00] may we ask him
[2:51:03] for Discerning of spirits
[2:51:10] God I don't want to discern things by my
[2:51:12] own flesh
[2:51:14] I don't want to discern things even by
[2:51:16] my soul my mind my will my emotions
[2:51:21] because emotions can get out of sorts
[2:51:27] if I allow the Holy Spirit you ready Ben
[2:51:31] if I can allow the Holy Spirit
[2:51:35] to come to me
[2:51:38] by the word
[2:51:40] buy things that are righteous and of
[2:51:43] good report I let him
[2:51:45] tweak my eyesight
[2:51:48] my righteous eyesight
[2:51:50] till that I am one who allows him
[2:51:53] to cause the Discerning of spirits to
[2:51:56] come
[2:51:57] in a profound measure in my life to
[2:52:01] where that I am giving righteous
[2:52:03] judgments
[2:52:04] and what is evil I am calling evil
[2:52:13] I don't have to stand
[2:52:15] behind a Pulpit
[2:52:17] and make a big to do about it
[2:52:20] but friends there's a whole lot of stuff
[2:52:21] that we agree with that we should not
[2:52:23] agree with
[2:52:25] there's a whole lot of stuff
[2:52:28] that is so edgy that we agree with
[2:52:32] because that our hearts and our minds
[2:52:36] have become distorted by laodicea
[2:52:40] oh God I am praying today that you will
[2:52:45] let there come such a flood of your Holy
[2:52:48] Spirit in our lives and in the
[2:52:50] atmosphere even now right here as we
[2:52:53] begin to worship you I am asking Lord
[2:52:56] that you will come and seal in this word
[2:52:59] and that we will recognize the foolish
[2:53:03] talk that we have had the foolish
[2:53:06] thoughts that we have entertained and
[2:53:09] all of the ideas that we have
[2:53:11] entertained God as it has caused us to
[2:53:14] have distorted Vision that we have
[2:53:17] called what is evil we've called it good
[2:53:19] and what is good we've called evil oh
[2:53:22] Lord let there be a return as you
[2:53:27] promised in Malachi let there be a
[2:53:29] return of the Discerning of spirits
[2:53:33] that we will once again recognize what
[2:53:35] is good
[2:53:36] and what is evil
[2:53:39] in the name of Jesus Christ
