All the streets of glory. Let me lift my voice. Here's all pass ever to rejoice in service for my Lord. dark in the night, but I'll cling more close to him. He will give me light.

Lord, I thank you that you have placed in our hearts the ability to love to love you and to love our fellow man, our fellow believers here in the house. I thank you that you have put something in us, Lord, that we could love one another. Even through all of our mistakes and all of our pitfalls, Lord, you placed something in us that we could love one another. Simply, it's because you have first loved us. Thank you for it, Lord. We give you praise and honor today. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; because of who you are. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 10,000 praises &gt;&gt; times 10,000 praises belong to him. &gt;&gt; He's the worthy one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a need today by the lifting of the hand as we're getting ready to pray? hands all over the house, out over the camera to the through the live stream. The needs that you have, our Lord knows all about them. I received a text from Sister Annie Barliffe. She's not well. She's asking for prayer. Also, Sister Cindy Chadwick is not well today. She is asking for prayer. She also asked that we would remember her neighbor Haley about to give birth to a child. She asked that we would pray for her for a safe delivery. Remember Stephen as he recovers? He had a bit of an episode last night. And let's ask the Lord to give him quick healing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's getting mighty close to wedding time to not be feeling well. &gt;&gt; Let's ask the Lord to uh speed that up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And there are several others who are not well this morning. We want to lift them up. Tiffany has some sickness at her house and there were a few others that reached out. some who were at the meeting and went home sick. And we sure do hate that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It really bothers me to think somebody came all this way to get sick. But I hope and pray that it was for them like it has been for us. It was worth it was worth uh a week of no voice and it was to experience what we have experienced. But that won't carry us today, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That was yesterday. &gt;&gt; Uh would you please pray for the family of brother Bobby Wartz? It's still not uh registering yet with me that he's gone two months after his diagnosis so quickly. He left us one by one. I was texting sister uh brother and sister Green's daughter Karen and said one by one they're leaving us &gt;&gt; and it gives us something to look forward to. &gt;&gt; I I believe there is a reunion. &gt;&gt; Yes, there is &gt;&gt; just over just over the next hill. in the morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I just kept saying in the morning, Brother Bobby, we'll see you in the morning. &gt;&gt; Would you pray for the family? They're doing well. God is giving them great strength. The community is surrounding them in a very precious way. There are people traveling from all over the country. Would you ask God to give them safety as they go? We have a van load le leaving here Tuesday night after service to to be there in time for the funeral. And uh my family is some of my family's on that van and then there's four of us flying out Wednesday morning to be there. We just want I want the Lord to go with us. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a great honor to be asked to have a something to say in a song. But I want it there'll be business people there. There'll be community neighbors there. It won't just be believers. And I would so love that his going would be able to send a message through us. &gt;&gt; This is real. This is this isn't a hobby. &gt;&gt; This serving God is not a hobby. &gt;&gt; It's not. &gt;&gt; It's a lifestyle of preparation. Anyway, I don't want to preach now, but &gt;&gt; much to pray about. And then then we travel again next week. &gt;&gt; This one we're driving. And so we want the Lord and all those who will be going to the wedding &gt;&gt; and the services that will be held while we're there that God will move. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Will you sing this chorus with us as we're getting ready to pray? You are awome in this place. You are awesome in this place. Father, you are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awome in this place. Mighty God. Sing again. Oh you are awome in this place. Mighty God, [Music] you are awome in this place of a father. You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awome in this place. My sing once again. Brother Daniel, will you come and pray over the needs today? Oh, you are awome in this place. Mighty God, you are awome in this place of a father. You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. Mighty God. Shall we approach him together? Oh precious Lord. Aba Father, the disciples, when you asked him, will you go also? After some had turned away, they said, to whom shall we go? We have nowhere else to go but to you today. And we're so thankful that you're a great awesome papa, that you care about our down sittings and our uprisings. You're mindful of everything that's going on, Lord, not just in our local body, but your body throughout the world. Lord, there's nothing that you miss. There's nothing that you don't know. So as we come before you this morning, Lord, we're just asking you to have your way in earth as it is in heaven. Lord, we surrender our will, our thoughts, our desires, and we're asking you to move, Lord. We ask you to do what you've done by your stripes, Lord, for Sister Annie this morning, Lord. And the other request for the sister who has a neighbor getting ready to give birth, Lord, touch her and move on that request, Lord Jesus. for every unspoken need upon the people's heart. Lord, we know that you can hear our hearts. There's nothing hidden from you. And Lord, if we would try today, if we would try to cover something or hide something, Lord, we would just ask that you would shine a light because we don't want anything, Lord, to follow us. We want everything to go before us. We want to be illuminated by your light, Lord. We want nothing that we would have to be embarrassed about or ashamed of. We know you're more than able. We know that your blood settled the debt. It settled the debt. We have been redeemed by your death on the cross &gt;&gt; and we've been healed by your stripes, Lord. And we believe we believe Isaiah saw it before it happened and we believe it came to pass. So we lay fast hold of the promise today. &gt;&gt; We're asking for traveling mercies for everyone this week, Lord. We're asking for a full recovery for brother Steven. We're asking Lord for the upcoming trips. Lord, just seems like so many things overlap and there's so much to do. But God, if you go and if you send the angels and if you stand, if you Lord, if you just do what you are capable of doing, Lord, it will be done so so well. So we surrender our thoughts and our will to you today. And we ask you have your way, master, once again in earth as it is in heaven. and we'll be careful to praise you for your great works as we pray in the name above all names, Yeshua Hamashiach, our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, I give you praise for your worthy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today. Glory to &gt;&gt; camp meeting 2025 is now in the rear view mirror, but I am still living in his goodness. &gt;&gt; I am so grateful for his goodness in my life. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I've been sick. I'm still living in his goodness. &gt;&gt; I've had some loss. I'm still living in his goodness &gt;&gt; because that's who he is. &gt;&gt; He is good all of the time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We'd like to welcome Gary and Donna Steel from Woodland, Alabama. They've been streaming our services and we welcome you here in the house of the Lord today. God bless you, Jessica. It's nice to see you today. Worked all night and still got your eyes open. We're glad to see you today. God bless you. Hope, we ain't scared you off. Jacob, we ain't scared you off. We're glad that you're here. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Solomon and Zion, God bless you. It's good to have you here in the house of the Lord with us today. &gt;&gt; The Lord be with you. Doris did a boomerang, came back with Matt to celebrate Caleb's birthday, and to dedicate some babies. We're glad that they're with us today. God bless you, [Applause] &gt;&gt; Logan. You about hid, but I see you back there. I'm glad you're here today. God bless you. [Applause] Brother Cade's going to move over to the piano and we're going to worship together with him as we're getting ready to hear the preaching of the word today. We've come we have come into the house of the Lord with a heart ready to receive. We've been asking the Lord to speak to us directly. Uh not shoveling it over our shoulder to someone else, but receiving from the Lord for ourself because we as a people are making ourselves ready for the uh for whatever the Lord has in our book. Uh we are making ourselves ready to let our destinies be fulfilled. every piece of it, not leaving one thing behind. Redeeming the time because the days are evil, things that the enemy would have tried to steal from us. We are letting our eyes behold them. And we are once again taking a hold of them. And we're saying, "They're mine. God promised it to me. I'm not letting loose of it. I may have let it slip once, but I'm reaching back and I'm grabbing a hold of it. and I am redeeming the time because that the days are evil. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to receive the tithe and offering as brother Cade is is singing. We're going to worship together with our giving and with our voices unto the Lord. Brother Ellas, would you come today? Brother Jonathan, will you help him, please? We let these two brothers come to you to so you can give of your tithe and offering unto the Lord. We're not giving it to man. We're not giving it to a ministry. We're giving it to him. That way we never have to look back and regret one dime of it because we're giving it to him. God bless you as we worship together. [Music] All I want held dear. Build my life upon. All this world reverses in wars to own. All I once thought gain. I have counted loss, spent worthless now compared to this. Knowing you, Jesus, knowing you, there is no greater thing. You're my all. You're the best. You're my joy, my righteousness. And I love you, Lord. Now my heart's desire is to know you more to be found in you and know as yours to possess by faith what I could not earn or surpassing gift of rightuous iousness knowing you Jesus knowing you there is no greater thing. You're my all. You're the best. You're my joy, my righteousness. And I love you, Lord. Oh, to know the power of your ris.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Falling in love with Jesus. [Music] It was the best thing I've ever done. Falling in love. Falling in love with Jesus.

[Music] Oh, in his arms never disconnected. Oh, in his arms I feel protected. And there's no place I'd ra be &gt;&gt; in his arms. One more time. &gt;&gt; Oh, in his arms I feel protected. In his arms, in his arms, never disconnected. In his arms I feel protected cuz there's no place I'd ra be. &gt;&gt; There is no place I'd ra be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just lift our hands to him right now. Just lift up your hands and tell him, "Lord, in your arms, &gt;&gt; in your right hand, &gt;&gt; in your right hand, Lord, there's no place I'd rather be sheltered beneath the everlasting arms of a living God." Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Why don't you clap your hands for the King of Kings, [Applause] worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy. &gt;&gt; Isn't he worthy today? &gt;&gt; Whether we feel good, whether we don't, he's worthy. Just like Brother Gley was telling us. Let's thank God for these musicians. Praise the Lord. Sorry about that, R.J. When the singing was going on, I could only hear Cade and the piano. And now I can hear a lot more. But uh it it could be that he was drowning me out, you know, and trying to get me back for some of the things I pick on him about. Glad to be in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't think we we didn't mention I don't think uh but it's all right isn't it for us to say that uh I'm assuming that that this is your dad Jessica. Is that right? And I don't know if I've ever met you or not but we have have we ever been in the same place but I'm very thankful that you all are here today. &gt;&gt; Very very thankful. And uh it means something to us that you would come and that you would be streaming. I think it means more to us that you were streaming and still decided to come. You knew more about us than we knew about you. But we're glad you're here today. Let's open our Bibles to John chapter 14. And we will uh read the word of God today and uh hear. It's our desire to hear what the Lord would say to us. And uh he's always talking and we're we're we're only sometimes listening. Uh let me say that again. &gt;&gt; Uh he's always talking &gt;&gt; and and we're just listening some of the time. May God give us grace uh to listen more because he has a lots to say. &gt;&gt; John 14 verse 15. We just read this, but I want to reread it. And I'm sorry, but I do have a lozenge in my mouth. My voice is stronger today, but it's just not quite all the way. But God is helping us. If you love me, this is Jesus red letter. If you love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive. Now, this is the truth. Only the sons of God, only those who are carrying a representation of his gene seed can even hear him. &gt;&gt; So if you're one of those who can hear him, while we ought to be the happiest people on the planet, &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can hear him. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not. They're looking for someone they can see. Neither knoweth him. Brother Cade was singing about knowing him, but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you. The spirit of truth. The spirit of truth dwelleth with you in the body of Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And shall be what? &gt;&gt; In you. &gt;&gt; And shall be in you. And then verse 18, I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. &gt;&gt; It's it's a bit in code, isn't it? I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. The spirit of truth that is with you now is going to leave you in the form that you are accustomed to. But I'm not going to leave you here without a comforter &gt;&gt; because I'm going to come to you a &gt;&gt; and now not only to you but I'm going to come and express myself how in you &gt;&gt; that that's the paraphrase and it's right yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall &gt;&gt; oh brother that's a big promise at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you follow it all the way? &gt;&gt; That I am in my father &gt;&gt; and ye in me &gt;&gt; and I in you. At that day at that day, the day that I leave and that spirit of truth that is in me falls down to live in you. That day you'll know. In that moment you'll know. This is the revelation. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them. He it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him. &gt;&gt; Now we're going to let you be seated in a moment. But there there's a little something in those verses that greatly disturbs the nominal church because they build everything they do on the on this pretense that that God loves the father loves every person the same. &gt;&gt; This is what we hear. This is why a gospel of inclusion is becoming the most popular gospel. &gt;&gt; But this is not what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My father loves those that keep my commandments." &gt;&gt; So he loves the whole world. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. But it doesn't say anywhere in scripture that we are loved the same. And it doesn't have to say that. It's not important that we all have the same measure of love. But I will tell you, he loves those particularly who will keep his word. &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you what Jesus said. Now, sir, &gt;&gt; we just read it. I believe, &gt;&gt; he that keepeth, he that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. Lord, we thank you today for strength and health and the blessing of being in your house. &gt;&gt; And we want to glorify you in all of your ways. For they are perfect &gt;&gt; and your word is perfect in us. Perfect. And we want to thank you for the full manifestation of that word. We ask right now that you would not only anoint the delivery, but that you would anoint the reception. May our ears be anointed to hear your word and may it click. &gt;&gt; We hear this expression uh it somehow it just clicked with me. Lord, let it be so today that your word finds a place of clicking in and locking in so that we will never uh be able to deny it again but build our strength upon it. And we ask for this in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Please enjoy your seats. We have already been talking about the fact that the anointing is a person. It's not a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's a person. It is the manifest presence of God. It's the presence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So the the anointing is not how you feel. It's not the hair standing up on your arms or some tingle up your spine or or something that makes you want to dance. That's not that's not how we need to see the anointing as a feeling or as an emotion, something that you can step into and out of and feel one service and not feel the next service. We have sort of created that with a Pentecostal theology. Oh, I feel him. I really feel him. I I love to feel Listen, I'm not against feeling. &gt;&gt; Wow. We need some feeling. &gt;&gt; And we need to feel him. But But the reality is whether we feel him or not, he's here. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm inside of you now. I'm going to come and live in you. And whether you witness or feel or uh have some sensation uh or not, I'm still there. I haven't left you. I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. I'll be with you even until the end. Isn't that what he said? &gt;&gt; So, we need to begin to think more about the anointing as a manifestation uh of a person, the the person only one, the spirit of God that was once manifested in the fleshly body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, today he is manifested in all of our bodies if we have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And if you have not received the baptism, uh you should. It's it's a free gift. You don't have to get good enough to receive him. &gt;&gt; In fact, he will come if you are willing. If you surrender, he will come. And when he gets there, he'll help do the house cleaning. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth has come, he'll start cleaning things out. &gt;&gt; I've been in Pentecost long enough to remember that they used to have a bucket and a sponge, not too far from the altar. &gt;&gt; I I'm just being honest. &gt;&gt; I grew up like that. And And if you know, you no one was turned away. You know, it didn't matter whether they had spiders on their eyelids or not. They weren't turned away. But but it was an amazing thing because as soon as they prayed through spirit of truth. Listen, when the spirit of truth has come, &gt;&gt; I was in Tanzania. It I'd been all over Africa. I was in Tanzania and I saw the first topless people, topless women walking up and down the busy streets of Dar Salam. And it was it was a bit of a shock because I had been all over Africa and everyone else had somehow figured a way to cover up. But these women were not vile women. They were mothers. They were grandmothers. They weren't trying to be uh you know particularly promiscuous. It it was just it was it was just hot and it was their culture. And one came to the service like that. And uh I I just you know uh wonder what the brothers would do. But they just went took a extra wrap off of one of the granny's. She had more than she needed. And they just asked her, "Would you mind?" They didn't they didn't cast it on her or or try to mistreat her. They just asked her, "Would you would you uh be willing to if you if you come in, we'd like for you to cover up." Well, she took it quite well. And she covered up and she tied it on. And in the process of that service, the spirit of the Lord fell &gt;&gt; and right down on her face she went. And uh in fact, there was a great deliverance that took place in her life. Demons were cast out. And I think I know there's a photo down at the fellowship hall on the photo wall uh of that service. And I didn't look to see if that woman's picture is there. But when she got up, she had wept. She had cried. She had emptied herself. Demons had gone out of her life. And uh the the uh as she started to leave, she she took that cloak and she was she was trying to figure out how she was going to give it back to Granny and still be clothed herself. &gt;&gt; And so, uh Granny said, "Oh, you you keep it. You keep it." And that that woman was so thrilled and so blessed that she didn't have to take that off anymore because the Lord had changed her heart. &gt;&gt; No one taught her &gt;&gt; the spirit of God. When the spirit of truth has come, &gt;&gt; the spirit of God, if you're filled with a real genuine Holy Ghost, he he'll tell you you don't want to be fake. Right? &gt;&gt; You don't want to look phony. &gt;&gt; You want to be real. Somebody said, "Well, it doesn't really matter." It matters &gt;&gt; because the spirit of truth says that it matters. &gt;&gt; We have the blessing of not just walking along with him anymore, but he now lives inside of us. &gt;&gt; But there is something greater. There is a greater fellowship that is available to you and I than just having him living inside of us. &gt;&gt; There is a corporate manifestation or a corporate administration of the spirit of truth that lives inside of us. I believe we may have read this on Tuesday evening, but would you go to Numbers 11 and uh verse 24 and 25? And Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord and gathered the 70 men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle. And the Lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him. Who is the himymn here? Moses. And gave it what does it say? &gt;&gt; Unto the 70 elders. So the word of the Lord came down in a cloud and God reached into Moses and took a portion of an abiding presence uh that lived in Moses. He was a forerunner &gt;&gt; and that anointing was living in him in a manifest way. God said, "I'm going to take that and I'm going to divide that spirit that was on Mo." Did Moses lose it? &gt;&gt; No. No. Moses still had it. &gt;&gt; But God just reached down into Moses and he said, "I'm going to take 70 portions &gt;&gt; of this anointing that's in the life of the leader and I'm going to divide that up among the elders." And what Moses was able to accomplish with wisdom and administration, leadership and government, I'm now going to have that same anointing, &gt;&gt; same authority, same administration. It's now going to fall on 70 men &gt;&gt; and they're going to make it an easier task &gt;&gt; instead of one man trying to do it all. &gt;&gt; The example is set. 70 men anointed with the same spirit &gt;&gt; that was upon Moses. &gt;&gt; Now you may be one who thinks of a of someone's personal spirit as a personality a and uh you know we used to say I just feel a little disturbance in my spirit we would say or or I'm a little troubled in my spirit. Uh it's all right to say that but uh I pray it's not true. I pray that if there's a disturbance it's in the mind and the will and the emotion realm of who you are because if your spirit that inner of the inner if that is disturbed it's missing something &gt;&gt; because that is to be the the resurrected life. &gt;&gt; The the seed that has to die before the life can be released. The life has been released on that fallen spirit and now it is a regenerated, resurrected and renewed spirit just as if it was coming again out of the mouth. &gt;&gt; It's breath. &gt;&gt; It's ruach. It's life. And just as if it were coming out of his mouth aresh a new. Uh this is what happens to us when we have a born again experience. It's a re it's a regeneration. Say the word with me. regeneration. It's not a replacement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no replacement. It's it's a resurrection. Can we call it a new spirit? We can because it's been infused with new life, &gt;&gt; but it's not replacing the old. It's killing the old &gt;&gt; and resurrecting what should have been there before the fall. &gt;&gt; Do you do you understand that? So don't think of your spirit as your nature or your personality or you might say she has a quiet spirit. He has a boisterous spirit. They have an argumentative spirit. That's not what we're talking about here. It was not God taking a portion of the personality of Moses and dividing it among the people &gt;&gt; because then you've got one genuine and 70 imitations. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; 70 impersonations &gt;&gt; of one Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this wasn't God making 70 William Brandoms. &gt;&gt; It wasn't God making 70 Moses. It was God taking that deposit of himself that was abiding in Moses and dividing it upon a corporate body. And that's as far as it went, 70. And then we go over to Acts chapter 2 and we have another installment of a release of a corporate anointing. Follow me now. &gt;&gt; I think you'll want to know this in in a bit. You'll want to have this fresh in your mind in just a few moments. Now on that day, the Bible tells us that there were 120 men who were gathered in the upper room. And that great pillar of fire that led Moses and the children of Israel through the wilderness, it showed up under this new dispens under the new covenant, the new testament. It shows up on on the feast of Shàuote and it fills the room. This this manifest anointing. &gt;&gt; You you remember that brother Brandham taught us that the pillar of fire is the same as the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; It's the same as the anointing. &gt;&gt; It is a manifestation of the same spirit. All the same the cloud a manifestation of the same spirit &gt;&gt; the same same anointing &gt;&gt; same spirit. &gt;&gt; So the pillar of fire now divided itself and and there was a rushing mighty wind. A sound filled the room as the as the ruach of the Lord come rushing in. And no doubt it was swirling above their heads. And and the Bible said that it appeared as cloven tongues of fire &gt;&gt; like this, &gt;&gt; licks of fire, tongues of fire upon each of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's big. &gt;&gt; I know you know that, but that's big business. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Same fire that divided the Red Sea. Same fire that led them all the way through. &gt;&gt; The same the very one and the same showed up in the New Testament. But now he said, "I'm going to divide myself upon all who are here." &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us there were 120. That's beautiful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's already a higher level. How many got that portion under the ministry of Moses? 70. And and and and how many initially got that portion and then it stopped. 70 was the end. Period. I know I'm restating for a purpose. Period. &gt;&gt; It didn't keep moving. 70 men leading, judging, hearing all the crud &gt;&gt; and having to decide what to do about it. calming all the nerves, settling all the arguments. &gt;&gt; 70 men doing it. &gt;&gt; And nobody had to say, "Oh, I don't like what you said. I don't like what I I wanted Moses. I come for Moses." &gt;&gt; Nobody had to do that because they were able to recognize that the same spirit &gt;&gt; that was on Moses now rested on 70 other men. &gt;&gt; I hope you hear this. That's right. &gt;&gt; It has never been God's design from the beginning to put all that he was in one man only. &gt;&gt; He's always been looking for a house to live in. &gt;&gt; And if you know anything about him, you know that he likes a house with lots of rooms. &gt;&gt; He likes a lot of places to stretch out and dwell. &gt;&gt; What house will you build me? I'm looking for a place to live. This is what his message is to us. I'm looking for not not a place to visit, &gt;&gt; a place to inhabit, &gt;&gt; not a place to show up on Sunday &gt;&gt; and you not feel my presence or know me until Tuesday. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I want to be with you. I really want to be in you and I don't ever want to leave you once I occupy. &gt;&gt; We're talking about not an incarnation. We've already had an incarnation. We're talking about a corporate habitation. &gt;&gt; We're talking about that same anointing, that same person of Jesus Christ, his character, his attributes, his power, his authority, &gt;&gt; dividing itself. First, 70 men. Period. The spirit of leadership, the spirit of administration that was on Moses, the spirit of wisdom &gt;&gt; as we read in Isaiah, the the sevenfold spirit of God. Oh, the spirit of wisdom, this beautiful uh the reverential fear, all these beautiful things that are found in the one spirit. And Moses got them. He got the deposit. He hit the jackpot. &gt;&gt; But it was more than he could handle. There were too many people with too many problems. &gt;&gt; So God said, "I'm going to," it was always his plan. &gt;&gt; He just wanted to wear Moses a little thin &gt;&gt; to show people the beauty. Hallelujah. The beauty of God not living in a pastor only &gt;&gt; or God not living in a prophet only &gt;&gt; or a teacher only or or a grandma only. &gt;&gt; But the beauty of what it's like when every believer can come all the way through Pass the earnest of the Holy Spirit to the full occupation. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Fully occupied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you driving a point? I'm driving. I'm going to drive. I'm going to pound the point &gt;&gt; because I want you to understand that this in us is to produce something &gt;&gt; earthshattering. It it produced something in the time of Jesus that that the Bible tells us that it was being told all over the known world that these are the men who turned the world upside down &gt;&gt; who turned the world upside down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Caused every religion, every false worship had to take note that God was now living &gt;&gt; in a corporate people. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not many gods. &gt;&gt; Nope. That's right. &gt;&gt; They They knew what it was like to have many gods. The Greeks knew. The Romans knew. The pagans knew what it was like to have many deities, but they didn't know what it was. This concept of one mighty God, &gt;&gt; only one now dividing himself to live in many bodies. and they're just scratching their head and they said, "These are those men." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These are those men who turn the world upside down. &gt;&gt; That means they disturb the devil's business. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They wreap havoc on the works of darkness in their day. &gt;&gt; So much so that they set that little witch free, that little girl who was uh sold into into witchcraft. And uh oh my she was uh making money for her pimps &gt;&gt; with her spells. &gt;&gt; Woo. And they lo she she found a new life and they lost their source of income. &gt;&gt; No wonder they said the world was turned upside down. &gt;&gt; It changed taxation. It changed everything &gt;&gt; that there was a corporate Messiah. &gt;&gt; Preach. Oh. Oh. I I'm giving away the punch. &gt;&gt; That's all right. &gt;&gt; Line. Oh, punch line. &gt;&gt; Not punch. That's not nice. Punch line. &gt;&gt; I'm giving that away by telling you that now there was a corporate Messiah &gt;&gt; on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A many membered Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What does Messiah mean? &gt;&gt; Anointed one. &gt;&gt; What does Messiah mean? &gt;&gt; There was a corporate Messiah on the scene. &gt;&gt; A many membered Messiah. &gt;&gt; The Messiah now living in many houses. &gt;&gt; This was God's plan. &gt;&gt; He foreshadowed it in the ministry of Moses. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He demonstrated it in shàuote Pentecost, the day of Pentecost. He demonstrated it and now instead of stopping at 70, it went to 120 and by the end of the day it was already 3,000. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This revival that started in the upper room, it spilled out because you can't keep 120 drunk men in a room for very long. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody got to go. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Somebody's coming out of there &gt;&gt; and they're stumbling down the steps and gathered in Jerusalem. Oh my. Uh, think about this concept. They've come from the east. They've come from the west. They've come from the north and the south &gt;&gt; to dine with the king, &gt;&gt; to feast as his guest. How blessed these pilgrims are &gt;&gt; beholding his hallowed face &gt;&gt; with a glow with light divine blessed partakers of his grace as jewels in his crown &gt;&gt; to shine. &gt;&gt; It didn't start a generation ago. &gt;&gt; It started in a Moses installment. It it it increased in a New Testament demonstration &gt;&gt; where 120 quickly became 3,000 that quickly became 5,000 that quickly became 7,000 &gt;&gt; that quickly became 12,000. &gt;&gt; How many messiahs were there? One. &gt;&gt; One one one Messiah &gt;&gt; one anointed one. &gt;&gt; But now he has divided himself. So if you ran into one of those 120, &gt;&gt; what would you be meeting on the street? &gt;&gt; You'd be meeting a portion &gt;&gt; of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; It's a corporate body. Now you see the corner is turning &gt;&gt; and they're doing today what they did way back when. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; They're refusing to to discern the change of the rhythm. God has a rhythm. &gt;&gt; He's a divine bandmaster. &gt;&gt; He has a rhythm. Everything God does has a rhythm. What do you mean by that? I mean he moves in cycles. He moves in seasons. He moves in ages. He moves in dispensations. But he's not all over the place. &gt;&gt; He's not chaotic. &gt;&gt; It's not as though he's making up a plan as he goes. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me on that? &gt;&gt; He knows. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he's doing. And he's been planning to do this from the beginning. I'm looking for a way to get who I am in as many people as I possibly can for a final showdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see Mount Carmel, there's another showdown &gt;&gt; prophesied &gt;&gt; in similitude to uh the Mount Carmel showdown, but it moves into another installment in the very last of the last and it becomes a showdown on Mount Zion. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't have a clue what that means." Well, you won't until you begin to search the scripture and understand that Zion is not just a city or a hill &gt;&gt; or a portion of Jerusalem, but Zion is actually an overcoming company of people. &gt;&gt; Lift up your head, oh you gates. &gt;&gt; Because you're the part that's going to welcome the King of glory. &gt;&gt; The King of glory wants to come in his people, &gt;&gt; and he wants to come in in a way that is magnified. Just a moment. Magnified from the Moses administration. Magnified from the day of Pentecost administration. He wants to come in and fully occupy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's like Tommy Osbborne who went to India uh he and Daisy and they labored in the uh among the Hindus and uh wasn't maybe as many Muslims there as there are now but but the Hindus and these these men uh and women they are high level they deal in high level witchcraft &gt;&gt; and the people marvel. They don't believe you. They think it had to be a gimmick or a trick. But when I was at Chennai for brother Sadu, uh taping television programs for Angel TV, uh I had so many supernatural exper from the from the first night I landed in India to the night I left. I had so many supernatural experiences that I couldn't hardly keep up with them because there was so much of the darkness that was emerging over the land that God said the only way for me to keep my people whole and clean is I'm going to have to I'm going to have to pour out my spirit on them. I'm going to have to just do something for them to keep them from being distracted by what the enemy's doing in the land. And so I had multiple experiences that were tangible and real before the Lord. But I stood one day and looked out my window and I saw a man levitating across the street. And there were no strings and there were no tricks and there were no hidden poles in his pants legs. All the things that charlatans may have done through the years to try to pretend like they were levitating. But this was nothing but the very uh works of witchcraft and darkness. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because I had a little fun. That's how I know. &gt;&gt; You see, where you are should be a no-fly zone. &gt;&gt; If anybody's going to fly in my my zone, it's going to be me. &gt;&gt; You're going to land. &gt;&gt; And you're not coming down on a pillow, buddy. You're going to come down in such a manner that you're going to look around and try to discover who it is that put you on your hind end &gt;&gt; on the street corner in Chennai because there's a God. &gt;&gt; There's a God that's bigger. Do you believe that? There's a God bigger than any Hindu shaman. &gt;&gt; Bigger than any witchcraft. Bigger. He's powerful. He is above it all. Behold, I give unto you power &gt;&gt; to tread upon serpents and scorpions. And if you drink any deadly thing, it shall not harm you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We need some of that. We don't need it anymore. Just in India and Vanuatu and places like that where the witch doctors in Vanuatu separate their heads from their bodies and put them on shelves and people come to see it. And someone said, "I don't believe that." I guess you don't believe that there are people in the in the western part of Africa that walk into the ocean either, do you? And live I guess you don't believe that there are people who have been have become so adapted to living underwater by the occupation of demon forces that they do their they live their whole life under there. And the only reason why they come out is is to to make the power of their demons known and to show people this is very well documented. And you know what? At the end of the day, you probably think it matters to me whether you believe my story or not. You'd be surprised how little it matters. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, you're just being rude." No, I'm telling you like it is. Because you live a little sheltered life in a one-horse town in Alabama doesn't mean and and it's not happening where you can see it &gt;&gt; doesn't mean that it's not happening in other places. &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied for over 70 years that the that the works of darkness that have at one season or another they have been uh limited to other parts of the world. It was has been prophesied for over 70 years that what has been seen in the darkest jungles of Africa will show up on the continent of North America. And the church &gt;&gt; the church is ill equipped &gt;&gt; to be able to deal with it. &gt;&gt; That's why there's going to have to be a corporate messiah. &gt;&gt; There's going to have to be a people that have already been through the fire. Come on. &gt;&gt; There's going to have to be a people who've already been through the fire. &gt;&gt; That work of darkness and the different administrations while they do surgeries without without any form of anesthesia. They remove body parts without without surgical scalpels. They plant fetishes in in in bodies of those they want to occupy like needles in their eyeballs. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't believe in such a thing as that." Doesn't matter whether you believe in it or not. &gt;&gt; I have friends that have dealt really heavy into that kind of of deliverance. And I'm going to tell you something. There's nothing attractive about it to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been riding along with them through the north California country and and these uh folks I don't want to say their name but these folks who have dealt with they didn't have a choice because Anton Lee's daughter showed up at their church and uh this was many years ago and if you don't know he was the author of the Satanic Bible and worse than that he was leading uh all the different groups of Satanist at one time not around the world but in America. &gt;&gt; And uh there were all kinds of filthy things that were taking place. And uh I've been riding along with them when they started talking about these things. And the and the automobile began to uh witness &gt;&gt; by by uh unlocking and locking and unlocking and locking and locking and unlocking as you're driving through a particular place. So somebody said, "I don't know about all of that." You ought to you ought to at least know &gt;&gt; that it's there. &gt;&gt; May it never bother you. I pray you never have to deal with anything on that level. But I will tell you that if you are not very careful, you'll open the door of your life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; By what you let in the eye gate &gt;&gt; because Hollywood is about 15 somewhere between 15 and 20 years ahead of the nominal church. They're they're tapping in &gt;&gt; to something that the church is so far behind in &gt;&gt; and they use that they put that on display because they want people to uh to uh want it, to crave it, to desire it. &gt;&gt; And so they start looking for where they can find it. And they're giving pieces of their life away so that they can gain more power. Somebody said, "I certainly didn't come to the house of God to hear about the works of darkness." Well, uh, I'm sorry, but we don't need to be ignorant of his devices either. But what we need to know is that there is a corporate Messiah &gt;&gt; who's forming in the land. &gt;&gt; Not just 70, &gt;&gt; not just 120 that eventually multiplied to several thousand, but something actually much much greater than that. &gt;&gt; Not necessarily in number. Amen. &gt;&gt; But in potency &gt;&gt; because he's been after a people &gt;&gt; since Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For 2,000 years. He's been looking for a people that he could occupy &gt;&gt; in the last days. And this is something that we want to grab a hold of because if there is such a thing, you don't have to believe it yet, but if there is such a thing, I want it. I want to be in that. &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Galatians 1, I want you to know Paul understood it &gt;&gt; as the first church age messenger. Let's move quickly. Galatians 1:15-16. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, why? Why? Why, Paul? Why, Shaul? Why were you separated from your mother? Why were you called by his grace uh as it pleased God? Someone tell me why. Paul's testimony is that his creator wanted to reveal his son &gt;&gt; to me &gt;&gt; in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In me &gt;&gt; that I might preach him among the heathen. &gt;&gt; Did Did Paul need for the son to be revealed in him in order to preach him among the heathen? Yes or no? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because just to know about him will as as one of the ministers mentioned, just knowing about him can leave you stripped naked, &gt;&gt; beat up and running through the street because those demons rose up and said, "Paul, I know and and this one I know, but &gt;&gt; what truck did you fall off of?" because we don't sense any power &gt;&gt; because they were trying to do it in a proxy form. &gt;&gt; I adure you by the name of the God that Paul preached about you. You see that's church. &gt;&gt; That's like a creed. &gt;&gt; The devils, they don't fear that. &gt;&gt; They don't fear organized religion. No sir, &gt;&gt; we can get this over if you'll help me. &gt;&gt; They don't fear that. They fear somebody who has been occupied &gt;&gt; by the God that Paul preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you don't even have to introduce yourself. That's &gt;&gt; right. A &gt;&gt; and you don't have to say, "I'm coming to you today uh in the name of the one that uh they were talking about the other day in the marketplace." &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You just come in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. A and you just say, "You foul demon of hell. &gt;&gt; I command you to bow to the authority of Jesus Christ. Go. Go." You see, Jesus had a ministry model that doesn't look anything like charismatic chaos today. &gt;&gt; He didn't interview them. He didn't ask them how long they'd had the demon. He didn't ask them uh how many Ouija boards they played with, how many horseshoes they hung over the door, how many lucky rabbits foots they carried foot feet, whatever. How how they they He didn't ask him anything like that. When when Jesus was confronted with the possessed, his ministry model was not let me find out its name, how long it's been, all the detail. I need details. I need details. I need detail. Inquiring minds want to know and I need details. No, no, no, &gt;&gt; no. He didn't do any of that. Didn't matter. Didn't matter its name. Well, he asked uh at at one occasion, but most of the time it didn't matter how long you been, how many are you? The these were just occasional things that were uh for our for our learning. They're there for us. But his his main ministry model for dealing with the demon possessed was go. &gt;&gt; The scripture says literally Jesus said go. &gt;&gt; See, it wasn't the word. It was the authority. &gt;&gt; He could have said hocus pocus. &gt;&gt; He could have said little boy blue. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He could have said little Miss Muffet. &gt;&gt; It wasn't words. It was the authority of the word &gt;&gt; that he was. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; So it's not always knowing the right thing to say to the devil. Sometime it's just having the life, &gt;&gt; the authority &gt;&gt; of the one that he fears the most &gt;&gt; living in you as a part of the corporate Messiah and he has to flee. &gt;&gt; I'm not done. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to need to come on up with us here for just a moment to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the heathen immediately. I conferred not with flesh and blood. I I I didn't get what I got from a teacher. I didn't get what I got from my mama or my daddy. I didn't get what I got from the church house. Uh but something came on me. His son was not revealed to me. &gt;&gt; He was revealed where &gt;&gt; does it matter? &gt;&gt; Does that tiny little preposition matter? &gt;&gt; Certainly does. And it's going to matter for you, too. Let's see what else uh the apostle said in the book of Galatians that that was written to the church in Galatia chapter 4 verse 6. Benjamin, could you come and plug that ugly fan up and and let it blow me just a little bit here? Uh and because ye are sons. &gt;&gt; Now, he's just told us how it started with him. The son was revealed in him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, he's going to tell us about our hope. And because ye are sons, because ye are sons, not to make you sons, &gt;&gt; because you are sons. Do you understand that sunship has different Thank you, son. It has different levels, &gt;&gt; but you're always as a born again believer, you're always a son. and and and you may start off uh as a technon, a little infant, &gt;&gt; and that's a horrible stage sometime both naturally and spiritually. You see, I've been around long enough to experience what they call the terrible twos in the spiritual. Praise God. &gt;&gt; When you when you got babes in Christ that begin to uh cut their uh eye teeth, their jaw teeth on the meat of the word, &gt;&gt; uh they they can go through that terrible two- stage where where you really want to lock them up &gt;&gt; uh uh spiritually speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they're just bundles of energy. They're ready to take on the world, &gt;&gt; but but they don't have the authority to go with the power that they have found. &gt;&gt; And so this process of school masters and tutors, the Bible talks about Paul particularly talks about growing them up and training them up so that one day they're more than than just technons. They're wheel sons. &gt;&gt; And those wheel sons are those who have the authority of the father. &gt;&gt; Hello. and they are authorized to conduct business in the father's name. &gt;&gt; And their name on the check is as good as his name on the check. &gt;&gt; This is the full adoption process. &gt;&gt; This is the scriptural Middle Eastern form of adoption. Nothing like our Americanized form of adoption today. Uh this is one that you qualify for by learning all that you need to learn. Nobody's just going to turn an inheritance over to you unless you go through the process of being tested and tried. I'll give you a little authority first and if you fail, I'm going to take some of that back. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; but I'll give you I'll try again. &gt;&gt; That's what it what our school master says to us. A and if you'll prove me now a &gt;&gt; as trustworthy, I'll give you a little more of that authority &gt;&gt; until one day you'll no longer have to say I'm the son of so and so. You'll just go down and say I'm here to conduct business. &gt;&gt; This is what the scripture teaches. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "We're looking for this." And Paul knew it well. And now he said uh uh first he spoke about the son being revealed in him. And now he says, "And because you are sons, &gt;&gt; God hath sent forth the spirit of his son &gt;&gt; where on you &gt;&gt; into." &gt;&gt; Now Paul is identifying what was poured out on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And he's not identifying this as a third person of the Trinity. &gt;&gt; He's identifying this as the very same spirit that was on Jesus Christ. Look, he said, "God hath sent forth the spirit of who?" &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; His son where into your hearts &gt;&gt; crying, &gt;&gt; "Papa, &gt;&gt; aba, &gt;&gt; aba, father." It's incredible that with all of the Greek choices of uh interpreted words in the New Testament, it's amazing that there was at least one Hebrew expression that made it all the way through to the New Testament. Aba, aba, papa. It's like saying daddy. It's not like saying father. It's a term of endearment. And Paul said, "The Son had to be revealed in me so that I could teach you the way. And because you have learned the way, because you understand that you are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts." And that part, that part of who you are is the part that cries out, &gt;&gt; "Daddy, &gt;&gt; papa." &gt;&gt; I had someone ask me, "Is it okay to say papa?" Is it okay to say aba if you're talking about the son? Here's the answer. Galatians 4:6. God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying aba papa daddy father &gt;&gt; understand that the eternal spirit of the creator is above us but at the same time the spirit of the son same spirit same spirit and the word became flesh. I know we're going slow. &gt;&gt; I'm slow. I feel slow, &gt;&gt; but it's all right. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God 160. God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both father, son, and Holy Ghost. The fullness of the Godhead bodily. You should be familiar with this. Now, the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily dwells in his church. I I hear people reading it and they gloss over that as though it's not a major explosion. &gt;&gt; This is a major explosion. &gt;&gt; Now the complete fullness. &gt;&gt; Say fullness. &gt;&gt; Fullness. &gt;&gt; Was there any part of the word that didn't become flesh in Jesus Christ? I'm asking you carefully. Was there any part of the word? John 1:1, in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. &gt;&gt; Verse 14, and the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Was there any part of the word, this is logos, is there any part of the word that didn't find its bodily expression in Jesus Christ? The red letters are the key. If you go open your Bible to the red letters and read what Jesus said, he will leave you with no doubt &gt;&gt; because he said uh as I mentioned last Sunday, he said, "You you've been looking for me. You've been talking about you've been looking for him. You've been talking about him and you didn't even know him &gt;&gt; because I've been here with you all along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you would have known him, you would have recognized who I am. &gt;&gt; You You didn't really know father. You didn't really know father. Because if you would have really known father, you would have recognized father &gt;&gt; as he stood before you in the sun. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. Am I am I taken away? I know. I know. which I know we're dragging on here, but but am I taking away from the truth or am I telling you exactly what the truth said? So, in Christ dwelt the fullness &gt;&gt; of the word, &gt;&gt; the fullness of the Godhead &gt;&gt; in bodily form. &gt;&gt; And now a prophet is here to tell us, of course, the scriptures are clear, but here he is to reinforce this. And he tells us now the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; This is big. &gt;&gt; I want somebody to pop. I I want somebody Please. Thank you. Thank you. I I can't let this moment go by without somebody letting off a little steam here. This is huge. It is &gt;&gt; the full, the complete &gt;&gt; perfected fullness of the Godhead. All that the father, all that the son, all that holy spirit dwells in his church. &gt;&gt; Now, you got to know what his church is. &gt;&gt; He only has one. &gt;&gt; And his church is the one that's built on the rock, &gt;&gt; not Peter Petro, the rock of revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if a now listen I don't want to upset nobody especially visitors here but let me just be plain. If a church is built on anything less &gt;&gt; than the revelation of who Jesus is &gt;&gt; if they call him anything less than what the word has called him. &gt;&gt; If they call him a a second person &gt;&gt; that makes him a spare wheel. &gt;&gt; He's certainly not that. &gt;&gt; Hello. I hear them even around this message calling him less. &gt;&gt; They keep using that son of God. Son of God, son of God, as though it is a lesser title. &gt;&gt; It's actually not. &gt;&gt; It's actually not. It's a chip off the old block. &gt;&gt; You may find a quote or two that make it look like there's some. And the ones they like are the ones that talk about his baptism. And that's because they forget what we've been taught about adoption. &gt;&gt; Though we were God, I really believe the scripture clear. Though we were God, &gt;&gt; he was God all along. Jesus was word made flesh all along. &gt;&gt; He was Godhead entirely, entirety, all of it &gt;&gt; was in his flesh. &gt;&gt; Though he were God, yet he learned obedience &gt;&gt; by the things he suffered. Scripture said so. &gt;&gt; And in all manner tempted even as we are. &gt;&gt; Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I know I keep asking. If I felt like you were wouldn't keep asking. I won't get on your nerves too bad. But if he were not all of that &gt;&gt; and if you make him anything less than that, then you're not the church. &gt;&gt; This is very hard to say, &gt;&gt; but that's not the church. It's a false representation of church. &gt;&gt; And the promises that apply to the church. It doesn't mean a building. It doesn't mean new hope. &gt;&gt; This is a universal body. &gt;&gt; It's one you can't join by membership. It's one you have to be born into. &gt;&gt; And that's not in a natural birth. That's a you got your earth birth. That's the heaven birth. That's the birth from above. Come on. &gt;&gt; We still through the years, we've still had people come and say, "Could I move my letter?" Your what? Could I move my letter? Can you call my old church and see if they can send you my letter? My mama was Baptist, so I know what that is. Or but I like to play dumb sometime. You what? you know your letter that says you're a member of say oh no we don't need that we don't have a membership roster &gt;&gt; you you can't join this church &gt;&gt; this is not an open membership church &gt;&gt; the Bible said his church is the church of the firstborn &gt;&gt; the only way to get into that church the church that's built on the revelation of who Jesus is is to be born into that church. &gt;&gt; And you're born into it by by water. &gt;&gt; By proper baptism &gt;&gt; and by spirit, &gt;&gt; the infilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Does it matter how you're baptized? I guess it does. If you want to join the right church, &gt;&gt; if you're only carrying the baptism of a title, uh, then I don't know exactly what you're a part of, but I don't want nothing to do with it. I'll tell you that right now. If you want to be a part of his church, you've got to be willing to wear his name. &gt;&gt; After all, I know you're bored. &gt;&gt; After all, you're a part of a corporate Messiah. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you wear a portion of Messiah's name? &gt;&gt; No wonder, brother Brandon preached that this little bride is Ms. Jesus Christ. Uh because Eve was in Adam, &gt;&gt; the bride was in Christ. &gt;&gt; He told us flesh of his flesh, &gt;&gt; bone of &gt;&gt; bone of his bone. &gt;&gt; He said now now uh the Godhead body dwells in his church. The preeminences. What time is it anyway? Oh, it's not not too bad. All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all Christ was was poured into the church. &gt;&gt; There are all kind of believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whosoever callth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. &gt;&gt; That makes him a believer. But when I'm talking about a believer here, I'm talking about more than just being uh a name on a number, a name on a roll or a number on a chart. I'm talking about being a part of the church of the redeemed &gt;&gt; things that are to be realto. He said, "Now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age. You are the expressing." Somebody say, "I am the expressing." &gt;&gt; If God is going to express himself in these last days, he's not going to do it just in a light, a cloud, a pillar of fire. He can do all those things. He can show himself powerful in a rainbow. He can do all of these things, but but if he's really going to express himself in these last days, he won't have to just rely on all of these other uh demonstrations or manifestations of other dispensations. He's now finding a way to express himself in the last of the last days. &gt;&gt; And that's in a corporate messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If that coin ever drops, if that ever drops in you, &gt;&gt; if you ever catch a big old glimpse of why you're here, it's so popular to say today, discover your why. Discover your why. Discover your why. And and I like it. I actually like it. I actually like the fact that they are encouraging people to discover their purpose &gt;&gt; because some people think that their purpose is just to exist &gt;&gt; as perhaps a survivor. &gt;&gt; But we sang this morning about the overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know what he said. Because I overcome, &gt;&gt; you can also overcome. And that's the that's the first part of the discovery of your why. Knowing that you are not a survivor. &gt;&gt; You are not a skin of the teeth Christian. &gt;&gt; But you've been called as an overcomer. &gt;&gt; That means you got to get over something. &gt;&gt; What is it that you and I have to come over? &gt;&gt; We have to come over the spirit of the age. We have to come over land toa &gt;&gt; cold Christianity formal religion lukewarm existence &gt;&gt; barely surviving &gt;&gt; when we're called to overcome &gt;&gt; behold I give you power &gt;&gt; hello &gt;&gt; behold I give you power &gt;&gt; over what? &gt;&gt; Over what? &gt;&gt; Over what? all &gt;&gt; all power. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "You're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate." You see, there's a difference between a personal individual anointing and you can carry yours. It's all right. There will be different administrations of the anointing in different individual lives. You know, everybody says, "I want to play. I'd like to play the piano." Have you ever met anybody that hadn't said, maybe you have, "I've I've hardly met anybody around the church who has said, I there's one thing I sure would never want to do. I would never want to be able to play the piano like they do." Have you ever heard anybody say that? Everybody says, "Oh, I want to play." Oh, oh, I wish I could play the piano like Cade. Oh, I wish I could play the piano like Sister Laurel. Oh, I wish I could play the piano like Marbette or whoever else. Jonathan, when you hear Jonathan, you hear a lot of Jonathan. You also hear a lot of his teacher. You hear a lot of Sister West. And it's wonderful to me. It's a sound that I grew up on here. &gt;&gt; And I love it. And I and I don't I hope he takes that as a compliment. I think you do because I hear him. I hear his licks and frills and things that God's given him, but I also hear some progressions in there that that uh were were sort of created and forerrun by Sister Janette West. &gt;&gt; But but how many of you let let's be honest, how many of you'd like to play the piano? You just really love to sit down and my my play the piano. Some of you don't want to do anything. Some of you will watch a 4-hour program because you're too lazy to get up and change the channel. Don't talk to me about what you want to do. I can insult with a straight face sometime. Oh, I wish I could be. But here's the reality. The proof &gt;&gt; of the desire is in the pursuit. &gt;&gt; You really don't want to play the piano if you're not even willing to pursue to learn the scale. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you mean is you want to go sit down the piano and have God fall in your lap and teach you how to play the piano. You get up, you never had to learn a note of music. &gt;&gt; And that has happened for a very few people. The reason why it doesn't happen more for people is because we have a tendency to take that kind of gift for granted. &gt;&gt; But the kind we work with &gt;&gt; and we train and tune it. &gt;&gt; It still comes from God. The talent, the gift is from God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But these people who think they don't have to practice, somebody said, you know, I've been doing certain certain things for 40 years and I don't need to practice. I beg your pardon. &gt;&gt; I hear your sour notes, too. Right. We we're we're taking this gift seriously &gt;&gt; and we're working with it to improve it. &gt;&gt; But if we really wanted to learn to play, we would learn to play. &gt;&gt; I don't believe there's anybody that couldn't learn. You may not have the the personal anointing to play like someone else. But that doesn't mean you can't learn the music. You can certainly learn the music. So there is a personal anointing. Most people can carry a tune until you give them a note, a key. Sometimes when you give them a key, they're they're lost. I heard a young man, African-American man, singing at the youth camp last night, and I tell you what, I wanted to to commend him. I was streaming it. I wanted to commend him because the piano player was most definitely not following the tag. In fact, none of the amazing musicians present were really following the tag. And that young man, I tell you what I would have done. I would have been in big trouble because I have a tendency to lose the melody. And if I lose the melody, I'll sing with the music. And a lot of people do. I I can say that because I'm not the only person. We see it demonstrated from time to time. The piano does something different and the voice goes right with the piano. And uh that can be a disaster. But that young man maintained enough of his melody that he didn't lose his spot. The he had to adjust the melody slightly, but he got through the song without being in a different key. Did you see a cage? Do you know what I'm talking about? He he got through it, and I was impressed. I would have liked to have uh uh given him a a bouquet of of flowery words because it takes a lot to be able to do that. He has an anointing and his anointing wasn't based on what the and I'm sure the piano player, he was doing amazing on other songs, but he obviously never heard that little tag part and he could not get it. He tried so hard. Well, no, actually he he tried for a little while and then he stopped playing, which really leaves you out in the cold with your with your uh boxer shorts, but because that young man had a personal anointing &gt;&gt; to carry the tune. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, everyone can have it. You can have one to worship. You can have one to play. You can have one to speak. You can have one to pray. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a corporate anointing. That's a portion that's given to all of us. Let me read some notes and close. There are those great moments when we become so aware of the manifested presence, the anointing, the cavode, the shecka, the heavy glory of the Lord. Those moments when it is the will and purpose of our God to allow us a moment of encounter, a personal and intimate interaction with him. &gt;&gt; There may be others gathered near, but in those few short moments of time, &gt;&gt; everything and everyone fades from your conscious thoughts. And for that moment, you may be in a crowded church room, but for that moment, it is only you and the bridegroom. How many of you have ever experienced a moment like that? These times may seem far too few and way too much time in between, but the weight the weight of those encounters can continue to strengthen and encourage us for days and weeks and months and sometimes even years. Amen. &gt;&gt; The impact of one night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the king &gt;&gt; as we revisit them in our regular times of praise and thanksgiving. It's almost sometime like we draw strength from those moments of encounter again. If you believe that, say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For those who prepare and position themselves, there can also be daily daily interactions and engagements &gt;&gt; with the anointing because you don't have to go to church to find the anointing. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have mood music to find the anointing. &gt;&gt; The anointing is within you as a part of the corporate Messiah. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it may sound old fogy, but he's as close. He &gt;&gt; is as close as the mention of his name. &gt;&gt; It's not saying it like you're reading it off of a sign board. It's saying it like you know who you're talking. Raboni. &gt;&gt; Raboni. &gt;&gt; She said rabbi. Rabbi means teacher. But there was something about the way that she recognized her teacher now raised from the dead. now resurrected. Are you here? &gt;&gt; Raboni. It's like saying to him, "Master, I I'm not going to call anybody master." Someone said, "It doesn't matter whether you call a master or not. You're a slave to somebody or something." &gt;&gt; I'd rather be a bondervant. &gt;&gt; I'd rather be a bond slave for the Lord Jesus Christ. I'd rather him have my ownership. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I I'd rather be totally surrendered &gt;&gt; and obedient, submitted to his purpose and will. I don't mind calling him my master. &gt;&gt; Jesus, we sang for years. Jesus is my Lord, my master and Savior now and forever more. &gt;&gt; For those who prepare and position themselves, there can also be daily interactions and engagements with the anointing. While reading his written word, while meditating on his goodness, while interceding on behalf of others in prayer, &gt;&gt; while listening to a sermon that particularly stirs within you those seeds of destiny that are in you to inspire and guide you along on your spiritual journey. &gt;&gt; But that's not all. &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about those moments of bliss and glory. There's still another powerful way to engage and encounter the anointing, the presence of the anointed one. We were also created to encounter him in a corporate way. &gt;&gt; The corporate anointing. And here it is in a nutshell. He is the head. &gt;&gt; He is the head. &gt;&gt; He is the head &gt;&gt; and he dwells in us &gt;&gt; in a corporate body. &gt;&gt; Is the body a part of the head? Is the head a part of the body? &gt;&gt; You think if you check the DNA in the head, it'd be the same DNA that you found in the body. &gt;&gt; Do you think if you check the blood type that was flowing through the brain, it'd be the same blood that was flowing through your little toe? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you think that you not only have blood that flows but you have cells that are migrating through your body at all times? &gt;&gt; Did you know a recent study has discovered that there are uh amazing opportunities for neuroplasticity past the age of 80. For years, brain science believed that all you can do is live with the brain you're born with. You can't change it. You can't improve it. You can't rewire it. You don't even have the ability to reproduce healthier brain cells. Thanks be to God. It has now been discovered and proven what brother Brandon was already preaching in the 50s &gt;&gt; that we have a way of rewiring the hardware &gt;&gt; of our brain. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And then they thought you only have the ability to do that to to to about 21 to 24. And then they thought that they were able to discover by scans that there were new brain cells that were unlike original brain cells, healthier, stronger brain cells than than what had been produced in this body before. And they found that happening all the way up to 55 and 60 and 65. Can you imagine being 65 years old when everybody around you has already started declining? and your brain is producing healthier cells than it did when you were in your teens. Well, science has proven now this is possible. And now they have scanned under long studies people who have reached 80 plus and they have seen new synapses, new firings of of of of neuron connections in the brain and new healthy brain cells better, healthier, stronger than the original brain cells of the body. Somebody said, "Why are you telling us this?" Because it's the miracle of the creator. It's a we are fearfully and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; And it also tells me that you you uh maybe maybe you know a child born uh with addiction uh side effects because of an addicted mother. Or maybe you know someone who struggles on the on the on the multiaceted scale of autism. and you have determined that you have to uh own it and the title and and and celebrate knowing that's all that that person will ever be capable of. But I'm telling you right now, the brain science is now proving what the word says. &gt;&gt; You can renew this thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And you won't do it by following the latest Spiderman. &gt;&gt; You are what you eat. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting some of you to start climbing up the walls and spinning webs because we are what we eat. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But you can by feasting on what is true, what is holy, what is pure. The scripture said, "Think on these things. &gt;&gt; Meditate on these things." I'm closing, but I I I uh I'm happy where I am, but I'm closing. We're created to encounter something called the corporate anointing. He is the head and he dwells in us as a corporate body. Therefore, guess what? He is both head and body. I thought you said he was the head and we're the body. I did. Now you're saying he is the head and he's the body. I did because he's both head and body. &gt;&gt; And many have missed a very important truth here. A bride as bride and then wife. There is a transition from bride to wife. &gt;&gt; It's a matter of trust. It's a matter of exposure. It's a matter of being willing to show the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Are you just dragging on purpose here? &gt;&gt; You know, you take a girl out. I mean, it's been a long time since I did. and they don't eat. They order, but they don't eat. Well, let me tell you something. They crammed out going out the door, mister. And they crammed when they got home so that they wouldn't have to eat in front of you. Some girls are embarrassed to even excuse themselves to the washroom when they're with somebody they care about. How long do you think you're going to be maintain that? You live in the same house one day. You're going to wait till he goes to work to go to the bathroom, close the door, and say, "I got to have a little peace here." you you're going to sit and watch him eat breakfast and then he's barely out the door before you are you didn't even heat up the leftovers. You're just everything has to match. You look like a rag doll all the rest of the time, but but you're going out the door to meet him, you know, and you just got to have it all fixed up, all together. That's the way it's supposed to be. It's that getting to know one another stage. Maybe it would be good if it could maintain that a little bit longer than we actually do. It's not practical and it's certainly not livable. There comes a time as you marry that you know everything there is to know about the per I hope I hope you can discover as much as possible before you say I do. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz every monster that's hidden can quickly come out when they get what they want. &gt;&gt; Preach on. &gt;&gt; But here's the reality. You you you know they they uh they don't have any eyelashes, so they buy them. I saw a poor girl yesterday. I I I I wanted to like a granddaddy, I wanted to reach out and say to her, "Sweetheart, what do you see?" Have you ever wondered what somebody sees when they look in the mirror? What do you see when you look in the mirror? You couldn't possibly see what I see. her her eyelashes so heavy, so glued on, and so heavy that she couldn't even hardly hold them up. I'm not exaggerating. She weighed about 86 pounds. And she and she'd had a baby. She could hardly open her eyelids because of the weight of those synthetic spiders she was wearing in preparation for Halloween. And she had caked on every chemical you can buy in a bottle. And there was nothing real about her. She didn't even walk like a normal person. She didn't hold her head like a normal person or keep her eyes open like a normal person. My heart went out to her. One day you're not going to be able to keep up that charade. Somebody's going to know you. &gt;&gt; You fixed up in them jeans and fixed up in that. But but one of these days, you're you're going to hopefully find somebody you can spend the rest of your life with. And he's going to know you don't have any eyelashes. And he's going to know that God didn't give you them uh spiders on your eyelash. or what I was going to say is uh uh God didn't put that um botulism in your lips. &gt;&gt; He's going to see you as you really are. And if he falls in love with the fake and phony version of who you are, I'm not sure he's going to love the real you. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You better know it's not always going to stay the way it does in this in the according stages. But when you become man and wife, there there's nothing between you anymore. you you know everything. I I know this is plain talk, way too plain for most people, but but you're going to know you're going to know if there's a little too much on the You're going to know. You're going to know if it was padding you were looking at or if it was real. You're going to know. &gt;&gt; You're going to see the stitches if somebody's had a highiny boost. I'm not I mean it is funny but I'm not particularly trying to be but it is funny. You're going to know &gt;&gt; you can't hide all that. You you better know you can love that person. &gt;&gt; You see here is what it means to know Christ. &gt;&gt; Same thing. &gt;&gt; Marriage and the and the husband wife relationship I is a model for our relationship with Christ. You can dress up on Sunday and come and do the religious thing, sir. &gt;&gt; But he's going home with you, &gt;&gt; and he's going to know. He's going to know. He's going to see. And he's not going to love you any less &gt;&gt; because he's your bridegroom. And when you have that moment of of intimacy where you're one and the light bulb gets left on by mistake, &gt;&gt; you're going to know and he's going to know. And that's what the Bible's talking about when it says no. Ko, it's not a it's not a head knowing. It's an intimate knowing. And Mary knew no man. It didn't mean she had never met any. It means she'd never been intimate with any. So the kind of knowledge that we have to gain as part of the stature is not a head one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an exposure one. &gt;&gt; It's being real honest and open. When you go before the Lord, you're not trying to hide any bulges, any freckles, any any odd hair on your toe. &gt;&gt; You're just saying, "Here I am. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you could love me." Right? I I I I'm rotten. My my pinkie is crooked. How could you love me? I'm deformed. And he loves us more. And it has nothing to do with how we look. &gt;&gt; But it's part of the transition of trust. &gt;&gt; You see, the reason why it's so reserved in the beginning is because you don't know if he knows too much. If she knows too much about who you really are, they may run the other way. But as you begin to trust that person, you open up and you tell them your deepest thoughts and desires &gt;&gt; and they stay and they don't run. I don't know if you're following me or not, &gt;&gt; but that's our relationship with the Lord. And some of us ought to be coming clean with him pretty fast &gt;&gt; because he wants to know who you really are. &gt;&gt; Not who you pretend to be when others are around. &gt;&gt; He wants to know the real character of your heart because he wants to manifest his in you. &gt;&gt; And you got to get yours out of the way. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Good. I'm nearly done. You see, here's a part that's been missed. Musicians can come as bride and then wife. We are to dwell with him on earth as a corporate messiah. And that's a big responsibility. It's so big that one man couldn't do it in the end of the end days. It's so big that a model hear me now. Look this way. They don't need you watching them walk. They're very capable of making it to the music without your the assistance of your eyes. It's very important that we're able to pull this in as we leave here today because God's not looking for little perfect church children. He's looking for a corporate expression &gt;&gt; of the anointing of the Messiah. I can I could slam you with scriptures if somebody is still wondering, but I'll just give you another one here while it's in the notes. Acts 17:28, "For in him, in him we live and move and have our being, as certain also of your own poets have said, for we are also his offspring." May I mention that this is a pagan poet that's being quoted here, not a believer, but the apostle is using it because the crowd can connect with this expression, we are his offspring. It comes from a secular Greek poet, but he knew that everyone in the crowd knew the poem. Just like brother Brandham knew that everyone in the crowd had seen the advertisement for a thinking man's filter and he could preach on a cigarette pack that he found in the woods and have everyone's attention. Just like sometimes we can mention Barney Fe because because I can't I don't care how brother Dwayne he flashes his badge and everything, but he he just didn't fit the Barney role Barney F role for me. But I got the point. When I see that little that little officer standing out there, not much. You're going to blow him over with your car, but he flashes that badge. It's it's I see Barney F. He has nothing physical to make you think you ought to stop, but he just flashes that authority and you better stop. I don't care what he looks like. And that's such a powerful truth. So, it's okay to even use something that is that is a of of a of a cultural uh expression if you're going to use it with the great value of teaching the gospel like the apostle said. For in him we we live, we move, we have our being, as certain also of your own poets have said, for we are also his offspring. In the message, things that are to be, he said, now if we are those attributes of God, if we are those attributes of God, we cannot live by creeds. &gt;&gt; We cannot live by denominationalism. We must live by the word. &gt;&gt; Because the bride is a part because the bride is a part of the bridegroom. Because the bride is an expression of the corporate Messiah in the earth. &gt;&gt; That's it. She's a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband. It's actually deeper. It's actually deeper than that because you're not sharing DNA gene seed with your husband. But if you're part of that bride of Christ, he talks about the seed in Greek, the sperma. You've been implanted. I know this is way too plain for some pruds, but it's still a you've got a different seed. You are a product of your father's spermma in the natural. But I want to tell you something. You're also a continuation of a divine seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can't be filled with fast race cars. It can't be filled with fits of vodka. It can't be filled. You can drown it out. You can entertain it. You can give it speed and fill part of the need, &gt;&gt; but you'll never be able to satisfy. &gt;&gt; Goats won't satisfy, and cow won't satisfy, and dog won't satisfy, and cat won't satisfy. &gt;&gt; My dad was born with some kind of hunger for God, and he tried to fill it with with a persona. First, it was the ham radio CB. He was Uncle Bud and and and that was for Budweiser and that was his handle. He tried to drown the hunger and desire for something bigger and better, something more. He tried to drown it with a persona of a case of Uncle Buds. And then he went from one thing to another, a Drax draster car where he raced on the drag strip. and then the demol demolition race. And then he had miniature cows. And then he had miniature donkeys. And then he was raising minks. And the next thing I know he he's got monster trucks. And then I don't know how you move from monster trucks to racing go-karts. But he went from showing monster trucks to racing go-karts. And then there was something else. And then there was something else. And then there was something. Does it sound familiar to anybody? And then there was something else. And then there was something else. He spent his entire life chasing the wind. The wind in a circuit. And he's chasing after something that satisfies. I'm telling you, if you're born with a representation, it's some people call it an empty spot, but it that's really it's not a vacuum. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's actually something there. It's not the absence of something. It's the presence of something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll never feel it. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Five wives won't feel it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Five husbands won't fill it. &gt;&gt; Here she stands. Go tell your husband, I have none. Oh, you you've had none. You've had five. And the one you're living with right now is not your own. But I didn't tell you that to condemn you. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Five. Five husbands living with somebody else's husband. Six. And guess what? She found everything she had been looking for in the seventh man. Fat husband didn't last. Skinny husband didn't last. Rich husband didn't last. Poor husband didn't last. Smart husband didn't last. And the man she was living with was dumber than a box of rocks. And that didn't satisfy. &gt;&gt; But she found everything. &gt;&gt; She thought it was better sexuality she was looking for. Come on. &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; She She thought it was more security. She need She didn't even know. She didn't even know what she was looking for. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And neither did we. &gt;&gt; Until she found it. &gt;&gt; It's so powerful. &gt;&gt; I got to hush. It's so powerful, though. He had a shorter route. He had more than one shorter route. But he said, "I must need to go." Why? Because there was a part of him. There was a representation of what he was the fullness of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was going to the well, not when all the others went. She went alone. She was ostracized. Believe me, she wasn't called an adulteress because she had five husbands. She was considered a She wouldn't even go and get her water with the rest of the women. And had she have gone with Who cares? Who cares if the world ostracizes you? If you if you've got Christ, we have to get to a place where, you know, if they don't want to eat a turkey leg with me once a year, &gt;&gt; there's more turkey legs for me. &gt;&gt; You You do. You have to come to a place where where where you're not thriving only on these natural relationships &gt;&gt; because if she would have gone when everybody else went, she would have missed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got there just in time. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And he spoke to her in a way she had never been spoken to before. He spoke to the seed that was within her. Brother Brandham likes to dramatize the story and he tells us about how she sat on her mother's knee as a little girl and heard the mighty works and the exploits of a mighty God. Somebody ought to hear me. &gt;&gt; And it planted all these little seeds that mixed in with what God had represented in her from the beginning. And she starts building this desire for him. And she don't know what to do with it. She went to synagogue. It wasn't there. She went to what was going on in in the Samaritan worship and it it was nothing there and and she's just just just living life just barely getting by until she meets him. Brother Bram said, "What was he doing?" He was just contacting her spirit. He asked her all of these questions just trying to contact the inner part of who she was. And it was the sun, the s o n shining on the seed. And she said, "Come see a man." Oh yeah, there she goes. The flucy's running after another man. She said, "No, no, no. Not that kind of a man. It's not a new boyfriend. It's not a new bedmate. It's not a new lover that I'm advertising today. I want you to know, come see a man who told me everything that I've ever done. &gt;&gt; He knew all there was to know about me. But I could tell by the way he looked at me, he loved me. &gt;&gt; He saw past my sin. He saw past my mistake. He saw past number husband 1, two, three, four, and five. And living in a He saw past that. &gt;&gt; And he saw something in me. No wonder Mahalia Jackson was saying he went she went running running running running running running running running running &gt;&gt; cuz one running wasn't enough to express what this woman did. She ran through the whole town &gt;&gt; telling everybody come see a man. &gt;&gt; What if I told you that what God did in her that day, it's quite similar to the work that he's trying to work in us &gt;&gt; to make us his corporate Messiah in the earth to share his attributes. Let me finish this one. Uh, we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom. Like any wife is a part of her husband. Therefore, we must be the word bride. We must be the word bride. We must be the word bride. Not just because we feed on the word, but because the word is represented in us already. If the word is already represented in us, guess what? We're going to feed on. I can tell when someone's reading a scripture whether it's more like a book of poetry to them or living drops of living life &gt;&gt; living moving breathing God. You can tell when someone's reading a scripture whether it's foreign or whether it's who they are. &gt;&gt; The manifestation. What is the word bride? the manifestation of this hour, the bride, not a creed or denomination, but a living oracle of God. Do you know what it means to be a living oracle of God? Oracle is a word or one who speaks a word. A living oracle of God, a living attribute of God, displaying to the world. This is where I wanted to hone in, but I won't be able to do it this morning. But this is what I wanted to hone in on. Displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride. that's to be expressed in this hour that we're living in. And then this important last uh little paragraph, Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express. Did you know there's never been an hour where all the attributes could be expressed like this hour? Amen. &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen under Luther &gt;&gt; and it couldn't happen under Wesley &gt;&gt; and it couldn't even happen under the glossalia and exusia of Pentecost &gt;&gt; because the word was being restored. The word was being filled up again. But we live in the hour where the word has been &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say has been. &gt;&gt; Has been. &gt;&gt; The word has been restored. And because the word has been restored, we can not only express the attributes of this church age, but we have the grace to express the attributes of Christ that were sent to every one of the church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Which which puts us in the stature of the perfect man. The perfect the perfect one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Puts us in that process, in that building, in that adoption. but a living oracle of God, a living attribute of God, displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living. Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning, the resurrection, like the corn of wheat that went into the earth. And Wesley his age, he could not express beyond his age. and Pentecost could not express beyond its given and appointed time. I don't know what you believe, but I believe we're in the last of the last days. I believe if you're more comfortable warming a pew than displaying his attributes to a lost and dying world, &gt;&gt; I think that you're more like church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than you realize. &gt;&gt; And that's not the goal. The goal is to be like the husband. &gt;&gt; And if that's the case, this is what I was wanting to get to but didn't, but I will. If that's the case, then Mark 16 is not an option. Oh, you don't know Mark 16? This is on you. This extension is on you. It's your fault. Don't blame me. If your roast is burnt, don't blame me. Mark 16. You know, Scoffield went to jail. for having a second family. I know brother Brandham tells us over and over again that he used a Scoffield Bible, but I want you to know that a lot of people are way off track because they've been reading the footnotes instead of depending on the Holy Spirit. and he was not a good man. Don't do much research. You'll be really sad. Does that mean God couldn't use him? No, it doesn't. God could use him, but it certainly means I'm not going to take his interpretation of anything. &gt;&gt; All them notes that he wrote in the bottom, I'm not I'm not going to I'm not going to base my life on the fact that he's not sure whether or not Mark 16 is inspired or not. And when I first come around the message people, I heard them preaching from the pullpit that that this was we had no proof that this was inspired. Let me tell you how you prove anything. It it's in the it's the proving is is in the pudding. &gt;&gt; That's how you know if it's a decent pudding or not. You you taste it. &gt;&gt; And and let me ask you a question. Did the early church cast out devils in his name? Amen. &gt;&gt; Did they speak with new tongues? &gt;&gt; Did they take up serpents? They did. &gt;&gt; Did they drink any deadly thing? Yeah. And it didn't hurt them, right? &gt;&gt; And did they lay hands on the sick and they recover? &gt;&gt; It's inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because that's what they did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go tell John. It's real simple. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. &gt;&gt; He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." Amen. &gt;&gt; But he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs and these signs and these signs and these signs. &gt;&gt; This is what I've been wrestling with God about now for several months. And these signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; If you think that's plain, Brother Brandon was planer. He said if the signs don't follow you, you don't believe. &gt;&gt; Now, is that plain? And I'm wrestling with that because I don't see the signs following my life. &gt;&gt; That once followed my life &gt;&gt; and I want them. Not so I can say I got them. No. Or brag to somebody else that doesn't have them. But because I want to know that I know that I know that I know that I believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to know that unbelief has been ultimately completely and totally annihilated from my life. &gt;&gt; And I want to know that this little bride is in formation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, if it had never happened and I'd never seen it, I'd probably be as satisfied as some folks are today. But if you've ever laid hands on the sick and watch blind eyes open or deaf ears unstopp cancerous tumors fall off and roll across the floor. You ever saw God heal a back and a little girl come out of a back brace? There's a woman, there's a picture down there at the at the fellowship hall of a little black woman in a tent in South Carolina where we were preaching and they wheeled her in a wheelchair. On the way out, the spirit of God fell on her in in the tent. And on the way out, she was pushing her wheelchair &gt;&gt; and her family said, "We've not seen this. We don't even remember ever mama not being in a wheelchair. And here she's walking out pushing the wheelchair. Why? Because these signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; And once you've seen it and experienced it, you you want to know, Lord, what's wrong with me? &gt;&gt; What's wrong with me? &gt;&gt; So this is not just on you. This is on me. In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. I don't think this means uh we go to West Virginia and handle the rattlesnakes. I think this is the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; He took up the firewood and and a serpent came out of the sticks and bit him and and and he just my god, you know the war dance you do when a spider runs across the floor? Here's a man with a serpent latched onto his hand and he just shakes it off in the fire. He's not even afraid. But what he didn't know is the legend of the land said that there were going to be gods come to these people and they were going to have power over serpents. So I want you to know that in that moment he had a very captive audience. &gt;&gt; And that's why God does signs. He doesn't do them to entertain us. &gt;&gt; He does them because there's somebody he wants to reach. &gt;&gt; Now if you believe that all have been reached, then there's no need. If they drink any deadly thing, it doesn't say they're going to go around drinking strict nine instead of water, but it said if they do, it shall not hurt them, and they shall lay hands on the sick. I know of a time in my life where I saw more healed than not. If he ever did that, he still can. It seems like now that a real manifested healing is an instantaneous or miraculous healing is is by far the exception. But I know there was a time that it was the expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't mean to depress you, but I just want you to know it may be because we're not fully aware of what this is to be the corporate Messiah. I want us to get it. &gt;&gt; It's very important. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Thank you for your patience. It's been a little rough getting it out, but thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your patience. when I I mean I got so I've got three series going here at one time, but uh I want to finish the others if I live long enough. But before I'm done with this one, I want to talk about the transition between a Moses commission and a Joshua commission. And I think that a lot of the believers of this end time message are quite confused. I I I don't think they really fully understand that brother Brandham was commissioned in a Moses capacity from a cabin or a cave. And then later he was commissioned from Joshua chapter 1 for a portion of a Joshua commission. He could be a portion of a Moses commission and a portion of a Joshua commission. It's absolutely biblical for one one person to rise fulfilling portions of types, not entirety of types, but portions of types. But if brother Brandham was only commissioned with a portion a generation ago with a portion of the Joshua commission, then there has to be people somebody's &gt;&gt; who have a desire to understand the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; What's the second installment? Because we're not there yet. I know they try to say we're there, &gt;&gt; but this today looks awful lot like yesterday looked. &gt;&gt; Which looked a whole lot like the day before. &gt;&gt; To inherit means to inherit. &gt;&gt; To cross over means to cross over. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I'm not talking about the millennium." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm talking about the full powers of heaven &gt;&gt; invested in a little body of believers." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what I'm talking about is a promised land or a place of rest or a crossing over." So, there has to be a company because there's no room for a one-man ministry anymore because Moses was commissioned as one, and then 70 followed. &gt;&gt; Jesus won, 120 plus followed. So then as we come to an end of a one-man ministry era, it can't be one man again commissioned to finish the race of Moses, the commission, excuse me, the commission of Joshua. It has to be a many membered body. It's a corporate messiah. It's a corporate anointing. &gt;&gt; And it's not going to fall on people who don't want it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or who are not even concerned about it. &gt;&gt; It's only going to come to those who are willing to pursue it. &gt;&gt; And it's not an it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's a full manifestation of him. I got loved ones who need miracles. &gt;&gt; We lost one this week. But I I I'm not giving up on miracles. &gt;&gt; I've got loved ones who need miracles. Maybe you do. &gt;&gt; There are people in this room today that need miracles. There's people streaming this s. It's not all about miracles, not all about signs, not all about wonders. But he said, "If you are that, if you're that and that is in you, &gt;&gt; then the then the signs of Mark 16, &gt;&gt; it is necessary that they follow you where you go." &gt;&gt; And and I'm about to the place where if it can't go with me, I don't want to go. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; No wonder Moses said, "I don't even want to go if you're not going before me." &gt;&gt; Why do we go? We don't go to go. We go to demonstrate. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "These things are the demonstrations of the resurrection." And he said, "The bride church is called to be demonstrators of the resurrection of Christ." We go proving. We go proving that Christ is risen &gt;&gt; by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone tells you their heartache and you say, "Oh my, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry." You're not demonstrating the resurrection. You're demonstrating a sympathetic ear. You're demonstrating the resurrection when you say right out there in the frozen uh frozen uh department uh section, frozen section of Walmart and and you're hearing their sob story and you Yes. Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry. And you say, "How about we pray right now?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus is alive and well. Hebrews 13:8, Mark 16, &gt;&gt; proving himself in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you're demonstrating, &gt;&gt; the attributes of the resurrection. Bow your head with me just a moment. Father, I I've drugged this out. Um I it is my tendency. I can't deny. Uh but it comes from a desire &gt;&gt; not just to be heard. &gt;&gt; But it comes from a desire that you, oh Christ, living word, anointed one, that you would be manifested in all of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I don't mean on occasion like that anointing that comes and goes. I mean like the abiding occupying divine presence of God that lives inside of a believer. I want uh I want mas to have it and daddies to have it and I want children to operate in the glory. I've seen what happens when little children come under the power and to begin to lay hands on one another and begin to dream dreams and see angels and have experiences with God. I've seen what happens when when we can surrender and the pillar of fire comes among us not to be a entertainment but to be a an encouragement &gt;&gt; to keep displaying the works and attributes of the resurrection. I I just sense in my heart Lord that uh there's more that you want to show. there's more that you want to express. And uh I'm almost sometimes I feel sorry that that we're all you got. But you knew all of that when you let it wind up this way. When you let so many fall by the way and run in other directions and deny that Mark 16 is even inspired for this day. You knew what you were going to end up with at the end. and and we're part of that that rag tag army like David's chosen. And Lord, if you can use anything, you can use us. If you can make a donkey talk and an axe head swim, you can certainly use us. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I love there's so many things I wanted to share with the people today. All the many times you talked about the mistakes of Moses and how that they did not affect your love, your connection to Moses. just caused you to put more in a Joshua who could take them all the way. We were told that Moses represents the law. Your prophet preached that Joshua was grace. We can't uh take the promised land with only a Moses mentality. We've got to see the champion. We've got to see the Joshua champion. Lord, we are depending on you. While some strive to see just how phony they can be, there's a little bride in this earth who wants only the genuine. And some people use church like a opportunity to show off an outfit. But there are a people who really want to get the most out of every time we gather. Here we are today. Lord Jesus, would you let this truth go out over the airwaves today and reach uh candidates, reach reach potentials who are willing to let you take the preeminences in their life. In just a moment, would you fill up this altar for a few moments? worshippers who who recognize that if there's ever going to be a day, it's got to be now. If there's ever going to be a time, it's got to be now. If there's ever going to be a surrendered army, it's got to be us. It's got to be now. &gt;&gt; Would you just fill up the front of this place with those who just say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord." I hear them blasting on the Christian satellite radio the song sometime, uh, you just need a greater yes, Lord. I just want to be that greater yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; I want my yes to be a greater yes. &gt;&gt; Meaning a greater surrender. &gt;&gt; I want my neighbors changed. &gt;&gt; I want them to see the power of God that it is alive and well. That you have not diminished even in this hour of Satan's Eden. Your power, your authority, and your love for human mankind has not diminished. So we surrender precious Jesus in your name. There's nothing worth more that will ever come close. Nothing can compare. You're our living home.

Let us experience the glory of your good. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, you are &gt;&gt; here. Show him where &gt;&gt; this place. &gt;&gt; This place &gt;&gt; sitting in the living room. Fill this place &gt;&gt; riding down the highway. Fill this place over by your presence. the deepest reality of what we're sharing this morning. It may pass you by. It does many. They can't hear it. They can't see it. They can't feel a connection to it. But I believe the majority of people in this room are here because you've had a connection to it. If you wanted church as usual, you'd find you a 12:00 getting out church and that's where you'd plant yourself. I believe you're here not because this is just all perfect, but I believe you're here because you know the potential &gt;&gt; for God to show up is here. &gt;&gt; Because we're not going to keep him in a box to satisfy anybody's definition of what a message church is supposed to be. I don't care what it's supposed to be. I don't get my model from looking at the others. I get my model from that book. &gt;&gt; And it says these signs shall follow them that believe. And I don't believe it's just the preachers that he's talking to. I believe he's talking to believers. I believe mama ought to be able to pick up a fevered child and lay her arms, roll her arms around her baby and say, "In the name of Jesus Christ, go to the root of this infirmity and take your hands off of my child." &gt;&gt; Nobody even knows. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make it to the magazine. It's not in the headlines. But God is glorified &gt;&gt; because somebody took him at his word. Don't you want to be that kind of mama? Don't you want to be that kind of person? You don't have Listen. Listen. &gt;&gt; If you're still a person that has to be credited and thanked &gt;&gt; for everything you do, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; You're not going anywhere in the spirit. &gt;&gt; And there's a part of that alive in most all of us. &gt;&gt; I said us. &gt;&gt; We say we don't need it, but we're human. And there's a part of us that wants that little bit of acknowledgement for what we did. &gt;&gt; And when we get locked in that mode, we'll never be able to operate Mark 16 the way we're ordained to do it. &gt;&gt; Because those believers have signs following them. And it becomes not common in the sense of unsacred, but common in the sense of another typical day in the life of a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you're in that mode, you can do it. You don't have to tell everybody at church about it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to put it on Facebook. &gt;&gt; You can if you feel like you should. But all you need is for the Lord to know, &gt;&gt; I've put my faith in action today and you've moved. &gt;&gt; If you're doing it to build yourself a little ministry or to build some little reputation, you'll just stay right where you are. But if you just want to make him famous, &gt;&gt; Lord, I just want your name to be famous again. &gt;&gt; I want people to know that it's not a just a dryeyed kind of relationship, but there's a people alive with your presence &gt;&gt; in these last days. I feel really good right now. Felt felt a little weary a few minutes ago, but I feel really good right now because I believe somebody's faith is reaching up to him. I just want to quickly say this before we before we move, and that is this. If you're one of those persons like my dad who just kept trying to fill the void. [Music] You see it all the time. You see you see people in town. Wasn't enough to have two or three in each ear. Then they then they got to put one in their lip and they got to put one in their nose and they got to put one in their I'm so sorry. It nauseates me not because of the way it looks but because of how it represents such a bondage in slavery. and one one tattoo, one that is not enough. And they just have to keep on and on and on. It gets higher up the neck. And it just it breaks my heart because I recognize they're just looking for acceptance. They're looking for validation and they just need to meet a a Mark 16 bunch of people &gt;&gt; who don't care about all that &gt;&gt; who just want to show them Jesus &gt;&gt; not with words &gt;&gt; but with evidences of the resurrection. If you're here today or you're listening to this service, watching this service, and you're one who keeps trying to fill life with a bigger bigger house or a faster car or for crying out loud, a grown man racing little go-karts. Nothing wrong with any of that perhaps, but it don't satisfy for very long. &gt;&gt; I want you to know there is something that satisfies. There's someone that'll satisfy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While while we're not looking around, if there's anybody that says, "I really need him to come and fill up every empty spot in my life." You just slip up your hand. I've still got some empty places. God bless every hand in the room. Every hand in the room. I've still got empty places that I need him to come. Lord, I'm asking you right now with the seriousness of faith. You saw every hand that went up and and and it just simply said, "I've got some empty spots that I need Jesus to come and fill. I've tried to fill them with other things." Lord, this is your invitation. &gt;&gt; If they really meant it, you know it. You know their heart. And I'm asking you to encounter them, Lord. Not just in this moment, but in this week and moving forward. come and take up th those slack places and fill empty spots and and longing voids for validation and acceptance. Come and fill up those spots &gt;&gt; until we can be whole again. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're coming for a whole people. You sent your word to complete a people. &gt;&gt; Fill up all those little places in us &gt;&gt; with more of who you are. We surrender right now. We surrender. We surrender. We surrender. We surrender to you right now. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, you're welcome to come and take full possession occupation of every want, every desire of our lives even now. Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jesus, Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're the healer. come and heal. Come right now and heal bodies. Heal bodies. &gt;&gt; Restore bodies in the name of Jesus Christ. Let peace return all that has come to disturb. Let your peace come and reign and rule in our hearts. &gt;&gt; More than life itself, we want your perfect will in the name of Jesus Christ. for just a moment. If you feel it's appropriate, touch the person next to you. Father, you see the need. I don't have to know what the need is to know that you're a big enough God. There are enough promises in your word to meet that need. I believe there's no better way to approach it than the prayers of the saints, the faith of of people who love. I ask you right now, Jesus. Come and be Jesus. Maybe there's a broken heart here. Come and be Jesus. Come and be Jesus. Come and take up all the slack. Fill every empty spot. Sweep out every corner. Remove every cobweb. Come and occupy with light. Your light. Your light. Come and fill up every every little spot as only you can. Jesus. Holy Spirit, you are welcome. Come place and fill the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your glory, God is what our hearts long for. to be overcome by your presence. Lord, Holy Spirit, you are welcome here. Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere. Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for. To be overcome [Music] by your presence, Lord, [Music] your presence, Lord. [Music] And there's more. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just turn to somebody, &gt;&gt; express some love quickly, hug a neck, shake a hand, you're our living home. &gt;&gt; We have a baby dedication. &gt;&gt; Your presence, Lord. Cuz I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of love. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; If you have to go, we understand. &gt;&gt; But we have some twins that we want to hand back to the Lord. for his use. Praise God. Let's go ahead and and get them up this way and let the family come. We'll bring a mic down. Somebody, would you just be seated a moment if you if you have to go? I don't want to I don't want to hold you longer, but it was about to be real long because we had uh we Hey, darling. We were going to have three babies to dedicate today, but uh some are missing from the from little Abel's family that they really wanted to be here and his was scheduled today. And then it just worked out that everybody could be here. This is my assistant. You see her here. And uh so we get to do a double double decker double duty here. And we're very thankful. So thankful. Uh there was a bit of a bit of a tragedy in Sister Laurel's family this week with a little baby and it really really really pricricked my heart because I was thinking, you know, to have a little baby born and then it go through so many things and then and then leave after mom and dad have stood over it and hoped and prayed. That's hard, folks, isn't it? And the reason why I bring it up at such a happy time is simply because after I, you know, just cried out to God to comfort the family, to please wrap your arms, Lord, around them, my next thought was was Luke and Megan and how they diligently watched over that little fellow in that incubator or not incubator, sorry, I know better than that. Life support really. um the light and the and the for a while the breathing and the feeding and all all critical but God worked a miracle. I thought how terrible it would have been at the end of that if they had only brought one home. But the marvelous grace of God, that redemption that he promised, he really meant it. He meant he was going to do it and he did it double. And we have today Hadasa Joy. Is that right? And Isaac Luke, is that right? Well, I had a little help. Uh, I'm gonna try. Let's see. My grandmother was a twin, so I ought to be able to hold twins, right? Does that Does that mean anything? Okay, now Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, we don't want it. Oh my goodness. This is my first start grunting now. They don't want to see the backs of y'all. Look at this. Oh, that's a lot of diapers. We need to pray. Don't you think one of them ought to favor Megan a little bit? Little more. Do they both have to be Yovich's? It's Luke. But I tell you, man, it's really I see granddaddy. Nothing wrong with that. But at least the girl you you ought to at least work on looking like mama a little more. Ain't this amazing? Did you get me? Did you get all them in the background? Are y'all smiling now? It's It's almost like you're just holding one, though. weightwise. Oh, thank you, Lord. Let's pray. Father, our hearts are so grateful today. You've got such a big plan and we are so thankful that you're always right. You never make a mistake. Everything you do is perfect, including these precious little gifts of life. Lord, thank you for bringing our precious little brother. Thank you for bringing him through. Lord, thank you for strengthening his lungs. Thank you, Father, for taking care of everything that needed to be took care of for both of them and letting them come home where they needed to be. And thank you, Lord. They they've sure been to your house a lot already. And Father, we just pray today that you will protect them. Uh there's so much going around these days uh sickness and virus and everything. Lord, would you just put a great protection around them, Jesus? &gt;&gt; I pray Lord that you would do that and bring greater strength to their bodies. said, "I pray Lord that if you should tarry long enough that they would have a desire for you like their brothers and like their brother and sisters, Lord, to to read your word and to learn of you like their older siblings do. I pray, oh God, that it just fall right on them and that their desire would be toward you. May they be praisers, too. May they be worshippers, too. May they bring joy to every member of this beautiful extended family across the front of this church. Lord, would you just bless them in every way? Daddy is the only one that can give them back to you. But but Lord, we stand behind him and we stand behind mama and we pray Lord that you will provide for them their every need so that they can be everything that you have called them to be to all of these beautiful children that you've given them. And Lord, we all give them a hard time picking at them. But the reality is, I can't speak for anybody but myself, but I admire them and I I respect them for the way that they look after these children. I respect Luke as a as a real dad to his to his children. I appreciate that so much. And Megan is a real mom. And Lord, we just thank you for this opportunity to stop and tell you how much we love you and how much we thank you for these little gifts. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. May they be peaceful like this a bunch. A lot. Especially when Pat Peps around. That's amazing. Look at them. Well, I guess we need to move on. I don't know about handing them off. I don't even know if I can do it. We're sorry we're disturbing your lives here. Let me get you. Oh, you got it. &gt;&gt; Okay, Daddy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Dear Lord, we just thank you for these two. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Isaac and Hadassa. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just thank you for giving them to us and answering prayers and comfort. &gt;&gt; Being with us. So much has changed. So, we've come so far, &gt;&gt; Lord. Just want to give them back to you, Lord. just be in each one of their lives. Comfort them and lead and direct and guide them throughout each day. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help them to walk in your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Help us to walk in your perfect will, Lord. Just give us the strength to bring them up and to show them who you are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just speak through them. Speak through us. &gt;&gt; To them, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Just thank you for them. Just give us strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, all of y'all, this big, beautiful family, turn around and let the church see all of you. I don't think these uh babies will lack for love or attention or somebody to hold them. I I hope there'll be as many volunteers when it's time to change diapers. Isn't that an amazing What a gift. Hallelujah. [Applause] aunts and uncles and cousins and grandmothers, grandfathers and great uncles and great ants and they're blessed. They're blessed. They're blessed. God bless all of you. Praise the Lord.
