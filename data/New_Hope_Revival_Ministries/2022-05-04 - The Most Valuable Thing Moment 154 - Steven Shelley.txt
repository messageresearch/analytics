Description:
We as the Bride of Jesus Christ are very valuable to Him. When we meet our Bridegroom, we are not dressed in her own robes, but in robes of His righteousness. With joy we drink at the very Fountain of Life, the wells of joy.  When we make joy our demonstration, the Lord will show up and our enemy shall be put to shame.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the most valuable thing in all the earth today is the little bride of jesus christ wherever she is everything that is in god he has poured into her you tell me if she's valuable she may not be perfect in herself but she's not meeting the bridegroom in her own clothes she's meeting him dressed in robes of his righteousness and covered with the cloaks of salvation hallelujah she's not getting her water out of a broken cistern either she's down there drawing up water hallelujah they're far with joy shall ye draw waters from the well the wells of salvation she's getting her joy from her source he is yeshua which means salvation the wells of yeshua the wells of salvation that's where our joy comes from but it doesn't always fall on us automatically therefore with joy shall they draw water from with joy with joy when you make joy your demonstration the lord will show up but when he shows up at the appearing of your joy he will turn this thing around and your enemy shall be put to shame now i want you to know if there's no other reason to wear joy if there's no other reason to display joy that could possibly be a pretty good reason because when the lord shows up and he's not showing up because your enemy is sending him he's showing up because you are choosing to keep your heart right and you're choosing to keep your focus turned in his direction and when your joy begins to come forth anyhow any who when your joy begins to move forth he will come he will come to your joy he will appear to your joy and when he does those enemies who plotted against you they shall be put to shame now you tell me if joy ought to be tucked in your pocket no you ought to wear it around your neck
