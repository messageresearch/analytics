TRANSCRIPT
========================================
perhaps the word of the Lord for where you are right now you're going to keep falling again and again and again you're going to have the wind knocked out of you again and again and again until you discover what's growing in your garden until you discover what's coming into your heart what you have allowed to grow in your inner man I if I were to ask you the question which is the most important part of who we are outer man or inner man of course it's the inner man because it's out of the inner man that everything else flows IT issues forth but I want you to know that even in a world gone wild even in Satan's Eden there is a place of safety there is a place of rest there is a place of pleasure and of delight and it is in Christ and it is only in Christ and it's not being in Christ in word only or or in in language that comes out of our mouth but it's really when the rubber meets the road that we can testify I'm so hidden in Christ that the waves are not going to take me out I'm I'm anchored to the Rock of Ages I'm planted myself in a place of rest in a place of pleasure in a place of delight so come what may I know who's I am you've just got to guard your heart and you can't guard it until you clean it you've got to discover what it is that's growing in your heart that's causing you not to be able to get over the wall well I need to pray more you do I need to read the Bible more you do I need to hear the message more you do but above all else you better put a Watchman on the wall of your heart because your mind will and emotions is where the enemy is going to fight you day in and day out it's not your enemy it's only the arena it's only the venue where the battle rages but blessed be the name of the Lord It's where the battle rages that the victory is born it's where the battle is Raging that Jesus the Victor can come and be Lord he wants to be Lord he wants to be your leader remember there is an overcoming bride that is being raised up in this hour it doesn't matter how many give up it doesn't matter how many lay down there's going to be some that refuse to give up because they have recognized by Revelation the reason why they were born most of the time we already have the leading of what we know we should do what we're supposed to do what God is expecting out of us but we're hoping that someone might tell us something else so that we can lay our options out let me tell you something you don't have any options other than the perfect will of God for your life you were born for a purpose for a reason and that's the only option you have Above All Else guard your heart because it's out of your heart that your life happens am
