Description:
Compromise creeps in quietly, weighing us down beneath burdens we were never meant to carry alone. But the Spirit of the Lord lifts us from beneath the load, transforms our perspective, and turns hopelessness into hope. Whatever you need today—fortress, refuge, shelter—He has already made a way.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, WE'VE GOT OFF TRACK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Compromise is what got us here. &gt;&gt; And when we find ourselves slippery, slipping on that uh path of compromise, the next thing you know, the enemy can hold us back, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Distract us and keep us from walking in the victory. Even though the Holy Ghost is here waiting on us to yield and let him roar, &gt;&gt; but something will weigh you down before you go to bed tonight most likely. &gt;&gt; And you've GOT A CHOICE. YOU CAN WALLOW there in the weight OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION. AND JUST BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT GOD MAKING A WAY OUT DOESN'T MEAN that it's not a real problem you're facing. It could be urgent. IT COULD BE CRITICAL. IT COULD BE LIFE OR DEATH. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER how difficult it is or how easy it would be for somebody else to handle it when it's yours. &gt;&gt; It's personal &gt;&gt; and all of our emotions get around it &gt;&gt; AND WE FILTER EVERYTHING THROUGH THAT PROBLEM. DON'T underestimate &gt;&gt; how the spirit of the Lord can lift you out from beneath the burden, &gt;&gt; change your perspective, &gt;&gt; make you less hopeless &gt;&gt; and more hopeful. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A WAY OUT. &gt;&gt; GOD MAKES A WAY OUT. HE MAKES A WAY OF ESCAPE FROM EVERY TEMPTATION, from every trial, from every burden. Before he lays it on our life, he has already provided a way to get us out from under the load when it has accomplished what it was sent to accomplish in our lives. The fortress is where we go when the battle's raging and we need to stop the arrows. Amen. &gt;&gt; The refuge is where we run when we are in trouble and when we need a papa to lean on and we need some feathers to cover us and some uh everlasting arms to come beneath us and wings to draw us close. Whatever we have need of, the spirit of the Lord has it.
