[48:28] Praise Jesus
[48:32] Hallelujah we were on our way and we
[48:36] probably like 2 and 1 half hours away or
[48:39] something on that line when uh going
[48:42] down the street the front wheel hit the
[48:45] curb on the side because of it hit it I
[48:48] guess and so we got out of there and
[48:52] we're kept moving we're a little
[48:53] concerned about the wheel and the tire
[48:55] and so Force but it seemed okay until
[48:57] maybe 15 to 30 minutes later the light
[49:00] blinged on the car and uh Andy saw the
[49:04] transmission went out so we pulled to
[49:07] the side and then uh we didn't stop the
[49:10] engine he discovered that he had a had
[49:14] the uh he still had low gear so we kept
[49:17] going down the road at probably 25 miles
[49:19] an hour for a while and started calling
[49:23] around to try to figure out how we can
[49:26] rent a car and all the stuff and uh Andy
[49:29] hasn't been driving very long we're not
[49:31] very experienced with knowing what to do
[49:33] about these
[49:34] things but we were praying and we called
[49:37] the brothers here and they were praying
[49:39] and then all of a sudden brother Chie
[49:42] said well let's just pull off to the
[49:44] side here beside this semi-trailer and
[49:47] we pulled in there and then chess said
[49:48] just stop that engine we've been
[49:50] overrunning it for a while let's just
[49:52] let it cool down a little bit and we
[49:54] were calling around to get a car rle and
[49:56] then we decided where we were going to
[49:58] go and pulled out of there and
[49:59] everything was completely healed and
[50:01] normal and the car is fixed praise
[50:04] God oh praise the
[50:08] Lord
[50:11] [Applause]
[50:24] hallelujah
[50:27] it's said about our PR that it's
[50:32] disgraceful distasteful said about our
[50:36] praise that we're putting on a show well
[50:40] just maybe you don't know or you've
[50:44] never had the chance to hear just where
[50:47] we've been to know where we came
[50:52] from cuz if you'd seen the change I wore
[50:56] and how heavy they were then you might
[51:01] understand why I act the way I do and if
[51:06] you'd been there when he found me it
[51:09] would all make sense when Grace came to
[51:13] rescue me from my life of sin I know
[51:19] what it feels like to be bound up in
[51:23] Chains so now I I appreciate what
[51:27] freedom feels like that's why I shout
[51:31] why I dance Why I Praise like I do
[51:36] because he who the sun sets free is free
[51:40] indeed that's why I sing why I run why I
[51:45] have to give my all cuz Jesus Paid the
[51:50] price so I didn't have to stay lost he
[51:54] delivered me he set me free he Sav my
[51:59] soul that's
[52:03] why that's why I praise like I
[52:12] do so if you wonder why I am this way
[52:17] let me
[52:19] explain my whole life changed the day
[52:23] that Jesus walked in he gave me Beauty
[52:27] for Ashes the oil of joy for
[52:31] morning replace my heavy spirit with the
[52:36] Garment of Praise I know what it feels
[52:41] like to be bound up in Chains so now I
[52:47] appreciate what freom feels like that's
[52:51] why I shout why I dance why I I praise
[52:56] like I do because he who the sun sets
[53:01] free is free inde that's why I sing why

[53:15] stay lost he delivered me he set me free
[53:21] he saved my soul that's why
[53:27] that's why I praise like I
[53:35] do cuz if you'd seen the chains I wore
[53:40] and how heavy they
[53:43] were then you might understand why I act
[53:48] the way I do and if you'd been there
[53:51] when you found me it would all makes
[53:56] sense when Grace came to rescue me from
[54:00] my life of

[1:03:57] of what God's done for
[1:04:00] me and I I I'll try to make it very
[1:04:05] quick yeah but I know but the word takes
[1:04:09] preeminence
[1:04:14] amen many of you have have seen I'm sure
[1:04:19] well maybe some of you have seen the
[1:04:22] testimony that Heather gave on Facebook
[1:04:26] regarding little milela our little baby
[1:04:29] girl that's on the
[1:04:31] way that's an entire miracle in and of
[1:04:35] itself that the doctor said would never
[1:04:39] happen we don't listen to the report
[1:04:41] that the doctors
[1:04:42] give my God gives a much better report
[1:04:46] than what the doctors could ever
[1:04:50] give so God blessed us with this
[1:04:53] pregnancy
[1:04:55] and as as the as they do about Midway
[1:04:58] through the pregnancy about 20 weeks
[1:05:00] they do an ultrasound to check on the
[1:05:03] baby's growth make sure everything is is
[1:05:05] growing right and doing right we went
[1:05:08] into that ultrasound room with the
[1:05:12] expectation that everything was going to
[1:05:14] be
[1:05:15] perfect and the lady that was doing all
[1:05:17] the checking she just kept making good
[1:05:19] comments everything oh this looks good
[1:05:21] this looks good this looks good so then
[1:05:22] we go into the office to speak to the
[1:05:25] doctor and he comes in and he's like um
[1:05:29] so uh did the technician say anything
[1:05:32] we're like oh yeah she just said every
[1:05:34] everything looked really good he said oh
[1:05:35] yeah everything looks really good
[1:05:37] but I don't like hearing a doctor say
[1:05:40] but when they're reviewing something he
[1:05:42] says we didn't notice one little thing
[1:05:46] that she only has a two vessel umbilical
[1:05:49] Cordon if you know anything
[1:05:52] about life how it grows there supposed
[1:05:54] to be a three vessel I wonder what it is
[1:05:57] about three there should be three
[1:06:01] vessels for the cord for the for the
[1:06:03] correct proper growth and they said well
[1:06:06] we've checked we've checked checked all
[1:06:08] the things and she only has two and we
[1:06:11] want to just let you know that because
[1:06:13] she only has a two vessel cord here's a
[1:06:15] whole list of things that
[1:06:19] potentially could be might be possibly
[1:06:24] wrong when she's born and you may need
[1:06:27] to make some decisions about that I'm
[1:06:29] like well number one there's no decision
[1:06:31] I need to make about anything the baby's
[1:06:33] not born yet and I said and two we're
[1:06:37] going to take it to the Lord in
[1:06:40] prayer beautiful we're going to take it
[1:06:43] to God In Prayer I I said I appreciate
[1:06:45] all that you guys have done thank you
[1:06:48] for for the work that you are able to do
[1:06:50] and what you can see and we have we have
[1:06:53] a picture where of where they did the
[1:06:55] sonogram and the the ultrasound and they
[1:06:58] they shows a two vessel cord they said
[1:07:00] we're going to schedule you in a few
[1:07:02] weeks to go to a um a specialist that
[1:07:07] they can check even better than we can
[1:07:09] check they can and they they were
[1:07:12] wanting to look to see if there's any
[1:07:14] abnormalities things that would show any
[1:07:16] signs of anything else and we know that
[1:07:20] place um in our area they're very well
[1:07:22] known for they would just as soon talk
[1:07:25] to you about aborting a baby than they
[1:07:27] would of you bringing a baby to full
[1:07:30] term so all that's in our mind already
[1:07:32] I'm like I I really don't like that
[1:07:35] atmosphere I don't want to talk to them
[1:07:36] but we'll go but we went to our went to
[1:07:39] the church first and we prayed had our
[1:07:42] church pray put out a prayer request
[1:07:45] across Facebook and different different
[1:07:47] places and many people joined in prayer
[1:07:50] with us you guys even joined in prayer
[1:07:53] with with us so fast forward 3 and 1/2
[1:07:58] weeks from the the first ultrasound we
[1:08:02] go to mayck and they go in and the lady
[1:08:05] starts checking everything out and she's
[1:08:08] doing all the checks and she's like oh
[1:08:10] the you know the skull looks good hands
[1:08:13] look good feet look good and we're like
[1:08:15] we want to hear about the cord that's
[1:08:18] what I want to hear and so the lady
[1:08:20] she's checking checking checking and she
[1:08:22] says now your chart says that you're
[1:08:24] here because they saw a two vessel cord
[1:08:28] W wowow we're like correct and we here's
[1:08:30] the here we have the picture they the
[1:08:33] doctors have it which we have a copy of
[1:08:34] it now and she said well that's what's
[1:08:38] funny she
[1:08:40] because I don't see a two vessel cord
[1:08:43] there's clearly a three vessel
[1:08:47] cord that's my
[1:08:52] God that's my
[1:08:56] [Applause]
[1:08:58] God people want to refer to a god that
[1:09:01] happened 200000 years
[1:09:03] ago it's the same
[1:09:05] God it ain't a different
[1:09:08] God I don't care what the doctors say I
[1:09:11] don't care what the need is that you
[1:09:13] have you take it to him you take him to
[1:09:17] his word where he has given you a
[1:09:19] promise you hold on to the promise you
[1:09:21] raise it up to him and say father you
[1:09:24] told me that this is what I could have
[1:09:27] by your stripes mil was
[1:09:31] healed so we went
[1:09:33] back to the first
[1:09:37] doctor this past
[1:09:40] week and Heather tells
[1:09:43] them we have a little
[1:09:45] change since the last time we were
[1:09:49] here because the other
[1:09:52] specialist has declared Mila is perfect
[1:09:57] and that she has a three vessel cord and
[1:09:59] they're like but our print shows and
[1:10:02] they pulled it up back on the screen
[1:10:04] pulled it up for and we we pulled a
[1:10:06] print out but it shows here and they're
[1:10:07] like was there any way that we can get a
[1:10:09] copy of of what they saw
[1:10:12] sure it's in it's in the documents you
[1:10:15] can get it they're like well that's just
[1:10:17] amazing we'll just have to look at that
[1:10:19] I'm like you can look at it all you want
[1:10:21] to because that's what my God
[1:10:26] does the God that I serve is alive he is

[1:28:36] evening I uh am here on
[1:28:40] assignment and I want you to help me
[1:28:43] because I'm going to do a little
[1:28:45] teaching not being a teacher then you're
[1:28:47] really out of like brother said last
[1:28:49] night he was teaching but really that
[1:28:52] was I I I think there's got to be a word
[1:28:55] for that that that was teaching and a
[1:28:59] whole lot of preaching all
[1:29:03] combined seemed like I made up a word
[1:29:06] one time but that was so many years ago
[1:29:07] I forgot it but uh I am going to give
[1:29:13] the devil a black
[1:29:16] eye and uh I want you to know before you
[1:29:19] hear this that uh I am speaking to the
[1:29:24] Believers that are gathered here
[1:29:27] especially to the New Hope Revival
[1:29:29] Ministry
[1:29:31] people uh if you're streaming this I
[1:29:33] hope you will hear it and take it and uh
[1:29:37] consult your pastor about it and uh make
[1:29:40] sure that it is the order for your
[1:29:44] house I am not responsible for any
[1:29:49] church or the conduct of the church
[1:29:51] Church except this one that's right I
[1:29:55] believe that we are not a part of a
[1:29:58] denomination uh we are not a part of the
[1:30:02] voice of God play press play and Obey
[1:30:07] movement uh we are Bible
[1:30:11] Believers and we are so grateful and so
[1:30:14] thankful that God H has sent a
[1:30:17] prophet to tie together the loose end
[1:30:23] of all of the church
[1:30:25] ages um we don't know how you can call
[1:30:30] individual churches message churches
[1:30:33] without somehow forming some kind of a
[1:30:35] denominational idea so we don't really
[1:30:38] want to be a part of that we honor
[1:30:41] brother brandham with everything we've
[1:30:43] got but we we try to honor him by living
[1:30:47] the kind of life he preached about and
[1:30:50] we don't feel like we have to hang up
[1:30:52] his picture in here for you to remember
[1:30:54] who he
[1:30:55] is we feel like that when we come here
[1:30:58] we need to uh focus and concentrate on
[1:31:02] the one that he came to help us fall in

[1:36:43] restore to them something that has been
[1:36:47] taken away from some of them I want them
[1:36:51] to understand that you have given us the
[1:36:56] gift of praying in the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:00] that we should take advantage of it
[1:37:03] every opportunity that we get it is to
[1:37:07] build up our faith it is to build up our
[1:37:12] courage it is to take us to higher

[1:37:20] we need your help tonight to deliver
[1:37:22] this mandate strengthen your people I
[1:37:26] pray let your servant get out of the way
[1:37:30] and accomplish your will in the name of
[1:37:34] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:37:37] saint said you may be seated man is a
[1:37:45] spirit man is a spirit who has a
[1:37:50] soul
[1:37:52] I know I know I don't have time to
[1:37:56] ground that to apologize for believing
[1:37:59] that I don't have time for that tonight
[1:38:02] but man is a spirit who has been given a
[1:38:07] soul mind will and emotions and he
[1:38:12] happens to live in a physical body but
[1:38:16] he is first and foremost spirit because
[1:38:20] it took Spirit to give him the living
[1:38:24] Soul the Breath of God the ruak kodesh
[1:38:28] the very
[1:38:30] lifegiving Spirit of almighty God was
[1:38:34] breathed into a body of Flesh and God
[1:38:38] gave him Connection by his five senses
[1:38:41] to the environment around him but not
[1:38:45] only does your body have five senses
[1:38:48] that lead to the mind and the will and
[1:38:50] the emotions but even your spirit has
[1:38:54] been given senses that you might connect
[1:38:57] to the holy spirit of God Proverbs 20:27
[1:39:02] says the spirit of man is the candle of
[1:39:07] the Lord searching all the inward parts
[1:39:12] of the belly do you believe that the
[1:39:16] spirit of man is the candle of the Lord
[1:39:21] searching all the inward parts of the
[1:39:24] belly that word belly means the
[1:39:26] innermost being it means the inner parts
[1:39:30] it means the inside of the inside it
[1:39:33] means your
[1:39:35] heart in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23 he
[1:39:41] said and the Very God of Peace sanctify
[1:39:45] you holy and I pray God your whole
[1:39:50] spirit
[1:39:51] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:39:57] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:01] brother brandham said I I cannot preach
[1:40:04] anything other than what the first
[1:40:07] church age messenger preached if he
[1:40:10] preached it that way I have to also
[1:40:12] preach it that way do you believe that
[1:40:15] there wasn't a new message for Leo
[1:40:18] deia there wasn't a new message for the
[1:40:20] last Church age it was actually the same
[1:40:23] message it was the tishbite anointing of
[1:40:26] weaving together all the lcins of all
[1:40:29] the other six Church ages brother
[1:40:32] brandom said that seventh angel he
[1:40:34] doesn't have a message of his
[1:40:37] own his job is to take everything back
[1:40:40] to the
[1:40:41] word if you let this message fit in the
[1:40:45] word you'll have a foundation to stand
[1:40:47] on if you can't take it back to the word
[1:40:51] you better leave it
[1:40:54] alone because the prophet told us that
[1:40:57] the word of God is the
[1:41:00] absolute you don't ever hear him saying
[1:41:03] like I said the other
[1:41:06] day when I was preaching the other day
[1:41:08] you know I told you such and such and
[1:41:10] such this is what a lot of us do but he
[1:41:12] very seldomly quoted
[1:41:15] himself what did he quote more than
[1:41:18] anything else the word the absolute the
[1:41:21] Bible so anything that we hear we have
[1:41:24] to take it back to the Bible nothing
[1:41:27] else stands alone is anybody with me
[1:41:30] tonight don't get too
[1:41:32] nervous we'll leave a few sacred cows
[1:41:36] upright we won't kick them all down
[1:41:38] tonight but we're going to work on a few
[1:41:40] of them all right because I'm pretty mad
[1:41:43] you know I don't get too mad too often
[1:41:46] but I'm pretty mad at the Devil because
[1:41:49] I believe that he has has taken
[1:41:51] something away from
[1:41:54] you brother mentioned the song the other
[1:41:56] night I'm going to the enemy's
[1:41:58] Camp some of you when you first got the
[1:42:01] Holy Ghost you prayed in the
[1:42:03] spirit you'd start praying in English
[1:42:06] and all of a sudden the spirit of the
[1:42:08] Lord would start directing your prayer
[1:42:11] and you started praying still in English
[1:42:13] but prophetically inspired LED of the
[1:42:17] Holy Spirit prayers how many of you know
[1:42:21] they're the most
[1:42:22] effectual those that are that are Spirit
[1:42:26] breathed sometimes we come up with a
[1:42:28] gimme gimme list sometimes we treat God
[1:42:31] like Santa
[1:42:33] Claus we just say here's what I want
[1:42:36] this is my want list but you start
[1:42:38] praying in the spirit it doesn't have to
[1:42:41] always be in another
[1:42:46] language but it's all right if it
[1:42:49] is am anybody with me I'm going to tell
[1:42:53] you something I truly believe that if
[1:42:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ would fight
[1:42:58] her way back to the privilege of praying
[1:43:01] in the Holy Ghost I believe we could
[1:43:04] move more Mountains than we've been
[1:43:05] moving these last few
[1:43:07] years I think if we could get to the
[1:43:09] place where we're no longer afraid of
[1:43:11] spirit-led
[1:43:12] things and even if it means a language
[1:43:15] that we never
[1:43:16] learned but we started praying and the
[1:43:19] spirit of God be to give us a groaning
[1:43:22] or begins to give us a
[1:43:28] sound I I don't know how to explain it
[1:43:31] sometime intercession takes on so many
[1:43:34] different uh uh
[1:43:36] aspects and and you come around here
[1:43:38] when the spirit of God's moving you'll
[1:43:40] hear all kinds of thing oh somebody said
[1:43:44] oh somebody said
[1:43:49] Woo
[1:43:51] true we had a brother come here years
[1:43:52] ago from South Africa and he came to the
[1:43:56] first camp meeting that we ever had
[1:43:58] story too long to tell but you know what
[1:44:00] he'd do all the time when the spirit of
[1:44:02] God would move on him he'd say show
[1:44:05] brother show
[1:44:08] sister you know we don't understand that
[1:44:11] sometime we scratch our heads and we
[1:44:13] look at other people funny when they
[1:44:16] worship a little differently than we do
[1:44:18] or when they respond to the spirit of
[1:44:20] God a little different than we do but I
[1:44:22] want to tell you something it's time we
[1:44:24] find how to
[1:44:26] respond yours doesn't have to look like
[1:44:28] mine mine doesn't have to look like
[1:44:30] yours but we better get in some Holy
[1:44:33] Ghost prayer meetings now where the
[1:44:36] spirit of God begins to direct the
[1:44:39] priorities of
[1:44:42] prayer the directives of prayer should
[1:44:46] not be flesh Le not even soul Le should
[1:44:50] be led by the spirit because the Bible
[1:44:54] said in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 I hope
[1:44:56] you can stand the rest of this 1
[1:44:59] Corinthians chapter 6:1 17 said but he
[1:45:02] that is joined unto the
[1:45:06] Lord is now one
[1:45:09] Spirit wo your
[1:45:12] Fallen
[1:45:14] Spirit has now been
[1:45:17] redeemed when you have you know the new
[1:45:20] birth is not complete until the baptism
[1:45:23] of the Holy
[1:45:26] Ghost some people think they're saved
[1:45:28] because they've repented and they think
[1:45:30] that is being born again or they get a
[1:45:32] little sanctification working in their
[1:45:34] life they call that the new birth but
[1:45:36] we've been taught from the word and the
[1:45:39] message of the hour that the new birth
[1:45:41] is not complete until you receive the
[1:45:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost then why AR
[1:45:46] people knocking folks down to get up
[1:45:49] here and get the Holy
[1:45:52] Ghost you've got to have
[1:45:55] it they're still arguing over whether or
[1:45:58] not that you need the Holy Ghost uh to
[1:46:00] to get to heaven or to go in Rapture
[1:46:02] brother that's no question there's no
[1:46:05] question there you need him to go to
[1:46:09] Walmart you need him to get behind the
[1:46:12] wheel of an
[1:46:13] automobile and meet all the demons
[1:46:16] behind the
[1:46:17] wheel come on you need him we need him
[1:46:21] we've got to have him and once we
[1:46:24] receive the Holy Ghost he didn't just
[1:46:26] come to give us a
[1:46:28] feeling he didn't just come to give us a
[1:46:30] goosebump or an emotion he came to equip
[1:46:35] us to fight the F greatest battle ever
[1:46:40] fought which is a battle of the mind and
[1:46:44] I'm here to tell you that I believe the
[1:46:47] best way to win that battle is to pray
[1:46:50] in the Holy
[1:46:53] Ghost it's not a selfish prayer when
[1:46:57] this I know my voice sounds
[1:46:59] terrible it's not a selfish prayer when
[1:47:03] the Holy Spirit is directing the
[1:47:06] prayer I don't want you to throw out any
[1:47:08] option it might be in
[1:47:11] English it might be a
[1:47:14] [Applause]
[1:47:15] sound right I long to hear the groanings
[1:47:19] I'll give you the verses
[1:47:21] I long to hear the groanings of the
[1:47:24] spirit I long to see the Holy Ghost
[1:47:27] falling like he fell on my grandmother
[1:47:29] my whole life and her lips would begin
[1:47:32] to murmur her lips would begin to
[1:47:34] tremble with stammering lips he said in
[1:47:37] Isaiah with stammering lips and another
[1:47:39] tongue I will speak to my people this is
[1:47:42] the
[1:47:43] refreshing this is the
[1:47:47] refreshing Hallelujah where with the
[1:47:49] weary shall find
[1:47:52] rest is that all right and we need that
[1:47:57] Isaiah 2811 and 12 for with stammering
[1:48:00] lips and another tongue will he speak to
[1:48:04] this people to whom he said this is the
[1:48:07] rest wherewith you may cause the weary
[1:48:09] to rest and this is the
[1:48:16] refreshing huh could you help me
[1:48:22] yet they would not
[1:48:25] hear you know when we read that we say
[1:48:27] that's a
[1:48:28] Baptist that's the
[1:48:31] Methodist that's the
[1:48:34] denominations well it was directed to
[1:48:36] the Jews and guess what the Jew is
[1:48:42] you you're the Jew that it was directed
[1:48:44] to it's one new man now this will work
[1:48:48] for the bride of Christ so let's not
[1:48:50] blame the other denominations who don't
[1:48:52] want anything to do with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:54] let's look within let's look at this
[1:48:57] house let's look at these other churches
[1:48:59] that are represented that claim to
[1:49:01] believe the fullness of this
[1:49:03] message and you let somebody get a
[1:49:06] little stammering
[1:49:09] lip and they want an interpreter before
[1:49:11] they ever say
[1:49:13] anything the Deacon sometime will go
[1:49:16] around and say don't get
[1:49:19] to they sound like they're talking in
[1:49:22] some Hello I need a little help woo my
[1:49:27] lips are dry my tongue's dry my mouth's
[1:49:30] dry I need
[1:49:35] help this come on sister Flo thank
[1:49:38] you I long to see like my granny the
[1:49:42] spirit of God would fall on her I could
[1:49:44] tell her chin would be neither one of us
[1:49:47] have a
[1:49:48] chin you can't see my well it ain't
[1:49:51] there but you know how terrible how how
[1:49:54] without one I am if I didn't have
[1:49:56] whiskers you'd see neither one of us had
[1:49:58] a chin but she had she had a little
[1:50:00] cuter one than me with a little little
[1:50:02] dimple right there and the spirit of God
[1:50:04] would fall on her and I'd watch that
[1:50:06] little chin begin to move like that and
[1:50:08] the next thing you know her lips would
[1:50:10] begin to quiver and I knew that what was
[1:50:12] about to come out of her was a prayer
[1:50:15] that was going to shake the heavens and
[1:50:16] the earth I knew that the spirit of God
[1:50:19] was about to pray through my big mama I
[1:50:22] knew that everything was going to be all
[1:50:25] right because Big Mama knew how to pray
[1:50:28] in the Holy
[1:50:32] Ghost there was never any backsliding in
[1:50:35] her I never saw her drawn back to the
[1:50:38] things of the world you know why she
[1:50:40] learned how to
[1:50:41] pray in the Holy Ghost if you let God
[1:50:45] lead you to a spirit inspired prayer in
[1:50:49] English or in another language I'm
[1:50:52] telling you you won't find yourself in
[1:50:55] the throws of Despair you will not find
[1:50:58] yourself in the throws of discouragement
[1:51:01] because you will constantly be building
[1:51:04] up your
[1:51:05] spirit you'll be building up the inner
[1:51:08] man as the spirit of oh as the spirit of
[1:51:12] God flows through

[1:51:25] which leads us to uh simat tah the last
[1:51:30] day of the feast and the Bible said on
[1:51:33] the last day the great day the last day
[1:51:35] of the feast Jesus stood up brother gley

[1:51:41] that great water oblation ceremony that
[1:51:44] took place every day of
[1:51:47] seot all seven days and then on the
[1:51:50] eighth day that last day they would go
[1:51:53] all the way down to the pool of salom
[1:51:56] fill up those vessels March up Zion's
[1:51:59] hill with a parade by the way according
[1:52:03] to the talmud there were banners being
[1:52:06] waved there were torches being lit Flags
[1:52:10] waving in the air shouts of praise and
[1:52:15] joy resounded in the tents of the
[1:52:19] righteous of the Lord woo because they
[1:52:22] were about to give God thanks so that
[1:52:25] priest they would come in a procession
[1:52:28] with these vessels they would walk holy
[1:52:31] they would walk in unison holy unto the
[1:52:34] Lord beautiful beautiful pageantry they
[1:52:36] would walk up through the oel they would
[1:52:39] climb the southern steps of the Temple
[1:52:41] Mount they would make their way up to
[1:52:43] the to the platform where the temple sat
[1:52:46] they would go in and pour that water on
[1:52:49] the found foundation stone in total
[1:52:52] silence all the rejoicing took place on
[1:52:55] the way up but once they got there it
[1:52:58] was total silence because something holy
[1:53:01] was about to take place they're pouring
[1:53:04] the water of the pool of silim onto the
[1:53:07] foundation stone they are giving God

[1:53:42] finished some things that he has started
[1:53:46] but he hasn't completed yet but you're
[1:53:48] not waiting until it's all completed to
[1:53:50] praise you're just praising him in
[1:53:52] advance you just letting the Holy Spirit
[1:53:55] have his way so that last day that last
[1:53:58] great day of the feast when everyone is
[1:54:01] silent Jesus just loved to interrupt
[1:54:04] religion
[1:54:09] yeah everywhere he went noise
[1:54:13] followed it it was really it got to be
[1:54:15] like a carnival when Jesus passed
[1:54:18] through the town because everybody he
[1:54:22] touched everybody he touched everybody
[1:54:25] he spoke to they experience Joy like
[1:54:28] they had never known before you tell me
[1:54:31] that this message has brought the
[1:54:33] fullness of the revelation of Jesus
[1:54:35] Christ and you can act starchier
[1:54:40] now than you did in
[1:54:43] Pentecost some of you baptized in
[1:54:46] titles you had more victory over there
[1:54:49] in titles
[1:54:50] then you do over here in the name
[1:54:53] something's wrong something's wrong
[1:54:57] you've let a preacher come along and
[1:54:59] tell you that because there's a fake
[1:55:05] tongue you've read where brother brandom
[1:55:08] mentions the false tongue and we have
[1:55:10] gotten so paranoid so afraid of the
[1:55:14] false
[1:55:16] tongue that we won't yield ourself to
[1:55:19] the
[1:55:20] genuine and I can hear the devil howling
[1:55:22] at
[1:55:25] us oh but they say we're we're not in
[1:55:27] the lips
[1:55:29] anymore well then preacher sit down shut
[1:55:33] up right CA we've heard from your lips
[1:55:37] about all we can handle I'm talking to
[1:55:39] myself come on if God's through with
[1:55:42] lips what's the preacher
[1:55:45] doing and remember that the lips is in
[1:55:48] the same head that the intellect is
[1:55:52] in on I'm I you some of you know where
[1:55:55] I'm at don't you you know the quotes you
[1:55:57] know what I'm talking about they say
[1:55:59] we're we're done with the lips we're now
[1:56:02] in the intellect age we now have a
[1:56:05] prophet who could read the minds and
[1:56:07] know by discernment the very thoughts of
[1:56:10] God and so we don't need anything any
[1:56:12] sign gifts we don't need anything that
[1:56:14] comes out of the lips and yet they
[1:56:16] preach and preach and preach and preach
[1:56:18] and preach out of their own intellect
[1:56:21] using their own lips while talking us
[1:56:24] out of our experience it's going to be
[1:56:26] quiet in
[1:56:27] here somebody ought to bust
[1:56:30] through somebody ought to make up their
[1:56:32] mind that you ought to have more over
[1:56:34] here in the fullness of the truth than
[1:56:37] you had over there in some Full Gospel
[1:56:39] Church
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:42] somewhere I see more moving of the
[1:56:44] spirit sometime in churches where they
[1:56:46] wear cargo shorts and ball caps
[1:56:52] somebody said that's the false Spirit
[1:56:53] that's not what brother random said he
[1:56:56] didn't call it a false Spirit he said it
[1:56:58] rains on the just and the
[1:57:01] unjust
[1:57:03] Hallelujah and if the tears have got
[1:57:06] enough sense to raise up their hand and
[1:57:09] say thank God for the rain why doesn't
[1:57:12] the
[1:57:13] we where is the
[1:57:16] seed where is the seed
[1:57:21] Hallelujah if the weeds can praise him
[1:57:25] why can't the
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:33] weed we
[1:57:36] must for they that worship me
[1:57:40] must worship me in
[1:57:45] spirit and in
[1:57:48] truth
[1:57:50] you don't substitute spirit for
[1:57:54] truth you don't substitute a holy ghost
[1:57:58] for a
[1:58:02] sermon you don't substitute Holy Ghost
[1:58:05] for a mystery
[1:58:08] revealed because without the Holy Ghost
[1:58:10] no mystery could be revealed and no
[1:58:13] mystery Revelation could be
[1:58:18] received
[1:58:24] we need him we need
[1:58:28] him we need
[1:58:31] him we need
[1:58:34] him I'm not
[1:58:36] done oh
[1:58:38] Hallelujah skip skip

[1:58:47] 16 vers 15 16 through 18 and he said
[1:58:50] unto
[1:58:51] them go ye into all the world and preach
[1:58:55] the gospel to Every Creature he that
[1:58:57] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:59:01] is baptism important it
[1:59:03] is it is he that he that believeth and
[1:59:06] is baptized shall be saved I don't
[1:59:08] believe that water baptism is the
[1:59:10] Regeneration necessary for salvation but
[1:59:13] I do believe that your obedience is
[1:59:16] necessary does someone have to be at
[1:59:18] baptized no but they should have a
[1:59:19] desire to obey and once you have a
[1:59:23] desire to obey there's water what
[1:59:25] prevent you from being baptized so he
[1:59:27] said he that believeth and is baptized
[1:59:30] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[1:59:32] shall be damned elas come get a
[1:59:35] microphone will you I know I give it to
[1:59:38] you the other day and you and never used
[1:59:40] you did I and these
[1:59:43] signs and these
[1:59:45] signs shall follow them that
[1:59:51] believe well I was uh I was over there
[1:59:54] and I heard them talking about
[1:59:56] visions and I don't want anything to do
[1:59:58] with people who who follow
[2:00:01] signs somebody was up sharing their
[2:00:04] dream I don't want anything to do with
[2:00:06] dreams because I don't believe that we
[2:00:08] ought to follow dreams I don't believe
[2:00:10] we ought to follow Visions I don't
[2:00:12] believe we ought to follow I don't
[2:00:15] either I don't either I'm not doing what
[2:00:18] I do because I had a vision I had one
[2:00:22] but I'm not doing what I do because I
[2:00:24] had a vision I'm doing what I do because
[2:00:26] of what the word said and the word said
[2:00:29] if I will do what he CED me to do these
[2:00:33] signs these signs shall follow that's
[2:00:37] you know what you're going to have a big
[2:00:39] crowd following you around because we

[2:01:04] the Supernatural is going to go where
[2:01:06] you
[2:01:08] go and it will if we pray in the Holy
[2:01:14] Ghost you say now brother isn't this
[2:01:16] ABCs yes it it almost blows my mind that
[2:01:23] the spirit of God would call us in
[2:01:26] 2023 to preach something that every one
[2:01:31] of us should have learned in our
[2:01:33] Pentecostal
[2:01:36] Church it is a way it's a
[2:01:38] shame that we would have to take yet the
[2:01:41] spirit of God plac the burden of the
[2:01:44] Lord the burden of his word on and said
[2:01:46] I want you just to go and lay out for
[2:01:49] the people the
[2:01:52] necessity I'm not offering you an option
[2:01:55] of how to pray I'm telling you the way
[2:01:57] the bride's got to pray we've got to
[2:02:00] pray in the spirit we we're not standing
[2:02:03] before Santa Claus we're not standing
[2:02:05] before our mommies and our daddies we're
[2:02:08] standing before the god of the universe
[2:02:10] and the only language that he's
[2:02:14] honoring is the spirit
[2:02:17] language it may be English
[2:02:20] it may
[2:02:23] [Applause]
[2:02:26] be it may be
[2:02:34] H it may be skin a
[2:02:38] KNE come on but if the spirit is
[2:02:41] birthing it if the spirit is inspiring
[2:02:44] it if the spirit is drawing it out of
[2:02:47] you you better obey the
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] lord well don't you think there has to
[2:02:55] be an interpreter present for someone to
[2:02:57] speak in tongues absolutely not I don't
[2:03:00] believe that for one second because I
[2:03:02] believe what the word said there are
[2:03:04] diverse kinds of
[2:03:06] tongues every tongue doesn't come as the
[2:03:08] gift of tongues if a tongue message is
[2:03:11] given as a gift of tongues there needs
[2:03:13] to be a gift of an interpreter present I
[2:03:16] got the
[2:03:17] scripture and says if if if the somebody
[2:03:20] gives it you know there's no interpretor
[2:03:23] pray pray that you receive the
[2:03:27] interpretation but all tongues are not
[2:03:29] messages in tongues oh you need a quote
[2:03:32] don't you I got
[2:03:34] it can you just preach in the word with
[2:03:37] me a few minutes and we'll put the
[2:03:40] cherry on the cake by giving you the
[2:03:42] quote later would it offend anybody if
[2:03:44] we just preach out of the prophets
[2:03:46] quotebook tonight come on would it
[2:03:48] offend you if we just take it back to
[2:03:50] the word for a little while tonight and
[2:03:52] then we'll come here at the end and tie
[2:03:55] it together with the message of the
[2:03:58] Hour come on he that believeth in his
[2:04:02] are you mad I'm not mad at
[2:04:05] anybody except the dumb
[2:04:09] devil I know

[2:04:17] one particular one do you see one every
[2:04:20] time I think like this I see could I
[2:04:22] call the name would it be wrong to call
[2:04:24] the name I see sister
[2:04:27] Bell from
[2:04:29] Canada and I remember the stories they
[2:04:32] told me about the move of God in her
[2:04:35] life in
[2:04:36] Pentecost how the spirit of God would
[2:04:38] pray through her and speak through her
[2:04:41] come on now what a powerful even being
[2:04:44] around her years later uh after meeting
[2:04:47] her in the message and many many many
[2:04:48] many others just like her you could feel
[2:04:51] just in her presence you could feel the
[2:04:53] spirit of the Lord but they tell me that
[2:04:55] that that in in the early days of her
[2:04:57] Pentecostal experience the spirit of God
[2:04:59] would move through her and pray through
[2:05:02] her she would give messages in tongues
[2:05:04] and they would be interpreted and my
[2:05:06] what a spirit what a spirit and I
[2:05:07] remember her standing before me one time
[2:05:09] and she said brother Shelly would you
[2:05:11] pray that God would restore to
[2:05:15] me what I let the preachers take from me
[2:05:20] would you pray that God will forgive
[2:05:23] me I was a poor
[2:05:27] Steward over my Holy Ghost
[2:05:30] baptism would you pray that God will
[2:05:33] forgive me and restore to me so that I

[2:11:45] angels that they have never learned

[2:11:50] fullness of the revelation of Jesus
[2:11:52] Christ has come that the that the church
[2:11:54] has lost her
[2:11:58] birth we've got to have the Holy
[2:12:01] Ghost we've got to have the Holy Ghost

[2:12:11] [Applause]
[2:12:13] week in the church age book
[2:12:17] my
[2:12:18] sardian Church age he said yes the
[2:12:23] spirit you should have it yes the spirit
[2:12:26] is not seven spirits I'll wait on
[2:12:35] you it's right after Mark
[2:12:40] 16:17 the spirit is not seven spirits
[2:12:44] but
[2:12:45] one he will always be the same
[2:12:50] what and act the
[2:12:54] same but this is the eagle age I don't
[2:12:57] care what age it
[2:12:59] is it could have been the Buzzard age
[2:13:01] for all I know but what I do know is the
[2:13:05] word of God and the prophet is telling
[2:13:07] us in many places this just happened to
[2:13:09] be the easiest one for me to
[2:13:11] grab that if the holy ghost or the
[2:13:13] spirit of the Lord is present he's going
[2:13:15] to act the same
[2:13:18] and the Seven Messengers will have the
[2:13:20] same
[2:13:22] spirit and teach the same
[2:13:25] word and have the same power if you make
[2:13:28] brother brandham contradict the Apostle
[2:13:30] Paul you're in false
[2:13:34] doctrin I can't follow a
[2:13:37] message I can't follow a message that
[2:13:40] contradicts the first church age
[2:13:44] messenger he said if I preach anything
[2:13:46] other than what he preached I'm a
[2:13:49] cursed when he stood in the in that
[2:13:52] place beyond the curtain of time and he
[2:13:54] said oh these are are these all brandom
[2:13:56] these are your people are all these
[2:13:59] brandom no these are your convert he
[2:14:02] said well I could only preach what Paul
[2:14:05] preached doesn't it embarrass you when
[2:14:08] you listen to a preacher uh who's
[2:14:10] preaching something
[2:14:12] contrary to what the Apostle Paul
[2:14:16] preached does it make you feel a little
[2:14:19] iffy about your faith come on if they
[2:14:22] make brother brandom preach something
[2:14:26] contradictory to the first church age
[2:14:28] messenger they've lost the continuity of
[2:14:30] the
[2:14:31] scripture and I can't embrace
[2:14:34] it he's got to preach what Paul preached
[2:14:38] I happen to believe he
[2:14:40] did I happen to believe when they when
[2:14:42] they preach otherwise it's because
[2:14:44] they're lifting things out of context
[2:14:46] it's because they believe that the
[2:14:47] message will stand alone maybe you're
[2:14:49] here tonight and you believe that the
[2:14:51] message will stand by itself I'm not one
[2:14:53] of
[2:14:54] those just so you'll know I believe it
[2:14:57] has to stand on the
[2:14:59] word I believe that's what the prophet
[2:15:01] said I believe you and I have to go to
[2:15:03] the Chinese Laundry I believe everything
[2:15:06] has to Dove tail hear me hear me is that
[2:15:10] too
[2:15:10] rough I believe it has to Dove tail with
[2:15:14] the word if you want God to bless it it
[2:15:16] can't be contrary
[2:15:18] to the
[2:15:21] [Music]
[2:15:22] word and if the church is the true
[2:15:24] church it will have the very same
[2:15:28] Spirit
[2:15:30] read and word and acts of power that
[2:15:34] they had at Pentecost just a minute I
[2:15:35] used to think that these preachers that
[2:15:38] had a reader thought they were
[2:15:41] something now I'm
[2:15:43] 55 and and overweight and I have to get
[2:15:46] my breath
[2:15:48] all right so he's here so I wipe sweat
[2:15:52] and breathe not because I think that
[2:15:54] that I'm so important I need someone to
[2:15:56] read the Bible for me read brother read
[2:16:00] this is a quote read it by experience it
[2:16:04] will be a Pentecostal Church stop don't
[2:16:06] read any further that's it let's go
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:11] home do you need anything
[2:16:13] else the bride Church in the last days
[2:16:16] she will be Pentecostal
[2:16:19] Church by
[2:16:22] experience not by Dogma not by
[2:16:26] Creed not by denomination not by
[2:16:33] presor District
[2:16:36] superintendence we're not running a
[2:16:37] railroad we're stewarding the Church of
[2:16:40] Jesus
[2:16:42] Christ we're not building a kingdom for
[2:16:45] man we're seeing the the kingdom of God
[2:16:49] restored in the earth through the
[2:16:51] fullness of his word and when that
[2:16:53] church Rises up she's not going to be
[2:16:55] afraid to pray in the
[2:16:58] spirit you'll see in a little while why
[2:17:00] it is so
[2:17:02] important cuz we talk way too
[2:17:05] much we speak way too much
[2:17:09] English we tell the devil
[2:17:11] everything he don't have to be gifted in
[2:17:14] any way of knowing what you're thinking
[2:17:15] he doesn't he can't read your thoughts
[2:17:17] he have
[2:17:19] to now you tell him everything that's
[2:17:22] wrong not only about yourself but about
[2:17:24] everybody around
[2:17:26] you he knows everybody's faults he knows
[2:17:30] exactly how to go after
[2:17:33] everybody because we speak it out what
[2:17:36] if we started praying in the
[2:17:39] spirit what if we started letting the
[2:17:41] spirit of the Lord direct our words in
[2:17:43] English and the next thing you know
[2:17:45] Heaven's language breaks through and you
[2:17:48] start talking like Angels
[2:17:51] talk I'll show you where the Prophet
[2:17:54] tells us that English is not going to be
[2:17:55] the the language of the New
[2:18:01] Kingdom we got to go we got to go got to
[2:18:03] go read what's wrong
[2:18:06] read and there will be tongues and
[2:18:08] interpret there will be no don't read
[2:18:10] that there will be it doesn't say there
[2:18:13] will be it says there will
[2:18:16] be there will will be tongues there will
[2:18:19] be
[2:18:20] what
[2:18:26] tongues not 12 in ones that flap all the
[2:18:30] time holy
[2:18:33] tongues new
[2:18:35] tongues Spirit
[2:18:41] tongues we're not going to compare
[2:18:44] languages when somebody first receives
[2:18:47] the Holy
[2:18:48] Ghost and I want you to know by the way
[2:18:50] oh I forgot better run all the
[2:18:51] disclaimers I don't have time for all
[2:18:53] the disclaimers tonight I know that
[2:18:55] speaking in tongues is not the initial
[2:18:57] evidence of the Holy Ghost I also know
[2:18:59] brother brandom said once you get the
[2:19:00] Holy Ghost you will speak in
[2:19:04] tongues he said the Pentecostals got the
[2:19:07] cart before the horse he said we ought
[2:19:09] to preach you need the baptism of the
[2:19:10] Holy Ghost and after you've received it
[2:19:12] you'll speak in
[2:19:14] tongues he said I believe
[2:19:16] everybody will at some time or
[2:19:19] another filled with the Holy Ghost speak
[2:19:22] in
[2:19:24] tongues oh well I did back in Pentecost
[2:19:27] no I don't believe that's what it's
[2:19:28] talking about I Believe by experience
[2:19:31] read it right by experience it by
[2:19:34] experience it will be a Pentecostal
[2:19:38] Church will by experience it will be a
[2:19:43] Pentecostal Church there you go aren't
[2:19:45] you a preacher in training and there
[2:19:47] will be tongues will and
[2:19:51] interpretations oh and prophecy and
[2:19:54] healings and
[2:19:58] healings well if there's no interpreter
[2:20:01] then we're not going to know what's
[2:20:02] being said that is exactly right God
[2:20:04] wants to talk to the whole church
[2:20:08] sometime but you know what the prophet
[2:20:10] said about tongues and interpretation he
[2:20:12] said that becomes
[2:20:15] prophecy prophecy and ifies the body the
[2:20:19] whole body prophecies to edify the whole
[2:20:21] body but he said when tongues are
[2:20:22] interpreted they become prophecy I think
[2:20:24] some people are cold would you fix the
[2:20:26] air yeah people look a little chilly how
[2:20:29] in the world you could be
[2:20:34] chilly did you finish reading and
[2:20:36] interpret and
[2:20:38] prophecy and prophecy now now now now
[2:20:41] now if we've had the last prophet how
[2:20:45] could there be prophecy because he told
[2:20:47] us there's a difference between a
[2:20:49] prophet and the gift of Prophecy but he
[2:20:53] also told us Paul did now I'm just I'm
[2:20:56] just out on a limb now because Paul said
[2:21:00] it that may not be good enough for some
[2:21:03] folks but Paul said that in that
[2:21:06] five-fold Ministry those Ascension gifts
[2:21:08] there will be Apostles prophets P I
[2:21:11] heard brother brandom talking about the
[2:21:15] freaks he said they to make God like
[2:21:19] that he's not a three-fingered
[2:21:24] god he's not a four-fingered god hello
[2:21:27] anybody he's a
[2:21:30] FiveFinger his right hand's got five
[2:21:33] fingers Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher
[2:21:36] evangels all five they're here they're
[2:21:38] in the body they're in the body they're
[2:21:41] in the body and I tell you what if
[2:21:42] they'll press play and Obey if that
[2:21:45] five-fold Ministry in their own personal
[2:21:48] lives will press play and Obey they'll
[2:21:51] have a whole lot more to say once they
[2:21:52] get up
[2:21:54] here come on brother I'm not against the
[2:21:57] tapes we all need them you better be
[2:22:01] listening to them at home you better not
[2:22:02] be waiting to get to church to hear that
[2:22:04] word we're feasting on that so when I
[2:22:08] hear them talk about a false five-fold
[2:22:10] Ministry I agree with them that's the
[2:22:12] one that don't care that could care less
[2:22:15] about what he said there's something
[2:22:17] wrong with people like that there's
[2:22:19] something wrong with people that come
[2:22:20] this close oh yeah God didn't bring you
[2:22:23] this close to the message of the
[2:22:27] Hour come on he didn't bring you this
[2:22:30] close to the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:22:31] for you to go scampering back to your
[2:22:33] denomination of
[2:22:36] jum he brought you this close to the
[2:22:38] truth so you'd make a
[2:22:40] stand I don't care if brother brandom
[2:22:43] said nine when there were
[2:22:44] eight right on I don't care care if he
[2:22:47] said there were 15 when there were 10
[2:22:50] these little carnal things don't matter
[2:22:51] to me and they're not going to matter to
[2:22:53] the
[2:22:54] bride because we're not here to make a
[2:22:56] man
[2:22:57] infallible that's a Catholic
[2:23:00] Spirit ver B said this thing keeps going
[2:23:02] the way it is this will be worse than
[2:23:03] the Catholic
[2:23:06] church he preached that in his own
[2:23:10] house I believe it too I do
[2:23:13] too because you've organized with your
[2:23:17] religious
[2:23:19] Jon and where is the holy ghost in the
[2:23:24] [Applause]
[2:23:28] people come
[2:23:30] on I haven't had to preach like this in
[2:23:32] a long time it sounds
[2:23:36] wild I I'm I'm I'm sorry because my
[2:23:40] children lose friends when I preach like
[2:23:42] this I'm not
[2:23:45] kidding I'm not kidding
[2:23:48] they lose
[2:23:50] friends the last Youth Camp they went to
[2:23:52] in the message the last Youth Camp that
[2:23:55] they attended they were told to their
[2:23:57] face what the people think about this
[2:24:00] church really wow they said we get

[2:25:50] regardless if I ever see him again I'm
[2:25:51] going to pray that he prays in the Holy
[2:25:53] Ghost until everybody around him looks
[2:25:55] at him like he's lost his mind because
[2:25:58] that's what we
[2:26:01] need and if you think I want for my
[2:26:04] daughter some stick in the

[2:27:10] tongues he said I would that every
[2:27:12] member of my church spoke with tongues I
[2:27:14] would like them to do that I believe if
[2:27:17] you ask God God will grant it to you

[2:27:21] trying to say that tongues are no longer

[2:27:42] tongues but so can the Holy
[2:27:45] Ghost
[2:27:48] we have emphasized the
[2:27:52] fults we've called the attention to the
[2:27:55] counterfeit that's right when brother
[2:27:58] Bram said the Pentecostal skies are full
[2:27:59] of the
[2:28:01] genuine look out there look Yonder Bri
[2:28:05] look Yonder The pent come on now come on

[2:28:14] language how many times these fiery Holy
[2:28:17] Ghost preachers will preach like that
[2:28:19] and they'll say oh I almost spoke in
[2:28:24] tongues you would set your church
[2:28:31] free if you just instead of saying I'm
[2:28:34] so sorry I'm so so sorry forgive me
[2:28:35] forgive me forgive me forgive me forgive
[2:28:37] me I almost spoke in tongues why don't

[2:28:57] one's everybody's Reverend he's pouring
[2:28:58] the water the priest is pouring the
[2:29:02] water over the foundation Zone silence
[2:29:05] and Yeshua the Lord Jesus screams out
[2:29:09] busting religion all to pieces and he
[2:29:13] says whoever thirst
[2:29:21] yeah God make me that
[2:29:25] kind I want to be that one in the
[2:29:28] crowd I want to be just like him when
[2:29:31] everybody else thinks that everything
[2:29:33] has to be so sacred and
[2:29:37] sanctimonious God God bless us all come
[2:29:41] on now when everybody else is in some
[2:29:44] kind of form I want to be the one that
[2:29:46] says who is thirsty among
[2:29:51] [Music]
[2:29:53] you who wants to drink of
[2:29:58] water

[2:30:18] [Applause]
[2:30:20] Rivers Fountains of Living
[2:30:24] Water it's a first fruits the whole the
[2:30:26] whole water ablation is a is a first
[2:30:28] fruits thing because they're praising
[2:30:30] God for what little rain has come and
[2:30:32] they're praising God in advance for the
[2:30:33] rain that will
[2:30:36] follow we haven't seen the last of the
[2:30:38] latter rain I'm telling
[2:30:40] you haven't have not we have not
[2:30:44] somebody said well didn't brother
[2:30:45] Brandon put us Way Beyond on the way
[2:30:47] beyond the latter rain there may be some
[2:30:49] quotes that lean in that direction and
[2:30:51] until you understand that you can't say
[2:30:54] the latter rign is over until you know
[2:30:56] that the teaching
[2:30:58] Reign has took a
[2:31:01] hold the teaching Reign has to it has to
[2:31:04] take a hold somebody's got to preach the
[2:31:05] teaching Reign somebody's got to preach
[2:31:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:31:09] somebody's got to declare the message
[2:31:11] and it's got to get in the hearts and
[2:31:12] minds of the
[2:31:13] Believers and then God's going to come
[2:31:15] and pour water on
[2:31:17] it he's already poured some water on
[2:31:20] mine has he poured any water on
[2:31:23] [Applause]
[2:31:26] yours yes sir it's so bad I'm not going
[2:31:30] to call names I'm not going to point to
[2:31:32] people in this room but it's so bad
[2:31:36] until the kids the young people are so
[2:31:39] confused over whether or not they have
[2:31:41] the Holy
[2:31:45] Ghost
[2:31:47] and when they ask the preacher sometime
[2:31:49] this is what they tell me this is what
[2:31:50] young people have told me that when they
[2:31:52] ask the preacher sometime they realize
[2:31:54] that even the preachers are
[2:31:58] confused about how do you know you have
[2:32:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:32:02] sometimes it's like starting a lawnmower
[2:32:04] that won't
[2:32:06] start you say well how do you know you
[2:32:08] got the baptism of
[2:32:10] hly they don't know what to
[2:32:13] say they stutter and stammer they don't
[2:32:16] really know what to say but let me tell
[2:32:19] you the best way for someone to know
[2:32:21] whether or not they have the Holy Ghost
[2:32:22] is to experience
[2:32:24] him and there's a young man in this
[2:32:27] house tonight that testified to me the
[2:32:28] other night that when he they said well
[2:32:30] you'll know it you'll know it you'll
[2:32:31] know what do you mean I'll know it on
[2:32:33] this was just is what do you mean I know
[2:32:35] it how am I going to know it is that
[2:32:38] fair oh but guess
[2:32:42] what when God opened up the heavens and
[2:32:44] baptized that young man with the Holy
[2:32:46] Ghost goes guess what he knew
[2:32:48] it ain't that right he knew it you can't
[2:32:52] grab a hold of a live wire and not know
[2:32:59] it you can't sit under the Breath of
[2:33:03] [Applause]
[2:33:12] God God will be in the midst of her God
[2:33:14] will declare himself in the M of her as
[2:33:16] he always say hallelujah she will be
[2:33:19] unorganized am he said I I believe if
[2:33:22] you would ask God God will grant it to
[2:33:23] you but let me tell you I know plenty of
[2:33:25] people that speak in tongues and hadn't
[2:33:26] got the Holy Ghost so do
[2:33:29] I so why don't I take the next two hours
[2:33:33] and preach on those quotes not
[2:33:36] tonight because he didn't call me up
[2:33:38] here tonight to preach on false
[2:33:43] tongues I know where to send you if you
[2:33:45] want to hear that message come on but he
[2:33:48] didn't call me here tonight to preach
[2:33:49] that one he called me here tonight to
[2:33:51] remind you that there cannot be a
[2:33:57] counterfeit unless there's a
[2:34:02] genuine you know what's going to set the
[2:34:04] Amish people free not by bringing them
[2:34:07] out of one Creed and into another
[2:34:11] Creed that makes us two-fold children of
[2:34:14] hell that's not what going to set them
[2:34:16] free what's going to set them free is a
[2:34:18] real experience with the Holy
[2:34:23] Ghost to get out from under a
[2:34:27] bishop to get out from under a bishop
[2:34:30] this is we have want none of that around
[2:34:31] here we can't afford to have any of that
[2:34:32] around
[2:34:34] here I'm afraid we won't be able to
[2:34:36] contain that you're right you can't
[2:34:38] contain fire once it gets out and you
[2:34:40] know what brother Bram said about
[2:34:41] Wildfire don't
[2:34:42] [Music]

[2:34:48] he
[2:34:49] said my god sister I feel the same way
[2:34:53] brother I'd rather think I had a little
[2:34:55] bit of wildfire than to

[2:35:16] fire it'll do me till the real fire gets
[2:35:20] here we're so afraid of the faults we're
[2:35:22] so afraid of the counterfeit we're so
[2:35:25] afraid of the
[2:35:27] imitation that we're not contending for
[2:35:29] the
[2:35:30] real oh there's going to be a generation
[2:35:32] of young people raised up around this
[2:35:35] [Applause]
[2:35:42] [Applause]
[2:35:44] message
[2:35:46] I don't know whether say this or
[2:35:48] not they're not forever they're not
[2:35:51] forever going to be satisfied to go
[2:35:52] three times a
[2:35:56] year and come home to a dead dry
[2:35:59] [Music]
[2:36:02] Church what they do now is they come
[2:36:04] home and for three or four weeks the
[2:36:05] whole church gets stirred up but it
[2:36:07] doesn't take long let somebody try to
[2:36:10] give her a message in tongues other than
[2:36:12] the pastor I've noticed it's okay for
[2:36:14] the pastor to do it yeah
[2:36:17] I know this sounds
[2:36:19] critical I I I I would almost apologize
[2:36:21] had I not come here tonight on a
[2:36:24] [Music]
[2:36:26] mandate how many how for how long for
[2:36:28] how long do you think those young people
[2:36:30] are going to go to youth camps and dance
[2:36:32] around and worship God and be filled
[2:36:34] with the spirit of the Lord and continue
[2:36:36] to go
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:39] back and watch the Deacon put out the
[2:36:44] fire so afraid afid of
[2:36:47] disorder don't let anything get out of
[2:36:50] order what you really mean is don't let
[2:36:52] it get too anointed because if it gets
[2:36:54] too anointed you won't know what to do
[2:36:56] with it
[2:37:00] folk well I was in a church one time
[2:37:02] where they give message in tongues
[2:37:04] interpretation and that woman went off
[2:37:06] into sin and and what I did I was
[2:37:09] too I saw all the faults and yet I
[2:37:12] didn't see enough of the faults to
[2:37:14] convince me that somewhere there wasn't
[2:37:16] the real in fact in fact if you get
[2:37:18] tired like I did of the false you get
[2:37:21] tired of the counterfeit you go wild
[2:37:23] zealous
[2:37:30] passionate oh they call me
[2:37:35] in brother I'll point at you I won't
[2:37:38] call your name because this is too rough
[2:37:40] for your name to be associated with it I
[2:37:42] wouldn't do that to you but you know I'm
[2:37:44] talking to uhuh
[2:37:46] they called me in petted me on the
[2:37:50] head some of the camp meeting speakers
[2:37:53] now were just beginning back
[2:37:55] then and they called me in and patted me
[2:37:57] on the head you'll settle down one
[2:38:00] day you'll Cal
[2:38:02] down the word will settle you the word
[2:38:04] will mature
[2:38:06] you you're fiery now
[2:38:10] yeah I thought in the M minute I didn't
[2:38:13] know no better and originally I thought
[2:38:15] they were saying something
[2:38:18] nice we can see by the spirit that you
[2:38:21] will come to maturity but that's not at
[2:38:23] all what they were saying they were
[2:38:25] basically saying hang around us long
[2:38:28] enough and you'll do it just like I do
[2:38:30] it because that's what makes us
[2:38:35] comfortable thank God for every genuine
[2:38:37] house out there where the fire's falling
[2:38:39] thank God for every genuine man of God
[2:38:42] that has taken a stand thank God for
[2:38:46] every preacher of this message that will
[2:38:48] get the Holy Ghost to his
[2:38:52] people don't you ever think that I think
[2:38:56] that this is the only
[2:38:58] [Applause]
[2:39:00] place not for one second do I think that
[2:39:04] not for one second do I believe that but
[2:39:07] it's one of the
[2:39:11] places and all you have to do is look
[2:39:13] over the last year
[2:39:16] and you'll find that prophecies that we
[2:39:18] gave 20 years ago and more are now
[2:39:20] coming to pass people are now looking
[2:39:23] for a drink of
[2:39:27] water they they're tired of talking
[2:39:29] about
[2:39:30] it they're tired of being told that you
[2:39:33] better be careful you better be careful
[2:39:34] better be careful care better be careful
[2:39:36] who better be
[2:39:37] careful they're tired of being told if
[2:39:40] your hair stands
[2:39:41] up come on yeah well I'm not following
[2:39:44] my hair standing up on my arm but I will
[2:39:46] tell you I'll just be honest with you
[2:39:48] there are times that the electrical
[2:39:50] power of
[2:39:52] God moves across the surface of my
[2:39:55] skin and I do believe my the hairs on my
[2:39:58] arm are standing out of tension but
[2:40:01] that's not how I know I have the Holy
[2:40:03] Ghost not because I feel it not because
[2:40:05] I talk in tough not because I see
[2:40:08] Visions but I know it by the quickening

[2:40:13] saved by the quicking making alive the
[2:40:17] quickening of your spirit you get an
[2:40:20] earthquake going on in your spirit

[2:41:00] Ghost I say that in
[2:41:04] love those who look terrified when the
[2:41:07] spirit of God begins to move or it gets

[2:43:40] Hallelujah I thought all tongues were
[2:43:41] the same I thought every tongue had to
[2:43:43] be interpreted I thought like the Church
[2:43:46] of Christ that the only kind of tongues
[2:43:48] that were allowed were allowed in the
[2:43:49] book of Acts and that was only because
[2:43:50] they spoke in known languages yeah well
[2:43:53] this scripture just simply says yes
[2:43:55] there are teachers yes there are
[2:43:56] Miracles yes there are Gifts of healing
[2:43:57] but there's also a diversity of tongues
[2:43:59] in the Holy Ghost
[2:44:03] Church sometimes they hear people
[2:44:05] speaking in their own language sometimes
[2:44:07] it's a another tongue of man that they

[2:48:47] day this nation becomes so
[2:48:51] Multicultural we we may be once again in

[2:48:57] understood in
[2:49:01] Spanish don't put that out like we might
[2:49:03] not ever need that
[2:49:05] again we've been on the mission field
[2:49:08] sometimes you need it on the
[2:49:10] Mion I'll tell you something else has
[2:49:12] happened and I know it's happened to
[2:49:13] brother too youe pring somewhere and all
[2:49:15] of a sudden the spirit of God says he's
[2:49:17] not saying what you're
[2:49:22] saying it's happened to me more than
[2:49:24] once and I said
[2:49:26] hey yeah you didn't just say what I
[2:49:30] said you said something
[2:49:33] else and I've had people call out from
[2:49:36] the congregation not Preachers by the
[2:49:37] way people call out from the
[2:49:40] congregation when he'd start stammering
[2:49:41] around trying to explain himself in his
[2:49:44] language I've had people call out and
[2:49:45] said no no no no no don't you deny it
[2:49:50] yeah I didn't know what he was saying
[2:49:52] but the Holy Ghost
[2:49:55] did it may happen to some of you young
[2:49:57] preachers you're going to need that Holy
[2:50:00] Ghost you're going to need to know going
[2:50:02] to need these things 1 Corinthians 14:22
[2:50:05] wherefore tongues are for a sign not to
[2:50:07] them that believe but to them that
[2:50:09] believe not so some tongues are for
[2:50:13] evangelism some tongues are for
[2:50:17] signs to the
[2:50:19] unbeliever
[2:50:20] [Music]
[2:50:23] right there are also Heavenly
[2:50:25] language oh yeah Heavenly languages read
[2:50:28] 1 Corinthians 13:1 read it for me though
[2:50:31] I speak though I speak with the tongues
[2:50:34] of men and of angels and have not
[2:50:36] charity I am become as sounding brass or
[2:50:40] a tinkling symbol got to have
[2:50:42] love got to have charity yeah got to
[2:50:45] have perfect
[2:50:49] love that's not how they preach
[2:50:52] it that's not what I hear people saying
[2:50:54] so much it's not tongues yeah on it's
[2:51:00] not interpretation tongue not the
[2:51:04] gifts it's
[2:51:07] love it is love because if the gifts
[2:51:10] don't operate in love they operate in
[2:51:13] the wrong spirit
[2:51:15] got to have love that's right but the
[2:51:17] kind of love that's being ministered to
[2:51:18] there that's not the kind of love that
[2:51:20] says there are no more the church is no
[2:51:22] longer Pentecostal Church by experience
[2:51:25] what if I told you that I don't believe
[2:51:27] that this bride church is ever going to
[2:51:30] outgrow her Pentecostal
[2:51:33] birth amen I believe when the Rapture
[2:51:36] takes place there's still going to be
[2:51:38] some Among Us yes that pray in the Holy
[2:51:43] Ghost
[2:51:47] so which is it they often like to say
[2:51:50] Well when that which is perfect is come
[2:51:52] even brother brandom struggled with the
[2:51:53] concept he interpreted it three
[2:51:55] different
[2:51:59] ways all three ways are good I believe
[2:52:02] all three I believe it is perfect love I
[2:52:04] believe it is many things I also believe
[2:52:07] that it's the perfect interpretation of
[2:52:09] the word but I want you to know that is
[2:52:12] more rare it's going to be this going to
[2:52:14] be
[2:52:15] rough put your seat Bel on that's more
[2:52:18] rare among the message than people are
[2:52:20] willing to
[2:52:22] admit because if you're making the
[2:52:24] prophet say something that the word
[2:52:26] didn't
[2:52:27] say that's not the right interpretation
[2:52:30] of the
[2:52:34] word so we need some more of the
[2:52:37] revelation we need God revealing To Us
[2:52:39] by the Holy Spirit when we sit under
[2:52:41] those tapes and we hear that word we
[2:52:43] need the Holy Ghost go to show us how we
[2:52:45] can place that in the
[2:52:47] scripture and then we can hang our souls
[2:52:49] over hell for this message amen I'm not
[2:52:53] going to be in the shoes of those who
[2:52:54] say every word he spoke was thus sayeth
[2:52:57] the
[2:52:59] Lord there's only one who every word he
[2:53:01] ever spoke was thus sayeth the Lord
[2:53:03] guess who that was the
[2:53:07] Lord the Lord
[2:53:10] amen amen everybody else is subject to
[2:53:13] like passions Elijah the prophet subject
[2:53:15] to like passions as we are brother brand
[2:53:18] I'm often saying I make thousands of
[2:53:19] mistakes every day which by the way is a
[2:53:21] mistake because I don't believe he made
[2:53:23] thousands of mistakes every day I don't
[2:53:25] believe anybody made it was an
[2:53:27] exaggeration but he got the point across
[2:53:29] to some and very few very few refuse to
[2:53:32] hear it yeah oh he didn't mean
[2:53:36] that you've got to read between the
[2:53:41] lines it's all th say the Lord
[2:53:45] yes which I didn't mean to say this but
[2:53:49] it's
[2:53:50] coming which which is the sayith the
[2:53:52] Lord yeah when he preached that hell was
[2:53:54] eternal or when he preached that hell
[2:53:55] was not Eternal right when he preached
[2:53:58] that the white horse rider was Jesus
[2:53:59] Christ or when he preached that it was
[2:54:00] the
[2:54:03] Antichrist how's the little bride going
[2:54:05] to know she's going to take both of
[2:54:07] those
[2:54:07] words is the white horse rider the
[2:54:09] Antichrist is he Christ Christ or the
[2:54:11] Antichrist Christ guess what she's going
[2:54:12] to do she's going to take that to the
[2:54:14] word
[2:54:15] and she's going to find out he's the
[2:54:17] Antichrist and God revealed to brother
[2:54:19] brandom in a powerful way showed him
[2:54:23] exactly who the were he said well I
[2:54:25] thought it was
[2:54:26] Jesus come to find out it's the
[2:54:30] counterfeit right but it couldn't have
[2:54:33] been don't get mad it couldn't have been
[2:54:36] thus sayith the Lord yeah both times
[2:54:39] that's right or any of you preachers
[2:54:42] don't don't get loud but just nod a
[2:54:43] little louder
[2:54:45] yeah do you know my
[2:54:49] heart do you know my
[2:54:51] heart I've made my
[2:54:58] stand though I speak with tongues of men
[2:55:01] and angels that's diversities of tongues

[2:55:27] tongues he said the age is ushered in by
[2:55:29] prophetic it'll go out the same way it

[3:03:34] that do I have a few more
[3:03:36] minutes there are also different
[3:03:38] administrations of
[3:03:40] tongues I'm not here preaching on
[3:03:42] tongues you thought I was preaching on
[3:03:43] tongues no I I'm going to do that I'm
[3:03:44] going to do it I'm going to do it I have
[3:03:46] a whole series I'm going to preach on
[3:03:48] all the different kinds of tongues which
[3:03:50] ones need to be interpretting which ones
[3:03:52] don't I'm going to do it all but not
[3:03:53] tonight I'm I'm pray I'm talking tonight
[3:03:55] about praying in the spirit but I had to
[3:03:57] get a little bit out there would you
[3:03:58] read First Corinthians 12 6 and 7 in the
[3:04:01] Amplified if you need to stand to rest
[3:04:03] you can if you need to stretch your legs
[3:04:05] you can but come back I'm going to take
[3:04:07] just a few more minutes I can't leave it
[3:04:08] like this no sir and there are
[3:04:12] distinctive Vari
[3:04:14] of operation so stop trying to make it
[3:04:17] all the same
[3:04:19] thing all tongues are not the same all
[3:04:22] administrations of tongues are not the
[3:04:25] same read on of working to accomplish
[3:04:28] things there are different things that
[3:04:30] the spirit is trying to accomplish and
[3:04:33] so there are different administrations
[3:04:35] and different operations go ahead but it
[3:04:37] is the same God who inspires and
[3:04:41] energizes them all in all
[3:04:45] all go ahead read on but to each one is
[3:04:49] given the manifestation of the Holy
[3:04:52] Spirit the evidence the spiritual
[3:04:55] illumination of the spirit for good and
[3:04:58] profit King James says diversities and
[3:05:01] operations let me give you one of the
[3:05:03] diversities of operation 1 Corinthians
[3:05:04] 14:2 this does not have to be
[3:05:09] interpreted there's no scripture
[3:05:11] anywhere that says this kind of tongue
[3:05:14] has to be interpreted read it in King
[3:05:16] James for he that speaketh in an unknown
[3:05:19] tongue speaketh not unto men but unto
[3:05:22] God oh wait a minute wait a minute wait
[3:05:24] a minute I thought the scripture said a
[3:05:25] moment ago that tongues were aign to the
[3:05:30] unbeliever that would be speaking to men
[3:05:32] right this one said tongues are not to
[3:05:35] be spoken to men they're spoken to God
[3:05:37] why because it's a different kind of
[3:05:39] tongue with a different Administration
[3:05:40] and operation of tongues hello am yes
[3:05:45] for no man understandeth him how be it
[3:05:48] in the spirit he speaketh
[3:05:51] Mysteries
[3:05:54] yes be
[3:05:57] careful right we had a young man come
[3:06:00] here one time he was trying to believe
[3:06:01] for the supernatural he was trying to
[3:06:03] believe that God was moving in his bride
[3:06:05] but he heard a message in tongues that
[3:06:07] lasted a full 30 seconds longer than the
[3:06:10] interpretation my goodness that's right
[3:06:13] and he blew his mind don't laugh at him
[3:06:16] because some of you have thought the
[3:06:17] same thing the message in tongues last 5
[3:06:19] minutes and the interpretation last two
[3:06:21] and a half couldn't be God are you
[3:06:24] crazy are you
[3:06:26] crazy have you ever been out of
[3:06:30] Alabama don't you know that in other
[3:06:32] languages things can take longer to
[3:06:37] say or they can be shorter in their
[3:06:40] inter because some languages have fewer
[3:06:42] words
[3:06:45] words are you kidding
[3:06:48] me we have got that technical around the
[3:06:52] message that we're going to time the
[3:06:57] [Music]
[3:07:03] interpretation have
[3:07:06] you this young man was very sincere but
[3:07:09] I just explained to him just what I've
[3:07:11] explained to
[3:07:12] you but here's another thing he said he
[3:07:15] saidwell in the in the message in
[3:07:18] tongues there were certain phrases that
[3:07:20] were
[3:07:21] repeated la la la la la la la la la T la
[3:07:26] la la and he said when the
[3:07:28] interpretation came I was waiting to
[3:07:31] hear that phrase
[3:07:34] repeated that's a logical thought but
[3:07:37] remember we're not talking about logical
[3:07:38] things here we're talking about
[3:07:40] spiritual things spiritual Things Are
[3:07:43] are not discerned by the intellect
[3:07:44] they're discerned by the
[3:07:48] word how many of you understand that
[3:07:50] Jesus could have said verily
[3:07:52] once and it would have meant the same
[3:07:55] thing it means
[3:07:56] truly but he often said truly truly yeah
[3:08:01] verily
[3:08:02] verily sometimes a phrase may be
[3:08:04] repeated in another language and it
[3:08:06] might even have there are certain
[3:08:08] phrases in certain languages that can be
[3:08:11] that you can use for English for
[3:08:13] instance English words you can use one
[3:08:15] set of English words when it's said the
[3:08:18] first time and another set of English
[3:08:20] words to expound on what was said the
[3:08:23] first time it's interpretation for
[3:08:25] crying out loud it's not word for
[3:08:29] word is there any scripture that says it
[3:08:31] has to be t for
[3:08:34] Tat are you do you think I'm going crazy
[3:08:37] here some of you all of a sudden started
[3:08:40] looking at me like you're
[3:08:41] just prach the truth this is about 20
[3:08:45] years
[3:08:46] overdue we need to take a little time
[3:08:49] they're speaking
[3:08:51] Mysteries they're not talking to man
[3:08:54] they're talking to God sometime you go
[3:08:55] lay hands on somebody and they start
[3:08:57] talking in
[3:09:00] tongues hopefully not so loud that
[3:09:02] they've drawn all the attention of the
[3:09:04] house onto themselves because if they do
[3:09:07] that would almost require an interpreter
[3:09:09] if there was an
[3:09:11] interpretation yeah
[3:09:13] that's right but what if you just pray
[3:09:14] for them in a prayer line brother Dwayne
[3:09:16] you've been uh busy and allot of those I
[3:09:18] called your name I'm so sorry brother
[3:09:20] you know who you
[3:09:23] are you've been involved in a lot of
[3:09:25] those prayer lines have you ever had any
[3:09:27] of those precious sisters have you ever
[3:09:28] seen them young Godly women or young
[3:09:31] Godly Brothers come through there and
[3:09:32] they're being prayed for and they talk a
[3:09:34] little bit in tongues la la la la la la
[3:09:36] la la sh sh la
[3:09:41] la
[3:09:44] was that all right did you did you stop
[3:09:46] them in the line and say w we need an
[3:09:52] interpretation no because you knew they
[3:09:54] were speaking something you knew the
[3:09:56] Holy Ghost was saying something you know
[3:09:57] what he was probably saying I'm an
[3:09:59] overcomer I'm an overcomer I'm an
[3:10:00] overcomer I'm an overcomer he was
[3:10:03] probably saying I receive this blessing
[3:10:05] I receive this blessing I receive this
[3:10:07] blessing Hallelujah but it come out T la
[3:10:10] la la la la la oh I'm having fun doing
[3:10:15] that no it didn't need an interpretation
[3:10:18] they were speaking something between
[3:10:20] them and God and it might even been
[3:10:23] their Destiny they might have been
[3:10:26] [Music]
[3:10:28] declaring their own destiny to the
[3:10:31] [Applause]
[3:10:33] dev speak it
[3:10:35] now how be he speaking mysteries in the
[3:10:38] spirit read it in the Amplified hurry
[3:10:41] for one who speaks in an unknown known
[3:10:43] tongue speaks not to men but to God for
[3:10:46] no one understands or catches his
[3:10:48] meaning because in The Holy Spirits he
[3:10:50] utters secret Tru secret truths and
[3:10:52] hidden things not obvious to
[3:10:55] understanding to the understanding it is
[3:10:58] bypassing his
[3:11:04] intellect I wonder how many young Godly
[3:11:07] men have walked across that stage and
[3:11:09] they were talking la la la la la shaaa
[3:11:11] making some little sound like like that
[3:11:14] and what they were really saying was God
[3:11:16] speaking through them I'm going to give
[3:11:17] you a Godly wife I'm going to fill you
[3:11:19] with a give you a virtuous woman I'm
[3:11:21] going to give you children that will
[3:11:23] serve the
[3:11:24] Lord better don't even know what they
[3:11:26] sayith and the preacher would call for
[3:11:28] an interpreter there there is to be no
[3:11:30] there doesn't have to be an interpreter
[3:11:33] when they're speaking mysteries in the
[3:11:35] spirit how are we going to know that we
[3:11:37] need some spiritual
[3:11:41] men
[3:11:44] we need some spiritual
[3:11:46] leaders some spiritual
[3:11:48] pastors that can call the critics and
[3:11:51] Skeptics down and say hold your peace
[3:11:54] that doesn't need an
[3:12:00] interpretation am I pasted my limit
[3:12:06] Benjamin but there are tongues that need
[3:12:08] to be interpreted and there's a Gifts of
[3:12:09] interpretation and you can read that now
[3:12:11] 1 Corinthians 14 for
[3:12:14] hurry he that speaketh in an unknown
[3:12:17] tongue edifieth himself okay but he that
[3:12:19] prophesieth edifieth the church okay
[3:12:22] that's not critical that that's not
[3:12:23] negative no no
[3:12:27] sir if the purpose of the
[3:12:30] spirit if the mind of the spirit is to
[3:12:33] edify the church if the will of the
[3:12:36] spirit is to edify the church it should
[3:12:38] be by tongues and interpretation which
[3:12:40] then becomes prophecy or it should be by
[3:12:43] prophetic utterance amen but if the
[3:12:46] purpose of the spirit if the mind of the
[3:12:47] spirit if the will of the spirit is to
[3:12:49] help that person build themselves up
[3:12:52] because they've been beat up drug around
[3:12:54] slapped bruised bloody cutting
[3:12:58] [Applause]
[3:12:59] bleeding I've got people in this church
[3:13:02] that that literally they they walk up
[3:13:04] here like everything's all right but if
[3:13:05] you could see
[3:13:06] them you'd see they're bleeding they're
[3:13:09] bloody they're bruised they're broken
[3:13:14] their lives are in a mess they're
[3:13:18] [Music]
[3:13:20] suffering but they come up anyway you
[3:13:23] can't always know what's going on so if
[3:13:26] they come up here to Worship the Lord
[3:13:28] and you happen to be standing by one of
[3:13:30] them and one of them starts saying in a
[3:13:33] fairly calm way not too loud not to draw
[3:13:37] the attention of the whole church but if
[3:13:39] you should hear one of those soldiers of
[3:13:42] the cross get up here and get in the
[3:13:44] spirit and the spirit start talking out
[3:13:45] of them sh
[3:13:47] sha ha la la
[3:13:52] la don't you sit in the seat of the
[3:13:56] scornful you have no idea how edified
[3:13:59] that person needs to
[3:14:02] be that's not selfed edification that's
[3:14:05] edification by the spirit that's not
[3:14:07] somebody trying to to get Pride or say
[3:14:09] oh look at me look at me that's somebody
[3:14:13] that's trying to keep their head above
[3:14:14] water I'm telling you if you'll start
[3:14:17] praying in tongues if you'll start
[3:14:18] praying in the spirit if when you go
[3:14:20] home tonight you'll pray in English

[3:14:50] was s years old I received the baptism
[3:14:52] of the Holy Ghost and spoke at tongues
[3:14:54] at the age of seven I spoke in tongues
[3:14:56] all night the next you don't have to you
[3:14:58] don't have to to get it but once you get
[3:15:00] it you will that's what he
[3:15:03] said uh I spoke in tongues all night I
[3:15:06] lay on a twin bed beside my back said
[3:15:08] granddaddy he woke up the next morning
[3:15:10] and said mild I've never seen anybody
[3:15:11] got a much of the Holy Ghost as that boy
[3:15:14] has got he has talked in tongues all
[3:15:15] night long I hadn't got a wink of
[3:15:18] sleep I woke up and went to the
[3:15:20] breakfast table and mama said big mama
[3:15:22] said you want milk or juice and I
[3:15:35] went somebody say you're offending me by
[3:15:38] the way you're using those Sy that's all
[3:15:40] they are if the spirit isn't saying them
[3:15:43] that's right that's all they are is
[3:15:45] syllables I don't encourage everybody to
[3:15:48] start going around doing that to one
[3:15:49] another and saying things like that I'm
[3:15:51] using that but I don't feel in any way
[3:15:53] like I'm in trouble no sir because if
[3:15:56] I'm just using it as a syllable that's
[3:15:58] all it is La La La but you let the Holy
[3:16:01] Ghost be in that and you don't know what
[3:16:04] you're
[3:16:06] saying you may be saying my me and my
[3:16:09] wife are going to have 12
[3:16:11] children
[3:16:16] and then your wife's going to call that
[3:16:18] a false
[3:16:22] tongue an Christine help
[3:16:25] me if Austin starts talking them
[3:16:27] Mysteries you go to shut him down I
[3:16:32] know he that speaketh in an unknown
[3:16:35] tongue edifieth himself but he that
[3:16:37] prophesieth edify the church that word
[3:16:39] means edify and amplifi it means edifies
[3:16:41] and proves himself builds himself up
[3:16:44] prophecy builds up the whole
[3:16:46] congregation and that's why I read Jud
[3:16:47] 20 building up yourselves on the Most
[3:16:49] Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost
[3:16:51] somebody needs to break
[3:16:53] through and pray in the Holy Ghost
[3:16:56] sometimes it's not it doesn't even seem
[3:16:58] to be a language at all I'm going to
[3:17:00] close with this Romans 8:26-27 likewise
[3:17:04] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
[3:17:06] read for me would you I got to breathe
[3:17:08] for we know not what we should pray for
[3:17:11] as we thoughts but the spirit itself
[3:17:14] maketh intercession intercession for us
[3:17:17] with groanings groanings which cannot be
[3:17:19] uttered by the way that word uttered
[3:17:21] there doesn't just mean sound it means
[3:17:25] understanding there are certain
[3:17:27] groanings in the spirit
[3:17:33] oh I'm just showing you a
[3:17:36] groan although I felt a little something
[3:17:38] in that one I'll tell you
[3:17:41] yes
[3:17:48] no
[3:17:49] syllables no seeming language just a
[3:17:53] guttle Gro
[3:17:55] oh I was standing by that man and he was
[3:17:58] growling like a bear call that the
[3:18:01] spirit you better be
[3:18:05] careful right it just gets all over me
[3:18:07] when they start groaning and moaning up
[3:18:10] there praying for one another no no it
[3:18:13] don't because if it got on you like you
[3:18:16] said it
[3:18:17] did you'd be groaning and moaning too
[3:18:20] when the spirit of the Lord fell on
[3:18:25] you you don't have to understand it just
[3:18:28] get out of its
[3:18:31] way right and he that searcheth the
[3:18:34] hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[3:18:36] spirit this is what's so wonderful about
[3:18:38] praying in the Holy Ghost when you're
[3:18:40] praying in the spirit granny said pray
[3:18:42] pray in English pray what you know pray
[3:18:43] what you know about the situation until
[3:18:45] the Holy Ghost comes and when the Holy
[3:18:47] Ghost comes let him pray and it might
[3:18:50] sound like a language it might sound
[3:18:51] like a groan it might sound like a moan
[3:18:53] it might be
[3:18:55] oh
[3:18:58] yeah it might be
[3:19:07] hallelu but guess what the spirit of God
[3:19:11] knows exactly what the mind of God
[3:19:14] is you are safer praying in the spirit
[3:19:16] than you are praying in the natural and
[3:19:19] and and therefore therefore you're safer
[3:19:21] I'm GNA say this I might as well you're
[3:19:23] safer praying in
[3:19:30] tongues many times I've walked over a
[3:19:34] deathbed and you don't know whether to
[3:19:35] pray God rais them
[3:19:37] up God come get them now you don't
[3:19:41] always know the mind of God that's right
[3:19:43] but if you're not
[3:19:44] ashamed if you yield
[3:19:47] yourself the spirit of God might just
[3:19:49] pray through
[3:19:50] you and when you get through you can
[3:19:52] walk out of there knowing that whatever
[3:19:54] was said went straight to the
[3:19:57] throne
[3:20:00] amen I got to hurry I got to hurry I got
[3:20:02] to hurry can I come back and finish this
[3:20:03] another time and do some more with this
[3:20:05] I'm skipping skipping ski this is the
[3:20:10] last well I I uh uh I got two things
[3:20:15] ahead just REM I I just I know some of
[3:20:18] you won't you won't hear the second part
[3:20:21] so 1 Corinthians 141 13-20 write that
[3:20:24] down because I want you to know that I
[3:20:26] know that there is a benefit to praying
[3:20:29] in the spirit and with
[3:20:31] understanding love it the Bible said
[3:20:34] sing in the spirit and sing with
[3:20:36] understanding that's real powerful when
[3:20:38] you start groaning in the spirit or
[3:20:40] praying in another language and God let
[3:20:41] let you know what you're praying
[3:20:44] woo you might shock yourself if God lets
[3:20:48] you know what the Holy Ghost is praying
[3:20:50] through you it might blow your mind you
[3:20:53] might say if I would have known that I
[3:20:55] was praying that I don't even think I
[3:20:57] had the faith to believe that God could
[3:20:58] do such a thing that the spirit was pray
[3:21:00] maybe God takes you out of your own mind
[3:21:02] sometime prays through you in the spirit
[3:21:04] and then lets you know what you pray
[3:21:06] with understanding so you say whoa I
[3:21:09] didn't even know I had the faith to
[3:21:10] believe such a thing does that sound
[3:21:12] reasonable to anybody I know it's
[3:21:18] late so I want to go over that with you
[3:21:21] another
[3:21:22] time but here's what I wanted to show
[3:21:26] you this is questions and
[3:21:29] answers if I promise you this will be
[3:21:31] the last will you listen how many of you
[3:21:34] give me your undivided attention if I
[3:21:35] promise you I don't know Pastor
[3:21:39] you you've stretched it a little time
[3:21:42] for two when you prayer paragraph 89 go
[3:21:45] to the highlighted part would you read
[3:21:49] this Ellas it's a lot of reading but I
[3:21:50] want you to get it through everybody
[3:21:51] listening yes sir sir get it out
[3:21:54] wherever you're in prayer wherever
[3:21:57] you're in
[3:21:58] prayer at your home at oh he's never
[3:22:02] going to get through with me stopping
[3:22:03] him I know but I want you to hear this
[3:22:05] at your home or wherever you are
[3:22:08] wherever you
[3:22:10] are speak then wait a
[3:22:14] minute wherever you are what if you're
[3:22:18] around the Altar and somebody hears
[3:22:22] you give them something to talk
[3:22:25] about I don't mean out loud that you're
[3:22:28] going to take the whole attention of the
[3:22:29] whole service you shouldn't do that
[3:22:31] unless you know you're going to be able
[3:22:33] to tell us what you're saying because
[3:22:35] what how do the rest of us get blessed
[3:22:37] by
[3:22:39] that but if you're happen to be up here
[3:22:42] and the spirit of God moves on you
[3:22:43] brother grey lays hands on you and you
[3:22:46] start thanking God in English and the
[3:22:47] next thing you know something else comes
[3:22:53] out we don't believe in teaching people
[3:22:55] to speak in tongues I saw them do that
[3:22:57] in Pentecost yes sir I saw them hold up
[3:22:59] their tie and say see my tie tie my tie
[3:23:01] you say that over and over again and and
[3:23:04] finally they'd say it to many times they
[3:23:05] start stumbling around and the old
[3:23:07] sisters just start say she's got it
[3:23:09] she's got it yeah
[3:23:13] got a twisted tongue but that's not
[3:23:15] necessarily the Holy
[3:23:17] Ghost read on wherever you are wherever
[3:23:21] you are speak then wherever you're in
[3:23:24] prayer at your house at your home or
[3:23:25] wherever you are speak then because he
[3:23:29] that speaketh in an unknown tongues
[3:23:31] edifieth himself brother Bram does seem
[3:23:33] to have a problem with you being edified
[3:23:35] that's right it gives him consolation
[3:23:39] gives him anybody ever need any
[3:23:41] consolation
[3:23:44] hello go ahead he feels good feel
[3:23:48] because he that ought to be
[3:23:51] outlawed Christian people ought not to
[3:23:54] feel
[3:23:55] good I think some people think that's
[3:23:58] the way it
[3:24:01] is you a you you're tired now you ain't
[3:24:04] going to help me go ahead go ahead go
[3:24:06] ahead because he is standing there
[3:24:09] praying and the first thing you know
[3:24:12] the Holy Spirit come upon he first thing
[3:24:14] you know or she and they begin to speak
[3:24:18] let's get that one in in Tong whoa whoa
[3:24:23] stop women
[3:24:29] can thank you Jesus your Prophet said a
[3:24:33] sister has every right to every
[3:24:36] spiritual gift except handling the
[3:24:40] word
[3:24:45] thank you well we all know that women
[3:24:48] are the weaker vessel right I agree
[3:24:51] right they ought to talk in tongues more
[3:24:53] than the
[3:24:57] men they're so weak they ought to be
[3:24:59] edifying building themselves up come
[3:25:07] on read I'm in
[3:25:10] trouble and their soul was rejoicing and
[3:25:14] happy because they spoke in tongues is
[3:25:17] that such a
[3:25:18] shame I think it sounds wonderful read
[3:25:21] on why that was wasn't just a sign that
[3:25:25] God wasn't going to answer wait a minute
[3:25:27] I think you're you're you're going to
[3:25:29] have to read that more carefully get the
[3:25:30] right words why that was that was really
[3:25:35] why son that's not really why it's why
[3:25:38] you know when you're talking you say why
[3:25:40] I understand understand you're not a
[3:25:43] southerner let me interpret brother
[3:25:45] bram's tongues for
[3:25:48] you that's why why that wasn't just a
[3:25:54] sign that God was going to answer the
[3:25:57] prayer that you was praying for but read
[3:26:01] it was a sign that the holy spirit's
[3:26:04] hearing you whoa stop stop right
[3:26:07] there here you started praying in eng
[3:26:09] and the Holy Spirit started praying uh
[3:26:11] for you through you for you that was not
[3:26:15] just a
[3:26:16] sign that God was going to answer your
[3:26:19] prayer that's one of the things it was
[3:26:20] yes sir boy if I say that they'll all
[3:26:22] start talking in tongues right now it
[3:26:24] was a sign that God was going to answer
[3:26:26] your prayer but look what else it was
[3:26:28] it's a sign that the holy spirit's
[3:26:30] hearing
[3:26:32] you he knows you read he's with you he's
[3:26:37] with you that's the same thing I would
[3:26:42] apply to this the Holy Spirit giving you
[3:26:45] a blessing what's wrong with
[3:26:48] that shouldn't the bride be blessed
[3:26:52] shouldn't all things be done in decency
[3:26:54] and order yes but shouldn't the bride be
[3:26:56] blessed sounds to me like it's a
[3:26:58] blessing to pray in the spirit sounds
[3:27:00] like it's a blessing to pray in the Holy
[3:27:02] Ghost seem like you're praying the will
[3:27:04] of God when you pray in the Holy Ghost
[3:27:06] all right now it's going to take you a
[3:27:07] while to read this so you better
[3:27:10] start here some time ago the last time I
[3:27:14] spoke with tongues wait a
[3:27:21] minute my Prophet my Prophet didn't
[3:27:24] speak in tongues so well why would I
[3:27:28] need to do such a thing as that well he
[3:27:29] may not have spoken tongues as often as
[3:27:34] some but he
[3:27:36] did and then if you want to know how
[3:27:38] that compares to the first church age
[3:27:39] messenger Paul said said I thank my God
[3:27:42] I speak in tongues more than all of
[3:27:45] you you just keep on murmuring I I have
[3:27:47] a feeling he was just almost daring them
[3:27:50] just keep your murmuring up I'm going to
[3:27:52] talk in tongues more than
[3:27:54] that oh
[3:27:56] yeah I've had to do
[3:27:59] it I sat in the camp
[3:28:01] meeting up the road there many years
[3:28:05] ago and I heard a preacher in the
[3:28:08] message talk about a Malachi 45 and6
[3:28:10] birth
[3:28:13] and I searched my Bible sitting there in
[3:28:15] that big crowd of Believers and I read
[3:28:17] Matthew 4:5 and 6 over and over I didn't
[3:28:20] see anything in there about a
[3:28:23] birth said that Spirit of Elijah would
[3:28:25] turn the hearts I I got all that I
[3:28:28] realized in a few minutes that that man
[3:28:31] was preaching that you need the new
[3:28:34] birth and then you need a Malachi 45 and
[3:28:37] six birth I don't even know what that is
[3:28:41] right
[3:28:43] if you do maybe you can help me but if
[3:28:45] the Bible New Birth is not enough to
[3:28:48] birth you from
[3:28:53] above you got a problem so I went up to
[3:28:57] him after the service and I went up to
[3:28:58] the pastor who was in charge of the big
[3:29:00] camp meeting who I happen to know spok
[3:29:02] in
[3:29:05] tongues and I pulled him to the side and
[3:29:07] I said can you please explain to me
[3:29:09] brother what a Malachi 4 you know having
[3:29:11] your eyes open to see the meage blah
[3:29:12] blah blah BL BL I said look that's you
[3:29:15] you're preaching something that's not
[3:29:16] even in the word that's not even in the
[3:29:17] Bible you're telling people they need a
[3:29:20] new birth they need the Holy Ghost
[3:29:22] plus right they need a revelation of who
[3:29:25] God is plus they need a revelation who
[3:29:27] the prophet
[3:29:28] is one revelation will lead you to the
[3:29:31] next Revelation you don't have to
[3:29:33] separate the
[3:29:34] experiences and you know what he said to
[3:29:36] me honest before God he said well
[3:29:39] brother surely I'm I hear that on
[3:29:42] occasion you're getting excited in the
[3:29:45] pulit and you speak a little bit in
[3:29:49] tongues what has that got to do with
[3:29:51] Malachi 45 and6
[3:29:53] birth I challenged him so he challenged
[3:29:56] me and I said brother I I have been
[3:30:05] guilty and I said I hope you'll pray for
[3:30:08] me that I can speak in tongues more than
[3:30:11] you
[3:30:15] [Applause]
[3:30:22] all CU Paul
[3:30:26] did you've done a lot of talking tonight
[3:30:28] about speaking in tongues I want you to
[3:30:30] think about the last 20 years of your
[3:30:31] experience in the message and I want you
[3:30:34] to tell me how many messages you've
[3:30:35] heard on the genuine gift of tongues or
[3:30:38] the genuine gift of praying in the
[3:30:40] spirit I want you to think of how many
[3:30:42] you have and then when when we can
[3:30:44] compare this three hours tonight come on
[3:30:48] yeah with the 20year
[3:30:51] absence then you can tell me I've
[3:30:53] overstepped my bounds this evening all
[3:30:56] right I doubt most of you have ever
[3:30:57] heard a
[3:30:58] sermon you may have heard excerpts in
[3:31:01] sermons but I doubt any of you have
[3:31:03] that's the reason why I felt like the
[3:31:05] spirit of the Lord was pressing me
[3:31:07] tonight and I hope that it will be a
[3:31:09] contagious fire
[3:31:11] yes sir and I hope men of God all over
[3:31:15] this
[3:31:16] nation and world will begin to show the
[3:31:19] people there couldn't even be a
[3:31:25] phony if there wasn't a genuine read on
[3:31:29] the last time I spoke in tongues as I
[3:31:32] can remember was it's a bit about three
[3:31:35] or four years ago it's been about three
[3:31:37] or four years ago now do you think that
[3:31:40] means
[3:31:41] that you're supposed to
[3:31:47] wait that was brother Brandon giving his
[3:31:49] testimony that doesn't have to be your
[3:31:52] testimony I'm going to tell you a
[3:31:55] secret I pray in tongues every day of my
[3:32:02] life I have for the last 48
[3:32:07] years never gone to bed I'm I know it
[3:32:11] sounds
[3:32:12] boasting but I have never gone to bed in
[3:32:15] these 48 years without knowing that some
[3:32:19] time during the day I prayed in English
[3:32:22] until the Holy Ghost took over and
[3:32:24] prayed through
[3:32:26] me it may be the reason why I'm still
[3:32:29] here
[3:32:31] tonight it may be the reason why I'm
[3:32:34] still preaching here tonight because he
[3:32:37] has strengthened me and sustained me and
[3:32:41] encouraged me when there was nobody else
[3:32:45] you've been there that's right you've
[3:32:47] been there you've been there when there
[3:32:50] was nobody to give you an encouraging
[3:32:53] word but the Holy Ghost would fall on
[3:32:56] you and you'd
[3:32:59] [Applause]
[3:33:04] [Music]
[3:33:09] feel
[3:33:21] [Music]
[3:33:34] [Music]
[3:33:38] tell me what you feel brother Shelly I
[3:33:40] feel
[3:33:41] strength coming into my
[3:33:43] body it's not about what you feel what
[3:33:47] did you just feel I just felt strength
[3:33:49] and virtue and
[3:33:53] consolation coming into my
[3:33:56] body Hallelujah that's how he's kept
[3:34:01] us I'm closed musicians
[3:34:06] coming I would have never known to do
[3:34:08] such a
[3:34:09] thing I would have never known to pray
[3:34:11] in English until the Holy Ghost prayed
[3:34:13] had it not been for my old
[3:34:17] granny they used to try to tell me my
[3:34:19] granny didn't have the Holy Ghost
[3:34:21] because she was a woman preacher I said
[3:34:22] you may not have
[3:34:26] it but she had the Holy Ghost and when
[3:34:29] the truth struck her
[3:34:31] heart amen and I challenged her on
[3:34:36] preaching she said I'll never do it
[3:34:39] again now you tell me whether she had
[3:34:41] the holy ghost or
[3:34:42] not you didn't even know her and you
[3:34:45] tell me whether she had it or not when
[3:34:46] the
[3:34:48] spirit when the spirit when he the
[3:34:50] spirit comes he will lead you and guide
[3:34:53] you and direct
[3:34:55] [Applause]
[3:35:04] you I've been seeing something don't
[3:35:07] strike this probably from the tape but
[3:35:09] I've been seeing something going around
[3:35:10] on social media about how the spirit of
[3:35:13] God was falling years ago and Men of God
[3:35:16] men of God would just kind of lift off
[3:35:18] the floor while they were
[3:35:22] preaching we need some of that Wonder
[3:35:26] workking we may never see that again may
[3:35:30] never but you be careful how you
[3:35:32] criticize it there was a whole church in
[3:35:34] gelico Tennessee that fell under the
[3:35:36] inspiration of the Holy Ghost the church
[3:35:39] was called Church of God of the mountain
[3:35:41] assembly and everybody in the church had
[3:35:42] long uncut beards they were not Amish
[3:35:45] but it was a tradition in that church
[3:35:46] and the Holy Ghost would come and not
[3:35:48] one but many there were times that the
[3:35:50] spirit of the Lord would fill that room
[3:35:51] with a blue cloud and there were many
[3:35:53] people who were seen standing off the
[3:35:56] floor as the Holy Ghost came in a cloud
[3:35:59] and lifted them up
[3:36:01] now now
[3:36:03] now on I don't believe in such things as
[3:36:07] that good good you'll never experience
[3:36:09] it
[3:36:14] you'll never have to worry about it you
[3:36:16] don't have to lift off the ground I'm
[3:36:18] not saying something silly like that no

[3:36:22] man's lifted when that Holy Ghost comes
[3:36:23] on you but don't you limit God this

[3:44:51] chaar do you know that's God's voice did

[3:44:56] when that chofar sounds God's voice is
[3:44:58] in the chofar did you know they also
[3:45:01] believe that when they sound the chofar
[3:45:03] it's the voice of the people responding
[3:45:05] to God I will I will I will obey I'll go
[3:45:09] did you know the Jewish people believe
[3:45:11] that when that chofar sounds it confuses
[3:45:13] the Demons of hell and the devil is
[3:45:15] confused when that sounds and the Demons
[3:45:18] Run Away did you know that did anybody
[3:45:21] know that about the
[3:45:22] chofar no no interpret did you know
[3:45:25] that's one of the benefits of praying in
[3:45:27] the Holy Ghost the devil doesn't know
[3:45:29] what's being
[3:45:31] said sir the last quote put it up the
[3:45:34] last one the last one the last of the
[3:45:36] notes
[3:45:38] yeah
[3:45:43] look grandma was
[3:45:48] slow what did you turn it off when I
[3:45:50] said I'm
[3:45:51] done big
[3:45:53] mistake you've got a song Ready
[3:45:58] right seventh
[3:46:03] seal and in Sabino Canyon he said this
[3:46:07] is the third pool I'm going to read this
[3:46:08] one sh
[3:46:17] and there's three great things that goes
[3:46:22] with it yeah amen one unfolded today or
[3:46:26] yesterday the other one unfolded today
[3:46:29] and there's one
[3:46:33] thing listen
[3:46:35] preachers come on yeah on
[3:46:40] don't you brothers be you that are here
[3:46:42] please take my advice don't be getting
[3:46:45] up there telling the people that you
[3:46:47] know everything about the third pull and
[3:46:49] you know everything about the seven
[3:46:51] seal right because you're going to make
[3:46:54] yourself somebody you're
[3:46:57] not here's what the prophet
[3:47:00] said the other one unfolded today and
[3:47:03] there's one thing that I canot in
[3:47:11] interpret yeah because it's an
[3:47:15] unknown language
[3:47:18] amen but I stand right there and look
[3:47:21] right straight at it and this is the
[3:47:25] third pull coming up and brother Bram
[3:47:27] knocks on the pull pit three times and
[3:47:28] the Holy Spirit of God oh
[3:47:31] my if you don't think he's talking about
[3:47:33] the seventh seal he's preaching the
[3:47:35] seventh seal but if you don't think he's
[3:47:36] talking about the seventh seal he wants
[3:47:38] to remind you he's talking about the
[3:47:39] seven con seal oh my that's the reason
[3:47:42] all Heaven yes was
[3:47:45] silent the third part of the third pool
[3:47:48] has something to do with the 30 minutes
[3:47:51] of silence Before the Throne I don't
[3:47:53] know what it is but there's a connection
[3:47:57] so every time you hear preacher say
[3:47:59] we've got we know it all we know all
[3:48:00] about it we know all about it we know
[3:48:01] everything about the seven seal because
[3:48:03] it's in the message brother B said so
[3:48:04] brother B said we know it all he may
[3:48:06] have said
[3:48:07] that he may have made made reference to
[3:48:10] that but when he was preaching the seven
[3:48:13] seal that's when the angel was supposed
[3:48:15] to be with him that's
[3:48:17] right right when he was preaching this I
[3:48:21] got one one come to this other one came
[3:48:23] but he said that third that I could not
[3:48:25] make it out it was in an unknown
[3:48:28] tongue he said in the Holy oh my that's
[3:48:31] the reason all heaven was silent is that
[3:48:32] all ear L more now I better stop right
[3:48:35] here see I just feel checked not to say
[3:48:38] no more about it
[3:48:41] when you tell me you know it all when
[3:48:43] you get up and preach that we know
[3:48:45] everything there is to know about the
[3:48:46] seven seal and when you get up and
[3:48:48] preach that we know everything there is
[3:48:50] to know about the seven
[3:48:54] Thunders you're missing one huge
[3:48:57] important piece of the pie yeah
[3:49:02] yeah so just remember the seven
[3:49:06] seal the reason it was not
[3:49:14] opened but I heard brother brandham say
[3:49:16] many times it was open Seven Seals Seven
[3:49:18] Seals sometimes he said six sometimes he
[3:49:20] said seven I heard brother Bram say many
[3:49:22] times that that seven seal was open well
[3:49:24] here you hear him saying that there was
[3:49:27] one
[3:49:28] part of that seventh
[3:49:31] seal that he did not know what it
[3:49:37] meant it went by him and a unnown thank
[3:49:42] you he said see the reason it did not
[3:49:44] reveal it no no
[3:49:49] one please forgive me top 10
[3:49:52] preachers no
[3:49:54] one
[3:49:57] yes no one should know about
[3:50:00] it when God wants to send a
[3:50:04] secret that he don't want nobody to know
[3:50:07] about when the spirit of God wants to
[3:50:10] pray through you and he don't even want
[3:50:12] the devil to know what you're saying
[3:50:15] he'll do it in an
[3:50:17] Unown
[3:50:19] tongue the reason that the third part of
[3:50:23] the seven seal was not revealed the
[3:50:25] reason why there was 30 minutes of
[3:50:27] silence in heaven is because it was not
[3:50:29] to be known you'll hear brother brandom
[3:50:32] saying in another Play The Devil could
[3:50:34] do great
[3:50:38] damage
[3:50:39] amen if you got a hold of this is that
[3:50:42] all the
[3:50:43] quote let's
[3:50:48] stand we need to pray in the Holy
[3:50:53] Ghost we need to pray in the Holy Ghost
[3:50:55] you can't manufacture it but I want to
[3:50:58] know how many of you know you have the
[3:51:00] baptism of the Holy
[3:51:04] Ghost I'm waiting on
[3:51:07] you how many of you know you have the
[3:51:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost you may not
[3:51:11] have the gift of
[3:51:13] tongues or the gift of interpretation
[3:51:16] but how many of you know you've got the
[3:51:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you do you
[3:51:20] can pray in the
[3:51:24] spirit I believe you see when they kept
[3:51:27] telling us that some people don't have
[3:51:29] the gift of tongues gift of tongues some
[3:51:30] people don't have the gift of Tong some
[3:51:31] people don't get the gift of that's
[3:51:33] right they don't give message in
[3:51:36] tongues but brother ROV said when you
[3:51:38] receive receive the baptism of the Holy
[3:51:41] Ghost you will you
[3:51:45] will not tongues and then Holy Ghost
[3:51:48] Holy Ghost and then the tongues will
[3:51:50] follow even if you don't have a gift of
[3:51:52] tongues that's that's right you're
[3:51:54] afraid to say Amen because you think I'm
[3:51:57] going to preach another
[3:51:58] [Music]
[3:52:00] hour thank you I believe you mean
[3:52:05] it so when they when they try to
[3:52:07] discourage us
[3:52:09] by saying everybody don't have a gifted
[3:52:11] tongue that's right amen amen amen we
[3:52:14] believe it but we believe that every
[3:52:16] person who receives the genuine baptism
[3:52:19] of the Holy Ghost at some time or
[3:52:21] another if they yield themselves to that
[3:52:23] spirit of God within them he will
[3:52:26] testify
[3:52:30] amen yours may not sound like mine mine
[3:52:33] might may not sound like yours it may
[3:52:35] not come when mine comes mine may not
[3:52:37] come when your come some may get it the
[3:52:40] same night some may get it 25 years
[3:52:45] later there's quite a few people in this
[3:52:48] church that had the holy ghost that
[3:52:50] believed the truth that never spoke in
[3:52:52] tongues until they got in an atmosphere
[3:52:54] where it was
[3:52:57] legal you'd be surprised what a legal
[3:53:00] atmosphere will
[3:53:01] [Music]
[3:53:05] do it'll cause the illegal hatch out you
[3:53:07] get the atmosphere right
[3:53:10] so I want us I want us to I want us to
[3:53:12] do what the scripture says I want us to
[3:53:14] earnestly contend for the best gift I
[3:53:16] want us to ask
[3:53:17] God on to take us to the place in his
[3:53:24] Spirit where we as a people wherever you
[3:53:27] worship can begin to pray in the spirit
[3:53:31] sometimes
[3:53:32] English and sometimes in a language that
[3:53:37] we have never learned amen because there
[3:53:39] are things that the spirit of God wants
[3:53:41] to release out of you and through you
[3:53:43] that he didn't want the devil to know
[3:53:44] nothing about and the next time you're
[3:53:46] home praying alone and and a sound
[3:53:49] begins to you let it
[3:53:53] go you may be prophesying Mysteries over
[3:53:55] your own life hello let's
[3:54:00] worship
[3:54:01] I'm I'm I'm sorry that it's so late I am
