thank you jesus for loving me even though you know me thank you for loving me lord he does you may be seated this morning it's wonderful to see you in the house of the lord he's here with us his presence is here the worship was wonderful and we appreciate what god is doing shifting the atmosphere and we appreciated him we know that it's him we we send the praises and the worship up it's up to him to release the blessing and he is a god who blesses us if we have a heart to receive it it's here he's here amen uh we are so thankful some who have been away for some days are back with us we're glad to have them back some that were with us and didn't leave are have now gone on vacation and we're uh sad not to see them here this morning but we're praying for them and uh the tebow family is missing this morning and ashley and david also and zion is in mexico with solomon's family i think they're in the mountains tebow family and uh different ones are moving here and there it's good to have jenna with us this morning from dallas god bless you here for a few days brother greeley is in maryland to attend the funeral of his first cousin tomorrow a pastor's wife who passed away she had meant a lot to a lot of people and we've been praying for that family that god will comfort them and i have always said propolis but i'm told that they pronounce it pra propolis and so um they she is the daughter of brother earl heist who for so many years pastored a church in this message and brother earl heist was a brother to mama greeley brother his wife that's right that's right his wife brother earl heist's wife was a sister to brother greeley's mom and so they have many many years of wonderful fellowship and relations and the church this morning must really be broken and we want to lift every one of them up for prayer a dear friend of ours christine potter went home to be with the lord and uh it's just a real shock um because you know you get in your mind you don't like to think these things but you get in your mind that maybe you're you know you you look at a couple and you say well she'll be here forever and and and she'll live long enough to bury her husband you know these thoughts might come to your mind but you just don't ever know what god has and we just admit we we just admit full disclosure that christine was one of the most unusual people that we ever met in our lives and uh but we believe that she loved the lord and she showed so much respect for what we believe she did not follow this message but she had tremendous respect for the ministry of brother branham she had tremendous respect for the standard that we kept in this church and we have so many stories that have never been told of times that she has called our home when we were in desperate need of prayer and god would lay us on her heart and she would call and pray for us we didn't always come to the pulpit and say christine called this week to pray but we appreciate every prayer that she ever prayed if you didn't know christine then you have perhaps sung some of her husband's songs i think the only one we've ever done much here is show me thy face lord and uh don is going to need our prayers so we are there the memorial for christine is today and so we want to pray for him and uh he has had an unusual influence in music he's a tremendous musician and a very talented man and uh god used him tremendously in helping to save the life of wynonna judd if anybody knows who that is he was used in a mighty way so our hearts are with that family today we didn't take time for prayer requests because as ben said there was just something that said now is the time just not to disturb that but there are many prayer requests that have come in sister joyce's dad stands in desperate need of prayer today in the hospital and sister nakisha reached out this morning for a cousin sister megan reached out that we would pray for lyle who lost his wife susan and it's going to be a hard time through the holidays and their wedding anniversary coming up and ben mentioned that zach is in the hospital he is doing some better now he had a turn for the worse during the week after eating some solid food uh even that it was at the doctor's uh permission and and they're trying to see what would happen and what happened wasn't good and uh but he is recovering and said last night that he was feeling a good bit better but still in the hospital not exactly sure when he will come home perhaps tomorrow but you know he sent a right now in his condition he needs to be watched and cared for and taken care of and uh i i like the fact that god uses things like this to kind of speak to our heart he just softens us in him and i'm only saying that because i made a comment to him this week we were there and then in phone calls and text as well but i made a comment to him this week about regretting that he wasn't able to see the children because they won't allow them anywhere near the hospital it seems and uh his comments back to me were a little personal perhaps but i would just say that he is contemplating how close it was 30 of the people who suffer with a perforated bowel like that expire they pass away from that condition that's 30 percent that's pretty high and so you get to thinking about that and think about the fact that to say goodbye to your children the last time you know and god spare you and let you be with them well he knows how to cause us to understand how fragile life is and how much we have to be thankful for how many of you know we are we are a blessed blessed blessed people so if we missed any of the prayer requests and i'm sure we did because my phone was blowing up this morning with many many needs and we know that god sees them all today is sister louise weir's birthday and uh in new brunswick she's uh her and brother harold are faithful supporters of this ministry and uh faithful streamers through the years and wonderful hosts and hostess and we send her our love today we appreciate her friendship monday is brother greeley's birthday he dodges the bullet today don't don't don't have to be congratulated over and over again hand shook neck hugged but we'll get him won't we we'll get him pray for him as he travels home on tuesday i guess monday night at 11 o'clock so let's uh pray that he has a safe trip and then on thursday of this week abigail has a birthday is that right are you you're still young enough you can give us a number 18. she hesitated not happy birthday to abigail same day as rj's birthday on thursday so we say happy birthday to rj and sister rebecca will you tell matthew happy birthday for us on thursday as well and uh that we love him and we miss him and we're praying for him god's just good to us did i miss anything i didn't have a lot of time to do the calendar look all right let's stand i want to sing a little something let's see what we could sing do i have a microphone here somewhere well i don't guess i really need it do i just sing just a little let's sing uh what a day that will be let's just sing a verse in the chorus maybe of that i don't really have to have this do it there is coming a day when old heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky let me hear you no more tears come on sing it out and forever we're the one who died for me oh what a day what a glorious day that will be has anybody got their eyes on that day we're looking toward that what a day that will be when my [Music] jesus oh when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and he'll take me by the hand and lead me through the promised land what a day what a glorious day that will be there'll be no sorrow there no more birds to bear no more sickness no pain no more parting over there and forever i will be with [Music] the one who died for me what a day what a glorious day that will be sing it out this morning oh what a [Music] when day jesus oh when i look upon his face the one who saved me [Music] oh and he takes me by the hand leads me through the promised land what a day what a glorious day that will be is anybody still looking forward to that i am thank you to the musicians thank you so much god bless you you know i just uh you're i know you're standing but you'll you'll be sitting in a moment and uh you'll probably wish you were standing some point but i uh i sister is that your sister who is this sister standing there is she with you on the end there yes okay steven's brother's girlfriend i might twist it up if i say it again so you are very welcome very welcome very glad to have you and your daughter i guess [Applause] [Music] i didn't think you looked like sister jeanette's sister but i just wasn't sure who you were but you're so welcome and it's always nice when visitors come and they worship and they worship they enter in you don't have to be a stranger in the presence of the lord he takes care of us i made a list this week for you and it won't take me but a moment to call it out because when i try to look here at the who's streaming i can only see a few at a time so if i'm standing here scrolling i miss some so this is from last sunday these are the places that are represented in canada we had british columbia alberta new brunswick and saskatchewan streaming the service last sunday in in the other nations we had belgium belgium and we're praying for our sister in belgium this morning who's in the hospital and she's streaming the service i saw we had the congo england germany ghana india ireland japan kenya madagascar netherlands norway pakistan romania south africa trinidad uganda and the united arab emirates isn't that wonderful now these are only those who tell us if they don't post their location they could be watching from anywhere so there may be twice this amount and in the united states alabama alaska arizona california florida georgia indiana mississippi missouri nevada oklahoma pennsylvania south carolina and virginia do you all believe it's getting out it's getting out let's thank the lord for that god bless every one of you and all the others who didn't mention and i see some old friends streaming today and god bless every one of you from wherever you're from we see indiana and trinidad and vancouver and and it goes on but god bless you all turn in your bible to isaiah chapter 54 and verse 17. you know this verse you've got it on plaques and i don't know what all else bible covers and i don't know memory boxes and maybe you have it in art and hanging on the wall and maybe carrying a little card in your pocket that says this verse you probably don't need any preaching on it this morning but you'll have a little anyway verse 17 said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper come on and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn sister sharon didn't know this text when she let the lord use her this morning this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord because we don't have any in ourself if we carry any righteousness it is the righteousness of the lord you believe that don't you can i read that in the amplified while you're still standing if you're able if not please sit down and just in rest yourself but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall know you shall show to be in the wrong this peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the servants of the lord you have a heritage this morning those in whom the ideal servant of the lord is reproduced who do you think that is that's jesus this is the righteousness or the vindication which they obtain from me this is that which i impact excuse me impart to them as their justification says the lord let me read that if you'll go back one let me read the end of that again this peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the servants of the lord those in whom the ideal servant of the lord is reproduced this is the righteousness or the vindication which they obtained from me this is that which i impart to them as their justification says the lord oh my i i there's something about that i feel that we don't always feel physically i felt something going up and down my legs as i was reading the truth of god's word this is what he offers us his righteousness as our justification aren't you glad you're justified just if i'd never sinned isn't he wonderful can you pardon me just a moment i was going to do this but i hated to do it during worship sometimes i have to but i saw that i right where that word was i needed there was a big spot there that's my excuse and i'm sticking with it all right the truth is i need healing and and a new prescription probably in the meantime but i won't make you wait for me to clean my watch and phone too okay i usually use those till all the juices out of them let's pray this morning father thank you for your word it is life to us it is help and strength and holy holy brings your holy presence to us we know we're not living this life by feeling but oh it's good it's so good when we can perceive your presence touching our body it just reminds us that you're god's sovereign and that you have power to move upon us lord if we never felt you in that way again we know today your word is all we need to get us through we're not trusting in any sensation but how we thank you lord that sometimes it's just your desire that we experience you in a tangible way lord come today give us grace in your word bind up the hand of the enemy and allow your word to go forth today and accomplish all that it is sent forth to do in the precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the church said you may be seated no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper i want to preach this morning don't be the weapon that is formed against yourself now i sent this out a year or so ago the little little picture with that phrase and you'd be surprised how many people can relate to that but since we are in a time of looking again at the greatest battle ever fought and we are rediscovering that the battlefield of that battle is our human mind and that is why we have to continue to renew our mind we have to continue to come and allow the oil of the holy spirit to be poured over our mind cleansing our thoughts and quickening us to think with his mind we must make a choice i wished it was once and for all but it's not once and for all we have to keep making a choice i'm taking the mind of the lord i'm going to use the mind of the lord i'm going to think with the mind of jesus christ and so i love the fact that god has made a way to give us his mind he's also made a way for us to renew our mind so that it can surrender to his will to his thought to his word and the the truth is we have a devil there's a devil out there how many of you know it there's a devil out there he comes to church he shows up with us anywhere you are he's there he comes if he can't get there himself because he is a as a created being is not um omnipresent but if he can't get there he sends imps he was able to persuade a third of the angels to follow his rebellion and they're there and they operate and they work and they touch the atmosphere we understand that satan uh the god of this evil age brother branham called him he called where we're living now satan's eden because the enemy has as the prince of the power of the air he has authority over this earth but the real authority over this earth belongs to the bride you can say amen or old me or i'm not sure about that it's jesus it's his authority it's the bridegroom's authority it's residing in the bride and one of these days the enemy is going to lose this he's going to lose it we're going to have the authority for out all throughout all eternity the bible said we will rule and reign with him we will be given a place in his throne judging angels and nations and those who come before him will experience this judgment that comes from his wife the bride of jesus christ but in this hour it seems that the enemy is loosed from the second heaven that's where the air is that's the atmosphere above the earth somewhere in the spirit realm we know that he has a throne there we know that there are all kinds of powers and principalities all kinds of spiritual wickedness in high places territorial spirits generational spirits we have an enemy there's no doubt about it but we also discover in this hour that we can easily become our greatest enemy i wish you were awake wish you could hear this because i'm talking to you you do not want to be the enemy that's formed against your own life you want to make sure that you are not cooperating with the accuser and accusing yourself because jesus has sent his righteousness to justify you when you have put your trust in him if you believe that say amen so we search our hearts today we've been searching our lives we've been searching our minds we've been asking the lord show us how we can claim the victory that you have already given us over our own mind possessing our own thoughts pulling down strongholds and casting aside every imagination and all those thoughts that like to exalt themselves above the knowledge of jesus christ so we are asking god this morning lord show me in any way that i have become the enemy that's marching against my own life do not be the enemy that's being formed against yourself but recognize that the bible said no weapon no weapon formed against thee shall prosper god has promised victory over all of our enemies and that includes we used to have an old sister i've told you about her many times she worked at crystal you ever been to crystal oh you hear you heard sister said ooh sister beth once a year i have to have one or two or three or four once a year that's all i need that's all i can handle but i sometime you pass by there and they're venting that onion smell and and you you just have to taste them this little sister worked uh for years at crystal she knew all their secrets she lived alone she had a son who was kind of a loner and he lived near her and she was a little bit of an eccentric woman and since i said that i won't call her name unless i already did but she was a dear friend to our family she attended our church she had a sharp tongue she loved the lord she had to be worked on just like all of us one time she was called out and told if you can d deal i said i don't know if i want to repeat it exactly like it was said but one time she was called out and told that her tongue was as long as her hair you say that woman probably got mad never come back to church no no she'd been in this thing too long to let something like that put her off she said that ain't nothing but the truth now god help me what should i do lay it on the altar she said i've got to get help from that she'd be real honest josh when she would testify she'd stand up and she'd say uh well i have trouble sometime with folks she said i work in a in a quick environment that i have to be on my toes and i'm getting a little older and and sometimes they snip at me and i snap at them and and she said but i want to tell you today that my worst enemy is the woman who lives between my two elbows i want to tell you that sometimes your worst enemy is not the devil he actually is anointing you and you are the biggest problem you've got and you're living between these two elbows but i want to tell you i want to tell the enemy i want to tell every imp that's listening that jesus has given us power over all the powers of the enemy and we are waking up to the fact that we sometimes become the weapon that's being formed against our own lives we sabotage ourselves because we don't take god at his word we are carrying baggage that we should have left at the feet of jesus years and years ago we're dragging dead bodies around our neck that we should have cut off many years ago so that we could stand before god in victory come on you know i just had a hard time last sunday i was struggling and it was sleepy in here and and i was just working harder than i liked to work and i was in pain and uh the ibuprofen wasn't doing it and the lord didn't see fit to move it just then and and there was just a lot going on but i did the best i could and my granny told me years ago but i forget it sometime she said when you feel like you do the least sometimes that's because god's doing the most and he wants you to know it's not you anyway you can't help nobody you can't help nobody but if you let him get in he'll help and i'm only mentioning that to tell you that there were so many nitty-gritty nitty-gritty testimonies that came in this week from people who saw some things that they had not seen before and they decided i've got to do something about it you know they tell us that somewhere back in the ancient times if a man killed a man in certain cultures and societies they were they believed in the in capital punishment they they believe what the bible says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and they would bring a different form of execution than what we know as capital punishment today we're told that in certain circumstances the dead corpse of the person that they had murdered would be tied on their back and they would have to live now i don't know they probably didn't go many places but if they chose to go wherever they went that old dead body had to go with them how many of you think that sounds disgusting well i want you to know there are people in this house today there are people streaming this service today that are carrying old dead bodies on their back they're rotting they're they're they're putrid they're decaying they're full of bacteria their vulture bait or buzzard bait and yet we carry it because we refuse to take the opportunity that god has given us to cut it loose and let it go you are not the murderer anymore you're not the guilty anymore if you've been justified by the righteous blood of jesus christ you're not that man anymore condemned to death you don't have to die for your past you don't have to die for yesteryear jesus said i am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly let the past be the past let the blood of jesus cut you off from where you were and who you were amen and do not continue to carry that thing any longer you can just imagine how it would smell you just walk through an alabama summer with a dead body on your back you just go down and roll your window down when you're passing road kill about july you'll find out that it's a smell that's almost overwhelming and yet for some amount of time they say that man would have to carry that smell on his back i know you hadn't had lunch and maybe i should tell this right as we release you so that you'd eat a little less today for lunch but i want you to know those bacterium working in there blowflies the little larva you know what you call them little wiggle things i can't hardly say the word without feeling nauseous all over i'm being honest i'm going to just i'm not gonna say the word but you know what i mean they just work you can imagine that man carrying all of that dead weight on his back with all of that going on the the purpose was to to kill him but a a quick death a hanging or a shooting or a decapitation would have been a quick death they figured that this would be a a greater deterrent when when people knew what was going to happen to them if they committed such a crime then they would be less likely to commit a crime like that themselves the problem is it could be a slow death it could be a painful death as his own body began to respond to the rot of that thing that he was carrying i'm preaching to you about the condition of so many people around you who are rotting in sin who are decaying under the influence of the god of this evil age who are under the influence of satan and his imps out there in this world dying slowly every day not even realizing sometimes the slow death that's taking place in them but you are not so you are not so if you're the children of god if you have been bought with a price if you have repented of your sin and have been baptized in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ if you have received the baptism of the holy ghost who still walks and talks in his bride then you are not living the slow death it is no longer your responsibility to carry the dead weight of the carnage even though you are responsible in that hour in that time once upon a time you were the guilty party that death is because of you but the blood of jesus christ sets us free there is only one sin that is an unpardonable sin we say and that is blasphemy against the holy ghost nine times out of ten maybe ten out of ten if somebody ever came around and said i'm afraid i'm very very afraid that i have blasphemed the holy ghost i usually send them on their way in a better frame of mind because almost every time you can tell them what makes you think that well i just i just feel so worried i just i just feel so concerned i know what i did and then we have the glorious pleasure of telling him you take this to god you pray about it but the likelihood is if you had sinned away your opportunity of grace you wouldn't care where you were how you lived how you felt your god-consciousness would no longer be there you'd no longer even be conscious of the fact that there was a better way to live in fact the bible talks about those who end their life in that condition in a reprobate state in that they did not like to retain god in their knowledge he turned them over to a reprobate mind to believe a lie and to be damned this is the end result of those who blaspheme the holy ghost this is the end result if you take it in context it's the end result of the spirit of homosexuality that's taken over our land today because this is a perversion that is rooted in pride and pride is the sin that destroyed sodom and gomorrah just because you can have it just because you can do it just because you can get a hold of it doesn't mean it's yours it doesn't mean it's right it doesn't mean it's god's ordained way say amen we know a man can lay with a man a woman can lay with a woman but that doesn't make it right that doesn't make it part of god's plan sometimes we have to say i i have that maybe that urge maybe there's something going on emotionally in my life but i must not yield to any kind of temptation i believe with every temptation god does what he makes a way of escape what i'm here to tell you today is as children of god we must cut ourselves loose from all that we're carrying that dead body that corpse of your past will eat at you until it destroys your today your past will eat up your today if you should allow it to be so is anybody with me you do not have to be your worst enemy you can give that back to the devil you don't have to help him you don't have to cooperate with him don't be the weapon that's formed against yourself now in psalms 141-3 and i got to get moving here in a hurry psalm 141-3 it says set a watch set a watch oh lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips did you know our mouth is one of the ways that we can become the weapon that's formed against ourselves words are thoughts expressed you won't say it if you're not thinking it if somebody's saying it it's because they're thinking it out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh whatever is in there is going to come out i'm not one of those who buys into this idea those who talk such crude profanity i'm not one of those who believe such an idea as that just slipped out i don't know where that come from that wasn't in there i don't know how that come out of me it came out of you because it was in you i wish i could get a little more help it came out of you because it was in you and god knows how to go down into the root of who you are and cut that out of you so that it'll never slip out of your mouth again because it's not a thought in your mind because he's painted your mind with calvary's blood said a watch o lord before my mouth keep the doors of my lips now look at this in the amplified it says set a guard oh lord before my mouth keep watch at the door of my lips you know this is submission this is surrender this is honesty this is transparency this is david saying i can't always do it by myself sometimes i think something i shouldn't think and sometimes i say something i shouldn't say there's no cover up here david is saying lord i need you i need you to help me i need you to set a guard oh lord before my mouth i need you to be a watchman at my lips i need your help to keep from saying the things that i sometimes say that are not pleasing to you i confess that i can't do it by myself i don't know about you but if we can come to that place where we could say lord sometime no matter how hard i try i think a thought i don't want to think i say a word express something that i don't want to express or express it in a way that i don't want to express it you you know there are times that we can take time to say the truth in a tactful way and there's sometimes we don't care enough because we really don't care what it does we don't really care who it affects we don't really care how it makes somebody feel how many of you know it's better to take a little time the lord is not going to keep you from saying it he is not going to come and put a muzzle in your mouth most of the time and keep you from being able to say it but i'll tell you what he'll do he'll check your mouth he'll check your lips he'll cause you to feel something down on the inside that says you just need to slow down just a minute before you really make a big mess because how many of you know if it's in here you can just plunge it beneath the blood repent and never have to get it out in the open but once it comes out of here the enemy will then take those words and use them against the person they were intended for and not only that he'll turn them around and use them to your own destruction he will condemn you for your humanity and whip you all over town until you become your worst accuser or the worst weapon that is formed against you so god's giving us a way to to to uh help ourselves he's giving us this offer david is saying lord i got to have you here to help me guard to help me look out to help me watch now i want to ask you a question here how can we act as an enemy toward ourselves well there's lots of ways i want to name a few this morning and they're going to be familiar to you because we've been talking about them for some time now number one by holding on to our stinking thinking as we hold on to our wrong thinking we become an enemy to ourselves if you're building a weapon from the inside it's very hard to get rid of that weapon from the inside until you recognize what you're doing usually we're more uh you know aware of what's coming out and what's going out of our life sometimes we're not really as aware of what's going on on the inside and yet we need to be very aware of the thoughts that we are thinking because the thoughts that we are thinking they are creating our reality just because you think it doesn't make it true come on i need help just because you think it doesn't make it so just because you think it doesn't make it reality but the enemy will convince you that because you thought it it has to be the truth proverbs 23 and 7 you know it it said for as he thanketh in his heart for as he thinketh in his heart so is he that word thinketh there in the hebrew doesn't just mean a passing thought it means to calculate to reckon to split it open to act as a gate keeper this is not the thought like we talked about the bird flying over your head this is talking about the thought that finds its lodging place on the inside this is the one you allowed to build a nest in your hair you give him a roost and now that thought is sinking deep into who you are until you're really becoming what you think because this is what the scripture's saying here as you think in your heart as you ponder and calculate in your mind so you are so if you think that you're a loser capable of nothing then that is exactly what you become a loser capable of nothing somebody said i think that's like you know power of positive thinking and new age and all that no no no it's bible it's what the bible said it's what we've been taught in the message of the hour that the greatest battle the last great battle of the church ages is the battle up here in our mind so but but here's the problem we say well here it is satan puts a thought satan does this satan injects himself satan comes and does so and so what we fail to realize is sometimes we are in so much cooperation with him he doesn't even have to march against us we're marching against ourselves because we refuse to take god's truth as our reality and we form an altered reality an alternative reality and that one is rooted in condemnation and it's rooted in accusation and it's rooted in your destruction and in your defeat but you do not have to be defeated by your thoughts remember this to the degree that god is on your mind coming up out of your spirit remember this controlling your thoughts is to the degree that god is working in your life you say wait a minute mind control no god being able to be the gatekeeper that david asked him to be if you and i will allow god he will direct our thoughts away from where they've been he will help us pull ourselves back to the reality of god's word if we could just catch ourselves in the moment if we could just apply the five-second rule you think a thought you ponder that for five seconds you decide how you're going to let that thought affect you if you recognize it to be a lie then you march right in and place that in the garbage bin and you say i reject that you old dirty thought you have no lodging place in my life i know that's a dirty lie right out of the pit of hell if you do not do that but you engage that thought and think it another time it becomes a part of your thinking process and therefore when things happen in your life instead of coming back to god's truth you'll come back to what you were already thinking god says i want to come and watch over your thoughts i want to come and watch over your words i believe that i believe david knew exactly what he was doing asking the lord to come and set up this guard set up this protection i want to read just very quickly are you still here i want to read very quickly some of the very short statements that we have made about thoughts over the last few weeks and we're going to move on if if our mind doesn't change our life won't change change your mind change your words change your words you change your life watch your thoughts they become our actions and then eventually our actions become how we walk out our destiny here's what we said last week and i tell you i i've been pondering this and working on this all through the week thoughts create your moods wait a minute i'm not going to just let that i'm going to keep let's ponder that a minute anybody have a bad mood this week just let me dry this it is wet let me dry my connection here just a moment that must look kind of ridiculous you catch yourself in a bad mood anxious or angry maybe you felt taken advantage of if i keep naming them we'll hit them all won't we and you realize this is this is where i am this is where my thoughts are your mood begins to reflect what you're thinking did you know there's a way to change your mood it's not go get a piece of chocolate cake that won't last oh it actually really does last the easiest way to change the mood you're in is to change your thoughts [Music] i don't know about you you probably didn't struggle with this maybe you did did you have some jealous thoughts did you see somebody else prospering in a certain way or getting along in a certain way and something in you a little envy rose up and you begin to find yourself stewing in a mood of rejection and looked over and i don't know what all else comes with that but you find yourself in a bad mood a sad mood a depressed mood an anxious mood because you're thinking thoughts like that it doesn't matter what you're thinking if it's causing your mood to be bad you've got a remedy you don't have to go to the doctor to get help you don't have to run to the preacher to get prayer you have the gift right in your own life you change your thoughts you can change your mood somebody said what do i do if i'm feeling jealous i start saying i'm not jealous i'm not jealous i'm not jealous i'm not really jealous i'm not you try that let's see how that works because your mouth is saying i'm not jealous and your mind is saying yes i am so that is a conflict that's not going to bring you to any victory but if you'll take a few moments to reflect on god's goodness god's not good to some of you i thought he was but he must not be but he's good to me and every time i find myself in a foul mood if i can just take that moment to say wait a minute i don't have to live the rest of my day like that i don't have to go through the rest of this trial with that kind of a spirit on me i can just lift up my hand and start giving god praise for what he has done for who he is for how worthy he is and it starts moving somebody said i just don't believe it's that simple god's word's true god's word's true i believe it works thoughts create your moods you need to spend more time thinking about what you're thinking about your life is an expression of your thoughts be careful what you think about because you become what you think about a few weeks ago i gave you a few examples of some negative thought patterns i'm going to slow them down and read them to you this morning before we move into something else because i knew i couldn't get to where i needed to go unless i reminded you of what you've already heard number one obsessively dwelling on an unpleasant event you don't do that do you did you know you can go back and revisit an unpleasant event and it can affect you almost the exact same way that it did when you were under the gun a time that you were challenged a time that you were rebuked a time that you were going through something difficult a time that someone made you feel a certain way and you let your thoughts go back to that event we can't always keep that from happening but we can determine how long we hang out there you own the real estate of your mind it doesn't belong to the devil he's not really the problem here we become the problem here because there's a certain part of us who get a certain sense of satisfaction when we go back and linger in that unpleasant event there's a little bit of self-punishment a little bit of pleasure all mixed into one when we go back live it again and then justify our reaction seeing everything as black or white with no middle ground i want you to know there are certain situations where a compromise is necessary for survival i'm not preaching compromise but i'm telling you there are certain situations that you can come to as an impasse and the only way to get over them and through them is to come up with a solution where both sides are giving and hopefully both sides are taking you take that into consideration forgiving one another and you move forward because sometimes our minds in reflection will make it black and white when really there's a little gray in there and if the only gray that's in there is your memory that's enough to keep us stirred because sometimes we can forget the details i don't care who you are you can sometimes forget every detail always using words like always and never i never get a break i never win anything i always am the odd man out these are testimonies of very negative thought patterns always jumping to conclusions most of us really don't need the gem because we get all the exercise we need jumping to conclusions constantly already assuming judging motive knowing exactly what's in somebody's heart there's only one way you can do that and that's if the holy ghost should gift you to see it otherwise you have no idea what's going on in somebody's heart taking everything personal everything personal oh that's one of the hardest things we can do is realize it's not all about us i said us i'm preaching to myself always blaming yourself for things outside of your control always apologizing for things outside of your control if you're not if you're apologizing all the time for things you have nothing to do with you're owning stuff that doesn't belong to you i'm not talking about being polite how many of you have ever had somebody to bump into you and you real kindly said excuse me pardon me i'm sorry sometimes we do that to be polite even though we're not the ones who need to slow down now remember you got to say it right you can't say excuse me i'm sorry pardon me [Music] i'm not talking about being polite i'm talking about always taking the blame you see there's two extremes in negative thought patterns one is always blaming yourself and the other is always blaming everybody else there's a balance in taking responsibility for your actions and thoughts there's a balance blaming yourself for things outside of your control being driven by should'ves shouldn'ts guilts could'ves would'ves wished it would have been this way i think one of the things that grieves me the most in this hour of uncertainty with so much death around us it's when people say things like if he'd only had another doctor if she would have only had another hospital these are situations that will not produce anything in you but more grief and actually more fear you've got to understand as i do that god is sovereign i heard a new one recently where someone said if they would have just let me in that i see you i know that i could have prayed the prayer of faith and he would have lived i want you to think about the weirdness of what you're saying you mean there's a prayer that can't get through a wall you mean there's faith that can't reach beyond restriction let me tell you something you don't have to be on location to pray the prayer of faith but if god has another plan we want to bless him and we want to bless his plan and the last one i have here is going to any length imaginable just to be right i told you recently that there are three t's involved in disease 75 to 98 of all current mental physical emotional and behavioral illnesses come from thought life 75 to 98 you say that's a huge gap it is because there's so many different variations of the study and then the other part of disease is thoughts and excuse me toxins and trauma so the three main causes of all forms of disease are thoughts toxins trauma what trauma can sometimes also be related to the thoughts but the body can also retain trauma on a cellular level because we have that amygdala we'll talk about that in just a moment and we've already talked about that but we're back there again we learned last week that what you hear directly affects what you think i'm going to hurry that directly affects what you do we talked about a negativity bias i don't know how many people this week reached out to me to say i never thought of it never heard it i've never heard the term either but i realize now that i have a negativity for a bias a negativity bias the word bias is a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing usually in a way that is close-minded or prejudicial or unfair biases can be innate or can be learned people may develop biases for or against an individual a group or a belief and it is also possible neuroscientists have told us that it's also possible to form a negative bias or a negativity bias so that it's easier for us to think and accept negative thoughts than it is to accept think and accept positive thoughts one neuroscience said scientists said think of it this way if you have a negativity bias your mind is like velcro for negative thoughts when they pass close enough your mind your bias the bias in your mind catches that negative and you see everything from a negative perspective if you are a positive person and you have more of a positivity bias the the neuroscientist said your your mind is like teflon it's nonstick there are people that have a bias for positivity i'd like to be that i don't think i'm there but i'd like to be that i'd like to be somebody that when a negative thought comes the teflon of my mind will not receive it and it just slides right off because i've replaced that that part of me that has a tendency toward the negative in other words i've already mentioned the velcro your positive thoughts can actually change your brain waves it's amazing it can actually influence the frequency that your body operates on our bodies are electromagnetic and they operate on frequency and there are things that we do that lower our frequency and there are things that we do that raise our frequency if we could raise our frequency and never let it drop below a certain point we would never face the majority of diseases that we face come on somebody said i just don't know if that's true in fact someone argued with me not too long ago about it and then began to talk to me about acidity and alkaline being whether you're acidic or alkaline and they were explaining to me that all diseases are caused by that and that's absolutely a fact it affects a lot of what's going on now i need to tell you that negative thinkers are almost always acidic because your body responds your brain chemicals respond to what you're thinking no wonder the bible said as a man thinks he is because you're affecting everything so this is one of the ways you and i can become the enemy that's formed against ourselves so we're saying lord you said lord you said you said no weapon formed against me and you're quoting the right scripture but you're doing something different in your mind so you're fighting but you're really beating the air because your attack is not coming from the external it's coming from the battlefield of the mind are you still here i'm doing good for time so don't look at me funny the majority of us have some negative thought patterns programmed in our subconscious without us being even aware of it these negative thoughts influence your brain frequency levels to the point where you may feel tired did you know negative thoughts can make you feel tired how many of you get in a situation where there's a lot of negative a lot of pressure a lot of stress and and when you're done it you are totally totally wiped out no physical inertia used you didn't do any physical work it was all mental it was all stress it was all all the emotional and the thinking and so forth i had one of those not too too long ago where you realize i didn't do anything physical it's just the stress of the whole thing makes you feel like you've absolutely lost all energy it's it's real what we're talking about is real your negative thoughts are having an impact on your energy level on your body and if that's the case and we know it's the case by neuroscience then we can do something about that by thinking happy thoughts well i'm not capable you may be but i don't seem to be capable of just thinking happy when i want to think happy so you know what i do i go to god's word i go to what makes me happy i go to what makes me happy and the next thing you know my thoughts follow where my heart has led me i'm telling you it works i'm telling you what i do i'm telling you how i get through life we sometimes stumble we sometimes forget what we know but when we remember sometimes our brain frequency levels are so affected by our thoughts that we feel tired we feel frustrated have you ever felt and responded frustrated and you didn't even know why you were frustrated and somebody says what's wrong with you and your answer is i don't know and of course you know [Applause] and a lot of times we do and we just don't want to say you are you ought to fool your family sometimes just tell them why what's really wrong you you wanna know what's wrong you you're what's wrong but sometimes we just say nothing no no no no no no no nothing's wrong then why are you so ill why are you acting why are you so frustrated why are you snapping at everybody for no reason we don't even know sometimes and and the reason why we're so frustrated is because our negative thoughts have had a negative impact on our frequencies our brain waves dip if you if you can measure that and you can i can't but you can have it done in fact there's a great very well-known clinic in atlanta where you can go and have your have your brain under all of those different they'll they'll put your brain under all those special electromagnetic radar uh machines and they can tell what certain thoughts will cause your brain to light up the most what causes your brain to actually shrink and atrophy and what causes your brain to thrive you want to get under whatever makes you thrive and if you're a son of god the word does that come on well not your preaching well good i'm glad you're not stuck with just my preaching i'm so glad you got more to get a hold of in the word than just my preaching i'm glad you've got the table on your phone and you've got your bible in your lap you should have plenty of positivity by listening to the word of god that's been stored for us for this hour and so we can feel tired and frustrated and stressed out and angry little children straight i'm stressed it may not be the stress that you and i face but they also can feel by being in a negative environment don't tell your children they're weird oh you may be and they may be behaving weird because you are weird but they're not weird they will never thrive in that environment you cannot speak that and you say but they know i'm kidding they do not have that ability to know and their brain doesn't have the ability to know you speak life over them you don't tell them they're clumsy have we ever have we ever fallen yes do we ever make a mess absolutely do we ever let things come out of our mouth that shouldn't come out of our mouth absolutely but these words can affect how the brain waves of even our children respond god wants us to have there's a remedy for this this is a vicious vicious cycle that can be difficult to break i want to read two paragraphs to you about cardiovascular disease this was a study men who believed that their risk of suffering from cardiovascular disease was lower than average men who believed for whatever reason that their risk of cardiovascular disease was lower than average they were three times less likely to die from heart attacks and strokes than men who believed otherwise this was found in a 15-year study conducted by the university of rochester medical center and the researcher's name was robert grambling he determined that what you believe about your risk to get cardiovascular disease could affect whether or not you die from cardiovascular disease someone said that doesn't sound like the word we need to hear this morning did anybody hear brother branham say do not fear cancer do not fear cancer because you attract what you fear your body responds to fearful thoughts google is killing people put that in the clip and send it out there google is killing people because they have a they have a symptom they go to google i just want you to notice sometimes how broad those symptoms can be how many of you know kovid used to have three symptoms now it has 550. [Applause] so if you've got any of those 550 you're sure you got it if you read in the and you're looking up your symptoms and it takes you to cancer i know people in this church that have told people they had cancer when they didn't have cancer because they thought maybe they did and you go back and well well i just had to say oh brother sister that is definitely a negativity bias don't you let the enemy trick you that way don't you become the weapon formed against your own life just say hey i don't care what the symptoms are i know what god's word has said and i'm going to stay with that there are professionals out there to help diagnose you not dr google amen amen in dr karina davidson's 10-year study on 877 healthy women and 862 healthy men published in the february issue february 2010 issue of the european heart journal she uh participate participants who reported feeling happier had less heart attacks than those who felt less happy like i told you i i haven't learned how to turn on my my happy thought but what i have learned to do is there's something that leads me to happier thoughts and that's reading what god's word said about me and if i can't always get to the book then i can start affirming and speaking and declaring what i know god's word has said about me you know if you get like sister williams has taught us these two little simple phrases there's dozens of little phrases that you can say that will shift your thoughts and cause you to think i'm blessed oh my i'm blessed if i live the rest of my life without a friend i'm blessed because he told me this morning i'll be a friend that sticketh closer than a brother when we were singing that song i am a friend to god what more could we long for than to know he calls me friend and that means he's looking to get something out of his relationship with me as a friend he longs for my fellowship when we worship someone said there's no need me from worship no need for me to worship brother shelly and a few others they got that handled all we need sister flow here she'll do the worshiping for us how many of you know it don't work that way you've got to be a friend he wants to be a friend to you you've got to respond as a friend to him and give him the worship nothing is more contagious than negativity oh amen brother it's just one o'clock i need a few more minutes can i have the message testimony of raising the dead boy west palm beach florida brother branham said we need to think right i need paragraph eight he was in the notes from today pretty sure i could have missed it just let me know if you don't see it i'll go right on hallelujah you're still here yeah we'll go in a minute i just don't know what minute yet but one of them we will we sure will what's today's date thank you i can't put my hand on it right now i know it's there you all not see it let me just read it anyway no worries paragraph eight of the message testimony of raising the dead boy uh 1953 is the year i wanted you to see this because i wanted you to write it down but you can listen carefully and write down the phrase when you when and you can paraphrase it and get it he said here's an old slogan and i want you to remember it he said do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and then you're bound to be right now the slogan actually went think right that is your duty to yourself do right that is your duty to god she's found it here for us so you write it down however you want to do it but let me read it like he said it here's an old slogan i want you to remember it do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself it's your duty to yourself it's my duty to myself let's say that it's my duty to myself to think right you want to do something for yourself that'll last longer than a pedicure [Music] think right you want to please god do right that's your duty to god to do right it's your duty to yourself think right and you're bound to be right he said that's right see you'll come out right if you'll do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty for yourself that's your duty to god to do right think right that's your duty for yourself and you'll come out right so if i think right it's my duty to myself if i do right it's my duty to god and if i do right if i think right and i do right it'll come out right so don't tell us that it doesn't matter how we think the enemy's constantly trying to disturb our peace isaiah 26-3 we looked at it last week thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee so number one one of the ways that you can become an enemy formed against yourself is to hold on to your stinking thinking number two one of the ways that you can be an enemy formed against yourself is to back is to continue to carry offense holding on to a grudge and not letting it go makes you an enemy formed against yourself come on got a lot of amens there none maybe wanted to find offense for you thank you we've got it let me find a defined offense for you it's an annoyance or resentment thank you it's an annoyance or resentment brought about by a perceived insult to or a disregard for oneself or one's standards or one's feelings or one's principles an offense is an annoyance or a resentment brought about by a perceived insult to our two excuse me by a perceived insult to or disregard for oneself one's feelings one's standards one's principles a grudge is a persistent feeling of ill will or resentment resulting from a past insult or injury if you hold on to offense if you hold on to a grudge you have formed an enemy has formed in here that works against you you didn't need another insult you didn't need another offender you didn't need another enemy if you hold on to those things you form the enemy the enemy lives between your own two elbows and i want you to know no matter how gross how harsh how awful the offense is you can never overcome by holding on to it you can never get victory by holding a grudge we have to cut it off our back we have to let it go if you believe that say amen one of those things that happens when we carry a fence and we form a grudge is that root of bitterness that we talked about last sunday it forms within us and when i was asking the lord to diagnose this congregation as the hebrew year changed this year he spoke to me about the spirit of jealousy and and the root of bitterness and so in my prayer life i've been praying about any area where those things live in me i want them out and if you care about yourself you want them out and if you care about your family you want them out and if you care about your church community you want them out we want god to have a better diagnosis when he looks at us again he said i've got to deal with these things lord please deal with them in us and give us grace to cooperate with you instead of cooperating with the enemy to be an enemy to form an enemy hebrews 12 15 and i'm gonna rush looking diligently lest any man fall fail excuse me lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled it is impossible to carry a root of bitterness that only affects you it will always affect those that you are in fellowship with always if i would have had time i wanted to go over a few of these uh quotations that we used last week but i i won't be able to do that today let me give you one i'm not sure that i use this one just a moment let me just use one let me see if this is in yeah in the in the church age the pergamian church age this is not the church age book this is the actual preaching of the church ages in 1960 the pergament church age book excuse me the pergament church age paragraph 17 try to do something good and just keep being good hold no malice no grudges don't let any bitterness no matter how bad the person is and how bad they talk about you don't you never think evil in your heart against them brother that will be a challenge but it is a challenge that is possible with the help and the grace of the lord jesus christ if you believe that same man he doesn't ask us to do anything that he won't empower us to do if we confess i can't do that lord by myself but with your help i can do that let's read on quickly because right there the devil will set right in working up something right there just keep it all covered up with godly love confession and making right and do good to those who do evil to you it's powerful if you only do good to those who do good to you why jesus said don't don't the publican do the same see the sinners anybody can do good to those that's good to them but be good to those who are not good to you oh yes that's where the challenge is right do good to those who aren't good to you excuse me to those who are not the sinners anybody can be good to those that's good to them but be good to those who are not good to you do something for those that would not do nothing for you might not even help you if you had a need speak a good word for the man that would speak evil against you you may have to search but you can find something i've practiced i know and that way you keep all the bitterness out of your heart he did you wrong but you've got to keep the bitterness out of your heart and the way you do that is by speaking a good word for the man there's got to be redeeming value in there somewhere no doubt about it and you're always in love with everybody then as long as you stay in love you stay in love with god you can stay in love with his people remember brother branham said may every root of bitterness be grubbed out of us by god's sharp grubbing hole number three one of the ways the third way that you can be an enemy formed against yourself is to remain in unforgiveness now i'm not going to finish this this morning obviously but i will look at it again tuesday night god willing i'll go through some scriptures i want to read a quote i want to read a little more science and i want us to close in the message perfect faith paragraph 19 brother branham said now faith is based on forgiveness then and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger we're hungering for apostolic times faith you can have all the faith you want but faith is based on forgiveness you've got to let it go it can happen automatically it only happens intentionally when you take god at his word when you go through scripture and we will do that forgive people in your life even those who are not sorry for their actions because holding on to anger and unforgiveness hurts you a whole lot more than it hurts them the problem is it begins to like like acid it begins to affect those around you and we've seen that and we know that it's the truth in the mayo clinic they released a study about holding a grudge i read to you what a grudge is and from that study we learned that if you're unforgiving you might pay the price repeatedly by bringing anger and bitterness into every relationship and every new experience in your life did you know that by carrying unforgiveness for an old relationship affects all your relationships going forward now tell me it's worth it to hold on to things like that it's never i don't think there's anything in here that says it's easy but god didn't tell us to do anything that he didn't provide the grace that we would be able to do it with is that right your life might become so wrapped up in the wrong that you can enjoy the present there are some people that are miserable they work pretty hard at making everybody around them miserable how do you know because we're not blind you run into people like that you experience people like that in your family and you see and no i don't believe that people put on their miserable face just to come to church and if they do god forgive them and help them not to find themselves under judgment i believe the way that people conduct themselves in here can often show what's going on in their life god wants to help every one of us maybe we don't get our help all at the same time but he wants to help us because holding on to these kind of things can cause us to be consistently depressed or anxious you might even lose some valuable and enriching connectedness with other people sometimes you're losing and it's by your choice are you ready to hear this i don't know but here it goes anyway beside the unmistakable importance of forgiveness in scripture now there is now there is increasing scientific evidence that forgiveness gives us healthier and happier lives there are more than 100 studies showing the power the healing power of forgiveness when we don't forgive thoughts of the painful act will cause fear in the amygdala which is remember it is a part of the brain that acts as a library for our emotions the amygdala is a very important part of the brain it's a library and it actually operates like a librarian because there are times that you will experience trauma and emotion and experiences that you are not emotionally healthy enough to handle your amygdala is your god-given friend because your amygdala will send the trauma listen to me now please please i know you're getting weary but it's not time for notes it's not time to look around it's time to stay right here for just another few minutes you can have the rest of your day on your own whatever blesses you but i want you to hear this that amygdala is not only like a library but also like a librarian and when you experience something in your life that you are not emotionally healthy enough to process and deal with your amygdala therefore sends a signal to another part of your body and that carries with it the trauma somebody said that's just too strange for me just remember what the scripture said you're a miracle you're fearfully and wonderfully made god is amazing and he created this body amazing the problem is there are the truth is that we rarely have a healthy enough organ with the food that we eat and the life that we live and the toxins that we come in contact with and the thoughts that we deal with we rarely have a healthy enough organ that can carry extra trauma without affecting the function of that organ do you follow that and so what the amygdala is supposed to do is send that that trauma on a cellular level to another part of your body usually a liver sometimes a kidney it can even be a spleen your spleen and it remains there in cellular form waiting for an opportunity for you to become more emotionally healthy because your body knows if it leaves that trauma on a cellular level in an already overworked organ disease is the result that's why every person here skinny fit overweight and everybody in between should support their liver in prayer and with some kind of supplementation because your liver is the most overworked organ in your body it processes all of the actual toxins and it processes the toxins that come on a cellular level meaning all of the chemicals that you're exposed to as well as the toxic emotions and thoughts they go into the liver and if the liver is already sluggish and full of yuck your liver then doesn't really know what to do with the extra load and that is when disease can break out in our body if we place ourselves in a in a more calm relaxing happy state of mind and one of the most healthy states of mind is worship you see god is not the only one and i'm nearly done god is not the only one that benefits from you being in the spirit when you and i get in the atmosphere of his presence we are in a place that in that moment nothing can touch us you're looking at him not just with physical eyes but you're connected to him with eyes of faith you're shutting out the world you're shutting out those around listen people perceive things different ways some people come here and they think our worship is wild and unchurch order-ish we need to be more like message churches we need to do it a certain way let me tell you something you can dictate a lot of things from where you are you can post and make comments you can talk about us on sunday afternoon whatever you need to do out there but there's one thing you can't do from out there in the world wide web and that is dictate how we worship god here not going to let you do it not going to let you do it so you might as well just back off of that when we get in that place of worship and we refuse to be distracted by what others are doing [Applause] you can be distracted by other worshipers that's not their decision that's your choice your choice it doesn't matter if they are doing modest somersaults you're not plugged into that you're not focusing on that that's why sister floor sister sharon or anybody else in this church that loves to worship you don't ever have to apologize how many of you have ever heard in the past sister flo say i just i'm so i didn't mean no no no no no not here you don't have to apologize because no one can be offended by your worship if they are worshipping they don't know what you're doing anyway they've got their mind on the lord and once you get in that place praise until the glory comes when the glory comes you stand in the glory and worship him and you are in the best state for every part of who you are for those few moments that old liver of yours has been quivering all week trying to deal with all your emotions and all your gunk and all your hurt and all your troubles when you get in the presence of the lord that presence of god soothes every part of who you are and even when you don't realize it your body is processing trauma as you stand in his presence god is strengthening your body the organs the systems of your body he's anointing your amygdala to do the job that it's created to do so worship is not just god receiving praise but you are also when your heart is really there you are receiving glorious benefits you're getting brain chemicals washes washes of brain chemicals somebody said i can't believe you're really saying we ought to praise the lord for our health sure why not why not you're doing it because you love him but if somebody wants to say hey that helps my health it does it does and we're not that's not our motive and that's not what uh you know drives us or inspires us but god wants to help us you believe that say amen all right listen when we don't forgive when we don't forgive thoughts of the painful act will cause fear in the amygdala the library for emotions which causes stress chemicals to be re released it raises levels of stress hormones and increases blood pressure and heart rate this is the results of over 100 studies on the effect of unforgiveness on the physical body can you imagine it has the ability to increase your blood pressure and heart rate when people hold on to their anger and past trauma the stress response that fight or flight stays active making them sick both mentally and physically researchers using functional magnetic resonance imaging found that different parts of the brain are activated positively when people think about choosing to forgive rather than getting revenge there was an actual test done where they where they put them under this resonance testing and that's why i was talking about it lighting up in different parts and they said to the people i want you just to think about something that maybe you haven't had any any forgiveness over something you haven't resolved and you haven't been able to forgive i want you to think about that they measured what that looks like what the brain looks like with the thoughts of holding on and then they measured what the brain looks like when when they instructed them just begin to think about turning that loose letting that go forgiving that person making up your mind you're not going to carry it anymore and the difference between the scans was absolutely incredible i've actually seen some pictures that compared the two and it really really strengthens this idea of letting it go when you realize it's affecting you it's affecting you in so many different ways as we choose to forgive the amygdala which is the frontal cortex link of our brain becomes very active calming the amygdala the very thought of forgiving someone calms the amygdala and the stress response and toxic memory that caused this place of unforgiveness in the first place starts being changed and its effect on the physical body starts being negated and a restoration begins to take place at the thought of forgiving if just thinking about forgiving somebody can have such a positive impact on the brain think about what it could do to us body soul and spirit if we do more than think about it but we actually do it and what could happen in us if we make up our minds we're going to be like god's word said great peace great peace have they which love the law of god and nothing shall offend them i'm go i want to be un unoffendable we don't let's just talk about it let's make up our minds by the grace of god we're going to have that we're going to shed it like a duck sheds water we're not going to hold on to that there's one thing you need to know you can't change the past but god's word and science is showing that changing how you think about the past can reduce its impact on you and the resulting likelihood of stress related illness i tell you what you've got more power in your hands than you realize and the reason why we're not walking in the in the spiritual health and physical health that god's emotional health that god's promise for us is because we're allowing ourselves to be formed as enemies against our own life now we surrender to god today and we say hey if no weapon formed against me is going to prosper then i also have to recognize the ways that i am used to sabotage my own life the way my thought patterns are sabotaging who i am in this hour i can't get over w i can't get over it i can't get over it i just don't seem to be able to get over it you can by the grace of god somebody said but i've called on him and he won't help me i just cannot believe my brother that you're the exception to god's word i have to believe that you're not revisiting that enough coming back coming back and coming back and coming back and i think one of the things that holds us in that pattern is because we want to somehow be justified or vindicated that may never come cancel culture may cancel you it may never invite you in you may never be apologized for because of what you stand for it may never happen but you've got to make up your mind that loving god and serving god and worshiping god are more important than allowing the enemy to use you against you so we say to the enemy today you need to get a new bag of tricks because we're recognizing ways that we're being used to form weapons against ourselves and we know lord that if you reveal something to us and show us something you've got a way out for us let's stand together this morning this afternoon hallelujah thank you for being with me and staying with me i want to be whole because god's word said i can be i want to not only win the victory but i want to hold on to the victory brother branham preached about those who could get it but couldn't keep it how many of you want to have the victory and keep the victory musicians are coming we're going to enter into worship this morning before we go we have time to do that it's 1 30. we have time to worship him we have time to come into his presence we have time to just invite him to come and allow us to experience healing and wholeness as we start dealing with those thoughts we start dealing with grudges offenses unforgivenesses the enemy may be using i just saw as i was praying uh i mean just meditating then and trying to talk to you and come to a close and make sure that if there was anything else that needed to be said i just saw in the spirit that god desires i'm not going to tell you the picture that i saw it doesn't matter but i know from this that god desires today to bring someone up into a place of awareness in him that you recognize how you have nearly destroyed yourself there has been a a a kind of self-destruction we know that ultimately the enemy is the inspiration for that but you have been caught up in some kind of cycle of self-destruction self-sabotage in such a way that you've not been able to break out of it because you hold the key [Music] we can rebuke the devil from you but until you can recognize that you've been cooperating with his plan instead of god's plan there's so much power when we realize that we have a god to cooperate with and he has a plan for our life and we have somehow joined forces with the wrong side and it has brought about a destruction and a breaking down and a deterioration in our spiritual life and i would dare say our physical body as well i would to god come on let's be ready i would to god that if you can see that and recognize that you would experience the new life that i just saw god desiring to give you when you could say to him i see if you don't you can't if you can't you don't if you don't see it you can't say you do but since he showed it to me this way i believe he wants to allow someone to see it to recognize that you've become your worst enemy you're actually giving the devil a holiday and i tell you if he if he's gonna tore me ought to have to work to do it we ought not to be doing his work for us greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world hallelujah i want you to just meditate as we worship the lord together now i want you to meditate for just a moment and i'm going to give you an opportunity to say to the lord i recognize that i've been playing on the on the on the opposite team and i've been agreeing with the enemy and cooperating with him to my own destruction and i'm ready to let the lord break that cycle in me so that i can give my all to jesus again and be what he would have me to be thank you jesus thank you jesus [Music] oh yes he is [Music] oh you rescue the souls of men [Music] counselor comforter keeper spirit we long to embrace you offer hope when our hearts have hopelessly lost oh we hopelessly lost and you are the one that we praise you are the one we adore [Music] oh hunger for and you are the one that we pray always [Music] [Music] faithfully loving your own oh yes you do here in our weakness you find us falling before your oh we're falling before your throne sing to him you are the one that we pray [Music] hearts always hunger for and oh our hearts always hunger for let's worship him and you are the one that we pray you are the one we adore and you give the [Music] our hearts healing hunger for oh our hearts always [Music] you offer open our hearts have hopelessly lost the way oh we hopelessly lost our way and you are the one that we praise jesus [Music] he's exposed [Music] [Music] just sing a little more of that would you hallelujah [Music] we're faithfully loving your own hearing [Music] yes [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] our hearts always hunger i'll find something else you want to lead us in and just play this while while he's looking and getting it in his mind i just want to take a a poll here for just a moment and i'm not looking for a big number i'm not trying to do that now i just want somebody who sincerely recognizes today that you're fighting against your own self by yielding and allowing the enemy to form you as a weapon against your own mind and your own life and you're you're tired of that and you want god to give you the victory that he promised you and in order to do that you got to step down and resign and and say i'm not going to keep cooperating with the enemy to defeat myself because jesus has given me the victory i'm i'm staying out of the past i i'm going to i'm going to think about what i'm thinking about i'm going to be more careful with my thought pattern i'm going to be more careful with carrying offense and grudges and i'm going to ask god's forgiveness to fill me in such a way that i don't have to struggle for giving other people if you could just catch a glimpse of all that he's had to forgive you for of all the times he's had to just pour his grace on us and forgive us perhaps it'll just help you to be filled with that love and forgiveness and you won't have to struggle so hard to let people out from under the burden of the grudge that you hold against them now i want you to know i'm preaching to the whole body of christ here there's a way to win this and there's a way to hold on to it and we want to do that if you recognize that you spend some time of your life cooperating with the enemy and you'd like to see that broken i want you just to step up your hand right now all over the building you don't have to come to the front but you just say i do sure i do i i want all of you to have help but i want those of you who who really need it the worst i want you to get everything you need to say no more no more no more the truth is some of what i'm talking about is private you don't talk about it with your wife you don't talk about it with your husband you don't talk about it with anybody else it's the inner battle you don't need an audience you're the audience you're captive and that hurts me the most it's when we recognize that people suffer inside can't really tell it don't really want nobody to know it because you don't want to bring nobody else down we might have others who cooperate with the enemy against us sometime but today we're focusing on how we have lord jesus my heart is touched today because i saw so many hands go up in this room and i know i know that this has impacted us on different levels i realize that but i know there's some lord that really see with with clear vision today how that a lot of their struggles could be lessened if they would just break off this cooperation with the enemy and stop allowing him to form us into a weapon against ourselves jesus i ask you today lord for every person in this room and streaming and archive watching that you would allow such faith in your word to rise up in their hearts that they would become actively involved in tearing down this cooperation that has been built up between our enemy and our own self we can win the battle of the mind we can cut off the dead corpse the baggage the luggage the weight of the past and live in the present our mistakes and our sins and our wounds and our hurts that lay on our backs like a rotting corpse in the name of jesus christ we recognize today we can drop that we can cut it off it's not who we are it's what we were it's what we experienced yesterday but it is not our present and lord right now would you also anoint us to see your forgiveness in our lives how far you've brought us how many times we fail you how quick you are to forgive to show mercy to show grace to renew us to restore us [Music] we are so thankful lord and we ask that you let us become so aware of your constant forgiveness for us that it spills out of our lives and we just say it's done it's done it's settled you're forgiven i'm not carrying this any longer and i refuse to keep conducting myself like i'm holding a grudge when i'm not i refuse to continue to conduct myself like i'm walking in unforgiveness when i'm not i just want all the awkwardness i want i want all of what the enemy tries to tie us up with i want every bit of that out of my life lord i'm asking you right now for every person who feels that that you would minister to them by placing your finger on their faith and anointing it today to rise up and take you at your word oh jesus [Laughter] i want to say again i know it's not about feeling [Music] but i like what i feel i like what i feel god's wanting to do in doing i like it i like it it's to him we look he's the answer he's the hell he's the strength so i just pray in the name of the lord jesus christ that every person that raised up a hand they will find the grace to keep this commitment to you to be out of the self-destruction business in the name of the lord jesus christ we receive the wholeness of the lord the healing of the lord and as we stand here in your presence let every cell of our body let every system of our body let every organ of our body respond to the peace of jesus christ worship him just another moment or two [Music] you are not a god created [Music] you are not a god [Music] that's just the way it is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's just the way it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh you are on your [Music] you in the good times [Music] that you're the only god whose power [Music] [Music] you're the only god [Music] and that's just the way it is [Applause] [Music] right now in the good times [Applause] oh you are on your throne [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh that's who you [Music] oh you are on your throne [Music] [Music] you are on your throne and right now in the good times in bad you are on your throne yes yes you are alone would you just reach over and love somebody that's standing near you right now there's a wonderful piece that's moved in you can do it right back in your seat too there's just a wonderful peace i love you god bless you god bless you brother god bless you sister [Music] before time again yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Music] and right now in the good times and back you are on your throne you are god alone you are god hallelujah thank you for victory jesus you're unchecked thank you for victory jesus unshaken unstoppable unstoppable just sing in a minute that's who you are we know there is [Music] oh oh that's who you are that's who you are jesus would you just raise your hands just a moment and love him you use your words you use your vocabulary right now and just tell him lord i love you [Music] your life to us we couldn't make it we couldn't get through this without your strength your help your great grace we have so much to thank you for we have so much to praise you for we have so much lord that we want to say to you help us to seize the moment and take advantage of every opportunity to tell you how much you mean to us you are god you're wonderful you go with us you don't leave us you promise to go with us to the end of the earth lord i ask you right now to minister to other needs physical needs those who are fighting sickness in their body you sense your word to heal us there's no reason why we can't let our faith reach up and take that healing home with us today over every symptom over every route of every problem lord jesus right now we trust you for your healing power you've been so good to us this week we have seen your healing power we know that you are god's sovereign just play something that you can keep playing that if you want to we want to we prayed and we're going to close and if you want to spend some more time with the lord here around the altar you're free to do that today and always but uh i want to share something with you before you leave today uh [Music] in the old days way way way way back when i came back to columbus to pastor i was a single man and i didn't know if i'd ever find anybody who'd be able to live with my idiosyncrasies and love me it's not just that you can live together but that you can love one another in spite of and because of all those things i didn't know that i would ever have children we were i didn't think i'd ever marry i mean i i hoped i hoped i hoped but i wondered and so i had a lot of little little love loved a lot of people's little children then and then we went through the years of having our own and i'll never forget if i live uh another 50 years i will never forget the feeling of knowing that god had blessed stacy and i and that she was carrying our firstborn and i'll never forget the look on the on the nurse's face when she walked in the medical center that morning and that day and she said i don't know who you people are but you've got the most wonderful support system of any patient we have ever had up here there are over 50 people in the waiting room waiting for the announcement that your baby has been born that was the most wonderful feeling to know that that many people cared and that many people were praying and we were blessed uh 23 years ago when god gave us benjamin judah he has never been perfect and will never be until he's in god's presence but he's ours and we love him his mom and i are very very proud of him and i think there was a time in my life that i expected the rapture to be so soon that i didn't know the rest would come and that god would give us joshua and olivia and mariah and as much as i longed to have a bigger family we don't have a big family i don't hardly have any family at all except my spiritual family and as much as we wanted to know that we could expand and have uh daughters-in-laws and maybe one day son-in-laws and grandbabies you just wonder if you're going to live long enough to see that come to pass so it is my great pleasure and honor as a pastor and as a dad to announce the engagement of jenna seiler and benjamin judah shelley [Music] [Applause] we congratulate them both [Music] [Applause] beth don't beat her today [Applause] [Music]

you were [Laughter] [Music] there's a piece there you know i go in a lot of homes and i see uh there's a lot of darkness even with the lights on this dog yeah that's true thank you so much brother it's grace it's grace it's not always peaceful sometimes we offend him and we have to ask him to come back but he does he is so faithful so i would really like for us to pray over them but i really want brother greeley to be here and so when i heard that he was coming in late uh tomorrow night that is what she said right then i want us to wait i know a lot of you might not be here tuesday night
