Description:
The Word is not just a book—it is Jesus, alive and real! In these last days, the enemy’s fighting hard, but when you seize this truth and live it, you step into God’s plan for you. His blood, pure and divine, doesn’t just cover—it transforms you, filling you with true life. Stand firm, stay in His presence, and live as you’re meant to—tied to heaven, not just earth. That’s the call—take it now!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the whole book is God's written record of his word the word is not a book the word is a person remember John 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh so the word the Loos is not a book but it's a man it can't even in this hour be a woman because we are are to be the word demonstrated today not in the exact same way that our Lord was he was absolutely transformed into a body that was uh prepared to to be the word to carry the word as both God and Son of God only one two offices that we're mentioning here but we know there was three it was not Papa father who overshadowed Mary the scripture is clear it was the Holy Ghost not a person in himself but a demonstration of the same God here oh Israel the Lord thy God is is one always has been always will be and that Spirit became flesh and that flesh was Jesus Christ powerful and the blood that he shed was not Mary's blood wasn't Joseph's blood it was God's blood blood that God had prepared specifically for the purpose of redemption you see the purpose of that blood was to get God's Life Zoey life on us and not only on us but in US animal life wouldn't do it see the scripture said the life is in the blood so every lamb that died every Ram that died every turtle dove that died released life it released life but it was animal life life and therefore it only had the ability to cover man's transgression but there came a blood don't ever forget the power don't ever forget the authority don't ever forget what the blood has done is doing and will do should it be our emphasis the life that's in that blood should be our emphasis because God creator was looking for a way to get that life on you and ultimately in you so that life came and dwelt among us we beheld his glory that was God being son among us Emmanuel God With Us so the life was once with us but Jesus is leaving and he says something so powerfully important I'm leaving you I'm out of here but there's a part of me that's going to come back that life was over you in the Old Testament with you in the gospels but in the Epistles and the rest of the New Testament it's revealed that that life is now going to be in You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire it's so much more than an experience it's a transformation it's a translation it's taking the life of God and putting it inside of mortal men and women everything that happened up to that point is a type and Shadow we're no longer living in types and Shadow Shadows we're now living in the reality of every type and in the reality of every shadow because God's own life has come and I pray that as we get the rest of the mud and Gunk and junk dug out of our Lives I pray that it sets us in such an order that we can live as we were created to live dual dimensionally we were created to live as citizens of Two Worlds and Eternal one and one that's locked in time we were created to be able to walk through the natural existence of our life while engaging that other realm so there is a greater portion for the bride of Christ in the last days it's when your name on the check is the same as his name on the check the reality is we don't want our name we're just going to sign it misses Jesus Christ because we're tired of our old identity our new identity is a part of him Hallelujah and and we say Amen we say Amen when the preacher says that but we forget it when the fever comes we forget it when the finances get tight we forget it when our families are shaking with some confusion or chaos but I want you to know something that's when you need to remember who who you are and if I were you and I didn't feel and experience and engage with the presence of the Lord every day of your life I would find out immediately why I wouldn't wait till tomorrow I'd find out today why I can go two or three days without engaging in experiencing the presence of the Lord if that is your life you are living below your privileges as a Son of God in the last Church age
