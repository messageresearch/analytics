[3:25] would do our best to give you something
[3:27] free it's our desire to be a bless bling
[3:30] in your life and to help you with with
[3:32] uh the resources that we have available
[3:35] let's get into the study and let's see
[3:37] what God has for us today shall we do
[3:39] that all right we are talking
[3:43] about I I I think the subject is too big
[3:46] to Define because we're walking through
[3:48] a journey and we're headed to the Cross
[3:51] I'll tell you that but we're starting in
[3:53] the book of Exodus and we're talking
[3:55] about uh Moses and we ended our Study
[3:59] last week talking about Moses and his
[4:02] desire to know God in an intimate way in
[4:05] fact the scripture said that Moses had
[4:08] had face-to-face encounters with God and
[4:12] yet he desired even more than that I
[4:14] mean it sounds like if you could talk
[4:16] with God face to face lip to ear what
[4:20] could be better than that but Moses had
[4:23] a even a deeper desire and I believe if
[4:26] you have a deep desire as the scripture
[4:29] talks about the Deep calling to the Deep
[4:31] if you have a desire for more of God
[4:34] then to me that is actual proof that
[4:37] there's more of God available or you
[4:40] wouldn't have the desire and the longing
[4:42] in your heart for it and uh I I I'm
[4:47] familiar with a story and I think it's I
[4:49] I think it's happened around the world
[4:51] but I'm familiar with a with a story
[4:53] that appeared in the news many years ago
[4:55] about a child who seemed to have this
[4:58] disorder uh of of eating Rubber and uh
[5:03] even the Erasers on the end of the
[5:05] pencil and and even the pedals of a
[5:08] bicycle and of course the parents were
[5:11] so concerned that this child would would
[5:13] chew and eat this Rubber and they took
[5:17] her to the doctor and they did blood
[5:19] work and they did a psychological
[5:21] evaluation and they wanted to find out
[5:23] what was wrong with the child you know
[5:25] what they found they found that there
[5:27] was a lack of sulfur in her system her
[5:31] body was craving it was calling out for
[5:33] the compound of sulfur and she found a
[5:37] way to meet that need and and with with
[5:40] an intelligence that she didn't possess
[5:42] in the natural so I think that this
[5:45] speaks to us of there's something on the
[5:47] inside that knows what we need even when
[5:50] we're not conscious of what we need and
[5:53] if there's a pull inside of you for more
[5:57] it's a craving and it means that there
[5:59] there is more available so keep leaning
[6:02] in to God and keep positioning Yourself
[6:05] by faith to receive more and this was
[6:08] Moses he he just said I I I appreciate
[6:11] the fact Lord that you want to send an
[6:13] angel to help us but I would much prefer
[6:17] if you would go with us we want you to
[6:20] be the one to lead us and we want to
[6:22] know you face to face you know Moses I
[6:26] believe didn't just want to encounter
[6:28] God for himself but he wanted the people
[6:31] to have an encounter I think that's the
[6:33] mark of every true leader we not only
[6:36] want to have a greater walk with God but
[6:38] we want everybody we know and love and
[6:41] care about to have a greater walk with
[6:43] God and so we read about this concept of
[6:47] face to face without a veil without a
[6:51] hindrance with no one or nothing no
[6:55] thing standing in our way just a a real
[6:59] clear relationship with the Lord what do
[7:03] you think that means face to face well
[7:07] when we talk about the face of God we're
[7:10] talking about his Spirit we're talking
[7:12] about that which emanates from God that
[7:16] which pours forth from God so when the
[7:21] scripture talks about the face of God
[7:24] it's talking about uh an encounter with
[7:27] the spirit of God do you remember
[7:29] remember in the Book of
[7:30] Genesis in chapter one where it tells us
[7:34] that the spirit of God moved upon the
[7:39] face of the water now water doesn't have
[7:42] a face but it does have a surface and
[7:46] you break that surface of the water when
[7:49] you're plunged in when you jump into the
[7:52] water you break that surface so that
[7:55] word uh uh surface or the word face uh
[7:59] it talks about the spirit of God moving
[8:02] over the surface of the water and we
[8:05] follow these uh types through the
[8:07] scripture what does water represent in
[8:10] the Bible if face represents Spirit what
[8:13] does water represent well the Bible
[8:15] tells us in the Book of Revelation CH 17
[8:19] and verse 15 that Waters represent
[8:23] people multitudes Nations and tongues
[8:27] and symbols are always always consistent
[8:30] in the word of God so Waters means
[8:33] people and face means spirit so if the
[8:39] if the spirit of God was moving over the
[8:41] face of the water it was bringing the
[8:45] peop into an encounter with the face of
[8:50] God the spirit of God the presence of
[8:53] God and when I talk about the presence
[8:55] of God in this regard I'm not just
[8:57] talking about something that that makes
[8:59] you feel A tingle I'm talking about the
[9:03] manifested presence of God and when the
[9:06] manifested presence of God comes into
[9:08] your life things are not the same change
[9:13] transformation Deliverance takes place
[9:17] so I think we all cry out in this hour
[9:20] for more of an encounter with the face
[9:24] of God the spirit of God and we not only
[9:27] need him we need him over all the w
[9:29] Waters we need him over all the peoples
[9:32] of the earth we need a move a deep move
[9:35] of the spirit of God to awaken the
[9:37] churches around the world and to cause
[9:41] the people of Faith to rise up and get a
[9:43] hold of God it's not time to be lazy
[9:46] Christians it's time to be deeply
[9:48] committed to God in this hour in 2
[9:52] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 it
[9:54] says but we all with open face there it
[9:58] is is face to face nothing in between
[10:02] beholding as in a glass a mirror the
[10:07] glory of the Lord are
[10:09] changed into the same image from glory
[10:14] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[10:19] Lord as we look into the face of God as
[10:24] we look into the things of the spirit of
[10:27] God they become like a mirror and we
[10:30] begin to see a transformation in the
[10:34] reflection of the mirror we are be we
[10:37] are beginning to be changed by what we
[10:40] look into that makes me want to cry out
[10:44] Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord like the
[10:47] beautiful worship song says Open the
[10:50] Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you
[10:54] I want to see you this seeing is not
[10:57] with these natural eyes this seeing is
[11:01] with our heart with our spirit it's
[11:04] being able to Spirit to Spirit our human
[11:09] Spirit that's been regenerated and
[11:11] transformed by the Living spirit of the
[11:14] Lord Jesus Christ having communion with
[11:18] the face of God with the spirit of God I
[11:21] call it Spirit to Spirit Fellowship
[11:24] maybe that sounds a little strange to
[11:26] you but but it is a it is a
[11:29] introduction if you have ever
[11:31] experienced this kind of
[11:33] spirit-to-spirit connection with God
[11:35] where you could feel his spirit in your
[11:39] spirit uh quickening you making you
[11:42] alive the Bible said if that same Spirit
[11:44] which raised Jesus from the dead dwell
[11:46] in you it shall also Quicken make alive
[11:51] your mortal body I want you to know
[11:53] that's not just the promise of a future
[11:55] resurrection of your physical body it's
[11:58] also a a promise of a spiritual
[12:01] transformation in your life and the more
[12:04] that we come like Adam face to face
[12:07] communion with God we sit under the
[12:10] revealed word of God and we worship
[12:15] God we praise the Lord until the spirit
[12:19] of God begins to move upon us and when
[12:21] the anointing of God begins to move upon
[12:24] us we enter into the Realms of worship
[12:27] and worship is not a sacrifice praise is
[12:32] sometimes a sacrifice we we we praise
[12:35] the lord we lift up our hands we shout
[12:37] hallelujah whether we feel like it or
[12:39] not but as we enter in to the presence
[12:43] of God by the sacrifice of praise then
[12:46] the anointing begins to come the
[12:48] Manifest presence of God begins to fall
[12:51] and then there is a transition from
[12:54] praise to worship and worship is not
[12:57] about work it's it's not about will it's
[13:00] not about sacrifice worship is an
[13:04] overflow of your heart God has filled
[13:08] your heart you are so filled with
[13:10] gratefulness and Thanksgiving gratitude
[13:13] and that begins to flow out of you you
[13:15] just can't contain it and you just begin
[13:18] to to gush forth oh you're wonderful
[13:22] Jesus You're Beautiful Jesus you're so
[13:26] wonderful and lovely Lord you mean mean
[13:29] so much to me and that worship begins to
[13:33] transform us it begins to pull us in and
[13:36] we are changed by glory to glory in
[13:40] other words from one experience with the
[13:43] Manifest presence of God to the next
[13:46] from one worship Moment One Moment In
[13:49] His presence I believe it was David that
[13:52] said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the
[13:54] house of the Lord for one day than to
[13:57] dwell in the tents of evil or wickedness
[13:59] for for eternity or forever or for many
[14:02] days and I feel that way I'd rather be
[14:05] in the presence of God I I know there
[14:07] are a lot of people who don't like to
[14:09] gather with the Saints but I'm not one
[14:11] of them I like to gather with God's
[14:13] people there's something about the
[14:16] release of a corporate anointing when we
[14:18] come together I bring my lick of fire
[14:22] you bring your lick of fire and the and
[14:24] the more we gather together the more
[14:26] licks of fire we have and we begin and
[14:28] to encounter God in a corporate level in
[14:31] a way that that is is somewhat different
[14:34] than how we encounter God individually
[14:37] one doesn't replace the other both are
[14:40] very very important in our lives and
[14:42] Moses wanted more of an encounter I
[14:46] believe he was craving and crying out
[14:49] for an individual encounter but he also
[14:52] wanted a corporate encounter for the
[14:54] people of God as we behold God's glory
[14:58] as we we look into the things of the
[15:00] spirit we begin to be changed by what we
[15:03] see and the Bible tells us in that same
[15:07] chapter of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 but
[15:10] in verses 13 and 14 it talks about Moses
[15:14] and the veil let me read it to you and
[15:17] not as Moses which put a veil over his
[15:20] face that the children of Israel could
[15:23] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[15:26] which is abolished but their Minds were
[15:29] blinded for until this day remaineth the
[15:33] same Veil untaken away in the reading of
[15:36] the Old Testament which Veil is done
[15:39] away in Christ and this speaks about the
[15:43] glory that Moses encountered on the
[15:46] mountain it was so powerful it was so uh
[15:49] radiant that he covered his face with a
[15:52] veil when he would go and meet with the
[15:55] people and there was a reason for that
[15:57] and we could talk about about that in
[15:59] another time but it talks about the fact
[16:01] that with the with the children of
[16:04] Israel there is even to this day a veil
[16:07] that remains over their faces as they
[16:10] begin to read the Old Testament and and
[16:12] what that says to us is they do not
[16:15] fully understand what the promises of
[16:18] the Old Testament were pointing to they
[16:21] have not yet seen the end the
[16:24] Fulfillment the reality of the type and
[16:27] Shadow uh the Old Testament is God's
[16:30] plan it's God's instruction but it is a
[16:34] type and a shadow that leads us to a
[16:38] reality and that reality can only be
[16:41] found in a relationship with the Messiah
[16:46] a personal relationship with our savior
[16:50] I want you to know though that that Veil
[16:52] that separates Israel from from
[16:56] understanding the Fulfillment of every
[16:59] promise and the type and Shadow that was
[17:02] fulfilled in the coming of the Lord
[17:03] Jesus Christ the Bible tells us that
[17:06] that Veil can and will be removed in 2
[17:10] Corinthians same chapter but in verse 16
[17:13] chapter 3 nevertheless when it shall
[17:16] turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken
[17:20] away I believe that there will be a
[17:22] Great Awakening in Israel and among the
[17:26] Jewish people all over the world I I
[17:28] believe there will be a Great Awakening
[17:30] when the veil that is over their faces
[17:33] and the partial blindness that they have
[17:36] received for the benefit of the Gentiles
[17:39] when that Veil and that blindness has
[17:42] been removed what a glorious day that's
[17:45] going to be when God
[17:48] revisits his own chosen people and when
[17:52] they see without aail and so in the
[17:55] meantime I want I want the same
[17:57] experience because
[17:58] I know there are times that there are
[18:01] veils in my life there are things that
[18:04] come between me and being able to
[18:06] encounter God in a real way I want those
[18:09] removed I don't want any barrier I don't
[18:12] want a veil remember how the veil hung
[18:15] in the temple and remember that when our
[18:17] lord Jesus was dying on the cross uh
[18:21] that veil of the temple was rent in two
[18:24] it was rent in Twain the Bible says it
[18:27] was ripped from Top to bottom that
[18:29] indicates to me that God himself ripped
[18:32] that Veil opened up the way into the
[18:36] holy of holies I was preaching to my own
[18:39] church last night from the scripture in
[18:41] the book of Hebrews chapter 10 where it
[18:44] talks about our great high priest who
[18:47] has made the holies the holiest of
[18:50] holies accessible we have access he
[18:55] provided way I think the King James says
[18:58] say he consecrated a way he made a way
[19:02] so that you and I can go in and enter
[19:04] into the fullness of his glory into the
[19:07] fullness of his presence now Moses had
[19:10] encountered god let's not forget this he
[19:12] had seen the the power of God
[19:15] demonstrated he saw God split the Red
[19:18] Sea he saw God on the mountain he saw
[19:21] God
[19:22] provide and yet he longed for more and I
[19:26] want to say again that I believe the the
[19:29] heart of the Bride no matter what nation
[19:31] she lives in around the world I believe
[19:33] the heart of the Bride is crying out for
[19:37] more of God a deeper relationship hey
[19:41] look we don't have to settle for a
[19:43] surface relationship with God a pretense
[19:46] we can have what the Bible said is
[19:48] available we can have it if we're
[19:50] willing to line ourselves up by faith
[19:53] now it requires sanctification it
[19:56] requires a consecration and a setting
[19:59] apart and that happens when we yield
[20:02] when we yield ourselves it's not easy to
[20:05] to bring our uh five senses down hush
[20:09] them tell them to be quiet it's not
[20:12] always easy to bring our will and our
[20:15] mind and our emotions and cause them to
[20:17] be calm so that we can have an encounter
[20:21] Spirit to spirit with God but we have to
[20:23] be willing to do that I'll just tell you
[20:26] that one of the ways that can be
[20:28] accomplished is by pulling aside and
[20:31] giving God uh some time just setting
[20:34] aside some time to be in the presence of
[20:37] God and I know it's not easy to do that
[20:39] in the busy life that we live but if you
[20:42] can make that appointment make it a uh a
[20:45] habit and set that up as a goal I'm
[20:48] going to give God uh Wednesday afternoon
[20:52] or uh I'm going to do my best to to
[20:55] spend time with God on Saturday morning
[20:58] morning I'm going to pull away and do
[21:00] your best to be faithful to that I tell
[21:02] you folk it will benefit you more than
[21:05] what you realize if you go about it in
[21:08] in the right motive you're not doing it
[21:11] to earn favor with God you're not doing
[21:14] it so that he'll love you you're do
[21:16] because he does love you already but
[21:18] you're doing it because you just want
[21:20] more of him he knows our heart now let's
[21:23] look at uh Exodus chapter 34 we've been
[21:26] in 32 and 33 let's look at 34 for a
[21:29] moment and verse 29 and 30 and it came
[21:32] to pass when Moses came down from Mount
[21:35] SII with the two tablets of testimony in
[21:37] his hand when he came down from the
[21:39] mount that Moses wied not that the skin
[21:42] of his face Shone while he talked with
[21:44] him and when Aaron and all the children
[21:47] of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of
[21:49] his face Shone and they were afraid to
[21:51] come n to him he had physically been
[21:55] changed physically there was a Glory
[21:59] that was emanating radiating from his
[22:02] face because he had encountered the
[22:05] living reality of God and then we go
[22:09] down to verse 33 and 34 and till Moses
[22:12] had done speaking with them he put a
[22:14] veil on his face but when Moses went in
[22:18] before the Lord to speak with him he
[22:20] took that Veil off until he came out
[22:23] notice the veil was when he was speaking
[22:26] to the people but but when he went in to
[22:29] speak with God he took that Veil off and
[22:33] I encourage you to do the same thing any
[22:36] thing that stands between you and God
[22:38] put that aside and come before the Lord
[22:42] with the purest heart and uh well the
[22:45] best way to do that is come before him
[22:47] with repentance with a repentant heart
[22:49] that says Lord you've already paid the
[22:51] price for me but I'm a human and my
[22:54] nature sometimes opposes the law of the
[22:57] spirit and I pray that you will give me
[23:00] Grace as I enter into your presence to
[23:03] worship you and to lift you up because I
[23:05] want to know you try telling God that
[23:09] try uh somebody said well I can't word
[23:12] it that way well you know you might be
[23:13] surprised but sometime I feel the same
[23:16] way I feel like I have a lot more to
[23:18] express that I don't have the language
[23:20] and the vocabulary to express so you're
[23:23] not the only one that feels that way
[23:25] sometime but look he's your friend he's
[23:28] a friend that Stith closer than any
[23:31] brother and he wants to have fellowship
[23:35] with you that's an amazing thing to me
[23:38] that God wants to have fellowship with
[23:41] us and so I just uh encourage you to
[23:46] make that a reality in your life and
[23:48] come before him without a pretense
[23:51] without a veil especially the veil of
[23:55] religion some people get so caught CAU
[23:58] up in in the in the Trap of religion and
[24:01] they you know they think they have to
[24:03] come before God like they're like
[24:05] they're visiting the Queen of England I
[24:07] believe it's right to come before him
[24:09] holy and come before him with
[24:11] reverential fear but I believe that we
[24:14] can be honest with God why not we might
[24:17] as well be honest with him he already
[24:19] knows everything about us we're not
[24:22] hiding anything from him I believe God
[24:24] wants us to just say you know uh I I
[24:27] don't know if you ever do this or not
[24:28] but sometimes when I'm frustrated I tell
[24:31] the Lord Lord I'm just frustrated I need
[24:34] peace you're you're the God of Peace
[24:36] you're the prince of peace and I don't
[24:39] have any peace in my heart right now I
[24:41] feel turmoil I feel stress I'm tired I'm
[24:45] aggravated and I need you oh I hope
[24:49] you're I hope you're not offended by my
[24:52] talking to the Lord that way in fact I
[24:54] hope you'll take it as your example and
[24:56] I think that you you'll find that there
[24:58] will be a peace come over you and a
[25:01] relaxation and a a rest that will begin
[25:03] to come into your spirit and you can
[25:05] stop your striving and quit your labor
[25:08] and working so hard for God to love you
[25:12] I want you to know he loves you and he
[25:14] loves obedience yes of course he does
[25:17] but he loves you and he wants to draw
[25:20] you to himself let me pray for you right
[25:22] now and ask the Lord to draw you and I'm
[25:26] going to pray that you'll find the Grace
[25:28] to be drawable that you will stop
[25:30] resisting what God wants to do in your
[25:33] life and you'll just surrender to him in
[25:36] this hour father I thank you for this
[25:39] television congregation that you've
[25:41] given me today and I ask you Lord to in
[25:45] to move into their lives father the the
[25:48] veil of pretense the veil of religion
[25:51] that keeps us from being able to have
[25:53] Spirit top fellowship with you
[25:55] face-to-face encounter with you I pray
[25:58] that you will extend Grace right now in
[26:01] the matchless name of our Messiah that
[26:04] you will break off the fed the chain any
[26:07] bondage any resistance that's moving
[26:10] against the children of God and you will
[26:13] cause us to come into that place of
[26:15] fellowship with you like Moses was after
[26:19] when he began to cry out oh Lord Show Me
[26:22] Your Glory I pray that you will make
[26:25] that a living reality in those watching
[26:28] this program right now we ask these
[26:31] things in the mighty name of our savior
