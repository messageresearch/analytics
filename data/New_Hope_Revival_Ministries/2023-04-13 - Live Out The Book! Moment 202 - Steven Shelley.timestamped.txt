[0:00] and you want to make sure that when you
[0:02] get to the end of this race you have
[0:05] yielded yourself to every thought
[0:09] that God had about you in the beginning
[0:11] [Music]
[0:18] we're going to be judged one day
[0:22] we are
[0:23] somebody said well no no now not
[0:25] remember the bride
[0:27] is is being judged now that's right
[0:29] that's exactly right
[0:32] it's just not over with yet
[0:35] and one of the things that we're being
[0:37] examined about right now or if you want
[0:40] to say judged about right now
[0:42] is how much of our destiny book we're
[0:46] walking out
[0:48] in this hour
[0:50] and you want to make sure that when you
[0:52] get to the end of this race you have
[0:55] yielded yourself to every thought
[0:59] that God had about you in the beginning
[1:01] you want to know that you have obeyed
[1:04] him and and you know what's so amazing
[1:06] is God allows us it's not all in
[1:10] chronological order with no hope of of
[1:13] taking the test again or
[1:17] you know going through the trial again
[1:19] sometimes we have to repeat the test and
[1:21] repeat the test until we finally pass it
[1:25] and then another page of of our destiny
[1:28] story is marked off and we move on to
[1:30] what God has
[1:31] and there are things in that story that
[1:34] we would choose and there are things
[1:37] that we would not particularly choose
[1:40] but we have agreed
[1:43] we have agreed to those things how do
[1:47] you know that because we're here
[1:50] this little bride would have never been
[1:52] expressed in the Earth
[1:54] had she not agreed
[1:57] she agreed to come
[2:00] and be expressed in such an hour as this
[2:03] so The Good the Bad and the Ugly we said
[2:07] yes to
[2:09] and and let me just ask you what else
[2:12] would you say
[2:14] when God asks something of you would you
[2:17] would you really say no I don't think so
[2:20] no you'd say yes because you know that
[2:24] it takes the whole book
[2:26] you gotta you gotta live it all you've
[2:29] got to walk through it all you've gotta
[2:31] you've gotta choose it all so that at
[2:34] the end of this race
[2:36] even before you have a glorified body
[2:39] you are just like Jesus Christ
[2:48] now is that worth it
[2:51] it's worth it if you've got loved ones
[2:53] that need to meet him with skin on him
[2:56] such an hour as this
[2:58] it's worth him if you've got co-workers
[3:01] that you love and care about and nothing
[3:04] is going to move for them or help them
[3:06] accept the Jesus with skin on you
[3:09] then you and I are called to be that
[3:11] Jesus foreign
