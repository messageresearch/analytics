much we just appreciate all that God is doing in times like this and Benjamin's got a lot of work to do this week and is saving his voice today for the rest of the week but we didn't miss a Beat and being is going to help at the beginning of the meetings and we appreciate that too and uh we just have a lot to pray about and I I don't know why I keep feeling and we mention it but I keep feeling like we we've just got to really remember to pray for traveling mercies for those who are coming and I failed at the last minute to give a prayer request that was on my heart and that is there's a little dear sister among the former Amish Believers that we have had fellowship with for a couple of years now and love love love them and look forward to having some of them with us this week uh is it Ari how do you say the name Ari um who is very low with breast cancer and is unable to walk now and uh the family a lot of the sisters are staying close to her and ministering to her and taking care of the family we have asked the Lord for a miracle we've believed that God would touch her and so far it has not manifested but that doesn't mean that it won't yet some of the sisters will miss some of the Believers will miss getting to come to the meetings because they're wanting to be very close to her and I appreciate that would you try to remember her to the Lord every day as you as you pray and ask the Lord to to move on her behalf he's a prayer answering God he hasn't lost his power and he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above that which we could even ask or think and uh brother Greeley has greeted all the visitors we're glad to see you here and I need to mention to you streamers that there is the occasion where one of the platforms does not work for us it's not usually our fault but it just happens and uh because we're streaming across multiple platforms so let me just remind those of you who are streaming the different platforms where you can catch the services this week and most every Sunday our Sunday service is streamed live on Facebook and YouTube it is also streamed live on the New Hope Revival ministries app that you can download to your phone and it is streamed live on the website revival.org on Tuesday nights we only stream live on the website revival.org and the app but for the meetings this week we'll stream live on all four platforms Facebook YouTube the app and revival.org if you ever try one of those platforms and you're not seeing a stream as it happened a couple weeks ago go to the next just go down the line uh a lot of people have one that they prefer it seems that a lot of people are preferring YouTube these days uh and if you do that is perfectly fine God bless all of you who are streaming this service across the world from Italy God bless you Sister patience from Italy and for sister Hannah in Norway and in many other places these are the ones who have either put a flag the Netherlands God bless you have either put a flag or or told us where they're watching we appreciate every one of you and we don't want you missing and usually the phone starts lighting up because people say I can't get the stream I can't get the stream so we just encourage you to go to the next platform of your preference until you get us if something happens that we're nowhere to be found check the next day and it should be archived on the website and also on the uh app and I think occasionally we take it back to YouTube I think we've done that a time or two maybe uh anyway enough of that the services begin Tuesday night this week

to do that one more time for you you are miracles [Music] like you there is [Music] like you if you believe that give God another hand trap of Praise thank you thank you all [Applause] praise God praise God let's remain standing for the reading of the scriptures today we are studying the season that we are in this might go a little slow for some of you and perhaps it's old news but I felt really impressed of the Lord to go over a few of the themes of the Feast of Tabernacles or in Hebrew we call it Sukkot it is a time of real celebration it is a time of reflection if we are following the biblical calendar we have just come through the Feast of trumpets which is a solemn time it is a time that calls us to attention it will eventually sound on the day that our Lord comes and puts his feet on the Mount of Olives he will completely fulfill all of the Feast of Trumpets on that day then we have celebrated and we say celebrate Loosely we have commemorated we have studied the day of atonement Yom Kippur last weekend where we are reminded that one sacrifice one lamb the Lamb of God he only had to suffer and die once and he did in one moment what all the blood the lambs and goats and Bulls was never able to accomplish he came shed God's blood and in that moment mankind was redeemed those who would be called and those who would have fellowship with him and so now we are at the Feast of Weeks or we have come to the Feast of booths or sukkotes or Tabernacles Jonathan has been like I have and some of you others have been in Jerusalem during this feast and it's one of the most exciting times to be there uh let's just let me let me do this real quick you'll have to forgive me I I never thought to do this charity I'm sending you two pictures I want you to show these pictures I think everybody will enjoy seeing these give her just a moment to put these up don't be afraid of Silence there's coming a 30-minute period of Silence it's going to be very very important right we're not doing radio that's not dead air I I I texted him to her instead of airdrop because I don't pick her up on airdrop and even if I did it would take me too long to do it do you believe the Jews take this building the booths seriously they build them everywhere they can and I don't have the picture I didn't save the picture but that look at this one this is in Yemen Moshe which is the most Orthodox area of Jerusalem but in many neighborhoods even secular neighborhoods you will see hundreds of booths that are built to commemorate this time and I even saw one uh had a picture of one sent to me that I'm just not sure I would have been in it it was so precariously perched on the edge of a uh a small balcony they have small balconies sometime where only two people can sit very very crowded they have taken the rail off and had extended temporarily the balcony with a wooden floor and with two two by fours two angled up underneath I said either they're only Entertaining Angels are their Mighty skinny family I wouldn't dare get out on that one Leviticus 23 and 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts I'll read that again and the Lord spake unto Moses saying verse 1 and then verse 2 speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are would you read those two words my Feasts he didn't say Jews he didn't say Jewish feasts he didn't say the Feast of Israel the Lord said these are my holy days these are my set apart times these are the feasts of the Lord even these are my feasts father we come to you today Desiring to understand the importance of the foundation of the Old Testament it is the older Covenant upon which the newer Covenant has been built every page of that older Testament points us to the reality that is fulfilled in You O Lord it gives us a broader picture and a clearer vision of what you really came to accomplish Lord I Thank you for the dress rehearsals I thank you for the feasts of the Lord and though we don't observe them like the Jews might feel of the necessity to keep them and very afraid that they might do it Loosely or they might choose the wrong lulav and they have a tremendous amount of anxiety over it we we don't feel the call for for the necessity of such things but we do believe that it's important in this hour for us to see the foundation upon which our faith is resting so give us Grace to study together today let your anointing come even in a teaching like this let your anointing come and open our understanding and let us see you clearly on every page that is mentioned today and we will give you glory and honor and presence and and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said amen you may be I want to show you because there are times that people around the message do not seem to understand the importance and when someone doesn't understand the importance they they often make fun of those who do a church I would like to ask you not to be that kind of a people from my heart I I would like to ask you not to make fun of things you don't understand I would I'd like for you not to be a critical people but a people that build up you you might have to look a little harder but you can find something good in what people are accomplishing for the Lord amen and I don't want you to if you if you come across a a group of people that don't worship the way we worship or have the same order of events and they don't put the same importance on things that we might and we may not put the importance on things that they do let's just get along with them the best we can and pray for them and love them not waste any of this precious hour the hours of the end that we're living in now let's don't waste any of that criticizing other churches or other people let them do as they are called to do let them emphasize what they want to emphasize because I've seen in other places the times and Seasons I have watched the I've watched many churches now participating in things that they once condemned and in some cases that's a good thing and in other cases it's a it's not such a good thing but but people will shift as season shift I want to thank God for this little church today I want to thank God for you people because you have weathered the storm and you have stayed with the spirit of God as he has led us from one thing to the next as we have desired to understand the word so if what we're going to share today is not your cup of tea I just ask you for a little bit of indulgence especially to you that are streaming maybe you have never taken the time to look and to see what brother Branham taught us about the Feast of the Lord maybe you've never taken the time to to look at all the things that he told us concerning Israel and concerning Jerusalem there is a little book we don't have it uh brother Zach this actually came from your church I ordered it through the mail uh and and you can go there and get it uh it is a a quote book I know that seems archaic to most of you I have not digitalized this yet but I will eventually as I do all the quote books I will eventually pull them all together and and print them in a PDF so that you can have them but I've not done this yet but I just wanted to show you I know you can't see the pages but I just wanted to show you brother Dale catch uh is uh the one who put this together and uh I I just wished I could show you I just don't have any way of of showing you I've never dealt a deck of cards so I what's that can anybody do are you getting my point I'm belaboring the point because I want you to get it so so don't tell me as some have tried to tell us are you you know you're you're emphasizing the Jews or you're emphasizing Israel too much or you're you're mentioning the feast too much or you're hung in the Old Testament or even people have said you must think you have some special role to the Jews well I actually do I believe the bride does not me as an individual but me as a part of the corporate bride I believe if I heard the prophet right he said they brought it to us and it's our responsibility to take it to them that's all I believe that's all I believe I I don't believe that it's any one church or any one person I just believe that there's going to be a way I don't know how but there's going to be a way that the Jewish Remnant will catch a hole they'll hear the truth and they're not just looking for something to hear they're looking for something to live they want to see something lived out in front of them do you follow what I'm saying so don't ever think that he didn't mention it uh and I don't know I don't have any way of knowing if this is all I it doesn't say that it's all but it just divides the quotations into paragraphs and in this particular quote book there are 210 pages of things that brother Branham said over and over again watch the Jews watch Israel watch Jerusalem he said the Jews are God's timepiece Israel God's time he sometimes said Jerusalem it's God's timepiece so it's an important thing for us to to understand how that everything the prophet brought us it sets as the newer Covenant on top of the foundation of the older Covenant or what we call the Old Testament I want them to put up for you uh my translation and I only say that because I have combined several different versions of these scriptures and in order to do it they had to had to scooch them on there for you to be able to see but I have combined several versions of Leviticus 23 1 and 2 and in brackets I have put the Hebrew words and I'm going to go over them with you in in the form of a teaching in just a moment before we get to what I really want to share and the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to the children of Israel and say to them the feasts and the word for feast is mohead let me hear you say moed it's a beautiful word it's a beautiful I like saying moed and to make moed plural we don't add an s in Hebrew we don't add an S to make something plural does anybody know what we add we add I am in English transliteration which mean which is pronounced IM so we say the mo edim let me say it right Moe edim I have to really concentrate on saying it because there's a beautiful little village that sits right outside of Jerusalem called moda in and sometimes I'll preach and say mode I don't want you to think moda in I want you to think Mo Ed IM moedim the Feast of the Lord which you shall proclaim the word proclaim there is Kara can you say Kara to be holy and the word for Holy is kodesh let me hear you say kodesh remember singing the chorus here kodesh all right so these are holy kodesh convocations the word convocations in Hebrew is mikra I want to hear you say mikra these are my Feasts are my moadim and then Leviticus 23 4 these are the feasts the moad of the Lord holy qodesh convocations mikra which you shall Proclaim Quran at their appointed times moed now if you look at that you'll see that there are various English words used to describe a single Hebrew word and we find that anytime we translate one language to another would you put up the Hebrew word moed for us and uh if you you like to make notes this is a time for you to do it we're teaching first and preaching in a little while moed it even gives you the pronunciation moed Strong's number 4150 and it means appointed place appointed time appointed meeting sacred season I like that one set Feast appointed season appointed sign original tent of meeting when we read in the Old Testament concerning the Tabernacle in the wilderness moed is a word that can also be used in referring to the first tent of meeting where God met with the children of Israel so it means either an appointed place or an appointed time can it mean both it absolutely can and does so when we read in Scripture that God has set some times and Seasons aside it's it's different when I say how about you going to lunch with me on Friday that's an appointment that's an engagement right and it may or may not be sacred depending on what we eat if we're going for wings you might not be able to call that a sacred engagement but if we're going for grass you know like like salads or something like that or something healthy you you might you might say that's a special a special meeting but that's not what kind of meetings these are these are highly chosen times that God says I want to meet with you in a particularly significant way I want to come among you and show you who I am now I can come 365 days of the year how many of you know we can but he said I want to especially set aside some times where you are expecting me to come now every church has a time of special meetings and you know what I don't have any problem calling that a moed because it's an appointed meeting and an appointed place with an appointed time and with an appointed agenda we're going to meet with the Lord we're going to hear the word of God preached we're going to ask the Holy Spirit to come and say Amen to the word we're going to believe for bodies to be healed and Minds to be made whole we're going to believe for the lost to be found the backslid to come back to God for though many to receive the Holy Ghost and re-fillings of the Holy Ghost we're going to make it a time of rejoicing and that's what we're entering into this week a mohead so I don't want you to think that we're making this something that is not we are well within the definition of the word we have appointed a time we have chosen to come every year during the Feast of Tabernacles it just so happens that we have chosen our moed on one of God's moed and I like that it doesn't have to be that way I saw a church in the message in South America last year I think it was who called their meeting the Feast of Tabernacles and they had it sometime in the spring it doesn't matter to me but I like the idea of us having our holy convocation our appointed time in an appointed season reflecting on the original tent of meeting I like that because I'm believing that he's going to come hello help me a little bit he's going to come and meet with us how many of you want to meet him every time every time brother every time we come we want to meet him and I don't believe that it has to be a particular time on God's calendar for him to meet with us but I like the idea of calling our moed uh during his moed because brother Branham said the Feast of Tabernacles is an eternal feast yes I'll give it to you in a little while he said it's an eternal one it never even after it is fulfilled it never passes away now if God thinks that Tabernacles is important I believe I will and if you ever doubt it just check us out don't take my word for it check us out now the second word of our study if you'll put that up is the word Kara and that word Kara is translated in Leviticus 23 as Proclaim I want you to know that Proclaim doesn't mean just to say you can say something without proclaiming it don't don't don't get too distracted there before we read that but but let me ask you this what do you think that what would be the difference in in saying something and proclaiming something what be the first thing would come to your mind you know what I love that the best I hadn't thought of it quite like that uh I was thinking along the line of volume you know the difference between saying or Whispering or just speaking and proclaiming it but I actually like yours the best say it again brother Austin confidence confidence in saying it oh I think that'll preach God wasn't whispering to his children about when he wanted them to gather to meet him he wasn't having the prophet Moses just to whisper it or just say it nonchalantly in conversation he said Proclaim that news tell all Israel I want to meet with them do you understand the magnitude of God wanting to meet with his children doesn't bless your blesser to know that he wants to meet with you he wants to come to you and Minister the God of all eternity wants to minister to your needs he wants to bring with him everything that you and I have need of and he said to Israel I'm going to do it seven different times within the year now that doesn't mean because we know that God promised to meet with his children every day we know that he promised to particularly draw nigh to the household of Israel on Sabbath on the Shabbat which is a weekly meeting so you can meet with God daily you can meet with God weekly and then you can meet with God over those seven Feasts of the Lord not Jewish feast I want to say it again we've Fallen under quite a bit of criticism for mentioning the Jews Feasts come and hold this Alias you'll need it they don't belong to the Jews they don't belong to the Gentiles they don't belong to only the citizens of the nation of Israel they belong to the to the Lord and the word Lord in Hebrew is what Adonai so they are adonai's they belong to him they are his feasts now when he tells us in Leviticus 23 Proclaim them say it again Quran which means to call now the first thing I think of when I hear to call I think about invite I'm calling you up on the phone and I'm telling you that the greatest I don't know why I always think of food maybe because I've unfortunately got my belly out there so I can see it I guess that may be why I think so much I'm seeing it more I I I'm gonna call you up and I'm going to invite you to come to Chili Thai which is the best Thai restaurant in the world they went out of business for a couple years and we prayed them back in business and it's good over there and as I discovered last night is good at home too just swing by and bring it home no added sugar so you can be thankful it's not it's not phony baloney Chinese food it's good and if I if I call you up and and say we're going to meet over here uh on a certain night it's an invitation so when we see the word proclaim brother Austin told us that it has something to do with a confident oh I'm just really going to hang on that a minute the confidence that you have when you say a certain thing so preaching is like proclaiming isn't it because you better have some confidence in the god you're talking about right and so to call to call out to recite to read aloud to cry out Proclaim cry utter allowed sound to call unto to Proclaim to summon to invite to call for call and commission a point to be called to be proclaimed to be summoned to be named to be called out to be chosen every one of those appears in the in the Lexicon somebody wanted us to make sure we understood the the whole width of the word proclaim God said I want you to Proclaim to my people that I'm going to set aside some time every year you don't have to worry I'm going to keep the Earth spinning I'm going to keep the sun in this place I'm going to keep the stars in their place I'm going to keep weather in its place but I'm going to come and meet with my children during some special times of the year it's going to be a dress rehearsal it's going to be a time to learn to observe to participate in because one day you're going to see that for every shadow that is mentioned in the Feast of the Lord Jesus our Messiah Our Savior has come to fulfill that he did not come to destroy the law he came to fulfill the law to fill it up and to help us to understand that God was using the sacrificial system he was using the offering system he was using both the Tabernacle and the temple to point to something greater to something more beautiful Hebrews says to something more tangible to something that every one of us can participate in you don't have to be physically circumcised you don't have to be a Jew by by birth God said I'm going to do something that the one new man can participate in Paul said there's one new man that was God's goal he wanted to bring a one new man he wanted to prepare a people both among the Jews and among the Gentiles that he could call out for his name did you know your people of the name tell your neighbor I'm a people of the name I've been called out by his name I've been chosen by his name Hallelujah I've been set apart sanctified by his name I am a people of the book not just the Jews are the people of the book but as a bride of Christ I'm part of the people of the book I've been brought in Hallelujah and I wasn't an afterthought this Gentile way this God calling Out Among the Gentiles a people for his name was not an afterthought he had you in his mind he said I'm going to minister to my own first and then I'm going to have me unknown I'm going to find me a people out there an original thought I'm going to find me a people out there whose mothers may not have been Jewish whose fathers may not have been Jewish but I saw them before the foundation of the world I'm going to engraft them into the heart of Israel I'm going to make them one new man and that's why the sonship message that brother Branham brought to us is a message that can be it can be summarized in this particular context by saying hey the Jew is you let me let that sink in just a moment the Jew is you because God wasn't looking in this hour when he's building this last day bride he's not looking for the prerequisites of a natural-born Israelite he's looking for those who have the seed of God Hallelujah and and the rabbi doesn't tell us where the seed of God is the preachers can't tell you who gets the seed of God it was God's choosing it was God's election it was God's predestination that chose who I replaced the seed so you can feel very privileged and very honored and very valuable because though you may not have the Jewish natural heritage you have an inheritance of everything that God promised to the Natural Jew that was kind of weak you've got a Homeland it's not just the Natural Born Jew that's got a Homeland how many of you have got a Homeland we're gonna step over into that promise over into that Homeland sooner rather than later if you believe that same man thank you for staying with me now finally we've covered uh Kara finally we're going to go to a two-word phrase kodesh which means holy and mikra now kodesh means a partners what a strange word it it means sanctified to sanctify something means to set it apart for use brother Branham gives us that example of finding the jelly jar or the glass out in the in the in the farmyard and it's been laying there some some child drank some milk or something out of it and left it out on the porch and and the elements knocked it off the porch or or the cat God forbid you know right away that wasn't my house but the cat knocked the glass off and it lay there in the weather and it rained and the dirt blew and the next thing you know that glass is almost buried there to Never Be Remembered again when all of a sudden brother random said God himself comes what he sees that there dirty not fit for use too dirty too nasty to drink out of but a glass it was created to drink out of it hasn't busted it hasn't broke it still has the potential of drinking out of it somebody's just gotta set it apart somebody's got to pick it up from where it was do you remember when he found you you didn't find him he found you do you remember when he found you and he picked you up from your worldly friends he picked you out from your ungodly environment [Applause] circumstance of your of your sin Hallelujah and he said this one's mine always was always was remember the story twice mine I made you mine and then I cleaned you up and bought you to be mine Hallelujah so then he said you take it in and you wash it out in the kitchen and you get all the dirt and the grime and the residue out and now you can fill it up with whatever you doesn't matter whether it's water or wine you can put anything in it and it has now been it's now fit for drinking it is now fit for service it is now fit for use there's nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ and His holy word revealed to us that can redeem us back to such an extent that we can now be anything God wants us to be he just fills us with who he is and he says now you're mine you are exclusively my treasure you are my secular my peculiar treasure the king had a treasure that he valued above all the other treasures and it was called secular and no wonder he comes and says to us through the Apostle you're a chosen generation you are a holy people hallelujah The Peculiar people a holy nation that you should show forth the Praises of him who's called you out of the out of their yard into His Marvelous and then you're put in service because now you become one of those who are full of light you are you become one of those who are full of love and you become one of those that even the Jews can come to and say take a hold of your garment and ask you who are you what is this that you carry why is it that you shine so now my sons are here and they're old enough to remember things like this happening to us in Jerusalem you know when you begin to see God's word come to pass it'll shock you and it shouldn't we should expect it to come to pass but there were multiple times not just one time but but a significant number of times that we would just be doing what everybody else was doing in Jerusalem we're shopping in the market we're getting our vegetables we're we're buying our olives and cheese and whatever we're going to need for the week and on more than one occasion a Jew even an orthodox Jew run up to us and say why is that light coming out of your face well I didn't know there was light coming out of my face but you see the Bible said they will come to you they'll take a hold of you they'll want to know what your faith is they'll want to know what you've got and that's when the interview comes that's when they start asking you what you believe and when you tell them you believe in Messiah they'll say oh are you like those Christian churches down in The Old City and you say to them no because you're not Catholic and you're not Orthodox and Jews especially in Middle Eastern Jews they believe that all Gentiles Are pagan and that all Gentiles worship idols because their their biggest introduction to Christianity is the Catholic church and they pass by the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and they see the Catholics kissing the speed of statues and so the first thing they think of as a Christian is an idolater and then they begin to want to question you about what kind of food you eat and then they want to question you and here's the kicker they'll say well down there in the in in the in the entrance of the Old City all those churches they put up Christmas trees and they teach their children about Santa Claus and I don't want any part of that and if you're some of them we don't want any part I don't I don't even have to ask you any more questions imagine the look on their face when we explain to them that we are non-pagan Christians and we understand that all of that belongs to the pagans of the world it doesn't belong to the faith and then they start saying tell me more I'll never forget the last one who did us that way I begin to tell tell him more I begin to share with him and he runs away he doesn't walk away he runs away and I'm thinking what did I do what did I say how did I offend him and I just said to the family maybe he saw somebody that he knew and he didn't want them to see him talking to us if God has given us this appointment he'll come back around and you know what it was probably about 45 minutes to an hour later that we were on a side street I remember what we were buying we were buying those big old beautiful dates that come across from Turkey big beautiful dates and I was buying a tray of those big beautiful dates to bring back here for our for our Passover time and and was enjoy and here he come along he said I got a couple more questions I want to ask you now that was just an isolated incident but it gave me some understanding of how there's coming a day there's coming an hour that even the Jews who who don't understand who have no real grid for what Christ has really done they'll become hungry and I believe we're living in that hour where many are already hungry we know that the majority of the Jews will not come in until Jesus stands on the Mount of Olives but according to scripture one new man is made up of both you and Gentile and so even in the hour of the Bride there will be some Jews that are a part of that one new man who will see what God is doing in your life in the life of the bride and they will begin to ask you tell me about your faith I want to know what it is that you represent and you're given an opportunity to tell them none of this is is possible without the Lord Jesus Christ he satisfies everything the law demands he fulfills everything the scripture has laid out he's the one that I'm following so kodesh is a partners holiness sacredness I'll wait on you to put that back up separateness set apartness so it's holy it's sacred it's separate Micra it can mean convocation convoking reading and calling together but I like the last one the best sacred assembly I will meet you there I will meet you there do you need another example look at Joel 2 15. I'm going to ask you to come real close to me now for just a few minutes and let me get some of this out so that we can not not be here all day Joel chapter 2 verse 15 blow blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast read the rest of it for me a mikra a mohead I want to meet with you the very first thing that we notice in that verse of scripture as I have mentioned already two times that these are not the feasts of Israel they are not the Feast of the Jews they are Feast of the Lord in in Leviticus 23 3 he begins to mention first the Sabbath six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest and holy convocation there's your word again a a kodesh mikra ye shall do no work therein it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all of your dwellings so in Leviticus 23 he mentions the Sabbath first because this is a weekly time that God says I want to meet with you I'm going to be very honest with you I don't believe your Sabbath has to be on a particular day of the week I remember it's Friday evening is leaving us on Saturday I remember that that was the Sabbath that the Jews kept but I believe that God was more than anything else he was looking to teach his people I want you to give me some of Who You Are I want you to give me some time because it's a whole lot different in 2023 than it was in the desert in in Egypt coming out of Egypt you didn't have a lot of things to keep you busy back then we're living in an hour now where it's not always feasible for you to set aside a whole day but I believe God is just looking for you to understand that he gives us this rest it is a rest that is promised to the people of God and if you if you want to set Sunday aside as your day then I think that's absolutely fine it's not the Sabbath but it can be your Sabbath we come because we are reminded of the resurrection of Jesus Christ I don't believe we should become Fanatics I don't believe we should become Adventist I believe we should understand that these are dress rehearsals to point us to the reality that the message has brought to us now I want you to see the order of the feast if you'll put that up there there are seven feasts of the Lord number one the Passover number two the Feast of unleavened bread number number three the Feast of first fruits number four the Feast of Pentecost now these first four Feast of the Lord are what we call the spring feast because they all take place in the spring of the year and every one of those four has Jesus written all over it amen he's Lord in the Passover he was Lord in unleavened bread he raised from the dead and resurrected and Lord of the Feast of the firstfruits and then uh on the day of Pentecost he came 50 days later and poured out the same spirit that was in him didn't he do it he said I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you I'm going to endure you with dunamis I'm going to endure you to fill you to infuse you with power from on high and then we have the last three number five the Feast of trumpets number six the day of atonement number seven the Feast of Tabernacles all of these three feasts we call the fall Feast because they fall in Autumn time in the fall season on the Gregorian calendar I want to I want to read you a verse of scripture before we go much further in Hebrews 4 verses 9 and 10 in the Amplified see if this will help you so then there is still awaiting a full and complete Sabbath rest reserved for the true people of God who wrote this we believe the Apostle Paul under inspiration of the Holy Spirit we believe he wrote this to the Church of the Hebrews meaning Jews who had come to receive Yeshua or Jesus as their Messiah and so Paul in the book of Hebrews he directs everything to the completed Jew to those who have come to understand that Jesus Yeshua is the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets he has a very unique and a very important job to do and he did a very dangerous thing in a verse like this because he says to the people you may continue to meet week after week after week and you may continue to honor the weekly Sabbath but I need you to know that there is yet a rest that has not yet been fulfilled now how is it that Jesus has already come and the Sabbath rest has not completely been fulfilled because he's pointing to Millennium brother random said he's pointing to the eighth feast which is the Eighth Day which is the eighth one thousand years and how many of you know that's the Millennium and he is pointing to that time of rest where the lamb will lay down with the lion a little children will play a little babe on the whole of the poisonous snake a little child will lead him the wolf Will Be Tamed the the the the the leper gentle that will be a complete reversal of the curse that was placed on all of creation you talk about rest you talk about honeymoon come on and help me now you talk about honeymoon Christ the bridegroom and his little elected lady bride one thousand years of Sabbath rest and here Paul is pointing to it he said so then there is still awaiting a fool and complete Sabbath rest reserved for the true people of God and he goes on to say for he who has once entered God's rest also has ceased from the weariness and pain of human labors just as God rested from those labors peculiarly his own the the Apostle is pointing to the same rest that we learned about in Hebrews other chapters of Hebrews where he's telling us there's a rest that remains and that rest is to take the word of God that we hear and mix it with faith so that it has complete jurisdiction so that it has complete Authority in our lives and that word transforms us we sit under the word and the Holy Spirit reveals the the truth of that word and The Germ of that word that we catch by the spirit it begins to transform us out of the realm of Flesh and into the realm of word if you believe that's what he taught let me hear you say Amen and here the scripture is pointing in that direction in Deuteronomy 16 16 if you're helping me I appreciate it because I believe I'm doing what the Lord had me to do today three times in a year shall all your males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose in the Feast of the unleavened bread which we know is Passover it overlaps and in the Feast of Weeks which we know is Shavuot or Pentecost and in the Feast of Tabernacles which we know is Sukkot and they shall not appear before the Lord empty you got to bring something when you come I want you to bring something this week I want you to bring your faith I want you to bring your praise I want you to bring your worship I want you to leave your distraction in the car I want you to leave your worries at home I want you to leave your fears on the outside when you walk through those doors I want you to imagine that you are walking behind the veil and that God is going to meet with us here as the word Goes Forth this week and as the Holy Ghost comes to say Amen I'm not kidding you I'm exhorting you as your pastor you open up those doors and imagine that you're walking in to a holy convocation a time that God has set apart to come Among Us and to show out so that when the week is over and the holy convocation is over and we're no longer dwelling in the mohead and we go back to our comfortable homes may it be that we can say of a surety I'll never be the same I have met with the Lord in an unusual and sacred way why because you you put intention and purpose and confidence in coming you didn't just say oh another camp meeting you know the Lord was talking to me this week about what Revival would look like in a local assembly if we were to really break out into something that would cause great deliverances among us because we still believe that God wants to revive his own and we know that Revival is not a corporate event it's an individual event but you get a bunch of people together who are experiencing a a personal Revival and and it's contagious it becomes an atmosphere shift over the ground and over the sanctuary and over our over everything we do let me tell you something when you enter in and I'm just going to ask you to wake up those of you that are sleeping I don't want to I don't want to be I want to be real nice but I just would like you very much to be awake for this I know that we can sometimes absorb while we're sleeping but I just feel like I've spent a lot of effort here and I would just like for you to show just that little bit of extra something I'm not talking to the elders I'm not talking to the seniors I'm not talking to those who who their sleep is interrupted at night I'm talking about those who can certainly program yourself here just a moment because I want you to be one of the ones I want our young men and our young women to be some of the ones who say this isn't just going to be another week of meetings Casey's posting I can't wait I'm I'm looking forward to what God's going to do for me at camp meeting and that's already getting the right kind of vibe I don't want to say Vibe and you think I mean something strange but the right kind of I started to say Groove that sounds worse sphere I'll be holy the right kind of atmosphere moving I believe if we would look at every it'd be great if we could look to every Sunday with that kind of enthusiasm but right now I'm just trying to I I've been pondering all week long what would it look like what what did it look like if something like that broke out Among Us and and we were here to midnight every night when God shows up services that normally end at nine go on till past ten when God's in the house and when people begin to worship they might even go into the 11 hour and might break the 12th hour it's not some kind of contest we're not trying to see how long we can be here but we're just saying your life may be inconvenience just a little bit if you ever get the answer to what you're praying for so be careful what you pray I want real Deliverance to Break Out Among Us do you is that why you come in 30 minutes after we start in case we stay 30 minutes longer than normal I got to thinking and I thought some who complained some who go AWOL some who go missing when it comes time to to bring a casserole I knew it was going to get quiet I anticipated this can't get response don't know where they are don't know what they're doing and when I think of people like that and I mean people who habitually are that way who make no effort doesn't matter how dirty the church gets doesn't matter how big the weeds are I know it's going to be quiet I I'm the only one that can preach like this here brother Greeley can hit at it but it's my risk my resp it's not anybody else's responsibility to bring correction to the house the Bible said we must show the house to the house I'm putting a mirror up here don't just pray Lord let us have a breakout Revival and a great outpouring of Deliverance if you're not willing to be inconvenienced a little bit your everyday life to have a move a sovereign move of God a real convocation with God that goes beyond the weak it would require that there is some rearranging in our life we might have to give up some of our Hobbies we might even have to miss some of our entertainments we might have to make more casseroles than we think we can possibly stand even you who are a little sickly are a little weak you might have to come and dust the corner and do it in Jesus name that's how you get through it help me somebody we do it in Jesus name those who show up to eat but don't show up to work those who show up to eat or to or to celebrate but don't show up to pray your life may have to be arranged if God were to come and answer our prayers get ready [Applause] God said I'll take care of you in in Exodus 34 24 and then I'm going to read something from the prophet Exodus 34 24 for I will cast out the Nations before you shut up excuse me excuse me who for I will cast out the Nations before you and enlarge your borders any good somebody tell me how good he is oh he's good he's so good I wanted to behave today Hallelujah thank you Lord Satan wants to bind you he wants to box you in he wants you to get used to church as usual that's why I have to I just have to refuse a church order from the Branham Tabernacle amen I don't believe it was ever said or preached with the intention of boxing people in I believe it was set to be some kind of example of how you start you don't have to say anything the whole concept of just singing three songs gets on my last nerve what if what if God what if you've got an anointed worship leader who prayed who actually prayed about what they're saying and who said we better do one more somebody said we've been singing that one 10 minutes what if the leader feels like we ought to sing it five more you don't want to be boxed in I noticed that message churches are allowing people to jump and shout and dance at the end of the service what if God wants to show up in the worship before the preaching why don't we say I don't want to be boxed in I don't want anything to shut me in I want God to break out [Music] on May the 30th I wrote this I didn't intend to ever I don't know if I was ever going to bring it to you I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings some of the young people were playing volleyball having a good time but they couldn't agree on what was inbounds and out of bounds you know there's a great key to that it's a spiritual application keep your eyes open don't let anything if that's your responsibility you mean you see what I mean if you're if you're the line judge is that what they call them you ought to get in there and squint you ought to make sure that nobody hollering nobody's screaming nobody back talking smack talking front talking I'm getting loose this morning ain't I just follow your position if your position is to see whether it's and so some of the young Brothers there they they wanted to fix it so that it would be a little bit easier they thought maybe they would they would cut out some fights and some disagreements because sometimes people go home mad I know it's hard for you to believe it even happens in my family a lot now I won't apologize to you I'm sorry that you ever see it because there's nothing that goes on out there that's near as important that's what goes on in here I'd let it go if I were you I'd grow up I'd let it go if you think somebody's cheating not let it go if you think somebody's doing something on purpose I'd let it go I don't want to preach on that oh did that sound a little Jerry Clower and I said oh so some of the little brothers they said we'll I mean I don't know I wouldn't hear but they said we'll just put some boundaries here so that everybody can see the actual because the lines were faded and it seems like a very legitimate and good idea I I even think in my mind it's a good idea and so they took some nails and uh and they took some string don't go nowhere unless you have to I'll be back I'm coming you can I saved it you'll know why I did a minute it's funny go ahead and laugh now because you can't laugh in a minute they took these nails I mean I wouldn't drive Nails in Asphalt knowing cars are going to be around but that's not the point these say H3 on them they took these nails and they put the corners out and they took this beautiful cord which you can't get back I want to hold on to it if you don't mind and I drove on to the campground and God spoke he began to speak to me now I know that he'll talk to you if you listen there was a spirit there's something spiritual going on and when something spiritual goes on any of us can come under that are you with me the good the bad or the ugly well Jonathan's been around long enough to know he's seen these kinds of things brother Greeley has seen these kinds of things and you just can sometimes come under an anointing that's you don't even know what you're doing you just feel like you're doing the most logical thing and there's not a brother there that would have done anything wrong there was not a brother there that would have done anything without Authority or or to show or to take something away from the leadership it was it was simply to show you where the boundaries are you understand that so if you know who all then you just forget that and don't ever mention it again but God spoke to me unexpectedly I'm losing my breath just now because this is so serious at the moment it was so serious May 30th is when I wrote this down the spirit of God said they are using illegitimate Authority to form illegal boundaries tear them down now that wasn't all he said that that's I only got part of it there I just don't know me that there was only part of it there brother Greeley if you happen to remember it was two parts and for some reason I only got one part down illegal Authority for legal boundaries and then and then illegitimate then illegitimate authority to form illegal boundaries tear them down I shook nobody put them there to form boundaries in the natural but in the spirit it forms something and then the spirit of the Lord took me to 10 acres that had joined this church that we tried so desperately to purchase and they offered him to us and then wouldn't let us no matter how we went up to meet the to meet the demand they eventually then sent word through a real estate agent that they were just going to hold on to it for a while no access to that property except through this property you're going to have to drive through this property to get to that property and yet you won't amend for it and then I saw I saw the connection I saw it in the spirit that the enemy was trying to use illegitimate authority to to to border us does that I hope I don't throw you crazy to put us in boundaries you'll you'll always be 60-something Acres instead of the 10 if you'll remember there was an announcement made in service one night that said we by the grace of God we now have 70 acres for the Eagles Refuge Campground and then when we tried to buy it it wouldn't and I realized this is not a this is not a flesh that there was nobody called you understand I I wished I wasn't doing this with visitors here but the whole world's watching some of them some of them in in in in the natural mind you would make no connection at all but God is just saying I want to have it's my authority that establishes the boundaries of this piece of property that I've set apart remember remember that a MOAB can be a chosen place and I don't mean this is some blessed area for the world to come to it's my blessed area it's your blessed area it's what God has given us to serve him with I'm not announcing it as a lighthouse for the world I'm not saying you got to come and join us I'm just saying as as a vision for this house it must be God who dictates the boundaries of this property we must not let the devil tell us how big we are or how small we are we must allow God to make the decision because every action in the natural is connected just about just about to Something in the spirit you hear Brother random turning that thing around sometimes he says the spiritual tap's the natural sometimes he says the natural types of spiritual you say which is it both it depends on where it happens first sometimes it's decided in heaven first and has to be brought to the Earth sometimes somebody on the earth catches the mind of Heaven and proclaims it with confidence and Heaven goes to action if you intercessors understand that I want you to praise the Lord I want you to praise him [Music] for I I gotta hurry for I will cast you out the Nations before you for I will cast out the Nations before you and so you're not going to come you Spirit of hell and box us in brother if I want to dance before the preaching I'm going to dance as long as I don't interrupt the preaching and if the preacher's dancing while he preaches maybe you can do I don't know maybe you could we've come too far in this thing to get so starchy oh I had a good text today I ought not to tell from who I don't think I will but I had a good text from somebody who's who is uh has relatives here in the service but they don't come to church here because of a little text that I sent out Friday about sometimes people will say things I recently had an email from somebody who said you know I see so much noise I hear so much noise in your services I see so much jumping around it just looks like a bunch of chaos to me and I just can't imagine Jesus don't you just love it when people speak for Jesus who hadn't been with him for years they know so much about him that they left him in the corner they're so used to his presence they just left him in the corner with dirty feet don't you start washing his feet if you do they'll get upset and so somebody said I just can't imagine Jesus dancing I know how the message people love to quote that Jesus wasn't a Jew and that's right because his blood came from God his father not from his Earthly mother or father but let me tell you something he grew up in a Jewish Home he worshiped God as a Jew he understood the Passover like a Jew would he slept in a Suka like a Jew would during Tabernacles come on and I want you to know that dancing is so much a part of of the Hebrew Church not just the Jewish people but the Hebrew Church the one you read about in the book of Hebrews that nobody even found it necessary to mention music much in the New Testament because it was already such a part of worship and everyone knew that when Jews came to Christ they didn't give up their rejoicing and they didn't give up their dancing and so you just might be surprised what I think but I believe that Jesus probably celebrated at weddings and in other Jewish holy times with a little bit of dancing [Music] I have no scripture that he did you have no scripture that he didn't so save your emails for somebody that cares really really but here's what I notice we don't have a scripture that says he danced or shouted or jumped or rejoiced but we got lots of scriptures that tell us that everyone he touched [Music] rejoiced everyone in touch came out of their boxes everyone in touch got out of their boundaries oh everybody moved around walking and leaping and praising them [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah he takes us out of our comfort zone he gives us something to Rejoice about he gives us something to celebrate [Applause] oh Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] everyone I'm going to read this don't tell him he said good morning thank you for sending these out every Friday I so enjoy them I do believe Jesus danced he said David was a man after God's Own Heart he was a dancing man don't move the camera don't don't go on the crowd because I want to say this to these three children sitting right there in the back it was your granddaddy who sent this to me I don't want to call him out for doing it but I want them to know who it is don't put the camera on them he said I do believe Jesus danced David was a man after God's Own Heart and he was a dancing man he said I know you know all the scriptures on dance and worship but a scripture came to me this morning John 21 25 what does that say somebody get it I didn't look it up we're going to go home after a while John 21 this blessed me I tell you about danced in the bedroom this morning oh what a good verse so he danced in the books that weren't written I would rather believe that he settled than to believe [Music] the Mariah system he came to Buck that dead dry system he came to turn over the tables of a dead dry religious system and he said also Pastor Jesse Smith said something about Jesus danced in his logos that got me so excited I want to share with you because I know what and how you believe about dance and worship I just knew there had to be an answer about Jesus dancing why would why would have such a why would we have such a desire to do so if our husband didn't he said excuse my uneducated Topic in word and I know you're familiar with Jesse Smith I'll send you the link I think you will uh like glean and expand on it and like the text and I did see it but I didn't watch it I had already seen it but he put out a YouTube video uh see it right there Bible teaching on dancing dance a Bible teaching on dancing and William branham's dancing so so you can go I don't I can't say I endorse everything on it I don't know I I didn't hear it all but I'm not afraid of you listening to it watching it if it'll encourage you to get out of your box if it'll remind you that God wants us to expand our border sometime [Music] go put my scripture back up we got to go home now for I will cast out the Nations before you and enlarge your borders so devil just keep now I'm not talking Brothers I'm not calling you devils but I want to say the devil just keep your nails in string just keep your 10 acres cause before God's through you may end up having to give it to somebody you never know what God will do and if he don't you know what he'll do he'll drop the money here he'll drop the money here to purchase it because I believe we're supposed to be 70 acres and I believe he'll make a way for us to be in his time but what this taught me was was bigger than I could even expound on I can't even teach you because I don't fully understand it to be able to teach you but the smallest action for I will cast out the Nations before you and in larger borders neither shall any man this is so powerful I can't even preach on this I don't have time but this is so powerful neither shall any man desire and molest your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year do you know what God is saying to the Israelite I want all you men to go three times a year and don't worry about your stuff cause I the Lord God will watch over your home and your family and your animals and your crops you just obey me that's what he's saying can you imagine God saying you go and I'll stay with the stuff and yet I'll meet you there the God we serve he can be with the staff and in the convocation when I first met sister Nancy in Jerusalem she began to tell me stories about how how the young people who went from Calvary Pentecostal Tabernacle in Richmond Virginia over 50 years ago who went there to Israel to start in Jerusalem a prayer meeting and she said God kept speaking to them in the gifts and saying to them don't worry about home don't worry about the things you've left behind if your own assignment in Jerusalem I will take care if you're obeying me don't even worry and the Lord also spoke among them and said don't criticize the land don't criticize even things that are easy to criticize don't criticize the parking tickets just expect them they've got a big army to pay for they help they help they help Finance the army with parking tickets so we wouldn't let any of the brothers complain just pay them even when I even when I was meeting the mayor of Jerusalem at the mayor's reception in a in a stark brand new white shirt and I'm walking toward the reception and it starts raining and the hamsa has been blowing in from the from the desert and the air is red just like our dirt here the air was red because of that wind that blew off the desert and when it started raining I looked down at my shirt and I looked like some kind of red Dalmatian or something I had red spots and dots all over my clothes and here I'm going to meet the mayor and I thought I'm going to use this as an opportunity to tell him how glad I am to be here red dots and all he got the biggest he got the biggest laugh out of that he said oh a man after my heart somebody who loves Jerusalem like I do he said I've learned I've learned and evidently you've learned to give God thanks to give Hashem thanks in all things and just be glad you get to be here for however amount of time you get to be here and sometimes the complaining really blocks the blessing now let me read you something here that brother Branham said now I've got a I've got to wind down I'm on page four of 27. paragraph 453. So old man and old woman so oh man you have to you have to look at the context to know whether it means man or men so old man an old woman don't you be discouraged even in my office when somebody says this morning don't you just love old people and Ben says of course he does he is one talked about me see David's anointing was getting over on Ben being used to it and never talk to me that way so old man and old woman don't you be discouraged if you are a representation up here in this attribute of God he's preaching future home my good friend brother Gerald Cleveland is sitting in the audience this night if you have it if you're represented here you cannot he's drawn out he's drawn out the city he's drawn out the pyramid he's placing those attributes on the pyramid he said go back I'm sorry charity if you're represented here you cannot you're in the eternal now what did he just say don't be discouraged old man old woman if you're represented here in God's Eternal City you're not old Ben I'm not old I am eternal [Music] and listen what he said and if you've crossed from that seventh day into the eighth you got into the Eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit the one that precedes the Capstone the one that's bigger than a Feeling the one that seals you in it's not a sensation it's a ceiling that we're looking for he said you got into the Eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're included in this now if you're just trusting upon a sensation or jumping up and down or I do this I keep my seventh day I don't eat meat and things like that that's going to perish anyhow see now I could add some things to that if you're just trusting in your belt buckle [Music] or because you're clean shaven you know a lot of extra things has been added to the message if you're trusting in any of that that's going to perish but this is the Eternal sea this is the the Eternal he said the feast after the feast of Tabernacles now there's only seven Feasts there's only seven feasts mentioned in the Bible brother Branham is preaching what the scripture preached he's preaching that the Feast of Tabernacles goes all the way through to the Millennium because it's eternal he's putting us in the eighth day but there's not an eighth Feast unless we called it the Millennium and we can do that we can do that as partakers of Grace we can look back and certainly say but I showed you the list of the feasts that are mentioned in the Bible and they're seven but he said this is eternal the feast after the Feast of Tabernacles it goes on and watch what he said the Feast of Tabernacles was the last Feast the seventh feast it in context great isn't it great to read more than one paragraph because look according how he qualifies and explains what he's meaning he said we are worshiping now under the Feast of the Tabernacles the seventh Church age in the millennium will be not an eight feast will be under the Feast of Tabernacles again in the seventh day which would be the eighth but then after the seventh day we have a holy convocation Eighth Day and go back into the eternal how read that line by the Eternal one that came and redeemed us and taken us back letting us recognize what that we are a part of this now how do you know you're apart because that the word of the hour the promise of the day what is it a restoration back to the first day it's the same thing he said about the gospel going back to the Jews he said it started in Jerusalem and it moved West it came through Jeffersonville it came through Tucson the move of God Azusa Street preceded that and then what does it do it doesn't hit California and turn around and go back to Jerusalem that way because brother random knew the Earth was round he said it keeps going you don't drop off the edge out there like some people would have you to think it just circles right back around and guess what it is he said Korea I don't know why he singles out Korea but he talks about Asia but he calls Korea by name he caused Japan by name isn't it powerful to know that God doesn't forget about Asia if it only went from Jerusalem to California back to Jerusalem you miss some folks so he said it goes all the way back around and it comes through Asia where God is moving I want you to know God's moving he's moving right now in China in unprecedented ways the message is growing even by Leaps and Bounds in underground China because God's getting a people ready to sustain the last move and then word of the Gospel go brother Bantam said right back to the Jews he said and they brought it to us and what do we do somehow we take it back to them what it's going to look like I don't exactly know but I'm standing on that promise I'm standing on that promise and I'm standing on every one of these every one of them now in the few minutes that I have left the Hebrew word for Tabernacle is sukkah say it we call the fee sakot it means a booth a HUD a covering the brothers didn't get ours up but I wish they would try to work that in because now the people are expecting it you restored it last year and now the people are expecting it up this year and we don't have it up here so maybe you'll consider doing that so the booth or a hint hint hint hint if you'll do it brother Daniel will feed you smoked chicken tonight yes 50 pounds you come come if you'll do that stand there and you watch to see if it makes it back if it don't then don't let any young male have any until they have gone and kept the feast and brought the brought the I'm just kidding David you can smile David feels led to lead the group with Josiah follow those men Hallelujah so the booth of the Suka was a temporary Dwelling Place historically it was to remind the people of their Exodus from Egypt every time you see that Booth sitting there not this morning because it's not sitting there but every time you look up and see it sitting there you ought to remember that you're a part of an exodus amen just like the children of Israel had their Exodus the bride in this day is having their Exodus somebody said it's finished oh no it's ongoing as long as somebody's coming out of a denominational system I say this is The Exodus [Applause] as long as somebody's coming out of man religion [Applause] I say when people are busting out of their own religion we're still in The Exodus and there's one more which we didn't just come out of Egypt to live out here in the wilderness we're crossing again we've got another River to take and then the Promised Land prophetically the Suka points toward the future of the Messiah of the Messiah age the millennium spiritually Asuka is supposed to remind us that we are but strangers and pilgrims on the earth this being a temporary Dwelling Place how many of you are thankful for that I see this sad little brother posting all the time on on Facebook who believes that the Rapture has already taken place and we're living in the millennium I feel so sorry for him he posts the quotes he's got it all figured out I feel so sorry for him can you imagine having to take this old body this old body can you imagine having to take this into a Thousand-Year reign well I don't feel very Victorious when I get up in the morning I have to pray to get Victorious can you imagine having to live a thousand years in an old body like the one you've got right now you can there's some things you just can't spiritualize to the point that you're out of reality we hadn't made it yet but I'm gonna make it hallelujah how many of you are going to make it with me I want the musicians to come Lord I want to preach this but I can't one of the one of the one of the names of the Feast of Tabernacles is the Feast of of unity and I was prepared to spend most of my time there but I didn't get there the Feast of unity it's the Feast of Oneness oh Hallelujah can I just read a few more verses and while they're getting ready John 17 11 and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are the Feast of Tabernacles is a good time to celebrate our unity and Oneness with him verse 21-23 neither pray I for these alone sorry that must be I must have not put the whole verse do you have verse 22 okay let's read let's go back and read 21 that doesn't seem right at the moment what verse that starts off neither pray after these alone I'm doing this more often you all pray for me what verse starts off neither pray after these alone but for them verse 20. verse 20 says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as you father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which you have given me I have given them does anybody believe you're one of them that they may be one even as we are one i in them you and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that you have sent me and has loved them as you has loved me the unity for which Jesus prayed and which the father so deeply desires is going to be fulfilled Our God will create it and it will be demonstrated through this remnant bride it is a Unity both inexpressible and exquisite Jesus said even as we are one and as surely as the father Tabernacles in the sun thinking through him speaking through him walking in him working with him so shall he dwell in the sons of God the Bride of Jesus Christ and remember First Corinthians 6 17 the last verse in the Amplified but the person this is the Amplified classic but the person who is United to the Lord the person who is United to the Lord are there any people like that here hello becomes to be joined to the Lord to have his holy spirit regenerating your Fallen human Spirit it joins you with the Lord and it's not two Spirits anymore his spirit and your spirit it's one spirit living inside of you this is one of the themes of Tabernacles this holy moed this holy convocation let's stand may God meet with us this week and every time we meet together in his name may he remind us of his desire to be one with us and may we prepare ourselves as sister Kathy sung this morning may we prepare ourselves to stand in the threshing floor and have everything that is not like him knocked off cut off sheared off May the dross fall in the threshing floor May the wind come and blow away the dross so that only the seed of God remain in US how many of you this is your desire cleanse us Lord make us your sanctuaries make us one with you Lord even as your word has said may we look at the Feast of Tabernacles a little differently than we have before may we see the present reality of it may we also be filled with anticipation for the fullness of it one day to live with you for a thousand years and that's only the beginning for after the honeymoon we have an eternity with you ruling and reigning with our Messiah with our bridegroom we're the lover of our soul we bless your name we worship you today Father minister to lives in these last few minutes of service today minister to lives draw us draw us into the sacredness of this moment let us see our value that's found in you that you would desire to meet with us behind the veil Lord that that tent that sukkah it reminds us of the Hupa it reminds us of the tallit that our brother back there is wearing it represents heaven is our young couples have married under it it reminds us of that tent the one that so many have been looking for a natural fulfillment of but you can't always expect to interpret something in the spirit with natural terms because sometimes spiritual visions are just that they have spiritual fulfillments to be one with you to spend the night in the Hoopa with the bridegroom drawing up the curtains around us shutting out the world shutting out the Temptations and distractions of the world around us forgetting our griefs forgetting our problems for getting our heart aches and becoming one with you in spirit that little bride coming out of the other side of that tent with thus saith the Lord in her mouth speaking to the weather speaking creating with her mouth speaking tumors be gone speaking salvation to those who are caught up in their silliness oh I thank

come from various places this week and we want to minister life to them we want to show them the love of a true Christian we want to be ready oh God and willing to be used in whatever capacity that you would desire to use us and Lord I can't speak for everyone but I'm willing I'm willing to choose inconvenience if inconvenience is what it takes for you to come and have your way Among Us Lord I'm even willing to bake another casserole whatever you would have I'm willing to miss some sleep that we all need Lord we're willing to pay these little feeble prices because there's nothing more important than being right in the middle of the move of a sovereign God when it comes to break Fetters and yolks we have families that are out of the Ark of Safety we believe your spirit is drawing in this hour we want to be both Salt and Light Jesus Jesus we want to say what the spirit is saying if the spirit says Bo Hebrew for come if the spirit says come Lord we want to come and we want to say come the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride say come oh Jesus breathe on us just gently put your hand on someone near you right now and ask God to meet them this week and and throughout their life Lord meet my brother meet my brother meet my sister we're coming we're coming we're coming to the holy convocation it's not just a week of camp meetings it's a it's a place in your sides we're coming to a place in your side we're coming to fulfill your prayer that we would be one with you even as you are one with the father Lord I'm looking at some of the fulfillments of that prayer I'm looking at some of those who will answer that prayer in the last days strengthen them strengthen them pour your holy oil over them right now oh I feel something moving now pour your

breathe on us [Music] oh thank you Jesus slip back to your seats thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus praise His holy name oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you can be seated if you need to but I was just going to let you stand we really are going we really are leaving but I have I have a great announcement to make a very beautiful announcement a precious announcement the church is growing again isn't that wonderful brother Austin and sister Anna Christine want to announce to you all that they are go and Gwen that they are going to have a baby [Applause] praise the Lord in that wonderful it's so wonderful I was so happy when they told me here we've been just holding on to it until the right time we're just so thrilled for them and so thankful for them these things usually come in threes or fours so we're on the search to see who three will be or or four we'll we'll take four we know that uh the Allah knows I know I know I know sometimes you all look at sister hope and wonder how she can handle a third one but you just watch she may not always feel like it but she was born for the job sister Anna Christine you were born for the job I believe that I believe that I believe that I believe there are a few more seed that's got to get here I have a strange Doctrine I thought of it this morning I just don't believe that that uh that God gives uncertified seed to his seed I believe like the prophet said we have every right to claim our children they may not know what you know they may not care about what you care about but it's God who determines it's God who determines what little Spirit goes into what little body he's the one that makes that choice and I just have a feeling that he's given certified seed to certified seed Hallelujah let's stand together and what a joy to be in his presence remember those who are traveling brother Magnuson and brother Ziggy oh how much fun and how wonderful it'll be to have brother Ziggy it's been a few years brother Magnuson belongs here this is his this is his fall home he's been so faithful to come through the years to Iceland one of our sisters in Iceland was at the very last minute she felt the desire she was still feeling the desire to be here so she got everything in order and was once checked to see if we might find her a place and I said I believe we can find her
