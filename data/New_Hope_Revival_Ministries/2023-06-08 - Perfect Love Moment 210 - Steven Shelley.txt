Description:
I truly believe it’s going to take perfect love to make the rapture; to truly have compassion and forgiveness from the heart towards one another.  It’s praying for and loving those who spitefully use you, loving the unlovable without prejudice.  Not that phony kind of love, but truly loving one another.
“Lord, let me become love.”  Let me love like Jesus loves.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign just remember perfect love well we know what perfect love somebody said what is it it's Jesus it's father forgive them [Music] for they know not what they do it's love without prejudice it's loving someone who is unlovable it's loving someone who plucks out your beard [Music] it's loving somebody who despitefully uses you and it's not that old phony love I love you anyway anybody ever had you that I love you all right but I'd sure like to fix you that's not love that's religion I've asked the Lord I want to love people like you love them and he's tested me a few times you heard me tell about going through some of my stuff and finding a gift that someone had given me that had later tried to destroy my life and I picked that gift up and I walked over to the trash can and I tossed it in and I thanked God to be rid of those people in my life thank God I don't have to deal with him anymore and he got me he said now you will go back and you'll take that out of the trash can [Music] and I went over there and I picked it up out of the dress can and if I would have dropped something I cared about it would have smashed to a thousand pieces but this thing was perfectly intact even though I had a little righteous indignation when I threw it away it was just perfect and I said Lord what must I do with this I don't even like it [Music] and all of a sudden it was like a movie on in my head I remembered how much I liked it when it was given to me now why didn't I like it now because I was prejudiced prejudiced anybody hear me I said what must I do with it I'm sure I can find a box for it after all it came out of a box I'm sure I can find a box for it and the Lord said um [Music] you will place it in a predominant spot on your desk [Music] and you will look at it every day until you can pray for them I would pray for them wasn't easy there were times I would look at it and I'd go right down on my knees with a burden for those people there were times I looked at it and I thought hmm I have church people who love me that need my prayers those people would never think of me praying for them why should I pray for them they'll never even think of me praying for why should I waste my time praying for them and the Lord to take you right it was like you started over okay you must really like looking at it I remember the day I remember what I had on I remember what I had for lunch the day I walked into my office and I saw that there and my compassion and my love for them was beyond me [Music] I fell down on my knees and I prayed and when I got through praying the Lord said now I had you to pray for them because nobody else [Music] I know this I know what it means to struggle with prejudice you see my problem is not racial [Music] that's not the kind of prejudice I'm talking about I'm talking about remembering or wrong [Music] till we can kind of birth explosion perfect love filling us we can pray for one another without prejudice look folks uh uh get him Lord is not a qualified prayer God is the one who decides how to draw it's up to you and I to let him fill our hearts with that perfect love I truly believe as brother Branham has told us it's going to take that perfect love to make the rapture
