[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope award
[0:51] [Music]
[1:01] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelly I want
[1:04] to welcome you to the program today
[1:06] again it is a wonderful joy to be able
[1:09] to speak to you the wonderful glorious
[1:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:16] truth of the gospel and we're just
[1:18] thankful for this opportunity
[1:20] we appreciate the gospel Channel I know
[1:23] many of you watching this program really
[1:25] appreciate the quality Christian
[1:28] programming that's available to you 24
[1:31] hours a day on the gospel Channel and I
[1:35] appreciate those brothers and sisters
[1:37] very very much and I consider it a real
[1:40] honor to partner with them in getting
[1:43] these programs to you we have had a
[1:46] beautiful response to this series that
[1:50] we've been working on now today we'll be
[1:53] number five in a series that we call
[1:56] schemes and devices and the response has
[2:00] been really exciting to us so many of
[2:04] you have called with your prayer
[2:06] requests and with your precious comments
[2:10] and I want to thank you from the bottom
[2:12] of my heart I want to thank you that
[2:15] some of you have chosen to sow into the
[2:18] ministry and we appreciate that very
[2:20] much
[2:21] many of you have partnered with the
[2:23] gospel channel because we've encouraged
[2:26] you to do so and we want to thank you
[2:28] for that as well I'd like to say I
[2:30] appreciate your confidence in us that
[2:33] you would sometimes bare you know your
[2:37] heart to us on the machine sometimes if
[2:41] it's during our regular hours you may
[2:44] have a live brother or sister to pray
[2:46] with you otherwise you're leaving your
[2:49] prayer requests on our machine and we're
[2:51] taking that to the Lord
[2:53] in fact as I'm taping this program right
[2:56] now there are saints of God in one of
[2:59] the prayer chapels here on our property
[3:01] praying for you praying for me that we
[3:05] could
[3:06] be used of the Lord today and that God
[3:08] would minister to your needs so I want
[3:11] to say again we take your prayer
[3:13] requests most seriously and we have
[3:16] learned through the years the great
[3:18] power in prayer time would not permit me
[3:22] today and in fact I would have to make a
[3:25] list to to even begin to tell you the
[3:29] joys of answered prayer in my own life
[3:32] through the years what we have seen the
[3:35] Lord do many of you have called and
[3:38] written emailed to say that you're in a
[3:42] spiritual battle and that you need
[3:45] prayer support to get through that
[3:47] battle and I believe that's one of the
[3:50] reasons why the Lord directed us to
[3:52] bring you this series because as a
[3:55] roaring lion the enemy is certainly
[3:58] roaming to and fro seeking whom he may
[4:01] devour
[4:02] but the theme of these programs is found
[4:07] in 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[4:10] lest Satan should get an advantage of us
[4:15] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[4:21] we're learning together in this study
[4:24] some of the ways that the enemy is
[4:27] attacking the believer in this hour and
[4:31] we're learning strategies to overcome
[4:34] every scheme and every device that the
[4:38] enemy would throw against the child of
[4:41] God in this hour and let me remind you
[4:44] with encouragement we win by the grace
[4:48] of God there is no battle too severe for
[4:52] Jesus who is the victor and he gives us
[4:57] the victory we become his victory in the
[5:02] battles of life I'd like for us to go
[5:05] back today to where we left off in
[5:08] program four and let me remind you that
[5:12] if for some reason you've missed
[5:15] the programs we have a YouTube channel
[5:17] and I'm sure they'll give you the
[5:20] information of how to get there on the
[5:23] screen at some point during the program
[5:25] but I assume you could look up new hope
[5:28] revival ministries in the search field
[5:31] of YouTube find our Channel and let me
[5:35] invite you to subscribe if you'd like to
[5:38] do something that would be an
[5:40] encouragement to our staff would you
[5:43] subscribe to our youtube channel it
[5:46] blesses us to know and then you get a
[5:49] notification when we add new content to
[5:52] the channel if you've missed parts one
[5:56] through four in the series schemes and
[5:59] devices they're all available to you
[6:02] free of charge on YouTube and I
[6:05] encourage you to go back and listen to
[6:08] those again and again I had a note from
[6:11] someone today who said to me this was
[6:15] not through television but a saint of
[6:18] God in the Philippines wrote today and
[6:22] said your YouTube channel is being used
[6:26] of God to minister to me in a very
[6:29] personal way I don't know what the needs
[6:32] are in that family but the Lord knows
[6:35] and it's exciting for us to think that a
[6:39] YouTube channel with these programs and
[6:42] other good content would be able to
[6:45] reach much farther than even the gospel
[6:48] channel even the world wide web is such
[6:53] a wonderful way now to take the gospel
[6:55] to the ends of the earth and I was just
[6:58] delighted about that let's go to the
[7:01] scripture that we closed we had the last
[7:03] time we were together in 2nd Corinthians
[7:06] chapter 10 verses 3 through 6 and I've
[7:11] read them for you already in the King
[7:14] James Version and to conserve time
[7:17] because I have a lot I want to share
[7:19] with you today let's just do them again
[7:22] in the amplified instead of both but I
[7:25] encourage you to always
[7:28] look at the scripture in the King James
[7:30] version of the Bible I think it's a
[7:33] wonderful source of God's Word and then
[7:37] you may find other translations that
[7:41] will bless you and we use the amplified
[7:44] sometimes because we believe it
[7:45] amplifies the scripture and there might
[7:49] be a few places in there that that I
[7:52] would say maybe it didn't line up quite
[7:54] as properly as I would like for it to
[7:57] but I think you'll be blessed by this
[7:59] particular portion of scripture today
[8:02] 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 verses 3
[8:06] through 6 and the amplified for though
[8:08] we walk live in the flesh we are not
[8:13] carrying on our warfare according to the
[8:18] flesh and using mere human weapons
[8:22] remember we talked about the fact that
[8:25] we have been given spiritual weapons to
[8:28] fight a spiritual war that manifests in
[8:33] the natural realm we've got to be able
[8:36] to discern and remember that the battle
[8:40] is it seems to be raging in the natural
[8:44] realm the circumstances of the battle
[8:47] are manifesting in the natural realm but
[8:50] the victory for the battle is never
[8:53] achieved in the natural realm it's
[8:57] always achieved in the spiritual realm
[9:01] using spiritual weapons the Word of God
[9:05] the authority of the blood of Jesus
[9:08] Christ and the authority of his precious
[9:11] name the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[9:15] Messiah what greater weapons could we
[9:20] have the blood the name the word this is
[9:25] powerful weapons to use against the
[9:28] enemy alright in verse 4 the weapons of
[9:32] our warfare are not physical weapons of
[9:36] flesh and blood but they are mighty
[9:38] before God for the
[9:41] overthrow and destruction of strongholds
[9:46] we were talking about strongholds we
[9:50] were talking about death structures and
[9:54] how that certain thoughts and certain
[9:57] lies of the enemy began to form a
[10:01] framework around our lives that become
[10:05] strongholds that the enemy will use
[10:09] against us over and over and over again
[10:12] so we've got to learn the spiritual
[10:16] weapons that are at our disposal for not
[10:20] only overthrowing those spiritual
[10:23] strongholds but to destroy them so that
[10:28] they can never be used against us again
[10:31] remember we talked about recently that
[10:34] the anointing the power of the anointing
[10:37] the authority in the anointing of the
[10:41] Holy Spirit it's not just to break yokes
[10:44] indeed it does that but it also destroys
[10:49] the yokes of the enemy so we're going to
[10:53] believe that as we learn and discover
[10:56] how the enemy operates and what we've
[10:59] been given to counteract the attack of
[11:03] the enemy that we will learn not only to
[11:06] break down tear down rip down these
[11:09] strongholds but continue in prayer
[11:13] continue applying the weapons that God
[11:16] has given us in the spirit until we see
[11:19] the utter and ultimate destruction of
[11:23] these strongholds that the enemy has
[11:26] raised up over our lives verse five in
[11:29] as much as we refute arguments and
[11:33] theories and reasonings and every proud
[11:38] and lofty thing that sets itself up
[11:42] against the true knowledge of God I
[11:47] don't know if that portion of Scripture
[11:50] resonates with you like it resonates
[11:53] with me but it
[11:55] speaks to me I feel life in these words
[11:59] we are chosen and called of God and
[12:03] given authority and power to refute to
[12:07] refuse the arguments the theories the
[12:11] reasonings the proud and lofty thoughts
[12:14] and things that the enemy uses to seduce
[12:19] us to beguile us into believing a lie
[12:23] instead of the truth the time has come
[12:27] saints of God to refuse to agree with
[12:32] the devil's lies about your life and
[12:34] destiny and the time has come to bring
[12:38] yourself into alignment and into
[12:41] position with with the authority that
[12:44] God gives us through his word to
[12:47] ultimately defeat every one of these
[12:50] proud lofty things these reasonings
[12:53] these theories these arguments I want to
[12:57] see every one of them ripped down and
[12:59] destroyed in my life and in your life
[13:03] for the glory of God we're not just here
[13:07] fighting as someone who is beating the
[13:09] air and we don't know what we're
[13:11] fighting against oh no we're uncovering
[13:13] the enemy today we're taking the cover
[13:17] off and we're going to see him for who
[13:20] he really is
[13:21] the great impostor the great deceiver
[13:24] the original kleptomaniac who comes as a
[13:28] thief to steal to kill and to destroy to
[13:31] tear down to uproot but Jesus is the
[13:35] remedy and he said I have come that you
[13:39] might have life and that you might have
[13:41] it more abundantly I'm telling you
[13:43] there's victory and there is an abundant
[13:46] life to the believer but it doesn't fall
[13:49] upon us like ripe cherries from a tree
[13:53] there is an activation of faith that is
[13:57] required faith must become a revelation
[14:00] in your life and you must use that
[14:04] revealed faith that faith that has been
[14:07] super-nice
[14:08] truly revealed to you by the Spirit of
[14:10] God you must actively use that against
[14:14] the same old worn-out tactics of your
[14:17] enemy
[14:18] it just it never really ceases to amaze
[14:21] me how the enemy will take the same old
[14:24] thing and use it over and over again how
[14:27] does he get by how does the enemy get by
[14:30] using the same old worn-out trick in
[14:33] your life I'll tell you how he has built
[14:36] a structure he has built a foundational
[14:39] structure around us which we define in
[14:43] this study as a stronghold one lie upon
[14:48] another lie
[14:49] upon another lie upon another lie until
[14:52] it becomes a woven I want to say inner
[14:56] woven in the fiber of how you think
[14:58] about yourself he starts telling you you
[15:01] you're a failure and you're born in the
[15:03] wrong family and you're never been
[15:05] anything but a shame and and a disgrace
[15:08] and you'll never be and then on and on
[15:10] and on and on it goes I've been able to
[15:13] sometimes recognize these strongholds in
[15:16] my life and how they operate by how my
[15:19] thoughts direct a thought will come of
[15:22] defeat or a failure of not accomplishing
[15:27] enough for the kingdom of God let me
[15:29] tell you something God will never bring
[15:32] that spirit of condemnation on you for
[15:34] not doing enough for the kingdom of God
[15:36] he'll bring conviction which strengthens
[15:39] you in hope to keep pushing forward to
[15:42] do more for the kingdom of God but he
[15:45] never brings that guilt and shame
[15:46] because you haven't done enough or
[15:49] because you weren't able to to achieve
[15:52] and succeed in everything that you set
[15:54] forth to do but I've been able to
[15:57] recognize and I can almost predict in
[16:01] fact I have what the next thought and
[16:04] the next thought and the next thought
[16:06] will be until I find myself on this
[16:09] little trail of thoughts and what
[16:12] they're really doing is one leading to
[16:14] another to another to another to become
[16:16] a stronghold in
[16:18] life that leads to depression that leads
[16:22] to ultimate defeat and that defeat that
[16:25] depression that nervousness then will
[16:28] paralyze us from using the weapons that
[16:32] we have been given India Bluff isn't the
[16:36] devil a bluff when you really hear how
[16:39] he operates and how unfairly he operates
[16:42] against the believer he really only
[16:46] utilizes the power that we allow him to
[16:49] have in our lives and we just fall like
[16:53] innocent victims into these traps where
[16:57] one thought I like to say piggy backs on
[17:00] another thought and that thought piggy
[17:02] backs on another thought until you have
[17:04] spent an hour in total defeat
[17:08] accomplishing nothing but but sort of
[17:10] licking your wounds and singing woe is
[17:14] me and living a life of defeat that
[17:16] Jesus he never intended for you and I as
[17:21] children of God as true believers to
[17:24] live in defeat even when we make
[17:27] mistakes even when we do fail even when
[17:30] we do fall short and we don't succeed at
[17:33] what we set out to do he wants to bring
[17:37] conviction that causes us to press in a
[17:40] little harder but remember when it's the
[17:42] Spirit of God there's always a measure
[17:45] of Hope involved of how we can correct
[17:49] our path and what we will see happen if
[17:52] we choose to be obedient rather than to
[17:55] disobey and break covenant so let's
[17:58] finish this verse of scripture where
[18:00] we're refuting arguments
[18:03] we're refuting theories and reasonings
[18:06] we're pulling down proud and lofty
[18:09] things that set themselves up against
[18:12] the true knowledge of God not just a
[18:16] head knowledge of who God is but an
[18:19] intimate knowing to know God to lean on
[18:24] God to draw your strength from God I
[18:28] want you to know that there is a source
[18:31] of strength that is more effective than
[18:34] your vitamins or as you might say in the
[18:37] UK vitamins there is a source of
[18:41] strength that is more powerful more
[18:43] sustaining more productive than even
[18:47] eating your leafy green vegetables we're
[18:50] talking about a source of strength found
[18:54] in intimate knowing of Jesus Christ
[18:58] leaning on him knowing that on my best
[19:03] day giving forth my best efforts I do
[19:07] fall short I would be a failure every
[19:10] time but because I'm drawing strength
[19:13] from him for my destiny for his destiny
[19:18] purposes in me to be fulfilled because
[19:21] I've learned he is my source I don't
[19:24] always remember it I have to remind
[19:27] myself sometimes I've made it way down
[19:30] the bunny trail of thoughts those
[19:32] piggyback thoughts that build
[19:34] strongholds sometimes I've made it way
[19:37] down five or six connected thoughts
[19:39] before I'm able to quickly discern and
[19:42] recognize hey wait a minute
[19:44] I don't have to sit here and think like
[19:47] this listen to this other voice that is
[19:51] not the voice of my beloved it's not the
[19:54] voice of the one who loves me so much
[19:57] that he not only gave his own life and
[20:00] shed his own blood to redeem me but he
[20:03] constantly lives he lives for the
[20:07] purpose of sustaining me and
[20:10] strengthening me and interceding on my
[20:13] behalf all what a great High Priest
[20:17] we have in the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua
[20:21] our Messiah so if the thought is not in
[20:26] in alignment if it's if it doesn't fit
[20:29] with the truth of God's Word we must
[20:33] reject it and dig it up and cast it out
[20:38] even by the roots
[20:40] being verse six being in readiness to
[20:44] punish every insubordinate for his
[20:47] disobedience when you your own
[20:50] submission and obedience as a church are
[20:53] fully secured and complete that
[20:57] basically says we've got a lot of things
[21:01] we need to take care of in our own
[21:03] individual lives before we're ready to
[21:06] execute a lot of judgment on someone
[21:08] else this is just sound teaching that
[21:12] the Apostle Paul is giving to the church
[21:15] at Corinth so much like the advice and
[21:19] the commandment of our Lord Jesus Christ
[21:22] when he tells us how how to judge what
[21:27] is the right way to make a judgment and
[21:29] what is the incorrect way and when he
[21:33] tells us that we should not be concerned
[21:36] about the smallest particle in our in
[21:40] our neighbors eye when we have some
[21:43] other large bisetta ng sin or work of
[21:47] doubt and disobedience in our own life I
[21:51] like to compare those to the the
[21:55] toothpick and the telephone pole you
[21:58] know it's like trying to deal with the
[21:59] toothpick in your eye when I have a
[22:02] telephone pole in my own eye it's not a
[22:06] good idea the scriptures are clear but
[22:09] Satan would rather you spend all of your
[22:12] time focusing on judging someone else
[22:15] finding the hypocrisy in someone else's
[22:19] life because he knows if he can cause us
[22:21] to focus on where others are not
[22:24] measuring up we want discover God's
[22:28] perfect plan for how we need to step up
[22:31] to the Commission that he has given us
[22:33] in this hour again he desires to deceive
[22:37] and to seduce and to pull the wool over
[22:40] our eyes but we're exposing him today
[22:43] and if you let the Spirit of the Lord
[22:47] quicken this and make this real to you
[22:49] you'll be able to have to catch him when
[22:52] he approaches you the
[22:53] time we must always remember that the
[22:56] Apostle Paul instructed us not to fight
[22:59] with our carnal understandings or
[23:03] reasonings but to totally rely on God's
[23:06] Spirit as we battle against spiritual
[23:09] forces we have the Holy Spirit of God to
[23:14] help us fight the good fight of faith
[23:18] from and in the realm of the Spirit I
[23:22] want to give you today a three fold
[23:26] strategy I'm not the best when it comes
[23:29] to to giving a list of things or bullet
[23:33] points or step one step two step three
[23:35] and frankly I know a lot of people are
[23:37] burned out with the whole idea of step
[23:40] one step two step three but if this
[23:44] strategy is found in the scripture then
[23:48] it's inspired of God and it has to work
[23:52] you say all brother Shelly it may work
[23:55] in your life but I know it won't work in
[23:57] my life well that's not how you need to
[23:59] approach God's Word any way any strategy
[24:03] revealed to us in God's Word has to work
[24:06] in your life if you approach it with the
[24:09] right attitude in faith and hope and in
[24:12] surrender it has to work God is not a
[24:15] man that he should lie neither the son
[24:18] of man that he would have need to repent
[24:20] if God said it that settles it and it
[24:25] can work and it will work and it must
[24:27] work in our lives the three fold
[24:31] strategy to pull down strongholds and to
[24:35] raise up in a in a new place in Christ
[24:38] in this hour he's found in verse 5 of
[24:42] 2nd Corinthians 10 that we were just
[24:46] reading King James says casting down
[24:49] imaginations and every high thing that
[24:52] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[24:55] God and bringing into captivity every
[24:58] thought to the obedience of Christ
[25:03] that's the threefold strategy for
[25:06] dealing
[25:06] with the strongholds of the enemy we are
[25:10] number one we're encouraged by the
[25:12] scripture let me give you it again 2nd
[25:14] Corinthians 10 and verse 5 we are
[25:18] encouraged in the scripture to number
[25:21] one cast down imaginations and every
[25:27] high thing that exalts itself against
[25:31] the true knowledge of God that is not an
[25:34] automatic thing it's something that
[25:37] requires focus it requires that we do
[25:41] something with in a conscious way we
[25:45] have to be able to recognize when the
[25:48] enemy is flooding our mind with
[25:52] imaginations that are not according to
[25:57] God's Word when the enemy will give us
[26:00] these long made-up scenarios scenarios
[26:06] that that what if what if what if what
[26:10] if what if what if and we can get so
[26:13] bogged down in the what-ifs that it
[26:17] makes you know the normal process of
[26:20] grief can be greatly greatly magnified
[26:24] if you get caught up in that cycle of
[26:28] what-ifs God doesn't want us living in
[26:32] the what-ifs or the maybe souls and and
[26:36] and it could have been and should have
[26:38] been and would have been he wants us
[26:41] walking with Him daily led by the Holy
[26:45] Spirit
[26:46] knowing that every weapon we need to win
[26:51] is given to us and Jesus desires to make
[26:57] us his victory what could be more
[27:01] powerful than that so number one in the
[27:04] three fold strategy cast down
[27:07] imaginations recognize when your
[27:10] thoughts are running wild and are no
[27:13] longer in accordance with God's truth
[27:17] concerning who you
[27:18] are and why you are here on this planet
[27:22] number two we have to bring into
[27:26] captivity every thought I want you to
[27:31] I'm gonna say this and somebody's gonna
[27:34] laugh at me but I'm gonna say it anyway
[27:37] when I was when I was a boy I I didn't
[27:41] have computers and things like that to
[27:43] play with until I was much older and so
[27:47] video games and that kind of stuff
[27:49] didn't didn't come around for quite a
[27:51] while
[27:52] one of my favorite things to play and I
[27:55] know it's politically incorrect I do I
[27:58] know it probably wasn't the best thing
[28:00] to play but but I like to play cowboys
[28:03] and Indians and and to be honest with
[28:06] you it didn't really matter to me which
[28:08] which one I was it didn't matter to me
[28:11] if I was a cowboy it didn't matter to me
[28:13] if I was an Indian I just enjoyed the
[28:15] chase
[28:16] I enjoyed the fun of course not
[28:20] discerning the depth of what I was
[28:22] playing and the and the effect that
[28:25] these kinds of things have had on
[28:27] history in our nation and of course I
[28:30] would in no way support the mistreatment
[28:33] of anybody any Native American or Indian
[28:37] or even a cowboy for that matter but in
[28:41] those days we would round up and and you
[28:45] know the truth is as a cowboy I would
[28:47] corral Indians and as an Indian I would
[28:50] Corral Cowboys it didn't matter which
[28:53] side of the game I played on in fact
[28:56] most everybody I play played with as a
[28:58] child wanted to be the Cowboys so quite
[29:00] often I would be an Indian but the truth
[29:03] is the game was to chase each other
[29:05] through the woods through the
[29:07] neighborhood and take each other captive
[29:10] and and corral them you know we would
[29:13] set aside a designated place and you
[29:16] would be so to speak a prisoner of war
[29:19] and you had to sit there until the game
[29:22] was over I want you to think something
[29:25] similar something that you can relate to
[29:28] perhaps a game that you played
[29:31] or an experience that you've had in life
[29:33] and I want you to recognize that this is
[29:36] what we have to do with our own thoughts
[29:39] I don't laugh too hard the neighbor may
[29:42] hear you but it's absolutely the truth
[29:46] we have an obligation according to 2nd
[29:50] Corinthians 10:5 to exercise the second
[29:55] phase of the threefold strategy of
[29:58] bringing down strongholds and that is to
[30:02] Corral to gather up all of our stray
[30:06] thoughts and submit them we must force
[30:13] them into submission to the very truth
[30:18] the amplified said that we should take
[30:22] them captive and bring them into the
[30:26] obedience of Christ the Messiah The
[30:29] Anointed One so what we're doing is
[30:31] we're corralling our thoughts and we're
[30:35] forcing them to submit to what God's
[30:39] Word has said a quick example that comes
[30:43] to my mind we're trying to believe God
[30:46] for healing and the symptoms get worse
[30:49] and the enemy will say see there you're
[30:53] not healed God doesn't heal today
[30:57] he hasn't healed since the days of the
[31:00] Apostles you're going to die there is no
[31:04] healing and it could go on and on and oh
[31:07] see there that spot is is looking more
[31:11] angry on your body your fever is going
[31:14] higher whatever the circumstances are he
[31:18] begins to send those lies and I'm
[31:20] telling you if you listen to two or
[31:22] three of those lies you'll start
[31:23] agreeing with them you know you go to
[31:26] the mirror and you'll say oh yes I look
[31:28] like death warmed over I guess I guess
[31:31] it's right I guess my symptoms are
[31:33] getting worse but I've so believed for
[31:36] my healing and now I I'm just so
[31:39] defeated I just don't even know if God
[31:41] loves me I don't even know if he still
[31:43] heals
[31:44] today maybe that's an extreme example
[31:48] but you take those thoughts for instance
[31:52] one God doesn't heal today take that you
[31:56] take that thought captive and pull it
[31:59] down and force that thought to be
[32:04] submitted to what God's Word says about
[32:08] sickness
[32:09] you know just stick it under here so to
[32:12] speak and force that thought to listen
[32:17] to what the truth is the truth says he
[32:21] was wounded for our transgressions he
[32:25] was bruised for our iniquities the
[32:27] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[32:30] and with His stripes we are healed we
[32:34] were healed it is a finished work show
[32:38] the devil show that thought take that
[32:41] thought captive and read the scripture
[32:44] Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same
[32:49] yesterday and today and forever take
[32:52] that thought over here to the Gospels
[32:54] and read about them healing deliverance
[32:57] ministry of Jesus Christ and then flip
[33:00] back over there to Hebrews and say you
[33:02] see here you dirty thought you live from
[33:07] my enemy if he ever healed the sick he's
[33:12] still a healer if he ever delivered the
[33:15] oppressed he is still a deliverer what
[33:19] you're doing is you're taking it didn't
[33:21] say only negative thoughts it actually
[33:24] said every thought every thought somehow
[33:28] someone said I remember teaching this in
[33:30] our church and and someone saying you
[33:32] mean thirty thousand thoughts a day have
[33:36] to each one be no but if we could it
[33:40] would be a good idea but remember how
[33:43] thoughts piggyback on one another so you
[33:45] can usually take out several hundred
[33:47] thoughts that at once by taking the main
[33:50] thought and submitting that to the Word
[33:53] of God and you'll find out that it
[33:56] does not fit and when you find out that
[33:59] that thought after you've taken a
[34:01] captive and wouldn't let it run wild in
[34:03] your head you've forced it to the
[34:06] obedience of God's Word
[34:07] you are gonna submit you-you-you thought
[34:11] you are gonna submit this this could
[34:14] perhaps be alive the devil in my mind
[34:17] and I'm going to force you to submit to
[34:19] the truth of God's Word you see there
[34:21] comes a time in our life that we're not
[34:24] listening to the loudest voice and we're
[34:26] not believing the majority of thoughts
[34:29] we're believing the right thoughts and
[34:31] we're listening to the right voice which
[34:35] is the voice of our Shepard of whom we
[34:38] are his sheep and we know his voice and
[34:42] a stranger we refuse to follow but the
[34:45] truth is that many of us like sheep are
[34:48] led astray by our own thought process
[34:52] this is one of the major schemes and
[34:57] devices that the enemy is using against
[35:00] the believer in this hour that
[35:03] battlefield of the mind but here is the
[35:07] scriptural strategy number one again
[35:10] casting down imaginations in every high
[35:13] and lofty thing that exalts itself
[35:15] against the knowledge of God and number
[35:19] two bringing into captivity and
[35:21] submitting every thought to the
[35:24] obedience of Jesus Christ and number
[35:27] three then we must become obedient to
[35:31] God to his word to his divine leadership
[35:35] and direction
[35:37] in our life we can't continue to rebel
[35:41] against the Word of God and expect the
[35:45] truth of God's Word to work for us like
[35:49] a lucky charm like a rabbit's foot or a
[35:53] horseshoe that someone puts over the
[35:55] door most of us know these things as
[35:59] superstitions and we don't want anything
[36:02] to do with them but you'd be surprised
[36:05] how many believers
[36:07] in this hour we'll approach the Word of
[36:10] God as though it were a four-leaf clover
[36:13] as though it were a lucky charm or an
[36:16] amulet of some kind and when it didn't
[36:18] seem to work they say just as I thought
[36:22] they'd forget that there's a there's a
[36:25] strategy in in in causing in activating
[36:29] the Word of God the word of covenant it
[36:32] has to be activated in our lives as
[36:35] individuals and that is by faith through
[36:39] obedience we must obey the Word of God
[36:44] and it seems to some like such a
[36:47] daunting task but what I have found out
[36:50] and I remember mentioning this in a
[36:52] broadcast recently what I have found out
[36:55] is I choose to understand what the
[36:57] scriptures say the commandments of the
[37:00] Lord
[37:01] the instructions of the Lord are not
[37:04] Grievous to those who love him when you
[37:08] love the Lord you want to please him you
[37:11] don't always succeed at it but your
[37:13] greatest desire is to not disappoint him
[37:18] to bring him joy to obey Him to follow
[37:22] his leadership thanks be to God that
[37:25] when we misstep when we miss the mark
[37:28] when we fail thank you Lord that we have
[37:31] an advocate with the father we have a
[37:35] way of escape we have a great attorney
[37:38] standing in our defense but that doesn't
[37:42] give us an excuse to never try to obey
[37:45] again it's very very important if we are
[37:49] expecting this strategy to work of
[37:52] casting down every imagination that
[37:55] exalts itself against the true knowledge
[37:58] of God and if we expect to be able to
[38:01] find victory by bringing every thought
[38:03] into captivity and forcing that thought
[38:07] to submit to the truth of God's Word if
[38:10] it doesn't line up with the truth of
[38:12] God's Word we refute that thought we
[38:14] reject that theory we're we're we
[38:16] absolutely refuse to believe those
[38:19] things
[38:20] ever again if we expect that to work we
[38:25] must also find a place of surrender in
[38:28] our lives to be obedient to God's Word
[38:31] to the wooing and the drawing and the
[38:34] leadership of the Holy Spirit to seek to
[38:38] know God's divine direction for your
[38:41] life it's important in this hour if
[38:44] we're going to use these strategies of
[38:47] God against the schemes and devices of
[38:50] the enemy it's important that we live a
[38:52] laid down life a surrendered life in
[38:56] other words one of the things that
[38:58] Laodicea the seventh of the church
[39:01] churches that were listed in Asia Minor
[39:04] and we believe that those seven churches
[39:06] and their characteristics were not just
[39:09] speaking about that time period but in
[39:13] fact those predominant weaknesses
[39:16] shortcomings and even sins that were
[39:19] represented in those seven churches have
[39:23] laid we should say overlaid across
[39:27] church history for many many many years
[39:32] 2,000 years of church history we may not
[39:35] be able to pinpoint them to the day in
[39:38] the hour that one ended and the next one
[39:40] began but we can certainly see through
[39:44] the shifts of political power and
[39:47] religious power in church history we can
[39:50] certainly begin to identify years where
[39:54] a church age was drawing to an end and a
[39:57] new church age was beginning if this is
[40:00] true and I believe it certainly is we
[40:03] are then living in the end of Laodicea
[40:07] the seventh the last of those Church age
[40:10] periods and one of the predominant
[40:13] things that that we know about the
[40:16] church at Laodicea and the spirit of
[40:20] this Laodicean church age is it was the
[40:23] the day of of people's rights it was it
[40:28] was a predominant movement in that hour
[40:31] too
[40:32] demand your rights even if your rights
[40:36] were contrary to God's plan or God's
[40:40] Word it's going to be very important in
[40:43] this hour that if we're going to achieve
[40:46] this place of becoming the lord's
[40:49] victory by defeating the schemes and
[40:53] devices of the enemy it's vitally
[40:56] important friend that we find a place of
[41:00] being able and willing to lay down our
[41:04] rights we're not banging on the table
[41:08] demanding our way any longer we now
[41:12] recognize that we are not our own we
[41:16] have indeed been bought with a price an
[41:19] incorruptible price a price that few of
[41:24] us have been able to even scratch the
[41:27] surface of understanding the life's
[41:30] blood of God blood that God created for
[41:35] the specific purpose of redemption
[41:39] placing that blood in the body of our
[41:42] Lord Jesus Christ who was the Word made
[41:45] flesh and that precious blood paying a
[41:50] price for you and I to be not just
[41:53] covered but completely redeemed back to
[41:59] God's original thoughts and plans
[42:02] concerning our life you see through the
[42:05] work of redemption it doesn't matter how
[42:07] far off the path you've gone it doesn't
[42:11] matter how vile your sins have been it
[42:13] doesn't matter how much time you spent
[42:15] running from the truth of God by his
[42:19] work of redemption in your life you
[42:21] become justified and we like to say
[42:26] that's just if I'd never sinned this is
[42:31] a work of Grace and a work of beauty
[42:34] that God wants to execute in your life
[42:37] and when you come under the influence
[42:40] and under the understanding of what
[42:43] redemption is it's
[42:45] it somehow makes it easier to find that
[42:49] place of saying yes Lord yes Lord not my
[42:53] will not my rights not what I want I
[42:56] want to live a laid down life of service
[43:01] and obedience to you so in order for
[43:04] this threefold strategy given to us in
[43:07] 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 in
[43:09] order for that to work in tearing down
[43:12] strongholds and dealing with the with
[43:15] the works of the enemy and his lies and
[43:18] devices against us we've got to finish
[43:20] all three we've got to make sure that
[43:23] we're being sensitive to the leadership
[43:25] of the Lord in our life and we're saying
[43:28] a great big amen to what he's calling us
[43:30] into in this hour part of living in a
[43:34] place of maintained victory because I
[43:37] don't want to just defeat a thought
[43:38] process and go on to have something
[43:40] worse I want to come to a place of being
[43:43] able to recognize throw up a thought
[43:46] process before it comes into being a
[43:49] stronghold that the enemy can use
[43:52] against me over and over again I want to
[43:54] walk in a place of maintained victory if
[43:57] Jesus is the victor and Jesus is living
[44:00] inside of me I become the victory his
[44:03] victory his reward and so I want to find
[44:08] that place of walking in maintained
[44:10] victory and the only way we can do that
[44:13] is to is to make sure that we're not
[44:16] giving ourselves that we're not yielding
[44:19] to the enemy in what he's trying to
[44:21] accomplish when you recognize the enemy
[44:23] working in something get away from that
[44:26] if he's working in your thoughts you
[44:29] pull those thoughts down and begin to
[44:31] think the truth of God's Word and speak
[44:33] it somebody said I can't silence the
[44:36] voice of doubt in my head or yes you can
[44:39] you get in your stand in the middle of
[44:41] your floor and read God's truth read it
[44:45] right out loud there's such power in the
[44:48] spoken word there's such Authority in
[44:51] the spoken word we're called as
[44:53] believers to both decree and to declare
[44:56] the truth of
[44:58] God's Word and it's hard to listen to
[45:01] the enemy when you're speaking the truth
[45:03] of God's Word into the atmosphere
[45:05] okay maybe someone will think you're
[45:07] crazy but I'll tell you that that is
[45:10] actually an expression of great sanity
[45:13] because it means that you have come to
[45:15] recognize that in every way that the
[45:18] enemy comes against you God has a way
[45:21] out remember what the scripture said
[45:24] with every temptation with every
[45:27] situation instead of circumstances that
[45:30] Satan races up in your life to defeat
[45:33] you God is opening a door God is opening
[45:37] an opportunity for you to step away from
[45:40] that temptation for you to step away
[45:42] from that process of destruction and
[45:45] come into agreement with God's Word who
[45:48] wouldn't want to serve a god like that
[45:51] the truth is we've got to make sure that
[45:55] we are never yielding ourselves to the
[45:57] plots and plans of the enemy vision
[46:00] chapter 4 in verse 27 tells us that
[46:03] we're not to give the devil place we're
[46:06] not to give him any space you know what
[46:09] that means it means a foothold a place
[46:13] to you know if you're climbing a
[46:15] mountain you're looking for a place to
[46:17] get a handhold or you're looking for a
[46:20] place to get a foothold and if you don't
[46:23] find that place you're not gonna climb
[46:25] any higher the enemy in the same manner
[46:28] is looking to get a foothold to get a
[46:30] handhold or a position in your life he
[46:34] wants to work in your mind he wants to
[46:36] cause strife in your family he wants to
[46:39] cause confusion in your church but if
[46:42] you and I are watching for his schemes
[46:44] and devices we can stop him we can cut
[46:48] him off at the pass and we can refuse to
[46:51] give place or space to the enemy
[46:54] Ephesians 4:27 in the King James says it
[46:58] this way neither give place to the devil
[47:01] period not a whole lot of instruction on
[47:05] how not to do it but but a very plain
[47:09] instruction or commandment
[47:11] that we should not so we discover we
[47:15] will discover if we if we seek to if we
[47:18] pray to if we ask the Lord Lord helped
[47:20] me to recognize any way that Satan
[47:26] desires to get space we don't have to
[47:30] give the devil real estate in our
[47:32] thoughts we don't have to give him real
[47:35] estate in our churches we don't have to
[47:38] give up space in defeat to the enemy
[47:41] we've been called to occupy territory
[47:44] according to God's Word the Bible tells
[47:47] us as we identify ourselves with the
[47:50] children of Israel that our footsteps
[47:53] means possession we can claim the
[47:56] promises of God until we see them
[47:59] activated in in our lives but if we
[48:03] allow the enemy to get in turn our head
[48:06] and refuse to hear the Spirit of God who
[48:12] often tries to warn us I'm telling you
[48:16] this sweet holy ghost how precious he is
[48:21] to try to warn us to try to steer us in
[48:26] the right direction to try to expose the
[48:30] enemy to us and sometimes we're too busy
[48:32] we're too stubborn oh we're too
[48:36] hardheaded to listen to the leadership
[48:39] of the Holy Spirit when he tries to lead
[48:42] us away from a particular situation
[48:45] we've got to be sensitive we've got to
[48:48] ask the Lord how do I become sensitive
[48:51] you just have to ask the Lord again and
[48:53] again if necessary Lord I want to be
[48:55] sensitive to your voice help me to
[48:58] discern your voice and to be able to
[49:01] distinguish your voice from all other
[49:04] voices someone recently wrote the
[49:07] ministry because of this program on the
[49:10] gospel channel and their confession was
[49:13] I sometimes find it difficult to be able
[49:17] to discern the voice is this God leading
[49:22] me or is it the in
[49:24] me the best advice that I know to give
[49:27] you to know the difference is does it
[49:29] line up with the word this is the
[49:33] absolute truth of God's Word in written
[49:37] form this is the record of God's eternal
[49:40] Word in written form and we can use it
[49:44] and utilize the gift that it is in our
[49:49] lives
[49:50] if you're feeling leadership or
[49:54] direction or you're hearing something in
[49:57] your spirit man and you're not 100% sure
[50:02] approach the Bible in a prayerful way
[50:06] let me give you an example you might
[50:09] come to the word and you might pray Oh
[50:12] father direct my my work my thoughts
[50:16] direct my fingers my hands to find a
[50:20] place to find something in this
[50:23] beautiful love gift you've given me that
[50:28] would help me to be able to identify and
[50:31] to recognize if this leadership that I
[50:34] have is of you or if it is indeed of the
[50:38] enemy I have to believe that if this is
[50:41] what we have if this is what God has
[50:43] given us I have to believe your answer
[50:46] is found in this word if you have a
[50:49] question concerning how to walk with God
[50:53] and what is God and what is not God I
[50:56] have to believe that the Word of God in
[51:00] conjunction in cooperation with the Holy
[51:04] Ghost the Holy Spirit inside of you I
[51:06] have to believe that's the greatest tool
[51:08] that anyone could ever hope for to be
[51:12] able to differentiate between the two
[51:14] voices and to distinguish what is the
[51:17] true leadership of God in my life for
[51:20] this season I think we find it hard to
[51:24] know the difference sometime because we
[51:26] get a little caught up in the
[51:27] circumstances and we just need to pause
[51:29] we just need to take a minute and come
[51:33] before the Lord and approach God's Word
[51:35] in a prayer
[51:36] I actually suggest that when you're
[51:40] gonna sit down and do your Bible reading
[51:42] you don't just open the Bible and start
[51:44] reading but I suggest that you pray in a
[51:48] very prayerful way you come meditating
[51:51] in your heart asking that the Lord would
[51:54] lead you and direct you to the scripture
[51:57] where he would have you to be I think
[51:59] it's a wonderful idea to follow a Bible
[52:02] reading program but I think we should be
[52:04] fluid enough we should be flexible
[52:07] enough that if we pray and the Lord
[52:09] directs us in another direction that we
[52:12] should hope that his leadership will
[52:15] bring us to an answer for a situation
[52:18] that we're facing at the moment
[52:21] Ephesians 4:27 in the amplified we were
[52:24] talking about handholds and footholds in
[52:27] space it says leave no such room our
[52:30] foothold for the devil in other words it
[52:34] says give no opportunity to him just
[52:37] shut him off at the pass when he comes
[52:40] with a lie just shut him up by
[52:42] confessing the truth over your family
[52:46] over your life over your circumstance
[52:49] what the enemy often does in a situation
[52:52] like this is he stirs us in the soul
[52:56] realm he stirs us in the emotions I want
[53:01] you to know your emotions are not your
[53:03] enemy God gives us emotion but all how
[53:06] the enemy will use our emotions to give
[53:10] us amnesia it seems like when our
[53:13] emotions get stirred in anger we forget
[53:17] everything that we've ever known about
[53:19] how to handle ourselves in a moment like
[53:22] that I'm going to pray that God will
[53:25] help this threefold strategy to come
[53:29] alive in your life that you won't find
[53:32] it as just a cheesy piece of advice but
[53:35] that you will see it for what it really
[53:38] is there's power in applying God's Word
[53:42] to your life individually we must cast
[53:46] down imaginations we must bring every
[53:49] thought into captivity submitting it to
[53:52] the obedience of Christ and we must then
[53:55] surrender in obedience to his word to
[53:59] his leadership to his divine direction
[54:01] I'm going to pray that God will use that
[54:04] strategy in your life and that he'll
[54:06] give you special grace to bring your
[54:09] emotions down when you need to hear
[54:13] God's voice speaking to you father I
[54:16] want to thank you again for this
[54:18] opportunity that you have given me today
[54:21] to teach from my heart to speak truth
[54:24] that you have quickened to me and made
[54:27] real to me in my life I am NOT someone
[54:30] who confesses to know it all there's so
[54:34] much more of you that I want to know and
[54:36] understand and walk in but I want to be
[54:40] faithful to release what you have given
[54:43] me to benefit to bless to strengthen
[54:47] others I pray right now for the grace of
[54:50] God to take ahold of people's lives as
[54:53] they approach a way of bringing down
[54:57] strongholds that the enemy has built
[55:00] over them I pray that you will take
[55:03] Ephesians 10 and 5 and you will quicken
[55:06] it to the believer right now to the
[55:09] heart of the believer that you would
[55:12] show them you might expand this truth to
[55:15] them
[55:15] Lord you might give them even greater
[55:18] understanding of what I have brought
[55:20] today in seed form but I ultimately
[55:23] desire Oh Lord Jesus that you let your
[55:28] people walk in a place of victory until
[55:31] we our lives and the way we overcome
[55:35] circumstances is a testimony of your
[55:38] faithfulness of your grace and of what
[55:42] you have provided for us that we might
[55:46] overcome thank you Lord that we are not
[55:49] in this alone thank you that you are
[55:51] with us by the power of the Holy Spirit
[55:55] and you plan to stick with us and see us
[55:59] through to the end
[56:00] I thank you for healing
[56:02] the sick I thank you for directing with
[56:06] leadership those who need answers in
[56:09] their life I thank you for sharpening
[56:12] those who have asked Lord I want to know
[56:15] is this your voice is this the voice of
[56:18] my enemy lord I pray that by the power
[56:21] of the Holy Spirit you would sharpen
[56:24] that gift that spiritual discerning that
[56:27] we would know and quickly recognize if
[56:31] this be of God or if this is a play on a
[56:35] trick of the enemy to take us off the
[56:37] path Lord grant that to the believer and
[56:41] Lord speak to someone who is not
[56:44] trusting you fully in salvation and may
[56:47] they come to a place of born-again
[56:50] reality I pray in the name of the Lord
[56:53] Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah all
[56:56] thank you so much for being with us
[56:59] today thank you for allowing me to speak
[57:03] my heart I get a little passionate about
[57:05] this subject because I know we've got an
[57:08] adversary out there who's walking about
[57:11] roaming about seeking whom he may devour
[57:13] but I'm so thankful to God that the word
[57:17] gives us the strategy we need so that we
[57:21] would never ever have to be ignorant of
[57:24] the devil schemes and devices
[57:27] I just want to bless you in the name of
[57:29] the Lord my heart is just swelling with
[57:33] love for you and I commit to continue in
[57:37] prayer until you become the victory that
[57:40] Jesus wants you to be god bless you
