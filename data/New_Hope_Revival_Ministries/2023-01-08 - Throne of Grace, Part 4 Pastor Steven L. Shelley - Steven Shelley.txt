word and they are faithful Lord to support the work of this house Lord I know that that doesn't mean much in this world but in the Kingdom to keep Covenant with you is of Great Value and I'm asking you on their behalf that you would stand Lord in intercession for her need right now Lord she's in that very precarious place right on the edge and the doctors feel they need to sedate her to put more air flow into her lungs and Lord we know the dangers that go along with that so we are declaring according to your word that with your stripes Naomi is healed in the name of Jesus that you would reach into that hospital room today and give her a Miracle of Miracles drive back the hand of the enemy and loose her from the infirmity that has tried to take her body oh for her children for her husband

as my mom on November 11th I got a phone call when I was at work and it was my mom she was headed to the hospital and with a pretty severe break in her leg and she told me that she would have to have emergency surgery and at that moment everything changed because she was the second caregiver for my grandmother who was bed bound so I didn't know what to do and I just cried and so I went on and I said you know what lord I can't do anything now that evening the doctor called me with a report as to what was going on he said that she had a pretty severe break her ankle shattered into three pieces and that due to the break and the skin was broken and she was in a stable that it is potential that she could lose her leg um at least below the knee and at that moment I almost just lost it I didn't know what to say or do and God is so faithful because the sweet presence of the Lord came and just rushed in like a mighty Russian wave and peace fell over me and he just whispered into my heart she's not going to lose her leg and I said to the doctor sir I thank you for everything you've done for my mom I thank you for what you're doing but God is her healer and I know he will hear heal her and I stand here today to tell you that when the report came from the nurse or the the front receptionist she said ma'am I want you to know it is a miracle you kept your leg so God is the same any promise you have just know he's going to meet it he's the same God [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] I won't be discouraged even when I'm discouraged I'll remind my soul of all you've done for me I won't be distracted even into distractions I will trust the one who is greater than the storm I will trust the one who is greater than the storm [Music] s here today even in my darkest moment this will be

rises the sun sets we see the moon the reflection of the Sun as it comes back around the changing of the seasons all of these things that look so natural to us it's by the hand of God that they were created Supernatural and God continues to do Supernatural things that are not as common to us and we praise him for it he is so marvelous even the way that he's helping us to rid ourselves of this

presence is here and he deserves that we give him our full attention to see what he would like to do for us how many of you came with needs today well that's all right because the one who meets all of our needs beat you here and he is more than able to meet all of those needs today according to his riches in glory we're glad to see so many of you here today that have not been here you've been traveling and taking you a while to get back and get settled in and we're glad to see you in the house of the Lord today is uh the anniversary of a fairly substantial manifestation of God's Supernatural power that took place just one generation ago in 1961 brother Branham had been teaching on the church ages and uh from from the first few chapters of the Book of Revelation he had been going over those with the people and on January the 8th 1961 in a sermon that he called Throne of mercy and judgment but it is now called I think Revelation chapter four part three and uh there was a pillar of fire that came into the building and there had been a drawing on the board of the phases of the Moon and how that it had uh waned as it came toward laodicea until there was just a tiny sliver of light and we have photographs of when the pope was visiting I think it was Jerusalem and they took a picture of the phases of the moon that looked very similar to what had been drawn out on the board but the Holy Spirit came and the pillar of fire came the supernatural presence of God came and copied what was written on the board now talk about vindication if if if the Holy Ghost were to come and take my notes and ride them on that wall over there I'm telling that'd be Vindication and so the pillar of fire just came and wrote on the wall the exact drawing that had been up there of the phases of the moon well the people screamed and brother Branham rebuked them if you'll go back and listen to the tape you'll hear brother Brandon bringing correction to him he said no no no that's not it it's there and what he went on to explain was they were moved by a reflection what they were seeing was a reflection of what God had drawn on the wall now that is a lesson for us because we can get excited over something that's only a reflection we've got to look to find the real where's the real in here see and that's what he taught the people is powerful and uh he said so so he pointed out to them he said it's there he pointed to them the real Pillar of Fire that was hanging in the room he said some were looking at the reflection and then it began to move over people's heads through the audience and sister Gladys Dowd was there in that meeting and she screamed she's one of the voices that you will hear scream did anybody get to meet sister Gladys Dowd am I the only one in here sister Weems got to meet her did anybody else well brother West was with me and he's gone to be with the Lord but maybe someone else was with me but I don't remember who now sister Terrell I think maybe sister Terrell was with us but we got to go and meet sister Gladys Dowd and she told us this story of what it felt like when she saw with her own eyes the pillar of fire come and vindicate the truth there on the wall now talk about being life-changing and is that as that cloud began I mean excuse me as that fire began to move over people's heads brother Brandon began to call out names and diseases and cities where people were from because of the presence of that light and those of you that have read the Supernatural series written by brother Owen Jorgensen in book six it mentions that sister Gladys down was in the service and that she was one of the ones screaming on the tape and she saw it with her own eyes and what happened was the light began to wane and wax in front of them until it matched they watched the light on the phases of the moon began to change before their eyes until it matched exactly what was written on the board and you know that is a very powerful thing a powerful thing and today is the anniversary of that I like what brother Greely said today he's still a supernatural God I are you with me he's still a supernatural God and if it would be his mind he can come he doesn't vindicate Prophets he vindicates his word and by doing so the prophet's Ministry of course and the truth that he brought is Vindicated to us but if God was all the time vindicating me and we would look to men but he vindicates his word brother Branham even told us that the man can be false and the anointing can be genuine now you know that's really something if you don't understand that you go and listen to the message anointed ones at the end time and he'll explain it to you because in in Pentecost we used to think if a man was anointed he must be close to God then we found out he was running off with the piano player or touching boys just being honest we saw all kinds of things happen divorce his wife and married two or three more and he'd been used of God and revealed Secrets told people their names done all kinds of things because the gift that was in his life was a genuine gift and the anointing was falling on that gift when the man himself was not genuine so we want to know we want to know that this truth can produce a life among us I'm telling you it can it can cause us to line up with the word Hallelujah amen did you all have a good night last night I know there was a lot going on there was a terrible accident there on the Bleecker Junction a connection there is at 169 what is that what 250 on both sides is it 250 where 250 connects there at Bleecker Junction terrible car accident they tell me there was a loss of a life there and power was out ours was off for just a few minutes but some of you didn't get power till after midnight on this side of 250. you know that'll really mess you up won't it it'll change things doing without power but God helps us he helps us and we we have one worry ward in our house only one and she was quite disturbed about different things and the power going out and and just just really messing up life for us and I said we're just gonna have to start praising the Lord so I just made up a song much to her horror and I just started singing even with the lights off you know we're just going to praise the Lord it wasn't long before they came on he's good and he's God he's God in all of those circumstances and that's just a you know that's just a little inconvenience but my we will certainly face more serious things than that in the course of the next few years so we want our life to be focused on him and we want to be standing for the truth of the word of God how many of you understand that I also understand that today is an anniversary for sister Beth Polk how many years ago five years ago she was rushed to the hospital with a torn aorta is that right and that takes people's lives many people have died with the with a tear in their aorta bleeding out from the inside and she died on the table and God gave her her life back and added five years you want to say something really Steve if I can shoot um I didn't know how serious it was she collapsed when I got into Phoenix City in Houston so I screamed for people to move you know the hospital they don't move I find a guy to come get her and we went to the room and I started coming into the room okay all I can do is go to my knee yes at that hospital I mean we went to three but I'm gonna tell you and I had a pastor that was there we was all in a buddy room this doctor that hospital is not a cardiac Hospital okay and he kept coming back over she's gone we keep Reviving after she keeps leaving and go and go no you need to go back um that's all it's real because commencing enough that uh it catches yourself praying for everything yeah change me yes yes amen that's it that's it amen yes we know who our father is amen amen that's it brother amen sister Beth stand up and let everybody see how good you look

trying to see what kind of night you had in in your sleep mine was a very unusual night last night and I've been up for quite a while now and there were many many dreams many many spiritual dreams and some experiences I don't know how much of it we'll share this morning but uh it's it's powerful to think about this is going to be a year of the supernatural and a year of divine recovery and so we're we're believing that we will recover all how many of you are believing to recover all in your life that the enemy has stolen squandered thieved away packed away he's the original kleptomaniac the thief that word thief in the Greek is klepties he is the original kleptomaniac what good does your health do him yet he likes to steal your health he likes to take your finances what good do they do the devil he doesn't need money to do his job he just takes them for the thrill of you not having it but when you catch him in the act you don't just demand that he pay back what he stole but you demand that he give that seventh portion that he give reconciliation on top of the recompense and so that's what we're believing for not just restoration but we're believing for restitution that he has to give back more than he's taken from our lives and this is a year of such Divine recovery so so don't dare sell yourself short if I should share any portion of last night with you it would be this uh he reminded me of Esther and how that she had to see herself in the vision she had to see herself in the program of God she didn't see what a difference she could make Mordecai is talking to her she doesn't see what kind of a difference that she's going to be able to make in the plight of the Jewish people because she remember she had been hiding who she was Stay With Me I'm not even preaching yet she she had been hiding her true identity like some of you been doing she didn't want anybody to know really who she was and Mordecai began to talk to her and he said you know you're going to have to let it be known who you are you're going to have to stand up for your people and he said how do we know that that you were brought to the kingdom for such a time as this and I want you to know the bride is Awakening for such a time as this because she's going to make a difference in the world around her yes she's pushing back the darkness to manifest who he is the light of Lights he said I am the way the truth and the life he also said I am the light of the world and we know that a city on a hill cannot be hid and so as it has been said it's our time to shine and we want to see ourself in the vision the enemy wants you not to be able to see yourself in the vision well what difference could I make and you're going to have to make a conscious effort this year to place yourself in the vision if you're part of the Bride then the bride's inheritance is your inheritance so you place yourself in the vision of the bride's future you do that by faith this is a new age imagery this isn't imagining we're not drawing a vision board or a dream board or something like they teach people to do in in in network marketing that's not what we're talking about we're talking about discovering what the bride's purpose is and then placing yourself there instead of disqualifying yourself you need to qualify yourself and understand that his blood has perfected you that's how I know you're perfect for the job because the blood made you that way now you people that don't entertain the word but twice a week you're never going to make it you're never going to overcome I can tell you that right now my three hours a week with you are not going to be enough for you to overcome in this hour you'll never see yourself in the vision of the bride's future until you learn to Feast on the word every single day every day you need to be in the word every day every day somebody said I don't have time to listen to a sermon three hours a day you don't have to be in the word three hours every day but you need to be in the word you're sitting in a chair with your phone in your hand and then telling me how busy you are I don't mean to be ugly that's not busy that's not busy that's filling up time and space we're going to have to make sure that we use some time every day for the word of God in order to be able to grow because Satan's working overtime to take you out of the vision foreign I preached a message I think in 1996 seeing yourself in the vision and God Revisited some of that with me in the night last night and I see myself in this vision and you you can see yourself there let me let me give you this one example I know you're standing but brother Branham talks to us like this you know when we were in Pentecost we were afraid every time we every time we we left a good service and went home and and the devil told us we didn't have the Holy Ghost and it wasn't for us and all that was just emotion and then we'd call our prayer partner on the phone and they wouldn't answer and we thought the Rapture had taken place I couldn't tell you how many times growing up I thought the Rapture already happened and I'd surely been left that's not seeing yourself in the vision then we heard brother Branham and he said once you know who you are in him you can no more be lost than God could be lost that's powerful stuff if that becomes a revelation to you you don't have to fear hell you've just got to fear missing your opportunity to see yourself in the vision you place yourself in there and then you don't have to Fear the Future because you know who the future is and you know who owes the future so I take that one step further and say there can't be a rapture there cannot be a Rapture without me I don't ever have to fear missing the Rapture again there can't be a Rapture without me I was his seed when I got here and he knew how to get his seed he reached me didn't you have to repent sure I did didn't I have to follow through sure I did but I've known I've got to see myself in the Rapture Vision not take myself out of it okay praise God Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 we've been reading this seeing then that we have a great high priest let me just mention that our great high priest does not have an inferiority complex he knows who he is he has no identity crisis aren't you glad that your high priest doesn't hesitate he knows exactly his position that is passed into the heavens Jesus Yeshua the Son of God let us I've told you what that means it means throw your life around it drop your Bulldog jaw in it don't you turn loose no matter what the devil says don't you turn loose no matter what your loved ones said you dig your jaw down into it and let that bone slip down like a bulldog and say I'm holding on because I have a great high priest the next verse says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in All Points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come reluctantly beat down boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need isn't God good now I want to read one more place you've been standing a moment you're going to be seated for a while so let's just stand this one out if we can and if we can't you may be seated Hebrew it's always the case Hebrews chapter 2 verse 12-18 saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me now I tell you that's pretty powerful there you're taking a stand for your children how many of you know it's time to take a stand for your family if you don't oh if you don't stand in the gap for your family who will we must do it Hallelujah verse 14 for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil you want to know why Jesus died he died to destroy the power of death he had to die to destroy the power of death as brother Greeley told us the other night the the the the the accuser came to him but he didn't find anything in our Lord that would agree with him so he just has to throw up his hand and run away that devil that torments you so if he came to you one time and didn't find something in you that kept saying Amen to him he'd have to go and leave you alone he'd have to go find something else to whoop you with but the reason why he gets to to write us is because we give him a saddle that's what the old timers used to say you you can't give the devil a saddle he'll ride you all night you've got to make sure there's nothing in you that agrees with him if he comes to tell you how lonely you are and you agree with him guess what he gets on your back if he comes to tell you how mistreated you are and you agree with him guess what he does he'll ride you all over town come on he came to destroy the power of death that is the devil and he goes on and delivered them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage watch that no no no no no watch this they were their whole lifetime subject to bondage because they feared death it's true today you you you've got to be like Jake Hess you've got to say death ain't no big deal death is just a doorway to get over through there brother sister there's nothing to hold us here one more verse or two or three for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham thank God he did wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people the last verse for in that he hath suffered for in that he himself for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to sucar them that are tempted aren't you glad he is May God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated but don't let your attention go to sleep I I want you to look at a mass a quotation from the Hebrew series I read this to you recently paragraph 172 of the message Hebrews chapter 2 number two man always feared death that's what we just read in the scripture man was forever in bondage because he feared death now look what our Lord did Christ became sin now that's different than just carrying sin the church says he carried our sin if he carried our sin it would be like us are you with me it would be like carrying a sack of potatoes with you somewhere and if I should come along and lift that burden off your back and take that sack of potatoes I could no longer say that you were carrying the sack of potatoes so if sin was like a sack of potatoes and we say he carried our sin or he bore our sin all he would have to do is lay that down and you'd be lost is that right but the Bible didn't just say he carried our sin the Bible said he became sin the actual Greek teaches us that he was transfigured he was changed by our sin now Jesus was not ugly I want you to know that he was not an ugly human being he was beautiful to look upon until he became sin have you ever seen what sin can do to a beautiful person have you ever seen the the wrinkles that form like the Grand Canyon on their face the the look of their skin their ears change nose changes mouth changes there's nothing any more identifiable than a life of sin yet Mars the physical form so when Christ on the cross became sin his physical body the prophet of the Old Testament said his physical body was marred by sin scarred made ugly by sin he was changed from beauty to sin and in order for that to take place it had to be a supernatural work of the father so he wasn't just carrying your sin around to help you out he literally took your sin and became that so he hung there with the sin of the whole world not only on him but in him though he was guilty of no sin of his own brother Branham said Christ became sin made low to take death upon himself you know this is it's it's anyway it's powerful and he's not ashamed to be called our brother for he was tinted just like we are tempted and he can be the right kind of an intercessor because he stood the same kind of a Temptation that you stand and he took your place can you say Amen knowing that you couldn't take it yourself so don't you see brother sister the whole thing is Grace all of it is Grace it's not what you do anyhow it's what he's already done for you now you can't do one thing to Merit your salvation your salvation is a gift Christ became he became sin he was judged of the father the father has to judge sin so Christ became sin that he might receive the Judgment of his father the Bible tells us he was cursed hanging on that tree how could God be cursed How Could the Father curse him the father could have never cursed him in his glorified condition but because he became sin the father had no choice it was legal I want you to see this it was lawful it was legal it was according to the righteousness of God that he be judged to die so the father had to turn his back now we understand the word in Greek is kenosis and kenosis is an emptying and we can go through these scriptures again sometime kenosis is an emptying of oneself of all the deity that was in him every bit of that God every bit of that deity that was in the body of Our Lord must leave him it had to leave him because that deity couldn't die how many of you know deity can't die this isn't complicated don't look like it's complicated it's not complicated don't don't look like it's some big real confusing thing oh no it's exactly how he was made 100 God 100 man so all the father had to do was walk out God just left him what is that scriptural it sure is that's what kenosis is my father my father that's not talking about a trinity that's talking about the omnipresence of God my father my father why hast Thou forsaken me because the the God within him the deity the 100 percent of God that he was could not die under the curse like that [Music] so he emptied himself you talk about a beautiful plan talk about a real story to be told he emptied himself of all that was God about him and he died the empty shell of a man somebody said well then how in the world could his death make a difference for us who knows who knows if all of God left him and he died a man what kept Him from being just like any other man give me something else all those things are probably 100 percent true give me something else his blood his blood the only thing in that moment that set him apart from any other man on the planet was that he did not have human blood he had blood that was specifically created for Redemption so there he hangs an empty shell of a man God leaving him through kenosis brother Brandon preaches by the way I'm not making this up I'm not pulling it out of my hat he emptied himself of these things died an empty shell of a man but here is what the devil wasn't counting on that blood that blood that come running down that cross out of his veins that Fountain out of Emmanuel that opened up that day that wasn't man's blood that was blood like Northern man had ever had specifically created with the Zoe cell of life in it the very life of God and so that's how you were redeemed you were redeemed not because God died for you you were redeemed because a man died for you but he shed God's blood he said oh Father father why hast Thou forsaken me and the father had no choice but to turn from him because he had become [Music] our sin how many of you think you understand that let me see you if you do I think I'm understanding that he said now you can't do one thing to Merit your salvation your salvation is a gift Christ became sin that you might become righteous oh and he's the right kind of a chief Captain for our Salvation because he suffered just like we suffered he'd been tempted just like we're tempted and he's not ashamed to be called our brother because he knows what we go through with oh nobody knows help me now I feel real good I can see some of your whole lot tighter than I am right now I'm gonna preach till I'm tired how about that he got happy I'm going to get happy because he got happy all right let's go on oh bless me his name for verily he took not on him the form of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham Oh my he didn't become an angel remember this he didn't become an angel he become the Seed of Abraham and we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise see he never took on the form of an Angel he never become an angel he become a man and by the way your dead loved ones don't become angels why would they need to be angels they're Sinners that have been saved by grace if they called on the name of the Lord that's all they needed to do they don't need to wear diapers and play harps come on you know people put an angel in their house and they say that's my Aunt Mary that's bad theology bad theology he become the Seed of Abraham and took the sting of death in his own flesh to reconcile us back to God and now sets there for an intercessor my how could we reject it friend isn't that a good question how could we reject it the deity of Jesus Christ is the next quote and this is one that I love even if it was 1949. I love this he said how was it God's blood God has no blood how could it be because it was God's creative blood that he created in order to redeem us and came and lived in the same body that he created therefore he could not God had to suffer Temptation don't change this slide just yet he had to suffer sexual temptation nobody would want to entertain the thought of Our Lord having to be tempted by sexual temptation but he was 100 God and he was 100 man together oh I just love it I've had some religious Fanatics to follow me around through the years and they cannot handle this they cannot handle the fact that all means all and that all matter means all manner but what did he do he dismissed it how did he find the strength to dismiss and to resist he did it because he kept his eye on the go on the mission on the purpose there was a struggle with it father if at all possible let this cup nevertheless when we get so high and mighty we ought to practice the prayer of the Lord nevertheless not my will after we've told God how we want him to do it we ought to end every bossy prayer we ought to end every bossy Prayer by saying not my will Lord nevertheless here's what I hope for nevertheless not my will but your will be done he struggled to flesh was weak the spirit willing as long as he leaned on the deity as long as he leaned on the spirit he was strong but as soon as he started thinking with the flesh he got weak all over again he learned in the short years this is what you've got to hear he learned in the short years of his life how to get back to the goal and to do it without sinning now how do you think he was capable of doing that somebody said because he was God not at all it wasn't God tempted with sexual immorality it was man that was tempted that way he learned what you and I have to learn that the victory is in our mind the victories in our thoughts you've just got to get a hold of the thought and you've got to get a hold of it immediately in that what we've taught you through the scripture you've got to cast down imagination you've got to pull it down and take it captive you've got to punge it beneath the blood of Jesus Christ you've got to keep putting yourself in the vision and say there's more to live for than a few seconds of pleasure [Music] I wish somebody could help me today there's so much more to live for purpose and vision in life then a few seconds of pleasure he had to even be faced with the filthiness of sexual Temptation so that he could fulfill all let's go on he had to suffer all kinds of Temptation to be tempted by the devil in riches and powers and dominions and so forth he had to suffer all of that in order to do it he couldn't be as God in spirit he had to be God in flesh he had to learn to allow the spirit that was in him to strengthen him even to his flesh and the way our flesh is strengthened by the spirit is when we lean on the word and we lean on the truth and we constantly wrestle down every lie and every thought that exalts itself against the truth of who we're born to be you weren't born to be a fornicator you weren't born to be an alcoholic you weren't born to be subject to the flesh you were born to be subject to the spirit but it doesn't become an automatic thing it wasn't automatic for our Lord it's not going to be automatic for us but how many of you believe it's worth the war I said Do you believe it's worth the war paragraph 104 1963 how can I overcome he said how he said look Temptation was for him you know that the Bible said he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin this is how can I overcome 1963. on the new sheet it's the bottom of page two good do you think you do do you have it or did I did you're just working on getting it I just want to make sure I didn't leave it off he was tempted by drinking oh I just love it I just love it I just love it the thought crossed his mind oh look at my own folks been with me all these years heard me preach this time and time again and still looking at me like I'm off my rocker because you just can't imagine him thinking I'd like to drink that whole fat of wine I'm so tired of Peter Simon is running me crazy and now his wife's mad at him that's just a little inside joke from from The Chosen I got all of all that's mine give me a vat let me just swim in it for a few seconds up he caught that he caught that he pulled that down he repented of the thought by focusing on the righteousness of the commission you can too he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir so just remember this folks you are not God does not judge you for being tempted your your trouble with him is when you yield to that because your next thought after yielding is to justify and you can never justify yourself because the blood of the Lamb has come to justify you when you start trying to justify Yourself by telling us how stressed you are you are refusing the justification of the Lamb and you are leaning on emotional justification and how many of you know there's just not enough excuse to forgive us when we reject the spirit and choose the flesh so I want you to know there is no ways none that a man can be tempted that our Lord wasn't tempted and yet he did every bit of it without sin not because he was God but because he was man who learned to lean who learned to pull down the thought who learn to let the spirit lead instead of the flesh always leading he was in every way our example he had to go through it so that he could learn and understand how to suit her how many of you know the Bible said though we were a son though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered do you know how he learned he learned by suffering was any God why didn't he know it all why did he have to learn anything because he was 100 God and 100 man but God in him had need to learn nothing the man in him needed to learn everything is that right can you trust a savior like that let me see your hand if you can trust a high priest like that A Savior like that a mediator like that my goodness that ought to make you the happiest people on the face of the Earth isn't that the truth we we ought to be the happiest people that have ever lived on the planet not because we have an excuse for our sin but because we have a way out Devil Couldn't put a mark on him paragraph 105 this is one of my favorite things right here this is the definition of overcoming according to brother Branham overcome means read it for me would you was Jesus an overcomer why because he recognized the devil in every one of his tricks was brother Branham an overcomer why because he learned to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks do you know when you're going to be an overcomer well we've been Overcomers because we've overcome we've recognized the enemy it's just when he gets close enough to get in the bed with us it's just when he gets so close to us that we can't emotionally discern what's him that we don't overcome you know there's a lot of situations that we don't have to put ourselves in there's a lot of Temptation that we don't really have to go through if we'd learn where to put ourselves there's a reason why the Bible said it's good for a man not to touch a woman brother Brandon said any man any man that Drew a woman into his arms and he says drew a woman draws a woman into his arms for a hug any man is going to experience some sort of a sensation so do you want to know how not to be living like that and having experiences like that then don't be hugging women you men don't be hugging women it's really kind of simple hug your wife hug your mother you don't even you don't even draw your mother into your arms and pull her up to your bosom there's a proper way there's a right way you've got a granny in the church when I give my daughter-in-law a hug I hug her with a side hug to respect her and to respect the word that's what you're supposed to do because any natural born man he said that he talks about sexual glands resting and residing in the lips there's all kinds of chemicals and hormones that are released in the body I have a help app and my health app was telling me all the different things that kissing can do for my physical health I started looking for my wife I don't need a doctor I just need my wife's lips don't get religious it's not right for people who are not married to one another do you know how much stuff could have been prevented if a man and a young woman or a young man a young woman an old man or a woman whatever they are made a pledge to one another we're not going to kiss each other until we're married somebody said don't you find that to be old-fashioned I find it to be a good plan if you want to stay out of trouble some people won't choose that because they don't want to stay out of trouble I don't even suggest let me tell you what a prude I am I don't even suggest that that men and women boys and girls hold hands that are not married to one another because I understand how the enemy uses something like that somebody said I just don't know how anybody could live that way you can if you choose to and it's ever more the sweet it's ever more the precious it's ever more the holy when you wait until the appropriate time she doesn't belong to you until you vowed publicly before God and your friends the saints of God there's a right way in the wrong way and young people today even around this message get way off course we've had couples through the years and I refuse to marry not because of gossip but because I saw with my own eye the way they were rubbing on one another and it's not a good example for the rest of the body we're going to be tempted because we're living in a body of flesh but we can sometimes remove ourselves from situations it's one of the reasons why I believe in chaperones does that make this a cult if it does that's all right you tell them I don't care if that's what it makes it because Christianity in in its and it's rare and it's in its root fulfills every requirement for a cult so I'm not worried about words that get tossed around like that young men and young women need chaperones and they need chaperones that can talk and they need chaperones that can stand up and say hey I don't care if you hate me or not you do that one more time I'm going to blow the whistle from the highest mountain now sometimes they come along and they think because they're already in the 30s a grown in adults I've had that line used on me several times that they don't need to be what they do they need a chaperone your parents that don't enforce that you're asking for trouble my this is good why are you preaching this way today you're are you hammering on something particular that to overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks I understand that I miss quite a conversation on the on the night of the Hanukkah party about the way we do things and I miss the conversation so I didn't get a chance to put my two cents in now it's my chance we do it because we understand what happens when we don't do it the Bible Way the Holy Ghost way the way of righteousness let me tell you something you don't have to live a defeated life like that you can do the right thing I don't care what the enemy is tempting you with our Lord took it all born it all rejected it all defeated it all he overcame so you and I can overcome and what does it mean to overcome to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks people will pull you in they'll pull you into their stuff there's a whole lot of manipulation that goes on in friendships people will pull you into their stuff you refuse to be pulled in remember when when the pastor don't agree with them they're always going to look for somebody that will agree with them you just cut that right off and say we're not going there we're going to overcome we're going to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he said lots of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real and you must know he's a devil and he's real I understand there was people talking about whether hell is a literal place or not the Bible said it was and brother random said it was what else do you need of course it's a literal place where the church got it wrong is they called it an eternal hell in its Everlasting fire which means it has a beginning and it has an end because it's a created place the Bible said the soul that sin and shall surely die one day the soul that has sinned will cease to exist but the soul that has Zoe life oh we'll never die can you say man never die then the same time and you you recognize him let's see the same time that you recognize him and know that he's the devil and he's against you than to overcome look look at this how simple you must recognize that the god in you is greater and my dear then that old real devil oh he may be real but you've got one living in you that's greater and mightier than he is that's the one that's in you and has already overcome him how many of you are glad for your intercessor now glad for your great high priest now oh look what else he says in the ending this he said and by his grace I underline that for you anybody want to read that this is not an unfair War if it is it's stacked in our favor because you've got more power and more Authority you've got more overcoming power than that enemy to us you're more than a match for him amen There's real overcoming when you recognize it's in the recognizing it's in the not hiding no don't hide recognize recognize that that nothing has come upon you but such is common the man and nothing has tempted you or Common Man that hadn't tempted him and he overcame what do you do when you fail you tell me what you do when you fail you run to him fast as you can and once you've run to him and you know that he has forgiven you how do you know he's forgiven you because you felt better no sir what does feelings have to do with it well I ask him to forgive me but I'm not sure if he did or not because I don't feel any better what does feeling have to do with it somebody tell me what the word said did you meet the word requirement did you repent of your sin did you say Lord give me the grace to recognize the devil every time he comes to tempt me the next time if you did whether you feel better or not you're forgiven and you ought to live like a forgivened person a forgiven person all right one more confirmation and evidence Southgate California 1962. I hope you're with me he said I made a remark if I had two drops of the literal blood of Jesus in a glass how I would hold it to my heart and weep stand there watching that I didn't stumble to spill it as I walked with it to wherever I was destined to go with it hold it there brother Branham is making this remark about the preciousness and the value of the blood and he said if I had a glass and had two drops of that literal blood in that glass I would walk different very very careful that's a key you're catching it it's a key I would walk very careful I would stand there watching I'd hold it to my heart I'd weep over the preciousness of that blood that's what's wrong with the church we've quit weeping over the precious value of the blood of Jesus Christ I looked around this room and I saw some passion in here passion is not action or movement passion is something that strikes in the inner in the inner recesses of who a person is and when some of you were singing that song like oil upon his feet like wine for him to drink I pour my love on you and you begin to sing it you begin to mean it you begin to you begin to feel it and in your mind it was as though you were pouring pill or fragrant oil on his feet like perfume and your tears were falling down on his feet and ankles as you worshiped before him realizing how precious oh how precious it is to know that we have an audience with him when we come to worship not because we're worthy of one but because he made us Worthy and and brother random said I I would I would watch that I didn't stumble one way you do that is you keep your eyes on your feet because you're watching to see that where you step is going to be able to support you without tripping you without trapping you there are certain times in our life that we don't always have the time to stop and look down at our feet but there are certain times when we get in situations like some of us are in right now that the enemy is really working overtime to get us and we recognize it we better not make any steps that we're not carefully watching I have a an app that measures through my watch and through through the camera the the time variation between Heartbeats and and there's 200 000 articles that are written to support the science that the time between your heartbeat not just the strength of it but the time between your heartbeat can be just as telling of what's going on in your body as your heart rate itself heart rate is not much of a measurement really but if you really wanted to know you you watch the amount of time between and it not only can measure the time but by that science is able to tell you lots of things about what's going on in your body at that moment including whether you're vulnerable for sickness and what your stress level is and the app is so intuitive that it will even tell me sometime your stress level is at 97 percent try sitting down for at least 10 minutes and make no major decisions because science proves that people make dumb decisions I'm going to give some of you a good excuse when they're under those levels of stress and pressure they can't make decisions that are that are wise enough taking in the whole picture because they're acting out of the out of the fight or flight instead of acting out of a place of relax so I don't I'm not a meditator you know I don't do I don't fold my legs like a Swami or something and do yoga when it says you should take 10 or 12 minutes to meditate I have no problem with that because I know exactly how to do that I know exactly where to find my source when it's time to meditate how many of you know where the source is it's right in the word I don't know if I can see the scripture fast enough that I could share it with you but it talks about I'll get it for you another time it's here somewhere as I just put it here but how many of you know the Bible tells us how to meditate we arrange our heart we turn our heart toward his word let the meditation of my heart be acceptable you start checking your emotions and you check your thoughts and you check where your heart is and you start looking on who you're created by God to be and that's bigger than what you're going through at the moment I don't care how big it is I don't care how terrible what you're going through is at the moment we've got a god who's going to help us get through it all if you believe that same man he said I would watch every step that I didn't stumble placing my feet just where they should be I thought how I would hold those two drops of blood but you know in the sight of God tonight setting before me is a greater thing to him don't miss this than his own blood I said don't miss this because it's the purchase anybody know what he's talking about you [Music] it's not the price that's the most precious it's the treasure that the price has purchased you and I are more precious than two drops of the literal blood of Jesus Christ because had you have been the only person lost he would have shed his blood just to purchase your way out if you believe that same man Glory glory be to God that makes you higher than an angel it makes you up more value than the literal blood of Jesus he shed his blood for you and here I hold you in listening tonight of the Gospel he goes on then how close I must be to tell you exactly the truth because God will make me answer for it at the day of the judgment more than if I took the blood the literal blood and threw it on the ground listen sure you want to be a preacher it would be a greater penalty to mislead the people the purchase of his blood that it would be to throw the blood from the charger that I had in him oh God that's for me that's what I have to remember that you are the elect Lady of Jesus Christ I must not allow my frustration ever caused me to forget that you are more valuable and for me to mislead you is more dangerous more hideous than if I should toss the literal blood of Jesus out the window from a charger because you are what the blood was created for are you listening you are what the blood was created for you are what the blood was shed for so you are of the greatest value now look at Colossians 2. let's have just a little more time I want to read Colossians 2 14 and 15 in the Amplified having canceled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note the bond with its legal decrees and demands this is so important when you were purchased with the blood of Jesus Christ a legal transaction took place and every demand that God had made on you was met by that blood it was a legal transaction it cannot be broken it's a powerful Covenant remember I've been telling you that that the the he that sanctifieth and he that is Sanctified is one so you that promise that God has made that Covenant that God has made cannot be broken it's in force and it's in force forever as long as you walk in fellowship with what has happened in your life and we'll find the greater balance probably won't get to it today but we will having canceled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note the bond with its legal decrees and demands which was enforced and stood against us hostile to us this note with its regulations decrees and demands he set aside and cleared completely out of your way every legal accusation every legal charge that Satan made against your life Jesus took every bit of that all the way to the cross and it was canceled my sin oh the Bliss of that glorious thought my sin not in part but the whole was nailed to the cross and I bear it no more praise the Lord It Is Well with My Soul this note with its regulations decrees and demands he set aside and cleared completely out of your way by nailing it to his cross the deed how many of you know the deed has been cleared all the way back to the beginning brother Branham taught us way back to the beginning in in uh it is the rising of the sun is one of the places where he talks about that having canceled and blotted out in white all right let's go on don't we have another verse verse 15. God God disarmed the principalities and Powers that were arranged against us I don't know if you're in a good mood or not to hear this and made a bold display and public example of them in triumphing over them in him and in it the cross can I have verse 15 in the King James can you find that for me so that people can recognize it talks about spoiling and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it that's like nanny nanny boo boo he not only Beat the Devil he mocked him [Music] having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it oh that's good that word that that phrase triumphing over them in it it means disarmed the power it's the same root word as putting off divested exposed are made naked so basically Jesus stripped the devil's clothes off of him and made him stand naked in his defeat now we're not talking literal we're talking about a language that Paul chose to use when he's writing to the church in colossi he wanted them to know that this was such an open defeat that it was paraded around in front of all the underworld every demon that followed him every Angel Fallen by listening to his influence had to see the enemy ultimately defeated disarmed and stripped naked and if they choose to continue to follow such a defeated foe it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me but it would make even less sense for any of us to follow him when we realize that Jesus has ultimately defeated him and took his ammunition and the and the prophet tells us he's now no more than a tool in the hand of God to to perfect the Saints and he also tells us that the only weapon the enemy has the only Power he has the only Authority he has to use against you is what you hand over to him you know this puts some responsibility on the believer because we can no longer say the devil made me do it because we now realize that if he made us do anything it's because we gave him the power he has no power to make us do anything if you did it you did it because you chose to do it you chose to recognize that the enemy has already been stripped of his power stripped of his weapons and embarrassed publicly and openly he is that defeated he's that defeated he's that defeated one day you're going to look upon him in his ruin the nations of this world are going to pass by looking through that great chamber into the underworld and see the defeat the ultimate defeat of the enemy and the nations of this world are going to say is that the one is he the one that made the Nations tremble and all it took for you to overcome him was a boo just a tiny little boo why because everything you are is behind that boo everything God made you every Redemptive blessing it's yours and so when you say boo to the devil it's not just it's not just a boo it's all of Heaven backing you up now how many of you are tired of the devil running you all around you ought to be past tired of that you ought to be ready to have the victory over that thing once and for all now now just a couple more things and we'll close let's see if we can do it let's see if we can close let's see if we can close before two let's see if we can close before ten till two let's just see if we can make a game oh Luke's standing up there Luke Jernigan when my notes were printed off and he just said I just didn't know what to do about the show they just kept on coming out 27 pages I said well here's what you don't know Luke is I've already preached about 12 of them pages but I added a few things so I had to reprint Owensboro Kentucky deep calleth under the Deep 1953 can I give you two more thank you thou Spirit of the devil that has bound my brother I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God who came to this earth and fought principalities and robbed Satan and you have no legal right to hold him anymore Hallelujah where did Brother Berlin get an idea like that I just read it to you in the scripture he wasn't out of the word he was in the word thou Spirit of the devil that it ishma that has bound my brother I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God who came to this earth and fought principalities and robbed Satan and you have no legal right to hold him anymore and we stand under the commission of Jesus Christ said they shall cast out Devils come out of that man in the name of Jesus Christ leave him well that's how brother Branham did Deliverance Ministry he didn't coddle the spirit like message preachers do sometime today he didn't coddle it you didn't give it a bottle to suck I'm just telling you how I did it he didn't sit him down and interview him find out how the parents treated them let's see if we can figure out how this devil got in he didn't worry about how it got in he just knew there was a way to get it out he abolished the superstitious ideas and there are some great superstitious ideas among the charismatics today that they're really very superstitious because they think the only way that someone can have True Deliverance is you've got to discover the root in some field that they have special gifts of of finding the devil's name you don't have to have it I I know they have names and I know it can be revealed but you don't look any less powerful by not knowing its name because it ain't his name that's going to make the difference and it ain't your name that's going to make the difference it's that name of Jesus Christ you ought to help your preacher this morning they shall cast out they'll come out of that man in the name of Jesus Christ you know how we pray Lord If It Be Your Will would you help our brother foreign because it might not be God's will to help him you know it's God's will to help him it's God's will to help him we ought to raise up and try to help him he said can you hear me can you hear me now and this can you hear me now say Amen the brother says amen the brother says amen all right you may raise your head look this way I didn't know how deaf he was just a deaf Spirit like a dark cold Shadow go like that moving to him now he has perfect hearing now he said listen just a moment come here sir I'm going to whisper real low this microphone is very sensitive say man the brother said amen I love the Lord the brother says yeah I love the Lord say glory to God the brother says glory to God the Bram said I'm whispering see this I'm going to put my hand over the microphone so you won't hear it just me praise the Lord the brother continues to repeat and respond to what brother random is saying he said now I'm just barely Whispering listen to this can you hear me all right hear me now sir I can hear you playing yes now watch can you hear me now yes I can hear you playing amen God bless you you're healed my brother don't miss this he said now see watch the disease now if the man keeps believing that'll never come to him again because the devil wasn't talked out of his stronghold he was kicked out he wasn't invited would you mind very much leaving the man would it trouble you if I ask you to come and help get out of the man so he can hear no no no no he was dealt with by the authority of Jesus Christ how many of you believe the bride has that Authority it's part of the bride's inheritance it's part of the bride's inheritance now you need to understand that everybody that's hard of hearing doesn't have a demon but this demon was affecting this man's hearing there was no other reason for him to have hearing loss and so moving the demon moved the loss it moved the disease now this is the last one I think I gotta find it speak to the Rock Owensboro Kentucky paragraph 29 the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's the enemy but as long as God's my friend this brother Phantom I don't have no fear of him I want to tell you something you've got the same right as long as you know God's your friend I am a friend of God I don't have no fear of him did they hear it that's Tally's favorite song and it must be Zeke's now I am a friend of God I Am A Friend Of God I Am A Friend Of God he calls me friend it don't get much better than that are you singing it darling he said I just drive him right on back take the word of God and move him right on back out of his out of the place that he thinks he's holding he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally legally I told you this is a legal transaction legally defeated in every place thank you brother Austin for helping me so much I dreamed of you last night and I dreamed of three Austins clear as clear as a bell two are sitting here this morning and I saw God doing something when I first saw God doing something and a voice said for Austin I was moving toward Austin Yantis and the Lord said yes him and him and him and all three Austins were standing there side by side I told Brother Greeley a couple dreams I had last night I dreamed about a preacher that I haven't had any contact with in years and I don't know but a couple things about him I don't know very much about him he believes this message but in the dream he had come to me for a word from the Lord he said brother Shelley I need a word from the Lord and I just felt like in my heart you'd give me a word of the Lord I said north I mean excuse me I said South and he looked shocked and and I said you you had to before the Lord would it be North or would it be South and the Lord said South and then I had a dream about Alan Fox and I saw that that in this dream now it was just a dream that he wanted that he had wanted to play the guitar and and and and help lead others in worship I don't know if Allen's ever played the guitar I don't know I don't I don't know but that had been shattered it looked like so like the enemy had got involved in politics or something and and pushed him out of the way and and in my dream it was as though he thought in his mind he could never have that again and the word of the Lord came to him and said you contend for every promise that I have ever given you it's not too late for every word to come to pass just like that well in that dream I I then raised up and said for all the saints and I began to speak that over Lord give the people strength to stand up and fight for every promise that you've ever made and that's when he took me to Esther and talked to me about seeing myself in the vision telling people you you've got to see yourself there not take yourself out but see yourself there so anyway it was quite a Time and I just noticed that Austin Hodges was helping me so so well so faithful not distracting but so helpful I appreciated it he said he's ah I just drive in baby right on back take the word of God and move him right on back out of the place he thinks he's a holding he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place he said the devil the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere foreign and a password that's all wonder what he helps you get access to isn't that what a password does he hasn't got no legal right to any man that'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ all a man or a woman has to do is accept the promise of Jesus Christ and the devil's what wept now look at this you you all will remember this because when I taught on the on the uh what's that series called sister Jada that you all have been listening to you and brother transformed they called it on the app we had this quote in in that series and I love it yes sir he's whipped in sickness he swept in disappointments he swept in everything he swept in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is a big old shadow who are we talking about the devil the devil the devil the devil the very thought of the devil causes a lot of church people to get nearly to a nervous breakdown if they think they do anything that puts them on the devil's radar they start backing up I'm preaching to some of you because I've seen you do it anybody listening you start making a little ground afraid to testify I know how the enemy does he's tried to do me the same afraid to testify because you don't want to you know draw any unnecessary attention and and the devil just treat you any worse than he already does you know and so we back up well he's just a big old Shadow anyway he's already defeated he's swept in all these things so he just might as well go on down the street I just seen his red light go up over a wheel I just saw a dreadlock go up over the hill a while ago didn't you other friends talk about the devil leaving in the I start saying a forward but I guarantee you that ain't so the prophet drove afford I know the devil don't drive afford but whatever it was he went he I saw his red light brother random said go up over the hill a while ago didn't you he's gone he's gone yes sir all right praise the Lord I begin to feel pretty good now I want you to know folks this is the inheritance that we have it's the last scripture as you're standing and musicians are coming Psalm 46 verse one through three God is our refuge and strength [Music] why don't you swing your arms and get some blood flowing God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though there be a upsurge in Corona though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though our aorta tears though the waters thereof or are and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Selah why why do we have such confidence because God is our refuge strength a very present help in the time trouble a very present help in trouble don't we have so much to thank God for so much to thank God for why don't you lead us in worship why don't we take a few moments to

stand Fearless may we stand Fearless in the midst of the heat of battle may we be able to say at all times it Is Well with My Soul I may have had a tussle with the devil but I have come through it by
