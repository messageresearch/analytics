TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope a lord [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope revival ministries in Salem Alabama and I'm coming to you again on behalf of the gospel channel and our dear brothers and sisters there who work tirelessly to keep the network going and growing I'd say for the kingdom of God and we're just so happy to be in partnership with them you know the Lord is doing great things and I know that we hear so often that there has been a season shift or this is a new day or a new hour and we hear it so much around the church I think sometimes that it becomes a cliche and I don't like to wear it out but I have to tell you that that's what I feel I feel in my heart that things are shifting and accelerating that God is doing amazing things in the lives of those who will continue to submit and surrender to his sovereignty he's a good god I'm telling you we serve a wonderful father who loves us so much and he wants to use us he does I feel that and I hope that we can encourage you today you know we're not just filling space we're here on a mission because we believe that the Lord has raised up this opportunity to be able to bless you to encourage you to strengthen you and as I say every time we're together your phone calls your emails your prayer requests they mean something to us we take this seriously again we feel like that the Lord has opened these doors and we need to be faithful stewards of what God has placed in our hands and so when you request prayer when you share your need we want to be faithful to extend with you in faith and take that need before the Lord because well I followed the Lord along I've made lots of mistakes along the way but I followed him and he's a gracious and merciful father that's for sure and one thing I've learned is that he answers prayer the Bible says the effectual fervent prayers of a righteous man availeth much I believe that's a genderless promise I believe a righteous man or a righteous woman and don't forget even though we may submit ourselves to the Lord and we may be obedient to him in all things it's still his righteousness that we access it's not of our own the Bible tells us about our righteousness in fact in the eyes of a holy and pure God the most righteous that we could be would still be filthy rags but we've been invited to share in the righteousness of Jesus Christ what a gift I always say so often I say this until probably my Alabama congregation gets weary in hearing it but it's true God has required quite a bit of those who will follow him as overcomers in the end time but it's also true that everything he asks from us he supplies he gives us for instance he says if you love me obey me keep my Commandments follow my instructions and then what does he do he gives us grace Amazing Grace to obey you know when we struggle when when the will of our flesh or when our own soul seems to try to betray us in the sense that it goes after the easy way there is a grace that comes the more we humble ourselves before the Lord the more of his grace he extends I often say he puts it in our grace account and I believe he's doing that for his people all over the world and I'm praying that wherever you are watching this broadcast today that the Lord will see you that he will see your faith and when we pray and we join together in prayer at the end of the program I pray that the Lord will see you that he will hear your prayer he will recognize our faith and I pray that he will deposit a huge deposit of grace in your grace account so that you can be obedient to whatever it is that the Lord is asking of you in this hour so even though it sounds a bit cliche I want to say that this is a new season and a new hour in the kingdom of God and we must not squander it you know I was watching a conference recently online and an elder you know someone who has ministered 30-plus years was turning the service over to a younger man a young man in his 30s but with certainly not as much experience as the elder and as he's turning it over to him he said you know the crowd is here the building is packed the worship has been great anticipation is high don't blow it and it just really made me chuckle you know don't mess it up and so of course that young man was gonna give it all he had and and in fact it was a powerful word that he delivered indeed but I feel like saying that you know the the scene is being set for an amazing intervention from heaven I believe that God desires to intervene for his people and you know there there's something about this word suddenly it's kind of coming to my mind and God's ideas of suddenly are a little bit different than our ideas and because a suddenly doesn't happen until the time is full until the fullness of time and then he comes to his throne are from his throne suddenly so the waiting the preparation is not suddenly it's it's a process it's a journey in fact it's a day-by-day adventure serving Jesus Christ on planet Earth in this hour it's an adventure and it's it's hills and valleys and mountaintops and tunnels and and all that goes with the journey it certainly is but what a blessing it is to know that we're not on this journey alone you know if we're in a boat thank God he's in the boat with us and he's walking with us and so I believe that we are getting positioned for the Lord to come to us suddenly it's just that waiting it's just that that holding on and pressing in and not giving up that sometimes gets very hard and I sense that many of you watching this program today you you are just weary in waiting and holding on and pressing in and I know that feeling I understand that emotion and I know what it feels like to be where you are right now and and so when I say this don't think I'm trying to be calloused because I know what you feel and I have been there often times and I may be there again before this day is over we don't know you know at one circumstance one phone call can certainly make you weary and not only that it can change your life forever we know that but I just want to I want to say to you what choice do you have you know if you're weary in holding on if you're if you're growing tired of waiting what choice do you have you have to wait you know God's timing is not our timing and his thoughts are not our thoughts and they're much much higher than our thoughts the thoughts of God and so it's not pleasant to wait but where are we gonna go what are we going to do I tell you I've come too far now to turn back there is absolutely nothing in a loose life of sin that appeals to me now because I've seen what sin does I've seen the effect that it has on people's lives how it destroys relationships and it fragments families and it leaves you miserable so even if you're growing weary as a child of God I'd say if I had to compare the two one weary day as a child of God is still ten thousand times better than a day in the clutches in the control of unbelief of sin of the enemy because that's you you think sometimes as believers we feel hopeless well I want you to know out there that's where the real hopelessness is it's only in Christ that we find any hope at all so if you are discouraged if you feel a measure of hopelessness if you're tired of waiting just wait a little longer hold on a little tighter because I truly believe that God has seen you he's heard your prayer he knows where you are and according to the sincerity of your heart and the genuineness of your faith I believe God will meet you right where you are at the point of your need so hold on a little longer there's a song that we sung many years ago hold on my child joy comes in the morning the darkness it seems to endure in fact the song goes on to say weeping indoors for the night the darkest hour is just before the dawn what if I told you that there's a new day in the kingdom of God dawning we have a new opportunity right now to draw closer to him than we ever have before why why preacher why would you say we have a greater opportunity now because there's an invitation there's an invitation in this hour I don't know if it's I don't I might even say unprecedented this drawing and this pooling I see God reaching out to people in in my everyday life in in old relationships old friends acquaintances that I haven't seen some of them in many many years and when I hear from them or reconnect with them I hear some very profound things of how God is drawing them and bringing a soberness to their life that makes them want to focus on the things of God again instead of being carried away by the spirit of this age so I just want to say be not weary you know you say well I can't just make up my mind I'm not going to be weary but you can you absolutely can the Bible says for us not to be weary in well-doing for we will reap in due season here it goes if we faint not so that brings us back to the statement I made a few moments ago what else can you do but hold on what can you do but occupy jesus said occupy till i come well there are a few things we can do we can use this opportunity to lay our head on the shoulder of our Lord and learn of him he tells us learn of me take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly and my burden is light this is a golden opportunity in this hour when there is seemingly a stirring in the deep waters of the Spirit of God a golden opportunity for you and I to use this this opportunity used this time to really draw close to him to discover what he loves how do we know what he loves we search his word what God loves what God desires what God is looking for is outlined in His Holy Word and the more time we spend devotionally I'm not just talking about reading for for a habit or a discipline or in a religious routine but I'm talking about spending time in prayer full reading of God's Word I believe God wants to reveal himself to you you don't even know me no but I know the hour and I know my God and I know that if you are feeling a drawing to him in this in this moment in your life you've got to jump on it the Bible tells us that we can't just come to the Lord because we get ready to we just make up our mind now I'm I'm old and I'm too you know I'm too slow to get out and enjoy the world so now I'm gonna come to God that's not what the Bible says jesus said no man cometh to the Father but by me in another place unless my spirit draw him and so I just sense right now that the Spirit of God is drawing someone yield I encourage you yield to that drawing how do I do that just talk to the Lord I know that some of you have received perhaps religious training and you feel like there is some routine that you have to follow through on to approach God certain points that you have to make certain tools that you have to hold in your hand but I want to encourage you that God is nigh to you he knows you he knows your address he wants to hear your heart he wants to hear from you and you can approach God with honor and respect as a father without approaching him in a religious manner I know that the Lord taught us this beautiful example of Prayer our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name I understand that there is so much truth in the Lord's Prayer but I also know that some of the most effective prayer times of my entire life and ministry have not sounded like that at all in fact sometimes they start oh god help me Jesus help me and he hears me because he knows my heart he knows that it's not my desire to disrespect him or dishonor him I want to worship Him I want to live my life for him but the point that I'm trying to make is approach God conversationally you know if you're in trouble if you are in need just speak to the Lord what if someone hears me they'll think I'm crazy well they may think that already and so the least you can do is is use that use that opportunity to talk you're not talking to yourself as it might seem you're talking to the only one who can do something about where you are right now I actually want to share a few thoughts with you today and I don't want to do this part 1 part 2 part 3 so much because we've spent a couple of times together here on the gospel channel talking about the theme that the Lord was dealing with our hearts about at the beginning of the year taking sides with the word and I really want to I want to speak about that a little bit more again today but I want to do it in a way that you don't have to have particularly heard or watch the other programs to get something out of this but I want to start with the scripture that we've used before in mark chapter 4 verse 24 in the amplified version of the Bible I think it's actually 23 and 24 if any man has ears to hear let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend and he said to them this is Jesus be careful what you are hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who here so we talked about before the importance of knowing being careful being cautious of what we hear and now we're talking also about being careful how we hear and when we say be careful how we hear we're referring to what are we going to do with it what are we gonna do with what we hear if we hear the truth of God's word whether it's on Christian television or in your local church on Sunday or your daily Bible reading in your home or with your family what are we gonna do with the Word of God that we hear are we going to hear it casually and let it slip from us taking with it every every hope of the promise that was offered or should we engage it are we going to engage that word are we going to confess I believe that word and I'm going to surrender my life to that word I'm going to put it in practice remember the grace account remember if you think God is asking too much of you he has already provided the strength the grace the courage that you need to do exactly what he has asked you to do now today I wanted to go to another portion of Scripture with you for just a few minutes and it's in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and I was going to read verse 18 2nd Corinthians 3:18 and again this is in the amplified bible i think i want to go to verse 17 2nd corinthians 3:17 and 18 now the Lord is the spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and the amplified bible emancipation from bondage it's freedom where the Lord is where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom there is emancipation from bondage so if there is something in your life that binds you that holds you then we need the Spirit of the Lord to show up we need him to come in the fullness of who he is and set you free in fact make you freedom and then the the next verse verse 18 says and all of us this is a broad promise and all of us as with unveiled face I like that because we continued to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord do you do you pick up on the consistency that's mentioned here because we continued to behold in the Word of God as a mirror the glory of the Lord so this again is the concept that Jesus talks about in the Gospels abiding in him abiding in his word or he said continuing in my word and the Apostle is speaking to the church in Corinth ear and he says we with unveiled face continued to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord and here's the result if we continue to do this looking into the Word of God as a mirror we then behold the glory of the Lord and here is the result we are constantly being transfigured transformed into his very own image in ever increasing splendor I have a hard time reading that without feeling that promise we are constantly being transfigured into his very own image this is the desire of a child of God in this hour to be changed to be transformed to be transfigured into his image why because we've read there's a promise for us to be we have a promise that we can be transformed into his image we have a promise that we can abide in him in oneness in the same manner that he is one with his father I'm telling you you know I've preached the Bible nearly from cover to cover I'm not saying that I know it I'm not saying I understand it all or that I've covered every little portion but I tell you there there are some tremendous truths throughout the entire Bible but in the words of Jesus if you would just you know maybe make up a commitment or or make up your mind to read through the red letters if you've got a red letter edition of the Bible where the words of Jesus are in red and you're just trying to think where am I going to read next I tell you read those red letters because it is tremendous his words of life in fact I read to our church in a prayer meeting this morning where Jesus said my words are our spirit they are spirit and life you read those words of Jesus in in a when I say devotional manner I mean in a spiritual manner in in your approach you know Lord let me learn from these words let these with understanding come Lord I need to understand by revelation what you're saying I believe that's the only way to approach Bible reading I think that we need to approach it in a prayerful manner and ask the Lord to make it real to us to quicken it to our lives and when you just go through those words of Jesus and they become alive to you and you hear those promises he was bold when he said to the religious leaders of his day when you've seen me you've seen the father I don't do anything unless unless I I see my father do it or I hear my father I'm just living in obedience to him but for Jesus said I am one with him I am in him and he is in me these are powerful words but what about when Jesus started to say this is my desire for you my disciples my followers how many of you are listening or watching this program and you know in your heart that Jesus had more than twelve apostles or twelve disciples he has disciples today we're followers we're disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ students of the Living God much more than that I know we're sons of God for as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God but we're students under a precious teacher the Holy Spirit of God takes the words of Jesus Christ as recorded in the scripture and makes them again spirit and life in our heart and when we do that and we hear Jesus saying that that his desire is to be one with us to have us in union with him and and his life be in us when we when you start getting a hold of some of those promises I tell you it makes you hungry it makes you want that for your own life and here the apostle sometime later is making this a reality and giving us a practical approach to how to draw near to the Lord in such a way he said I'm gonna just start I keep interrupting myself I'm gonna start from the beginning again and all of us as with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly that's a process it's actually a continual process constantly being transfigured transformed into his very own image in ever-increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit I absolutely love the way the amplified bible and some other versions as well render this from one degree of glory to another I believe King James says from glory to glory and that's beautiful it is it's it's beautiful but I like the way the amplified brings this out because to me I can see the ladder I can see that it's a climb from one degree of glory from one rung on the ladder to the next to the next to the next and what's happening it's a process of Transfiguration that's what the verse the amplified version calls it we're being transformed transfigured the word changed metamorphosis from one image to another image how all by the Word of God by continuing to look at God's Word as a mirror and choosing to behold the glory of God you know some people say how the Bible's full of murder and it's full of adultery and it's full of of horror stories and so forth listen the all Scripture is given for inspiration for instruction God was faithful to to use men to preserve not only write the word but preserve the word men gave their lives so that you and I can carry a Bible in our hand died to preserve the integrity of this word and yet in my hand it's only printed words on a page but all these printed words they introduced me to the real word the Living Word the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah and I want you to know not not like just sitting with him here beside me as a friend but when we come to the revelation and to the understanding that he's not just sitting with me in spirit and I can't see him but I feel his presence but he's living in me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus the same spirit remember jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you in another place he said and I will send you another comforter and I'm telling you that's that's who this is that's living inside of us this is how our fallen human spirit becomes regenerated revived renewed transformed it's by his precious Holy Spirit so I encourage you come on up from one degree of glory to another degree how by continuing to look at the Word of God and behold you know that that's not just glancing beholding is is choosing to see something when I read the Bible I choose to see something I choose to see God's love for mankind I choose to see a path that's being outlined for me some people choose to see rules and regulations that constantly promote fear in their lives I'm not telling you that they're not Commandments and instructions there they are they're here they absolutely are here but when I see them and when I read them I choose to behold even in those instructions the Father's love for me you know this is a conscious decision that we have to make because the Bible is clear even the discipline of God is for my good I know there are hyper grace teachers out there that would have you to believe that there is no such thing well I tell you there is because I've been through some of that before you know the Lord loves me and he doesn't want me to fall flat on my face and he does everything he can to help me and strengthen me and protect me and keep me from doing that but if I choose to keep pulling away from the from the prick you see that's how the Holy Spirit of God comes just like a needle prick he comes to convict us maybe you're in a situation and your mind is working faster than the situation and you're thinking I'm just about to give her a piece of my mind I'm gonna really tell her off or whatever expression you would use and and before you ever get that out of your mouth sometimes you feel the Spirit of God in you convicting your heart and pricking your conscience and saying do you you better hold back a little bit that's the love of God for me and even in his instruction when he tells me be separate from from the world and when he tells me to you know to paid my tithe and when he tells me that I should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together we should gather together in the Lord's name and even more as we see the day of the Lord approaching and when he when he gives me instruction as a husband how I should treat my wife how I should serve my family and instruct and raise my children I don't see that any longer as rules and regulations and restrictions that are here to cramp my style or to steal my life I choose to see the love of God in the pages of this word I choose to see his mercy you know I said a moment ago about the Lord's correction and his discipline it comes but he's working on my life to make me a son one that is mature that's what he's doing in your life he wants to bring you from one level of glory to another he wants to bring you to a place of maturity we're no longer toddlers many of us have been following the ways of God for a long time and we should we should understand that it's time to grow up in every area of our life and again there's grace to do it God's giving the invitation he's providing the Grace and yes even the correction at times the Bible says that if we are not chastened of the Lord if we are not corrected of the Lord we don't belong to the Lord we're none of his we're illegitimate and I want you to know none of us would want to face God like that we are his he is our Good Shepherd our great Shepherd and he wants to teach us and instruct us I tell you I believe in my heart that if if it didn't have to be you know if the Lord could just love me into total submission he would rather do it that way don't tell my wife I said this but I've got a pretty hard head sometime and he loves me he I know I feel and since his love but but sometimes he he has to do a little bit more than just love me to get me to stop and say wait a minute what spirit are you under well what are you trying to do you know it's not what God would desire for you to do that's love folks that's love I'm so thankful I'm so grateful that I'm a part of a covenant like that and a relationship like that it's it's so much more than a contract it's a love affair and he wants to bring me closer and closer to his image and really I want that with all my heart and I've discovered that the struggle is sometimes not in the doing but in the being still sometimes we just have to be still before the Lord and let him work on us let his spirit see that's where that spirit of the Lord is so important now the Lord is the spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty emancipation from bondage and sometimes we so desperately need that emancipation that deliverance that freedom in our lives you know what I'm not ashamed to admit it I'd rather be transparent because I know there are so many people in this whole world who you know love the Lord who know the Lord they've had a measure of relationship with the Lord and they just are stuck they just feel like they're not getting any any closer to him just try yielding just try saying Lord I'm willing to cooperate with your plan for my life because I believe it's very important for us to come into agreement and telling you know telling Lord I agree with your plans and purposes for my life because I'm yours you know your life my life is not my own it's not your own we are bought with the price an incorruptible price the precious blood of the sacrificial lamb indeed the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world and that blood covers me because I've asked him to cover me in that blood and that blood not only covers my sin but it brings justification it brings complete reconciliation the King James word is propitiation it means that my sins are not just covered and one day they may be exposed again because the blood may wear off no no my sins your sins if we ask they are remitted the blood of Jesus absolutely takes them and and erases them from history as though they never existed in the sea of forgetfulness far removed as the East is from the West never to be remembered against you anymore praise God that ought to make anybody want to serve the Lord because he can right the wrong if we come into fellowship into agreement so one of the things that God wants to make real to us in this hour is that we would be able to truly trust and embrace who God is because some of us have a very distorted view of who God is let the word of God the the written record of God's Word let it reveal let it describe and then that let the Spirit of God take the description from the word and reveal it to your heart who God really is you don't go to the magazine to find out who God is you don't you don't turn on the news it's not CNN or BBC that we go to to get the information on who God is we go to this book and even in reading it we can miss it even in reading it we can miss who he is so then we need the Spirit of God to make it real to quicken it to our hearts who God is and then we need a revelation of who we are in God who we are we were chosen the Bible tells us very clearly that to those that God loved to those that he chose he he predestinated them I know that's a scary word in theology but it's it's about foreknowledge it's about God knowing you before the foundation of the world and he didn't just see your stuff he saw your heart before you were ever born he knew your choice whether or not you would choose to serve him ultimately or whether you would ultimately reject him on one of our programs we said I I was reviewing it recently and at the end of the program we we talked about the fact that as as much as it pains us to say some people will not overcome but the promise is there and it's available if you feel that quickening when you read those promises of how God calls the overcomers to come higher and maybe you begin to feel the pulling in that that you've never felt before yield to that yield your heart to that and tell the Lord you know if you begin to feel the Spirit of God moving I don't want you to think that this is all about feelings it's about faith in fact whether we feel him or not he's real and whether we feel his presence or not he's with us how do you know his word said so so it's not as much about feelings as it is about faith but I know what it means to feel the presence of the Lord he wants us to experience his presence and if you begin to feel that moving in your life when you're watching Christian television when you're hearing your pastor preach when you're reading the Word of God in your home yield to that until the Lord Lord thank you thank you for letting me feel your presence thank you for letting me have that connection with you so we need to know who God is and who we are in him because of his love for us and then we asked for a revelation of who that makes God in us who is God in me what in the world does that mean it means to understand the dimensions of his love for me and that he wanted to come and live in me this is it's mind-boggling I can understand a God who wants to live in eternity and look down on the world and I can understand a God who chose me and who saw me and who loved me not that I'm worthy but it was it was God's love toward me I didn't deserve it I didn't earn it but when I could when I get to thinking about a God who not just wants to sit above the world and look and watch things over you know maybe twiddle his thumbs while while history marches on but he wants to come and live in me he wants to live in you he wants to occupy your body with His Holy Spirit I'm telling you if the mighty Conqueror is living inside of me I can make it I can get through my problems I can get through those difficult circumstances of life hey I can do anything in fact the Bible reminds us I can do all things don't stop there this isn't just self-help no siree it's understanding who God is in me I can do all things how through Christ through Messiah who dwells who lives inside of me and he lives inside of you so when we hear the word of God it's sometimes it sometimes requires a another level of glory another level of Revelation in other words you know sometimes we read a scripture and we get something out of it and later on in our journey we read those same verses and we get something else out of it you understand another level of Revelation another degree of glory yeah I I don't think it's wrong to ask the Lord father I won't understand more from your word I want more of your word working in me and I want you to show me things that I've never yet seen you say but I've read the Bible cover-to-cover I understand many people have but we all can use another dimension another level of understanding from God's Word and wait a minute before before you misunderstand I'm not talking about intellectual understanding all that can get you in an argument you know on the park bench somewhere with a bunch of bunch of religious thinkers I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about a deeper intellectual understanding I'm sorry no I'm talking about another level of heart understanding God making himself and his word real to my heart to my life to make it relevant because I'm telling you the Word of God is relevant for today let me give you another verse it that's in my heart it's kind of bubbling would you turn if you maybe you're in your living room you can grab your Bible off the coffee table and if not then you can follow along with me but in John chapter 6 and verse 55 this gets this gets pretty deep in here these verses of Scripture I'm reading it from the amplified again John John 655 chapter 6 verse 55 for my flesh is true and genuine food and my blood is true and genuine drink uh-oh what does that mean what is Jesus saying let's read on Hugh feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood dwelleth continually in me remember what we were talking about just a moment ago hallelujah continuing to look at the Word of God as in a mirror beholding the glory of the Lord here is Jesus explaining he who feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood dwelleth continually in me and I in like manner dwell continually in him he's speaking about the word and the spirit the body word of Jesus Christ and that life-giving spirit the Bible tells us in the Old Testament that the life is in the blood and so when we're reading here about the blood of Jesus we're reading about the life that comes by the quickening of the Spirit when we feast on the word the Living Word the body word of Jesus Christ but how do we approach that by by this written record of God's Word then verse 57 just as the living father sent me and I live by through because of the Father even so whoever continues to feed on me who takes me for his food and is nourished by me shall in his turn live through and because of me Jesus wants to provide nourishment for your life in the same manner that healthy good whole food provides nourish for our physical body the Word of God is available to us for our spiritual nourishment for our strength in Jesus says whoever whosoever continues to feed on me who takes me for his food and is nourished by me verse 58 this is the bread which came down from heaven it is not like the manna which our forefathers ate and yet died he who takes this bread for his food shall live forever what a benefit he said these things in a synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum but here is something very important to consider this perhaps is one of the most mysterious and spiritual and supernatural sermons that Jesus has ever had with his disciples I'm telling you this this is another level he's often teaching in parables because he's speaking to many different groups of people and when the disciples asked him about why he used parables he explained because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to them it has not been given and so he was using parables natural symbols that had a deeper spiritual meaning for those that God desired to reveal deeper truth to the others got a good spiritual lesson they got something out of the parables but they didn't necessarily get the the full impact of what Jesus was saying but he knew that there were those who not only the meaning of the symbols but they got the root they got the real depth of what was being shared in the parable but here the Lord is giving a sermon of sermons it seems mysterious it seems strange please remember that he was speaking to two people many of which knew the law of Moses they knew that it was prohibited to to drink blood because life is in the blood it was certainly unclean to eat human flesh Jesus wasn't suggesting that anyone become a cannibal he was speaking to them on a much deeper more spiritual dimension level degree of glory and here's how it went verse 60 when his disciples heard this many of them said this is a hard and difficult and strange saying I don't know if there are any preachers out there but if you're watching how would you feel if your congregation came up to you Sunday and said god bless you Pastor but that was a hard difficult and strange saying this was their response but they were being honest and it goes on this is a hard and difficult and strange saying and offensive and unbearable message oh the amplified certainly makes it strong this is offensive and this is unbearable who are you talking to you're not talking to your local preacher down the road although he should be honored and respected they're speaking to the Word made flesh Jesus this is so offensive and so hard to understand we can't even bear such a word and notice it doesn't say when the crowd God heard it this was their response when his disciples his closest followers who can stand to hear it who can be expected to listen to such teaching verse 61 but Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it evidently they hadn't said it to him but he knew it he said to them is this a stumbling block and an offense to you does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you what then will be your reaction if you should see the Son of Man ascending to the place where he was before it is the spirit verse 63 I want to read it I want you two to hear it it is the spirit that gives life he is the life giver the flesh conveys no benefit whatever there is no profit in it the words truths that I have been speaking to you our spirit and life but still some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith for jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray him and be false to him and he said in verse 65 this is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him unless he isn't it unless he is enabled to do so by my father verse 66 after this many of his disciples drew back returned to their old associations and no longer accompanied him I've got just a few minutes left I've got a hurry but I want to read this jesus said to the twelve will you also go away and do you desire to leave me in Simon Peter Oh Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go remember what I said to you in the beginning of the program you're weary you're tired of holding on what choice do you have what is the alternative would you go back to sin would you go back to the things of the world would you forsake Jesus because he wasn't moving in your timeframe or according to your schedule no I don't think so not if you've been truly born again of the Spirit of God I don't think you may be discouraged you may feel like throwing up your hands and quitting but I don't believe you'd be able to forsake him and go back to the world i I believe surely you would have a response at least that's my prayer for you and I hope you pray the same for me I hope you would have a response more like Peter Simon Peter verse 68 answered Lord to whom shall we go you have the words the message of eternal life and we have learned to believe and trust and more we have come to know surely that you are the Christ the Messiah The Anointed One the son of the Living God and he goes on to speak to them about choosing the twelve and revealing Judas understanding what was going on even in their hearts I just love that I love that portion of Scripture where would we go Lord there is no truth but in you where would we get our life where would we get our help our hope our strength our comfort you alone have the words of eternal life this is what it means to stand with the word to take sides with the word not the book the Living Word if you continue to eat allow me he said Jesus to be nourishment oh my this is what we desire father would you make your word real and quicken it to the hearts of everyone watching this program who has that desire you are the Living Word given to us of a father who loved us so much and I pray that you will take us O God to another degree of glory of understanding and revelry in this new season we pray these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah thank you so much for studying with us today I've enjoyed being here and I feel like some of you have been pulling on the Spirit of God may God bless you as you grow in him we'll see you again god bless you bye-bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
