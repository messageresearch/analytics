[0:46] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelly and you're watching the Eagles
[0:50] cry I want to welcome you to the
[0:53] broadcast today and I want to say that
[0:56] God is doing extraordinary marvelous
[1:00] wonderful supernatural things in the
[1:03] earth and if you're not a part of the
[1:05] move of God it's time for you to connect
[1:07] in it's time for you to call on the name
[1:10] of the Lord receive salvation let him
[1:13] cover your sins wash you with his blood
[1:16] and fill you with his spirit if you are
[1:18] a Christian if you are a believer but
[1:21] you're not really born again you're a
[1:23] part of a church but you've never
[1:25] experienced God you mean to tell me
[1:28] preacher I can experience God for myself
[1:31] not only can you friend you must you
[1:36] must have an encounter with God and be
[1:39] changed as an individual how do I do
[1:42] that by searching the scripture by
[1:45] finding out what God's word has to say
[1:49] about a place of intimacy and
[1:52] relationship with Jesus Christ I tell
[1:55] you I thank God for the church it is a
[1:58] living moving breathing organism but I'm
[2:01] more interested in relationship than I
[2:04] am the church so it's very possible for
[2:07] you to be a part of a church and not
[2:09] know God you may know programs you may
[2:12] know liturgy but you may have never had
[2:15] an encounter with God for yourself it's
[2:19] time and I invite you to do that please
[2:21] contact our ministry if we can be of any
[2:24] service to you if we can encourage you
[2:27] give you teaching instruction anything
[2:29] that we can do to help you that's what
[2:32] we want to do and so we just release a
[2:35] blessing over you right now as you spend
[2:38] the next few minutes with us searching
[2:40] the scripture looking at what God's word
[2:43] has to say about our lives and what's
[2:46] available to us as believers in this
[2:49] hour I just pray that you'll be extreme
[2:51] bless today and I invite you once again
[2:54] to contact our ministry new hope revival
[2:57] ministries all the information is shown
[3:00] to you right there on the screen
[3:01] take it down write it down and contact
[3:05] us this week I know that you'll be
[3:07] blessed and I know we'll be blessed
[3:10] we are certainly interested in hearing
[3:12] from you and where you watch this
[3:15] program let's look right to the Word of
[3:17] God today shall we
[3:18] last week we started a teaching on how
[3:23] we exercise our spiritual senses now
[3:30] what what do we mean by that what do we
[3:33] mean by that well what does exercise
[3:34] mean to use you know it I found out oh I
[3:40] don't know year and a half ago or
[3:42] something like that I started trying to
[3:43] to do some serious exercise I've got a
[3:47] long way to go to be physically fit but
[3:49] I'm working on it
[3:50] I started doing some exercises and the
[3:53] first thing I found out was I had
[3:55] muscles in places that I didn't know I
[3:58] had any muscle well how did you find out
[4:01] well started using them and when I did
[4:04] they showed up with a lot of pain these
[4:08] muscles responded and they let me know
[4:10] I'm here I'm under worked I'm under used
[4:13] but I have been here all along and I
[4:16] mean for days I would be sore and even
[4:19] now if we concentrate on a certain area
[4:22] of muscles in a workout then the next
[4:26] day that soreness moves in but it's good
[4:29] it's really a good thing and this is
[4:32] going to sound very strange but I like
[4:34] it I have actually enjoyed the soreness
[4:37] somebody said well you must really be
[4:39] wacky well the reason why is because it
[4:42] tells me that I'm making progress it
[4:45] tells me that I am using my muscles and
[4:49] what I'm actually doing sounds pretty
[4:51] terrible doesn't it but I'm actually
[4:53] making tiny tears in those muscles and
[4:56] then my body so intricately designed by
[5:00] God rushes in to heal those stretches
[5:04] those tiny tear
[5:05] where the muscle has been stretched
[5:07] beyond its normal range of motion and in
[5:11] healing it strengthens the muscle it
[5:14] builds up and increases the the ability
[5:18] of that muscle to to help sustain my
[5:21] body and and strength and I noticed it
[5:25] the first time I noticed that I had a
[5:27] little more strength which when I had to
[5:29] pick up a heavy suitcase or a heavy bag
[5:31] of trash and I just tossed it up into
[5:34] the hay that felt good and so exercising
[5:37] the Bible talks about faith we'll kind
[5:40] of like a muscle every man's given a
[5:42] measure of faith but the more we use
[5:43] faith the more we exercise faith the
[5:46] stronger our faith becomes and so as we
[5:50] learn to exercise the senses of our
[5:55] spirit man we will find out that we're
[5:59] developing something we're developing a
[6:02] close relationship with the Lord Jesus
[6:04] Christ and we're developing the ability
[6:07] to live a supernatural life and so in
[6:12] the natural we are given five senses
[6:14] that our body uses are actually more but
[6:17] five that we we learned in school five
[6:20] senses to contact or to have
[6:24] communication with our earthly
[6:26] environment what we see what we hear
[6:29] what we smell what we taste and what we
[6:32] are able to physically feel and that
[6:35] information that we gather it goes into
[6:38] our brain and spiritually though we
[6:42] receive a lot of that information into
[6:44] our soul somebody said well what in the
[6:47] world do you mean by that well you can
[6:49] go to the doctor and you can try it to
[6:52] believe God for your healing but you go
[6:53] to the doctor and he gives you a bad
[6:55] report you hear that bad report it could
[6:58] be cancer it could be heart disease it
[7:01] could be this it could be that and that
[7:03] information goes into your brain and it
[7:07] filters into your soul and if you're not
[7:09] careful you'll just give up and die
[7:11] really you'll just give up and die well
[7:13] that's what the doctor said your soul
[7:15] will be cast down the Bible talks about
[7:18] the casting
[7:18] the soul your your you'll be pulled down
[7:21] and that will be like a wet blanket on
[7:25] the fiery faith that you once had and so
[7:28] it affects you it affects you what you
[7:31] hear affects you what you see your I
[7:34] gate what comes in affects you and so
[7:39] forth and etc these these five senses
[7:43] affect us in our soulish realm that we
[7:47] talked about the fact that we're trying
[7:48] beings body soul and spirit because
[7:51] we're made in the image of God Genesis
[7:54] 1:27 said so God created man in his own
[7:57] image now we started the program last
[8:00] time with John chapter 3 with a
[8:03] scripture that says that which is born
[8:05] of the flesh is flesh that which is born
[8:07] of the Spirit is spirit so you have a
[8:10] fleshly man and you have a spiritual man
[8:13] the spiritual man is made up of both
[8:17] soul and spirit spirit is the inside of
[8:22] the inside we said that we are sort of
[8:25] made like a three-story house we reside
[8:28] on the middle floor we have the ability
[8:31] to move up into the higher floor which
[8:34] would be like contacting the heavenly
[8:36] realm having communication and contact
[8:38] with the Spirit of God or we can move
[8:41] down into the lower level which is that
[8:43] earthly realm and there's nothing wrong
[8:46] with that we're made to function on both
[8:48] an earthly plane and a heavenly plane
[8:51] the thing is we've got the earthly thing
[8:54] down pat we know how to do the earthly
[8:57] thing but we want to learn how to not
[9:00] walk after the flesh at all times in all
[9:04] things we can walk in our flesh this
[9:07] fleshly body but we don't want to walk
[9:09] after the flesh we don't want to walk in
[9:11] the in the attitude of the flesh we want
[9:15] to walk in an attitude of the Spirit of
[9:17] God we want to walk into a spiritual
[9:20] place in him we've been made to sit
[9:22] together in high places in heavenly
[9:25] places in Christ Jesus we're talking
[9:28] about what happens when we walk in the
[9:31] spirit and we need
[9:32] to do that we need to walk in the spirit
[9:34] if we walk in the flesh always we're
[9:37] going to fulfill the lust of the flesh
[9:39] but if we learn to walk in the spirit
[9:41] we're gonna fulfill the will of God now
[9:44] which would you rather do satisfy the
[9:46] realm of the flesh the desire of the
[9:48] flesh or satisfy God your Creator well I
[9:52] know the answer I know what your answer
[9:54] would be now man was made Genesis 1:27
[9:59] in the image and in the likeness of God
[10:01] as God is a triune being Father Son and
[10:04] Holy Spirit you are a triune being body
[10:07] soul and spirit when Adam and Eve fell
[10:11] in the garden this is a long a long
[10:13] story we won't go into all the details
[10:16] of that we have shared different aspects
[10:18] of that with you on the program before
[10:19] we believe what the New Testament says
[10:22] Adam was not deceived
[10:24] the Bible clearly says it was Eve that
[10:26] was deceived in the fall well what in
[10:28] the world does that mean didn't the
[10:30] Bible say that Adam that she gave Adam
[10:32] to eat of the fruit and he did partake
[10:34] as well yes the Bible said that the
[10:37] difference is Eve did it by the spirit
[10:39] of deception Adam went into it with his
[10:42] eyes wide open he knew what he was doing
[10:46] so many simple isn't that worse well in
[10:49] some ways it is but when we read the
[10:53] teachings of the Apostle Paul we
[10:55] understand that what Adam was doing is
[10:58] he was covering the sin of Eve by
[11:02] partaking by taking on that sin he was
[11:05] then placing himself as the head of the
[11:08] house in a position to receive the
[11:11] judgment of God
[11:12] covering Eve not that she wouldn't be
[11:15] judged she was judged but Adam placed
[11:18] himself in a position where he would
[11:20] hear directly from God on the issue now
[11:23] why is that important because that's
[11:25] what our Lord Jesus did he who knew no
[11:28] sin now the difference between the first
[11:30] Adam and the second Adam our Lord Jesus
[11:32] Christ Yeshua the Messiah is that Adam
[11:36] completely partook of the sin the Lord
[11:39] Jesus knew no sin but he took on our sin
[11:43] he carried our sin
[11:46] he did not participate in our sin Adam
[11:49] participated in the sin that Eve had
[11:52] committed our Lord Jesus took it on his
[11:54] physical body he bought it to the cross
[11:57] and and it was ugly it was ugly
[12:01] he was marred and scarred until he would
[12:05] hardly have been physically recognizable
[12:09] he wore physically the marks of sin and
[12:14] shame but he did not participate or
[12:18] partake in sin as Adam did now in the
[12:23] fall of Adam and Eve in the garden that
[12:27] ability to walk with God in the spirit
[12:30] was lost we read about in the scripture
[12:33] that Adam and Eve walked with God in the
[12:36] cool of the day can you imagine they
[12:39] walked and talked with all-mighty God
[12:44] they had communication they had
[12:48] communion they had fellowship with him
[12:51] what was the nature of their fellowship
[12:53] you might ask the answer is simple it
[12:56] was spirit to spirit spirit to spirit
[13:01] they were not communicating as you and I
[13:03] communicate flesh to flesh we
[13:06] communicate flesh to flesh and I should
[13:11] say in a normal situation we're
[13:13] communicating flesh to flesh now what
[13:16] why'd you say that preacher well there
[13:17] are times that when we're both walking
[13:19] together in the realm of the Spirit
[13:21] there is spiritual communication going
[13:23] on somebody said what do you mean well
[13:25] on the simplest level our spirit can
[13:29] bear witness the Bible talks about that
[13:32] that our spirit can bear witness with
[13:35] the spirit of somebody else and know
[13:37] that we both are children of God a
[13:40] kindred spirit have you ever met anybody
[13:43] for the first time maybe never even had
[13:46] verbal communication with them but you
[13:48] knew they were a child of God there was
[13:51] something being communicated on that
[13:53] spirit to spirit level a low level I
[13:56] might add but it was yet of
[13:59] of spirit to spirit communication this
[14:02] is how Adam Fellowship this is how Eve
[14:04] commune with God spirit to spirit their
[14:08] communication though they were walking
[14:09] Adam and Eve in their fleshly body it
[14:12] was their spirit it was that living part
[14:15] of God that he had deposited in them
[14:19] maybe we should look at that I'm getting
[14:21] a little bit ahead of myself but maybe
[14:23] we should look at that in Genesis
[14:25] chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord God
[14:29] formed man out of the dust of the ground
[14:32] and breathed into his nostrils the
[14:39] breath of life life did you know in
[14:46] Hebrew that word life is plural and it
[14:50] could read that the Lord breathed into
[14:52] Adam the breath of lives now did he have
[14:57] more than one life yes what are you
[15:01] talking about well by the breath of God
[15:04] Adam was given soulish life and spirit
[15:09] life the breath of lives God scooped up
[15:15] clay and gave him a body a fleshly
[15:19] earthly tabernacle or house or body of
[15:23] flesh but when he breathed into him the
[15:26] breath of lives he released into Adam a
[15:31] life that is soul soulish and a life
[15:37] that is spirit spiritual very very
[15:42] interesting thing when Adam fell he lost
[15:46] the ability to communicate with God from
[15:51] the realm of the Spirit I believe that
[15:55] by regeneration by salvation by
[15:58] accepting the blood of Jesus Christ and
[16:00] becoming born again like we read about
[16:03] in John chapter 3 that the potential to
[16:07] restore back our ability to communicate
[16:10] with God's Spirit to spirit
[16:13] potentially that has been renewed and
[16:17] many of us are walking in the lower
[16:20] levels of spirit life but God is calling
[16:25] us to come up higher revelation chapter
[16:28] 4 verse 1 tells us if there is a door in
[16:31] heaven that is open it was open to John
[16:34] and the voice said come up here John
[16:36] come up here a little higher I want to
[16:38] show you things that must be Hereafter
[16:41] now yes that was a personal invitation
[16:44] for John on the Isle of Patmos but I
[16:47] believe that by the Rhema by the Spirit
[16:50] word God is saying you are also given an
[16:55] invitation to come up through the open
[16:59] door and communicate with your Creator
[17:03] spirit to spirit what does that mean
[17:08] well it means that you don't receive it
[17:10] through the flesh through the five
[17:12] senses you don't receive it through the
[17:15] soulish realm because the soulish realm
[17:18] is like a filter it filters things out
[17:21] it it allows some things in it filters
[17:25] some things out so if we can communicate
[17:28] with God's Spirit to spirit and not just
[17:31] flesh to flesh or in the realm of the
[17:33] soul then we can have a pure word from
[17:39] God we can have the pure life of God
[17:43] being exercised in us somebody said what
[17:47] would be the benefit of that well I
[17:48] believe that there's coming a great
[17:50] change to the body of Christ we've heard
[17:54] about the translation the resurrection
[17:57] where our physical bodies are going to
[18:00] be changed
[18:01] corruption is going to put on
[18:04] incorruption remember and mortality is
[18:08] going to put on immortality at the sound
[18:11] of the great trumpet of God the shout
[18:13] will come and the great Trump of God
[18:16] will sound and we will be changed well I
[18:19] believe that I believe this physical
[18:21] body I believe there will be some who
[18:23] are alive and who
[18:25] remain at the time of the coming of this
[18:28] Resurrection period in other words I
[18:30] believe many will die people are dying
[18:33] every day they're going to their graves
[18:35] but I do not believe I want you to know
[18:37] friend that I do not believe that the
[18:40] grave is the end of the story for the
[18:43] redeemed no it's not the end for the
[18:47] unredeemed no it is not the end there is
[18:50] a life here after this life there is a
[18:54] judgment for those who have rejected
[18:56] salvation the salvation that has been
[18:59] provided from their very Creator can you
[19:02] imagine rejecting a gift from your
[19:05] Creator the one who made you the one who
[19:08] allowed you to have the breath of life
[19:10] you said well you're kind of a dumb
[19:13] preacher I am a product of a sexual
[19:16] union between my mother and my father
[19:19] absolutely you are there's no doubt
[19:22] about that
[19:22] but I want you to know the life that is
[19:25] inside of you the breath of life didn't
[19:27] come from mommy and it didn't come from
[19:29] daddy
[19:30] it came predestinated for you to you by
[19:35] your Creator it was his will that you be
[19:39] alive and if it had not been his will
[19:42] you couldn't have got here if you don't
[19:44] wanted to do you understand what I'm
[19:46] saying and he has provided for us a way
[19:49] that we can come into oneness with him
[19:51] we can come into union with him you
[19:54] remember the Lord Jesus I know I talk
[19:57] and preach with my hands I know that
[19:59] could be a little bit distracting but
[20:00] and I could promise you that I wouldn't
[20:02] do it but I wouldn't be able to keep
[20:03] that promise so I will I won't make it
[20:05] but try to hear what I'm saying remember
[20:08] when Jesus was accused when he was
[20:11] questioned about his relationship with
[20:15] the father
[20:15] he said when you've seen me you've seen
[20:18] the father
[20:19] because I and my father are one can you
[20:22] imagine what a oneness this was what a
[20:25] union it was and yet we read about in
[20:28] the Garden of Gethsemane we read about a
[20:31] time when the will of his father and his
[20:37] human
[20:38] we'll see even our Lord Jesus had a
[20:44] human will that realm of the soul that
[20:48] that that realm where we have a will
[20:54] never before do we read that the will of
[20:58] the Father and the will of Jesus the son
[21:02] were in conflict but in the Garden of
[21:05] Eden they were in conflict
[21:07] somebody said now that is strange well
[21:10] it's the Bible it's what the Bible said
[21:12] jesus prayed if it be possible let this
[21:18] cup pass from me that was his will that
[21:24] was the will that was coming out of his
[21:26] inner being that was his will the will
[21:28] of his flesh we could say he said if
[21:31] there's any other way to do it father
[21:33] let's do it that way but because he
[21:37] walked in such union and agreement and
[21:40] oneness with the father the prayer
[21:42] didn't end there
[21:43] by saying let this cup pass from me he
[21:46] went on to say nonetheless nevertheless
[21:48] not my will you see there were two
[21:52] wheels not my will but your will be done
[21:57] that's oneness what if I told you that I
[22:00] believe that God is calling believers to
[22:04] that kind of oneness that kind of place
[22:06] of communion and communication with the
[22:09] father again in this hour a oneness with
[22:13] the heavenly bridegroom the Lord Jesus
[22:15] Christ and the earthly bride those who
[22:18] are being called into this overcoming
[22:21] company of people you really believe
[22:24] that rather I do I believe that with all
[22:26] my heart
[22:27] and I believe that one of the ways that
[22:29] we're going to come into that change for
[22:31] our physical body to be changed at the
[22:33] sound of the trumpet and the shout and
[22:35] the descending all of this we read about
[22:38] in Thessalonians this physical change
[22:40] with where many are going to get up out
[22:42] of the grave with a changed body we read
[22:45] about I believe the change doesn't start
[22:47] body on the flesh and then move into the
[22:50] spirit man I
[22:51] the change the resurrection the rapture
[22:55] the translation whatever you choose to
[22:58] call it the kingdom coming doesn't
[23:01] matter to me your terminology I believe
[23:04] that that change to this physical body
[23:06] doesn't begin in the physical body it
[23:08] begins in the spirit I believe there
[23:11] must be a change in our spirit man and I
[23:16] believe that if we have been given
[23:18] senses five plus senses to communicate
[23:23] with the earthly realm then in our
[23:25] spirit our human spirit we must have
[23:30] also some senses of how we can
[23:35] communicate and be in communion and be
[23:37] in contact with our Father with the
[23:40] realm of the Spirit and when we exercise
[23:42] so spiritual senses when we learn more
[23:44] about them what they are how to yield to
[23:47] God in all things how to bring our flesh
[23:50] into submission how to cause our soul to
[23:54] find its proper place so that we don't
[23:55] live by the soul you see part of the
[23:58] soul there's a lot of emotion in there
[24:00] and we don't want to live by emotion we
[24:03] want to live by faith we can have
[24:05] affections we can be connected
[24:07] affectionately connected to things that
[24:11] may not be good for us and that's one of
[24:13] the ways our soul gets its information
[24:17] or gets its life we could almost say is
[24:20] through the affections and reasoning
[24:24] reasonings can affect the soul but we
[24:28] don't want to be led by reasoning we
[24:30] don't want to be led by imagination we
[24:32] don't want to be led by memories we want
[24:35] to be led by the Spirit of God from the
[24:38] spirit out you see we want to invite the
[24:42] Lord Jesus to come and regenerate
[24:46] totally completely renew revive
[24:48] resurrect our human spirit back to how
[24:53] it was in the beginning in the Garden of
[24:55] Eden when Adam was freshly created in
[25:00] the image of God and the spirit that he
[25:03] had was not just a
[25:05] human spirit as we know it today and and
[25:10] really that's a little ambiguous this
[25:11] human spirit what is it well you know we
[25:14] have lots of questions about it when we
[25:16] search the scripture but Adam spirit I
[25:19] can I can tell you more about what Adam
[25:22] spirit was like than I can mine and
[25:24] yours because we've got information
[25:26] clear clear information that Adams
[25:29] spirit in the beginning was God's Spirit
[25:32] it was God's breath he had in him the
[25:36] very life of God he lost it in the fall
[25:41] but by the born-again experience there
[25:44] is a regeneration of that spirit that
[25:47] was lost and by exercising by communing
[25:52] by worshiping by soaking in the presence
[25:56] of God we are exercising our spirit life
[26:00] bringing it back to a place where one
[26:03] day it will rule Jesus Christ the Holy
[26:08] Spirit of God will set on the throne of
[26:11] our spirit it will be renewed and
[26:15] rejuvenated and revived and we will live
[26:18] from the spirit life not from the
[26:21] soulish realm not from the fleshly realm
[26:24] our spirit my I tell you that makes me
[26:27] excited it makes me want to reach in we
[26:32] said that yet we read in Genesis 2:7 the
[26:35] Lord breathed into Adam the breath of
[26:37] lives the life of the soul the life of
[26:40] the Spirit he breathed into him and the
[26:45] Bible says that he was not made from
[26:47] clay he was made from dust and dust all
[26:52] these tiny tiny little particles when we
[26:54] look up dust it reminds us of the
[26:58] dependency that Adam had on his creator
[27:03] it reminds us that man was created to be
[27:07] dependent on God we were made to be
[27:12] dependent on our Creator but technology
[27:16] humanism our
[27:18] earthly knowledge education so many
[27:21] things have come in to our life to our
[27:25] mind that man has come to a place where
[27:28] hey I don't need God there is no God I
[27:31] don't need God if there was a God I
[27:33] would need him but I don't even believe
[27:35] there is a God we've got a theist we've
[27:38] got agnostics and you know that used to
[27:40] be extreme
[27:41] you know if someone said I'm an atheist
[27:43] or someone said I'm an agnostic that was
[27:45] extreme we thought they were just really
[27:48] out there almost like some people look
[27:50] at Christians but that has become a
[27:53] common thought it's common to meet
[27:57] people who say I don't believe in God or
[27:59] to meet people who have such a broad
[28:02] concept of God that it's that it can't
[28:05] be defined I want you to know my
[28:07] understanding of God can be defined in
[28:10] the beginning God created the heaven and
[28:13] the earth that is my concept of God
[28:17] Genesis 1:1 and John chapter 1 verse 1
[28:21] that says to us that that God and the
[28:25] word in the beginning was the word and
[28:28] the word was was God and the Word was
[28:30] God in the beginning was the word and
[28:34] the Word was God and then John 1:14 and
[28:38] the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[28:42] we beheld his glory the glory as of the
[28:44] only begotten of the Father full of
[28:46] grace and truth well my time is gone
