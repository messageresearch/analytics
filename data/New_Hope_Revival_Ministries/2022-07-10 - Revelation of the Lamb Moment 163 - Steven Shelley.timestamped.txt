[0:00] how do you and I think that we can get
[0:03] by in this last hour without a
[0:05] revelation
[0:10] [Music]
[0:13] able
[0:15] was a loving Shepherd
[0:17] cared for his sheep
[0:19] but there was one
[0:22] [Music]
[0:23] he had a pet lamb
[0:26] he had one that he loved above the
[0:28] others
[0:29] and when it come time to offer an
[0:31] offering to God
[0:33] he wanted to give God something that
[0:37] meant something to him Cain couldn't
[0:40] care less about the carrots he was proud
[0:43] of him because he'd done a good job
[0:44] growing them but I ever loved the slam
[0:47] this was the sweetest lamb the most
[0:49] special lamb the most beautiful eyes of
[0:52] any lamb that Abel had ever raised in
[0:56] his flock and when it came time to build
[0:58] an altar and offer a sacrifice to God he
[1:01] didn't want to give God just one of the
[1:03] crowd just one of the group he wanted to
[1:05] bring to God something that meant so
[1:08] much to him
[1:10] why would he do that
[1:13] why would he do that it's real simple
[1:16] Abel had a revelation
[1:19] that one day the blood of an innocent
[1:22] lamb was going to cry out on behalf of
[1:26] the sins of the entire world the Bible
[1:29] called him a prophet
[1:33] prophetic in the sense that he caught a
[1:36] revelation of how my Redemption was
[1:39] going to come
[1:41] and he was a type of what was to come
[1:45] the innocent spotless Lamb of God Behold
[1:49] the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin
[1:51] of the world out from the midst of the
[1:53] of the throne came a lamb as it had been
[1:55] slain from the very foundation of the
[1:58] world and Abel caught up
[2:01] [Music]
[2:02] oh
[2:05] Abel got
[2:06] [Music]
[2:10] English is my language of choice
[2:15] he got caught up
[2:17] in the glory of the Revelation and he
[2:21] said if my offering is going to be a a
[2:25] type a symbol of the offering
[2:30] if my little lamb is going to be a
[2:33] prophetic representation of the great
[2:37] lamb of
[2:40] of powerful
[2:42] then it must be the finest lamb
[2:46] the most beautiful lamb and it must be
[2:49] the one that means the most to me
[2:52] strips down a grapevine rips it down off
[2:56] of and he begins to make himself a
[2:59] little rope
[3:01] braids him a little rope and he ties
[3:04] that rope around the Little Lamb's neck
[3:07] and he begins to lead him over to the
[3:10] altar that he has built
[3:12] and he sits down around that Altar and
[3:16] he lays that lamb down and how many of
[3:18] you know if a little animal like that
[3:20] doesn't want to lay down it's going to
[3:21] try it's best to get up again
[3:23] and he just tried his best without being
[3:26] cruel you say cruel he's about to kill
[3:28] the lamb please understand
[3:33] if that lamb could no more redeem and
[3:36] cleanse Abel
[3:39] it's not that animal life that was going
[3:43] to bring able to complete Redemption but
[3:45] this was a shadow of what was to come
[3:48] under the law of Moses that provided a
[3:50] covering for sin that would later lead
[3:53] to a total remission of sin when the
[3:55] blood of the Spotless lamb of Calvary
[3:57] was shed you follow the type right
[4:00] he lays sits down and he lays out
[4:03] uh lamb down on the on the ledge or the
[4:07] edge of that altar there is no Smith
[4:10] there is no sharp knife just picks up a
[4:12] a jagged Rock
[4:15] and he says I've got to make this as
[4:17] quick
[4:18] and as painless as possible somebody
[4:21] said when you tell stories like that it
[4:22] turned my stomach I hope it turned your
[4:24] stomach so many ways
[4:29] I I do I hope I hope that you have to
[4:33] swallow
[4:35] before I'm through telling it
[4:37] because I want you to understand the
[4:40] magnitude of the Revelation that Mabel
[4:44] had received and that I wanted
[4:47] to do you and I think that we can get by
[4:49] in this last hour without a revelation
[4:52] [Music]
[4:54] how can we overcome without a personal
[4:57] revelation of the Lamb of Calvary and
[5:00] what he has done for us how can we live
[5:02] without the power of the Holy Ghost
[5:04] within us how can we keep moving on
[5:06] without total Deliverance when it's
[5:09] promised to us in the same sacrifice
[5:11] hmm
[5:12] [Music]
