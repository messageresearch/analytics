[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello there I'm pastor Stephen Shelley
[1:03] of New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:06] Station Alabama and once again today we
[1:09] are meeting in partnership with the
[1:11] gospel channel and I'm thanking God
[1:14] every day I pray for brother Eric
[1:18] Erickson and the staff of the gospel
[1:20] channel for a long time it has been a
[1:23] burden on my heart that the network not
[1:25] only sustained but that it grow and I
[1:29] believe with your prayer support and
[1:31] with your financial giving I believe
[1:34] that that is a great possibility that we
[1:37] will grow and that we will be able to
[1:39] reach out by satellite even into far
[1:43] other places around the world with this
[1:45] good news that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:49] yesterday and today and forever
[1:53] people he changes not and he is faithful
[1:57] in all of his ways what he has promised
[2:01] he will perform one of the things that I
[2:05] have learned in serving the Lord this
[2:08] many years is he may not come when you
[2:11] want him but he's right on time we used
[2:15] to have a precious sister in our church
[2:17] who's gone on to be with the Lord now
[2:19] and that was a song that she would often
[2:22] sing he may not come when you want him
[2:25] but he is right on time we learned that
[2:28] our timing is not always the Lord's
[2:32] timing seems like lately so many of you
[2:36] have reached out with your prayer
[2:38] requests and I just want to say thank
[2:41] you thank you for having confidence in
[2:44] us making us your prayer partner with
[2:48] the needs that you have and thank you
[2:51] for believing that God is able to meet
[2:55] your need I believe when you reach out
[2:57] that way I believe it is a sign that you
[3:02] believe that only God can make a
[3:04] difference in your situation I want to
[3:08] apologize to you because there are times
[3:12] that no one is in the office when you
[3:14] call but I want to assure you that your
[3:18] prayer requests what you leave on the
[3:21] answering machine is transcribed and it
[3:25] is immediately entered in to a database
[3:28] where I can look any time day or night
[3:32] wherever I am around the world and see
[3:36] your need and go to the Lord in prayer
[3:38] and I want to thank you for reaching out
[3:42] to us in that way and it does make us
[3:45] feel terrible that we don't have 24 hour
[3:48] a day staff but when we're in the office
[3:51] someone will take your call and if you
[3:55] receive the recording leave as much of
[3:59] your request as you want to is you feel
[4:02] comfortable with it's always good to at
[4:05] least get a first name and perhaps where
[4:07] you're calling from we don't always have
[4:10] to have the other details but it's just
[4:12] a blessing to us to know where you're
[4:15] watching and that you're receiving
[4:19] something we've even had correspondence
[4:22] from Italy and we're thankful that
[4:25] you're able to see the program Ireland
[4:28] across the beautiful British Isles what
[4:32] a blessing it is to have twenty
[4:35] four-hour-a-day
[4:37] Christian programming and I have
[4:40] confidence that God is using the gospel
[4:43] channel and will use it even more in the
[4:47] future as part of his endtime plan thank
[4:51] you for finding us on YouTube for
[4:54] visiting us on our website thank you for
[4:58] downloading the New Hope revival
[5:00] ministries app I'm watching those
[5:02] numbers increase every day and it is so
[5:05] encouraging to me that we are able to
[5:09] put such a resource in your hand where
[5:12] you have access anytime to the programs
[5:15] that we do in partnership with the
[5:17] gospel channel as well as many many
[5:21] other wonderful sermons songs and our
[5:26] new hope moments those little tidbits of
[5:30] inspiration and we just put together the
[5:34] staff did a new one for this week on
[5:38] worship and I have to tell you that it
[5:42] encourages me to know that my worship
[5:45] makes a difference
[5:47] worship is of course giving God honor
[5:52] and praise and love but we also become
[5:57] the beneficiaries when we enter into
[6:01] heartfelt praise and worship I've heard
[6:05] it said by many people through the years

[6:44] to read your emails we want to hear your
[6:47] prayer requests and we want to partner
[6:49] with you these are exciting times I mean
[6:54] that it's not just a line from me I see
[6:59] that there is tragedy on every hand here
[7:02] in our area just a few miles from my
[7:07] home we just recently had devastating
[7:11] tornados and 23 people including
[7:15] children lost their lives some of the
[7:18] most devastating storms that we have
[7:20] ever had in our area in my lifetime
[7:23] those tornadoes where they did the most
[7:26] damage and where lives were lost struck
[7:29] about 12 miles from my home but before
[7:32] that torn
[7:33] it was through it had swept a path of
[7:36] over sixty miles and at one point was
[7:40] less than three miles from my home four
[7:43] miles from the church where I'm sitting
[7:45] right now we experienced the marvelous
[7:49] grace of the Lord but our hearts have
[7:52] been broken for those who lost so much
[7:56] even in the midst of that kind of
[7:59] tragedy there has been such inspiration
[8:04] it seems like that if you can find a way
[8:09] to give God praise even in the bad times
[8:14] it releases something there was a
[8:18] precious precious little woman miss
[8:21] Ernestine who lost everything and
[8:26] sitting on the the slab of where her
[8:31] home had sat we later found out with a
[8:34] broken hip she was speaking to a loved
[8:39] one a grandson I think it was who was
[8:44] very concerned he was away at college it
[8:48] seems to me like I might have read that
[8:50] he was the first person in their family
[8:53] to go off to college like that I may be
[8:56] wrong but he was concerned and she was
[9:01] speaking to him on the phone and she was
[9:05] saying to him calling him by his
[9:07] nickname and saying you thank God you
[9:10] hear me
[9:11] you thank God and when she was told in
[9:16] this little video clip that her neighbor
[9:18] had also lost her home she said we have
[9:21] to thank God we have to give God praise
[9:24] seven members of that one family lost
[9:27] their lives but that little video of
[9:30] that precious mother grandmother went
[9:33] all over the world and her message was
[9:37] clear we've got to thank God we've got
[9:41] to give God praise and
[9:44] honor and glory even when the
[9:47] circumstances are dark when our pain is
[9:52] great and the loss is bigger than we can
[9:55] comprehend at the moment in all things
[9:59] oh I feel something when I say that in
[10:02] all things we must give thanks I'm sure
[10:07] that many of you will be familiar with
[10:09] the scriptures and the story from the
[10:11] Bible the son of David this son who was
[10:17] conceived in less than ideal
[10:20] circumstances a product of sin rebellion
[10:25] and he is near to death
[10:29] David is fasting and praying he won't
[10:34] even wash his face he is in supplication
[10:37] before the Lord calling for the life
[10:41] asking for grace and mercy to be shown
[10:45] to his son when a messenger a servant
[10:49] knocks on the door to tell David we are
[10:53] sorry but your son has slipped away he's
[10:58] gone the Bible tells us that David got
[11:02] up and washed his face and prepared to
[11:05] eat a meal and he said these most famous
[11:09] words these words have been spoken at
[11:13] grave sites all over the world in
[11:16] committal services when we are saying
[11:19] goodbye to loved ones the Lord giveth
[11:24] and the Lord taketh away blessed be the
[11:28] name of the Lord and I know that it's
[11:32] easy to make a statement like that when
[11:35] your heart is not broken but when your
[11:38] heart is broken when you have lost so
[11:42] much it becomes it's one of those what
[11:46] we have sometimes called a rubber meets
[11:49] the road
[11:49] when you are right in the middle of pain
[11:54] and you have lost so much
[11:57] in fact like miss Ernestine she didn't
[12:00] even know what all she had lost yet but
[12:04] what she knew was this I've got to thank
[12:08] the Lord he has spared my life he is a
[12:12] good god he is a faithful God he never
[12:17] makes a mistake
[12:18] we don't have to like everything that
[12:21] happens to us in life but we have to
[12:23] believe if we are truly a believer we
[12:28] have to believe that God can get glory
[12:31] he can get amazing results from
[12:36] something that looks absolutely so
[12:41] catastrophic so damaging life-changing
[12:47] that nothing good not one little ray of
[12:50] sunshine could come out of it but oh my
[12:54] in this local tragedy these storms that
[12:58] we're mentioning I have heard testimony
[13:01] after testimony of how people have come
[13:05] to be able to give God praise I heard of
[13:10] a family who lost a precious beautiful
[13:13] little girl literally snatched from her
[13:17] parents arms into the storm and in the
[13:21] in the funeral service stood a dad at
[13:26] the time of music when they were singing
[13:29] a song of praise to the Lord a week dad
[13:33] a trembling dad a heartbroken dad stood
[13:38] to his feet with his arms in the air
[13:43] praising God thanking God for the time
[13:47] that he had had with this precious
[13:49] daughter beside him also a mother
[13:53] thanking God saying whatever happens God
[13:59] is good and God is right and he will get
[14:05] glory for his name when I hear those
[14:09] testimonies
[14:10] it strengthens me it encourages me to
[14:14] keep moving forward and knowing that in
[14:19] the darkness there is some light faith
[14:23] in the Lord Jesus Christ I heard many of
[14:26] those loved ones interviewed survivors
[14:29] some of them of the storm and as they
[14:34] were being interviewed able to speak
[14:37] able to answer the questions some of
[14:41] them moments after things had settled
[14:44] down and there was that consistent theme
[14:48] that ran through all of those interviews
[14:52] how have you made it thus far how are
[14:56] you making it right now and so many of
[14:59] them said it is because of my faith in
[15:03] God I don't know how this is going to
[15:07] turn out I don't know how we're going to
[15:09] rebuild I don't know how we're gonna
[15:12] move forward without our loved ones but
[15:14] we have faith in the Living God
[15:18] oh my doesn't it make your heart break
[15:23] for those who have no such hope for
[15:27] those who do not trust that there is
[15:31] even a god and if they believe in some
[15:35] higher power they have yet to see that
[15:38] he is good
[15:39] let me decree to you let me declare to
[15:43] you today around the world whether
[15:47] you're watching this on the television
[15:49] or whether you're streaming and on the
[15:51] internet watching it on youtube or the
[15:54] app however I'm coming to you right now
[15:57] let me declare that God is a good god
[16:02] and he is a faithful God and he will be
[16:08] as close to you in your good time in
[16:12] your hard time in your painful time as
[16:16] you will allow him to be it's so tragic
[16:19] that's so often when people are hurting
[16:22] they push ever
[16:23] in one away including God I want to pray
[16:28] today for you I want to believe that
[16:31] whatever you are going through right now
[16:33] that you will somehow find grace find
[16:38] strength to allow the Lord to draw close
[16:42] to you he wants to draw you if you can
[16:46] possibly find the courage to run to him
[16:50] let me encourage you to do that because
[16:52] there is no more faithful friend than
[16:56] the Lord Jesus Christ he has been a
[16:59] friend to me my parents divorced I think
[17:04] I've shared some of this with you when I
[17:06] was just five years old and I have grown
[17:09] up without the consistency of a father
[17:11] in my life but I want you to know I have
[17:15] had a father I've had a good good
[17:19] Heavenly Father who has stood by me when
[17:22] I was at my best and who has refused to
[17:28] leave me when I was at my worst if you
[17:32] don't know that God you've got to know
[17:34] him you need to know him you must know
[17:37] him I don't know how you've made it this
[17:40] far without him but I'm telling you you
[17:43] have suffered needlessly alone there is
[17:48] no reason for any of us to suffer alone
[17:52] because we have had a suffering Savior
[17:57] as I say a prophesied he was wounded not
[18:02] because of anything that he had done
[18:04] wrong himself but he bore my sin he
[18:10] became sin on my behalf wounded for my
[18:13] transgressions bruised for my iniquities
[18:17] the chastisement of my peace was upon
[18:20] him and with His stripes I can be healed
[18:25] that's the love that God has for you
[18:28] today if you have never invited the Lord
[18:31] Jesus Christ into your life if you have
[18:35] never
[18:36] pended of your sins by saying God I am
[18:40] sorry for the life that I have lived
[18:43] apart from you I have most surely
[18:47] transgressed all of your laws broken
[18:50] your Commandments lived for myself and
[18:54] for my family but not lived for you
[18:58] forgive me of my sins I want the blood
[19:02] that you shed at Calvary to speak for me
[19:07] I want that blood to cover my iniquity I
[19:11] want that blood to cover my pain my
[19:15] sorrow my heartache my bitterness my
[19:18] envy whatever it is that it's consuming
[19:23] me I feel like there are people watching
[19:24] this program today and please understand
[19:30] my expression it is as though you are
[19:33] being eaten from the inside out the
[19:37] problems of sin the effects of your pain
[19:41] has become like a cancer emotionally and
[19:44] you're being destroyed from the inside
[19:47] out and it does not have to be so I tell
[19:53] you in the name of the Lord it does not
[19:56] have to be so you don't have to live a
[20:00] miserable life no matter what your
[20:03] circumstances are because there is a
[20:08] love that conquers all the love that God
[20:13] has for you how do you know preacher
[20:15] that God loves me because I believe his
[20:18] word and because I have watched him
[20:21] through the years
[20:22] love the unlovable in fact he has loved
[20:27] me in some of my unlovable moments but
[20:31] there are some of you who have really
[20:34] never lived a life that was pleasing to
[20:38] him or according to his word and even in
[20:42] that rebellion he loved you and he has
[20:46] kept you from things perhaps that you
[20:50] are naughty
[20:50] aware of to bring you forward to a
[20:54] moment like this when you would be able
[20:57] to surrender your will that's the
[21:00] hardest part it's really not that hard
[21:04] to believe in a living God there's no
[21:07] other explanation for where we are today
[21:10] I cannot possibly believe that if things
[21:16] are left alone by themselves they
[21:19] improve I have to believe what I have
[21:23] observed in my own life if you don't
[21:27] maintain it it deteriorates the world
[21:32] that we live in as sick as it feels
[21:34] sometime we have seen such advances in
[21:39] technology in medicine in in the ability
[21:44] of man and woman to live longer than
[21:46] they have ever lived before I believe by
[21:48] a knowledge imparted by God I believe
[21:53] okay if you want to believe in a Big
[21:56] Bang as the origin for the earth I can
[21:59] go along with that with you as long as
[22:03] you see it this way I believe that God
[22:06] spoke that created the exposure
[22:10] necessary to create the world that we
[22:14] are living in this earth as we know it
[22:18] is here by the spoken word of God that
[22:23] creative word that came out of his mouth
[22:26] that's why we're where we are today and
[22:31] he keeps us and strengthens us and
[22:36] watches over for God so loved in this
[22:40] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[22:42] if you understand the scripture that
[22:45] means that God Himself condescended
[22:49] stepped out of eternity and into a body
[22:52] of flesh in a dimension of time that he
[22:57] could minister the love of the Father
[22:59] and demonstrate and display
[23:03] there is a better life oh yes there is a
[23:08] better life so if you have never invited
[23:12] the Lord Jesus into your life to forgive
[23:15] you of your sins to wash you in his
[23:18] Precious Blood I want you to do that now
[23:22] I believe that God is giving you an
[23:26] opportunity to call on him right now it
[23:29] doesn't have to be a churchy prayer it
[23:33] doesn't have to be a poetic prayer you
[23:36] can just pray god save me I'm lost I'm
[23:42] in trouble
[23:43] I have little hope and I need you you
[23:48] mean to tell me that God would respond
[23:51] to a prayer like that absolutely all I
[23:54] want you to know that religion has
[23:57] complicated our approach to God and the
[24:01] church has often told us we have to jump
[24:03] through this hoop and we have to perform
[24:06] this ceremony in order to approach God
[24:10] well I want you to know that the God
[24:12] I've given my life to the Savior who is
[24:15] such an important part of my life it's
[24:18] not requiring me in my moment of need to
[24:23] take out a paper and and and tick off
[24:26] the different points of of protocol he's
[24:30] as close as the mention of his name
[24:33] if all you knew to do was Jesus have
[24:38] mercy on me he will it's that simple
[24:43] then you say well then I I would have to
[24:46] live a different life yes and you can't
[24:48] do that alone you can never get good
[24:53] enough by yourself
[24:55] that is why he has offered you his
[25:00] righteousness his holiness his
[25:04] perfection when we invite Jesus into our
[25:08] life and we surrender our will we quit
[25:12] fighting against God's will for
[25:14] us he gives us his righteousness his
[25:19] holiness his perfection and he gives us
[25:24] strength and power and grace to walk in
[25:28] what he has provided I'm telling you the
[25:32] blood of Jesus and the grace of God has
[25:35] provided everything you need not only to
[25:39] secure a home for all eternity in the
[25:43] presence of God but he has provided what
[25:46] we need in this hour to get through the
[25:49] kind of life the kind of world that
[25:52] we're living in today where there is so
[25:55] much hate there is so much prejudice
[25:57] there is so much misunderstanding and
[26:00] things seem to be getting worse
[26:04] immorality worse absolute rebellion
[26:10] against how God has created us and what
[26:15] His Word has instructed us and it gets
[26:19] darker and it gets bigger and it gets
[26:22] bolder every day but in that confusion
[26:27] and in that chaos there is hope hope is
[26:34] found in a relationship with Jesus
[26:38] Christ I want to pray with you right now
[26:41] this is an entirely different order for
[26:44] our program but I want to pray for you
[26:46] right now
[26:47] and I want to believe that if you
[26:50] willfully surrender your heart to him
[26:53] that you will take it by faith it's not
[26:58] going to be by a feeling I hope that
[27:01] when you sincerely pray you will feel
[27:04] better but if you should feel no change
[27:08] that's when your faith has to begin to
[27:11] work right away there may be no
[27:14] honeymoon period for you you may have to
[27:18] apply your faith today you may have to
[27:21] believe that though you don't feel it it
[27:23] different and nothing looks much
[27:25] different you may have to
[27:27] leave that it is different simply
[27:30] because God's Word said so because you
[27:34] have chosen to make Jesus the Lord of
[27:37] your life pray with me right now would
[27:40] you Father we come to you in the name of
[27:43] your son Jesus Christ we are so thankful
[27:47] and so grateful for your life the life
[27:51] that you lived for us the death that you
[27:54] died for us and the resurrection that
[27:58] you stepped up into for us we are so
[28:02] thankful that you have paid the price
[28:05] for all of our sin for all of our
[28:08] iniquity for all of our transgression
[28:11] and we repent right now we have been
[28:15] wronged
[28:15] we have been rebellious we have chosen
[28:19] our own life but today Lord we want to
[28:23] acknowledge that you are Lord of all we
[28:28] want to make you the director of our
[28:32] footsteps we want you to help us because
[28:37] we are needy but we want to serve you
[28:40] because you are worthy Lord I pray that
[28:45] whatever binds people's lives whatever
[28:50] spirits seem to control them keep them
[28:54] in rebellion and perversion I pray today
[28:57] in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[28:59] Christ even Yeshua our Messiah that
[29:03] those spiritual powers of darkness will
[29:07] be broken that lives will be set free
[29:12] that every hindering spirit would be
[29:16] driven from their life and that they
[29:18] would emerge born again born anew even
[29:25] as you spoke to Nicodemus telling him
[29:29] that he could not enter a second time
[29:30] into his mother's womb he was to be born
[29:34] of the Spirit I pray right now that men
[29:37] and women will be born of the
[29:40] spirit as they ask you invite you to
[29:44] come into their life in the precious
[29:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we take
[29:51] you at your word and we call it done and
[29:54] we express our love for you Lord if
[29:59] there are those who prayed this prayer
[30:00] with me they're going to need you
[30:03] they're going to need your help they're
[30:06] going to need your direction and I ask
[30:09] you to come alongside of them now let
[30:13] them feel and more importantly let them
[30:16] know that they can be and they are a new
[30:20] creature today because they have
[30:23] surrendered their will and they have
[30:26] been washed in the atoning blood of
[30:29] Jesus Christ we ask these things in that
[30:32] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:35] amen and amen if you prayed that prayer
[30:40] with me I would very much like to know
[30:42] it you may call the prayer line you can
[30:45] send an email you can message us and let
[30:48] us know you can visit us on Facebook
[30:53] even let us know that you prayed this
[30:57] prayer because I want to have our
[30:59] intercessors our prayer warriors praying
[31:02] because it won't be easy this conversion
[31:06] this this experience with God is costly
[31:10] because all of Hell wants to keep you in
[31:15] a rut I tell you the devil will never
[31:18] just lay over and play dead and let you
[31:22] and I live a victorious glorious life in
[31:25] Jesus Christ he will as I say sometime
[31:28] huff and puff and try to blow the house
[31:31] down every day but greater is he that is
[31:35] now in you than he that is in the world
[31:38] I want to speak to Christians to those
[31:42] of you who have given your life to the
[31:44] Lord you have surrendered to the Lord
[31:47] and and yet you are not finding the
[31:51] grace to live a life
[31:54] victory you feel bound you feel
[31:57] oppressed you feel tormented I want you
[32:02] to know you must not give up you must
[32:06] keep pressing in to Christ every answer
[32:12] to every problem the direction for every
[32:16] situation that you face right now is
[32:18] only found in knowing him the answers
[32:24] can be found by the spirit in the Word
[32:28] of God this precious book that he has
[32:31] given us so I want to pray for your
[32:34] encouragement today I want to believe
[32:37] that God will inspire you I pray that
[32:42] you'll hear the little testimony of this
[32:46] precious grandmother loosing everything
[32:49] and yet encouraging everybody around her
[32:52] and now she's encouraging the whole
[32:54] world by video
[32:55] thank God honey give God thanks and I
[33:01] want to inspire you with that today I
[33:03] want you to know that there is great
[33:07] deliverance in giving God thanks in
[33:11] maintaining an attitude of gratitude by
[33:16] finding the God in every dark situation
[33:21] he's there he's there we used to sing a
[33:25] hymn when I was young standing somewhere
[33:28] in the shadows you'll find Jesus I
[33:32] remember one time a dear old brother was
[33:34] offended by that song he said what do
[33:37] you mean Jesus standing in the shadows
[33:41] Jesus is light and wherever light light
[33:45] is where Jesus is light he is so he's
[33:48] never standing in the shadows now I had
[33:51] to read the words of the song to the
[33:53] brother and let him know that there are
[33:55] times that he is not front and sinner
[33:58] there are times that he is standing back
[34:02] allowing us to continue sometimes on a
[34:06] course
[34:07] that is not best for us but he is
[34:10] patiently waiting he is a friend that
[34:14] sticketh closer than a brother and if
[34:17] you are willing to call him forth out of
[34:20] the shadows out of that place of sort of
[34:25] withdrawing for a span of time and
[34:29] allowing us to see what a mess we can
[34:33] make without his help all we have to do
[34:36] is invite him back standing somewhere in
[34:38] the shadows you'll find Jesus he's a
[34:41] friend who always cares and understands
[34:46] when you need him call on him so I want
[34:49] to pray again I want to pray for every
[34:52] Christian fighting this good fight of
[34:54] faith you have been through some stuff
[34:58] you are fighting depression oppression
[35:01] discouragement I want to ask the Lord
[35:04] today to give you great grace and
[35:08] strength let's pray together father we
[35:11] approach you again in the mighty name of
[35:14] the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:16] this time I'm pray for my brothers and
[35:19] sisters Lord those who have trusted you
[35:23] with their life some of them having
[35:25] called on your name 3040 years ago but
[35:30] the circumstances of their life have
[35:33] pressed the Miam and the enemy has
[35:36] brought a wave of discouragement against
[35:38] them and so today I join my faith with
[35:43] theirs today virtually we become prayer
[35:47] partners I'm on one side of the pond and
[35:52] they are on the other
[35:53] but today Lord we recognize there is no
[35:57] distance in prayer so we pray right now
[36:01] you are the glory and the lifter of my
[36:04] head you are the glory and the lifter of
[36:07] their heads so I ask you to come to
[36:11] their rescue I pray for inspiration and
[36:16] anointing to be upon them today
[36:19] to give God thanks to give you praise to
[36:22] give you honor and glory even in this
[36:25] time of uncertainty for Lord I have
[36:28] watched you raise us up when we came
[36:31] back to praise I have watched you raise
[36:35] us up out of the dark places when we
[36:37] begin to thank you for the faithfulness
[36:39] that you have shown in our lives I pray
[36:43] right now that you would touch and
[36:46] encourage the believer in the name of
[36:49] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and
[36:52] amen
[36:53] I'd like to hear from you I'd like for
[36:56] you to let us know that you're taking
[36:58] God today at his word you're going to
[37:02] accept and receive his encouragement
[37:06] open up your Bible and ask the Lord to
[37:08] speak to you from his word I recently
[37:12] told our church that it ought to almost
[37:15] be illegal to open up the Bible without
[37:18] prayer just whisper a quick prayer I'm
[37:22] going to read the word today Lord I'm
[37:25] looking to your word would you direct me
[37:28] would you reveal your word to me I don't
[37:32] want to just read as a discipline I want
[37:35] to read even as an act of worship and I
[37:39] want to approach your word knowing that
[37:43] you've got answers for every question
[37:45] that I have so take this encouragement
[37:49] from the Lord and go forward he is a
[37:53] savior he is an encourage or he is a
[37:56] healer if you are sick in body today he
[38:00] paid the price
[38:01] he knows how there is nothing too big
[38:06] for God to heal it can be something as
[38:10] simple as an ingrown fingernail or as
[38:15] severe as cancer and I have seen the
[38:20] Lord I wished I could tell you that I
[38:23] have always watched him reverse every
[38:27] disease
[38:28] and he'll every person that we ever
[38:31] prayed for but I can't say that I
[38:34] believe God heard the prayer I believe
[38:38] that God moved because we prayed in many
[38:42] many ways but there are times that God
[38:45] has a plan he wants to get glory he
[38:49] wants to bring other people to salvation
[38:51] through the attitude through the
[38:54] approach that a believer has Paul and
[38:58] Silas sang praises not licking their
[39:03] wounds but giving God praise in spite of
[39:07] their hardship we have so many glorious
[39:10] examples in the Bible and I want you to
[39:13] know that to the righteous death is not
[39:18] the end
[39:19] as the Lord calls us and we make that
[39:23] transition we make it into an eternity
[39:27] with him it is a healing it is certainly
[39:33] the end of a chapter on earth and the
[39:36] beginning of stepping out of the
[39:40] dimension of time into the dimension of
[39:42] eternity you really believe that yes I
[39:45] really believe that there is more for us
[39:48] over there than there is over here if we
[39:52] can just keep pressing toward that
[39:55] praising the Lord as we go but because
[39:59] I've lost loved ones to death that I
[40:02] asked the Lord to heal it doesn't make
[40:05] me doubt it doesn't cost me not to pray
[40:08] for healing because I have seen God even
[40:13] raised the dead that's the god I serve
[40:16] I've seen cancers tumors fall off of
[40:20] people's bodies blind eyes open deaf
[40:24] ears unstopped I've seen the crippled
[40:28] get up and walk again those paralyzed
[40:32] even from a broken spine I've seen the
[40:36] Lord reverse every decree of death
[40:39] against someone's body and give them
[40:42] glorious healing so I know yes I know
[40:46] that he is a healer and so if things
[40:49] don't happen every time the way I would
[40:52] like to see them happen I can't lose my
[40:55] faith I'm speaking to someone right now
[40:59] you didn't get the answer you were
[41:01] looking for and it has really thrown you
[41:05] for a loop but I want to encourage you
[41:08] keep believing go to God with the next
[41:13] situation don't allow something that
[41:18] didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
[41:20] turn out hoped it would turn out needed
[41:23] it to turn out don't allow that to keep
[41:27] you from believing again God always has
[41:31] a sovereign plan well he had one today
[41:35] because I had no idea I have a message
[41:39] that I wanted to bring and I had no idea
[41:42] that God was going to turn this around
[41:44] to speak to you so directly and offer
[41:48] prayer but I feel like we should pray
[41:50] now for those who need healing he is
[41:53] that healer oh my I've seen his healing
[41:58] hand in my own body how he has brought
[42:02] me through confounded even the doctor at
[42:05] times I've had the doctor look at me and
[42:09] pronounce something over my life and my
[42:13] doctor knows I'm a believer and he has
[42:16] looked at me and said all I'm doing is
[42:18] giving you something to go pray about I
[42:20] know you're not going to do everything I
[42:23] tell you but I know you'll take this to
[42:25] God in prayer and I do and he's a healer
[42:28] oh my he's a healer I've got a church
[42:32] full of people who know the healing
[42:35] power of God I want to pray for you
[42:38] right now reach your faith toward the
[42:42] Lord let's agree this is not about me
[42:46] praying for you and you just receiving
[42:48] this is about us believing together
[42:51] when two or more agree as touching on
[42:56] any one thing there's such power in that
[42:59] agreement of faith so let's believe
[43:01] right now father we come in the name of
[43:04] the Lord Jesus Christ to ask for healing
[43:08] to ask for deliverance of every symptom
[43:13] Lord we have at times been disappointed
[43:17] with what has happened in our body
[43:21] waiting for healing the enemy trying to
[43:25] keep us from believing but today we
[43:28] declare that you are Jehovah Rapha the
[43:32] Lord our God who healeth all of our
[43:35] diseases you are the suffering Savior
[43:38] who paid the price with your own body
[43:42] stripes on your own back for healing and
[43:45] in the name of Jesus and in the
[43:48] authority of our Messiah we just come
[43:51] against disease and we come against
[43:54] infirmity and we come against all those
[43:57] symptoms that that try to harass us and
[44:01] Lord we ask for healing to be manifested
[44:04] we pray right now for those suffering
[44:06] with high blood pressure and those
[44:08] suffering with sugar diabetes and those
[44:11] who are suffering with with with such
[44:13] swelling and water retention in their
[44:16] body we pray right now for those who
[44:18] suffer with migraine headaches but lord
[44:22] headaches these headaches can be so
[44:24] severe but you are the healer we pray
[44:28] for those who have gotten bad reports
[44:31] from the doctor some of them pronouncing
[44:35] a sentence of death and yet Lord we know
[44:38] that we can live until you get ready to
[44:42] call us so we ask right now that there
[44:45] would be a manifested healing in the
[44:48] body of the believer right now
[44:50] hallelujah that you would turn this
[44:52] thing around for the glory of God for
[44:56] tumors to disappear we ask right now in
[45:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may
[45:04] they sure
[45:04] away and disappear and be gone because
[45:09] you are such a good god and a faithful
[45:12] healer
[45:13] we just believe Lord right now even for
[45:17] those who are watching this program who
[45:20] have loved ones in the hospital we pray
[45:23] that you will strengthen their faith and
[45:26] that you will give them courage to go to
[45:28] that hospital and lay hands on their
[45:31] loved ones and ask for this same healing
[45:35] blessing may they be used as ambassadors
[45:38] of your healing virtue we ask this in
[45:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua
[45:45] our Messiah he men and a man I believe
[45:50] and there's one step I think you cannot
[45:53] skip I want you to give God praise I
[45:56] want you to thank him well I'm
[45:59] embarrassed to do that don't you be
[46:00] embarrassed even in your own home to
[46:05] lift up your hands and say Lord thank
[46:07] you for healing my body I take you at
[46:09] your word I believe that I am healed
[46:13] because your word says that you are the
[46:16] healer and I am tapping into that and I
[46:19] want to thank you and praise you and
[46:21] glorify your name if I would have had
[46:27] the opportunity to move into my text
[46:29] I'll do that the next time we meet I was
[46:32] going to talk about a change we know
[46:37] that there must be a change coming I
[46:41] believe that God is more able to execute
[46:45] change in our lives then than anything
[46:50] else the Lord has been talking to us in
[46:54] our group our church community about a
[46:58] new season upon us God is such a caring
[47:05] and loving God on an individual basis he
[47:10] doesn't just love us as a nation or love
[47:12] us as a church group he loves us as
[47:15] individuals and there are things
[47:17] every one of our lives there are things
[47:20] in every one of your lives that God
[47:23] wants to bring change about the the
[47:28] faith having the faith is so important
[47:33] faith is the substance of things hoped
[47:36] for and the evidence of things not seen
[47:39] if we can see it it doesn't take faith
[47:44] when we are believing God we are
[47:47] reaching into that unseen realm and
[47:49] pulling the answer back pulling the
[47:53] result back knowing that God is one who
[47:59] can I mean change things even suddenly I
[48:03] believe that God wants you and I to be
[48:07] the change I believe that we are called
[48:11] and appointed to be agents of change in
[48:16] fact I believe that it is part of our
[48:20] ministry as believers we have a
[48:25] priesthood ministry and part of that
[48:28] priesthood ministry is to speak life
[48:32] it's easy to speak death it's easy to
[48:36] speak judgment but it takes some grace
[48:40] it takes some help from the Lord to
[48:44] speak life into situations again that
[48:50] look so unchangeable impossible we have
[48:57] been looking at God's Word and examining
[49:00] the importance of walking in the right
[49:04] season knowing what season you're in
[49:08] what God wants to do for you in this
[49:12] particular season and then asking for
[49:16] his anointing to be upon you in your
[49:19] life his fresh oil to be upon you as you
[49:24] walk out what it is that God would have
[49:27] you to walk out right now I hope my
[49:29] language is not good
[49:31] using to you because the scripture is
[49:33] clear everything has a season
[49:36] Ecclesiastes chapter three verse one
[49:38] says for everything there is a season
[49:42] and a time for every purpose under
[49:46] heaven he goes on to say a time to be
[49:50] born and a time to die a time to plant
[49:53] and a time to pluck up that which is
[49:56] planted a time to kill and a time to
[49:59] heal a time to break down and a time to
[50:02] build up a time to weep a time to laugh
[50:05] a time to mourn it goes on everything in
[50:08] our life has an appointed time and the
[50:12] only thing that helps us synchronize
[50:16] synchronize our lives the only thing
[50:21] that helps us synchronize our lives to
[50:25] that timing or season or purpose of the
[50:28] Lord is prayer walking in prayer I've
[50:33] had people ask me you preach so strongly
[50:36] brother Shelly on the sovereignty of God
[50:40] doesn't that negate the need for prayer
[50:43] oh absolutely not because prayer is not
[50:47] about getting God to change his mind
[50:51] prayer is about discovering what is on
[50:56] the mind of God to discover his thoughts
[51:01] now I know what this situation is making
[51:04] me feel and I know what I'm thinking
[51:07] going through this trial but I would
[51:10] like to discover what God's thoughts are
[51:13] Lord what are you thinking about where
[51:16] I'm walking right now and that is what
[51:19] prayer helps us to do to align ourselves
[51:24] first of all we're saying God I trust
[51:27] you I trust you no matter how it feels I
[51:32] trust you but I would like to know a
[51:35] little bit about what this is about
[51:36] could you just give me a clue what
[51:40] what's going on so that I can pray more
[51:44] effect
[51:44] Tivoli and live more effectively
[51:47] according to your purpose and your plan
[51:50] that's what I'm talking about and and
[51:52] we've just got the tools we have got the
[51:55] tools prayer and praise and worship and
[51:59] approaching God's Word in a very mindful
[52:03] purposeful way like we mentioned a few
[52:06] moments ago this is what we need to help
[52:10] us discover the times and the seasons of
[52:14] the Lord in our life just one quick
[52:17] example you know if you are a gardener
[52:20] and we'll mention this again I'm sure
[52:23] when we meet again but there is a season
[52:26] to plant certain things not not
[52:29] everything is to be planted at the same
[52:32] time if you have all four seasons like
[52:37] we do in Alabama sometimes they're
[52:39] pretty short some of them but you you
[52:43] recognize that there are certain
[52:45] vegetables that thrive in the cold
[52:47] weather we we have cold weather but we
[52:52] don't have the the inches and inches of
[52:55] snow and and weeks and weeks of below
[52:58] freezing temperatures like a lot of
[53:00] places do so we are able to to plant
[53:04] vegetables at a certain time of the year
[53:07] and begin to harvest them in the in the
[53:09] fall in the autumn and up even toward
[53:13] the winter we can harvest for instance
[53:17] kale and broccoli and and what we call
[53:20] winter vegetables well you've got to
[53:22] plant them in the right season and then
[53:24] we have other summer vegetables like
[53:26] tomatoes and corn and cucumbers and we
[53:30] can't plant them at the same season that
[53:34] we plant winter vegetables we plant them
[53:36] as soon as the frost is over right about
[53:38] now we plant them in the ground because
[53:42] there is a certain period even the
[53:44] little pack of seed will tell you how
[53:46] long is the germination process by
[53:50] average and it will tell you and you've
[53:52] got to plant it according to that you
[53:55] you you don't put your to make
[53:58] seed in the ground today and expect to
[54:00] go tomorrow and eat tomatoes there is a
[54:04] process and it is so in the spirit the
[54:08] natural types the spiritual and we are
[54:13] to discover through prayer through
[54:15] devotion what season are we in you don't
[54:20] want to be trying to shovel snow in the
[54:22] summertime you want to be shoveling snow
[54:25] when there's snow to shovel so to speak
[54:27] you want to be enjoying the outdoors in
[54:31] the spring and in the summer and in the
[54:34] fall you want to plan your family picnic
[54:37] in the right season you don't want to
[54:39] plan your family picnic in January if
[54:42] there's three feet of snow on the ground
[54:44] so in the same way we would do it in the
[54:47] natural we learn to live life in the
[54:50] spiritual by asking the Lord where am I
[54:54] what is the next step well brother
[54:58] Shelly do we always get answers
[54:59] immediately to these questions no I wish
[55:03] so I wish we did but it doesn't always
[55:06] happen that way and again it's in that
[55:08] moment that trust faith has to kick in
[55:13] and be strong Lord I trust you and I'm
[55:16] just going to keep walking along until
[55:18] you answer until you show me what the
[55:20] next step is but I'll tell you what I do
[55:23] know change is inevitable and what
[55:28] you're going through right now you may
[55:30] feel like it is forever but I want to
[55:33] encourage you by saying this season
[55:36] whatever it is it didn't come to stay it
[55:40] came to pass and it will pass and you
[55:45] need to be able to make the change with
[55:49] it there is a time to pray asking God to
[55:55] do certain things in our lives and
[55:59] there's a time to thank him for what he
[56:03] has done in the last season and reached
[56:06] forward believing that we're on a
[56:08] journey we're move
[56:10] somewhere we're headed toward eternity
[56:13] and every step on the way matters every
[56:17] bend in the road every turn in the road
[56:19] matters so the main thing is to keep
[56:23] journeying on keep pressing on keep the
[56:28] faith let's encourage one another let's
[56:33] know that everything we need to fight
[56:36] the good fight of faith to persevere
[56:39] till the end we have it if we have
[56:43] received the truth of God's Word which
[56:48] enables us to be candidates to receive
[56:52] the Holy Ghost that is the very life of
[56:56] Jesus Christ living on the inside of us
[56:59] and I'm telling you we need that we need
[57:03] that when things are going good and we
[57:06] need that when things are going bad
[57:08] people ask the question do you need the
[57:10] Holy Ghost to go to heaven and I say you
[57:13] need the Holy Ghost to go to Walmart you
[57:15] need the Holy Ghost to go up on the high
[57:18] street and purchase what you need and so
[57:22] if you have never received the baptism
[57:24] of the Holy Ghost God's life inside of
[57:29] you I encourage you to keep praying and
[57:32] keep believing and I also encourage you
[57:35] to obey God's Word repent and be
[57:37] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:40] Christ for the remission of your sins
[57:43] and you will receive the gift of the
[57:46] Holy Ghost I believe that so the next
[57:49] time we're together we'll talk a little
[57:51] bit more about a season of change and
[57:54] we'll see where the Lord takes us god
[57:57] bless you I hope you're encouraged bye
[58:00] bye for today
