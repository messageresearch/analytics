other end of this camera we bless you in the name of the Lord asking the Lord to minister to the needs that you have brother Billy I believe you have a birthday today I know how old you are too just a month behind you that's the only one I know I didn't look I just happened to remember brother Billy because he's a month older than I am and uh I happen to remember the day and so if you have a birthday this week may the Lord bless you on your birthday I know there will be people that'll be needing to leave maybe before this service is over and we bless you in the name of the Lord and ask that the Lord will minister to you as you leave and wherever you go I know that Luke and Megan are going to be traveling after the service today to go toward Pennsylvania and we're going to be right behind them on Tuesday night after the service so we want to ask the Lord to give traveling mercies there's going to be a lot of traveling this week a lot of on the road and uh I was in opica on Thursday and those that were with me I said it isn't even Thanksgiving week and I already have traffic claustrophobia and so need a lot of Grace to get out on the road but I know the god of Grace who gives us what we need uh I thank you for your giving to this effort in India there was $1,000 that you gave and I bless you in the name of the Lord there was another thousand that came from out of town and so we were able to meet the the need that was there to put the doors and windows in that church building I've asked the brother for some before and after pictures which we'll try to take time to show you as we get them uh again if you have something that you desire to give we'll be sure that it gets to them we want to be busy about the Lord's work whatever he calls us to do um I thank you for your participation in the service today as you lifted your voice as the chofar was blown blown today it almost felt like a cork was blowed out the other end of something it was I felt the shift and so we're thankful to the Lord for that so uh let's go ahead and look to the word if you will let's stand together as you get your Bibles and turn to James chapter 1 would you help me to thank the Lord for our musicians we're so grateful for them brother Chad stepping up to lead in worship and brother Ben to lead the service we're grateful for everyone that steps in at the appropriate time the giftings that are in the house we're thankful for them James chap 1 verse one James the servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if you'll turn back a page or two Hebrews chapter 12 verse one 2 and three wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest you be wearied and faint in your minds let's pray before you're seated father how grateful we are to be gathered once again in your house with Saints of like Precious Faith both here in the building and those that are streaming this service some Lord that may watch on the archive I pray God that you will minister to each one the necessary Grace as we travel this journey we thank you Lord that you are among us today that you have uh done what you said you would do and now we're asking that you would let your an anointing Your Grace rest upon your servant as I try to deliver the word of the Lord that you've laid on my heart I pray that you will hide me behind the cross of Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ I'm asking you Lord that as I open my mouth that you would fill it and speak Words of Life to us today we will glorify you and Praise You Lord our pastor on a holiday along with his family family Lord workers of the Kingdom we pray your blessing on them asking that you would renew them and refresh them God I pray that you will pour into them what is needed for the future journey we'll give you praise and honor now for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen amen may the Lord bless you as you have your seat today I would like to read these same passages if you will bear with me I would like to read both passages once again in the Amplified they give a few more words of amplification James chap 1 verse one James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes scattered abroad among the Gentiles in the dispersion greetings re joice consider it wholly joyful my brethren whenever you are enveloped in or encounter Trials of any sort or fall into various Temptations be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience but let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work so that you may be people perfectly and fully developed with no defects lacking in nothing now in the King James and also in uh the amplif ified the word patience I want you to hold on to that just a moment as we look to Hebrews chapter 12 again and read these three verses in the Amplified therefore then since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses who have borne testimony to the truth let us strip off and throw aside every incumbrance unne necessary weight and that sin which so readily deafly and cleverly clings to and entangles us and let us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the appointed course of the race that is set before us now I always like to remind us when we see the word word sin to remember how that brother Bram defined the word sin not only to miss the mark but he said the word sin is also unbelief all of those uh things that we classify under sin are only a part of our Lives because of unbelief verse two looking away from all that will distract to Jesus changing the focus of where we're looking looking away from all that will distract to Jesus who is the leader and the source of our faith giving the first incentive for our belief you didn't do it on your own right right you may think that you were seeking the Lord but I can't seek for him unless he's seeking for me so he's the one that gave the first incentive for our belief and it is also he is also the finisher bringing it to maturity and Perfection he for the joy of obtaining the prize that was set before him endured the cross despising and ignoring the shame and is now seated at the right hand of the Throne of God just think of him who endured from Sinners such Grievous opposition and bitter hostility against himself reckon up and consider it all in comparison with your trials so that you may not grow weary or exhausted losing heart and relx relaxing and fainting in your mind when you think about all that you have been through in all of your trials we're told that compared to what he went through that it's not even a good comparison all the humiliation that he went through when I think about Believers from past ages who appear in Fox's book of Martyrs and other writings and what they went through you may think that some of that is a comparison that that could be compared to what he went through but yet the Apostle Paul tells us that he went through all of this all that they went through was not enough to buy eternal life for you and for me no matter how much humiliation they went through no matter what they faced as their heads were chopped off as they were their bellies were cut open and salt was poured in there and they drew their last breath their lives were never their blood was never enough to buy my Redemption my eternal life it wasn't what they went through was awful and I'm thankful that God gave them the Grace under their part of that those four living creatures they were given the grace to be humiliated in that way and we're reading stories even today of what some of these uh people in Israel went through during that Massacre some of the stories that we're reading are the same kind of atrocities against the people of of Israel and but none of it could buy my Redemption there was only one that could buy my Redemption and that's the Lord Jesus Christ but there are two words here one is found in the book of James and the King James uses the word patience and that is the Greek word 5281 which means steadfastness constancy and endurance and then we read uh in in Hebrews 12:2 the word endured comes from the Greek word 5278 which has the same uh same kind of definition but what I wanted to say was the word patience in the Book of James there that we read in verses 1 2 and three the word patience is 5281 and 5281 comes from the word 5278 endurance in which Jesus the for the joy that was set before him endured he endured now all of this endurance uh it it takes a level of patience that when we started this journey we did not seem to have there are some people that have uh what seems to be more natur naturally patience for their fellow man and there are others who more naturally seem to have no patience for anything don't bother categorizing yourself and please don't categorize me let's lay all of that aside because we are all pushing pressing ing enduring with patience the race that is set before us and we've all failed all of us have failed we've had our moments where that we could be as patient as the day is long and there are other days where our patience somehow had hid in the closet and we didn't know where what we had yesterday it's nowhere near evident today it almost seems to come and go and even those that seem to be the most patient Among Us have days where they lose their cool and have no patience for anything or anyone one because we all have good days and we all have bad days yet the Holy Spirit by his word has called us to walk this race with patience to run the race with patience that is set before us to endure all the way to the end we look look in the Old Testament and we see that there were a group of people that were in bondage and Joseph prophesied to the people and he said you're going to be here in bondage 400 years we've already heard that but I want you to know that there's going to come a time when God is going to give you your release when he does he did not say if he does when he does when you get up and get out of here I want you to make sure that you do not leave my bones behind in Egypt years and years go by and the time comes for the Deliverance of the children of Israel now through all of the Deliverance the people have been working in slavery they're under Pharaoh's bondage and God start showing them signs and wonders how much time span be it between each of those uh signs and wonders I don't know the scripture doesn't tell us but the people watched as as the plagues came to Egypt and Goan was spared and the these plagues one by one were given upon the Egyptians until finally Pharaoh said take your people and go now you remember Moses came before Pharaoh time and again and there were times where that Pharaoh said you can go but leave your wives and your children in the TOS here finally Moses said when we leave we're taking everything there will not be one hoof that will be left behind and when the time came you know you got to remember it wasn't Moses that hardened Pharaoh's heart it wasn't even pharaoh by his own will that hardened his heart the Bible says the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart so when you're facing your your trials you be careful who you're slinging at because God has an ordained path for you because he knows what it's going to take to get you to the place where that you are perfect lacking nothing and what it takes for you is not the same as what it takes for me and what it takes for me is not the same as what it takes for you and now the people are watching all of these signs and wonders these beautiful things that God is doing to bring about the release of his people until Pharaoh had enough because it touched his house and Pharaoh said get out take what you need if you need anything you get it and go the interesting thing is that when Moses walked out and begin the journey with the children of Israel God let Moses know know that he was going to harden Pharaoh's heart again now I just wonder if I was in the middle of a trial and had this glorious Victory and God comes to me and says It's Not Over it's not over I've given you a great Victory but it's not over what would be our reaction Moses didn't throw up his hands and say okay then I quit may as well leave them here if it ain't over I'm just you know I I we'll try it again another day No Moses was watching the hand of the Lord in all of this as were the people of Israel so they're all gathered together and they're going out of Israel and God is think about the joy that is in these people's heart because they didn't hear the word of the Lord that Moses got right they didn't hear God tell Moses this ain't over I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart again none of them heard that they were just joyous because they're Laden down with all this Egyptian gold they have utterly Left Behind Devastation in the land of Israel and we're going forward to the land of promise that has been promised to us and none of them are watching where they're going they're not watching the path the they they don't have a GPS that they can look at and say hey Moses you uh you aren't doing a very good job of leading us to the promised land you look like you're taking us down to Waters that are uncrossable what is the matter with you Moses none of them had that ability they were in the joy of the moment of being freed slaves and as they're marching along going along they're riding on on a high and the people are living their best non-slave life just think about what theyve if if a man 40 years old had been had had been born in Goan and from his childhood he was a slave from the moment he was able to carry a bucket of water he was told he had to work and now all all through those years that he has been a slave and his hands are gnarled and calloused and he's been a bearer of burdens all these years and now it's the first day or the second day of release from captivity and he is living his best non-slave life nothing to do but pull the wagon carry the gold make sure the cows are being driven in the right spot to stay together as a group not paying attention that their leader is leading them right down into a place that God had designed for them so as they get down to this place where you have the Red Sea you have mountains all of the sudden they start recognizing that Pharaoh Pharaoh is coming up behind them and the accusations start Moses did you bring us out here because there were no graves in Egypt Moses did you bring us out here is this the way you're going to treat us now that we're out of Egypt you didn't think we were under enough slave labor there Moses didn't we tell you to leave us in Egypt just to leave us alone there was probably plenty of those voices back back in Egypt that said leave us alone because you remember when Moses came and said I'm here to lead God people out and Pharaoh said you got too much time on your hand i'm taking away your provision of straw you're going to have to go collect your own straw to still make my number of bricks that I need for the building of my city you got too much time on your hand and then the people got mad at Moses because now they got more work to do than they ever had before and they're not provided the things that they need and so they got mad at Moses then and now they're throwing it back up at Moses didn't we tell you to leave us in Egypt and just leave us alone that's what we do that's what we do when we're not running the race with patience and endurance the race that is set before us God wanted to show his mighty hand once again and he wanted to show them as he does us he overlooked their sin their unbelief he overlooked it because he wanted to show his hand to them again and he opened up the Red Sea and when he opened up the Red Sea he made the path for them to go across another great sign and wonder that God performed for them then when they got to the other side he let them see another great miracle when Egyptians were trying to chase after them and the Sea closed back down over them there was great shouting and dancing time of Jubilation on the other side of the Red Sea and the people saw that their slave masters were once in for all on the other side or they were drowned rather in the sea and they were shouting the Praises of God in Jubilation because God had drowned them in the sea the their enemies in the sea and now Moses begins to lead the people the Bible tells us that they went into the Wilderness and they encountered bitter water anybody ever encountered Bitter Water Mara and what is the first thing that the people do they Grumble against the leader they Grumble against Moses Moses sought the Lord on their behalf and God told him what to do a certain thing to throw in the water and the waters became sweet so there rest in beside the Sweet Waters of Myra now and and they're they're still people and God after they Camp a while there God begins to lead them again Into the Wilderness of sin and the whole congregation once again murmurs and grumbles against Moses and against Aaron and if if you had only left us to die in Egypt at least in Egypt we had bread at least in Egypt we had water we had meat to eat we were full we were able to eat until that we were full God gave them Mana God fed them he fed them what they needed to survive now I I just like to read from Numbers Chapter 11 veres 1-6 when the people complained it displeased the Lord and the Lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp and the people Cried unto Moses and when Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was quenched and he called the name of the place tabara because the fire of the Lord burned among them and the mixed multitude was among them fell austing and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely the Cucumbers the melons the leaks the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there's nothing at all beside this Mana before our eyes now what I want us to see here is that God brought them out by a mighty hand and when they were in captivity in Israel they were complainers and when they came out of Egypt by a mighty strong hand when things didn't go quite their way they were still complainers and when they complained to Moses that they didn't have anything to eat you should have left us in Egypt Moses called on the Lord and man the lord gave them Mana And Then There came the time when the Mana became a a just yucky to them they'd had enough of it and they cried to Moses again and it upset the Lord God and his anger was kindled and a fire went through and then there they they start talking about all of this stuff that they had in Egypt now I want to equate that to us when we run low on patience because God started us on a journey that was not going to be an easy Journey he never promised that to us he told us to come and follow him and that we could lay down our heavy burdens and we could take on his yoke and he said my burden is easy my yoke is light right the problem is so many times we took on his yoke and his burden but we go back and pick up our burden and we end up carrying more than one burden and a lot of Burden that we are not supposed to be carrying yet we carry it just the same and so we run out of patience because fiery Trials come our way because that we're in the wilderness and it seems like that Mana is not coming to us we're not getting the same nutrition from the word that we got at one time and we resort to throwing really in God's face felt better when I was over in Egypt you see this this is why people glamorized the sin that they were in before they left Egypt because they become weary in welld doing and they throw down what burden God gave to them and they go back to picking up the burden of Egypt because they lose patience with God and the race that he has set before us go back to to old paradigms that's what we tend to gravitate toward old paradigms old sinful habits old sinful nature we end up going back to it because we get weary in the race God lays this race before us he didn't force us but he called us amen and when he called us he called us with such a calling that he would provide every single thing for the journey that's right I believe that God would have provided for the children of Israel the Mana the food the water that they needed if they would have approached him with a right attitude sir he provided it just the same but he would have provided it all along the journey and so we're given this story of the children of Israel for example to us that as we watch them in their journeying through their Wilderness every time that something came up that they could not deal with they murmured and they complained they grumbled and they mumbled at Moses most of the time because Moses was the leader Aaron with him they murmured against both of these men and constantly they're murmuring against these men and God in his Mercy gave them what they needed now as the journey went on God said did for Moses to send spies into the land and we know how that ended up and and and as they came back and gave this evil report and the majority of them gave the evil report and only two gave an a report that it's a good land it's what God promised to us it's a land flowing with milk and honey but the voices of the denters grew loud and louder until the congregation grabbed hold of the murmuring and the complaining of those 10 that had an evil report and they latched on to it now you see why it's important who you fellowship with what you latch on to what you decide you want to listen to who you want to listen to even though it looks like that they have uh they have a a a Charisma about them that it looks like they're really the they're really the epitome of a great leader but yet they do not have the word for you for this moment but yet you gravitate or I gravitate toward it because it makes me feel better for the moment come on gravitate toward that start feeling the pull toward it and then people start sliding backwards and as we start sliding backwards we start reaching out for Egypt why do you think that you saw more people around what we call message why do you think that they celebrated Halloween you saw more pictures this year than ever why is that when people don't run the race with patience they start gravitating back toward Babylon when we don't run the race with patience and we feel like we're in a stuck place we feel like we're in a place where that we're not exactly moving forward and for whatever reason we can't hear from God at that particular moment why do we always reach back to Egypt come on why do we reach back to the things that we left behind why do we reach back to fil pornography why do we reach back to to Halloween and reach back to Christmas and reach back and back and back until the that we're bringing Egypt forward with us somewhere Egypt's still hanging on it was for the children of Israel sir when Moses was up in the mountain remember they brought the spirit of Egypt with them it was a mixed multitude and they grabbed a hold of all of the gold that they could carry out of Egypt now I know that it was for a purpose because God was going to Overlay everything in his in his temple with gold but because of the impatience of the people while Moses was in the mountain getting the word of the Lord the people were in the camp impatient on because Moses was in the mountain so long and they were stuck in one place it didn't seem like they were going anywhere and so they reverted back to Egypt oh yeah Aaron we need something to worship God doesn't seem to be around you know he Moses we don't know what happened to him he's been gone so long you know the the prophet died so many years ago and and and it just doesn't seem like things are happening the way they ought to be happening Moses is gone Aaron we we need something to worship we're seeing it we are seeing it in our day because people have become impatient with what God promised was going to be in the last day his soon and my soon are two different things do you know why that is his soon and my soon are two different things because I operate on time and God operates in eternity my life my span of life is but a blip to him but God is faithful and he is going to keep every one of his promises he is not going to let let you uh he's not going to let his bride be forsaken along the way he's going to keep every one of his promises and he's looking for people who will run the race with patience this race that is set before them and when it looks like that nothing is happening then it is important for us to look to the word and find our answers to look to the not revert back to Egypt Egypt has nothing for you see these people they they they were telling Moses we remember we remember the leaks and the garlics we remember the flavor of the food that we ate while we were in Egypt and and and our stomachs were were full of bread and but the didn't mention the slavery they were still in while their stomachs were getting full they only remembered because their stomachs were grumbling and their they they were uh growling that they wanted some food and so the only thing they could do was reach back to what they knew instead of looking to the one who had made the promise to them that they were going into a land filled with milk and honey and that he was going to take them through all the way through and that even though it looks scarce at the moment he was going to see them all the way through one of the things that leads us to be grumblers is unthankfulness right when we are not thankful for what we have you remember during peso Passover Dau it would have been enough this whole list of things if God would have did done this but not done this it would have been enough if he would have brought us out of Egypt but not given us the land of promise it would have been enough and all of these things that they go through and it's it's a thankful heart that God is looking for so that the promises can come to us and we have to be thankful for what we have at the moment and it may not look pretty at the moment but there's always something to be thankful for there's always something that we can thank the lord we can thank him that he brought us out of Egyptian slavery right we may not be where we want to be but thank God we aren't where we used to be I may not have attained everything that I desire to attain but I thank God that I've made some I've made some tracks I'm not where I used to be that's right I'm thankful for every word of Deliverance that he has given to me and I've taken a hold of it and I've chewed on it did I ever want to quit oh yes oh yes I've wanted to quit plenty of times not serving the lord I wanted to say bye-bye to some of us not because you'd done anything wrong to me but I was tired of the fight and I thought if I could get away from here that I'd be over the fight but when I belong to God and I belong in a certain place and I'm a part of the band of the army that is in a certain location to fight through certain things I may leave the location but my fight's not over the fight will never be over until I'm make that final Crossing and I'm just as well to be in my position and you in your position so that we can fight this fight together to see it all the way through maybe I'll be at a high and you'll be at a low and somehow i' be able to give an encouraging word to you to pull you along and perhaps the the journey will change and you'll be higher than I and I've at a low place you maybe outpace me and you can throw an encouraging word to me that's right we're going to fight this thing together we're going to run this race with patience that the this that is set before us now this there are so many things in this journey we we see in the message of the hour that brother brandham when he was explaining to the people about Divine Healing that he explained to them that the they may not see the evidence of their healing immediately and he explained to them even though it had not manifested to confess that it had it's good as done it's as good as done and he even in several places said keep saying it until you believe it if you don't believe it right now but you know it's in the word say it until you believe it and he used that all through that Divine Healing Ministry that God gave to him but it was for a greater expectation of a future generation that it was not going to be just for this outward body but it was going to be for the inner man that when we could look in the word and we could see that there there was a promise for the inner man that even if we could not wrap our mind around it we could take that word and declare it over ourselves with our mouth and that eventually our heart and our mind would believe it and we would see it come to pass we don't always operate that way we're getting better at it we're getting better at it we come together And We Worship the Lord and we lift up a praise to him as we did the today and and we we do that knowing that it was what he desires out of us that we would praise him with a loud voice and that we would clap our hands uh in a sound of Victory and there are many times where we clap our hands where that we don't feel victory at that very second yet the word declares it and we obey because it's what the word said and after a while if if you decide I am going to obey the word clap your hands oh ye people and Shout To God with a voice of Triumph now so many people I've watched it now Through The Years people have rather than saying amen have gone to clapping their hands this is not an amen the amen comes out of your mouth the amen comes by the way you live but the Bible says to clap your hands and Shout To God with a voice of Triumph that's right it's a combination of clapping our hands and and and you can watch people sometimes you can tell how uh how uh it's it's it's real obvious on videos you all do know we're on video right and sometimes the video captures us when everybody else is jubilant and they're clapping with all their might and somebody's doing this but if we'll clap our hands like we really mean it we may not feel it when we start but if our hearts are tuned toward the Lord that clap can become something just the same as when your voices were lifted when the when the chofar was blown and your voices were lifted and something moved in the atmosphere that is what can happen if we engage in what God has done for us and is doing for us we have all had and heard profound revelatory words through our through our uh existence through our Christian walk and God called us and he gave us salvation and we heard the when when we first heard that we could make Heaven our home and there was something that Drew us and we called on the name of the Lord and we didn't want to stop there but yet we heard that there was a baptism of the Holy Ghost that would give us power in the spirit and it would give us leadership along the way we kept pressing toward that and then after we received the Holy Spirit maybe there was a time where we didn't really feel like that initial time and we wondered God have you left me and and we just found ourselves reverting back to other things we've heard truths of how the Lord was going to touch us in our in our health with the Divine Way and how he was going to come in a completion with authority and the bride and the end time and how that she was going to have that authority to to speak missing limbs into existence that we're not there and we've heard these Revelations about uh what is written on the backside of the book and the revelation of the seven Thunders and we're still waiting and anticipating I believe that there are still things that the bride has yet to understand because I heard him say you wait until the revelation of those seven unknown Thunders that will be what will shake the bride into her position I'm I've not found it yet and we get impatient because we're not seeing what we want to see and I know that we ought to be in Revival every day of our life lives we ought to have that kind of an anticipation of what God's going to do but we are not there yet yet yet and I am not throwing cold water on us as a group of people no no no no because I see it all around the world all the little sneak peeks on streaming that I watch around the world I'm seeing the same thing people are looking for the manifestation of the sons of God James 1:3 again be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience so the trying of your faith is to bring out endurance which then brings Perfection and full development with no defects no defects so how can I overcome all of these things well I'm going to take you back to the Old Testament once again because every one of us have had highs and lows even the preachers for every level that God lets you step up what was it we used to hear new levels new Devils so every level you step up you are increasing fiery darts yet by the grace of God we have been given tools to overcome so in 1st Samuel 26 David is running from Saul 1 Samuel 27 David is still running from Saul and he ends up in the land of gath remember the giant that he fought Goliath of gath and David ends up running from Saul and going to the land of gath and there he dwelt for 16 months 1st Samuel 28 akish of the Philistines let David know that they're going to war and he expects David to help now just remind you this is the chapter where that uh Saul because God has withdrew himself from him Saul goes to the witch of Endor to try to get some help to know how to take his next step that is what happens to us when we do not listen to the Lord and it's what happens to us when we find ourself and we can't hear we revert to old ways now when he consulted This Witch Samuel let him KN know what was about to happen in the battle 1st Samuel 29 David goes out to the battle with the Philistines but he is dismissed can you imagine David has fought against the Philistines he comes back to the he comes back to the uh the camp and the women start saying after him Saul has killed his thousands but David has killed his 10 thousands I guess it would make Saul pretty mad but here David is with the Philistines going out to fight but the Philistines somehow recognize who he is and they say isn't this the guy that they were singing about something along the lines of Saul killed his thousands and this guy killed his 10,000s I'm not so sure that we want him fighting with us because he might turn on us and they sent him back to the camp and when 1st Samuel chapter 30 when David gets back and his men they returned to ziklag now remember in ziklag David lived with his men and they had their wives and there were children and so forth and they had houses and when they he and his men got back to ziklag they found that their wives and their children had been taken away and the houses had been burned now I find it very interesting if you remember when Saul was told to go and kill all of the amalekites and Sam came to Saul and said Saul what is this that I hear the blading of the sheep and Saul says well the people wanted all of that to be able to sacrifice to the lord it's just the animals and I've also spared King AAG but everybody else I've killed and so it is very interesting when when you get to 1st Samuel chapter 30 and you find out who burned ziklag the amalekites Saul I thought you said you took care of all the amalekites except for AAG and AAG was hun into pieces by the prophet Samuel but here we have the amalekites burn and ziklag and David was in distress he's running from Saul the Philistines don't want him in their army he goes back to try to get to his wife and his men to their wives and the city is burned and the women and the children are missing and now David is standing there and his own men want to Stone him because their wives have been stolen away by the amalekites but the Bible tells us that David encouraged himself in the Lord what does it look like to encourage yourself in the Lord and somehow with David I kind of feel like it went kind of like this as his men are standing around him and probably crying thinking about what is happening to their wives the same as there are some men in Israel right now whose wives and children have been taken away captive and they don't know where they're at or what is being done to them and I just imagine that David stood there for just a moment but all of of the sudden there was something that dropped into him Lord when I was a younger man and I was watching over my father's sheep there was a lion that came and wanted to rip my sheep in pieces and Destroy them but somehow you gave me the strength to grab him by the beard and kill him and you also gave me that same kind of strength when a bear was going to do the same thing thing when the Paw of the bear was about to take out one of my sheep and somehow God you gave me the strength that to be able to to kill those two and Lord I also want to remind you that I was out in that sheep pasture and I was minding my own business and you you had already taken your hand off of Saul and you sent the prophet Samuel to my daddy's house and when you sent him to my daddy's Daddy's house I was just out in the sheep field watching over my sheep and all my brothers were at home but Samuel came down to the house and he was going to anoint a new king because you told him that it would be among the sons of Jessy and so Lord I was just minding my business and they came out after everyone Samuel had looked over all of my brothers and you chose me out of all of my brother Brothers to be king and Samuel when I came into the house Samuel poured that horn of oil over my head and he said you're the next king of Israel Lord I didn't ask for that position but you're the one that said it I was minding my own business but you are the one that anointed me to be the next king and here I am running from I'm running from Saul but I'm still to be the next king and Lord I want to also remind you that when when Saul was in a place where that he couldn't get a hold of you I went and I played my harp and I sang to try to calm the demon spirits that were in him but Lord I also want to remind you that somehow when my brothers and all of the army of Israel they were scared of Goliath there was something that when I went down to the camp and I saw that all of them were afraid to fight Goliath there was something that came over me Lord and you gave me the strength to not be afraid you took all of the fear out of my life and you gave me the courage to go down to that Brook and to get five smooth stones to pick up those [Music] stones you gave me the C en courage Lord when that giant lifted his voice and it rumbled and reverberated through that Valley enough to shake every one of my brothers it did not Shake Me Lord because you gave me the courage that I didn't necessarily have but you gave me the courage and David's just reminding the Lord of all of those things that he is already done for him all those things that he's already done on his behalf even though right now all around him is a mess the women are gone they don't know where they're at his men are ready to Stone him but David encouraged himself in the Lord because David was running his race with patience he had already been anointed king you have already been anointed bride he had already been anointed king but he was still running from Saul you have been anointed as priests and Kings but you're still defeating devils in your life you're still putting them down run this race with patience the race that is set before you encourage yourself and the Lord how do I do that brother remind the Lord and the devil of all of the times that God has come through for you remind him of your salvation remind him of your Holy Ghost experience remind him of the refilling that God has given you along the way remind him who the devil yeah God yeah remind both of them right does God need reminding probably not does the devil need reminding probably not I think he's probably probably still nursing the wounds of when some of us got delivered yes sir and he's pulled and he's yanked and he's jerked and he's pulled and he's yanked and he's jerked trying to get you to get back to the place where you once were he's trying to get you to take your eyes off of Jesus and get your eyes on your circumstances and he's trying to get you to be impatient with your journey so that you'll quit and go back to Egypt that you'll try to find a leader that will take you back to Egypt but run this race with patience run this race with patience the race that is set before you looking unto Jesus and away from your circumstances looking away from your circumstances and unto Jesus who is the author and the finisher of your faith after a while David encouraging himself in the Lord he calls for brother priest abathar bring me the ephod abar bring me the ephod Lord what's my next step what is my next step I'm now encouraged my men haven't stoned me I'm encouraged in the Lord as I've reminded you Lord of what you have done in the past and and I've reminded the enemy of what uh uh the Lord has done in the past and it's just kind of Built Me Up Inside as I remember as I remember and so I'm not going to stay here and let the men Stone me I'm not going to stay here and worry about what they might do next but I'm going to inquire of the Lord what should I do next you know that training process for David was not easy process I just like to read Psalm 95 to you oh come let us sing unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is great and great king above all gods in his hand are the Deep places of of the Earth the strength of of the hills also is his also the sea is his and he made it and His Hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice now why would David all the sudden why would David all of the sudden in the middle of praising the Lord be reminded of a Time past his ancestors who were in maybe the same kind of predicament that he was and he's remembering what happened to them and he says today if you'll hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation and is a day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do air in their heart they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest we look in this chapter and we see the contrast of the heart of praise that's coming out of David the heart of thankfulness that is coming out of him be and the because that he doesn't want want to find himself trapped in the same way that the children of Israel hardened their hearts in murmuring and complaining and had to go in the wilderness for 40 long years because of their murmurings and complainings yes David got himself into trouble with his folly but he always came back with a Heart of Thanksgiving with a heart of repentance to the Lord as the musicians are coming today I would just like to remind you of a vision that our brother brandham had this is found the Rapture message 1965 I remember that night before I'd seen that I seen the preview of the Bride I stood there and seen a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed dressed and things marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision and I seen they said the preview of the Bride I seen her go by they come on this side and went around I heard it coming up the church is coming from this other side there come the Asian Church oh you talk about filth here come the European Church oh my and then I heard rock and roll coming it was Miss America the church and she didn't even have on any clothes she had papers like newspapers gray holding in front of her dancing by rock and roll Miss America the church I stood there in his presence I thought oh God as a minister if that's the best we can do oh oh you know how it feels then I thought God hide me if I could just get away from here if that's all we've done and that's what we have to produce if that's what and then when them women passed by all doing kinds rocking rocks and things short hair painted faces and as they passed by like that supposed to be virgins to Christ and when she passed by like that I turned my head you know with this holding in front of me it was disgraceful the back of them and there they was going like that and I turned my head to weeping like that I said I can't couldn't stand it there him standing there and me know that me a minister of the church and that's what I'd produced for him I said oh God I can't look at it let me die let me fade away like that as soon as it come out every time one of them would come they'd go to a certain place and drop off I just hear the sound of it as it went away then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word they look like one out of Every Nation I was looking as they went by and seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up I noticed one of them trying two or three times trying getting out of line I screamed stay in line the vision left me and I was standing in the room screaming stay in line oh friends were we a part of that that he saw when we get impatient and we gravitate back to things that we let go of in the past just to bide our time because we don't feel like anything is happening are we one of those that are getting out of line and there's a voice calling from eternity stay in line amen that's right one more from a message getting in the spirit 1961 what we need is not a psychology move but we need a holy spirit move into the church until the people cry out where is that God that once lived where is that God of Pentecost where is that God that takes Sinners heart and washes them white as snow who takes a prostitute from the street makes a lady out of her takes a drunkard out of the barroom out yonder makes a preacher out of him where is that God that can move out and take them crippled legs straighten them out make them blind eyes to see them deaf ears to hear make the cancer vanish away where is the god that did that one time that's it we found out that there's something wrong the other night as I was preaching on the subject of the news flash greatest news flash in history old John his eyes got the prophet John was kind of filmed over he was like he had the spirit of Elijah and Elijah had a breakdown when he was under the juniper tree so it's not unnatural friends it's not unnatural to have moments Elijah had a breakdown when he was under the juniper tree and John had a breakdown in the prison and he was a high pitched Prophet them nerves on edge and then his Eagle Eye filmed over and he said go see if I've been wrong ask him if he's the one or if we were supposed to look for another this is what caught my attention Jesus never sent him any book now here's how to have patience while you're in jail what did he say what did he tell him he said just watch in this afternoon's meeting then go show John the lame walk the blind sea John had preached the gospel that a messiah was coming he would fan his hand and thoroughly Purge the floor sure burn the chaff with unquenchable fire but when he come he was a little Meek fellow meek and lowly didn't meet up with what John thought it ought to be but he said you go D John I'm running right on schedule it's all right everything is all right we're not going to send him a book how to have patience in jail we're not going to send him that book and I'm not going to send you that book no matter how jailed you feel right now how locked in position you feel right now you don't need a book how to have patience in jail because we have already been told that the trying of our faith is going to bring about the patience that we need we heard here on Tuesday night about tribulation and patience we don't have to ask for patience because tribulation will surely come it's a part of our life it's a part of this journey and we're not going to get to our destination faster than the Lord has already ordained for us to be it is our job to be in position and not get out of Step it is our part to play to be a part of the body of Christ that God has called us to to be in church when we're supposed to be so that we don't miss a nugget that's going to be for this next week that we're going to need we want to have every part of the equipment that we need because we know that all of creation is groaning all of creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and we may not yet see what we're hoping for but we wait the Amplified Romans 8:25 says but if we hope for what is still unseen by us we wait for it with patience and composure we don't have to get out of sorts we're waiting with patience and composure we're not going to rail Against One Another We're not going to rail against our pastor we're not going to rail against the word of God we're going to keep our composure and we're going to recognize that what I'm going through right this moment God ordained it because he knew that I needed it in order for me to be uh uh transformed into who I am supposed to be doesn't feel good fire generally doesn't but it is necessary for us knowing this as you're standing that the trying of your faith work as patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire or complete wanting or lacking nothing would you bow your heads today please as we're coming to the completion of this service if you're here today and you feel like that you
