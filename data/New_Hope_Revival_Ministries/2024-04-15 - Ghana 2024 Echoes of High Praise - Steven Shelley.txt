TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] to BU banana from Market [Music] [Music] you many at times we have a lot of men of God and they feed the congregation and sometimes if I say when we we take it to food we can eat so much rice but we need somebody who will come and add flavor and vegetables to it with a unique Ministry and that is what Pastor Shel has brought into the message and into Bible Believers Fellowship he has brought a balance in the word MI in the prophetic with teaching and and and demonstration of power Miracles sze and wonders and this has really transformed the ministry and and and expanded the work of God down here in Africa it's opened our eyes to many things that God can do not only a one-sided Ministry but the prophetic has given us insight to who God is and what God has given to us and how we can bring the Kingdom of Heaven upon this Earth to walk the kingdom mandate just a few short days ago dad Hawk and myself lated in Ghana West Africa we've taken a short drive over to TMA where our hotel is and where the meetings are going to be held just just a short distance over there we're really excited to be here the expectation of the people is high and we're also expecting for ourselves this is my third time here and every time it seems to get better and better the atmosphere of the building is electric when you pull onto the property and then you go inside and it's even more electric with the worship we're just super excited for what the Lord is going to do [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] man of God all the way from Alabama and there's a there's a new word I learned today to describe him the word is super [Music] [Applause] fragilistic and in just a few weeks I'm going to be a grand and help me receive the ministry of our [Applause] [Music] [Applause] again [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my name is Isaac Benjamin Tay I met Pastor Shel when I was a teenager when he came he first came to Ghana we had this major convention and I was a tiny little boy playing keyboard and backing him on songs and I used to shiver when he's playing cuz I was scared of the crowd but with time I I got over it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and along the way um I met Pastor Shelly again in Amsterdam and he gave me a word of Prophecy that that you are pursuing business management but the Lord has a higher calling for you and afterwards about 3 years later the Lord began to speak I moved out of Holland to UK and um through UK I've been to many cities but when the right time came the Lord relocated me to wampton specifically to start the ministry called T pray Center and the Bible Believers Fellowship not just one son but many sons are coming to maturity under the Dynamics of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah I declare that in Jesus name it is possible I will recover all that Satan has stolen from me in the name of Jesus [Music] [Applause] Christ h i rece and when I was after I received the Holy Ghost I started ministering at 7 and I was pastoring at 17 so you are never too young to be used of and I want to encourage every one of you to give your lives to Jesus now my name is David chishi AKA I am the youth pastor at bible Believers Fellowship terer I believe that generally people who came in for the convention everybody would go back with a personal testimony I have had my personal testimony because there are many questions on my mind the Lord has answered now the spiritual side I have received a great impartation I'm going back into Ministry with greater knowledge um a higher spiritual level and I believe it is so for many other people too now many people came from different parts of Ghana and the testim they are going back with the healing of the infirmities in their bodies then the deliverance from um demonic forces oppression and all of these I I believe it's been a great an awesome time in the presence of God you know we know that nobody comes into the presence of the Lord and leaves the same we know that but at Easter 2024 meetings we saw it [Applause] [Applause] there was an overflow of Joy where people could express the the Liberty they have in Christ they could dance without thinking of what think about them they could scream and shout and I tell you Bible Believers and the Easter meetings we had shouting dancing jumping clapping was our daily dose of medicine it was awesome we had pastors from Kenya Rwanda Togo Nigeria myself from United Kingdom we had um Brethren from USA we had um Pastor Shel himself and a wonderful team from USA and we had another servant of God from the USA and a few across the continent of Africa I will say that they travel to honor the unique gift that God has placed in this end time in the early church the disciples traveled to Jerusalem because there was something unique there and when it comes to Pastor Shel he's a unique gift to the body of Christ and he is very scarce he's a red gem we will say he's one in a million so when we get the opportunity for him to come down because we are in close proximity we have to travel to come and benefit from his ministry and that is why we all troop in to sit under his ministry to be empowered to be ignited and to be set on fire for the Lord [Music] to
