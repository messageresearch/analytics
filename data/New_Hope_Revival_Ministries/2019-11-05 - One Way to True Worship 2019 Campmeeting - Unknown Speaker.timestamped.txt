[12:57] [Music]
[12:59] let us stand we're going to ask you to
[13:12] turn with us to acts the fourth chapter
[13:17] remember we are preparing for a new
[13:22] world if you can just keep that in mind
[13:32] think Satan just in that would be
[13:36] defeated in your life
[13:41] we talked about
[13:44] god
[13:47] changing us
[13:49] nature into his nature
[13:55] and you know nature is too thin you're
[13:58] nature's what describe you
[14:03] that's why when the world called
[14:04] themselves dogs I just don't like that
[14:08] what's up dog because I'm not a dog
[14:17] because a dog is one of the unclean
[14:20] things don't get me wrong I know y'all
[14:24] love your dogs but it's not
[14:31] a thing where you can change it doesn't
[14:35] matter how you dress them up it's still
[14:40] a dog and dogs are gonna do what they do
[14:47] because of its nature now if you changed
[14:50] the nature of that dog and to a sheep
[14:54] it may look like a dog but it will act
[14:57] like a sheep because you have changed
[15:01] the nature yeah some people they want to
[15:04] get mad at me but that's okay some be
[15:08] talking about my dog now I'm now
[15:12] speaking bad of dogs I'm just telling
[15:14] you you know some people got speaks for
[15:16] pets now some of them have snakes for
[15:22] pets but my point is it's just to bring
[15:27] you to a place where you can see that
[15:30] God is here to change you why call
[15:33] yourself a Christian if God hasn't
[15:36] changed you we won't change and only God
[15:42] can change you I can wash my face I can
[15:48] wash my hands but only God can wash my
[15:51] heart and every one of us needs our
[15:56] hearts washed x4 beginning at the
[16:02] eleventh verse glad to see everybody
[16:07] here this is the stone which was set at
[16:11] nought of you builders which is become
[16:15] the head of the corner neither is there
[16:19] salvation in any other but there is none
[16:23] other name under heaven given among men
[16:27] whereby we must be saved
[16:33] Colossians please
[16:38] hallelujah I trust by God's grace that
[16:43] God would give us ears to hear and eyes
[16:45] to see some of us are moving in that
[16:48] direction anyway because I know that I'm
[16:51] feeling a poor there's something that's
[16:54] really happening and the bride sees it
[16:57] she cannot explain it but she knows that
[17:02] the message of the word is making a turn
[17:07] she knows and something is happening on
[17:11] the inside she said she's she sucked I
[17:13] feel like she's about to lose her mind
[17:16] because why God is tugging on her it
[17:19] seemed like others are not getting it
[17:21] and hopefully God will do something for
[17:26] us this morning
[17:29] Colossians 3:17
[17:36] and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do
[17:41] all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[17:46] thanks to God and the Father by him you
[17:52] loved the Lord one more scripture please
[17:56] Ephesians 1
[18:02] hallelujah
[18:08] vegans won the
[18:11] seven blessed be the God and father of
[18:15] our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed
[18:18] us with all spiritual blessings in
[18:22] heavenly places in Christ so that you'll
[18:27] know that span here in Alabama but I'm
[18:32] also sitting in heaviness hello whether
[18:37] you see it or not
[18:38] the Bible tells us that we are now
[18:41] sitting in heavenly places according as
[18:46] he have chosen us in him before the
[18:50] foundation of the world that we should
[18:53] be holy and without blame before him in
[18:58] love
[19:02] Oh have you ever thought about it the
[19:07] Bible tells us that we have so justified
[19:09] as though we've never done it in the
[19:11] first place because the real you
[19:14] has always been there having
[19:19] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[19:22] the children that by Jesus Christ like
[19:24] your pastor was saying to himself
[19:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:29] will to the praise of the glory of His
[19:32] grace wherein he have made us y'all here
[19:38] that accepted in the beloved
[19:41] he made us that before you were born you
[19:46] were accepted in whom we have redemption
[19:50] through his blood the forgiveness of sin
[19:53] according to the riches of His grace let
[19:57] us pray father we thank you for your
[20:02] amazing grace we thank you for being so
[20:05] good to us and Lord you have blessed us
[20:08] and we're thanking you for the blessing
[20:11] that you have already blessed us with
[20:13] the blessings from yesterday and the
[20:17] blessings for today even though Lord we
[20:21] haven't seen the end of the service yet
[20:23] but we know about your grace and your
[20:26] mercy you have already blessed us and
[20:28] we're thanking you for it
[20:30] we're in expectation to see what you
[20:35] have determined as a blessing for us
[20:37] today take us to a place we've never
[20:41] been before help us now in your name
[20:46] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[20:50] seated and as our pastor have said you
[20:54] may be a little weary forget it
[20:58] less press that's how God puts you in a
[21:03] place you always put this you see what
[21:05] I'm trying to say what I'm saying is
[21:07] when you're tired and you know you can't
[21:10] do anything that's when God comes on the
[21:13] scene so that you'll know that he is the
[21:17] one that's doing this and not you I'd
[21:24] like to entitle this message
[21:26] one way to true worship
[21:32] and I'd like to express that the one way
[21:38] to true worship
[21:40] God has provided that way it is not your
[21:47] way it's what God has provided and every
[21:53] man woman whoever you may be must
[21:57] worship in the way that God has provided
[22:01] in order to be accepted hello somebody
[22:07] help me here you and I must understand
[22:10] in order to get to heaven you got to
[22:14] come the way that God has provided
[22:16] [Music]
[22:19] remember there was a man a man who was
[22:24] invited to a wedding but he slipped in a
[22:28] different way and the way that God had
[22:32] provided was the door you must come in
[22:36] at the door because when you enter into
[22:41] the door there was a man waiting there
[22:43] for you to slip you on a new robe to
[22:48] wash you up to perfume you it didn't
[22:54] matter whether you were rich or poor
[22:56] everybody had on the same Road
[23:01] hallelujah and we know that role
[23:05] represents the Holy Spirit
[23:09] oh god helpless
[23:11] there's all in one way
[23:15] Kaine thought that he could worship God
[23:17] in his own way
[23:21] but the Bible tells us without the
[23:23] shedding of blood there is no remission
[23:28] so God's Way is a bloody way it's always
[23:34] been a mess hallelujah
[23:37] it's always been a mess and in order to
[23:41] get to heaven you've gotta come through
[23:43] alas did you know not that my God loves
[23:47] to clean up messes all the Bible says
[23:52] even in Genesis that it was in a mess
[23:56] but it wasn't always that way but
[24:00] something happened and it put the world
[24:02] in a mess but underneath the mess
[24:07] somebody help me here
[24:09] there were seas that was predestinated
[24:13] to come through a mess Oh somebody help
[24:18] me that's why you're in a mess because
[24:20] this is the mess age and you better
[24:27] understand this it's been ordained by
[24:30] God come on the better the manure the
[24:40] better the growth of the plant
[24:45] hallelujah and so God put us in laodicea
[24:49] i less come on somebody
[24:59] everything is a less but that's the way
[25:04] God likes it he's the only one that can
[25:09] bring something good out of something
[25:11] that's evil oh Jesus help me here the
[25:17] name of Jesus is hardly exalted but we
[25:21] are loud we have allowed the enemy to
[25:24] rush us the devil don't care if you say
[25:29] God because there's a plenty of gods the
[25:33] yah hear me you know you can go on a
[25:36] restaurant you somewhere you say you
[25:38] know God has been so good to me nobody
[25:40] says anything about that but when you
[25:44] say Jesus when you mention the name
[25:47] Jesus it shakes up the kingdom of
[25:50] Devil's hallelujah when you say thank
[25:54] you Jesus heads will turn y'all know
[25:58] what I'm saying
[25:59] it's something about the name of Jesus
[26:06] you and I must understand there's only
[26:09] one way and people don't understand you
[26:13] know when it came to Abel Abel didn't
[26:15] have to do nothing but present a lamb
[26:19] hallelujah he didn't make the lamb grow
[26:23] all he did was lead the lamb hallelujah
[26:27] and he he took this lamb and he by
[26:31] revelation he came to understand that
[26:35] the blood is the covering agent that God
[26:39] has provided if it was the lamb in the
[26:45] beginning it's going to be the lamb in
[26:47] the evening it'll never be how good you
[26:52] are it's how good he is to you Oh
[26:56] somebody help me here you and I must
[26:59] understand it is a devil that makes
[27:02] salvation hard God's Way is simple has
[27:07] always been simple somebody help me here
[27:11] if you follow God's Way it'll be better
[27:18] than following the yellow brick road man
[27:27] makes it complicated hallelujah that's
[27:33] what Cain did he wanted to make this
[27:37] God's Way complicated you know when you
[27:39] grow vegetables and all that you gotta
[27:41] have sprays and Oh cousin we kill us and
[27:45] yeah you got it you gotta tend to it but
[27:49] when you have a sheep all you got to do
[27:51] is lead the Sheep to the right place you
[27:53] don't have to spoon-feed him you don't
[27:56] have to pet him up you he follows you
[27:59] and any finds a green pasture and then
[28:01] he eats hallelujah that's how it is with
[28:06] God the Lord is my shepherd somebody
[28:10] help me here
[28:11] even as he
[28:13] Abell he leads you come on people did
[28:19] not have to go to school to know God I'm
[28:23] not against education but God is not
[28:27] known by education you cannot process
[28:30] God because God is somebody help me
[28:36] no doctors of Divinity degree could ever
[28:39] tell you about God because God is a
[28:43] revelation and to know who God is
[28:47] it must be a revelation one way to
[28:53] worship true worship hallelujah oh it's
[28:59] always been the lamb I love the lamb
[29:05] hallelujah it was a profound statement
[29:10] when John saw that lamb and John said
[29:14] behold the lamb is that right because
[29:24] the lab is the Word of God that's right
[29:28] in the beginning was the word is that
[29:31] right the Word was with God and the Word
[29:33] was God
[29:34] but we did not understand that even
[29:38] under the law it was the lamb that was
[29:42] slain before the foundation of the world
[29:45] that produced grace and mercy to those
[29:49] who were under the law
[29:53] hallelujah they greed from the lair they
[30:00] are invisible hail the Lamb that had not
[30:03] yet been made manifest
[30:05] see that's why God Luther laughs he knew
[30:09] man was going to fall and God be the
[30:12] judge God knew that need to be something
[30:15] to protect mankind from his wrath and
[30:21] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[30:25] of the world in the shadow and the type
[30:30] but they never understood it was more
[30:35] than a ritual it was the greatest event
[30:40] of all mankind when the lamb was slain
[30:45] oh I don't feel sorry for him
[30:50] what would my PT do for him I am so glad
[30:54] oh y'all looking at me like I'm crazy
[30:56] y'all don't understand me I needed
[31:01] something to protect me hallelujah
[31:06] you think Abel said oh you look lamb I
[31:09] am so sorry
[31:11] hallelujah Ava understood if he had not
[31:15] slain that lamb he would die all
[31:19] connections to heaven all connection to
[31:22] God would be lost
[31:26] hallelujah people say eternal life just
[31:29] like I was saying the other day that
[31:31] eight but there's a cross right in the
[31:35] middle of it that joined that spiritual
[31:38] that in the natural world together when
[31:41] cry stood in the midst there between
[31:43] heaven and earth hallelujah Oh God he
[31:47] was saving that was in heaven and that
[31:49] was just one earth I want you to think
[32:02] about this because I'm working with one
[32:03] body one body Jesus Jesus didn't have to
[32:07] he had only one body and the Bible said
[32:12] he's the head of the church but there's
[32:16] only one body many members but one body
[32:21] that's important to know one body when
[32:27] God anointed Abel
[32:32] I was there when God called Abraham I
[32:43] was there
[32:46] say brother what are you talking about I
[32:49] don't know all the things that my daddy
[32:51] did in his lifetime but whatever daddy
[32:54] did I was there I was in him yet not
[33:00] made manifest until my mother came
[33:03] around but I was my daddy what kind of a
[33:08] life he lived I was in him
[33:11] somebody help me here and so whatever
[33:14] God did God will do I in him I am in him
[33:20] is that right that's what that's what
[33:24] Jesus said he said father I would that
[33:27] be one even as we are one I in you you
[33:31] and me and I in them right we need us he
[33:37] is in us brother I'm not a Christian yet
[33:43] but he placed a seed in you right
[33:47] the saw Sosa's before the foundation of
[33:52] the world he placed himself in you in c4
[33:57] that's why you feel guilty sometimes
[34:00] right when you was a sinner
[34:03] you couldn't just see it like everybody
[34:05] else without feeling guilty what was it
[34:08] that was representation that was
[34:11] something in you showing you that you
[34:13] don't belong out there
[34:16] you belong in Christ
[34:20] and you'll never be satisfied until you
[34:24] give your heart to Jesus
[34:28] louia one way to worship you know it's
[34:33] the truth
[34:33] oh I used to go up and party and drink
[34:36] and all those things I ain't telling you
[34:38] all my business but I was the kind of
[34:42] person that I come home and feel bad why
[34:45] everybody else is happy smiling I'll
[34:47] come back home as Oh God I don't don't
[34:49] let me do that no more hallelujah
[34:53] but I had so many Devils in me I was out
[34:55] there the next weekend brother some of
[35:00] y'all act like y'all don't know y'all
[35:01] been save all your life I know but we
[35:06] had those days y'all know to say it was
[35:11] important even though God did not make
[35:14] Adam and Eve fall it was important for
[35:17] God for them to follow they had to fall
[35:25] so that we can have the knowledge of
[35:28] good and evil so we could make a choice
[35:34] which you would like to be is that right
[35:38] but understand when God made the choice
[35:42] we made the choice honey because when he
[35:47] made the charge we were in him when he
[35:50] made the choice that's why God knows
[35:53] what choices you were going to make help
[35:57] me Lord help me Jesus
[36:02] one way to worship one true way because
[36:09] we come in in a day where everybody
[36:10] wanna worship God but understand those
[36:14] who are predestinated to worship Him in
[36:16] spirit and in truth will do so somebody
[36:21] help me here when God when Jesus came to
[36:26] the woman at the where she was a
[36:29] prostitute
[36:31] so because you've been bad out there
[36:34] because you've been a whoremonger
[36:36] whatever you been
[36:37] doesn't mean you a devil's child
[36:41] somebody help me because if that seed of
[36:46] God is in you if you got a conscious
[36:49] something that works with you and tries
[36:51] to make you derive how to look at that
[36:53] shows you're not from hell but from
[36:57] heaven something is pulling on you try
[37:03] to open your eyes to you somebody help
[37:09] me and you don't have to worry about
[37:16] cleaning up God will clean you up God
[37:22] wasn't lost use laws it was God who
[37:25] picked you up and justified you it's God
[37:29] who washes the cup hallelujah it is God
[37:33] who feels to come somebody help me here
[37:35] it's God but because of your choosing
[37:39] like the brother says because you make
[37:42] the choice garlic God follows through
[37:45] with your decision help me Jesus
[37:49] hallelujah
[37:51] think about it when God was with Abraham
[37:55] I was there I love this part when he
[38:00] went to Calvary I was there so don't
[38:03] tell me I can't do it I can't do it you
[38:06] can do it
[38:07] hallelujah you know there's one thing
[38:09] about the telephone system I like it
[38:12] because there times you can be so
[38:15] connected
[38:17] and then there's times you can be
[38:19] disconnected hallelujah you know that
[38:23] but you advertisement can you hear me
[38:25] now
[38:29] you know people look at that and we fail
[38:32] to see God speaking they're supposed to
[38:36] be a constant connection but sometime
[38:39] interference disconnects you or maybe
[38:43] you are in a place where God can't
[38:45] connect come on somebody none of us like
[38:53] to be disconnected especially on our
[38:55] telephone sometimes people go all out
[38:58] the building in the cold so they can get
[39:00] a connection to be disconnected and
[39:10] won't worry about it but when you feel
[39:16] disconnected you need to move from where
[39:23] you can be connected back with God I
[39:31] don't like being disconnected
[39:33] you know sometimes God will spank you
[39:35] when you do wrong sometimes he'll pull
[39:38] back from you
[39:39] that is horrible that's a horrible
[39:42] feeling to a real believer you search
[39:46] yourself God what did I do wrong did I
[39:48] say something wrong did I acted the
[39:50] wrong way whatever it is God forgive me
[39:54] cuz he's the only friend that'll stick
[39:56] closer than a brother you lose him as a
[40:00] friend you might as well throw your
[40:01] hands up come on somebody there's nobody
[40:06] that will treat you like Jesus
[40:08] he's been my mother he's been my father
[40:11] he's been my sister
[40:12] he's been my brother he's my all you
[40:15] know
[40:17] when nobody else comes around he shows
[40:21] up somebody help me here y'all know what
[40:24] I'm talking about
[40:26] hallelujah I think about a winner
[40:29] nobody understood who Jesus was but John
[40:32] the Baptist saw him hallelujah I'm
[40:34] talking about the lamb the lamb that for
[40:37] thousands of years or hundreds of years
[40:38] have been just in symbol here now the
[40:42] lamb being born a man in a manger
[40:46] hallelujah among the Sheep like the
[40:49] brother said he didn't he didn't go to a
[40:51] fancy hotel hallelujah but he was in
[40:55] type the Lamb of God he was a real never
[40:57] God so he was born in a stable whatever
[41:02] we call it
[41:04] but the point is
[41:08] wise men there were men who was
[41:12] connected connected by the stars
[41:19] somebody help me that's what there are
[41:24] people today who are connected by the
[41:27] Stars
[41:28] and they followed the star and that's
[41:30] what they found somebody help me
[41:36] you and I must understand this is a
[41:38] beautiful way I just love being a
[41:41] Christian I thought being a Christian
[41:50] I'm coming brother told me I can take my
[41:53] time and I'm taking it it's the truth
[41:57] I don't know how many of y'all still
[41:59] look at movies just act like this is a
[42:01] movie three hours long don't get nervous
[42:09] I'm talkin preach tree house but my
[42:13] understand then that God world is more
[42:16] important than anything Hollywood could
[42:19] ever produce now we're talking about I
[42:24] heard my sister talking about rainbows
[42:26] or the colors of him and a brother of
[42:29] mine who just got a liver transplant he
[42:31] lives over there in South Africa he had
[42:34] an out-of-body experience and in that
[42:36] out-of-body experience
[42:38] he saw stones that were living and there
[42:44] were all different colors and then he
[42:46] saw the high priests dressed
[42:48] oh my hallelujah
[42:52] and every time I hear people say colors
[42:54] colors I say the high priest is
[42:56] somewhere around hallelujah yeah
[43:02] sometimes you see lights flashing
[43:04] everywhere it ain't your just your eyes
[43:07] is something God is showing you God is
[43:10] in the house
[43:14] hallelujah think about it I'm moving
[43:17] slowly but one of the things I said one
[43:20] body because I want you to understand
[43:22] when you're baptized into the Holy Ghost
[43:24] you're baptized into the body of Jesus
[43:26] Christ hallelujah
[43:28] so you can understand and I know you do
[43:31] but my point is if you can be baptized
[43:35] in my body that means that you would be
[43:37] in my body not on top of it I won't be
[43:42] wearing your my sleeve but you will
[43:44] become part of me and I will become part
[43:47] of you right it is that Holy Spirit that
[43:51] translates us into the body of Christ
[43:54] y'all hear me
[43:56] so whatever Jesus is I am somebody help
[44:02] me remember Moses Moses come
[44:07] and Moses says to God in that bush who
[44:14] should I ask first of all he says Lord
[44:16] Who am I
[44:17] that's a good question everybody this
[44:20] morning or just say Who am I and if you
[44:23] really talking to God Who am I
[44:25] God will respond back to you on who you
[44:29] are
[44:29] your understanding if you want to know
[44:32] who you really are that's why I try to
[44:33] tell people nobody can tell me I'm
[44:35] bribed I'm not Brian scuse me I have a
[44:38] revelation nobody can't take that away
[44:44] from me
[44:45] you said but I've seen you do this I've
[44:48] seen you that doesn't make any
[44:49] difference what you thought you saw I'd
[44:52] like to say thought because God washes
[44:53] all my sins away at the end of the day
[44:57] you'll not have one ounce of evidence
[44:59] against me somebody why because this is
[45:05] not about you it's about me it Moses
[45:14] answer was tell them I am seeing you so
[45:23] Moses
[45:26] name changes
[45:29] from Moses
[45:31] - I am some yeah yeah they saw Moses but
[45:38] Moses news and no longer Moses he was
[45:41] just a veil it was I am it was I am said
[45:46] unto Pharaoh let my people call that
[45:49] what Moses had no power it was the power
[45:52] that was hallelujah
[45:58] and so when Moses began to speak and
[46:01] throw down his rod this is limited like
[46:04] like this that was the difference
[46:07] because when God says I am the God of
[46:09] Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[46:12] hallelujah and that's just what happens
[46:15] to a lot of Christians we know God as
[46:21] the God of William Branham the god of
[46:28] Luther or the God of Wesley when will he
[46:32] become your God with will he will he
[46:36] become I am to you you understand me
[46:40] because when Moses went down hallelujah
[46:44] to see Pharaoh he didn't say the God of
[46:46] Abraham Isaac and Jacob sent me he said
[46:49] I have changed my position now Moses
[47:04] somebody help me remember I said it must
[47:07] be the same the god of this age is the
[47:15] same he's going to produce the same
[47:19] works the same size the same wonders the
[47:23] same everything no matter what you look
[47:26] like if he's in you come on somebody
[47:32] hallelujah I'm just so tired of seeing
[47:35] people come to church brother just
[47:37] getting a social sip
[47:40] y'all know it's your truth you come to
[47:44] church and you just get a little sip I
[47:57] don't come to church to get us here I
[47:59] get I come to church to get drunk you
[48:04] can't get drunk off of I come for a
[48:08] whole stimulation I want so much
[48:11] divination to the hairs on my hair
[48:13] stands up hallelujah that's the problem
[48:22] the problem is we want to keep
[48:25] everything straight what do I care
[48:29] hallelujah when I go to dancing when I
[48:32] was out there in the world I used to get
[48:34] so a falling off the stairs huh and you

[48:52] the last the best wine has been saved
[48:55] for you but you'll never get it there
[49:00] you'll never get God coming you know I
[49:02] think I'll just sit in my seat I think
[49:04] I'll just keep my place hallelujah you
[49:07] got to get into the spirit hallelujah
[49:10] you got to get into what God wants you
[49:12] to get into you say what do you mean is
[49:15] that our word that you be hot or cold
[49:19] lukewarm makes God's sake to a stomach
[49:23] but I choose to be hot somebody choose
[49:28] to be on fire oh god help us here oh I
[49:34] am so tired of religion I don't know
[49:36] what to do every time I look around
[49:40] people try to throw throw some kind of
[49:42] strange stuff on you huh it's almost
[49:50] like what Saudi tried to put David on
[49:52] this His garment his arm I don't need
[49:55] that I don't need the intellectual
[49:58] interpretation of this message I just
[50:00] need him somebody help me look like much
[50:08] stone one but my one stone is able to
[50:14] slay educate somebody help me here see
[50:18] that's the way God don't need a majority
[50:20] to serve Him God just need one run an
[50:28] invasion and we need to be determined
[50:36] God I'm not gonna let you down that's
[50:40] the way I feel I'm not gonna let call me

[51:58] that devil comes to steal kill and
[52:01] destroy and whatever he can do to take
[52:03] you out he'll do it but thank Peter God
[52:07] he can't move you until God says so he
[52:12] can't God will not allow a true saint of
[52:15] God to die without the purpose being
[52:17] fulfilled oh Jesus
[52:23] st. John 17 says 2023 neither pray I for
[52:28] these alone but for them also which
[52:30] shall believe on me through their word
[52:32] that they all may be one

[58:40] that's what Paul said Paul was a gifted
[58:43] man impulses you know what God allowed

[58:47] wouldn't get lifted up in my revelation
[58:50] hallelujah let me tell you sisters and

[59:21] to the Europeans had they not been
[59:26] divided come on somebody if they had
[59:32] unified they would have sent everybody
[59:36] back home come on somebody and the real
[59:40] American today would have been the
[59:42] Indians somebody help me here you see
[59:46] the same tactic the Indians is that
[1:00:18] right but they separated themselves the
[1:00:21] tribes fought each other
[1:00:25] hallelujah that happened in Africa too
[1:00:28] you know
[1:00:29] and it's happening today you said what
[1:00:33] do you mean our country has never been
[1:00:35] so divided and divided is that right

[1:04:48] Bible what he said yeah you are the
[1:04:51] Bible understand he said I told you to

[1:07:00] name of Joseph his daddy favored him
[1:07:04] people said we ought not to favor
[1:07:06] certain children when some time I can't
[1:07:08] help it it's just nature it's really
[1:07:13] what it is God favors you you don't have
[1:07:16] a problem with that do you right oh it's
[1:07:21] the truth it's a chemical it's a natural
[1:07:24] thing it's something you know maybe it's
[1:07:26] just compatibility some your children
[1:07:29] you're not compatible with see y'all
[1:07:33] haven't had enough y'all need to go back
[1:07:34] and have a few more but I've got AIDS

[1:07:43] Yanis tell me they're different in their
[1:07:46] ways their way of thinking hallelujah
[1:07:51] but then you have one or two they call
[1:07:55] them daddies children or Mama's children
[1:07:59] right it was a long time before I
[1:08:02] realized some of my children really
[1:08:04] loved me
[1:08:05] the average Cameron you look around
[1:08:07] there was mama mama mama mama and that's
[1:08:11] just the way it goes hallelujah y'all
[1:08:13] understand what I'm saying but Joseph
[1:08:16] was given a coat a multi-coloured coat
[1:08:21] so whenever Joseph would wear this coat
[1:08:24] his brothers knew he was not coming to
[1:08:28] work his work days were over it's the
[1:08:40] truth when God gives you the coat your
[1:08:44] work day is over
[1:08:46] but people get mad at a real Christian
[1:08:50] because they don't get upset like they
[1:08:51] do they've got virtues that they don't
[1:08:55] have and Joseph's thought was to be
[1:08:59] faithful to his father when his brothers
[1:09:02] were not faithful but to the Lord Jesus
[1:09:07] Christ under they don't care under no
[1:09:10] circumstances with a drink the father's
[1:09:14] will but that wasn't like Joseph's
[1:09:17] brothers they slew that little lamb
[1:09:20] hallelujah and they said we're gonna
[1:09:23] tell daddy he's dead that was the best
[1:09:26] thing they did see because when they
[1:09:28] hear wearing that color coat and then
[1:09:31] putting the blood on it was a promotion
[1:09:36] for Joseph even when he didn't know it
[1:09:42] let me tell you something like the
[1:09:45] brother said yesterday your King even
[1:09:48] when you don't know your King
[1:09:50] ah y'all understand me it's just the way
[1:09:55] God does things and you and I must
[1:09:57] understand when it comes to one body you
[1:09:59] and I must step into the book
[1:10:01] y'all don't believe me let me say like
[1:10:04] this when you pastors up here and says
[1:10:06] oh and David he took that stone and he
[1:10:10] began to were lit were lit were guess
[1:10:13] what's happening you have changed
[1:10:15] position you sitting in your seat and
[1:10:18] you'll now the David he's speaking on
[1:10:20] think about it is that right how many
[1:10:24] y'all say oh well I'm gonna lie better
[1:10:26] Doug you don't take that position
[1:10:29] because that's not your position in the
[1:10:32] world you are the David somebody help me
[1:10:40] it's the truth you take the positions
[1:10:44] that you have been predestinated to take
[1:10:46] the position of is that right when we
[1:10:50] talk about the Eagles and the crows you
[1:10:52] don't take the position of the Buzzard
[1:10:55] you take the positions of the eagle why
[1:10:58] there's something on the inside that
[1:11:00] amens you to that even though you may
[1:11:03] not even see signs of you being an eagle
[1:11:09] hallelujah am I making sense I want you
[1:11:13] to understand we are blessed people I
[1:11:14] know the world they don't understand us
[1:11:17] you know first of all we are you know we
[1:11:21] just love church too much my next-door
[1:11:25] neighbor said to me are you going to
[1:11:27] church again I say yeah come go with me
[1:11:33] he never asked me that question again
[1:11:36] he's a good man I love him I praying for
[1:11:39] his soul I'm praying for it so I really
[1:11:42] love this man he's a good man good
[1:11:45] neighbor and I'm praying for his soul
[1:11:48] but I'm like because I just asked it all
[1:11:50] I said Lord just give me a little space
[1:11:52] give me something to say cuz you know I
[1:11:55] don't like killing people I'm here to
[1:11:57] say he
[1:11:59] hmm and I said Lord just give me some
[1:12:02] wisdom and I'm telling you the very same
[1:12:04] day I'm coming out out in my house to go
[1:12:07] to church he said oh man
[1:12:09] you going to church again thank you lord
[1:12:14] yeah do you want to come yeah he's
[1:12:17] coming he just don't know it yet I
[1:12:21] believe with all my heart this man is to
[1:12:24] be a Christian I do if I thought he
[1:12:26] wasn't I wouldn't bother him you love
[1:12:28] the Lord see the Christian is the
[1:12:31] greatest thing a person could ever be
[1:12:34] this is the only thing that's eternal is
[1:12:38] that right let me let me move on to say
[1:12:40] this there are only two faculties that
[1:12:42] Glover's the human and one of them is
[1:12:45] faith which brings result and the other
[1:12:49] is fear it has no value in it right so
[1:12:54] you go either have faith or fear but in
[1:12:58] order to have perfect love you've got to
[1:13:01] have faith hallelujah that's why when we
[1:13:05] pray for each other it's not about how
[1:13:08] are you scream and hollow matter of fact
[1:13:13] that that denotes you sometimes
[1:13:19] Jesus didn't play with the Devils and
[1:13:22] I'm not saying nothing wrong with that
[1:13:23] I'm just saying sometimes we think
[1:13:26] that's gonna like I was telling somebody
[1:13:28] young lady the other day you know a
[1:13:31] couple now said you know what it's so
[1:13:32] amazing I said we used that Scripture
[1:13:35] spare the rod spoil the child
[1:13:37] I said but do you really think a stick
[1:13:40] or or belt it's gonna drive the devil
[1:13:43] away if you don't mix that with love
[1:13:48] somebody help me here you got to mix
[1:13:51] that spanking with love coz love
[1:13:53] conquers all if you just thinking the
[1:14:00] child with no love you know what its
[1:14:02] gonna do is gonna make that person
[1:14:03] stubborn but if you mix it with love is
[1:14:08] gonna soften him up oh come on somebody
[1:14:13] you gotta understand if you gonna spank
[1:14:16] him you gotta stake it in love is that
[1:14:19] right
[1:14:20] that's how God spank you he spanked you
[1:14:23] in love
[1:14:27] this is one of my key scriptures Lord
[1:14:30] let thy will be done in earth as it is
[1:14:32] in heaven
[1:14:34] however I'm living there I want to live
[1:14:37] here however I'm living here I want to
[1:14:39] live it like that you understand me your
[1:14:45] faith is of God and fear is of the devil
[1:14:50] mmm it's true don't you know that even
[1:14:54] when you got Divine Love entertained the
[1:14:56] savage beast mmm
[1:14:59] listen it's the truth and I'm no heart
[1:15:03] no hard feelings two people who got cats
[1:15:04] I have problems with Cassie hmm I don't
[1:15:11] know what you call it but I've seen cats
[1:15:13] change from natural to supernatural have
[1:15:18] anybody seen that oh yeah
[1:15:20] I was a house at the house of a witch
[1:15:22] and I didn't know it and this witch did
[1:15:25] whatever he did he was supposed to be a
[1:15:27] blind medium and he had these huge
[1:15:30] casting big old Bobcats his name was Bob
[1:15:33] I'm just saying but my point is he was
[1:15:36] huge and I got out the car and they had
[1:15:40] about five of them they loved me brother
[1:15:42] surely those can't love me I wish they
[1:15:46] didn't though because when they see me
[1:15:49] they all come Lord Jesus I told that
[1:15:54] lady I said get those cats got him on
[1:15:55] kick him she said yeah if you keep that
[1:16:00] cat so-and-so gonna get you I said Oh
[1:16:03] Lord Jesus help me
[1:16:04] then all of a sudden the cats move we
[1:16:06] went into the house you understand me
[1:16:07] this man is telling me things about my
[1:16:10] brothers and sisters that was true but I
[1:16:12] didn't know it because it was recently
[1:16:14] done and so I told no that ain't true he
[1:16:18] got angry with me and he looked over at
[1:16:21] that cat that can't hunch this back up
[1:16:23] like that jumped in the air turned to
[1:16:25] this big black ball I was sitting in a
[1:16:28] chair guess what I got up
[1:16:32] it's the truth goddess and I scream like
[1:16:36] a girl
[1:16:39] brother Simmons say what's wrong with
[1:16:41] you I said you didn't see that I say
[1:16:44] it's time to go yes
[1:16:48] you don't tell me that that's power in
[1:16:50] witchcraft and let me tell you something
[1:16:53] if there's power in witchcraft there's
[1:16:54] power in the Holy Ghost cuz all
[1:16:58] witchcraft is is just a copycat of the
[1:17:01] real thing listen no no Kingdom was was
[1:17:07] was as dark as Egypt when it came to
[1:17:13] witchcraft and they were deep much
[1:17:15] deeper than any of us can imagine
[1:17:18] hallelujah what they had back in that
[1:17:21] day was wood wood with in comparison to
[1:17:23] what we got in our day would be like a
[1:17:26] kindergarten to a college graduate they
[1:17:30] didn't play and when Moses went up there
[1:17:33] God knew that Moses couldn't do it God
[1:17:35] had to do it and where did God start God
[1:17:40] without Moses even start knowing it God
[1:17:43] started with at the place where Egypt
[1:17:45] had its greatest power witchcraft
[1:17:50] hallelujah let me tell you something you
[1:17:53] don't even realize it but the battle the
[1:17:55] bride is fighting is being controlled by
[1:17:58] a witch you think and strange things
[1:18:02] happening to you you don't even know
[1:18:05] who's sitting to you that's why it's so
[1:18:08] important to have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:18:10] why it's important to have the gifts of
[1:18:12] God in here so God could identify Oh God
[1:18:18] have mercy that's why so many people
[1:18:20] don't want it because they know they can
[1:18:22] hide y'all we better wake up
[1:18:28] you better wake up hallelujah I've had
[1:18:32] experiences that I better not say right
[1:18:35] now but I've had experiences and I'm
[1:18:38] gonna tell you something greater is heat
[1:18:40] us in us then he that is in the world
[1:18:45] hmm
[1:18:47] I had a gifted brother come to my house
[1:18:49] one time and this person had for my
[1:18:51] birthday had given me some beautiful
[1:18:53] figurines costly and I really enjoyed it
[1:18:57] he's sleeping in my chair and God showed
[1:19:00] him a vision or whatever it was God
[1:19:03] showed him and says brother did you know
[1:19:06] there's something in your house he said
[1:19:10] if you don't believe me go break it up
[1:19:12] he said you tear it up and I tell you
[1:19:14] you'll see the reaction of no people and
[1:19:15] not only did they get mad they left
[1:19:21] thank God for the Holy Ghost this ain't
[1:19:27] nothing to play with is real
[1:19:30] hallelujah they think we strange but I
[1:19:32] tell you what people of God we are the
[1:19:34] original can I go on because we got to
[1:19:41] understand faith is of God you can't
[1:19:43] operate in the kingdom of God without
[1:19:45] faith faith is how God created
[1:19:47] everything and faith is not a thing
[1:19:50] faith is a person come on come on it oh
[1:19:54] it's the truth you know sometime I'm
[1:19:57] gonna tell you something while you have
[1:19:58] bad dreams some of you and I know you do
[1:20:01] because sometimes you bump into people
[1:20:03] all day and you don't even know it you
[1:20:07] know it's like anything you catch germs
[1:20:09] you pick up spirits you don't even know
[1:20:12] it
[1:20:13] that's why I try to tell people I go to
[1:20:14] bed saved every night I go to bed every
[1:20:18] night saved and I wake up every day save
[1:20:20] Wow cuz I wash I get down and I pray I
[1:20:29] can't tell you the last time I had a
[1:20:31] nightmare or a bad dream
[1:20:34] because I watched that filth off every
[1:20:37] day I'm telling you something now I'm
[1:20:41] trying to tell you that your peace amen
[1:20:43] is being interrupted at night at times
[1:20:45] because you don't pray before you go to
[1:20:48] bed I'm going one one way of worship
[1:20:57] y'all understand me I'm I'm way off
[1:20:59] anyway but God got me where he wants me
[1:21:01] hallelujah my question is what is your
[1:21:06] worship and what is your praise hmm
[1:21:13] because you got a worship it's not
[1:21:16] something that everyone can do the Bible
[1:21:22] says when when when Jesus meant that
[1:21:24] woman at the well he said the father
[1:21:26] seeketh those who who would worship Him
[1:21:30] in spirit and in truth
[1:21:33] so worship is not not just bowing down
[1:21:37] jumping and shouting and everything the
[1:21:39] greatest worship of a believer is to
[1:21:44] live or to let Christ live in you is
[1:21:50] that right oh it's the truth
[1:21:52] you came flat oh god if he can be
[1:21:54] flattered that all I'm saying is when he
[1:21:56] sees you living like him that pleases
[1:22:00] him hallelujah
[1:22:06] Davo have you considered my servant job
[1:22:11] what was about Joe
[1:22:13] it was his character it was what he was
[1:22:16] living he walked with God what was it
[1:22:21] his character hallelujah is this okay
[1:22:29] hallelujah but we we do one thing when
[1:22:34] they look around with all this power
[1:22:36] upon them they saw Jesus I'm going to
[1:22:39] the Mount Transfiguration experience so
[1:22:41] you can understand where I'm going and
[1:22:43] the real true believer don't care
[1:22:46] whether he he's backing up a
[1:22:48] denomination or nothing about it he only
[1:22:51] wants one thing for you to see the
[1:22:55] glorified Christ makes any difference
[1:23:00] right a real this is the points line a
[1:23:05] real true mouth figuration
[1:23:08] Transfiguration experience only
[1:23:10] glorifies Jesus Christ
[1:23:13] it didn't glorify Moses it didn't
[1:23:17] glorify Elijah it didn't glorify
[1:23:20] themselves
[1:23:21] it didn't glorify nothing else but they
[1:23:24] saying the glorified Christ hallelujah
[1:23:27] any true believer that's what it is in
[1:23:31] his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's
[1:23:35] what we're trying to get is that right
[1:23:37] you know why you say
[1:23:38] because they meant some way some how
[1:23:43] many people have committed treason
[1:23:51] treason to Christ we betrayed him come
[1:23:58] on somebody many of us have a greater
[1:24:02] love us we love certain other ones
[1:24:05] better than we love Christ treason
[1:24:08] people you know what that is that's
[1:24:10] worthy of death
[1:24:12] that's what Judas did he betrayed Christ
[1:24:15] What did he say you see what I'm saying
[1:24:21] come on somebody he Jesus Christ is the
[1:24:25] only one who died for you if you don't
[1:24:31] glorify Jesus Christ you are going to
[1:24:34] become a dead tree y'all know who says
[1:24:39] it's the truth the prophet of God was
[1:24:42] driven somewhere in the woods and he
[1:24:44] came again upon these trees they have
[1:24:47] been burnt over and all of a sudden wind
[1:24:50] came that's what dead people do these
[1:25:01] days these dead Christians they don't
[1:25:02] know they look at you too
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:10] they can't understand you but they had
[1:25:13] their chance opportunity then let Satan
[1:25:21] come in and destroy them then come to a
[1:25:25] place that King shout they can't dance
[1:25:27] he can run they can't say hallelujah and
[1:25:30] then they look down on you because when
[1:25:35] the wind blow you being hallelujah when
[1:25:38] the wind blow you move with the wind
[1:25:41] somebody help me
[1:25:43] I want to be that kind of a tree that
[1:25:46] way he blows I want to sway with it
[1:25:49] hallelujah give me a tree that got some
[1:25:53] life in it dead trees can't bring for
[1:25:58] him no blossom no blooms don't smell or
[1:26:00] nothing everything smell burnt over come

[1:34:12] about it
[1:34:13] I don't tired - I was tired I said that
[1:34:19] last night I said my voice and as soon
[1:34:20] as I said my voice was acting up my boss
[1:34:22] acted up I did that because I spoken
[1:34:28] hallelujah and just as soon as I said
[1:34:31] that I had trouble I said Lord forgive
[1:34:34] me but we're gonna fight tonight I went
[1:34:38] on to sing the song because I knew God
[1:34:40] wanted me to you understand me and
[1:34:43] that's about me I don't give up I'm a
[1:34:45] fighter I've been born a fighter
[1:34:52] hallelujah I'm in the laws army is that
[1:34:56] right
[1:34:57] we're here to fight and you've got
[1:34:59] depressed you yeah I can't stimulate you
[1:35:01] he can stimulate you if you take the
[1:35:04] words spoken God will stimulate you and
[1:35:07] bring you to the place we're looking for
[1:35:09] this morning
[1:35:12] Oh God help us here I'm almost done but
[1:35:17] I'm coming to a place because you know
[1:35:19] there was a man I think he he was a
[1:35:22] great Emperor something like a Caesar
[1:35:23] and he he wanted to honor his soldiers
[1:35:28] and everything and uh and so he put the
[1:35:32] bulletin out and and he put the bullet
[1:35:35] announce and all of the soldiers dressed
[1:35:37] up and got their little plumes together
[1:35:39] and everything you know how they're
[1:35:40] shining they little uh you know chariots
[1:35:43] and everything else and and they made
[1:35:45] this parade and but there was one guy
[1:35:47] hey man he he didn't have nothing you
[1:35:50] know he came in looking all raggedy and
[1:35:52] had all kinds of scars all over him and
[1:35:55] all the other ones thought that that the
[1:35:58] Caesar was gonna choose them but he he
[1:36:00] kept looking he has something in his
[1:36:01] mind he was looking for hallelujah then
[1:36:05] all of a sudden this one came up he said
[1:36:06] who are you sir I'm so so so so so I'm
[1:36:11] just you know in the army sir you know
[1:36:14] fighting for you how did you get those
[1:36:15] scars he said sir I just I was fighting
[1:36:20] to keep in the kingdom for you he said
[1:36:22] you're the one I won't come sit with me
[1:36:32] in his army
[1:36:35] in this battle
[1:36:39] I want to see some scars you understand
[1:36:46] me you can't be a Christian without
[1:36:48] scars proof you've been in the battle
[1:36:54] battle-scarred veterans that's what he
[1:36:58] wants to see how many you have scars
[1:37:01] from your battle scars because you stood
[1:37:05] up for Jesus and your family deserted
[1:37:08] you scars because they couldn't take you
[1:37:13] no longer on the job being a Jesus Freak
[1:37:16] don't some of us don't even know what
[1:37:18] that is we blend in so well sometime we
[1:37:23] go to jobs and act like camellias just
[1:37:26] blend right on in there God don't want
[1:37:30] us to blend in what fellowship that
[1:37:34] darkness have with light we need some
[1:37:39] scars y'all love the Lord I'm almost
[1:37:45] done but let me say it like this I get
[1:37:48] on that plane
[1:37:50] and I try to get the cheapest ticket I
[1:37:52] can
[1:37:53] and they always sit us in the back
[1:37:59] I'm telling when I buy a ticket because
[1:38:01] I figured you know using paying a lot of
[1:38:02] money
[1:38:05] on a plane flight unless you going
[1:38:07] overseas in as long you want some
[1:38:11] comfort
[1:38:12] but when you just find around here I
[1:38:16] figure those first class people
[1:38:20] don't get at the same time I do yeah
[1:38:27] that right ain't hurting my feeling
[1:38:30] because they separate my restroom from
[1:38:32] this I packed my lunch you know what I'm
[1:38:40] saying I think you're not messing with
[1:38:42] my mind with this nonsense just give me
[1:38:45] a cheap ticket hallelujah you know what
[1:38:53] I'm trying to say Satan comes right in
[1:38:56] the church and he'll do the same thing
[1:38:59] make a difference
[1:39:03] sets us in classes there ain't numbered
[1:39:07] one class but here separate us because
[1:39:14] of abilities hallelujah and I don't care
[1:39:20] the man at the back they're gonna get
[1:39:21] there just as soon as you get there cuz
[1:39:22] you understand when God calls for his
[1:39:25] bride we all coming up god I don't say
[1:39:29] this role first that role second no
[1:39:31] we're all coming up here to the church
[1:39:34] ages that way but when it comes to the
[1:39:36] bride he calls us by one name and we get
[1:39:39] up is that right so you can understand
[1:39:42] what I'm trying to say
[1:39:47] what is your worship gonna be how are
[1:39:50] you gonna worship so many things I've
[1:39:53] left out but humming to work how we
[1:39:56] gonna worship
[1:39:59] everybody can dance and shout and do
[1:40:02] everything in the club you know you can
[1:40:03] do all that and God knows I'm not
[1:40:06] against that y'all know that right y'all
[1:40:08] understand that I do that more than
[1:40:11] anybody else I think at least at my
[1:40:13] church anyway they look at me like I'm a
[1:40:16] show - okay I really don't care I cry
[1:40:22] and carry on just like crazy sometimes
[1:40:24] and sometimes after I doubt it's all
[1:40:26] over I get a little embarrassed a little
[1:40:27] bit to myself because of pride or
[1:40:29] whatever it is but for the most part
[1:40:34] spectacle or something but at the end of
[1:40:37] the day I know I can't force anything
[1:40:40] but I do know one thing God is trying to
[1:40:44] transform us I've been up here a long
[1:40:47] time and God has been trying to
[1:40:50] transform us change us we can't we can't
[1:40:54] sell it for the religion folk this is
[1:40:56] not what God called us for and I have
[1:41:00] I've had religion all my life mama you
[1:41:02] know the person who showed me that God
[1:41:04] was real was my mom hmm and my mother
[1:41:08] was an illiterate woman she couldn't
[1:41:10] read or write according to records she
[1:41:12] has 16 children
[1:41:16] you understand me my mom died at 56 and
[1:41:20] she looked like she was 75 because she
[1:41:23] works so hard you understand me
[1:41:27] but one thing my mom gave me that no
[1:41:30] education could possibly give me and
[1:41:32] that was Jesus you know how it wasn't it
[1:41:37] wasn't she couldn't just she couldn't
[1:41:39] just take the Bible and read it she
[1:41:41] couldn't read
[1:41:42] she said Junior come read the Bible for
[1:41:44] me I'll go read the Bible for my mom and
[1:41:46] she just rejoicing and everything else
[1:41:47] and I didn't understand one word I
[1:41:51] couldn't understand it
[1:41:53] ah my mother lives so holy I used to
[1:41:55] feel sorry for I said mom ain't nobody
[1:41:59] else living like that not even the
[1:42:01] preacher yeah cuz I saw the preacher
[1:42:06] yeah I saw the preacher ain't telling
[1:42:10] you but the point is I used to feel
[1:42:12] sorry for my mom but one day when she
[1:42:17] got really sick and about ready to go
[1:42:18] home because she had cancer of the liver
[1:42:23] we didn't know that it was a hereditary
[1:42:25] disease that they strike the ladies in
[1:42:27] our family until recently my niece had
[1:42:31] to have a liver transplant and now my
[1:42:33] sister has the same disease my mom had
[1:42:36] but the point is I saw my mom who she's
[1:42:40] a really fair skin like fair skinned
[1:42:42] woman colored or black or however you
[1:42:44] want to say it black American or
[1:42:48] American Way been English we are who we
[1:42:52] are
[1:42:55] God knows I've never been ashamed of Who
[1:42:57] I am
[1:42:57] and you shouldn't be ashamed of who you
[1:43:00] are I think there's beauty in every race
[1:43:05] so anyway my mother was where you could
[1:43:09] tell she was sick literally her eyes
[1:43:11] turned yellow
[1:43:12] and her skin turned yellow and she was
[1:43:15] just fragile she was like a she look
[1:43:17] like a wholly cost person but my mother
[1:43:22] told me she told me before she died she
[1:43:24] said God gonna save you and she told me
[1:43:27] exactly where I would be saved
[1:43:29] Church I would go to and she said God's
[1:43:31] gonna send a greater light to you she
[1:43:33] said whatever you do don't leave that
[1:43:35] Apostolic Church she said it's gonna be
[1:43:37] hard their time you're gonna get
[1:43:38] discouraged but God is gonna send a
[1:43:40] greater light that's what she called the
[1:43:43] message and sure enough God sent the
[1:43:47] greater light you understand what I'm
[1:43:50] saying now I'm saying all of that is
[1:43:53] because what I was mocking and what I
[1:43:56] was feeling sorry for was the thing that
[1:43:58] my mother loved dearly she loved God she
[1:44:05] would pray for hours yeah I go to school
[1:44:10] and come back home and my mom still in
[1:44:15] the restroom crying out and praying you
[1:44:20] understand me and you know I think to
[1:44:23] myself if I could just get a little bit
[1:44:27] just a little bit especially that prayer
[1:44:30] if she wasn't saying our father world
[1:44:33] and she was crying out for her children
[1:44:35] and everybody else and I said Lord if I
[1:44:37] could just get her I said I mean just a
[1:44:39] little bit with that hmm but it was real
[1:44:44] she was real you say oh you know I've
[1:44:47] heard people said well if she wasn't in
[1:44:48] the message she was in the message
[1:44:50] because she was in Christ and Christ is
[1:44:54] the message oh yeah I've seen her since
[1:44:58] then I know y'all say well you didn't
[1:45:00] see well whatever God was showing me she
[1:45:02] showed up that's the only way I can tell
[1:45:07] you but my point my point is I know
[1:45:10] she's not dead and what she gave me I
[1:45:16] saw a real God cuz she was basically
[1:45:19] paralyzed almost and she said Lord Jesus
[1:45:22] just let me go to the bathroom one more
[1:45:25] time that's all she asked and she had to
[1:45:28] have a little bit of help my sister got
[1:45:30] understand she couldn't walk my mom
[1:45:32] walked to the bathroom and my mouth
[1:45:34] dropped because I saw God for the first
[1:45:38] time I saw a supernatural being
[1:45:42] helped my mom move when she was supposed
[1:45:46] to never move again
[1:45:48] and it was that day I said to myself
[1:45:51] Lord if I ever become a Christian I want
[1:45:57] to serve to God that mybama soon I saw
[1:46:03] God real for the first time and she had
[1:46:07] no education but there were times she
[1:46:09] said junior we had we were poor my daddy
[1:46:11] left us like he did even had to raise
[1:46:13] all those kids work all week and some
[1:46:16] time I didn't even know when she'd come
[1:46:18] home like sisters raised us but junior
[1:46:21] daddy's mama mama done showed me
[1:46:23] something I mean a garden showed myself
[1:46:26] don't worry Junior we have food here
[1:46:28] just before you leave mister truth and I
[1:46:31] would go outside I was on my way out the
[1:46:33] door and here is somebody done bought
[1:46:35] groceries and sitting on the porch
[1:46:41] that's God that's the kind of God I like
[1:46:45] that's the one I love that when you in
[1:46:48] need he supplies your knees huh he comes
[1:46:53] at a time you least expected but if you
[1:46:56] trust him he'll be there
[1:46:58] y'all understand me I'm not interested
[1:47:02] in serving a dead God I need a real one
[1:47:04] I need to see him living in me everyday
[1:47:11] not sometimes every day and he wants to
[1:47:16] do it and I want him to do it why do you
[1:47:20] think I'm here today it was God who sent
[1:47:23] me here I had other issues going on at
[1:47:26] my house I could have stayed home but
[1:47:29] God told me he wanted me to be here
[1:47:31] listen people move the veil don't look
[1:47:34] at me listen to what's being preached
[1:47:37] that's Christ hallelujah is God speaking
[1:47:41] to you
[1:47:45] hallelujah don't take your eyes off
[1:47:48] Jesus now hallelujah keep your eyes on
[1:47:53] the Lord Jesus hallelujah
[1:47:57] because just as soon as you take your
[1:47:59] eyes off of him you're going to sink and
[1:48:04] you say oh I got trouble you ain't had
[1:48:05] no more trouble than Peter did when he
[1:48:07] asked Jesus that Lord didn't become you
[1:48:10] talking about walking on water y'all
[1:48:12] you've seen how the waves and everything
[1:48:14] - and how bad they are and listen like I
[1:48:17] said he wasn't walking on a plane he was
[1:48:20] walking on water
[1:48:21] that was bolster us what about us
[1:48:31] whatsoever you do in word or deed and I
[1:48:34] am closing do it all in the name of the
[1:48:37] Lord Jesus whatsoever you do in word or
[1:48:40] deed do it all in the name of the Lord
[1:48:43] Jesus hallelujah
[1:48:46] i'ma saying again whatsoever you do in
[1:48:49] word or deed that's worship do it all in
[1:48:52] the name of Jesus people say I've had a
[1:48:55] hard day today my question is did you
[1:48:57] acknowledge the Lord today because the
[1:49:01] Bible said if you acknowledge him in all
[1:49:03] your ways he will direct your path an
[1:49:09] often time we don't talk a talk to the
[1:49:11] Lord about what we're gonna do in the
[1:49:12] day and so therefore he can't give us
[1:49:14] information on what not to do but if you
[1:49:19] acknowledge the Lord God will direct
[1:49:22] your path hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:49:32] so demons are real how you gonna fight
[1:49:38] them off without the Holy Ghost
[1:49:43] did you know bad habits or bad spirits
[1:49:49] is that right
[1:49:50] a habit is something you can't control
[1:49:52] it's something I have to do and when
[1:49:55] you've got to have it if it's a bad
[1:49:57] habit it's a bad spirit and if it's a
[1:50:00] bad spirit we called them demons and
[1:50:03] Devils whoo in the vision of the United
[1:50:08] States prophet of God said there be
[1:50:11] Christians packing demons cease or
[1:50:16] any-any ain't gonna do no none of us
[1:50:18] good
[1:50:19] it means we go sit up there and act like
[1:50:20] oh I'm all right well I'm righteous I'm
[1:50:24] holy and all of us need some washing
[1:50:28] there are things that in our lives that
[1:50:31] you know all about and God is saying
[1:50:33] okay this is your time this is your
[1:50:35] opportunity hallelujah and understand if
[1:50:40] God is saying this don't reject him
[1:50:42] because this moment will be replayed
[1:50:46] remember when I came by is that right
[1:50:49] you don't think it's gonna be replayed
[1:50:50] it will be replayed whether you here or
[1:50:53] there is that right because when Jesus
[1:50:56] descended into the Lord region when he
[1:50:59] went to hell he preached to the souls
[1:51:01] that were in prison and he said why did
[1:51:05] not you listen to Noah that wasn't nor
[1:51:08] that was me
[1:51:12] he loved the Lord
[1:51:15] that's just bound a word of Prayer dear
[1:51:20] Jesus
[1:51:22] we know Lord God that you're real and
[1:51:26] father we know that you are God
[1:51:33] sir we come to you
[1:51:37] we ask you God because you can do in
[1:51:39] just a moment the words that have been
[1:51:42] spoken I believe by your grace that you
[1:51:46] gave me these words to speak this
[1:51:48] morning and lord if the people could see
[1:51:51] that in order to fully worship you in
[1:51:55] the way you desire we must bear your
[1:51:59] character your spirit it's not just the
[1:52:03] anointing on the flesh that's gonna do
[1:52:05] it anymore
[1:52:06] not just dawning on the Spirit it must
[1:52:08] be done in the soul father help us hear
[1:52:12] that we will we would break beyond this
[1:52:16] veil there's something or God that we we
[1:52:20] it just seem like it's I don't know Lord
[1:52:22] you know but father I it's not that God
[1:52:25] can do it's got to be in the people's
[1:52:28] hearts we got to want this more than we
[1:52:32] want life we can't allow the devil to
[1:52:35] feel okay I got pray for yesterday and
[1:52:37] so I'm alright today not unless you came
[1:52:40] to complete victory and when a man comes
[1:52:44] to complete victory he or she will know
[1:52:47] it lord help us tonight or this morning
[1:52:52] we humble ourselves before your Lord we
[1:52:57] pray father God this morning
[1:53:01] that you break the yolks of the enemy
[1:53:04] Lord the word has been sown and we pray
[1:53:08] father God that you be merciful be
[1:53:12] merciful to us this morning
[1:53:13] let your grace be upon us Lord God we
[1:53:19] thank your father we thank you for your
[1:53:22] grace in your mercy let your perfect
[1:53:25] will be done Lord
[1:53:27] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:53:35] you
[1:53:40] you
[1:53:44] mmm
[1:53:49] you'll always be my song
[1:53:56] or it was grace that brought my liver
[1:54:03] tea I'll never know just how he came to
[1:54:16] love me so he'll be on all of my father
[1:54:25] and so money I shall forever mine are to
[1:54:41] Calvary Chile the cross where Jesus died
[1:54:53] for Li hao MA
[1:55:03] that grace that called life holy so he
[1:55:13] looked beyond my thoughts and saw I
[1:55:25] shall I shall live my life to Calvary TV
[1:55:42] the cry
[1:55:45] where Jesus died for me how
[1:55:59] that way that call my fallen soul healer
[1:56:11] beyond my fault and so let me say this
[1:56:21] this morning I don't know your lives I
[1:56:26] don't know what you do and what you
[1:56:28] don't do but God does and when I
[1:56:34] minister by God's grace I just tried to
[1:56:36] say two things he would want me to say I
[1:56:41] know for a fact that when we working
[1:56:47] from the pulpit sometimes you might
[1:56:51] think that somebody's picking on you or
[1:56:55] singling you out and I want to say
[1:56:58] that's the devil it's God who knows your
[1:57:03] life his God who pulls this God who
[1:57:06] tries to draw
[1:57:12] we are in a time that time is short and
[1:57:16] I know I probably said a lot of things
[1:57:18] that perhaps some may not have
[1:57:20] understood but I'm a missionary I love
[1:57:26] people I love people I hate Satan I hate
[1:57:36] what he do to us
[1:57:39] he's an evil beyond evil person
[1:57:45] he's a destroyer
[1:57:49] and God said I came to give you life and
[1:57:53] that you may have it more abundantly
[1:57:58] there was a time I was a sinner I didn't
[1:58:03] know him I used to have believe it or
[1:58:08] not long hair and you know I I remember
[1:58:14] going to the church when I had all this
[1:58:18] hair and I thought man I can't get
[1:58:20] baptized a car that's gonna mess it up
[1:58:26] and you know that evening I had to come
[1:58:30] right back to the place I left when I
[1:58:35] got baptized one of my old friends from
[1:58:39] the world was dead I didn't even know I
[1:58:41] don't think he was saved I may have
[1:58:43] heard by rumor and when I went in there
[1:58:48] and I saw him and I I thought he was the
[1:58:51] biggest pimp ever who in high school
[1:58:55] wear white suits with white shoes and
[1:58:59] big hats and I said to him oh if God can
[1:59:06] save you I know he can save me and when
[1:59:13] I got baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:59:16] Jesus you could believe this or not
[1:59:21] but when I came up out of the water I
[1:59:23] saw all these life similar to these but
[1:59:26] they were everywhere everywhere in this
[1:59:29] little room and I began to scream see
[1:59:32] the light see all those lights all those
[1:59:35] lights momently at the moment I was
[1:59:38] baptized I became insane cuz nobody
[1:59:44] could see the lights with me but I
[1:59:45] didn't know it I thought everybody saw
[1:59:47] the light oh my god
[1:59:52] never saw that light again those lights
[1:59:55] again until I came to this message all
[1:59:59] people it's real I just wish I could
[2:00:03] give give what I have to to let others
[2:00:09] see and know how true it is I stumbled
[2:00:13] in life because I saw my mom live a holy
[2:00:16] life and I used to try I did I tried and
[2:00:20] I would fall on my face all the time I
[2:00:22] didn't know what I know nothing about
[2:00:23] the Holy Ghost I didn't know the Holy
[2:00:25] Ghost would change that I didn't know
[2:00:27] the Holy Ghost which strengthened me and
[2:00:29] take those desires away I didn't know
[2:00:31] that I thought Christianity was human
[2:00:33] effort and I found out I couldn't do it
[2:00:36] I just couldn't do it that was the thing
[2:00:40] I system to get my mom like how do you
[2:00:42] do that I couldn't do it but when I
[2:00:45] found out about the Holy Ghost she told
[2:00:48] me but I was afraid of it
[2:00:50] that was my mama get all in the spirit
[2:00:53] and be jerking and it looked like it
[2:00:54] hurt
[2:00:57] so it scared me she didn't know what she
[2:01:00] couldn't help it
[2:01:01] my mom came home one time speaking in
[2:01:04] tongues and everybody thought she was
[2:01:05] having a fit yeah you know how they did
[2:01:08] it they put on the flow and put a spoon
[2:01:10] in the mouth it was just a grace of God
[2:01:12] that God didn't wipe us out but we
[2:01:15] didn't know we were Baptist forgive me
[2:01:20] for saying I could we didn't know about
[2:01:24] that stuff and it took her a while to
[2:01:26] come back to herself and says don't ever
[2:01:28] do that again she tried to explain to us
[2:01:31] but when I got it oh my he would tell me
[2:01:46] you don't have it you don't have it yet
[2:01:47] and I mean God had already started to
[2:01:49] change in my life sanctifying you know
[2:01:50] you know I used to help I hope this is
[2:01:53] OK this favorite drink I come home from
[2:01:57] church and my my brother Logue done took
[2:01:59] it out of refrigerate he bringing it up
[2:02:01] to me I didn't have no desire he didn't
[2:02:05] know ha ha he didn't understand the
[2:02:08] garden and took all that out of me y'all
[2:02:10] understand me I understand I worked at a
[2:02:13] club I drink whenever I wanted to y'all
[2:02:19] you mean I was hooked let me put it
[2:02:22] better that way and God in a moment's
[2:02:26] time
[2:02:28] took it from me I know what God can do I
[2:02:35] look at people I said oh you just have
[2:02:38] no idea - joy that's in this thing's you
[2:02:44] you that tormented you all your life
[2:02:46] y'all know what I'm saying abuse is see
[2:02:52] when you start going there people get
[2:02:54] quiet but more than 99% of us have been
[2:02:58] been abused in some way and only the
[2:03:03] Holy Ghost can rip that out of you
[2:03:14] there are things in my life I thought
[2:03:16] I'd never overcome but thanks be to God
[2:03:23] he just didn't help me overcome he took
[2:03:25] it all the way only God can do that
[2:03:32] there's not one person in my life
[2:03:35] I can say I hate I even love those who
[2:03:40] didn't love me those who abuse me I
[2:03:44] loved him what are you saying brother
[2:03:47] Maya Taylor - I only God could have done
[2:03:49] that for me my daddy hated me
[2:04:01] he was a Muslim and he saw me going in
[2:04:05] the way of a Christian he made me know
[2:04:09] he hated me think about a child having
[2:04:14] to live under a daddy who hates him I
[2:04:20] suffered for that for years lot of my
[2:04:24] decisions in life were bad decisions
[2:04:26] because of him one day I'd even realize
[2:04:31] that thing was affecting me still I was
[2:04:33] coming home from a church service oh
[2:04:36] pardon me wasn't a church service God
[2:04:39] has shown me in the dream my daddy was
[2:04:41] gonna die I didn't know when but I saw
[2:04:44] it in a dream and the dream is real
[2:04:46] whenever my dreams are real and no need
[2:04:48] to interpret it I know it's true so I
[2:04:51] told the church in Iowa said my dad is
[2:04:53] gonna die don't know when he's gonna die
[2:04:55] I don't know why I'm saying these things
[2:04:57] but then I said I gotta go see him one
[2:05:02] of the sisters felt checked about me
[2:05:03] going to see him but I started on my way
[2:05:07] and and and and my daddy you said well
[2:05:10] what about which I see my daddy married
[2:05:13] after leaving my mom the way he did he
[2:05:15] married a woman that was a witch and
[2:05:18] when I say that I mean a real witch
[2:05:20] ain't talked about the ones who trying
[2:05:22] to be a wannabe she was a real one she
[2:05:25] could change the images on a on a
[2:05:28] photograph
[2:05:30] my wife didn't believe me but I told him
[2:05:33] then I then then it was proven but
[2:05:34] anyway this lady even when I was a child
[2:05:37] tried to curse me and God put all that
[2:05:40] back to my mind me meeting this lady who
[2:05:43] was supposed to have been my aunt trying
[2:05:46] to put spells on me even as a child she
[2:05:49] hated me then and she made my daddy hate
[2:05:52] me so I'm going to see my daddy I got on
[2:05:57] the phone with my daddy and he started
[2:05:59] reeling me out all I ever tried to do
[2:06:03] was be good to him
[2:06:05] and all I got was Kirstie's from him
[2:06:08] think about I'm already hurting
[2:06:11] I'm already rejected from my daddy all
[2:06:14] these years and I would have taken care
[2:06:16] of him if he would have allowed me to
[2:06:18] but all of these things went on in my
[2:06:20] life and I can remember going down the
[2:06:25] highway because the law stayed that
[2:06:27] sister called me says brother Brooke she
[2:06:29] says I really believe God don't want you
[2:06:31] to go see him I said sister I really
[2:06:34] believe you right because I called him
[2:06:36] and he carried on so bad I really
[2:06:37] believed that he would have killed me if
[2:06:39] I had gone he was screaming and
[2:06:41] hollering at me as if I put some kind of
[2:06:43] bad stuff on him and I know that's what
[2:06:45] his wife must I don't know how to know
[2:06:47] that but for some reason he felt like I
[2:06:49] was the cause of his problem needless to
[2:06:54] say I saw my daddy being buried and we
[2:06:58] wouldn't find out that he had been
[2:07:00] buried until after he was buried and it
[2:07:01] happened just that way but coming home I
[2:07:05] cried out I couldn't hardly see the road
[2:07:08] crying out to the Lord God take this
[2:07:11] away from me I'm tired of my daddy's
[2:07:15] influence in my life take this away from
[2:07:19] me Oh God and I began to cry and cry and
[2:07:23] cry and I says God I don't even know why
[2:07:27] these things has happened to me Lord why
[2:07:31] my daddy don't love me
[2:07:34] and God said to me I fixed it this way
[2:07:40] so that I can be the father that you
[2:07:42] never had and I said Lord be my father
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:12] my mother died when I was going to my
[2:08:15] senior year in high school so anyway
[2:08:23] when he said that such a piece came over
[2:08:26] my soul I have never been influenced by
[2:08:31] him since see those kinds of things
[2:08:34] don't you don't have to be around to
[2:08:36] influence you because it's a spirit
[2:08:41] [Music]
[2:08:45] those of us who've been born in a
[2:08:48] message and don't know what I'm talking
[2:08:49] about you blessed

[2:08:53] I've had to go through in life or a dog
[2:08:55] or anybody or anything but I just want
[2:08:59] to say that God has a deliverer gotta be
[2:09:03] the friend that you thought you'd never
[2:09:04] have when I need a song he sends me a
[2:09:09] song when I need confidence he talks to
[2:09:12] me and that's what God wants to be
[2:09:18] you're all in all tonight that's what we
[2:09:21] have not been allowing him to do we fail
[2:09:24] in that area he wants to be your all and
[2:09:27] you're afraid to let him be your own and
[2:09:32] God wants to conquer that in you tonight

[2:09:37] lean on him completely 100% everybody

[2:09:57] know how to express ourselves
[2:09:58] emotionally because of what we've gone
[2:10:00] through in the past God won't fix all of
[2:10:04] that in order to go forward you got to
[2:10:06] lay it down with that right God told
