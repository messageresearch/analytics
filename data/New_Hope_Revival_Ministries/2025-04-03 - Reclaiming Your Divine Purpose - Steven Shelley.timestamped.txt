[0:01] they formed a God that was more like
[0:05] them than the god of the Bible did you
[0:08] know that's the very motive of religion
[0:10] in this hour to recreate a God in the
[0:14] image of
[0:16] man that's not what happened in the
[0:18] beginning in the beginning God made a
[0:20] man in the image of God and a man fell
[0:26] and so God came down and walked as a man
[0:30] that he might restore man back to the
[0:33] place of authority that he was given in
[0:36] the beginning made in the image and the
[0:39] likeness of almighty God a god with a
[0:43] little G the prophet tells us a god with
[0:47] a portion of deity in him a man with a
[0:51] portion of deity in him making him a
[0:53] little G God it's so scriptural that the
[0:56] New Testament tells us that those who
[0:58] receive that trans formation will have
[1:01] the power to forgive
[1:03] sin or to retain
[1:07] sin these are the ambassadors of God in
[1:11] the end time these are the god men of
[1:14] the last age and we can say and women
[1:17] because this is not a genderless message
[1:20] this is the manifestation of the sons of
[1:23] God that the world gets so bent out of
[1:26] shape on because perhaps okay it has
[1:28] been taken out of context and misused
[1:31] but the reality is the same the
[1:33] scripture tells us that all of creation
[1:36] is groaning for the full
[1:40] manifestation of the god
[1:43] men the sons of God to come forth oh
[1:48] they're the children of the
[1:50] Manchild they are The Offspring of the
[1:53] of the original the one who who became
[1:56] the perfect one right
[2:00] he wasn't the perfect one as soon as he
[2:03] condescended into flesh he was then no
[2:06] longer 100% perfect his Spirit was his
[2:11] flesh not that's why the Bible said
[2:14] though he were a
[2:16] son yet he had to
[2:18] learn he learned
[2:21] Perfection by the things he suffered oh
[2:24] what an example folks God loved us so
[2:27] much he loves us so much he loved us so
[2:32] much in the beginning that he he devised
[2:34] a plan that that's the greatest plan
[2:37] it's the best deal I'm telling you if
[2:38] you don't want no part of it you are
[2:40] losing out you are missing out brother
[2:42] this relationship with God to become
[2:45] what he created us to be in the
[2:47] beginning it's a process it's a battle
[2:49] it's not all easy it's full of Hard
[2:51] Knocks and high places and Low Places
[2:53] and Curves in the road and valleys and
[2:55] mountain tops and hills and abs and flow
[2:58] and the river flow all that stuff
[3:01] and yet it's worth it all to be made
[3:05] like him you don't have to pull God down
[3:07] to understand him he came down he
[3:11] condescended so that you could be filled
[3:14] with who he is
