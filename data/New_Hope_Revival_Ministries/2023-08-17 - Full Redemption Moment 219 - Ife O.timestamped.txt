[0:03] foreign
[0:06] I want to tell you one of the most
[0:08] important things that you can cultivate
[0:10] in your relationship with God is Trust
[0:14] if we can learn to trust him and folks
[0:17] has he ever given us a reason not to
[0:19] trust
[0:19] then why in our human element do we
[0:21] struggle so to believe that he always
[0:23] has our best in mind he constantly has
[0:26] our best in mind whether it looks like
[0:28] it or not you see the serpent began his
[0:31] assault on the human Mind by injecting
[0:35] it without
[0:36] Satan gained his way in by touching the
[0:40] carnality of Eve by using her Earthly
[0:44] nature to do so he inserted the seed of
[0:48] discrepancy and he then had a Channel
[0:50] with which to give her knowledge
[0:53] obtained in an illegal way and the fruit
[0:57] which was the price to pay of that
[0:59] excess was death I want you to know that
[1:02] was the most expensive exchange that had
[1:04] ever taken place because by believing
[1:07] that lie and yielding her mind and body
[1:11] to that lie death entered into the
[1:15] picture
[1:15] we know that death was not a part of
[1:18] God's original plan for Adam and Eve are
[1:21] you with me
[1:22] it's not how it was
[1:27] allowing this to transpire he would be
[1:30] able to come and redeem all mankind
[1:34] and so it was a part of the Redemption
[1:36] plan but originally Adam was made the
[1:40] prophet even tells us that Adam was made
[1:42] to never die but because this seed of
[1:46] discrepancy was injected death gained
[1:50] access to the sons of God now he would
[1:54] always have something in her from that
[1:57] moment on there would always be a
[2:00] representation of that lie that Eve
[2:03] carried around in her and since she
[2:06] didn't know full Redemption like you do
[2:07] did you know that full Redemption is
[2:10] possible today so that when Satan comes
[2:13] to try to find an access point in your
[2:16] life there is none
[2:18] how many of you want to live under the
[2:20] fullness of redemption
[2:22] we're not living there fully like we
[2:24] need to because all the enemy has to do
[2:26] is March up and we and he knows the
[2:29] place he knows our weakness he knows our
[2:33] vulnerability he knows where we now he
[2:36] knows where we struggle he knows what
[2:38] emotion to play on
[2:40] because if the enemy could have come in
[2:43] and placed a seed of discrepancy in our
[2:46] Lord we would have been in trouble
[2:49] Jesus had confidence in the word that he
[2:51] was
[2:53] and he knew that Satan was coming and he
[2:56] knew that when Satan got there it wasn't
[2:58] going to be man to meet him it was going
[3:00] to be God the word to meet him and the
[3:03] word will shut down the devil anytime of
[3:06] the day the word will shut down the
[3:09] devil even in the Midnight Hour anytime
[3:12] anywhere under any condition the word
[3:16] will shut down the LIE of the devil
