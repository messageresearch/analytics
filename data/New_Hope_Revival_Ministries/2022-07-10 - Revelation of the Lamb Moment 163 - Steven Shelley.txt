Description:
The importance of Abel’s sacrifice was in that he received the revelation that it took more than just animal life to bring complete redemption.  His sacrifice was a shadow of what was to come under the law of Moses, that would eventually lead up to the ‘total deliverance and remission of sin’ that could only be provided by the spotless Lamb, the blood that was shed on Calvary.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
how do you and I think that we can get by in this last hour without a revelation [Music] able was a loving Shepherd cared for his sheep but there was one [Music] he had a pet lamb he had one that he loved above the others and when it come time to offer an offering to God he wanted to give God something that meant something to him Cain couldn't care less about the carrots he was proud of him because he'd done a good job growing them but I ever loved the slam this was the sweetest lamb the most special lamb the most beautiful eyes of any lamb that Abel had ever raised in his flock and when it came time to build an altar and offer a sacrifice to God he didn't want to give God just one of the crowd just one of the group he wanted to bring to God something that meant so much to him why would he do that why would he do that it's real simple Abel had a revelation that one day the blood of an innocent lamb was going to cry out on behalf of the sins of the entire world the Bible called him a prophet prophetic in the sense that he caught a revelation of how my Redemption was going to come and he was a type of what was to come the innocent spotless Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world out from the midst of the of the throne came a lamb as it had been slain from the very foundation of the world and Abel caught up [Music] oh Abel got [Music] English is my language of choice he got caught up in the glory of the Revelation and he said if my offering is going to be a a type a symbol of the offering if my little lamb is going to be a prophetic representation of the great lamb of of powerful then it must be the finest lamb the most beautiful lamb and it must be the one that means the most to me strips down a grapevine rips it down off of and he begins to make himself a little rope braids him a little rope and he ties that rope around the Little Lamb's neck and he begins to lead him over to the altar that he has built and he sits down around that Altar and he lays that lamb down and how many of you know if a little animal like that doesn't want to lay down it's going to try it's best to get up again and he just tried his best without being cruel you say cruel he's about to kill the lamb please understand if that lamb could no more redeem and cleanse Abel it's not that animal life that was going to bring able to complete Redemption but this was a shadow of what was to come under the law of Moses that provided a covering for sin that would later lead to a total remission of sin when the blood of the Spotless lamb of Calvary was shed you follow the type right he lays sits down and he lays out uh lamb down on the on the ledge or the edge of that altar there is no Smith there is no sharp knife just picks up a a jagged Rock and he says I've got to make this as quick and as painless as possible somebody said when you tell stories like that it turned my stomach I hope it turned your stomach so many ways I I do I hope I hope that you have to swallow before I'm through telling it because I want you to understand the magnitude of the Revelation that Mabel had received and that I wanted to do you and I think that we can get by in this last hour without a revelation [Music] how can we overcome without a personal revelation of the Lamb of Calvary and what he has done for us how can we live without the power of the Holy Ghost within us how can we keep moving on without total Deliverance when it's promised to us in the same sacrifice hmm [Music]
