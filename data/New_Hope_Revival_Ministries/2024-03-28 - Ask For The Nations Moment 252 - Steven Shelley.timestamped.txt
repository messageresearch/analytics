[0:00] we see the enemy touching our family uh
[0:03] it's easy to just focus on that maybe we
[0:05] maybe we go a little bit beyond that and
[0:07] we're looking at the church and we're
[0:09] praying for our brothers and sisters in
[0:11] the church but God wants us concerned
[0:14] about our region he wants us concerned
[0:17] about our neighborhood he wants us
[0:19] concerned about our state he wants us
[0:23] praying and showing love uh concerning
[0:26] our nation the United States of America
[0:29] and he wants us to be praying for the
[0:32] nations of the world we're faithful to
[0:35] pray for Israel but how many of you know
[0:37] there's quite a few other nations out
[0:39] there and as sister Ruth would often
[0:42] sing I ask for the Nations and I call
[0:46] them by name and I present them to the
[0:49] father in jesus' name and so when God
[0:54] lets a nation roll through your mind
[0:57] there may be a more more of a reason for
[0:59] it than just keeping up with the news it
[1:02] may be that God is trying to give you an
[1:05] opportunity to pray it's a it's an
[1:08] opportunity in fact it's a privilege to
[1:11] be called to carry a prayer assignment
[1:14] for a
[1:15] nation and you wonder what difference
[1:18] one person can make in a great big old
[1:21] Nation but how many of you have read the
[1:23] book you've read the Bible and you know
[1:26] that just a few praying faithful
[1:29] intercessors can shift governments come
[1:33] on and we've seen what intercession can
[1:36] do we've watched intercession interrupt
[1:40] uh secret messages between uh Nations I
[1:45] I don't want to go too far into that but
[1:47] we've seen God do that we've seen God
[1:49] break off communication we've seen God
[1:52] temporarily shut down communication
[1:55] coming out of North Korea and and we've
[1:58] watched it and and some of the things
[2:00] that prayer has done we we'll never get
[2:03] a trophy for it here we we you'll never
[2:06] get an Accolade here prayer and
[2:08] intercession is one of the most
[2:09] thankless Ministries that you can have
[2:12] in this hour but I want you to know your
[2:14] reward when you get out of here what
[2:18] what Earth has discounted Heaven values
[2:21] and many of you are going to have
[2:23] rewards in eternity uh that you didn't
[2:26] know were coming and it's going to be
[2:28] because you took a burden for another
[2:31] Nation for another family for another
[2:35] region for another church do you know
[2:37] it's all right for you to be concerned
[2:39] about another church and pray for other
[2:41] churches and not just ours please don't
[2:45] uh forget about us while you're taking
[2:48] another assignment but I don't only want
[2:51] God to finish his work here I want him
[2:53] to finish his work in every church that
[2:56] he raised up if man raised it up it's up
[2:59] to God to take care but if God raised it
[3:02] up I want to see every God ordained
[3:05] purpose fulfilled in that church or in
[3:08] that
[3:16] Ministry
