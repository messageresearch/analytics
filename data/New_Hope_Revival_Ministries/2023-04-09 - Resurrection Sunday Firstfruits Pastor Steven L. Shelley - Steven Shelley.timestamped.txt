[58:00] before we do that I want to say how good

[59:20] I want to say something I can't remember
[59:23] if I read it
[59:26] I heard it
[59:28] or it was I think
[59:30] it might have been the movie that uh
[59:33] Corey Chen boom
[59:36] said something
[59:38] I heard it this week
[59:41] I don't know what day
[59:43] but she said something that really
[59:46] resonated with me
[59:49] and I thought it might be helpful
[59:52] to you on down the road
[59:57] I try not to do anything to anybody that
[1:00:00] don't help them
[1:00:01] so I just wanted to speak this to you
[1:00:04] pray that you'll hold it in your heart
[1:00:08] for the days ahead
[1:00:11] you know they got lice
[1:00:14] and her sister was kind of disturbed
[1:00:16] about it you know but she told her she
[1:00:19] said you know we just have to thank the
[1:00:22] Lord for everything
[1:00:24] and we do we have to thank him for
[1:00:27] everything it don't matter how bad or
[1:00:29] good or whatever
[1:00:30] we have to thank him for it
[1:00:32] and it turned out that because they had
[1:00:35] lice they were able to read the word of
[1:00:38] God and Worship the Lord and to pray
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:43] so you know when something happens to us
[1:00:46] we just thank the Lord for it

[1:00:52] cause y'all just like my children you
[1:00:54] know and I would tell my own children
[1:00:57] whatever the Lord does
[1:00:59] whatever he brings your way thank him

[1:07:32] [Applause]
[1:07:37] Hallelujah
[1:07:44] although we weren't here last week
[1:07:48] we come today bringing our offering to
[1:07:51] the Lord
[1:07:52] for the principle of the mortgage of
[1:07:54] this building this property
[1:07:57] God has been faithful to us to help us
[1:08:00] get this mortgage paid down
[1:08:04] as of today there has been some given
[1:08:07] through the week even though we weren't
[1:08:09] here and the total that has been given
[1:08:13] now stands at 299
[1:08:16] 455 dollars and 84 cents isn't the Lord
[1:08:20] so good to us
[1:08:22] how faithful he is
[1:08:24] [Applause]
[1:08:31] you may have noticed
[1:08:34] there were quite a few ruts that were in
[1:08:37] the property there in front of Hawk and
[1:08:39] marybeth's house
[1:08:41] and uh a trucker apparently could not
[1:08:44] read the sign that said stay off of the
[1:08:46] grass
[1:08:47] and decided to
[1:08:50] take a detour through it lift quite a
[1:08:52] few ruts that company paid to have that
[1:08:56] fixed although they were dragging their
[1:08:58] feet because they said they couldn't
[1:09:00] find anyone and finally called them and
[1:09:04] our newest company has fixed that well
[1:09:08] in the meantime there was a sinkhole
[1:09:10] that was discovered in that front yard
[1:09:13] nine feet deep about five feet in
[1:09:16] diameter may have been there all along I
[1:09:19] don't know but because of those ruts it
[1:09:22] was discovered we were able to get it
[1:09:24] filled in and get that mess cleaned up
[1:09:26] and we're thankful to the Lord for that
[1:09:28] that could be taken care of and that no
[1:09:31] one was hurt no one was injured because
[1:09:33] of that hole it's kind of surprising
[1:09:35] that the truck didn't fall into it
[1:09:37] because it was large enough that the
[1:09:39] wheel of the truck should have fell down
[1:09:41] in it but it did not and so the goodness
[1:09:44] of God we're just so thankful for his
[1:09:46] goodness today if you brought your
[1:09:48] offering with you would you put it in
[1:09:50] your hand we just want to pray and ask
[1:09:52] God's blessing over you and
[1:09:55] multiplication of whatever he wants to
[1:09:57] do with this we're just looking at 2023
[1:10:00] this Supernatural year that this
[1:10:03] mortgage will be taken care of father I
[1:10:06] thank you for faithful people that bring
[1:10:08] their tithe and offering we also bless
[1:10:11] those that have given online Lord I pray
[1:10:14] your richest blessing on them as they
[1:10:17] have kept Covenant with you with tithe
[1:10:19] and with offering now Lord we brought
[1:10:22] our uh offering and some have also given
[1:10:25] that online and so we're just asking for
[1:10:28] your blessing on The Giver in the name
[1:10:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ and I pray Lord
[1:10:35] that you will multiply this and that
[1:10:38] this debt would snowball quickly that it
[1:10:41] would be behind us that we can do what
[1:10:44] you have called us to do we give you the
[1:10:47] glory and the honor and the praise for
[1:10:49] you are the worthy one and it is because
[1:10:52] of you that we live and move and have
[1:10:54] our being we have that which we have
[1:10:58] been given financially to be able to
[1:11:00] live in this life and we want to give
[1:11:02] you the Praise In The Name Of The Lord
[1:11:05] Jesus Christ we pray amen Ian would you
[1:11:08] be willing to come and hold the offering
[1:11:10] bag as we give our offering to the Lord
[1:11:13] today

[1:14:18] didn't hear me
[1:14:21] he's wonderful
[1:14:24] and worthy to be praised
[1:14:28] he deserves all we can give him and more
[1:14:32] he is so precious to us we are so
[1:14:36] thankful to be here today
[1:14:39] to feel as good as we do
[1:14:42] it is the grace of God
[1:14:44] we had no idea
[1:14:47] when I left here Saturday night I was
[1:14:49] tired from preaching and by the way
[1:14:52] we've had testimonies all week long of
[1:14:54] what God did for people Saturday night
[1:14:57] so I'm thankful for that
[1:14:59] I had no idea and a little after
[1:15:02] midnight sometime the first ones at our
[1:15:05] house started making the trip
[1:15:07] and this is too much information
[1:15:13] disclosure
[1:15:16] but Jenna will tell you
[1:15:20] Jenna says I'm a Shelley I am in every
[1:15:25] way but she said except one
[1:15:27] and uh that means she has a different
[1:15:29] way of being sick than than most of my
[1:15:32] family
[1:15:34] she she really is a little maybe a
[1:15:36] little closer to how I am sick but my
[1:15:39] wife has an unusual way
[1:15:42] and our children have inherited that and
[1:15:45] and there is no sleeping through it
[1:15:49] I'll just tell you that it's it rings
[1:15:51] through the rafters
[1:15:53] and uh so I got up I prayed I prayed for
[1:15:57] the family it was uh Mariah Olivia
[1:16:01] Joshua
[1:16:03] I was praying for the family
[1:16:05] and I thought oh Lord thank you Jesus in
[1:16:08] that selfish I said oh Lord thank you
[1:16:10] Jesus I feel pretty good I'll pray a
[1:16:12] little more
[1:16:14] and then about five o'clock
[1:16:17] it found me
[1:16:19] and um well you know we don't have to go
[1:16:22] any further I feel pretty sick talking
[1:16:24] about it
[1:16:25] but uh anyway the thing that I don't
[1:16:29] know what was going on with me but I
[1:16:31] wasn't quite over what I had had the
[1:16:33] shots for the the uh steroid and
[1:16:37] antibiotic and so it really really wore
[1:16:40] me out this week and I I stayed in the
[1:16:43] chair Monday Tuesday Wednesday and
[1:16:46] Thursday I didn't come to the office I
[1:16:49] didn't leave the house I didn't dress I
[1:16:52] I changed my pajamas that's all I did
[1:16:55] and uh but I wanted to and needed to be
[1:16:59] here there were things that needed to be
[1:17:01] done I'm so thankful that so many things
[1:17:03] can be accomplished online I can pay
[1:17:06] church power bills in Jerusalem
[1:17:08] transfers and do all kinds of things
[1:17:11] from from home but I just said I've got
[1:17:14] to ask somebody to pray for me so I sent
[1:17:17] out a little prayer request there on
[1:17:19] Thursday night and I don't know who it
[1:17:21] was I'm assuming it was all of you
[1:17:24] together but somebody touched the Lord
[1:17:27] and I want to thank you for it Friday
[1:17:30] morning I felt a strength as I woke up
[1:17:32] that I had not had through the week and
[1:17:35] I was able to come and preach to the to
[1:17:39] the Saints in Ghana and had strength
[1:17:42] I've been coughing a lot this week still
[1:17:45] and so that maybe my throat was a little
[1:17:48] irritated during the broadcast and we
[1:17:50] let the mic run a little bit hot but
[1:17:53] other than that it went you you're so so
[1:17:56] smooth and I would say so anointed we're
[1:17:59] not if you want to see it you can see it
[1:18:01] on the Facebook page but I've asked them
[1:18:04] to show this little clip uh I posted it
[1:18:07] so some of you have seen it but many of
[1:18:09] you are not on Facebook and so you don't
[1:18:11] have much of a clue what goes on
[1:18:13] and so here's a way for you to see a
[1:18:15] little bit of what goes on
[1:18:17] I wanted you to see this they sent this
[1:18:19] to Hawk so that we would get an idea of
[1:18:23] how the service went on their end and
[1:18:27] and you know technology is amazing when
[1:18:30] I first started going to Ghana there was
[1:18:32] no internet
[1:18:34] and then when the internet came we had
[1:18:37] to go to internet cafes to check our
[1:18:40] email
[1:18:41] in the middle of nowhere
[1:18:44] these dirty little buildings
[1:18:46] and sometimes we could get on and you
[1:18:48] could hear it darling you know remember
[1:18:50] that sound that AOL sound and now the
[1:18:54] church has big beautiful monitors and
[1:18:57] they have a hot internet and you know
[1:19:01] it's just a blessing and and this is why
[1:19:03] this is a real real blessing I think to
[1:19:06] be able to do this
[1:19:08] one two

[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:23] it wasn't
[1:20:28] I think that's a loot we've seen it
[1:20:30] again anyway let's thank the Lord for
[1:20:32] being able to preach in Ghana
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:40] I had someone from our church asked me
[1:20:42] where that was coming from
[1:20:46] so I'd like for everybody to look over
[1:20:48] there
[1:20:52] if you've never you know walked around
[1:20:54] the front and looked in
[1:20:56] there's a state of the art studio right
[1:20:59] there
[1:21:00] and uh what a blessing it is that's
[1:21:03] where the podcast was done and what a
[1:21:06] blessing to be able to stand there he
[1:21:08] said the word was I'll give you a Pulpit
[1:21:10] to the Nations
[1:21:13] and that's one of the ways that he does
[1:21:15] that and we want to thank him for it and
[1:21:18] by the way let's mention the podcast
[1:21:21] um within 24 hours over 2 000 people on
[1:21:25] some on the two on the two two platforms
[1:21:28] that were available over 2 000 people

[1:23:30] be able to listen to it this is one of
[1:23:33] the things that people were requesting
[1:23:35] was the ability to listen not just video
[1:23:38] but there are many people when when
[1:23:41] you're having a conversation they have
[1:23:44] requested to have the video so we have
[1:23:46] the blessing of doing both Joshua River
[1:23:49] did a magnificent job
[1:23:51] and he will
[1:23:55] he will warm up and do better and better
[1:23:58] and I said to him now honey excuse me
[1:24:00] son
[1:24:03] I still call them honey and darling and
[1:24:05] sweetheart and sugar and they don't mind
[1:24:08] but I don't know how they're going to
[1:24:10] feel about it public
[1:24:11] uh I still kiss him too and on occasion
[1:24:15] they still sit on my lap
[1:24:19] that's we kind of raised him to be close
[1:24:21] and we really appreciate them being
[1:24:23] close and I sure miss them it's rare in
[1:24:26] all of these years that I would be in a
[1:24:29] service my wife and I without any of our
[1:24:31] children like we are today
[1:24:33] but let me tell you this
[1:24:35] we were in the bed last night after 11
[1:24:38] o'clock
[1:24:39] my wife and I both had a phone we were
[1:24:42] both looking at the screen and I was
[1:24:44] playing the volume for both of us but
[1:24:47] there is no joy you uh Josh and hope and
[1:24:51] I said this already to Ben and to Zach
[1:24:55] and Josh and David and these young men
[1:24:58] you will never know until you have
[1:25:00] children of your own
[1:25:03] you girls you all of it you'll never
[1:25:06] know what it feels like to be laying at
[1:25:08] home or sitting at home watching a
[1:25:10] service where your children are going
[1:25:12] through brother Daniel could see his
[1:25:14] wife and Bethany get a touch but you'll
[1:25:16] never know what it's like to to be
[1:25:18] laying there and see your children go
[1:25:21] through that prayer line those men of
[1:25:22] God laying hands on them and them
[1:25:25] shaking and weeping and dancing under
[1:25:28] the power of God having to be drug off
[1:25:30] the platform because of the power of God
[1:25:33] was so real there's no words to describe
[1:25:36] that what that feels like and I feel so
[1:25:40] blessed I I told my wife we are so
[1:25:45] blessed that they are sensitive to the
[1:25:48] spirit of God if you have any influence
[1:25:51] and you do
[1:25:53] teach your children to be sensitive to
[1:25:56] the spirit of God
[1:25:58] a Tiffany don't dare not know it when
[1:26:02] she sits her doll down there you've got
[1:26:04] to help her pick the doll up but don't
[1:26:06] you dare
[1:26:08] hold that little girl back
[1:26:10] did you all see her
[1:26:14] worshiping the Lord
[1:26:18] brother Shane and sister uh Jada
[1:26:21] sister Sally Duke who was here a few
[1:26:24] Tuesday nights ago she said to me I want
[1:26:27] to see that little boy
[1:26:29] I said what little boy she said that
[1:26:31] little boy that stands up in the front
[1:26:33] there and sings with all of his might
[1:26:37] I said well that's Moses she said well I
[1:26:40] want to see which one Moses is she said
[1:26:43] as a streamer he will never know
[1:26:47] think about it
[1:26:48] he'll never know how his praise how his
[1:26:52] big wide open mouth
[1:26:56] singing the Praises of God blesses me on
[1:27:00] the other end of the stream in that
[1:27:01] wonderful
[1:27:04] wonderful and Elisha is up
[1:27:07] Carter and Ian and many many more but
[1:27:10] you don't realize the impact that it has
[1:27:13] I uh because we missed a couple Services
[1:27:16] I'm just talking now you might have
[1:27:18] noticed
[1:27:20] but uh
[1:27:22] I because we had no service Sunday
[1:27:25] morning and Tuesday night we have had
[1:27:28] I've heard from people this week that I
[1:27:30] haven't heard from in years
[1:27:33] I heard from a sister that I've not seen
[1:27:36] in nearly well well
[1:27:38] over 25 years
[1:27:42] who streams
[1:27:44] never makes a comment
[1:27:47] never puts a thumbs up never puts a
[1:27:50] heart on there but she said I am just
[1:27:53] not running on full octane this week
[1:27:57] because she said I wasn't able to stream
[1:28:00] the service on Sunday
[1:28:02] she give herself away
[1:28:04] she said I live for that atmosphere
[1:28:08] and for that preaching
[1:28:10] and I've heard from so many this week
[1:28:12] who said we this has been the longest
[1:28:14] week of Our Lives
[1:28:16] well it don't have to be
[1:28:18] because you've got an app there
[1:28:21] you can go back and listen we have
[1:28:24] brother branham's sermons on there you
[1:28:26] can hear Brother green on there you
[1:28:27] don't have to listen to me but you can
[1:28:29] be fed wherever you are and you can
[1:28:33] watch the moments every week and you can
[1:28:36] watch the reels
[1:28:39] I'm hearing from people of all faiths
[1:28:43] and uh you know
[1:28:46] 99.5 maybe 99.7 is all positive
[1:28:52] one brother in the message he streamed
[1:28:56] to he he sent me a note to let me know
[1:28:58] that prophecies are not supposed to be
[1:29:01] quoting scripture well I have the same
[1:29:02] quotes that you do
[1:29:05] and I know what if prophecy is supposed
[1:29:08] to be but I don't consider everything
[1:29:10] that's spoken out in a service under
[1:29:13] inspiration as prophecy
[1:29:17] sometimes it's an ecstatic utterance
[1:29:21] it's the spirit of God inspiring a
[1:29:24] thought
[1:29:25] and a thought or a scripture is spoken
[1:29:28] out loud to God be the glory
[1:29:31] so take that
[1:29:36] if you want to muzzle your people go
[1:29:38] ahead and muzzle them but you're not
[1:29:40] going to muzzle mine
[1:29:42] isn't that right
[1:29:43] what's that matter we I'm not calling it
[1:29:47] prophecy
[1:29:48] but I know that it's the spirit of the
[1:29:51] Lord reminding us
[1:29:53] that he is the I am
[1:29:56] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:29:59] forever you don't ever know what brother
[1:30:01] Shaw's going to haul her out
[1:30:03] I don't call that prophecy but I call
[1:30:06] that a holy ghost inspired ecstatic
[1:30:10] utterance
[1:30:11] as the Lord just speaks out and blesses
[1:30:15] my blesser
[1:30:17] so you watch yourself but 99 point seven
[1:30:23] percent is all encouraging and and and
[1:30:26] just a real blessing to keep on keeping
[1:30:28] on let's get the birthdays in Sister
[1:30:31] Alfreda had a birthday last Sunday and I
[1:30:34] promise you that we did not come so we
[1:30:37] wouldn't have to greet you that was not
[1:30:38] it at all
[1:30:41] in fact I apologize to her I said I'm
[1:30:43] sorry I messed up your birthday but I
[1:30:45] didn't mean to do that can I just say
[1:30:47] this we are entering into a time where
[1:30:51] there are many many viruses and many
[1:30:54] colds and many flus and many things that
[1:30:57] you can pick up particularly if you
[1:31:00] vomit
[1:31:03] it's a good idea not to be around a lot
[1:31:06] of people
[1:31:08] after you have done that for a little
[1:31:10] season
[1:31:12] and so if you're on your way to a
[1:31:14] fellowship and you vomit like that maybe
[1:31:17] you'd skip the fellowship
[1:31:19] if you're on your way to a service and
[1:31:22] you feel something like that maybe just
[1:31:24] for the sake of elderly
[1:31:27] including your pastor
[1:31:30] maybe you just skip that a little it's
[1:31:33] not that we don't want to be together
[1:31:35] and it's certainly not that we're afraid
[1:31:39] but I felt I can't tell you how I felt I
[1:31:43] know God is sovereign
[1:31:45] I know there's a reason for it but I
[1:31:48] also know that we make decisions
[1:31:50] sometime that affect a whole lot of
[1:31:52] people
[1:31:53] is that right are you mad at me
[1:31:56] and we ought to be making wise decisions
[1:31:58] for ourselves and we ought to be making
[1:32:01] wise decision for other people so be
[1:32:04] careful and if you if you do come wash
[1:32:08] your hands good and and pull away a
[1:32:10] little bit and don't be right up under
[1:32:12] people because we can't help it sometime
[1:32:15] the children will you think it's
[1:32:17] sometimes it's something you Aid and of
[1:32:19] course that's just ask the Lord for
[1:32:21] leadership if you don't know what to do
[1:32:24] stop and say Lord what would be the best
[1:32:26] decision for me to make I prayed I
[1:32:29] thought how awful that would be if all
[1:32:32] those Indiana people got sick on the way
[1:32:34] home God was good to them he was
[1:32:37] merciful to them he was gracious to them
[1:32:40] most of our visitors came out as far as
[1:32:43] we know very well uh Hannah Avery
[1:32:49] crap she was sick and she's she's not in
[1:32:53] a position where she really needs to be
[1:32:55] sick but God was good to her and helped
[1:32:58] her through it but we don't want to be
[1:33:00] responsible I saw this week that there
[1:33:03] were several churches that I'm I know
[1:33:05] about that were not having service on
[1:33:07] Easter Sunday because there was so much
[1:33:10] sickness
[1:33:11] and they're trying to hold it back and
[1:33:13] so let's just use all the wisdom we can
[1:33:16] then on Tuesday of this week was Lily
[1:33:19] minko's birthday and we didn't get to
[1:33:22] wish her a happy birthday she's probably
[1:33:24] somewhere in the back
[1:33:26] and April and Peter's wedding
[1:33:28] anniversary was on Tuesday as well and
[1:33:31] how many years would this have been 14
[1:33:34] years if God would have let Peter be
[1:33:36] with us but we think about April every
[1:33:40] every year of course on times like that
[1:33:42] and then on Thursday with sister
[1:33:44] Claudia's birthday and we didn't get to
[1:33:47] greet her last Sunday it was also
[1:33:49] brother John Hall's birthday God bless
[1:33:52] you brother and it was also brother
[1:33:53] branham's birthday
[1:33:55] and then today is the anniversary of the
[1:33:59] Azusa Street Revival we want to thank
[1:34:02] God for the beginning of laodicea it had
[1:34:05] to have a beginning
[1:34:07] Hallelujah it came in with power
[1:34:10] it actually came in with talking in
[1:34:13] tongues brother Branham said he'll go
[1:34:15] out the same way
[1:34:17] Thou Art weighed in the balance and
[1:34:19] found wanting and that's where we are in
[1:34:21] the church world today tomorrow is
[1:34:23] jaya's birthday did you know
[1:34:26] foreign
[1:34:28] happy birthday the next day on the 11th
[1:34:31] is the anniversary of brother branham's
[1:34:34] burial you know that he was buried for
[1:34:37] some time later not because everyone was
[1:34:40] expecting a resurrection but because
[1:34:43] there were decisions that had to be made
[1:34:46] there were many people who wanted
[1:34:48] brother Branham buried in Tucson and uh
[1:34:51] so sister Mita was so ill and had gone
[1:34:55] through so much and her nerves were so
[1:34:57] bad and there was a quite a discussion
[1:35:00] about where he would be buried and so
[1:35:03] that is the anniversary and then Friday
[1:35:05] of this week is Sister Karen Avery's
[1:35:08] birthday that's RJ's mom she's been a
[1:35:11] faithful friend of this ministry for so
[1:35:13] many years if she should happen to see
[1:35:15] this I want to say happy birthday to her
[1:35:17] and if not I hope RJ will carry the
[1:35:21] message yes Tiffany
[1:35:24] and Isaiah's first birthday I didn't
[1:35:27] have that on the calendar yet but Isaiah
[1:35:29] has turned one year old and so we say
[1:35:33] happy birthday to Isaiah
[1:35:38] Hawk is leaving us tomorrow for a
[1:35:40] mission in Mexico
[1:35:42] he will only be gone through Saturday
[1:35:44] but he is going to meet up with a pastor
[1:35:48] friend of his from Iceland and we are
[1:35:52] believing that the Lord will use him in
[1:35:55] in Mighty and profound ways do you know
[1:35:58] how far from Mexico City the convention
[1:36:00] is
[1:36:02] about oh my about a four-hour drive
[1:36:06] outside of Mexico City so we want to be
[1:36:09] praying for Hawk we want to believe that
[1:36:12] God will protect him and the parties
[1:36:14] there Mexico is not a not the safest
[1:36:17] place in the world ever and unless
[1:36:20] you're in a resort but he will not be in
[1:36:23] the resort and so we ask that the angels
[1:36:26] of the Lord will be watching over him
[1:36:27] and protecting him and keeping him and
[1:36:30] we know they will let's stand
[1:36:36] I want us to sing a verse at least in a
[1:36:38] chorus of he lives he lives
[1:36:42] you might might remember in the podcast
[1:36:44] if you saw it how many of you have seen
[1:36:46] the whole podcast now I'm not asking if
[1:36:48] you watched it all at one time hold up
[1:36:50] your hand if you've seen all of it
[1:36:52] let me see who's seen part of it what's
[1:36:55] wrong with you
[1:36:58] all these are stories I've already heard
[1:37:01] well hear them again
[1:37:03] a young man who traveled with me
[1:37:06] sometime just just a short period of
[1:37:08] time I saw where he come in and he said
[1:37:11] I heard these stories but it sure did me
[1:37:13] good to hear them again and uh for every
[1:37:16] person who said I believe them I really
[1:37:19] appreciate that the vote of confidence
[1:37:21] let's sing this you might have heard in
[1:37:23] that podcast I mentioned going up to the
[1:37:26] Baptist I think I did I meant to going
[1:37:28] up to the Baptist pastor when I was just
[1:37:31] a few years old and telling him one day
[1:37:33] I'm going to have your job
[1:37:35] well I also told him if you'd sing he
[1:37:39] lives a little more there might be
[1:37:41] something going on in this church
[1:37:45] because I was there one Sunday and the
[1:37:48] choir sung he lives he lives and those
[1:37:52] Baptist people look like finally they
[1:37:54] believed something
[1:37:55] I said there'd be a little more life
[1:37:57] around here if the choirs sing that more
[1:37:59] often so let's sing a verse of it in
[1:38:01] memory of brother book
[1:38:04] I serve a risen savior he's in the world
[1:38:09] today
[1:38:10] I know that he is living no matter what
[1:38:15] men they say
[1:38:17] I see I see his hand of Mercy I hear his
[1:38:22] voice of cheer and just the just the
[1:38:25] time I need help he's always near

[1:41:39] nobody can tell it like you can tell it
[1:41:42] let's thank the Lord for these musicians
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:49] lest remain standing for the reading of
[1:41:52] God's word Leviticus
[1:41:54] chapter 23
[1:41:58] beginning in verse 9 now I've been
[1:42:01] calculating a little something
[1:42:04] and and here we go
[1:42:07] last Sunday morning
[1:42:09] I didn't preach two hours
[1:42:12] Tuesday night
[1:42:14] I didn't preach an hour
[1:42:17] I got three hours in my account
[1:42:23] I hadn't got there Megan
[1:42:26] by the way thank you for setting off the
[1:42:28] alarm
[1:42:29] last Sunday morning
[1:42:34] since you said that
[1:42:37] and then two hours from today
[1:42:40] so I've got five hours today God is so
[1:42:45] good to me I ought to just start in
[1:42:47] Genesis
[1:42:50] Leviticus chapter 23
[1:42:53] beginning in verse 9 and the Lord spake
[1:42:57] unto Moses saying
[1:43:00] speak until the children of Israel and
[1:43:04] say unto them when you become into the
[1:43:07] land which I give unto you and shall
[1:43:12] reap the Harvest thereof
[1:43:15] then ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first
[1:43:20] fruits of your Harvest
[1:43:24] unto the priest I want to read that last
[1:43:28] phrase again then ye shall bring a Sheaf
[1:43:33] let's say that a sheath of not a chief
[1:43:38] a Sheaf remember the old song bringing
[1:43:41] in the sheaves
[1:43:43] so that's what we're talking about then
[1:43:46] you shall bring a Sheaf of the first
[1:43:49] fruits of your Harvest unto the priest
[1:43:52] you see today is the day of the Feast of
[1:43:56] first fruits
[1:43:57] it is
[1:43:59] and so this is irrelevant
[1:44:01] scripture for us today
[1:44:04] speak unto the children of Israel okay
[1:44:08] the next verse and he shall wave
[1:44:13] the Sheaf now you've got to see what a
[1:44:15] Sheaf is in your in your mind I didn't
[1:44:18] get a picture of a Sheaf for you but you
[1:44:21] know at Harvest Time
[1:44:23] you'll see especially in the fall
[1:44:26] they'll they locked a bundle corn
[1:44:28] together and show you what a Sheaf looks
[1:44:31] like they they put a twine around the
[1:44:33] middle of it and stand it in the field
[1:44:36] now when we're talking about the Feast
[1:44:39] of unleavened bread during the month of
[1:44:41] Habib which means ripe we're talking
[1:44:45] about the barley Harvest
[1:44:47] there's there it is beautiful beautiful
[1:44:50] way I believe that let me see that again
[1:44:54] yes I believe that's probably wheat and
[1:44:57] uh the wheat is a little later
[1:45:00] than the barley the wheat will be about
[1:45:02] 50 days from now
[1:45:04] when we celebrate the Feast of Shavuot
[1:45:09] which is Pentecost
[1:45:11] and so on Pentecost wheat was waived
[1:45:16] before the Lord already in baked loaves
[1:45:20] but in the time of first fruits which
[1:45:24] was during the Feast of unleavened bread
[1:45:28] which we call Passover Passover is one
[1:45:31] day the Feast of unleavened bread a
[1:45:34] whole week
[1:45:35] and it consummates doesn't always end
[1:45:39] but consummates
[1:45:42] on the first day after the weekly
[1:45:45] Sabbath
[1:45:46] which is today
[1:45:48] that you would gather The Barley
[1:45:52] the priest would go out in the field and
[1:45:55] there would be somebody among them
[1:45:58] appointed probably one of the one of the
[1:46:02] Lesser priests and what I mean by what I
[1:46:05] mean by that is serving in a lower
[1:46:08] position for now
[1:46:10] he would go out and go among the The
[1:46:14] Barley plants and he would pluck The
[1:46:18] Barley that was ripe
[1:46:20] and he would tie it together with a
[1:46:23] twine and stand it in the field
[1:46:26] and then as we read there would be a
[1:46:29] celebration a ceremony of sort
[1:46:33] where those barley sheafs would be waved
[1:46:38] over the field the whole field all the
[1:46:42] little heads of grain
[1:46:43] would be down in their Growing Place and
[1:46:47] that wave Sheaf offering would take
[1:46:49] place unto the Lord
[1:46:52] it was a prophetic message
[1:46:55] to the people and to the to the grain
[1:46:59] it said to the people harvest is coming
[1:47:04] this is the beginning of the Harvest not
[1:47:07] the end
[1:47:08] it said to the to the rest of the grain
[1:47:12] just like this grain that has been waved
[1:47:15] over you today has come to its maturity
[1:47:21] you will also re reach your maturity
[1:47:28] so as as we know the priest of the Lord
[1:47:33] would thank God for the early Reigns
[1:47:36] and they would call on the Lord for the
[1:47:39] latter Reigns
[1:47:40] and so every part of this is very
[1:47:44] significant and very prophetic so I want
[1:47:47] you to see the Sheaf charity showed you
[1:47:50] a picture and I want you to see the
[1:47:53] priest holding that Sheaf in his arms
[1:47:56] something like this and he is waving it
[1:48:01] over the crop and giving praise to
[1:48:06] Adonai oh Father of the Harvest thank
[1:48:10] you for the ripening of the Grain and
[1:48:14] thank you that in the same manner this
[1:48:17] grain has become right the rest of the
[1:48:21] seed will also become right and will
[1:48:25] also be harvested unto Yahweh now we
[1:48:28] have something to be thankful for when
[1:48:30] we look at this picture and he shall
[1:48:33] wave the Sheep before the Lord to be
[1:48:36] accepted for you
[1:48:41] he is doing it on behalf of the
[1:48:45] worshiper
[1:48:46] and because the priest is faithful to
[1:48:50] carry out his duty it brings an
[1:48:53] acceptance
[1:48:55] of the worshiper
[1:48:58] he is accepted
[1:49:01] as though he gave an offering
[1:49:04] because the priest represents in this
[1:49:09] place the worshiper
[1:49:12] to be accepted for you on the moral
[1:49:16] after the Sabbath
[1:49:18] which is Sunday
[1:49:20] the priest shall wave it and ye shall
[1:49:25] offer that day when ye wave the sheath
[1:49:30] and he lamb not she
[1:49:33] a helam without blemish of the first
[1:49:38] year for a
[1:49:42] and hola remember last Saturday night
[1:49:46] and Ola a burnt offering unto the Lord
[1:49:52] I want you to use the language of
[1:49:57] offering
[1:49:59] because the word in Hebrew that we
[1:50:02] sometimes translate sacrifice
[1:50:06] gives us an entirely different picture
[1:50:11] than an offering
[1:50:13] this was not a sa even the lamb being
[1:50:16] given to the Lord
[1:50:18] bled out
[1:50:20] and burnt on the altar even the lamb
[1:50:24] being burned was not a sacrifice
[1:50:27] yes the lamb sacrificed his life
[1:50:30] but it was an offering unto the Lord
[1:50:35] and that is why in the new Temple there
[1:50:39] will be offerings unto the Lord
[1:50:42] and many struggle with that
[1:50:45] and you hear many people saying there
[1:50:48] will never be another lamb slain there
[1:50:51] will never be another well I want you to
[1:50:54] know that if the Jewish people have
[1:50:56] their way
[1:50:57] they will continue to offer offerings
[1:51:01] unto the Lord even when they have
[1:51:05] recognized Yeshua as the sacrificial
[1:51:08] lamb
[1:51:09] now this is not to dispute anything that
[1:51:13] has already been spoken but it is to say
[1:51:16] that they are not looking at every time
[1:51:19] a lamb is is killed as a sacrifice
[1:51:23] sometimes it is just the giving of an
[1:51:26] offering if you study with a Hebrew root
[1:51:30] scholar you would understand that they
[1:51:33] use the word offering instead of the
[1:51:35] word sacrifice
[1:51:38] all right so a a he lamb without blemish
[1:51:41] of the first year for a burnt offering
[1:51:43] unto the Lord may God add his Blessing
[1:51:45] to the reading of his word I almost
[1:51:48] forgot you were standing you may be
[1:51:50] seated
[1:51:51] and the meat offering thereof shall be
[1:51:54] two tenths deals
[1:51:57] a fine flower mingled with oil it almost
[1:52:01] sounds like somebody's making biscuit
[1:52:05] flower
[1:52:07] mingled with oil
[1:52:09] and offering made by fire unto the Lord
[1:52:15] for a sweet Savor have you ever been in
[1:52:19] the house when the bed was bed when the
[1:52:22] bread when the British some of you look
[1:52:25] like you need the bed when the bread was
[1:52:28] baking
[1:52:29] oh what a smell I live sometime in the
[1:52:33] wrong house because there are many days
[1:52:36] that my house smells like bread and I am
[1:52:41] very often told
[1:52:45] this goes to somebody else
[1:52:48] this is Mariah's business and this goes
[1:52:52] to the well or this one goes to sister
[1:52:54] so and so that one belongs to brother so
[1:52:57] and so and so I have to smell it
[1:53:00] sometime that sweet saver
[1:53:04] did you know even the lord loves the
[1:53:07] smell of baking bread
[1:53:09] and sometimes I don't get to taste it
[1:53:12] but every now and again we she'll get
[1:53:15] around them sometimes Stacy has to get
[1:53:17] in and make sure that we have some and
[1:53:20] the drink offering thereof shall be of
[1:53:23] wine the fourth part of a hen this is a
[1:53:28] measurement in the time of the scripture
[1:53:31] and ye shall this is verse 14.
[1:53:36] and ye shall eat neither bread
[1:53:41] nor parched corn
[1:53:43] nor green ears until the self-same day
[1:53:49] that ye have brought an offering unto
[1:53:52] your god notice what he's saying to us
[1:53:56] are you with me
[1:53:57] notice what he's saying to the children
[1:53:59] of Israel here he's saying you don't
[1:54:03] participate and partake of harvest until
[1:54:07] the Lord has gotten his part
[1:54:11] this is tithe
[1:54:13] did you know the giving of your tithe is
[1:54:17] an honorable Memorial of a first fruit
[1:54:20] unto the Lord the scripture tells us so
[1:54:22] so we're giving God a portion of the
[1:54:26] Harvest listen and believing that if we
[1:54:31] give God what belongs to him he will
[1:54:34] bless the rest of the money
[1:54:39] and that 90 percent
[1:54:43] will spend
[1:54:45] in a greater way
[1:54:48] than the than the hundred percent you
[1:54:51] believe God does that for people
[1:54:53] this is why JCPenney was able to turn
[1:54:57] things around
[1:54:58] and give God 90 percent
[1:55:03] and live on ten percent
[1:55:06] because he learned as a businessman
[1:55:08] early that if you'll give God what
[1:55:11] rightfully belongs to him
[1:55:14] and thank him every time he blesses you
[1:55:18] with a job
[1:55:20] you'll never be sorry
[1:55:23] and God will bless you and help you till
[1:55:26] maybe you get to the place that you can
[1:55:29] give God another two percent or another
[1:55:31] three percent
[1:55:32] how many of you'd like to be in such a
[1:55:34] place
[1:55:36] now those of you who round your tithe I
[1:55:39] mean excuse me those of you who who feel
[1:55:41] it's necessary to give God fifty dollars
[1:55:44] and eleven Cent
[1:55:48] it's going to be very quiet here
[1:55:50] if you want God to bless you if you're
[1:55:53] interested in learning how to get that
[1:55:56] thing moving
[1:55:58] then go ahead sometime and round that
[1:56:01] living sin up to the next dollar
[1:56:03] and say to the Lord
[1:56:06] Lord I want you to know that I'm keeping
[1:56:09] Covenant with you and I understand that
[1:56:12] I could never out give you
[1:56:15] and so I'm going to put a little extra
[1:56:17] in my tithe
[1:56:19] because I want you to know I'm depending
[1:56:23] on you my preacher said if I'll give God
[1:56:27] what belongs to him he'll bless what's
[1:56:29] left
[1:56:31] I don't preach on tithe very often
[1:56:34] it's nothing but the truth when I'm
[1:56:37] asked what to give God I say everything
[1:56:39] God blesses you with you give him
[1:56:41] somehow find a way to give him a first
[1:56:44] fruits of that
[1:56:46] if you have to calculate the value of
[1:56:49] something that's given to you and put
[1:56:52] that in monetarily do it
[1:56:54] or if you've got some other way
[1:56:57] when the when the vegetables start
[1:56:59] coming in I have people bring vegetables
[1:57:02] I'm not out for veg veggies
[1:57:05] but I have people that bring them in and
[1:57:07] they say this is the first fruits of the
[1:57:10] Harvest there is something you ought to
[1:57:13] know about first fruits it doesn't
[1:57:14] represent just the first to become ripe
[1:57:18] scripturally it represents the best of
[1:57:21] the crop
[1:57:22] [Music]
[1:57:24] so there is a mindset that comes with
[1:57:28] giving God a first fruit offering
[1:57:30] if it's truly a first fruit I'll show
[1:57:33] you that in Hebrew in just a moment
[1:57:35] you're giving God something that is that
[1:57:38] is the best of the best
[1:57:40] so of that which he gives you first you
[1:57:43] go through that and you give God the
[1:57:46] best of the best as a first fruit
[1:57:48] offering unto the Lord and and when you
[1:57:50] do that even under this Covenant of
[1:57:53] Grace when you do that you'll see the
[1:57:55] blessings of the Lord in your life are
[1:57:57] there any blessed people here is mighty
[1:57:59] quiet
[1:58:00] are there any blessed people here
[1:58:02] you let God you give God something if he
[1:58:05] blesses you with a job
[1:58:07] somebody said I don't think uh the
[1:58:09] children ought to give a tithe on their
[1:58:11] on their uh grass cutting money or their
[1:58:15] bread baking money or I think you ought
[1:58:18] to teach them
[1:58:21] from the time you can teach them
[1:58:23] to give God what belongs to him and
[1:58:27] that's why you'll see 11 cents as in a
[1:58:29] tithe envelope and nobody cares one
[1:58:32] ounce about that living sin if that
[1:58:34] comes from a child then it comes from
[1:58:36] what they've got
[1:58:38] and what they've gotten what they've
[1:58:40] received and we're just as thrilled when
[1:58:43] that comes in as we possibly could be
[1:58:45] because it reminds us that even the
[1:58:48] little ones are learning what it means
[1:58:50] to honor God
[1:58:53] we adults can give God an extra 50 Cent
[1:58:56] from time to time I don't know why it's
[1:58:58] so quiet
[1:59:01] you show me the verse that says to the
[1:59:04] penny
[1:59:07] now he goes on here and we learn a lot
[1:59:11] about the Feast of first fruits first
[1:59:14] fruits let me say it this way first
[1:59:16] fruits is a Biblical concept that can be
[1:59:20] used or utilized at any time of the year
[1:59:25] in other words we there for a while on
[1:59:29] the first Sunday of the month brother
[1:59:32] Greeley would say let's instead of going
[1:59:35] to you for your tithe and offering you
[1:59:38] come up here as a as a as a first fruits
[1:59:41] as a remembrance you you're you're
[1:59:44] giving it to the Lord you're bringing it
[1:59:47] as the scripture said to the Lord and we
[1:59:50] did that for many many months maybe a
[1:59:52] few years just to remind you that this
[1:59:56] is a time where you are remembering you
[1:59:59] are commemorating the biblical concept
[2:00:03] of giving God first fruits let me read
[2:00:08] you the definition from the Hebrew we're
[2:00:10] going to get to something in a minute
[2:00:11] but I had to lay this Foundation the
[2:00:15] first fruits is the firstborn of the
[2:00:18] flocks
[2:00:19] are the first vegetables or the first of
[2:00:22] the grains that are gathered at Harvest
[2:00:25] Time
[2:00:26] thought of as belonging to God this is
[2:00:30] from the Hebrew in a special sense
[2:00:34] first fruits is from the Hebrew word
[2:00:37] bakur
[2:00:39] which means the first fruits of the crop
[2:00:42] it also means the beginning the first
[2:00:46] and the choicest
[2:00:49] so that's why I said in the concept of
[2:00:53] first fruits it's not just because you
[2:00:55] have taken it first
[2:00:57] but you have taken the first the priest
[2:01:01] was to take the first but I guarantee
[2:01:03] you when he made that sheath and waved
[2:01:07] that before the Lord there weren't any
[2:01:08] broken stalks
[2:01:10] there weren't any any heads of barley
[2:01:13] that had kernels missing
[2:01:18] because he was giving this unto yah and
[2:01:21] and therefore he wanted to not only give
[2:01:23] the first that was ripe he wanted to
[2:01:26] give God the best
[2:01:28] of the first
[2:01:30] that was ripe how many of you believe
[2:01:32] that sounds right
[2:01:34] it sounds right to me choicist it comes
[2:01:38] from a root in Hebrew the word bakar
[2:01:43] which means to burst the womb
[2:01:46] it means to bear or make early fruit
[2:01:51] it can be of a woman it can be of a tree
[2:01:55] in scripture the male the firstborn of
[2:01:59] the male was given to the Lord how many
[2:02:02] of you remember that concept of giving
[2:02:04] the first male to the Lord then he was
[2:02:07] redeemed with silver
[2:02:10] you gave him to the Lord and then with
[2:02:13] silver you went to the priest and bought
[2:02:16] him back so that you could raise him as
[2:02:19] a servant of Yahweh a servant of God but
[2:02:23] he was to be given he's the one who
[2:02:25] broke the womb first
[2:02:27] the scripture uses in King James the
[2:02:30] word Matrix which is which is uh most
[2:02:34] likely the cervix of a woman
[2:02:36] and it means the the the child that has
[2:02:41] broken that first that has come forth
[2:02:44] but it also can mean the Apple
[2:02:47] the apples that have become right first
[2:02:51] or the wheat stalks that have become
[2:02:56] ripened first
[2:02:58] then there is another word that is
[2:03:00] sometimes used for first fruits in
[2:03:03] Hebrew and it is rasheth
[2:03:06] and it means which means the first
[2:03:11] in place time order or rank
[2:03:18] specifically
[2:03:20] as a first fruit offering
[2:03:23] and the root of that word in Hebrew is
[2:03:27] Rosh
[2:03:28] now how many of you are familiar with
[2:03:30] the Hebrew word rosh as in Rosh Hashanah
[2:03:36] and that means what anybody remember
[2:03:39] it means head
[2:03:41] it doesn't mean New Year it means the
[2:03:45] head of the year because in in Hebrew
[2:03:50] there are multiple New Years how many of
[2:03:53] you remember that
[2:03:55] there is a civil New Year and that is
[2:03:58] what we celebrate when we look at rosh
[2:04:01] Rush the head of the year when when we
[2:04:05] come to Nissan
[2:04:07] which is the Hebrew month that we are in
[2:04:10] now it is the Hebrew month of Passover
[2:04:13] it is the Hebrew month of the Feast of
[2:04:15] unleavened bread it is the Hebrew a
[2:04:18] month of the Feast of first fruits when
[2:04:21] we come to that it is also the head of
[2:04:23] the year the Bible tells us so
[2:04:26] it is the it is the beginning of the
[2:04:29] religious or spiritual New Year so did
[2:04:32] you know right now we are in a New Year
[2:04:34] spiritually according to the Bible the
[2:04:37] Bible said this
[2:04:39] now some people say that's for the Jews
[2:04:41] I want you to know it wasn't just for
[2:04:44] the Jews it was also for the strangers
[2:04:47] in your midst
[2:04:49] now you come Tuesday night and the Lord
[2:04:51] willing I'll show you some of that
[2:04:53] because I wanted to speak today on
[2:04:56] Passover
[2:04:57] I really wanted to show you why Passover
[2:05:01] is so significant and so important and
[2:05:04] why we must at the very least we must
[2:05:09] remember it every year
[2:05:13] it may not be necessary to always have a
[2:05:17] Seder because a Seder is a rabbinical
[2:05:21] tradition that is not mentioned in the
[2:05:24] Bible
[2:05:25] and so we can do a Seder I love teaching
[2:05:29] from a Seder but it is not a Biblical
[2:05:32] commandment the biblical commandment is
[2:05:35] to remember
[2:05:36] to celebrate and if anybody oh my in all
[2:05:42] of those Jewish homes a few nights ago
[2:05:45] around the world when they gathered
[2:05:48] around the table and they had the Seder
[2:05:51] plate in place and they ate of the mara
[2:05:54] I I just tell you there's not going to
[2:05:57] hardly be a year go by that there's not
[2:05:59] at least harosith at my house
[2:06:03] that is part of the seder meal and it
[2:06:07] goes on the plate and that is that
[2:06:10] um that is an amazing Apple
[2:06:13] salad
[2:06:16] apple
[2:06:17] wine cinnamon golden raisins
[2:06:23] and walnuts
[2:06:26] and honey
[2:06:29] now somebody tell me what's wrong with
[2:06:31] that
[2:06:36] you just have to watch my wife
[2:06:40] because she'll go by the refrigerator
[2:06:44] she said as long as it's in there I
[2:06:47] can't forget it
[2:06:49] she'll keep a spoon handy
[2:06:52] I said now honey
[2:06:55] it ain't the honey you're after
[2:06:58] make sure you don't keep digging down
[2:07:00] too deep in that in that salad because
[2:07:03] you know what sits down in the bottom
[2:07:06] that's the wine
[2:07:08] that represents the mortar of the bricks
[2:07:12] that the Israelites spent many years in
[2:07:16] hard labor and hard slavery to to serve
[2:07:21] Pharaoh paying for some of their some of
[2:07:24] their sin and and suffering in such a
[2:07:27] horrible way but God had a deliverer he
[2:07:31] was building on the backside of the
[2:07:34] desert how many of you are glad that God
[2:07:36] always prepares a deliverer in every
[2:07:40] season
[2:07:41] in every season God has a deliverer
[2:07:46] in my life he has sent deliverers
[2:07:49] he has sent those who had a word from
[2:07:52] the Lord for me just in time
[2:07:56] I call them deliverers I say they've
[2:08:00] been Moses unto me we know we have a
[2:08:04] messenger who has been a Moses unto us
[2:08:07] but he wasn't the only deliverer in fact
[2:08:11] he told us that our Joshua was the Holy
[2:08:15] Ghost how many of times has the holy
[2:08:18] helped me a little bit I'm going to
[2:08:20] preach you might as well enjoy it get in
[2:08:23] here a little bit how many times has the
[2:08:26] Holy Ghost come and made a way for you
[2:08:28] when it looked like there was no way
[2:08:31] when it looked like everything was
[2:08:33] shutting down and life would never be
[2:08:36] the same again and the Holy Ghost
[2:08:39] the Holy Ghost came
[2:08:42] to your rescue
[2:08:45] brought a word brought somebody
[2:08:48] inspired you with the preaching of the
[2:08:50] word the Holy Ghost lets you sit under a
[2:08:53] holy ghost anointed song that spoke
[2:08:56] directly to your heart my we're blessed
[2:09:00] to have our Joshua we're blessed to have
[2:09:02] the Holy Ghost now in in this Feast of
[2:09:06] first fruits it's such a beautiful thing
[2:09:09] it's beautiful in in the Feast of
[2:09:12] unleavened bread it's beautiful and
[2:09:14] shoveled
[2:09:15] it's also beautiful in Tabernacles
[2:09:20] I was one time caught
[2:09:25] in the old city of Jerusalem
[2:09:29] it was one of those rare occasions
[2:09:33] that we brought a vehicle into the old
[2:09:35] city
[2:09:37] there are only so many roads that you
[2:09:40] can travel on by car in The Old City
[2:09:44] it was one of those rare occasions that
[2:09:46] we came in Zion gate
[2:09:50] and we made our way through the Armenian
[2:09:53] quarter
[2:09:54] and I don't even remember exactly why we
[2:09:58] had brought the vehicle in maybe to pick
[2:10:00] up something
[2:10:02] but I was there with a few brothers and
[2:10:05] it was the Feast of Tabernacles time
[2:10:08] and I didn't know that they were having
[2:10:10] a pageant
[2:10:12] at the at the courtyard of the Western
[2:10:14] Wall and that school children had been
[2:10:18] bussed there from all over Israel to
[2:10:22] reenact oh my
[2:10:26] to reenact this ceremony that takes
[2:10:30] place first fruits at Tabernacles time
[2:10:34] when the grapes are ripe
[2:10:37] when the pomegranates are ripe when the
[2:10:41] dates are ripe and and so we literally
[2:10:48] sister Nancy was still alive she was
[2:10:51] driving the vehicle
[2:10:53] and we literally got surrounded by
[2:10:57] hundreds and hundreds of children
[2:11:00] there was no way to move forward
[2:11:03] don't miss this
[2:11:06] there was no way to move forward there
[2:11:09] was no way to move backwards there was
[2:11:11] no way to pull to the right or the left
[2:11:13] you just sat there for several hours we
[2:11:16] sat there
[2:11:17] as the children come down out of the out
[2:11:21] of out of uh Jaffa gate
[2:11:25] all the way through the old city
[2:11:28] down by Zion gate
[2:11:31] down near the dung gate which is down
[2:11:34] near the cartel the Western Wall
[2:11:37] and they are bringing baskets
[2:11:42] full of pomegranates
[2:11:45] and grapes and dates and jars of honey
[2:11:50] it's the most beautiful thing you've
[2:11:53] just about ever seen in your life and
[2:11:56] they were bringing it as I need your
[2:11:59] help now
[2:12:00] they were bringing it as worship unto
[2:12:04] the Lord
[2:12:06] worshiping the Lord by nging the first
[2:12:10] fruit they knew God wasn't going to
[2:12:11] consume that it would be given to the
[2:12:14] needy but it was the reenactment and the
[2:12:18] celebration of the first fruits that can
[2:12:21] happen at any season of the year
[2:12:24] according to what is becoming right
[2:12:28] but there was one time
[2:12:31] there was one particular time
[2:12:35] that on the Feast of unleavened bread
[2:12:39] a meal was taking place
[2:12:42] near Bethany
[2:12:45] where Jesus and his disciples were going
[2:12:48] through what we call a Seder but it
[2:12:52] predates
[2:12:54] the actual seder ceremony that is used
[2:12:57] today but it is a remembrance with the
[2:13:00] cups and with the breaking of unleavened
[2:13:03] bread and the cups of wine and when
[2:13:06] Jesus got to the third cup the cup of of
[2:13:10] redemption
[2:13:13] and he began to to pray the blessing
[2:13:22] Blessed Are You O Lord our god king of
[2:13:25] the universe who brings forth fruit from
[2:13:28] the vine as he gets ready to make that
[2:13:31] blessing over the grape juice the wine
[2:13:34] he he says something extra this time
[2:13:38] that has never been said before this cup
[2:13:45] every year of his young life hear me
[2:13:48] I'll do more on this Tuesday night
[2:13:51] I'm on page one of 15 pages for this
[2:13:53] morning I gotta hurry every year of his
[2:13:56] young life
[2:13:58] 30 plus years he has celebrated with his
[2:14:02] family and friends the cup of redemption
[2:14:06] one night of the year the night of the
[2:14:09] Feast of unleavened bread the night of
[2:14:12] Passover
[2:14:14] he has done that time and time again the
[2:14:17] same blessing prayed over that cup year
[2:14:20] after year after year and everybody
[2:14:22] takes a drink of that cup and they move
[2:14:25] on to the next cup which is the cup of
[2:14:27] halil
[2:14:28] how many of you know what halil means
[2:14:32] it means praise halil that's where we
[2:14:36] get halil
[2:14:38] ooh
[2:14:40] yeah
[2:14:41] praise to God hallelujah
[2:14:45] Hallelujah
[2:14:47] I like when somebody says hallelujah
[2:14:51] I do real well in the Spanish type
[2:14:54] culture Portuguese type Hallelujah or or
[2:14:58] Hallelujah
[2:15:01] it's praise to God
[2:15:04] and every year they pass that cup the
[2:15:06] cup of praise and the scripture tells us
[2:15:09] that in this moment he said this cup
[2:15:13] is the New Covenant
[2:15:16] in my blood
[2:15:19] no longer just wine this represents more
[2:15:24] than just a fruity drink
[2:15:27] with a little bit of fermentation in it
[2:15:29] this represents my blood which is shed
[2:15:35] for you
[2:15:37] he takes the matsote
[2:15:40] the unleavened bread and he breaks it He
[2:15:43] blesses it
[2:15:51] Blessed Are You O Lord our god king of
[2:15:53] the universe who who brings forth bread
[2:15:56] from the Earth
[2:15:58] and he says to them this is my body
[2:16:05] this no longer just represents the bread
[2:16:08] of haste
[2:16:10] why is the bread unleavened at Passover
[2:16:13] time because the children of Israel
[2:16:16] didn't have time to linger to tarry
[2:16:18] anybody with me
[2:16:20] I don't really feel too many but I'm
[2:16:23] hoping you'll jump in here in a minute I
[2:16:25] think some are afraid to really help me
[2:16:27] and pull a little bit because you're
[2:16:28] afraid you might get too many hours out
[2:16:30] of me
[2:16:33] oh this is life to me
[2:16:35] I can't speak for you it's life for me
[2:16:38] when I see Jesus I don't have any I
[2:16:41] should have brought some zamatza today
[2:16:43] but when you hold a piece of modern
[2:16:46] matzah in your hand and you know that
[2:16:49] every Jew around the world is eating
[2:16:51] that bread this week
[2:16:54] and they go always remember a Jew
[2:16:56] believes that you should build walls
[2:17:00] around the law
[2:17:01] and if the law requires little you go
[2:17:05] way overboard
[2:17:08] so I have to watch Christians
[2:17:15] I have to watch Christians who get some
[2:17:17] understanding and some interest in these
[2:17:21] beautiful typology
[2:17:23] these beautiful symbols because if
[2:17:26] you're not careful they'll go way too
[2:17:27] far
[2:17:29] they'll try to drag us back under the
[2:17:32] law
[2:17:32] they'll miss the messenger to the church
[2:17:35] age
[2:17:36] they'll Miss what has happened don't you
[2:17:38] dare let any symbol or let any ceremony
[2:17:42] of scripture or celebration or
[2:17:44] commemoration of any day or any holy day
[2:17:47] don't you ever let any of that take away
[2:17:50] from Jesus Christ
[2:17:52] he's a living bread
[2:17:54] he's no longer laying on a dish on the
[2:17:57] table he's living in The Believer
[2:18:01] but don't miss the beautiful sacred
[2:18:03] lessons that we learn
[2:18:06] all right I see the juice
[2:18:09] holding this piece of bread in their
[2:18:11] hand as they have held for many many
[2:18:13] years now once baked in ovens at home
[2:18:17] and now much easier purchased
[2:18:21] from why you can buy the most famous
[2:18:25] of the matzus here made in New York City
[2:18:28] it's shipped to Israel even
[2:18:30] you can buy it at Publix the very kind
[2:18:33] that the most Orthodox of the Jews like
[2:18:35] to use
[2:18:37] and you hold that piece of bread in your
[2:18:40] hand
[2:18:41] and I want you to know you can see the
[2:18:43] stripes
[2:18:47] where the oven there's a piece of it see
[2:18:49] those see those brown Stripes coming
[2:18:52] down the Hat
[2:18:54] and a Jewish man holds that in his hand
[2:18:57] and he doesn't remember Isaiah 53 like
[2:19:00] you and I remember I say but he was
[2:19:02] wounded
[2:19:05] he was straight
[2:19:08] discretion how many of you see those
[2:19:10] holes
[2:19:13] that's pierced you're holding a piece of
[2:19:16] striped and pierced bread in your hand
[2:19:20] that represents what Yeshua what Jesus
[2:19:24] said it did when he gave it to his
[2:19:26] disciple this is my body
[2:19:30] broken for you taking it
[2:19:34] Have We Become cannibalist no sir he's
[2:19:39] talking of a spiritual truth remember
[2:19:43] when Jesus turned to his disciples and
[2:19:45] said you must eat my body
[2:19:48] you must drink my bread drink my blood
[2:19:53] and they the Bible said because of this
[2:19:56] saying
[2:19:59] why
[2:20:01] because the law of Moses condemns
[2:20:04] the drinking of blood
[2:20:06] it condemns the tasting of blood or the
[2:20:10] mingling of blood and did you know a
[2:20:13] religious Jew today would bleed to death
[2:20:15] before they would take their finger you
[2:20:18] you ever pricked your fingering
[2:20:20] first thing you do
[2:20:22] hold it up to your mouth and just put a
[2:20:24] little suction there to try to pull that
[2:20:26] out and stop the bleeding
[2:20:28] caught encouraging the blood to clot a
[2:20:31] religious Jew would never do such a
[2:20:33] thing because they don't believe in
[2:20:36] tasting blood
[2:20:37] or or consuming blood that way why
[2:20:40] because the Bible tells us that
[2:20:42] something is in that blood
[2:20:44] the life of the of the creature the life
[2:20:47] so to consume animals blood
[2:20:51] that's why a Jewish man eats meat that
[2:20:54] has been killed in a Jewish uh butcher
[2:20:58] shop
[2:20:59] blessed by the priest because it has to
[2:21:02] be not only slain but it has to be hung
[2:21:05] in a certain way that all the blood
[2:21:07] comes out of it
[2:21:09] and so for Jesus second temple period
[2:21:13] man living as a Jew
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:21] of course he was living as a Jew
[2:21:26] I can't imagine why anybody would have
[2:21:29] any
[2:21:32] of random said he was neither Jew nor
[2:21:35] Gentile he was of a different seed that
[2:21:37] is exactly right his body was not Jewish
[2:21:41] his blood was not Jewish but he was a
[2:21:45] man living a Jewish life or he could
[2:21:48] have never been the Messiah
[2:21:52] that's what the scripture tells us
[2:21:54] actually
[2:21:55] and so
[2:21:58] they they said I can't have anything to
[2:22:00] do with this
[2:22:01] and the Bible said many of them which
[2:22:05] walked with him walked with him no more
[2:22:09] and he turned
[2:22:11] and he said to this Inner Circle
[2:22:15] aren't you going to leave me also
[2:22:21] oh Lord
[2:22:23] where can we go
[2:22:25] if we left you where would we go for
[2:22:28] thou alone
[2:22:30] have the words of eternal life
[2:22:33] that's why this little bride is still
[2:22:35] running after Jesus
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:22:38] that's why the Living Word is our
[2:22:40] absolute
[2:22:46] that's why we're still eating the flesh
[2:22:49] and drinking the blood
[2:22:52] that's why we're still feasting on the
[2:22:54] living carcass
[2:22:55] The Living Word of God
[2:22:58] the bleeding he said the bleeding word
[2:23:00] of God
[2:23:02] we do that because in him everything
[2:23:06] that we have need of is found
[2:23:09] and so this ceremony took place and the
[2:23:11] Bible said they they sung a hymn
[2:23:14] which is something the Jews did after
[2:23:17] every Passover Gathering
[2:23:19] and that hymn would have been one of the
[2:23:21] Psalms that make up the allele
[2:23:24] which is that special group of Psalms in
[2:23:27] the Bible that they call the songs of
[2:23:29] ascent
[2:23:30] that Jewish pilgrims would always sing
[2:23:33] on their way up to Jerusalem Jerusalem
[2:23:37] being the highest place in the land of
[2:23:40] Israel and they're always going up when
[2:23:42] they leave their homes to go and worship
[2:23:44] there so they sing the Psalms of ascent
[2:23:47] the wonderful praise can you imagine
[2:23:50] living in that hour and hearing those
[2:23:53] Jewish people come together from all
[2:23:55] over the land singing the songs of
[2:23:58] praise
[2:23:59] it must be like a Sunday morning around
[2:24:01] here
[2:24:03] just multitude by the multitude
[2:24:06] magnified or multiplied by the by the
[2:24:09] multitude
[2:24:11] and then you know and we will talk about
[2:24:13] this Tuesday night perhaps
[2:24:15] you'll know you'll understand that he
[2:24:17] was as as every Passover Lamb has over a
[2:24:21] Paschal Lamb I think most of you know
[2:24:25] that in most every language in the world
[2:24:29] there is no word Easter
[2:24:32] I think most of you know that in almost
[2:24:34] every language of the world the word to
[2:24:38] describe the resurrection is pasca
[2:24:41] or Pascal which is referring to the
[2:24:45] sacrifice of the Lamb
[2:24:50] so or Pasha In some cultures it's called
[2:24:53] Pasha and it's describing this weekend
[2:24:59] in English and a few other languages
[2:25:02] they have borrowed a word from paganism
[2:25:05] I don't care how many articles you see
[2:25:10] telling you that Easter is not a pagan
[2:25:13] name it is
[2:25:15] it is the goddess of fertility somebody
[2:25:20] said but brother Branham said happy
[2:25:22] Easter and I say that's all right I
[2:25:24] might have said happy Easter back
[2:25:28] but I'm now many years after that
[2:25:32] I understand that it is not the most
[2:25:35] appropriate word to use
[2:25:38] and let me ask you a question I'm not
[2:25:41] going to go there some of you are
[2:25:43] already Dr I'm dragging some of you
[2:25:45] every inch of the way
[2:25:47] and I certainly don't want to go
[2:25:50] somewhere that would make you even be
[2:25:52] more quiet intense
[2:25:54] but I I must say
[2:25:57] why is it that even some of our
[2:26:00] Believers find it necessary to greet us
[2:26:03] today by saying happy Easter and happy
[2:26:07] Resurrection Day
[2:26:11] when I woke up this morning I saw so
[2:26:13] many of the message Believers saying
[2:26:15] things like happy Easter and happy
[2:26:18] Resurrection Day are you just trying to
[2:26:20] to remember a few of us Rebels are
[2:26:24] or do you truly know in your heart
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:30] perhaps you truly know in your heart
[2:26:33] there's a better word to describe this
[2:26:35] weekend
[2:26:36] somebody said what is it Feast of first
[2:26:38] fruits
[2:26:39] [Music]
[2:26:42] that's what we're celebrating today
[2:26:44] we're celebrating the resurrection I
[2:26:46] don't even if I were if I was gonna say
[2:26:49] something
[2:26:50] about a particular day I would call this
[2:26:53] Resurrection Day
[2:26:56] but then I would wonder what tomorrow is
[2:26:59] oh yeah
[2:27:01] isn't tomorrow Resurrection Day
[2:27:04] isn't Tuesday Resurrection Day because
[2:27:08] it's not a day in the first place
[2:27:11] Resurrection is a person
[2:27:13] Jesus said I am the resurrection and the
[2:27:18] life
[2:27:19] the African bride knows better than
[2:27:22] Easter
[2:27:24] the Asian bride knows better than Easter
[2:27:28] the the Hispanic bride knows better than
[2:27:31] Easter
[2:27:35] what's wrong with the American bride
[2:27:38] what's wrong with the Canadian bride now
[2:27:41] let's move on
[2:27:44] not for lack of good things to say I got
[2:27:46] plenty of good things
[2:27:48] to say
[2:27:49] I want you to go to Mark chapter 16. are
[2:27:51] you too tired for preaching today
[2:27:54] some of you are tired
[2:27:56] I've had to clap my hands to wake some
[2:27:58] of you up but I love you that's why I
[2:27:59] did it
[2:28:01] Mark chapter 16.
[2:28:03] verse 1 and 2 and when the Sabbath was
[2:28:06] passed now maybe I should just say here
[2:28:08] that's a problem with a message like
[2:28:10] this there's so many things to say
[2:28:12] foundationally
[2:28:14] because we didn't get to speak on the
[2:28:16] Passover last Sunday morning as we
[2:28:19] planned and I don't want to take too
[2:28:20] much time to do that now but here is
[2:28:24] where a lot of confusion has come in
[2:28:27] concerning the day of the crucifixion
[2:28:30] I have taught on this
[2:28:33] you can find I don't know where I don't
[2:28:36] know what name I don't know where to
[2:28:37] find it but I have taught on the Holy
[2:28:40] Week I have taught on the sequence of
[2:28:43] events
[2:28:44] I have made many enemies
[2:28:48] because the first thing they say was
[2:28:50] you're contradicting brother Branham and
[2:28:52] that would never be my goal
[2:28:56] that would never be my purpose
[2:28:59] but I am one of those
[2:29:03] hard-headed men
[2:29:05] who do not believe in Good Friday
[2:29:10] one of the reasons why I don't is I'm a
[2:29:13] purist
[2:29:15] which means I believe the word stands
[2:29:19] alone
[2:29:21] in its purest form my interpretation of
[2:29:26] the word must line up with the word
[2:29:29] itself
[2:29:31] and Jesus is very clear when he's
[2:29:35] teaching about Jonah in the belly of the
[2:29:38] whale how long the son of man must be in
[2:29:41] the belly of the Earth
[2:29:45] three days
[2:29:47] and three nights
[2:29:49] the modern Church tells us and this is
[2:29:52] totally erroneous
[2:29:54] there's no truth to this statement that
[2:29:56] I'm about to make that in Hebrew that
[2:29:59] any portion of a day constituted today
[2:30:02] that's absolutely false
[2:30:05] and that was taken from Roman culture
[2:30:09] not Hebrew has nothing to do with Hebrew
[2:30:14] has nothing to do with the Greek New
[2:30:16] Testament
[2:30:17] there's no such idea in Hebrew that you
[2:30:21] take any portion of a day you've got the
[2:30:24] whole day
[2:30:26] and there's no uh understanding in
[2:30:28] Hebrew I'm in trouble
[2:30:33] that any portion of a night is a whole
[2:30:36] night
[2:30:37] but even if there were
[2:30:41] if that was true how many nights from
[2:30:46] Friday at 3
[2:30:48] until
[2:30:49] let's just say until he rose
[2:30:53] Friday night
[2:30:56] Saturday night
[2:31:02] I'm sorry that doesn't fit
[2:31:05] the church
[2:31:07] interpretation
[2:31:10] I'm sorry that you may have some quotes
[2:31:13] that mention something a little
[2:31:16] different than that
[2:31:18] I can't preach what I can't see
[2:31:24] I'm responsible
[2:31:27] I felt like an Apostolic father the
[2:31:32] other day
[2:31:33] commending the church in tema
[2:31:37] you know when I first went there there
[2:31:40] are a small group of people
[2:31:42] but several times through the years the
[2:31:45] Lord used me to prophesy growth and
[2:31:47] expansion
[2:31:49] and brother Pastor Tay will tell you he
[2:31:52] told you when he was here
[2:31:53] that brother Shelley looked out into One
[2:31:55] Direction and he looked out in the other
[2:31:57] direction and he said one day I see them
[2:31:59] clear out that way and clear out that
[2:32:01] way in chairs
[2:32:03] and now the church is shaped just like
[2:32:05] that
[2:32:07] because what used to be the platform now
[2:32:09] sets in the middle of the church and now
[2:32:12] it is a huge facility of which you only
[2:32:14] saw a very small portion you didn't even
[2:32:17] see the whole front of the church you
[2:32:19] just saw a small portion on the front
[2:32:22] and I remember there's an air
[2:32:24] conditioner sitting on the platform now
[2:32:26] to cool the preachers
[2:32:30] and guess how I go virtually
[2:32:35] screen in the pulpit
[2:32:37] I mean God has blessed them with Souls
[2:32:40] not just materials Souls
[2:32:43] it's a fine fine building and on the
[2:32:47] pulpit
[2:32:50] it says something like this the Bible
[2:32:55] is our absolute
[2:32:57] [Music]
[2:33:02] and I felt like an Apostolic father the
[2:33:04] other day commending the church because
[2:33:07] if you have that understanding no wonder
[2:33:10] why hell fights you
[2:33:15] because we have no other absolute than
[2:33:18] the Bible
[2:33:21] everything the messenger said must line
[2:33:24] up with the Bible
[2:33:27] if we don't understand it we don't
[2:33:29] contradict it
[2:33:31] or point out the mistakes but we can't
[2:33:35] preach
[2:33:38] either what we don't understand
[2:33:41] or what does not exactly fit the
[2:33:43] scripture
[2:33:44] so for me to preach to you today that he
[2:33:47] was crucified on Friday Rose early on
[2:33:50] Sunday morning only gives two nights and
[2:33:53] Jesus himself gave the pattern three
[2:33:56] days
[2:33:57] and three nights as Jonah in the belly
[2:34:01] of the whale the son of man in the belly
[2:34:03] of the Earth
[2:34:04] now that should sell it but I don't
[2:34:06] didn't mean to say all that it wasn't in
[2:34:10] my notes
[2:34:11] but I said all that to say another thing
[2:34:14] that people forget is in the week of
[2:34:16] past Passover there are two sabbaths
[2:34:22] not just the weekly Sabbath Friday night
[2:34:25] it's Sunday on to Saturday night at
[2:34:26] sundown
[2:34:27] but there is a weekly Sabbath
[2:34:31] and when the Bible said he had to be
[2:34:33] taken down
[2:34:35] because it was the day of preparation
[2:34:37] for the Sabbath The Greek mind hundreds
[2:34:42] of years 325 A.D
[2:34:45] the Greek mind said okay that has to be
[2:34:50] Friday
[2:34:53] because Friday is the day before the
[2:34:55] Sabbath but the Hebrew mind knows
[2:34:58] that in the week of pesach Passover
[2:35:01] unleavened bread there are two sabbaths
[2:35:04] the High Sabbath of the holiday
[2:35:07] and the weekly Sabbath and he had to be
[2:35:10] crucified on the day before and taken
[2:35:13] down off the cross and already placed in
[2:35:16] the Tomb before the day of the of the
[2:35:18] High Sabbath
[2:35:20] not before the day of the weekly Sabbath
[2:35:23] if it was the day of the weekly Sabbath
[2:35:25] you cannot get
[2:35:28] relations right now I can show you a
[2:35:30] timeline but not today
[2:35:35] now Mark 16 1 2 and when the Sabbath was
[2:35:37] passed Saturday
[2:35:40] Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
[2:35:43] James
[2:35:45] and Salome
[2:35:48] had brought sweet spices
[2:35:52] that they might come
[2:35:55] and anoint him
[2:35:59] and very early in the morning
[2:36:06] the first day not in mark
[2:36:08] the first day of the week
[2:36:12] they came unto the Sepulcher
[2:36:16] at the rising of the Sun what does verse
[2:36:21] 3 say could you find it can someone read
[2:36:24] it out of your Bible
[2:36:33] they're worried about who is going to
[2:36:36] roll away the stone I'm not going to
[2:36:37] read the rest of that
[2:36:39] but if I should read the rest of it what
[2:36:42] will I find
[2:36:43] that when they got there at sunrise
[2:36:49] he was already gone
[2:36:52] [Music]
[2:36:55] because there was no Gregorian calendar
[2:37:01] Pope Gregory had not come along yet
[2:37:05] that's where it comes from it's Catholic
[2:37:08] just like Good Friday
[2:37:16] do you remember any of you remember in
[2:37:19] the 90s
[2:37:21] when I stayed in trouble all the time
[2:37:27] this is not some new doctrine
[2:37:29] we've been preaching this since God
[2:37:31] revealed it to us late 80s early 90s
[2:37:36] so yes a bit of a trailblazer
[2:37:40] but still find it very dangerous when
[2:37:44] you're tipping over sacred cows
[2:37:49] if you would have told me then that
[2:37:51] there would be more Catholicism around
[2:37:54] the message
[2:37:55] today
[2:37:58] than there was then I would have never
[2:38:01] believed it
[2:38:03] but the truth is there's more
[2:38:04] Catholicism around the message of the
[2:38:07] hour than there ever was before
[2:38:10] because you touch somebody's Easter
[2:38:13] bonnet
[2:38:19] you're not dealing with just a brother
[2:38:21] anymore
[2:38:22] you're dealing with a bear
[2:38:26] that's how hard they'll fight for
[2:38:28] something that has no historical root
[2:38:31] except
[2:38:32] post nicaea
[2:38:35] and if if nicaea is responsible for the
[2:38:40] twisting of the godhead
[2:38:43] how can I trust nicaea how can I trust
[2:38:47] the early church fathers if they can't
[2:38:49] teach the right godhead and the right
[2:38:52] baptism
[2:38:55] how can I trust their interpretation of
[2:38:57] holidays
[2:38:58] including Holy Week
[2:39:03] the Bible says here that very early as
[2:39:05] the sun was coming up the women get to
[2:39:08] the tomb
[2:39:12] just before their Easter Sunrise Service
[2:39:16] wants to begin
[2:39:19] and what they found was an empty tomb
[2:39:27] now let's read it in Luke
[2:39:29] excuse me let's read it in John
[2:39:37] no I think I
[2:39:39] I think I meant to say
[2:39:43] I think I I put John but I I think I was
[2:39:47] going to put something else to be back
[2:39:53] I'll just take a little water while I'm
[2:39:55] back here
[2:40:01] I won't take time to get a red hot
[2:40:04] but I'll get water
[2:40:08] you all still here
[2:40:11] um
[2:40:13] that old virus
[2:40:15] may have
[2:40:17] delayed us
[2:40:19] but it didn't stop us
[2:40:25] now that was Mark now it might be luke I
[2:40:28] wanna
[2:40:29] read I don't I don't think it was John I
[2:40:32] picked up John for another reason
[2:40:38] yeah yeah it is John
[2:40:41] John chapter 20.
[2:40:44] verse 1.
[2:40:47] the first day of the week
[2:40:50] cometh Mary Magdalene
[2:40:55] early
[2:41:05] The sun hadn't risen yet
[2:41:13] it is the rising of the Sun s-o-n
[2:41:17] but the son Rose before the issue in
[2:41:20] that morning
[2:41:23] oh that was good
[2:41:27] if we wanted to make enemies that'd be a
[2:41:29] good meme
[2:41:33] on that one
[2:41:36] that one on that one morning the son
[2:41:39] Rose before the s-u-n
[2:41:43] because we know by scripture that the
[2:41:46] evening and the morning
[2:41:49] are the first day
[2:41:53] when the sun uh the day according to
[2:41:55] scripture doesn't begin at sunrise
[2:41:59] it begins at sunset
[2:42:02] and so very shortly
[2:42:06] after sunset
[2:42:10] the s-o-n
[2:42:13] INE
[2:42:15] got up
[2:42:18] very early when it was yet dark they got
[2:42:22] to the Sepulcher and guess what they
[2:42:24] found that even before the sun was up it
[2:42:29] was still dark and seeth the stone taken
[2:42:34] away from the Sepulcher Hallelujah
[2:42:38] how many of you love the word
[2:42:41] then she runeth and cometh to Simon
[2:42:45] Peter and to the other disciples whom
[2:42:49] Jesus loved who was at
[2:42:52] John and saith unto them they have taken
[2:42:55] away the Lord
[2:42:57] out of the Sepulcher and we know not
[2:43:00] where they have laid him oh she didn't
[2:43:03] have Abraham's faith
[2:43:07] she didn't have Resurrection faith that
[2:43:09] morning
[2:43:10] she thought his body had been stolen and
[2:43:12] put in another place Peter therefore
[2:43:15] went forth and that other disciple John
[2:43:17] and came to the Sepulcher they ran on so
[2:43:21] they ran both together and the other
[2:43:23] disciple John No Doubt
[2:43:28] the Bible is clear and John is writing
[2:43:31] the book
[2:43:34] so he gets to tell it like it really was
[2:43:39] when I tell my story I'm going to tell
[2:43:42] it like it really was
[2:43:44] [Applause]
[2:43:45] they both ran together and the other
[2:43:47] disciples he didn't care if his name was
[2:43:49] in it or not
[2:43:51] but he wanted him to know that he outrun
[2:43:53] Peter
[2:43:59] that extra donut didn't hinder John that
[2:44:02] morning
[2:44:05] he did outrun Peter and came for
[2:44:07] pink replica and he's stooping down and
[2:44:10] looking in saw the linen cloth lying yet
[2:44:14] when he not in
[2:44:17] then cometh Simon Peter following him he
[2:44:20] says it again
[2:44:23] always a late Comer
[2:44:26] and went into the Sepulcher and see if
[2:44:29] the linen clothes lie
[2:44:31] and the napkin that was about his head
[2:44:34] not lying with the linen clothes but
[2:44:37] wrapped together in a place by itself
[2:44:40] they went in also that other disciple
[2:44:43] which came first
[2:44:49] to the Sepulcher and he saw
[2:44:53] [Music]
[2:44:56] John didn't say oh where have they laid
[2:45:00] him
[2:45:02] John didn't say where have they stolen
[2:45:06] him away too
[2:45:09] he saw
[2:45:14] and believed
[2:45:15] for as yet they knew not the scripture
[2:45:17] that he must Rise Again from the dead
[2:45:20] then the disciples went away again unto
[2:45:23] their own home now they might not have
[2:45:26] ever read it in the scripture but they
[2:45:28] heard what he said
[2:45:30] they just heard it with natural ears
[2:45:33] he said just just a little piece from
[2:45:36] now not one stone
[2:45:41] that you see in this Temple is going to
[2:45:43] be sitting on top of one another
[2:45:46] but don't you worry because in three
[2:45:48] days I'll raise it up again
[2:45:51] this spaky of his own body
[2:45:53] he wasn't talking about just the temple
[2:45:55] in the natural he was talking about the
[2:45:57] temple of God then the disciples went
[2:46:00] away again unto their own home let's
[2:46:03] catch eight more verses
[2:46:05] but Mary stood without it the Sepulcher
[2:46:08] weeping
[2:46:11] and as she wept she stooped down and
[2:46:14] looked into the Sepulcher
[2:46:19] and see if two angels in white
[2:46:24] sitting
[2:46:26] don't be so sure
[2:46:29] you know anything about angels
[2:46:37] they don't all look the same
[2:46:40] foreign
[2:46:42] they don't all behave the same
[2:46:48] I met an angel in the spirit not too too
[2:46:51] long ago
[2:46:52] and he baffled my mind I
[2:46:54] I want to tell this I've wanted to tell
[2:46:57] it and I don't want to tell it
[2:46:59] but he baffled my mind
[2:47:01] he was unlike any other Angel of the
[2:47:03] Lord that I had ever met before and I
[2:47:06] didn't even know that there could be a
[2:47:08] non-holiness angel
[2:47:12] he was holy
[2:47:15] but he wasn't holiness
[2:47:18] not by Earth standard
[2:47:20] he was holy
[2:47:22] but when he appeared to me he appeared
[2:47:24] to me with a bare chest
[2:47:27] and I want you to know
[2:47:30] the fear of the Lord struck me to my
[2:47:35] knees
[2:47:37] be careful what you what you think
[2:47:42] when you think you have learned
[2:47:44] something
[2:47:45] about angels
[2:47:48] for there are many many many
[2:47:50] Heavenly hosts
[2:47:52] there are many Heavenly Creatures
[2:47:55] yes
[2:47:57] when the Bible said Heavenly Host he
[2:47:59] doesn't just mean myriads of angels that
[2:48:01] all look alike and talk a light and
[2:48:03] sound to light and dress alike and act
[2:48:05] alike
[2:48:07] there's angels of his presence that
[2:48:10] Usher us into the presence of the Lord
[2:48:12] but there's also warring angels
[2:48:15] [Applause]
[2:48:17] and I met mine for the first time in my
[2:48:19] life
[2:48:21] and I want to tell you something
[2:48:22] everything is going to be all right
[2:48:28] [Applause]
[2:48:29] when I got up over my knees I said I
[2:48:32] have no need to worry
[2:48:37] because everything is going to be all
[2:48:40] right
[2:48:42] the Lord is the Lord of hosts the
[2:48:44] captain of the whole the lord of the
[2:48:46] battle and with an angel like that
[2:48:52] I see some of you looking strange
[2:49:00] well
[2:49:02] I had an experience in Jerusalem where
[2:49:06] Angels crowded into my bedroom it's
[2:49:09] written you can read it for yourself
[2:49:11] Angels Came one morning and crowded into
[2:49:14] my bedroom and I had never seen such an
[2:49:17] Eclectic group of of anything in all my
[2:49:20] life
[2:49:21] and and I was most delighted to find
[2:49:23] that some are Hefty
[2:49:30] some have been eating too much show
[2:49:32] bread if you know what I mean
[2:49:35] a literally
[2:49:42] were heavy and they were all coming in
[2:49:45] rushing in
[2:49:49] I shouldn't have told that this morning
[2:49:51] but I should have I should have judged
[2:49:53] the looks on some of your faces when I
[2:49:55] described an angel without his shirt on
[2:50:04] he must have been cutting the grass like
[2:50:06] brother Brandon
[2:50:08] because brother Branham didn't wear his
[2:50:10] shirt to cut the grass
[2:50:12] but he didn't parade up and down the
[2:50:14] street trying to be sexy did he
[2:50:16] neither did this angel
[2:50:21] he wasn't coming to be attractive
[2:50:24] he was coming to let me know
[2:50:26] that he had been specially built
[2:50:31] I'll go a little bit further than that
[2:50:35] I put my finger in his belly
[2:50:41] and my finger buried up
[2:50:46] in his AB
[2:50:48] between his abdominal muscles my finger
[2:50:52] went in
[2:50:54] because he was so well defined
[2:50:57] and so strong
[2:51:01] I could say it's something else but I
[2:51:04] won't
[2:51:05] there was a fragrance
[2:51:08] like I have never smelt before
[2:51:13] God was
[2:51:15] he sent me that just like he sent me
[2:51:17] those angels in Jerusalem I'm I I anyway
[2:51:20] I'm not going to do a disclaimer now
[2:51:25] he wanted me to know and they were
[2:51:27] giggling
[2:51:28] yes
[2:51:30] these Angels were pushing in and as one
[2:51:33] by one and you'd think that there
[2:51:35] couldn't be a room for another one but
[2:51:37] here come another one
[2:51:39] and another one until they were
[2:51:41] literally standing in my bedroom in
[2:51:43] Jerusalem and some of them were twisted
[2:51:45] like this
[2:51:47] because there were so many in such a
[2:51:49] small space and the Lord began to reveal
[2:51:52] to me
[2:51:54] can you all find me the scripture where
[2:51:56] it says they have longed to look into
[2:52:01] this is what God gave me that morning
[2:52:03] I'm already over time and over
[2:52:06] over over theology some way past some
[2:52:10] people's theological let me see if all
[2:52:13] my streamers have left me too
[2:52:15] any of your streamers still out there
[2:52:18] I could use an amen
[2:52:21] I could over down the eight on Facebook
[2:52:27] I hope it's not because they've moved on
[2:52:29] to the Easter egg hunt
[2:52:32] nine somebody just jumped on Facebook
[2:52:35] then
[2:52:37] are we getting any preach it somebody
[2:52:40] said that's all I needed to hear
[2:52:45] there's 30 or more on YouTube I don't
[2:52:48] know how many on the app
[2:52:49] first Peter is it
[2:52:52] would you just put it up
[2:52:56] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[2:52:59] themselves but unto us
[2:53:02] they did Minister the things
[2:53:05] which are now reported unto you by them
[2:53:08] that have preached the gospel unto you
[2:53:11] with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[2:53:14] heaven read the next phrase
[2:53:25] the Lord spoke to my heart and he said
[2:53:27] they follow the Heirs of salvation
[2:53:32] they want to see and understand what
[2:53:36] makes you who you are
[2:53:39] and when God is doing something
[2:53:41] Redemptive in your life even the angels
[2:53:45] come close
[2:53:51] even the angels come close to look in to
[2:53:55] see what God is doing in you if that
[2:53:57] don't bless you you're unblissable today
[2:54:01] to think that God is doing such a
[2:54:03] beautiful work in your life it is
[2:54:07] that angels have desired to come and
[2:54:11] look in and see what the Lord is doing
[2:54:14] in you
[2:54:23] it's 150.
[2:54:31] let's go back to my I mean I can't I
[2:54:33] can't finish
[2:54:35] I hadn't preached on first fruits
[2:54:38] see two angels sitting in White in white
[2:54:41] sitting the one at the head and the
[2:54:43] other at the feet where the body of
[2:54:45] Jesus had lained
[2:54:50] he's not there no more
[2:54:52] but the angels are still still hovering
[2:54:55] near
[2:54:56] where his body laid
[2:54:58] there's a message there but we'll move
[2:55:00] on
[2:55:02] and they say unto her woman
[2:55:04] the angel woman
[2:55:07] why weep is thou
[2:55:09] just like they didn't know
[2:55:11] she saith unto them because they have
[2:55:14] taken away my Lord and I know not where
[2:55:17] they have laid him John is out there
[2:55:19] believing
[2:55:21] Peter's scratching his head wondering
[2:55:24] what's going to happen to him
[2:55:26] if Jesus has risen from the dead
[2:55:32] he's out there wondering I may be
[2:55:34] big trouble
[2:55:37] John is praising God for letting him be
[2:55:40] a believer and the women are still
[2:55:42] trying to figure out where they've hit
[2:55:44] him
[2:55:46] and when she had thus said she turned
[2:55:49] herself back
[2:55:52] and saw Jesus standing not in the Tomb
[2:55:56] outside the tomb
[2:55:58] and he looked different than he did when
[2:56:00] he went in the Tomb
[2:56:02] and she didn't even know it was him
[2:56:05] let's read on
[2:56:06] Jesus saith unto her woman why weepest
[2:56:09] thou whom seeketh thou she's supposing
[2:56:12] him to be the gardener saith unto him
[2:56:14] sir
[2:56:16] I'm glad she didn't compliment his roses
[2:56:19] she said sir if thou have borne him
[2:56:22] hence
[2:56:23] tell me where thou has laid him and I
[2:56:26] will take him away
[2:56:28] Jesus saith unto her Mary
[2:56:34] I assure you he didn't
[2:56:41] the name Mary had not even been formed
[2:56:47] it was a Greek name but it actually
[2:56:49] followed this time period
[2:56:52] we have a Greek New Testament so
[2:56:55] translated Greek to English it says Mary
[2:56:57] her name was Mary
[2:57:00] but in Hebrew her name was Miriam
[2:57:05] Jesus said unto her Miriam
[2:57:12] and it's kind of like the little kid in
[2:57:14] the in the shook
[2:57:17] who says Abba
[2:57:20] EMA
[2:57:24] in the in the mom or the dad can
[2:57:26] distinguish that sheep's cry
[2:57:29] from all the other sheep that are crying
[2:57:32] there was something about the way she
[2:57:35] said he said there was something about
[2:57:38] the way he said her name
[2:57:44] Miriam
[2:57:46] or Mary
[2:57:51] if he had a little bit of a drawl and I
[2:57:53] think maybe he did he said Mary
[2:57:56] am
[2:57:58] she turned herself and saith unto him
[2:58:01] raboni
[2:58:04] Rebel
[2:58:08] not rabbi
[2:58:11] rabbi
[2:58:14] it's teacher
[2:58:17] it's master
[2:58:25] try it sometime
[2:58:29] oh master
[2:58:37] rabonai
[2:58:40] Rebel nigh
[2:58:45] the next verse
[2:58:47] and Jesus saith unto her touch me not
[2:58:50] for I am not yet ascended to my father
[2:58:54] I could preach all day long on this
[2:58:58] for I am not yet ascended to my father
[2:59:00] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[2:59:03] I Ascend unto my father and your father
[2:59:06] and to my God and to your God
[2:59:09] Mary Magdalene came and told the
[2:59:12] disciples that she had seen the Lord and
[2:59:14] that he had spoken these things unto her
[2:59:17] I wonder how they responded I wonder if
[2:59:19] they all believed her
[2:59:21] I wonder if you take this to the Chosen
[2:59:24] and your concept of of the disciples
[2:59:27] from The Chosen and how they how they
[2:59:29] because Mary was a broken woman
[2:59:33] I wonder if there was some doubt among
[2:59:35] them and and I wonder if there was any
[2:59:36] vying among them well why why would he
[2:59:39] reveal himself to her first
[2:59:42] I don't know
[2:59:44] it doesn't matter
[2:59:46] John didn't need John didn't need him to
[2:59:49] say johannen
[2:59:52] he just saw the empty tomb
[2:59:54] I'm a Believer
[2:59:58] Peters
[3:00:01] this is true
[3:00:05] he may hand me my hand in on a platter I
[3:00:09] may be getting in trouble
[3:00:12] and Mary
[3:00:14] dear Gardener where have you taken the
[3:00:16] Lord but when he called her name it
[3:00:19] changed everything now I want you to
[3:00:21] know
[3:00:22] that he could not fulfill the Feast of
[3:00:27] firstfruits
[3:00:29] by raising from the dead alone
[3:00:34] he then had to be raised up
[3:00:41] and waved over the heads
[3:00:44] of the congregation
[3:00:46] whether they saw it or not
[3:00:49] how many of you know a few days later I
[3:00:51] don't have time to go there but how many
[3:00:53] of you know a few days later Thomas is
[3:00:55] troubled
[3:00:57] Jesus comes to the disciples in an upper
[3:01:00] room in a chamber somewhere and he
[3:01:03] doesn't use the door
[3:01:08] he just walks through the wall
[3:01:10] [Music]
[3:01:13] which is a lot easier than most people
[3:01:15] could begin to realize
[3:01:18] he just walked right through the wall
[3:01:31] find it give me the scripture I didn't I
[3:01:34] didn't pull it up because I wasn't going
[3:01:35] to preach on it I was going to preach on
[3:01:37] first fruits
[3:01:40] we could come back and
[3:01:43] 20 and 19.
[3:01:45] we could come back in a few hours to do
[3:01:47] some more
[3:01:52] we got once a year to strike this
[3:01:57] John
[3:01:59] 2019 did you say
[3:02:06] all these 15 pages or 12 Pages whatever
[3:02:09] it was didn't do me much good did he 13
[3:02:12] pages
[3:02:15] then the same day at evening being the
[3:02:17] first day of the week
[3:02:19] this is Sunday night
[3:02:22] when the doors were shut where the
[3:02:24] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[3:02:26] Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst
[3:02:31] and saith unto them peace be unto you
[3:02:34] we got to go on
[3:02:36] and when he had so sad they showed unto
[3:02:39] them
[3:02:40] he showed unto them his hands and his
[3:02:45] side
[3:02:46] then were the disciples glad when they
[3:02:49] saw the Lord can you imagine
[3:02:53] he had to show them proof
[3:02:57] because people walked through walls all
[3:03:00] the time
[3:03:04] think about it
[3:03:07] the word it's worded that way for you to
[3:03:09] get it can you get it he didn't come
[3:03:12] through the closed door
[3:03:14] he walked through the wall he's standing
[3:03:17] there and they still he still knows he
[3:03:20] knows he's got to prove himself and when
[3:03:22] he had so Sandy let's go on
[3:03:26] then said Jesus to them again peace be
[3:03:28] unto you Shalom that's my father has
[3:03:31] sent me even so send I you is Thomas
[3:03:32] coming up in this one
[3:03:34] go to 26 for me
[3:03:36] well well let's get this don't don't go
[3:03:38] away from that one charity we've really
[3:03:40] worked you haven't we
[3:03:43] smile a little bit
[3:03:46] and when he had said this he
[3:04:02] the Holy Ghost couldn't come down
[3:04:05] until he went up
[3:04:07] [Music]
[3:04:10] you think he ever breathed on any of the
[3:04:12] disciples before
[3:04:15] you think they ever smelt garlic on his
[3:04:17] breath before
[3:04:20] you think they slept close enough and
[3:04:22] lived close enough that they ever had an
[3:04:25] encounter with his breath before yes and
[3:04:27] they didn't receive the Holy Ghost did
[3:04:29] they
[3:04:31] but he has now become the first fruit
[3:04:35] offering
[3:04:37] he is now the first son to come to
[3:04:41] Resurrection and maturity
[3:04:45] he has now ascended to his father he did
[3:04:49] not ascend from the grave
[3:04:53] what happened in the grave
[3:04:55] he descended
[3:04:59] the most ridiculous thing is this this
[3:05:02] Catholic Church in all of her prostitute
[3:05:05] daughters
[3:05:06] have now been close it's Ash Wednesday
[3:05:10] and Monday Monday
[3:05:15] Thursday in the original it's an Ian
[3:05:18] mondi
[3:05:19] Thursday
[3:05:22] Good Friday
[3:05:25] silent
[3:05:27] Saturday
[3:05:30] well there wasn't a whole lot going on
[3:05:32] in the graveyard that you could hear
[3:05:36] but he was not silent
[3:05:39] brother Greeley told you
[3:05:42] he descended Into the Heart of the earth
[3:05:44] LED captivity captive gave gifts unto
[3:05:47] men
[3:05:48] [Applause]
[3:05:52] he walked right into Paradise
[3:05:57] there was only a gulf between paradise
[3:05:59] and Hell
[3:06:01] Abraham's bosom being Paradise hell
[3:06:04] being the place of Torment a great Gulf
[3:06:07] fix between them Jesus tells us
[3:06:11] I hear people talking about the parable
[3:06:13] of Lazarus except it wasn't a parable
[3:06:16] Lazarus wasn't a parable he was a real
[3:06:18] beggar that laid it a real rich man's
[3:06:21] table
[3:06:22] who wanted to come back from Paradise he
[3:06:25] wanted to leave Abraham's bosom and go
[3:06:28] tell his his proud haughty Brothers
[3:06:31] that there's a right way
[3:06:33] Jesus said if you should race from the
[3:06:35] dead they wouldn't believe you they
[3:06:36] wouldn't leave a man sent from the dead
[3:06:41] so he goes into Paradise
[3:06:44] and reveals himself to the Jews who have
[3:06:47] died under the Covenant
[3:06:51] think about it Abraham
[3:06:55] oh very I saw him on the mountain
[3:06:59] that's him yeah
[3:07:02] he was the ram called in the thicket
[3:07:05] I see him I know who he is
[3:07:09] Shadrach Meshach into bed and It Go said
[3:07:12] there he is
[3:07:13] that's the Fourth Man In The Fire
[3:07:16] Ezekiel said that's who he is the wheel
[3:07:19] within the wheel
[3:07:20] [Applause]
[3:07:22] Isaiah said there he is the conception
[3:07:25] of a virgin in the Holy Ghost
[3:07:34] no extra for that
[3:07:38] powerful
[3:07:40] David said he's the one that hovered
[3:07:43] over me as I sung his Praises on the
[3:07:46] hills of Zion
[3:07:52] for those of you who saw the podcast
[3:07:55] that's what I was preaching
[3:07:58] the night that brother and sister
[3:08:00] Cleveland came to my church The Way of
[3:08:03] Holiness Revival Center in South
[3:08:05] Carolina I was preaching that it was
[3:08:08] Easter Sunday night
[3:08:10] and I was preaching that message
[3:08:13] and that's what made them think
[3:08:16] or or maybe it was on the radio I'd said
[3:08:18] something like that on the radio
[3:08:21] I don't to be honest with you I'm pretty
[3:08:23] sure that's how it was I had preached
[3:08:25] that at our church on on Easter Sunday
[3:08:28] night and that part had played on the
[3:08:31] radio and she heard it that's how it was
[3:08:33] and that's what made her think that I
[3:08:36] had heard of brother Branham because he
[3:08:38] tells us that story several times of
[3:08:40] what it would have been like in Paradise
[3:08:42] as they began to see some powerful
[3:08:44] things took place right
[3:08:46] because then he marches down or before
[3:08:49] he marches over into hell
[3:08:53] carrying all of our sins with him
[3:08:56] he goes over and takes off the the look
[3:09:00] you know the devil don't even have the
[3:09:02] key to his own house
[3:09:05] because Jesus just walks Right Through
[3:09:07] the flames
[3:09:12] ain't nobody trying to stop him don't
[3:09:14] you get some drama in your mind there
[3:09:17] ain't no demon trying to stop him
[3:09:20] they've all rolled over
[3:09:24] he just walks right down through there I
[3:09:26] love I love
[3:09:28] you
[3:09:31] he just walks right down through the
[3:09:33] midst of them
[3:09:34] if you'd have heard anything it would
[3:09:36] have been
[3:09:40] because the Flames couldn't even touch
[3:09:42] him
[3:09:43] and he walks right over to Satan
[3:09:45] somebody said he snatched it didn't know
[3:09:46] didn't have to
[3:09:48] all they did was
[3:09:53] I don't even know if he said hand him
[3:09:55] over
[3:10:03] Devil's doing everything he can to hand
[3:10:05] the keys over
[3:10:07] to death Helen how do you know he still
[3:10:09] has them because he appears in
[3:10:11] Revelation with the keys of death Hell
[3:10:13] In The Grave he who Revelation 19 didn't
[3:10:16] it he who is faithful and true
[3:10:19] he's got him with him
[3:10:22] and then the Bible says maybe he stops
[3:10:26] back by Paradise I don't know the exact
[3:10:28] order of how things were but it could be
[3:10:30] that he stops back by paradise and
[3:10:32] hollers in the door come on y'all
[3:10:38] because he empties Paradise
[3:10:41] how do you know that because the Bible
[3:10:43] tells us
[3:10:46] that when that veil of the temple was
[3:10:49] written in Twain many of the Saints
[3:10:51] which slept a rose
[3:10:59] somebody said well that doesn't quite
[3:11:00] seem like the right order I don't
[3:11:02] understand how how all that happens
[3:11:05] maybe some maybe some were emptied out
[3:11:08] that we're going to see him in his
[3:11:10] glorified body and receive him through
[3:11:12] salvation on the earth maybe some of the
[3:11:15] older Old Testament Saints stayed there
[3:11:18] waiting on him I don't know how it
[3:11:20] happened but I know that in at least two
[3:11:23] installments
[3:11:24] he emptied it out
[3:11:29] what I know is there was nobody
[3:11:32] not one
[3:11:34] who said that ain't the one we've been
[3:11:35] waiting on
[3:11:37] [Applause]
[3:11:39] nobody stopped back into hell
[3:11:44] those that hadn't already left left with
[3:11:46] him that day
[3:11:48] he goes into the grave
[3:11:51] now this the Assemblies of God Church
[3:11:53] used to teach us that before he appeared
[3:11:56] in the resurrection he went to the
[3:11:59] father and he came back came back to the
[3:12:01] Earth that's what the church used to
[3:12:03] teach but we have a problem with that
[3:12:06] he said to Mary don't touch me
[3:12:10] I have not yet ascended to my father
[3:12:15] now let's read Thomas's story here we
[3:12:17] got to go home
[3:12:20] and after eight days again his disciples
[3:12:23] were within and Thomas with them then
[3:12:26] came Jesus the doors being shut and
[3:12:30] stood in the midst and said Peace be
[3:12:32] unto you then saith he to Thomas
[3:12:37] reach hither thy finger
[3:12:41] behold my hands reach hither thy hand
[3:12:45] thrust it into my side and be not
[3:12:47] faithless but believing
[3:12:50] and Thomas answered and said unto him my
[3:12:53] Lord
[3:12:55] and my God
[3:13:01] you know the church has condemned Thomas
[3:13:07] they've called him an old doubter and
[3:13:11] harassed him and talked so bad about him
[3:13:15] I like to think I would have been a John
[3:13:22] probably would have been more like a
[3:13:24] Peter
[3:13:26] I'm in trouble now
[3:13:30] could have been like a Mary
[3:13:33] he's lost to us
[3:13:37] but I could have very possibly have been
[3:13:40] a Thomas
[3:13:45] didn't benefit from from some of the
[3:13:48] experiences of the other disciples and
[3:13:55] he was built differently than they were
[3:13:57] all built quite differently weren't they
[3:14:01] and he just wanted a little physical
[3:14:03] evidence
[3:14:05] just let me put my hand
[3:14:07] he didn't ask
[3:14:09] Jesus knew what he needed
[3:14:13] when I was seven years old and God
[3:14:15] filled me with the Holy Ghost the way he
[3:14:17] did he knew what I needed
[3:14:22] everybody don't get it the same way he
[3:14:25] knew what I needed
[3:14:26] so that I would never be talked out of
[3:14:29] it again
[3:14:30] God knew what Thomas needed so he would
[3:14:32] never be tucked talked out of it again
[3:14:34] so I have to be honest I have no
[3:14:36] judgment
[3:14:37] no condemnation on Thomas because I know
[3:14:40] some Thomases
[3:14:45] I saw some in here a moment ago
[3:14:50] and I talked about a bare-chested angel
[3:14:52] well you say but I've never seen a bare
[3:14:54] chested Angel nor had I
[3:15:00] but you do reach a place in your
[3:15:02] Supernatural walk with God where it's
[3:15:05] easier for you to believe
[3:15:07] than it is to misbelief
[3:15:10] I found the place that's all I'm saying
[3:15:12] I found that place
[3:15:16] when you come and tell me the Lord said
[3:15:19] he showed me I dreamed a dream I had a
[3:15:22] thought
[3:15:25] when somebody texted me Saturday night
[3:15:27] and said I saw the light I saw the color
[3:15:30] I saw this in the service
[3:15:33] when I hear the things that I hear on a
[3:15:36] weekly basis from people who have
[3:15:38] encountered the Lord in some way it is
[3:15:41] easier for me
[3:15:44] to believe that God has done that for
[3:15:48] you
[3:15:49] than it is for me to doubt
[3:15:53] somebody said well you're believing the
[3:15:55] Lord yes but I cannot imagine why
[3:15:59] anybody would want to lie about
[3:16:03] something that the Lord did
[3:16:07] I know there are people who've lied
[3:16:10] I know there are people who have scammed
[3:16:15] I know that in the 50s when brother
[3:16:17] Branham was having great healing lines
[3:16:20] and casting Devils out that there were
[3:16:22] some men on the field putting frogs in
[3:16:25] jars
[3:16:27] and telling people this is a demon that
[3:16:29] I cast out of a woman last night
[3:16:34] there were all kinds of things the sign
[3:16:36] of the blood
[3:16:39] where blood was flowing out of the palms
[3:16:42] of people's hands Stigmata I believe
[3:16:44] it's called
[3:16:46] and some of that may have been real I
[3:16:49] wasn't there but some of it was fate
[3:16:52] and when those healing evangelists came
[3:16:55] through Columbus and they caught him
[3:16:57] with a with a microphone
[3:17:00] and an earpiece
[3:17:03] and they told them don't you ever come
[3:17:05] back to this city again or we will run
[3:17:08] you out with tar and feather
[3:17:12] that man went on to have a very
[3:17:14] successful television Ministry
[3:17:17] but the people the the ushers were
[3:17:19] feeding him information
[3:17:22] because the technology had now come
[3:17:25] along
[3:17:26] that could fool the people
[3:17:30] when brother Branham was operating in
[3:17:32] the gift of the prayer card and knowing
[3:17:35] what was on the prayer card there was
[3:17:36] nobody to tell brother Branham what was
[3:17:38] on the card
[3:17:41] and some of the most profound Miracles
[3:17:43] were under were not even on a Prayer
[3:17:46] card or underneath the prayer card and
[3:17:48] some of the diseases that brother
[3:17:50] Branham called out were diseases that
[3:17:52] the people didn't want to mention
[3:17:55] because they thought it might put them
[3:17:56] to the end of the line
[3:18:00] they thought it might be too serious and
[3:18:02] if someone read that they would never
[3:18:04] get called because they weren't always
[3:18:06] calling them by numbers
[3:18:08] in the early days they weren't using the
[3:18:10] number system they were just randomly
[3:18:12] calling cards
[3:18:14] they were numbered
[3:18:17] but they were looking at the cards
[3:18:19] and calling people by the number
[3:18:23] where later he would say we'll take
[3:18:26] tonight prayer card 50 to 100.
[3:18:32] it was so Supernatural in brother
[3:18:34] branham's day that a man came and put a
[3:18:37] whole bunch of stuff on a card that
[3:18:39] wasn't real
[3:18:43] and he comes through the prayer line
[3:18:44] going to expose brother Branham as a
[3:18:46] fake and instead of brother Brandon
[3:18:49] praying over him for those diseases he
[3:18:51] said now God's going to make a sign of
[3:18:52] this
[3:18:54] and although you didn't come in here
[3:18:56] with those diseases
[3:18:58] you now have everything written on the
[3:19:00] card
[3:19:03] he sealed his faith
[3:19:06] as pretty serious
[3:19:08] Supernatural fooling around
[3:19:21] what does a man do when he never got to
[3:19:22] his
[3:19:24] punchline
[3:19:27] no no no you say that but I like to
[3:19:30] never got y'all going in the first place
[3:19:34] you ain't fooling me brother Austin I
[3:19:37] had to clap my hands for you
[3:19:43] would you wide awake now
[3:19:51] I saw one of those little memes one time
[3:19:55] said something like there's one in every
[3:19:57] Church
[3:19:59] and it was a little one one little
[3:20:01] sister or two crying out preacher
[3:20:05] stop now
[3:20:10] we got ours
[3:20:13] and I know they get judged sometimes
[3:20:15] sister Joyce and sister
[3:20:17] Sharon and sometimes sister flow and
[3:20:20] whoever else says preach on come on
[3:20:23] and Austin now that I've
[3:20:26] mildly whooped him let me let me let me
[3:20:29] let me prop him up
[3:20:32] he's one of the first to say come on
[3:20:39] but if I were to really kick in here I
[3:20:42] don't know what had happened
[3:20:43] musicians are coming
[3:20:46] Lord of Mercy
[3:20:56] so he went to the father
[3:21:00] he fulfilled the Feast of first fruits
[3:21:03] he became the Sheaf
[3:21:06] raised from the dead
[3:21:10] waved over the heads of the people
[3:21:17] he was the beginning can I just do a
[3:21:20] just another
[3:21:21] two or three minutes here
[3:21:25] he became to the beginning
[3:21:28] of the new creation
[3:21:32] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14.
[3:21:35] Jesus said
[3:21:37] red letter
[3:21:40] Amplified
[3:21:42] and to the angel
[3:21:44] messenger of the Assembly Church
[3:21:48] in laodicea right
[3:21:50] these are the words of the amen
[3:21:54] the trusty and faithful and true witness
[3:21:57] the origin
[3:22:00] and beginning
[3:22:02] an author
[3:22:04] of God's creation
[3:22:08] Jesus was the beginning
[3:22:11] of the father's creation
[3:22:15] he was a new creature
[3:22:17] he was a new creation
[3:22:20] in the message why it had to be Shepherd
[3:22:24] brother Branham said in paragraph 92 the
[3:22:27] first time Angels ever sang at a
[3:22:29] celebration was in heaven
[3:22:30] if you look in Job 38 7 I see some of
[3:22:34] you taking notes when God first planned
[3:22:36] on making his first creation the Earth
[3:22:38] job was a great smart man and he had all
[3:22:42] kinds of wisdom
[3:22:45] he said when I go up to the markets the
[3:22:48] young princes they all bowed before me
[3:22:50] and just want a moment of my wisdom and
[3:22:53] he couldn't figure out why he had to be
[3:22:55] treated the way he was
[3:22:57] and so God asked him said gird yourself
[3:22:59] up like a man because I'm coming down to
[3:23:02] talk to you
[3:23:04] and when God came down in a whirlwind
[3:23:08] he said job where was you
[3:23:14] where were you before I laid the
[3:23:17] foundations of the Earth when the
[3:23:19] morning Stars sang together and uh
[3:23:27] that's not angels
[3:23:30] the angels are not the sons of God
[3:23:33] the Bible said as many as are led by the
[3:23:37] spirit they are the sons of God the sons
[3:23:40] of God are the redeemed
[3:23:42] and there they were before the world was
[3:23:44] being framed there they were shouting
[3:23:47] for Joy before the Living God where were
[3:23:50] you and he was deflated at that time
[3:23:54] where was you see the first time Angels
[3:23:56] ever sang at a celebration was in heaven
[3:24:00] the next paragraph 94 there
[3:24:05] but the first time they ever sang on
[3:24:07] Earth was to Shepherds at the birth of
[3:24:09] God
[3:24:13] wasn't he
[3:24:15] Emmanuel on Earth first human beings
[3:24:19] ever heard an angel sing was humble
[3:24:21] Shepherds
[3:24:24] now one more message and I'm closing I
[3:24:26] really am you better have a song Ben
[3:24:31] why it had to be Shepherd same sermon
[3:24:34] but paragraph 97
[3:24:37] now notice God is fixing to make another
[3:24:39] creation here's what I've got to say
[3:24:44] if Jesus was the first fruits
[3:24:47] of them which slept
[3:24:49] in Corinthians says he was and we'll
[3:24:52] pick that scripture up
[3:24:54] he was the first son to come to full
[3:24:57] maturity and to defeat death with
[3:24:59] Resurrection Life
[3:25:00] then there had to be sons that would
[3:25:03] follow him remember firstfruits means if
[3:25:07] one man comes in the resurrection
[3:25:08] they're going to be others who come in
[3:25:10] the resurrection is that right
[3:25:12] and if we saw brother Branham being that
[3:25:16] son that came to maturity with the
[3:25:19] resurrection quickening power in his
[3:25:21] life and Ministry guess what that says
[3:25:24] to us
[3:25:25] it says there will be many more
[3:25:32] many more Sons will come
[3:25:35] Hallelujah
[3:25:37] and you're part of that
[3:25:40] I'll have to show you Tuesday Sunday
[3:25:42] sometime
[3:25:45] now notice God is fixing to make another
[3:25:47] creation he creating mortal Earth mortal
[3:25:49] life Angels sing in heaven but here he's
[3:25:52] creating a new life
[3:25:55] eternal life for man and he's singing to
[3:25:58] his subjects listen at this
[3:26:01] he's singing to his subjects
[3:26:06] through angels
[3:26:12] glory to God in the highest
[3:26:14] peace on Earth Good Will toward me
[3:26:17] brother Brandon said that was God
[3:26:20] singing to his subjects through angels
[3:26:25] on the earth not in heaven heaven had
[3:26:29] eternal life
[3:26:32] and see he sang they sang to the heavens
[3:26:36] when the Mortal creation come in and
[3:26:38] hear the immortal The Immortal creation
[3:26:41] is coming in and now they're singing to
[3:26:43] Earthly people
[3:26:45] the first time to Shepherds
[3:26:48] striking isn't it verse 98 look at that
[3:26:51] he had started a new creation
[3:26:56] what was it a creation of himself
[3:27:00] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[3:27:03] who who
[3:27:05] could think
[3:27:07] such a thing
[3:27:11] behold I will do a new thing in the
[3:27:14] Earth
[3:27:16] something that has never been done
[3:27:18] before here it is
[3:27:19] he started a new creation what was it a
[3:27:22] creation of himself God was made flesh
[3:27:24] and dwelled Among Us that's the Bible
[3:27:25] said in the beginning of the creation of
[3:27:27] God God was created in human form in
[3:27:29] Jesus Christ his son
[3:27:33] God dwelt
[3:27:36] he built his Tabernacle
[3:27:38] of Flesh and Bones and lived in that
[3:27:41] Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he
[3:27:44] built himself a house to live in it so
[3:27:47] he could reflect his word to his
[3:27:49] subjects through that you know what God
[3:27:53] is when you see Christ how many of you
[3:27:57] believe that you know what God is when
[3:28:00] you see Christ Christ is the mystery of
[3:28:04] God revealed and the bride is the
[3:28:08] mystery of Christ revealed we're pushing
[3:28:11] toward that let's stand my I thought I
[3:28:15] would get farther

[3:38:36] [Applause]
[3:38:44] the Bible says something
[3:38:48] that's very very powerful
[3:38:52] it's the reason why
[3:38:55] we remember
[3:38:59] the resurrection
[3:39:11] [Music]
[3:39:13] it's in First Corinthians chapter 15.
[3:39:25] we've got so much to be thankful for
[3:39:35] it says in verse 20
[3:39:39] excuse me it says in verse 14.
[3:39:43] and if Christ
[3:39:45] be not risen
[3:39:49] then is our preaching vein
[3:39:53] and your faith
[3:39:55] is also vain
[3:39:59] all the Miracles he did
[3:40:01] all the good words he said even the
[3:40:05] shedding of his perfect blood was not
[3:40:09] enough
[3:40:12] [Music]
[3:40:14] he would have been as another
[3:40:16] good man
[3:40:19] Remembered in death
[3:40:22] we would have no reason to Hope
[3:40:25] we would have no reason to have faith if
[3:40:28] if they would have got to that tomb and
[3:40:31] found him still there
[3:40:34] yea and we are found false Witnesses of
[3:40:37] God
[3:40:38] because we have testified of God that he
[3:40:41] raised up Christ whom he raised not up
[3:40:44] if so be that the dead rise not for if
[3:40:46] the dead rise not then it's not Christ
[3:40:49] raised
[3:40:50] and if Christ be not raised your faith
[3:40:54] is vain and listen to this
[3:40:56] ye are yet in your sins
[3:40:59] so just purchasing and redeeming it by
[3:41:02] the blood was not enough he had to keep
[3:41:04] all of his promise
[3:41:07] your faith would still be in vain you
[3:41:09] would still be in your sin then they
[3:41:11] also which are fallen asleep in Christ
[3:41:13] are perished
[3:41:15] if in this life only we have hope in
[3:41:18] Christ we are of all men most miserable
[3:41:20] but look at this
[3:41:22] [Music]
[3:41:24] but now is Christ risen from the dead
[3:41:28] and not only that become the first
[3:41:32] fruits of them that slipped
[3:41:36] did you know that's why we can walk to
[3:41:38] the grave of our loved ones and Say
[3:41:42] Goodbye
[3:41:44] because we know that if Christ had power
[3:41:46] to raise himself up from the dead he has
[3:41:50] given us every one hope
[3:41:53] he will also raise our loved ones up and
[3:41:56] raise us up in the resurrection
[3:42:00] if you should get an opportunity to see
[3:42:02] his only son
[3:42:05] is that the title
[3:42:07] you should see it
[3:42:13] I was impressed
[3:42:15] with the few minutes before the movie
[3:42:19] when this young man comes out and gives
[3:42:22] his testimony of why he made the movie I
[3:42:25] was in I was as impressed with that as I
[3:42:29] was the movie
[3:42:30] and I like others there are things I
[3:42:33] would have changed and things I would
[3:42:35] have tweaked and things I had a hard
[3:42:37] time looking over
[3:42:39] I would have made that that scene where
[3:42:43] he sees the cross and the resurrection
[3:42:45] the empty tomb I would have made that a
[3:42:48] lot more of a to do
[3:42:50] it passed by so quick that you could
[3:42:52] hardly catch what was happening I didn't
[3:42:54] have no rewind button
[3:42:56] but if you get a chance to see it and
[3:42:59] support that man young man's Vision I
[3:43:01] want to support that young man's vision
[3:43:05] he said he's going to do
[3:43:08] Jacob
[3:43:11] and somebody got to him with some
[3:43:13] revelation
[3:43:15] because when that Ram is caught there
[3:43:17] and that Thicket and he goes into that
[3:43:19] flash of lightning and he sees the cross
[3:43:21] and he sees the empty tomb that's what I
[3:43:24] believe that's what I preached to you
[3:43:26] last Saturday night so you can imagine a
[3:43:28] preacher sitting there seeing his sermon
[3:43:31] being acted out I could look over some
[3:43:33] of the some of the acting and some of
[3:43:35] the other things
[3:43:36] and I could Rejoice that somebody caught
[3:43:39] us the inspiration of something so
[3:43:42] powerful Abraham was willing to give his
[3:43:44] only son he didn't have to but somebody
[3:43:47] had to
[3:43:48] aren't you glad he did
[3:43:51] aren't you glad the only son was given
[3:43:54] on your behalf and aren't you glad he
[3:43:56] didn't stay in the grave
[3:43:58] I want you to sing with me alive you can
[3:44:01] help us to be and I didn't mean to cut
[3:44:03] you out but I want us to sing that
[3:44:05] little chorus and clap our hands before
[3:44:07] we go home alive alive
[3:44:10] forevermore my Jesus is Alive I know
[3:44:13] that's old for some of you younger Crews

[3:46:10] [Music]
[3:46:17] [Applause]
[3:46:18] let's have brother Hulk come and stand
[3:46:20] among the brothers here
[3:46:22] and let's lay hands on him
[3:46:25] and uh
[3:46:28] there is a
[3:46:30] there I won't share this out because
[3:46:34] it's a sort of a private thing
[3:46:36] but there is a connection
[3:46:39] in in this that interests me greatly
[3:46:44] and I have watched God connect things
[3:46:48] and
[3:46:50] use one thing it's like dominoes I guess
[3:46:54] I should say
[3:46:55] the Domino Falls it knocks and and it
[3:46:58] just sets something in motion
[3:47:00] for the benefit of the kingdom of God
[3:47:03] and I wish sometime we could interpret
[3:47:06] it and understand all of these
[3:47:09] connections
[3:47:11] but we cannot always do that
[3:47:14] and but there is something about this
[3:47:17] little trip
[3:47:18] to Mexico for brother Hawk to assist and
[3:47:22] and be a blessing
[3:47:24] to this brother that that
[3:47:27] feels connective to me
[3:47:30] and I'm asking the Lord to cover them
[3:47:33] and of course protect them but to anoint
[3:47:36] them
[3:47:37] and I can't imagine that Hawk will not
[3:47:39] have an opportunity I believe he will
[3:47:42] for sure have an opportunity to share
[3:47:46] his test is it young people it's a young
[3:47:48] people
[3:47:50] it's both
[3:47:56] so it it is a time of of convention and
[3:48:00] we're just asking the Lord
[3:48:04] to anoint
[3:48:06] the ministry there
[3:48:08] and and particularly our brother Hulk
[3:48:12] if you feel that you would like to have
[3:48:15] a part of the fruit
[3:48:16] that comes out of it then you can give
[3:48:19] brother Hawk a Pentecostal handshake
[3:48:22] and with some money in it
[3:48:25] and uh if you need it to go through the
[3:48:27] church you'll have to make it out to the
[3:48:29] church and Mark on it for Hawk but if
[3:48:32] it's just cash and and you don't need
[3:48:35] particular credit for it you can hand it
[3:48:37] right to him I trust him I know that his
[3:48:41] expenses are going to be covered while
[3:48:43] he's there but the ticket was a little
[3:48:45] pricey
[3:48:46] and uh I would like that it not strained
[3:48:49] their finances in any way and I've
[3:48:52] already put a seed toward it and and
[3:48:54] maybe you want to do that and if you do
[3:48:56] feel free I'm not a jealous person I
[3:49:02] want that work and that convention to be
[3:49:05] blessed and I want our brother to know
[3:49:07] we're 100 behind him amen would brother
[3:49:10] Greely would you lay hands on our
[3:49:12] brother and with the rest of you
[3:49:14] Brothers just form a Presbytery around
[3:49:17] him and and you sister stretch your
[3:49:20] hands toward him and maybe you sisters
[3:49:24] near Maribeth uh or any of the kids
[3:49:27] would you lay your hands on them because
[3:49:30] I know there must be concern in her
[3:49:33] heart and let's pray the comfort of the
[3:49:36] Lord over them and the peace of God in
[3:49:39] their home father in the name of Jesus
[3:49:42] Christ
[3:49:43] we commission our brother now
[3:49:46] to go out from this place in the name of
[3:49:51] the Lord Jesus Christ to Bear witness of
[3:49:55] his testimony of what you have done in
[3:50:00] his life
[3:50:01] Lord may his hunger be contagious
[3:50:06] may his passion be catchable Lord may
[3:50:11] they Marvel as they hear of his wisdom
[3:50:16] the wisdom that you have given him
[3:50:20] the truth that you have revealed to him
[3:50:24] may he go forth he represents us as a
[3:50:29] family but he goes forth representing
[3:50:32] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[3:50:36] the continuation of apostolic Ministry
[3:50:39] so Lord anoint him
[3:50:41] [Music]
[3:50:44] from the top of his head to the souls of
[3:50:47] his feet
[3:50:48] direct him and lead him and give him
[3:50:52] wisdom from on high
[3:50:54] protect his body
[3:50:57] in the name of Jesus and keep him from
[3:50:59] harm and from sickness we pray over the
[3:51:04] the pastor from Iceland who will be
[3:51:06] ministering there Lord Jesus use the
[3:51:10] gift that you have given to him let him
[3:51:14] be a blessing to those people there that
[3:51:16] he loves dearly watch over the group
[3:51:19] that comes and travels and gathers to be
[3:51:22] there let your anointing be there
[3:51:25] guard the mouths of the leaders and let
[3:51:28] there be nothing but truth spoken in
[3:51:31] that place
[3:51:32] in the name of Jesus
[3:51:37] Lord confirm our brother's testimony
[3:51:42] confirm it with signs and wonders and
[3:51:46] miracles even as you promised you would
[3:51:50] Lord if he would lay hands on the sick
[3:51:53] may they recover May there be
[3:51:57] confirmations of the life
[3:52:00] your life that he carries and we will
[3:52:05] give you glory and honor and praise for
[3:52:09] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:52:12] Christ we pray hallelujah amen amen now
[3:52:16] greet him and greet Sister Mary Beth and
[3:52:19] let's believe the Lord let's believe the
[3:52:21] Lord to be with him now maybe you have a
[3:52:24] need
[3:52:25] and if you have a need the resurrected
[3:52:28] Lord is here
[3:52:29] you don't need my hands you need his
[3:52:33] touch is that right so let's agree right
[3:52:36] now for just a moment you can go back to
[3:52:38] your greeting in a moment let's agree
[3:52:40] right now father there are needs in this
[3:52:43] house
[3:52:45] their burdens that people carry
[3:52:48] but but it almost seems inappropriate
[3:52:51] to to go into every bit of that as we
[3:52:55] have remembered the resurrected Christ
[3:52:57] he lives in US
[3:53:00] and because you live in us we claim our
[3:53:04] healing we claim our deliverance we
[3:53:08] claim our encouragement we claim your
[3:53:12] leadership in our lives

[3:53:39] needs your absolute truth
[3:53:43] to break out in his life

[4:03:01] just play that
[4:03:07] keep playing that
[4:03:09] I want to just tell you
[4:03:13] you're always going to be opposed
[4:03:19] laughs first
[4:03:22] hell
[4:03:24] Satan demons
[4:03:26] they hate the call of God on your life
[4:03:31] because you're born a spiritual person
[4:03:35] you're always going to battle
[4:03:38] nerves
[4:03:43] it's going to feel like from time to
[4:03:44] time hopefully
[4:03:47] a few few and far between
[4:03:50] we will feel at times that you're losing
[4:03:52] your mind
[4:03:56] maybe you could
[4:03:57] you could afford to do a little of that
[4:04:00] because sometimes our mind
[4:04:04] in God's way
[4:04:06] I feel like I'm standing in a vision
[4:04:11] because I feel like I've seen this
[4:04:13] moment
[4:04:15] and I believe that it is the perfect
[4:04:17] will of God
[4:04:20] that you're here right now in this
[4:04:22] moment so I have to believe that God's
[4:04:25] going to do for you what you need him to
[4:04:28] do
[4:04:29] second of all
[4:04:31] you're going to be opposed because you
[4:04:34] know more
[4:04:35] and you believe more
[4:04:37] than the average person
[4:04:40] you can't come as close to truth
[4:04:45] truth and to fit in
[4:04:47] and it's a hard hard
[4:04:51] lesson to learn
[4:04:54] one that
[4:04:56] if we could spare you from we would have
[4:04:59] already done that it's not a bad thing
[4:05:03] a God thing
[4:05:05] you are called to preach his word the
[4:05:10] fullness of his word
[4:05:13] the fullness of his word
[4:05:15] and and man is not interested
[4:05:18] the fullness of his word they have to
[4:05:20] have the seed of God in them or they're
[4:05:23] not interested in the fullness of the
[4:05:25] word of God so they're going to oppose
[4:05:29] and they're going to puppet you
[4:05:32] they always will
[4:05:33] they did me when I was your age and
[4:05:36] younger
[4:05:37] they will try to hold the strains
[4:05:40] and as long as your mouth moves
[4:05:43] and they want it to move and says what
[4:05:45] they want you to say all is well
[4:05:49] but you just break out with a little
[4:05:50] something that's not status quo behave a
[4:05:54] little differently than the average
[4:05:55] Pentecostal
[4:05:57] and that spirit
[4:06:00] the ones who love you will oppose you
[4:06:03] the most the ones who stand on Sunday
[4:06:06] afternoon and tell you what a blessing
[4:06:08] you are and how much your sermon has
[4:06:11] meant to them and so thankful that God
[4:06:14] sent you to them their very the varying
[4:06:17] ones
[4:06:18] are the very ones same ones that in one
[4:06:22] moment's time will be from your best
[4:06:24] friend to your worst enemy this is just
[4:06:28] how religion works
[4:06:31] but I believe that God has met you
[4:06:35] today your your part of our family
[4:06:38] extended
[4:06:40] I respect your office as a pastor of a
[4:06:44] another church and I don't know how in
[4:06:46] the world you got here
[4:06:48] because I thought you were having
[4:06:49] service at your church today which is
[4:06:52] many miles from here so I don't even
[4:06:54] know how you got here but I believe with
[4:06:57] all my heart that we have been here
[4:06:59] before and that we are standing in a
[4:07:02] vision and I can tell you right now that
[4:07:05] if you'll lean on the Lord you will not
[4:07:09] have a breakdown
[4:07:11] you will not lose your mind you will not
[4:07:14] explode even though that's exactly how
[4:07:16] it feels
[4:07:17] if you will with everything that is
[4:07:20] within you
[4:07:22] cry out
[4:07:25] not just now but in these coming days
[4:07:28] for the for the very perfect leadership
[4:07:32] of the Holy Spirit I believe give it to
[4:07:35] you we break every assignment of the
[4:07:39] enemy I can't you wouldn't want me to or
[4:07:44] any of us to but we can't pray off of
[4:07:46] you what God may be doing for you but we
[4:07:50] will cancel every assignment of the
[4:07:54] enemy against your body
[4:07:57] against your mind
[4:07:59] against your emotions
[4:08:02] in the name of Jesus
[4:08:06] Lord give him Grace
[4:08:10] my brother my friend

[4:08:54] Aya
[4:09:01] [Music]
[4:09:02] I I wanted to I Really desire to
[4:09:08] pray that you know mouths will shut and
[4:09:12] that people will behave themselves
[4:09:17] I have a feeling that that'd be praying
[4:09:21] against God
[4:09:23] because
[4:09:24] right or wrong God uses people
[4:09:28] whether they're doing it right or
[4:09:30] whether they're doing it wrong God uses
[4:09:32] people
[4:09:35] Lord if today
[4:09:38] my dear brother could come to the end of
[4:09:40] himself
[4:09:46] I could spare him 25 years
[4:09:54] [Music]
[4:09:55] Lord in the name of Jesus
[4:10:02] I just call an end to religion
[4:10:08] that this is a relationship
[4:10:12] and my brother knows that he's had that
[4:10:15] he's walked in that
[4:10:18] and will never be satisfied
[4:10:21] never be at home
[4:10:23] in religion
[4:10:25] only in relationships
[4:10:28] Lord wrap him up I will pray that you
[4:10:31] would wrap him up in your arms today
[4:10:36] now I feel a little mad
[4:10:38] that's the way it works
[4:10:41] I feel a little mad at people

[4:12:11] can support you and pray for you in

[4:12:29] your testimony I believe in the call of
[4:12:31] God
[4:12:32] but and I believe the devil would kill
[4:12:34] you I believe he'd run you absolutely
[4:12:36] crazy
[4:12:37] I don't think you have to be prophetic
[4:12:39] know that because of the gift because of
[4:12:41] the call but he will not be successful
[4:12:44] but you can hear the Lord Lord may he
[4:12:47] hear you
[4:12:49] may he hear you it's hard sometime it's
[4:12:51] hard when you get in this fix
[4:12:54] thank you
[4:12:55] I've been hunting sometime I've had to
[4:12:57] hunt for people
[4:12:59] that Mike could hear for me
[4:13:02] because when I get so nervous and I get
[4:13:04] in such a fix like this it seems like
[4:13:07] you get silent Lord
[4:13:12] I've had to seek out at times and find
[4:13:15] somebody who could talk to me
[4:13:18] Lord I pray right now as I anoint his
[4:13:21] ears in the name of Jesus that not his
[4:13:24] condition or any of his troubles would
[4:13:27] keep him from hearing your voice in all
[4:13:31] [Music]
[4:13:34] Let Jesus Define you
[4:13:38] you're not a failure
[4:13:41] not at all
[4:13:43] in anything you've ever done for the
[4:13:44] Lord you're not a failure
[4:13:47] you're a man born out of season and
[4:13:50] you're ruined by the truth
[4:13:54] you're ruined by the truth
[4:14:03] I remember this is off the subject but
[4:14:05] it reminded me of a of a voicemail that
[4:14:09] was left on my
[4:14:10] voice machine in in 97 when our church
[4:14:14] split
[4:14:16] a woman screaming at the top of her
[4:14:19] lungs and she said we are ruined
[4:14:22] by the truth
[4:14:25] we're ruined by the truth
[4:14:27] there is nowhere else there's nowhere
[4:14:31] where we could walk in truth and yet we
[4:14:33] can't walk with you you have ruined us
[4:14:36] by the truth
[4:14:38] that phrase come in my mind for and for
[4:14:41] our brother because he's marked for
[4:14:44] higher things
[4:14:46] Lord have mercy I wouldn't
[4:14:51] I I I don't regret anywhere I've been
[4:14:56] as I was doing that little podcast my
[4:14:59] mind went back and I I could see myself
[4:15:01] at Shoney's
[4:15:02] I had preached for Gary Cockney in in in
[4:15:05] the valley
[4:15:07] his nephew pastors Upper Room Church
[4:15:09] there now in the valley
[4:15:11] did you know any of them
[4:15:13] I had been preaching for Gary And
[4:15:15] Laverne Cockney
[4:15:16] they were living in my grandmother's
[4:15:19] home when Priscilla was born
[4:15:21] and I had come home with some young
[4:15:23] people from Calvary Temple and I stopped
[4:15:26] in Shoney's and there was two couples
[4:15:28] sitting there brother and sister Hagler
[4:15:30] brother and sister Turner and they said
[4:15:32] brother Steve you're the person we want
[4:15:34] to see our church you're the very person
[4:15:37] we want to see our church is in a mess
[4:15:39] will you come and help us and I did and
[4:15:42] it was a hard three years we got sued
[4:15:48] the pastor the former pastor
[4:15:52] sued us
[4:15:54] his son owns the float in in downtown
[4:15:57] there where they have that therapeutic
[4:15:59] float sued us
[4:16:02] they I I drove to Montgomery and and
[4:16:05] took a a subpoena subpoena
[4:16:09] to our district superintendent because
[4:16:11] the church was Assembly of God I took a
[4:16:13] a subpoena and and they talked so down
[4:16:17] to me of course I was a kid they talked
[4:16:20] so down to me and and intimidated me so
[4:16:23] until I tore the subpoena up and threw
[4:16:26] it in the trash because they they
[4:16:28] convinced me that they were too
[4:16:30] spiritual
[4:16:32] and too high in the in the denomination
[4:16:34] to have to come and help us out in
[4:16:37] Phoenix City I went to court with those
[4:16:40] church people 17 years old
[4:16:42] scared
[4:16:44] I was terrified
[4:16:46] and God used me in that court and used
[4:16:50] that situation to turn that around and
[4:16:52] and the church did not have to pay him
[4:16:54] all the money he was suing the church
[4:16:56] for and I spent three years there and it
[4:16:58] wasn't easy because I had deacons that
[4:17:01] wanted to fight about how long is long
[4:17:03] and how short is short and I wanted
[4:17:06] brother Luke to come and preach for me
[4:17:07] and from the congregational Holiness and
[4:17:10] and they were he was what an Assembly of
[4:17:12] God and he didn't have license and it
[4:17:15] was just a mess
[4:17:17] and everything I wanted to do for God
[4:17:19] somebody opposed me
[4:17:22] but I'm sitting there thinking the other
[4:17:24] day talking to John I wouldn't change
[4:17:26] that
[4:17:28] I wasn't a failure I resigned I left
[4:17:30] when my time was over
[4:17:32] I wasn't a failure I did everything God
[4:17:35] wanted me to do while I was there and I
[4:17:37] just put another notch on my belt and
[4:17:39] moved on to the next place
[4:17:41] because God will use you in places and
[4:17:44] in Seasons like he like you had to place
[4:17:47] here he was working for the Lord he uses
[4:17:50] Us in seasons and places and times and
[4:17:52] and we don't have to feel like we fail
[4:17:54] because we run into problems because
[4:17:56] that's it I run into problems here we
[4:17:59] had a church split
[4:18:01] couple
[4:18:03] and you just do and I don't I don't even
[4:18:06] know I mean I'm just just talking
[4:18:07] because you're a pastor but anyway
[4:18:10] don't ever feel like that it wasn't
[4:18:14] worth it or there wasn't a reason in it
[4:18:16] everything that happens in the life of a
[4:18:18] Marked Man is a lesson
[4:18:20] I'm sorry I've been
