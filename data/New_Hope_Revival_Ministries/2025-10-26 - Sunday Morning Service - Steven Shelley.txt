You go to the innermost part of who we are and you see that life that is there that you put there. God, there's a pulsation that is crying out, you are an awesome God. You are an awesome God. Lord, when we use the vocabulary that we have, that word awesome just does not seem enough for who you are. But Lord, our hearts and our hands lift anyhow.

Oh, I'm so thankful that he knows me. &gt;&gt; He knows me better than any human being knows me. &gt;&gt; He knows what I'm made of. And he knows how to do everything that I need &gt;&gt; to make it all the way through this journey that he's called me to. Do you have a need today? As you walk this journey, you would just like to lift your hand and say, "I have a need." Brother Shaw sent me a need earlier. He needs a touch in his body. Let's ask the Lord to do that for him. Brother Joe and Sister Rona writers will be leaving this afternoon, flying back to South Africa. We want to remember them as they travel. A lot of brother Shel's family just got back in last night.

You got most of the ones I had wrote down, but would you remember brother Liam to the Lord? He has a need and he needs the Lord's guidance and leadership and I like what the Lord has done in his life and I'd like to see the Lord carry him to another level. Sister Anna Christine reached out to say that brother Austin and Isaiah both have a stomach virus of some kind and she's at home taking care of them. Uh we were told over the weekend that someone went to their doctor and was was told that there were 20 million people in the United States with the nora virus which is uh the main symptoms are stomach related. So um we want to pray for those who are sick. Some some were had tickets bought coming to the funeral and were not able to come because of the way it affected them. And uh pray for those who are fighting it. But would you also pray that we can walk in in uh great resistance of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh if God would just let us have a little all of us, I'm claim I'm saying I'm not just saying me and mine.

Many of you that we don't even know don't know that you're watching this service. But I'm so glad our papa knows who you are and he knows how to meet your need. Will you sing this course with us as we're getting ready to pray today? Touching Jesus is all that really matterers. And then your life will never be the same.

And then your life will never be the same. name. There is only one way to touch him. or just believe when you [Music] &gt;&gt; heavenly father &gt;&gt; it's it's always just an honor and a privilege to come into your presence to feel you to have a witness in the inner man that you are there, that you are around us and that our lives is are in your hands. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's more real than others. &gt;&gt; And this morning it just felt personal &gt;&gt; that you were willing to lay down your life so I could live. And it's your desire for all of us to redeem everything that we are, our spirit, our mind, will and emotion and our bodies. Father, I just want to thank you for this journey that you have us on. You become so personal. You show us who you are. You have shown us that you are faithful. You are everything that we need. And Lord, we're just looking right now to you &gt;&gt; for our answers, for healing for our bodies, for leadership of your spirit, and that the will of God will be accomplished in all of our lives. for all the names that were mentioned before you. I pray for those that need healing in their bodies that you would touch them right now in the name of Yeshua. Those that need protection, Lord, like Pastor Brother Shelley was saying, go grace that we be be protected as we travel, &gt;&gt; as we're fighting sickness and prevent that anything would touch our bodies. We are looking to you right now, oh God. &gt;&gt; Father, we just we come right now when we just we commit our lives, everything that we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; We are mindful that you know everything about us. You know our tomorrow. And Lord, may we just be willing to to to present everything to you and allow you to come and have your way. Help us, Lord, to get that grace to surrender to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Music] &gt;&gt; And may we see by revelation the finished work &gt;&gt; that you have done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May we practice. Give us the grace to pre to practice to speak truth &gt;&gt; and to speak life over ourselves and over every situation. Put a watch over our mouth. And Lord, I've been praying and praying. Give me discernment of spirit. Give me discernment what is going on in my life and what is going on around me.

[Applause] Thank you, Lord. [Music] Oh, praise the name of Jesus. You may have your seats today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's good to see you in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; This young lady with Rachel, God bless you. We're glad that you're here. May the Lord bless you while you're here today. this young man with Tiffany today. May the Lord bless you while you're here today. God bless you. We're glad to see brother and sister Steel again today with us. So glad that you chose to be here instead of watching us. [Applause] They're driving over an hour to come and be in the house of the Lord because streaming's not enough. &gt;&gt; We're grateful to you all that you would do that. Glad that you could be here. We're glad to be gathered in the presence of the Lord. So thankful for the grace that God shows to us daytoday. You walk through the stores and you see people choosing death. The culture of death. Friday is reformation day. People have chosen death over reformation. They choose death every day. And our heart breaks because of what we see when we're out in public. and people uh uh displaying death in their yards. I don't understand that they pull death close to them. But I'm glad to have life through Jesus Christ our Lord. I'm thankful that he has given us something on the inside that uh you know the Old Testament talks about choosing death or choosing life. Moses says, "Choose life." &gt;&gt; The Lord through Moses choose life. And I'm glad there's something on the inside today that we can choose life. &gt;&gt; And it's not just natural life that we're choosing. We're choosing eternal life. We chosen to call on the name of the Lord that he would wash away all of our sin, all of our transgressions, and that he would let us walk this journey with him and and let him roll away all of the iniquity of the generations prior to us. that he would give us the grace to let that roll off of us that we don't pass it to the next generation and the next generation because we see what has happened by a generation that don't stand on the word of God or they they decide to mix it with their own thoughts and theology and the next generation and the next generation falls further and further away from truth. And and we're not saying that to puff up what we are or who we are. We're just saying, Lord, I thank you that that you have given us grace &gt;&gt; through all of the muddle of life that you would let us see truth. &gt;&gt; What is truth? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I &gt;&gt; am the way &gt;&gt; and the truth and the life." And I want to see Jesus in his fullness. I want to see it in the earth. I want to see it in you. I want to see it in me. &gt;&gt; Walking in the fullness of who he is. &gt;&gt; That's why we gather here. That's why we listen to the preaching of the word. Because we are letting all of the untruth &gt;&gt; be cut away from us &gt;&gt; by the divine surgeon. He's cutting it all away. He that has ears to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church. &gt;&gt; We're glad to be gathered in that kind of an atmosphere. Brother Cade is going to lead us a little more in worship in preparation for the hearing of the word. We call on Brother Austin and Brother Ellias today. Let these two brothers come to you for the tithe and the offering. We bless you in the name of the Lord as you give. All of those that give online, you send it by way of mail. However you give it, we bless you in the name of the Lord and thankful that he is the one that blesses us and gives us our substance. Let's worship together as our hearts are turning toward the hearing of the word today. [Music] Some just see down on their knees talking to the air. Words lost on a breeze. Some just see tear drops falling to the floor. Just a waste of time. Not anything more. But it's a direct line to the throne room where you can find someone who cares. And if you need some proof, I can tell you [Music] there is power, power in prayer. [Music] I can tell you about the time the Lord gave me peace. With trouble all around, he calmed the storm in me.

What about? What about? What about? I wouldn't spend much time in the valley of what about. &gt;&gt; I would make up my mind to be ready. &gt;&gt; His coming is imminent &gt;&gt; and we know it. And anything that has to happen. Are there a few things? Yes, there are a few things that need to happen before he comes for his bride. But those things could happen in such a quick order &gt;&gt; quick such a rapid secession &gt;&gt; until we could be out of here come morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're You're not really looking for Yes, I am. &gt;&gt; I've had just about all of this life, this old ugly world that we can take and I'm ready to go. I heard brother Gley what he was saying about the celebration of darkness. Something seriously wrong. Something is seriously wrong with people who celebrate &gt;&gt; uh darkness and death and witchcraft and uh demonology and all of the different things and skulls and crossbones and tombstones in their yard and uh &gt;&gt; well it's just absolute Listen, Christian people don't behave that way. &gt;&gt; Aren't you being judgmental? I'm doing exactly what the scripture tells us to. The scripture says that a righteous man judgeth all things with a righteous and spiritual judgment. And that's what we're doing. The scriptures clear. If you have anything to do with those things under the law, you could be put to death. &gt;&gt; We're just glad for grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know people even in our own movement who um are are making uh you know strides back toward celebration of Halloween and and and stupid things like that. And and it just proves that that we don't really believe what we say we believe &gt;&gt; or we would be celebrating life. They used to say dumb things like, "Well, brother Brandham never spoke about I don't care. I I could care less whether he ever spoke about it or not. It doesn't take a brain a a brain scientist or a rocket scientist to understand that it's evil. &gt;&gt; And uh one of the reasons why that was not an emphasis for him is he talked about a time when they turned uh outouses over and soaked people's windows. And and this was what Halloween seemed to look like. uh generations ago, &gt;&gt; but the reality is it's always been dark. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that children of the darkness, they like it when it's dark. &gt;&gt; Because their deeds are evil. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said that the children of light, they like to hang out in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I don't uh there's no fellowship with darkness. &gt;&gt; I don't even like to roam around in the dark. I'm not afraid of the dark, &gt;&gt; but I don't see any reason for people just to ride up and down the roads at night just for the sake of riding up and down the roads. Do you &gt;&gt; go home? &gt;&gt; You men go home to your wives. Go home to your children and don't be rors &gt;&gt; unless God sending you on assignment. We're uh I heard someone uh or saw a little reel, I think it was, uh where they were were talking about uh having no other gods before me and and someone spoke and said, "Well, what about what about uh two hours on your phone and can't even pray 10 minutes?" &gt;&gt; What What would you say about that? I would say that you've got another God. &gt;&gt; Oh boy, it's quiet. I'd say you have another God. &gt;&gt; If you spend two hours washing your car, but won't spend an hour reading your Bible, &gt;&gt; I'd say you have another God. &gt;&gt; You go to church sick, but won't I mean go to work sick, but won't come to church when you feel better. &gt;&gt; I'd say you have another God. &gt;&gt; You're being kind of Well, I'm just just how I feel. I just think that it's time to quit playing church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's time to be real. &gt;&gt; God's looking for realness, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's thank the Lord for this. I'm telling you, this is a band. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. The way most churches have any kind of music like that is they have to hire musicians. That's right. and they hire them off the street &gt;&gt; and uh they don't know anything about their lives so many times. God is good to us. He's provided us with anointed musicians &gt;&gt; who volunteer their gifts to the Lord and we believe that God blesses them abundantly for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers for us. We we can't um speak of our own suffering because we didn't uh drive. We didn't ride in the van and we we think about the long drive of driving all night, leaving here Tuesday night after church. We all said goodbye to them and then beat them there by flying out very early the next morning. And we thank brother R.J. for getting up very early. He's up early anyway, but not usually at my house. So, uh, we appreciate him taking us to the airport. Hawk left a family gathering last night to come and bring us home from the airport. And we appreciate that. We appreciate the presence of the Lord that was with us while we were there. And and I had a little a little thing happen that sort of made me feel homesick this morning in the in in the song. And that's the reason why I asked him to sing it. Uh many years ago, I met in the '9s, early 90s, I met Brother Bobby Wartz. Uh, and I met his mom and dad, brother uh, brother Donovan and sister Naen. And uh, for those of you who know brother Caleb Don from uh, Tucson, he named his daughter Naen after Sister Naen Wartz. These were very precious people who loved the Lord. And her nickname, Sister Naen's nickname was Sweetie. And Sister Green loved her so much. They were they were dearest of friends. And Sister Green told us the last time we were with her, she said, "I am so lonesome for sweetie. I miss her so much." And you know, that was the last time we saw Sister Green. So, she she's now with her gathered on the other side. And uh as we got to the to the to the place where the funeral was to be, um an hour and a half before the service was to begin, a little before that, there was already a line of people because they had decided at the last moment to open the casket and there was a visitation announced that was just going to be passing through the family line, but they decided to open the casket, which takes much longer because people are talking and looking and whatever people do. And had it not been for brother Daniel, we might our family might not have even gotten in to see or to visit because the line was so long. And we had just gone through the line when it was cut off and all those people standing in line were not able to go through and even uh visit the family because of time. And uh when we when we rounded the corner, brother Daniel helped us to get in. We we stood by a cousin. It's it's good to know cousins, you know, there's a lot of cousins. So we stood behind the cartrides and um uh when because of that we we made a little curve to go into the gymnasium and there was a lady standing there. I think maybe she might have been sitting when we first saw her. And for a split second, I thought, "This is it. This is it." Because it looked exactly like Sister Naen Wartz, Bobby's mother. If you don't know what we're talking about, we have this we have this thought, this revelation that uh and it's been delivered to us in a vindicated way that it will be in the next resurrection as it was in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said many of the saints which slept arose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem. And what else did it say? And appeared to many. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up. That's the gospel. And so you you you catch a glimpse of somebody that reminds you of somebody that's already gone by the way of the grave and you wonder, is this it? &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And of course, Brother Tim Amalong has just had a a terrible fall, some of you know that, off of an airplane and uh uh and really hurt himself bad. He's he's still wearing a neck brace for safety. and and when he saw Sister Jackie uh which happens to be Sister Naen's baby sister uh and I think she's already 90 plus. When he saw her, he said to me later, he said, "Brother Steve, I I thought all of a sudden, oh my goodness, I guess my my the blast to my head, the bump to my head was worse than I thought." because he said, "I thought Sister Naen had already died." And there she stood. So his wasn't quite as spiritual as mine. He blamed it on his headbang. But I thought for a moment, this is it. This is the resurrection. And you know, I'm disappointed when I realized not yet. &gt;&gt; Not yet. We're that close. &gt;&gt; You certainly should be ready. Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; You certainly should be ready. &gt;&gt; So, thank you for your prayers for us. God was gracious and he was good to us. He gave us lots of time and favor with the family and we appreciate that so much. And uh they asked me several times to thank you for your prayers for them. I really do appreciate that. We're looking forward to ministry this week. We'll be uh ministering on Thursday night in Cookamo, Indiana for brother Dwey Moss and and then on Sunday for our for former Amish brothers and sisters and we're looking forward to that. And brother Gry has already told us that it's Stephen and Lydia's wedding and this is his last Sunday as a as a single man. And I don't know if that's anything to celebrate or not, but I'm sure he's a thought of it. I'm sure it's crossed his mind that next Sunday he'll be a married man and he gets one chance. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; And so he has certainly considered it prayerfully and we should. It's a big decision, &gt;&gt; a lifelong decision. &gt;&gt; So pray for us. We are leaving Tuesday morning and will not be home until the Wednesday of the following week. And we have committed along the way and we've actually turned down a couple of invitations already for ministry on the way home or a week trip would become two weeks in a short amount of time. Uh pray for for all the preparation that will be going on there that God's grace will be upon every detail and pray for the service here. Uh because there'll be quite a few missing and I don't know how to tell you as a pastor how that feels. Uh but it doesn't make me feel good at all to know that I'm leaving. And of course, brother Gley is more than capable of of filling the pullpit, but I I just feel for the people that uh are unable to be to go and and and are here and then the music will be slightly different and so forth. So, just know that our hearts will be home and we'll be thinking about you and we'll be believing that God will do something so grand and so special uh that you'll you'll have such a double blessing that you won't even know that anybody's missing. &gt;&gt; Somebody say that's impossible. It is not. &gt;&gt; You get in the fullness of the presence of God and you don't care who's there. &gt;&gt; None of it matters. Amen. Let's stand for the reading of God's word. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. For we are his workmanship. I read this to you Tuesday evening before we left. Created &gt;&gt; in what? &gt;&gt; In Christ Jesus unto good works. You were created for good works. Amen. &gt;&gt; You were created to behave yourself. &gt;&gt; As you are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. What? The good works of Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not just good deeds, but in the good works of Christ Jesus, his particular and specific works. Now turn if you uh have your Bible to Mark chapter 16. We've also recently read this, but I want to read it again beginning in verse 15. And uh uh he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel." Are you reading it? Are you are you looking at it &gt;&gt; to every &gt;&gt; to every creature? He that believeth and isapt &gt;&gt; shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Baptism is important. &gt;&gt; It is not salvation. It is surrendered obedience, &gt;&gt; but it is important. But he that believeth not &gt;&gt; shall be damned. I don't care how good he is to anybody. &gt;&gt; He's just a good old boy. Well, if he's not born again, he's going to hell. &gt;&gt; I don't care if he washed your car, if he brought you fried chicken when you were hungry. That's lovely. That's precious. Jesus said, "You do that unto little ones. The least of you do it unto me." All of this is true. But there is no scripture from Genesis to Revelation that would indicate to us that there's any other way towards salvation than repentance. and baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; So your mama might have been a saint of the Lord, but that doesn't make you anything, &gt;&gt; but blessed &gt;&gt; to have a good mama. You must also be born again of the spirit and of the water. &gt;&gt; He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs &gt;&gt; shall &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have to belabor the word shall. You know that it is not uh an option. It's not something that's offered to us. If we're interested, shall mean shall. It will it will be done in my name. Shall they cast out devils? These signs shall follow them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not preachers, not apostles, not prophets. These signs shall follow them. What? that &gt;&gt; that believe &gt;&gt; in my name &gt;&gt; in my name shall they cast out &gt;&gt; devils. So if there are any devils in here this morning, beware. &gt;&gt; There's authority in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They shall speak. They shall. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not optional. &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; Amen. That doesn't just necessarily mean heavenly languages. It can. It also means that we we talk differently. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't talk like we did when we were in sin. &gt;&gt; Our language is clean like our hearts are clean. &gt;&gt; They shall take up serpents. &gt;&gt; And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick &gt;&gt; and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've been handling serpents for 50 years of ministry. &gt;&gt; Not the kind in a box &gt;&gt; or the kind under a log, &gt;&gt; the kind that walk on two feet. &gt;&gt; The apostle said, "I I fought those beasts at Ephesus." &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about lions and tigers. &gt;&gt; Come on. Right? &gt;&gt; He was talking about dark-hearted men and women. &gt;&gt; They shall take up serpents. If they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they &gt;&gt; shall &gt;&gt; shall recover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one more reading in verse 19. Just just two more verses here. So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God. Power and authority. The right hand of God. And they went forth &gt;&gt; and preached &gt;&gt; everywhere. &gt;&gt; The Lord &gt;&gt; the Lord working with them &gt;&gt; and doing what? &gt;&gt; Confirming the word. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; How was the word confirmed? &gt;&gt; With signs following. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together for a moment. Father, we thank you today that you are Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever. You've changed not. Your word is sure. Your power is real. &gt;&gt; Your authority is the highest that there has ever been. You're more than able today to do above what we could even imagine in our minds. You haven't changed. Your power hasn't diminished. Your ability is the same. And we have come today, Lord, that you might speak to us from your word. And so by that authority, we command every spirit to bow to the authority of Jesus Christ in this house. And we'll give you all the praise, Lord. It's not for man to take any praise. It all belongs to you. And in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, this is how we ask these things. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. The handwriting on the wall is a little message that uh brother Brandham preached from many years ago and I think I shared it with you. I want to share it with you again just for that little moment of review as we go forward. And uh paragraph 22 says, "But God's church is not organized under any denominational head." &gt;&gt; It's organized. It is organized &gt;&gt; but not under denominational head or the creeds and dogmas of men. &gt;&gt; It's under the headship of almighty God &gt;&gt; and filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's his church. &gt;&gt; Well, there are lots of churches out there that don't belong to him, but he has a church. &gt;&gt; And his church is a universal church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A &gt;&gt; and it's not by the by the sign or the name over the door. It's not about that. It's about what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; And it's about whether or not the whole word is preached. &gt;&gt; If the whole word is preached, then then you can know that it's his church organized under his headship. But if there are those scriptures that they shy away from and those biblical truths that they deny, then you'll know that that's not his church. &gt;&gt; Because man has created a mixture. &gt;&gt; It's really a monster. &gt;&gt; It's not just a mixture. It's a monster. &gt;&gt; Anything having more than one head &gt;&gt; is not normal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Anything having more than one head would be considered a monster. And that's many times what we have ended up with in these closing hours of time. A church with more than one head. &gt;&gt; You've got a local head. You've got a board that's the head. You've got a a sectional denominational committee that's ahead. You've got state prespits and state overseers. That's another level of headship. Then you've got a United Council, a a national United Council. that uh that's another head. And then you've got the international uh committee, all the different leaders from the different nations. That's another head. So, what you've got is a monster &gt;&gt; somewhere between eight and 15 heads. But Jesus said, "You'll know my church &gt;&gt; because it only has one headship. &gt;&gt; You can't join my church." He's telling us you've got to be born into this church. Amen. So, it's not a building. &gt;&gt; It's an ecclesia. &gt;&gt; It's a body. It's a family of believers. &gt;&gt; And it has nothing to do with the building. It has nothing to do with a letter. I'm going to move my letter. I'm going to put my name on the roll. I'm going to take my name off of the roll. It has nothing to do with that. It's a living, breathing, moving organism. And its theme has to be Jesus Christ taking preeminence above all things, above all leadership. It's got to be him. The spotlight is on him, &gt;&gt; what he does, who he is, &gt;&gt; what he wants us to do. &gt;&gt; He's the one that we've come for today. We didn't come to see. We didn't come to be seen. &gt;&gt; We came to glorify the name of the Lord. And just to be honest with you, whether you do or not, I'm going to praise him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise him. &gt;&gt; I I can't help myself. &gt;&gt; I'm not out of control, but I can't help myself. &gt;&gt; When I get where he is, and that's every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I get where I'm aware of where he is in me, it makes me want to praise him. &gt;&gt; Makes me want to give him glory and honor. This church, the church of the living God, filled with the Holy Spirit, it is not organized. It is in the body. It's not organized. It's baptized into the body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, to say there's no organization in that church would be wrong because the Bible clearly gives us some structure for the conducting of the Lord's business, &gt;&gt; but it's biblical structure, &gt;&gt; not preser structure. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; And we're thankful for it. Let's go on. He said in that body made up, it's Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian and all together. And here's the kicker. That's come into Christ. So you can be Baptist and not come into Christ. You can be Methodist, Presbyterian, and not come into Christ. But but if you want to wear any of those labels and come into Christ, &gt;&gt; then Brother Brandham said that's a part of the real church. &gt;&gt; But that's not all. &gt;&gt; That's not all. &gt;&gt; It's not just wanting to be a part making you a part. He said that's right. And these signs Help me just a bit. &gt;&gt; These signs shall do what? &gt;&gt; Follow. We We don't follow signs. &gt;&gt; No. No. He taught us better than that. He said, "Remember, every sign sent of God has a voice. &gt;&gt; It's not the sign you follow. It's the voice you follow. Until you discover the voice of the sign, you've missed the purpose of the sign. The sign talks. If the sun turns to blood or dark, the sun turns dark and the moon turns to blood. Grand, great, biblically prophesied. But that's not enough. We've got to know what it means. What is it saying to us? What is the voice behind the sign? If God sends a prophet with a sign of Moses in his hand and then the ability to read the hearts of the people, we we're not just going to rejoice over the sign. We want to know what the voice was and what the voice said and what was the message behind the sign. &gt;&gt; God still gives signs today. &gt;&gt; He hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; He's still a supernatural God with a supernatural people. And if he does something among us, &gt;&gt; guess what? There's a voice behind it. &gt;&gt; If we see God doing something out there, we know it's him. It's a God-given sign. Then there's a voice behind it. &gt;&gt; And we need to discover what that voice is saying. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's saying, but I can tell you what it's not saying. It's not saying anything contrary to the Bible. If it's saying something contrary to the Bible, it's a false sign &gt;&gt; with a false voice. &gt;&gt; Are you following that? &gt;&gt; I believe you are. And then in Luke 10:19, same verses. I'm I'm getting through with the with the review here. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over &gt;&gt; all the power of the enemy, and nothing. You better say &gt;&gt; nothing &gt;&gt; and nothing shall by any means hurt you. &gt;&gt; And the amplified verse says, "Behold, I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions and physical and mental strength and ability over all the power that the enemy possesses. And nothing shall in any way &gt;&gt; harm you." That's the power given to the believer, &gt;&gt; not to the pastor. &gt;&gt; That's good. Get on here now. &gt;&gt; Not to the pastor only. &gt;&gt; Come on. Or &gt;&gt; or or or an evangelist only. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or an apostle or prophet or teacher only. But to the believer, &gt;&gt; how many believers are here? &gt;&gt; Let me see. Are you really a believer? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you're really a believer, these signs shall follow them that believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is no cessationist &gt;&gt; in this at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So those who believe that God once healed but he heals no more. &gt;&gt; They're not believers. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a little critical. I'm sorry. It's a little bit truth. &gt;&gt; It's just truth. If you believe God did heal, but he can't heal anymore, you're not following this book. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is what? Hebrews 13:8. &gt;&gt; The same. Yes. &gt;&gt; The same. &gt;&gt; What about the times he does it? Listen, here's the point. He can &gt;&gt; I I I like what they said. I like what the Hebrew children said. We We don't know, oh king, whether our God's going to deliver us out of this furnace or not. But we need you to know &gt;&gt; that we are thoroughly convinced he's able to. &gt;&gt; We We don't know. It may be his will to take us. We We don't know how it's going to be when the doctor shakes his head and says, &gt;&gt; "Here's the point. You ought to tell the doctor." And many do. I don't know whether God's going to deliver me out of this or not. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what I do know. He's a healer. &gt;&gt; And if he never healed me again, he has already. &gt;&gt; And if he has already, he can again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's kind of simple, isn't it? But people get a little carried away with their deep theologies &gt;&gt; and they can't even, you know, uh, cast a tick off of a dog's back. &gt;&gt; No authority over the devil. They can't even hardly take care of their pets. I'll show you in just a moment where brother Brandham said uh, concerning these things, he said rapture power for rapture, &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. He said, 'Wh we can't even have faith for our own healing. &gt;&gt; How are we going to have faith for a body change? &gt;&gt; So, one of the ways that God gets us ready for that great change is he allows us to exercise the authority that is given to the believing church &gt;&gt; to take all authority over every demon power. &gt;&gt; Can't get in your house unless you open the door. If you open the door, you better find out what you've done to open the door. You better shut the door. You better seal it in with the blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a recliner you have to get rid of. I don't care what it is. Whatever you find that the enemy has attached itself to, somebody said, "I don't believe it works that way." I'm sorry, &gt;&gt; but you can bring divi defiled and oursed things into your home and not even completely be aware of it. That's good. &gt;&gt; Things that come. Listen, as a uh going to 60 plus countries, 65, 64, 65 countries to preach. I've had all kinds of souvenirs given to me. And most of them have remained with me. But some of them went to the to the burn pile. Some of them went to the bonfire. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because And then I heard the Lord say when I was in Chennai, India, I heard the Lord say, "Don't bring anything home." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't don't take any gift that's given to you home. Leave everything behind. Somebody said, "Why would that be?" Because somehow in some fa false and fake kind of religion, but demons are real. &gt;&gt; The religion may be false, but demons are real. &gt;&gt; And if someone has some kind of understanding or authority to attach some demonic power to some object, somebody said, "I don't know if that's in the Bible or not." It actually is. &gt;&gt; The whole reason why God is against idolatry is the spirits. He's not afraid of wood or stone or or so forth. You could use that for decoration. But when spirits are attached to it, if it's been dedicated to something other than the worship of one true living God, you bring that in and you may find out that you've opened the door. You've got to then go close the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you've got to get rid of the thing that has gained access into your life. It could be your job. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God forbid it be your companion. &gt;&gt; That's why it's another reason it's good to know you've got the right one in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Oh my. They're just running the aisles today. But it's the truth. Little tough. It's a little tough. I get it. &gt;&gt; But it's but it's right. Queen of Sheba paragraph 44 he said I know that's thus saith the Lord the gospel the same gospel that blinded the Jews &gt;&gt; we read about this in Romans &gt;&gt; the same gospel and not just Romans Ephesians the same gospel that blinded the Jews is now doing what? &gt;&gt; Blinding the Gentiles. blinding the Gentiles. First, the Jews are blinded so that the Gentiles have an opportunity to be a called out people for his name. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and so this, you know, hating Jews is so wrong. And being a prejudice against someone because they're Jewish is is so wrong. Somebody said they crucified the Lord. You better read the book again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, it was the Romans that you better read it again. It was the will of his father that crucified him. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There weren't enough Jews in the planet or Romans on the planet or devils on the planet to take the life of the son of God. He said, "No man taketh my life. I lay it down." &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this, that he would lay down his life for his friends. &gt;&gt; Satan didn't kill him either. &gt;&gt; His father did. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For this cause, &gt;&gt; for this cause came I into the world. Hallelujah. I'm so glad he did. &gt;&gt; How many of you are so glad he did? &gt;&gt; And so then this blinder starts lifting off after the preaching of the epistles, the letters written by these apostles. We start reading how that that God blinded them on purpose and and uh we've heard by the message of the hour that there there would be a time that uh this great grace extended to the Gentiles. He said one day the last one &gt;&gt; will come in. &gt;&gt; Are you still here? &gt;&gt; One day the last one will come in and and when it does and he said you know I don't know the number but he said God knows the number. believe that &gt;&gt; he knows the number. &gt;&gt; I don't know the number. Two billion, three billion, 100 billion. We have no idea how many, but God does. &gt;&gt; And he didn't do it by number. He just numbered those that were his. But he didn't just guess a number and and then say, "I'm going to bring that many in." No, he knew in his fornowledge who would receive him. And when that last one, a part of that gentile uh crowd when they come in, he said then the mercies of God would return to the Jews. &gt;&gt; And where are we now? We're in that that dark kind of a gray place. He once called it a lapover when he was referring to the church ages. So we're in kind of a lapover period now &gt;&gt; where there are some who are under uh a heritage of Judaism raised and uh their ancestry is there. There are a few of them brother Brandham called them renegades. I'm glad there's a few of them who have seen that the Lord is right that Jesus Christ Yeshua Hamashiach that he is the Messiah and have accepted him. And there are Gentiles still accepting him &gt;&gt; but many are blinded &gt;&gt; just like the Jews. Many are blinded. He said because it is the same gospel for there is no other gospel but the gospel which is good news right &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He said we have many creeds. You always hear about the Nyian Creed, &gt;&gt; but but really really that that's not the biggest one. Read them all. Go through them and you will find they just got progressively worse as the early church, you know, got further and further away from Mark 16 and closer and closer to the Roman beast system. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And then they just got more ridiculous as they went along. And now the word of the pope is equal to the word of God. Kind of like gentile randommites, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Where we try to take any man's word and make it equal to the word of God, we're walking on very dangerous ground. &gt;&gt; Its origin is not in truth. Its origin is in falsity. And we don't want to walk in anything that resembles that. We're thankful. So thankful for what God has done in our day. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said, "We're coming back to the final absolute." &gt;&gt; He said, "We're coming back to the final absolute." And he said, "That's the Bible." &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; So they're blinded. They just get blinded. Creeds. There's one gospel. What's the gospel? it. The gospel came not in word only preaching and teaching but through &gt;&gt; power through power &gt;&gt; power dunamis and exusia power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dynamite and the empowerment for service. Both words translated power in the New Testament. One coming from dunamis, which is an explosive power, and one coming from a power that equips and thrusts us forward into doing the work of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you've ever had God get on your case &gt;&gt; and kick you out of your comfort zone, &gt;&gt; if you've ever felt his boot in the middle of your back, then you know what empowering power is about. &gt;&gt; He knows how to shove you. when you need a shove. &gt;&gt; If you resent that, there's something wrong with you. &gt;&gt; I We ought to embrace it. Thank God we've got a papa &gt;&gt; who loves us enough &gt;&gt; to correct us &gt;&gt; who loves us enough to throw us out in the deep end sometime. &gt;&gt; He don't turn his back to let us drown. &gt;&gt; He watches over us carefully like the mother eagle who throws the elets out. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You that are sleeping, sleep later. &gt;&gt; This isn't your nap time. This is God's word time. &gt;&gt; I don't mind you sleeping when you're at his at your house. &gt;&gt; But not in here. &gt;&gt; You can even come to my house and sleep. I don't mind a bit. My fellowship is boring. You can just sleep right on the couch, slobber right over the pillow if you want to, but not here. That's not why we're here. We have many creeds, but there's one gospel. What is the gospel? He tells us power, demonstration, manifestations of the Holy Spirit. God, God doing what? Making his word do what? &gt;&gt; Come to pass. &gt;&gt; This is the interpretation of every scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. when it comes to pass then we can know. He said it had to be that for in Mark 16 he said go into all the world preach the gospel uh these signs shall follow or otherwise go into all the world and demonstrate the power. I love this. What's Mark 16 all about? &gt;&gt; It's about demonstrating the power. &gt;&gt; It's about demonstrating the power &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. It's proving that he lives. &gt;&gt; How many of you know he lives? &gt;&gt; He lives. &gt;&gt; But there's a proof that he lives. &gt;&gt; It's the demonstration of his power in a people. &gt;&gt; Not theologians. &gt;&gt; People. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just people. &gt;&gt; Just men and women who want to please their creator and savior. &gt;&gt; And he speaks to them. lay hands on your brother. Lay hands on your sister. &gt;&gt; And they do. And God honors that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not not heroes. Certainly doesn't make them heroes in the world's eyes, &gt;&gt; but it makes them heroic in God's eyes. &gt;&gt; Come on. He goes on to say, or otherwise go into all the world and demonstrate the power of the resurrection. He's not dead, but he's alive. and listen and listen and listen. You ever heard the preacher say, "God don't need you." Well, he he don't. &gt;&gt; Because if I if you won't, &gt;&gt; somebody will. &gt;&gt; But he chose &gt;&gt; to call on you &gt;&gt; because he loved you. The economy of God is not going to crash because you lay out a church, &gt;&gt; won't serve him all the way. God's still going to have his business going forward. The kingdom is still being raised up, &gt;&gt; but God wants you to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason why it's so bad to step out of his perfect plan. It's not for for for God's work. It's not that God's work is going to go undone, &gt;&gt; but you're going to miss out &gt;&gt; on the reason of your birth. You were born to demonstrate the power of the resurrection &gt;&gt; to show the world around you he's not dead, he's alive. And he's depending, this is what's so profound, he's depending on you. &gt;&gt; So he needs those that he is depending on &gt;&gt; to let him work through us. &gt;&gt; Read this. Read the rest of this. To will his will. Somebody said, "That doesn't even make good sense." Yeah. Uh, then he's calling you a buzzard. &gt;&gt; He called me an eagle. &gt;&gt; It makes it perfect sense to me. &gt;&gt; It makes perfect sense to me to to do his will to will his will. &gt;&gt; Not my will, his will. How is it accomplished? By the Mark 16 company. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. They've been there have been Mark 16 companies, groups of men and women from the time of the of of the day of Pentecost, Shàuote all the way through. They've been on the earth uh through all the darkest ages through every one of the seven church ages. God has not left himself without a witness or without a Mark 16 company of people. But the prophesied, the prophesied, pre-planned, elected, predestinated Mark 16 company of fully adopted sons could not have come forth in Ephesus to the Ephesian church age or to Philadelphia in the Philadelphia church age. They could only be raised up, that manchild company could only be raised up in the last of the last days. &gt;&gt; As Leodysia, the the le the seventh church age is coming to a close &gt;&gt; and a bride is getting her marching orders. &gt;&gt; And once again, we find ourselves in a lapover age. The closing hours of le oysia around us and yet there's an invitation to a bride to become a wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're no longer just to be the espoused. &gt;&gt; We're to be the demonstrators. &gt;&gt; The provers of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's depending on us. &gt;&gt; In the message, Israel in the church number two, now we're going somewhere. Paragraph 136 said, "Throw it on the ground." Throw it on the ground. Turned to a serpent. He jumped back and said, "Pick him up by the tail." He did it. Turned it into a stick. Turned back a stick again. Said, "Now Moses, what's that in your hand?" And said, "Take your hand and put it in your bosom." Are you familiar with this? &gt;&gt; He did over his heart, pulled it out, and it was white with leprosy. See that means the conscious of man, the heart of man is white with leprosy. Leprosy being a type of sin. &gt;&gt; The very thoughts of his mind. Leprosy. Sin. A plague. It's a plague. He put it back in his bosom, pulled it out again. What had to be done? When it come back out, what happened? It was completely white. Clean. Clean. No leprosy was there. It was cleaned off. Just like a baby's hand. Just like the other hand. He had a complete restoration. Now look at this. He's seen you you know that English. I know there are you know English majors here but but you you can get this. &gt;&gt; He's seen God's glory. &gt;&gt; What is God's glory then? &gt;&gt; Miracles, signs, wonders, divine healing. Show me. &gt;&gt; Show me your glory, Lord. Now you and I learned that and we've understood by scripture this it's more than miracles, signs, wonders and divine healing. It's cavode. It's the heavy presence of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Woo that shows up sometimes and nearly paralyzes us in his presence. &gt;&gt; It's not just the demonstration. It's also uh becoming the habitation. We are becoming the habitation. This generation is transitioning from a visitation to a habitation &gt;&gt; where God not only visits our services but he comes to service in us. &gt;&gt; Because he occupies us. &gt;&gt; That's where we started with. &gt;&gt; That's what we started with. &gt;&gt; The verse is pretty clear. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10. For we are his workmanship, &gt;&gt; created in union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Created in union with Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; unto good works. This is the amplified. Created in union with Christ Jesus unto good works. Union. &gt;&gt; Made one. Made one. How many of you are thankful for that union? &gt;&gt; And of course they scream holy roller. Holy roller. and all the other things that they want to talk about and we don't care. It doesn't bother us. In fact, in the Patmas vision, he said, "Somebody say holy roller, holy roller." That don't bother him a bit. &gt;&gt; That don't bother them a bit. Paragraph 210. You're a religious fanatic. &gt;&gt; He said that they don't even hear that. &gt;&gt; Is somebody talking? Is the wind blowing? &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; They're mocking. They don't even hear. They're completely yielded. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh church, come on. &gt;&gt; This is the key. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; This is the key. &gt;&gt; This is This is the way in. &gt;&gt; It's simple. &gt;&gt; We complicate it. &gt;&gt; Listen, the only reason why you and I are not fully functioning in everything that God has called us to fully function in is is he puts us in and we take ourselves out and he puts us in and we take ourselves out. He qualifies us at camp meeting and by the next Sunday we've unqualified ourselves. &gt;&gt; He reminds us, "You're mine. I'm going to work through you. You've got it. I've given you victory and power and authority." And we get all excited. We're ready to take on the world. And by next Sunday, he's convinced us that nobody loves us and we ought to eat worms. &gt;&gt; So, we go from one moment as God's mighty men and women of power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and the next minute we need another pill &gt;&gt; because our nerves just can't simply handle it anymore. Come on. I'm not I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you that you're not working with him. You know why God's not working with you confirming his resurrection? Because you're not working with him. &gt;&gt; It's real simple. If I'm not working with him, he's not working with me. Well, how do I work with him? You believe what you say. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say what he said &gt;&gt; and you believe it when it comes out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; And and then you ask, "Well, what if I don't believe it the first time I say it?" You already know the answer to that. Brother Brandham gave us the answer to that. He said, "You just keep saying it until you believe it. I am healed. I am healed. I am healed. I am healed." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The barber's just mocking him, you know. Oh, yeah. You're healed. All right. You're tapping around like a blind man like you always were and there he's just tested I am healed. &gt;&gt; Well well the whole story is he went back through the prayer line. &gt;&gt; He went back through the prayer line to get another dose and brother said I've already prayed for you. You're healed. &gt;&gt; He's tapping along. He said you know the first dose was good but I'll come back for a second dose. and he's just as blind as ever. And brother Baron said, "I prayed for you. Go go go your way healed." And this is part of our problem, too. We we we everything don't change, you know, overnight. And every ache we think, "Oh, it feels a little better. By the next day, it's worse." Ah, just as I thought. &gt;&gt; Do you know that man would have died blind &gt;&gt; had he had the normal attitude that we have sometimes? But he just kept testifying. &gt;&gt; Instead of just selling headlines, here ye, here ye, read all about it. &gt;&gt; He started saying, "Read all about, hear ye, hear ye, I'm healed. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I'm healed." &gt;&gt; He's telling the church of Christ Barber, the one who believes that miracles are over. &gt;&gt; God doesn't move today. He did that for the early church because that was a hard time, but now everything is rosy and uh we don't need miracles and signs and wonders. So, it's all finished. and he's kind of mocking him and he tells him how it happened and all of a sudden guess what &gt;&gt; it manifests &gt;&gt; in the same manner. I know you've heard this a thousand times, 10,000 times but in the same manner he said the angel of the Lord was passing through that neighborhood &gt;&gt; bringing watching over the word that had been spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the next thing you know, neighbor meets neighbor in the street. &gt;&gt; Healed by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Instead of just eating the the crust of the toast, had now had the oatmeal and a cup of coffee, healed by the power of God. &gt;&gt; I don't know what happened. Gorder gone, swelling, the tumor, whatever was it, swallowed, gone, disappear, and they're meeting each other. Already prayed for meetings perhaps even come to an end. But those things were still laying. Those seed promises still laying there dormant. And it took the angel of the Lord passing by to bring activation to the promise of God. I wonder if there's anyone here today. Wonder if there's someone streaming this service that has the potential promise of God laying like a seed in the depth of your spiritual womb. And all you need is to get in his presence. &gt;&gt; Just get in the presence of the Lord and and lay there a while. &gt;&gt; Amen. I &gt;&gt; I notice you got all the time you need for disc golf. &gt;&gt; You've got all the time you need for fun things, things that you enjoy doing, but you just can't hardly wait to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I know your name, too. &gt;&gt; You can stop asking me for favors. I mean it. I'm tired of of of using so much of my energy in life. It's going to get quiet now &gt;&gt; for people who won't just won't take God at his word. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to do it. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to do it. Always needing a favor, always need something, always want something, &gt;&gt; but come in here not half caught, &gt;&gt; half ready to praise, &gt;&gt; half ready to amen in the word. Not just with your mouth, but with your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you leave here worse than you came. And brother Brandham said it ought never to be that way. We should never leave this place worse than when we how we came in. We should always leave a little better. Not because the preaching was amazing, but because we put ourselves in a position &gt;&gt; to receive the activation of every prom. Faith does the work. You take your faith and the presence of the Lord &gt;&gt; and you pull that together and anything that you're believing for is possible today. &gt;&gt; They're completely yielded. Now, if I were to take a poll here this morning before we go home in a little while and I'm going to miss three services. So, I've got I've got I'm still on sermon number one and and that's today's sermon and then I got Tuesday nights and Sunday morning and Tuesday. Oh, don't you think brother Gley handle that? Oh, yes. He'll handle that. He'll handle it amazingly. But but but he won't preach from my notes cuz I'm not giving them to him. &gt;&gt; He'll preach what the Lord lays on his heart. &gt;&gt; So, I feel like I've got a I I've got a truckload this morning. I want to unload and I'm trying to hurry, trying to trying not to get too ugly about it. I I want a people I want to be with a people. I want to be a people. I want to be a people &gt;&gt; that's completely yielded &gt;&gt; and drawing their life from his right arm of power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Reflecting his light &gt;&gt; in meekness and kindness and gentleness and patience. Signs and wonders and miracles. See? See, it's not just signs, wonders, and miracles. Mark says, "It's also meekness, kindness, gentleness, &gt;&gt; patience. &gt;&gt; You need more, Brother Shel. You sure do. I do. I sure do. I sure do. But don't forget what I have exercised. Pray for me that I can exercise more. He goes on, "Let the world call it witchcraft." Whatever they want to make us no difference because we know we're yielded and in his right hand. &gt;&gt; If I were to take a poll today, h how many I'm not, but if I were take a poll here, how many know you're yielded totally? What was the what was the description? Completely yielded and drawing their life from his right arm of power, reflecting his light in meekness, kindness, gentleness, patience, signs, and wonders and miracles. I wonder how many of us could throw up our hand and say, "I am." I wonder how many of us could grab a hold of this promise. Makes us no difference because we know we're yielded and in his right. Lord, I want to live in your right hand. &gt;&gt; Just let me live. Let me minister out of your right hand. Let me let me go to work uh tomorrow in the power of your right hand, &gt;&gt; yielded to you. Not my will, not my way, &gt;&gt; but your way. Now, again, we've been quoting this Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. We're talking about an abiding anointing. We're talking about a corporate anointing, uh, a divided anointing where the pillar of fire was once one once once one great light and on the day of Pentecost, it divided itself into cloven tongues of fire and appeared over each of their heads. And he told us that that was the great pillar of fire that brought Moses through the children of Israel through the wilderness. That was one full complete manifestation of God. And now that divided and we're talking about we've been talking about uh the building of a corporate messiah because in the ending in the ending we could say the ending of one thing the beginning of another when Christ purchased redemption for us through his own blood. It was one Messiah on the earth and now he has made available the ability for there to be a many membered body which is a many membered Messiah. Somebody said, 'Well, that gets a little strange when you say it that way.' I know. That's why I say it that way because I want you to understand the reality of what we're saying. &gt;&gt; And if you need quotes, there are a lot &gt;&gt; messiahes. That's right. &gt;&gt; There are lots. He talks about little G. Are you familiar? &gt;&gt; Little G. He talks about messiaetses, those that are a chip off the block &gt;&gt; of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; I want you to know that's available. It's possible. It's part of the full adoption process. And we need some messiahs in the house. &gt;&gt; And the world worse than that, bigger than that. The world needs some messiahs. &gt;&gt; Those who are not looking for any attention for themselves, but completely yielding. &gt;&gt; Amen. and want to dwell and live and minister from his right hand. Not just preachers. I want to say again, not just preach. You're not getting off the hook. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Look, look at your wife and say, "You're not getting off the hook. &gt;&gt; It's not male, female." &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's It's not preachers only. It's not deacon only. Believers. &gt;&gt; How many believers in here? &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that &gt;&gt; believe &gt;&gt; are called to the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; No, them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe. You better know you believe. &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're willing to live for it, &gt;&gt; you'll be willing to die for it. &gt;&gt; Then you'll know you believe. what we're going to be talking about uh at some point. What we're moving toward is uh something that can be a little little um oh I don't want to say it by any means complicated because it's not at all but it's just a little there are so many different thoughts and various interpretations and understandings of uh what it means to to to minister. I'm going to just try to say very carefully what it uh means to minister under a uh uh a scriptural commission. Uh and and we're talking about in typology. We're you know, brother Brandham calls himself that a typologist. Wow, what a big word. And he said, "You know, I believe that God moves in types and shadows and realities." And brother Brandham used the word antitype properly. Most people who use the word anti-ype think that it's another form of form of a type, but brother Brandham used it accurately. He was definitely not a theologian, but under inspiration, he used the word anti-ype properly. Anti-ype is at least at the very least a portion of the fulfillment of the type. Not just another type, but it is at least a portion of a fulfillment of what the shadow or the symbol was pointing to. One type can have more than one antitype &gt;&gt; as it moves through scripture. &gt;&gt; You you understand what we mean by that? For instance, the spirit of Elijah, the spirit that was on Elijah, how God used the spirit and power of Elijah in the ministry of Elijah is a powerful uh symbol of what was to come. But so was the ministry of Elisha who received what? A double portion of the spirit that was on Elijah. And then we see John the Baptist and he came with with the spirit and power of Elijah to introduce uh the the the first church age th those believers uh early believers to introduce them to the ministry of Jesus Christ. That's &gt;&gt; right. They had to see who Jesus was. So right there we have already three demonstrations of a type. So we can you can say it. Somebody say why in the word are you telling us this? Because you you might want to know it later. &gt;&gt; We can say that the ministry of Elijah was a type and we can say the ministry of Elisha was a type. But we can also say that the ministry of Elijah was a type and the ministry of Elisha was an antitype &gt;&gt; not the fullness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But a portion of the fulfillment, another demonstration of what God did through Elijah. You followed that, didn't you? &gt;&gt; And then we come to John the Baptist and we can say the same. And then we believe I boldly believe that uh a generation ago the same spirit and power of Elijah that was on Elijah then Elisha then John the Baptist was on William Brandom. &gt;&gt; And he came with the same kind of forerunning anointing to introduce a people to the second coming of Jesus Christ like John the Baptist introduce the people to the first coming of Jesus Christ. But that's not all. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we sometimes forget that. Was brother Brandham a type? He was. Was he an anti-ype? He was. But was he the final installment of the spirit of Elijah? He was not. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible talks about five comingings. &gt;&gt; Does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh that means that there's coming another with the spirit and power of Elijah to the Jews. &gt;&gt; One of the two witnesses. Is that right? And so we we apologize to the Assemblies of God who taught us for so many years that that it was Enoch and Elijah. And and if you don't mind, we'll just go to the Bible pattern and we'll look at the miracles and the and the and the demonstration of God in the lives of the two witnesses. And it'll be easy to determine who they are. Moses &gt;&gt; and Elijah. &gt;&gt; We see that by by observing their miracles and the demonstration of their ministry. So one day the spirit and power of Elijah that was in type and anti-ype all the way through the word will have its final installment and one of those witnesses will operate in the spirit and power that Elijah operated in in the beginning. So that just was a way for me to show you that um it's possible for instance let me say one more thing. We're kind of getting ready for something that we won't get to today, but that's the way we have to do. Um, we could say that Elijah was a type and uh Elisha was a anti-ype, but he also had a ministry that could also type something. &gt;&gt; You understand? because there's been a double portion promised to the last of the last day bride. So, we're not separating the ministry of Elijah and Elisha completely, but we're saying that it is possible that Elisha fulfilled a portion of what he was to fulfill as he ministered in the power and spirit of Elijah, but that he also pointed another type forward, pushed another type forward as a double portion minister. He ministered in a double portion of what Elisha And and uh the prophet to our day talks about the a bride who's functioning not only in in power and demonstration but in a but in an additional in additional measure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the book of acts talks about it in the days of the restitution of all things. &gt;&gt; And the word restoration is giving back everything that was there originally and perhaps lost. But restitution is restoration plus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody following me? &gt;&gt; Meaning that God's going to give back everything the devil stole. &gt;&gt; But there's a refreshing coming. And in that time of refreshing, there will not be only a restoration of all that has been lost. There'll be another portion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, give me some more types for that." I believe I will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, he's digging uh Papa is digging through the bag. That's good. &gt;&gt; And what does he find? He finds the grain. He finds the provision. And he finds the cup. Are you Are you there? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He found Benjamin's cup, didn't he? &gt;&gt; That was a That was a portion given back. That was not just So So the extra grain becomes the restitution and the and the cup was the restoration. and I'm giving you back what you what you used to pay. &gt;&gt; I don't want that. I want that to go back. Which is very prophetic. This whole this whole concept of Benjamin being the son of my right hand. Is that what he says? &gt;&gt; And then there being an added portion there at the end for for a Benjamin. So that that Benjamin in the Bible, he also prophesied. I mean his life, the typology of his life, the symbolism of his life prophesies toward the Elisha double portion anointing of both restoration and restitution. What does all that mean, brother? What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say that before we can even get a grasp of a restoration back to Mark 16, God's already saying to us in the same book, in the same message, in the same Bible, that we not only need to go back to to the same power and authority of Mark 16, but that we're actually supposed to operate in another portion of that, &gt;&gt; an additional outpouring of that. We call it from the third seal, a bride's revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he tells us there's revivals here, there's revivals there. The churches have burned out on revival, but the bride has never had a revival yet. &gt;&gt; Another type of not only restoration, but restitution. &gt;&gt; It's also a type I'm hurrying. It's also a type of the spirit that was on Moses being multiplied and falling on 70 more. &gt;&gt; It's also a type of the day of Pentecost when the same life that was in Christ Jesus now pours out on 120 &gt;&gt; who stumble out into the streets and make thousands. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is you see a lot of people are convinced that these things diminish &gt;&gt; because darkness increases. &gt;&gt; This is not what he tells us. If the if the world is getting darker and the church is getting looser, &gt;&gt; then the bride ought to be getting brighter and operating in more power and more authority to get out of here. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "What are the greater works?" Jesus said, "If I go to my greater works shall you do." &gt;&gt; What are the greater works? Well, all you have to do is look at the five demonstrations of the spoken word. Five demonstrations of the spoken word a generation ago. God giving power and authority over every one of those classifications of need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spirit of conviction falls by the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Resurrection life falls by the spoken word. Nature is controlled &gt;&gt; by the power &gt;&gt; of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Tumor disappears &gt;&gt; by the power of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; We're talking about something that is the ministry of Christ, but it's it's it's it's even that that greater works generation. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's even more than what we have hoped and expected for once we really start looking at it &gt;&gt; because there's a transition. Now, I said all of that to say this. This has been an argument for for as long as I've known the the truth. This has been an argument. Was brother Brandham a Moses type or was he a Joshua type? And the answer is that believers today like to emphasize that he was a Joshua type, but in reality he was a little of both. And somebody said, "Wait a minute. Where are you going?" Well, Elisha was a little bit Elijah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He had the spirit and power of Elijah on him, but he was also Elisha. He received a double portion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? So, brother Brandham is often typing himself and the ministry that God had given him and God typed it that way by the angel in the commission &gt;&gt; as Moses was given. You will also be given. So, the Lord typed him that way. &gt;&gt; And then he and I'll show you all this in another time. And then he also receives this commission where a hand comes down and points at Joshua chapter one, right? &gt;&gt; And tells him that there's a portion of that commission that's his. &gt;&gt; Somebody say that's huge. just as big. I don't even know how to follow all this. Well, stay awake for one thing. &gt;&gt; Rehear it if you don't get it the first time. For another thing, if you care, you can know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not as complicated as we make it when we're half caught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be fully aware, alert, fully aware, and it'll it'll it will begin to make a lot of sense to you. So now the modern believing church uh folks around the movement have have loved to emphasize oh so much the Joshua part of the commission because Joshua was the one who took people into the promised land &gt;&gt; and they love to tell us what it feels like living in the promised land and they're there because the Joshua prophet came and he led them in and they're there and it's milk and honey for breakfast and honey and milk for lunch. You know, it's just everything is amazing and the giants are all run out and the bride's heard it all and we know every installment of the seventh seal. We've already heard all seven thunders and we know what they're they are and we're just bathing in his glory and demonstration. Wouldn't that be wonderful? &gt;&gt; But the reality is there's type and antitype. The reality is he fulfilled and and operated in a portion of both of those commissions. But there is a portion of that Joshua commission that has not yet been completely antit &gt;&gt; or completely fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And he kept pointing to a bride. &gt;&gt; He kept pointing to a bride. He never pointed to another major prophet. He kept pointing to a many member demonstration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Aren't you worried about people here who may not, you know, visitors and so forth?" I I was in the beginning, but I reached a place where there was a faith pull. I would say it's probably coming from one or two and it was bigger than the concern. &gt;&gt; So, I just yielded to the to the faith pull of whoever that is who was pulling on that. And once you get to understand that that there's got to be a many membered people because it wasn't just Joshua that went into the promised land. &gt;&gt; He led them in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't just point the way. &gt;&gt; He led the men in. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what a leader is? &gt;&gt; They're walking ahead of you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And you're following the men. &gt;&gt; Here we go. And although we know that brother Brandon fulfilled a huge portion of what a Joshua commission would be, there has got to be some installment, &gt;&gt; some demonstration that would take us in as a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doing Mark 16. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fully surrendered. &gt;&gt; Operating in the functions and powers of the creative spoken word. You need a quote. Good. I've got 300 &gt;&gt; 300 more plus &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; telling us that there has to be a finishing of that commission. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, some of our friends believe that so strongly that they think the only way it could ever be fulfilled would be a one-man resurrection of a prophet coming back. It's easy to criticize, but what they're doing is holding on &gt;&gt; to many passages that they don't quite understand. And in their human reasoning, they're thinking the only way this could ever happen is if God sent brother Brandham back. &gt;&gt; Well, that's not how this works. &gt;&gt; God didn't raise God didn't send Elijah back. &gt;&gt; He took him off the scene &gt;&gt; because he was going to send a double portion of that spirit &gt;&gt; on Elisha. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A and in the same manner the corporal body of Jesus Christ didn't come back after it was ascending here when we were reading about it earlier &gt;&gt; but the same spirit that was in him &gt;&gt; it came back &gt;&gt; isn't that amazing &gt;&gt; fell on 120 we said a moment ago that quickly became thousands. So, it's not the physical return of a body, a man that we're looking for, but it's a fulfillment, a full installment, a completion of everything that we saw demonstrated in that life. &gt;&gt; You see, a wave sheath offering is that a wave sheath offering. Someone has to come to maturity first to encourage us that there will be a furtherance of the maturity in the harvest. &gt;&gt; And this time it won't be one stalk. It's the whole field. &gt;&gt; It's the whole field. &gt;&gt; Now that is what he said. The first fruits was the binding together of the first wheat or barley or whatever the grain was, &gt;&gt; binding it together and waving it over the field. &gt;&gt; And it was twofold. It was it was both praise and prophecy. &gt;&gt; It was praise. It was thanking God. God, thank you for the seed. Thank you for the dirt. Thank you for the rain &gt;&gt; that brought this barley &gt;&gt; to maturity. Amen. And that's what I heard preached when I came to this truth. But I didn't hear anybody, no one, not in that day, preaching the further reality of what first fruits is. It was a prophecy. I mean, you look in the scripture, it was a prophecy. And it was saying the same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No wonder it's his favorite scripture. Hebrews 13:8, same Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Same God. The same God that provided the dirt, that provided the seed, that provided the water, &gt;&gt; that grew the plant, that caused this grain to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Am I boring you? &gt;&gt; Good. You're going to be even more bored than that when you see us moving on to it. &gt;&gt; While you're sitting there trying to scratch your head and figure it out. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a dream after a while. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a prophecy after what going to be reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we used to could say maybe the next generation, maybe the next. But we're coming now &gt;&gt; to the reality that this whole world can't hold up. &gt;&gt; It can't hold up &gt;&gt; for more generations. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're coming to the last of it. &gt;&gt; And if there's ever going to be a people And you ought to love that. Not not fear it. You ought to say, "Well, praise God. Why not now? &gt;&gt; Why not me? &gt;&gt; Why not us? &gt;&gt; Let's get her done." And get out of here &gt;&gt; because there is a land. &gt;&gt; There is a land. [Applause] Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me let me just give you this one and we we need to close. But but this was the sort of a sort of an introductory comment because we need to see it. Just give me a moment. Let me stir your memory just a moment. He tell I'm paraphrasing now so you purists can look it up later and tell us exactly how it was said it. But he's talking about masonry and he's talking about the laying of the blocks. And he said any old mason can lay the line, the brick, the the the rock in a straight line. You understand that? Because what are you doing? You're just you're just button it up one end to the other. You're not having to worry about only thing you're then you put the next layer. You're just going to try to make sure the joints not in the same place. You put a joint over here so that it adds strength to the wall. And that's about all you're doing. You're just laying it in a straight line. Of course, it needs to be with a plum line and it needs to be straight because everything we do needs to be straight. There's been too much crookedness &gt;&gt; and slop &gt;&gt; and we need to take time to clean up our our mess when we make a mess in a job, all those good things. But he said it takes a skilled craftsman &gt;&gt; to turn the corner &gt;&gt; because you would think, well, you know, you just do the same thing. If you're going to turn the corner, well, then you just start laying it in a different direction. You know, you come right there like that. You're do you lay it there? Do you lay it there? You know, you So, that's about all you're But if you just did it like you'd been doing it, what you would have is a is a corner with no strength. &gt;&gt; And anybody could just come along, push that corner right out of the wall because you got to tie it in. Somebody say, "Tie it in." &gt;&gt; I'm not a Mason. I don't know how, but I know it's got to be tied in. You're not going to just butt it up against wall to- wall there and then expect that thing to hold. You got to tie it in just like you were just like you were staggering the on on the straight line. He said it takes a skilled craftsman, a master mason to be able to turn the corner. And and the reason for that is is we get our eyes so much on what we're doing. And that's why we always do what we've always done. And when we always do what we've always done, we'll always be what we've always been. &gt;&gt; But when we make up our mind, somebody's got to pray. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to run this thing through the word, through the quote, somebody's got to see what it will look like when the corner turns. Well, it's going to be a transition &gt;&gt; just like there was a transition between Moses and Joshua and there was a transition between Elijah and Elisha and there was a transition between John the Baptist and Jesus the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there was a transition between Pentecostals, &gt;&gt; the restoration of the gifts, and the ministry of the last day prophet. There was a transition. &gt;&gt; And and where people made a mistake is uh that each church age, they didn't they didn't uh you know uh undo or try to redo what was already done. They just kept building on. That's right. &gt;&gt; And and so here's what what we have heard brother Brandham say and some have misunderstood. He taught us, he said, you know, now the the message of another age will not work. &gt;&gt; But a lot of folks have misunderstood that to say, well then if it was preached under Pentecost is no good for today. That's not what he's preaching. &gt;&gt; He could not have been preaching that &gt;&gt; because if he were preaching that, he'd be denying &gt;&gt; justification, sanctification, and Holy Ghost baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. So because we have full word restored today, that doesn't mean we don't need to be justified. You got to be justified &gt;&gt; under Luther's &gt;&gt; sanctified under Wesley's message &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost under Pentecost, but you don't stay in justification. You don't hang out in sanctification. You don't live eternally in the restoration of the gifts. &gt;&gt; You keep moving on to the full restored word. &gt;&gt; Okay? But what he was saying was you you can't use the message of another age. I can't preach you forward into the fullness of the restoration of the word if my emphasis is Luther's justification. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't preach you forward in the full installment of the of the spoken word if my emphasis is only Wesley sanctification. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I can't preach you forward in the completion of the word if my emphasis is just on Pentecost and the restoration of the gift. Come on. &gt;&gt; And so they have taken that to mean we won't mention sanctification. We won't mention justification. And we're so far beyond the Holy Ghost. Beyond the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about beyond the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; He said you don't even have a new birth &gt;&gt; until you're filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said every man has to meet the pillar of fire. Every man has to have his own Holy Ghost experience. Every man has to taste of the original mana. Don't tell me you're beyond the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He's in your shoe leather if you're a believer. &gt;&gt; But I can't let that message be my only emphasis &gt;&gt; if we're turning the corner. &gt;&gt; So you'll hear him say, "You can't use yesterday's message for today." not meaning that the truth and and we understand this because he talks about Luther and the miracle of Luther, God using Luther the way he did and the ability, the grace that God gave Luther was not just in the delivering of his message, just shall live by faith, but that he was able to keep his head &gt;&gt; above the fanaticism &gt;&gt; that surrounded his age. Are you still with me? 10 minutes. 10 minutes. He was able to keep his head above the fanaticism. So, thank God for the Lutheran who some were able to keep their head above the fanaticism that followed the Lutheran message. And thank God for the Wesleyans who were able to keep their head above the fanaticism that followed the Wesleyan message. And thank God for the Pentecostals &gt;&gt; who were able to keep their head above the the fanaticism that followed the Pentecostal message. And God bless those who followed the last prophet. who were able to keep their head above the fanaticism that followed his message. Because we're foolish to think that that would happen in six church ages. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, the seventh church age, there wouldn't be fanaticism. &gt;&gt; There's more fanaticism that has followed this message than any message that has been delivered since the beginning of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because this is the finishing message. &gt;&gt; This is the finishing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is the author &gt;&gt; and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; And we're living in the finishing of our faith. &gt;&gt; We're living in the finishing and the completion of the word where there will be a people who will manifest what it means to be word born. &gt;&gt; Born of the word, not just born of the flesh. &gt;&gt; So, let me give you this. This is a little bit long uh uh place from pardon. And I'm going to read it and I'll just have to be done. Oh brother, our educational systems has drawn us away from it. And our denominations has separated us from one another &gt;&gt; and from Christ. &gt;&gt; They've not only built walls to separate us from them and them from us. But the walls have also served to separate us from Christ. That's why there had to be a restoring word. That's why there had to be a restoration prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; We had to go back to the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the Malachi 4 commission. It's not just one way. Fathers to children, children to fathers. You've got to understand there's two sides to this commission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. He said our and he said but uh and from Christ. But what they'll continue to do that and and you take a substitute any other thing any other thing it's no more &gt;&gt; than fig leaves again. &gt;&gt; Wow. He said God rejects it. God doesn't want your fig leaves. &gt;&gt; He found another way to cover your your nakedness. The full reveal word. But when the church comes under the blood of Jesus Christ with the token of the Holy Spirit upon them, &gt;&gt; then you're going to see brotherhood again. &gt;&gt; You're going to see a church &gt;&gt; full of power. &gt;&gt; He said you're going to &gt;&gt; God hates a powerless religion. &gt;&gt; He said it's got to be power. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Certainly, it's a power to save a man from sin. It's power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ promised." &gt;&gt; He said, "They zeroed in on the word of God back there." Hallelujah. And believed it. And what happened? They hit the target. Nathan hit the target. &gt;&gt; He said, "You zeroed the same way on the word of God. It'll hit the target again. &gt;&gt; It's got to because he's the same." Read it. Yesterday, what &gt;&gt; today? and forever. He said, "God don't like a powerless religion. God does not want that. God wants to perform." &gt;&gt; Wow, that just sounds terrible. Not not really. Not really. &gt;&gt; Not to me. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, you know, I just think of a show or a circus or something like that." Well, you're thinking wrong. &gt;&gt; God just wants to be God. &gt;&gt; He just wants to be God. He just wants the people that'll let him be God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, he still has all the attributes that he ever had in the beginning other than those that he's expressed on the earth. And we could argue that there is still representation of you in him right now in the same manner that there's rep representation of him in you. &gt;&gt; In fact, that is the case because you've already got another body. &gt;&gt; You're not waiting on another body. You had another body before you got here. Come on. &gt;&gt; And he says this mysterious statement out just all of a sudden. Have you heard from your theophony? &gt;&gt; Have you heard from it? I've heard from mine and it's calling me. Sister Sister Craig Head. She threw her leg out there and she wrote that song. One day I'm going to take a step right into my theophony. &gt;&gt; And it's a calling. Come up. &gt;&gt; Come up. Come up a little higher into agapeo love. Come up a little higher into the perfect word. Come on. God just wants to He wants to perform. He wants to show himself alive. Jesus wants to be Jesus in you. &gt;&gt; Our very hopes is the resurrection. Is that right? Our hopes of life is resurrection. The resurrection of Jesus Christ. I got to hurry. Uh maybe it's not quite musician time yet, but it's almost almost time. He said, u you see, God wants to work in his church. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'll be with you always, even to the end of the world. The works that I do, &gt;&gt; hello, read it, &gt;&gt; shall you do also." Praise God. Somebody ought to say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't say hallelujah because I'm not doing it." That's not what you're hallelujahing. You're halleluing the fact that he wants you to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you're a part of his economy, that you're a part of his plan. He didn't leave us out. &gt;&gt; He put us in. &gt;&gt; It's about the bride. &gt;&gt; It's about the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now the church tries to deny that, you know, the works that I do shall you do also, even more than this shall you do, for I go to my father." St. John 12:14. He said, "Now the church tries to deny that. Get a way to get some members in or to be more popular. You won't accuse us of trying to get people." Somebody say, "Why people leave and you don't even chase them?" I don't. I don't. You can't make somebody walk this. &gt;&gt; You can't sweet talk a man in. &gt;&gt; Nobody ever walks out of this group without me praying diligently. God, if it be your will, bring them home. If not, take them somewhere where they can get the finishing. &gt;&gt; You got to realize you you you can't help everybody, &gt;&gt; but there's somebody somewhere. If they're gods, there's somebody somewhere can help them, provide what they need to get them where they need to go. And it's not begging people back that gets them where they need to go. It &gt;&gt; it's it's desperation. &gt;&gt; And you can't make somebody desperate petting them on the back. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He said God wants to to work in his church. I'll be with you. All right, let's go on. the God is uh uh God is trying to perform in his church and the church is trying to perform by the creed &gt;&gt; and the two can't work together. You got to get rid of the creed. &gt;&gt; Oh, not just the not just the nian, &gt;&gt; even the Brandham group creed like you can't have a church without the pillar of fire picture behind you. You can't have a church, a true church without the without the cloud picture behind you. You can't have this. You can't have that. You need a belt buckle. You got to have a bolo. You got to walk bow-legged like brother Brandham did when he'd been on a hunting trip. You got to do this. You got to do that. You got to do the other. Listen, creed upon creed upon creed upon creed. And while we argue about creeds, we're missing the point. &gt;&gt; Jesus wants to be Jesus. in us. &gt;&gt; And he actually doesn't want us spending our time looking back. &gt;&gt; He wants us to spend our time looking forward &gt;&gt; because the corner is turning with or without you. &gt;&gt; With or without me. &gt;&gt; God's not just building a straight wall. &gt;&gt; He's building a house. &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to build a house with just one wall? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, sir. You've got it's got to be more than one &gt;&gt; to make you a house at least four unless you're making a lean to. You can't build a habitation for God with one wall brick laid all the same. It's the the corner has to turn. Two can't work together. You got to get rid of the creed and get in Christ. Get Christ in. And how can you do it? How can you do it when he sees the blood? When the blood has been applied with a sincere heart and a hand laid upon Jesus Christ, your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Put your hand on his head. &gt;&gt; That's your key. That's what keeps your mistakes under the blood. &gt;&gt; It doesn't keep your willful sin under the blood. You've got to repent of those. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; As long as you keep your hand on the head of your sacrifice, the Lord Jesus Christ, you're going to fall. You're going to fail. You get right back up again in grace. He calls you up to a higher place because these are bobbles and mistakes and and and and overreactions and emotional reactions and things. That's what he that's what he he covers without without even asking were covered. Just as long as your hands on his head. Amen. &gt;&gt; You take your hand off of his head and you and and you're walking on dangerous ground then. &gt;&gt; But you keep your hand on the head of your sacrifice and plead his perfection, not your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll be all right. Now, once you know the truth and you continue to do otherwise, that's willful sin. And it is not covered except by repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And repentance is not I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Repentance is I'm sorry and I turn. from my way, &gt;&gt; from my action, from my from my behavior, from what I'm doing. &gt;&gt; Okay, now you're thoroughly asleep. So, we'll come to &gt;&gt; the God trying to per you got to get rid of the creed. Yes, God wants to perform. Yes. Through the power of the blood to get Christians born again. That's exactly the difference of it. Amen. to do. Must you you must reject. To do this, you've got to reject the Holy Spirit and his performing power to accept a creed. &gt;&gt; You can't have creed and Holy Spirit moving through your church at the same time. &gt;&gt; It's phony performance. I've seen my belly full of it. I'm worshiping. It's disgusting. It's not just your song he's after. &gt;&gt; Not just your body language he's looking for. It's your heart. &gt;&gt; I I I just don't I just like real. I'd rather you be raw and real, unpolished and real, than to be a phony. Come on. God's looking for f. He He knows He knows that we're raw. He knows that we've been through junk. He knows that we hadn't always got it right. &gt;&gt; But he also knows whether or not we're sincere and real &gt;&gt; or whether we're putting on a show. That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows. &gt;&gt; He knows whether it comes from the sun or out of a bottle. &gt;&gt; He knows whether he give it to you or you bought it at the drugstore. &gt;&gt; He knows the difference between real and phony. &gt;&gt; And there's coming a mark. There's coming a day. Musicians are coming. This is a good time for you all to come and save the preacher. Said you have to walk over God's promise in order to get an error because there's a red light. He said to do you must reject. To do this you got to reject the Holy Spirit is performing power to accept a creed. You have to see the truth before you can accept an error. If you're going to be a Christian, you you have to walk over God's promise in order to get an error. Hallelujah. Because there's a red light flashing before you all the time. This is the word. You You didn't just stumble into error. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I smelt somebody else's smoke and wanted it. You didn't just stumble into it. &gt;&gt; You You had to ignore the flashing red light warning of God's word. &gt;&gt; You didn't just give your body away because somebody else around you was doing it. If you were God's, if you were God's, if you'd had an experience with him, and I'm not talking about before you've met him in a in a birth. I'm talking about after you've known him, there's going to be a flashing red light standing in your way saying, "Go back to the word. Go back to the word. Go back to the word. Go back to the word. Go back to the word." &gt;&gt; And I'd never be able to convince you that God was looking over your sin because you've seen the flashing red light of his word. You understood that, didn't you? &gt;&gt; He said, "So if Christ is the word, every promise is true." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every promise is true. And it's the same. yesterday, today, and forever. It has to be. It takes a born again faith &gt;&gt; to believe it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And make it operate. &gt;&gt; You You can't just do it with tradition. It didn't work. It won't work. You've got to come to that blood just as sure as anything. &gt;&gt; The interesting point is we're running out of time for this transition. I didn't get to it today, but there's there's some quotations that are powerful where he talks about the two phases of redemption. One part of redemption is bringing you out. If if if I've ever seen a message that brought people out, I can say that ministry fulfilled that part of that commission to bring us out. But he said himself that's only one part of redemption. He said the other part of redemption is to take us in. So he's the one that divided the commission. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. Joshua 1, chapter 1. Read it for yourself. 11 powerful verses in there where God is promising his his help, his strength and stability to Joshua. And you can do it and you can make it. And you can if you'll stay with the word that was brought, you you'll be able to go forward and and do. But if if redemption has two phases, one is the coming out and one is the going in, then we need to understand what part is behind us and if any is there any part ahead of us and I happen to believe there is. I happen to believe that we have not fully occupied the land of promise. &gt;&gt; I happen to believe that we're not fully walking in our inherited blessing yet. &gt;&gt; And I believe the the the holdup and the hangup is not on God. It's not on the message. I believe it's on you and I. &gt;&gt; He told us we've gone as far with God as we're ever going to go until we're willing to pay a greater price. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We don't need armchair prophets. We need people who get up and get the job done. We don't need people standing back telling us what we're not doing, not getting it right over here. We need people who will come get it right with us. You understand? Critics and scornful sitting in the seat of the scornful. That's not what we're looking for. But we're looking for somebody that'll help pray, help believe God, help let their amen count as we make that as we make that turning of the corner and we start understanding what it feels like to walk in the fullness of our inheritance &gt;&gt; where we recognize what's in our mouth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It it it's a multiplication. &gt;&gt; It's it's a corporate messiah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad to see it &gt;&gt; and I'm looking forward &gt;&gt; to be it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't pay my price. &gt;&gt; I can't pay yours. Somebody said, "I thought Christ paid it all." He did. He absolutely paid the price to redeem us all. It's a greater yes he's looking for now. It's a greater surrender he's looking for. Are you willing? &gt;&gt; Are you willing? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Two hours on your phone and less than 10 minutes in prayer. Are you willing? &gt;&gt; Amen. You're keeping up with all your series on Netflix. Are you willing? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you be willing and obedient, you'll eat the good of the land." Let's stand together. Let us go up at once to take the country, to possess the land from Jordan to the sea. Though the giants all be there, our way to hinder, our God will surely give the victory. Sing it with me. Let us go up at once to take the country to possess the land from Jordan to the sea. Though the giants all be there our way to hinder, our God will surely give the victory. [Applause] Oh, let us go up at once to take the country, to possess the land from Jordan to the sea. And though the giants all be there our way to hinder our God will surely give victory.

Oh our God will surely give the victory. He will &gt;&gt; He will trust him. He will. [Music] Upon a hill they called Gatha. &gt;&gt; There grew a rose among the weeds. A beauty unmbbraced.

Give him yours. Give him your Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 10,000 praises to you, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallel hal hal. 10,000 praises to the worthy lamb. Father, our hearts look forward to that day, to that moment. But until then, [Music] we need you to fill us &gt;&gt; with another installment of your resurrection life. &gt;&gt; Many of us desire a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We ask today, Lord, that you would help us to position our hearts. Oh, let the Lord do something. He's here. Doesn't matter where you're standing. You might be right at the back. You might be right at your seat. He's here to meet you. Just present your need to him. Here we are, Lord. No place we'd rather be in this moment than in your presence. Pour your oil on our faith, oh God, that we might lift it up higher. [Music] that these bodies would have to obey the confession of your word in our mouths. Line up with the creator's program. Line up with the creator's plan. May every organ, may every system, may every cell of these human bodies, may they be moved. You promised it right in your word. May they be moved by the inspiration of your word and anointed faith [Music] to bring wholeness. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just as a point of contact, would you just raise up an antenna? Let's raise up a hand to the Lord. Lord, you see the need under that hand. You see the need. It's important to you. It's important to you, Jesus. You see the need that's represented. Maybe it's huge. Maybe to us it's small. But Lord, you look at it all the same. Because it touches us, it touches you. We're asking for your help right now. [Music] Where direction is needed, Lord, give it. &gt;&gt; Where questions are, let there be answers. &gt;&gt; Where bondage is, let freedom come. &gt;&gt; Let deliverance come. &gt;&gt; May we not spend one more night on this side of the Jordan. May we cross in faith to possess that that you have seized for us. May we find the strength and grace to dispossess every enemy of the kingdom of God that stands between us and our inheritance. Every giant that stands between us and what you have provided for us. May May our courage be lifted. Hallelujah. May our concern and our care be be lifted, be elevated, [Music] may we take things more serious than ever before. As we position our li Oh yes. as we position our lives for the turning of the corners, [Music] for the taking of the inheritance, for Mark 16 in action in our own lives. We don't have any time to judge or criticize anybody else. We need it in our life. &gt;&gt; We worship you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing it. Hands lifted high.
