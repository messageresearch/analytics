[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:43] hand in hand in hand alone
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:22:09] with cheese
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:13] would you give the Lord another
[1:22:15] handcraft of praise
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:27] isn't he wonderful
[1:22:29] aren't you glad you're here on a
[1:22:31] Saturday night
[1:22:33] I mean honestly when I was a boy in the
[1:22:37] Holiness Church they used to say well
[1:22:39] wouldn't you rather be here than the
[1:22:41] finest Hospital
[1:22:42] well that's a that's a crazy question
[1:22:46] I don't believe there's anybody here
[1:22:48] would rather be in a hospital
[1:22:50] uh or what you know they say things like
[1:22:53] that I never did quite understand that
[1:22:55] but if they would ever say or is there
[1:22:59] anywhere else you'd rather be than where
[1:23:00] you are right now I I can relate to that
[1:23:03] there's nowhere I'd rather be than with
[1:23:05] you
[1:23:06] gather together with him
[1:23:09] on a Saturday night
[1:23:11] I'm old enough to remember when they
[1:23:13] called Saturday night the devil's night
[1:23:16] that's what the old-timers used to say
[1:23:18] because people would get into trouble
[1:23:20] how many of you believe it's Jesus is
[1:23:21] not tonight
[1:23:23] and tomorrow night and the next night
[1:23:25] every day is
[1:23:27] it belongs to him well I'm a little
[1:23:29] prejudiced but I think we have the
[1:23:32] finest music the finest musicians the
[1:23:34] most dedicated uh group that you'll find
[1:23:37] anywhere in the world would you thank
[1:23:39] God for them tonight
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:42] God bless you all
[1:23:45] thank you
[1:23:47] turn in your bibles if you will to Mark
[1:23:50] chapter 7.
[1:23:56] I want to read tonight beginning in
[1:23:58] verse 24.
[1:24:00] and I know that technically we could
[1:24:03] leave here tonight and say we have been
[1:24:06] in the presence of the Lord and wasn't
[1:24:09] it good and and we could go home early
[1:24:13] and rest be ready for tomorrow but God's
[1:24:16] not finished
[1:24:18] so so we better stick this out
[1:24:21] now some of you visitors you may think I
[1:24:23] just have to have my part well you don't
[1:24:25] know me very well because I would much
[1:24:28] rather just worship like we have
[1:24:30] worshiped tonight but I believe that we
[1:24:34] have a responsibility for the word to
[1:24:36] take preeminence Among Us and I don't
[1:24:39] mean the page
[1:24:40] I mean the Living Word he lives in you
[1:24:44] and I as a part of the bride of Christ
[1:24:47] so thank you for standing while we're
[1:24:49] reading the scripture you're going to be
[1:24:51] sitting a while I would assume and so
[1:24:54] thank you if you're able Mark chapter 7
[1:24:57] and verse 24 and from then she arose and
[1:25:02] went into the borders of tire and sidon
[1:25:06] and he entered into a house and would
[1:25:09] have no man know it but he could not be
[1:25:14] hid can anybody relate to those words
[1:25:17] this evening and he just a tad in the
[1:25:20] monitor
[1:25:21] he could not be hid
[1:25:24] the next verse for a certain woman whose
[1:25:28] young daughter had an unclean Spirit
[1:25:31] heard of him and came and fell at his
[1:25:36] feet I want you to notice something
[1:25:39] about this woman the woman was a Greek
[1:25:41] she was a syrophoenician by nation and
[1:25:45] she besought him that he would cast
[1:25:48] forth the devil out of her daughter
[1:25:52] her daughter wasn't necessarily present
[1:25:56] but Jesus said unto her let the children
[1:25:59] first be filled
[1:26:01] for it is not meat to take the
[1:26:04] children's bread and cast it unto the
[1:26:07] dogs
[1:26:08] I want you to know that was a pretty
[1:26:10] tough answer
[1:26:14] she was Greek she was cyrophoenician she
[1:26:17] lived she hailed from phenicia meaning
[1:26:20] she was a gentile she was of the nation
[1:26:24] she was not a Jew she had no right
[1:26:29] none
[1:26:31] and she knew that and even when the Lord
[1:26:35] insulted her
[1:26:39] she answered and said unto him yes Lord
[1:26:44] I don't have any power to argue with you
[1:26:48] for everything you say is the truth I'm
[1:26:51] just a dog
[1:26:53] but the dogs under the table in the
[1:26:57] Master's crumbs
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:01] how many of you like her faith
[1:27:04] come on let's finish it
[1:27:07] and he said unto her for this saying
[1:27:14] because you said the right thing
[1:27:18] go thy way the devil is gone out of thy
[1:27:22] daughter
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:24] I want you to look at verse 30 and when
[1:27:27] she was come to her house
[1:27:29] she found the devil gone out
[1:27:33] and her daughter laid upon the bed
[1:27:38] I know you've been standing a while
[1:27:41] but would you go with me to Matthew
[1:27:43] quickly
[1:27:44] chapter 15.
[1:27:46] verse 21 through 28 this is Matthew's
[1:27:51] telling
[1:27:53] Matthew is the detailed one
[1:27:57] and I want to get him in here too
[1:27:59] then Jesus went thence verse 21 and
[1:28:03] departed into the coast of tire and
[1:28:06] sadon
[1:28:07] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[1:28:10] the same coasts and Cried unto him
[1:28:13] saying have mercy on me O Lord
[1:28:18] thou son of David
[1:28:21] my daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:28:27] Devil
[1:28:29] she
[1:28:30] used a Messianic term
[1:28:33] something that a gentile had no rights
[1:28:38] two
[1:28:40] let's go on
[1:28:42] but he answered her not a word
[1:28:45] and his disciples came and besought him
[1:28:49] saying send her away for she crieth
[1:28:52] after us
[1:28:54] but he answered and said I am not sins
[1:29:00] but unto the lost sheep of the House of
[1:29:04] Israel
[1:29:06] then came she
[1:29:08] foreign
[1:29:17] he insults her he tells her she's the
[1:29:21] wrong race
[1:29:25] she basically is told your skin is a
[1:29:29] little dark
[1:29:34] you're not a part of this Covenant
[1:29:37] I am sent to the lost sheep of the House
[1:29:40] of Israel and she comes without an
[1:29:43] argument
[1:29:45] and she begins to worship him saying
[1:29:49] Lord help me
[1:29:53] but he answered and said it is not me to
[1:29:57] take the children's bread and cast it to
[1:30:00] dogs
[1:30:01] and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat
[1:30:05] of the crumbs which fall from their
[1:30:09] master's table and then Jesus answered
[1:30:12] and said unto her oh woman
[1:30:16] great is my faith
[1:30:19] Mark Mark said he said because you say
[1:30:23] the right thing
[1:30:24] Matthew said because you have great
[1:30:29] faith be it under thee even as thou Wilt
[1:30:33] and her daughter was made whole
[1:30:38] when did it start
[1:30:41] from that very hour let's pray together
[1:30:43] again father we are not gathered here
[1:30:46] tonight to see one another as wonderful
[1:30:49] as that is
[1:30:51] we are not here to Fellowship in the
[1:30:54] natural as wonderful as that is
[1:30:57] but we are here tonight to sit in your
[1:31:00] presence to tell you that you are God's
[1:31:03] Sovereign and supreme that you are a
[1:31:07] faithful Lord and that you hear all of
[1:31:10] our cries
[1:31:12] and you see all of our needs
[1:31:15] we have come tonight to raise up the
[1:31:18] truth of your word
[1:31:19] it is more to us than a printed page it
[1:31:23] has become a living reality now talk to
[1:31:26] us talk to us tonight there's probably
[1:31:30] not a person in this room that hasn't
[1:31:33] heard this story I preached some of
[1:31:36] these same things four years ago
[1:31:38] and others some were here and have heard
[1:31:41] some of these things deny but it was you
[1:31:44] by the holy spirit that took me here
[1:31:47] today when I had prepared something
[1:31:50] entirely different Lord I trust you
[1:31:53] even when I don't understand I trust you
[1:31:57] so I'm asking you to come tonight and
[1:32:00] say Amen to your word and heal the sick
[1:32:03] among us deliver the oppressed among us
[1:32:06] as they sit under the Living Word in the
[1:32:09] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:11] Yeshua our Messiah we pray and the saint
[1:32:15] said
[1:32:16] you may be seated tonight The Book of
[1:32:18] Mark
[1:32:19] identifies this woman is the
[1:32:22] syrophoenician meaning from phenicia a
[1:32:25] nation Northwest
[1:32:27] of the borders of Israel
[1:32:30] she was a Greek in religious practice
[1:32:33] and probably she spoke the broken Greek
[1:32:37] language she was most certainly a
[1:32:41] gentile Matthew tell this tells us that
[1:32:45] she was a descendant of Canaan and
[1:32:49] Canaan was a cursed race
[1:32:52] so we know that she was living under the
[1:32:57] stigma
[1:32:58] of being a descendant of the son of Noah
[1:33:03] that was cursed however she was a woman
[1:33:07] with a desperate need the burden of her
[1:33:11] pain was not for herself but for her
[1:33:14] daughter what which the scripture
[1:33:16] identifies the Affliction as being vexed
[1:33:21] with the devil in other words this
[1:33:24] daughter was under the power of Satan
[1:33:27] are you with me Mark 7 25 said when she
[1:33:31] heard of him
[1:33:33] you see the Miracles were were being
[1:33:36] spread around and the testimonies were
[1:33:39] getting around and and people were
[1:33:42] beginning to hear that everywhere he
[1:33:44] went Miracles were following and noise
[1:33:47] was accompanying The Gatherings and
[1:33:50] things that had never been seen before
[1:33:52] were being seen before and Jesus had
[1:33:56] made up his mind he was going on a
[1:33:58] little holiday the Bible if you read the
[1:34:01] detail of all the tellings of this story
[1:34:04] you will find that he needed to pull
[1:34:07] away from the pressing crowd and from
[1:34:10] the constant pool of the people he
[1:34:13] desired not to retire but to retire
[1:34:17] to get his strength renewed to be ready
[1:34:21] to finish the commission that his father
[1:34:23] had sent him to complete and so he finds
[1:34:27] a place that he can go just outside the
[1:34:31] border of the land of Israel he goes
[1:34:34] just upside just just to the north of
[1:34:37] the border of his
[1:34:41] where he can find some rest but the news
[1:34:45] had already begin to spread that the
[1:34:48] master the Healer the one that's causing
[1:34:51] all the disturbances in Israel has come
[1:34:55] to the coast of our town he is staying
[1:34:58] in a house just down the street and this
[1:35:02] woman says oh now it's my chance
[1:35:06] now it's my opportunity I didn't know
[1:35:10] how I would ever get way down to
[1:35:12] Jerusalem I didn't even know how I would
[1:35:15] be able to travel as far down as the
[1:35:18] Galilee but all he has come to my town
[1:35:24] he didn't know why he was there she
[1:35:26] didn't know
[1:35:28] come
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:30] know that he had come for a holiday I
[1:35:33] don't think it would have mattered very
[1:35:34] much all she knew is that for some
[1:35:38] reason the one that could help her had
[1:35:42] come to visit her town
[1:35:44] oh and she said I gotta go I gotta go
[1:35:48] and find out what all this is about she
[1:35:51] had great faith that God was going to do
[1:35:54] something for her are you with me
[1:35:56] tonight
[1:35:57] her daughter was vexed with the devil
[1:36:00] and yet she never said have mercy on my
[1:36:03] daughter
[1:36:07] she said have mercy on me
[1:36:10] any parent understands that pain
[1:36:13] when our children suffer we suffer with
[1:36:16] them there's nothing any more
[1:36:18] debilitating than to see your child in a
[1:36:20] problem or in a need and even when they
[1:36:22] get old enough to leave the house and
[1:36:25] you see them in such turmoil and such
[1:36:27] anguish and you feel so hopeless and so
[1:36:30] helpless and you can't do like you used
[1:36:32] to do and pick them up and kiss their
[1:36:35] boo-boo and tell them it's going to be
[1:36:37] all right all you can do is go to the
[1:36:39] Lord and so she made up her mind I'm not
[1:36:42] going to miss my opportunity I'm not
[1:36:44] going to let this chance Pass Me By he's
[1:36:48] in my neighborhood for a reason
[1:36:51] and I'm going to find him Mark said when
[1:36:54] she got there she fell down at his feet
[1:36:57] in the message perseverant paragraph 79
[1:37:01] brother random said this woman that we
[1:37:04] are talking of this syrophoenician woman
[1:37:07] she was a Greek she had heard about
[1:37:09] Jesus now Faith cometh by hearing
[1:37:13] hearing the word of God and she had
[1:37:17] heard
[1:37:18] that's all it took
[1:37:19] just the the power the prophetic power
[1:37:23] of a testimony
[1:37:26] hear me now the prophetic power of a
[1:37:30] testimony somebody told somebody who
[1:37:32] told somebody who told somebody who told
[1:37:35] somebody what the Lord had been doing
[1:37:39] now where do you fit in that
[1:37:42] because there's nobody can tell your
[1:37:45] story
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:49] everybody wants to tell their story to
[1:37:51] the preacher let me tell you something
[1:37:53] there's a world that's dying
[1:37:57] yeah and like granny used to say going
[1:37:59] to hell in a handbasket and they need
[1:38:02] somebody to tell their testimony
[1:38:06] they need to hear what Jesus is doing
[1:38:10] I know some of you saw that little post
[1:38:13] that that Jonathan made in our private
[1:38:16] uh Facebook and he mentioned the fact
[1:38:19] that we're what what is the anniversary
[1:38:22] 62 years tonight
[1:38:25] 62 years tomorrow brother random
[1:38:28] preached for the first time in Tucson at
[1:38:31] the Grant Avenue Assembly of God Church
[1:38:33] that later became the Tucson Tabernacle
[1:38:36] a brother who was going to that church
[1:38:39] who had heard of the ministry of brother
[1:38:42] Branham and what God was doing in his
[1:38:44] ministry he was building the stairs
[1:38:47] there's a roar up here he was building
[1:38:49] the stairs and working on the threshold
[1:38:52] of of the building the Assembly of God
[1:38:55] Church where he attended waiting on
[1:38:58] someone
[1:38:59] where's all my sound folks
[1:39:03] so he was down there with a nail and a
[1:39:06] hammer and he was working on the
[1:39:07] threshold of the Assembly of God Church
[1:39:10] and he laid his hand and he said Lord I
[1:39:13] just asked one thing of you
[1:39:17] this is where I go to church
[1:39:20] I love these people
[1:39:22] I'm learning more than they have learned
[1:39:25] and I'm asking you for one favor I'm
[1:39:27] asking you to bring the prophet of God
[1:39:29] across this threshold and let him preach
[1:39:32] in that pulpit and bring that message to
[1:39:35] my church
[1:39:37] foreign
[1:39:40] had not ever been invited to Tucson and
[1:39:43] it looked like that the churches had
[1:39:46] kind of made an
[1:39:47] alliance among themselves and they were
[1:39:50] going to do what they could to keep him
[1:39:52] out of town
[1:39:55] just like you saw in the chosen there
[1:39:57] were towns that wanted what he had and
[1:39:59] there were towns that would rather be
[1:40:01] left alone anybody following what I'm
[1:40:04] saying but this brother said this is
[1:40:06] what we need and because of that man's
[1:40:09] prayer God heard that prayer and the
[1:40:12] invitation was given and and brother
[1:40:14] Branham went and guess what the first
[1:40:16] message he preached was
[1:40:19] expectations
[1:40:22] I think it was on a Sunday morning
[1:40:25] and guess what he preached Sunday night
[1:40:30] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:40:34] today and forever I have come tonight to
[1:40:39] tell you that if you have come with
[1:40:41] expectation Jesus Jesus Christ is the
[1:40:45] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:40:51] changes not
[1:40:54] he's always the same
[1:40:57] what he did then he can do today what he
[1:41:01] did in Galilee he can do right here
[1:41:03] tonight
[1:41:04] what he did in the 50s he can do that
[1:41:07] tonight because he's the same God if you
[1:41:10] believe that I want you to squeeze out a
[1:41:12] little help oh yes
[1:41:15] she came to acknowledge
[1:41:17] to the master that she believed the
[1:41:20] report that she was hearing
[1:41:23] 15 22 of Matthew said she Cried unto him
[1:41:28] saying now that word cried in the Greek
[1:41:32] does not mean she said master
[1:41:36] listen
[1:41:37] master
[1:41:39] help me please
[1:41:42] sir if you don't mind
[1:41:45] all reverently you know
[1:41:47] oh
[1:41:49] I've got a need do you think you could
[1:41:52] help me no no that word means scream cry
[1:41:56] out exclaim shout and even flail
[1:42:01] I'm right here yeah that's it
[1:42:04] that's it that's it the disciples are
[1:42:07] walking along behind him they know he's
[1:42:09] nervous
[1:42:10] they know he needs a rest and they've
[1:42:13] got him like bodyguards
[1:42:19] do you have an appointment
[1:42:21] they're ready to protect him and keep
[1:42:23] him somebody's got to
[1:42:25] somebody had to keep him because
[1:42:28] remember God became man
[1:42:30] God was living in a body of Flesh 100
[1:42:33] God 100 man anybody following me he got
[1:42:38] wore out his nerves got bad he got tired
[1:42:41] he had aches and pains someone said I
[1:42:43] can't believe that then you don't
[1:42:44] believe what the book said the book said
[1:42:47] he was in all manner tempted as we are
[1:42:48] yet without sin the Bible said though he
[1:42:51] were a son yet he learned obedience by
[1:42:52] the things he suffered you do believe
[1:42:54] the book don't you
[1:42:56] and so the disciples were and and they
[1:42:59] were telling everybody that would
[1:43:03] they would hear people say that's him
[1:43:05] that's him that's him and the disciples
[1:43:08] were like this
[1:43:10] But Here Come a woman who didn't know
[1:43:12] the protocol
[1:43:16] she didn't know anything about church
[1:43:17] order she was a gentile
[1:43:20] one of them all dirty Gentiles that
[1:43:23] don't know anything about the way to
[1:43:24] Worship in the temple
[1:43:27] she knew it's her daughter was
[1:43:29] grievously mixed with the devil and she
[1:43:32] needed some help
[1:43:36] so she just threw herself down at his
[1:43:39] feet and she began to scream out have
[1:43:44] mercy on me oh Lord oh Adonai thy son of
[1:43:52] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:43:58] with the Devil

[1:44:13] the Master's resting the Master's weary
[1:44:16] oh she didn't care about all that all
[1:44:19] she could see was that daughter at home
[1:44:21] frailing around rolling around on the
[1:44:25] floor pulling her hair out by the
[1:44:27] handful vexed by a devil tormented by
[1:44:30] demons no Freedom no liberty no
[1:44:33] resemblance of a normal life that's all
[1:44:36] she could think about
[1:44:37] it didn't matter to her how it was
[1:44:39] supposed to be done all she needed all
[1:44:42] she knew was I need to get his attention
[1:44:44] I've got to let him know that among this
[1:44:47] community
[1:44:49] one at least one who believes the
[1:44:52] testimony that I've been hearing and I
[1:44:55] believe he is who they say he is
[1:44:59] and I want him to help me
[1:45:01] I love that kind of Faith don't you
[1:45:04] she was interceding for her daughter and
[1:45:06] she must have loved that daughter very
[1:45:08] much she had no claim on Jesus as the
[1:45:12] son of David it was very offensive to
[1:45:15] the Jews for a gentile to use the
[1:45:18] Messianic term thou son of David
[1:45:22] who are you to David
[1:45:24] what claim do you have you talk about
[1:45:27] Prejudice in this day I want you to know
[1:45:30] in that hour there was great prejudice
[1:45:34] maybe you've caught a glimpse of that if
[1:45:37] you've seen the chosen series maybe
[1:45:39] you've caught a little glimpse of the
[1:45:41] Prejudice the religious
[1:45:44] you have no right to be here
[1:45:47] and this is how this woman had been
[1:45:49] treated and how many people were being
[1:45:51] treated in that day because many of the
[1:45:54] Jews had lost their real connection with
[1:45:57] their faith and they were just going
[1:45:59] through the motions
[1:46:01] just doing what they had been taught to
[1:46:03] do with no real sincerity of Faith you
[1:46:06] know what it took some Gentiles getting
[1:46:08] in there
[1:46:10] turning Church order upside down
[1:46:14] you know what we need in our churches
[1:46:17] we need a few that don't know nothing
[1:46:20] about church order
[1:46:21] [Applause]
[1:46:23] we need some that haven't been reading
[1:46:26] their whole life in the Cod book
[1:46:29] we need some who just say I only know
[1:46:32] one thing I need help
[1:46:35] and you're the one you're the one who
[1:46:39] can help me
[1:46:41] we need some of that
[1:46:44] we need some of that
[1:46:46] but this proves that she had some
[1:46:48] perception of who he really was
[1:46:51] or she would have never used this
[1:46:53] exclusive Messianic title this was never
[1:46:56] to be used about the king it was never
[1:46:58] to be used about the priest it was never
[1:47:01] to be used about any of the other Faith
[1:47:03] leaders or spiritual leaders it was only
[1:47:06] to be a term used to describe and to
[1:47:09] address the Messiah when he came here
[1:47:12] was a gentile who knew very little about
[1:47:14] the Jewish faith yet she borrowed the
[1:47:17] title that she had heard because
[1:47:19] something resonated in her heart I
[1:47:22] believe he is I believe he is I believe
[1:47:25] he is who he says
[1:47:30] I do too brother and even if it was only
[1:47:33] based on stories and testimonies that
[1:47:36] she had heard she came with all the
[1:47:39] faith that she could muster she cried
[1:47:41] out to him she began to talk to him and
[1:47:44] the Bible said in Matthew 15 verse 23 he
[1:47:47] answered her not
[1:47:50] a word
[1:47:54] I hope you're listening
[1:47:57] somebody said what are you preaching
[1:47:58] tonight I'm preaching insulted
[1:48:00] and tested
[1:48:02] but been delivered
[1:48:07] insulted
[1:48:09] and then test it
[1:48:11] but delivered
[1:48:14] you want me to give you a subtitle
[1:48:16] there's no room for your feelings
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:24] the prophet of God said what do feelings
[1:48:25] have to do with him
[1:48:27] don't you come telling somebody what you
[1:48:29] feel
[1:48:31] your feelings are no no more no more
[1:48:34] important than my feelings
[1:48:36] somebody said you're giving bad marital
[1:48:38] advice I'm not talking about husbands
[1:48:39] and wives you better respect one
[1:48:42] another's feelings
[1:48:43] I'm talking about when you approach the
[1:48:45] law
[1:48:46] when you come when you come and ask for
[1:48:49] prayer nobody wants to hear your
[1:48:50] feelings
[1:48:52] they want to hear your faith
[1:48:55] my feelings say I have no hope my
[1:48:57] feelings say oh every time that the
[1:49:00] angel comes and troubles the water I
[1:49:02] don't have anybody to put me in
[1:49:05] that's what your feelings will say
[1:49:08] but faith says but I Don't Need No Angel
[1:49:11] troubling the water because I see who I
[1:49:14] see
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:17] I Know Who You Are
[1:49:19] you've got more to give me than the
[1:49:21] angel that come and travel the water
[1:49:24] if he only knew if he only realized if
[1:49:27] you only could recognize who was
[1:49:28] standing before him how many of you are
[1:49:30] following me now
[1:49:31] good very glad
[1:49:33] in fact she calls out she throws herself
[1:49:36] on the ground she screams she flails she
[1:49:39] says Thou son of David have mercy on me
[1:49:41] and he just keeps walking
[1:49:50] what do you think she did I wasn't there
[1:49:52] I don't want to add to the word but I
[1:49:54] think she got louder
[1:49:58] and you know what she did it all without
[1:50:00] without so much offense
[1:50:04] that she didn't pick her things up
[1:50:06] pick her purse back up that she'd throw
[1:50:08] it on the ground
[1:50:10] and said I'm going home because the
[1:50:11] preacher won't speak to me
[1:50:17] they've got all the Time in the World to
[1:50:19] listen to her prayer request
[1:50:21] but have you noticed when I go to get
[1:50:23] mine they cut me off
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:27] I bet if it was him texting he'd get an
[1:50:30] answer in the next few minutes
[1:50:34] I may not hear nothing at all
[1:50:38] come on
[1:50:40] all the things that get in our way
[1:50:44] did you notice when brother Shelley was
[1:50:46] calling out the prayer warriors names he
[1:50:48] left mine out
[1:50:51] it's so easy to get offended it's so
[1:50:54] easy to carry a fence it's so easy and
[1:50:57] let me tell you something the only hope
[1:50:58] she had ignored her
[1:51:02] he just just kept walking
[1:51:07] that was the best thing he did that was
[1:51:09] the nicest thing he did
[1:51:11] because he was going to talk to her
[1:51:17] he was going to offend her
[1:51:19] may I suggest to you that sometimes the
[1:51:23] only way that the true issues of the
[1:51:25] heart can be revealed is for the mind to
[1:51:29] be offended
[1:51:33] can I maybe say to you that the only way
[1:51:36] sometime our faith can be placed in the
[1:51:39] right thing
[1:51:42] it's when we're offended in our feelings
[1:51:45] and we quit looking to people to meet
[1:51:49] our need
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:54] well I went to the counselor and he said
[1:51:57] I was the problem
[1:52:00] come on
[1:52:02] bend it I'm never going back
[1:52:04] I took him over there took my wife over
[1:52:07] there because I thought for sure he was
[1:52:09] going to tell her she was the problem
[1:52:12] he looked right at me and told me I was
[1:52:14] a problem and I'm not going back to him
[1:52:17] because he don't have enough sense to
[1:52:18] counsel if he was a real counselor he'd
[1:52:21] know she's the problem
[1:52:24] you see how people get so quickly
[1:52:26] offended
[1:52:27] oh have mercy on me thou son of David
[1:52:30] for my daughter is grievously vexed with
[1:52:33] the devil and he just kept walking and
[1:52:36] she kept crying after them how do we
[1:52:38] know because the disciples said Lord
[1:52:40] would you just tell her to go home
[1:52:44] we need you to help us out send her away
[1:52:48] because she keeps on crying after us
[1:52:53] their sympathies were exhausted
[1:52:58] their sensibilities
[1:53:01] were exhausted
[1:53:03] their kindness
[1:53:06] had been exhausted
[1:53:08] the truth is the disciples were tired of
[1:53:13] people
[1:53:20] and I don't see a whole lot of
[1:53:22] compassion in what they said
[1:53:26] can't you just tell her to go home she
[1:53:31] won't leave us alone
[1:53:34] she cries after us
[1:53:36] Jesus didn't give that woman one little
[1:53:39] Reason for Hope
[1:53:44] but she would not settle
[1:53:46] for discouraging silence
[1:53:49] she would not settle for being ignored
[1:53:53] she would not take no for an answer she
[1:53:57] refused to let her only hope just keep
[1:54:00] walking up the hill
[1:54:03] anybody with me
[1:54:05] in the message perseverance paragraph
[1:54:07] 154 and 155
[1:54:10] you don't have to stop and do that read
[1:54:12] that do you know
[1:54:14] but I want to
[1:54:16] oh yeah
[1:54:19] he just ignored her
[1:54:22] he looked at her
[1:54:24] and he walked on
[1:54:25] I just want you to know I'm not taking
[1:54:27] too much license in adding to the story
[1:54:31] he just looked at her and he walked on
[1:54:34] oh my
[1:54:35] he was a little more than our modern
[1:54:37] Pentecost my
[1:54:39] turned up there
[1:54:41] there's
[1:54:42] and walked back and said I don't have to
[1:54:45] do that
[1:54:46] I want you all to read the next sentence
[1:54:48] it's in it's in white read the next
[1:54:50] sentence for me
[1:54:52] I want to be that woman
[1:54:54] I want to be that man
[1:54:56] I want to be that person that refuses to
[1:55:00] allow my feelings to keep me from
[1:55:03] putting my faith where my faith belongs
[1:55:05] my faith is not in preacher my faith is
[1:55:09] not in men
[1:55:11] my faith is not in brother Branham my
[1:55:14] faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:17] and I refuse to be so offended that I
[1:55:21] let my faith be misplaced
[1:55:24] I refuse to sit in the corner and lick
[1:55:27] my wounds and feel sorry for myself and
[1:55:30] let my only hope walk away
[1:55:34] I cannot let him walk away
[1:55:39] amen she didn't say how dare he ignore
[1:55:42] me
[1:55:43] she just kept crying Jesus Yeshua thou
[1:55:49] sudden David have mercy on
[1:56:01] but not that woman she had faith
[1:56:03] she stayed right there
[1:56:06] paragraph 155 now she went after him
[1:56:09] again
[1:56:15] be in my neighborhood
[1:56:18] today may be my only chance
[1:56:22] I can't go home and come back in the
[1:56:24] morning and hope that it'll be any
[1:56:26] different
[1:56:27] oh Lord can I just have and she wasn't
[1:56:31] thinking about what she had come through
[1:56:33] this is so important
[1:56:36] all right
[1:56:38] she wasn't thinking about how hard it
[1:56:41] had been
[1:56:42] she wasn't thinking about what she would
[1:56:45] have to go through
[1:56:46] the only thing we're reading on now
[1:56:51] the only thing she knowed
[1:56:54] she believed if she could get him to say
[1:56:59] so
[1:57:02] oh folks I don't want to get ahead of
[1:57:05] myself but it wasn't what he said
[1:57:10] the Bible said it was what she said
[1:57:13] [Applause]
[1:57:18] I'll read that again to you in just a
[1:57:20] moment the only thing she knows she
[1:57:22] believed that she could just get him to
[1:57:23] say so that's all she needed to know if
[1:57:26] he would say so
[1:57:29] she knowed it wasn't working on others
[1:57:31] why wouldn't it work on hers
[1:57:35] now this was her faith
[1:57:37] she needed to get his attention
[1:57:41] the disciples wanted to send her away
[1:57:44] they were looking for some peace and
[1:57:46] quiet
[1:57:48] and when he finally answered her she
[1:57:52] would not hush
[1:57:56] Matthew had a headache
[1:58:02] Peter
[1:58:07] he was ready to body slam her
[1:58:12] they had had enough of this silly woman
[1:58:15] yes I'm not trying to over exaggerate
[1:58:19] I'm just trying to tell you it takes
[1:58:21] somebody like that
[1:58:24] do you know it takes an irritant to
[1:58:27] produce a pearl
[1:58:31] [Music]
[1:58:32] did you know it takes somebody sometime
[1:58:35] to keep knocking
[1:58:38] one of the most famous sermons Jack Cole
[1:58:40] ever preached was keep knocking
[1:58:47] but he won't answer keep knocking
[1:58:50] but either he didn't come when I wanted
[1:58:52] him to keep knocking
[1:58:54] I know he's in there
[1:58:56] I can hear the music
[1:58:59] but he refuses to come to the keep
[1:59:00] knocking
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:11] when he does finally talk
[1:59:17] he offends her again
[1:59:20] by saying I am not sent but to the Lost
[1:59:24] house Matthew 15 24.
[1:59:26] I am not sent but under the lost lost
[1:59:29] sheep of the House of Israel
[1:59:32] this woman had to Cast Away her Pride
[1:59:34] she had to remain humble she couldn't
[1:59:36] care what other people thought about her
[1:59:37] but she had to make her need known
[1:59:40] Matthew 15 25 said then came she and
[1:59:43] worshiped him saying Lord help me
[1:59:47] to worship means to bow down kneeling
[1:59:50] before or prostrate oneself in adoration
[1:59:53] she called him Lord which is the word
[1:59:56] Master which is a title of respect and
[1:59:59] honor one who is in supreme authority
[2:00:02] when she addressed him as Lord she was
[2:00:05] saying to him I know that you have all
[2:00:08] authority
[2:00:10] if I go back like this I will find my
[2:00:13] daughter exactly as I left her
[2:00:16] but if I can get you to hear me
[2:00:22] speak to my need
[2:00:24] Everything Will Change
[2:00:27] in the message perseverance Dallas
[2:00:29] paragraph 105 he said now at first she
[2:00:34] called him son of David
[2:00:37] she as a gentile had no claims on him as
[2:00:42] the son of David
[2:00:45] that would not have moved him
[2:00:48] it further irritated and agitated the
[2:00:52] disciples
[2:00:53] but when she said Lord
[2:01:01] my Lord
[2:01:06] my Lord
[2:01:08] Lord of all
[2:01:10] Lord of all circumstances Master over
[2:01:14] all diseases Master over all my problems
[2:01:17] Master over all my fears Master over all
[2:01:21] my worries when he when she called him
[2:01:26] Lord he was her Lord she acknowledged
[2:01:30] him as her master and I want you to know
[2:01:33] something changed
[2:01:37] but you wouldn't know it by what he said
[2:01:41] in Mark 7 27 about that time he said let
[2:01:44] the children first be filled for it is
[2:01:46] not meat to take the children's bread
[2:01:48] and cast it to the dogs
[2:01:52] in her mind she must have been thinking
[2:01:54] but I saw something in his eye when I
[2:01:57] called him Lord I saw something in his
[2:01:59] face when I called him Lord I thought he
[2:02:01] was about to minister to my knee when I
[2:02:04] called him Lord but now
[2:02:06] he tells me that healing belongs only to
[2:02:09] the children
[2:02:13] and that it is not in order
[2:02:17] for the healing for the for the bread
[2:02:21] to be thrown
[2:02:24] to the Gentile dogs
[2:02:26] a Canaanite
[2:02:28] a woman of a cursed race
[2:02:32] it was not meat it was not proper it was
[2:02:35] not in order to do such a thing as that
[2:02:38] it wasn't proper
[2:02:40] and dogs
[2:02:42] unlike today where they're nearly
[2:02:46] worshiped in our society
[2:02:50] people who can't pay their own bills
[2:02:56] will spend hundreds and thousands of
[2:02:59] dollars
[2:03:01] on their animals
[2:03:02] I know how attached we can get I know
[2:03:05] how wonderful they can be and how they
[2:03:08] can Comfort us but there comes a time
[2:03:10] that we realize we can't afford to keep
[2:03:13] doing what we're doing
[2:03:15] in the Bible No Such Thing took place
[2:03:17] they were unclean animals
[2:03:21] they were not to be eaten
[2:03:23] they were unclean animals and they were
[2:03:25] not treated in the same especially among
[2:03:28] the Israelites they were not treated as
[2:03:30] they are today in the message respects
[2:03:34] 1961 brother Branham said not only
[2:03:37] turned her down
[2:03:39] on her request
[2:03:42] but called her a dog
[2:03:46] and a dog is one of the lowest names the
[2:03:48] Bible has you know
[2:03:50] in that culture
[2:03:53] Jesus didn't use
[2:03:56] the kind of term for dog that means of
[2:04:01] Royal lineage or a bloodline of Fame
[2:04:07] he used the common diminutive form of
[2:04:11] the term dogs and that's why in the
[2:04:14] Amplified it uses the phrase little dogs
[2:04:20] a great Bible
[2:04:22] a theologian or or a linguist one who
[2:04:25] studies the original language of the
[2:04:27] Bible he said Jesus softened the force
[2:04:30] of the expression with his use
[2:04:34] of the word that would be translated
[2:04:37] little dog
[2:04:39] clearly his reference was to a household
[2:04:42] pet which while not children in the
[2:04:45] house yet they did had a have a place as
[2:04:49] an affair of the house so we didn't call
[2:04:51] her a stray hound dog
[2:04:54] foreign
[2:05:03] sorry Mimi
[2:05:05] he called her a Fufu
[2:05:09] you know there are certain breeds of
[2:05:12] animals that are that are I always laugh
[2:05:14] and I say well that's not a dog
[2:05:18] that's a furry mouse
[2:05:22] when I think of dog I think of a pit
[2:05:24] bull I think of a rottweiler I think of
[2:05:27] I think of something with some strength
[2:05:31] I I don't usually think of a teacup
[2:05:34] poodle
[2:05:36] and I sure don't think of those
[2:05:38] obnoxious chihuahuas
[2:05:46] but Jesus is not calling her a hound dog
[2:05:52] a boutique
[2:05:54] is that right
[2:05:56] he's not calling her a basset hound
[2:06:00] he's calling her one of those little
[2:06:03] dogs that sit at the table and yep
[2:06:08] slowly
[2:06:13] you think that was softening the blow I
[2:06:16] don't
[2:06:18] how many of you have have had inside
[2:06:20] dogs and you know that when you sit down
[2:06:22] to eat they think they just think it's
[2:06:24] dinner time for them
[2:06:26] and that dog food you put in the bowl
[2:06:28] means nothing to them anymore they got
[2:06:31] real food on the table and they'll just
[2:06:33] come sit right in the table
[2:06:37] so Jesus is calling her one of those
[2:06:40] little Annoying dogs that won't let you
[2:06:43] eat your supper in peace
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:49] until you give them something under the
[2:06:52] table
[2:06:53] and then they're quiet as long as it
[2:06:56] takes them to chew anybody know dogs
[2:06:58] like that
[2:06:59] and when they finish nobody wants to
[2:07:01] admit it
[2:07:03] some of you has got 10 or 15 around your
[2:07:05] table maybe I don't know
[2:07:07] so he wasn't calling her a greyhound
[2:07:13] a noble Royal looking
[2:07:16] dog
[2:07:18] but he'd use the word that means
[2:07:22] annoying Littles
[2:07:25] yipping little
[2:07:30] Chihuahua
[2:07:37] and even that could not offend her
[2:07:43] if you were to come for prayer tonight
[2:07:45] and I were to tell you you're worse than
[2:07:48] a chihuahua
[2:07:50] come on
[2:07:52] every time I turn around I see you
[2:07:57] you must have no faith
[2:08:00] why do you keep coming time and time
[2:08:02] again and if I ask you you probably want
[2:08:05] me to pray for the same thing
[2:08:08] that you asked me to pray for the last
[2:08:10] time
[2:08:14] how would you act
[2:08:19] I want to know
[2:08:21] I want to know
[2:08:23] would you go home
[2:08:25] would you stomp on the way out
[2:08:30] would you call me names
[2:08:35] I can pretty well guess that you
[2:08:38] wouldn't be happy with me I'm not saying
[2:08:40] I should say that
[2:08:43] or that I'm going to say that
[2:08:46] because if you all will let me take this
[2:08:48] next vacation
[2:08:51] I am not likely to say that
[2:08:55] but if you fuss about me being gone for
[2:08:57] a while
[2:08:58] I might say that
[2:09:01] because we all have a limit
[2:09:04] come on now and I'm preaching on me
[2:09:07] and I'm just saying he's exhausted
[2:09:09] the disciples and nerves are afraid and
[2:09:13] the yapping dog keeps saying oh that's
[2:09:17] son of David have mercy on me now son of
[2:09:20] David have mercy on me thou son of David
[2:09:22] and what started off sounding like
[2:09:25] worship and what started off sounding
[2:09:28] like like praise and adoration it began
[2:09:31] to sound like howling animal
[2:09:34] just
[2:09:37] I'm gonna I'm gonna compare it to
[2:09:39] Charlie Brown's parents
[2:09:45] if anybody ever saw Charlie Brown you
[2:09:48] know the parents never get language
[2:09:57] and after a while
[2:10:00] it must have began to sound like that
[2:10:03] to the master so he turns to her and he
[2:10:06] says don't you know it's not lawful for
[2:10:09] me it's not meat for me to take the
[2:10:12] children's bread and cast it to the
[2:10:14] chihuahuas
[2:10:15] come on to the yelping dogs
[2:10:19] if you've got another example of a breed
[2:10:21] you can kick it out I don't know dogs
[2:10:23] that well
[2:10:25] huh
[2:10:26] no you wouldn't dare some of you
[2:10:27] wouldn't dare because you don't want to
[2:10:29] offend somebody here
[2:10:31] I see people stomping out now because
[2:10:33] we're talking about their dogs
[2:10:35] you'll never say that about sister
[2:10:37] Kathy's dog
[2:10:39] because that dog is too big to be a it's
[2:10:42] a dog
[2:10:43] she has a dog
[2:10:47] like a small horse
[2:10:52] so then he says to her uh you know I I I
[2:10:55] I I I can't
[2:10:58] I can't count it's not lawful for me to
[2:11:00] cast this food like this a healing
[2:11:02] belongs to the children
[2:11:05] brother random said
[2:11:06] he turned her down bitterly
[2:11:12] basically called her a little pet dog
[2:11:15] and she did not argue with the statement
[2:11:19] oh
[2:11:21] I must sound like that
[2:11:23] I I must sound annoying
[2:11:26] I can only imagine what I must look like
[2:11:29] rolling around here on the floor all
[2:11:31] these thoughts going through her mind he
[2:11:33] had every right to say that to me she's
[2:11:35] thinking
[2:11:36] and her answer
[2:11:38] is yes Lord
[2:11:41] truth
[2:11:42] Lord
[2:11:44] you speak the truth
[2:11:46] are you still with me you speak the
[2:11:48] truth Lord I want you to look at what
[2:11:50] Jesus said in Mark 7 29 Jesus responded
[2:11:54] for this saying
[2:11:59] for this saying
[2:12:02] go thy way
[2:12:05] what saying
[2:12:07] truth Lord
[2:12:09] you speak the truth let me tell you
[2:12:11] something if Jesus says it your smartest
[2:12:14] move
[2:12:16] is to say yes Lord
[2:12:21] if Jesus says I uh if the word says such
[2:12:25] and such and such our best response is
[2:12:27] to say Amen
[2:12:28] which means so be it so be it
[2:12:31] so be it if Jesus calls us through his
[2:12:34] word to dress a little different than
[2:12:36] the society around us our response
[2:12:40] should not be but this is not biblical
[2:12:42] times our response should be yes Lord
[2:12:48] if the word calls a sister to have long
[2:12:51] hair as a covering for her head
[2:12:54] then her answer shouldn't be but that's
[2:12:56] not modern and I'll look too old and my
[2:13:00] husband won't love me anymore and I'll
[2:13:02] be made fun of and nobody thinks gray
[2:13:05] hair long gray hair is attractive her
[2:13:07] answer will be yes Lord
[2:13:12] if the word calls us away from from from
[2:13:15] from some of the habits that we develop
[2:13:17] and I woke up this morning and the Lord
[2:13:20] was talking to me about people becoming
[2:13:22] dependent even on on on pot
[2:13:28] I'm not talking about a medical help
[2:13:33] I'm talking about to chill
[2:13:37] I don't know who would hear this
[2:13:40] that would find that as a part of your
[2:13:43] life
[2:13:44] but very strange for me to wake up in
[2:13:47] the morning
[2:13:48] but that being in my heart
[2:13:51] if the Lord would call us not to depend
[2:13:55] on on pill or plant or or whatever we
[2:13:59] may become too dependent on so dependent
[2:14:01] on that we forget his ability to heal us
[2:14:07] and if he should call us wouldn't our
[2:14:10] answer wouldn't our our only answer be
[2:14:13] yes Lord truth Lord and Jesus said for
[2:14:16] this saying
[2:14:17] go thy way
[2:14:19] Matthew records the assessment of Our
[2:14:22] Lord in 1528 he said woman great is thy
[2:14:27] faith because of her faith expressed in
[2:14:30] her thoughtful exchange with Jesus the
[2:14:33] Lord granted her request for a miracle
[2:14:37] and the verb tense of is gone out is in
[2:14:40] the perfect tense reflecting the Lord's
[2:14:43] control and power and that means the
[2:14:46] demon left while they were still
[2:14:49] speaking
[2:14:51] and would remain out
[2:14:54] because the perfect tense of the word
[2:14:56] speaks of a completed action
[2:14:58] so not only is the devil leaving the
[2:15:01] daughter right now because you have said
[2:15:05] the right thing
[2:15:07] but he will find no place to return can
[2:15:10] anybody give God some praise
[2:15:14] I'm nearly done
[2:15:19] in questions and answers paragraph 229
[2:15:22] he said oh God seemingly a flat refusal
[2:15:27] and not only that but to call her a dog
[2:15:30] but instead of being arrogant about it
[2:15:32] very sweetly and humbly she said that is
[2:15:36] true Lord because it was truth she said
[2:15:40] it is true Lord but the dogs will eat
[2:15:43] the scraps that fall from their master's
[2:15:47] table so even though I am looked upon as
[2:15:51] a dog I'm not asking to get up on top of
[2:15:54] the table and have what the family's
[2:15:56] having
[2:15:58] all I'm asking Lord is that you hear me
[2:16:01] when I ask for the crumbs how many of
[2:16:03] your glad for Grace how many of you are
[2:16:06] glad for a newer Testament how many of
[2:16:08] your dad you're no longer a dog sitting
[2:16:10] around the master's table
[2:16:12] oh but you are mephibosheth
[2:16:16] you're sitting at the table
[2:16:19] every handicap is hidden beneath the
[2:16:23] table and you're eating what the king
[2:16:25] eats
[2:16:26] you are no longer a beggar around the
[2:16:29] table of the master you now have a place
[2:16:32] at the table
[2:16:33] and God that's what that's what done the
[2:16:36] work she was willing just to take the
[2:16:39] scraps that come from the from the
[2:16:40] children's table and God that's our
[2:16:43] attitude just now we're willing to
[2:16:45] anything that you want to do with us
[2:16:46] father we're in your hands can anybody
[2:16:51] say man we're in your hands
[2:16:54] and then the message questions and
[2:16:56] answers on the Holy Ghost paragraph 19
[2:16:57] he goes on to say she said that's true
[2:17:00] Lord
[2:17:01] but the dog under the table eats the
[2:17:03] children's crumbs he said for this
[2:17:07] saying
[2:17:13] remember he is the high priest of our
[2:17:16] confession
[2:17:17] so it matters what we're saying
[2:17:21] it's what she said that caused the Lord
[2:17:24] to identify her faith
[2:17:27] she talked like faith
[2:17:29] she spoke like Faith she even behaved
[2:17:32] like Faith she rattled the cage like
[2:17:34] Faith wow
[2:17:37] I'm not giving up
[2:17:39] I'm not slacking up
[2:17:41] I'm not laying down
[2:17:43] no no no no no no for this saying the
[2:17:46] devil's left your daughter say good
[2:17:48] things then
[2:17:53] you want God to feed you at his table
[2:17:56] say good things
[2:17:57] say faith-filled things say something
[2:18:00] good about somebody
[2:18:02] matters what you say talk about Jesus
[2:18:05] say something loyal something real
[2:18:07] that's a way to get rid of devils
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:13] all right notice he never prayed for the
[2:18:16] girl
[2:18:17] oh isn't that good
[2:18:20] he never prayed for the girl he never
[2:18:22] said one thing about her being healed he
[2:18:24] just said for this saying
[2:18:27] for this saying
[2:18:30] now I want you to look at this story
[2:18:37] sister weem sitting there and Royale
[2:18:39] streaming tonight perhaps
[2:18:42] they knew a modern
[2:18:45] cyrophoenician woman
[2:18:48] they knew a little woman by the name of
[2:18:51] Hattie Wright Mosier
[2:18:57] brother Branham refers to this
[2:19:00] incredible story in speaking about the
[2:19:03] syrophoenician woman he said how do you
[2:19:05] write the other day
[2:19:06] she didn't ask for nothing
[2:19:08] she was just sitting there
[2:19:11] but she said the right thing
[2:19:13] yeah
[2:19:15] which pleased the Holy Spirit you know
[2:19:18] the story
[2:19:22] brother Branham is sitting at her
[2:19:24] kitchen table
[2:19:27] she has prepared a meal they've been
[2:19:30] squirrel hunting
[2:19:32] she has prepared a meal
[2:19:36] her two young boys
[2:19:39] preteen boys
[2:19:43] could care less about church
[2:19:46] and the things of God
[2:19:49] they thought all this was silly
[2:19:52] brother Branham is telling sister Hattie
[2:19:55] and the family there
[2:19:57] the story
[2:20:00] of how God had created by the power of
[2:20:03] the spoken word you better understand
[2:20:05] that you better come to understand that
[2:20:08] the spoken word is a real thing and that
[2:20:11] it is creative
[2:20:13] and that it's going to be a part of this
[2:20:15] last great move of the Holy Ghost
[2:20:17] when the full manifestation of the sons
[2:20:20] of God has come into full fruition
[2:20:23] when that fully adopted group of
[2:20:25] Believers rise up in the name of the
[2:20:27] Lord Jesus Christ the word in their
[2:20:30] mouth will be his word brother random
[2:20:33] said in the quote I read you recently
[2:20:35] they will have the bride they will have
[2:20:39] the saith the Lord or they will keep
[2:20:41] still
[2:20:43] that's what we're pushing forward we get
[2:20:45] often accused of looking back the only
[2:20:47] reason why we're looking back is to see
[2:20:49] who God was
[2:20:52] so that we can bring him forward to this
[2:20:54] hour and say he is
[2:20:58] many didn't see the things that we have
[2:21:01] been privileged to know about
[2:21:03] I have probably interviewed more living
[2:21:06] Witnesses of the ministry of brother
[2:21:09] Branham than anybody in this room and I
[2:21:11] couldn't stand here all night long and
[2:21:14] relate the stories that I have heard
[2:21:17] with my own ears
[2:21:21] I ministered in Chautauqua just outside
[2:21:24] of Chautauqua Ohio for brother Ledford
[2:21:31] and heard him tell the story
[2:21:34] of how they took the little girl the
[2:21:37] little neighbor girl dying of leukemia
[2:21:41] her parents were not Believers but they
[2:21:44] convinced
[2:21:46] and the parents didn't attend the
[2:21:48] ledford's church
[2:21:51] but they convinced
[2:21:53] the neighbors to let them take their
[2:21:55] daughter from Ohio from Middletown Ohio
[2:21:58] all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana
[2:22:01] to be prayed for
[2:22:03] and they were able to get a private
[2:22:05] interview with brother Branham and he
[2:22:07] prayed for the little girl and the Lord
[2:22:09] healed her
[2:22:11] she hadn't eaten in days the doctors had
[2:22:14] given her up and it wasn't treatable in
[2:22:17] those days like it is treatable now and
[2:22:19] in fact it was a it was a type of
[2:22:21] leukemia
[2:22:23] that's not considered a part of the
[2:22:25] childhood leukemia family or lack of a
[2:22:29] better word
[2:22:31] and so there was no no what they had
[2:22:34] done to treat her wasn't doing any good
[2:22:36] she had lost her appetite her belly had
[2:22:38] swelled
[2:22:40] and she was really at the point of death
[2:22:42] and I have to be honest when when sister
[2:22:45] Ledford was was helping brother Ledford
[2:22:47] they were going back and forth telling
[2:22:49] me this story did anybody ever know
[2:22:50] brother and sister Ledford who pastored
[2:22:52] in Middletown Ohio
[2:22:54] anyway precious people
[2:22:57] precious
[2:22:59] wonderful people as they were telling it
[2:23:02] back and forth
[2:23:04] she said I I I said to them I'm having a
[2:23:08] hard time imagining
[2:23:10] parents
[2:23:12] letting the neighbor take their dying
[2:23:15] child
[2:23:17] she said I know brother Shelley it's
[2:23:20] crazy
[2:23:21] she said but I ask
[2:23:24] and they said yes
[2:23:27] they had given up all hope
[2:23:30] they had nothing much to lose
[2:23:33] they were both working every day to pay
[2:23:36] for what she had received in medical
[2:23:39] treatment they could not take time off
[2:23:41] we had to take a day off to go and they
[2:23:43] drove all the way home that night
[2:23:46] didn't get home to the wee hours of the
[2:23:48] morning
[2:23:49] God so instantly healed that girl that
[2:23:51] by the time the service was this was
[2:23:53] before the service by the time the
[2:23:55] service was over the swelling had gone
[2:23:57] down in her belly
[2:23:59] she slept through the preaching
[2:24:07] they got in the vehicle and
[2:24:09] brother Ledford looked at I almost
[2:24:11] called her first name I'm sorry
[2:24:13] I can't think of it I can see her I can
[2:24:15] see her hair I can see her
[2:24:18] he's kind of a large lady I can see her
[2:24:21] very well
[2:24:23] he looked brother Ledford looked at
[2:24:25] sister Ledford and she looked at him and
[2:24:28] he said honey are you thinking what I'm
[2:24:30] thinking
[2:24:32] and she said yes husband are you
[2:24:34] thinking what I'm thinking
[2:24:36] they were passing the Burger Joint
[2:24:42] but the Ledford said going all the way
[2:24:43] up we wouldn't eat a bite of food
[2:24:45] because we knew she couldn't tolerate
[2:24:47] food and we wouldn't eat it in front of
[2:24:49] her and she said he said now we were
[2:24:51] getting hungry
[2:24:54] now she's been healed her stomach has
[2:24:56] gone down and and said are you think of
[2:24:59] what I'm thinking yeah I'm thinking what
[2:25:00] aren't you
[2:25:01] what will they do if we offer
[2:25:06] the little girl some food
[2:25:08] they there's no telling what they may
[2:25:10] say to us or do do to us
[2:25:13] and about that time the little girl woke
[2:25:15] up
[2:25:16] and they said sweetheart are you hungry
[2:25:17] I sure am
[2:25:23] except for for what would you like she
[2:25:25] said I could sure eat a burger and fries
[2:25:31] so they they they they shot right into
[2:25:33] one of those burger joints where they
[2:25:35] where they come out and serve you at the
[2:25:37] little speaker
[2:25:39] they all had a big burger she had a big
[2:25:42] burger
[2:25:43] fries
[2:25:46] we were getting ready to pay and she
[2:25:49] said the little girl said Mr Ledford
[2:25:54] do you think I could have another Burger
[2:25:59] he said honey maybe you shouldn't have
[2:26:02] two burgers cause said you have not
[2:26:03] eaten in days
[2:26:06] and she said that he said I don't know
[2:26:08] how this is going to affect you your
[2:26:10] digestion since you have any she said
[2:26:11] but I sure believe I could eat another
[2:26:13] Burger he said then another Burger
[2:26:14] you'll have
[2:26:19] God moved so much for that child I want
[2:26:23] you to know God healed her
[2:26:26] sister Ledford said maybe this is too
[2:26:28] much information brother Shelley but she
[2:26:31] said she never even had to go to the
[2:26:33] bathroom
[2:26:35] we drove all the way home
[2:26:38] we didn't dare tell the mother what had
[2:26:40] happened
[2:26:42] about the burger
[2:26:44] we told her what brother Randleman said
[2:26:46] and how God had healed and the and the
[2:26:48] stomach had gone down and they could see
[2:26:51] how strong she looked her color was back
[2:26:56] and the mama said the mama said honey
[2:26:58] are you hungry
[2:27:05] that lady then I didn't get to meet her
[2:27:08] but that lady then was was a a
[2:27:12] supervisor of nurses
[2:27:15] at the hospital
[2:27:17] with children grown children now of Our
[2:27:21] Own
[2:27:22] that is what God did
[2:27:26] that's who he was
[2:27:28] we reminisce on what he did
[2:27:32] so that we can say he's the same today
[2:27:39] if we forget who he was and what he did
[2:27:42] yesterday we have no real perception of
[2:27:45] what he can do today I feel Faith now I
[2:27:47] feel Faith now I feel Faith now
[2:27:52] and then how will we have faith for the
[2:27:54] future
[2:27:56] yesterday and today
[2:28:01] oh
[2:28:03] sister Hattie Wright is hearing the
[2:28:06] story of how God we got to close
[2:28:09] of how God had healed I mean had created
[2:28:12] by the spoken word
[2:28:15] just like he did for Abraham
[2:28:18] when he put that Ram in the thicket
[2:28:22] God has provided himself that's a spoken
[2:28:25] word Ram
[2:28:27] God put it there
[2:28:29] by his creative word
[2:28:31] just like God and you know what sister
[2:28:33] Hattie she said brother Branham that
[2:28:37] ain't nothing but the truth
[2:28:45] what the Salvation woman said truth Lord
[2:28:50] she said my brother random that ain't
[2:28:52] nothing but the truth
[2:28:54] and the anointing of the Lord fell on
[2:28:57] him
[2:28:58] that same presence of God that met him
[2:29:01] out there in that boat when he gave
[2:29:03] Resurrection Life to the little fish
[2:29:04] that same presence of God that spoke the
[2:29:07] word and said at some point that when
[2:29:10] before the doctor's hand touches that
[2:29:12] tumor in in me decide that tumor will
[2:29:16] disappear and it dead the same God who
[2:29:18] said speak to the storm
[2:29:21] and the storm ceased
[2:29:26] same God who said put the squirrels
[2:29:29] where you want them and they'll be there
[2:29:32] all right the same God moved on brother
[2:29:34] Branham he stood up from that table the
[2:29:37] spirit of the Lord fell on him and he
[2:29:38] said had he right sister Hattie you can
[2:29:40] have anything you asked for
[2:29:44] he said you just asking I'll give it to
[2:29:46] you in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:29:52] I'll give it to you in the name of Jesus
[2:29:54] Christ you just ask and I'll give it to
[2:29:56] you now here's what brother Brandon said
[2:29:58] you can choose to believe it or not he
[2:30:00] said that if she would have asked for a
[2:30:02] million dollars it would have fell in
[2:30:03] her lap
[2:30:05] oh
[2:30:06] I don't believe
[2:30:11] then don't you come up here asking for
[2:30:13] prayer
[2:30:14] because if you can't believe that God
[2:30:16] can do that
[2:30:18] you probably don't have the faith for
[2:30:20] your own need anybody I don't mean to be
[2:30:23] rude I'm just telling you how I feel
[2:30:26] even your mind even my mind says well
[2:30:28] how would that happen well I don't know
[2:30:29] I don't uh maybe some some thieves hit
[2:30:32] it in the ceiling
[2:30:36] she says the right thing and God opens
[2:30:38] up the ceiling and dumps it right down
[2:30:39] out of the rafters you know I don't know
[2:30:41] how
[2:30:42] brother Branham said Hattie was so poor
[2:30:45] and so so unlearned that she didn't even
[2:30:48] know what to ask for sister Weems matter
[2:30:50] sister Royale
[2:30:53] Ada spent the night in her house and ate
[2:30:56] at her table
[2:30:57] knew her these are people that knew this
[2:31:00] woman
[2:31:01] brother Brandon said she could have
[2:31:03] asked for anything Edith and her sister
[2:31:04] was a crippled
[2:31:06] needed to be healed her mother and dad
[2:31:09] were old Indigent people who had no
[2:31:11] money no Health Care no way to take care
[2:31:14] of themselves they lived in a shotgun
[2:31:16] house with no indoor plumbing until the
[2:31:19] deacons of the Tabernacle went and put
[2:31:21] him some indoor plumbing
[2:31:22] they had nothing
[2:31:25] and she didn't know what to ask for so
[2:31:27] she asked brother Branham for some help
[2:31:30] this is no Genie in a Bottle this is
[2:31:33] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[2:31:36] today and forever this is a little woman
[2:31:38] who who was insulted by these words but
[2:31:42] refused to allow that to move her faith
[2:31:47] she was insulted and then tested and
[2:31:50] then she saw the Deliverance
[2:31:54] are you willing
[2:31:58] what if life insults you
[2:32:03] what if not enough people cater to your
[2:32:06] problem and you get old been out of
[2:32:09] shape
[2:32:10] will you be able to push past the insult
[2:32:13] push Pat the hurt feelings
[2:32:16] and allow God to give the Deliverance
[2:32:18] that's needed I must I must I can't
[2:32:21] afford to miss my blessing now
[2:32:23] and about that time
[2:32:29] Orville
[2:32:31] and what was the other one's name
[2:32:33] koi
[2:32:35] I always like to say Orville and Wilbur
[2:32:39] that was the Flying Brothers
[2:32:42] what was their names right brother
[2:32:48] isn't that unusual
[2:32:50] Orville and Wilbur Wright well this was
[2:32:52] Coy and Orville right
[2:32:56] they were standing there there's
[2:32:57] teenagers in the door
[2:32:59] brother Brandon called him a bunch of
[2:33:01] Snicker
[2:33:02] Snicker Fritz
[2:33:06] I even forget that sometime when I'm
[2:33:08] telling it and I say snickerdoodle
[2:33:10] by the way that's an amazing cookie
[2:33:15] but he said they're standing there like
[2:33:16] a bunch of sugar friends
[2:33:18] laughing
[2:33:20] they thought the story was funny
[2:33:23] and they're studying they're snickering
[2:33:27] and all of a sudden sister Hattie didn't
[2:33:29] have to decide anymore
[2:33:31] what she wanted her
[2:33:33] I want you to put yourself in the in a
[2:33:35] genie movie
[2:33:37] I want you to realize you got one wish
[2:33:39] now
[2:33:40] you better wish for the right thing
[2:33:42] that's how we think this was this was
[2:33:44] Jesus Christ the same
[2:33:48] yesterday
[2:33:49] and today and forever but in this moment
[2:33:54] had he Wright had said the right thing
[2:33:56] and God was going to give her whatever
[2:33:57] her heart desired
[2:34:01] and she turned and saw those two boys
[2:34:03] over there carrying on like a bunch of
[2:34:05] Snicker Fritz
[2:34:07] and she said brother Brandon I want the
[2:34:09] salvation of my two boys
[2:34:17] [Music]
[2:34:18] oh it don't happen that way it can't
[2:34:20] happen that way don't tell me you've
[2:34:22] never seemed in what the spirit of
[2:34:23] conviction can do
[2:34:25] we need it in the church we got
[2:34:28] everything else out there we need some
[2:34:30] of that come on
[2:34:32] sad stories and church joinings and all
[2:34:36] the things they do in the name of
[2:34:38] religion when all we really need is for
[2:34:41] the spirit of conviction
[2:34:43] to come into this room and that day the
[2:34:47] spirit of conviction fell in that dining
[2:34:49] room in that kitchen of old sister
[2:34:51] Hattie right
[2:34:54] and brother random looked over and he
[2:34:55] said I give them to you in the name of
[2:34:57] Jesus Christ
[2:34:59] the spirit of conviction fell on those
[2:35:02] boys who were laughing just two seconds
[2:35:04] ten seconds before and now they run
[2:35:07] across the kitchen floor
[2:35:11] and throw themselves in their mother's
[2:35:14] lap calling on the name of God for their
[2:35:17] salvation
[2:35:18] [Music]
[2:35:23] show me the picture
[2:35:25] Nathan is there in the projector folder
[2:35:28] I believe we've showed it before of
[2:35:30] these two boys getting baptized
[2:35:33] they got serious about the Lord
[2:35:38] there they are that sister had it right
[2:35:40] in the middle and the two boys
[2:35:43] that was the day of their baptism
[2:35:49] this is what I believe
[2:35:52] I believe that the spirit of conviction
[2:35:54] is going to operate that way in the last
[2:35:56] days
[2:35:57] I do
[2:35:58] I actually believe that there are people
[2:36:00] that the Lord has held right where they
[2:36:04] are
[2:36:06] I believe I know people that haven't
[2:36:09] come to Faith because of what was going
[2:36:12] on in particular churches in their area
[2:36:15] and God allowed them protected them and
[2:36:17] held them with his hand right where they
[2:36:20] were for the right time
[2:36:24] very bad
[2:36:26] had the spirit of conviction hit them
[2:36:28] and they ran to the church as an early
[2:36:31] believer God sees all and knows all he's
[2:36:34] sovereign
[2:36:35] and I believe I know of situations where
[2:36:37] God saw that that would have been too
[2:36:40] much it's not like you and I veterans
[2:36:42] who have been through just about
[2:36:43] anything you can go through in the
[2:36:45] church
[2:36:47] and Like Comics we just keep on ticking
[2:36:51] but everybody's not like the Energizer
[2:36:53] Bunny
[2:36:55] and I've watched God hold people right
[2:36:57] where they are
[2:36:59] until the right hour
[2:37:01] send the spirit of conviction for them
[2:37:04] them cursing religion and Faith one
[2:37:07] moment
[2:37:08] one day
[2:37:09] and the next day falling in the altars
[2:37:12] giving their hearts to God baptized in
[2:37:14] the name of Jesus filled with the Holy
[2:37:15] Ghost serving the lord today don't you
[2:37:18] give up on your loved ones I don't care
[2:37:20] how mean they are I don't care how there
[2:37:23] are no hard cases
[2:37:28] you may be listening to me tonight and
[2:37:31] you may think you're a hard case Jesus
[2:37:33] doesn't know what a hard case is
[2:37:35] you're just a case
[2:37:38] you're just the case that's what you are
[2:37:40] is just the case
[2:37:42] there are no hard cases all you've got
[2:37:45] to do is make up your mind like that
[2:37:47] little syrup Phoenician woman
[2:37:49] I'm not listening to anybody's insults
[2:37:52] nobody's going to keep me from the
[2:37:54] master
[2:37:57] wow
[2:37:59] my faith is going to push me forward let
[2:38:02] anybody musicians are coming let anybody
[2:38:05] try to hold me back but they're not
[2:38:06] going to be successful because I've just
[2:38:08] got to get to the master
[2:38:11] you saw the little woman we showed you
[2:38:13] the little clip the little woman with
[2:38:14] the issue of blood what about what we
[2:38:16] saw the other night what about Peter
[2:38:21] I will forever remember
[2:38:26] in the episode of The Chosen there were
[2:38:29] 60 of us and I understand some of you
[2:38:31] all went the night after there were 60
[2:38:32] of us there
[2:38:38] and in that scene yes I'm going to give
[2:38:41] it away you ought to been there you
[2:38:43] ought to been there
[2:38:45] I've never seen a more real and less
[2:38:48] cheesy
[2:38:50] thank God thank God thank God somebody
[2:38:53] has finally made something
[2:38:57] that's not cheesy
[2:38:59] and cheap looking
[2:39:01] when Jesus comes walking on the water
[2:39:04] in that camera that camera of you from
[2:39:06] beneath the water
[2:39:08] shows his feet there and Peter who's
[2:39:11] been struggling with his faith Cries Out
[2:39:14] just bid me come to you just bid me come
[2:39:17] to you and I'll come to you that's
[2:39:19] that's right there that's all we needed
[2:39:22] it moved me so deeply
[2:39:26] and then the the scene and Peter gets
[2:39:29] out there and he's walking on the water
[2:39:30] and the other disciples you know they
[2:39:32] were jealous
[2:39:36] don't you forget that's that same bunch
[2:39:38] of disciples that was aggravated with
[2:39:40] that poor woman
[2:39:42] but they were human
[2:39:44] they were human
[2:39:46] are you human
[2:39:48] but you're Supernatural
[2:39:52] and they're probably wondering wonder
[2:39:53] why he got to walk on the water
[2:39:55] you know he's been all been out of shape
[2:39:57] now for weeks he's been the least
[2:39:59] fate-filled of all of us we've all been
[2:40:01] more faithful
[2:40:04] why'd he get to walk on the water look
[2:40:05] at that look at what a show-off
[2:40:08] I'm sure some of them had that in their
[2:40:10] mind but Peter could I want you to know
[2:40:11] even care
[2:40:14] and when you got arms like that you
[2:40:16] don't care what people say anyway
[2:40:21] he got out a little short thing a little
[2:40:23] short thing but great arms
[2:40:25] and he gets out and he starts doing good
[2:40:28] and then that first moment yeah
[2:40:32] first moment I saw the first moment that
[2:40:34] he caught the wind in the wave
[2:40:36] and he looked away and he starts going
[2:40:38] and in that scene where that hand comes
[2:40:40] down underneath that water I could
[2:40:42] almost feel myself being pulled up out
[2:40:44] of the depth come on
[2:40:48] but that wasn't the greatest part
[2:40:50] the greatest part is when he gets in the
[2:40:53] boat and he has wrapped his arms around
[2:40:56] the Lord and he's saying don't let me go
[2:40:59] don't let me go don't let me go don't
[2:41:01] let me go don't let me go don't let me
[2:41:03] go don't let me go don't let me go don't
[2:41:05] let me go come on somebody don't let me
[2:41:09] go
[2:41:11] let me go it's not kind of like this
[2:41:13] woman who said oh thou son of David have
[2:41:17] mercy on me
[2:41:22] because you said the right thing that
[2:41:25] that left that demon left that Devil's
[2:41:27] gone it's gone when she got home she
[2:41:29] found her daughter
[2:41:36] he may not come when you want him
[2:41:40] his timing may not be your timing
[2:41:43] but he's the same
[2:41:47] we may not see the scale
[2:41:50] the
[2:41:52] the number of Miracles
[2:41:55] in this day
[2:41:57] that we saw in the last generation
[2:42:00] but remember these things are prophesied
[2:42:02] we are told that it would be this way
[2:42:05] but that should never become an excuse
[2:42:09] for us not to believe
[2:42:12] that he is able to do today
[2:42:15] what he's always done he is faithful
[2:42:19] I want you to lift your hands right now
[2:42:22] I want you all to find a song to lead us
[2:42:24] in worship and we're just for a moment
[2:42:26] we're just going to stand where we are
[2:42:27] and we're just going to raise up our
[2:42:30] hands
[2:42:31] and we're just going to begin to Worship
[2:42:33] the Lord one more time because I don't
[2:42:36] know what your need is but the Lord
[2:42:38] knows your need he sees your need right
[2:42:41] where you are and he wants to help you
[2:42:44] right you don't need a preacher
[2:42:47] you need a master
[2:42:50] you need a master
[2:42:53] you need a lord
[2:42:56] it doesn't matter what you're going
[2:42:58] through right now
[2:43:00] what you've been walking through Jesus
[2:43:02] is able
[2:43:04] he's able to heal he's able to deliver
[2:43:07] he's able to set free
[2:43:11] lead us in something he became
[2:43:14] [Music]

[2:49:15] name above all
[2:49:18] this is
[2:49:20] Mr Barbara is that right would you all
[2:49:23] disagree
[2:49:24] that the Lord would touch Our Sister
[2:49:26] Barbara
[2:49:27] she's come here in faith knowing that
[2:49:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:49:31] forever
[2:49:33] we don't know what God's mind is for
[2:49:35] right now but we know this she has faith
[2:49:38] you may not hear her crying out but
[2:49:40] she's got faith she's crying out from
[2:49:42] the inside yes sir most importantly for
[2:49:44] salvation for salvation
[2:49:49] as a vindication
[2:49:52] that's the most important to know we're
[2:49:55] saved father this is our dear sister we
[2:50:00] call her that because we know she is yes
[2:50:03] she has we know Lord that you saw her
[2:50:06] before the foundation of the world
[2:50:09] you made a way of salvation for her
[2:50:14] and Lord I know that yes there there is
[2:50:18] always that resistance through the years
[2:50:22] because of religion to even accept with
[2:50:26] full Assurance what you have done for us
[2:50:29] and I'm asking you right now in the name
[2:50:33] of Jesus that this dear one would be
[2:50:36] able to receive what you have done at
[2:50:39] Calvary it's a finished work Lord and
[2:50:44] she would ask you for the full
[2:50:46] forgiveness of her sin I know that your
[2:50:50] bloody is
[2:51:04] would you come in Lord
[2:51:08] would you come in Lord
[2:51:11] now father
[2:51:13] you see the circumstances of her life
[2:51:17] [Music]
[2:51:18] see the unforgiveness
[2:51:21] that has harbored in her life
[2:51:24] it is not what she would want to carry
[2:51:26] oh no she would never want to carry that
[2:51:29] it's too heavy of a bird
[2:51:32] but Lord
[2:51:34] she's not somehow been able to roll that
[2:51:37] over on you
[2:51:38] so tonight I'm asking you right now to
[2:51:42] give her the grace
[2:51:44] to turn loose
[2:51:46] of the very root of unforgiveness
[2:51:50] for the things that she has suffered in
[2:51:52] life
[2:51:53] not related to her condition
[2:51:56] not not things not because she has
[2:51:59] fallen into this way that's not where
[2:52:02] the unforgiveness lies
[2:52:03] but Lord I ask you right now you see the
[2:52:07] wrongs that have been done to her
[2:52:09] you see o God how the enemy has tried
[2:52:12] even to raise up a root of bitterness
[2:52:15] because of it but our sister has come to
[2:52:18] you tonight believing that whatever
[2:52:21] stands between her and you we decree and
[2:52:25] declare that the blood of Jesus is more
[2:52:29] powerful than any roots
[2:52:32] that would try to take a hold of this
[2:52:35] Precious Child of God
[2:52:39] [Music]
[2:52:40] Lord you see the anger
[2:52:43] that generational
[2:52:46] that has
[2:52:47] really been like a cloak around her
[2:52:52] shoulders but tonight she would desire
[2:52:56] to be free from that
[2:53:00] and I don't mean frustration we all get
[2:53:02] frustrated we all get disappointed
[2:53:06] but oh God you see the route
[2:53:11] foreign Lord you see the untimely deaths
[2:53:15] around her family
[2:53:21] [Music]
[2:53:22] yes Lord
[2:53:24] Hallelujah
[2:53:26] Lord I see one two three
[2:53:31] Lord I'm asking you right now to walk
[2:53:33] her through
[2:53:35] yes Lord
[2:53:38] thank you we cut the root of it in the
[2:53:41] name of Jesus
[2:54:00] in the authority of Jesus Christ I loose
[2:54:04] you
[2:54:05] from the very root of those things
[2:54:08] yeah
[2:54:13] lift it off Lord even now yes lift it
[2:54:17] off even now
[2:54:21] you are indeed the same
[2:54:28] you see that which has been stolen from
[2:54:30] her
[2:54:33] you see those who have enjoyed
[2:54:36] lived off of the things that were stolen
[2:54:39] from her life
[2:54:42] May forgiveness flow out of her tonight
[2:54:48] may she be able to
[2:54:50] turn that loose
[2:55:00] Lord you see the loss
[2:55:03] you see the grief and the loss
[2:55:18] you see the time that she cried
[2:55:21] let's go
[2:55:23] over an empty little cradle
[2:55:28] her heart broken
[2:55:31] for what had been stolen from her
[2:55:35] but God I thank you that you're the God
[2:55:37] yeah
[2:55:46] Lord I ask you to let her be the
[2:55:48] solitaire
[2:55:50] in her family because
[2:55:52] there are many many many relatives
[2:55:57] who need salvation who need difference
[2:56:04] preserved her life
[2:56:07] and she's here Lord in this life for a
[2:56:10] reason yet today
[2:56:13] it's even been a mystery to some how she
[2:56:16] has still
[2:56:18] lived
[2:56:20] in spite of what the enemy would have
[2:56:22] desired to do so I'm asking you Lord to
[2:56:26] redeem her testimony
[2:56:28] among all those who love her and who
[2:56:32] care for her
[2:56:33] whose lives are a monk
[2:56:36] and a mess
[2:56:38] and I'm asking you to use her life Lord
[2:56:42] For Your Glory
[2:56:45] may she be a doorway of salvation for
[2:56:48] others may they see what you're doing in
[2:56:51] her life
[2:56:58] does any of that make sense to you
[2:57:00] sister
