been a long week Hallelujah but he is worthy he is worthy Hallelujah hallelujah we're going to go to the Lord in prayer this morning I know there are many needs represented in the house today and on the stream let's remember each one at his dad's church brother Greeley seniors having good days and some not so good days with his knee but he is in church today so we want to ask the Lord to undertake for him would you remember Sister Ethel in the UK they stream our services and have for some time now she has a daughter with a desperate need and a son with a desperate need and I'd like for them to be lifted up Sister hammock is struggling with a cough since camp meeting and needs to be remembered to the Lord in prayer and Mimi texted the sister Alita to say that she is also fighting a cough and I know there are some here also that are fighting a cough sister Flo had some symptoms yesterday and she is in the emergency room waiting for a room to be observed but her heart is good and they're not sure exactly what's wrong with her but we're praying and believing that everything is all right and the hospitals are full they don't have beds because of the flu and different things that are attacking people right now so we want to pray about that Ian was at the emergency clinic this morning with some sort of reaction they're giving him medication for that and Tiffany sent pictures of Elisha this morning where he is completely broke out uh from what they're saying could be a reaction to Amoxicillin but he was on it for a week I think before this broke out but it looks it looks miserable and so we want to hold him up to the Lord in prayer as well as those who are traveling that God will undertake for them and we have unspoken needs before the Lord I'd like for you to pray for our meetings in North Carolina next weekend that God will show up in a mighty and profound way there are though others traveling this week Ben and Zach are going to be away hunting and we'd like for them to be covered in prayer and God undertake for them Joshua is away this weekend hunting this week I'd like for the Lord to touch him as well yes amen many many needs let's go to Lord

presence it's already been with us this morning Lord we're grateful for what has been accomplished Among Us recently Lord and we know that today the enemy is Raging because of the accomplishments and the advancements that were made in the spirit and in the natural but Lord we're just claiming your power and your glory this morning we're claiming your healing touch for every sick body that's Among Us father we ask that you would just come in and remove that from Among Us this morning father would you touch everyone go and be with sister Flo Lord Lord and be with those that surround her Lord the emergency room will never be the same once sister Flo leaves that place I pray that you that your spirit in her would reach out to others that surround her God that you would raise people up off their sick beds in that hospital be with Ian as he had to go to the emergency clinic today father would you touch him in his body little Elisha would you touch him Lord father so many are in such need of

come on now [Music] it's not good [Music] Lord I believe [Music] foreign [Music] Lord I believe will you give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning Jesus [Applause] praise the Lord you may be seated it's very tinty I don't know what's happened to the settings but it sounds like an it sounds very aluminum testing one two testing one two Hallelujah You Know The Enemy is mad but he is defeated I don't want to give him much attention we have two brand new microphones top of the line and haven't been able to use them since we bought them this this uh the sound here is terrible this morning it's not it's not Luke's fault it's just things are just kind of out of whack and out of sort but we can pull it back together by the grace of God do without mics if we have to but it sure is frustrating we just need someone with a burden and a vision to help us to get it taken care of but I know God he knows how to do it and we're going to have to send these back I think because just when they get them working again then they they mess up again and you know they're not supposed to do that something's not right would somebody agree with me something's not right you don't spend that kind of money on something and then just let it sit on the shelf and not work for us so we're going to do what we can and believe that God will help us but you know there is victory in my heart you pressed in this morning and Worship the Lord and I know some of you aren't feeling well in body but you worshiped anyway and uh you know that's the only way to get above your circumstances the only way to get above what you're going through right now is to just keep pressing in to him and uh he shifts the atmosphere around us and I'm so thankful for that uh it has been a long week I've had many people reach out to me to say that it's one of the longest weeks of their life after being in church every night and then going a whole week I'm not regretting the decision though because we have seen at least some decline in new cases of flus and strips and whatever else is going around but there are many that have a lingering cough I want that to go I want the Lord to release that and let them have the victory over that if you have ever dealt with one of those lingering hard coughs you know that it's a very difficult thing to deal with and I'd like to see the Lord help each one of them and we want to make sure that we are covering the body in proper prayer because you have you come through a set of meetings like we just had we're vulnerable in the spirit and so you can't you can't stop when the meetings are done you've got to pray more to keep that prayer covering around all of us and we get slack sometime because we get tired or we are on a spiritual high and we forget that the enemy he's not just going to lay down and play dead while we take grounds he's we're going to have to fight for every inch of ground let's wake up to be away we're gonna have to fight for every inch of ground that we take in this hour I read again yesterday where brother random said this is not a picnic this is a Battlefield and I'm so I don't know what we do without prayer what would we do without prayer and uh you know I think some people have never after all the years of preaching and prayer and trying to model it for you I think some people still don't understand that prayer is not just what you do in an emergency when you've got a big need prayer is what you do to maintain what victory you have you got to keep what ground you got and uh you know prayer is not always a give me list either it sometimes it's it's thanking God that's prayer it's praising him for the victories that he has won and sometimes it's just saying Lord help me get through this I've got I've got to get through this with my testimony intact how many of you care about your testimony I care about my testimony and I want to make it with the victory there are people everywhere if I I just cut off the prayer requests because there's so many continue to remember the little uh McGrady baby that God will undertake they're taking some ground he has improved and Mom and Daddy both have got to hold him and uh it's a long journey to get to get to where they need to go but their surgeries ahead and all kinds but you know they didn't they didn't really think he was going to make it and God has sustained them and given them Grace then the his brother's baby was in the hospital in awful shape but God has moved there and then his grandmother this week Sister Janet Rourke a precious very precious friend of ours for over 30 years it has ended up in the hospital and she is facing the age-related issues but it looked like it was kind of becoming a little more acute and she is in the hospital for observe Invasion but we want the Lord to to move for her she's just a real child of God an accordion playing faith-speaking woman of God and I would like to see the Lord just really touch her in this hour We're believing that God will do that also brother Mike altick I don't know if any of you know who that is or not but a pastor in this message and one who travels around quite a bit as a teacher with his wife was in a terrible car accident over the weekend and he was in intensive care with brain bleed and it's a very serious problems I I did not hear this morning anything to know if there has been more Improvement his wife I think has been released from the hospital uh they were on their way to meet with the family in their Church who had lost a loved one and they were planning the funeral when this car accident took place and so we want the Lord to move for him uh he stands in desperate need of prayer God is a is a prayer answering God and uh so again there's a lot of traveling going on this week and there are still lingering symptoms we want victory over all of those and uh we're going to be preaching next Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning in Morganton North Carolina now I've never been to this church but I've known brother Danny and sister Lisa Adams for over 30 years and this is a mission church and it was initially my understanding and Assembly of God Church and they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the people are growing and uh brother Danny and sister Lisa are preaching Jesus to those who come and folks are getting saved and Friday night is going to be dedicated to the young people and then lunch on Sunday and some of the folks here traveling there and that always blesses me but it also puts me in a pool because I want there to be an amazing service here next Sunday I don't want I don't want it to suffer in any way I know that God will show up here and uh but it doesn't happen often that we're like this but we just felt like it was a good opportunity to go and and minister to some folks there are some other churches that have promised to support that meeting so will you just show me a commitment of Prayer by just holding your hand up and just letting me know that you commit to praying for those meetings that God will move and that he will Undertake and I like to see Souls saved and I believe that God is on the Move we won't take time this morning for testimonies some of which could not be told but God has moved during the camp meeting in a profound way and lives were touched and and people encountered the Lord and I'll just mention one and that that is Sister Rebecca's nephew there who the Lord touched in one of the services and I just wanted to encourage him last Sunday and I said I want you to know I believe what God did for you was real he said I know it was I know it was real and the look on his face was so uh it's so uplifting and so encouraging to know that he had had an encounter with God he had a supernatural experience where he felt something pulling in his inner being between us in prayer and I believe God's going to do some wonderful things in his life now a lot of sister Rebecca's family went home and were sick paid an awful price went through all kinds of stuff this week animal sick all kinds of problems but pressing in and uh well it brings out sometimes these kind of problems brings out faith in in us that we didn't know we had we've seen that happen we want to give God praise for that so we have so much to be thankful for in the midst of a lot of heartache and a lot of problems around us we have so much to be thankful for and we want to see what the Lord will say to us in his word I want you to stay awake and it's going to say that just as clearly as I know how this morning give me that would you and get you some water splash your face pitch yourself do anything that you need to do this is not a place for a nap this is where we're going to get what we need to get us through the rest of the week today was brother branham's wedding anniversary with sister Mita and we can't help but thank God for the sacrifice that she made to help keep brother Branham healthy and whole and and emotionally stable so that he could go out and do the work that God had called him to do tomorrow is the anniversary of the of the spoken word calming the storm and he's still God the spoken word is still right God's word still stops storms if you believe that's amen sister Royale is feeling some better sister Weems we want to continue to hold them up to the Lord in prayer and Tuesday is sister royale's birthday so whatever you can do to let her know to reach out to her in some way and wish her a happy birthday I think that would be amazing a Thursday is Josiah's birthday so we'll go ahead and say happy birthday to you in case we should forget between now and then just out of curiosity how old are you going to be on Thursday 27 well that's wonderful anything under 30 these days is amazing I'm told so praise God for that and then on Saturday is Olivia ellsworth's birthday so we want to wish her a happy birthday in advance then on the 31st of this month I won't be here we'll be traveling but that is Megan yovich's birthday and our precious sister prechner in Germany so we want to go ahead and wish them a happy birthday in advance and let them all know that we love them and appreciate them I think that's all [Applause] I could sing but then I would have to cut my preaching down to less than two hours so I won't do that we'll we'll go right to the word this morning are you ready let's stand and go to the word of God and let's see what the Lord will do for us today I feel like he wants to talk to us so I want to have an ear to hear we greet every one of you who are streaming the service uh thank you for those of you who are letting us know where you are we particularly send greetings to the precious Saints in Boston God bless you all thank you for streaming our service today many precious friends are represented here and unless you tell us where you're from we don't have any way of knowing where you're from but we're very glad that you are there we've had a lot of comments on the camp meeting Services those who streamed the services and if we were ashamed of the way that we worshiped we wouldn't have put it out on the internet we would have kept it hidden but uh we're not ashamed so just just know that we're not ashamed in fact we say what David's saying if God will give us strength there will be Valor wilder than that the next time as long as it's for him uh as long as no one is trying to see just how weird they can get to be weird but if you're doing it it's unto the Lord you just go right ahead and give him praise because he's worthy of Praise how many of you believe brother Greeley did one of the most outstanding jobs of his ministry here let's thank the Lord for God using him powerful Exodus 33 and thank you for the adjustments that you all made it's much better I don't see Luke now but let him know he was working hard and maybe others helped him and it's always a lot of pressure put on somebody like that and I did not in any way mean to insinuate that he wasn't doing his best uh I knew that something had shifted that he didn't have anything to do with it appeared but it is much better up here now thank you Exodus chapter 33 beginning in verse 10. I want to read 10 and 11 and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door I want you to imagine a pillar this is a pillar this is a faux pillar it's not holding up anything but a pillar is elongated like this so I want you to picture the cloud as a as a cloudy pillar or a pillar of cloud I don't want you to see it just as a fluffy Cloud that floated over the children of Israel it was a pillar of Fire it was a pillar of cloud so so that helps you get a little bit of an idea uh it wasn't like ordinary fluffy clouds in the sky it wasn't like an ordinary campfire but it had an unusual shape to it and and hung in an unusual way much like we see the pillar of fire hanging over brother branham's head and uh elongated fire and elongated Cloud all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door I can just see it in my mind's eye and all the people did what they rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses somebody tell me how he spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend that there's no mystical uh I think God is saying I I hope God is saying I I feel like God is saying No Moses had a face-to-face encounter with the Living God as two friends would sit together and and well communicate their thoughts and intentions to one another God was communicating with Moses in a way that did not require discernment or interpretation of what was being said it was face to face and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of noon a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle let's read that verse again and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of noon a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle when God and Moses had finished their conversation Moses turned from the Tabernacle and made his way into the camp but Joshua decided to linger in the presence that had just appeared now it's powerful lingering in the presence of God this is how we develop and cultivate intimacy with God there can be no Union without intimacy we're not acquaintances of God we're called to be much more than that we're called to be more than friends we're called to be one with him which happens to us by the spirit and I think it's important to notice that Joshua was the last to leave the Tabernacle and Joshua was the first one to inherit the promised land so there must be some connection between cultivating and Desiring to linger in the presence of the Lord and in intimacy with the Living God and being able to go in and take the possession so I like that and I want to practice that in my own life how about you now verse 12 through 15 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom thou Wilt sin with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy ways thy way if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight oh it's powerful prayer and consider that this nation is thy and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest this is a great promise and he said unto him Moses saying to God if thy presence go not with me I don't want to go I don't want to go anywhere up hence paraphrased I'm not going if your presence is not going with us I have no desire to go how many of you can understand that may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated God bless you my precious brother in Uganda thank you for streaming with us of Moses he had that kind of relationship with God Moses told God that he did not know the angel that wanted that God wanted to sin to lead them on the way if you're just going to send an angel to lead us um I'm not interested I want you I want to go with you I want to go where you're going and wherever I go I want to know you've gone before me I appreciate the angel I appreciate all that you have promised but I don't have any interest in the job unless I can know that your presence is going to be with us every step of the way how many of you understand that I mean do you really understand that without God's presence in your marriage it's ruined without God's presence in your career it's ruined without God's presence God's presence in your home and in your family is ruined it's not what it should be it's not what it could be it's not what it must be without the presence of God he said Lord I appreciate that you know my name and I appreciate that I have found Grace in your sight but either you go with us or leave us right here we would rather die here with you than to progress without you too many of us have ventured without Authority and we have assumed to go when God wasn't going with us Amen brother too many of us have got up to do something to accomplish something to choose something to make something happen and we have not realized that God wasn't in the arrangements he doesn't want to be consulted in the afterwards he wants to be consulted in the beginning leadership is not I'm sending you leadership is I'm going to lead you there and you follow me so it's imperative in this hour that we are able to discern where the presence of God is going because wherever the presence of God is going I want to go in whatever I want to move a move God is moving on a particular kind of service that's the kind of service I want to be a part of if the presence of the Lord is moving on a certain group of people I want to be with those people I do I want to be where God's moving can he move all over the world he is moving anywhere people will let him move he is moving but it's too late in the day to sit somewhere where God's not moving he's a breathing God a living God a talking God a walking God he's a god of Life he's a god of action he's a god of movements and wherever the spirit is moving that's where we want to move however God's moving we want to move in that direction we don't want to venture to go without him we don't want to assume to stay behind him but we want to stay up with him in this hour very very important it's the most important thing in your life the most important thing in your life is your relationship with that presence that's him that's not that's not we we don't have the presence of God and God the presence is God in the room God in your life so wherever the presence of God is that's where God is and I want to be there you know he is is crying out to God and he he's saying I Want To Know Thy way I want to understand the way you're moving now I want to understand the way you're leading and I want to understand the direction that you're going in and then he said that I may Know Thee I don't know about you but I'm getting the same impression from Moses that I got from the Apostle Paul when he was crying out to know the Lord that neither of our Brethren were asking for more head knowledge it doesn't seem to me that either Moses or the Apostle Paul were asking for more education or more information it seems like they were asking for something much more personal much more intimate in nature you can learn a lot about God but that doesn't mean you know who he is doesn't mean you know his way there's only one way to know the way of God are you with me there's only one way to know the way of God and that's to examine how God has moved before us because how he has moved before is how he's moving now he's the same yesterday and today and forever if God ever did it one way one time he's bound to do it again that doesn't mean he's stuck in some kind of mold that man has made for him it means that you can learn a lot about God by examining where he has been what he has done there's a lot to be learned in when we study Revival history and when we study the way that God has dealt with the prophets before us when we study the way that God is moved with the church before now through the church ages we learn a lot about God but we don't want to just know about him Revelation is not head knowledge Revelation is experiential when we have a revelation of God it means we have experienced a truth in God we have touched it it has touched us it has become a part of who we are Did You Know The Enemy can take a lot of ideas out of your head but he can't move your Revelation because your Revelation is not an idea it's something that the very spiritual fibers of your makeup have fellowshipped with until you have become a part of truth and truth has become a part of you that's why we will not be moved I want you to tell the enemy today I will not be moved by the huff and the puff and the blow and the threat not of the enemy if I'm going to move I'm gonna move because God is moving if I'm going to progress I'm going to progress because God is progressing if I stand still I'm Gonna Stand still because God is standing still we have to make up our minds and we have to make a dedication and we have to make a commitment and sometimes we have to remind the enemy sometimes we have to remind ourselves I won't be moved Hallelujah if the mountain bows down into the sea if the valley is exalted if my body should be racked with pain if I suffer grief or loss I will not be moved I'll stand on that word I hope you're listening to me I hope you're really getting it something's coming oh yes and you're going to want to know that you are unmovable without him you're standing on that word and the only thing is going to move you is the spirit the spirit is never going to move you off the word the spirit's always going to lead you to the word the word is not a printed page the word is a living reality the word is not a CD the word is not an app these are all manifestations of the word they are ways that we can access the word but the word is a living reality the word is a person and he walks with me and he talks with me and it tells me that I'm his own you know Moses talked to God face to face and Joshua said this moment is too good to turn loose of it Moses was the one receiving the encounter but Joshua said I think I'll just linger here in the residual of of the encounter that Moses had I think I'll just save her how this atmosphere is charged with the very presence of a living God I think I'll just linger here in this place of intimacy and Oneness this knowing the Bible said that Joseph was espoused unto Mary but as of yet she had known no man that word known is the same knowledge that the Apostle Paul is asking for in the New Testament that I may that I may know him would you give me Philippians 3 verses 8 through 10. in the Amplified Bible it'll take us a minute to read all that but let's do it he said he yes furthermore I'd count everything as loss compared to the possession of the Priceless privilege oh the overwhelming preciousness they're surpassing worth and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord this is not a mere introduction this is not a mere acquaintance but Paul is using the same word that is used in the New Testament for intimacy when when the scripture said she has yet knew no man it means that she had not given herself in a physical or we we might just be plain and say sexual way she was a virgin and a young maid who had kept herself pure unto God she had never exposed herself or given herself to a man in that way why would Paul use the same language that I may know him that I may be into in it intimately acquainted with him [Music] that I may be naked before him that there being nothing separating me from Christ are you with me he sees everything there is to see about me because I have presented myself Paul is saying oh that I may present myself to Christ not holding anything back but allowing him to see my weakness and my strength my my victory and my vulnerability oh that I may that he may know my words and that I may also surrender to him my thoughts that that he might read my mind and read my thoughts and know what I really am and who I really am May there be nothing between us no clothing no Veil to separate us may nothing separate us from Christ oh that I may know him that I may that I may receive the possession of the Priceless privilege the overwhelming preciousness the surpassing worth and the Supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord are you with me and of progressively becoming oh this is the growth this is the abiding in the Vine This is not getting to Christ this is staying with Christ This is not getting to the word this is fellowshipping the word this is communing with the word this is to progressively becoming more deeply and not not surface intimacy not not not surface oh my what a what an hour we live in we are allowed five thousand friends on Facebook five thousand friends I have 4980 something friends and about 1800 invitations to be friends and if I were to be in trouble and I needed to call someone [Music] how many of those 4 800 4987 friends would I be able to call on who would come to my rescue how many of them would attend my funeral how many would come to the hospital to pray for my children if they were sick do you understand I'm not talking about you know knowing someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who suggested I I follow you on Facebook I don't even like the word followers I'm getting sick of the word influencers and I'm getting sick of the word followers and I'm following so and so and I'm following so and so and I'm following so and so where are they going where are they leading us how important is it really to follow I'm not talking about will you friend me will you follow me will your heart my comment will you heart my picture will you get mad at me and unhart my picture don't don't don't act like we don't think like this do you know who followed me this week you know all we're guilty I said to my wife yesterday by Jason Crabb liked my comment that makes us feel good He Knows My Name how much do you think that means less than a quarter because if I got in trouble and Jason Crabb wouldn't come to my rescue all right then he's not the kind of friend I'm talking about here when you say I'll be a friend to Jesus you sing the old hymn I'll be a friend to Jesus when you talk about knowing him and following him and loving him I'm not talking about thumbs up thumbs down Harding liking following influencing I'm not talking about anything like that I'm talking about becoming progressively more deeply and intimately acquainted with him I wanna know what causes his heart to beat fast I want to know what causes his heartbeat to slow down I want to know what he loves because I want to love what he loves I want to know what he hates because I wanna hate what he hates I want to know him in in the most intimate non-presuming assuming way where the rubber meets the road where reality is bright and big and in your face let me read it again furthermore I count everything as law everything is lost compared to the possession of the Priceless privilege the overwhelming preciousness the surpassing worth and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of progressingly becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with him of perceiving and recognizing and understanding him more fully and what go back charity let's read that phrase again of perceiving I is God in that is God doing that we sovereignty people we people who believe in election predestination and God choosing we who believe in the Supreme and extreme sovereignty of God I'm one of them I'm one of them I I'm one of them I'm one of them who believes that I cannot die foreign that's extreme that's Supreme sovereignty and yet I want to balance in my life it doesn't mean that I can eat all the fried chicken I want to and it's not going to affect my body it doesn't mean that my health is not something to consider because I can't die without him telling me I'm going to die oh don't get quiet you know it it's like saying well I know I'm chosen so I can continue to drink myself drunk we know what brother Brandon said about these things but but none of us want to test these theories we don't we don't want to we don't want to harm ourselves and have to live with any less quality of life because we didn't value what God valued so it's a balance help me we're balancing life we have a tendency sometime to because we believe in the sovereignty of God to feel that we have no responsibility whatsoever with the ABS and flows of life with the upswings and the downturns of life but that is incorrect because we are not only living out our purpose in God but we are existing based on decisions that we make along the way we are dealing with the consequences of decisions that we have made on whims assuming that to go forward is always the right direction but that's not Moses Moses said God you've brought us a mighty long way I'm so thankful that you want to send an angel with us but I don't even know this angel's name I am thank you that you want to send an angel with us but I'm not in this thing for an angel if you want me to go I have to know that you are going with me I love the boldness and the tenacity of Moses I love of the fact that he just said no sir with all due respect if you don't go with us I'm staying right here I'd rather die here with you than to go forward without you some of us went forward without him some of us stayed behind when he went on some of us like his parents we were so carried up in the excitement of the moment that we went on ahead and didn't realize that Jesus had stayed behind in the temple talking to the doctors and the scribes so we wake up one day and we realize what am I doing over here and how did I get here without Jesus and then you let a preacher come and make us take a second look at things and bring a little reality in our lives and the first thing that we think about doing is justifying ourselves and feeling that we really have no blame because God is Sovereign I want you to understand that this is not intimately knowing him it's not having relationship with him that he's after if if you only relate to God as a denominational Christian you are never going to overcome in this world we live in today the spirit of denominationalism has invaded our ranks it has tainted our churches it has affected the way we do and the way we don't do and even when I say we I mean those of us who Fellowship around the message that that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and those of us who Fellowship around the ministry of brother Branham our our churches our families our way of doing business our festivals our Banquets our [Applause] everything that we do we must examine it is God in this before I would give a an approval for a youth banquet I wanted to know is God in this I didn't want to do it because the other churches were doing it that is not enough for me I'm not trying to be super spiritual I'm trying to be sincere here that's not enough for me you know and and and when even when my favorite preacher one of my favorite preachers backtracked last year and you know sort of apologized for his stand on Christmas because I'm not following him I'm following the word so that didn't move me greatly disappointed me but it didn't change my mind because I want to stay with the word no matter what the cost if if Even in our ranks our churches are influencing one another and we're not being led by the spirit of God in this hour then we're not becoming more progressively intimately acquainted with him we're just following him in the denominational mindset you know Happy Valley has a fall festival so we all need a fall festival that's not what I'm interested in if God's in it if there's something good to be gained out of it if the spirit will show up in it who doesn't like pumpkin pie but I'm not interested in it because everybody else is interested in it do you understand when I tell you that it's too late in the day to follow the trend whether it's social media whether it's denominational mindset you you see we can get noise in the denominational churches so it's not just noise we're after we're after praise and worship that gets the job done it's not just excitement that produces more of a denominational mindset that we're after we're looking to be delivered from the from the parameters and the and and then the the borders of the church ages because it's not enough to navigate laodicea will let that sink in a moment we are pursuing another age we are pursuing something greater than the seven Church ages we are pursuing a time that is bigger than time it is an eternal day one Eternal day where there is no night it's not like Ephesus and it's not like laodicea it's like something bigger than all of that brother Branham said my Ministry is to forerun [Music] what great quote that's not the one I'm looking for but it's powerful and it's true he said I have come to forerun the coming of the word my Ministry is to forerun the word if you follow along in the message he calls it the word in Bride form he calls it Christ in Bride form he calls it a coming of Christ in Bride form brother sister this is powerful to to think that the word is coming in Bride form to think that there is a coming of Christ in in Bride form it's bigger than anything in laodicea it's bigger than anything that's going on in the mission movements of the denominational systems it's it's so much more than that so if we desire to become progressively more deeply and intimately acquainted with him of perceiving is God in this well we have camp meeting every year is God in this well all the circumstances have lined up is God in this do you understand we've always have a youth meeting is God in this but this is the way we've always done it is God in this you know it's possible that God has been in it all along but right now it's possible that he says you do that you're on your own [Applause] because you see we're going to come to a time where we begin to realize that what God anointed in laodicea I'm just you know what I'm doing this morning I'm just testing the water I'm just seeing who's with me because I want to go somewhere but I'm not going by myself I want to know you're ready to go amen I mean that and what what better morning than one where we're already struggling with sickness already fighting some emotions with things going on and a lot of our congregation out so why don't we just jump in here for for a real experiment and let's see if anybody is really ready to see what God is going to put his Spirit on in these last days I tell you he's going to put his Spirit on individuals on individuals who desire to know him to be intimately acquainted with him to become progressively more deeply and intimately acquainted with him of perceiving this is God this is not God God has done that he's blessed that before but he's [Music] it reminds me of something sister Ruth said and she said we get in this rut in a Revival meeting maybe you can't receive this because a woman said it I can [Music] she said we get in this rut and we come to church and we sing a song and God falls on that song and so we come back the next service we sing the same song we hold our mouth the same way raise our hand the same way we try it like Papa used to say you know you're not you're not I'm not catching any fish Papa I'm not Captain anybody you're not holding your mouth the right way so all of us kids would go trying to determine which way to point our tongue so we could catch a fish how many of you know it didn't work that way so we're like that sometimes as Christians we come to church we want to hold our tongue the right way we think we sing the same song I came to the front the last song so I better go the front this time I I I waved a purple pink polka dotted Banner the last time and God really blessed that so I better wave the same Banner oh I had all my black shoes last time better go change don't tell me don't tell me don't tell me that we sometimes subconsciously operate like this this is a church age mentality this is laodicea we're not moving in that realm we're coming higher into a closer relationship with the word and we've got to be ready we've we've had some hard transitions in the past we used to have sunrise services and I remember when I said we're not going to have sunrise services anymore every person that was ever touched in a sunrise service grieved grieved you don't have to be in a sunrise service to be touched you got saved in a sunrise service praise God for that you don't have to wait till you get in a sunrise service to get the Holy Ghost you know I think God sometimes just comes in and likes to throw us all out of the nest and change things up and see who's ready to fly and who's ready to die come on and so we have to pull everybody through that transition of not having a sunrise service and so many times through the years to introduce any kind of change become so difficult for those of us who don't like change and that's all of us yeah I'm not listening to what you're saying I'm I'm remembering how we operate and none of us really like change but I want you to understand A change is coming I want you to know that A change is coming I want you to know that A change is coming I want you to understand that A change is coming and and if you if you're too attached or if you think God can't move unless you sing a certain song come on or we can't have Fellowship unless we do it on the volleyball court it's so easy to miss or we can't have camp meeting without a guest speaker we don't want to be attached to anything so deeply so dearly that if God said I'm not moving on that anymore we can't turn it loose oh God help me I want to turn it loose I do I want to turn it loose I want to turn it loose what if what if the spirit of the Lord were to say I want you to have Tuesday Wednesday Thursday night service [Music] I know we would do it and I know most of us would be here but some would come gritting their teeth America I'm here it's not compliance I'm going to tell you something some of you are going to have a bigger shake-up than others because some of you aren't doing so well in this season I'm not sure where you're going to be in the next one because if you've not done well with the stretching of this last season I'm not so sure that you'll quickly embrace the stretching of the next season but I'm telling you change is imminent it's here and God's going to show himself powerful and he's going to show himself strong and he's going to show himself Mighty and he's going to find the people who follow the cloud the pillar the pillar of cloud cloudy pillar and those who will follow the fiery pillar and those who follow the moving of the spirit and those who will just get bold in their relationship with God and say with all due respect sir if you're not going with me I refuse to go can't go without you hey God says yes you can so then you have to get even more real than that and you say Okay I can but I don't want to I only want to move when you're moving I only want to adapt to what you're changing I won't only want to embrace what you're put are you with me what you're putting your spirit on no matter what it looks like you see I gotta go on perceiving knowing knowing if this is God in the room are not God you know I don't care folks I don't care if we've never seen it before I want to know if God's in it God's in it I don't have to have ever seen it before my knowing is limited my experience is limited and I feel like I've seen about everything but but if if he shows up and is doing something in a way and moving in a way that I I'm not accustomed to I want to perceive immediately this is God and you better get with it or get out of the way you better follow it or move over because as we sung recently the world has seen the last of the meek and lowly Jesus you know this is what's so ridiculous about the the world and the church world today is they're trying to introduce on a yearly basis the world to A Jesus who never who does not exist anymore so what do you mean he doesn't exist anymore he is no longer a baby in a Manger he will never be a baby in a Manger again he is not blessed or pleased or excited or thrilled by you putting him in a Manger every year the church is doing it but he God wants nothing to do with it pointing people back to what I was I don't want you pointing people back to my first coming I want them to be able to recognize me when I come the next time and the next time I'm not coming like a little only baby in the manger I'm coming as king of kings and Lord of lords I'm coming to rule the nations with a rod of iron I'm coming to set up a kingdom that shall never ever cease to exist I'm coming to occupy the Throne of King David the Eternal Throne the one that will never pass away I'm coming to take my place but the world just wants to bring people back to the warm and fuzzies it is right warm and fuzzies Courier and Ives in the meadow we can build a snowman and pretend that he is Parson Brown and if he says are you married we'll say no sir but you can do the job when you're in town he's not coming in warm and fuzzy he's not coming in a courier and Ives Christmas card he's not coming that way the next time he comes he's coming as king of kings and Lord of lords they don't want you to spend so much time looking for the next coming that you miss this coming because folks this coming right now this coming is the most important coming for the bride this he's coming in the fullness of his word he's coming in Bride form he's coming to reflect himself in US and so whatever it takes to become more uh deeply and intimately acquainted with him of perceiving and recognizing and understanding we're moving on perceiving and recognizing and understanding him what more fully and what clearly for his sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be rubbish refuse dreads King James says done let me come over here and say that the Apostle is saying it's all just poop don't forget I said it it means nothing yeah it comes it goes I pass it I flush it I know I know I know I know it's playing I get it but that's what he said it's done thank you Amplified it's refuse it's it's garbage it's a Kleenex that you blowed your nose in and you throw it in the trash can but I I like the King James he's just saying it has no real value everything I had everything I owned everything I've achieved all my successes all my trophies all my accolades my successful home my successful business my successful family none of it matters it's all just garbage I'm willing to lose it all again and again and again like Lanny Wolfe wrote Whatever It Takes I'll trade Sunshine for rain sickness for pain so don't complain about the flu come on take the dearest things to me if that's how it must be I want to place my whole life in your hands that I may win gain Christ that I may have him that I may live in him that I may breathe in him that I may move in him nothing else matters we say it often nothing else matters but we don't live like nothing else matters come on I'm not I'm not condemning anybody I said we we don't live like nothing else matters you just let something happen to our Thanksgiving plans and see if Christ is all that matters you just let somebody forget our birthday and see if Christ is all that matters come on folks you just see if we don't get the shift we want if Christ is all that matters it's it's it's not enough to say it we're going to have to come to a place where we mean it to have him to have his favor to have his pleasure to know that I've done something to know that I've said something that pleased him you think how tragic it is and painful it is to recognize that we have disappointed him and then you think about how joyous it is how strengthening it is to know I'm pleased and so when you look after a week of meetings like we've had and people are sick and children are vomiting on the glass doors and strep is running rampant and we get the call that says the you know the last child that was on my leg has strep and flew and I haven't even started preaching yet all these things that come up the lingering costs the allergic reactions to antibiotics all the things that happened when the enemy's mad we have to come to a place where we realize that every bit of that junk is worth it yeah to know that we've said something that we've done something to see the look on sister Claudia's face Tuesday night was a week ago as God came and drove something out of her life and gave her a piece that she said was was a unprecedented don't you think that's worth all the weak of hell that you have to go through sometime well y'all better be more worth it if it was me that got it you've got to come to a place where it means as much for God to help somebody else to help somebody else's children oh God just help somebody's loved one [Applause] we've got to come to the place where we can celebrate somebody else's promotion [Applause] like I often mention about sister Heather and brother Dwayne and how they celebrated several times I reached out to them because I knew that their hearts were aching and their arms felt empty they wanted a baby and I knew I knew some situations I'd been involved in some situations where relatives of little babies born in their family wouldn't even hold the baby because they wanted one of their own so they wouldn't hold the little nephew or the little niece and I'm thinking oh my goodness how bitter how bitter how painfully bitter that is oh you can never posture I feel something stirring in me uh you could never posture yourself for the favor of God by mistreating somebody's child because you long for one of your own does that make sense in anybody's world oh my and yet I would see Heather she would buy the nicest gift first one to congratulate and anybody else it was believing for a long time for children she would find some little crafty creative way a little plaque or a little saying or a little gift to encourage somebody to keep believing and it impressed me more than once until I had to reach out and say oh this is the right posture God this pleases God if we can celebrate for somebody else if we can stand in agreement with somebody else we position ourselves to receive even more from the Lord if we can give an offering knowing that we need that money more than the one we're giving it to but we give it in the name of the Lord cup of cold water to a prophet in the name of a prophet if we can do that if we could bring ourselves to pay for somebody else's car wash when we need one worse ourselves when we can position ourselves like this we're learning the heartbeat of God not just a courtesy amen I want you to know what you're saying the more we draw close to him the more we lay our head on his chest you men are going to have to get over this this whole gender thing you could call me anything you want to call me you could consider in you could think anything you want to think about me but I'm the happiest when I know that I have placed my head on his chest and he has put his arm around my shoulder and Drew me to himself there's nothing gay about that there's nothing homosexual about that it's the life of a believer we have to get over this kind of a concept I want to become intimately acquainted with him and this is not something dirty it's not something vulgar it's to become so in tune so in Union so in Oneness with what he wants oh it's like you young people going back to volleyball you're out on the court and you said doesn't really matter how who wins just save your life don't lie it does matter to you I loved it when Saturday there were a lot of games going on and there were younger ones and there were girls and there were boys and there were good players and bad players and and the reports kept coming back and said you know what nobody just nobody was ill and nobody was nobody was agitated and it just didn't really matter and it was all kind of random and we just enjoyed one another's company that was Saturday and then Sunday comes I've prayed all week I've asked the Lord for a solution because I'm done with being embarrassed by Young people's behavior and young married couples Behavior on the church parking lot something's wrong it's not what it's about I totally Embrace this concept if you're going to do anything you ought to do the best you can or stay out of the way I fully preach that Doctrine if you don't really want to play sit down see God told me he was going to use volleyball that's why we still have it he was going to use it for some folks he didn't tell me who he was going to use it for some folks if you don't want to play don't play if you're not going to give everything you've got to give don't play sit watch Twitter your thumbs If You're Gonna Play you ought to give it everything you've got and if you lose you're just lost [Music] you've got this sense of I did my best if you can't do that out there you won't do that in life [Music] there are too many people in this church that step over the piece of trash good morning you know the picture that goes around on social media of I I don't know how people live that close to each other but it's a duplex you know you can reach out your door and into somebody else's door that's pretty close there's a nice set of wide steps coming down and someone has meticulously cleared half the steps I'm telling you folks you may think that doesn't matter I'm telling you that matters to God sure it takes a little longer sure it takes longer and I I'll tell you what if you've got any kind of back or leg or sciatic issues stooping is not your favorite chore but no one should walk past a water bottle that's been discarded or a piece of trash that's been thrown around because there's someone else to come along and get it or because you think in your mind maybe someone is paid to pick that up not anybody I know around here if you will step over something like that you're the kind of person that won't give your best if you're that kind of person that would clear half the steps and then watch to see if the neighbor walks down your side of the steps I can assure you right now this is not to condemn it's to help you I believe in being on time for church I know there are circumstances that we can't help but there are also sometimes circumstances that we arrange help me the reason why I think it matters is because it carries over to the rest of our life if we constantly make excuses for our slackness it follows us through every aspect of our lives at some point we have to say I want to give all I want to get my best when you've done your best and you can't make it on time God knows that you don't know anybody an explanation only you know only you know if you saw the trash only you know only you know and no one is here to judge you I'm just saying these things matter and the more we discover of him and we spend more time laying our head on his chest I'm afraid we're going to be shocked because we're gonna find out the things that we didn't think he cared about he really did and we go he does so I encourage you don't be satisfied with Where You Are don't be satisfied with what you have I mean in him with him pursue more of God because there's more to be had pursue an intimate and deeper relationship that that you would be able to perceive him and understand him more fully and more clearly as you go along for his sake I've lost everything and considered all to be mere rubbish Refuge dregs in order that I may win gain Christ the anointed one if you lose you lose you can walk away knowing you did your best and that feels good if someone has cheated if someone has been unfair it blows my mind to think that God's children would want to cheat one another in anything I had a first cousin and I would be at this in fact strangely enough I dreamed about his mother last night I hadn't dreamed of her in a long time but I had her first cousin his name was Kenny Kenny if you're watching this it's the truth I hope you're no longer like this but he'd say to me Steve help you want some milk oh yeah well sure I yeah I guess I'll take some milk sure I'll have some milk and he would go to the refrigerator he would get two glasses he would pour milk in both of them and then he would lift them up to see which one was the fullest oh this is so close to home I'm preaching to this house we'll take my time now I was raised similar except my mother always said give the other person the one that's Fuller they'll notice it must be true because every time my cousin would cheat me out of a sip or two I noticed I never said a word I don't think I ever mentioned it to him sorry I don't know if I ever mentioned it to him or not but I knew in my mind that this was a flaw that would follow him the rest of his life unless he made a conscious decision I'm not going to be that person anymore what should he have done I wouldn't mind I didn't it didn't really matter a sip of milk is not a big to do but if he wanted to be a fair and equal person he would have taken them and [Music] like parents have to do for their children you're standing here all day trying to get even so nobody feels bad come on somebody ought to corrected that boy his parents his grandparents somebody ought to say don't live your life less after a few extra sips of milk give it to somebody else it'll always come back to you give and it shall be given unto you press down shaken together and running over and men will give to your bosom don't be selfish so to me the concept that Believers could cheat one another whether it's I'm not going to say that in any way whether it's fun on the on the on the parking lot of whether it's in life it disturbs me greatly if you won fair and square and we have you all have I'm sure you have many times you can walk away knowing we won we outwitted we out smacked with the ball and not our tongues we just outperformed and we won and we can walk off with a strut because we won not rubbing into anybody else's face just just the personal pride of knowing we want but if you stack something or cheat something or take advantage of a particular situation or you don't take into consideration these kinds of things I don't know how you could live with yourself and it worries me I worry about people on their job I wonder how many staplers you have at your house that belong to your boss I wonder how many boxes of paper clips you took home with you Ben it's been been got any car parts laying around checking check him you don't want that kind of flaw operating in your life [Music] and the last thing you want to do is embarrass Christ you don't want to end a series of meetings like we had by embarrassing yourself the church in front of guests help me Pastor yes that's exactly why I'm here because I believe that the closer we get to Christ the least the less these other things matter that I may win him that I may have him we get so worked up in what other people think about us there's a cure for that you're never going to stop people from talking about you but you could quit doing so many dumb things tired of talking about you they talk about somebody else for a while you can't function better or worse because somebody's got something to say about you I heard a new one on us this week I heard that they're telling in some message churches around I use the term loosely that in order to dance in our church you have to go to some kind of organized dance class they pass that around I could give you names if you need them where people have literally passed that kind of stuff around and you know what when I got through laughing I thought wow because when you dance for the Lord you do it with such precision with such Amazing Grace and poise that somebody thinks you've been trained to do it now the secret is out it's a lie someone's figment of imagination someone misunderstood something from years ago and have posted and reposted and shared and re-shared and talked and I thought I am not going to be offended and I'm not going to be heard and I'm not going to try to track it down I'm just going to say my my the next time I dance foreign [Music] you've got to put your eyes on Jesus you need to know that somebody somewhere don't like you and I may know him you may know them this is not what life is about closer you get to the Lord the closer you become intimately acquainted with him the things that mattered so much they start slipping from you even habits and hobbies and pastimes and obsessions that mattered so much they start mattering less and less not because you're becoming more religious but because you're becoming more anointed oh and under that presence what else matters Moses said I thank you for the angel you promised to sin I thank you for all but I if I'm going you got to go with me let me read a few more verses here how many more am I supposed to read 9 and 10 and that I may actually be found and known as in him let me give you a carnal example people know who to tell the joke to people know who to make fun of somebody with don't they don't we we know the ones that will find it funny and the ones who won't we know the ones who'll find it borderline we know the ones who will remind us maybe that's not the best thing to do and when I hear someone talking about somebody else being strange it makes me want to go to Hobby Lobby sister Anna can you hook me up at Hobby Lobby I need a mirror it makes me want to run with a mirror and say take a big long look at odd the body of Christ is unique weird is actually a witchcraft word so I try my best to be careful with that word but we are strangers we are pilgrims we should never try to see how strange we can be or what we can be against some people want to be known for what they're against it's much more noble to be known for what you're for say Amen brother sister some people want to just see how you know otherworldly they can get and they feel so spiritual when they get sold if you could see my stomach turning when I'm around have to be around someone like that if there's one thing that makes me want to puke it's religion amen and do you know why because I was religious and when you've been religious it's so easy for you to recognize religion we don't want to see just how unlike everybody we can be and how different we weird we can be there's the word yes I got it so that people can say oh my he must really be getting close to the Lord you won't you won't have to do any of that you won't have to put on you won't have to go around with some mystical strange way about you when you've been with him you smell like him your words sound like him your life releases the essence of who he is it doesn't mean you can't have a good time it doesn't mean you can't laugh when something is funny but what it means is you're growing in him and it becomes contagious when I encounter someone who's behaving religiously it makes me want to be as unlike them as I possibly can be so when someone religiously tells me the error of a Dr Pepper I want to drink too that's my human nature so religion never draws anybody into a closer walk with him but the more you spin the more time you spend in his presence the more hungry you get for his presence the more you drink of his water the more thirsty you become for more of the same nothing thing else satisfies when you've drank from his well can anybody say Amen my what a strange service thank you I want him to be praised that I may actually be found and known as in him not having any self-achieved righteousness that can be called my own based on my obedience to the Law's demands ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired my Holiness is not found in the fact that I've never watched a particular movie my Holiness is found in my fellowship with him because wherever he hangs out he releases who he is and we just become holy we become like those who think purer thoughts and and and do purer things and you know when you have guile when you have jealousy when you have resentment when you have these issues you feel like everybody does what an Awakening when you find out that there are literally people that you go to church with who are not jealous you go I don't believe it everybody's jealous it blows our minds when we find out that someone has actually won that battle hey there's someone who actually doesn't care if you get a vacation they actually celebrate the fact that you got to vacate I got Bills running out my ears and guess what they're all yours you did it I did it I can't blame you for my bad decisions but when you get to the place where somebody else is blessed and you get blessed by their blessing your growing Church no guile no jealousy no resentment Mama someone drives on the parking lot with a new vehicle and you start figuring out how many bills you could have paid off of that money the problem is brother sister it wasn't yours so the answer zilch zero you couldn't have paid off any of your bills with it because it didn't belong to you you were pushing your vehicle onto the parking lot and someone comes by with a new one when you can Rejoice with them you're growing you're growing when you can take some time to figure out why do people act so awkward why do they feel the need to be so religious if you could spend all time in prayer and start asking the Lord what might I do to relieve some of that pressure you're growing there are easier people to hang out with than others if you can find yourself reaching out to those who don't smell as good as you do [Music] you're growing you didn't just get up one morning and decide to be a better person you're growing because you've been in his presence and like Joshua you said I know there's more business to tend to but just let me sit here let me stand here another five minutes and just soak brother Branham this week was talking about shittinwood and he said it was just a hollow sponge lighter than Balsam I think he was talking about I don't think it was Acacia I think it was shitty mood the the the Ark of the the Noah's Ark was made of chateemwood is that right and he said it's like boss it's it's it's lighter than Balsam am I saying that Rider is it Balsa you know the kind of wood that we used to make our little airplanes out of is that balsa wood or Balsam Balsa he said it's it's like a hollow sponge and he said this is how we need to be I almost preached on that this morning we need to be Hollow sponges we need to come into His presence press our way in no matter what let me tell you something there is a remedy for nausea presence there is a remedy for a headache Ashley you ought to know his presence Maribeth there's a remedy for all that stuff that you've been going through his presence you just push in when you want to die of course you can't always do it if you're contagious I get all that I understand all that but you're here you might as well make the best of it so you just come like a like a like a like a plow head you just come in and you start pushing I spoke to the musicians in the back and I said look this is not going to be an easy service we're gonna have to work harder than we've normally worked we've been out of church a week a lot of things have happened in a week but we can do this it's our responsibility but it's also our privilege to push to push everything out of the way [Music] come on I'm nearly done push everything out of the way fight until you can experience his presence and then when you do you lay there like a sponge like brother random said a hollow sponge and you just soak up the presence of the Lord Joshua was determined I just want to be right here soaking up the presence of God sister hope and brother Josh they had no business here last Sunday she was sick but feeling a little better I'm not we're not going to make it pastor I don't know how long but not much longer than that a text she's feeling a little better we're on our way somebody could get offended and say oh what what kind of germs were they spreading around or someone could say what a sponge what a sponge Lord [Music] I also not so that I can be religious but so that I can soak in a little more of your presence I want to pray a little longer I want to read a little longer I want to experience you a little longer because I want to know you yes there's too many people that know the message but have never become intimately acquainted with the message this truth has to drop from your head to your heart to your feet you have to learn to walk it out and that I may actually be found and known as in him not having any self-achieved righteousness that can be called my own based on my obedience to the Law's demands ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired like all of those people who would like to call us back to some restriction of Sabbath Sabbath is the most beautiful most beautiful weekly reminder that Yeshua that Jesus has come to bring us rest however you choose to commemorate it I strongly urge you to remember it if the only way you can do it is to greet someone peace of the Sabbath be upon you shabbat shalom almost every week Brother David Mann our sister Sandy shabbat shalom almost every week Jonathan sends him as shabbat shalom I'm not offended by that I'm encouraged by that because it reminds me that the Sabbath has become more than a 24-hour period of a week it has become a living reality he gets up with me on Sunday morning the same way he would linger with me on Saturday morning he gets up with me on Monday morning I have a rest that is bigger than the day of the week to despise what God used to point you to the truth is stupid but to idolize it's all so stupid it'd be like you driving your car over here in 250 runs into 379 and there's a stop sign there and it would be like you getting out of your vehicle and running circles around that stop sign screaming at the top of your lungs the last sign the last sign the last sign I'll be at church before you know it this is the last sign it's a sign hey folks and that's what I've seen so many people do around the message they've idolized brother Branham they've placed him on the pole instead of the brass serpents they've called his name more often than they've called The Name of Jesus Christ brother Brandon would be personally offended and broken by that kind of behavior he would be offended in a service that he got more a more uh you know popularity or notoriety than Jesus he came to introduce us to Christ he was a sign but he taught us emphatically that every sign has a voice and guess what the sign said stop so you should obey the sign count to ten Mississippi and get on to church and credit holding people up out there on 250 running around the stop sign it's the same way in life I'm not going to run around the Sabbath I'm not going to force people into some kind of remembrance but I'm going to encourage every one of you to remember that God gave a weekly reminder that a greater peace was coming a greater peace is coming oh it's been it's been beautiful for the Jewish people can you imagine being in Robbins Brook can you imagine being in in in in all of these horrible concentration camps where you could hardly remember the day of the week and someone is marking off the sunsets with a rock on the floor so that they can spend a few extra minutes holding hands and having a prayer as the Sabbath came in don't tell me that's not beautiful don't tell me it hasn't sustained God's people it's been a precious reminder but for me to try to force people into some kind then you are just absolutely looking for a ritualistic uprightness you're finding a supposed right standing with God by some kind of of performance instead of relationship religion is about performance relationship is about intimacy but possess anyone offended good but possessing that genuine righteousness which comes how through faith in Christ we look away to Christ we look away to Jesus we got our eyes off people now we're looking to Christ the word we've got our eyes off of our hacking and coughing and draining and and we're looking at Christ the word and he lifts us up we get our mind off of our pain lifted up Christ the word truly right standing with God which comes from God by Saving faith is that the last verse or was it one more ten for my determined purpose is this is not going to come automatically you're not going to know him automatically you're going to have to fight to know him not that he doesn't want to reveal himself you're just going to have to come up to where he is he'll come to where you are to save you but you'll have to come to where he is to have Fellowship who can Ascend the hill of the Lord but he that has a pure heart and Clean Hands and it's so easy it's so easy to get your hands washed it it's so easy to get your heart pure you just come to the word and you just realize that that it's not how clean you can get your hands it's not about that at all it's about understanding what he's done on your behalf which is really sort of the purpose of this message but we haven't gotten there just yet that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with him perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of his person Moses said I want to know your way Paul said something more powerful than that I want to know you I don't want to just know what you can do I don't want to just love you because of what you are capable of doing I Just Want to Love You Because of Who You Are you are God's Sovereign and supreme you're a God who in in my mind should have no desire or reason to have fellowship with me and yet it's a priority you desire to have fellowship with me the Apostle said that I may become intimately acquainted with him perceiving recognizing understanding the wonders of his person more strongly and more clearly and that I may in the same way come to know the power outflowing this is the anastasis this is the reproducible resurrection that comes in us every time we fellowship with him you're resetting your body you're resetting your physical being every time you come into fellowship with him his presence because the resurrection is is Flowing up and out of you and when it when when the resurrection flows up and out of us it changes Us in ways that we don't always perceive think about the glory of the times that God protected you some of you have been Disturbed this week of how this could happen to you or why it happened to you or why it happened one of the Brethren sitting at the table last Sunday said to me is this common among you that you have a good set of meetings and you all get sick yes well we don't put it on the schedule it's not like we judge the goodness of the meetings by how many people come night to death during the week but we expect some kickback we expected he can't stop it so he tries to destroy destroy from it and what do we do we Press On [Applause] you know I I had so much to be thankful for the hospitals are full we had many including children sister Sandy has a student in her school that was in intensive care sweet little boy with flu and pneumonia and the same thing that some have fought around here and he was in serious condition he's better now I I had a she sent a little picture he's better now but he was in serious condition with the very same thing that some of you were fighting and so here's what I think I say thank you Lord thank you what a horrible week for some people but but thank you Lord it could have been so much more serious what would we have thought or what would we have done or how would we responded if one of these little ones would have ended up in the emergency room or in the uh I mean in the and it started before camp meeting with the with the chemical burns so so what do we do well we we go through all the emotions before camp meeting started I was going through this mentality of your failure and you were not leading properly and you should have not allowed something like that to happen and when you get over that then there's something else to deal with but if we Press On we press on because we have one prize one goal One Vision in mind and that's not to grow a bigger Church it's to have him [Applause] oh that I might win him [Applause] so we're closing now musicians are coming this is the cry I wrote these notes this is the Cry of the remnant bride in this hour we want to know him we want to enter into intimate fellowship with him I don't want to be made to feel good about my sin [Applause] I don't want to be made to feel good about my inadequacy I want somebody to point me to a closer walk with him so that I can get over the the condemnation and the guilt that the enemy throws I don't ever want people to be satisfied with anything less than gaining Christ and being in him we don't sit around condemning one another for our our inferiorities or our shortcomings but neither do we encourage people to stay where they are I want to have a good balance in these things don't you I hear people encouraging people well just you know just trust just believe you stay right where you are it's going to work out all right after a while that doesn't sound like what Moses was saying that doesn't sound like what Paul was saying this is the Cry of the remnant bride in this hour we want to know him to enter into intimate fellowship with him more than power more than signs more than wonders we are running hard after him we want to fully understand the finished work that he has accomplished in US so that our striving and our soulish efforts can cease we want to have fellowship with God as Moses had face to face the face of God speaks of his Spirit it doesn't speak of his mouth and nose and eyes this would mean the spirit of Moses having deep communion with the spirit of God when your spirit has had deep communion with his spirit you have fellowshipped with him face to face it's not about seeing features God did not allow Moses to see his eyes nose and mouth we'll get to that Tuesday night s of Spirit Fellowship which is without mine will and emotion emotion can easily stop you from having intimate fellowship with the spirit I'm not preaching that we need to be more emotional in preaching we need to be more sincere in our praise so that we can experience his spirit In Worship praise breaks open worship is not about what you say or what you do it's about your position we've taught that before we can know these things by the scripture I I only want to mention one thing here and that is let me read this quickly second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18. but we all with open face you know what open face means face to face we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord how is that possible because the veil is removed brother Greeley said something in one of his Services perhaps it was a Thursday night about the veil being removed you remember it I don't remember what night it was but it reminded me of a word from the Lord thank you he spoke to us some years ago and he said I am sending an anointing that will remove the final veils from before the faces of my people the veils that have prevented them from seeing the things that I have desired for them to see he said veils are being identified in our lives veils that we hide behind to keep from having to step out of our comfort zone and into the new territory that the Lord wants to give to us and veils that hinder our view into the realm of the spirit veils of opinion and unbelief and self-condemnation and disqualification that separate us from Christ that hinder our intimate fellowship with him and for the spirit of the Lord to say I'm sending an anointing to remove those final veils to hear Brother Greely saying what he was saying about those veil about the Veil it stirred something in me and so I've been praying this week could this be the hour could this be this time the season the moment that God wants to yank what we hide behind you know we do you know we hide you know sometimes we hide behind the veils we don't want us people to see us as we really are and by hiding behind the veils we cut ourselves off from that naked intimate Fellowship I hope that's not offensive the way I described it it simply means there's nothing between you two to hinder to separate to keep you from having fellowship with him but this be the time that God is getting ready to deal with those veils it took me in the word and he helped me to identify six different veils that are spoken of in the scripture and I preached that and you might couldn't find it the veil of the Tabernacle the veil of the temple the veil of Moses the veil of Christ's flesh the veil of unbelief and eventually the veil of national blindness in Romans where God talks about removing the veil from his people the bride of Christ should be unveiled in this hour so that she can see Christ in the fullness of who he is does that resonate with anybody nothing between you and him nothing that shuts you out why is it churches let's stand why is it church that we don't think like this all the time because we get caught up in life and we need to be reminded on occasion you can have all the success that this world offers but if you're not winning Christ if he's not your prize if Christ is not the reason you get up in the morning if Christ is not the reason why you came to church this morning if Christ is not the reason why we desire to have fellowship with one another if Christ is not the reason why we desire to do our best and to be our best and everything we put our hands to do the Bible talks about Daniel having an excellent spirit he rose above and superseded the status quo and he found a place of being excellent in the sight of God because everything he put his hands to do he did it with everything that he had and God honored him for that just like he honored Joshua and Caleb I think that Joshua was one of the first to go in because he was one of the last to come out I want us to sing into the presence of Jesus as we get ready to close [Music] and to the presence of Jesus that's where I'm longing to go [Music] I will dress through the veil of your mercy until more of your glory I know I know let me hear you sing the presence [Music] Nothing Else Matters that's where [Music] I will press through [Music] so that more of your glory can you do it in that key or do we need to change keys for you oh [Music] Jesus that's where sweet why don't you come worship with us why don't we come worship together I will press [Music] of Jesus oh that's where that's where I'm alone [Music] let's do it [Music] Jesus until more of your glory I know foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] don't be satisfied anywhere else nothing else can satisfy like being in his presence [Music] your mercy let's sing it one more time and then we'll let you sing something else [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] another High your s [Music] while you're just getting another song to lead us in I've been revisiting in my mind this week the whole Zechariah 3 thing that we were mentioning during the camp maybe just before and I almost took a text from Zechariah 3 this morning but there is a threefold blessing I believe God wants it to be ours what are you going to sing son you can sing and then I'll get this I'm looking for it I want to read this to the people [Music] we want to worship you Jesus [Music] this place in time that I might seek and find my God my God and Lord I want the Earth for you I wanna burn [Music] s over you [Music] I wanna burn [Music] you it's always [Music] I wanna burn with Passions and holy Lord [Music] your joy is mine [Music] with all my singing and bringing praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the light of him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] so Lord I wanna yearn in Zechariah chapter 3 verse 7 in the complete Jewish Bible it says Adonai at 7 says this if you will walk in my ways obey my commission judge my house and guard my courtyards then I will give you free access among those who are standing here when I had a visitation in Jerusalem I was told that there is a three-fold blessing could you put up Zechariah 3 7 in the King James and let's look at it in just a moment Lord of hosts if thou Wilt walk in my ways and if thou will keep my charge then Thou shalt also judge my house shall also keep my courts and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by and I was told in that experience if there was a threefold blessing that was promised in Zechariah 3 7 number one governing Authority you will judge and govern my house number two administrative privileges if you will keep and have charge and guard my courts which we know to be the realm of the third heaven and number three Priestly prophetic and kingly service places to walk among those who are standing by and you will be granted free access if you knew that you had free access into the holy of holies wouldn't you go and how often would you go that's free access if you're waiting to be invited in you miss the invitation he said now let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace that we might obtain help where do you think the throne of grace is in the courtroom or the throne room of our God it's in the holy of holies you've already been invited in what's our hold up we stand in our own way if a people were to determine among themselves to answer the Lord's invitation that's what he would give that people governing Authority administrative privilege and Priestly prophetic and kingly service before the King of Kings and the Lord of lords you could stand in his holy Presence at any time you desired because free access means exactly that free unobstructed unhindered says the New Testament said you got it let us therefore come boldly the Apostle said we are now seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus if I truly knew that I could go in whenever I wanted to why would I let a day go by that I didn't stand in his presence give him my praise and let him see my need sometime you're not there to tell him what you need you're just there to show him Lord this is our desire if there's a promise in this for us we want to walk in the Fulfillment of that promise would you teach us how would you allow us to enter in according to that invitation that you have offered us let's sing something let's worship just a little more before we go home today I wouldn't add to this this is his presence he's trying to do something for us let's let him do it now thank you Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] for you I wanna burn with passion Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] always I want us to send you you are my daily bread you you know what I'm talking about breathe I want us to sing that before we go this is [Music] living near me [Music] this is my daily bread [Music] is my day you're very your very word first spoken to me oh let's

Naya who is been battling a terrible high fever like so many others we lift our little precious sweet girl up to you Lord that you would touch her Smite the hand of the enemy that has dared to afflict her body we pray for the Saints who have nearly recovered except for their strength and lingering symptoms may this be the day of their victory May there be an end call to it in the spirit Lord throughout this week would you continue to stir us and draw us to you bless those who are yet to travel Lord touch puppy in the name of Jesus strengthen his body whatever it is the enemy has tried to lay on him [Music] thank you for your healing virtue we just thank you for the peace that's in this room right now let it go with us and keep us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said turn and love one another would you do that now if you have needs the Lord is mindful of those needs you don't need me you need him in just a moment you might you surely can [Music] and I I'm desperate for you [Music] we haven't yet dismissed and I I'm lost without you and I I'm desperate for you [Music] you and I I I'm lost without you thank you Jesus I just want to say is that all yes it's on okay I just want to say that all week the Lord has been dealing with me about Zechariah 3. and seeing that you mentioned that visitation you had all we I kept seeing something and that was how Joshua the high priest stood there and he had on filthy garments yes and it was due to the fact that he had been associated with Babylon yes and at one point it came and I know my prayer the whole time was when he came and there was he had the turbanon and then came that swirling and he covered his head yes and then once it lifted that's when the work was done and Holiness unto the Lord Holiness was written yes over yes and that has been my prayer all the time this week God's Soul emphasized it yeah my thoughts yes Lord [Music] yeah and then there [Music] uh it was about a brother who was trying to dig a river and then you saw that pipe pull the mic down a little bit I'm just all right um and you saw those pipes and you told him that he needed to put them right at the bottom because when that wave would come that river that water would come only the purest of water would go through that and that's what we have been hearing got to have it and on Friday morning as I was praying God just moved in and my and that's what he emphasized to me is we've got to watch our thoughts our words so that Holiness could be you know that overcoming brother random emphasize that our thoughts are so important amen that we would just yield to this because God that change is coming oh yes it's on its way you mentioned that again today and and our week he's been dealing with me with his very thing and I I'm just so thankful thank you for confirming that let's praise God for that thank you my Lord foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh sweet Lamb of God again I'm desperate and I [Music] I'm desperate for you oh yes [Music] I'm lost without you [Music] how many of you know you're lost without him you're desperate to have more of him because without him we're nothing is that right you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord go in his peace and those of you who would like to have Fellowship Under the Tent today we will do that we'll just get our lunch and bring it back and let the peace of God just surround you I don't know maybe you're not maybe you're not satisfied with the service but I'm very satisfied I'm very satisfied with what I feel right now I believe the Lord has been with us and I want to I want him to go with me when I go don't you you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord love one another take advantage of this atmosphere let him give you a new mindset [Music] oh you do that honey I'll have to wipe my sweat up a little bit if the young people could just make their way to the tent so we can get a youth picture after the service that'd be great thank you [Music]
