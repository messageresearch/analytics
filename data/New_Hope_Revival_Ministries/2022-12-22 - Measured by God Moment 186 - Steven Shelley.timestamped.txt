[0:00] so the bride does not Escape
[0:03] she just has a different season
[0:07] and this is our season
[0:09] we're being tested and tried
[0:18] God has a pattern and and we are being
[0:21] measured even worshipers are being
[0:23] measured in this hour it's a prophetic
[0:27] thing and you're not going to be
[0:28] measured by the church's pattern
[0:31] you're not going to be measured by
[0:33] denominational pattern you're not going
[0:36] to be measured by CNN or Fox news's
[0:38] pattern are the writers and great
[0:41] philosophers of Our Generation but you
[0:44] and I along with the rest of the world
[0:47] all of us we are going to be measured by
[0:50] God's pattern amen by God's pattern
[0:54] now we know that the Bride of Jesus
[0:58] Christ will never stand before the great
[1:01] white Throne Judgment of Our Lord we
[1:04] will stand with him and judge the
[1:07] nations of the world the bride is chosen
[1:10] to be judges with him but every person
[1:14] who is not a part of that bride of
[1:16] Christ will stand before the great white
[1:19] Throne Judgment of the Lord and
[1:21] everything that they have ever done in
[1:23] this life will be brought up
[1:25] and even the things they did in the name
[1:28] of God will be brought up and their
[1:31] motive even will be judged not only evil
[1:34] things they did but things they did in
[1:37] the Name of Christ will also be judged
[1:40] and their motive will be sifted through
[1:42] now why do you say the bride doesn't
[1:45] have to stand in the Judgment that day
[1:48] because whether you recognize it or not
[1:50] your judgment is now
[1:53] the little bride is being judged now
[1:56] somebody said how is that we are being
[1:59] sifted we are being tested we are being
[2:04] tried we are being squeezed around the
[2:08] corner we will know some persecution
[2:11] we have known hardship we have known the
[2:15] bitterness of failure we've known what
[2:18] it's like to start out and miss the mark
[2:21] and have to go back and recalibrate and
[2:25] re-aim so that we don't miss the Mark we
[2:28] have stood strong and at times we have
[2:31] fallen short but God's grace His
[2:35] Marvelous Grace His Amazing Grace Has
[2:40] Lifted us every time from the pit that
[2:43] we found ourselves in when we failed he
[2:47] saw us and he loved us with an
[2:49] everlasting and eternal love he didn't
[2:52] love us less when we disobeyed him he
[2:55] loved us more when we failed because he
[2:58] knew that we would allow him to work his
[3:01] work of redemption in US
[3:03] what you find ugly God looks down and he
[3:07] says oh Oh What a Beautiful work and it
[3:10] pleases the Lord he's not pleased with
[3:12] her failure but he's pleased that even
[3:16] in her weakness
[3:18] commits herself to him in submission and
[3:21] obedience and he gets to come with this
[3:23] silver Redemption and work his work like
[3:26] a like a mother needs the doe he's
[3:29] needing her heart so the bride does not
[3:32] Escape
[3:33] she just has a different season
[3:38] and this is our season
[3:40] we're being tested and tried
[3:42] and we're going to have to get it right
[3:45] it is as though the angel of the Lord
[3:48] Has Come
[3:49] with a reed like unto a rod and he's not
[3:53] only
[3:54] during the things that be of God
[3:56] but he is
