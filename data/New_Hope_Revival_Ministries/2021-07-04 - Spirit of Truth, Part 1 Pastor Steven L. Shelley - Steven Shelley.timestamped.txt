[30:01] by the lifting of the hand
[30:03] you just have a need you just want to
[30:04] signify by raising your hand hold that
[30:07] need in your heart today
[30:11] i wonder how many of you remember the
[30:13] patterson
[30:14] family from norway hold up your hand
[30:18] hold it up high and let me see how many
[30:20] all right i think that
[30:22] may have been just before the anteces
[30:23] came what year did you all come sister
[30:26] teresa
[30:27] it was just before then they were with
[30:30] us i think two summers
[30:32] well i want you to know that yesterday i
[30:34] heard from benjamin
[30:36] i don't know if you remember some of
[30:38] them i don't i i know in one of these
[30:40] emails some of their names there i know
[30:42] there was a reuben wasn't there
[30:43] was there anybody call out uh
[30:47] ariel he was a piana is he the one that
[30:50] did the music
[30:52] can anybody else remember anyway
[30:55] it was a precious family that we met in
[30:57] norway when we were doing ministry there
[30:59] and they came two years in a row two
[31:02] summers in a row for
[31:03] for camp meeting and we didn't hear from
[31:06] them for a long time
[31:07] and i think benjamin was about seven
[31:09] years old when he was here he's the one
[31:11] that i've been corresponding with
[31:13] but my prayer request is their dad
[31:16] brother bert
[31:17] is having a brain surgery
[31:21] tomorrow there are two uh
[31:25] tumors that are benign on his brain
[31:29] let me see just a minute uh
[31:32] on the frontal lobe of the brain and
[31:34] they are affecting his cognitive
[31:36] abilities
[31:37] and have disturbed him quite a bit and
[31:39] they're thankful that they're benign
[31:41] but he has reached out and asked for
[31:44] prayer
[31:44] and benjamin has been streaming the
[31:46] services with us
[31:48] and i want us to believe the lord for a
[31:51] miracle
[31:52] and mom and dad are together and the
[31:55] family is well
[31:56] and uh three of them are married with
[31:59] families of their own
[32:00] and let's just lift the whole family up
[32:03] to the lord they really meant a lot to
[32:04] me
[32:05] and when i answered benjamin yesterday
[32:08] the thing that came to my mind the most
[32:10] was his mother could really make me
[32:12] laugh she had a sense of humor and i can
[32:15] still hear her talking about the sheep's
[32:17] head
[32:18] that was that the neighbor brought to
[32:20] their house and delivered and she didn't
[32:22] really know what to do with it
[32:23] she just had a such an expressive way
[32:26] and they meant a lot to us let's ask god
[32:29] for a miracle for our brother that he
[32:31] come through
[32:32] very well and also a sister nakisha has
[32:36] reached out
[32:37] and they were planning to be in church
[32:39] today but she has
[32:40] on top of all of the other things they
[32:42] have been fighting
[32:43] she has injured her foot now and needs
[32:46] to have that checked out
[32:48] but the doctor gave sister audrey a good
[32:50] report
[32:52] on friday even though those uh
[32:54] treatments
[32:56] really leave her weakened they're making
[32:59] progress
[33:00] and he is pleased with the progress that
[33:02] she's making because of these nerve
[33:04] treatments so we want to give god praise
[33:06] for that
[33:07] but also believe for a complete miracle
[33:10] and pray for brother steve curry and his
[33:13] family today
[33:14] and let's pray in advance for the
[33:16] rehearsal
[33:17] and for the wedding that god's perfect
[33:20] order
[33:20] and his wonderful presence will be
[33:23] involved with
[33:24] every aspect of it amen amen

[33:31] come and pray today

[40:55] this is the first sunday of the month
[40:58] and as we have announced previously
[41:00] that we would receive a principal
[41:03] offering
[41:05] on the first sunday of each month
[41:08] to put directly on the principle
[41:12] of the mortgage of this property
[41:15] right now that number that has been
[41:17] given
[41:18] as of july the third is one hundred and
[41:21] twelve
[41:21] thousand six hundred and sixty six
[41:24] dollars
[41:25] and eighty-three cents we are so
[41:28] grateful to the lord for this
[41:35] today is july the 4th sister beverly a
[41:39] very happy birthday to you god bless you
[41:46] when we started this
[41:51] effort to rid ourselves of the mortgage
[41:55] on this property
[41:58] i trust that we made it clear that
[42:02] we might would have to reallocate
[42:05] the funds if things became
[42:08] tight we do not want to do that
[42:14] so i am going to
[42:17] you may have noticed that it's very warm
[42:20] in the foyer
[42:22] that air-conditioned unit is out
[42:25] so that unit is going to have to be
[42:27] replaced brother
[42:29] man came on friday and he tried to put
[42:32] freon in the unit
[42:33] and he said it was leaking out as fast
[42:35] as he put it in
[42:37] so the unit will have to be replaced he
[42:39] also told me
[42:41] that we're very blessed because these
[42:43] are really
[42:44] 10-year units and we're on year 17.
[42:48] the lord is good to us
[42:55] that being said
[42:59] we are going to receive an offering
[43:01] because we don't know what the cost of
[43:02] the unit is going to be we're going to
[43:04] receive an offering
[43:05] next weekend to help to
[43:08] pay for that and i'm telling you
[43:12] that because it may affect what you give
[43:15] today
[43:16] and i'm not going to condemn you for
[43:18] that
[43:20] what the reason i'm telling you that is
[43:22] because we really would like for
[43:24] every dollar that's given today to go
[43:28] to that principle till that we don't
[43:30] have to reallocate the funds to pay for
[43:33] that air condition unit
[43:35] so if you feel like that you're really
[43:37] tight and you need to adjust what you
[43:40] give today i honor you for giving to the
[43:43] lord
[43:44] whatever way that you the lord would
[43:46] speak to you
[43:47] i honor you for your giving i honor you
[43:50] for paying your tithes
[43:52] that's a covenant you keep with the lord
[43:54] and i honor you for
[43:55] every dollar you give in an offering
[43:58] whatever that offering is for
[44:00] you are giving people and i bless you in
[44:03] the name of the lord
[44:05] so again next sunday we're going to
[44:08] receive an offering to try to pay for
[44:10] that unit that's got to be replaced
[44:12] for the foyer uh the the four year gets
[44:16] very warm but those rooms that are cut
[44:18] off the bathrooms and so forth
[44:20] it gets very hot back there so we need
[44:23] to get that replaced as soon as possible
[44:26] so that'll be an offering next sunday so

[49:45] we want to say happy birthday to our
[49:47] nation today
[49:49] we are very thankful to live in the
[49:52] united states of america
[49:55] we are not ignorant to all of her
[49:57] weaknesses
[49:58] and her failures but it's like it is
[50:01] with your own children
[50:03] with your own family members you don't
[50:05] stop loving them because
[50:07] they've made some mistakes there have
[50:09] been many many mistakes made
[50:12] in our nation i thought about maybe
[50:14] someone coming along
[50:16] and hearing us saying the truth is
[50:18] marching on and
[50:20] they might think we're singing about the
[50:22] civil war
[50:23] i want you to know that war is finished
[50:26] it's
[50:26] fought and it's over we're not in a
[50:29] civil war
[50:31] we're not celebrating any division like
[50:33] that
[50:34] our brother against brother we have no
[50:36] no joy in that
[50:38] but we we're following a greater truth
[50:41] that is marching on and uh had it not
[50:44] been for those who are willing to
[50:46] protect freedom
[50:47] and uh to to stand up for the
[50:51] disenfranchised
[50:52] and uh i'm i'm so thankful for
[50:56] i'm thankful today for legal immigration
[51:01] that's how we all got here and i'm
[51:03] thankful that god made a way to
[51:06] uh this united states of america to open
[51:09] up her arms and
[51:11] allow people to come who were looking
[51:13] for
[51:14] uh freedom they weren't bringing in
[51:17] fentanyl and uh
[51:18] all kinds of drugs and guns and things
[51:21] like that they were looking for
[51:22] a place to worship the lord these drugs
[51:26] that are coming into our nation from
[51:28] various sources
[51:30] some of which are coming through the
[51:31] southern border
[51:33] and across the waters of the caribbean
[51:37] and these man-made drugs some of them
[51:41] are hundreds of times more potent than
[51:44] morphine
[51:45] can you imagine that that touching
[51:48] the powder of some of these drugs can
[51:51] cause an overdose
[51:53] it can get in your bloodstream through
[51:55] your skin response
[51:56] and take your life and i support anybody
[52:01] who wants to slow that that down
[52:04] in this nation because maybe your
[52:07] children and my children
[52:08] are not bound by those things but they
[52:11] could have been
[52:12] but by the grace of god so i'm thankful
[52:15] for america
[52:16] and i pray for our president if we've
[52:19] ever
[52:19] had a president who needs prayer he
[52:22] needs
[52:22] prayer and i pray for him and i don't
[52:26] call him
[52:26] biden when i'm praying for him either i
[52:29] call him president
[52:30] biden because we've been taught that if
[52:33] you
[52:33] for some reason or another cannot
[52:35] respect a man you can at least
[52:37] and should respect the office that he
[52:40] holds
[52:41] and we can do that and we can pray for
[52:43] change
[52:45] and we can we can pray that it won't
[52:47] always be like it is right now
[52:49] but i'd rather be a part of this nation
[52:51] than any nation i know
[52:53] i'm thankful for it if i lived anywhere
[52:56] else in the world it would be jerusalem
[53:01] i can't think of anywhere else i would
[53:03] want to be so
[53:04] we are thankful for that it's much more
[53:06] than fireworks and hot dogs
[53:09] i like both but it's not about that it's
[53:12] about so much more than that aren't you
[53:14] glad to be free
[53:15] and aren't you glad that it gives that
[53:18] freedom that we have in this nation
[53:19] gives us freedom to worship god
[53:22] according to the dictates of our heart
[53:25] that's what we're the most thankful for
[53:27] amen and you may not you may not agree
[53:30] with all the spending and you may not
[53:32] agree with the
[53:33] child tax credit and but you'll spend it
[53:38] no matter as a republican or democrat in
[53:40] the white house you'll spend the money
[53:44] won't you sure i will
[53:48] we're just thankful i want you to know
[53:51] if you didn't already that we are
[53:53] in the dire straits a three week
[53:56] a three-week period of time that has
[54:00] been marked
[54:01] for many many years way back
[54:04] since the occupying forces of rome
[54:07] marched into the city of jerusalem
[54:11] and of course the temple was destroyed
[54:15] two times
[54:16] on the ninth of of of
[54:19] which is the last day
[54:22] of those three weeks it's sometimes
[54:25] referred to as the season of the
[54:27] basilisk
[54:28] in in jewish literature it's referred to
[54:31] as the three weeks
[54:33] sometimes the the times of dire straits
[54:37] you'll read several different uh uh
[54:41] terms and terminologies but it marks a
[54:44] very dark time
[54:45] in in the lives of the jewish people
[54:49] and we have noticed because it begins
[54:53] on the anniversary of the forces
[54:55] marching into jerusalem
[54:57] and ends on the day of the destruction
[54:59] of the temple but it was not just
[55:01] destroyed one time
[55:02] but two times on the same day years
[55:05] apart
[55:06] and most of you know that it's just it's
[55:10] it's just very strange when you look at
[55:12] history
[55:13] all the things that happened to the
[55:14] jewish people during those three weeks
[55:17] year after year after year after year
[55:20] and we have learned
[55:21] for the past oh 13
[55:24] 14 15 years to mark those things to
[55:27] watch those things
[55:29] because it's in that period that the
[55:31] enemy he
[55:32] very much likes to change a mask
[55:35] he's always the enemy he always is out
[55:38] to steal and kill
[55:40] and destroy but he likes to change his
[55:42] mask
[55:43] and he likes to come in and uh he
[55:46] especially is
[55:48] after eggs
[55:51] you say what in the world do you mean i
[55:53] mean something forming
[55:55] something spiritually forming getting
[55:58] ready to be born
[56:00] getting ready to break out and he likes
[56:03] to come in in that basilisk
[56:05] uh form he likes to come in and he likes
[56:08] to take the life out of something that's
[56:11] just being born or
[56:12] or forming to be born you may not think
[56:15] of anything in your life i can think of
[56:17] many things in my life
[56:19] that are in that embryonic stage and i'm
[56:22] praying and i have been
[56:23] since it started on june 27th i'm
[56:26] praying that god's holy ghost power
[56:29] and his holy angels will guard
[56:31] everything that god
[56:33] is forming and every little thing that
[56:35] has reached its embryonic stage
[56:38] it has not yet come to the birth we know
[56:40] that there's no
[56:42] devil in hell that can steal
[56:45] if we're standing in faith to protect on
[56:48] guard
[56:49] how many of you believe it's a good idea
[56:50] to be on guard
[56:52] to be watchmen of your own life and of
[56:55] your own family because there's
[56:57] impostors
[56:59] the enemy comes like that as an imposter
[57:02] and we want to know we just want to know
[57:04] and we want to stay on top
[57:06] would you help me pray for sister
[57:07] laurel's mother i didn't get that note
[57:09] for the billy in time but we want to
[57:11] lift her up she has had a fall
[57:13] and needs to be remembered to the lord
[57:16] very serious
[57:17] and needs to be lifted up to the lord
[57:19] today and it's heartbreaking
[57:22] to think of someone so senior
[57:25] and already in a sad
[57:29] shape a condition to be in in this now
[57:32] with a broken hip
[57:34] but we know that god is more than able
[57:37] to watch over to help you know some
[57:40] people say things like well where was
[57:41] god
[57:43] then he was there i tell you he was
[57:46] there and i'm so thankful
[57:49] that i know that i know that i know that
[57:52] i know
[57:53] that even when he has not prevented
[57:55] things from happening
[57:57] he's there and he's watching over
[58:00] and he's taking care and don't you love
[58:03] him i didn't even shake your hand sister

[58:58] our children together

[59:56] new home he's there
[59:58] his presence is there and the memories
[1:00:00] of his life
[1:00:01] and him being with us is there but god
[1:00:04] has been so good to that little
[1:00:06] mississippi girl back there when i
[1:00:09] walked in her beautiful new home that
[1:00:11] god
[1:00:11] has given her you know not many people
[1:00:14] in life
[1:00:14] are given a home without a bill without
[1:00:18] a mortgage

[1:00:22] one that she could pick out and choose
[1:00:26] given brand new furniture to sit on
[1:00:29] and uh that was the goodness of god
[1:00:33] and to her life and when i walked in the
[1:00:36] door i said oh

[1:04:02] would you permit me to take you now for
[1:04:05] a moment to first corinthians chapter
[1:04:07] two
[1:04:08] i'd like to read verse 6
[1:04:11] through 14 we are continuing
[1:04:16] our series on what we are
[1:04:19] calling for lack of a better terminology
[1:04:23] the seven offices of the holy ghost
[1:04:27] and uh we really believe it's ministries
[1:04:31] or administrations
[1:04:33] of the holy ghost and sunday
[1:04:37] and tuesday night we spoke about the
[1:04:40] spirit of
[1:04:41] life anybody guess what we're going to
[1:04:43] talk about today
[1:04:45] the spirit of truth and then
[1:04:49] we'll continue on to the spirit of
[1:04:51] adoption
[1:04:52] the spirit of holiness the spirit of
[1:04:54] grace
[1:04:55] the spirit of supplication and the
[1:04:58] spirit of glory
[1:04:59] all the same spirit one
[1:05:02] holy ghost one but different
[1:05:05] administrations
[1:05:07] of who he is and i'm very very
[1:05:10] thankful for all that the holy ghost
[1:05:13] accomplishes
[1:05:14] in my life first corinthians two and six
[1:05:18] howbeit we speak wisdom among them
[1:05:22] that are perfect yet not the wisdom
[1:05:25] of this world nor of the princes
[1:05:29] of this world that come to naught
[1:05:32] but we speak the wisdom of god
[1:05:36] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[1:05:40] which god ordained before the world
[1:05:44] unto our glory
[1:05:47] which none of the princes of this world
[1:05:50] knew
[1:05:51] for had they known it they would not
[1:05:54] have crucified the lord
[1:05:57] of glory but as it is written
[1:06:00] i hath not seen nor
[1:06:05] ear heard neither have entered into the
[1:06:09] heart of man
[1:06:10] the things which god hath prepared
[1:06:14] for them that love him period
[1:06:18] now many denominations just like to
[1:06:21] quote that part
[1:06:22] they don't like to read the next part
[1:06:25] those who deny the supernatural
[1:06:27] those who deny that he's jesus christ
[1:06:30] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:06:32] they just said well you know the bible
[1:06:33] said
[1:06:34] i have not seen near hath not heard
[1:06:36] neither hath it entered into the heart
[1:06:37] of man
[1:06:38] but look at the next verse but
[1:06:41] god hath revealed them
[1:06:45] unto us by his
[1:06:49] spirit hallelujah so
[1:06:52] i hadn't seen it natural eye natural ear
[1:06:56] hasn't heard it
[1:06:57] but god hath revealed them unto us
[1:07:02] by his spirit the spirit of truth
[1:07:07] for the spirit searcheth all things
[1:07:11] yay the deep things of god
[1:07:15] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:07:19] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:07:23] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:07:28] but the spirit of
[1:07:31] god oh that's good
[1:07:34] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:07:37] the world
[1:07:38] but the spirit which is of god that
[1:07:42] we might know the things that are freely
[1:07:45] given to us of god
[1:07:49] we don't even know what we have we don't
[1:07:52] even know what god has given
[1:07:54] us until the holy ghost
[1:07:58] reveals it to us the spirit of
[1:08:01] truth has to show us what we have
[1:08:05] you can be walking around with
[1:08:07] privileges
[1:08:08] of bridal inheritance and not even know
[1:08:11] what you have
[1:08:13] oh but the spirit of truth is in us
[1:08:17] by the holy ghost to reveal it
[1:08:20] let me read that verse again now we have
[1:08:22] received not the spirit of the world
[1:08:24] but the spirit which is of god that we
[1:08:26] might know
[1:08:28] the things that are freely given to us
[1:08:30] of god
[1:08:31] which things also we speak not in the
[1:08:34] words which man's wisdom receiveth
[1:08:37] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[1:08:40] comparing you want to know how the holy
[1:08:42] ghost teaches
[1:08:44] this is how comparing
[1:08:51] not just natural type spiritual
[1:08:55] that's one part of it that's one layer
[1:08:57] of revelation
[1:08:59] but if you want to get to the deep
[1:09:00] places it's not going to be
[1:09:02] just natural tapping spiritual it's
[1:09:05] going to be spiritual compared
[1:09:07] with spiritual line upon line see
[1:09:10] he goes on but the natural man
[1:09:15] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:09:18] of god
[1:09:19] for they are foolishness unto him
[1:09:24] neither can he know them because
[1:09:27] they are spiritually discerned
[1:09:31] i know you're standing have you ever
[1:09:34] tried to tell
[1:09:35] somebody something that god had made
[1:09:38] real to you and they didn't have an ear
[1:09:40] to hear i mean no ear to hearing
[1:09:43] and might even respond to you that's
[1:09:45] stupid
[1:09:46] that's just dumb you shouldn't be
[1:09:49] surprised
[1:09:50] when you get a carnal reaction from a
[1:09:52] carnal man
[1:09:53] a natural reaction from a natural man
[1:09:56] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:09:58] things of the spirit of god
[1:09:59] for they are foolishness unto him
[1:10:01] neither can he know them
[1:10:04] to them it's not been given yet maybe
[1:10:07] not at
[1:10:07] all because these things they
[1:10:10] are spiritually discerned
[1:10:13] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:10:16] of the spirit of god
[1:10:18] for they are foolishness unto him
[1:10:20] neither can he know them
[1:10:22] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:10:24] pray with me just a moment father
[1:10:27] i want to thank you and i believe
[1:10:30] there's others in this house
[1:10:32] who want to thank you for the work
[1:10:35] the ministry the offices the
[1:10:38] administration
[1:10:39] of the holy ghost in our lives he
[1:10:42] is the government of god
[1:10:45] hallelujah lord we thank you for the
[1:10:48] government of god
[1:10:49] that is operating in the life of the
[1:10:52] believer
[1:10:53] we know we cannot overcome without the
[1:10:56] holy ghost
[1:10:57] we cannot overcome without the order of
[1:11:01] god
[1:11:02] in our life so lord we pray
[1:11:05] that you will give us grace and wisdom
[1:11:09] to keep opening up room for you to
[1:11:12] occupy
[1:11:13] for you to fill us fill every void
[1:11:18] hallelujah and give us grace to clean
[1:11:21] out more room
[1:11:23] so there be another void created so you
[1:11:26] can come and fill that too
[1:11:28] now we know that the enemy he is
[1:11:32] ever more against the revealed word of
[1:11:34] god
[1:11:35] that means he is against the ministry
[1:11:39] of the holy ghost and so he might not
[1:11:42] just be quiet
[1:11:43] and just let us talk about it without
[1:11:46] putting up a fuss
[1:11:47] but we ask for the grace of god to fill
[1:11:50] this room right now
[1:11:52] we ask lord for you to bring in a spirit
[1:11:55] of alertness
[1:11:57] and uh of being awake and that you would
[1:12:00] anoint our faith
[1:12:02] that we'll pull on the word and i
[1:12:05] believe that you will
[1:12:06] open up for us things that we need to
[1:12:09] know
[1:12:09] for the hour that we're living in right
[1:12:11] now it's it's you lord we're looking to
[1:12:14] today never to man
[1:12:16] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[1:12:18] christ
[1:12:19] yeshua our messiah we pray and the
[1:12:22] saints said
[1:12:23] you may be seated the spirit of
[1:12:27] truth the work
[1:12:31] of the spirit of truth is to bring to us
[1:12:35] a more perfect revelation
[1:12:38] of god in our lives
[1:12:41] it is not to fill us with more knowledge
[1:12:45] or to give us more information because
[1:12:48] information and knowledge is only one
[1:12:52] step in the process of revelation
[1:12:56] you have to hear something you you have
[1:12:58] to come in contact
[1:13:00] with something uh some piece of
[1:13:03] information
[1:13:04] some some bit of knowledge that is a
[1:13:07] part
[1:13:08] of the process of revelation without you
[1:13:11] ever if you
[1:13:12] and i had never heard the message of the
[1:13:14] hour
[1:13:15] we might have kept flopping around with
[1:13:18] the best that we had
[1:13:19] just flopping around over there in the
[1:13:22] barnyard
[1:13:23] oh yes i said it just flopping around
[1:13:27] in the barnyard over there but god led
[1:13:30] us here
[1:13:32] he let us hear there's more
[1:13:36] and that was information that was news
[1:13:39] to us
[1:13:40] that was news what do you mean more
[1:13:43] we're pentecostal
[1:13:44] we've had it all sanctifi
[1:13:48] justification sanctification holy ghost
[1:13:50] baptism where do you go after that
[1:13:53] isn't that all that's how we were raised
[1:13:56] those of us who had pentecostal teaching
[1:14:00] we've we've arrived we've talked in
[1:14:03] tongues
[1:14:03] we've ran around the room we've we've
[1:14:06] got the fullness
[1:14:08] but we heard some information and uh
[1:14:11] we had to make a decision about what we
[1:14:14] heard
[1:14:15] will i engage that will i dig a little
[1:14:18] more
[1:14:19] will i open up my heart will am i
[1:14:21] willing to step away from mama's
[1:14:23] teaching
[1:14:24] or daddy's teaching or the church's
[1:14:27] teaching
[1:14:28] and explore the reality that god may not
[1:14:31] be three different people
[1:14:34] will i have the courage to understand to
[1:14:37] even begin to understand
[1:14:39] uh the oneness the union
[1:14:43] that beautiful unity of the godhead
[1:14:47] am i willing to to uh re-examine my
[1:14:51] thought
[1:14:52] that if i speak in tongues i have the
[1:14:54] holy ghost and that's all there is
[1:14:57] will i be willing to take a baptism
[1:15:00] i've already been baptized what are you
[1:15:02] trying to do get me waterlogged and put
[1:15:04] me in the water again
[1:15:05] and hold me down to the bubbles aren't
[1:15:07] coming up anymore
[1:15:09] why would i need to be baptized again
[1:15:11] and most of us could say i've been
[1:15:13] baptized many times
[1:15:15] by the time we were coming to hear this
[1:15:18] truth
[1:15:19] while we'd already been baptized
[1:15:20] multiple times as though it didn't work
[1:15:24] because we were taught every time you
[1:15:26] backslide every time you make a mistake
[1:15:29] every time you do wrong you've got to
[1:15:30] come back and do your first works all
[1:15:32] over again
[1:15:33] brother branham tells us in the seals i
[1:15:35] think it is well that's all right
[1:15:37] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:15:39] but that's not what he's talking about
[1:15:43] it's all right to want to come back
[1:15:45] renew yourself
[1:15:46] and start over drive down another state
[1:15:50] nothing wrong with that but it was
[1:15:52] taught to us
[1:15:53] that it's just about necessary you're
[1:15:55] just starting out on the journey all
[1:15:57] over again
[1:15:58] but many of us were willing to entertain
[1:16:02] what we were hearing because
[1:16:05] there was something on the inside
[1:16:09] you know what it was something on the
[1:16:13] inside began to bubble
[1:16:16] it began to fizz something in the
[1:16:20] spirit man began to say
[1:16:23] that's a t-bone steak
[1:16:27] you and i had had enough bologna
[1:16:29] sandwiches over there in the pentecostal
[1:16:31] groups and we were well filled there's
[1:16:35] nothing i'll tell you there's nothing
[1:16:36] wrong
[1:16:38] with a good baloney sandwich but my
[1:16:42] my my you ever get a hold of a good
[1:16:46] filet mignon
[1:16:49] you don't have to have pig wrapped
[1:16:50] around it to be good either
[1:16:53] you get a hold of that and i'm telling
[1:16:55] you then you won't want bologna if
[1:16:58] you've got a choice on the table you'll
[1:16:59] still be satisfied
[1:17:01] to eat bologna when you get it now when
[1:17:03] sister phoebe sends it from pennsylvania
[1:17:05] you'll eat it
[1:17:08] amy where's the baloney
[1:17:14] she's in the wrong part of the state ah
[1:17:17] but now there's a time for bologna
[1:17:21] sandwiches
[1:17:22] and there's a time for filet mignon and
[1:17:26] when we begin to feast on the word of
[1:17:28] god
[1:17:29] and that reaction began to set up on the
[1:17:31] inside of us
[1:17:32] the spirit of truth began to do his work
[1:17:36] and he's still working
[1:17:39] he's still working because we don't know
[1:17:42] all there is to know
[1:17:44] we're still learning we still listen to
[1:17:48] the message and hear things that we've
[1:17:50] never heard
[1:17:50] even though we heard them we're hearing
[1:17:54] them new again
[1:17:55] i love this spirit of truth that lives
[1:17:58] in me
[1:18:00] because he knows when in my life i am
[1:18:03] most needy and most ready
[1:18:07] to receive another layer of something
[1:18:10] god is trying to make real to me
[1:18:12] he knows where i am in my own mind
[1:18:16] and we get in a place sometime we just
[1:18:19] we just feel like we're shorting out
[1:18:22] and we can't receive any more and the
[1:18:24] lord will just refill
[1:18:26] re-feed us something we've already
[1:18:29] chewed on
[1:18:30] and it sustains us it's like beef jerky
[1:18:34] you just chew it and you get some some
[1:18:36] strength from it some
[1:18:38] protein from it but then you move into
[1:18:41] another season of your life
[1:18:42] where you're ready to have a little more
[1:18:46] understanding and god wants you to have
[1:18:49] understanding because
[1:18:51] you cannot defeat the devil with a good
[1:18:53] idea
[1:18:55] but you can defeat the devil with a
[1:18:57] revelation by the holy ghost
[1:18:59] you can choose when i woke up this
[1:19:03] morning the song
[1:19:05] in my spirit was a song that i haven't
[1:19:07] heard in quite a while
[1:19:10] and i had even forgot until i mentioned
[1:19:13] it to
[1:19:14] joshua and daniel and mariah on the way
[1:19:17] to church this morning
[1:19:19] uh and and joshua said well dad you know
[1:19:22] that song is from facing the giants
[1:19:25] and uh that's a film a christian film
[1:19:28] that most of you all have seen and i
[1:19:31] forgot the song
[1:19:32] was even from facing the giants but i
[1:19:35] woke up this morning
[1:19:36] singing the voice of truth
[1:19:40] maybe because i've been studying all
[1:19:42] week the spirit of truth
[1:19:44] but it was in me i woke up with it
[1:19:47] the voice of truth tells me a different
[1:19:51] story
[1:19:54] there's a lot of voices calling out to
[1:19:57] me
[1:19:59] so we listened to it on the way over
[1:20:01] here and i thought wow no wonder that
[1:20:03] was in my
[1:20:04] in my spirit when i woke up this morning
[1:20:07] he's talking about walking on water in
[1:20:09] the storms
[1:20:10] and he said the waves are calling out my
[1:20:12] name
[1:20:15] aren't they don't they do it sometime
[1:20:18] but i hear another voice
[1:20:21] in the midst of the waves in the midst
[1:20:25] of the storms
[1:20:26] i hear another voice hallelujah
[1:20:29] demo voices are saying you'll never win
[1:20:33] you'll never win you're going to lose
[1:20:37] again
[1:20:38] you're just a loser but there's another
[1:20:41] voice
[1:20:41] it's not always the loudest voice
[1:20:44] but there's another voice to the
[1:20:46] believer
[1:20:47] and it says just try one more time
[1:20:50] just believe with everything that's
[1:20:53] within you
[1:20:54] just keep pressing with everything you
[1:20:56] have
[1:20:57] and don't be discouraged by the voices
[1:20:59] that say you'll never win
[1:21:00] come on brother and sister and then that
[1:21:03] second verse is so good
[1:21:05] it talks about david standing before the
[1:21:08] giant
[1:21:08] and there's thousands of giant voices
[1:21:11] voices
[1:21:12] of the giants calling out you'll never
[1:21:14] win
[1:21:15] you'll never win but the voice of truth
[1:21:18] tells me a different story
[1:21:20] and i i tell you there's a line in there
[1:21:23] that
[1:21:24] that says and i will choose i will

[1:24:04] hallelujah god doesn't put his holy
[1:24:06] ghost in junk

[1:24:15] choice
[1:24:16] before they were ever born yes
[1:24:19] i'm not just trying to pip you up i'm
[1:24:22] trying to tell you the truth
[1:24:24] you didn't just receive the holy ghost
[1:24:26] to pray in the spirit
[1:24:27] you didn't just receive the holy ghost
[1:24:29] to have goosebumps on your hair
[1:24:32] your hair stand up and goosebumps on
[1:24:34] your arm he's
[1:24:35] with us not just to comfort

[1:24:44] what we need to win the
[1:24:45] win this thing and defeat the enemy is
[1:24:47] truth
[1:24:49] we need truth truth wins
[1:24:53] it wins it wins it wins i'm going to
[1:24:57] pass over some verses of scripture here
[1:25:01] uh and come back to them perhaps tuesday
[1:25:03] night or another time
[1:25:05] i want to go on to john chapter 16 just
[1:25:07] a moment
[1:25:08] i want to go down to verse 12. jesus
[1:25:11] had said many things to his disciples
[1:25:14] already
[1:25:15] but he was finding out that they
[1:25:17] couldn't really bear them
[1:25:20] now that's what i was talking about just
[1:25:21] a moment ago they were not in the right
[1:25:24] mentality they were not in the right
[1:25:26] place
[1:25:27] in their mind in their in their soul
[1:25:31] to be able to receive what he had to say
[1:25:35] and i'll tell you that's a bad place and
[1:25:38] jesus knew there was a way he knew there
[1:25:40] was a way that that was going to be
[1:25:42] changed
[1:25:44] because he realized that it was easier
[1:25:47] for them to be in that place
[1:25:49] as long as he was just with them
[1:25:52] but he knew that if i can get out of
[1:25:54] here
[1:25:56] then he who lives in me can come back
[1:25:59] and live inside of them
[1:26:01] and when he comes back to live inside of
[1:26:04] them
[1:26:05] they'll find the strength they need to
[1:26:07] choose
[1:26:08] what to listen to and they will be able
[1:26:11] to receive some of the strong meat
[1:26:13] that they're not mature enough to
[1:26:14] receive in this hour
[1:26:16] one of the jobs one of the ministries
[1:26:19] one of the administrations of the spirit
[1:26:21] of truth
[1:26:22] by the holy ghost in your life is to
[1:26:24] bring you to a place
[1:26:26] of maturity because a more complete
[1:26:29] a more perfect revelation of jesus
[1:26:32] christ
[1:26:33] will bring us to a new level of maturity
[1:26:36] i'm telling you revelation is not just
[1:26:38] to puff you up
[1:26:39] and so you can talk loud and tell
[1:26:41] everybody you know more than they do
[1:26:43] no no no it becomes weapon
[1:26:46] i want you to know i believe that
[1:26:49] revelation
[1:26:50] by the spirit of truth has a physical
[1:26:52] effect
[1:26:53] on our own body i believe our
[1:26:56] physical body the cells of our body
[1:27:00] are affected by revelation of truth that
[1:27:03] we receive
[1:27:04] from the word i believe it can change
[1:27:07] many many things i believe it can
[1:27:10] greatly affect and rewrite
[1:27:12] our dna i believe it can bring a
[1:27:16] purification
[1:27:17] process to many sluggish systems of the
[1:27:21] body
[1:27:21] i believe that when the prophet is
[1:27:23] talking to us about
[1:27:25] see that you touch not the oil and the
[1:27:27] wine uh when he's giving us the seals
[1:27:30] he's talking about or the church ages
[1:27:33] perhaps also
[1:27:34] he's talking about the the uh
[1:27:37] revelation the the inspiration
[1:27:41] that br the intoxication that comes by
[1:27:44] revelation
[1:27:46] see that wine represents that
[1:27:49] place of what's the word is it what was
[1:27:52] the word he used
[1:27:53] stimulation thank you i could not get it
[1:27:59] i remember i remember the first time i
[1:28:01] used that word among charismatic people
[1:28:04] they thought i had said something filthy
[1:28:06] they did not like that word at all
[1:28:08] i had to explain to them what that means
[1:28:11] i said don't look
[1:28:12] don't sit there and look at me like i've
[1:28:14] just said something
[1:28:15] vulgar i want you to have anybody in
[1:28:18] this house
[1:28:19] ever ever receive something from the
[1:28:22] lord
[1:28:22] that became so invigorating and so
[1:28:26] stimulating that you no longer saw how
[1:28:29] high the wall was
[1:28:30] or how wide the troops were and you just
[1:28:33] said wow
[1:28:34] through the lord i can run over
[1:28:38] woo i can get over the wall i can run
[1:28:41] through the troop
[1:28:42] it didn't change how high the wall was
[1:28:45] didn't change how mighty the troop was
[1:28:47] it changed how you felt about your walls
[1:28:51] it changed how he felt about the armies
[1:28:54] that were before him and
[1:28:56] and you know there's nothing like it
[1:28:58] there's nothing like
[1:28:59] the holy spirit pouring inspiration on
[1:29:02] something that's been stirring around in
[1:29:04] you
[1:29:05] and you become uh stimulated
[1:29:08] to run on to to kick the devil
[1:29:14] has he ever kicked you the rest of you
[1:29:18] are silent
[1:29:20] he may not kick you because he may be
[1:29:22] controlling you
[1:29:24] you might ought to start kicking him and
[1:29:26] see who's really in charge
[1:29:28] jesus said in john 16 12 i have yet many
[1:29:31] things to say unto you
[1:29:33] but you cannot bear them now
[1:29:38] i like this in the amplified
[1:29:42] i'm going to read several of these
[1:29:43] sayings of jesus in the amplified
[1:29:46] in the same same place 16 12. he said i
[1:29:49] have
[1:29:49] still many things to say to you
[1:29:52] but you are not able to bear them
[1:29:56] or to take them up upon you
[1:29:59] or to grasp them now
[1:30:04] you need something to come along and
[1:30:06] help you
[1:30:07] be able to grasp some of these
[1:30:10] uh stronger things that i want to i want
[1:30:13] to share with you
[1:30:15] and so he goes on to say there's a way
[1:30:17] being made
[1:30:19] i'm not mad at you there's a way being
[1:30:21] made
[1:30:22] that you're going to be able to grasp
[1:30:26] and get a hold of what you can't get
[1:30:28] ahold of now look at verse 13
[1:30:30] king james he said howbeit
[1:30:33] when he whoo i'm going to wait on you
[1:30:36] because
[1:30:37] i want them to see it there's three
[1:30:40] places in the book of john
[1:30:42] where jesus talks about the spirit of
[1:30:44] truth
[1:30:46] and i want you to see all three here's
[1:30:48] the second one
[1:30:49] he said howbeit when he the spirit
[1:30:53] of truth is come he will
[1:30:59] can't you hear him preaching on the god
[1:31:01] can't you hear him preaching on the god
[1:31:04] he will guide you
[1:31:08] into all truth don't you tell me you've
[1:31:11] heard three messages you not
[1:31:12] you got it all
[1:31:17] i stood in a jungle in uganda africa one
[1:31:19] time
[1:31:20] with a single light bulb hanging down
[1:31:22] and a preacher who was opposing me
[1:31:24] and they took me to meet him because he
[1:31:26] was filling up the mailbox
[1:31:28] with all of these hundred page letters
[1:31:30] he was writing
[1:31:31] about how wrong i was to call names in
[1:31:34] the pulpit
[1:31:35] the problem was the name i called was
[1:31:38] not a thunder preacher like he thought
[1:31:40] he was
[1:31:40] he was a newscaster
[1:31:45] his name was cronkite
[1:31:50] howard is it howard cronkite walter
[1:31:53] oh there's a lot of old folks here today
[1:31:59] i don't know how many evenings i spent
[1:32:01] with my grandparents in walter
[1:32:04] very distinguished fellow of me wide
[1:32:07] hair and big bushy
[1:32:08] mustache and i said at one time
[1:32:10] preaching in the early 90s i don't care
[1:32:13] what walter cronkite says about it
[1:32:18] and he wrote a hundred pages on why i
[1:32:20] shouldn't be calling other preachers
[1:32:22] names in the pulpit
[1:32:24] on his way to coal mine
[1:32:30] and he found a few other things like
[1:32:32] that
[1:32:34] and uh so we went and met him and they
[1:32:36] took me over there
[1:32:38] and he has i'm not making fun and i want
[1:32:41] you to know we didn't leave that man in
[1:32:43] that condition
[1:32:44] we made sure he got everything he needed
[1:32:48] to decide what the truth was he still
[1:32:50] couldn't be helped
[1:32:52] i won't tell the rest of the story but
[1:32:54] sister knows the rest of the story very
[1:32:56] very serious and very very
[1:32:58] tragic in many many many years later to
[1:33:00] that but we certainly tried
[1:33:02] you you can put it in front of people
[1:33:04] but that don't necessarily mean they'll
[1:33:05] get it
[1:33:05] but he got over in my face i can see his
[1:33:08] big teeth
[1:33:08] and he got over my face like that and he
[1:33:11] said i know
[1:33:12] the message of the hour
[1:33:15] and i know that you're calling blah blah
[1:33:18] blah no no no no no no
[1:33:20] and i said brother show me how you know
[1:33:21] it show me how it come to you
[1:33:23] and he had a little stack of spoken word
[1:33:25] books about that about that thick i
[1:33:27] don't know how many sermons were there
[1:33:29] and maybe maybe two or three or four or
[1:33:32] five cassettes i don't remember how many
[1:33:33] but they were just stacked like that
[1:33:35] that's precious and i know what the
[1:33:38] prophet said
[1:33:39] it only takes one one message to reach
[1:33:42] them
[1:33:44] but i want you to know you hear them all
[1:33:46] and read them all
[1:33:48] and it not be yet a part of who you are
[1:33:51] so if it were not for the spirit of
[1:33:53] truth you could listen to all the
[1:33:55] messages that god's given us in this day
[1:33:57] read all the books and still not know
[1:34:00] any more
[1:34:00] than you knew when you started because
[1:34:02] it's not getting more information that
[1:34:04] helps you
[1:34:05] it's when the when the spirit of truth
[1:34:07] rises up in you
[1:34:09] and he starts saying amen then it goes
[1:34:12] deeper than the intellect
[1:34:14] that's when it drops from the head to
[1:34:16] the heart
[1:34:18] hallelujah and before it's over he puts
[1:34:20] it in your hands and your feet
[1:34:21] so that you can walk it out so that you
[1:34:23] can live it
[1:34:25] it's not how much of the word of god you
[1:34:26] go through it's how much of god's word
[1:34:29] goes through you
[1:34:30] there's a digestion that takes place and
[1:34:32] i want you to know the spirit of truth
[1:34:34] is
[1:34:34] actively involved in helping you
[1:34:38] to digest to receive the truth
[1:34:41] and there is a transformation that takes
[1:34:44] place
[1:34:44] in our lives because of the spirit of
[1:34:47] truth
[1:34:47] whether we're aware of it or not can
[1:34:49] anybody say amen
[1:34:51] now he goes on how be it when he the
[1:34:54] spirit of truth is come
[1:34:56] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:34:59] shall not speak of himself
[1:35:04] but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:35:08] the spirit of truth the spirit of truth
[1:35:12] somebody's talking to the spirit of
[1:35:14] truth
[1:35:16] what he shall hear that shall he speak
[1:35:22] that's the godhead you see how they work
[1:35:25] together
[1:35:27] you see how there's three distinct
[1:35:29] offices
[1:35:30] but of the same spirit one god not three
[1:35:33] people trying to get it right
[1:35:35] come on now here jesus said he's not
[1:35:38] gonna come and talk about himself
[1:35:41] he's going to speak what he hears do you
[1:35:44] know anybody else like that besides
[1:35:46] jesus
[1:35:47] because remember the bible said that
[1:35:49] jesus was not there
[1:35:51] he he waited for the father
[1:35:54] he spoke what the father was speaking
[1:35:58] he shared what the father was sharing
[1:36:00] now
[1:36:01] jesus is telling us there's another
[1:36:03] ministry
[1:36:04] the spirit of truth by the holy ghost
[1:36:07] when he comes
[1:36:09] he will not speak of himself he will
[1:36:12] speak what's spoken to him just like
[1:36:13] jesus
[1:36:15] so where does it come from the eternal
[1:36:17] spirit it comes from what there was in
[1:36:20] the beginning
[1:36:21] it comes from father it comes from papa
[1:36:24] it comes from abba anybody with me
[1:36:27] he will wait and hear what is spoken to
[1:36:30] him
[1:36:30] and he will show you things to come
[1:36:34] because there's a voice even working now
[1:36:36] let me read that in the amplified
[1:36:38] and i'm going to wait on you to to uh to
[1:36:40] pull that up i didn't give you
[1:36:42] much time while ago not even a warning
[1:36:45] here's a bit of a warning
[1:36:46] john 16 13 in the amplified
[1:36:49] all red letters i wish you could see how
[1:36:52] red it is
[1:36:54] it is red letters here he said
[1:36:57] but when he the spirit of truth
[1:37:00] the truth-giving spirit comes
[1:37:04] he will guide you into all the truth
[1:37:08] parentheses the whole full
[1:37:12] truth for he will not speak his own
[1:37:15] message
[1:37:17] on his own authority but he will
[1:37:20] tell whatever he hears from the father
[1:37:24] he will give the message that has been
[1:37:28] given to him
[1:37:29] well does that help anybody i like that
[1:37:32] and he will announce and declare
[1:37:36] to you the things that are to come that
[1:37:40] will happen in the future that's who he
[1:37:43] is
[1:37:44] he comes not just to reveal the future
[1:37:46] but he comes
[1:37:47] to speak in us what the father's saying
[1:37:51] you want to know the father's heart the
[1:37:53] holy ghost is here to tell you
[1:37:55] you want to know how the father feels
[1:37:57] about you and your life the holy ghost
[1:37:59] is here to talk for him
[1:38:00] you understand same spirit it's just a
[1:38:03] different ministry
[1:38:04] because the spirit of the father when he
[1:38:06] operates his father he's above you
[1:38:09] when he operates his son he's with you
[1:38:11] when he operates his holy ghost where is
[1:38:13] he
[1:38:13] you say that all the time glad you
[1:38:16] noticed
[1:38:18] that wasn't a senior moment that time i
[1:38:20] meant to say it again i'm going to say
[1:38:22] it again before i stop here probably
[1:38:24] and i'll probably say it again tuesday
[1:38:25] night because i cannot get enough
[1:38:28] of this revelation of who this is
[1:38:32] living inside of me not an imposter
[1:38:35] not just an ambassador but one who has
[1:38:38] full governmental authority
[1:38:40] in my life he has got the authority
[1:38:43] would you give me a
[1:38:44] the paragraph if you will number 12 from
[1:38:47] the message
[1:38:48] god
[1:38:52] this is a is a small commentary on the
[1:38:55] verse i just read
[1:38:57] he said now in this 13th verse how be it
[1:39:00] when the spirit of truth is come he will
[1:39:04] guide you
[1:39:07] unto all truth when the spirit of truth
[1:39:12] is come
[1:39:13] he will guide you into all
[1:39:16] truth not just unto that's up to the
[1:39:19] door
[1:39:20] but into that's through the door he said
[1:39:23] he will guide you
[1:39:24] into all truth he said what is
[1:39:27] truth do you remember who asked that in
[1:39:29] the book of acts
[1:39:31] what is truth and how many of you know
[1:39:35] he was told he got the message
[1:39:38] what is truth what is truth
[1:39:43] the word the word see it with me
[1:39:47] somebody
[1:39:48] the word whose word his
[1:39:51] word the word of the father made
[1:39:54] real to you by the holy ghost
[1:39:58] quickened to life that was the first
[1:40:01] office that's the first ministry of the
[1:40:03] holy ghost the spirit of life
[1:40:05] he resurrects he takes a word
[1:40:08] that can be used as a dead letter
[1:40:12] and he breathes on it and he brings it
[1:40:16] to life oh you become a dynamo
[1:40:23] you become a dynamo i didn't mention
[1:40:26] that
[1:40:27] i i didn't even give you that i skipped
[1:40:30] around but
[1:40:32] let me just go back just a moment see if
[1:40:34] i can see that
[1:40:36] it's that it's that word power that we
[1:40:39] talk about in acts one and eight but you
[1:40:41] shall receive
[1:40:42] dunamis you shall receive power
[1:40:45] and it's from that word dunamis that we
[1:40:48] get the word dynamo
[1:40:49] let me tell you the two things a dynamo
[1:40:51] is
[1:40:52] a dynamo is a device capable of
[1:40:55] producing
[1:40:56] or reproducing electricity specifically
[1:40:59] a direct current
[1:41:03] but when the spirit has come upon you
[1:41:06] you shall be capable
[1:41:09] of reproducing electricity of a
[1:41:12] particular
[1:41:13] current and then number two is
[1:41:17] an extremely energetic and forceful
[1:41:20] person
[1:41:25] see sometimes what others condeme you
[1:41:26] for
[1:41:29] is what the holy ghost came to make you
[1:41:33] now we've all got a place we've got a
[1:41:36] position to minister in and to serve in
[1:41:39] we can talk about the authority of the
[1:41:40] family and so forth and etc and
[1:41:43] who's to handle the word and not to
[1:41:45] handle the word we can go through god's
[1:41:46] plan there's
[1:41:47] i love it i love it i'm not against it i
[1:41:50] love it
[1:41:52] but i want you to know the holy ghost
[1:41:53] has come to make you a dynamo
[1:41:55] a force to be reckoned with and it's not
[1:41:58] your spirit that gets amplified and
[1:42:00] magnified
[1:42:01] it's his spirit and when your spirit is
[1:42:04] joined with his spirit
[1:42:05] i want you to know he becomes a dynamo
[1:42:07] inside of you
[1:42:08] and you're going to be a little
[1:42:12] energetic
[1:42:14] but you don't know how i feel oh yes i
[1:42:17] do it's obvious
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:21] more people know how you feel than you
[1:42:23] think you make it pretty obvious
[1:42:26] but i want you to know there's a dynamo
[1:42:32] living inside of you whoa
[1:42:35] he's not trying to just see how smart he
[1:42:37] can make you
[1:42:39] he's there the truth does something i
[1:42:41] want you to know the truth does
[1:42:42] something in us
[1:42:44] the truth accomplishes something in us
[1:42:46] are you with me
[1:42:48] for he shall speak what is truth the
[1:42:50] word
[1:42:51] for he shall speak he shall not speak of
[1:42:54] himself
[1:42:54] but what he hears he'll speak what he
[1:42:57] hears he'll speak
[1:42:58] other words he'll be the one that will
[1:43:01] reveal the thing
[1:43:02] you see yes i see
[1:43:06] hallelujah i'm glad i do see
[1:43:10] and the fourth chapter of hebrews the
[1:43:12] bible said
[1:43:13] that the word of god is sharper more
[1:43:16] powerful than a two-edged sword a
[1:43:19] discerner of the thoughts of the mind
[1:43:21] the heart see
[1:43:23] what he hears he'll speak and he will
[1:43:26] show you things to come
[1:43:28] see what's going to do that listen
[1:43:31] the holy spirit who will come
[1:43:35] in the name of the lord jesus
[1:43:38] that's the god that's the god you don't
[1:43:42] have to hire him
[1:43:43] you don't have to find him you don't
[1:43:45] have to wait for him to work you in
[1:43:47] on his calendar he lives in
[1:43:50] you by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:43:53] if you're not sure he does
[1:43:54] you better get sure
[1:43:58] you better make sure because when he
[1:44:01] comes
[1:44:02] and when we yield he's going to change
[1:44:04] our behavior now i want to tell you
[1:44:06] something here
[1:44:07] i'll get to this when we talk about the
[1:44:09] spirit of holiness
[1:44:11] and uh we'll get to it a little later we
[1:44:13] have to get adoption in
[1:44:15] and then we'll get to the spirit of
[1:44:16] holiness but i want to talk to you for
[1:44:18] just a second here
[1:44:19] and just kind of insert this in your
[1:44:20] mind there are
[1:44:22] there is an old mentality that came from
[1:44:25] pentecost
[1:44:26] from our background that you've got to
[1:44:28] get to a certain place
[1:44:30] you know you you've got to fulfill a
[1:44:31] certain percentage
[1:44:33] of the of the word before you can
[1:44:35] receive the holy ghost
[1:44:40] i've been in services as a boy where
[1:44:42] they would get a woman a sweater
[1:44:44] to cover up her elbows so she could
[1:44:47] receive the holy ghost
[1:44:50] they were well-meaning because they knew
[1:44:53] there were some old dirty men in the
[1:44:55] church i'm sure that were lusting after
[1:44:56] women's elbows
[1:45:01] this was the mentality the mentality was
[1:45:04] we got to do this so we can get the holy
[1:45:06] ghost
[1:45:08] i don't know how many people would feel
[1:45:10] like they couldn't get the holy ghost
[1:45:12] because they were still struggling with
[1:45:14] cigarettes
[1:45:16] he said well god's not going to dwell in
[1:45:19] an unclean vessel
[1:45:20] he didn't come to live in a smokehouse
[1:45:25] they they i remember i remember i
[1:45:28] remember
[1:45:30] i remember the things they said they
[1:45:31] meant well
[1:45:34] i'm not at all criticizing where they
[1:45:37] were
[1:45:38] that's where they were but i want you to
[1:45:40] know the first person
[1:45:42] i hate to say this but the first person
[1:45:44] i ever heard to say any better was my
[1:45:46] grandmother
[1:45:47] i've told you many times she said i just
[1:45:49] can't accept that
[1:45:51] she said i just have to believe the holy
[1:45:52] ghost will sometimes fill you
[1:45:54] on a credit
[1:45:58] she said how else are you ever going to
[1:46:01] get rid
[1:46:02] laid down the things that are in your
[1:46:05] life
[1:46:07] brother branham took us to a whole other
[1:46:09] level he taught us that all those things
[1:46:11] are attributes of what sin really is
[1:46:15] it's not getting rid of the drink it's
[1:46:16] not getting rid of the cigarettes it's
[1:46:18] not getting rid
[1:46:19] that's not the sin problem the problem
[1:46:21] is the unbelief
[1:46:23] and when we get rid of the unbelief it
[1:46:25] helps us have strength and power
[1:46:27] when he the spirit of truth has come so
[1:46:31] i don't know if that's the right
[1:46:32] terminology it's probably not very
[1:46:34] theologically sound to say
[1:46:35] the holy ghost fulfill you on a credit
[1:46:37] but i want you to know you invite him
[1:46:40] wake up your neighbor you
[1:46:43] invite him he'll come and he'll give you
[1:46:47] strength if you bless him if you let him
[1:46:50] if you let him he'll give you strength
[1:46:52] to lay down the thing that is trapping
[1:46:54] you and tripping you
[1:46:55] and taking you further away from the
[1:46:57] things of god and one of the reasons why
[1:46:59] the holy ghost wants to help you
[1:47:01] it's not because god can't tolerate your
[1:47:03] stuff
[1:47:05] he wants wants to give you power over it
[1:47:07] because it's not holy it's not clean
[1:47:09] he wants to bring you out of uncleanness
[1:47:11] but that's not why he's doing it because
[1:47:13] he can't stand your stuff
[1:47:14] he loves you he wants to help you with
[1:47:17] your junk
[1:47:19] he does that because he knows if he can
[1:47:21] get inside of you and fill you up
[1:47:25] i'll i'll read you another quotation in
[1:47:27] a moment
[1:47:28] you'll find strength to start pushing
[1:47:30] things
[1:47:32] things you could never get over things
[1:47:35] you could never get over before
[1:47:38] oh i thank god for this sanctifying work
[1:47:41] of the holy ghost
[1:47:42] i thank god that the blood and the
[1:47:44] spirit of god
[1:47:45] is still working in us we didn't get it
[1:47:48] all overnight no no no no no the holy
[1:47:50] spirit now
[1:47:51] we can't really know the fullness of god
[1:47:54] without engaging the spirit of truth
[1:47:57] we can learn of him but to know him
[1:48:01] to know him it's not something we do
[1:48:04] because we've been to sunday school
[1:48:06] that's not how we know him we learn of
[1:48:09] him
[1:48:10] we learn of him but it's more than that
[1:48:13] it's engaging it's allowing it's
[1:48:16] yielding to
[1:48:18] somebody say yielding to it's yielding
[1:48:20] to the spirit of truth
[1:48:22] because you know what you you keep
[1:48:24] shutting him down
[1:48:28] you keep arguing with him he'll hold his
[1:48:30] peace
[1:48:32] brother branham explained it he said
[1:48:34] it's like a bird
[1:48:37] you've disturbed him thank god he don't
[1:48:39] forsake you i'm not going to preach a
[1:48:41] doctrine hear this not
[1:48:42] bible you see i don't believe there's
[1:48:45] such a thing as being unfilled with the
[1:48:47] holy ghost
[1:48:48] there's such a thing as being filled
[1:48:50] again more
[1:48:51] more refilled he said refilled fill me
[1:48:54] up fill me up fill me up
[1:48:56] but i know what can happen you can quit
[1:48:58] listening to him
[1:49:00] and you grieve him which is sin by the
[1:49:02] way and we want to be very careful how
[1:49:04] we handle that
[1:49:05] right because this is the holy ghost
[1:49:07] we're talking about and
[1:49:09] and because the atmosphere of your life
[1:49:11] is a little muddled
[1:49:12] he'll just take his flight and find a
[1:49:14] little perch right out right out there
[1:49:16] he said this happens in a church
[1:49:17] sometime
[1:49:20] he'll just take a little just take a
[1:49:22] little flight he's still watching over
[1:49:24] he's he hasn't gone far
[1:49:26] but he's looking for the right kind of
[1:49:28] nature
[1:49:31] he's looking for the lamb's nature how
[1:49:34] many of you know the dove is always
[1:49:35] looking for the lamb's nature
[1:49:38] my my my that's the truth we can't
[1:49:41] really
[1:49:42] know god not really know him the way we
[1:49:45] want to know him
[1:49:46] without listening without engaging
[1:49:47] without cooperating with the spirit of
[1:49:49] truth
[1:49:49] because we can't receive anything that
[1:49:51] god has for us
[1:49:53] in the light of his word if the holy
[1:49:55] spirit does not illuminate that word
[1:49:57] and make it alive brighten to us
[1:50:00] look at john chapter 16 and i'll hurry
[1:50:04] i will i'll push a little quicker i'll
[1:50:07] stay on
[1:50:07] try to stay on point a little more john
[1:50:09] chapter 16
[1:50:10] and verse 15 in king james first and
[1:50:13] then i'm going to read it an amplified
[1:50:15] since it's just a verse
[1:50:16] all things that the father hath
[1:50:21] are mine this is what color
[1:50:25] this is red letter
[1:50:29] this is jesus talking he said
[1:50:32] all things that the father hath are mine
[1:50:35] therefore
[1:50:36] said i that he shall take of mine
[1:50:42] and shall show it unto thee
[1:50:48] oh the work of the holy ghost
[1:50:52] things that the father hath are mine
[1:50:54] jesus said
[1:50:55] therefore said i jesus that he shall
[1:50:59] take of mine
[1:51:00] jesus and shall show it
[1:51:04] unto you believer look at the amplified
[1:51:08] i like it it says everything that the
[1:51:12] father
[1:51:13] has is mine
[1:51:17] he said this is what i meant when i
[1:51:20] said that he the spirit will take the
[1:51:24] things that are mine
[1:51:25] and will reveal declare disclose
[1:51:28] transmit it
[1:51:32] to you you've got the holy ghost
[1:51:35] the spirit of truth lives in you you've
[1:51:37] got the receiver
[1:51:40] you've got the antenna that you need to
[1:51:44] pick up the signal
[1:51:46] of what has already been said of the
[1:51:49] father
[1:51:50] to jesus because truth
[1:51:54] is not an inanimate emotion
[1:51:58] or some blob
[1:52:03] something without definition
[1:52:07] truth is not a concept
[1:52:10] or an idea truth is what
[1:52:15] truth is a person
[1:52:18] are you awake truth is a person
[1:52:23] his name is jesus christ tell me what
[1:52:26] his name is
[1:52:29] jesus christ could i have paragraph
[1:52:33] 5 of 2c jesus
[1:52:36] chicago
[1:52:40] he says in paragraph 5
[1:52:43] i am very thankful
[1:52:46] that this spirit of truth
[1:52:49] was to be with us to the end
[1:52:55] let's just put a pause there for just a
[1:52:57] moment
[1:53:00] why do you need the spirit of truth to
[1:53:02] the end
[1:53:04] once you come to the message don't you
[1:53:05] know it all
[1:53:08] once you receive the ministry of a
[1:53:10] prophet don't you know it all
[1:53:13] once you've committed to tapes only
[1:53:14] don't you know it all
[1:53:18] why would we need the spirit of truth
[1:53:21] all the way up to the end
[1:53:22] it's the same reason why we need the
[1:53:24] father ministry since we mentioned
[1:53:26] it we need it until
[1:53:29] we need it all the way up until we can
[1:53:33] come together
[1:53:34] in the unity of faith god's got a
[1:53:36] complete work
[1:53:37] that he wants to accomplish in his bride
[1:53:39] church
[1:53:40] and we're going to need the spirit of
[1:53:43] truth
[1:53:44] because i want to tell you something if
[1:53:46] we
[1:53:47] bite and devour and fight one another
[1:53:51] based on quotes
[1:53:55] then we are no better than the
[1:53:56] denominations
[1:53:58] who also lift scripture verses out of
[1:54:01] context
[1:54:03] if we're guilty of taking brother
[1:54:05] branham's words and lifting them out of
[1:54:07] the context of which they were spoken
[1:54:09] so that we can win an argument
[1:54:12] oh i'm preaching to somebody may not be
[1:54:14] nobody here i don't know
[1:54:15] but i'm preaching to somebody then we're
[1:54:18] no
[1:54:18] we're no more uh we're just as guilty
[1:54:22] as the denominational spirit
[1:54:26] that lifts the verses out of context
[1:54:29] and uses them to fight one another
[1:54:34] you see somebody following the spirit of
[1:54:36] truth
[1:54:37] is not going to be thrown off by how
[1:54:40] many people fell off a bridge
[1:54:44] those who are following the spirit of
[1:54:46] truth are not going to be thrown off
[1:54:49] by by the by the most popular facebook
[1:54:52] group
[1:54:53] who's there to point out all the
[1:54:55] humanity
[1:54:57] leaving out all the spirituality
[1:55:01] come on you can read an article i don't
[1:55:03] care how many articles you read
[1:55:06] ah you most of those not all of them and
[1:55:09] most of them
[1:55:10] are written by people who already now
[1:55:13] have
[1:55:13] such a sellout they have such a sellout
[1:55:16] spirit on them
[1:55:18] there's really no way to describe it
[1:55:20] except to call it what it is it's a
[1:55:22] judah spirit
[1:55:24] and they're already so under the
[1:55:25] influence of that judas spirit
[1:55:27] that they don't even realize what
[1:55:29] they're doing by picking and choosing by
[1:55:32] choosing rather to focus on the humanity
[1:55:34] of a man
[1:55:35] instead of all the miracles
[1:55:38] all the supernatural and here's what i'm
[1:55:41] going to focus on not the miracles
[1:55:43] not the supernatural i'm not even going
[1:55:45] to focus on the gift
[1:55:46] what i'm going to focus on is the
[1:55:48] dovetailing
[1:55:51] of scripture and revelation truth
[1:55:54] boy when this message is laid up against
[1:55:57] that word
[1:55:58] and if it fills in there so tight that
[1:56:01] you can't get a little drop of oxygen
[1:56:03] through there
[1:56:03] i'm telling you i'm going to stand in
[1:56:05] that i'm going to hide in that
[1:56:07] that's what i'm going to hide in in this
[1:56:08] hour i'm not going to be moved here and
[1:56:10] there
[1:56:11] by those who think they know more
[1:56:12] they're always going to be people
[1:56:16] who think they know more than the ones
[1:56:17] that have lived it
[1:56:20] yes ma'am i'm going to tell it because
[1:56:22] it's the truth
[1:56:24] but that doesn't change things for you
[1:56:26] you've got to stay with the word
[1:56:28] stay with the truth he said uh
[1:56:31] i am very thankful that the spirit of
[1:56:33] truth was to be with us
[1:56:35] to the end to the end
[1:56:39] and that spirit of truth is none other
[1:56:43] you wanna know what this is in here what
[1:56:46] it is in your life
[1:56:48] it is none other but the lord jesus
[1:56:50] himself
[1:56:52] in spiritual form
[1:56:55] spirit form that's what the holy ghost
[1:56:58] is
[1:57:01] jesus in spirit form
[1:57:04] hallelujah that's what he said i'm not
[1:57:08] going to leave you
[1:57:08] i'm going to come to you i'm going to
[1:57:11] make sure you don't have to do this by
[1:57:13] yourself
[1:57:14] so he said the spirit of truth is none
[1:57:16] other but the lord jesus himself
[1:57:18] in spiritual form for he said a little
[1:57:20] while and the world seeth me no more
[1:57:23] come on brother it is good sister it is
[1:57:26] good
[1:57:27] because it's a real understanding of the
[1:57:29] word
[1:57:30] for he said a little while the words
[1:57:32] world seeth me no more
[1:57:33] yet you shall see me for i'll be with
[1:57:35] you
[1:57:36] that's good that's good even in you
[1:57:40] how long to the end of the world
[1:57:44] and that means tonight listen that means
[1:57:47] tonight
[1:57:48] and wherever we are we have
[1:57:52] the comforting words of knowing
[1:57:55] that jesus will be with us
[1:57:58] oh how long is he going to be with us
[1:58:00] till the end
[1:58:03] you tell me where the end is for the
[1:58:04] believer
[1:58:06] because we're going to step out of time
[1:58:07] one of these days and go live in the
[1:58:10] realm where he lives
[1:58:11] where there is no time but in eternity
[1:58:14] so how long is he going to be with us
[1:58:15] and in us
[1:58:16] forever oh this is a finished work
[1:58:20] now somebody one brother was was uh
[1:58:23] recommending was recommending the
[1:58:26] service he
[1:58:27] he sent us a beautiful email and he said
[1:58:30] last sunday i think it was last sunday
[1:58:32] he was ill
[1:58:33] and not able to go to his church and he
[1:58:34] was he was getting ready to tune
[1:58:36] in to his service and saw on facebook
[1:58:40] where our service popped up and he just
[1:58:42] felt like he ought to watch it now i'm
[1:58:44] not recommending
[1:58:45] that someone miss their service online
[1:58:49] to see our service i'm not recommending
[1:58:51] that because
[1:58:52] you you have a church if you have a
[1:58:54] church well you want to be
[1:58:56] faithful to that church and these are
[1:58:58] archived and you can go back and watch
[1:59:00] them another time
[1:59:01] but i'm glad he did because
[1:59:05] he wrote of what kind of help he got
[1:59:08] and what kind of a blessing he got so
[1:59:10] i'm not i'm not thinking that's the best
[1:59:12] way to do you
[1:59:13] you should stay faithful and loyal and
[1:59:15] plugged in and connected to your church
[1:59:17] and
[1:59:17] but maybe he didn't know for sure he
[1:59:19] could get back and see it again
[1:59:21] and so after it was over he went in
[1:59:24] and recommended it to someone else
[1:59:28] and uh just tagged them in it and and
[1:59:30] some some other
[1:59:31] person a lady she watched it and she
[1:59:34] said i really like that
[1:59:36] and she said one of the reasons why is
[1:59:38] because it's not a mega church
[1:59:43] and he said no he said i was trying to
[1:59:45] counter i was looking around he said i
[1:59:46] didn't see but about
[1:59:47] 70 people there in the service and that
[1:59:49] would have been about right last sunday
[1:59:51] and he said that's what i saw well i
[1:59:54] thought about that and i thought well
[1:59:56] you know i'm not ashamed of that i'm not
[1:59:59] ashamed of that i wish we were running i
[2:00:01] believe we will be
[2:00:02] i really do believe we will be filled
[2:00:04] one day
[2:00:06] and uh like i told the chiropractor
[2:00:12] he said uh well you about to get done
[2:00:14] with the weddings
[2:00:15] i said no no we got one more
[2:00:18] and he said then i said uh about nine
[2:00:21] months down the road 12 months or so
[2:00:23] a year we'll we'll be doing the baby
[2:00:25] showers then
[2:00:27] he said reckon so i said yes i
[2:00:29] reconciled
[2:00:31] that's the way it works isn't it i said
[2:00:33] it to him that's the way it works isn't
[2:00:35] it
[2:00:35] he's not married i don't think
[2:00:38] and i said that's our idea of church
[2:00:40] growth
[2:00:42] [Applause]
[2:00:45] and he really laughed and then he told
[2:00:48] then he told me a
[2:00:49] funny pastor's joke but i'm not gonna
[2:00:50] tell it this morning but it's it's funny
[2:00:53] i'll tell you sometime when i'm not
[2:00:54] preaching it's not the place
[2:00:56] but it sure did make me laugh
[2:01:00] so listen to this paragraph here about
[2:01:01] that he said and wherever we are we have
[2:01:04] the comforting words of knowing that
[2:01:05] jesus will be with us
[2:01:07] he said too many of you people here who
[2:01:09] go to little churches
[2:01:10] no matter how small the church is jesus
[2:01:13] said
[2:01:13] if even two or three were gathered
[2:01:15] together in his name he'd be with them
[2:01:18] he said what a comforting words is to
[2:01:20] know no matter how small
[2:01:22] our little congregation is yet the lord
[2:01:24] jesus is with us
[2:01:25] and we're happy for that brother that's
[2:01:28] what i tell you what that means a lot
[2:01:32] that means a lot to know that he's with
[2:01:35] us and we can keep him here long enough
[2:01:37] somebody else will want to come be where
[2:01:39] he is so i still believe
[2:01:41] that there are those to come i do i
[2:01:43] really do now look at john 14 16 oh it's
[2:01:46] 105.
[2:01:47] i'm doing pretty good i got a little
[2:01:49] more time here john 14 16

[2:01:55] kidding

[2:02:34] in the greek and it means another but of
[2:02:37] the same kind

[2:02:42] another but of the same kind and in the
[2:02:44] amplified

[2:03:13] communing with him and yielding to him
[2:03:16] the divine truth that's a person

[2:03:41] to a mature more mature relationship
[2:03:43] with god
[2:03:45] jesus was talking to the disciples he
[2:03:47] said i'm going away but don't get too
[2:03:49] upset

[2:04:02] going to be so close
[2:04:03] much closer to you than i can be
[2:04:09] because he is going to be
[2:04:18] in you
[2:04:21] the holy ghost is doing something for
[2:04:23] you that jesus could not do
[2:04:25] in his form he's coming

[2:04:44] this is hurry even
[2:04:47] the spirit of truth there's the third
[2:04:50] time
[2:04:52] whom the world cannot receive
[2:04:57] let's just go to the amplified you
[2:04:59] people can
[2:05:00] do your homework you can go back and
[2:05:01] read it in the king james let's just go
[2:05:03] to the amplified to save a minute here
[2:05:05] since i'm going there anyway
[2:05:08] the spirit of truth whom the world
[2:05:10] cannot receive
[2:05:11] welcome take to its heart because it
[2:05:14] does not see him
[2:05:16] or know him or excuse me or know and
[2:05:19] recognize
[2:05:20] him but you know and recognize him
[2:05:23] for he lives with you constantly
[2:05:28] jesus he sleeps
[2:05:32] where you're sleeping he eats a meal
[2:05:34] where you're eating a meal
[2:05:36] you know you know me they don't know me
[2:05:41] i want you to think of all the terrible
[2:05:42] things that were being said about jesus
[2:05:44] at the church on the hill
[2:05:48] he was being accused of all kinds of
[2:05:50] things
[2:05:51] insurrection blasphemy it goes on and on
[2:05:54] the list goes on and on
[2:05:56] i want you to know there are people
[2:05:57] talking about him everywhere we used to
[2:05:59] sing a song in
[2:06:00] church choir in school choir uh he was
[2:06:02] the talk of the town
[2:06:04] anybody i think dottie ramble wrote it
[2:06:07] he was the talk of the town
[2:06:08] some folks were lifting him up
[2:06:12] others were putting him down he was
[2:06:14] healing the lame in the temple
[2:06:17] delivering souls that were bound he was
[2:06:20] a man of fame the devil knew him by name
[2:06:23] he was the talk of the town the church
[2:06:27] on the hill
[2:06:27] had plenty to say about jesus
[2:06:31] but he said you know me because you're
[2:06:34] living with me
[2:06:36] you're spending time you want to know
[2:06:37] somebody you spend a little time with
[2:06:39] them
[2:06:39] and i i you spend a lot of time with
[2:06:42] them
[2:06:43] because it's you only so long you can be
[2:06:45] on your best behavior
[2:06:49] you know we do this we we use this
[2:06:51] phrase sometimes doing life
[2:06:53] that's what i'm talking about do in life
[2:06:55] we do life with them
[2:06:58] then you see them when they're up and
[2:07:00] you see them when they're down
[2:07:02] and you see them when they're in between
[2:07:03] and that's when you really know who they
[2:07:04] are
[2:07:06] it's too bad it has to be after marriage
[2:07:14] but it does don't misunderstand me
[2:07:21] can't edit live services
[2:07:25] i still mean it
[2:07:28] god had a reason and an order
[2:07:32] but i want you to know the point remains
[2:07:34] it's when you're doing
[2:07:36] life with somebody that you really learn
[2:07:40] who they are and you can hear what
[2:07:42] they're saying about him
[2:07:44] up on the hill the church on the hill
[2:07:46] but you know better
[2:07:48] because you've done life with him this
[2:07:50] is what jesus was saying he said because
[2:07:51] it does not see him or know him
[2:07:53] or recognize him but you know and
[2:07:56] recognize him
[2:07:58] who the spirit of truth he said the
[2:08:00] spirit of truth is with you
[2:08:03] it was in another form but the spirit of
[2:08:06] truth was with him
[2:08:08] but you know and recognize him for he
[2:08:10] lives with you
[2:08:12] constantly
[2:08:16] oh and then those next words
[2:08:19] and will be
[2:08:23] in you oh thank you lord thank you that
[2:08:26] you had to go
[2:08:28] jesus thank you that you thank you that
[2:08:30] you came
[2:08:32] defeated death hell in the grave thank
[2:08:35] you that you had to go
[2:08:37] because if you go if you'd win like you
[2:08:40] did
[2:08:40] then that same spirit of truth that was
[2:08:43] in you
[2:08:44] could now come and be in the life of the
[2:08:46] believer oh
[2:08:48] see church it's more than a feeling
[2:08:51] here's what i like i like the fact that
[2:08:54] we don't have to summon
[2:08:55] or invite the holy spirit i just tell
[2:08:58] you i don't believe
[2:08:59] that most charismatics out there and and
[2:09:01] probably pentecostal either i just don't
[2:09:03] think they really
[2:09:04] understand this because i'm all the time
[2:09:07] hearing them inviting the holy spirit
[2:09:10] that sounds episcopalian or something to
[2:09:11] me
[2:09:16] i'm inviting the holy spirit where do
[2:09:18] you think he is
[2:09:24] he doesn't float around the room like
[2:09:26] casper the friendly ghost
[2:09:28] come on he's in the believer
[2:09:33] jesus didn't sin the father didn't send
[2:09:36] the holy ghost
[2:09:37] so that he could be some kind of mist
[2:09:42] that was a symbol that he had come that
[2:09:45] pillar of fire
[2:09:46] licks of fire appeared as licks of fire
[2:09:48] over their head
[2:09:49] but he didn't stay how many of you know
[2:09:51] the holy ghost didn't stay over their
[2:09:52] head
[2:09:53] he came to live inside of them so who
[2:09:56] are you talking to
[2:09:59] summoning inviting the holy spirit to
[2:10:02] come
[2:10:03] as though he works some outside in
[2:10:06] ministry
[2:10:10] if you've received the baptism of the
[2:10:13] holy ghost
[2:10:14] you're not inviting him to come into
[2:10:15] your situation
[2:10:17] he's already in your situation because
[2:10:20] he's in you
[2:10:22] wait a minute they're dozing in here
[2:10:29] he's in you
[2:10:33] what do you think is going to happen
[2:10:34] that dove's going to come flying in the
[2:10:36] room
[2:10:36] when you call him it's not that we need
[2:10:39] to
[2:10:40] summon him up
[2:10:43] or beat the drum until he comes
[2:10:47] he's in us you know what you don't even
[2:10:51] have to invite him to stand up in you
[2:10:52] you just got to sit down
[2:10:56] you sit down and he'll stand up
[2:11:01] he'll rise up whoa i feel good
[2:11:06] he'll rise up i'll tell you about
[2:11:07] fireworks i feel some fireworks
[2:11:10] going off inside of me right now
[2:11:12] reminding me
[2:11:14] i don't have to beg the holy ghost into
[2:11:16] my life
[2:11:18] into my hardships he's there
[2:11:22] i just got to hush i've just got to get
[2:11:25] out of the way
[2:11:25] give him some room he'll stand up in you
[2:11:28] hallelujah no the work of the holy
[2:11:30] spirit is not an outside-in ministry
[2:11:33] it's an inside-out ministry
[2:11:36] write that down i don't see no pencils
[2:11:38] moving
[2:11:42] hallelujah it's power and promise
[2:11:46] that transforms us from
[2:11:49] glory to glory to glory
[2:11:52] to glory to glory
[2:11:58] my my my yes
[2:12:01] now look at john 14 26 you're going to
[2:12:03] think i already read this but i read
[2:12:04] john 14 16.
[2:12:06] this is john 14 26.
[2:12:10] i think we might have started but i'm
[2:12:13] going to go back to it
[2:12:18] let's go straight to the amplified
[2:12:25] thank you but the comforter counselor
[2:12:28] helper
[2:12:29] intercessor advocate strengthener
[2:12:31] standby
[2:12:32] the holy spirit whom the father will
[2:12:35] send in my name
[2:12:37] in my place whoo
[2:12:40] to represent me and act on my behalf
[2:12:45] oh this is red letter he will teach you
[2:12:48] all things and he will cause you oh i
[2:12:51] like this
[2:12:52] lord knows i need this
[2:12:55] he will cause you to recall
[2:12:58] will remind you of bring
[2:13:02] to your remembrance everything
[2:13:05] i have told you
[2:13:11] that's his work that's his ministry
[2:13:15] come on now the spirit of truth is
[2:13:17] always bringing back to our remembrance
[2:13:20] the word anybody need to remember the
[2:13:23] word
[2:13:24] how many of you need to remember what
[2:13:25] the word said when
[2:13:27] when do you need to remember what the
[2:13:29] word said all the time
[2:13:31] but especially when you're in the mess
[2:13:35] when you're in the ditch when you're in
[2:13:38] the battle
[2:13:40] because that's when that old spiritual
[2:13:42] spiritual amnesia
[2:13:44] will try to get a hold of you that's
[2:13:45] when the paradox of forgetfulness sets
[2:13:47] in
[2:13:48] and you start remembering what you ought
[2:13:50] to forget and forgetting what you need
[2:13:51] to remember that's why the holy spirit
[2:13:53] and his ministry
[2:13:54] is so powerful in our lives that's why
[2:13:57] particularly
[2:13:58] when he ministers as the spirit of truth
[2:14:00] it's such a powerful and precious work
[2:14:02] that he does
[2:14:03] because he brings all things pertaining
[2:14:05] to the word of god
[2:14:06] back to our remembrance one one of if
[2:14:09] not the key purpose of the spirit of
[2:14:11] truth
[2:14:12] is as we walk in communion and we yield
[2:14:15] to the spirit of truth
[2:14:16] that divine truth that we mentioned a
[2:14:18] minute ago is expanding in us
[2:14:20] and we are being changed and we are
[2:14:22] being brought into a
[2:14:24] more mature relationship with the father
[2:14:26] i'm going to read
[2:14:28] uh two more paragraphs
[2:14:31] and i'm going to try to be uh finished
[2:14:32] here around right at 1 30.
[2:14:35] the harvest time i'm going to read two
[2:14:39] paragraphs not together but from the
[2:14:41] same message one
[2:14:42] uh is paragraph 160 and the next is
[2:14:45] paragraph 177
[2:14:48] but jesus said when he the spirit of
[2:14:52] truth is come
[2:14:53] i'm just reading quotations that i found
[2:14:57] pertaining to the verses that we just
[2:14:58] read i like doing it that way
[2:15:02] one of these days i'd like to share
[2:15:07] some of that with you in in
[2:15:10] paper form because i've been working on
[2:15:14] that a lot
[2:15:15] over the past couple of years and that
[2:15:18] is
[2:15:19] bringing the quotes to match the verses
[2:15:22] especially from the gospels and i've got
[2:15:24] several of the epistles
[2:15:26] that are started they're not finished i
[2:15:28] don't know if i could ever
[2:15:29] live long enough to finish all the
[2:15:32] places just think about all
[2:15:33] for instance hebrews you you start
[2:15:36] putting the verses of hebrews together
[2:15:38] and then start putting the quotes like
[2:15:40] like the revelation thing that the
[2:15:41] brother did and you all are
[2:15:43] are working on to get it so we could
[2:15:44] print it for people or they could
[2:15:46] download it
[2:15:47] the places and yet when i when i look at
[2:15:49] that i find
[2:15:50] many many many many things he said about
[2:15:52] those verses in revelation that are not
[2:15:54] included in that book
[2:15:55] and it's almost like a lifetime of of
[2:15:58] gathering
[2:15:59] but but when i read a verse and then i
[2:16:02] follow that up with with
[2:16:04] what brought was brought to us under the
[2:16:06] inspiration of the holy spirit i'll tell
[2:16:08] you it
[2:16:08] it sings in me you you call me a man
[2:16:12] follower if you want to or whatever else
[2:16:13] you
[2:16:14] but it just sings in me it just really
[2:16:17] really amplifies it in my heart and so
[2:16:20] here is
[2:16:20] uh 160. he said but jesus said when he
[2:16:23] the spirit of truth is come see
[2:16:25] he will bring these things that i have
[2:16:27] taught to your memory
[2:16:30] the word i need it lord i need that
[2:16:34] and he'll also show you things to come
[2:16:37] he said there is the real spirit-filled
[2:16:39] church now stays with the word
[2:16:41] reflects the word and look at what that
[2:16:44] phrase is after that
[2:16:45] god on earth
[2:16:49] it is good it's god on earth
[2:16:53] somebody said i don't know how you can
[2:16:54] say that jesus
[2:16:56] jesus said we're just parroting what he
[2:16:59] said
[2:17:01] same god in you same god
[2:17:05] in jesus same spirit
[2:17:08] hallelujah i don't think that's off i
[2:17:11] think that's in
[2:17:14] he'll show you things to come there's
[2:17:15] the real spirit-filled church now stays
[2:17:17] with the word reflects the word god on
[2:17:19] earth see
[2:17:20] he doesn't need any theologian
[2:17:24] because his word is of no private
[2:17:25] interpretation
[2:17:27] listen how god interprets his word he
[2:17:29] interprets his own word
[2:17:31] by vindicating it and proving it
[2:17:34] it's the truth the random said he
[2:17:37] interprets it by bringing
[2:17:38] it to pass by bringing it
[2:17:42] to path
[2:17:47] i love that now look at paragraph 177
[2:17:51] he said watch now as we hurry up through
[2:17:55] when the spirit of truth is come he will
[2:17:58] teach you all things
[2:17:59] whatever i taught you oh my bearing all
[2:18:02] remembers to you
[2:18:03] what i've said to you bringing to you
[2:18:06] all
[2:18:06] remembrance and he will show you things
[2:18:09] to come
[2:18:10] he will vindicate every word confirming
[2:18:12] the word with signs following
[2:18:14] everything that he promised that god
[2:18:16] promised
[2:18:17] in the bible if you'll turn
[2:18:21] loose if you'll turn loose
[2:18:25] if you'll turn loose from every creed
[2:18:29] and everything else and do what
[2:18:33] hold on to the word
[2:18:36] god is obligated to take care of
[2:18:42] where's the word it's in you no wonder
[2:18:45] god's taking such good care of you
[2:18:48] you're a word
[2:18:52] you are a word sent from god
[2:18:56] and so when they did this
[2:18:59] the word vindicates itself
[2:19:03] i'll tell you that's powerful you've got
[2:19:05] time for one more verse

[2:47:08] wasn't free
[2:47:09] it was paid for by those who were
[2:47:11] willing to
[2:47:12] lose their lives or risk their lives
[2:47:16] we're thankful god we're thankful
[2:47:20] grieves our hearts as true patriots
[2:47:23] we're people to be ashamed of the flag
[2:47:26] and what it stands for it's not an idol
[2:47:28] to us and we don't worship it
[2:47:30] but we respect it because it represents
[2:47:34] as an ensign our nation
[2:47:38] it speaks freedom for all i don't hear
[2:47:40] that old flag saying anything
[2:47:43] that excludes somebody it includes
[2:47:46] people
[2:47:47] we all have that same opportunity
[2:47:50] and really lord this nation was founded
[2:47:53] by those looking for freedom to worship
[2:47:55] you that's what it was about not to deny
[2:47:58] you
[2:47:58] not to curse you not to mock you but
[2:48:01] they came here
[2:48:02] to serve you without the interference of
[2:48:04] the government
[2:48:06] the lord we pray for america today we
[2:48:09] pray for our leaders lord some have
[2:48:11] certainly lost their way but i know god
[2:48:14] that
[2:48:15] and the heart of the king is in the hand
[2:48:17] of the lord and i know that you're able
[2:48:19] yet to move
[2:48:21] you're able lord and we give it to you

[2:48:47] what the one right next to us sits right
[2:48:48] next to us
[2:48:49] maybe even the same house we don't
[2:48:52] always know the
[2:48:53] details of what each other's going

[2:49:27] would meet them it doesn't have to be
[2:49:28] around this altar but that'd be
[2:49:30] wonderful
[2:49:31] you could meet them in the automobile
[2:49:33] you could meet them in their home you
[2:49:34] could meet them out in the yard it

[2:49:37] but we need that refilling of the holy

[2:51:23] o'clock ready to worship the lord if you
[2:51:25] need prayer
[2:51:26] when we have dismissed the service we'll
[2:51:28] stay and pray for you
[2:51:30] we know that god can meet your need he
[2:51:32] wants to
[2:51:34] and uh it's not that
[2:51:38] in any way that we thought someone
[2:51:40] hadn't done it right or anything like
[2:51:42] that but we
[2:51:44] combined the text i think david had done
[2:51:47] some maybe josh
[2:51:48] i don't know who all had done them but i
[2:51:50] was in four group texts
[2:51:52] for the young people so we combined them
[2:51:55] into two
[2:51:57] that every person like that who would
[2:51:59] want to be interested in their
[2:52:01] volleyball
[2:52:01] going zone and whatever else they do
[2:52:03] together now everybody there was
[2:52:05] five or six people that were in no list
[2:52:08] they weren't getting the information
[2:52:10] and now they're all in and so if that
[2:52:14] worried you or wearied you or bothered
[2:52:16] you or offended you i apologize it's
[2:52:18] done
[2:52:19] and those are going to be the group
[2:52:21] texts that we're going to use from from
[2:52:23] now on
[2:52:24] forward for what goes on with the young
[2:52:26] people so that we can keep up with it
[2:52:28] there were people responding and others
[2:52:31] didn't know they were responding
[2:52:33] and so this is a way that we can get and
[2:52:35] listen if you're going to participate in
[2:52:37] something
[2:52:38] if somebody takes the time to put
[2:52:40] something together and arrange
[2:52:41] chaperones and whatever
[2:52:43] if you're going to come let them know
[2:52:46] how many of you know what a tap back is
[2:52:47] is that what you call it
[2:52:49] i don't know if they have that on
[2:52:50] android what what do they have on
[2:52:52] android
[2:52:53] you know where you can hard it or thumb
[2:52:54] it or put a thumb up or
[2:52:56] you just touch it and it'll let you if
[2:52:58] you don't have that well
[2:53:00] you can't do it then but but you can
[2:53:02] emoji
[2:53:03] uh on iphone you can just tap it and
[2:53:05] it'll give you a choice of what to do
[2:53:07] you can put a heart you can put a thumbs
[2:53:09] up you can put something somebody said
[2:53:10] you're really telling us this i really
[2:53:12] am are you really take i really am
[2:53:14] taking your time to tell you that
[2:53:16] because i just learned i think jennifer
[2:53:19] jernigan taught me
[2:53:20] some time ago she put a heart on oh you
[2:53:24] can do that
[2:53:26] you you owe people the respect you know
[2:53:28] to make a little quick response and let
[2:53:30] them know
[2:53:30] that you got the message and if at all
[2:53:32] possible if you can't go
[2:53:33] you just say okay i can't be there but
[2:53:36] that's just the way you do it how many
[2:53:38] of you know that's the way you do it you
[2:53:39] do it on your job that way
[2:53:43] when they put out something wanting to
[2:53:44] know who's going to be in a meeting you
[2:53:45] have to let them know you're going to be
[2:53:46] there
[2:53:47] or that you're not going to be there
[2:53:48] it's very difficult to plan
[2:53:51] if you don't take the time and the
[2:53:52] courtesy to be totally honest with you
[2:53:54] it's just discourteous
[2:53:56] not to do it so just take that little
[2:53:58] moment to be the outstanding
[2:54:00] young person you are young married
[2:54:02] people are on that list as well
[2:54:04] just take a moment just to let them know
[2:54:06] what you're doing charity sent out one
[2:54:07] today i didn't see many people
[2:54:09] responding if you're going to be there
[2:54:11] let them know
[2:54:12] just let people know that's good it's
[2:54:14] good isn't it
[2:54:16] yeah i'm going to wait a few more weeks
[2:54:18] and and i don't want to be that guy
[2:54:20] that bombards people with a text every
[2:54:23] week
[2:54:24] so i'm going to wait a few weeks and if
[2:54:25] i don't hear something from some of you
[2:54:27] i'm just i'm just going to assume that
[2:54:29] you've got too much to read
[2:54:30] there is so much to read and i don't
[2:54:33] need something every week
[2:54:35] i don't and my feelings are not involved
[2:54:38] in this
[2:54:38] i just don't want to bombard you if
[2:54:41] you're getting too much
[2:54:42] i don't want to be that one that's
[2:54:43] causing that to happen but
[2:54:46] it's good to to read it anyway if you do
[2:54:49] get it you ought to read it and see if
[2:54:50] there's anything the lord will use in
[2:54:52] that
[2:54:52] to speak to you about sometimes we just
[2:54:55] need to be reminded
[2:54:57] well how brothers and sisters should act
[2:54:59] toward one another
[2:55:01] and maybe some things we can't sort out
[2:55:03] but we can sort out courtesy
[2:55:09] we can be courteous we can be respectful
[2:55:12] we can show honor and respect to one
[2:55:14] another
[2:55:15] if it's just something simple like that
[2:55:16] so i encourage you to do that
[2:55:18] the young people sure do like being
[2:55:20] together they get carried away sometime
[2:55:22] in their competition
[2:55:24] but they really do love being together
[2:55:26] i'd rather them be together
[2:55:28] i'd rather them be together and i know
[2:55:30] today is an exception
[2:55:32] but i'd rather them be together and i'd
[2:55:33] rather than be on this campground when
[2:55:35] they're together
[2:55:36] than anywhere else in the world
[2:55:39] because i know what god has given given
[2:55:41] this to us for
[2:55:43] and that was to keep people as close as
[2:55:45] we possibly could to one another
[2:55:47] and it it is wonderful to have somebody
[2:55:51] to fellowship with even if it is in on a
[2:55:54] volleyball
[2:55:55] court or something like that there's
[2:55:56] going to be some fellowship for the
[2:55:58] young people here tomorrow afternoon
[2:56:00] and we're not trying to take anybody
[2:56:02] away from their family event
[2:56:03] you do family i think that is important
[2:56:07] but some folks don't have a lot of
[2:56:09] family in this area to be with and they
[2:56:11] want to be with one another so don't
[2:56:13] ever take it like
[2:56:14] someone's trying to pressure you they
[2:56:16] just want to be together
[2:56:17] i like to make it possible when we can
[2:56:20] anybody
[2:56:21] understand where we're coming from we
[2:56:23] want to pray
[2:56:24] again when we leave here today we want
[2:56:26] to pray for
[2:56:28] a crystalline and for michael
[2:56:31] uh because they're our family they're
[2:56:33] part of us
[2:56:35] and i'm sure there are details coming
[2:56:37] together that have to come together at
[2:56:38] the last minute
[2:56:40] and i'm sure there's a lot of those
[2:56:41] stresses and strains that come up
[2:56:43] and getting everybody on the same page
[2:56:45] is never easy
[2:56:47] and uh but i want the lord to just
[2:56:49] overshadow the rest of this
[2:56:51] and if you hear somebody say something
[2:56:53] like i'll be glad when this is over
[2:56:55] it's not to take away from their
[2:56:57] celebration it's just
[2:56:59] you just finally get to a place where
[2:57:01] you want to see them getting on with
[2:57:02] their life
[2:57:05] come on you just know this is it this is
[2:57:07] what's happened this is the lord's
[2:57:09] doings
[2:57:09] and we're just looking forward to being
[2:57:11] able to get on and live their life
[2:57:13] for jesus christ for him only
[2:57:16] because he's the only one worthy he is
[2:57:19] the only one worthy
[2:57:20] so how many of you will pray this week
[2:57:21] for michael and crystalline
[2:57:23] they need your prayers do you need our
[2:57:26] prayers
[2:57:32] i loved the look on both of their faces

[2:57:54] name of the lord but if you need
