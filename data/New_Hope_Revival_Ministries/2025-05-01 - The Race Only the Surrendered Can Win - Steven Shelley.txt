========================================

Description:
When the hand of the Lord lifts, even the strongest grow weak.
You can sing the songs, preach the sermons, do all the right things—and still be missing the favor and honor that only come through a surrendered, obedient life.

It's not about perfection.
It's about faithfulness.
A life that refuses cruise control.
A heart that runs hard after God—through difficulty, through dryness, through silence.

This is a call to full-throttle faith.
To breathless devotion.
To holy endurance.

Only those who truly honor Him will carry His anointing.
Only those who burn with passion will finish this race.
And only those fully surrendered will be ready when the moment comes.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and and we may not know how valuable the favor and the honor of the Lord is, but it's it's almost everything to us because if he takes his hand off and we don't see his favor anymore and we don't sense his honor anymore, we're doing it by oursel. And how many of you know you just can't run this kind of race by yourself? Without the Lord, you're not going to get very far. And that's why so many are sliding backward. It's because they've lost the honor and the favor of the Lord on their life. And they still come to church or go to church and they still raise their hands and they still sing. Some of them still preach. Uh they do all the things that church people do, but they no longer have the favor and they no longer have the honor of the Lord. And something caused that. God doesn't just take it off of you because you made one little mistake. They have allowed their lives to fall into cruise control. They still go through the motion, but their their uh feet are off the the pedals and sometimes their hands are off the wheel and they're just barely getting by. And the the Lord can't honor that kind of a life. It's an upright life. It's a righteous life. It's a holy life that he will honor. It's an obedient life. He's not uh demanding that you in your flesh should be perfect, but he is demanding that you and I in our flesh should be faithful. We can't be perfect in the flesh. We can't yet even be perfect in the realm of soul, mind, will, and emotion. There's still a battle going on in that part of who we are. And but we can perfectly make up our mind to be faithful, to be dedicated to stay with him, to hold on to him, to run the race that is set before us. No matter how difficult it gets, we must endure. God is saying, "If you honor me, I will honor you." Don't you think that you will inherit anything because of who you are or who you're related to or where you go to church. The rapture is not a church-based rapture. It's not a geographical locationbased rapture. There going to be those in every church where the truth is preached that will leave this world in a moment in the twinkling of an eye because that's the culmination of the rapture that is already in progress now. It's a process first and then it's a moment where we are changed. Hallelujah. The dead in Christ changed. We changed and together we gather and we meet the Lord together in the air. As we get closer to this translation, you can expect that God is looking for righteousness on higher levels, committedness, dedication, sanctification, consecration, obedience, on higher levels than have ever been expected before. We're coming to an hour where if we're going to have a personal individual relationship with God, we're going to have to pursue it on our own. We're no longer going to be able to blame somebody in our house, somebody in our family, somebody in our pull pit. That's keeping us at bay. I want you to know we're going to have to run after him. This message is running with all for Jesus, loving him to the finish line. Let me tell you what it takes to do that. It takes full throttle faith. You've got to pull that thing [Music] back. You've got to let the gear drop down, and you've got to let that thing roll. It takes heartpounding devotion, uncompromising pursuit, an allout surrender, a sacred determination, a relentless passion, a holy endurance, a wholehearted commitment, and a breathless devotion or you'll lose the anointing of God on your life. I'm telling you, hear me now. You'll lose the anointing on your life. The rapture isn't for those who love the Lord. Wink wink, but it's for those who have laid it all down. [Music] And realize that he only honors those who honor him. He only favors those who favor him. He only pours out his abundant blessings on those who serve him with abundant passion, full throttle faith, holy endurance.
