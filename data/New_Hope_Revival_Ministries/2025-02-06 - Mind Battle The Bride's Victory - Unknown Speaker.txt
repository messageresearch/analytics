TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but what we have failed to understand is the last battle it's not a battle from out there to inhere it's not an influence from the systems that we've been delivered from although some fall victim to that but the great battle the last one that the bride is winning yes she's winning we're winning in 2025 is a mind battle you see it's the lie in here it's the one you tell yourself it's the one the enemy Whispers to you from the inside out this is still a war zone because all of hell is turned on this little bride You Know The Enemy he is so jealous of you Satan is so jealous of you because you are already in the mind of God you are already what he wanted to be you already have authority that he wanted to have you already know his end and he knows his end and he knows that he cannot pluck you and I out of the hand of the bridegroom King the one who redeemed us with an Incorruptible price the price of his own blood he he knows that he can't change your election he can't even make you not a son so so therefore it's not your relationship with God that the enemy can have any influence over it's your fellowship I said it's your fellowship I said it's your fellowship that the enemy would like to mess up how is your fellowship amen how is your prayer life are you abiding in the vine have you discovered where real life comes from it's it's our it's our choice I I'm going to cleave I'm going to hold on to the word I'm going to lay my head on his chest I'm going to get as close to Jesus as I possibly can I'm not going to let this world affect my fellowship I must have fellowship with him and when I say that I don't just mean hearing the preaching I mean meeting him in the reality of who he is he is not only the word on page he is a Living Word a moving breathing word a walking talking word a delivering word he has an answer to mental illness you may not find it on the page but you'll find it when you've encountered The Living Word he's the same yesterday today and forever he's got an answer for anxiety he has an answer for depression he has an answer for the spirit of suicide he has an answer for the spirit of offense The Living Word has an answer for that and you'll discover that answer as you find fellowship with him telling you in order to find that perfect Fellowship we're going to find that we can't take our pastor in with us we need a pastor we needed a prophet messenger but you can't take him in he he can't go in there with you it's a place of privacy it's a place of intimacy it's a place of communion it's a place of fellowship and too many of us are missing it too many of us are missing it in our life because we're a drift we've let things come along we've pulled up our anchor three keys three important powerful steps to overcome number one keep your eyes on Jesus and off of people number two keep your eyes on Jesus and off of people number three keep your eyes on Jesus and off of people I I believe it I really believe it brother I really believe that we slip off because we've got our eyes on somebody else don't get them on your pastor don't get them on the Deacon don't get them on the neighbor don't get them on the prophet get them on Jesus see how many times you can tell somebody Jesus said Jesus said Jesus said don't be just a parrot be somebody who's had an encounter who's had Fellowship not once in your lifetime once a day twice a day three times a day there's a bride who's been called to walk in the spirit
