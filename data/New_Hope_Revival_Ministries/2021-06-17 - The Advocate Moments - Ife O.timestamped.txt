[0:00] who would choose to live in the basement
[0:03] of accusation
[0:06] hallelujah when you can be lifted up out
[0:09] of that place
[0:11] filled with the peace and the joy
[0:14] of the holy ghost
[0:23] because this is what the bride has been
[0:25] called to do
[0:26] we are to be the expression of the very
[0:30] dna of the very genes of the living god
[0:34] that was the life that was in that blood
[0:36] and that
[0:37] life is now in you it has fallen
[0:41] on you you approached him
[0:44] in faith you obeyed him in repentance
[0:48] he sanctified you by the washing of the
[0:51] water of the word
[0:52] to follow your justification and then
[0:56] baptized you with that zoy
[0:59] life god's own
[1:02] life if you remember that
[1:06] you have all the ammunition you need
[1:10] to shut down the accuser
[1:13] amen but in a weak moment
[1:16] when you don't feel the strength maybe
[1:19] you don't
[1:20] feel like you carry the gene of god
[1:23] maybe you're not feeling like a glorious
[1:26] overcomer
[1:27] we get that way sometime then you still
[1:30] have no excuse to lose
[1:32] [Music]
[1:33] because we have an advocate
[1:37] [Music]
[1:39] hallelujah we have one to
[1:42] stand up on our behalf even when we
[1:46] cannot stand up
[1:47] for ourselves he's always there
[1:51] to stand up on our behalf my what a
[1:54] blessed people we are
[1:56] so i can't spend all my time focusing on
[1:59] my accuser
[2:02] i've got to focus on the advocate
[2:06] i belong to the advocate i belong to the
[2:09] savior
[2:10] i belong to the messiah i don't serve a
[2:13] god whose enemy is stronger than he is
[2:16] i serve a god that knows how to deal
[2:18] with the enemy
[2:20] the only reason why we struggle the way
[2:22] we we do
[2:23] is because we forget who's standing up
[2:25] for us
[2:26] when you can stand up for yourself in
[2:28] the power of his might do it
[2:30] when you can stand up and quote
[2:32] scripture to the enemy
[2:34] and tell him it's written and tell him
[2:36] who your god is
[2:37] and tell him who you are do it but in
[2:40] that weak
[2:41] moment when you don't even feel like a
[2:44] christian
[2:45] if perhaps you don't even feel like
[2:47] you're a part of god's economy
[2:48] you still have no excuse to lose it's in
[2:51] that moment that you have to say holy
[2:53] ghost
[2:54] i need you to stand up jesus my advocate
[2:58] i need you to stand up brother shelly
[3:01] are you going to mismix the two
[3:04] are you going to call both jesus and the
[3:05] holy ghost the advocate i am
[3:08] are you going to call both jesus and the
[3:10] holy ghost the comforter i
[3:12] am do you know why because the word is
[3:15] the same
[3:18] the greek word is paraquatos it's the
[3:20] same word
[3:22] the same word that calls jesus your
[3:24] advocate is the same word that calls the
[3:27] holy ghost
[3:27] your comforter it's not two different
[3:31] words because it's not two different
[3:33] spirits
[3:35] what a comforter
[3:38] who cares about an accuser
[3:42] you have a comforter you have
[3:46] an advocate you have a teacher
[3:49] you have a helper you have the seed of
[3:53] god in you
[3:54] who would choose to live in the basement
[3:57] of accusations
[4:00] hallelujah when you can be lifted up out
[4:03] of that place
[4:05] filled with the peace and the joy
[4:08] of the holy ghost who is our seal
[4:12] who is our hope who is our healer who
[4:15] is our strength
