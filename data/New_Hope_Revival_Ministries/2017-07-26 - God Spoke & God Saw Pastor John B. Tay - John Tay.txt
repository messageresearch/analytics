Description:
We were so blessed to have Bro. John B. Tay with us in the studio from Ghana, West Africa. Our time with him was extremely edifying, as he encouraged us to harness the creative power of our words and speak the Word of God over every circumstance of our lives - knowing that whatever it is we speak, we create. The very same God that formed this amazing universe is living inside of us, desirous to establish His Divine will through His Bride by the power of the spoken Word!

“For with God nothing shall be impossible,” Luke 1:37.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and I have the incredible blessing today of sitting here with a dear precious friend of mine Pastor John B Tay from GH West Africa specifically from the city of TMA TMA Ghana West Africa pastor Tay and I have been friends for many years now and he has hosted me many times in his beautiful Church Bible Believers Fellowship in TMA and in some of the sister churches uh across the beautiful country of Ghana and it has been a real blessing a real privilege to have fellowship and relationship with those precious people there and we have been so incredibly blessed this weekend to have Pastor Tay preaching for us and the fellowship has been so sweet and the word of God has been so rich and we wanted to take this opport opportunity to uh let Pastor ta share with us a few of the thoughts what whatever really the Lord puts on his heart but we were so blessed in in our church on Sunday because we've been teaching and preaching on thoughts and the power of our thoughts and how we need to think right and uh on Sunday evening God used Pastor Tay to take it to the next level because words are thoughts expressed and he began to speak speak to us about words and about speaking and seeing and it it was just absolutely tremendous so uh we're just honored to have you today with us Pastor Taye can you talk to us a little bit about you started yesterday in Genesis it doesn't matter to me where you start but I was just so blessed about how you started in Genesis talking about uh the first words that God spoke and then what followed that would you share just a little bit of that with the folks who are watching this broadcast today Pastor sherley the Book of Genesis is the G story yeah every reasing we have today they have their beginning from Genesis so in Genesis we see God and we are told he is a spirit when you come to the New Testament when God let me put it this way born you or gives birth to you right you take his nature because every seed we are told in Genesis should bring forth of its own kind that's right so when you are born of God you take his divine nature you are like a god do you know crab do you know crab yes crab will never bring forth fish M no M so when God bets you you must be like God like God and we read if the spirit of God of Genesis dwells in you that's where you started yes that verse then we go to Genesis we see the spirit of that God in us today yes problem huge problem intimidating problem we see in Genesis 1 Darkness right void mhm without form what was the reaction of God that should be our reaction when we are also facing similar intimidating situations yes sir and I made it like that was the principle of first mission mhm there are certain principles in the in the Bible when it was first done right so we see God here speaking let there be light mhm he wasn't complaining or meming about the [Music] situation so that is the god that we we claim today is in US amen so that when we are faced with similar problem which we will be faced with and that God is in us when we open our mouth we must speak like he would have done or have spoken if he were confronted at that time with similar situation that's powerful yes powerful yes and then what he said he spoke he spoke and God said and God said if you watch the whole of Genesis and God said and God saw oh and it was good is running throughout the whole period of creation a theme God said God saw and it was good amen so the same God comes over here to indwell us MH and he has told us in his word that if you and me will say not even pray say to this mountain be thou removed and we don't doubt and God doesn't doubt no sir the spirit of God in us has no place for doubt amen amen no doubt so he said you will have what you you say wow so the thing is you should not say what you have because what you have is Darkness right bad circumstances yes disappointments m yes sir and what have you mhm but that God in us especially this day we should be displaying his character amen amen so that I think that was what we trying pass on to the people love I love that he spoke it and then he saw it so he saw what he spoke so you're saying that if the same spirit of God that was present in Genesis 1 if that same spirit is in us we have to be careful what we say exactly because what we speak we're going to see so I think you're teaching us that if we're speaking about the darkness or speaking about the bad circumstances all the time complaining or murmuring as you preached then that's what we're going to continue to see yes so we need to start speaking what we desire to see what God has promised us in his word exactly amen that is such a powerful truth and I love that so much in fact you you were telling us clearly that we should say what instead of saying what we have we should have what we say in whatever situation you will find yourself ask yourself if God were to be here what will he do or what will he say do that and do that wow wow that's big but that's really the daily Christian Life that's what we've been called to do that's the life we have been called to live well we sure do appreciate that there's there's one other thing that I want us to put in this little segment and that is you had us to write up on the board the word impossible yes and then you had them to separate that word impossible and on the one side we had I am and on the other side we had possible just speak about that at a moment yes as is in the gospels recorded by Luke with God nothing shall be impossible amen so God is not in the category of impossible so I cannot be in the impossible category and the English language this is semantic I don't know other languages MH looking at the word impossible just doing a separation mhm then you have I am possible and that is in line with the word of God I am possible I am possible I believe it I am possible Hall nothing is impossible with me now so it is possible for me to be everything that God says that I am that is where God wants us to be Genesis before Genesis 3 we were on the platform of dominion right be fruitful yes multiply yes have dominion MH and then the fall came then at Calvary Jesus came down and took us up and rais us up Hallelujah back to the position we were amen before the fall of ad amen so right now we are in the position of multiplication fruitfulness amen subdue and in the book of Hebrews he made us a little lower than the Angels yes but he has Crown us with Glory and Honor there you are wow so we are back on the platform of dominion amen today that when you speak God backs you if it is his word so that was another one of your points if we walk in that Dominion Authority that was promised to us in the beginning then you told us the bride is Unstoppable Unstoppable Jesus prophesy about it the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against you they will fight against you but they will not prevail against you Jeremiah said the same thing amen so we are unstoppable Unstoppable Unstoppable they could not stop the bride when the bride was launched from the book of Acts chapter 2 yes sir they brought in killing red horse rider but it could not work no they brought in the black horse rider we have doctrinal perversion yes Dark Ages came but the bride was moving on she kept marching forward kept marching and now we have reached the climax yes yes sir and this end time bride has been predestinated not to fail amen amen because in the mind of God of which we also have the mind of Christ yes sir when God looks at his church he sees a glorious church and you are the building of God you are the Church of God he is Pastor sh glorious without blemish without sport Hallelujah and he allowed John to see you right in the island of pmos Amen his wife has made herself ready so in the mind of God the Bride of Jesus Oh My is glorious Hallelujah even if you want me to go further apart from predes ated us right now he has already glorified Us in his mind amen so what can stop me amen nothing like Paul said amen nothing as for the grave and death they are just Messengers when I am tired and I want to sleep then God sends death to come and carry me to it's just a doorway to the other side other side to the real the real yes so death is just a vehicle that to come and take my servant for him to come and rest that is so encouraging Pastor thank you so much I hope you hear what the pastor is telling us today you if you are a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ you are unstoppable amen and the key is to come into agreement with God's word amen amen and don't just talk about what you see but speak what God's word says and expect to see what you speak amen that is so powerful so we will leave you with those powerful words we just ask that the Lord will seal them into your heart by the power of the Holy Spirit and that you will be all that God has called you to be in this day thank you so much Pastor Tay I appreciate it very much I'm encouraged thank you God bless you bless amen thank you amen bye-bye [Music] bye
