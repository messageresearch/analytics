Description:
The Spirit of God is sending a fresh wave of His divine searchlight into our hearts—not to embarrass or condemn, but to uncover hidden hurts, offenses, and wounds so He can heal and redeem them. This powerful message reminds us that God is never intimidated by darkness; His nature is to reveal and restore. He deeply cares about our pain, urging us to cast every care onto Him. God chose you with purpose, intending not only to begin but also to finish His work in your life. It’s time to honestly confront hidden struggles and fully surrender them to the One who promises to handle every burden we carry.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I felt like the spirit of the Lord began to minister to me that he is about to send a search light. I I appreciate that because the search light of his love, the spirit's light, the light of the Holy Ghost, he's about, I feel like, to send that again, another wave of that in our lives as individuals to to search out the things. If we're carrying scars or wounds or offense that we have not yet submitted to the blood of Jesus Christ, I believe God's not quite through digging. and he began to talk to my heart. Uh I'm going to I'm going to show uh even the deep things that that people are yet carrying. And I'm doing it for my glory, not not to embarrass anybody or or to or to condemn. May I just say this to you that God's ultimate purpose in putting his finger on your life is always redemption. It's never condemnation. It's never to judge, condemn, or cause you to feel guilty. It's to cause you to feel convicted. And when you feel convicted, guess what you do? You cry out to him, and he gets to step in and rescue you and be a redeemer of that situation. I want you to remember that God knows what darkness tries to hide. There's it's the very nature of darkness to try to conceal something. But God's got an answer for it because he revealth the deep and secret things. No plot is too hidden from him. No heart is too shadowed. No motive is too deeply buried. God is not intimidated by secrecy. It is his nature to be the revealer of secret things, good and bad and ugly. It's not just stopping the behavior. It's dealing with the issue. Why is that there? And what can I do about it? Aren't you glad all it takes is for God to turn the light of his church love on us? And then he gives grace to do something about it. It's time to to to be honest with yourself and honest before the Lord and tell him, "I'm just not what I have thought I am, but I am depending on you and you called me." See, you better know he called you. You better understand that he saw you and he called you. He saw you and he chose you. And he didn't choose you because he intended to lose you. He chose you because he intends to finish you. Because he is not just the author of our faith, but he is also the Is there anybody in this house that believes that God is a big enough God to finish what he started? Please don't live like you think he forgot you. What's to hold up you? We've got to deal with the issues of the heart. The issues of the heart or the battles of the mind. Same thing I said the issues of the heart are the battles of the mind. And this is what we have to deal with. If you're still nurturing and nursing an offense that someone gave you yesterday, you're running late. You're already defeating your own self. You are sabotaging your own victory. You You think God cares that you're hurt? He most certainly does. He may look at us sometime like we certainly ought to be a little tougher than that by now, but he cares about our hurts and he cares about our wounds. And that's why he tells us again today, casting, are you with me? Casting all of your cares on me, he said. Why? Because I want to be in your business. Yes. That's exactly what he's saying. I want to be in your business. I want to know what you're suffering with. I want to understand how you feel. You see, we do not Hebrews said we do not have a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. And he cares that you've been wounded. And he cares that you've shed a tear. And he cares that you feel like you've lost a little blood. But he tells you what to do. And it's up to you to do it. Casting all your cares. I'm preaching this morning. Casting all your cares on me, for I care for you. Get rid of it. Get it over on me. It's overwhelming to you. It overpowers you. It seems at times to overcome you. I guarantee you it won't overpower him. I guarantee you it won't overwhelm him. I guarantee you he can handle it. But he wants you to get it off of you as fast as you possibly can. Today's another day.
