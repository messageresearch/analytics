wonderful I love him so much love to watch him work because he's perfect in everything that he does my mind may try to trick me and tell me that something's not perfect but he's perfect in all he does he is perfect his ways are perfect they are past finding out Hallelujah my wife and I are certainly glad to be home with you we're so [Applause] so thankful for you praying for us for our family God has certainly been with us through the course of the last three weeks when we left you three weeks ago we did not know what awaited US when you were hearing a sermon here two weeks ago about a changing season how little did I know how much a season was about to change but God is perfect in all of his ways when I tried to get an airplane ticket so that I didn't have to drive all those miles and found that the rental cars were more than I wanted to pay so I drove god is perfect in all his ways he knew that there was something on the other end there that I needed to be there for so I drove was it easy not not really especially coming back home when it rained all day long and was foggy but God saw us through and he's faithful in all of his ways and I'm so grateful to be here today and report to you we saw God work all the way through and the the hours getting away from us so I won't take time maybe Tuesday night I'll share a little bit with you but I just want you to know we saw God work all along the way and I'm so grateful he is good he is good he is good well it was announced that the first Sunday receiving the principal offering would be moved to this Sunday so we're if you brought that with you we are going to receive that now as of to as of today there has been 250 043 dollars and 67 cents two five zero zero four three and 67 cents has been given toward this that means that the balance now stands at 219 353 dollars and 39 cents I Rejoice over this I Rejoice over that [Applause] and I would like for it to be all gone right now today but I noticed something this week and I realized that God is perfect in all of his ways you remember when he told the children of Israel I'm going to give you the land little by little because you would not be able to inhabit all of it if I gave it to you all at once and I I saw something this week that God gave to us several years ago that's not maintained and it's very ugly I'm not even going to tell you what it is it's just something I saw on this ground that God gave to us and it was beautiful then but we didn't maintain it jealous and so this is why God has to do things this way little by little because as he adds to us and we can maintain the land that he gives us then we will see him do what he said he would do he's given us the land and we want to maintain it we want to be faithful but we get all caught up in our own stuff I get all caught up in my own stuff I'm not I'm not going to put it all on you get it all caught up in my own stuff and we let God's stuff go and so then it becomes ugly but God wants us to maintain what he gives us first in the spirit in the spirit man we've got to maintain what he gives us if we don't then the devil will come along with his seeds of doubt and weeds will grow up and and trees will die and stuff doesn't get watered you know this kind of stuff but God he allows us to go through those Seasons but then he comes back along and he says I want you to maintain this I want you to maintain this that's what I see right here little by little the Lord is letting us take care of this debt so if you brought with you your offering today I want to give you opportunity to bring it and give to the Lord I'm going to ask Ian if he'll come and hold the offering bag this morning and that we will give unto the Lord what he has asked of us the tithe belongs to him this is our offering this is above our tithe we give with a grateful heart because he has blessed us if you brought it with you today I want you to hold it in your hand I'm going to ask the Lord for his Blessing on it and ask the Lord to multiply it father you you saw every person that brought their tithe and Lord I don't want to forget those that give online and they give in uh on the app and Lord they give and we bless them we bless each one that gives of their tithe and their offering for the purposes of the kingdom and Lord as we have brought this offering for the principle of the mortgage of this property and Lord I know as my voice goes out over the airwaves it there will be people who will give online so we bless them all together right now and ask God that as these seeds are planted that there would be multiplication as we are taking this land for the glory of God that it would belong to us o God we honor you and give you praise for you are good and right and perfect we give you praise and honor for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen the Lord bless you as you come and give for this principle offering today I've got not so much to thank him for thank you Lord and I've got so much to thank him for I've got so much Praise Him for your seed he's been so good to me and when I think of what he's done and where brought me from I've got so much to thank him for and I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for your seed he's been so good to me let's stand together and when I think I think of what he's done and where he brought me from I've got so much sing it again and I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you experience and when I think I think of what he's done and where it's brought me from I've got so much to thank him for him for sing it again well I've got so much so much to thank him for so much so much to praise him for you see it's been so good to me and when I think I think of what he's done and where brought me from I've got so much to thank him for all [Music] how many of you have got so much I wanna I wanna hear you if you've got so much to thank him for so much much to praise him for Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] worthy lamb you may be seated God is a good god he's a faithful God he's an on-time God he's Jesus Christ the same are you with me my I'm having to ask you this early he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever he never changes he's just as good as he ever was just as powerful as he ever was and he's worthy to be praised we're thanking God for moving and helping and all of us to be here today we know that there are still some who stand in need of prayer we didn't mention sister nakisha but we're believing that God is touching her and sister Audrey who has had another treatment uh that God is touching her and strengthening her we didn't mention sister Sharon's mother who had a pretty serious surgery this week especially at her age and God brought her through and sister Sharon is her her major caretaker and she asked me this morning she said I don't have anybody to be here the whole time but uh if I would it be all right if I Came To Worship absolutely I said come and worship with us and then the streaming and the app and everything is available for the preaching uh I appreciate helping the atmosphere to be created and would you pray for her mother that the Lord will touch her sister Alfreda and sister Weems visited my mother yesterday and I appreciate you all doing that sister Alfreda has gone several times especially first parts of the week when I am not moving too good but I appreciate it so much and I'm thankful that you all have prayed and she's in a very stabilized place and she may be here I don't know as long as God wants her here for whatever reason but we're thanking the Lord she could go tomorrow it's just that way but uh when we pray that God's will be done on Earth even as it is in heaven we accept it we know that he's good and he's God continue to pray for sister jayas mother who has had a real hard time she's had a hard time she's been through a lot and sister Jaya has got a big responsibility on her it's a long way to go down and come back and go down and we want to pray for her plus she has a job have you quit your job they're just letting you go now for now or how is that working oh how wonderful in that wonderful her job is letting her work virtually let's thank God for that because she has to have an income and we're thankful and then I also had a prayer request come in here from our friends the Gillards in uh UK and brother Stewart is having an operation this Friday and we want to believe that God will touch him and guide the doctor's hands and work miracles on his behalf and uh I I think they are up in years and they need the help of the lord well he's a helper I want to ask you all a question I want to give this little testimony for the glory of God because there's no distance in prayer and when everyone is praying we never know whose prayer has touched the Lord I like that I've met people that didn't appreciate God's system because they didn't get to take credit these are not the tent days where people lured people into their tents by the biggest testimonies that's not we're we're not in competition anymore because God doesn't send miracles to vindicate men he didn't mend he didn't vindicate brother Branham with miracles he Vindicated the word that's what he comes to confirm and to vindicate and to say Amen to but how many of you remember the little sister that was here the weekend before we celebrated Thanksgiving Sunday this couple had come all the way from Oregon for our camp meeting and uh before they went back from is it Arkansas before they went back from Arkansas to Oregon uh his mother 90 years old wanted to come and she wanted to be in a service with us and she was prayed for here she worshiped the Lord they had lunch with us and God did touch her he absolutely did touch her how many of you remember the sister I mentioned it to some and they didn't remember but you remember her well God touched her and pray people were praying I want you to know that people were praying everywhere for her and we give God the praise but she has cancer had gone into her bones is what I am told and her last six-month scan showed it growing some and had gone into the neck it was already I think in the shoulder and you know bone cancer is one of the most painful cancers and of course she was under doctor's care and they they always like to step in and take some kind look folk can I just tell you this if doctors could heal if doctors could heal cancer they could cure it do you understand if they could heal it they could stop it but they can't they can do everything that they know to do but only God can heal it now if you believe this message you believe it's a spirit brother random said it was and it has life in it well scientists tells us it has life in it well I want you to know she went back to the doctor this week for another scan and there was no trace of that cancer whatsoever God be praised best Praise Him for her Lord we praise you for our little sister on her behalf we celebrate your goodness we celebrate who you are hallelujah oh did God be the glory to God in the glory to God be the glory are Yeshua our Salvation thank you Lord thank you Lord for touching her body and healing her thank you Jesus now that's a good testimony we haven't heard of even heard hardly of testimonies like that in a long time bone cancer but God is a big God and all I know is this her faith I don't know what moment it happened but her faith made her whole her faith made her whole all I know is this my testimony to the family was this when I stood before her I had not sensed such faith in a long time I saw her like my little great grandmother I don't know why all of a sudden it was like she was my little great grandmother who wore a little bonnet who prayed who God moved for so many times and it was just like the Lord said you know I felt this I felt this her faith I felt her faith she asked for everybody's prayers but her faith many times perhaps Through The Years touched the Lord and she had wholeness and healing because of him we are programmed quite quite wrong in this hour and we hear a testimony like that we can hardly you did a wonderful job rejoicing but most of the time reasoning starts kicking in we can hardly rejoice somebody says what if it come back what if this what is that what what if the other what my my can you imagine why they're gonna they're gonna take whatever treatment she was getting whatever medications she was getting they're gonna they're gonna want everybody to have it and they're gonna find out and it's not going to be what they'd like for it to be it was her faith that touched the Lord never seen like Jesus said such great faith not in Israel here's a mother of Israel and she has touched the Lord and the Lord has proven himself again to be who he says he is so for me this morning I have no doubt of who he is I believe in how many of you believe him I believe him he confirms his word to us again and again and again now I have one little order of business that we need to take care of this morning before we bring the word and that is uh I would like to ask who is in a position you're not working late and you could do this if you can't I want to know it because I'm gonna I'm gonna let brother Benham said the majority the will of the majority is the will of God that's in church affairs we're going to claim it for church elections and church Affairs and I'm not running any church elections here but what I'd like to do is I want to uh bring a message to you and uh not this morning but I'd like to bring a message to you next weekend I can do it one of two ways we can have a service on Saturday night for those of you who are not working late and who could be here or those of you who could drag in after work and be here or we can do it Sunday morning we're going to have a Sunday morning service regardless but it might be that the subject matter would be such that it might serve a better atmosphere for for a special meeting for a Saturday night and I don't want you to feel great pressure from me but I just want to know what what you have going on and if it's something you can change uh change it if it's your job your job is how you pay your bills and it's how you pay your tithe and it's how we keep moving and several have asked about tithing if you will please put your tithing in an envelope and Market tithe because that's the only way that it's handled properly here is if you put it in an envelope and Mark it as tithe you don't even have to put your name on it if you don't want credit for it it's not your name it's not what we need but we need to know what it's designated for and someone asked me this week I thought I thought we had kind of made that but you know people forget and sometimes they're not here and they don't hear but uh I want to ask who would be able to join us next Saturday night at about six o'clock for an extra service let me see your hand all right now let me catch the hands of those who would not be able to sister Anna were you were the first person that actually popped in my mind where you'll be working she's supposed to be working next Saturday night anybody else could not be here uh Bethany and and Rachel you're working Bethany and and Rachel Morgan anybody up here because we have to have some all right let's let's meet here Saturday night at six o'clock and of course we will record and we will archive and we will let you know Tuesday night about streaming but we most likely will stream we will have uh about 30 minutes of worship and get right into it so that we can kind of finish that night it would be great that we didn't have to carry it over to to Sunday morning anybody curious I'm not a betting man but I've got a feeling some of you already know I'm going to be speaking next Saturday night on the subject why my family does not celebrate Christmas and I would like for you to come and be here there are so many questions that people have and this would be a great time to answer as many of those questions as we possibly can and as a church body we have held to that because we believe that's what the prophet taught we're not trying to be different we're not trying to steal people's fun we try to do other things to celebrate and to enjoy one another's company and to have fun but we just believe I I just believe that if you take everything watch it get tight here how will we make it till Saturday night if we take everything the word said and everything history says and everything the prophet said all of it all of it and we hold it up together we believe that I believe with all my heart that the evidence it we is is so stacked against us having hardly any part of it now there are things that we can do family is family and and there's no harm in loving our family and being with our family I can't imagine anyone enjoying going off somewhere and watching someone celebrate Christmas I don't understand the thought of that but I understand family and I understand wanting to be to see how quiet it is I understand people wanting to be together and I of all the things I understand I understand food I have no prejudice against the turkey I like him I only see him about twice a year but I have no problem with the turkey but I what I have a problem with is the gray backsliding now some people say well my family for 50 years has celebrated Christmas all right you were if that's the case and you've been in this message for 50 years someone has and their family has celebrated you are the you are a rare rare jewelry because when I heard this truth I didn't know anyone and I knew a lot of people brother Greeley did I know a lot of people back then I knew a lot of people and I didn't know anyone who put up a Christmas tree in their home and called themselves a believer of this truth I didn't know anybody and it just got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse because nobody wanted to talk about it nobody wanted to speak about it nobody wanted to preach about it now when you start looking in Pagan roots it opens a lot of doors and it shows you how the Christian church has moved way off the words in the amen's now and if you want any homework uh go this week and listen to the message uh how how did he word it Christianity a idolatry or is it paganism all right so Christianity versus idolatry can we get a year on that December 17th that's the date what's the year let's get it let's get it for sure and make it easy for people to hear that this week anybody have a copy of hislops to Babylons in your home get that out and look at it brother Brandon mentioned that didn't he 12 17 1961 and we will just I'll just show you what history says I'll show you what the word says I'll show you what the message says and then you will know again why why we do not celebrate Christmas and uh and we don't watch others we don't go and watch others celebrated either as much as we possibly can we are not against Pretty Lights you know some people think I must drive home and won't even look in a yard that's lit you know I'm just such a stiff I mean I am you know what they call me brother David they call me a scrooge [Music] and they think I'm such a scrooge that I don't even enjoy the lot I love Pretty Lights you know what I I'm so I'm so gaudy at times I would just light up the yard and leave it lit up all year long I would be that lazy neighbor I love beautiful lights and I love gifts I love to give I love to give and I love cranberry sauce and I love fruitcake there's four of us that do so I'm not as big of a Scrooge as you would think I am but I don't believe in the traditions of worshiping the sun god that I don't do not going to have any part of that so Saturday night it didn't used I want you to know that once upon a time in this church when I said something like that the people roared they roared but not anymore next Saturday night at six o'clock let's come together and just hear the facts and then when someone comes and tells you what we believe you can say no no that's not what my pastor believes he's he just took a whole session we did one one time why my wife and daughters wear skirts and I didn't try to put that on anybody just the word just history wait till I do one on necklaces and jewelry and some of those things right from history right from the message right from the word okay see how tight it gets I want the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth let's thank God for these wonderful wonderful musicians is it really well we'll just be honoring the prophet to the next Saturday night December 17th that's the date of the message Christianity versus idolatry December 17th of what did you say 61. and we'll be doing it December 17 2022 some of the very same truth God is good all the time and I wished I had a way to see how many streamers we lost no pouty lips in here don't allow them let's turn in our Bibles to Deuteronomy chapter 30. beginning in verse 11. another message that's real powerful it's not on the Christmas thing but it would answer some questions for some of you another powerful message that brother Brandon brought us is uh why why we are not a denomination why am I why I'm against organized religion you you could you could get your eyes open uh and a lot of those things you you would be a surprise how many of those Pagan Traditions just just rolled right over into the Catholic Church and how many of those Catholic Traditions from the pagans have rolled right over into the Pentecostal movement right over even into the message of the hour did you know I have gone into message churches to to take communion and then give me a little round wafer give me a little round wafer that they bought at the Bible bookstore and expect me to put that round wafer on my tongue knowing what brother Branham said about that round wafer knowing what history said about that round wafer that was a god that round wafer was a representation of the Sun God just like the star on top of the tree that wasn't new to Christmas that came out of the Pagan Worship in the Groves right in the Bible oh oh I couldn't put that round thing on my tongue somebody said what in the word are you going to do you're just going to make a big fuss about not taking communion I said no I broke it up in little pieces still there was nothing round about it I rebuked the paganism off of it and I said I sanctify this to represent for me the body of Jesus Christ and stuck it in my mouth come on now that ought not to have to happen in a church that believes the truth why why do you think God sent us a a message and a messenger to help us come together in what the word says anybody with me Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 11 don't don't hold your amens withhold them please for today because this is a good word today for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not a secret laid up I must be reading uh if you took it right from what I gave you I don't know I must be reading from the Amplified could you check that and see I'm going to just pause because I locked a couple of the phrases I can certainly let me uh okay there it is I'm so sorry and and just you all just give me a minute amp I made a mistake for this commandment which I commanded you this day is not too difficult for you nor is it far off it is not a secret laid up in heaven that you should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it to us that we may hear and do it neither is it beyond the sea that you should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear and do it but the word but the word is where it's very near you in your mouth and in your mind and in your heart so that you can do it could you give me 14 in the King James just so it will be more familiar to everyone but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it now let's read Romans 10. verse 7 through 11 and I I think that is King James it looks like it is or who shall be sinned into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what seeth it the word is neither here it is again even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach so Moses is giving a word to the children of Israel the Apostle Paul is giving the same word he is quoting from the Torah he is quoting from the instruction of the law and he is saying to them what Moses gave you we are giving you the same word amen you see there is no real conflict in the New Testament and the Old Testament many of the messianics will would rather call it a newer Testament instead of making it sound like it is a replacement it is not a replacement but it is a furtherance of the word it's God's word updated for a generation what do I think the message of the hour is I believe in my heart it is God's word that has been updated for a generation are you saying that brother branham's sermon is equal to the word the word is equal to the word so when he's preaching the word it's the same word amen so I would say the same thing about your pastor when he's preaching the word it's the same word and where is the word it's not in a listening device it's not on magnetic tape where is the word the word is very near you it's so close to you that it resides in your mouth how did it get in your mouth it's in your mind and your heart remember that's not the blood pump that's the innermost heart that is that is the womb of the spirit the womb of the spirit the word is Navy even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith and the Apostle Paul wants everyone to know we're preaching that word that's very important because in the times of the Apostle Paul everyone did not have access to the Torah there was a copy of it in the synagogue but you didn't go to the Torah bookstore like you go to the Bible bookstore and buy a Bible there was no such thing very wealthy people had Scrolls that contained a portion of the word so only Scholars only students only talmudim disciples those who studied the truth they had access to the written record of God's word thus far but the Apostle Paul is saying you don't have to feel isolated or cut off from the word because even though you may not have access always to the written record of the word because of the birth the new birth because Christ has come the word in flesh we all have access to the word whether in printed form or living form and we don't have to go to the synagogue to find the word we don't have to go to the temple to find the word the word is it is even in our mouth it is even in our heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead and take the right hand of fellowship at the local church or be baptized frontward backward once twice or Thrice it didn't say anything like that it didn't say recognize every messenger of all the seven Church ages it said if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shall shalt be saved brother that's the best news that we could possibly hear it is our confession it is what we accept it is what we believe and it is what we confess that makes us save anybody with me for with the heart not the blood pump the inner seed of the emotions for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation well I can just hear brother man I'm preaching the ABCs can't you accept believe confess accept believe confess except believe confess for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him oh man shall not be ashamed we're not talking about closet believers we're not talking about hidden believers we're talking about those who are not ashamed to accept it to believe it and to confess it can we say Amen father we ask you today to come to us now we need you Lord we are about to approach the most important part of our time together here and that is the breaking down of your word the declaring of your absolute truth so that we might be able to receive it with faith and watch it produce the results it is not a written Testament only but it is a living reality so we come to you right now asking you to help us we are mortal beings our minds Wonder we are in 2022 and our phones and technology has wired us for ADHD we rebuke that spirit we take authority over any deficit in our attention span and we ask that a heart of faith will reach forward and embrace this word so that it might be able to accomplish something in our heart we ask these things in the name of our Messiah Yeshua in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated you again you think I could try yeah turn it down some things you should already know are you laughing at me the truth is everybody here can hear me amen but maybe not in in uh in the world wide web I I'm going to tell you some things today that you already know and and I don't want you to sit back like an expert and and you'll say well I already know that and and don't chew it I want you to chew it anyway just because we know something had knowledge or even know something by heart Revelation doesn't mean we never need to revisit that thought to that point again I'm a person who believes that repetition is a very important part of of being able to recall repetition helps us to to mix our faith with it and accept it so that it brings to us the rec the results that we are looking for and that is that it might give us life and that it might change us and so uh maybe this has not been put together in this order for you before and uh but I did bring some of these particular quotations in the year of 2018. how many of you are not here in the year 2018. all right and many of you streaming well some of you may have been going here but may not have been here that week or the week after or the week after or the week after who knows and so I don't think this will be a problem for you but the Lord took me here this week several days he took me here and he began to deal with my heart about what's coming uh to us in the new season and we're not a people who necessarily believe I'll probably just keep this mic I'll I'll probably just keep this one we're not a people who necessarily believe that everything changes December the 31st of any Gregorian year we don't even believe that it automatically changes because the Hebrew year has changed because anyone who studies the calendar knows that through the years even the Hebrew calendar has been a bit corrupted as we know it it's a lunar calendar yes but it has been a bit corrupted Through The Years they've had to add months and they have leap what we would call like a leap year and so we we we don't really know for sure that that December 31st is the last day of anything except we have to start writing a new year on our checkbook does anybody need me to explain to you what a checkbook is and that was my only struggle every year was remembering not to write down the previous year when I wrote my checks well I don't write too many checks I do some for the church but I don't write too many checks and and that's one thing we have to remember but spiritually it is not that everything changes a season changes for us as the clock strikes the Midnight Hour or as the last grain of sand Runs Out Of The Hourglass but what we do know is because of the Ebbs and flows of the spirit there are those seasonal shifts and changes that we have been talking about some have even taken the time and I'm not maybe been able to answer all the questions I've been getting but some have been asking recently what what does it look like what are we expecting in the new season well we are expecting a anointed installment of God's word to our hearts that will transform us from who we are to who he has created us to be we are not looking for a new truth but we're looking to discover what the spirit is underlining what the Holy Ghost is highlighting for such a time as this we're not looking for a new message we're not trying to elect a new messenger but what we do understand in God you know I was thinking this morning that brother Branham did a wonderful job in leaving something for the bride he not only stored up truth that transforms us spiritual food in due season but he was not a man who put everything on himself and left nothing for anyone else there are many around this message who have placed everything behind them they've put everything in the past and they have placed everything in who brother Branham was but I want you to know brother Branham didn't do that he did not do it as God's mouthpiece he didn't do that he in fact kept pointing us to Christ and he left so much meat on the bones for the bride to gnaw off you know some people like to call it reading between the lines I'm a little concerned about that approach because this is not open for private interpretation but what I believe brother Branham did was he pointed to a generation after his he kept saying when when that in that hour at that time come on after a while some Glorious Day meaning that when he would leave the scene God wouldn't stop God's economy didn't stop the truth didn't stop it just kept marching on and on and on he kept pointing us to something even greater and I don't I don't feel any trepidation at all to say that he pointed us to something greater for what you have seen in one man you will then see Hallelujah in a bridal company [Music] we're not looking for for a for a worldwide Ministry like brother Branham had what we're looking for is to is to personify that word and to manifest that Christ that he introduced us to that's the Mandate and the commission brother Branham didn't give us any indication in his Earthly Ministry that the adoption of sons had been completed nor did he give us any indication that The Headstone had already struck the pyramid in his Earthly Ministry neither did he give us any indication that we should know already every mystery you've got to look at the simple punctuation of the scripture to be able to understand that there were things that went by the prophet and there were things that went through the prophet that he did not bring to the people now how in the world can we continue on he said that bride is going to have thus saith the Lord and if she doesn't have the saith the Lord she's going to do what she's going to keep still now there are many who would point us backward and say he was referring to his own message thus saith the Lord and she will have that and she will cling to that we must we must cling to that we must hold that but I am not one who believes that's what he was referring to I believe he was referring to a day when that headstone comes down totally completely to cap this little bride into the stature of a perfect man when we fully see that Revival that was promised to us in the third seal he said it would take the revelation of those seven unknown Thunders and even though the church age book may tell you that that was part of brother branham's commission and mandate he did not preach that in the message that is somebody's interpretation of what the ministry of brother Branham was to come to do and has that ever created confusion in this earth because there are many camps today and this is not of interest to some of you but it has to be said it has to be said anyway there are many camps that have been created around different folks's ideas and interpretations and Revelations remember they took that film to brother Brant to brother Greene believing that a supernatural sign had been manifested on that film that was taken of one particular brother preaching a particular Revelation or understanding of the Thunders they took that to brother Greene and they hoped that he would see that film and he would then say that was God's amen on that Revelation and that he would then carry that to the far reaches of the world where he had contacts but when he saw it he perceived that it was an anomaly that it was a flash of light we're not talking about anything to do with the ministry of brother Branham now we're talking about another one of those little branches that formed after his death where people were trying to hang everything in the past not believing that there was anything that had not yet been written watch that now brother green said I I would like to I'd like to get excited about it but he even had it examined and there was no doubt that it was a reflection of some light on an old uh whatever 18 millimeter what eight million what do they have 16 millimeter film what did they have back then it was a a poor quality and It produced a light moving around in certain fashion that caused a whole movement thousands of people embrace it around the world and they hang it on little simple things some of which may not even be signs and wonders so we must not hang our faith on things that we don't fully understand but this one thing I know it's not all over folks if you want to quote me go ahead it's not all over folks God didn't finish moving with his bride her Ministry is not over yet it hasn't even fallen into full swing but it will and it'll fall with such rapid succession [Music] and we will wonder how we ever grew weary in waiting on it to be we will repent before God of Our Hope deferred and we will move as quickly as the lamb moves and as slowly as the lamb moves and we'll say what the lamb says and do what the lamb does and there will be a harvest there will be a harvest of souls outside the message Circle and it will come just like what we read whosoever shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved you do not determine your election by what you believe what you believe is determined by your election you can't change your Doctrine and change your position if you should have in your hand anybody with me if you should have in your hand a a handful of coins does anybody know what change is don't you just love to see these little yuppies at the at the drive-through and they don't know how to make change they know how to swipe come on they don't know how to make change they don't hardly know what change is brother random talks about change you can have a handful you can have a half a dollar anybody ever seen a half a dollar anybody ever seen a dollar coin my my we've had silver dollars and we've had Susan B Anthony Dollars where are they they're hardly even circulating anymore and we've had 50 cent pieces half a dollars and we had quarters and we had dimes and we had nickels and we have pennies and we know exactly how much each of those are worth and I want you to know God has that he has some vessels of silver and some vessels of gold he has perhaps some brass vessels and I want you to know the silver vessel can't look at the Gold vessel and say oh I wish I was gold and become gold the silver vessel can't say I'll go to church where you go to church and see if it'll make me gold that's not the way it works the Apostle said there are some vessels unto honor and some vessels unto dishonor there are some who carry the seed of God and there are those who carry other seeds anybody with me I chose all 12 of you but one of you is a devil but let me tell you what brother random said about that devil he said he cast out devils he healed the sick but here's what he couldn't do he couldn't tarry and receive the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost he may have had a feeling he may have had a sensation he may have had a goosebump he may have had a loud mouth he might have had a jump or a jerk or a shark he might have had a shoe or a hoe or a whoa but he could not receive the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost because a half dollar can't make himself a dollar and a dime can't make himself a quarter and a nickel can't make himself a dime and a penny can't make himself a nickel now you know that will really bust some some new age philosophy because the world today says you can be anything you want to be wrong anybody willing to agree with something as rough as old school is that wrong within your capacity within God's program and plan for you you can be all that you desire to be but everybody's not going to be the president and why you'd want to be beats me everybody's not going to be the CEO of a big company somebody said you can if you want to be not according to the word you have every day of your life recorded in the book of God before you're ever born the Bible said every one of your days are written in his book and if God wrote you in as a CEO of a big Corporation that's exactly what you can be if God wrote you in as a senator for the state of Alabama that's exactly what you can be if he wrote you in as a pastor that's exactly what you can be an evangelist that's exactly what you can be with me we don't make ourselves anything we yield to God now if that if you think that means we ought to be lazy if you think that means we shouldn't try to raise the bar no we should also remember that if we always do what we've always done we'll always be what we've always been somebody ought to help me preach [Music] some of us are living in the environment that we created and we are reaping seed that we have sown and if we don't like the Harvest we ought to change our seed we should speak a higher speak walk a higher walk that doesn't mean we shouldn't grow it doesn't mean that we shouldn't submit to the contractions of Zion and be birthed from virtue to Virtue we must grow we must not sit where we are and say this is what God Made Me because we don't see the whole book we hardly see today's page some of you hardly know what you'll be doing this afternoon at five o'clock some I've talked to are convinced that it won't be raining have you ever tried to tell volleyball addicts the weather report no sorry it won't be raining that's not gonna rain come on you don't know what God's book says I don't even know not about five o'clock couldn't tell you all I know is what the weatherman said we know he don't always tell the truth he says that by 4 P.M 90 chance of rain in Smith Station Alabama and by 5 PM 100 Chance by 6 p.m 100 Chance by 780 by 860 by 9 45. but you don't know I don't know how many of you lived in Alabama long enough to know we can Reign on one side of the road and not rain on your side of the road sun shining over there and it raining over here come on how many of you know there can be as much as a 10 degree not five degree a 10 degree difference between the northern part of Auburn and where we live we've watched it there could be a 30 degree difference between here in Atlanta when the weather is really shifting around when a cold front's moving down you don't know and I don't know all I want to know is what God wants to reveal to me and all I need to know is where I am right now I want to say that again what I really need to know is what I am right now and where I'm walking right now and what God would have me to be right now some of you hadn't gotten over the holiday you need to get over the holiday and get back to where we are right now and next Saturday I'll show you right in the message why brother Branham said we cling to those things he said there's something wrong in her heart I'm just telling you what he said and if I was anywhere else they'd say just say what he said come on so I want you to understand I say this a lot but I want to make sure you know where this comes from in the message which happens to be the first message that I ever heard of brother Branham the spoken word is the Original Seed March the 18th of 1962 paragraph 119 brother Branham tells us what his mission is what his commission is why he's here he said my mission that I believe that God has called me for I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do see and tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is what is to forerun the coming word he didn't say the word that now is or what I preached last night he seemed to believe that there was an installment of the word that was to come and I happen to know there is somebody said how could you say such a thing as that because I wasn't alive in 1962 [Music] and if anything is a part of this word I am so there was a word that was not yet on the scene in 1962. and brother Benham said my mission is to forerun the coming word see and watch what he says the coming word which is Christ Christ where where in the manger on the cross as a crucifix in a tomb in Jerusalem no a Christ now living in his bride body [Music] the bride coming of Christ the denominations will never see the broad coming of Christ they're not looking for it they don't even take time to differentiate between the comings they read in King James version coming and they don't even sometimes stop to see which coming he's talking about is this the physical Earthly coming or is this the coming of the word because he talked about a parasia they like to call it perusia he talked about a parasia coming and it was a word coming in spirit form why because he would live in another body not the body of the Lord Jesus not just in the body of William Branham but in a body of believers surrendered surrendered so what if we have to come in here and clear I feel a few people women it blesses my blesser so what if we have to come in here and clear the atmosphere sometime we're not like Native Americans and we don't burn sage and we don't go through here trying to clear the atmosphere with sage we don't try to put on the oils and see if we can clear the atmosphere with our oils I put on a bunch before I come out here none of them were to clear the atmosphere someone was to help me because I needed some support we don't hang crystals in here because we want to see if we can change the vibrational reading or the vibe or correct someone's aura no that's not how we get rid of Spooks and haints what we do is we say hey somebody brought something in here that they should have left at the door I don't point my fingers at anybody and what I was feeling couldn't have been one person only what I was feeling had to be several people there was no arguments in my car coming over here today before I left my house there weren't any arguments or ill words spoken that I know of once I left I couldn't tell you what happened but when I got up here on this platform I could feel the swirl coming and I could see that that some were already distracted and here in body but hadn't showed up here in spirit yet I want to tell you something we're not denominational people we can't sit through a three or four hour service in body only and let our spirit linger somewhere else we've got to pull our spirit into here because it's not our fleshly body that needs to be fed or stimulated it's the inner being the word doesn't come to make you feel good the word comes to transform us [Music] not from the outside in but from the inside out how many of you believe the word is becoming flesh again in the body of the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody said I can't say that because I've had a week from hell no you didn't you had a week out of his book free that's it you had a week out of his book it might not have been pleasant but it didn't come to bless you it come to prepare you because there is a people that are being prepared as forerunners for the final manifestation of Christ in the Earth the bride's Revival is the last the last one there will be no other after that brother Branham said we're yes will the bride will have a Ministry she's having that now so from from the 60s all the way to now there has been measures deposits places where Revival stirred and the Word was Vindicated and God met needs we have had many I tell you I I feel like I may fly any minute here I feel something I know it's not my feeling it is not by feeling but I feel something swirling around me I may just fulfill one of those dreams anybody dream of just lifting off the ground I I may just fly around in here after a while I feel something stirring around me and I don't want to miss it we don't use sage and we don't use music and we don't use anything else what I mean by that is playing some kind of musical recording hoping that it will you know make the atmosphere better no no no we use we use uh the weapon that has been given to us we use our praise we don't just bask in Praise we wore in Praise we realize that when we offer God an exuberant praise let the let the let the high let the high praises of God let the high praises of God be in their mouth and what read the rest and a two-edged sword in their hands your sword is the word the word is part of your weapon the name is part of your weapon the blood life is part of your weapon but praise and worship is also part of your weapon so we didn't burn sage and we didn't try to uh you know rebuke this or that or whatever is uh except led by the spirit we didn't have some program look it up in some encyclopedia how to clear the atmosphere we just started doing what we were created to do took a little reminder we just needed a little reminder and once we got a reminder we took off oh yes the prey shifted the sincerity of the heart shifted because as soon as the distraction is removed the sincerity of the heart always shifts as soon as we place our attention back on what matters the most and let me say this to you that's not building a great service what matters the most is Jesus be glorified Jesus be manifested and Jesus come and be Jesus not only to us but in US that's why we're here and so he goes on this bride's Revival let me just let me just see close that thought out this bride's Revival it's not like any other Revival it's another denominational Revival it's not to produce a few more Church age heroes in fact it's to deliver the bride from any residue of the church ages because we are still wearing some of the residue of the church ages and we are still wearing some of the residue of our denominational background for instance you shift a little different in here and somebody will say well we never did it that way in our church [Music] folks it happens that way every church is Sovereign no church is the same but if you're referring to a denominational church I want to take a moment say thanks be to God because he didn't call this to us as a church he didn't reveal this to us as a church it's more than a church foreign it's the holy spirit that has kept us out of the social justice movement [Music] that's what kept us out of that we we all love the sanctity of life but we don't let that be our our driving force we may do a little something I I give money to the Lee County Food Bank on a regular basis but I can't feed the whole County but I can do what I can but I don't make that the driving force of this church because he didn't say I want a church here on these uh Acres of ground to function just like every other Church except they believe a little different he said I'm looking for something entirely different and that's what the bride church is supposed to be around the world and yet we start looking like denominational churches more and more and more and more as the years go by we adopt programs the very thing brother Branham preached about and yet so many churches around this message are guilty of trying to draw people in and keep them in by keeping their hands busy I want you to understand that busy hands is not enough if your heart is not postured in love for the bridegroom staying busy is not enough if you don't know him as your lover staying busy is not enough if you don't lay your head on his chest and hear what causes his heart to beat is intimacy it's time in the tent it's time in the tent there's no room in the tent for the friend of the bridegroom there's no room in the tent for the maid of honor there's no room in the tent for the seven Church age Messengers there's no room in the tent for your pastor or your apostle or even your prophet there's only room in that tent of fellowship and intimacy for you and the bridegroom and if you're not cultivating that turn off the television if you're not cultivating that turn off the computer if you're not cultivating that put your phone down because there will be no Revival no True full force Revival in the bride until we love him more than we love ourselves until we love the word more than we love this world but it's coming my mission that I believe I'm on page one my mission that I believe that God has called me for I have to say some personal things he said because that's what I told you I do my mission I believe to the Earth is to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the millennium and has everything right there because he is the word you want to know where the Millennium is in Christ the anointed one that's where the Millennium is it's in him you want to know where the Sabbath is [Music] it's in him you want to know where Tabernacles are in him pass over in him come on you and we're worship true worship takes place in him do you know where the coming of the Lord is in him what we find out is that we have sometimes raised up walls of foundational Faith walls of Doctrine and we would rather cling to our understanding rather than see discover find out what is the root of it all the root of it all is Christ if you can't find Christ on every page of the written word you haven't known him the way you desire and need to know him he's there come on if you can't find Christ in every chapter of the book you're missing something because he's there this is the written record [Music] of a portion of who he is I've heard preachers hold up the Bible and say this is the fullness of Christ it is not [Music] it's about to get tight in here I'm hurrying this is hurry you know me it's going to rain tonight anyway I've heard people hold up the Bible and say this is the totality of Christ it is not [Music] somebody said I'm gonna need a scripture glad you ask the Apostle said the world could not hold the volume the world couldn't hold the books if everything he did was written in the book so I'm telling you there's a whole lot of what God did even in his Earthly Ministry through Jesus our Messiah that's not in this word and that is why it is not enough for you to memorize if we should we must we must hide it in our heart that we would not sin against God but it is not enough to memorize like I said last Sunday it is not how much of the word of God you go through it's how much of God's word goes through you we need a holy digestion to take place when we hear this written word and read this written word and study this written word we need the reality and the Living Word to come Among Us invite him into your bedroom when you sit down to read the written word invite the Living Word to come John 1 didn't say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word became printed form he didn't say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word became a magnetic tape he said in the beginning what's the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh flesh somebody say flesh what is that it's a body the word is not looking for a page the word is looking for a body what house will you build me one of the last messages he preached what house will you build me that's where it is and that's what you and I hate that's what you and I have been hand-picked for come on and should some of us go by the way of the Grave our children have been picked for it and if our children should pass our grandchildren have been picked for it because we are living in the foretold generation it doesn't take a real scholar to determine that we're living in the end of the end we're living in the last days but everything you see that has yet to take place could take place in Rapid secession and happen so quickly that you wouldn't hardly know what had gone around on around you except that you're caught up in the middle of it by the spirit that's how close we are to the coming of the Lord and what coming are you talking about I'm talking about the bride coming he cannot pick up that body until he has picked up a body come on and this is the body not this building not this group of people only but it's those who are hungry I guarantee you they're not arguing over clear fingernail polish I guarantee you that word bride she's not worrying about whether she can wear this or wear that or do this or do that or not that word bride is not worried about the a little extra effort it takes to pin up those splits she's gonna do it she's going to take that extra time because when she leaves her house to go out into the workforce and when she leaves her house to go out to church or to go out into the world she is reminded that she is the Earthly representation of Jesus Christ not a pope not a pope but a people a Zion people a people who will be the word that was to come come on the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the Millennium and has everything right here because he is the word all right there he was now who are you you're the word born bride you're not born of uh of like he used to say Charles and Ella Branham you were born of something higher than Charles and ellebranum you were born of something higher than Ralph and Jane Shelley you were born higher you just name your parents name you were born of something higher than that that is how your Earthly body was expressed that body is not who you are who you are didn't come from Mama and Daddy it didn't come from pedigrees who you are came from God Almighty the Creator the one who breathed breath into the nostrils of men the one who breathed and they received the Holy Ghost the one who knew it all before all ever began to unfold in the one who created everything we know from that which was nothing he didn't gather some some uh you know raw materials together and make the Earth he stepped out on nothing and spoke and everything that was formed was formed how many of you are glad to serve a God Like That a few more minutes spoken word is the Original Seed same message now paragraph 148 he begins to tell us who we are all of God's Sons must be the same can you follow that must be the same they're not all going to be fat they're not all going to be skinny they're not all going to be sway back they're not all going to have the same earlobes aren't you glad because some people's got ugly earlobes they're not all going to have the same my poor old mama she prayed so hard that I wouldn't have my granddaddy Shelly's earlobes I didn't get them but I don't know if the ones I got was any better but they were more like her so she was pleased it's not about that we're not all gonna particularly like same thing some people like animals more than others some people like color coordinating more than others Lord when our children were little we just wanted them all to smile we didn't have time to worry about whether they all matched come on we just want them to smile just so small we're paying money to have your picture made just smile some people care more about this and more about the other did you know there are some people who don't like grits if you can call them people and then there are those who ruin them with sugar just don't eat them just eat cream of wheat don't ruin our grits would you just leave them alone of course I learned in Puerto Rico that rice with sugar is good I I I'd not been I mean I'd had rice pudding but I didn't know you could just sprinkle a little sugar on on rice and make breakfast but boy you can make a pretty good breakfast like that we don't all like the same thing we don't all look the same way we don't all live in the same kind of house some people want to open concept some people like a little more confinement some people want to paint all the wood if God would have wanted all trees to be white he'd have painted them white everybody wants a farmhouse these days anybody with me never worked a day on a farm most people that won't farm houses now never pick to pee never stoop down I'm going to tell you something anybody can pick peas you barely have to bow but if you're a if you're a real farmer you've had to pick butter beans how many of you know they don't grow off the top on Long stalks you just about have to get down to where they are to get to them that's a real farmer but everybody's got what they like if I ever get a chance to watch a house show on uh on an app or something I like to watch the ones where they strip all the paint off take everything back to how it looked in the natural but if my wife was going to look at one which I don't think she gets to very often but if she did get to she'd want to look at one where you paint all the wood we don't want nobody to know it's a tree but this word said all of God's Sons must be the same and I promise you it's not all the same personality yes sir to be this is what makes us the same this is where we've got to find our common ground oh yes to be born of the word and and to be born of the word and spirit now look at what he said brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 see to be born of the water and the spirit that does what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should have been at the beginning that's the reason of Christ's death it wasn't so that someone could pray the sinner's prayer the reason Christ died was to bring us right back again to where read it again declare it one time sons of God that's that's who we are that's who we are that's why we're the same we will never live peacefully peaceably or peacefully with one another as long as we try to make everybody the same as us some people are never going to like collards some people are never going to get along with people like other people do they're not always going to relate to others the same the reason why we can't see God moving is because we're looking for God to do that that's not the biggest thing that God's got to do in US make us get along better with each other all those things become the fruit of what the word is doing on the inside you let the character of Christ be formed in you and you will see people Benjamin stand up just a minute get your phone go to Facebook and read the quote we were this quote came out of a discussion that we were having around I start to see around the table but we'd already left come here we'd already left the table on Friday but the whole family was there and we were having a discussion about different things various things and I read this quote and I didn't just read the small portion that Benjamin posted I read the whole a couple of paragraphs of it it's such a powerful thing and then we discuss what it means to love somebody and then we started talking about what that really means you know the Bible said Greater Love it's not always my responsibility to make you feel loved [Music] it's not always your responsibility to make me feel loved but greater love hath no man than this the real question is not whether you like someone no it's not you'd like to make it that but the real question is whether or not you're willing to lay down your life for that person die in their place I mentioned a young lady and her boyfriend who who got out they saw someone run over on the road and they got out to try to keep this person from being hit again and and could not get in time until someone else hit that person I want to tell you something a stranger but something in the heart of people that says I will risk my life you don't even have time to process that you because you so you can't produce that you can't manufacture that it has to be an overflow of who you are so you jump out in the middle of traffic and you're willing to try to prevent somebody else I want to tell you something that's love to me that's love if a man really hates you really hate you and he's proved he hates you and still in your heart you love him you're getting put pretty close to the kingdom that's right read it again without my Interruption if a man really hates you and he's proved he hates you and still in your heart you love him you're getting pretty close to the kingdom that's right all we can say is oh me we we can't really boldly say Amen even though we know it's a truth so we say so be it amen it's a truth but we can't all say Amen as though we produce that kind of character in the Earth you know he hates you he's proven that he hates you and you can love him anyway brother Graham said you're getting pretty close to the kingdom you know what that means you're getting pretty close to transformation that means you're getting pretty close to the stature of the perfect man who is the Lord Jesus Christ I hear people preach the message like brother Branham was the perfect man the perfect man that he was preaching about is the Lord Jesus Christ he said I am not a perfect man I make mistakes don't you take my word for it didn't he say it I make thousands of mistakes every day which by the way was a mistake nobody makes thousands of mistakes every day and certainly not brother Branham but he certainly made the point didn't he all of God's Sons must be the same to be the word word born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again I'm watching for the quote like in John 3 see to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again into the place of where you should have been in the beginning see that's the reason of Christ's death brings us right back again to where sons of God say message paragraph 181 give me the rest of my time if you will Hallelujah can you see the word takes flash there it is I want you to understand there it is the word takes flesh the word becomes flesh the word produces itself in a body of Flesh this is not a condescension it was the first time it was God coming down to be flesh this is not a condescension this is an Ascension when the word becomes flesh this time there will be an ascended people on the Earth not a condescended people you understand God Almighty had to come down to be in a fleshly body you've got to come up to be the word made flesh oh hear it [Applause] what's going to call you higher third seal can you see the word takes flesh there you are God is going to have a church it's going to be born of the word of God because it is the Living Word of God not the printed word not the magnetically recorded or captured word but that church is going to be the Living Word of God walking around in a body of Flesh [Music] anybody with me same message paragraph 277 we're hurrying we'll never finish this message I'm on page two I thought here I thought I'd come and get all 12 Pages done this morning and then and I didn't I should have known better now his body is will you so much time on collards oh come on sometimes your mind gets so wondered if I don't say something like that and bring you back now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body this is paragraph 277 spoken word now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that right he's asking a question and I'd like I want you to see it if we can wait just a moment because it's one of those uh quotations where it's a little you know head and body and the same and body and head and and I'd like for you to see it I believe it's so much more effective so we'll just wait just a moment and uh and look at it three three paragraphs and I don't want you I want you to really see it in in print now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together that right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was you said that right my body oh excuse me a church of the word a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word that means all the denominational stuff even Church age stuff because each Church age picked up some fanaticism not the message not the message to the church age but every Church age picked up some fanaticism even laodicea even those around the message of brother Branham picked up some fanaticism [Music] and that bride who will be the manifested word of God she must stand wordbride only she cannot meet the Mandate of the hour with Shelley Doctrine it's only by the word that she'll be able to be what God has called her to be not denominational a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is how by the head he told us who the head is it's the word [Music] that right now he said my body can't move until my head tells it to move oh my oh my oh my think about this a little bit think about this in the order of the home think about how much more successful a home life can be if the recognized head of the home is the one who directs the movement you don't have to take a deep breath you don't have to sigh you don't have to panic I'm not about to beat the wives down I'm not about to beat the women down if there's one thing I despise around this truth is how women have been treated around this truth they are not senseless they are not empty heads they're valuable if you don't believe that my brother then you better ask Moses if his wife saved his life or not God's Mighty Prophet chosen for his hour Moses if it hadn't been for a for a pagan woman [Music] zephara a pagan woman said you've been a bloody husband to me [Music] his life was spared she said didn't you tell me there was a covenant didn't you tell me the foreskin of the male had to be taken off as a sign of a covenant with God then what are we doing with the generation of Hebrews with the with the foreskin still on that's why they're suffering in that moment it was vital for her not to be empty-handed but to DARE speak up you'll never have that problem as long as the head of the house stays under his head but if he gets distracted from following his head then a sister a wife may have to speak up and say hey it's also my job to protect the children and the family and so I'm going to stand up here the best way I know how honor you the best way I know how but tell you that something doesn't feel right about where we are right now something is a little bit out let's pray together and a man who resents it when it's done in the right Spirit has got a big problem yes Moses even Moses had to Humble himself but a home will flow much more fluid it will be a more successful and more peaceful when a man stays in subjection to his head and the wife also is in subjection to her head and a family of children subjected to their head God has an order well what if my head is flesh and my body is concrete huh can't move head can say move move move move move move but there's nothing to send a message to the body concrete is that right and congregation says amen he said well if my head is Christ you ought to hear this and my body is a denomination well we didn't do it that way in the Assembly of God we didn't do it that way in the Church of God we didn't do it that way in the Baptist we didn't do it that way in the in the manual holiness we didn't do it that way in the Presbyterian you you better get a body change because you'll not be able to submit and subject yourself to Christ as your head if you're going to continue to try to be a denominational body how is it going to work how can Purity oh how can Purity and a work together brother random tell us how you really felt about denominations why would he say such a thing because the Bible did where did they get that the Bible where did he get that description the Bible what book particularly The Book of Revelation the Bible calls the Catholic church that her daughters are harlots her daughters are denominationals who have taken upon themselves Blasphemous names in other words they call themselves The Church of God the Assembly of God the Church of Jesus Christ the the holy church of so and so they've taken on these names but their names are blasphemy because they are not married to the Head somebody said who is uh qualified to say such a thing this book is a road map and there's a whole lot of things going on that you can't trace to the word then the body has become concrete it's become and you can't lead a body even with a pure head there's got to be a transformation we are word born body we are word born bride anybody here he said I love it Brethren I'll tell you I like to preach on some of this a while the the way the body operates is by the head and the head is the word that right the head is the word so we are the word born body of Jesus Christ so that you will think not think so that you will not think that I am uh you know all against the church age book I am not I am only concerned about the places where there are things found in the church age book that cannot be found anywhere else in the message and my opinion is there were too many human hands on the book to call it exclusively brother branham's that's just my opinion he said in the church age book pergamian this is an important word but I have grounded this already in the spoken word is the Original Seed that's the reason I read those quotes he said but this Prophet will come and as the Forerunner to the first coming cried Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God coming in glory he will do this for even as John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is now you know that's very interesting because John was not one of the church age Messengers but John had a message that forerun the church ages because it foreign the first coming of Jesus Christ he preached Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world if you get a chance to see the first two episodes of season three of The Chosen you will you'll see John the Baptist again he's there again he's in prison no jealousy no resentment of what's going on he's thrilled he's thrilled yes maybe perhaps he believes he's going to be sprung but the truth is he's willing to fulfill his role whatever it is he rejoices to hear that the ministry of Jesus is successful he fulfilled his Commission he could not have been cut short from the earth had he not finished everything that God sent him to do remember that he did exactly what God sent him to do after his wilderness education he delivered one powerful sermon Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world brother Bram said even that messenger of Truth to the elect like John he will come and listen to what he said he would say even so will he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God coming in glory Second Coming he will do this for even as John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is the one so is this one the last Messenger to the elect and there she is word born bride stay with me just a moment in the seven Church ages I want to do two or three more quotations here in close we're not nearly where we want to be but we're moving in that direction in paragraph 211 of the seven Church ages he said watch it's the church speaking to him now Waters Revelation 17 15 said Waters means thickness and multitudes of peoples or people now his voice or this being that was standing there looking like this Christ in his church you want to read that next phrase anybody here you want to read that next phrase as bride and Christ being one like husband and wife is one the church and Christ being molded together with one person the same Holy Spirit somebody said why are you telling us this because this is who you are well I'm so defeated this is who you are defeat is not who you are a failure is not who you are all right Lord of Mercy I like to said something I don't think I've ever said in the pulpit I'm going to get as low as I can to say it this came to me and I'm going to say it a screw-up is not who you are the enemy has told somebody that you are not that and you may realize that today but Don't You Dare Forget it tomorrow Christ is his church as bride and Christ being one like husband and wife is one the church in Christ being molded together with one person the same Holy Spirit let's go on and the things that Christ did the church does also do you see it that beautiful Church there in holiness folks Holiness is still right a differentiation between male and female is still right if the Pentecostal Church hadn't quit preaching against women dressing like men if they would have made a greater stand for the truth knowing this is their truth this is their truth I was raised Assembly of God this was their truth my grandmother saved 1950. in the Assembly of God and they preached the riches off of her but the church started adapting was that funny with the time molding itself just like the world they said later years later they didn't know the word then but years later they said we want to be relevant no you want to fill up the building you want to fill up the offering plate why I have in my files I've told you this I have in my files uh bylaws that came from Headquarters Springfield Missouri where mixed bathing was sin says right there in the bylaws in the in the membership packet they also said that you couldn't be a mason or in a labor union they also said we don't go to movies or bowling alleys so they had all kinds of standards but they just get weaker and weaker I want to tell you something Holiness is still right and if you call what I preach legalism you are sadly mistaken and I'll tell you why if you don't make a stand somewhere [Music] now look at gender confusion I've told you before we cried out against Grace Jones wasn't that her name years ago the first black woman who dressed like a man who cut her hair like a man a pop star of her day and she called herself some kind of name I don't know what it was but she called herself some kind of name presenting herself as both male and female way back and now look what we've got today Kirk Cameron wrote a book about overcoming hardship with faith they called libraries from Northern California all the way across to to uh New Hampshire and ask would they be willing to host him at his expense to come into the library and read the book to whoever showed up and everyone not one not one of the libraries would let him come at his own expense and read his own book which he said is not overtly religious it only mentions faith and Faith helping you get through hard times not one of those public libraries you say well they've got to stay out of that kind of stuff the very same libraries have either already hosted or were scheduled had already scheduled hosting drag queens men dress like women reading books about tolerance and and pronouns gender pronoun neutrality come on the answer that some of the libraries wrote back said uh we are a force to to be more accepting of all cultures except Christian faith something's very very very very sadly wrong in our nation and I don't always blame the church for things but I want to tell you something the church has had a major part and not saying anything about women dressing like men and men dressing like women come on and now look at the mess we've got in Holiness and separation is Right modesty is right the Holy Ghost is not living in vulgarity he's living in purity come on and there should be no argument there should be absolutely no reason to even discuss the matter nobody should have to come and tell you to wear your skirt longer then shorter nobody should have to come and tell you those kinds of things about dropping necklines but we do have to because if we don't the world and the Fashion World and Hollywood and mail order catalog and JCPenney will teach women how to dress if the church doesn't preach if the if the messenger doesn't pray if the if the pastor doesn't tell it like it is then we're going to be following JCPenney we're going to be following Ralph Lauren we're going to be following Glory of Vanderbilt we see what she produced somebody has to make a stand so that beautiful Church there in holiness in power in Majesty with seeing visions someone said I would stream but but I can't stand it brother shell he's always promoting his visions folks looks if I ever stand there and read from the vision book the visions that I've experienced over the last 10 years you'll say you'll say he's a man of many visions but I have kept them and held them many of them most of them from my own church because I don't want to promote anything by my vision but I can at times not mention come on I can't mention that in I mean I cannot mention that in the night last night I was walking through 2032. I can't not mention that I said what year is this on Earth I've just come from there I I I I shocked myself out of it when the answer said it's 20 32. now all I can say I won't make any other I won't even tell the detail won't tell any more all else but I can say that for this little church you can you can now know that I I've not seen anything on Earth's time uh scale past 2032. don't you leave here and say some crazy thing I didn't say the Lord was coming in 2032. I didn't say anything like that I've seen many things in eternity yet to come but I know exactly what time it was on Earth and Earth was was still clunking along that beautiful Church there in Holiness and Power in Majesty was seeing Vision signs and wonders is that the rest of that one everything just like he did here it is on Earth giving all praise to God saying I can do not listen we need those things we need to serve a God who still talks who still shows his children something amen I I want to say to to so many out there why don't you see a vision why don't you dream a dream the Bible said in the last days all men will dream dreams young men will see Vision we don't base our faith on a dream or a vision but if the spirit of God is moving and you feel like we've already met the climax of the move of God then there ought to still be visions and dreams among the people and if you do if you do have them why would you shove them under a bushel why wouldn't you speak about them from time to time I can do nothing except the father shows me but he showed me and here it is and we come see these things go to taking place now Christ molded into one and the voice of many Waters many people I read all that just to get to this verse we are a word born bride and many Waters sounding with one United voice did you know the prophet said that the voice of the Resurrection will be in the bride which helps us to understand from the word that the bride will call for the resurrection of the Dead how will she do that because she'll have thus say the Lord and as you don't have the say the Lord she'll keep still how will she know when because she'll be following the lamb now Christ molded into one in the voice of many Waters musicians are beginning to come many people not just the one it was the whole church the seven churches molded together in one great ransomed body of the Lord anybody hear what we're saying this morning this morning and the last one for this morning this afternoon but we don't say this afternoon this afternoon but we do say this morning 152 same voice I want to remind you of the order of his coming now it's the first thing is the sounding the first thing and and he misspeaks he corrects it so I'm going to just skip that part he said the first thing a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the Resurrection and what does he say about the voice of the Resurrection he says the same voice not one not one person he said just a moment ago it's many Waters but the same voice one with the bridegroom that's how the bride can speak and it be thus saith the Lord that's how the bride can move and it be thus saith the Lord that's how the bride can create by the spoken word of her mouth because it's not her voice it's his voice he said this uh shout a messenger getting people ready the second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice that a loud voice same voice in Saint John 11 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave that same voice one of these days is going to speak out of the bride of Christ and the dead in Christ are going to rise up somebody said I thought that was Gabriel blowing his trumpet yeah that's what the denominations think that didn't want the word said getting the bride together what is that getting the bride together go with it goes it follows right after the same voice like calling Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead see to be caught up with it now watch the three things takes place the next is what was a trumpet a voice and then he goes back he's going to get it right now a shout a voice a trumpet this would be a perfect opportunity for me to tell you that there are times that brother Branham is trying to go back and pick up where he was and this is a perfect example of a Body Soul spirit Body Spirit Soul situation now surely you don't think that the order is changed from the Bible surely you don't think the order has changed from the Bible here either a shout a voice and a trumpet if you happen to be listening and he says a Trumpeter shout of voice you understand he just misspoke he didn't change his Doctrine and how do we know which is right he told us I'll go to the word so if you want to know the order of Body Spirit and so you go to the word Body Spirit soul Body Soul Spirit see how easy it is to do it now watch the three things take place the next is what of a shout a voice a trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that will be the bride's supper the Lamb's supper with the bride in the sky what if I told you according to that word what if I told you the shout has gone out if you ever hear somebody say the or hear me say the Rapture is in progress that's what I mean the shout's already gone out we're living in the day now of the voice of the archangel that's where we are right now we're in the days of the same voice and one of these days there's going to be a final trumpet the last Trump the one that causes the bride to leave here with the bride that has been resurrected from the dead caught up together to meet the Lord in the air and we go right up to the bride supper how many of you are looking for the bride supper let's stand together I used all my time and and some more but I'm doing this to show you that brother Branham saw his mission as for running the coming word and to tell you that you are a part of the coming word that brother Branham was for running you are a part of the coming word you are a part of that which he was for running somebody said well I don't feel like that and I don't always manifest that and I just always I get it we're fighting what kind of battle if you follow the word order you'll know where the battle is it's in the soul your spirit has been regenerated by the spirit of Jesus Christ your spirit is secure you are Spirit of his spirit Same Spirit same Holy Spirit your old Spirit has been Rewritten regenerated and a new spirit now lives within you the spirit of Jesus Christ no struggle in your spirit the struggle is in the personality which we sometimes refer to as a spirit and I think sometimes people around the message make that same mistake they'll say my he has an awful Spirit no he may very well have the spirit of Christ you're calling a spirit a personality and your human spirit is not your personality your personality flows out of your soul life not your spirit life your soul life is mine will and emotions that's where you get the most trouble anybody ought to know that it's in the mind it's in your will your stubbornness my stubbornness it's in the emotions we spend a lot of our life reacting how emotionally not intelligently and not spiritually if we if we manifest it according to the body we'd use our intellect if we manifested according to the spirit we'd let the Holy Spirit teach us how but rather we often respond anybody guilty we often respond out of our emotions which causes us to condemn ourselves which causes us to disqualify ourselves which causes us to come to church on a Sunday morning and bring all our stuff with us but you just let a little word come a little reminder come and watch those people you're amazing your people are amazing you don't always respond that quickly but this morning you resp this morning you responded quickly quickly quickly and you began to do if you did it for your pastor thank you so much but you won't always do it for me regardless of why you started you started doing what you were created to do some pounded a little bit they felt a little called out and picked on but the truth is I didn't know who you were sometimes it's better just to leave people thinking you know even if you don't know all I knew was there's no way we could go forward in a service with all that swirl I knew that Benjamin would feel defeated and the musicians would feel defeated and I'd get up here to preach and go home feeling defeated there was enough of a swirl around us but look what you did you got out of your condemnation you pulled yourself out of your distraction and you began to be that word that was spoken that you would be you begin to be that you begin to come before the Lord worshiping his name and who'd have ever thought that an old hymn would bring us into the crescendo How Great Thou Art and here we are feeling like a bunch of little peons just tiny tiny little specks and all of a sudden we start beholding the goodness and greatness of our God and he peoples us right up and we start seeing ourselves as his whoa I'm his hey don't mess with me I'll call Papa are you careful how you treat me I'll go tell Daddy on you come on and when you do that you start seeing that the enemy is not your brother the enemy is not your sister [Music] the enemy is that voice in your head because we often become the weapon that is formed against ourselves may God give us Grace and Deliver Us from that it's a very exciting time most of the time we can't get up above our circumstances to find out just how exciting it is but God bless every one of you here today who got up above who who soared above and I pray that you've had a feast because of it and if you have it was him it was him it's all him it's all him you ready it's all him we need not think I I remember the years that I would meet Benjamin after a service defeated just couldn't get them but the truth is it wasn't everybody it was the influence of a handful it was the influence of a role that affected and shifted the identity of a whole body of people but you take it so personal he did just like I do you take it so personal and then we discovered many times we discovered that we shouldn't let a minority create the atmosphere and we press through anyway and that's what we have to do even even like times like today oh is there anything in here to worry over uh brother Auburn you sisters Theresa got anything to worry about anybody else got anything to be concerned about let me see hand Michael oh Michael's toting my load and yours too but he didn't stop him he left a wife at home all woozy koozy came on over here and got right up front he didn't wait on you come right on up front to do what he was created to do I'm not trying to pick on anybody or call anybody out or single anybody out I'm just telling you we take a lot of this for granted you don't get the text you don't get the calls you don't have the conversation sometimes that I have in a week and so you may not really know the load that somebody on the other end of your Pew is going through It Ain't Easy for them either but we cannot let that clip our wings we were created to soar above it all one of the things the spirit of God was rebuking this morning in that time was fear driving fear out of this place there's no room
