[41:34] to the hospital rushed to the hospital
[41:36] to get there because sister Sharon's
[41:38] mother wanted us to come and pray for
[41:40] her before surgery and and by the time
[41:43] we got there the the looked like the
[41:45] anesthesiologist and a whole crew of
[41:47] people were waiting in the hall and they
[41:49] just parted to let us go through and
[41:50] pray and and I appreciated that because
[41:53] you don't want to hold up the hospital
[41:55] but brother Ron Spencer I told you last
[41:58] week uh Pastors in Virginia and uh he

[45:48] word you've always done everything you
[45:51] said you were going to do Lord and we

[45:55] just bless us but but that you want to
[45:56] abundantly bless us and Lord that you're
[45:59] ready to do more than we could ask or
[46:01] even think so this morning we bring our
[46:05] offering of Praise which has brought us
[46:07] into this place of worship

[46:26] this morning will you do Miracles oh God
[46:29] once again for you haven't changed and
[46:31] that price you paid meditating on your
[46:34] word this week and remembering that as
[46:37] you hung there on that cross you said it
[46:39] was finished finished and we believe
[46:42] that this morning Lord we believe you
[46:45] don't ever have to die again that once
[46:48] was enough Lord you don't ever have to
[46:50] take Stripes again for our healing but
[46:52] that was enough Lord you fulfilled the
[46:55] prophecy of the word word of God and it
[46:56] is finished this morning and we lay hold
[46:59] of the word of God and we say that's
[47:01] mine it's mine this morning I take hold
[47:04] of the word of God and I say thank you
[47:06] Lord for what you've done for me thank
[47:08] you for what you did for me it's mine

[47:13] this morning for our family that's
[47:15] unable to be here with their family we
[47:17] bless them in the name of Jesus Christ
[47:20] we ask that the angels that surround us
[47:22] Lord may you send Heavenly hosts to them
[47:24] may they feel the presence of that
[47:27] Supernatural host around them Lord God
[47:30] may they be comforted and encouraged and
[47:33] as we turn our hearts towards the word
[47:35] of God today Lord there's nothing that's
[47:37] going to transform us greater than a
[47:39] revelation of your word so we desire
[47:41] Lord that the work that you started by
[47:44] the spoken word may it be finished in us
[47:47] may it be finished in us today Lord that
[47:49] you can say it's done make us what you
[47:51] want us to be we give ourselves fully
[47:54] and completely to you for your glory and
[47:55] honor so we pray in the precious name of
[47:57] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank
[48:01] you Lord thank you Lord thank you
[48:05] Lord oh we give you praise Lord for

[48:33] amen we want to welcome Warren and
[48:36] Phyllis Perry we're glad that they have
[48:38] come to be in the service with us
[48:41] today brother Ellas was in their home
[48:44] this week I believe and invited them and
[48:46] so we're so glad that you came the Lord
[48:48] bless you may he speak to you while
[48:50] you're here and minister to your needs
[48:52] we're glad to have brother Cade again
[48:55] with us from North Carolina I think
[48:58] that's where he I guess that's where
[49:02] you we're glad that he's here and he's
[49:04] going to he's going to uh continue to
[49:07] worship with us and we invite him I
[49:11] think he's going to the piano we'll
[49:12] invite him and while he's getting ready
[49:14] we want to just receive the tithe and
[49:16] the offering we want to give as giving
[49:18] unto the Lord the Lord is merciful and
[49:22] faithful to us and he is just blessed us
[49:27] when he gave us
[49:28] salvation that's a blessing that is
[49:31] above every other blessing that he would
[49:34] uh give us of his salvation that we did
[49:37] not have to be lost but he didn't leave
[49:39] us in that place he Sanctified us and
[49:42] then he gave us the baptism of the Holy
[49:44] Ghost and and he didn't stop there but
[49:47] he gives us refilling after refilling
[49:50] after refilling because he wants us to
[49:52] keep pressing on because there's so much
[49:55] of him that we don't yet know and he
[49:57] continues to unfold himself I'm thankful
[50:01] for that what does that have to do with
[50:04] with tithe and offering it's part of the
[50:07] Covenant he said he would pour us out a
[50:09] blessing if we would keep Covenant he
[50:11] would pour out a blessing that there
[50:13] wouldn't be room enough to receive and
[50:15] so we honor that Covenant by the giving
[50:18] of our tithe and offering we bless you
[50:22] as the people of God you that are here
[50:24] you that are out over the stream that
[50:26] continue to give so that the message of
[50:30] the Lord Jesus Christ can continue to go
[50:33] to the world that he has given us a
[50:36] Pulpit to we're thankful for that and as
[50:39] you continue to give the work of the
[50:42] Lord continues to go on here on the
[50:44] campground and we are seeing the vision
[50:47] unfold here on this ground that the Lord
[50:50] has given to us that we now own the bank
[50:53] does not own it we own it and we give
[50:56] the Lord praise for
[51:02] that with that being said to you
[51:05] brothers that are here we are not sure
[51:07] in our fellowship meeting next weekend
[51:10] we're not sure who all is coming it
[51:12] appears that our uh our delegation from

[51:18] normally is but I would like to invite
[51:21] the brothers that are willing and not
[51:23] afraid of heights to to help us on

[51:43] don't want you up there because we don't
[51:46] need any accidents we want to pray the
[51:49] angels of the Lord around us that that

[1:06:32] you I know there are a few visitors here
[1:06:35] we're so glad that you're here very very
[1:06:37] happy that you're here we don't have a
[1:06:39] Sunday night service so I preach Sunday
[1:06:42] morning sermon and Sunday night sermon
[1:06:44] all at one time so if you have to slip
[1:06:46] out any of you for some reason we're not
[1:06:49] going to talk about you when you go
[1:06:51] we're going to understand that the
[1:06:52] service has run long what I'm not going
[1:06:54] to do is cut it short I'm going to obey
[1:06:57] the Lord that's why we're here and uh
[1:07:00] let's see what God has for us in verse
[1:07:03] 12 2 Chronicles CH 5 also the Levites
[1:07:08] which were the singers all of them of
[1:07:11] Asaf of himon of yuun with their sons
[1:07:16] and their Brethren being arrayed in
[1:07:20] white linen having symbols and salry and
[1:07:24] harps stood at the East End Of The Altar
[1:07:28] and with them an
[1:07:31] 120 priests sounding with trumpets I
[1:07:35] don't know if you can hear the noise I
[1:07:38] can almost hear the noise people say
[1:07:41] sometime I I'd come more often to your
[1:07:43] church but it's just too loud well I
[1:07:46] want you to know it's never as loud as
[1:07:48] 120 trumpets at one
[1:07:51] time the God is Not
[1:07:54] nervous come on there was a lot of noise
[1:07:57] going on here sues were being played
[1:08:00] symbols were being played Harps were
[1:08:03] being played and 120 priests sounding
[1:08:06] trumpets all at the same time that
[1:08:09] sounds like church to me I like it let's
[1:08:12] go on it came even to pass as the
[1:08:16] trumpeters and singers let's not forget
[1:08:18] the voices were as one to make one sound
[1:08:22] to be heard in praising and thanking the
[1:08:26] lord and when they lifted up their voice
[1:08:29] with the trumpets and symbols and
[1:08:32] instruments of music and praise the Lord
[1:08:36] saying for he is good for his mercy
[1:08:40] endureth forever that then the house
[1:08:43] come on the house was filled with a
[1:08:47] cloud even the house of the Lord father
[1:08:51] thank you for your word it is both an
[1:08:55] example and instruction to us in this
[1:08:59] hour Lord let us digest today let your
[1:09:03] word settle down into the inner recesses
[1:09:06] of the Inner Man may we be transformed
[1:09:10] from the inside out oh God teach us the
[1:09:13] ways of praise the ways of worship and
[1:09:17] how to stand in the glory of the Lord
[1:09:21] beholding your power your attribute your
[1:09:24] character and being changed by what we
[1:09:27] behold father your word is already
[1:09:30] anointed but today we ask you to anoint
[1:09:33] the hearer and to anoint the one that
[1:09:35] would be here to deliver and we'll give
[1:09:37] you praise honor and Glory it's in the
[1:09:40] lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:43] Yeshua our Messiah that we pray and the
[1:09:46] Saints said you may be seated on
[1:09:50] December the 22nd of last year I had an
[1:09:54] experience with the Lord in the night
[1:09:57] and in that experience I was told that
[1:10:00] this was a year 2024 on the Gregorian
[1:10:04] calendar a year for mountain climbing
[1:10:08] well I like that it's not always
[1:10:11] positive what we hear sometimes it's a
[1:10:13] little bit you know brace yourself but
[1:10:16] but I think mountain climbing sounds
[1:10:18] good are you with me and then the voice
[1:10:20] spoke and said be very sure
[1:10:24] footed you got to know where you're
[1:10:26] standing somebody help me you've got to
[1:10:29] know what you're standing on ever now
[1:10:32] and again you better check the
[1:10:33] foundation make sure you're still
[1:10:35] standing on the word it's not OP pinion
[1:10:38] that we're going to stand on in this
[1:10:40] hour come on it's not the doctrines of
[1:10:42] men but we're going to stand on the
[1:10:45] whole revelation of Jesus Christ did you
[1:10:48] know that Genesis to Revelation is the
[1:10:50] revelation of Jesus Christ he's revealed
[1:10:53] in in Genesis just like he is in the
[1:10:55] book of the Revelation he is there and
[1:10:58] he's not just a historical god of the
[1:11:00] book but he's a living reality in the
[1:11:03] heart of the believer in this hour I ask
[1:11:06] a question in this experience how will
[1:11:09] we remain
[1:11:11] surefooted I need some help how do we do
[1:11:15] that and I heard five statements being
[1:11:18] made and in those statements I heard
[1:11:20] them in the voice of the person who had
[1:11:24] spoke these things into my life the
[1:11:27] first voice I heard was a mentor of mine
[1:11:30] a man that I respected very much who has
[1:11:33] gone to be with the Lord so many years
[1:11:35] ago now and he was speaking back
[1:11:39] something that had been poured into his
[1:11:41] life and the phrase was whatever you do
[1:11:45] keep your balance in the scriptures I
[1:11:48] don't know any better advice than that
[1:11:51] we can't get off on some tangent
[1:11:53] somewhere we've got to bring the balance
[1:11:56] amen and and if it's in the book it's
[1:11:58] true are you with me if it's in the
[1:12:01] Bible is true but you don't want to
[1:12:03] build a big Doctrine on an isolated few
[1:12:06] words you want to run it through the
[1:12:09] continuity of the Bible come on now you
[1:12:12] want to run it all the way through as
[1:12:14] the old preacher said from kiver to
[1:12:16] kiver that's from cover to cover and
[1:12:19] when you do that you've got a Doctrine
[1:12:21] to stand on Amen
[1:12:24] and and sometimes we make too many
[1:12:26] assumptions by what we read you don't
[1:12:28] have to make any assumptions from
[1:12:30] scripture when he the spirit has come he
[1:12:34] will lead you and guide you when the
[1:12:37] spirit of Truth has showed up in your
[1:12:40] life he will help you to make your way
[1:12:43] through traditions on he'll help you to
[1:12:47] wage your way through what granny
[1:12:49] thought and find your balance in the
[1:12:52] scripture
[1:12:54] my precious granny I tell you I love her
[1:12:56] and I love the stand that she made on
[1:12:58] the word but I want you to know there
[1:13:01] were things that were emphasized in that
[1:13:04] hour that I can't run through the
[1:13:06] continuity of the scripture so I don't
[1:13:08] spend my time criticizing those who
[1:13:11] plowed the way but I have a mandate and
[1:13:16] you have a mandate in this hour keep
[1:13:18] your balance in the word in the
[1:13:21] scriptures then the second thing I heard
[1:13:24] was a from a great man of God who had
[1:13:26] one of the most impactful Ministries
[1:13:29] that this nation and around the world
[1:13:31] really has ever seen and that was a a
[1:13:33] healing evangelist I believe more than a
[1:13:36] healing evangelist but a prophet and uh
[1:13:39] his name was brother brandham and I
[1:13:41] heard the voice of brother brandham
[1:13:42] because his ministry has spoken to me so
[1:13:45] much through the years I heard his voice
[1:13:48] very clearly saying whatever you do stay
[1:13:52] in the mid middle of the of the
[1:13:55] road stay in the middle of the road
[1:13:59] that's the highest point if the road is
[1:14:02] made properly it's higher in the middle
[1:14:05] and it it it Slants slightly toward the
[1:14:08] edges so that all the debris Will Will
[1:14:11] just sort of come floating down when a
[1:14:13] good rain like we've had lately just
[1:14:16] washes not I tell you it'll wash a gully
[1:14:18] right down your driveway won't it the
[1:14:20] kind of rain that we've been having and
[1:14:23] then the third voice happened to be a
[1:14:25] woman that had some influence in my life
[1:14:27] and and as I've told you before God sent
[1:14:30] me many years ago and said I will give
[1:14:33] you a word for her and I will give her a
[1:14:36] word for you you do believe in Prophecy
[1:14:38] don't you we are still living in the New
[1:14:41] Testament right somebody said well that
[1:14:44] was all in the New Testament you know
[1:14:46] that was in the early church and I know
[1:14:49] that's kind of what the Church of Christ
[1:14:50] likes to emphasize that some of these
[1:14:52] things ceased with the apostles I'm
[1:14:55] having a hard time finding that in my
[1:14:57] Bible and I don't know who ever told you
[1:15:00] that the New Testament
[1:15:01] ended but mine didn't end I'm still
[1:15:05] living in Bible days come on now in fact
[1:15:09] that promise of the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:15:11] just for that generation it's for your
[1:15:13] children and your children's children
[1:15:16] come on and I'm some of them children's
[1:15:18] Children's children's Children's so
[1:15:21] there's no backing up and uh so her name
[1:15:24] was Ruth Hein some of you may have heard
[1:15:27] of sister Ruth I've quoted her many
[1:15:29] times and uh she she was a missionary
[1:15:33] and uh she did a tremendous work in the
[1:15:35] nations of the world and she was
[1:15:38] probably a prophetess in the sense that
[1:15:41] that God would speak to her and and he
[1:15:43] would not only speak on her end he would
[1:15:45] prepare the way on the other end and two
[1:15:48] times she flew into Ethiopia and was
[1:15:52] given an audience by the wonderful
[1:15:54] working of the Lord with h salasi the
[1:15:57] Emperor of Ethiopia the second time she
[1:16:00] was not
[1:16:02] expected and it would it took a miracle
[1:16:06] to put things together but God did it
[1:16:09] supernaturally and uh and because of
[1:16:12] that he was given proper warning and
[1:16:15] proper instruction for what was about to
[1:16:17] take place in the Revolt of Ethiopia if
[1:16:20] you know anything about the history
[1:16:22] sister Ruth was also in Jerusalem one
[1:16:25] day and God began to speak to her heart
[1:16:27] and told her that he was going to give
[1:16:28] her an audience in the Palace of
[1:16:31] catmandu in Nepal and God did exactly
[1:16:35] that she flew to catmandu not knowing
[1:16:38] anybody in Nepal she was told what hotel
[1:16:42] to check in she checked into a fancy
[1:16:45] hotel and uh and and begin to do a
[1:16:48] little research and and try to find out
[1:16:50] for sure who the who the Ministers of
[1:16:53] the government were and guess what God
[1:16:56] sent the brother-in-law of the of the
[1:16:58] emperor of the leader of Nepal sent the
[1:17:01] brother-in-law through the lobby you and
[1:17:05] I would maybe go the other way you know
[1:17:07] a little embarrassed but she didn't do
[1:17:09] it she walked right up to him stuck out
[1:17:11] her hand told her who she was and I'm
[1:17:14] here with the word of the Lord for the
[1:17:17] emperor come on now so you can say what
[1:17:20] you want to say it doesn't bother me I
[1:17:22] know how I know how we stand on the word
[1:17:25] and so forth and we don't have women
[1:17:27] pastors and I get all that but I can't
[1:17:30] help that God knows who to
[1:17:34] use I can't help that and all I know is
[1:17:37] god I didn't even know who she was but
[1:17:39] saw her face I've told you the story
[1:17:41] many times and God gave me a word for
[1:17:44] her and her a word for me she's gone
[1:17:46] she's in the presence of the Lord I have
[1:17:49] no doubt that I'm going to see her on
[1:17:50] the other side she was the third voice
[1:17:53] that I heard in this experience and if
[1:17:55] you've ever heard her voice you'll never
[1:17:57] forget it she had one of the most unique
[1:18:00] voices that I've ever heard in my life
[1:18:03] and uh she she spoke in this in this
[1:18:07] experience something that I had actually
[1:18:10] heard her say and had read in a book uh
[1:18:13] the first book I ever read that that she
[1:18:15] wrote and and it's part of how God is
[1:18:20] helping us to remain surefooted in this
[1:18:23] area praise and worship is a very
[1:18:26] important part of keeping our balance of
[1:18:29] staying in the middle of the road and of
[1:18:31] keeping the channel of Revelation open
[1:18:33] between Papa and our hearts do you
[1:18:36] understand uh so she simply said
[1:18:40] praise until the spirit of worship
[1:18:43] comes worship until the glory comes and
[1:18:48] then do what stand GL stand in the glory
[1:18:53] and so maybe next Sunday we'll get to
[1:18:55] the fourth thing that was spoken and
[1:18:57] eventually the fifth thing but I want to
[1:18:59] spend a little time on this in the
[1:19:02] scripture that we just read Heaven
[1:19:05] invaded the Earth and when I read 2
[1:19:08] Chronicles chapter 5 this account I can
[1:19:12] easily see the progression from praise
[1:19:16] to worship and from worship to the glory
[1:19:19] Cloud so I really believe that this is
[1:19:21] an example for for us when we come to
[1:19:24] the house of God when we choose to have
[1:19:27] time with him at home you don't have to
[1:19:29] wait until you come here to praise you
[1:19:32] don't have to wait till you come here to
[1:19:33] worship come on you can stand in the
[1:19:35] glory in your living room are you
[1:19:40] awake you can in fact you should in fact
[1:19:44] we need
[1:19:45] to come on so somebody wants to know
[1:19:48] what do you have to have the Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] to go in the Rapture I I don't
[1:19:52] understand why why you'd want to go to
[1:19:53] Walmart without the Holy Ghost so much
[1:19:56] less trying to make a Rapture you need
[1:19:59] everything that God has got for you and
[1:20:02] you need it
[1:20:03] yesterday come on so if you're here and
[1:20:06] you don't know whether or not you've
[1:20:08] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:10] chase it run after him it is not an
[1:20:15] it come on it's the spirit the eternal
[1:20:19] spirit of God and we need him in our Liv
[1:20:23] sister Ruth said as air is the
[1:20:26] atmosphere of the earth glory is the
[1:20:29] atmosphere of Heaven it lifts us up
[1:20:32] above the Earthly into the very presence
[1:20:37] of God we gave you the definition of
[1:20:40] Praise can you put that back up for us
[1:20:42] before we get to where we're starting
[1:20:44] today praise means to speak well of to
[1:20:48] compliment to commend to applaud to ex
[1:20:52] stole I I believe that this is a
[1:20:55] praising
[1:20:57] Church doesn't happen
[1:20:59] automatic we we have to push to get
[1:21:02] there we have to fight to get there
[1:21:05] sometime we have to push Darkness back
[1:21:07] before we can ever really move into
[1:21:09] those places of Praise but how many of
[1:21:11] you found out it's worth every effort
[1:21:13] that you put forward but praise is not
[1:21:16] worship it's a part of worship but there
[1:21:19] there are elements of worship that are
[1:21:21] different than the elements of Praise so
[1:21:24] when we look at the very meaning of the
[1:21:27] word worship we get a different
[1:21:30] definition Al together although very
[1:21:32] very similar will you put that up
[1:21:35] worship is to express reverence to have
[1:21:40] a sense of awe to Bow Low
[1:21:45] before really to humble yourself the
[1:21:48] Hebrew word speaks about bowing as a
[1:21:51] bull rush you are bowing down like a
[1:21:54] created being to esteem the worth of to
[1:21:59] give place to or yield so what we find
[1:22:03] is sometime praise can be rather noisy
[1:22:06] and praise can be a little bit of an
[1:22:09] extension of who you are come on you
[1:22:12] don't have to wait until you feel
[1:22:14] something to praise you just come with a
[1:22:17] sacrifice of praise you don't praise him
[1:22:19] because you feel like it you praise him
[1:22:21] because you know it's the right thing to
[1:22:23] do and what we find is when we praise
[1:22:26] him the anointing starts increasing the
[1:22:29] higher the praise goes the higher the
[1:22:31] anointing goes somebody help me and the
[1:22:34] higher we go in praise the easier it is
[1:22:38] to start making that transition to
[1:22:40] Worship in Praise we're thanking him for
[1:22:43] what he does we're seeking after and
[1:22:46] giving him thanks for what he
[1:22:48] accomplishes with his hand with the
[1:22:51] power of His might but in worship we
[1:22:54] start focusing not on what he can do but
[1:22:57] we focus on who he is let me tell you
[1:23:00] something if he never moved for me again
[1:23:03] he's still God oh yeah and he's still
[1:23:06] worthy of Praise if he never saved
[1:23:09] another Soul or healed another sick body
[1:23:11] he's still worthy of our praise and so
[1:23:15] we transition from focusing on what he
[1:23:19] can do what he does do what he has done
[1:23:23] and we start seeing him his character
[1:23:27] his
[1:23:28] attributes come on who he really is and
[1:23:33] when we begin to move into a focus
[1:23:36] change really you know I mean there are
[1:23:39] similarities in the sense that that
[1:23:41] sometimes you can still be very
[1:23:43] demonstrative in your worship I saw that
[1:23:46] today I saw us as we begin to transition
[1:23:50] into to way maker that's when I saw the
[1:23:53] transition and we start singing I
[1:23:56] worship I'm worshiping and yet we were
[1:23:59] still at a high place from praise and
[1:24:02] you would expect things to start getting
[1:24:04] more quiet and a little more reverent
[1:24:07] and a little more holy but instead the
[1:24:09] songwriter said way
[1:24:12] maker Lal
[1:24:15] worker so it doesn't change always the
[1:24:18] volume or the style it changes the focus
[1:24:22] I worship you you're the way maker now
[1:24:26] that focus is on him making a way but
[1:24:28] the emphasis is not on the way that's
[1:24:30] being made the emphasis on who's doing
[1:24:32] the way making who's doing the way
[1:24:35] making it's God Almighty and his worthy
[1:24:38] to be praised praise can sort of be
[1:24:41] worked up in the sense that you start
[1:24:43] climbing in Praise but worship is
[1:24:46] something you just can't duplicate on
[1:24:48] your own you can't work yourself up into
[1:24:51] a worship it's a transition that only
[1:24:54] God can help you with you see real
[1:24:56] worship Demands a real
[1:24:58] relationship I think I should say that
[1:25:01] again real worship let me say it louder
[1:25:04] for the
[1:25:05] sleepers real
[1:25:08] worship requires a real
[1:25:12] relationship you can go through the
[1:25:14] motions of Praise without connection but
[1:25:18] you can't really move into worship
[1:25:20] without being connected to the one that
[1:25:22] you're focusing on so worship is not
[1:25:25] always evident to The Observer you can't
[1:25:28] always tell when someone is moving into
[1:25:31] another place of worship but what we
[1:25:34] find is that worship is one of the mo
[1:25:37] most important things that we do in
[1:25:40] response to the goodness of God are you
[1:25:43] with me and we know that Satan has been
[1:25:46] against it from the from the
[1:25:49] fall his fall his ambition is We Know by
[1:25:54] the scripture that he was created to
[1:25:57] participate perhaps even like a praise
[1:25:59] and worship leader or or a band director
[1:26:02] or something in heaven we we don't
[1:26:05] understand the descriptions are that
[1:26:07] when he was created there were even
[1:26:09] tabrets and pipes somehow placed in his
[1:26:13] body I don't understand that but I don't
[1:26:16] have to understand that but it sounds as
[1:26:18] though as he moved before the throne
[1:26:23] that even his body even even his
[1:26:27] creation the image that God had given
[1:26:29] him was releasing a sound of praise and
[1:26:32] worship but it also brought him into
[1:26:36] Pride hello and pride brought him in
[1:26:40] ambition that said I'm going to sit
[1:26:42] above I'm going to put my throne above
[1:26:43] God's Throne I'm going to exalt myself
[1:26:47] I'm the beautiful one here come on and
[1:26:49] so you may not understand this but I'm
[1:26:51] telling you that people that are gifted
[1:26:53] in music and in leading of praise and
[1:26:56] worship have particular vulnerabilities
[1:26:59] that have to be covered in
[1:27:01] prayer the enemy is just as much after
[1:27:04] praise leaders and worship leaders and
[1:27:06] musicians as he is
[1:27:08] preachers you hear what I'm saying yes
[1:27:11] sir and and if you've been around as
[1:27:13] long as I have around Pentecost you know
[1:27:16] that there has been a a a a strange
[1:27:20] amount of perversion right I'm saying
[1:27:23] this
[1:27:23] delicately there's been this unusual
[1:27:26] amount of perversion that
[1:27:28] runs through talented men and women who
[1:27:32] lead and praise and worship and play
[1:27:34] music in the house of God I I got really
[1:27:37] quiet I think I'll take some water here
[1:27:39] you you don't need examples because
[1:27:41] they're even out there in the public
[1:27:43] church
[1:27:46] World rather than
[1:27:49] condemning we ought to cover
[1:27:53] I mean cover in prayer not sin we don't
[1:27:56] cover sin but cover in prayer those who
[1:28:00] place themselves in that position every
[1:28:03] time they come to lead
[1:28:06] us I mean the body at large the church
[1:28:08] at large so that the enemy is not able
[1:28:12] to pull them out of the reason of their
[1:28:15] creation the reason why they were born
[1:28:17] the reason why they were created and so
[1:28:20] Satan was banished and he was able to
[1:28:22] persuade a portion of the angels to come
[1:28:24] with him and we don't read anything
[1:28:27] about this kind of contention in Heaven
[1:28:30] until something had first been created
[1:28:32] to worship God you see there was a time
[1:28:35] there was nothing to worship him he was
[1:28:38] still the eternal spirit he was still
[1:28:41] ABA our father but there was nothing
[1:28:44] made to worship him but as soon as he
[1:28:46] began to make something create something
[1:28:49] to worship him it wasn't long but but
[1:28:52] contention began to rise in the
[1:28:54] heavenlies and pride be so no wonder the
[1:28:58] enemy hates real praise and real worship
[1:29:03] it reminds him of his
[1:29:05] defeat it reminds him he didn't reach
[1:29:08] his goal it reminds him he wasn't
[1:29:12] successful in building his throne above
[1:29:14] heaven it reminds him that just Fallen
[1:29:18] Humanity of Adam's Fallen race like you
[1:29:21] and I can actually stand where he used
[1:29:23] to stand when we enter into praise and
[1:29:26] genuine worship it is as though we have
[1:29:29] been transported amen Before the Throne
[1:29:33] of I am I tell you there are moments
[1:29:36] that you wonder and even can sometimes
[1:29:39] have a sensation of being pulled has
[1:29:42] anybody ever experienced that when you
[1:29:44] enter into praise and
[1:29:46] worship it's almost as though something
[1:29:48] that magnet that great magnet of
[1:29:50] Eternity it's is just pulling us upward
[1:29:53] hallelujah oh somebody said I don't
[1:29:55] believe in that I didn't ask anybody
[1:29:57] what you believed in you don't have to
[1:29:59] experience God like I experience him but
[1:30:02] I am not
[1:30:03] ashamed I am not ashamed to know I feel
[1:30:06] him I'm not going to base my faith on a
[1:30:09] feeling I'm not going to change my
[1:30:11] Doctrine for a feeling but I'm glad
[1:30:13] there's a God that you can feel I'm glad
[1:30:16] that you can experience the spirit of
[1:30:18] almighty God in a personal relationship
[1:30:21] and not just a corporate one are you
[1:30:23] with me John chap 4 let's go there I got
[1:30:26] to hurry John 4: 21 Jesus saith unto her
[1:30:31] woman believest me believe me the hour
[1:30:35] cometh when you shall neither in this
[1:30:37] mountain which was in Samaria nor yet at
[1:30:41] Jerusalem worship the father ye worship
[1:30:46] ye know not what we know what we worship
[1:30:50] for salvation is of the Jews but the
[1:30:54] hour cometh and now is when true
[1:30:59] worshippers shall worship the father
[1:31:02] would you finish that for me in spirit
[1:31:05] and trth in spirit and in
[1:31:08] truth so remember you got to have both
[1:31:12] sir for true worship to be present come
[1:31:15] on you can't believe anything you want
[1:31:17] to believe and enter into true worship
[1:31:20] it's got to stay in the word God it's
[1:31:22] got to stay in the absolute of the
[1:31:24] scripture are you with me I'm sorry to
[1:31:27] keep asking but I need to
[1:31:30] know there's coming a day Jesus said
[1:31:32] when true worshippers will worship the
[1:31:35] father in
[1:31:37] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:31:41] seeketh such to worship him I love this
[1:31:46] because it reminds me that God is Not
[1:31:49] Looking for
[1:31:50] worship God God is looking for
[1:31:54] worshippers he wants to have a
[1:31:56] relationship with you it's not just the
[1:31:58] fruit of your lips he's interested in
[1:32:00] it's the Bowing of your heart it it's
[1:32:03] the laying down of your
[1:32:05] self-will It's Your Surrender that he's
[1:32:08] after come on it's not just your
[1:32:11] sacrifice that he's looking for he's
[1:32:13] looking for your obedience isn't that
[1:32:15] what the Bible said a and so we can
[1:32:19] attend what is called a worship service
[1:32:21] Serv on Sunday we can participate in
[1:32:25] whatever kind of liturgy or order the
[1:32:28] church has adopted but that doesn't mean
[1:32:30] we've ever moved into worship we can
[1:32:33] have good singing and never really find
[1:32:35] the place of worship worship is the
[1:32:38] Bowing of the heart worship is the
[1:32:41] surrendering of the will it comes as an
[1:32:44] overflow of adoration and Thanksgiving
[1:32:47] to the god that we have come to know
[1:32:50] worship is a Time Of Love he pours out
[1:32:52] his love on us hallelujah and he gives
[1:32:56] us an
[1:32:58] opportunity this is The Wonder of
[1:33:00] Wonders he gives us an opportunity to
[1:33:03] pour out our love for
[1:33:05] him now that's what worship does praise
[1:33:08] celebrates what God has done worship
[1:33:12] reflects on who God is the waiting Bride
[1:33:16] of the song of songs does not say I love
[1:33:20] him because he has healed me because he
[1:33:24] has saved me because he delivered me
[1:33:27] because he set me free because he
[1:33:29] brought me a long way because he guides
[1:33:32] me and leads me every day but rather the
[1:33:34] bride says to the bridegroom you are my
[1:33:40] beloved you're my leaning
[1:33:43] post come on you're the one I'm holding
[1:33:46] on
[1:33:47] to you're my friend we read in the song
[1:33:50] of songs
[1:33:52] that the bride is looking for a friend
[1:33:56] let me remind you today there is a
[1:33:58] friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:34:00] brother if you were to interview people
[1:34:03] in this house and ask them do you have
[1:34:04] good friends do you have a real good
[1:34:07] friend that you can confide in and you
[1:34:10] can trust in and most people would tell
[1:34:12] us I could count them on my on my one
[1:34:15] hand and I want to tell you it may not
[1:34:17] feel like the same thing but if you've
[1:34:19] got Jesus I mean you've really got him
[1:34:22] and he's really got you you've got the
[1:34:24] best friend you could ever have you can
[1:34:27] tell him everything you want to tell him
[1:34:29] and it never changes his mind about
[1:34:33] you you can tell him how rotten you
[1:34:35] really are sometime he already knows you
[1:34:38] can tell him how vile your thoughts get
[1:34:40] sometime he already knows and instead of
[1:34:43] condemning you he brings a little
[1:34:46] conviction to your heart and then offers
[1:34:48] you hope to get out of that mess how
[1:34:50] many of you thank ful that instead of
[1:34:52] getting beat upside the head he offers
[1:34:54] you a way to get out of the problem he
[1:34:57] offers you a way to come higher the Lord
[1:34:59] wants us to know him so intimately that
[1:35:03] we can present him to others and can
[1:35:05] describe him not from someone else's
[1:35:08] experience with him but from our own
[1:35:11] personal
[1:35:12] experience from having seen him with our
[1:35:15] eyes of Faith from having heard his
[1:35:20] voice you believe you can hear God's
[1:35:22] voice not just through your preacher how
[1:35:25] many of you believe if the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:27] living inside of you you ought to be
[1:35:29] able to discern and hear the voice of
[1:35:30] God for your own life we must come to
[1:35:34] that place we must fall in love with him
[1:35:38] we find that the more we worship Him the
[1:35:42] more intimately we begin to know him if
[1:35:46] you really know the Lord there's no room
[1:35:48] in your life for indifference if you're
[1:35:50] still tained by indifference you're
[1:35:52] living too close to the world you need
[1:35:55] to draw up a little bit closer to him
[1:35:57] are you with me one of the first things
[1:36:00] we find uh concerning the difference
[1:36:03] between praise and worship is when I
[1:36:06] praise the Lord I will to praise but
[1:36:09] when I come into the house of the Lord I
[1:36:11] offer my lips and I will to praise but
[1:36:14] you do not will to worship you can't
[1:36:18] really worship until the spirit of
[1:36:20] worship the anointing for worship comes
[1:36:23] into the meeting and when it comes upon
[1:36:26] you then you begin to worship without
[1:36:28] anybody telling you to it just shifts
[1:36:31] your focus the ministry of Praise
[1:36:34] increases the anointing in the service
[1:36:37] it increases the anointing in the
[1:36:39] individual but the ministry of worship
[1:36:42] is what brings the glory praise brings
[1:36:45] the anointing to worship and and worship
[1:36:48] brings the anointing to glory in worship
[1:36:51] we're focusing on the person of God when
[1:36:54] we begin worshiping him sometimes even
[1:36:58] images will
[1:37:00] form in our Mind's Eye in the eye of our
[1:37:04] spirit in the eye of our heart am I am I
[1:37:07] bothering your theology you you you you
[1:37:11] may not be really seeing but uh in the
[1:37:14] natural but you're catching a glimpse in
[1:37:18] your spiritual vision has anybody ever
[1:37:20] had that
[1:37:22] I believe you probably have and and and
[1:37:24] sometimes you just sort of begin to see
[1:37:26] his feet you you you you you you you
[1:37:29] just can't you know all of a sudden look
[1:37:31] up and try to try to stare at his face
[1:37:33] you just feel feel pressed to get his
[1:37:36] low have you ever been in the presence
[1:37:38] of the Lord and felt like the floor
[1:37:41] wasn't low
[1:37:43] enough you weren't it wasn't shame you
[1:37:45] were feeling it was
[1:37:48] awe it was his awesomeness It Was
[1:37:52] reverential Fear it probably wasn't fear
[1:37:55] that he was going to crush you but it
[1:37:57] was fear uh a reverential fear an awe
[1:38:02] you had touched the awesomeness of God
[1:38:05] and when you touch the awesomeness of
[1:38:07] God it actually begins to a it begins to
[1:38:10] actuate change in your life and it
[1:38:13] introduces the glory realm to you do you
[1:38:15] believe there's a spirit realm a glory
[1:38:17] realm beyond what we are right now and
[1:38:20] where we are right now I believe it's
[1:38:22] more real than the one we're living in
[1:38:24] and the one we're walking in right now I
[1:38:26] really do in 1
[1:38:29] Chronicles chapter
[1:38:32] 28:2 the Bible said then David the king
[1:38:35] stood up upon his feet and said hear me
[1:38:39] my brethren and my people as for me I
[1:38:43] had in my heart to build a house of rest
[1:38:47] for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[1:38:50] and for the foot
[1:38:53] stol of our
[1:38:55] God maybe you've never heard the
[1:39:00] temple God's dwelling
[1:39:03] place we're not looking for a physical
[1:39:06] Temple we are the temple the New
[1:39:09] Testament says know ye not that your
[1:39:12] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost of
[1:39:15] the Holy Spirit you're the house that he
[1:39:17] desires to dwell in but but David
[1:39:20] desired to be build this house of Cedar
[1:39:23] unto the Lord God put it in his heart
[1:39:26] and he particularly calls it a house so
[1:39:29] that the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[1:39:32] has a place to rest but he specifically
[1:39:34] calls it the foot stol of our God so
[1:39:38] it's no wonder that we can get an image
[1:39:40] of his feet because when we begin to
[1:39:44] worship him our worship forms a foot
[1:39:48] stol this what David was praying I
[1:39:50] believe it
[1:39:51] it's as though the god of Eternity comes
[1:39:54] by and props his feet it's all
[1:39:57] right I may not like your
[1:40:00] feet you may not like my feet but I want
[1:40:04] you to know his feet are
[1:40:06] beautiful I don't mind him propping his
[1:40:09] feet on me if I could offer a worship
[1:40:12] that would be pleasing enough in his
[1:40:14] sight that he could come by this morning
[1:40:18] and say I'm going to make your worship
[1:40:20] my my foot stol because listen brother
[1:40:23] where his feet are he
[1:40:26] is so I want God to come down on our
[1:40:31] worship I want him to be brought real
[1:40:33] into the house when we worship the Lord
[1:40:37] in that moment I believe you can ask him
[1:40:39] anything that you have need of and he's
[1:40:42] ready to meet that need so praise and
[1:40:45] worship is not a chore it's preparing
[1:40:48] you it's preparing you for him to come
[1:40:50] in in and even place his feet up upon
[1:40:54] your worship he said and had made ready
[1:40:58] for the building and then in Psalm 1327
[1:41:01] here's another one he said we will go
[1:41:03] into his
[1:41:06] Tabernacles we
[1:41:08] will worship at his foot
[1:41:12] stol are you saying pastor that that
[1:41:16] every
[1:41:18] service should have both
[1:41:21] praise and worship that's exactly what
[1:41:25] I'm
[1:41:26] saying we should have some time to
[1:41:30] praise him for what he has done what he
[1:41:33] is doing what we know that he will do
[1:41:37] and we should also have some time to
[1:41:40] just say Lord just come and prop your
[1:41:42] feet up on
[1:41:44] me let me live as long as I can live
[1:41:48] right here in your presence until your
[1:41:51] glory I'm getting something now woo
[1:41:55] until your glory comes Sweeping in and
[1:41:59] changes
[1:42:04] me you see that's what's supposed to
[1:42:06] happen when we sit under the revealed
[1:42:09] word when the word is being revealed
[1:42:11] that's him sir that's him he is his word
[1:42:15] remember John said in the beginning was
[1:42:17] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:42:20] the word was God and then he goes on to
[1:42:22] say and the
[1:42:24] word became flesh so Jesus is the word
[1:42:28] and when that word begins to go forth
[1:42:31] It's drawing him into our house it's
[1:42:34] drawing him into our midst and in that
[1:42:37] presence we're changed in the glory I
[1:42:40] want to hear you say glory glory in the
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:44] glory in the glory which is the Manifest
[1:42:48] presence of God it's more than the
[1:42:51] atmosphere of Heaven it's the Manifest
[1:42:53] presence of almighty God come
[1:42:57] on come on no wonder it brings you to
[1:43:01] reverence are you telling me that you
[1:43:05] believe that God Almighty would send his
[1:43:08] presence into a little country church
[1:43:11] out here on leer Road 379 I do believe
[1:43:16] that and the reason why I believe that
[1:43:19] is because I'm here
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:26] because you're here come
[1:43:28] on he he comes because you're his house
[1:43:32] you brought him here he doesn't just
[1:43:35] live in this building when we're not
[1:43:37] here that's Old Testament in New
[1:43:40] Testament he lives in The
[1:43:42] Believer that's why we've got to be
[1:43:44] careful how we treat one
[1:43:46] another because more than just my
[1:43:49] personality lives in this house am
[1:43:51] almighty God by the power of the Holy
[1:43:54] Spirit has chosen to come to
[1:43:57] in remember in one place Jesus said I
[1:44:00] will I will pray the father and he will
[1:44:02] send you another comforter in another
[1:44:04] place he said I yes sir I will come to
[1:44:09] you because that's exactly what the Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost is the very same presence the very
[1:44:16] same deity the very same spirit of God
[1:44:19] that was bed in Jesus Christ it's what
[1:44:22] was poured out on the day of Pentecost
[1:44:25] and you've got to have it to complete
[1:44:27] the new birth yes sir we receive a
[1:44:30] portion of his Spirit when we repent of
[1:44:33] our sins but I don't want just a drop in
[1:44:35] the
[1:44:36] bucket I don't want just an Earnest I
[1:44:40] want as brother gley said today to be
[1:44:42] filled with the Holy Ghost and not only
[1:44:45] to be filled but to keep presenting
[1:44:47] myself under the spout for for another
[1:44:51] refilling and another refilling and
[1:44:54] another refilling fill us Lord come on
[1:44:57] slip your hand up with me fill
[1:45:00] us fill us with who you
[1:45:03] are fill us with who you are teach us
[1:45:07] how to praise until the spirit of
[1:45:09] worship comes and then
[1:45:12] worship until your glory fills the
[1:45:15] house I don't need to see a cloud but I
[1:45:18] don't mind to see a cloud
[1:45:23] when I was a
[1:45:25] boy in our little home church it was
[1:45:29] very common it was out on on uh I
[1:45:33] started to say Highway 10 that was the
[1:45:34] first church uh in down country La low
[1:45:41] Alabama what they used to call Hamilton
[1:45:43] Road is that what they call it now
[1:45:46] Highway
[1:45:48] 27 my granny you know I don't want to
[1:45:50] bore you with my
[1:45:53] stories my granny was at that time
[1:45:56] ordained in the Assemblies of God and
[1:45:59] she later came to understand that that
[1:46:02] it wasn't her place to Pastor a church
[1:46:03] but she pastored one for for many years
[1:46:07] no offense I'm just telling you her
[1:46:08] testimony and uh she believed that there
[1:46:12] should be a church in North
[1:46:13] Columbus and so she wanted to do it
[1:46:16] right she was ordained Assembly of God
[1:46:19] and she wanted to do it right she wanted
[1:46:22] to be obedient to the denomination that
[1:46:24] had been good to
[1:46:27] her she received the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:31] Ghost in
[1:46:32] 1950
[1:46:36] 4950 over in Columbus at
[1:46:39] Bellwood which is now Trinity Temple I
[1:46:43] think
[1:46:44] and she felt like God was calling her to
[1:46:47] North
[1:46:48] Columbus so she went to the board
[1:46:51] whom we all knew I knew later when I
[1:46:54] come along and she knew them well and if
[1:46:55] I called names some of you would know
[1:46:57] who they were good men good men but not
[1:47:02] perfect
[1:47:03] men because there are very few of those
[1:47:06] I'm preaching about one today right but
[1:47:09] uh no no sister we we we really
[1:47:13] appreciate the burden you've got and we
[1:47:15] know God deals with you and but we don't
[1:47:18] believe that there is a need for a of
[1:47:20] God Church in North
[1:47:24] Columbus and uh let let me give you a
[1:47:26] little insight North Columbus was not
[1:47:31] uh well a lot of it was owned by Mr
[1:47:35] Box and Mr Box is the one who owned
[1:47:38] boxwood and that was a a slum
[1:47:41] neighborhood so to speak and he owned
[1:47:44] the sold the land that Columbus Square
[1:47:45] Mall used to sit on which I think now is
[1:47:48] the public library Mogi County
[1:47:51] library and he owned so much land out in
[1:47:55] North Columbus and to be honest with you
[1:47:57] people were living in
[1:47:59] squalor really substandard housing very
[1:48:03] poor
[1:48:04] people uh very you know uneducated
[1:48:08] people living in North Columbus and my
[1:48:11] granny said I believe that's where God
[1:48:13] needs a
[1:48:15] church she said I believe God needs a
[1:48:17] church there and uh they said well now
[1:48:20] now we can't stop you from from building
[1:48:23] a church but you'll do it on your own
[1:48:25] and she said oh I get it excuse me
[1:48:28] Brothers you all thought I was coming
[1:48:30] here to ask for help she said I wasn't
[1:48:32] asking for your help I was just asking
[1:48:34] for your knot of approval she said
[1:48:37] because the Holy Ghost has already told
[1:48:38] me that there's to be a church in North
[1:48:41] Columbus and if the Holy Ghost said it
[1:48:43] he's the one that'll have to bring it to
[1:48:45] pass she said I just didn't want to be
[1:48:47] moving against my elders but she said no
[1:48:49] problem Brothers I'll let you know when
[1:48:51] it's done and you can come help me
[1:48:53] dedicate it well for years all she could
[1:48:56] find was an old I got picture in my
[1:49:00] office and and some of you saw it before
[1:49:02] it burned down an old former hunky Tonk
[1:49:06] called Mary's
[1:49:08] place if you ask some of the old-timers
[1:49:10] in Columbus and Phoenix city did you
[1:49:12] ever hear of Mary's place oh yes we
[1:49:16] heard of Mary's place all right it was a
[1:49:19] shotgun kind of kind of honky tonk and
[1:49:22] Mary I understand had a leg amputated
[1:49:25] and Mary I understand sat behind a
[1:49:28] little desk like a pull pit as you went
[1:49:30] in the door of her Honky Tonk with a
[1:49:32] shotgun propped up against the little
[1:49:35] thing and you paid a little cover charge
[1:49:37] to get in and if you got
[1:49:42] Rowdy she held up the
[1:49:47] shotgun I don't know she ever shot
[1:49:49] anybody body I never looked that up but
[1:49:52] I know she shot holes in the
[1:49:54] ceiling to let people know you're going
[1:49:56] to be when my granny found that building
[1:50:00] and reached out to Mr Box about renting
[1:50:03] that building he wanted to charge her an
[1:50:06] exorb amount of money and she said I'm
[1:50:09] sorry Mr Box we won't be able to do that
[1:50:12] she said I don't know if you've been in
[1:50:13] there lately but she said the windows
[1:50:15] are burst out of it and she said there's
[1:50:18] human blood on the floor and she said
[1:50:21] the the the the folks who's been living
[1:50:23] up in the woods there in the cabins have
[1:50:26] been using it for a
[1:50:27] bathroom and she said the whole back of
[1:50:30] the building is full of human waste and
[1:50:33] she said so there's no way in the world
[1:50:35] I'd be able to give you that kind of
[1:50:36] money to rent that that building he said
[1:50:38] oh Michelle I didn't know it had fallen
[1:50:40] into that kind of repair I'll half the
[1:50:43] price well even half the price was way
[1:50:45] more than it was worth but she had some
[1:50:48] praying people working with her
[1:50:50] and they went in and they replaced the
[1:50:52] windows and they scrubbed the blood off
[1:50:55] the floor and they patched the bullet
[1:50:57] holes and they shoveled the human
[1:51:00] waste into garbage cans and and hauled
[1:51:05] them off and what they couldn't haul off
[1:51:07] they buried in the
[1:51:08] dirt to open a little place on the side
[1:51:11] of the road where people could come and
[1:51:15] meet God and they had Church Saturday
[1:51:18] night Sunday morning and Tuesday night
[1:51:21] and I lived along I come along about the
[1:51:23] year the church was started about
[1:51:27] 1968 and so my my experience in that
[1:51:31] building was a little bit profound what
[1:51:33] I saw God do I've told you that the
[1:51:36] pillar of fire has shown up in that
[1:51:38] building to such a measure that every
[1:51:42] eye every person there was interviewed
[1:51:45] and questioned and not one person said I
[1:51:47] didn't see it but instead every
[1:51:49] everybody said I saw
[1:51:52] it I don't have to see a pillar of fire
[1:51:55] I don't have to see a cloud to know that
[1:51:58] the presence of God has come but it
[1:52:00] would be all right with
[1:52:04] me there's people in this room right now
[1:52:06] that have come in contact with the glory
[1:52:09] Cloud I grew up in that little church
[1:52:12] filled with the Holy Ghost there at the
[1:52:14] age of seven I've stood on what granny
[1:52:17] called the
[1:52:18] rostrom that's what we call a
[1:52:21] platform I stood on the rostrom and
[1:52:24] looked out across that you know it
[1:52:26] wasn't much slat fuse that pinched you
[1:52:29] every time you shifted you people would
[1:52:32] be in constant pain here as long as I
[1:52:34] preach you'd be hurting the whole
[1:52:36] service cuz anytime you moved you got
[1:52:38] pinched and when you heard people holler
[1:52:40] you didn't know if it was the spirit or
[1:52:42] the or the
[1:52:43] bench but I've stood on the rostom of
[1:52:46] that church and seen not only felt the
[1:52:49] presence of of God but seen that milky
[1:52:51] blue
[1:52:53] presence come on come into that house
[1:52:57] where the people's faces would blur
[1:52:59] because the cloud of God's glory had
[1:53:02] manifested itself in a physical visible
[1:53:07] way somebody said were there any fruit
[1:53:10] was there any fruit produced oh yes the
[1:53:13] got up and walked and the blind
[1:53:15] could see and the deaf were were hearing
[1:53:19] and the demon possessed were set
[1:53:22] free I told you about the sisters who
[1:53:25] would go into labor in a service and in
[1:53:28] those in in that period of time it was
[1:53:30] as though God created a time capsule
[1:53:34] around our little church because the
[1:53:36] things that we saw happening in the 70s
[1:53:40] were things that the Pentecostal Church
[1:53:42] hadn't seen since the
[1:53:44] 6s so somehow God created a little time
[1:53:48] capsule and sisters would go into labor
[1:53:51] they didn't call the
[1:53:53] ambulance they took them into the Sunday
[1:53:55] School
[1:53:58] room where they had their
[1:54:00] babies right I can't tell you the times
[1:54:04] that I've seen women hour later what the
[1:54:06] church do they kept on
[1:54:08] praising they were still
[1:54:12] shouting I was there when when daddies
[1:54:15] were dancing instead of taking care of
[1:54:18] Mama
[1:54:20] husbands dancing across the floor
[1:54:22] worshiping God while the baby was coming
[1:54:26] and more than once I saw mam walk out of
[1:54:29] the back room with a baby in their
[1:54:31] arms before we' ever got closed in the
[1:54:34] service and ready to go home that's the
[1:54:36] kind of move of God it was people didn't
[1:54:39] want to miss you didn't have to beg
[1:54:41] people to come to church and people from
[1:54:44] all the other Pentecostal churches
[1:54:45] couldn't come on Sunday but I want you
[1:54:47] to know they could come on Saturday
[1:54:49] night night and they could come on
[1:54:51] Tuesday night and I've told you before
[1:54:54] that there were many Saturday nights
[1:54:56] that we would be worshiping and praising
[1:54:58] God and we would hear the the brakes on
[1:55:02] an 18wheeler lock up on the road on
[1:55:05] Highway
[1:55:06] 27 we'd hear it come scrubbing in to the
[1:55:10] back lot which would have been behind
[1:55:12] the old building to the side in the
[1:55:14] behind the old building and here come a
[1:55:16] big old you know I don't mean that all
[1:55:18] truck drivers you know have big bellies
[1:55:21] but here'd come an here'd come a big
[1:55:23] bellied rough looking fellow in the
[1:55:27] door pale as a ghost look like he had
[1:55:31] seen a ghost run to the
[1:55:34] altar the Saints would get around him
[1:55:36] and pray until they prayed him through
[1:55:40] and he would get up and say can I say
[1:55:42] something they weren't afraid of
[1:55:44] somebody saying something then they said
[1:55:45] go ahead brother he said I want you to
[1:55:48] know that I had no intention of stopping
[1:55:51] in here I may lose my job because I did
[1:55:54] but he said I looked as I come down
[1:55:56] Highway 27 tonight I saw Great Big Balls
[1:56:00] of Fire about that big around rolling up
[1:56:03] and down the
[1:56:05] highway and God got a hold of my heart
[1:56:08] and I knew that I had to surrender my
[1:56:10] life to him come on can I tell you one
[1:56:13] more I've told you many times yes sir uh
[1:56:17] some of you may know Glen Ray I don't
[1:56:19] know
[1:56:20] uh I think he and his wife Margaret may
[1:56:21] have a church or something in Phoenix
[1:56:23] City sometimes I hear people talking
[1:56:25] like maybe they have a church somewhere
[1:56:27] Glenn Ray was my grandmother's nephew he
[1:56:30] was raised sort of in a Baptist way
[1:56:32] nothing wrong with that but he didn't
[1:56:34] know what to think about all these signs
[1:56:35] and wonders and Supernatural experiences
[1:56:38] you know he thought it had to just you
[1:56:40] know Holy Rollers were looked down
[1:56:44] on and so he wasn't sure he come one
[1:56:47] night and we had a pretty ordinary
[1:56:48] service I mean it was good by today's
[1:56:51] standards it was really good but but it
[1:56:54] wasn't you know profound and we're
[1:56:56] leaving I'm standing on the concrete
[1:56:59] steps with my grandmother's Gibson
[1:57:02] guitar case in my hand and Glenn Ray
[1:57:06] says to my grandmother Aunt Mildred he
[1:57:09] said I just don't believe in them
[1:57:10] foreign
[1:57:13] lights she said you don't Glen Ray just
[1:57:17] like that he said no ma'am
[1:57:19] he said I I just don't believe in I just
[1:57:22] don't believe God has to to do things
[1:57:24] like that anymore so she said if
[1:57:28] somebody were to tell you they'd seen
[1:57:29] one you wouldn't know whether to believe
[1:57:30] or not no no I'm I don't I I I I don't
[1:57:34] believe I just can't hardly believe that
[1:57:36] that's God I heard her look back she
[1:57:39] cocked her head like that she said you
[1:57:40] don't believe in the foreign lights
[1:57:42] that's what people called them I'm sorry
[1:57:45] it was a pillar of fire but we didn't
[1:57:46] know what to call it they might have
[1:57:49] called it you UFOs in some places I
[1:57:50] don't know you you say you don't believe
[1:57:53] in the forign Lots again R said no I
[1:57:54] don't believe and she just looked at me
[1:57:56] and kind of noded her head and
[1:57:59] winked and about that time I heard a
[1:58:01] noise
[1:58:07] building nobody told us to look but
[1:58:09] everybody
[1:58:11] just and coming down the middle of
[1:58:14] Highway 27 was not one but
[1:58:17] three big Balls of Fire R floating down
[1:58:23] the highway and as they got
[1:58:28] close Glenn Ray sat right
[1:58:32] down he didn't help himself down he went
[1:58:35] right down on his tailbone sitting on
[1:58:38] those steps and drops of perspiration
[1:58:41] had broke out on his
[1:58:45] forehead my granny looked at me and
[1:58:48] laughed
[1:58:52] she stepped on down the step where Glen
[1:58:54] Ray was sitting and she said Glen
[1:58:58] Ray do you believe in them
[1:59:03] now you know that silly almost to us but
[1:59:07] it's how God was manifesting himself in
[1:59:11] that is he not the same
[1:59:13] God I don't need a fire to believe I
[1:59:17] don't need to see a cloud to believe but
[1:59:19] I want the glory to
[1:59:23] come I want our doubt to be pushed
[1:59:27] aside I want our lives to be transformed
[1:59:31] from glory to glory from what we are now
[1:59:35] to what he wants us to be and if God
[1:59:38] wants you to see I believe Chad was in
[1:59:40] the service I don't know how many others
[1:59:43] were in the service one night at the
[1:59:44] church in Columbus 8100 Cooper Creek
[1:59:47] Road that's where Cal calary Assembly of
[1:59:50] God meets now in that building uh in
[1:59:52] Columbus I guess they still have church
[1:59:54] there but when we were there before we
[1:59:56] moved out here the pillar of fire came
[1:59:59] one night and hung in the in the church
[2:00:03] on about the second what would have been
[2:00:05] about the second row same pews that
[2:00:08] you're sitting on right now about where
[2:00:10] brother Shaw or where brother Miller and
[2:00:12] his wife would be sitting it hung there
[2:00:15] and every young person who came and
[2:00:18] stood under that pill of fire received
[2:00:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost one right
[2:00:23] after another I don't know how many saw
[2:00:26] it but I know the whole church
[2:00:29] experienced the fruit of the presence of
[2:00:32] God hanging in the
[2:00:35] house how many of you were there let me
[2:00:38] see your hand 1 2 3 4 five six at least
[2:00:45] seven say it again
[2:00:48] honey
[2:00:50] maybe I don't know what year it was
[2:00:52] brother I can't
[2:00:54] remember Chad do you remember you know
[2:00:58] what year this is this is
[2:01:03] 2024 I I know it's just an old testimony
[2:01:07] but let me tell the whole world he's
[2:01:08] still God let me tell you your streamers
[2:01:12] he's still
[2:01:13] God we're not asking for
[2:01:16] signs we we believe the bride is the
[2:01:19] sign and the Wonder we believe what God
[2:01:22] is doing in our lives is doing it like
[2:01:25] signs and
[2:01:26] wonders to show people the
[2:01:29] transformation of his glory presence and
[2:01:32] what happens when we get under that
[2:01:34] anointing is anybody with me
[2:01:38] Hallelujah when we
[2:01:40] worship we pour out where where am
[2:01:45] I what was I
[2:01:47] doing I talked to about the foot
[2:01:51] stols what did I do after that I don't
[2:01:55] know song or
[2:01:58] songs I can't get on rabbit
[2:02:01] Trails Song of Songs chapter 1 verse 2
[2:02:04] and 3 I'll close in a little
[2:02:06] while change from Glory yes but let me
[2:02:09] go into this let him kiss
[2:02:12] me with the kisses of his
[2:02:17] mouth that's where the Lord children
[2:02:19] would normally say
[2:02:23] yuck let him kiss me with the kisses of
[2:02:26] his mouth for thy love is better than
[2:02:30] Wine this isn't just talking about
[2:02:34] Solomon and a shulamite
[2:02:37] woman this is this is an an it's it's I
[2:02:41] don't want to call it an allegory it's
[2:02:42] more than that this is a
[2:02:45] type of the bridegroom the Heavenly
[2:02:47] bridegroom and the Earthly bride
[2:02:50] it it it's speaking about a real
[2:02:52] relationship with him we're not talking
[2:02:55] about physical kisses but I want you to
[2:02:57] know Heaven has kissed me more than one
[2:03:00] time we're not talking about the
[2:03:02] physical sensation of a kiss we're
[2:03:03] talking about the blessing the the the
[2:03:07] heaviness of the presence of God come
[2:03:09] down as I told you last Sunday the
[2:03:11] old-timers used to say it's like heaven
[2:03:13] came down and I was caught in the middle
[2:03:15] of a
[2:03:16] smack Heaven came down and kissed the
[2:03:18] Earth and I was in the middle of the
[2:03:20] smack th this is talking about a
[2:03:22] relationship we want to fall so much in
[2:03:24] love with Jesus that when we speak his
[2:03:27] name we're even careful about how we
[2:03:29] speak
[2:03:31] it we want to always say it with love
[2:03:35] and and and fullness of
[2:03:37] expression sometimes the greatest
[2:03:39] worship that you can accomplish is just
[2:03:42] Whispering the name
[2:03:44] Jesus if you like to say his Hebrew name
[2:03:48] you can say
[2:03:50] Yeshua there's something about just
[2:03:52] speaking his name reverently just
[2:03:55] Whispering his name as you bow your
[2:03:57] heart before him that can be so
[2:04:00] impactful and be so helpful in a message
[2:04:04] called what house will you build
[2:04:08] me brother brandham said and I I want
[2:04:12] you if you will to to skip to the to the
[2:04:14] highlighted part for me it's all
[2:04:17] good he said here we must
[2:04:20] Worship in the
[2:04:23] spirit not only our
[2:04:26] message should be the flame of the
[2:04:29] hour it should be the flame in our
[2:04:34] hearts see he said it's got to be next
[2:04:38] place it's got to be in our
[2:04:40] hearts we can't rightly present it to
[2:04:43] the
[2:04:45] people unless it's in our hearts the
[2:04:48] spirit has to pack the message itself
[2:04:50] and I'm trusting and believing in every
[2:04:52] one of you to be a real Christian we're
[2:04:54] talking about having a real relationship
[2:04:57] with Jesus Christ how many of you know
[2:04:59] God doesn't have any grandchildren I
[2:05:01] Can't Get To Heaven on my grandmother's
[2:05:03] experience or my dad's or my mom's
[2:05:06] experience I've got to have my
[2:05:08] own so so praise until the spirit of
[2:05:12] worship comes worship until the glory
[2:05:15] comes and then stand in the glory
[2:05:19] let me read about standing in the glory
[2:05:21] Isaiah 6 1-4 I'll take a few more
[2:05:24] minutes and close in the year that King
[2:05:27] Uzziah
[2:05:29] died I saw also the Lord this is in the
[2:05:34] new
[2:05:35] notes sitting upon a
[2:05:39] throne I saw the
[2:05:41] Lord sitting upon a throne
[2:05:47] High
[2:05:50] and lifted
[2:05:51] up Benjamin will you take these glasses
[2:05:53] to Mama ask her to wash them I'm sweat
[2:05:56] till it's run down the my lens and I
[2:05:58] can't see through them anymore thank you
[2:06:00] son except I'm going to have to read
[2:06:02] from my notes because I can't see that
[2:06:05] now in the year that King uzai died I
[2:06:08] saw also the Lord sitting upon the
[2:06:10] throne high and lifted up and his
[2:06:13] trained filled the
[2:06:17] temple I thought it was the
[2:06:20] bride that had a
[2:06:24] train I thought the bride had a veil and
[2:06:27] sometime that Veil runs long down the
[2:06:31] aisle the bride comes down the aisle in
[2:06:33] that long train but here Isaiah saw the
[2:06:35] bridegroom
[2:06:36] King and his train filled the temple
[2:06:41] above it stood the
[2:06:43] sarapes and these sarapes were were the
[2:06:46] angels of Fire
[2:06:49] the word sarap speaks about fire thank

[2:07:09] his face with with Twain which is two he
[2:07:12] covered his feet and with Twain he did
[2:07:16] fly they not only had the ability to fly
[2:07:19] they had the ability to communicate to
[2:07:21] one another and one Cried unto another

[2:07:35] hosts somebody said I don't like this
[2:07:37] the some of these modern worship zones
[2:07:39] they just say the same thing over and
[2:07:40] over again so did the seraphim
[2:07:47] holy the old old days we sung Glory
[2:07:49] Glory Hallelujah for an
[2:07:52] hour holy holy holy
[2:07:57] woo I can hardly say it without feeling
[2:08:02] something you're you're connecting to
[2:08:05] God when you say holy holy holy is the
[2:08:09] Lord of

[2:08:19] we sing about here

[2:08:35] armies they said holy holy holy is the
[2:08:39] Lord of hosts adonit of the oat the
[2:08:43] whole earth is
[2:08:46] full of his glory yes and the post
[2:08:51] listened the post of the door moved at
[2:08:56] the voice of him that
[2:09:00] cried can you imagine this P pit just
[2:09:04] beginning to
[2:09:06] shake as the voice of worship began to
[2:09:10] be lifted up in this
[2:09:12] house and the house was filled
[2:09:17] with
[2:09:20] with
[2:09:22] smoke that blue
[2:09:25] haze that I've seen so many times in my
[2:09:28] spiritual
[2:09:29] life it's like a smoke but has a has a
[2:09:33] bluish tint grayish bluish tent and it's
[2:09:37] a
[2:09:39] manifestation of the sh or the Shaka
[2:09:43] glory of the Lord and it was so
[2:09:46] manifested that even the door
[2:09:49] began to tremble at the voice of Praise
[2:09:53] of him that cried holy holy holy holy
[2:09:56] holy holy holy holy holy in a message
[2:10:00] Revelation chapter 4 number
[2:10:02] three he said let's see Isaiah the 6th
[2:10:05] chapter this young Prophet had been
[2:10:07] leaning on the arms of the Good King and
[2:10:09] he had brought him all kinds of nice
[2:10:11] clothes he was a prophet he was going
[2:10:13] along but one day the king died so he
[2:10:17] had to shift for himself so he went down
[2:10:20] to the temple to
[2:10:22] pray here brother brandom is indicating
[2:10:25] that Isaiah had been clinging to to the
[2:10:28] the coattail of his mentor the king he
[2:10:33] loved the king he lived his life in
[2:10:35] service to the king but God was about to
[2:10:38] show Isaiah something that he could have
[2:10:41] never showed him as long as Uzziah was
[2:10:43] his
[2:10:44] Focus you've got to get your eyes off of
[2:10:47] your past
[2:10:49] sometime you got to get your eyes off of
[2:10:52] your boss man sometime to be able to put
[2:10:56] your eyes on the one who can change
[2:11:00] you he said he had to shift for himself
[2:11:03] so we went down to the temple to pray
[2:11:04] let's go on because he began to get out
[2:11:06] from amongst where the king's place
[2:11:08] was good old King was a good holy man
[2:11:12] but he got out and seen how the people
[2:11:14] was living so he got down to the temple
[2:11:17] now
[2:11:18] listen in that year that King he's
[2:11:21] quoting in the year that King oziah died
[2:11:22] I saw the Lord sitting upon the throne
[2:11:25] high and lifted up and his train filled
[2:11:26] the temple he goes on Glory now listen
[2:11:29] to this what's his
[2:11:32] train he said there it is
[2:11:35] Angels
[2:11:38] beings his train that followed
[2:11:42] him the trains what comes behind him he
[2:11:47] is telling us from his
[2:11:49] Revelation that when Isaiah saw the Lord
[2:11:52] and his train was behind him and it
[2:11:55] filled the whole Temple that it was the
[2:11:57] created
[2:12:00] beings perhaps it was cherub beams and
[2:12:04] sarapes maybe even four living creatures
[2:12:07] showed up and courses of
[2:12:11] angels and filled the house of the Lord
[2:12:14] filled the Temple of the Lord the glory
[2:12:17] f build the
[2:12:19] temple in such a way that it looked like
[2:12:24] a a a king with a train coming behind
[2:12:27] him but it was the it was perhaps the
[2:12:30] created beings the created
[2:12:32] worshippers that had come to blend
[2:12:35] listen that had come to blend their
[2:12:38] worship with the worship of of he
[2:12:41] Heavenly Heavenly Creatures coming to
[2:12:44] blend their worship with Earth
[2:12:47] dwellers can you imagine a moment that
[2:12:50] we get caught up into a place of Glory
[2:12:53] where Heaven comes and living creatures
[2:12:56] and seraphim and cherubims join in our
[2:12:59] worship come on and our voices and the
[2:13:07] sound and the sound of our worship is
[2:13:10] joined with the worship of the
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:13] woo and you think you're going to strut
[2:13:15] out of here the same if you were to come
[2:13:18] into that kind of an
[2:13:21] atmosphere somebody said when's that
[2:13:23] going to happen it's going to happen
[2:13:25] when we begin to position ourselves and
[2:13:27] get
[2:13:29] ready sir we've got to give the glory a
[2:13:32] landing Place
[2:13:34] hello I'm getting ahead of
[2:13:37] myself let me give you one more place
[2:13:39] like that in in Ezekiel 10 3-5 now the
[2:13:43] Cherry beam stood on the right side of
[2:13:45] the house when the man went in and the
[2:13:48] Cloud filled the inner Court then the
[2:13:50] glory of the Lord went up from the
[2:13:53] Cherub and stood over the threshold of
[2:13:55] the house and the house was filled with
[2:13:58] a cloud and the court was full of the
[2:14:03] brightness of the Lord's Glory
[2:14:05] Hallelujah and the sound of the
[2:14:07] cherubim's Wings Was
[2:14:10] Heard even to the outer
[2:14:12] Court as the voice of the almighty God
[2:14:16] when he speaketh
[2:14:19] the sound of the Wings and the praise of
[2:14:23] the Cherub beams thundered in the house
[2:14:26] of the Lord like it was the Lord
[2:14:29] Almighty speaking for
[2:14:33] himself who'd like to be caught up into
[2:14:35] a worship meeting like that somebody
[2:14:38] said that's all Old Testament because
[2:14:41] Jesus is the manifestation of God's
[2:14:43] glory that is absolutely right but we
[2:14:46] have no reason to believe believe that
[2:14:48] we can't Worship in the fullness of his
[2:14:51] glory the word Glory Appears 402 times
[2:14:54] in the Bible in 372 excuse me 371
[2:14:59] different verses 402 times in 371 verses
[2:15:04] in the Bible both Old Testament and New
[2:15:06] Testament the word glory is used to
[2:15:09] describe the Splendor and Majesty of
[2:15:11] God's presence it comes from the Hebrew
[2:15:14] word cabode or cavod which means
[2:15:19] weighty for the glory to be manifested
[2:15:23] in a house in a people there must be a
[2:15:27] place for the glory to
[2:15:30] dwell he doesn't want to just
[2:15:33] land he wants to saturate us the word
[2:15:36] shakina or sh in Hebrew which is used to
[2:15:40] refer to the glory of God it literally
[2:15:42] means a Dwelling Place of God so the sh
[2:15:46] or the shakina really means a a a
[2:15:50] place where God
[2:15:53] dwells if we want the glory to appear we
[2:15:56] have to create a Dwelling Place a temple
[2:16:00] a
[2:16:01] tabernacle a house for God to live in
[2:16:05] that means we can't fill it with all the
[2:16:07] garbage of the world and the
[2:16:10] trash of
[2:16:12] 2024 it means we might need a little
[2:16:15] Nest netflex time and a little more
[2:16:17] Bible
[2:16:19] time if we're wanting to build a place a
[2:16:22] house for God to dwell in for the glory
[2:16:25] to come and not only minister to you but
[2:16:27] Minister through you it changes
[2:16:31] everything God is looking for a place to
[2:16:33] put his presence when Abraham brought
[2:16:36] Isaac to Mount Moriah to sacrifice him
[2:16:39] he was creating an opportunity for God's
[2:16:41] glory to be revealed through his
[2:16:43] obedience when Moses stretched his Rod
[2:16:45] across the Red Sea he was created an
[2:16:47] opportunity for God to come and show his
[2:16:50] glory and salvation when Joshua marched
[2:16:53] around Jericho for seven days he was
[2:16:55] creating a place for God's power to fall
[2:16:58] and His glory to be revealed every one
[2:17:00] of those places was an act of
[2:17:03] obedience Abraham was obeying the voice
[2:17:06] of God Moses was obeying the voice of
[2:17:08] God Joshua was obeying the voice of God
[2:17:11] so if we want to create in us a place
[2:17:13] for the glory to dwell we do it with our
[2:17:16] obedience yes sir much more than our
[2:17:19] sacrifice when Solomon built a temple in
[2:17:22] obedience the glory of God came I read
[2:17:24] it as we opened the
[2:17:26] service when Moses built the Tabernacle
[2:17:29] before that it gave God a Dwelling Place
[2:17:31] let's look at it quickly Exodus 40
[2:17:35] 33-35 and he reared up the court round
[2:17:38] about the Tabernacle and the Altar and
[2:17:40] set up the hanging of the Court gate so
[2:17:42] Moses finished the work then a cloud
[2:17:45] covered the tent of the congregation and
[2:17:48] the glory of the Lord
[2:17:51] filled filled the
[2:17:55] Tabernacle and Moses was not able to
[2:17:57] enter into the tent of the congregation
[2:17:59] because the glory Abode thereon and the
[2:18:02] glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle
[2:18:05] Moses obeyed God and built him a place
[2:18:09] for the glory to come will you obey
[2:18:12] God come on Church we're coming to an
[2:18:14] end will you obey God in your own life
[2:18:18] are you
[2:18:23] willing are you willing to be a
[2:18:25] [Music]
[2:18:26] place where the
[2:18:28] cavod the shech of God can sit down in
[2:18:32] your
[2:18:33] life and settled down in your
[2:18:37] life if you become a Dwelling Place For
[2:18:39] the Glory it's not going to be just
[2:18:41] praise the Lord
[2:18:43] anyhow you're going to see praise as a
[2:18:45] Priestly Ministry
[2:18:48] anybody who teaches that the priesthood
[2:18:50] is over has missed the whole purpose of
[2:18:52] the priesthood the priesthood of the Old
[2:18:55] Testament was to reveal to you the
[2:18:57] priesthood of the New Testament and
[2:18:59] every person in this room that's a
[2:19:01] Believer if you're washed in the blood
[2:19:03] of Jesus Christ and you're believing the
[2:19:05] spirit of God has Sanctified you and
[2:19:08] washed you clean filled you with the
[2:19:09] Holy Ghost you are a priest unto the
[2:19:14] Lord you know everybody likes to look at
[2:19:17] a Pastor is a priest the problem with
[2:19:20] that is the pastor is often ministering
[2:19:21] to the people that's not what a priest
[2:19:25] did a priest ministered to
[2:19:29] God your first Duty as a priest in this
[2:19:35] spiritual
[2:19:36] priesthood is to minister to God
[2:19:39] first because if we don't minister to
[2:19:42] God we have nothing to minister to one
[2:19:44] another you cannot release what you
[2:19:47] don't
[2:19:48] possess you cannot impart what you
[2:19:50] haven't experienced help me and the
[2:19:53] devil wants to disqualify you musicians
[2:19:55] are coming the devil wants to disqualify
[2:19:58] you he wants to talk you out of of being
[2:20:02] a candidate yes sir to receive a real
[2:20:05] encounter with God you need to tell I
[2:20:07] can't tell him for you you need to tell
[2:20:09] the Devil he's a
[2:20:11] liar you need to tell him the token is
[2:20:13] applied to your life you need to tell
[2:20:16] him that the Holy Ghost lives in you and
[2:20:18] that makes you a candidate as a priest
[2:20:20] unto the Lord to minister to the Lord
[2:20:24] first and how do we do that in Praise In
[2:20:28] Worship in adoration in
[2:20:32] obedience it's true that Jesus Christ
[2:20:35] was the manifestation of God's glory in
[2:20:37] the earth Isaiah 40 and verse 5 and the
[2:20:40] glory of the Lord shall be revealed and
[2:20:45] All Flesh shall see it together for the
[2:20:49] mouth of the Lord hath spoken it this
[2:20:52] scripture is fulfilled in the body of
[2:20:56] our Lord Jesus Christ he was the glory
[2:20:59] of the Lord revealed in flesh to
[2:21:04] flesh but when we receive the Holy Ghost
[2:21:07] we receive the very same spirit that
[2:21:10] lived in Jesus Christ as I said a moment
[2:21:14] ago that's why he said you know the
[2:21:17] church has got him so chopped up until
[2:21:20] really modern Doctrine has got God so
[2:21:23] chopped up into so many
[2:21:27] pieces they talk more about how he
[2:21:29] operates separate than they do how he
[2:21:31] operates
[2:21:34] together that's why Jesus we have to
[2:21:36] keep going back and reading the red
[2:21:38] letters Jesus must have known what the
[2:21:41] church was going to do to the Bible when
[2:21:42] he kept telling them over go when you've
[2:21:44] seen me you've seen the father goes I my
[2:21:46] father one what I carry the essence of
[2:21:49] what's inside of me is my father this is
[2:21:52] the spirit of the father that's in me
[2:21:54] come on and therefore if you're baptized
[2:21:56] with the Holy Ghost that same spirit
[2:21:58] that was in Jesus Christ is in you and
[2:22:01] that's why we hear him telling us over
[2:22:03] and over again that all the father was
[2:22:07] he poured into the son and all that the
[2:22:09] son was he poured where into his church
[2:22:14] amen to empower you as priests
[2:22:18] unto the most high god oh I want to
[2:22:21] worship
[2:22:22] him oh I want to worship Him in spirit
[2:22:25] and in
[2:22:27] truth and then in closing really
[2:22:29] honestly really
[2:22:31] truly 2 Corinthians 3:17 and 18 we'll
[2:22:34] pick this up Tuesday night I just want
[2:22:36] to read the verse now the Lord is that
[2:22:39] Spirit we're in the New Testament now
[2:22:43] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[2:22:46] the spirit of of the Lord
[2:22:50] is 2 Corinthians
[2:22:53] 3:17 and where the spirit of the Lord
[2:22:57] is there
[2:23:01] is there
[2:23:05] is freedom is a little different than
[2:23:09] Liberty Liberty is something that's been
[2:23:11] paid
[2:23:15] for Liberty is free Freedom that's been
[2:23:18] paid
[2:23:20] for I want you to know our lord Jesus
[2:23:22] Yeshua the Messiah he paid for our
[2:23:25] freedom oh yes he gave us
[2:23:28] Liberty the Liberties that we enjoy as
[2:23:30] an American citizen wasn't free a price
[2:23:34] had to be paid for it come on little
[2:23:37] little patriotic when you begin to think
[2:23:39] about it well it's the same thing
[2:23:40] spiritually the freedom that you and I
[2:23:43] have as New Testament Believers full of
[2:23:44] the Holy Ghost it's it's not something
[2:23:46] that Just Came Upon Us free it's
[2:23:48] something that Jesus had to pay a great
[2:23:50] price come on and and I want you to know
[2:23:53] if you walk in Liberty today you're
[2:23:55] going to have to pay a price to hold on
[2:23:57] to it because the enemy wants to put you
[2:24:00] in a box he wants to depress you and
[2:24:03] deflate
[2:24:04] you he wants to suck the life out of you
[2:24:07] come on he wants you shuffling around
[2:24:10] like a like someone who only knows
[2:24:12] defeat hello he wants you to look like
[2:24:16] you've lost your best
[2:24:20] friend I wonder how we look as we go
[2:24:23] about the the the town and we do the
[2:24:25] things we have to do I wonder sometimes
[2:24:26] if people look at us oh there goes that
[2:24:28] bound up bunch of people you
[2:24:31] know they act a little different dress a
[2:24:34] little different you know behave oh
[2:24:36] they're just in so much bondage they're
[2:24:37] just all beat down they have no joy you
[2:24:39] ought to show
[2:24:41] them you ought to go out you ought to
[2:24:43] smile the biggest
[2:24:45] smile because he who whom the sun sets
[2:24:47] free is not just free hello he whom the
[2:24:51] sun sets free is
[2:24:56] what remember the Bible said You shall
[2:24:59] know the
[2:25:01] truth make come on and the truth shall
[2:25:05] what make you free read
[2:25:09] it not just set you free make you free
[2:25:14] there's a transformation that takes
[2:25:16] place in the Spirit you are reshaped and
[2:25:19] refashioned and remolded when you come
[2:25:22] out of
[2:25:23] bondage woo you've got to learn to live
[2:25:26] like a free person how many of you know
[2:25:29] someone who spent years in prison has to
[2:25:32] make that adjustment once they realize
[2:25:34] they're
[2:25:35] free My grandmother used to talk about a
[2:25:38] stall fed
[2:25:42] calf a calf that didn't run out and feed
[2:25:45] uh feed in the field but was fed maybe
[2:25:48] the mother rejected it or something and
[2:25:50] and it had to be fed in the
[2:25:53] stall and so it had spent the early days
[2:25:57] of his life locked up in a little stall
[2:25:59] so he could be fed because you know you
[2:26:01] have to feed him very very often when
[2:26:03] their mama has rejected them if you
[2:26:05] don't have another heer to put them with
[2:26:07] and my granny used to say living on the
[2:26:10] farm and heard daddy would lock up a a a
[2:26:14] a calf like that and feed it in the
[2:26:15] stall and when it come time she said my
[2:26:17] favorite time was the day that we let
[2:26:20] set the little calf out and let it let
[2:26:21] it join the let it join the
[2:26:26] rest oh she said you ought to see it
[2:26:28] said all that's ever known is just
[2:26:30] standing up laying down standing up
[2:26:31] laying down just a little bit of room to
[2:26:33] turn around and you have to do that just
[2:26:35] for the convenience of having it handy
[2:26:37] every time you needed to feed it all
[2:26:39] through the day and
[2:26:40] night in the early days of his life day
[2:26:43] and night oh but she said at breakfast
[2:26:47] when Dad would say today I'm going to
[2:26:50] set the little calf free she said we all
[2:26:52] would go out to see it and when they
[2:26:54] slid those Boards out of the way she
[2:26:57] said you'd think that little calf
[2:26:58] wouldn't know what to
[2:27:02] do itd start making its way out you know
[2:27:05] looking around all of a sudden it'd go
[2:27:07] out about six feet out of that stall and
[2:27:09] you've never seen anything like when it
[2:27:12] discovered what grass felt
[2:27:14] like she say Throw itself down and roll
[2:27:18] in the
[2:27:20] grass then it' jump up and she said it
[2:27:23] would touch his his Hooves together like
[2:27:27] that front front Hooves would touch the
[2:27:29] back Hooves as he would just spring like
[2:27:32] that all over the yard she said that's
[2:27:34] how I felt when Jesus Set Me Free I felt
[2:27:37] like a staff fed cow stall fed
[2:27:42] cast we had to learn to enjoy our
[2:27:45] freedom
[2:27:47] we had to learn to enjoy our Liberty
[2:27:50] because he whom the sun sets free is

[2:58:44] when you prayed this
[2:58:46] week would you also remember brother
[2:58:50] Steve and sister Beth Pok son Josh who
[2:58:54] was in a terrible car accident this
[2:58:56] week who was burned all down the left
[2:58:59] side I think it was left side of his
[2:59:01] body is in the in the Grady hospital
[2:59:06] they took him there and downtown Atlanta
[2:59:09] and I was sitting in the parking lot of
[2:59:13] home Depot last night waiting on my
[2:59:16] family I wasn't in a shopping mood and
[2:59:19] was listening to worship and all of a
[2:59:21] sudden I heard the spirit of the Lord
[2:59:23] say call them right now I had been
[2:59:25] wondering what would be a good time to
[2:59:27] call them because they've been driving
[2:59:29] back and forth they won't let them stay
[2:59:30] at night and they've been driving back
[2:59:32] and forth from here all the way to
[2:59:34] Atlanta every day and when I called it
[2:59:37] was a perfect time they were driving
[2:59:39] home last night and the wonderful
[2:59:42] presence of the Lord just even as we
[2:59:44] talked and he's got to have a real
[2:59:46] Awakening in his life and he's got to
[2:59:48] see his value is found in Christ so
[2:59:51] would you ask the Lord you know the
[2:59:53] times that they've requested prayer for
[2:59:55] him Lord
[2:59:57] Jesus you see that little
[3:00:01] brother Lord you know his life and you
[3:00:03] know where he stands right now and you
[3:00:05] know how the enemy tried to take him out
[3:00:08] toled out the vehicle and it caught on
[3:00:12] fire and Lord uh you spared his
[3:00:16] life and I don't believe you did that
[3:00:18] for him to serve
[3:00:20] sin I believe you did that for him to
[3:00:22] serve you so Lord I'm asking you to
[3:00:24] break through in his
[3:00:26] life break through God in his life
[3:00:31] reveal your love for him he's got to see
[3:00:35] and only you can cause him to see your
[3:00:38] love for him
[3:00:39] Lord touch his body and he's going to
[3:00:43] require us at least one skin graph be
[3:00:46] with him Lord during this difficult time
[3:00:49] and be with Brother Steve sister Beth is
