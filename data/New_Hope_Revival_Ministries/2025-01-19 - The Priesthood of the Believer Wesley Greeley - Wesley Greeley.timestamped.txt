[1:02:19] um it's it's sad to see that there have

[1:02:30] it's it's hard to watch but I'm glad to

[1:02:52] of Heaven into the Earth to see all of
[1:02:55] the plans of Heaven carried out in the
[1:02:58] earth in the end time 1 Corinthians
[1:03:00] chapter 3 while you're standing verses
[1:03:02] 16 and
[1:03:03] 17 probably familiar to you know ye not
[1:03:09] that ye are the temple of God and that
[1:03:11] the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any
[1:03:15] man defile the temple of God him shall
[1:03:19] God destroy for the temple of God is
[1:03:23] Holy which Temple ye
[1:03:27] are If any man defile the temple of God
[1:03:30] him shall God destroy for the temple of
[1:03:33] God is Holy which Temple you are all
[1:03:38] right so then uh let's just flip over to
[1:03:41] 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:03:44] 6 verses 9-
[1:03:48] 20 then we'll pray and let you have your
[1:03:52] seat 1 Corinthians 6:9 know ye not that
[1:03:56] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:03:58] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:04:02] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[1:04:06] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:04:10] with
[1:04:10] mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[1:04:15] drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners
[1:04:19] shall inherit the kingdom of
[1:04:22] God and such were some of you but you
[1:04:27] are
[1:04:28] washed but you are
[1:04:31] Sanctified but you are justified in the
[1:04:33] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[1:04:36] of our God all things are lawful unto me
[1:04:40] but not all things but all things are
[1:04:44] not expedient or profitable all things
[1:04:48] are lawful for me but I will not be
[1:04:51] brought under the power of any meet for
[1:04:56] the belly the belly for Meats but God
[1:04:58] shall destroy both it and them now the
[1:05:02] body is not for fornication but for the
[1:05:05] Lord and the Lord for the body and God
[1:05:08] hath both raised up the Lord and will
[1:05:12] also raise up Us by his own
[1:05:16] power know ye not that your bodies are
[1:05:19] the members of Christ shall I then take
[1:05:23] the members of Christ and make them the
[1:05:26] members of an Harlot God
[1:05:30] forbid what know ye not that he which is
[1:05:34] joined to an Harlot is one body for two
[1:05:38] saith he shall be one flesh but he that
[1:05:42] is joined unto the Lord is one
[1:05:46] Spirit flee
[1:05:49] fornication every sin that a man doeth
[1:05:51] is without the body but he that
[1:05:54] committeth fornication sinth against his
[1:05:57] own
[1:05:58] body what know you not that your body is
[1:06:02] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[1:06:05] you which you have of God and you are
[1:06:09] not your own for you are bought with a
[1:06:13] price therefore glorify God in your body
[1:06:17] and in your spirit which are
[1:06:20] Gods let's pray before you're seated
[1:06:23] today heavenly father I want to thank
[1:06:25] you for your love and your grace I want
[1:06:28] to thank you for all the kindness that

[1:06:46] Lord we have had a time of worship and
[1:06:50] we're looking now to your word and
[1:06:52] asking you that you would speak to us
[1:06:55] from your word God let us gain uh
[1:06:58] knowledge and nuggets from it that will
[1:07:01] help us in our journey from here forward
[1:07:04] you see all of the needs among the body
[1:07:07] and those that are watching by way of
[1:07:09] stream and I'm asking you that God you
[1:07:12] would speak to us from your word hide
[1:07:14] your
[1:07:15] servant hide all of his inabilities Lord
[1:07:19] may you speak forth from these lips of
[1:07:21] clay and may you get the glory and all
[1:07:24] the honor for for it is in the name of
[1:07:26] the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:07:28] pray amen you may have your seats
[1:07:44] today we've been hearing preaching over
[1:07:47] the last weeks and
[1:07:50] months and we want to
[1:07:54] uh just read a scripture here into the
[1:07:57] record that we heard uh not long ago
[1:08:01] from our pastor in John Chapter 2 ver
[1:08:05] 17- 22 and his disciples remembered that
[1:08:10] it was written the Zeal of thine house
[1:08:14] hath eaten me up then answered the Jews
[1:08:18] and said unto him what sign showest thou
[1:08:20] unto us seeing that thou doest these
[1:08:23] things Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:08:27] destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will
[1:08:31] raise it up then said the Jews 46 years
[1:08:35] was this temple in building and will you
[1:08:38] rear it up in three days but he spake of
[1:08:41] the Temple of his body when therefore he
[1:08:45] was risen from the dead his disciples
[1:08:47] remembered that he had said this unto
[1:08:49] them and they believed the scripture and
[1:08:52] the word which Jesus had said
[1:08:56] now brother Shelly has been teaching us
[1:08:59] over the course of weeks and months
[1:09:01] about guarding our heart and that the
[1:09:04] Zeal of the Lord's house or the Zeal of
[1:09:06] the house of the Lord hath eaten me up
[1:09:09] uh he's been addressing the the Inner
[1:09:12] Man things that go on in the sole realm
[1:09:15] of of this human that we are uh we once
[1:09:20] again we understand that we are Spirit
[1:09:24] soul and body and uh that God has
[1:09:29] redeemed our spirit to himself we carry
[1:09:33] a measure of the spirit of God within us
[1:09:36] we already know that we're going to
[1:09:39] receive a new
[1:09:41] body this body we're going to lay down
[1:09:44] and it's going to go back to ashes and
[1:09:46] we get a new body I don't know exactly
[1:09:49] what that will look like I don't know
[1:09:51] how to describe it in in in English
[1:09:54] language all I know is that I'm
[1:09:56] expecting a new body uh this one is
[1:10:00] failing me and and yours is failing you
[1:10:04] but we're thankful that we have this
[1:10:06] body to be able to uh get around the
[1:10:09] earth God put us on the earth for a
[1:10:11] reason and he gave us a human body to uh
[1:10:14] he didn't send us here as an angel he
[1:10:17] didn't send us here as a ghost he didn't
[1:10:20] send us here as as just a spirit he sent
[1:10:24] us here as a human being being and when
[1:10:26] he sent us he sent us with a human being
[1:10:29] as a human being he didn't send us as a
[1:10:34] robot he sent us here with a mind a will
[1:10:39] and with
[1:10:42] emotions and he sent us
[1:10:47] here so that we could demonstrate our
[1:10:52] love for him and he had already provided
[1:10:56] a way for us to get back to him he did
[1:11:00] not send us here and when our Earthly
[1:11:03] days were over that was it he sent us
[1:11:07] here for a purpose to demonstrate to the
[1:11:12] world that there is somebody who is not
[1:11:16] going to just survive in the end time
[1:11:19] but someone who is going to thrive
[1:11:22] someone who is going to overcome every
[1:11:25] Spirit of this age they're going to
[1:11:29] overcome all of the uh antagonists that
[1:11:32] are out there trying to get you to flub
[1:11:39] up some of you that have lived a long
[1:11:43] time in the world there are those who
[1:11:46] have watched you through the years and
[1:11:49] they're just waiting for you to mess up
[1:11:52] well I'm calling by the spirit of God
[1:11:54] today
[1:11:55] that you are not going to mess up but
[1:11:59] you are going to overcome you're going
[1:12:02] to show the world that the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:06] able to get inside of a person and able
[1:12:10] to give them the grace to overcome in
[1:12:13] Satan's Eden even when everybody is
[1:12:15] sitting around waiting for you to mess
[1:12:21] up there is the possibility
[1:12:26] but I'm glad today for the grace of God
[1:12:30] that I don't have to be steeped in man's
[1:12:34] religion until that when I mess up all
[1:12:38] of the sudden all the good that God has
[1:12:40] brought me through and two I don't have
[1:12:43] to throw it to the wind and say I'm
[1:12:46] messed up I must be going to hell I must
[1:12:48] not be saved I don't have to live under
[1:12:51] that bondage and you don't have to live
[1:12:54] under that Bond bondage when God saved
[1:12:57] you he didn't save you to lose you he
[1:13:00] saved you to take you all the way
[1:13:02] through and that is the plan that he has
[1:13:05] for your life to take you all the way
[1:13:08] through so when the Lord saves you and
[1:13:11] he baptizes you in the Holy Ghost you
[1:13:15] walk in Christian baptism the baptized
[1:13:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:20] you've repented of your sins you have
[1:13:23] become the candidate for the baptism of
[1:13:25] the Holy Ghost and he doesn't just stop
[1:13:28] with the initial baptism but he
[1:13:31] continues to give us fillings day by day
[1:13:36] by
[1:13:37] day so we're looking at the Temple of
[1:13:41] the Holy Ghost when when Jesus told them
[1:13:46] the Zeal of thine house ha eaten me up
[1:13:49] and then he told them you can destroy
[1:13:52] this Temple and in three days I'll raise
[1:13:55] it back up because that they were so
[1:13:58] human- minded they were so with what
[1:14:00] they could see they did not realize he
[1:14:03] wasn't talking about a
[1:14:08] building he was talking about his own
[1:14:11] self in three
[1:14:14] days destroy this Temple and in three
[1:14:17] days I'll raise it back up and he was
[1:14:21] speaking concerning his body now we know
[1:14:26] that we are a part of the body of the
[1:14:28] Lord and and we've just read that we are
[1:14:31] the Temple of the Holy Ghost or what
[1:14:35] don't you know that you are that your
[1:14:38] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and
[1:14:41] so we are as humans we are the Temple of
[1:14:46] the Holy Ghost and uh we have been
[1:14:50] instructed that we need to take care of
[1:14:53] the Temple
[1:14:57] as with a four-walled
[1:15:00] structure there is maintenance that has
[1:15:02] to be
[1:15:05] done otherwise things begin to fall into
[1:15:11] disrepair those of us who have watched
[1:15:13] things through the
[1:15:15] years and and have had some
[1:15:18] experience uh I've had an I've had
[1:15:21] experiences with vehicles and watching
[1:15:24] homes
[1:15:25] and if they are not used and they are
[1:15:28] not kept in
[1:15:30] repair they end up falling
[1:15:34] apart if a vehicle sits idle for a long
[1:15:37] time the seals begin to dry rot and then
[1:15:41] when it is moved they begin to leak
[1:15:45] fluid a home that is I I don't really
[1:15:50] understand because uh it seems to me
[1:15:53] like that if a roof is roof is a roof
[1:15:56] but it seems that you can watch homes
[1:15:58] that are not lived
[1:16:00] in and they begin to
[1:16:03] Decay well it seemed you know just
[1:16:05] logically to me if it's got a good
[1:16:09] shingle roof on it and nobody's living
[1:16:12] in there or if somebody's living in
[1:16:15] there it doesn't seem that that shingle
[1:16:17] roof is going to deteriorate at any
[1:16:20] different level of speed than it would
[1:16:22] if somebody did live in there but but it
[1:16:25] seems as though if nobody lives in a
[1:16:27] home it starts
[1:16:29] decaying just starts decaying start
[1:16:32] decaying and there's there's no
[1:16:34] maintenance to it there there's no
[1:16:36] upkeep that has been done to it and so
[1:16:39] there is necessity to to upkeep the
[1:16:43] house the building the four walls uh
[1:16:46] there was a necessity to upkeep the
[1:16:51] temple there was a necessity to to look
[1:16:55] out for things and so that is what I
[1:16:58] would like to try to address today and I
[1:17:02] I would like for us to go to the Psalms
[1:17:05] and read Psalm
[1:17:08] 27 this is a familiar
[1:17:14] Psalm the Lord is my light and my
[1:17:19] salvation Whom Shall I
[1:17:22] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:17:27] of whom shall I be
[1:17:29] afraid when the wicked even mine enemies
[1:17:33] and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my
[1:17:36] flesh they stumbled and
[1:17:39] fell though in host should encamp
[1:17:42] against me my heart should not
[1:17:46] fear though War should rise against me
[1:17:50] in this I will be
[1:17:52] confident one thing have I desired of
[1:17:55] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[1:17:59] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:18:03] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:18:07] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:18:10] Temple for in the time of trouble he
[1:18:13] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[1:18:16] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:18:19] me he shall set me upon a rock and now
[1:18:24] shall mine head be lifted up above mine
[1:18:27] enemies round about me therefore will I
[1:18:31] offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:18:34] Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises
[1:18:39] unto the Lord here oh Lord when I cry
[1:18:42] with my voice have mercy upon me and
[1:18:46] answer me when thou s seek my face my
[1:18:51] heart said unto thee thy fa face oh Lord
[1:18:56] will I
[1:18:57] seek hide not thy face far from me put
[1:19:01] not thy servant away in Anger thou has
[1:19:04] been my help leave me not neither
[1:19:08] forsake me oh god of my
[1:19:12] salvation when my father and my mother
[1:19:15] forsake me then the Lord will take me
[1:19:19] up teach me thy ways oh Lord and Lead Me
[1:19:25] in a plain path because of mine enemies
[1:19:28] Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of
[1:19:31] mine enemies for false Witnesses are
[1:19:34] risen up against me and such as breathe
[1:19:37] out
[1:19:38] cruelty Deliver Me Not Over unto the
[1:19:42] will of mine enemies for false Witnesses
[1:19:45] uh I'm reading it again are risen up
[1:19:47] against me and such as breathe out
[1:19:49] cruelty I had fainted unless I had
[1:19:53] believed to see the the goodness of the
[1:19:55] Lord in the land of the living wait on
[1:20:00] the Lord be of good courage and he shall
[1:20:04] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[1:20:09] Lord now I want to go back to verse four
[1:20:14] because David is expressing who he knows
[1:20:19] the Lord is and he's expressing the
[1:20:23] thought that he had enemies all around
[1:20:26] him but he knew that there was a place
[1:20:29] that he could feel safe and that was in
[1:20:32] verse four one thing have I desired of
[1:20:34] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[1:20:38] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:20:40] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:20:44] of the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:20:50] Temple as I was
[1:20:52] reading this a several several weeks ago
[1:20:56] the word
[1:20:57] inquire jumped out at
[1:21:00] me
[1:21:02] because when
[1:21:06] we we have in other translations this
[1:21:10] word is spelled i n qu i r e to inquire
[1:21:16] about
[1:21:18] something and this is just really it's a
[1:21:22] different spelling of the word inquir
[1:21:26] and it means to
[1:21:28] seek or to
[1:21:30] consider or to look for or to
[1:21:34] reflect but as I continued to read
[1:21:38] definitions down
[1:21:41] underneath there was a definition that
[1:21:44] caused me to think about what God has
[1:21:47] been speaking to us over the course of
[1:21:50] weeks and months and and this word can
[1:21:53] also mean to plow or to break
[1:21:58] forth and figuratively to inspect or to
[1:22:03] care for or to seek out and it can also
[1:22:08] mean to cleave or to
[1:22:13] open now when we think about cleaving
[1:22:17] something those of you that are old
[1:22:19] enough to know what a meat cleaver looks
[1:22:24] like
[1:22:25] like when meat
[1:22:28] is cleaved is that correct cleaved or
[1:22:33] clave CL when you cleave
[1:22:37] meat you cut it it is a very sharp
[1:22:40] object that goes through the meat and
[1:22:43] opens it up just the same as when a plow
[1:22:47] goes into the Earth to open up the Earth
[1:22:50] to turn the soil over farming
[1:22:55] is different these days than when I was
[1:22:57] a child but I as a child I can remember
[1:23:00] in the springtime when the farmers would
[1:23:03] begin preparing the fields for uh
[1:23:06] planting the seed they would pull out
[1:23:09] the three bottom or five bottom plows
[1:23:12] some of them had larger than that and
[1:23:14] these plows would would cut down into
[1:23:18] the Earth and would flip the soil
[1:23:22] over and in so so doing the last one
[1:23:26] would leave a ditch in the earth and
[1:23:30] when they came back to do another set of
[1:23:35] plowing the tractor tire would go in
[1:23:38] that ditch in the earth so that they
[1:23:41] could follow a straight run but the O
[1:23:43] the the idea was that they were plowing
[1:23:46] into the Earth to cause the soil to be
[1:23:49] turned over because they were preparing
[1:23:53] the soil to receive nutrients and to
[1:23:56] receive
[1:23:59] seed and so when I'm looking at this
[1:24:03] scripture in Psalm 27 when David said he
[1:24:07] was going to inquire in his Temple my
[1:24:12] mind be to think about how that we are
[1:24:16] the Temple of the Holy Ghost and how
[1:24:19] that God has come and he is doing the
[1:24:22] inquiring on the Temple and he is
[1:24:26] causing us to do the same thing and we
[1:24:29] are allowing him to come with the meat
[1:24:31] cleaver or with the plow to plow deep
[1:24:35] into our Inner Man into our soul realm
[1:24:38] to lay things
[1:24:42] open it is his desire to lay them open
[1:24:46] before us not because he wants to
[1:24:49] inflict another injury on us but he's
[1:24:52] calling us he wants us to be so fully
[1:24:57] dedicated to him that we are carriers of
[1:25:01] the
[1:25:03] glory so then you start thinking about
[1:25:08] the Temple of Herod the Temple of
[1:25:11] Solomon on back to the Tabernacle of
[1:25:13] David the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:25:15] the one that God instructed Moses to set
[1:25:18] up and God instructed Moses in in Exodus
[1:25:24] 25 he said speak to the children of
[1:25:27] Israel that they bring me an offering of
[1:25:30] every man that giveth it
[1:25:33] willingly with his heart you shall take
[1:25:37] the
[1:25:38] offering so there is the start of
[1:25:42] it God is calling for an
[1:25:45] offering but he's asking for it
[1:25:48] willingly wants us to be
[1:25:51] willing he doesn't want to he he doesn't
[1:25:54] want to force
[1:25:59] it perhaps sometime in your journey you
[1:26:02] have felt
[1:26:06] forced you ought to thank the Lord that
[1:26:09] he would in your
[1:26:13] stubbornness in your Rebellion whatever
[1:26:17] word you want to use that he would be so
[1:26:20] gracious to you that he would
[1:26:24] though he may have had to use a little
[1:26:26] extra
[1:26:27] Force he got you where he needed to get
[1:26:29] you all right so the Lord has speaking
[1:26:32] to Moses verse three this is the
[1:26:34] offering which you shall take of them
[1:26:37] gold and silver and brass and blue and
[1:26:41] purple and Scarlet and fine linen and
[1:26:43] goat's hair and Ram's skin dyed red and
[1:26:46] Badger skin them wood oil for the
[1:26:49] light spices for anointing oil and for
[1:26:53] sweet
[1:26:54] incense onx stones and stones to be set
[1:26:58] in the ephod and the
[1:27:00] breastplate and let them make me a
[1:27:03] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[1:27:07] according to all that I show thee after
[1:27:09] the pattern of the Tabernacle and the
[1:27:12] pattern of the instruments thereof even
[1:27:15] so shall you make it so God wanted to
[1:27:18] dwell among his
[1:27:20] people when he asked Moses to build a
[1:27:23] tab
[1:27:24] Tabernacle that plan was not just one
[1:27:28] that Moses thought up all by
[1:27:32] himself that plan was one that he got in
[1:27:35] the
[1:27:36] mountain when he spent time with the
[1:27:39] Lord and he was taken up into Heavenly
[1:27:42] places and he brought the pattern from
[1:27:45] the from Heaven he brought it into the
[1:27:47] Earth and he he didn't do it all by
[1:27:52] himself he had help in getting there
[1:27:55] were there were men who were skilled
[1:27:58] Craftsmen there were women who spun the
[1:28:01] the the the cloth there were helps of
[1:28:05] all kinds to help to bring about this uh
[1:28:08] Tabernacle in the wilderness so that it
[1:28:10] was patterned after the pattern that
[1:28:13] Moses saw in the heavens because God
[1:28:16] wanted to dwell among his
[1:28:19] people and he doesn't only want to dwell
[1:28:22] among them
[1:28:24] it is God's whole desire to dwell in
[1:28:31] them there are many Christians even
[1:28:34] today who are satisfied for God to dwell
[1:28:38] with
[1:28:39] them you see the signs on the cars that
[1:28:42] say God is my
[1:28:43] co-pilot there's a whole lot of people
[1:28:46] that God is their
[1:28:48] co-pilot and really God wants to put us
[1:28:51] in the back seat and he wants to be the
[1:28:53] pilot of this ship he's the one that
[1:28:56] wants to run this this vessel but yet we
[1:29:00] have of times been in such a place where
[1:29:04] that we did not allow him to be pilot
[1:29:07] and we only wanted him to be God With Us
[1:29:10] God get me through this God get me
[1:29:12] through that and it was always God on
[1:29:15] the peripheral and it was you know as as
[1:29:18] long as things are going good you know
[1:29:21] God is with me
[1:29:31] but that's all that they have allowed
[1:29:32] for him to be it's God
[1:29:35] with what God is really Desiring is for
[1:29:39] us to be vessels that carry him wherever
[1:29:43] we go he's not following us he's in Us
[1:29:48] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:29:51] this baptism of the Holy Ghost is not
[1:29:53] just a once and done this is a holy
[1:29:56] ghost that is continually being in uh
[1:30:00] put into us being were re refilled and
[1:30:03] refilled and refilled because that was
[1:30:06] the design that he had because as I said
[1:30:10] A week or so ago we could not have
[1:30:12] handled it all at one
[1:30:15] time we would
[1:30:18] explode there sometimes the Holy Ghost
[1:30:21] comes in such measures and we don't know
[1:30:23] what to do with ourselves and that's
[1:30:26] just a foretaste of what he really wants
[1:30:28] to do and if he put in us the full
[1:30:31] measure we would
[1:30:35] explode we would not know what to
[1:30:38] do
[1:30:40] so he gave us a foreshadowing of his
[1:30:45] plan now again man being Spirit soul and
[1:30:51] body or if we reverse them by Body Soul
[1:30:54] and Spirit we're we're we're going to
[1:30:58] look at the Tabernacle today and we're
[1:31:02] going to just try to get a sense of how
[1:31:07] that God really
[1:31:09] desires to
[1:31:11] Tabernacle inside of us or
[1:31:14] to
[1:31:16] be for our vessel to be his
[1:31:20] Temple remembering Psalm 26 74 we're
[1:31:26] inquiring in his Temple we're going to
[1:31:29] plow into it we're going to let the meat
[1:31:33] cleaver come we're going to let him open
[1:31:35] it up that's what we've really been
[1:31:37] doing over the past weeks and months as
[1:31:40] the spirit of God has been talking to us
[1:31:43] about uh things on in the soul realm
[1:31:47] whether they be anger or bitterness or
[1:31:50] Envy or Strife or jealousies whatever
[1:31:53] ever these things are that we may deal
[1:31:57] with and uh there are sometimes that we
[1:32:02] feel like that we have the victory over
[1:32:04] them and there are other times that they
[1:32:06] smack us upside the head and we're
[1:32:09] dealing with them all all over again be
[1:32:12] simply because God is still doing the
[1:32:16] plowing he's still looking on the inside
[1:32:19] of us and so when when God designed a a
[1:32:23] he allowed Moses to bring the design of
[1:32:27] the tabernacle into the Earth it was the
[1:32:31] it was a pattern of things that he saw
[1:32:34] in the heavens and we see first of all
[1:32:38] in the in the courtyard there is the the
[1:32:41] altar of the burnt offering and we can
[1:32:44] find this in Leviticus chap 6 so in the
[1:32:48] burnt offering that this is where that
[1:32:51] they brought the sacrif Rices for the
[1:32:55] priests to be able to sacrifice on
[1:32:59] behalf of the people
[1:33:02] now sometimes we forget that the priests
[1:33:06] also were
[1:33:08] human the priests fought the same
[1:33:11] battles as all the rest of the
[1:33:15] population the priests were just as
[1:33:18] human as the rest of the population and
[1:33:22] and they did not spent
[1:33:25] 365 days working in the temple they went
[1:33:29] by courses and so they had the
[1:33:32] opportunity to go to their homes to be
[1:33:34] with their wives and their children they
[1:33:37] had the opportunity to to No Doubt plant
[1:33:41] uh and and sew and whatever although the
[1:33:44] people brought to them uh of of of the
[1:33:47] first fruits of their crops and flocks
[1:33:50] and so forth so that they didn't they
[1:33:52] could be in the service of of the Lord
[1:33:54] they did not have to plant a garden uh
[1:33:57] but they had the opportunity to go home
[1:34:00] and and they had to deal with unruly
[1:34:05] children they had to deal with the door
[1:34:09] falling off the
[1:34:12] hinge they had to deal with
[1:34:16] life
[1:34:18] and even though these men were a part of
[1:34:22] the tribe of Levi
[1:34:24] they had been called by God to be a part
[1:34:28] of uh uh the temple and the the workings
[1:34:32] of the the Tabernacle they were
[1:34:35] intricately involved in in the the
[1:34:38] workings of the Tabernacle they were
[1:34:41] still
[1:34:42] men some of them were
[1:34:45] softspoken some of them had high
[1:34:50] tempers some of them no doubt were were
[1:34:54] skinny some were
[1:34:56] Hefty some tall some short they were
[1:35:00] just as human as the rest of the crowd
[1:35:02] but they were
[1:35:04] called and so the scripture tells us
[1:35:08] that there were times that the
[1:35:11] priests would
[1:35:13] come and before that they could offer an
[1:35:16] offering for the people they had to
[1:35:19] offer an offering for themselves
[1:35:25] because they also had heart
[1:35:29] issues and they wanted to make sure that
[1:35:32] they were offering the right offering to
[1:35:34] the Lord before they went in to do the
[1:35:38] service of the
[1:35:39] Lord but I I for whatever reason I've
[1:35:44] this thought has never crossed my mind
[1:35:46] that I
[1:35:47] remember thinking about the work that
[1:35:50] these priests had
[1:35:54] anybody in here ever worked on a farm I
[1:35:56] know Joshua River has you've worked on a
[1:35:59] farm anybody ever had an unruly Beast
[1:36:02] that you had to deal
[1:36:10] with these
[1:36:13] priests were dealing with
[1:36:17] animals and for whatever reason I've
[1:36:20] never thought what if the animal got
[1:36:22] away
[1:36:26] what if he just started running through
[1:36:28] the courtyard now what if he went toward
[1:36:30] the
[1:36:34] Tabernacle what if he just what if he
[1:36:38] just went
[1:36:40] wild before he got to the
[1:36:43] Altar and this priest had to run after
[1:36:45] it and try to get it under control and
[1:36:48] bring it back to make sure that it was a
[1:36:51] worthy specimen to Slit it
[1:36:56] throat not shoot it with a
[1:36:58] gun to Slit its throat and catch its
[1:37:04] blood because the blood had to be poured
[1:37:07] out in a certain
[1:37:10] way some of the blood was sprinkled some
[1:37:13] of the blood was poured
[1:37:14] out and then this Beast had to be cut
[1:37:19] apart the fat went a certain way the the
[1:37:23] the the the meat of it was laid on the
[1:37:26] on the coals of fire and all of the
[1:37:29] while this priest a human
[1:37:33] being No Doubt with blood all over
[1:37:38] him trying
[1:37:40] to put a beast on this altar either for
[1:37:46] himself or for someone who brought it to
[1:37:51] be sacrificed on their behalf
[1:37:55] half
[1:37:57] so the priest had to offer this
[1:38:00] sacrifice on the altar of burnt
[1:38:03] offerings this being the
[1:38:06] first of a stage that we as a human
[1:38:09] would go
[1:38:11] through after Jesus Christ paid the
[1:38:14] price at
[1:38:19] Calvary no
[1:38:20] longer did we have to bring
[1:38:24] a
[1:38:25] beast whether it be a lamb or a Ram or a
[1:38:30] bulock or a
[1:38:33] pigeon no longer was that
[1:38:38] necessary
[1:38:40] now God wanted the
[1:38:46] human and then he didn't want you
[1:38:50] to crawl up on a literal
[1:38:55] altar that was burning with hot
[1:38:58] coals that you would physically be
[1:39:02] consumed but he wanted you to lay Across
[1:39:05] The Altar and present yourself to
[1:39:10] him and say Lord here I am I present
[1:39:15] myself to
[1:39:16] you I have nothing to
[1:39:19] bring except the perfect lamb
[1:39:24] just yourself to lay across the altar
[1:39:28] Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore
[1:39:31] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:39:36] present your bodies a Living
[1:39:39] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:39:44] is your reasonable
[1:39:47] service so you begin by offering
[1:39:51] yourself this is so Elemental for most
[1:39:54] of us but let's get something out of it
[1:39:57] today just laying ourself Across The
[1:40:00] Altar and saying Lord here I am you said
[1:40:05] that I you wanted me to present my body
[1:40:08] as a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:40:11] acceptable unto God now friends we
[1:40:14] already
[1:40:15] know we already know that we can't get
[1:40:18] holy
[1:40:21] enough we can't make up ourselves good
[1:40:24] enough but in this sense we are
[1:40:28] presenting ourselves as holy we're
[1:40:31] presenting ourselves as set
[1:40:36] apart I am no longer of this world with
[1:40:41] all of its confusion I have been called
[1:40:45] to present my body as a Living Sacrifice
[1:40:50] holy set apart
[1:40:53] different than everybody
[1:40:57] else set
[1:40:59] apart
[1:41:02] holy because he wants me set
[1:41:08] apart be ye holy for I am Holy see we
[1:41:14] get all tied up in this word holy and we
[1:41:17] we have in past attempted to get good
[1:41:21] enough for God and you never
[1:41:24] will never you will never get good
[1:41:28] enough for God in and of yourself that's
[1:41:33] why he presented to you a lamb without
[1:41:36] spot or wrinkle or
[1:41:39] blemish it was the perfect lamb because
[1:41:42] he knew you couldn't do it yourself and
[1:41:45] all he's asking is that
[1:41:48] you present
[1:41:51] yourself on the altar
[1:41:54] of burnt
[1:41:55] offering on the altar of
[1:41:58] sacrifice giving to him everything that
[1:42:00] you are and everything that you ever
[1:42:03] will be saying God I'm
[1:42:07] yours I I just belong to you now this is
[1:42:11] real easy to
[1:42:13] say in the right
[1:42:17] atmosphere when everybody around you is
[1:42:20] doing the same thing it's so easy to say
[1:42:23] Here I Am
[1:42:25] Lord when you leave this building and
[1:42:30] you meet old friends or you encounter a
[1:42:33] situation at work that is that is
[1:42:37] just
[1:42:40] horrible and
[1:42:45] the the world has this tendency to
[1:42:50] encourage us to take our rights
[1:42:55] we live in leod deia the age of people's
[1:43:01] rights everybody wants their rights even
[1:43:05] we in this church want
[1:43:08] our American
[1:43:11] rights we want what belongs to
[1:43:15] us we don't want the IRS coming and
[1:43:18] checking
[1:43:20] out what we get give and what we receive
[1:43:26] we want our rights we want to possess a
[1:43:29] gun we want to possess what belongs to
[1:43:32] us we don't want the EPA telling us that
[1:43:36] we can't build on a piece of land
[1:43:39] because it's got some special frog on it
[1:43:42] you know we want our
[1:43:46] rights these are all things that
[1:43:49] Humanity deals with including believers
[1:43:54] and all of this is
[1:43:58] is our journey in life that God has put
[1:44:03] before
[1:44:04] us every individual has their own
[1:44:08] situations that they're dealing with or
[1:44:11] on a daily basis because God knows what
[1:44:15] you are made of and he knows the right
[1:44:18] place to plow
[1:44:26] so when he starts
[1:44:29] plowing the first thing that we're we're
[1:44:33] inquiring of his Temple and this is the
[1:44:40] temple we're not we're we're we're
[1:44:43] allowing the Tabernacle in the
[1:44:46] wilderness to be a pattern for us
[1:44:49] because God was not looking to dwell in
[1:44:53] in four walls he was not looking even to
[1:44:56] dwell permanently in those
[1:44:59] curtains he wasn't looking to dwell in a
[1:45:03] box behind a
[1:45:04] curtain he's looking to
[1:45:07] dwell in a human vessel one that he
[1:45:11] could fully take control of and he
[1:45:15] demonstrated it to us by by stepping uh
[1:45:20] out of glory and taking on a phys
[1:45:22] physical human body and coming into the
[1:45:25] Earth taking on the nature and the form
[1:45:29] of a man and walking this journey for
[1:45:32] three and a half for 33 and a half years
[1:45:35] to demonstrate that it was possible
[1:45:39] though he was tempted in every way as we
[1:45:42] are yet without sin he was demonstrating
[1:45:45] that it could be done no matter how deep
[1:45:49] the plow
[1:45:51] went that could be a human that would
[1:45:55] overcome everything that the enemy threw
[1:45:57] at them so the first thing is to present
[1:46:03] yourself on the altar now between the
[1:46:05] altar the burnt offering and the door of
[1:46:09] the Tabernacle of the congregation the
[1:46:12] scripture tells us that there was a
[1:46:15] Labor uh a bowl a labor for washing it's
[1:46:21] my understanding that this labor
[1:46:23] that they took the looking glasses of
[1:46:25] the women and melted it down and and
[1:46:29] made this labor so that not only were
[1:46:31] you washing you also had Looking Glass
[1:46:34] to be able to make sure perhaps that all
[1:46:37] the blood was off of
[1:46:39] you before you went in to do the duties
[1:46:42] inside the Tabernacle of the
[1:46:44] congregation and and we are in this same
[1:46:48] position after we have laid oursel on
[1:46:50] the altar we go for baptism ISM remember
[1:46:54] we're after we've repented we're
[1:46:56] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:46:59] the remission of our sins in Ephesians
[1:47:03] chapter 5 we read in verse 25 husbands
[1:47:08] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:47:12] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:47:16] that he might
[1:47:18] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:47:22] of Water by the word now why does he do
[1:47:26] this that he might present it to himself
[1:47:31] a glorious church not having spot or
[1:47:35] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:47:38] should be holy and without
[1:47:42] blemish so in the in the older
[1:47:47] Covenant a typical person who was not a
[1:47:51] a priest was only allowed to come so
[1:47:56] far then only the priests were allowed
[1:47:59] to progress and so uh they they couldn't
[1:48:03] come any farther the the the humanity at
[1:48:07] large could not come any further than
[1:48:09] the courtyard of the Tabernacle of the
[1:48:13] congregation but we have been
[1:48:17] made see the enemy wants to keep you
[1:48:21] out he wants to keep you from your full
[1:48:25] manifestation in the end time and so he
[1:48:29] does everything that he can to
[1:48:31] disqualify you but I would like to
[1:48:34] remind him today that we have been made
[1:48:37] Kings and Priests unto our
[1:48:40] God now wait a minute kings were not
[1:48:44] allowed into the
[1:48:47] Tabernacle only the priests
[1:48:50] were we can read in Scripture about
[1:48:53] kings that were that were uh that that
[1:48:56] tried to go in they tried to usurp the
[1:48:59] authority of a priests and it didn't end
[1:49:02] well for
[1:49:03] them yet God we have been told in the
[1:49:06] scripture we have been made Kings and
[1:49:10] Priests unto our God that is why that we
[1:49:14] cannot live under a levitical priesthood
[1:49:19] but we have been called under a MDC
[1:49:21] priesthood we have been called as Kings
[1:49:24] and Priests we have the ability uh we
[1:49:28] have we have been given authority to to
[1:49:32] conduct
[1:49:33] business and we have also been granted
[1:49:37] the access into the holy of
[1:49:42] holies also in First Peter chapter 2
[1:49:46] verse one wherefore laying aside all
[1:49:48] malice and all guile and hypocrisy and
[1:49:51] envies and all evil
[1:49:53] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:49:57] sincere milk of the word that you may
[1:49:59] grow thereby if so if so be you have
[1:50:05] tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom
[1:50:09] coming as unto a Lively Stone disallowed
[1:50:13] indeed of men but chosen of God and
[1:50:17] precious you
[1:50:19] also as Lively stones are built up a
[1:50:23] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[1:50:27] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:50:31] to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it
[1:50:36] is contained in the scripture behold I
[1:50:40] lay in Zion a Chief
[1:50:42] Cornerstone elect
[1:50:45] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:50:47] shall not be
[1:50:49] confounded unto you therefore which
[1:50:52] believe he is precious but unto them
[1:50:55] which be disobedient the stone which the
[1:50:58] builders disallowed the same is made the
[1:51:01] head of the corner and a stone of
[1:51:05] stumbling and a rock of offense even to
[1:51:08] them which stumble at the word being
[1:51:12] disobedient where unto also they were
[1:51:15] appointed but you are a chosen
[1:51:19] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:51:24] nation A peculiar people that you you
[1:51:29] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:51:33] has called you out of Darkness Into His
[1:51:36] Marvelous
[1:51:38] Light so you as royal priesthood are
[1:51:43] privileged now not only to be in the
[1:51:46] outer court but you have been invited
[1:51:48] into the holy place so we proceed into
[1:51:52] the holy place and it is a privilege as
[1:51:55] a priest to enter into this place into
[1:51:59] the Tabernacle where the where there is
[1:52:03] the altar of incense the table of
[1:52:08] showbread and the Seven Branch
[1:52:11] Candlestick so the altar of incense we
[1:52:14] want to look at because this is all a
[1:52:17] part of what God is is is is using to
[1:52:21] plow into to to to look into our lives
[1:52:25] because he wants us to be totally
[1:52:28] surrendered to him totally yielded to
[1:52:30] him fully capable of carrying out the
[1:52:34] Priestly work and not having Upon Our
[1:52:39] conscience all the stuff that has kept
[1:52:43] us out in previous
[1:52:47] times so we look to Exodus chapter 30
[1:52:53] where the Lord told Moses make an altar
[1:52:55] of burnt
[1:52:57] incense of sham wood Thou shalt make it
[1:53:00] and he gives the size of it in verses 2
[1:53:02] and three tells how to Overlay it in the
[1:53:05] gold rings and how that these staves uh
[1:53:09] that are going to go through these rings
[1:53:10] are made of the same wood that the altar
[1:53:13] is made of and they're to be overlaid
[1:53:15] with gold and he said that it was to be
[1:53:18] put before the veil verse six you're
[1:53:22] going to put it before the veil that is
[1:53:24] by the Ark of the testimony before the
[1:53:27] mercy seat that is over the testimony
[1:53:31] where I will meet with you and Aaron
[1:53:33] shall burn thereon sweet incense every
[1:53:39] morning when he dresses the lamps he
[1:53:42] shall burn incense
[1:53:46] thereon and when Aaron lights the lamps
[1:53:48] at even he shall burn incense upon it a
[1:53:52] Perpetual incense before the Lord
[1:53:56] throughout your
[1:53:58] Generations you shall offer no strange
[1:54:00] incense thereon nor burnt sacrifice nor
[1:54:04] meat offering neither shall you pour out
[1:54:06] drink offerings thereon and Aaron shall
[1:54:09] make an atonement upon the horns of it
[1:54:11] once in a year with the blood of the sin
[1:54:14] offering of atonements once in a year
[1:54:17] shall he make atonement upon it
[1:54:18] throughout your Generations it is most
[1:54:21] holy unto the
[1:54:29] Lord so now we're inside of the
[1:54:33] Tabernacle we're speaking of the altar
[1:54:36] of
[1:54:38] incense we see from the scripture that
[1:54:41] at the altar of
[1:54:42] incense the priest was to bring
[1:54:45] in
[1:54:48] incense something uh something that was
[1:54:51] of a sweet SM
[1:54:53] smell if I may put it in more modern
[1:54:57] terms to those of you who use essential
[1:55:00] oils in your
[1:55:02] homes and
[1:55:05] you burn or or most of the time it's put
[1:55:09] in water and and comes out in a
[1:55:12] vapor uh it was not so there with with
[1:55:18] um with the altar of incense because
[1:55:21] there was a burner it actually burnt and
[1:55:24] it created a smell and a smoke now what
[1:55:27] was happening this this this incense
[1:55:31] that was to be used in the
[1:55:35] Tabernacle
[1:55:37] was also holy or set apart it was not an
[1:55:45] oil that you could take home with you
[1:55:48] the priests were not permitted to take
[1:55:50] it home with them and and and uh anoint
[1:55:53] all of their house and and have a burner
[1:55:56] in their house to make their house smell
[1:55:58] lovely like the Tabernacle it was a set
[1:56:01] aart oil that was only to be used in the
[1:56:05] Tabernacle see God separates his
[1:56:09] stuff he doesn't want it to be common
[1:56:12] with all the rest of your life he wants
[1:56:14] to be he wants it to be set apart holy
[1:56:19] for his use that's why we dress the way
[1:56:22] that we dress that's why that we conduct
[1:56:24] ourselves the way we conduct ourselves
[1:56:26] because we are not
[1:56:29] commoners preacher are you calling the
[1:56:32] rest of the world commoners I'm saying
[1:56:35] that they have not yet recognized if
[1:56:37] they are ever going to be that they're
[1:56:39] set apart holy unto the Lord I'm just
[1:56:42] letting the world know I've been set
[1:56:44] apart holy unto the Lord and I'm going
[1:56:47] to act different I'm going to dress
[1:56:49] different I'm going to talk different
[1:56:50] I'm going to sing different I'm going to
[1:56:52] play different music I'm not going to
[1:56:55] have all the same things as the rest of
[1:56:57] the world but when God called them to
[1:57:00] offer this incense on the altar of
[1:57:03] incense it was to create
[1:57:10] atmosphere it was to create an
[1:57:13] atmosphere inside of the Tabernacle or
[1:57:16] inside of the Holy place because God was
[1:57:22] there there he was present and he had it
[1:57:25] positioned in front of the veil that led
[1:57:28] into the holy of holies and he wanted
[1:57:31] that uh he wanted that the smoke of that
[1:57:35] and the smell of that the Bible tells us
[1:57:37] that it was a sweet smelling saver that
[1:57:40] was offered up on this uh altar of
[1:57:43] incense now I want to also point out
[1:57:49] that he was to put the altar of
[1:57:54] incense when he came into the Tabernacle
[1:57:58] in the
[1:58:00] morning to trim the Wicks of the
[1:58:04] manora and to add oil back
[1:58:08] to the
[1:58:10] bowls that the Wicks were down
[1:58:14] in and then the Bible says that he came
[1:58:17] again with that incense in the
[1:58:20] evening when he came to light the holy
[1:58:26] manora in the evening time now that was
[1:58:31] once in the morning once in the evening
[1:58:34] that was daily the Bible also says that
[1:58:38] when Aaron was to go in I I'm I'm going
[1:58:43] to make an assumption here I've not
[1:58:45] fully read and understood but it says
[1:58:47] that he was to take the blood that he
[1:58:49] was going to take into the holy of Hol
[1:58:52] that he was going to anoint the horns of
[1:58:54] the altar of the altar of
[1:58:57] incense once a
[1:58:59] year just as he was going to take the
[1:59:01] blood into the holiest
[1:59:03] place
[1:59:05] so we recognize that this is a
[1:59:11] smell to create an
[1:59:13] atmosphere we read David said in Psalm
[1:59:18] 141:2 let my prayer be set forth before
[1:59:22] thee as
[1:59:23] incense and the lifting up of my hands
[1:59:26] as the evening
[1:59:31] sacrifice we read in Revelation
[1:59:34] 5:8 when he had taken the book The Four
[1:59:36] beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down
[1:59:39] before the lamb Hing every one of them
[1:59:41] Harps and golden vials full of odors
[1:59:45] which are the prayers of the
[1:59:48] Saints also in chapter 8 of The Book of
[1:59:51] Revelation another angel came and stood
[1:59:52] at the altar having a golden sensor and
[1:59:55] there was given unto him much incense
[1:59:57] that he should offer it with the prayers
[1:59:59] of All Saints upon the golden altar
[2:00:02] which was before the throne and the
[2:00:05] smoke of the incense which came with the
[2:00:07] prayers of the Saints ascended up before
[2:00:10] God out of the Angel's
[2:00:14] hand
[2:00:17] now this sweet smelling incense
[2:00:22] we read there in Psalm 141 that David is
[2:00:26] saying let my prayer be let it be set
[2:00:31] forth before thee as
[2:00:36] incense so when
[2:00:39] we crawl out of bed in the
[2:00:44] morning our
[2:00:47] incense will not so not smell so sweet
[2:00:52] if it is our wish list for the
[2:00:59] day when we wake up in the morning we
[2:01:03] want our prayer to be a praise that is
[2:01:07] lifted up to the Lord I Thank You Lord
[2:01:10] that you have kept me uh through the
[2:01:13] night and you have awakened me to see
[2:01:16] the dawn of another day and my lips will
[2:01:19] praise you and sing forth your praise
[2:01:22] today and begin our day then in such a
[2:01:26] manner that it's an incense that rises
[2:01:29] up to him as a sweet smelling saver
[2:01:32] we're in the
[2:01:34] Tabernacle we as a priest are offering
[2:01:38] our incense unto the Lord and if all we
[2:01:41] ever do is complain before the Lord or
[2:01:46] offer of up to him all of our wish
[2:01:50] list or all of our prayer lists there's
[2:01:53] a time for
[2:01:55] that but we want when we come in the
[2:01:58] morning we want it to be a sweet
[2:02:01] smelling Savor unto him a praise lifted
[2:02:04] up to him a joyful attitude lifted up
[2:02:07] unto him because he has given us the
[2:02:10] grace for another day to start out he
[2:02:12] has brought us through the night he let
[2:02:14] us see another day and there are all
[2:02:17] kinds of things that God has done for
[2:02:20] you whether it be that moment or
[2:02:22] something he did yesterday you can thank
[2:02:25] him for and create a sweet smelling
[2:02:30] saver you can create the incense in your
[2:02:34] home or wherever you're at you can
[2:02:36] create the sweet sell smelling saber to
[2:02:40] create the atmosphere to start your
[2:02:45] day and then in the
[2:02:49] evening David said the lifting of my
[2:02:53] hands as the evening
[2:02:55] sacrifice you remember that when the
[2:02:59] priest in the book of Exodus it states
[2:03:02] Aaron went in but you as a priest have
[2:03:06] been honored to be able to go into the
[2:03:11] Tabernacle to offer unto the Lord sweet
[2:03:14] smelling Savor this incense on the altar
[2:03:17] of incense because you have been
[2:03:20] privileged to do that and he not only is
[2:03:23] is uh he not only required it in the
[2:03:25] older Covenant in the morning but he
[2:03:28] also required it in the evening time and
[2:03:31] you and I can be have this same blessing
[2:03:35] of offering to God the sweet smelling
[2:03:38] Sav in the morning time and in the
[2:03:40] evening time and all day long because we
[2:03:43] have been granted a privilege to come
[2:03:46] into this Tabernacle this holy place and
[2:03:50] offer to him
[2:03:52] this sweet smelling Savor all of the
[2:04:02] time he don't want our
[2:04:05] leftovers he wants our
[2:04:09] best so then after we recognize the the
[2:04:15] auar of incense then we see that the
[2:04:20] seven Branch candlestick or the manora
[2:04:22] is there we can read about it in
[2:04:25] Leviticus
[2:04:26] 24 command the children of Israel that
[2:04:29] they bring unto thee pure oil olive
[2:04:33] beaten for the light to cause the lamps
[2:04:36] to burn
[2:04:37] continually without the veil of the
[2:04:39] testimony in the Tabernacle of the
[2:04:41] congregation shall Aaron order it from
[2:04:44] the evening to the morning before the
[2:04:47] Lord continually it shall be a statute
[2:04:49] forever he shall order the lamps upon
[2:04:52] the pure Candlestick before the Lord
[2:04:55] continually now once again the this this
[2:04:58] lampstand the Candlestick the candleabra
[2:05:02] the manora whatever word you want to use
[2:05:04] whatever makes you comfortable this
[2:05:06] Candlestick that was in the uh in the uh
[2:05:10] Tabernacle it represents the light of
[2:05:13] God we can read about to uh in the Book
[2:05:17] of Revelation chapter 1 when John
[2:05:22] turned and he saw the seven Branch
[2:05:24] Candlestick and he saw the the Lord
[2:05:27] Jesus standing right in the middle of
[2:05:29] that Candlestick and he describes what
[2:05:33] he
[2:05:35] saw and we know that this is a
[2:05:38] representation of of the Lord Jesus
[2:05:41] Christ who is the light of the world um
[2:05:45] now the the priest was to again go in
[2:05:48] the morning trim the Wicks replace the
[2:05:51] oil and in the evening time go back and
[2:05:55] light the the Wicks once again it uh it
[2:06:00] it's been
[2:06:02] written
[2:06:03] by people smarter than me sages along
[2:06:07] the way it has been written that the
[2:06:10] shamash or the servant candle the the
[2:06:13] one that was above the rest of them that
[2:06:16] it burned
[2:06:18] continually I don't know I wasn't there
[2:06:21] it's sounds like something that God
[2:06:23] would do that's who he is uh as as as
[2:06:27] from a human standpoint I don't know how
[2:06:29] they could trim the wick with the fire
[2:06:31] still burning I suppose that is possible
[2:06:34] I don't know but that was the job of the
[2:06:37] priest was to trim the
[2:06:40] Wicks every morning trim the Wicks why
[2:06:44] were the Wicks
[2:06:47] trimmed when when if if if you've ever
[2:06:51] messed with a Lantern you find out that
[2:06:53] when a wick gets to a certain condition
[2:06:55] it starts being
[2:06:57] Smoky and this is again about atmosphere
[2:07:01] it's about conditions of of the inside
[2:07:04] God didn't want his his his atmosphere
[2:07:07] to be Smoky from a wick that was that
[2:07:10] was not trimmed you see uh he is the
[2:07:14] source of all of our
[2:07:16] light and it would be just like almighty
[2:07:20] God to let the shamash burn all of the
[2:07:23] time because he doesn't need
[2:07:27] pruned God doesn't need
[2:07:30] pruned I
[2:07:32] do but he
[2:07:35] doesn't and he told us in the New
[2:07:38] Testament he he he said on one hand he
[2:07:41] was the light of the world but he also
[2:07:43] said that we were the light of the world
[2:07:45] and he doesn't want our Wicks to be uh
[2:07:48] causing there to be a smoky flame he
[2:07:51] wants it to be a clear bright flame uh
[2:07:54] shining out so that people can see that
[2:07:56] Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday
[2:08:00] and today and forever he wants us to
[2:08:06] see he wants us to
[2:08:10] see when the light is burning he wants
[2:08:13] us to be able to
[2:08:20] see there's much darkness in the world
[2:08:23] but he wants us to
[2:08:25] see there is much to provoke you to
[2:08:28] anger but he wants you to see as he
[2:08:31] plows deep into the temple he's
[2:08:33] inquiring into the temple your temple if
[2:08:37] anger is something that triggers you he
[2:08:39] wants you to have light to be able to
[2:08:44] see when he opens it
[2:08:48] up he doesn't continue to make you walk
[2:08:51] in dark Darkness he shines the light of
[2:08:54] the word onto that place so that you can
[2:08:57] see maybe what the triggers are what
[2:09:00] what the what is the root cause of it
[2:09:03] why that it is
[2:09:05] there and how that you by the blood of
[2:09:08] Jesus Christ can get rid of it you can
[2:09:11] let it be washed away by the blood of
[2:09:13] Jesus Christ it doesn't have to remain
[2:09:15] there
[2:09:17] friends once again this is things the
[2:09:20] these are things that we have been
[2:09:21] hearing over the past weeks and months
[2:09:24] and I'm just uh I'm just coming to you
[2:09:26] again today to let you know God ain't
[2:09:30] done he doesn't want you to forget just
[2:09:32] because brother Shelly's not he doesn't
[2:09:34] want you to forget that you got to deal
[2:09:36] with those offense of those offenses in
[2:09:39] your life you got to deal with those
[2:09:42] roots of bitterness in your life he's
[2:09:45] cutting deep and he wants the light of
[2:09:47] the
[2:09:48] word to shine on it
[2:09:53] he wants you to be able to take the word
[2:09:55] of
[2:09:58] God Thy
[2:10:00] word is a lamp to my
[2:10:04] feet and a light to my pathway he wants
[2:10:08] you to be able to take the word and let
[2:10:11] it
[2:10:13] illuminate
[2:10:15] whatever your Vice might be whatever
[2:10:18] those inner workings are that cause you
[2:10:21] such a struggle from day to day and let
[2:10:24] the word of God deal with
[2:10:31] them yeah let the word of God deal with
[2:10:35] them let the word work mightily in you
[2:10:41] you've got to cooperate the word's been
[2:10:43] there all
[2:10:47] along the word has been there for years
[2:10:52] it's been right in these pages that
[2:10:54] we've carried around under our arms
[2:10:56] since we was a
[2:10:58] child some of
[2:11:00] us it's right
[2:11:03] there but so often we didn't know what
[2:11:06] to do with
[2:11:09] it do you know that our
[2:11:14] adversary has made us scared to use this
[2:11:24] he made us scared to use
[2:11:27] it
[2:11:29] because that we were angry or because we
[2:11:33] were bitter or because we were jealous
[2:11:38] or because we were offended he made us
[2:11:40] afraid to use the word but friends the
[2:11:43] word is the only thing that's going to
[2:11:45] bring us out where the spirit and Truth
[2:11:47] are mixed together working in our lives
[2:11:50] that is what is going to bring us the
[2:11:52] victory that's what is that's what's
[2:11:54] going to bring us the overcoming portion
[2:11:57] in the end time and the Lord was is
[2:11:59] letting the manora be bright he's he's
[2:12:02] as Priests of our own Temple we want to
[2:12:05] make sure that the Wicks are trimmed
[2:12:08] properly and on time we want to make
[2:12:10] sure that the balls are full of oil we
[2:12:12] don't want to run out of oil and we want
[2:12:14] to make sure that they're lit at the
[2:12:16] proper time and we want the flame to be
[2:12:19] bright because he wants us to
[2:12:23] see then he brings us to the table of
[2:12:27] showbread or the bread of the
[2:12:30] presence Leviticus 24: 5-9 it talks
[2:12:35] about how they take fine flour and bake
[2:12:38] 12 cakes uh thereof two10 deals shall be
[2:12:42] one cake and you shall set them in two
[2:12:44] rows six on one row upon the pure table
[2:12:47] before the Lord and you're going to put
[2:12:49] Franken pure Franken in sense upon each
[2:12:52] row that it may be on the bread for
[2:12:55] Memorial even an offering made by fire
[2:12:58] unto the Lord now the altar of incense
[2:13:02] was once in the morning once in the
[2:13:04] evening the manora was trimmed in the
[2:13:09] morning lit in the evening
[2:13:13] the table of
[2:13:15] showbread was changed out every Sabbath
[2:13:21] every seventh day the bread was made
[2:13:25] fresh and brought in and replaced the
[2:13:28] previous week's bread and then the
[2:13:31] priests were given the opportunity to
[2:13:33] eat that bread that was taken up so
[2:13:36] there's nothing wrong with day old
[2:13:42] bread every seventh
[2:13:46] day this
[2:13:48] bread was made aresh and put on the
[2:13:52] table of
[2:13:53] showbread this was the duty of the
[2:13:56] priest and you and I have been uh we
[2:14:00] have been honored by the Lord that he
[2:14:03] would tell us that we uh were privileged
[2:14:08] to eat of the bread of life in and you
[2:14:12] remember when he was in the wilderness
[2:14:15] Jesus was in the wilderness and he was
[2:14:16] fighting the enemy and the enemy came to
[2:14:19] him and said you know if you're really
[2:14:21] who you say you
[2:14:22] are why don't you you know you're
[2:14:25] hungry why don't you take these stones
[2:14:29] and make them into
[2:14:32] bread well Jesus turned around to him
[2:14:35] and said it is
[2:14:38] written man shall not live by bread
[2:14:42] alone but by every word that proceeds
[2:14:45] out of the mouth of
[2:14:47] God when Jesus said it is
[2:14:52] written it
[2:14:54] was Deuteronomy
[2:14:58] 8:3 he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[2:15:02] hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou
[2:15:05] knewest not neither did thy fathers know
[2:15:09] that he might make thee know that man
[2:15:13] does not live by bread only but by every
[2:15:18] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[2:15:21] the Lord doth Man live he was wanting to
[2:15:26] demonstrate to us that there's more to
[2:15:29] life than feeding our
[2:15:34] face more than three meals a
[2:15:38] day Divine Fellowship is what he is
[2:15:41] Desiring Divine making the Lord Jesus he
[2:15:46] is the bread of life and he wants to be
[2:15:49] he wants us to consume the bread of life
[2:15:53] or the word of God he wants us to
[2:15:55] consume it and you know all our
[2:15:59] troubles they're they they're what gets
[2:16:01] our
[2:16:03] attention troubles get our
[2:16:08] attention the enemy came along and he
[2:16:11] recognized that the immediate trouble of
[2:16:14] the Lord Jesus was that he was
[2:16:17] hungry and so he worked on that
[2:16:20] immediate imediate struggle at that
[2:16:23] moment the hunger the physical hunger of
[2:16:26] the Lord Jesus and he said if you are
[2:16:28] really who you say you
[2:16:32] are why don't you say to these
[2:16:36] rocks be
[2:16:38] bread but Jesus knew that there was
[2:16:42] something more important than feeding
[2:16:45] the Natural Body and that was to feed
[2:16:48] the inner man to feed the spirit and
[2:16:51] this is all represented in these loaves
[2:16:54] that are at the table of showbread the
[2:16:56] they also called bread of the presence
[2:17:00] we need to do more than feed our face
[2:17:03] all the time friends we need to be
[2:17:05] feeded feeding on the living bread on
[2:17:09] the Living Word on the bread of his
[2:17:12] presence we need to be feeding on his
[2:17:19] presence fellowship with the Lord Jesus
[2:17:21] is more
[2:17:23] important than natural bread Psalm 34:8
[2:17:28] oh taste and
[2:17:30] see the Lord is good blessed is the man
[2:17:35] that trusts in him John 6:51 I am the
[2:17:39] living bread which came down from heaven
[2:17:41] If any man eat this bread he shall live
[2:17:45] forever and the bread that I give is my
[2:17:48] flesh which I will give for the life of
[2:17:51] the
[2:17:54] world if I could
[2:17:58] encourage any of
[2:18:00] us young and
[2:18:02] old if I could do anything for
[2:18:08] you I would encourage you get in the
[2:18:14] word get in the word
[2:18:23] many
[2:18:26] times
[2:18:29] we go throughout the day and many folks
[2:18:33] listen to
[2:18:37] music brings soothing to people some
[2:18:41] people's makeup is just that they listen
[2:18:44] to
[2:18:45] music may God grant you the grace to
[2:18:47] listen to the right kind of music
[2:18:53] but if I were to
[2:18:56] ask
[2:18:59] someone quote me a
[2:19:02] scripture could you do
[2:19:05] it young
[2:19:08] people if I asked you to quote me a
[2:19:11] scripture could you do
[2:19:15] it a lot of you no doubt could quote me
[2:19:18] the lyrics to a song
[2:19:25] but you couldn't quote a
[2:19:28] scripture and then I asked are the
[2:19:32] lyrics of the song that you're listening
[2:19:34] to sound
[2:19:37] Doctrine because there are many songs
[2:19:40] out there that are not sound
[2:19:44] Doctrine they're beautiful
[2:19:47] lyrics and they are full of words that
[2:19:52] rhyme real well together but they're not
[2:19:55] sound
[2:19:57] Doctrine and that is why I encourage you
[2:20:00] today get in the word take the Bible get
[2:20:04] you a Bible brother Shelly is has has
[2:20:07] said this before get you a Bible don't
[2:20:09] just rely on this get you a paper Bible
[2:20:14] I know that some of you struggle to read
[2:20:16] from a paper Bible or a paper book I
[2:20:19] have struggle reading from this but get
[2:20:22] a Bible something that the words are
[2:20:25] written on paper and start reading and
[2:20:28] start memorizing and underlining and
[2:20:32] repeating back to
[2:20:37] yourself and if you have a hard time
[2:20:39] with that all over YouTube there are
[2:20:44] Alexander scorby or others that are
[2:20:47] reading the scripture but don't just
[2:20:49] listen to it get get the
[2:20:51] Bible and while you're listening read
[2:20:55] along and let the word become a part of
[2:20:59] who you are Let It Be Your Daily Bread
[2:21:02] because if Man live and cannot live by
[2:21:07] bread
[2:21:11] alone three meals a day are not going to
[2:21:14] sustain
[2:21:15] you they may sustain your natural body
[2:21:18] but they're not going to sustain your
[2:21:20] Inner Man and we're allowing the Holy
[2:21:23] Ghost to do the plowing we're allowing
[2:21:25] him to open up we're becoming vulnerable
[2:21:28] in his presence because he has invited
[2:21:31] us as priests into his presence now
[2:21:34] friends he doesn't want us to just stop
[2:21:37] with the outer
[2:21:39] Court he doesn't want us to just stop
[2:21:41] with the inner Court we have been made
[2:21:44] priests unto our God Kings and Priests
[2:21:47] and he's inviting us to come farther
[2:21:50] than that
[2:21:53] you
[2:21:54] see in the Old Testament in the Book of
[2:21:59] Ezekiel the priests got tired of their
[2:22:07] work and that's the temptation of us as
[2:22:12] priests we get weary with
[2:22:15] work we get weary with what God is doing
[2:22:19] on the inside of us us we get weary of
[2:22:22] keeping the manora trimmed and the oil
[2:22:26] filled we get weary of replacing the
[2:22:30] bread we get weary of looking into the
[2:22:33] word we get weary of bringing fresh
[2:22:35] incense in the morning and fresh incense
[2:22:38] in the evening we get tired of
[2:22:43] it and that's what was happening in the
[2:22:46] old Covenant in the Old Testament in the
[2:22:48] Book of Ezekiel
[2:22:50] the
[2:22:52] priests had grown weary with their
[2:22:55] calling oh friends we cannot afford to
[2:22:59] get weary in our calling be not weary in
[2:23:01] well-doing for in due season you shall
[2:23:04] reap if you faint not and we're being
[2:23:08] called further than just the holy
[2:23:14] place but these
[2:23:18] priests the angel of the Lord came came
[2:23:20] to
[2:23:21] Ezekiel and he said I want to show you
[2:23:25] something and Ezekiel said I saw a hand
[2:23:29] the likeness of a hand come out of the
[2:23:31] midst of the pillar of cloud and grab me
[2:23:33] by the hair of my head and lift me up
[2:23:36] and he says I got something I want to
[2:23:37] show to you Ezekiel and he carried him
[2:23:40] by the spirit and he took him to
[2:23:42] different places in the in the
[2:23:44] Tabernacle or the temple whatever it was
[2:23:46] at that time he took them to different
[2:23:48] places because he wanted Ezekiel to to
[2:23:50] see what the priests were
[2:23:53] doing instead of attending to their
[2:23:56] duties as a
[2:23:59] priest they were bowing before
[2:24:02] Idols women were weeping for
[2:24:06] tamuz they were sitting with their faces
[2:24:10] toward the East worshiping the
[2:24:14] sun oh friends we can't allow any of
[2:24:17] these things to grab a hold of us and
[2:24:19] become
[2:24:20] one of one like those priests where that
[2:24:23] we're tired of what the Lord has called
[2:24:25] us to do we've got to get back to the
[2:24:27] business of a
[2:24:29] priest the priest of our own Tabernacle
[2:24:33] the priest of our own
[2:24:35] Temple we can't allow the
[2:24:38] enemy to take us down a road where we
[2:24:41] get tired of what we've been called to
[2:24:43] do so God keeps presenting to us putting
[2:24:48] the search light on it making sure that
[2:24:51] the word is being put in its proper
[2:24:53] place because he doesn't want us to take
[2:24:56] on the doctrine of devils he doesn't
[2:24:58] want us to give heed to seducing Spirits
[2:25:00] as first Timothy says because the spirit
[2:25:04] already was speaking in the time of
[2:25:06] Timothy that in the latter times there
[2:25:08] would be some that would depart from the
[2:25:11] faith there would be some who would give
[2:25:13] heed to seducing Devils there would be
[2:25:16] some that would give heed to doctrines
[2:25:19] of devils but we have been called as a
[2:25:22] royal priesthood that we cannot afford
[2:25:25] to allow any of this to be transpiring
[2:25:27] in our
[2:25:30] lives as the musicians are coming today
[2:25:33] I would like to read Hebrews chapter
[2:25:35] 10 verse
[2:25:37] 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to
[2:25:43] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[2:25:47] Jesus by a new and a living way which he
[2:25:51] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[2:25:55] that is to say his flesh the veil of his
[2:25:59] flesh and having an high priest over the
[2:26:02] house of God let us draw near with a
[2:26:07] True Heart in full Assurance of Faith
[2:26:11] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[2:26:13] conscience and our bodies washed with
[2:26:16] pure water let us hold fast the
[2:26:19] prophetic of our faith without wavering
[2:26:23] for he is faithful that
[2:26:26] promised and let us consider one another
[2:26:29] to provoke unto love and to Good Works
[2:26:32] not
[2:26:33] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[2:26:37] together as the manner of some
[2:26:41] is this
[2:26:43] Gathering is for a
[2:26:46] purpose someone to do away with the
[2:26:49] Gathering Together together but we
[2:26:51] instructed not to forsake gathering
[2:26:54] together but we're going to exhort one
[2:26:56] another and so much more as we see the
[2:26:58] day
[2:26:59] approaching we know that this has been
[2:27:02] given to us uh this this this priesthood
[2:27:06] has been given to us uh to attend to
[2:27:10] this
[2:27:13] Tabernacle there is currently no Temple
[2:27:17] there is currently no Tabernacle
[2:27:25] yet the Lord Jesus said he desired to
[2:27:28] Tabernacle in
[2:27:30] men and he doesn't just want us in the
[2:27:33] outer
[2:27:34] Court offering sacrifice day after day
[2:27:37] after day after day after day after day
[2:27:41] constantly feeling
[2:27:45] bloody because we're so beat down
[2:27:51] Jesus Christ offered the Supreme
[2:27:53] sacrifice once and for
[2:27:56] all and when he did it he made it that
[2:27:59] he made accessible for us that we could
[2:28:02] lay down our lives as a Living Sacrifice
[2:28:05] yes we do daily offer to him ourselves
[2:28:09] but we keep Covenant with him and and
[2:28:12] we're not we're not blatant Sinners
[2:28:15] every day of our
[2:28:18] life we do mess up but we're not blatant
[2:28:22] Sinners every day I hope you're
[2:28:25] not I hope you don't start out your day
[2:28:27] to commit
[2:28:30] sin that's who we
[2:28:32] were that's what we were but that's not
[2:28:35] who we are now we are called by almighty
[2:28:40] God to live in this present day in this
[2:28:43] present age as Overcomers and he's
[2:28:46] invited us into the holy of holies
[2:28:50] we're not shut out as they were in the
[2:28:52] older Covenant but because of the New
[2:28:55] and Living Way the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:28:58] have been called into the holy of
[2:29:06] holies he desires that we deal with all
[2:29:09] the stuff in the middle
[2:29:12] court the soul
[2:29:15] realm making sure that everything is
[2:29:18] pruned the way it's supposed to be
[2:29:20] everything is the Wicks are cut the way
[2:29:22] they're supposed to be the word is in
[2:29:24] its proper place the incense is in its
[2:29:27] proper place but he's calling us into
[2:29:29] the holy of
[2:29:34] holies
[2:29:36] and the
[2:29:40] scripture talks
[2:29:43] about when all of the work of the
[2:29:46] Tabernacle was finished
[2:29:53] that Moses looked on it and it was all
[2:29:58] finished and it the scripture states
[2:30:04] that when man had done all that he could
[2:30:08] do
[2:30:10] Moses Aaron the
[2:30:13] priests bezo all of his helpers when man
[2:30:18] had done all that he could
[2:30:22] do
[2:30:23] then God came down in the pillar of a
[2:30:30] cloud and the glory settled down around
[2:30:33] the
[2:30:36] Tabernacle and I liken this to me to
[2:30:42] you where that we are cooperating with
[2:30:46] the Holy Spirit there has been a pattern
[2:30:49] that has been sent into the Earth for us
[2:30:51] for this
[2:30:53] Tabernacle and when me when man when man
[2:30:56] has done all that he can
[2:31:01] do there's only so much I can do only so
[2:31:05] much you can
[2:31:11] do I don't have the
[2:31:15] ability to physically get inside of my
[2:31:19] life with a pair of
[2:31:22] tweezers and find the little
[2:31:26] speck
[2:31:28] of bitterness that's still there and
[2:31:31] pluck it
[2:31:33] out if you had that ability if I had
[2:31:38] that ability for my own
[2:31:43] self I would be foolish not to do it
[2:31:50] but I as a priest have been given a way
[2:31:54] into the holy of holies and I've got to
[2:31:57] follow the pattern and that pattern
[2:31:59] involves bringing the the incense in the
[2:32:03] morning and bringing the incense in the
[2:32:06] evening part of that is trimming the
[2:32:10] Wicks to make sure that the light shines
[2:32:13] brightly so that it can expose things
[2:32:17] that are in my life that need to be
[2:32:20] dealt with and again I can't take a pair
[2:32:23] of tweezers and pluck it out but I can
[2:32:25] agree with the Holy Spirit to say Lord
[2:32:28] your light and your word have shined on
[2:32:31] it and exposed it and I see
[2:32:34] it and I want you to know that I stand
[2:32:38] Here willing today to let you pluck it
[2:32:48] out now most most of us have lived long
[2:32:51] enough to
[2:32:53] know that it's some of those things
[2:32:57] don't disappear as once and done that
[2:33:01] would be
[2:33:02] lovely that would be fantastic that we
[2:33:05] would never have to deal with it again
[2:33:07] but there are some things in us that we
[2:33:09] have to let the Holy Spirit deal with
[2:33:12] over and over and over and over and over
[2:33:16] again but there is coming a time where
[2:33:19] that we will cooperate to the fullest
[2:33:23] extent and the Holy Spirit will remove
[2:33:25] it from our life friends I am I'm
[2:33:28] expecting that we are going to see the
[2:33:31] Promise fulfilled that the bride is
[2:33:33] going to walk in her maturity in the end
[2:33:36] time she's going to walk in maturity and
[2:33:40] there's only so much that I can do and
[2:33:43] we've had prophetic word through the
[2:33:45] ears here that when you've done all that
[2:33:47] you can when you've climbed as as high
[2:33:50] as you can
[2:33:52] climb and we at times thought we had
[2:33:55] gone as far as we could go but then the
[2:33:58] Holy Spirit came with the search light
[2:34:00] once again he came with another word
[2:34:03] once again and said no you really
[2:34:05] haven't that's right you're trying to
[2:34:08] wimp out on me you're trying to make
[2:34:10] this a little easier for yourself but
[2:34:13] friends there's going to come a time
[2:34:15] when I have yielded as far as I can
[2:34:17] yield and I've climbed as far as I can
[2:34:19] climb climb and that flying eagle
[2:34:21] anointing is going to grab a hold of me
[2:34:23] and it's going to Bear me to the top I'm
[2:34:26] depending on the Flying Eagle anointing
[2:34:29] it is not a perched eagle it is not a
[2:34:32] eagle down in the valley molting it is a
[2:34:35] flying eagle anointing that is for the
[2:34:37] Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time
[2:34:40] that's going to Bear her up to the top
[2:34:42] and I am cooperating with the holy
[2:34:44] spirit all the way through because I am
[2:34:47] going to be in the holy of
[2:34:51] holies I'm going to uh let the Holy
[2:34:54] Spirit have his full sway in me and I
[2:34:58] when I've gone as far when man has done
[2:35:00] all that he could do Moses did all that
[2:35:03] he could do he presented it to the Lord
[2:35:06] and the Lord came down with a pillar of
[2:35:08] cloud and the glory came down till the
[2:35:11] ministers could not Minister because of
[2:35:13] the glory that was in Solomon's Temple
[2:35:15] remember and but the glory of the Lord
[2:35:18] came down
[2:35:20] when man has done all that he can do
[2:35:23] we're still cooperating we're still
[2:35:25] working on this this Soul realm but take
[2:35:28] courage friends and be not weary in well
[2:35:31] doing for you shall reap you shall reap
[2:35:36] in due season if you faint not don't be
[2:35:39] like the priest in Ezekiel don't get
[2:35:42] tired of what God has called you to do
[2:35:44] you keep working you keep agreeing with
[2:35:46] the spirit keep allowing him to do what
[2:35:49] he's doing doing let the light of God
[2:35:51] continue to get on the inside and do
[2:35:54] what he wants to do let the word work
[2:35:57] let the word work let the word work and
[2:36:00] the only way the word can work is if you
[2:36:02] are in the
[2:36:04] word all right get in the
[2:36:07] word because the word still
[2:36:10] works and it's working mightily in me
[2:36:13] would you stand with us today
[2:36:21] father I ask you
[2:36:23] now that you
[2:36:25] take these words that you laid on my
[2:36:29] heart I ask you to take them and let
[2:36:32] them be what you have desired them to be
[2:36:35] in the individuals Lord It's striking
[2:36:38] people differently throughout this
[2:36:40] congregation I can see that it is
[2:36:42] striking differently but Lord I believe
[2:36:45] that your word works exactly the way it
[2:36:48] needs to when we allow it to work in us
[2:36:52] and so I am just simply asking let this
[2:36:55] word do its perfect
[2:36:58] work what has been spoken today let it
[2:37:01] work in the Believers hearts and
[2:37:04] Minds oh

[2:37:12] priesthood holy set apart
