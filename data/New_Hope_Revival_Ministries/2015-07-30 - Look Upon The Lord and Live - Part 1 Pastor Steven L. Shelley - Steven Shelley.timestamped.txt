[0:53] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and
[0:56] you're watching the Eagles cry I want to
[0:58] welcome you to the broad broadcast today
[1:01] and tell you that I consider it a great
[1:03] joy to be able to come and share with
[1:05] you the revealed word of God for this
[1:09] what I believe is the last days I
[1:12] believe that we are living in the last
[1:15] days the closing hours of time and uh if
[1:18] there's ever been a time for the Bride
[1:21] of Jesus Christ to awake out of her
[1:24] Slumber and her sleep and come alive as
[1:27] the prophet tells us in the old test
[1:30] it's time to arise and shine for our
[1:33] light has come and our light is the
[1:35] light of the Glorious Gospel of our
[1:38] Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and we
[1:41] just counted an honor to have a little
[1:43] opportunity in bringing these Bible
[1:46] programs to you I pray that you'll be
[1:48] edified and strengthened in your walk
[1:50] with the Lord and I also pray that if
[1:53] you find yourself in a cold or stagnant
[1:57] condition if you are not on fire fire
[2:00] for God we say or the scripture
[2:02] describes this state as being lukewarm
[2:05] and I pray that God will turn up the
[2:07] Holy Ghost fire in your life that you
[2:10] will be recharged that you will renew
[2:13] and recommit your life to him so that
[2:15] you can be an an instrument a vessel of
[2:18] his glory in the last days we appreciate
[2:21] your emails and your comments that
[2:24] you've made about the previous programs
[2:27] and we invite you to contact us our
[2:29] contact information is available on the
[2:32] screen and we would love to hear from
[2:34] you be sure to send in your prayer
[2:36] request because we have a great team of
[2:39] Prayer Warriors and intercessors who
[2:42] count it a privilege to be able to take
[2:44] your needs Before the Throne of God the
[2:47] Bible says the effectual fervent prayer
[2:50] of a righteous man availeth much and I
[2:53] believe personally in the power of
[2:55] prayer I've seen what God accomplishes
[2:59] when we uh send up our prayer Our
[3:02] petition before him in faith and he
[3:04] asked us to come to him casting all of
[3:08] our cares on him because he cares so
[3:11] much for us what a joy it is to know
[3:15] that we are loved we are truly loved by
[3:19] our father and we have a beautiful and
[3:22] wonderful and capable elder brother even
[3:25] Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ I want to
[3:28] begin a study with you today uh the
[3:31] basis of this study is found in the book
[3:34] of Exodus but it will take us from page
[3:38] to page chapter to chapter book to book
[3:41] older Covenant newer Covenant back and
[3:43] forth and here and ywn and uh but I pray
[3:47] that when we are finished that your
[3:50] heart will be touched and that most of
[3:53] all that you will have a desire to raise
[3:56] above the status quo of dull drum
[3:59] Christianity just average Christianity
[4:03] which is basically knowing to do good
[4:06] knowing what is right but just sort of
[4:08] coasting in I want to tell you my my old
[4:12] Pentecostal granny used to say that that
[4:14] a jelly fish perhaps you know what a
[4:17] jellyfish is it it's h it's a sea
[4:20] creature and it has no backbone and
[4:22] therefore it just floats wherever the
[4:25] tide takes it my granny used to say any
[4:28] jellyfish can go with the flow but it
[4:31] takes a fish with a backbone to swim
[4:34] against the current like a salmon and
[4:37] I'm just asking God to make you a salmon
[4:39] in the Kingdom that you will will be
[4:42] willing to use your Holy Ghost backbone
[4:45] and swim against the flow of of modern
[4:50] society uh swim against the flow of of
[4:53] lukewarm Christianity and rise to a new
[4:57] level of being yield yed if I could
[5:01] encourage you although I don't know how
[5:03] to teach you how to do this but if I
[5:05] could encourage you to be yielded I
[5:08] would encourage you above all other
[5:10] advice to yield yourself to the master
[5:15] become like putty like clay in his hands
[5:19] because he is the great Potter and he is
[5:22] molding and shaping us even the trials
[5:25] of our life even what we have
[5:27] experienced in the past past a very good
[5:31] friend of mine often says that uh he had
[5:34] a word from the Lord concerning his own
[5:37] life Paul Keith Davis and that word was
[5:40] that the pain of your past was
[5:43] preparation for your future and I
[5:46] believe that with all my heart I don't
[5:48] believe that any trial is wasted in the
[5:51] life of a child of God the only thing
[5:54] that would cause a hardship or a loss to
[5:57] be wasted in our lives is is if we
[6:00] allowed our circumstances to make us
[6:03] bitter I often say you're going to be
[6:06] changed by what you go through you're
[6:08] either going to become bitter or you're
[6:11] going to become better and I implore you
[6:13] in the name of our beloved Lord to allow
[6:17] the trials of life and the pain of the
[6:19] past to make you better to cause you to
[6:23] run closer to the Lord please children
[6:26] of God don't pull back when you you're
[6:29] facing a trial pull closer pull closer
[6:33] up to him I often tell this uh little
[6:37] story about a little boy who was about
[6:39] to be paddled by his father and uh I I
[6:44] know that I'm speaking to you in
[6:46] different countries and some of which uh
[6:48] it would be illegal to administer
[6:50] corporal punishment but uh in this story
[6:53] that happened oh so long ago the father
[6:56] was about to to use a a belt or a paddle
[7:00] on his child and when he when he tried
[7:02] to swing back to strike the child on his
[7:05] bottom the little boy reached his arms
[7:08] around his daddy's legs and held on
[7:11] tight and the daddy said move Son I I've
[7:14] got to paddle you now you've disobeyed
[7:16] father and and the little boy pulled
[7:18] away but as soon as his father tried to
[7:21] to swat him again on the seat of the
[7:23] pants he grabbed his father's leg and
[7:25] held on again and the father said Son
[7:28] I've told you you I can't reach you if
[7:30] you if you pull up to my leg like that
[7:33] and the little boy said but Daddy The
[7:35] Closer I Get to You the less the licks
[7:39] hurt and I truly believe there was a lot
[7:42] of wisdom in that little boy's response
[7:45] to his father that day I believe that we
[7:48] get we get licked we get beat about and
[7:51] knocked about by the pressures and
[7:52] tolles of life but the closer we draw to
[7:56] our Heavenly Father oh Hallelujah the
[7:58] closer we get to him the less the pain
[8:02] is the less the licks hurt and so let me
[8:06] encourage you to draw right up into the
[8:08] arms of your loving father and let him
[8:10] hold you through the trials of life and
[8:14] through every circumstance and I want to
[8:16] remind you before we break into this
[8:18] study I also want to remind you that
[8:21] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[8:24] today and forever and he is still a
[8:28] savior if you're lost lost and undone
[8:30] without him he is still standing before
[8:33] you with outstretched arms he does not
[8:36] need to pay another price for your
[8:38] salvation the price was paid once and
[8:41] for all he offered himself as a Living
[8:45] Sacrifice on our behalf and he shed the
[8:49] perfect blood of God the blood that had
[8:52] been specifically designed and created
[8:55] of his father for the purpose of
[8:57] redeeming mankind and so the price has
[9:00] been paid it is finished as Jesus said
[9:04] on the cross when he was giving up the
[9:06] ghost when his Spirit was leaving his
[9:08] body it is finished and I want to tell
[9:12] you it is finished all you have to do is
[9:15] access the finished work of the Cross by
[9:18] faith turn your faith loose do you
[9:21] believe that Jesus is your savior do you
[9:24] believe that he died on a cross to
[9:28] forgive you and save you from your sins
[9:30] do you believe that he is able to do
[9:34] what he said in his word he could and
[9:37] would do even in these last days if you
[9:40] do and you confess with your mouth and
[9:43] believe in your heart that Jesus is the
[9:47] son of God and that he died and was
[9:50] raised from the dead on your behalf ask
[9:52] him to come into your life uh and in
[9:56] doing so if you believe with your heart
[9:58] and confess with with your mouth the
[9:59] Bible said you will be saved and your
[10:02] house which means you you receive a
[10:05] promise for household salvation you
[10:08] receive a promise for your family to
[10:11] come in and I will join my faith with
[10:14] yours and ask the Lord to bring your
[10:17] lost loved ones as sheep into the fold
[10:20] of our wonderful and loving Shepherd I
[10:24] want to remind you that he is still able
[10:26] not only to save but to cleanse and to
[10:29] deliver if you have an addiction in your
[10:32] life or you are bound by compulsive
[10:34] Behavior if there's something that seems
[10:37] to be driving you to do the things that
[10:39] you desire not to do there is power in
[10:42] the blood of Jesus and there is
[10:44] Deliverance in his name Surrender Your
[10:47] Life to God and and he will give you
[10:50] Authority the Bible said he has given us
[10:53] power over all the powers of the enemy
[10:57] and I believe that word word I don't
[10:59] believe that it's just a verse from a
[11:01] Dusty old book I believe that it is a
[11:04] living reality that this printed Word is
[11:08] Alive and that it lives in our hearts
[11:12] and we can be transformed by The Living
[11:14] Word of God in this hour and then I also
[11:17] want to share that not only can he save
[11:20] us and cleanse us and Deliver Us from
[11:23] whatever it is that the enemy has used
[11:26] to bind us but he is still a Healer He
[11:29] Is A Healer with his stripes we are
[11:35] healed the same Stripes that he bore on
[11:38] his back and the shedding of blood that
[11:41] saved your lost soul and transformed
[11:44] your spirit is the same atonement the
[11:47] same Stripes that bring healing to your
[11:50] body and I know that disease is rampant
[11:53] and I know that people are sicker in
[11:55] this hour than they've ever been but I
[11:57] must encourage you to still still
[11:59] believe that Jesus Is A Healer you're
[12:02] looking at a man who is seen with my own
[12:05] eyes I have heard of what God can do yes
[12:09] and I've heard what he did a generation
[12:11] ago but I have seen with my own eyes the
[12:14] miracle working power of God I have seen
[12:18] with my own eyes the blind receive their
[12:21] sight the deaf receive their healing
[12:24] I've seen the crippled get up and walk
[12:26] and even the dead raised in the
[12:28] authority of Jesus Christ I am a living
[12:32] witness to you that he is the same
[12:34] yesterday today and forever so be
[12:37] encouraged in your faith perhaps you're
[12:40] tired of waiting perhaps your hope has
[12:42] become deferred but I encourage you to
[12:45] keep on keeping on put your heart in uh
[12:49] in the word of God just line up your
[12:51] heart with the word and believe like
[12:54] you've never believed before that God
[12:56] will do what he said he would do I have
[12:59] proven him F folks and I have found him
[13:02] to be true I don't know where all that
[13:05] came from uh I had no intention of
[13:07] sharing all that with you but whoever
[13:09] you are watching this program right now
[13:11] God loves you so much he's reaching out
[13:14] to you and I want you to respond to his
[13:17] call in this hour all right let's look
[13:19] to our study for
[13:21] today I want to read a verse of
[13:23] scripture to you from the book of Exodus
[13:27] the book of chimote or the book of
[13:29] names and it is uh Exodus chap 32 and
[13:34] I'd like to begin reading in verse 35
[13:37] and the Lord plagued the people because
[13:41] they made the calf which Aaron made and
[13:45] this is a scripture that talks about uh
[13:48] when Moses was up on the mountain
[13:51] communing with God siai and uh 40 days
[13:55] he was away from the people and the
[13:57] people got tired of waiting on him and
[14:01] wondering if he was going to come back
[14:03] and so they began to make their excuses
[14:06] and they began to say we want a God that
[14:08] we can see and so they made with the
[14:11] help of Aaron a golden calf and God was
[14:15] very displeased and as you know when
[14:17] Moses came back down the mountain he was
[14:20] very displeased and a plague fell on the
[14:23] people and many people died that day now
[14:26] I'd like to read Exodus chapter 33 the
[14:29] next chapter and the first two verses to
[14:32] begin our study and the Lord said unto
[14:35] Moses depart and go up hence thou and
[14:39] the people which thou Hast brought up
[14:41] out of the land of Egypt unto the land
[14:45] which I swear unto Abraham to Isaac and
[14:48] to Jacob saying unto thy seed will I
[14:52] give it listen at the promise of God and
[14:55] I will send an angel before thee and I
[14:59] will drive out the Canaanite the Amorite
[15:02] the hittite and the perizzite the hivite
[15:06] and the jebusite now this was the
[15:08] promise to God that it was time for the
[15:11] people to move up and that he would send
[15:13] an angel to go before the people on the
[15:17] way now remember as we go along back to
[15:22] chapter 32 the plague has come the
[15:25] people are stirred up they're Disturbed
[15:27] there's been a uh many people have died
[15:30] at the hand of the sword of the Levites
[15:32] and and there's a lot going on and now
[15:35] God is speaking to Moses I'm not going
[15:38] to lead the people up but I will send my
[15:41] angel that word Angel is a messenger I
[15:45] will send my messenger before you and he
[15:48] will lead you up but Moses was not
[15:52] satisfied with this
[15:54] arrangement I I mean as powerful as it
[15:57] would be for the angel that God sent to
[15:59] come down and Lead You Moses began to
[16:03] negotiate with God he began to let him
[16:06] know I don't know this Angel but I know
[16:08] you and I want you to be the one to lead
[16:11] us up and so in verse uh 10 through 15
[16:16] of Exodus 33 let's read that and and
[16:19] we'll continue moving on and all the
[16:22] people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at
[16:25] the Tabernacle door and all the people
[16:28] rose up and worshiped every man in his
[16:31] tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses
[16:35] face to face as a man speaketh unto his
[16:41] friend and he turned again into the camp
[16:44] but his servant Joshua the son of noon a
[16:47] young man departed not out of the
[16:50] Tabernacle there was Joshua lingering
[16:53] behind in the manifested presence of God
[16:57] and he would need need that saturation
[17:00] he would need that uh that impartation
[17:04] of the divine manifested presence of God
[17:07] because Joshua was going to play a very
[17:09] important role in the future of leading
[17:12] the nation of Israel and Moses said unto
[17:15] the Lord listen at his at his uh
[17:18] imploring a at his
[17:20] negotiation he said to the Lord see thou
[17:23] sayest unto me bring up this people and
[17:26] thou Hast not let me know who whom thou
[17:28] wil send with me yet thou H has said I
[17:32] Know Thee by name and thou Hast also
[17:35] found Grace in my sight now therefore I
[17:39] pray thee if I have found Grace in thy
[17:43] sight show me now thy way that I may
[17:48] Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy
[17:54] sight and consider that this nation is
[17:57] thy people and he said said my presence
[17:59] shall go with thee and I will give thee
[18:02] rest and he said unto him this is Moses
[18:05] responding to God if thy presence go not
[18:09] up with me then carry us not up hence
[18:13] and Moses said I don't know this Angel
[18:16] but I know you and I want you to be the
[18:19] one that goes with us now Moses had
[18:22] experience this fa to-face intimacy what
[18:26] does it mean face to face
[18:28] it means that there was no one or no in
[18:33] the way that would hinder Moses from
[18:36] being able to look upon the glory of the
[18:38] Lord and to hear the voice of God and
[18:43] yet we find that it was still not enough
[18:46] there was something in the heart of
[18:49] Moses that was crying out for more have
[18:51] any of you ever had that kind of an
[18:53] experience do you know what it means
[18:56] when the Deep calls to the Deep when
[18:58] there's something on the inside of the
[19:01] inside that says thank you Lord for what
[19:04] I have had in you and what I have
[19:06] experienced in you but oh I need you
[19:10] more today and I need more of you in my
[19:15] life today than I did yesterday friend I
[19:18] believe that is the heart cry of the
[19:21] bride of Christ I've got to have you
[19:25] more and more in my life
[19:29] he then said God you know my name you've
[19:31] told me that and I want you to show me
[19:34] the way into Canaan I want you to lead
[19:37] us again I don't know this angel that
[19:39] you wish to send I want to know you and
[19:43] this desire to know God it reminds me of
[19:47] of the same kind of statement that Paul
[19:49] the Apostle made in the New Testament
[19:51] when he said that I may Know Thee that I
[19:55] may know the power of your Resurrection
[19:58] and and this word know is not about
[20:02] knowledge like we often sort of
[20:06] interpret this in our minds this is an
[20:09] is an intimate knowing it's more than
[20:12] hearing a lecture or learning a lesson
[20:15] or attending a seminar this is more than
[20:18] the transfer of information this is a
[20:21] god encounter and God is going to have a
[20:26] people in this hour
[20:28] that have encountered his presence that
[20:32] have met him in a real and in a tangible
[20:37] way now much of what we access is by
[20:41] faith but I don't want you to come away
[20:44] from that thinking that you can't feel
[20:48] and experience the power of God there
[20:51] are many people who say that all of that
[20:54] ceased in the early church but I want
[20:56] you to know that God has a moed with you
[20:59] he has an appointment with you and if
[21:03] his spirit is calling you or drawing you
[21:05] in this hour then that is the proof you
[21:08] need he wants to meet with you he wants
[21:10] to Rendevous with you and he's after
[21:13] your heart and uh I'm looking in this
[21:17] hour for more and more of God's people
[21:20] to come to a place where they have a
[21:22] personal encounter a personal
[21:24] commissioning you know one of the
[21:26] reasons why we need that in our lives is
[21:29] because the enemy Huffs and puffs and
[21:32] howls and accuses and rages against us
[21:36] those who are trying to hold on to the
[21:38] Lord Jesus in this hour and we need an
[21:40] anchor we need something that will rise
[21:43] up in us that we can use to say to the
[21:46] enemy hey I was there when it happened I
[21:49] ought to know the power of God I've
[21:51] touched him or I have been touched by
[21:54] him I am not a person who believes that
[21:57] this was only for Old Testament Saints
[22:01] to be able to encounter God in this
[22:03] manner and I'm not a person who believes
[22:06] that it stopped in the New Testament and
[22:08] that only New Testament people those who
[22:10] are living in the second temple period
[22:13] are are those who were able to encounter
[22:15] God I believe that I have been blessed
[22:18] to encounter God personally and
[22:21] individually and I believe if you will
[22:23] set your heart toward him and seek his
[22:26] face and put your yourself before him in
[22:29] humility and in honesty and in integrity
[22:32] and you'll begin to cry out to him
[22:34] believing what he has said in his word I
[22:37] believe you'll feel the presence of God
[22:40] I believe God is able to penetrate the
[22:42] darkness and break through in your life
[22:45] so that you can feel him and know that
[22:47] he is real this was the Cry of Moses I
[22:51] want to know you I want to become more
[22:55] intimately acquainted with with you and
[22:58] I want to know you by the spirit I want
[23:01] to know you by the spirit the Bible said
[23:04] that spiritual things are not discerned
[23:07] in the natural they're not understood
[23:09] through through carnal reasoning but
[23:12] spiritual things are of course
[23:15] spiritually understood and God wants us
[23:19] to have spiritual understanding I know
[23:22] that I have not particularly stuck with
[23:25] my lesson for today but I want to end
[23:29] this program by praying for you I don't
[23:31] know if you can feel where you are right
[23:34] now what I feel but I feel in the depth
[23:37] of my spirit that God wants to encounter
[23:41] somebody he wants to meet somebody who's
[23:45] watching this program today he wants to
[23:48] allow you to feel him and to know that
[23:53] he is real and that he desires to do
[23:57] something in your life I feel like some
[24:00] of you are facing family tragedy turmoil
[24:04] and you need to be reminded you have
[24:07] tried to hold on to God for your loved
[24:10] ones for their help for their
[24:12] deliverance and you've grown discouraged
[24:14] let me encourage you today by reminding
[24:17] you that the God we serve is a faithful
[24:20] God he doesn't always move in our time
[24:23] frame because he doesn't just operate in
[24:26] time he is of eternity and he moves out
[24:30] of Eternity and through time and so it
[24:34] doesn't always happen when we want it

[25:20] that you will make yourself known in
[25:23] their lives many of them Father are
[25:26] burdened for their loved ones on they
[25:28] have cried out to you on behalf of their
