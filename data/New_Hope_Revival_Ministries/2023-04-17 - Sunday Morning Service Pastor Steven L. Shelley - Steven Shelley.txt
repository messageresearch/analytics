Your Presence feel this place while they continue to play do you have a need on your heart today by the lifting of the hand all over the house there are hands those of you that are watching this service the Lord knows your needs he knows how to handle every one of them and we lift those needs up to the Lord on your behalf believing the Lord to minister to your needs we want to remember sister Anna's dad sister Anna Miller's dad brother Forrest Farmer they took him by ambulance to the hospital this morning with heart issues and they're going to keep him I guess overnight for observation they're not exactly sure what's going on there let's remember brother Forrest farmer to the Lord we want to remember brother Daniel's sister Anna's son Joseph and his wife McKinley their daughter Naomi and her husband Trevor and they're also going to be traveling this week and they're going to have fellowship with family they're asking the Lord to be in their travel and in their Fellowship we want to remember Sister Flo having had surgery this week asking the Lord to give her quick recovery would you remember a man by the name of brother Jimmy McNulty the Lord knows the need that he has it's a desperate need but my God is gracious and full of compassion and tender Mercy we want to ask the Lord to be with him did they take his legs they did take both of his both both Let's uh remember Sister Sandy Mann who was uh awakened in the night with the virus very ill needs to be remembered to the Lord in prayer brother Cliff Halls was in the hospital overnight they think it was a light stroke but it had a lot of a lot of effects a lot of things going on at the moment and we want to hold him up to the Lord in prayer and also he and sister Julie's Aunt um Betty lost a daughter and it was rather unexpected and did they didn't even know it they were trying to notify the family for several months and it has uh it's it's affected me a little it weighed heavy on my mind in my heart so would you lift up brother Peter Halls it was his it was his niece let's lift him up to the Lord and believe that God will Undertake and crystalline as most of you know is in the hospital and she has been induced to to for labor which is wonderful because that means the babies are healthy enough to go through vaginal labor instead of a C-section they are estimating that one is three pounds and one is four pounds which is very very doable then Ben was showing me a little baby that was born one pound one ounce is that right Ben yes 24 weeks and doing very well so we just believe I think it's a very good sign that they're letting her deliver and it's with a doctor that a lot of our our young sisters have used and so we give God praise let me give you the last report uh it came in just a few minutes ago just before 11 she is five centimeters we talk about things here real plainly I know some of you it bothers you good she's five centimeters but she's fully effaced and they just broke Baby A's water and I believe baby a is Lydia and so now they are they're waiting they're waiting and at the moment crystalline was doing very well with her contractions using lots of humor and the grace of God to get through it so let's believe maybe before we're through here we may have two may have two little Healthy Babies let's just believe the Lord yes amen Hallelujah let's take these needs to the Lord today our father how thankful we are that we serve the Living God the same yesterday and today and forever oh I thank you Lord that we can come together with the saints of God to worship and

me to announce to you that you are cordially invited the invitations came virtually or uh electronically and some of you they did not have your phone number and so I am to invite all of you who wish who would like to share in in their celebration together next Saturday I have asked to not perform the ceremony and they have graciously allowed me to go and be a participant and to maybe for once enjoy a wedding instead of having to work but I will join the other ministers in uh praying a prayer of blessing over the couple and it's my joy uh and Delight to do so but I am very thankful that sister Anita understood um it's a it's a thing that makes me so nervous anyway these uh weddings and funerals say I I don't enjoy them at all and uh if there's one thing I learned when I was at the beach um there it's this I don't have to do what I don't really feel to do I know that's hard to hear but the Lord really talked to me about boundaries and I've always tried to stay away from those when it comes to people but the Lord really dealt with my heart about my own life my own gift and my own health and there are just times that we just can't do what people would like for us to do or expect us to do and sometimes people get their feelings heard and I ask you please don't do that the sister Anita was so gracious in letting me off the hook but let me let me give you the information if you would like to take it down and we're looking forward to being there it is next Saturday April the 22nd at uh five o'clock Eastern time our time four o'clock Central time I probably didn't even need to mention that to confuse you what time five o'clock our time five o'clock and it is at Fountain Gate Church uh is that what we have known as Ballard is that the same building does anyone know same building where we have gone before for high school graduations and Etc and that is found at 1415 Moore's Mill Road in Auburn 36830 Fountain Gate Church 1415 Moores Mill Road Auburn Alabama 36830 I'm giving you the ZIP code so you can put it in and there will be a cake and coffee served after the ceremony for all who attend and a private reception following so anyway you you now and please don't feel bad if you didn't have an invite earlier than this sister Anita asked that we provide a list of phone numbers and I was away and we're trying to get a list updated and we didn't have it and really couldn't take the time to compile it at that moment and so it's uh we share in the responsibility if you didn't get your invitation on a text um you are more than invited to go and share in their celebration and I called him brother Christian he does have a first name Chris it just slipped my mind now how could you miss that Chris Christian well anyway it slipped my mind uh today is Sister Sandy Mann's birthday and I feel so sorry for her to be sick on her birthday I don't want to be sick any day uh you know I'm not paranoid or fearful but someone said I think I might have the virus I said just don't shake my hand uh because what we have all come through I don't I don't want to have to walk down that road again can I get a witness uh Tuesday is uh Moses birthday is that you Moses back there and Daddy's arms hold your hand up so they can see you Moses has a birthday on Tuesday April the 18th can we all just clap our hands and say happy birthday to Moses we might remember it again Tuesday night [Applause] on Wednesday a precious sister a friend of mine for many many years she flew from Germany uh uh 25 almost 26 years ago for our wedding and she has been a sweet friend uh sister Gabriella and uh wallenmeyer and she is a streamer and her birthday is on Wednesday and if she should see this I believe she will we want to say happy birthday to Sister Gabriella and then on Friday uh of this coming week is Luke Jernigan where is Luke he's he's up in the sound but hold your hand up Luke let everybody see you wave at everybody there you go good job that's his birthday how old you're going to be 18 uh 17. that's right 16 18. 18. wow that don't mean anything my kids come around told me said I'm fixing to be 18. I said so what what's that matter I mean happy birthday but you're whippable you can be whipped on Friday just like you could on Thursday so don't you think that 18 means anything and also Friday is uh Nathan and shoshana's wedding anniversary Nathan how many years is this five years that's Grace five years let's thank the Lord and wish them a happy anniversary I want to share this with you uh since the saints were here you know we've been praying for uh our former Amish brothers and sisters God is blessing them you know part of their Amish tradition has been uh not having a central meeting place but going from home to home I don't know if you know this or not but brother Jonathan Hollis is is uh worshiping with them on Sundays it's a couple hour drive but he's driving up and he is in his element uh you take you take Jonathan and put him in Jerusalem and he wears a black hat and he is Orthodox Jewish and you put him in a I mean he just adapts very well and you put him in a plain culture and he can just adapt and he loves it and I like it too because it's almost like I've got a little spy in the camp and he slips me videos and pictures of things as sweet children that I might not get to see the sweet Children Here worshiping but in at home I get to see them and but they are building a church and I am so thankful so thankful and they they are paying for it as they go and uh not borrowing any money to do it and so they're thinking that it could be several years in the making and they're perhaps going to close in the basement and it'll have a full basement I've already seen a picture of what they've done so far beautiful going to be a very beautiful structure and um they will if if if they decide to go this course they will have church in the basement for for some time but but putting off the Finish date two or three years and and I just said to the brother I'm not going to believe that I'm just not going to believe that I love the fact that they're going to pay for it as they go I got that I love that that's beautiful but I believe that the Lord can provide I believe he can provide and I don't have to say this but uh two times they have been very generous to us in our fundraising effort to pay off this property and I'm so thankful for that and they have said we do it because we're fed also from your ministry there and I appreciate that but they didn't have to do that and so would you help me pray that God Will Make A Way I would like to see that building and I know that the labor is there and the know-how is there and I know that if the Amish can come together and build up a barn in one day I know if the materials were paid for it wouldn't take them two or three years to finish that building and uh so would you just help me pray When you pray that God will will bless them and that he will uh provide for them in in unusual ways and if at some point you want to have a part in that I I don't know about you but I've gotten to wear these last few years I like to have a part in everything I do I can't maybe I can't uh write a big check uh but you know what it's not that sometimes it's just having a part in it and when I hear a young man in the message said I want to record a I want to record an album I I you know what I mean a recording I I want to do that I've always wanted to do that and he's quite talented and and he said I'm gonna have to raise the money to do it well I was there one time and I remember needing the money to put out the only tape I ever put out was Eagle's Wings and people helped me some and I appreciated it so it was my pleasure to sew a little bit into that immediately I did it and he said well brother Shelley you know I don't even really know you that well and it's not about who we know it's about all the souls that will be blessed and strengthened and encouraged and I've given toward funerals of people that I never met around this message because I think it's a wonderful thing to have a part in blessing a family and help there have been accidents and there have been things that I knew that I could fifty dollars or a hundred dollars or something like that so if you should ever feel that you would like to bless those brother others we will make sure that it gets in their hands and not only that we'll all go up and celebrate the dedication of that building at some point the little brother and his wife who were here uh not not this past Fellowship but the one before who live in Ohio they're also building a building and they've asked me to come and dedicate that building when it's finished and what I started this whole speech about was to tell you that just recently since they were here they have gone to Ohio to a small community of former Amish people and they have been reading the supernatural books and have been so stirred up praise God that they had the Saints to come from Indiana to Ohio and they baptized 17 in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ isn't that wonderful hallelujah praise God and when I got the report I just said it started that Revival that God showed me for the Amish is coming it's starting and I'm so thankful for that and there is a group in Wisconsin that they're also witnessing to and and brother Emmanuel Byler who comes and sits on the front here from Kentucky uh he and his wife just accompanied them to Wisconsin this past week and there were some things going on there including a funeral very sad uh 45 year old Amish woman who who lost her battle with cancer and they were there for that but also for some other Ministry and I thought that was so wonderful that brother Byler and his wife because he is former Amish and I thought it was so wonderful that he could go and have Fellowship in that community and and they can work for the Lord I will be happy when the word comes back to me that every Amish community in America is being stirred for the message of the hour God is more than able to do that and it started with brother and sister Miller in Missouri they were the forerunners they're the ones who gave me hope they're the ones who encouraged me and strengthened me to keep believing for the vision to come to pass and now we see it coming to pass and I'm so very very thankful for it and I wanted to share that with you let's stand let's go to the word of God everybody all right I know you wanted to hear that good news and God bless all of you who are streaming uh the gossmans and the van hoodens in Netherlands and brother Stacy in Trinidad uh brother Merle in Arizona and so many of you and Brother David and sister Debbie Gossman cousins have been streaming with us for a few weeks now and we just welcome them and we hear that they're uh interested in coming here for a visit and they've been sharing the services with friends of theirs who perhaps are interested to come for a visit and that just excites us because God's doing some amazing things oh I wished I could tell you a few things but we have to wait until it's a little further down the road uh you know we there's some things we don't want the devil to know about we fly under the radar sometime because like brother banham said if Satan should get a hold of that he'd do a lot of damage oh if we knew what some of these brothers think we know we'd have been in worse shape than we're in now if Satan would have got a hold of some of that but he won't it won't be released until the very end of time just in time to get the bride sweep in and get us out of here aren't you glad Romans chapter 8 beginning in verse 27 through 39 it's a long reading I'm going to I'm going to charity just for your information I'm going to skip those first two quotations and pick them up maybe Tuesday night since I took so much time works is Faith expressed in trying to do God a service I'll pick those up maybe Tuesday night or another time and I'm going to go straight after reading this scripture I'm going to go straight to the quotations that were a part of the March 28th notes and then and then move forward and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he make it intercession for the Saints read that according to the will of God I love it and we know that all things that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose let me ask you are there any Saints here today who identify as being called according to the purpose of the Lord all right we've got a house full of them then now we go on for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be what the firstborn or the first fruits among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified this is very important that we get a hold of the the five steps there are five steps in your Redemption and that is being foreknown being predestinated being called being justified and being glorified Grace five steps to your Redemption and they are a part of your destiny book are you with me and so it in I know this if you're a part of that bride these five steps are outlined in your destiny book you were foreknown you were predestinated you were called you have been Justified you are being glorified and then it's done isn't that good news what shall we say then to these things if God before us what Democrat what king what potentate can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us freely give us all things not ration down freely freely give us all things who you you can't say who you've got to say who who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect you better be careful blaming the elect of God you better be careful accusing the elect of God you better be careful judging the elect of God it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God which is not at the right hand of a person but at the right hand of power and authority who also maketh intercession for us so God makes intercession for us through Christ and also through the Holy Spirit one person one eternal spirit two offices I want to tell you something you've got three offices you've got three distinct works of God three distinct personalities or offices our administrations of God all interceding the spirit the same but all interceding on another level on a different level for your life you can't lose you can't lose you've got all of God making intercession for you powerful isn't it who shall separate us from the love of Christ I like it that way who shall and then it goes to what who shall separate us from the love of Christ it doesn't start naming people are enemies that start it starts naming Watts shall tribulation no or distress no or persecution no our famine no our nakedness no or Peril no our sword what is the answer no none of that as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter why because we're called to lay down our lives we can't take it up and try to live it out of our own will anymore we must live it out of Holy Spirit now in all day nigh no low in Hebrew in all these things we are we're not conquerors we're more than conquerors we're like the wife that stayed home we're not like the man who went and won the boxing match he's a conqueror we're like the wife who stayed home and waited on the paycheck he gets home she meets him at the door handed over he gives her the paycheck for the victory that he won so he's a conqueror what is she Jesus won the battle he went to the boxing match he defeated the enemy in every part in every way and every fashion is that right and he hands you the check bride of Christ wife of the Lord he hands you the check and he says nay in all these things you are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded and that is not a feeling of persuasion is much more uh much more much deeper than that it is a passionate decision for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing is left out nothing can separate us from the love of God nothing that happens can separate may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated Paul lists five distinct steps to our destiny Redemption they may somehow overlap one another but they are distinct enough to study them individually and we have done that here but the Lord brings us back to them again we are going to look perhaps Tuesday night we will look again at the Ancient of Days the white wigged one the one who sometimes confuses people when they're reading that the one that John saw uh on the Isle of Patmos in in the glorified Christ he appeared not with brown hair of a middle eastern man but are dark black hair of a middle eastern man but he he appeared as one whose hairs were white like wool as white as snow how did John describe his eyes they were as a flame of fire that's powerful isn't it John was seeing the glorified Christ the Christ who had resurrected and ascended his glorification did not take place only in the resurrection he then had to ascend and he fulfilled then the whole testimony of the Feast of firstfruits and the Bible said he made us we talked about this Tuesday evening he made us accepted in the Beloved you are accepted I want you to know something people may not accept you down here they may not understand you down here you may face more rejection than you do acceptance but you need to remember you're not living on the acceptance of other people you're not functioning by how other people react to you you are accepted by the Beloved you are foreknown predestinated call Justified and glorified and the devil doesn't know what to do with you somebody help me a little bit he doesn't know what to do with you because you're living out of your destiny scroll you're living out of those five steps of redemption you have been foreknown you have been predestinated you have been called you have been Justified and you are being glorified you're in the process of your glorification he's getting your robe ready the same road brother random said he dressed Christ in on the day of transfiguration which is the day of his glorification so glorified so transfigured before their eyes that light penetrated and inhabited the cells of his body and purest light began to shine out of the pores of his skin God dressed him in a robe of glory and that same robe and it was the robe that said it was the robe that he wore that testified hear ye him when the father gave him that robe it said to the whole Community hear what he has to say he's a fully adopted son when God drapes that when God drips when he droops drapes that robe on your shoulder the message will be the same hear him hear her she doesn't speak of herself anymore he said speak of himself anymore he only speaks of the glorified Christ isn't that powerful you're not acting like it that's powerful all right so let's look at these first steps of our Redemption process we could mark them in our destiny scroll they are there we may not be able to identify the very moment that he first knew us but he can he knows the very moment that he thought about you first all I know is the scripture said it's before the foundations of the earth were laid that's all I know I don't know what day time had not yet been created so I don't know what day what time what month it was it was in eternity Hallelujah but there was a moment that God thought about you first and that is his foreknowledge and I'm telling you foreknowledge is very important as we talked about the last Tuesday night of March the word foreknowledge in the Greek means to know beforehand it means to be previously acquainted with it means to determine or choose beforehand it means to foreordain as in First Peter 1 20. it means to foresee and to appoint as the subject of future privileges so for Christ to foreknow you it means that he appointed you as a subject of future privileges Hallelujah he saw you and he chose you to have his authority and he chose you to eventually function in his power and he chose you to be an overcomer like he was an overcomer and he accepted you for knowledge speaks of that which has already occurred in the counsel of the Lord and I want you to know the counsel of the lord it's not just a meeting of the minds the counsel of the Lord is a meeting in his mind and when the Bible said let us make man in our image it wasn't a conference table with three Gods sitting in chairs it was a conference that took place in his mind and everything that he was and every function that he would have and every office that he would hold they conferred together as one let us make man in our image the god that that Jaya was singing about Elohim he is a God who is one yet many not many in in persons hear ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one it's not a trinity of persons it's not God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost all coming together to talk they were having a baptism and brother she all sent it to me and and and you know the church they just want to baptize people in titles finally they started hollering at the man no he wants to do it in the name of Jesus so right at the end he slaps the name of Jesus on him as an afterthought it's more than an afterthought if you've not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by immersion you've never received Christian baptism if all you've ever received is entitles you've not received full Christian baptism if all you've ever had was sprinkling you haven't received full baptism it's by immersion and it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah this was a council that took place in the mind of God so don't look at it like council members coming together to sit down God just had the thought and every part of who he was accepted the challenge did you read there where it said Jesus intercedes for you the Holy Ghost intercedes for you there it is right there in that moment that God foreknew you he had knowledge of you beforehand he thought of you in that moment every part of who God is agreed they came in agreement every office that he would fulfill father son Holy Ghost agreed in that moment to work to do all that was necessary to get you to full Redemption you talk about angels on your side you've got God Almighty fighting for you I love the Angels but you've got something higher than the angels and that that's higher than the Angels is determined for you to make it I want you to know you're going to make it if you repent of your sins if you're baptized in the name of Jesus Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and filled with the walking talking Holy Ghost receiving the message of the hour and sealed to the bride you're going to make it because all of God is hanging on whether you make it or not it's not your reputation or my reputation or brother branham's reputation that's at stake it's God who promised for whom he did for no in this Council decisions were made about Destinies in the Earth not only in that beginning did God determine how the Earth would be and what percentage of the earth would be water and what percentage of the earth would be land how many planets he would hang in the sky how many stars and constellations and and and how they how that things would play out not only did he do that but Destinies were determined in that moment that God thought about you first powerful so there were there were Destinies of individuals determined there were Destinies of cities determined did you know it was God who chose Jeffersonville Indiana did you know it was God who chose Tucson Arizona to see what those cities saw to experience a Revival that those cities experienced various other PL do you know it was God who chose Azusa Street it could have happened on any Street in Los Angeles it could have happened in any city in America but God chose the City of Angels even though it's wicked and he's going to send it to the bottom of the ocean one day he chose it for Pentecost to be birthed in the Earth he chose an ignorant one-eyed black man despised hated and misunderstood to be the vessel that he would use to bring that Pentecostal outpouring to the Earth God chose that he chose this place he chose this County he chose this property we're here today because of vision put us here you ought to help me a vision put us here this wasn't the first property we looked at I walked several properties I really liked one of the properties that we saw I've pretty much fell in love with it there was a problem we couldn't make it match the vision so we had to walk away from it because it didn't match the vision the trees were where the trees were supposed to be the Cedars weren't where the Cedars were supposed to be and so we had to walk away flat High Ground perkable ground beautiful heavy heavily uh forests heavily populated Forest it hadn't been stripped of its Hardwood an old home place right up in the middle of it that had fallen in and hauled away but that one of my favorite things is an old fireplace out in the middle of the field sitting out in the middle right in the middle of them trees hidden from The View until you got out there was one of those big old beautiful fireplaces that was all that remained of the home place and and I had Visions all right I could see how beautiful that would be but it didn't meet the vision what was her name faith from the real estate agent she said preacher I got another place it ain't all that pretty but she said you might like it I can't think of her last name right now she said I'll show it to you she got told us where it was and we met her over here and it looked like a burned over wilderness the man and his wife who lived up there with where brother Hawkins sister Marybeth live they had divorced and they wanted to get every last dollar out of this land they could and they stripped the hardwood and there was ruts big enough for a school bus to go down in because they were in such a hurry to strip the land that they just it was such a muddy wet mess and they kept running those big machines through here to take that hardwood out and I could have I could have stepped down in one of those ruts and you wouldn't have seen me from anywhere on this property a school bus could have laid down in them but there was that was all right but I walked down I got all the way down down to the bottom and come come across through there like that and I started up a hill there was a cedar tree had fallen over or a tree had fallen over and my I looked down in my shoestring was untied and I reached down to tie my shoestring and when I looked up there were those cedar trees in the formation that God had showed them to me in a vision and I burst in tears and I said the same words it ain't pretty but this is the place that God wants to establish this ministry you're here because God had it in his mind before the foundation of the world that we would be gathered here this morning on this paper piece of property somebody said don't you think that's going a little far no no I don't believe it at all I could get way more specific than that you drove over here in the car that God knew you were going to have you sat down by the companion that God knew you were going to have you helped dress the children that God knew you were going to have to get them to church today you picked up the guitar and sat down to the drums chose the songs that God knew you were going to sing somebody said how is that possible because his foreknowledge is beyond our human capability of of understanding you think God's gonna lose one of us you think he's going to let you perish in some horrible way without finishing your destiny if you leave here tomorrow you can be assured that if I'm called on to say something at your funeral I will not get up and say your life was cut short that's what the newspapers say when somebody dies younger but let me tell you something when before you were ever born God knew your exit date he didn't only know the day you were going to enter he knew the day you were going to exit and every day of your life is written in his book scripture said so you can trust a God Like That you can trust a god like that you can trust a god like that if you make a choice that was not in his perfect plan for you he knows how to squeeze you back he knows how to get you back to that perfect path that he's chosen for you why don't we just trust him and pray and try to find out what he'd have us to do before we get a miss oh yes from the Council of the Lord there was a foreknowing about us all of this occurred Before Time now let me get these quotes in real quick I need to hurry these some of these we shared with you on that Tuesday night but I want to get them in here for the record paragraph nine of the message how the angel came to me in his Commission brother random said all these things is God's foreknowledge when he spoke of them what would be he foreknew it now God in order to be God at the beginning he had to know the end you believe that we got to live like we believe that or he wasn't the end for the God God's not willing that any should perish there he corrects this crazy idea about predestination that is so twisted and misunderstood he corrects that by saying it was not the will of God that any should perish but he only knew their choice he only foreknew their decision God is not willing that any should perish let's read on certainly not he doesn't want anyone to perish but at the beginning of the beginning of the days The World God knew just exactly who would be saved and who would not be saved if you believe that's amen if you don't believe it what do you believe do you believe we write our own destiny that's what they teach our children in public school that we make our own destiny that's not what the Bible teaches we don't make our own destiny we follow God's Destiny for our lives he doesn't want anyone to perish but at the beginning of the days The World God knew exactly who would be saved and who would not be saved he didn't want the people to be lost it's not his will that any should be lost but it's his will to save everybody but he knew from the beginning who would and who would not that's the reason he could foresee he foreknew because he foreknew he could say in advance this thing will happen that thing will happen this will be that this person will be that way see are you with me he would foreknow it because he's infinite if you know what it means that's just there's nothing that he doesn't know see he knows well there's nothing from Before Time and after and there's and after there's no more time see he still knows everything everything is in his mind and then as Paul said in Romans the 8th and 9th chapter then why does he still find fault so we so we see that but God like preaching the gospel someone said brother Brandon do you believe that I said look said you must be calvinist I said I'm calvinist as long as calvinist is in the Bible what a good answer now there's a limb on the tree that's Calvinism but there's more limbs on the tree also or true or two a tree has more than one limb he just wanted to run it on out there into eternal security and after a while you see I believe in eternal security but he said after a while you go on off into universalism see if you stay on the Calvinism limb and you keep beating down that limb you step out of the scripture so brother Adam said I follow Calvin as long as Calvin was teaching the Bible I follow the Armenians as long as they were teaching the Bible but when they start getting into that universalism that everyone will be saved he said you drop off out there somewhere there's no end to it but when you get through with Calvinism come up start on armenianism see there's another limb on the tree and another limb on the tree just keep on the whole thing together makes the tree so I believe in Calvinism as long as it stays in the scripture and I believe that God knew before the foundation of the world chose his church in Christ and slayed Christ not 2 000 years ago but slayed Christ before the foundation of the world in his mind the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world then in the in due time in the right time in the right moment in the right hour are you with me I'm asking because I don't know whether you are or not then in the right season and in the right moment Christ came lived his life performed the father's will died on the cross resurrected ascended let the Holy Ghost be poured out on the day of Pentecost finishing the Plan of Redemption but this plan wasn't formed at Calvary it was formed Before Time he said he knew us and predestinated us into the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ before the world was ever formed he said that's God that's our father see and then it is the rising of the sun paragraph 243 well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing oh yes she's got to prove something have to be exactly what the word said she would be in these last days don't she have to return through Malachi 4 don't she have to be manifested like it was in the days of Sodom don't the world have to be put just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of God made known to us the answer to all of that is what yes he said look notice this but God foresaw the bride and where was she in the groom where was Eve in the original Creation in Adam where was the bride when Christ was formed in Christ Hallelujah see to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife see Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her somebody ought to rejoice remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we deny it how can we do anything but love him friend I could still never ours but let's move on a little farther in the message Satan's Eden now that's the way God was in the beginning every Son of God every daughter of God was in God at the beginning you don't remember it now but you were there isn't that something he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you love you shake your hands that's powerful in the message Hebrews chapter 7 number one he's not willing that any should perish certainly not but if he's God he knowed who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved or he didn't know anything if he didn't know who would make the Rapture before the world was ever formed then he's not God do you all realize the churches don't teach such a thing as that they they teach it in such a way that God's going to be surprised when he sees you come in the rapture oh I didn't think you were going to make it how many of you know that's not the way it is at all no he knowed every flea I love this one every fly every loss every there's a bunch of them to know in Alabama every that would ever be on the earth before the Earth was ever formed listen now ever flee every fly every louse every that would ever be on the earth when did he know it before the Earth was ever formed that's right he knew all things before the foundation of the world he knew us the Bible said he knew us and did what and predestinated us now that is that's just good stuff First Peter chapter one verse 2 clearly says elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied Peter greeting the Saints and calling them the elect according to the foreknowledge of God wake up in here what a joy to know that you could be greeted the same way you that are awake if you're asleep you won't even know you're being greeted elect according to the foreknowledge of God somebody said but brother Shelley you don't know how hard we worked all week let me tell you something none of that is going to help you make the rapture I appreciate good work hard work faithful work I appreciate that but none of that is going to make you Rapture Ready this word will make you ready for the rapture this is more important than your Sunday afternoon nap I'm not mad well you're getting mad now I'm not mad I'm just telling you I respect you enough that if you are talking to me I'm gonna stay away and hear what you have to say even with my boundaries [Music] and I want you to respect the word that much now there's cold water in the bathroom and what I really don't understand is a wife that'll sit beside her husband and let him sleep well I'm afraid he's gonna hit me not in here he's not or a husband that sit beside his wife and let her sleep through the servant jerk her in love wake up we'll sleep another time come on I'm not mad it is true somebody ought to say it now then number two predestinated we're foreknown and then predestinated once these decisions were made and choices made in the mind of God they were then written down here's what I want you to understand the difference between foreknowledge and predestination foreknowledge is a thought he thought it and then he wrote it when it was written it became a pre-fixed destiny I don't know if the Finger of God wrote it our recording Angels wrote it or the Heavenly Host wrote it but once it became written down it's no longer just a thought it's now a thought expressed it becomes a word you move from the Redemption of by foreknowledge to the Redemption of predestination it's wonderful once they were written down recorded in a Heavenly book or scroll once they were written in that book of Heaven it became a predestinated thing then that's the next stage that Paul spoke about in Romans 8 and that word predestinated means to limit or Mark beforehand to design definitely beforehand to ordain beforehand to prefix boundaries beforehand you can only go so far some really ran from God let me see your hand if you'd say I ran from God look at the hands I ran from God but you could only run so far because his foreknowledge was towards you and he wrote your destiny down and he knew exactly how far you'd go he knew who you'd make fun of he knew what you'd say he knows some of the Terrible Things you'd say about the faith but he allowed it he knew that you would mock others along the way at times but he only allowed you to do so much of that because you were living in the prefixed boundaries of his predetermined plan oh thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you Lord thank you Lord from the Council of the Lord his foreknowledge God then wrote in a book the decisions and choices made that would be our reason for existence on the planet what God thought about you in the beginning became his recorded will for you in predestination we should only involve ourselves in the things that are important to heaven it is each one's individual responsibility to discover what was foreknown about them and then predestinated about them as it was recorded in heaven it's not my place to tell you or your place to tell me it's each individual laying in the presence of the Lord until you discern the heartbeat and will of God for your life and when you do you better get up and make sure that you are busy yes I want to tell you something that's not the Lord on some of you that got your little feelings in in a Twist that's not the Lord doing that for you that's your soul alive you want to know if your soul is still alive it's testifying this morning very much still alive push him out of the way push that big old sumo wrestler out of the way let your spirit feed on the word yes get your mind will and emotions and feelings and all that push I have to do it often I hear some awful things said there's a few churches I stream every week I hear some powerful things said but I hear some awful things say it I I I got real amazed this week because a father preached a sermon and then and a good band a wonderful man but in that sermon he's preaching about how how we you know we better be careful with our enthusiasm and we better be careful with our emotionalism and we better be careful the way we worship and get you know that's for the immature my then God decided to pour the Holy Ghost out on 120 immature men on the day of Pentecost didn't he they were they were mature enough that he trusted him with his power that don't hold any water and how we need the how we need love which true all that's true there's a Time to scream a little differently than we once screamed conduct ourselves a little differently than we once conducted ourselves but we don't we don't squeeze people out I ought not to say this I'm getting I'm going to get in trouble I think but I here's what really got me they called on a brother to pray in the service and he prayed this way and he didn't mean this you better be careful what you prayed he said Lord I Thank you for the all the preaching that goes across on this Pulpit because you know it quenches our spirit I said oh brother you didn't mean that you meant it quenches The Thirst we all I get twisted up in my words but God knew what was about to be said and then a few few the next service the son is preaching and he's preaching almost the very opposite of that we need an experience we need to be excited about what God's doing in this hour and I'm thinking poor people and it's everywhere folks it could be right here if we allowed it to be here this is not throwing any stones at anybody or anywhere it's just saying somebody ought to get together and make up their mind what they're going to preach Hey Brother Greeley and I are going to preach opposite of one another we got to have a little meeting somewhere we got to talk this thing out because the people are the ones that suffer in an atmosphere like that let me tell you what brother Tim Pruitt said somebody mentioned to me said you you ought to go back and hear that little exhortation that brother Pruitt gave at the close of the Sunday morning service last Sunday morning as the Youth Camp was was closing out and and I did hear a piece of it I heard the rules I heard that you need to go and get your things out of the dorm and and how they do because they're closing the camp down and pick up after yourself and and then people started coming in my office I guess and I didn't hear the rest of it so I went back this week and it was some of the wisest advice it was some of the most precious truth I I think I've about ever heard given to young people that were about to go back to all kinds of different versions of churches of different levels of life and death and this is what he said and I wrote it down and put it on my screen I I posted it to my on a Post-It note he said I want to encourage you to feed your experience does that sound like quenching something does that sound like only the immature get excited no he said to the young people something very wise and something that needed to be said he said now God met you here this week he met you here he lets you experience his presence now when you go home you may be the only one excited he said but here's the way feed your experience hello ship what God did for you remind the Lord I want more of that it's not our emotion it's not our screaming it's not our jumping around but it testifies that life is present it says I'm not a corpse bride brah she's a living moving breathing wife of Jesus Christ I thought to myself oh I hope every young person will feel that way because he said listen it only takes two or three of you to go turn your church upside down now if you think that's been critical of other churches no I I'm gonna be honest with you somebody every now and again has got to say it he said it only takes two or three of you to go home to your church and continue to Worship the Lord the way you have worshiped him here you can make a difference by entering in you can make a difference now what these brothers are are warning us about is getting so emotional in the worship and shutting our mouth when it comes time to feed it's not that any of those things I I've heard were wrong it's just we're looking at things from two different approaches I don't have confidence in people that hoop and holler and jump and scream and shout and Carry On In Worship and then shut their mouths and sleep during the preaching [Music] it's got to be the balance so here's an older brother looking at it from one hand and the younger brother looking for it from another end and where it's the truth always in the middle no criticism it's in the balance it's always in the middle we must we we've got to have a little life brother said if we don't he said that rut just you kick out both ends and it becomes a grave come on now we are foreknown predestinated it's each one's individual responsibility to discover what was foreknown about them and then predestinated about them as recorded in the books of Heaven brother Phantom said something very powerful about predestination he said it looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks back to Destiny I want to say that again predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to Destiny not looks back looks too predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to to Destiny in second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 9 the Bible said who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works this is from the notes of February excuse me of March 28th not according to our works it might not actually it actually might not have been there so that's okay not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began let me read it again second Timothy 1 9 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began now purpose and Grace purpose it's what's written in the book Grace is a special empowerment to work out and to fulfill what was written in your purpose purpose and Grace but according to his own purpose and Grace so it's not just what he chose for you or purpose for you but he also provides the grace how many of you are thankful for the grace to do what he's called us to do Eric little or Liddell in the movie Chariots of Fire where he chose to honor God by not running on the Sabbath this is an old movie this is what he said how many of you have ever seen the film Chariots of Fire you give up because he wanted to honor the day that belonged to the Lord and listen what he said about it he said when I run I feel the pleasure of God this statement reveals that he had discovered for this season of his life the purpose for which he had been graced it's very very important that in every season of our life we ask God to reveal to us what his purpose for us is in the season so that we can identify the grace that he's willing to endow upon us to help us get through every situation so there's two stages here foreknowledge and then predestination and and both of these stages of redemption took place before the Earth began Before Time began so not only did he foreknow you in eternity he predetermined your destiny in eternity the prophet goes on to tell us in the message where I think Pentecost failed paragraph 28 but if we'd only go back to find out when God made his first man he made man in his own image and God is a spirit so he had to make Spirit man now the word is used here in the fifth verse of predestination predestinated it's not a very good word for an evangelist or a minister to use because it kind of confuses people when you say predestinate did you know there are people that get witness to from some of you and when you tell them you believe in predestination they will tell you right up front that's false Doctrine how could the Bible be full of false Doctrine if predestination is a false Doctrine how come the Bible said to them before knew to them he also did predestinate no it's not a false Doctrine unless someone takes it out of the boundaries of the scripture you see the Primitive Baptist used to take it out of the parameters of the scripture and if a man come out in the holler and Shout a Man In Cold Blood the southern baptist would say get the devil out of that man the Primitive Baptist would have said he was predestinated to do that the pre the the error of predestination is taking any any choice out of a man God having a prefix Destiny for you did not rob you of your choice here's the balance you can choose to live according to his purpose and he will give you the grace to do it or you can choose to live your own will graceless how many of you have ever lived a season in the School of Hard Knocks without the grace of God to cover you and help you why because you chose to live outside of his purpose for your life he is not obligated to provide Grace to help you get through when you have chosen to live out of his purpose and plan so it's not that that some it's not that this gang or whatever went on up here in Dadeville as I was coming to church the news was just beginning to come out at least 20 people shot at a sweet 16 birthday party Downtown Dadeville last night four or five killed after church we will know more about how many were killed because they were the information was still just coming out and people there celebrating a sweet 16 they're saying that almost the entire group of the 20 are teenagers now predestination is not what made some gang go up there and do that kind of shooting or individual or what we don't know they think it was somehow gang-related Fayetteville Alabama not Chicago Backwoods America now whoever did such a terrible thing they were not predestinated to do it they did that on their own they made their own choice and they did it on their own and they're going to have to pay the price if they get caught but if you are walking according to God's will for your life he provides Grace to get her done aren't you glad aren't you glad because you could never do it without him it kind of confuses people when you say that predestinate predestination speaks it looks back to foreknowledge foreknowledge looks to destination predestination goes back to foreknowledge foreknowledge goes to destination in other words God didn't say now I'll let I'll make this man be this and I'll make this man to be that but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning see the balance so in order to foreknowledge that he knew he could say this would happen and that would happen because he was God and he knowed where everything would be placed and therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages you believe that he said that is truly scripture that's what the Bible said now in the message Jehovah Jireh paragraph 12 he said so we have to be what we are we have to be what we are gifts and callings are without repentance when you were born in this world before the world ever began God knew you positionally placed you if that isn't so then the Bible isn't so he said that's exactly now look at this God put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life not when you come to the altar but before the foundation of the world he said that's right that's what the Bible said so every person that would ever be saved their name is recorded already in the Lamb's Book of Life so we can sing all day long there's a new name written down in glory but we all know that's not exactly the way it works he said so that's what the Bible said when was the lamb slain you read it for me would you before the foundation of the world and when the lamb was slain your name my name was put on his book God by his foreknowledge saw all things he's infinite he know the end from the beginning he isn't willing but then he should perish that's not his desire but being God he had to know who would and who would not like Esau and Jacob he hated one and loved the other one before they were even born and had a chance to do anything because he was God and he knowed all things now people struggled with that but it is the word that is what the scripture said isn't it now Jehovah Jireh number one and we'll we'll close we won't get too far but we'll close in a minute he said now this unconditional Covenant he said not if you will I will but I will later on or something like that I have already give the land to you and your seat after you amen he said see already done it it's a finished work you say to Abraham he did that yes not only to Abraham hello but what to his seat after him and if we're Abraham's seed it's a finished product those who he foreknow he called those who he called he justified those who he has Justified he has already glorified in his mind you're just like him in his mind you've defeated every devil you're ever going to fight in his mind that's powerful so if he should come and say you're going to make it it's not based on his limited knowledge it's based on his infinite knowledge you're gonna make it he said what you're scared about why are you afraid let's go on in the Antichrist in the last days according to Revelation deceived all that dwelt upon the face of the Earth whose names they were in his foreknowledge but they weren't a part of his predestinated plan said he deceived all that were upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life since the last Revival no before the foundation of the world that's when your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was slain God spoke the word it was in his thinking in his thought he spoke the word and everything happened just at that time this is just God's seed materializing that's all his words coming down now when the light of God flashes across that quickly that seed recognizes it because it's born of God it's Abraham's seed foreknowed by God that's why the light flashes is to catch the seed that flashing light is a very important element of of what God's doing in this last day that's the Holy Ghost making the word real in you it's materializing the word in your life when that flashing light comes by the spirit I don't mean some physical light that you can see flashing I mean Revelation flashes on the word that's why you've got to be alert because the light flashes on that word and for that word to become activated in you you've got to be under that he said we've had a Revival Joel said we fuss so much about latter rain had movements called ladder rain later rain former rain in a rain out of rain he said I was reading the other day do you know what former rain means in the Hebrew word I can't call it right now I never wrote it down and skipped my mind but former Reign the first Reign Means A Reign of teaching the second Reign is the spirit that comes of what upon what's been taught and produces the crop that's Moray there is an early Reign that comes and gets the ground ready and then there is a ladder rain that comes to bring the crop to maturity where are we are we in former rain that was teaching rain when the word is being taught when the truth is being re-established when the light is shining on the word is that former rain or latter rain that's former rain God is getting the ground ready and the teaching is going forth and the word is being restored that's what we had a generation ago when the spirit of God comes just before the crop is mature and it rains again is that former rain or later rain that's latter rain that's Harvest maturity rain that's what we're crying out for in this hour that's what we're beginning to experience in these days come on now is maturity Harvest maturity rain ladder rain so we are not out of order if we get up and sing this is the promise of the coming latter rain that's not out of order you're just going to have a bunch of message people tell you when the latter rain's already fallen at Pentecost but here let me tell you this there's another Harvest cycle going on right now this isn't Pentecost there's another Harvest cycle every time the seed goes into the ground it has to keep it has to come right back and in the natural Harvest cycle there's one every year spiritually I don't think there's a harvest cycle every year but there is a harvest cycle seed goes in the ground because rain has prepared the soil and crops come forth and produce because the rain has come brother random said it rains on the just and the unjust quoting the scripture and he had the vision of those little grains those little little wheat he said they all raised up their hand and said praise the Lord the tariffs manifested and produced tears what did the real seed produce It produced real wheat because what goes into the ground is What comes forth in maturity anybody still here he said the second rain is the spirit that comes upon what's been taught I never wrote today said but former Reign the first rain Means A Reign of teaching the second rain is the spirit that comes about what has been taught and produces the crop so many of our Brethren would like to say that was the Revival that swept the earth when brother Branham was on the scene if that be the case then where is the produced crop I'm going to ask this I think I've already upset some folks so I might as well upset some more where are the 120 William branhams [Music] so I said what in the world are you talking about uh Jesus went in the grave and the devil danced with Glee he said we've killed the son of God he nearly had a nervous breakdown three days later three days three nights later when Jesus got up from the grave he said oh no I thought I killed him he needed a nerve pill didn't he what do you think he needed some few days later on the day of Pentecost when the very same Jesus that was manifested in one body it's now manifested in 120 bodies that quickly became three thousand [Applause] Jesus was that finished seed first fruits waved over the people We Believe brother random was the same in his day so then where are the 120 William branhams not in that office we're just looking for men and women who can produce the same Life of Christ that he produced and we have not seen that but we will we will talk about a nerve pill he's going to need more than a nerve pill when the bride's Revival reaches its full tilt and you've got you've got way more than 120 little bride members manifesting the very life of Jesus Christ calling those things that are not as though they are missing limbs being restored and stepping over ananiasis and survivors people get quiet because they think of their own loved ones the same God who graced you out can Grace them out don't ever forget that just put it in his hands and if we're Abraham's seed it's a finished product why is it that we had such a Revival Pentecostal Baptist all the other trees put forth their buds as Jesus said they would be and what have we hatched out the Baptist said they got a million more and 44. look at the Catholic how they increase look at all denominations look at Pentecost what did we do we sowed denominational seeds we reap denominational Harvest that same denominational spirit that attacked the early church that same denominational spirit that attacked the church on the day of Pentecost same denominational spirit that attacked the church at Azusa Street is the same denominational spirit that has attacked the the bride's message so we sowed mixed seeds and we're reaping a mixed Harvest but instead of being discouraged and giving up we say what do we do we sow again and this time we make sure that only the pure word goes into the field so that when the Harvest comes up it's pure word babies why the church ought to be on fire for God right now he said if there had been a word seed sowed back there and there would be signs wonders Miracles and that church would be together one heart one Accord marching toward Zion for the Rapture that's right he said what did we do we had intellectual speeches instead of the word we had reasoning against the word and everything else don't get too excited don't get emotional he said we've got to get back to the word we'll do we'll do it God said I will restore saith the Lord all the years at the canker worm and Palmer worms eat it's going to bloom out in the evening time there will come forth one with a message he'll restore the hearts of the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers what fathers [Music] not the Baptist fathers the Pentecostal fathers he promised it in Malachi 4 that he would do it return them back again what we did not expect was that delay once God restored his word through his messenger we expected the Harvest immediately to follow and that's why brother Branham said I look when I look out there I could predict it'll all be over by 77. because what God was doing in the 60s it certainly looked like that the crop that was going to come after that would sweep to the rapture but what happened the seed got mixed going in the ground you want me to tell you how it got mixed I know this is kind of just for a few people will understand it but but I won't tell you you know how it got mixed by people coming along said we didn't really mean that that's not really how he meant that you can't really take that like that you can't take that literal and every time something like that all you got to read between the lines [Music] he's telling us he's not Jesus because he wants to throw us off this is the kind of talk we heard somebody rolls up and said well you're you're baptizing in his name and somebody said well isn't that better than being baptized in titles no same Pagan lie same demonic spirit anybody with me and so that causes the mixture and so we have to come a whole generation past that still crying out for the Harvest the full Harvest had there not been a harvest no one would have preserved the word for us thank God for the generals thank God for the men who went before us thank God for those who stayed true to the word but we are children in the sense that we now must take that and do something with it got to get back to the word he said I'll restore saith the Lord all the years that canker worm and Palmer worms it's going to Blue Mound in the evening time now one more spoken words The Original Seed paragraph 420 it's 132 musicians can come and get ready he said notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5 19 so will the bride and he shows her his Word of Life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her anybody hearing this not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret here's the secret go tell somebody here's the secret the word is in the bride the mind of Christ this is purpose and Grace the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he once done with the word purpose and Grace and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord she who the bride she has thus saith the Lord then it is dermatized so the Holy Spirit Waters it it until it is grown and does what serves its purpose they do only his will this is what we're looking for this people amen I'll believe that no one can persuade them different calm down you'll settle down you want me to call names it kept me up all night in my motel room literally petted me on my head like a child and said when you get mature you'll settle down you're way too excited for this move if I were to yield to that I manifest I'm not the seed because they do only his will amen I'll believe that he said no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord or they then they will do the works of God now those who tell us that we are in the bride's Revival let me just ask you this question do you see people racing up with thus saith the Lord in their mouth and leading this movement forward very few if any does that discourage us actually no it doesn't discourage me at all it reminds me to keep my focus on being a part of that group instead of part of the other group it reminds me not to ever take for granted what God did when he restored the word he didn't restore the word to kill the bride He restored the word to give the bride power and authority right then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things when he was here this is not Pentecostal Assembly of God Church of God charismatic Doctrine this is something a little bigger than that when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet Jesus did all that he was supposed to do in his time here but there were some things that were never completed for it was not yet time because we see Jesus as the first fruits of the resurrection and the first fruits of them who slept I think we can come all the way over into our day we see brother Branham coming to maturity and we can say I believe without any adding to the scripture or the word I believe we can say that brother Branham did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet he did everything that he was supposed to do in his time and the Lord took him now God's counting on a bride not a return Ministry not a tent meeting not an airplane not trying to decide who's going to drive the the four the 18-wheeler around who's going to be the manager but realizing that the responsibility is now in the hands of the Bride now as we close we've covered foreknowledge we've covered predestination and then we come to one of the most important stages of your Redemption destiny and and time will not allow us to go into that this morning perhaps an attention span but let me say that it's one of the most important parts of our destiny fulfillment and that is because it's what makes it connected to you it's what connects you to your destiny it's calling somebody say calling to them he foreknew to them also he did predestinate to those who are predestinate he called the calling is when it becomes a reality in your personal life it's the Damascus call of your life it's when God reaches out to you and says hey I had a thought about you and I wrote a will with you in it and now I wanted you to know that for some of us it came as small children in Sunday school environment for others we had lived a majority of our life either in sin or religion and God had to find us where we were and wake us up that he had a purpose in our life and Grace to help us live out that purpose but it was the calling stage that made it personal to you how many of you have recognized that you were foreknown and your your your your plan his plan for your life was written down by predestination but how many of you have recognized that he has called you let me see your hand he's reached you he has found you he has identified himself with you and once that becomes a reality in your life it can change everything if you so desire because then you want to live in a constant place of yieldedness to his will and to his plan let's Stand Together someone asked my wife if there's been a update Beyond this update
