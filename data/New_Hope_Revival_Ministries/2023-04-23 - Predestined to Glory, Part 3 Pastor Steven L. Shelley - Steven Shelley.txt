[Music] I know we've had a lot of singing sing this I'm living now for Jesus I'm happy night and day because my sins are gone my soul is filled with music with all my heart I sing I know I know do you know that I exist I know my sister [Music] on the cross of calvary that's foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you really know that your sins are gone you ought to give him a high praise you ought to lift up your voice to the Lord [Applause] oh what a blessed people we are what a blessed people we are to know to know that our sins are gone we're not speculating we're not depending on the pope to tell us we're not depending on the denominational Elders to tell us the Holy Ghost is telling us the word of God has told us our sins are gone you may be seated just a moment you've been standing a long time the grace of God has brought us to real salvation it's only found in the precious blood and his righteousness the blood of Jesus Christ you can't dress good enough I believe in holiness I believe in it more today than any any day I mean I do when I'm around other people who don't understand anything about it or don't want to understand anything about it it makes me appreciate it more you people shine you shine even in a dark wedding when the lights are off and just just a few lights on in there you're shining because you've heard the word and you're not afraid to swim a little bit against the flow come on now I've been doing it all my life and some of you have too and uh here's the thing we don't always have reason circumstances to be happy and sing joyful songs we have sorrow we have grief we have troubles we have pains we have anxiety sometimes sickness to deal with depression come on lost loved ones bad economy I better hush now had my bad economy inflation they're fighting the the experts are fighting about whether this is fixing to spin into a recession all right we've been in inflation and now the ins and and and if it's recession will it be depression they're they're just but you know what if you don't have any other thing going for you if you know that your sins are gone Hallelujah you can know that with a sick body things aren't going well if you know your sins are gone you've got a reason to praise him you've got a reason to praise him I want to commend every one of you who made the extra effort to be there yesterday and stand with sister Anita and she certainly appreciates it greatly and that you really surprised me I knew that some of you would be there but I didn't know that so many of you would be there and it means a lot we we have to remember that her her journey has been a very painful Journey and I won't she's not here this morning but I wanna I wanna say this again one one more time maybe the last time but I want to say that uh I've never seen anybody serve their husband in his great illness any more than she did day and night night and day and believed she never wavered she she never doubt it she never spoke doubt she only spoke his healing and his and God healed him that's right God just healed him just not the way we wanted it we did not know the Christian family all that well we knew Regina from the home school uh program but we knew that so many of you knew them so many of you were involved with them through the homeschool co-ops and things and when the news came to us some few years ago that that Regina had uh covid and was going to go on a ventilator I will I I don't know why really why it struck me I think it was because of knowing you all knowing her and and I had some conversations with her even on the phone home school related and uh but I just wept and we all cried out to God her family cried out we prayed as a church and the Lord healed her he just didn't heal her the way that we wanted him to do it we wanted her to be here and so it was a special time yesterday and and we recognize that it will not be an easy walk that they have because they are a large family larger now than than like like Aaron one of the boys said it we're growing a speck and and I don't remember I I lost count of how many children they will have together uh is it hum do you remember 12. a dozen you know that's a lot a lot and and he's I don't know if it's uh I don't know if it's grandchildren and great-grandchildren or no maybe no great-grandchildren yeah because the oldest grandson stood up in the wedding and is in Bible school but I think they said there was almost 20 grandchildren you reckon anybody know the number 18. I don't remember the number exactly but that is a huge family and they're going to need the grace of the Lord because there's still a lot of grief there and uh there are younger ones that have come along that are very uh confused and needy and our prayers are going to remain with them but I am so thankful that so many of you were able to be there and and you you just you were just a bright light there was a a an apostle there they call him an apostle his name was Ballard and it was his father that the school itself was named after I think his father must have been passed on and you know what he said to me he said I love the standard that you people have he said my grandmother was a Holiness woman and we were heathen he said we didn't serve the Lord at all he said I was uh uh a police officer in either Opa-locka or Auburn lost without God and my grandmother held on to God and her prayers and her faithfulness to the word changed my whole family so he said I just want to respect and honor honor your church and your group and that makes me feel wonderful because you wonder sometime you you see people whispering you see people in the crowd you know Whispering a little bit there's him skirt women and and even a better lip reader and I see him sometime watching the women go by you know if you were to be in the crowd like that and interview those men those husbands and ask them their preference of how they would like for their wife to look did you know that a lot of those men would say just like them Godly women over there come on now because they respect that and uh so when you go and you're not embarrassed and you don't carry yourself awkwardly but you just go in and be who you are you're a bright light for Jesus Christ and we're it's it's important and I know there are people I don't want to make nobody mad here this morning but I know there are people who think that Holiness is optional but I'm not one of them I'm not one of them I'm like the old-timer used to say it's Holiness or hell I didn't get many amens but it's a truth anyhow the fact is I don't need your amen because I know it's the truth now I know there are different convictions and standards and things like that and I'm not talking about salvation laying in those things but I'm telling you if you're a part of the bride of Christ you're called to live differently than the world around you you're called you sisters are called to modesty you're not called to show your body to anybody but your husband the morning you men are called to have big enough riches too because the world has shifted and changing and it used to be you didn't have to say anything to men about modesty but we're living in such a confused hour now so confused out there that you even have to ask men to be modest oh you're not supposed to talk like that with visitors here what am I supposed to say I can't tell the truth I don't know what to tell I'll try to sing you a sweet song and make you feel better toward me I'm singing this for somebody I don't know who it is but God knows who it is I think so it used to be you've been in the storm it seems like forever [Music] your night of confusion has been awesome all so long your ship has lost anchors that old storms got you drifting [Music] but the night's almost over soar right out your storms [Music] God's right there with you [Music] oh you don't always feel here but your name alone [Music] is coming just hold on to Jesus he'll help you ride out your storms remember his promise he said I'll never forsake you do all the waters though the waters be raging [Music] they can do you know here's the key don't you give up the battle foreign for your answer is coming come on Church hold on just hold on to Jesus and you can ride out your storm let's stand and sing it together before we go to the word just ride out your storm you know God's right there they're always not about feelings oh you may not always [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the night just hold on Jesus he'll help you right out your storms just hold on to Jesus he'll help you ride out your storm if you believe that give him the praise give him praise [Music] thank you all thank you so much remain standing if you can if you're able if you're not you rest Romans chapter 5. now I said to sister Bethany last night they're traveling and if they have to slip out before this service is over you are not going to offend us I've been on the road and I know what it's like to have to travel but brother I'm so glad I don't believe I've got to meet you but I'm so glad that you're here with your boys your family your wife and I'm so glad that somehow you all have taught those young men to Worship the Lord I want you to know it got me in a good way when I saw those two young men worshiping the Lord and you get that because there's a mom and a Daddy who were worshiping the Lord we must don't get me started we must be the example we must be the example for our children we put labels on them we call them introverts and extroverts and we give them all kinds of confusing terms and and we say stupid excuse me we say stupid things to them like you know you're just like your mama you're quiet you're backward you're bashful you're awkward don't say things like that over your children don't even confess it over your own life lead them by example to the things of God because they're going to need it they're going to need him and so I commend you all I do I really do I honor you all thank you thank you for being willing to worship with us today Romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith now notice not by works not by uniform not by hairstyle by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access it's getting good we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand I have entered into Grace by the doorway of faith and I'm standing in Grace today does that sound too super spiritual to you I'm standing in Grace that's what the word said by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God that's that full change that's coming to our body so spirit is saved the soul is in the process of being saved that's mine will and emotions according to the Greek of the New Testament you are you are Body Soul and Spirit Spirit on the inside according to the scripture and so that soul is mine will and emotions that's where we struggle the soul has been redeemed by the blood of the lamb and the new life of Jesus Christ has regenerated that old soul it's brand new but that mind and will and emotion that struggle sometimes so it's in the process of full Redemption but what is being talked about here is a is that last Glory that last Glory that will change this body how many of you believe the body is going to be changed by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God I got to read and not comment and not only so but we glory in tribulations also I'm going to put my finger up here because I want to come in but I'm trying to read so you can sit down you we've got a glory we've got a glory in the hard times we got a praise in the hard times God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated we got to praise in the in the rough times if you come in here and you see somebody praising the Lord and you sit back there and say oh they must have an easy life or they couldn't act like that I want you to know that's never been the truth it's always appalling of Silence that Praises him it's always somebody that's been whipped and beaten knocked around slapped around talked about criticized condemned judged ostracized reject it come on they're the ones that have the highest praise they're sometimes the ones that have the loudest praise because they've understood the principle we don't wait for things to go good to give praise to God We Praise Him in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation is for a purpose it worketh patience I I advise you like the old-timers used to advise us I wouldn't pray for patience if I were you because they say that's praying for tribulation you don't have to pray for tribulation it's coming hardship is coming troubles trials are coming but through that if you learn the joy of praising God for who he is in spite of the storm in spite of the stripes and the bruises and the cuts you will understand that it's working patience in your life oh praise God let's go on and patience experience I I hear those uh I hear those and naysayers saying you know those those uh Full Gospel people Pentecostal people or sometimes message people they say that are always preaching about experience oh you you've got to have some experiences you've got to go through some things both in the negative create patience in us and you've also got to have some God encounters you remember folks God doesn't have any grandchildren you don't get in on Mama's Faith or Daddy's walk you must have your own born-again experience baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word filled with the walking talking Holy Ghost you must encounter God for yourself and experience coming through something getting to the other side of something and looking back over the hill all down through the valley where you've come it puts hope in you that if God has brought you thus far he will see you the rest of the way I'm persuaded that we can trust God to carry us all the way come on now I just love what I just love what what the psalmist said I was I was young once I'm an old man now I've seen some stuff I've been through some things but I've never seen the righteous whoo I've never seen the righteous forsaken I want you to say that I've never seen the righteous forsaken you won't ever see the righteous forsaken remembers sharing his righteousness that gives us any we wouldn't have any righteousness at all if he didn't share his with us one more form that gives you righteousness we don't do those things to get saved we don't do those things to stay saved we do those things because we have been saved and we want to shine his light to a lost and dark world around us so coming through some experiences both in the natural through hardship and and suffering and also in the positive through God encounters and experiences with the supernatural don't you ever lose hope and faith that God wants to give you something in the realm of the spirit in the Supernatural realm we are a supernatural people we were Supernatural before we were natural [Applause] we existed in the mind of God before we ever got into this body that's what the word said so we were Supernatural before we became natural and we really had to come down a long way to get in this natural body from being in the mind of God who'd want to come from the mind of God down into a natural body anyway but we had to because in him were the attributes of Redeemer and savior and heart regulator and deliverer and healer and he couldn't do any of that and express who he was had we not come here in a lost condition it is absolutely watch this it's absolutely his Delight it's absolutely the Lord's pleasure to bring you to him don't you love to eat when you're hungry some of us like to eat when we're not you there's just nothing like it you know brother Roger uh from the from the church up in LaGrange he he gets a lot of joy in cooking he looks a little stress sometime but he gets a little joy in cooking and and and and I love it I think he's a tremendous cook and a real servant and he come to the reception last night he walked behind and and he and well to be honest with you sister Anita had sent me a text and said you'll be real happy because brother Rogers doing the reception you'll stay I know you'll stay and eat eat with brother Roger so that's how she taught me into staying and he come by and he said it's better than usual brother Shelley I said well praise the Lord and he's always loading people up and sending them home more he gets a lot of pleasure in that and there are things you enjoy you enjoy some of you really enjoy gardening and some of you really enjoy watching the birds and you get joy out of working with your hands and being creative and and making balloon arches and and doing some of the things you people get pleasure from not just a job to you but I want you to know the Lord has pleasure the Lord has that sheer height in bringing you to himself oh he loves it and and I don't just mean once in Salvation I mean he just keeps wooing us hallelujah he just keeps into a closer relationship with him and every time you say yes every time you say yes Lord I will I'll draw closer I'll come closer I'll lay down some things that are hindrances oh my dear I'll straighten up some of my decision making Lord I'll come closer it just gives him so much pleasure and so much delight and God has been so good to give us so many beautiful things in our life doesn't it make you feel good when you think about being able to give him something back it got rebuked one time because I was always talking about blessing the Lord and one streamer many years ago wrote in and said I don't know what would make anybody thinking little peon-created creatures could bless the Lord and I said you clearly don't understand Redemption I just answered a little hostile you clearly don't understand even the psalmist talked to his own self and he said Soul mine will and emotions I want you to bless the Lord I want you to worship God when you praise him you bless him you bring him pleasure you bring him to light oh bless the Lord O my soul and all all that is within me he's been so good blessed His holy name so yes even you and I bring him blessing cause him to smile I love that we better read patience experience and experience hope next verse and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us you know you can't really fathom the love of God until you have the Holy Ghost and you know I preach it pretty rough I preach you're not fully born again until you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe that I believe it's that important I believe being baptized in the name of Jesus is that important I believe receiving the Holy Ghost is that important I don't believe the new birth is finished because in a natural birth there's water blood and in life that life that you get is when the Holy Ghost comes and so according to this scripture you can't fully fathom appreciate or understand the love of God until the Holy Ghost causes it to be shed abroad he causes it to be multiplied and Amplified and illuminated in your life and then you say oh the love of God all the love of God and here's what's beautiful the Holy Ghost never just makes truth Universal when you receive the Holy Ghost he makes truth personal and when that personal revelation of Truth strikes your heart nobody no preacher no Theologian no atheist no humanist no school teacher or college professor will ever be able to talk you out of the love of God because the Holy Ghost has caused it to be shed abroad in your heart let's read on I got a lot of verses to get to for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly don't you ever forget that they who are whole need not a physician it's those who are sick it's those who are broken and the Bible tells us that we were all born in sin in iniquity came into this world speaking lies I don't have to give you the example your parents you know what amazing children you have you know they're nearly perfect but they come here lying someone said well that's abusive you shouldn't say anything like that well it's the truth nobody has to do well he lies because his mama lied his daddy lied oh nobody had to lie in front of them they come with a fallen nature you you just they'll be standing there with a cookie in one hand crumbs on the chin pile of crumbs on the floor and chewing and you said to him did you take that cookie I told you you'd had enough cookies you didn't get another cookie did you no ma'am no ma'am come on who taught them that it's the scripture fulfilled they're shaping an iniquity formed in this kind of Fallen condition and come forth into this world speaking lies but Jesus came to find the ungodly to find the Fallen of Adam's race and to redeem them from the from the sin of the fall all the way back to the original thought that God had about you in the beginning when God thought about you in the beginning you were perfect you were holy you were righteous you were in His image you've been fighting your whole life to get back to what God thought about you in the beginning give in church keep on running this race don't you give up now I'm holding back here little for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet per adventure for a good man somewhat even Dare To Die but God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners he knew how rotten we were before we were ever born he knew our addictions you see I I'm I'm a few things I won't budge on one of them is sovereignty God is Sovereign and if you get a revelation of the sovereignty of God you don't ever have to say something like if if he would have had a better doctor he'd still be here if they were to give him that expensive medicine he'd still be alive that's not sovereignty talking that's not understand the standing the sovereignty of God now we make choices and there are repercussions for our choices but none of that changes the sovereignty of God you can have the lousiest doctor in the world in the dirtiest nastiest Hospital in the world taking the best medicine the world has ever given and close your eyes and die [Applause] because precious in the sight of the Lord waiting valuable in the sight of the Lord is the death of the Saints all of our days written in his book before we were even formed in our mother's womb and so your days are already numbered I don't want to upset you but you God's already got the last day your last day written and recorded for some of us it may be sooner than others but the truth is the reality is before we come here every day is already recorded in God's book you know so it don't matter about the doctor doesn't matter about the medicine no matter well if I if he'd just went don't you hear this one all the time if he'd just got it checked out sooner don't you think God could have done the prodding don't you think especially the righteous the children of God don't you believe a prophecy could have come a dream could have come don't you believe that God could have pushed that person toward doing something for themselves it always gets quiet when you preach sovereignty but I believe what the word said I believe God knows everything he doesn't always interfere but he has the power to interfere because he knew it before it ever happened I gotta hurry God commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us let's go on much more than being now Justified by his blood we shall be saved from Wrath through him now now why are we on this subject and I'm not done reading that but can we put up another verse even though I'm not through with those Romans 8 29 and 30 is where we are for these last few weeks for whom he did for eign you hear people around the church churches say I don't believe in predestination it don't matter what you believe you think that matters you think that changes God's word even brother Branham called it kind of a curse word in the church when you use the word predestinated I use it because the Bible said it but you must understand that predestination is always based on foreknowledge you had a choice God knew your choice before you ever made it but you had a choice and because he saw you making that choice he gave you a destiny that's what the word I'm just reading for whom he did for no he also did go ahead and say that ugly word predestinate to be conformed whoa I tell you my destiny Destiny is to be conformed to the image of his son it's like he [Applause] here win winner when our troubles and trials we'll soon be done with Temptations and tests will soon be done with all of the heartaches troubles and trials of life we're one day going to sit down with King Jesus Chic glad hands with the elders and tell my Kindred good morning scroll down Glory Boulevard with Isaiah Amaya and the prophets of old and our lifetime at the feet of King Jesus serving him and worshiping him come on down and when I leave this world of Sorrow you need to know this I'm leaving here just like him my destiny according to God's foreknowledge of me he pre-assigned he prefixed me a destiny and that Destiny is revealed in Scripture to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren you see Jesus passed the test uh sister Anna Hodges who's not here away for the wedding is she does most of our social media now and what I mean that I don't mean the moments that's Hawks department and the website RJ's Department but she does the memes and the and the graphics and the and the reels and they get a lot of traffic you just recently posted one she takes them from sermons even the memes are taken from sermons and sermon notes and scriptures and things that inspire and she mentioned in one of them yesterday or recently I miss them sometime and have to find them later she mentioned about laying down our rights that some of the things like unforgiveness I I don't remember exactly what he said could somebody find it for me you bring your phone to church with you just like it's your Bible so you might as well use it somebody find that for me would you find that for me I I don't want to I've got too many people greeting me here God bless every one of you in the Netherlands Indiana Canada Ontario Canada Kenya uh oh my so many so many here South Africa England some I don't Morocco in that wonderful Morocco and I don't I can't even see where some did anybody find it often pride is at the root of our unforgiveness anger bitterness now what did the before that not on the picture but the description what did the description say Pride tells us that we have the right to hold on to our unforgiveness our bitterness our anger the gospel tells us that we have given up every right as we choose to yield Our Lives to Christ and a precious friend of mine wrote on there where does the bible say that and I love my friend and she may be watching and I love her but there I started looking for I thought I can't it'd take me an hour and a half I can't just give one verse it would take me an hour and a half to tell you what the New Testament says about laying down your eyes but here is the summary let me give you the little little summary of it all Jesus is our example he gave up every ride he ever had he left the Splendor of Heaven the deity that was within him the kingdom The Authority the throne he left it all to condescene and he entered into this world and he laid down his rights to speak up for himself to defend himself LED like a sheep to the slaughter uh yeah the uttered not his word the accuser stood there and lied against him and he never said one time that is not the truth when they finally peeled him pinned him down all he could say was I am he he couldn't deny who he was and he 'd Eat to Live he gave up his right to be married [Music] to have children somebody said well that wouldn't be much of a privilege if you're God you forget who he was I know some people out there under this false impression that he was 50 God and 50 man but that's not what the word my word the Bible I read doesn't teach me that he was half God and half man somebody said what in the world was a hundred percent God and 100 man because if you're under the other delusion you probably think marriage is 50 50. [Music] help me preach somebody God is not 50 50. he's a hundred hundred he was a hundred percent God when he cried out come out of that grave Lazarus he was a hundred percent man when he slept in the bow of the boat he was a hundred percent God when he stepped up and spoke to peace be still it just kept turning over and over he was always God always man so he gave up the Bible said in fact then he was tempted and every manner like we are he was tempted by lust yet without sin he was our example in all things marriage is not 50 50. not a successful one it's a hundred one hundred some have never had a successful marriage because they've never been a hundred a hundred and a hundred it takes giving everything oh yes and if it took that in the 50s what do you think it takes 2020s well we could just change the math it takes 200 percent it's giving everything it's hard s our rights but as Christian we cannot hold on to our rights to be angry we gotta let it go is it oh you said it's easy no sir bitterness isn't is is hot [Music] you let a root of bitterness get in you and it'll become a tree and your it'll there'll be a tree sticking out of you bitterness don't stay in root form it takes on all kinds of form it grows it flourishes you've got to cut that thing at the root you can't cut the top of the tree a bitterness often expect it to die it'll come back again and again and again again you've got to let the word of God I'm preaching to somebody you've got to let the word of God go down there and lay the ax to the root of that thing and it's going to hurt coming out where you're preaching so hard yeah it's going to hurt coming out when God removes that root of bitterness out of your life it hurts coming out it's like it's worse than a surgery it's probably like giving birth that thing is pulling on everything you've had you've been holding on to that and you cannot we can't hold on to anger we can't hold on to unforgiveness we have to lay it down our example laid down all of his right somebody said I can't really believe that Jesus wanted to live and and the life he was living on Earth and and if he did uh then then I mean if he could not do that if if he didn't want to live is what I'm trying to say I'll get it in a minute some some people have a struggle believing that Jesus was giving up anything when he surrendered to the Cross but I want you to know because he was a hundred percent man he enjoyed the life that he was living here on Earth and he was willing to lay that down no greater love hath any man than this that he's willing to die willing to lay down his life for someone else for his friends not just his family the Bible said while we were yet sinners while we were ungodly way before we deserved him but here's how I know that he didn't want to change his presidency state because of what he prayed in the garden he prayed it in the garden the the spirit is willing the god part of who I am is willing but the man part of who I am is weak and he's struggling under the law if at all possible if there's any other way he wasn't given up on us he said if there's any other way let this cup pass from me but the old-timers used to tell me the sweetest words ever spoken nevertheless not my will but your will be done he struggled in that agonizing prayer until great spots of blood begin to pour through the sweat that give away and drops of blood uh the the the very organs of his body were already rupturing before he ever went to the cross there's a possibility that that the the the the the fluid around his heart was already leaking through because of the agony and the stress it's per it's perhaps in that moment of great Agony blood vessels were bursting in his body already under the agony of what was coming the Mind battle you talk about mind battles he had them too all manner he had them too and and look at his Inner Circle are you in me what were they doing sleeping sometime here on Sunday morning I get in that mood I feel it I feel it I just want to look at some of you I really want to throw a song back at you and I want to say won't you Tarry when it's already our two usually by then what's your Taryn body was rat with pain and yet he said nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he laid down everything and we're going to have to lay it down to be conformed to the image of his son for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren there's some more coming I'm one of them that's coming he was the firstborn of a righteous fully adopted son Hallelujah but there's coming a generation oh yes oh yes give me the next verse excuse me just a moment more moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also Justified remember how they used to say just if I'd never sinned that's not covering sin the blood of bulls and goats and Lambs covered sin in the mind of God it was the plan of God for a season but his blood did more than cover your sin his blood so far removed your sin from you Hallelujah that it was remitted forevermore and whom he justified read it read the rest then we also glorified go back to Romans 5 for me charity and I'm I'm going to hurry you all know my hurry is not like everybody else's hurry I'll be 55 next Friday my hurry my hurry is not like you know young people's hurry he and you and Carter know how to hurry I don't know sometimes I'll look at you and you Lumber you notice children lumbering these days don't get upset with me parents when I was their age I hurried when an adult called me I was there come on now you boys are wonderful boys I love you both and I admire you both foreign just keep in mind that my hurry may not be like everybody else's but I'm hurrying right now give me verse uh verse 8 again verse 9 excuse me verse 9. more more much more than being now justified by his blood just if I'd never sinned we shall be saved from Wrath through him there's a new trend in charismatic Christianity I don't know how much is spilling over into the Pentecostal world I lose track of those camps sometime but there's a new trend among the charismatic world that they're preaching that the the the bride or the church will will go through the tribulation and and I want you to know they're right there is a church there is a church it will I remember I'm not talking about building now don't you think I'm talking about a building there is a church that doesn't have the whole truth and the Bible said they're going through the tribulation to cleanse the spots on their garments that's what the Bible said amen so those that don't have the godhead like the scripture has it and the baptism like the scripture has it many of them are going to miss the rapture that's what the Bible teaches they're going to prove their love for Christ in the tribulation the Bible said laying their head on a chopping block somebody said the holy spirit will give them the strength excuse me for my voice they said the Holy Ghost the holy spirit will give them strength to do that not so because the Holy Spirit leaves planet Earth when the bride Church leaves Holy Ghost goes wither somebody said how do you know because the scripture said so but now let it will land until he be taken out of the way referring to the Holy Spirit that's the restrainer did you know that if it were not for the presence of the holy spirit in the Earth today the whole world around us would be totally insane I could have said that to some folks 10 years ago they wouldn't have grasped it but in 2023 people can grasp that a little bit easier because they see the insanity around them I watched a discussion online this week concerning gender dysphoria and confusion and I saw a little woman standing up an educator and not a conservative by any means but standing up for her uh thoughts and opinions on waiting before presenting this kind of information to children because there was a panel there that wanted children to be presented with the idea of gender dysphoria at age four I'd like to know I want you to know I'm not going to call any names but I want you to know there are some girls around here that look like ladies this morning that were kind of tomboyish when they were girls they took their skirts in climbed a tree aren't you glad somebody didn't sit them down at four I hope you'll help me aren't you glad somebody didn't sit him down in four and say now you know you may not really be a girl [Music] that is what they want to do and they're no no no it's what they're doing in public schools and here was this lone educator that said at least at least wait until they're 12 years old they laughed at her they laughed at her they made fun of her she was an expert in her field not a conservative not a born-again Christian she said at least just before puberty I I could I could allow something like that but please don't fight and they vowed to her we're going to keep fighting we're going to fight until every four-year-old is presented where the unicorn toy that has both parts we're gonna keep fighting until this curriculum is brought to all the schools preschool and if there's not a preschool program kindergarten five-year-old and we're going to show this little dog and we're going to explain to the children that sometimes a lady told Stacey and I a Godly Holy Ghost Phil Pentecostal woman from another state told us Friday night that she recently met someone that she hadn't seen since her childhood and got a hurry to tell this but she said to him what you're a boy are you a boy or a girl he said I'm a boy she said uh she said I I hadn't seen him in so many years and she said I'm remembering that when we were all in church together my nephew used to make fun of this person because they said that was one of the ugliest little girls they had ever seen in the dress she said we got on to our children our nephew don't you say that about her and come to find out he began to tell his story his mother in the church of God in Christ in the church wanted a little girl so it didn't matter his Plumbing it's quiet in here they dressed him in a skirt and told him he was a girl and for years he went through the shame of being the ugliest girl in the class and the ugliest girl in the church because he wasn't born to be a girl he was born to be a boy and he said when he got out from under that and you know what her question was she said what about the preacher what about the pastor in that church what about those that knew what kind of child that woman had given birth to did they just turn their head that's what they do and watch them dress him up in a skirt folks we're living in perilous times the church cannot compromise we must not compromise this generation must know the word we must not budge from it no matter what so much confusion out there so much and let me tell you something it would be totally insane if the bride church was gone because the Holy Ghost is leaving with her the Bible said some are not appointed unto wrath I want you to know I am one of those I'm one of those not opponent that around doesn't mean I'm not going to have some hardship doesn't mean there won't be perilous times troubles and trials but what it means is you're not going to live the Bride of Jesus Christ is not going to live through the darkest part of that tribulation he's coming the bridegroom is coming to take his bride the scripture even says here we shall be saved from Wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life I I don't mean to offend anybody who has family that struggles or has a loved one who who's confused but I will be honest with you and tell you that sometimes the confusion can end if a demon is cast out but the the society and the psychiatrist has scared parents into thinking that if you if you make them mad they get worse well sometimes there has to be a little provoking to get them in the right atmosphere where the demon can be cast out because I want you to know something the the regret one of the experts in this discussion that I was watching one of the experts says there are hundreds of thousands of testimonies now I have no idea I didn't search it I don't intend to search it there are hundreds of thousands of testimonies online from people that have made the full transition and who have been suicidal who have become addicts who have so regretted some have marched back to the doctor some have killed the doctor can you imagine some have gone back to reap Vengeance on the teachers and counselors and family members who push them into that direction so I want you to know we pray we pray I do pray I have I have compassion for someone who's Fallen under the confusion of this age but this bride's got to stay clear of that and we have to make a stand we have to make a stand we've got to make it fast we have to be careful who our children are with I know that sound I know I know I know there's somebody out there disconnecting the stream go ahead God bless you goodbye come see us again when I'm on a nicer subject but it's the truth these things are these Spirits somebody said well that's not contagious no but Spirits are just a minute amen pastor I just had some time help myself for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life oh that's good news let's come back to the good news and not only so and I I'm I'm moving now and not only so but we also Joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement wherefore is by one man sinner sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed where there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come even before willful sin became a part of your life you by by the Fallen race of Adam you already had transgression you already had a need of a redeemer amen let's go on verse 15 but not is the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ Christ hath abounded unto unto many a few more verses and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification put them all in there they're covered I'm not leaving here today planning on sinning I'm not I'm not making any any way I I'm not making any plan to go do those things because I pray that I've pushed unbelief out of my life because unbelief is what pushes us to those kind of behaviors and activities anyway we preach that sin is really unbelief and all these other things are the attributes of unbelief I'm not planning to do that but I want you to know that if I Should Fall by the way because many have I want you to know that if I should lose my way those sins that unbelief is also covered boy you Pentecostals don't get very loud about that do they you better hope it's true because there's people sitting in this room today that are on try three or try four started out to serve the Lord ended up serving self came back to God went out and served self some more came back and served God God saw that are you saying there's no hope of course I'm not saying such a thing you've been welcomed into the family of God because you always were a part of him you talk about confusion you were the one confused it wasn't gender confusion it was it was spiritual amnesia you forgot who you were and you came back and I want you to know may you never may you never stray again no you never fall by the wayside again God hope holds you and keep you because the hour is getting dark but if you should and you're a part of him there's a father standing With Arms Wide Open that says you are mine I will never leave you I will never forsake you how many of you are glad there's a way back whoa I sat out there on the platform brother may be listening today and if he is my heart and my prayers are with you both today I know is a very sad anniversary and I've already sent you a note to let you know I was thinking about you but I sat out there on the platform in Tucson at uh Harmony there was a beautiful young lady one that I care about who was singing a beautiful song about being home or coming back home or being back being back where you belong and something so moved me I knew she wasn't serving the lord to the best of her ability it was obvious but there was something that moved over me as she sung that song she sat down I took her by the hand and I said it's never too late there's no place like home I want you to look at your neighbor and tell him right now there's no place like home come back to Papa let's let's Don't Preach it let's Don't Preach it in such a way that people miss the idea that if they fall they're they're they're they're you know hopeless let's preach it in such a way that people will know he's always willing he is not willing that any should perish but that all should come but don't do like brother Josh's song Don't Waste Your Grace take advantage take advantage of your grace today let's let's go on did I read this verse yet let's go on to the next verse if we can we have a few more 17. for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore by as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one free the free gift came upon all men unto what there it is again foreknown predestinated called Justified glorified I read it I've been reading at every service Romans 8 29 and 30. it's five steps to full Redemption you must have been foreknown you must have been predestinated you had to have been called the calling is what makes it personal the justification is what he does on our behalf and the glorification is what brings us into the image of his son he's got this I want you to know folks as we come to a close I want you to know he's got this he knows how to bring his children all the way verse 19 I haven't I haven't I'm just reading my text I haven't preached my sermon but I'm stopping soon I haven't gone to One Note for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one you better hear this shall many be made righteous and you don't get to choose who is and who is not [Applause] we can't let our prejudices or our grudges determine who God covers and fills with his righteousness who hates all the children hits all the dogs with a broom don't even want anybody stopping in front of her house you don't get to choose whether she has the righteousness of Christ imparted to her she's the one you ought to reach she's the one you ought to pray for because she's very miserable people are behaving out of their own misery you know you if it were up to us all right now let's make it personal some of us were mistreated in our life failed by parents failed by spouses let me tell you something what you're looking at we've got a lot of people missing this morning but what you're looking at here is a body of real people broken people some have come from broken marriages some have come from great addictions some have testified and used words I don't even like to use referring to people but they've done it they've just been honest and open about where they come from it's all the goodness of God it's all his grace if we were all born holy we wouldn't have needed a savior but we were born in trouble and already needed a savior when we got here come on now it's his righteousness it's his righteousness that makes us anything at all and so in this room there are people who have not had pristine lives [Music] some have had abusive husbands abusive wives some have had abusive parents I don't want to hurt you I don't want to bring anything up some have had family members commit suicide some have had it right in their home some have been emotionally abused some have been physically abused some have been sexually abused and it's hard sometimes to place that person in a position where they could receive the grace of God but we must we maybe you may be the only hope I don't mean you have to put your yourself in their life listen prayer is a very powerful too I'm not telling you you have to go make amends with your abuser no sir I'm not telling you that you have to go and reach out to your abuser and and give them the gospel but I'll tell you what you can do you can pray Lord you send somebody because the heart of a True Believer we don't want anybody to perish I don't care how Wicked they've been I'm just so glad you can't put me in hell even if you don't like me somebody said why don't we see the the spoken word of God manifested any more than we do why don't we see it like we believe it is to come I'll tell you why because we haven't come to that perfect love yet and we would use the word of God we would try to use that spoken word Authority in an abusive way it's not here to put a ward on your enemy's nose it's not here to call somebody you're mad at to fall you dig a pit for your brother you fall in it yourself come on it's here for other higher purposes than that it's not here to express your unforgiveness one of these days we're coming all the way up into that stature of the perfect man we're going to learn what it means to not only have his godliness in our life but we're going to know what it means to operate in his perfect love and when we do we're trustworthy then we become trustworthy musicians are coming to be used in whatever way God would see fit to use our lives so many are made righteous by The Obedience of one man two more verses isn't it moreover the law entered that the offense might abound you got to hear that I can't brush over that because some of the messianics deny the verse when you try to teach that the law was put in place to reveal man's inability to walk in righteousness there are messianics that get very mad but I didn't say it Jesus said it the reason why the law was so stringent is because God knew from the beginning that man would not be able to constantly keep he knew there would be no Temple for one thing he knew there would be a time that the red heifer could not be offered he knew there'd be a time that these things could not take place he knew that over 600 Commandments nobody would be able to completely walk in every one of those he did that so that sin would abound and so that man would be able to see his need of more than a covering Justified moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded guess what can I get you to read it again read that one more time but when where sin abounded Grace Hallelujah even in a world like ours where sin is about Grace is much more abounding grace is still predominant thanks be to God last verse that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so my grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord now I want to read you one quotation this morning in closing this is from the message and absolute paragraph 120. and again I want to mention this I don't want to offend anybody in the room or streaming because I'm quoting brother Branham you you can you can you can look at it anyway you don't have to listen but just to understand this that you you you hear Chuck Swindoll Spurgeon rice Stanley who just passed away Tozer quoted all the time so there shouldn't be anybody that takes such great offense in me I'm not trying to make him any more than a prophet that's what he was with a very special place in my life I don't know I really really couldn't thank God enough for letting me hear this word in the message and absolutes Shreveport Louisiana 1963 paragraph 120 he's quoting Romans 8 1 now therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ we find out I believe that's Romans 5 we find out is our justification what is our Justice Jesus who is our Jesus he is our justification God raised him up on the third day to justify our faith that we believe it because that faith became the door that we walked through so that we can stand in Grace now I want you to know something you don't you don't run in and out of the door of faith and you don't run in and out of Grace if you leave the truth if you leave the life that you are called to live here's what you need to know I don't want to encourage anybody to go away from God I want to encourage you to come home but let me tell you something you don't leave Grace here Grace will go with you he'll follow you Grace will follow you let's let's make her a she She'll follow you of course brother Brandon preaching away on Grace he said do you know Grace her name is Amazing Grace so I'll just call her a woman today Grace will follow you some of you are Mighty glad she will it won't never taste the same when Grace is following you the high won't never be as high the drunk won't never be the same your time with your head in the toilet will be more I hope but Grace will be covering you Grace will chase you down come on you hear sister Megan I just happen to hear her voice put up your hand Megan she said that is the truth because she was one of those who ran from Grace an addict a ruined life and Grace just kept chasing her yeah I know people that have it pretty easy and won't serve the Lord and then you hear a testimony like hers the grace of God should be dead by the world standards more than once multiple times kept following after her and Grace kept wooing her grace kept chasing her Peter the same way April's husband Peter who went to be with the Lord many years ago now Grace chased him he thought he could get out from under my preaching he could have peace hey I'm giving you his he told me this he said but you are always in my ear that wasn't me it sounded like me that was Grace he said I could see you puning your fingers I said that one my finger that was Grace oh somebody ought to praise him [Applause] somebody ought to praise him Hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] let me read the rest of this you can be seated or stand I don't care what you do you do whichever you need to do but I'm going to finish reading this quickly here's our justification God raised him upon the Third their faith that we believe it and he raised him up to justify our faith what did he do then he sent him back the justifier because our faith believes that the Holy Spirit Christ come into it for our justification because we have raised from Death unto life you can't find any fault in that I don't care who said it and now we are Sons and Daughters of God sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus divide Us by what that give us justification to know with the earnest of our Salvation within us now the very Life of Christ pulsating in US how then could we deny the word did you hear the song how could I deny any of the truth and how then could we deny the word which he is the word that gives us this assurance the holy spirit is there what is it it's still the North Star Christ is that North Star and the Holy Spirit is that justification that points the believer right straight to the North Star right the Holy Ghost will always point to the word [Music] you don't have to be afraid of the Holy Ghost he'll always take you to the word if it points to a Creed or a denomination it's not the Holy Ghost he couldn't do that pulling away from his word when he died to confirm that word and make that word a positive amen he died so he could come himself into that word he is the quickening life that makes that word live again my God appraise him a minute gotta praise him a minute Hallelujah that was his purpose of dying that he could still project himself through his church and make every word through every Age act just exactly the way it's supposed to act powerful he is the Dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church was it what is it Apostles prophets teachers he is the dust that works that and it's worked by a certain Dynamic which is which is like he is the fire that fires off the gas he is the fire that's in the combustion chamber when the gas the word is poured over that combustion chamber he is the one that sets her a fire he is the one that confirms it he is the power of the Resurrection he is God he is the fire that's what he is how many of you believe you're justified by the Resurrection Life of Jesus Christ let's stand and worship him come on let's worship Him you've got something to worship him if you're Justified if you've been foreknown predestinated called and Justified you've got something to praise him for let's come Praise Him Hallelujah if you need to slip out you can when you need to but we're going to praise him for a while it's early it may not be for some folks but it is for us let's Praise Him let's thank him oh thank you Lord thank you the grace chased us down yeah come on Hallelujah then Jesus blood and righteousness I dare not trust the sweetest friend yes yes yes yes yes but holy trust in Jesus name oh yes my hope is built on nothing left more than Jesus blood and righteousness [Music] but holy

straws in the savior's life [Music] oh In Christ Alone [Music] [Music] would you just keep your hands up for just a moment I want to just pray over the body right now everyone that's here and we're taught in the Old Testament that when a prayer or blessing was pronounced the way to receive that was to put up a hand or both hands and when it's finished to say Amen it means so be it I receive that into my life so I'm not trying to be formal but I just felt to ask you to do that father in the name of Jesus Christ these are your people all over this room from the front to the back these are yours they belong to you they're not mine they're not any preachers they don't belong to any building they belong to you and you see their needs you know that's that that is on the surface and you know that that is in the deepest part of who they are in the deepest recesses of their mind and of their soul you know that deep need and I'm asking you oh how do you say whoa I'm asking you to do for them Lord what they cannot do for themselves for what I couldn't do for them you can in a moment's time it doesn't have to be an hour in your present just one moment in your presence healing takes place confused Minds can find peace Lord I pray that a new determination will fall on this people right now to serve you with every fiber of their being would you sever any cords that this world has laid on them would you break every feather and every chain that this world has used to hold them in any way even the mindset I pray right now against mindsets that are anti-word like fear like anxiety like unforgiveness I pray against those mindsets right now in the authority of Jesus Christ fill us as your children fill us now the Lord is talking to me just in this moment about someone who is feeling very very unsettled in your in your in your inner man and you have for some time now just unsettled just unsettled not not quite satisfied not sure where to put your hand on it not sure exactly what to do about it in fact you're a little bit afraid to even think about what might be required to settle that that feeling of of it's really a hunger it's really a deep hunger at the noise of thy water spouts the Deep calls to the deep and and I want the Lord to help you this morning because you're on my heart I feel like the Lord has pointed a few of you out to me in my mind right now and I'm just going to pray for you from here for the moment that the Lord would would settle you that he would give you a peace that you would know exactly what he would have you to do that you would have the courage to do it I I feel like saying that for some it's your security you you you have grown accustomed to your security uh maybe it's a job maybe it's a a familiar place and the Lord is trying to squeeze you out of that in some way pull you closer to him and your human nature just like mine wants to hold on to the familiar and wants to hold on to the things that give us some sense of security and belonging and peace but I believe the Lord is going to see you through I'm going to pray again right now that may not be for everyone of you that are feeding that but at least one of you the Lord is speaking to your heart right now I pray he will confirm to you that he is talking to you through those word father in the name of Jesus every one of us have been in a similar Place some of us multiple times where with everything we have in the natural we're holding on and yet something higher is calling us higher something in you is calling us to a higher Play We Sing a Song sometime Zion is calling me to a higher place and Lord we have experienced that and we've learned the hard way the best thing to do is to yield woo the best thing to do is to yield to that so I pray for grace right now to every person in this room to yield to that to yield to the grace of God the courage to make good decisions the Courage the courage to move forward into what you have for them in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus May the fear leave and May the peace come and take that place right now you may not all come in a scroll of instruction but I pray that the leadership of the holy spirit

roundabout I just saw you I don't know if you're an alabamian or not but you'd make a good one because they don't know how to use roundabouts but I saw you just circling just circling not knowing where to get off and and that's all like like others coming in and filling up the roundabout spiritually but you're just still going around in circles just going around in circles smiling the whole time just kind of pretending like it's all right and that that's normal and that's what you're supposed to do no no no that's not there for you to keep going in circles but no Direction no leadership no no no may God point out right now may he point out for you your way out of that roundabout may God show you the way out Hallelujah I used to say it call it a gerbil wheel but the Lord let me see at that time in the spirit like a roundabout just going around and around and around and around Lord point the way out for whoever needs that pinpoint reveal speak when we were singing about the goodness of God that verse says I love your voice [Laughter] I love your voice when you speak to us it's the sweetest voice there's nothing like hearing your voice I pray for my brother sister may they hear your voice may they get out of that roundabout may they have Direction in leadership to follow you and to go in the way that you've called them to go uttata through the storm through it all your Lord

Hawk and Chad touch one another you just find somebody even as uh shoshana standing there with sister Jada and you in the sound booth I just want you to ask God for strength for the one you're touching strength strength the Lord strength strength to make a commitment if that's what's needed streak to find the born-again experience if that's what's needed strength to make the right choice if that's what's needed strength to serve the Lord with greater determination if that's what's needed physical strength if that's the need heal injuries [Music] heal joints heal muscle strains tears if it's healing physically let it come to my brother let it come to my sister you sense your word and healed us [Music] it's emotional strength nobody likes to say that but sometimes times we just get mentally exhausted and our emotions follow in a crash strengthen my brother strengthen my sister may they not be led by their emotions may they be led by the word may they not make decisions based on emotions may they may come by the leadership of the Holy Spirit if they feel trapped in anything to be free strength I speak strength I speak strength I speak strength drink to you strength to you
