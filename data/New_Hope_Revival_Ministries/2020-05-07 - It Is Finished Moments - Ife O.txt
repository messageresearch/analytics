TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you've got to get your eyes above all the whispers that may be going on about your life I want you to know our God has all power and he has all authority and there is nothing not even cancer can stand against the price that he paid in the atonement he finished the work and he did a glorious job and he's still alive today and he still has power to save and heal and to deliver and he's still giving to a people authority and power to bind up a strongman to lay some chains on him and remind him you are ultimately defeated not because a bride has risen up you were defeated before you ever got started how many of you believe God saw the devil's ultimate defeat before he ever existed that's the sovereignty of our God and you hear people say when the enemy comes around and reminds you of your past you remind him of his future that's not just a cute little phrase that works well on social media it is a reality he is defeated he's going to tumble for a thousand years in a bottomless pit he's going to have a short reprieve out of that pit according to the word and then he's going to be ultimately banished to a lake of fire never to be able to bother the children of the Most High again never to be able to afflict to make sick to trouble to torment to oppress or to possess ever again and why do we know this because the word said so and what gave us that power I'd hope that we can grab ahold of that it is finished it is a done deal it is a finished work why brother Shelly don't we see more results and why don't we see more evidence that the enemy is defeated it's because we are failing to appropriate what is in our life but the biggest reason we have this morning is we listen to his accusation we listen to his lie and we must believe it because we lay down like dogs when he starts howling I want you to know when the enemy's nipping at your heel that is not the time to lay down and get fleas with him that's the time to stand up and say wait a minute wait a minute your authority is limited it's limited by the allowance of a living God and it's limited by the permission of the sons of God the enemy with everything he has he is determined to pull you out of God's endtime economy he is that's exactly what he want you to he cannot change your election he cannot change your predestination he cannot change your justification he cannot come on but I'll tell you what he can do he can move you out of the place of authority and understanding the power he can Mosul you like an ox he can arrest you in a rat until you realize this is his trick he I'll tell you what he's not gonna pull a atomic bomb and drop it on your house he doesn't have to do that to get control over you all he has to do is lie to your mind he just has to tell you a big old fat juicy law and we just fall right under his spell you've got to get your eyes above all the whispers that may be going on about your life you've got to know and be confident that God hears the prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman availeth much and it's not your righteousness it's not my righteousness that causes my petition to ascend above through the second heaven into the throne room of the Most High God
