Description:
What kind of life would we have if we could not believe that God was bigger than our natural circumstances? In the natural sometimes it looks like there is no hope, that there is no solution for your problem, but one moment looking above the natural with the gift of faith will change your perspective. We have to live knowing that there is a reality of a spiritual realm that is bigger than the negative we are currently facing. It is very important when we feel the heaviness of the atmosphere that we are living in that we use our faith weapon to pull ourself out of this atmosphere into a higher realm. God is not going to be our lucky charm. He is looking for a relationship with you & I. That comes by the hearing and the doing of the Word. Every time we receive a revelation of truth, a little more of that supernatural realm comes to live inside of us.

quotes:
    - There is no joy like knowing you are doing His will. 
    - If you will take a step of ordinary faith, when you come to the end of that faith, very often supernatural faith will take over. (Smith Wigglesworth)
    - Sometimes the ​delay can be a part of God’s plan because he is teaching us to look into that other realm.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus received a change of clothes delayed aside but laureate shared with the father it's at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ it's your faith that has been tried by the fire would be worthy of the well done he chooses to see what he saw about me that's mercy my love his grace take your place and take it now your family is at stake it's never too late for a man of integrity to go before God on behalf of his children [Music] [Music] well this verse of scripture some of you could quote for though we walk in the flesh this is 2nd Corinthians 10 verses three through five for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh there's a warfare going on that is bigger than our flesh it's bigger than who we are as individuals a man for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal they are not natural somebody say natural that they're just not natural but they are mighty through God our weapons are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and we understand what those strongholds can be and they vary in different individuals lives casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every fault how many thoughts every thought that's a lot of work how many of you have a lot of thoughts every day it's a lot of work but the Bible said we have to bring every one of those thoughts to obedience we bring them into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ it's a powerful job but it's a gift to us to be able to do that let me read one more portion to you in Hebrews chapter 11 if you turn there and we're going to read again these are verses you could quote Hebrews 11:1 and 2 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things huh not seen if you can see it it doesn't require faith to touch it you just reach out and touch it but if you can't see it if it exists but not in this realm of the seen se e in the realm of the carnal the realm of the natural the realm of the flesh but you know it's there because God's Word said so so you don't access it with your eyes you don't access it with your hands you access it with your faith and without faith what does the scripture say without faith it is impossible to please God we've got faith every one of us have faith it's given to us as a gift but we've got to learn to exercise it amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning that you are alive and well in our lives we thank you this morning that you are God's sovereign and you are God's supreme and besides you there is no other God we thank you for your presence that has been here this morning as we worshipped you and we sang of your holiness and your worthiness and there was an atmosphere that began to crowd in on us as we were worshiping you Lord and and may we just say it's worth the effort it's it's worth a little using our voice and the little lifting of our hand and a little bit of of pushing through some stuff to be able to create an atmosphere where your presence can land as Hawk was praying this morning and so Lord we're thankful we're thankful for what you've done on our behalf we sung about that ugly cross the ugly death on the cross but it was the most beautiful thing that's ever been done for another human being you did it for us because you and now Lord we need your word because it's life to us it is strength to us and it is a part of our unseen arsenal those weapons of warfare that are not carnal but rather spiritual and so we need that word to speak to us today and it is anointed already to do so give us ears to hear and may you anoint the gift Lord that your word might go forth in power and that it might scatter the darkness and will give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said Amen you may be seated this morning I love something well several things I I know I'm supposed to be praying but I was but I was also listening to Hawks prayer and several of the things he said inspired me and one of the things that he said that was somewhat confirmation to me is he mentioned the fact that our God is a super natural God would you say that with me right now our God is a super natural God don't try to make him natural don't try to make him natural and don't try to make him like any other God you've ever heard of because all the gods of Mythology are myths they don't exist and they never did exist they were formed and created for man to try to explain what God had created and so they made deities out of God's creation and I want you to know that science is not evil but science can be wrong you know our science can be wrong because it is based on man's experimentation and reading the results of his experiment and you build upon the next and you build upon the next and you build upon the next and that's why we have science today saying something entirely different about many things then it said 10 years ago and it wasn't just building on something but we find out that actually it replaced something and we've talked about neuroplasticity we've talked about the brain's ability to rewire and recreate itself and just a few years ago science said that you're you live and die with the brain you were born with but now science a knows better and they know that we have the ability through our thoughts and through healthy habits to rewire our brain and to even we now know that we can even see new healthy brain cells created in our brain and these are things that were mocked twenty years ago made fun of so science is evolving because it's based on the experimentation of the past it's man's desire to understand something bigger than he is and so science is not evil but it can be wrong because it is based on the natural realm how many of you know there's another realm there's another reality this morning and it is that God who is a super natural God our God is a supernatural God we fail so many times in trying to explain him to someone else because all we have to do that with is natural language and how many of you know that natural language flesh language often Falls very very short of really expressing who God is because he's supernatural now how many of you know what supernatural means well in its very basic definition it means to go above and beyond the natural if something goes above and beyond what can be accomplished or understood in the natural it is considered super natural and there is a supernatural realm and it's not very far from any of us this morning if you believe that same n it's a parallel dimension oh that sounds kind of weird doesn't it but but what that means is is in this room it is possible to move in the natural realm and also see the unseen realm the spiritual realm the supernatural realm at the same time in fact you can be standing beside someone who is using their five senses to touch their natural realm and you may have someone on the other side of you who is using their faith at that same moment and they're touching an entirely different reality so many times in our life just stay with me through this foundation even though it's 101 for Holy Ghost fill Christians so many times in our Christian life we learn we hear about that supernatural realm and we know the access is granted to us but we continue to read our environment and to read our circumstances by what we see with natural eyes how many of you know you'll come up short I'm telling you life will disappoint you have you ever been disappointed by life there are many things that happen in the natural stay here many things that happen in the natural realm that will disappoint us and our emotions will most likely reflect what's going on in the natural realm but God is not a natural God God is a super natural God he is above and beyond all that we can understand with the natural mind the natural mind will never comprehend the fullness of the sovereignty and greatness of God but God gives you another sense he gives us another sense faith is the sixth sense faith is the sixth sense really it's an entirely different set of senses it's a spiritual sense it's a gift that God gives you to access and touch the reality of the supernatural your five senses give you the ability to touch your natural environment faith gives you the ability to touch a supernatural environment you serve a supernatural God we're just gonna move slow here in just a moment and that supernatural God has made a way to get from heaven I can hear the old song that they used to sing when I was a boy he came a long long way from heaven he did he came a long long way from heaven and he provided a way to put a portion of that supernatural God and his supernatural life in your mortal body think about that eternal life is God's life it's zowie life in the Greek I think someone was preaching here recently and since it was it was a hawk and said something about Zoe what a good name she has because it's a Greek word for this other kind of life eternal life God life and whether we feel it or whether we can grasp it or whether we can explain it if you're born again of the Spirit of God that supernatural life that eternal life that Jesus Christ life is living inside of you and if he's not living inside of you it's very simple believe on the Lord Jesus Christ confess with your mouth that you're a sinner and you need to be saved and be baptized in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the massive acts 2:38 is you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's a powerful promise and what that gift of the Holy Ghost is it's a transfer it's a deposit of God's eternal supernatural life in you so when you're walking around you're living a natural life but you're not existing by natural life you are existing by supernatural life hmm one day your natural life is going to end and if you're born again of the Spirit of God that part of you that cannot die did you know that the human soul and spirit that has been transformed and renewed by the eternal life of Jesus Christ cannot die that soul can never die that spirit of course can never die that's what keeps the soul alive the spirit can never die but the Bible says the soul that sinneth shall surely die that's pretty serious isn't it so there is no eternal life anywhere else not even in hell I believe in Hell I believe in a literal hell I believe in a burning hell but I don't believe in an eternal hell pretty heavy huh because in order to have an eternal hell you'd have to have an eternal life to live and be tormented eternally in that hell and we don't know how long that exists but we know that one day the soul that sinneth shall cease to exist but the soul that has been reborn by the Spirit of Jesus Christ will never die we used to sing decadence land I'm on my way we're the soul of man shall never die that may not matter to you now but it'll matter to you over there come on now as soon as this life is over your it's gonna matter to you whether you have eternal life or not loving God would never send sold the hell you're exactly right but in God's design people die every day and go to hell because they're not born again and how is that it's by a choice they made a choice you've made a choice here this morning you chose to be here you chose which tie to wear or what shoes to put on you you girls and sisters decided what how you were gonna do your hair up or down or bow dried or curled or primped or or straining my goodness no wonder you're late you got a lot to do to look like you look a man I could say some of you didn't take enough time but that'd be terrible that'd be an insulting joke you look beautiful I'm gonna be like sister Flo this morning you look beautiful this morning and you do you do you do look beautiful because you made a decision to come to be in the presence of the Lord one day you made a decision to be born again and in that decision you decided that you were going to be forever connected to a supernatural God and to a supernatural reality and a supernatural realm that is so contrary at times to the realm we live in right now in the natural in the natural sometimes it looks like there is no hope nothing will ever make a difference I will always feel like I feel right now there will never be a solution for this problem that I have I could go on and on and on and on and on we see those kinds of problems around us in our own lives things that we just feel like we'll never be any different but I want you to know one moment poking your head up above the natural and choosing to see to access the supernatural with the gift of faith the sixth sense to choose to say wait a minute it looks like in the natural it sounds like in the natural it feels like in the natural that nothing will ever change but it will always be as dark as it is right now or I'll hurt like a hurt right now or my family will be a mess like they are right now or my baby will never sleep through the night come on Emily better get in there you better start accessing that supernatural realm we've just come from brother Darrin and sister Rebecca who are younger than we are but have already raised a family and now are starting over with this foster child a little baby they got it when it was just a couple weeks old and he's growing gideon's growing like a weed and they're dealing again with things that they'll soon be dealing with with grandchildren and now they're dealing with it again and I'm listening to him and I'm thinking thank you lord thank you Lord that all of that is for our part for now at least it's over with and and we can we can send them home some of the adopted ones we have we can send them home when the grandchildren come we won't probably won't want to send them home you know how that works but it looks like things will never be different the baby will never sleep through the night and you'll never get a raise or whatever the situation is but just a few moments of making a conscious decision you had to make one in the beginning to be born again to choose Christ to choose the way of the Cross to choose forgiveness of sin and the blood of Jesus to wash away your iniquities you made a choice and in that same manner we have to make a choice on a fairly regular basis to put our heads up above the natural environment and our circumstances of life and see another realm I want you to know the reality of the supernatural realm is the real deal that spiritual dimension the real deal as we've said so many times the Prophet told us that this that we look around and see is the negative but somewhere there is a positive the light strikes the positive and the negative is formed and so we try to engage with the positive by looking at the negative but how many of you know the negative is reversed you can't base your life on the negative unless you've got enough God's sense to turn the negative around because when the Holy Spirit pours the developing fluid on the negative and a print is made everything that isn't backwards is now right-side up and you are now you're not getting the real but you're getting a picture of what the real is like as pretty powerful illustration isn't it well God's not just giving us a picture he did that that's what the Bible is the Bible is a picture of the real but you know there's something more real than the pages of the Bible because the pages of the Bible record a living world and that living word is a supernatural God and that living word is living inside of you by the new birth come on now and that living God living inside of you that giving you access to the supernatural realm gives you the blessing of being able to say now wait a minute I know what it looks like in the natural and I'm out I've run out of weapons to fight this thing in the natural but I'm realizing that this is really a spiritual battle that's going on and I'm gonna have to pull myself up out of the natural environment you understand right and begin to pick up the weapons of the other realm for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds how many of your glad God didn't leave you here to fight a spiritual battle without a spiritual weapon your your spiritual weapon is your faith your faith is what pulls you above your natural environment and lets you live in the supernatural environment I want you to understand if you'll come back to me I want you to understand that as being a part of the elect we talked about that for three weeks for the elects sake you have been chosen to salvation your destiny is in Christ and Christ in you you in Christ and Christ the hope of glory formed in you that's the fullness of your destiny that's the stature of the perfect man that's the coming of the headstone that's what zechariah saw and screamed out in prophecy grace grace repeating what was being heard in the spirit and it's going to take grace grace to come all the way up to that honing in it is and we know that because we're living it and we're fighting it but i want you to understand this morning before we move on it's very very important that when we feel the heaviness of our natural environment that we use our faith weaponed and it'll help to pull ourselves up into that other realm oh my have you ever had a moment of awakening a Eureka moment where all of a sudden the thing you'd been looking at is so disastrous and hopeless but all of a sudden your spirit was stirred on the inside and you began to see it as God's potential and God's purpose and something bigger being formed for you and your future how many I'll tell you what how many of you have ever been riding down the road and someone pulls in front of you and and and and one thing right after another and you're getting later and later and later later and under more stress and under more stress and under more anxiety and you get up there to the to the crossroad and you realize that a terrible accidents just taking place and all of a sudden it doesn't matter that you're late who who cares what happened was you shifted your focus and you saw that perhaps your delay was part of God's plan sometimes delay can be part of God's plan because he's teaching us to look into that other realm hmm well we all know this good when we can learn to practice it will be supernatural people in that right how many of you know having a head knowledge of something is not enough it's got to become a reality and we've got to pull what we know in our head we've got to pull it down to the heart and let it filter through the soul and let our soul get ahold of it because our spirits already touched it but it's our mind our will and our emotions that wants us so many many times to lose that focus are you with me all right the realm of the supernatural is a realm beyond the reach of science it is beyond human explanation the word supernatural means above and beyond the natural this is the realm where God operates stay with me this is the realm where God operates he operates from wait a minute let me everybody get back here with me just a moment he operates from that other realm the realm of the supernatural and from that realm he has the power and the ability as a sovereign creator to shift things around in the natural how many of you would like to think about the fact that there is a supernatural reality but you don't have to get in that other realm to experience the fullness of what's taking place there we step into that realm with our faith we get a hold of that promise but until we leave this world we got to have some help over here in the natural right so what we do is we reach in and we pull that supernatural back to the natural realm does that sound too weird we do it with our faith you see in that other realm you're already healed you believe that your hole over there in that other realm your perfect boy that's hard to say we're perfect we're complete the finished work is finished in that other realm according to the scripture and but we're not living in that realm all the time because we are we're we're dual citizens living in two realms and two dimensions at the same time our faith is giving us access to the spiritual realm our senses are giving us access to the natural realm and sometimes we live by the natural senses instead of by the spiritual senses now what you know it looks overwhelming and depression thrives over here in the natural realm when faith refuses when you refuse to send your faith into God's reality is that too hard to get a hold of how do we get a glimpse if we don't see visions how do we get a glimpse of the reality of that other round by the Word of God the Word of God gives us a glimpse of what we can have when we use our faith to reach over again in that realm you are already healed depression is already gone everything you're fighting and struggling with in that realm it's already behind you so what you've got to do is take the reality of that truth and pull it right down and say I'm gonna live by that how many times do you have to do that how many of those thoughts do you have to bring into captivity and submit them to the media to cry every one of them how often are you gonna have to use your faith to access the reality of the supernatural around every day every day all day long when somebody says you sure do look sick you'd say well I may but with His stripes you could you could help me with his stripes I'm already healed anybody with me I hope so cuz I want to share some or in that realm in that supernatural realm heaven and earth intermingle it's the realm of interaction between God and man it's a faith realm or a supernatural realm and God wants his children to be able to move into that realm and take those promises back just like John in Revelation 4:1 when he was invited to come up through an open door into the things of the Spirit everyone is not going to have that kind of experience in their life but I tell you what you will do and what you can do you can send your faith over into that realm and say I believe what God's Word said I believe that more than I believe what I see and feel and since with my own with my own sensors with my own ability now let me give you some some quotes from the message of the hour because I think they'll be a blessing to you and in order for that to happen you've got to really listen and pull a little bit in a message called faith he said jesus said these things that I do shall you do also then in God's then in excuse me then is God sworn covenant true Jesus is here this is the man of God Jesus is here his spirit is here could we say the same thing about this morning sure II can because we brought him with us when we came we serve a supernatural God we carry a deposit of that supernatural God by eternal life inside of us wherever you go your natural life goes and your spirit life goes God goes with you if you're born again of the Spirit of God and so we can say with full confidence Jesus is here we don't see him oh yes we do but not with our natural eyes because in order for us to see him in our natural eyes he would have to be walking among us in a corporal body his earthly body his body of flesh he's not doing that but on the day of Pentecost the very same spirit that was in Jesus fell on the believers so that spirit is in a and we can see him among us not with these eyes but with the other set the faith eyes the spirit eyes we can sense him and feel him as we worship the Lord this morning his presence was real as we prayed over the need his presence was real we shouldn't be surprised he's here he's here all right he goes on to say what happened just now he was moving in and out in this message that he gave us he said I I went into another world it's an unseen world it sounds all mysterious doesn't it sometime it's because we we haven't taken enough time to try to digest it it's not really so mystical at all it's a reality that we got to get a hold of if we're gonna fight the good fight in the last days at any time and any moment that you want to touch that dimension you have the gift of faith to do that you believe that how many of you believe you have faith if you don't God words--all I see because God's Word said to every man that's a human to every man is given a measure of faith to every man is given the measure of faith you've got it and your faith grows by exercising it and by using it every one of us can choose to exercise faith instead of the opposite which is fear and doubt he said it's an unseen world he said we become so conscious of looking at one another like this in the natural but there is an unseen world it's greater than anything you can see with the natural eye and bears Christ he said in this world in this world in this building here now this was a good many years ago but it's still the truth today there are evil spirits at war I know some people don't believe in that because they're they're too focused on the realm but I want you to know just as real as what you and I experienced over here there is another dimension and angels and demons are just as real as you are sitting here this morning and this is not to give you Spooky's or to make you feel all weird it's to help you understand that sometimes you don't understand the battle because you're trying to figure it out as though it was a battle of the flesh and it's really a battle of spirit but don't despair because you've been given every weapon you need to fight a battle in either realm in that good news you can win this thing he said in this building here are evil spirits and war and Christians anointed praise God and the angels of God encamped about them listen to this you know does he mind no the rest of this quotation it's been used a lot he said in the angels of God are encamped around them about them trying to energize their faith did you know that one of the ministries of angels you believe in angels and closing my eyes you believe in angels well they're real whether you believe in them or not so I said well I've never seen one doesn't matter it's actually a little rare to see them with the natural eye can be done can happen they have the ability to step from the unseen realm into the realm of the natural they can be manifested they were in the days of the Bible they were a generation ago and they have been in our day I believe in angels but even if you've never seen an angel it doesn't mean they don't exist and it doesn't mean that they don't work pretty hard to keep you going some of you give them a hard time some of you keep them busy some of you drive too fast not just women either you keep the angels busy trying to protect you and your foolishness but thank God we got them and although we used to joke about him getting out when you get over 70 an hour how many of you know I'm glad they don't even when I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do I've still got a purpose to finish for God and he's taking care of me one day my purpose is gonna be over maybe tomorrow one day my purpose is going to be over and when it is I'm leaving here but until that day there's not a devil in that other dimension that can kill me you got to understand that because there's a supernatural God that lives inside of me and he says when it's time for me to go amen because I identify with those who have been chosen to salvation elected to eternal life it's a pretty powerful hope it's a pretty powerful promise so one of the ministries of angels this morning is to energize your faith how many of you know face battery can get kind of low anybody ever had a draining faith battery so I said you just gotta believe God and you say I'm believing with everything I got but I'm getting a little weak I'm getting a little low I'm having a hard time then we got to get in the presence of the Lord we've got to be faithful together with the Saints and get in and buy an environment of faith because the angels there with us but when we get together they're individual messengers who are assigned to us according to the scripture we used to you know the church used to say well everybody gets one well I want you to know I just can't believe that because the Bible doesn't say everybody just gets one and I know that some of you require many more than one you may have a dozen but when we get in the presence of the Lord they all come with us how many times did you hear brother Branham when he was preaching how many times did you hear and say may the angels of the Lord come and take up their position in this place standing along the walls watching over listen somebody said I don't believe in that you believe in Harry Potter you believe in what you see on the television you'd be surprised how much of that is real you'd be surprised that some of what Hollywood has glamorized it's not very glamorous at all it's actually more real than what a lot of people would want to admit this is not to strike fear in your heart it is to tell you you got to use your god-given weapon you got to stay in touch with the unseen realm and not the dark side of the unseen realm but the light side the god side the supernatural God's side is eternal life you got to stay connected to that you do that by faith no weapon no weapon formed against you shall prosper that's a promise but you got to stay connected to the faith realm remember the promise of asking whatever you will and it shall be given to you in my name remember that promise comes with a prerequisite that means a requirement and what is that requirement to stay connected what did Jesus say John 15 if you abide in me and my words it's a terrible shame for a born-again Holy Ghost field child of God not to know what the word said about something somebody said well I just got saved yesterday well you know what your knowledge is going to be limited but people who have been in the word for 30 years we ought to know what the word said we can all commit it to memory but we can commit it to spirit we can get it piled inside of us and when we when we need it how many of you know the Spirit of God can bring it back to our memory and we need to exercise that word and use it take your Bible to school day you heard about it it's big nobody had to organize the day in my day when I was in school nobody had to get together I took my Bible to school every single solitary day of my school existence in public school and in Christian school do you know why it was life to me it was life to me I needed a connection and sometimes I needed it more in that kind of environment I needed to know it was there there's no superpower in the book the superpower is in the life but you don't know how to receive and operate in the life unless you read the book the book is the manual that helps you have fellowship with the Living Word I want to know the Living Word of God because it gives us power amen thank you for your amens now he goes on to say something in a message called God's provided way of healing we have a just a little more time he said Oh hallelujah you have to receive the word that's what sets it afire brother when you receive it the revelation something slips this is good something slips out of the unseen world yonder and comes rolling down a mystical channel somewhere into your soul every time you receive a revelation you of truth when God strikes your heart with the truth you've been reading the word you've been listening to a sermon you've been hearing your pastor preached and something quickens that word and you you you say oh that's right that's a true that is real and it becomes a revelation to you you cannot receive a revelation of this world of this dimension the revelation that we're talking about of spiritual understanding of his word it comes from that other supernatural realm and it comes rolling into this realm so every time you get a revelation of God's truth guess what a little more of that supernatural realm comes to live inside of you how many of you realize then that if we could get more and more revelation that's why we're praying all the time lord give us revelation give us understanding somebody said we have a message I know that God has given us a message but has he given you an understanding of that message you see it's hard sometimes these Pentecostal babies it's hard some time to teach them algebra because they haven't learned their ABCs do you understand that you've got to learn your ABCs before you can work in any kind of algebra we're talking spiritual now there are principles that the bride of Jesus Christ are going to need during this awakening we're going to need some of these principles to be able to push back the darkness to get above the depression to get above the the chronic sickness to get above all the things listen there's a spirit of suicide over this region that we have to keep praying about pushing it further and further back and and there must be an intercessor an intercessory bride a bride standing in intercession who takes this very personal how many of you believe it's personal it's in our county it's in our schools we don't have our children in the public school most of us but we still have a responsibility in prayer to pray about that thing I want you to know it's so not prayerless and every day when I go to God with the prayer list I remember that we can't afford to lose another teenager to that spirit until they have an opportunity to know there's more to life than that so you and I we keep getting revelation and praying Lord give me understanding open my eyes to your word so that you can keep getting deposits of that supernatural realm so that you can keep defeating start defeating or keep defeating the works of darkness against you how many of you feel the fiery darts sometime I'm gonna look around how many of you feel fiery darts what do you do catch him you just say well that one's mine I better take it God gives you he gives you an armor he gives you some defense but it's not automatic I'm gonna tell you something this generation is gonna have to get through their thick skull that God is not a lucky rabbit's foot he's not a horseshoe over your door your relationship with a supernatural God has to be a daily walk it's not once a week if it's a serious thing because there's so much darkness that crowds around us we're not only got a we don't only have to receive the light we gotta shine some light we've got to get enough light that it overflows and somebody else can catch a glimpse of it because you're shining how many of you want to shine do you really there's some price involved in there but it's worth it all I guarantee it's worth it all all right let me move on just a moment here we take a few more minutes when God speaks anything this is a message from it life is the healer when God speaks anything you must fasten your soul into that word on to his word and hold on to it no matter what the outside says your faith looks to the unseen world where do you find that in the Bible we just read it faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen unseen the other realm the realm of completion the realm of fullness the realm that reflects the power and sovereignty of the God we serve you've got to see him you've got to catch a vision in your spirit man of who God is he is not out to get you he's out to get you he's not out to get you he's out to get you he's not out to destroy you he's out to capture you to pull you in to show you there's a purpose for your life you're not here at this time by mistake some of us feel like we were born out of season but you were born in God's season regardless of the circumstances of your conception you're here in God's proper order and timing for your life and you need to catch a glimpse of that it changes everything when you get a real true deep revelation from the supernatural realm that God lives in you and has chosen you and elected you for salvation and you're here for a purpose that is bigger than you are you don't have to know every detail of that purpose to keep pressing through and whipping the devil you just catch a piece of it I mean let me read this I have to find this but I can do it quickly I think but Smith Wigglesworth said something he said if you will take a step of ordinary faith when you come to the end of that faith very often this supernatural faith will take over can I read it again if you will take a step of ordinary faith what faith if you got use what you got you don't need a whole lot just use what you got so many said but I don't have any faith you do if you're alive on planet Earth you were given a measure of faith you may have pushed it down with a lot of doubt with a lot of woe is me with a lot of unbelief but you are given faith and you can touch that faith you can find that faith the key to finding the faith that God gave you in the beginning there's a key to it and that is to acknowledge that you cannot succeed without him your life will not ever be any better as long as you're doing the driving the old timers used to have the license plate god is my co-pilot if God not only does he not need you to be his co-pilot if he's doing the driving you should leave the driving to him you should just crawl in the back seat and cover your head really the best way because he knows what is best for us and he will help us if we quit fighting him why do we fight him why don't we just surrender to Him why don't we just let him come and live his life through us oh they're not have to be one of those weird Christians I'd have to be all spiritual and stuff let me tell you something you were born for that I didn't say religious I like to be able to talk to people without without punctuating every sentence with praise the Lord Amen that doesn't appeal to me but I understand that it's the best some folks can do and so when you're talking to them and in the restaurant its hallelujah praise the Lord god bless you buddy amen praise also good to see hallelujah our God I'm sure that it is sincere but it becomes a little obnoxious I don't really need that to feel like I'm talking to a Christian how many of you understand so you don't have to be flaky to be real he wants to live in you he wants you to quit trying to tell him how to live and how it would be better for where we sent unless we get into that other dimension in faith we only see what natural özkan see but from where your father sits this morning he's looking down and he not only sees right now he sees eternity he knows everything you're gonna go through the rest of your life and he may be setting you up right now for something you're not even expecting and all the steps on the journey are not pleasant but I want you to know there is no joy look at me I know I'm not pretty there is no joy like knowing that you are doing his will did you know that you can feel like you are failing everybody around you and it's enough to make you want to die but if you can catch a glimpse of knowing that you are pleasing God with what you're doing it becomes more than a shot in the arm it becomes an IV it becomes life to you I believe I can press on if I can just know that on that every now and again I please God I'm finding something in my in my destiny and his purpose for my life and I'm stepping into that what a joy that is to be able to go to bed at night and know when you lay your head on the pillow that your soul is anchored in Jesus Christ this is about relationship this is about covenant this is not just about the forgiveness of sin this is about walking with Him a supernatural God because he is racing up a supernatural people if you're a part of that number say man I am I'm a part of that now let me close with this we said something about that spiritual armor aren't you thankful we have one breastplate of righteousness helmet of salvation praise God feet shod with the preparation of peace take the sword of the Spirit but there's something you need to know about that Armour he said now we find our Lord in his work he claimed to do nothing of himself but what he's seen the father doing he gave all praise to God it was supernatural he said every armour that we have brother all of our armor is supernatural you put it on and you can't see it with a natural eye when I walk down the aisle you don't see the helmet of salvation on my head but it's there but it's not in the natural realm it's a supernatural armor that protects me in the natural realm if I take access to it how by faith by faith he said every armor that we have brother all of our armor supernatural nothing natural we must believe it what are the fruit of the Spirit love joy peace long-suffering meekness gentleness patience he said you don't go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarters worth of patients or $5 worth alive he said I could stand a lot of that he said see it's unseen sometimes it's the unseen something our whole armor we stand in the unseen world looking at unseen things yet to us we can see them because our faith detects them and says it's there it's real in another message sir we would see Jesus and the whole Christian armor now is unseen the Christian looks at what he doesn't see in the natural that's the only way you can be a Christian you've got to believe God who you can't see the whole Christian armor and he goes on to name the fruits again all those things are unseen but the things that's unseen they're the ones that really has the reality the reality is in the unseen things if it's unseen how do we see it by faith with faith eyes the doctor said there's no hope there's no solution and yet faith rises up in your heart to say wait a minute I understand and respect and honor what you have to say but my faith eyes are seeing something else that's why I'm believing serving God does not mean there will not be any disappointments there will be some disappointments but it means that at the end of every day and at the end of every trial and at the end of every broken heart ache you've still got somebody who said I'm with you I'm in you by my spirit and you can make it you can get through this by trusting me I hear I hear the Lord in the spirit I hear the Lord saying I'm not gonna be your lucky charm I'm just not I'm not gonna be the magic thing you pull down off the shelf when you get to bind I'm looking for relationship God is looking for you to surrender your life to Him let's stand this morning and afternoon I know it's late but remember we didn't start till 11:00 and God's good and he's real there's a lot of people who struggle believing that God is good because bad things happen in this world and I want you to know that is a product of sin they're bad things happening around us it is the fruit of man's decision to reject God so if somebody says let's let's take our Bible to school one day I'm for that because remember I tried to take mine every day and did if somebody said let's get around the flagpole and pray today put Jesus back I'm for that nobody conceived in their mind the idea of school mass shootings no one thought that anything like this could possibly be real in those days when they were fighting so hard to keep the Bible out of the classroom and prayer out of the public schools just think about it nobody was thinking about what the results would be we just don't want our kids brainwashed to Christianity but nobody was thinking about the fact that when you reject God and push him out of your life and out of your society the Bible said there's consequences for that and they're already set they're already scripturally outlined way before what's happening now started happening it was already outlined you can't keep rejecting God and expect to have a good life not because he wants to mess with your fun he wants you he wants you he wants your life and he wants you to love him the way that he loves you yes jesus loves me ye-yes Jesus loves
