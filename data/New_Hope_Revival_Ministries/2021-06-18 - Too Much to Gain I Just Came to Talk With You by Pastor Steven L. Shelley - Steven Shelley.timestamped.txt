[0:44] remember that there's
[0:47] too much to gain
[0:53] to learn

[1:22] too many treasures
[1:27] are waiting over
[1:30] yonder there's just too much
[1:35] to gain

[1:50] the hot burning deserts
[1:57] i was struggling
[2:01] the right road
[2:04] to choose
[2:09] oh and somewhere somewhere up ahead
[2:15] there is cool clear water
[2:21] and defeat is one word
