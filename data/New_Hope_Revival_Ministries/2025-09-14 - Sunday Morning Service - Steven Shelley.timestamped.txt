[52:04] &gt;&gt; There's no way whatsoever
[52:08] he would know what the Lord spoke to my
[52:11] heart yesterday.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; But I was by myself in the yard.
[52:17] My joints have been hurting this week.
[52:19] And I was sitting in the cool water of
[52:21] the pool.
[52:23] And the Lord spoke to me as clear as
[52:25] I've ever heard his voice. I looked to
[52:27] see if somebody else was standing around
[52:30] and he said, "I will magnify your
[52:33] inheritance now." Now,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; he had no way of knowing that that was a
[52:42] promise that I was carrying,
[52:45] but I believe it's for this house.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Let's praise the Lord right now and
[52:50] thank God. Lord, we thank you.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; You are the same yesterday,
[53:02] today, and forever.

[54:02] just continue to worship whatever the
[54:04] Lord the song has put on his heart
[54:06] today.
[54:08] if you want to continue to stay around
[54:10] the front. But I just
[54:12] want this atmosphere to remain
[54:16] for what God is desiring to do.
[54:20] He is among us. He is among us.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord.

[55:08] star
[55:10] would choose to light the way
[55:13] for my ever wondering heart.

[55:22] but because of what you've done.
[55:26] Not because of what I've done,
[55:30] but because of who you are.
[55:35] I am a flower quickly fading
[55:39] here today and gone tomorrow.
[55:43] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[55:47] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me
[55:52] when I'm calling. Lord, you catch me
[55:55] when I'm falling.

[56:36] sea
[56:38] would call out through the rain
[56:42] and calm the storm in me.
[56:47] Not because of who I am,

[57:47] that the eyes that see my sin
[57:51] will look on me with love
[57:55] to watch me rise again?
[58:00] Who am I? The same voice that calm the
[58:04] sea
[58:05] would call out through the rain
[58:09] and calm the storm in me.
[58:14] Not because of who I am, but because of
[58:19] what you've done and not because of what
[58:23] I've done,
[58:25] but because of who you are.
[58:30] Here I am a flower quickly fading
[58:34] here today in God's tomorrow.
[58:38] A wave toss in the ocean.
[58:42] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me

[1:08:35] know she was here on Tuesday night, but
[1:08:37] we're glad that she's here. We welcome
[1:08:39] her. and uh Brother Luke Hespich, we're
[1:08:42] glad that you have left behind Wisconsin
[1:08:46] and brought your belongings to Alabama.
[1:08:49] We welcome you in the name of the Lord.
[1:08:53] Oh, the belongings are coming behind
[1:08:56] you.
[1:08:57] We're glad that you're here. We welcome
[1:08:59] you. We bless you in the name of the
[1:09:02] Lord.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Sister Annie Barklift, we're glad to see
[1:09:05] you today. The Lord bless you. I've been
[1:09:07] missing you.
[1:09:13] What a blessing it is to be in the
[1:09:15] presence of the Lord.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; You know, there's nothing like it.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; As we were singing that song, I can only
[1:09:24] imagine that was a songwriter's words.
[1:09:28] But sometimes our imaginations go
[1:09:31] farther than those words go.
[1:09:33] And we imagine a little bit more than
[1:09:36] that and a little bit more than that.
[1:09:38] Because
[1:09:40] I know that there is come a word in the
[1:09:43] end time
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; that there will be a bride with him
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; sitting in his throne with him.
[1:09:55] and that there's a great number that no
[1:09:58] man could number that stood before the
[1:10:02] throne
[1:10:03] and said, "Give honor to the Lamb's wife
[1:10:07] because she has made herself ready." Oh
[1:10:10] friends, the trials that you're going
[1:10:12] through, the battles that you face, the
[1:10:16] hard palpitations that you feel,
[1:10:19] anything that you fight for in this last
[1:10:22] day, you just remember that there is
[1:10:25] something great just beyond this veil
[1:10:28] that we we see just beyond this realm
[1:10:32] that we're in. There's something greater
[1:10:35] there that words cannot even begin to
[1:10:38] fathom. But we just imagine with our
[1:10:41] mind what it might look like and we can
[1:10:43] go above that and know that he has
[1:10:46] prepared what m our minds cannot even
[1:10:50] imagine.
[1:10:52] But I'm glad that he lets us think about
[1:10:54] it and he lets us have have an
[1:10:57] anticipation of something higher that
[1:11:00] keeps pulling us along. And that's what
[1:11:03] the word of the Lord does for us. It
[1:11:06] causes us to be quickened, to be made
[1:11:09] alive, to reach higher than we've been
[1:11:12] reaching. And and we don't want to be
[1:11:14] satisfied with what we have had because
[1:11:17] there's much, much more to grab a hold
[1:11:20] of. There's much more to be had. And
[1:11:24] that is what we are here for today
[1:11:26] because there's much more that he wants
[1:11:29] to unfold to us.
[1:11:33] And I'm glad that he invited us into his
[1:11:36] presence.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Will you stand with us once again?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you that every need that
[1:11:52] is among us is supplied.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:11:57] we don't have to beg because you didn't
[1:12:00] make us beggars.
[1:12:02] We are sons and daughters and we just
[1:12:06] simply say papa you see
[1:12:09] and you meet the need. So as we are
[1:12:13] turning our hearts toward the word,
[1:12:15] Lord, we know that even in the hearing
[1:12:19] of the word, we have been told that
[1:12:22] there is revel revelatory truth that can
[1:12:26] go forth that we can reach up in faith
[1:12:29] and have our need met at that moment as
[1:12:32] we reach up in faith. So we reach up in
[1:12:35] faith in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:39] Christ. We glorify you and give you
[1:12:42] praise. Hallelujah. Have faith in God.
[1:12:46] Faith for the answer. Have faith in God.
[1:12:51] Let the faith of God, not just my own
[1:12:55] faith,
[1:12:57] but let the faith of God rise up as
[1:13:00] we're hearing the word today.
[1:13:03] the faith of God to reach up to grab a
[1:13:07] hold of the word of God that it becomes
[1:13:11] not just another word that comes and
[1:13:14] goes,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; but it is a word that becomes a part of
[1:13:18] the building blocks in us.
[1:13:21] Have
[1:13:23] faith
[1:13:25] in God.
[1:13:31] Have Have
[1:13:33] faith
[1:13:35] in God.
[1:13:41] Have
[1:13:44] faith
[1:13:45] in God for your answer.
[1:13:51] Have faith
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:54] in
[1:13:56] God.
[1:13:58] Once again,
[1:14:01] have
[1:14:04] faith
[1:14:06] in God.
[1:14:12] Have
[1:14:14] faith
[1:14:16] in God.
[1:14:19] Have faith in God.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Have
[1:14:24] faith
[1:14:26] in God.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Love you.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:14:32] have faith
[1:14:35] in
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:38] All is well.
[1:14:43] All is well.
[1:14:47] I want you to sing that from your spirit
[1:14:49] man. We have heard the message
[1:14:55] shalom.
[1:14:57] All is well.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; For there is a place for
[1:15:05] there is
[1:15:07] a place of perfect.
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:16] the inner veil.
[1:15:18] So
[1:15:20] rest
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:25] for all is well.
[1:15:29] I know you've been singing a lot, but
[1:15:31] sing this verse with me. It's the story
[1:15:35] of Elisha,
[1:15:37] the Shunomite
[1:15:39] woman and her son.
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:47] That little woman found favor with God.
[1:15:53] So he gave her a son.
[1:15:58] Thank you, Lord. You did. One day while
[1:16:02] working in the field, that little boy
[1:16:06] died. Oh, but that woman's faith, it
[1:16:12] never failed.
[1:16:14] Even in death, she testified
[1:16:20] that all is well.
[1:16:24] Let that be your testimony today. All is
[1:16:30] well.
[1:16:35] All is well.
[1:16:40] We have heard. We have heard the
[1:16:45] message. Shalom.
[1:16:48] Peace.
[1:16:50] All is well.
[1:16:53] I believe there is a place for there is
[1:16:59] a place of
[1:17:03] woo behind
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; behind
[1:17:07] the interval.
[1:17:09] [Music]
[1:17:12] rest
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; rest for all.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:17:20] Just a little more in my monitor while
[1:17:22] I'm singing this verse.
[1:17:25] Now things have not always worked out
[1:17:32] like God's people thought.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; You ever been disappointed?
[1:17:39] You see, the bride is still here, but
[1:17:43] she's fighting.
[1:17:45] Oh, the greatest battle ever fall.
[1:17:51] She must have the faith
[1:17:56] of Abraham,
[1:18:00] knowing
[1:18:02] knowing God's word never
[1:18:05] fails. Just look up little bride
[1:18:11] and know better.
[1:18:14] [Applause]
[1:18:15] [Music]
[1:18:17] Hallelujah.
[1:18:18] Praise God. All is well.
[1:18:23] Tell the enemy, "All is well.
[1:18:27] It didn't work. It didn't work. I'm
[1:18:31] still at peace."
[1:18:33] Oh, we have heard. We've heard the
[1:18:37] message.
[1:18:39] Shalom.
[1:18:45] Woo.
[1:18:47] For there is a place
[1:18:52] of perfect
[1:18:54] rest behind
[1:18:57] that inner
[1:19:00] veil.
[1:19:04] Woo!
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Again, things
[1:19:19] have not always worked out
[1:19:23] like God's people thought.
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] You see, we're still here, this little
[1:19:33] bride. We're still fighting the greatest
[1:19:38] battle ever fall.
[1:19:43] Oh, but we've got to hold on and keep
[1:19:45] the faith,
[1:19:47] the faith of Abraham.
[1:19:52] We're knowing that in the end, God's
[1:19:54] word cannot fail. Just look up, little
[1:20:01] bride, and know
[1:20:04] that all
[1:20:06] is well. If you believe that, sing it
[1:20:09] like you do one last time. Oh, all
[1:20:13] is well. Are y'all singing it? Sing it.
[1:20:16] Sing it. All is well. Oh,
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:22] even if you don't think you can sing,
[1:20:24] sing it. Oh, we have heard
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; shalom.
[1:20:36] Woo my God. For there is a place for
[1:20:41] there is
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; behind
[1:20:51] the inner veil.
[1:20:56] rest
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:01] for all.
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; So rest little bride.
[1:21:10] Rest.
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Look at somebody next to you and sing it
[1:21:18] right to them. So rest little bride.
[1:21:25] rest.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; All
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; is well.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Anybody else believe that?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Anybody else believe that?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Let's act like we believe that.
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:53] Thank you to the musicians.
[1:21:56] Come on back and join us as quickly as
[1:21:58] you can. I want you to be here. Turn to
[1:22:02] Ephesians chapter 5.
[1:22:05] And I asked brother Gley to go ahead and
[1:22:09] greet you, not because I don't want to,
[1:22:10] but because I I I just felt like it
[1:22:16] I just
[1:22:25] I wasn't sure originally where that was
[1:22:26] coming from. Um because I felt like we
[1:22:30] should go as quickly to this word as we
[1:22:32] possibly can. It's life to us.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; But I will tell Joseph who is up there
[1:22:40] in the tower
[1:22:42] that your work has already been
[1:22:44] appreciated in South Africa.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; They're sending word from South Africa.
[1:22:48] We appreciate the new camera
[1:22:50] positioning. Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; That's something Joseph wanted to work
[1:22:54] have for us a long time and it didn't
[1:22:56] work out. Didn't come together. But last
[1:22:59] Saturday, Ben and Benjamin and I don't
[1:23:02] know who all else was helping got over
[1:23:04] here and put us a platform there so that
[1:23:07] we can have an angle on that side as
[1:23:09] well. We're just believing that we want
[1:23:12] to document and record what the Lord is
[1:23:14] doing now and what he's about to do.
[1:23:18] Ephesians 5. Um R.J., would you slip?
[1:23:22] Would you slip? I don't know if you can
[1:23:24] slip or not, but would you come up here
[1:23:26] and help me somehow while the people are
[1:23:28] getting their scripture ready? I have a
[1:23:30] particularly
[1:23:32] I'm having a particularly diffic
[1:23:34] difficult time with my my headpiece.
[1:23:38] When I got happy while ago, I realized
[1:23:40] it was sticking out there and I'm having
[1:23:43] a little bit of a distraction and
[1:23:45] struggle and just I don't care. Just do
[1:23:47] whatever it is. Smash, mash, push, pull,
[1:23:51] tug. I don't care what you have to do.
[1:23:56] Well, yes, it does, actually.
[1:24:00] Well, praise the Lord. Yes. I wished I'd
[1:24:03] have called you up here a long time ago.
[1:24:05] Thank you so much. I'm sorry for having
[1:24:07] to ask you to do it. Ephesians chapter
[1:24:09] 5,
[1:24:11] uh, beginning in verse 14. We are still
[1:24:14] in we we are still in a series. We're in
[1:24:17] two or three different series at one
[1:24:19] time. They've all got names.
[1:24:22] Maybe we can get it straightened out
[1:24:24] before we're through. We're still making
[1:24:26] wine for the master. Praise God for
[1:24:28] that. But we're now dealing with
[1:24:32] destinies that can be forfeited that can
[1:24:35] be that can be forfeited or fulfilled.
[1:24:39] And we're looking at it through the
[1:24:41] scripture. Today we're taking just a
[1:24:44] slightly different turn because the Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost said today that we should and we
[1:24:49] will obey him and we'll believe that God
[1:24:52] will let his word speak directly to your
[1:24:54] heart. Ephesians 5:14, wherefore he
[1:24:57] saith, awake, awake
[1:25:00] thou
[1:25:02] that sleepest.
[1:25:04] Let Let me say that again. Awake
[1:25:07] thou that sleepest
[1:25:10] and arise
[1:25:13] and arise
[1:25:15] from the dead. Do you believe God's
[1:25:17] still raising the dead?
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; We need him to do it in the house this
[1:25:21] morning.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; He's still raising the dead. Hallelujah.
[1:25:26] And Christ
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; shall do what?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He is the light. And he wants to give
[1:25:35] you and I the light.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; When people look so miserable about
[1:25:39] their faith,
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want it. Would you?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Uh sometimes you see holiness people or
[1:25:47] Anabaptist people and they're looking so
[1:25:50] miserable with their life.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; And you know, we're not drawing anybody
[1:25:54] to Christ with that kind of a a sourness
[1:25:57] about us. May we brighten up everybody's
[1:26:00] day. May we be so filled with the light
[1:26:02] and life of Christ that people are
[1:26:05] interested in what we have and who we
[1:26:07] know.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing? If
[1:26:10] you're not happy about your faith, I
[1:26:13] just pray that you'll get that way.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; I just pray that the Lord will break
[1:26:18] forth in you with some joy. That's what
[1:26:20] we need is joy. Amen. See then that you
[1:26:24] walk circumspectly. It's a big word.
[1:26:29] Uh it's uprightness. It's in divine
[1:26:32] order.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just mean mindful, but it
[1:26:36] also means mindful, sober.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Uh it means that we should uh walk in a
[1:26:42] particular way because of the
[1:26:46] crookedness that's around us. We should
[1:26:49] walk in a particularly straight and
[1:26:51] upright position spiritually.
[1:26:55] Uh we should walk in a counter in a
[1:26:58] counter direction of how the world is
[1:27:00] walking. Not as fools
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; but as wise. Can you say amen?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Redeeming
[1:27:09] the time
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; because the days are evil. I want you
[1:27:14] all to say redeeming the time.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; because the days are evil.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Wherefore be ye not unwise. It's
[1:27:23] very important to ask for the wisdom of
[1:27:25] the Lord.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, we need his wisdom day and
[1:27:30] night.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but
[1:27:34] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:27:38] is.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; It's vitally important that you are
[1:27:41] careful not to criticize what you don't
[1:27:44] understand.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; And there'll be no need to get your
[1:27:48] feelings hurt over what you don't
[1:27:50] understand. The Bible tells us that we
[1:27:54] should not be unwise but we should be
[1:27:56] wise
[1:27:58] and we should seek to understand what
[1:28:01] the will of the Lord is.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And this is not I felt I felt I felt I
[1:28:07] felt. I get really really weary with
[1:28:10] people who blame their feelings on the
[1:28:13] Lord.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; It's not just how you feel. Sometimes
[1:28:16] you you don't feel like coming to
[1:28:18] church.
[1:28:20] So, we're not led by our feelings.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; We've got to be led by the will of the
[1:28:25] Lord.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want to come across that rough,
[1:28:30] but I just want you to know that we're
[1:28:33] we this little bride is to live above
[1:28:35] her feelings.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; In fact, one time, Brother Brandham
[1:28:38] said, we're just not even to to consider
[1:28:40] them at all
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; how we feel.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; It'll get in the way of the word, won't
[1:28:45] it?
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:28:47] is. and be not drunk with wine, wherein
[1:28:50] is excess,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; but be filled with the spirit.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I would just caution you to have
[1:28:57] moderation in all things,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; not just wine, but also chocolate cake.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Moderation in all things,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; right? Don't be so crazy uh wild about
[1:29:11] anything, but just be be very careful
[1:29:13] that you hold everything in a in a
[1:29:16] moderate sort of way. If you're going to
[1:29:19] use the internet, you should do it in
[1:29:21] moderation. If you're going to if you're
[1:29:22] going to have social media, you should
[1:29:24] have it in moderation. It shouldn't be
[1:29:26] the first thing you go to in the
[1:29:28] morning, the last thing you go to at
[1:29:30] night.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; It's got to find a place in your life.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; If you're a YouTube addict, get
[1:29:35] deliverance.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing wrong with being able to
[1:29:38] have access to YouTube, but if that's
[1:29:40] all you spend your life doing, you're
[1:29:42] not walking wise.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; You're not walking circumspect. In fact,
[1:29:46] you're getting drunk. You're getting
[1:29:48] drunk on YouTube.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; So, we have to live according to this
[1:29:54] word and message by moderation. And
[1:29:57] instead of looking for something else to
[1:29:59] give us the dopamine rush, we need to be
[1:30:02] filled with the capital S. spirit.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; By the Holy Spirit, we need to be
[1:30:10] filled. Can the church say amen?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Speaking to yourselves.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That doesn't just mean among yourselves.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; It also means to yourself.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't I don't think
[1:30:23] that that's what it means." I didn't ask
[1:30:25] you what you thought it meant. I'm
[1:30:26] telling you what it means by the
[1:30:28] original language. Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; The scripture also tells us that we
[1:30:32] should build up ourselves,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; praying in the spirit, praying in the
[1:30:37] Holy Ghost.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; We hear people say, "Well, that that
[1:30:41] gift over there, you know, that's just
[1:30:42] self-edifying." The scripture actually
[1:30:45] tells us that there's a time that we
[1:30:47] must edify ourselves.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; There's a time that we must lift up
[1:30:52] ourselves. And what that means is when
[1:30:55] you fall, you don't lay there and wallow
[1:30:57] around in defeat. As grandma used to
[1:31:00] say, you pull yourself up by the
[1:31:02] bootstraps.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; You build yourself up.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; You pull yourself up and you keep on
[1:31:08] going. Can somebody say amen?
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Singing uh singing uh psalms, speaking
[1:31:14] to yourselves in psalms and hymns
[1:31:17] and spiritual songs. That's spirit
[1:31:20] inspired songs. Singing and making
[1:31:23] melody in your heart,
[1:31:26] the seat of your emotions. Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; To the Lord. If you're making melody to
[1:31:31] the Lord in the seat of your emotions,
[1:31:34] you'll keep your emotions in check.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You can't fly off the handle while
[1:31:40] you're singing sweet melodies to the
[1:31:42] Lord. You'll just you'll just be
[1:31:44] surprised what it'll do for you. Giving
[1:31:46] thanks always.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Always."
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Giving thanks always for
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; always.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:31:58] And here's the key. Unto God.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Unto God. Unto God. As the Lord wills.
[1:32:06] Unto God. As the Lord wills. It's unto
[1:32:10] God. And we give thanks for it. Whether
[1:32:12] we like it or whether it hurts us or
[1:32:14] whether we don't. We say, "Lord, you
[1:32:16] give, you take away. Blessed be the name
[1:32:18] of the Lord." We give thanks always for
[1:32:20] all things unto God and the father in
[1:32:23] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Two
[1:32:28] manifestations here of the great eternal
[1:32:30] spirit of God. Don't forget that he is
[1:32:33] one.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You may read of three offices. You may
[1:32:37] read of three manifestations. But let us
[1:32:39] not forget the scripture is clear. He is
[1:32:42] one here. O Israel, the Lord thy God is
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; He's one now. Father, we need you today.
[1:32:49] We've had a glorious atmosphere created
[1:32:53] by the praise and the worship of the
[1:32:55] saints, and you honored it by coming.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; It must have somehow pleased your heart
[1:33:00] because you showed up in the house, and
[1:33:03] that's why we're here. We're not here to
[1:33:05] see each other as much as we care about
[1:33:07] one another. We've come here to see you
[1:33:09] today and you have not disappointed us.
[1:33:12] You've been with us and we believe that
[1:33:14] you have a purpose even in this portion
[1:33:16] of the service. So come now, do what you
[1:33:20] see that we would have need of and we'll
[1:33:22] give you glory, honor, and praise for
[1:33:25] it's in the magnificent and mighty name
[1:33:28] of Yeshua, our Messiah, the Lord Jesus
[1:33:31] Christ. We pray. And the saint said,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:33:38] It was in my nature
[1:33:41] and in my tradition
[1:33:43] not to say anything at all about what
[1:33:47] our nation has just experienced.
[1:33:50] But when I woke up this morning, I had a
[1:33:52] little feeling as I went to bed last
[1:33:54] night. Well, when I woke up this
[1:33:56] morning, I knew that I was getting a
[1:33:57] nudge from another dimension, another
[1:34:01] realm that I should speak just a moment
[1:34:04] about what has happened in our nation.
[1:34:07] It was tragic news uh that we all dealt
[1:34:11] with this past week. I was very
[1:34:15] disturbed by a young woman, an immigrant
[1:34:19] riding a train in Charlotte, not
[1:34:23] Chicago.
[1:34:26] Not Atlanta,
[1:34:28] Charlotte.
[1:34:30] That's North Carolina.
[1:34:34] That is south, I believe, of the Mason
[1:34:36] Dixon line.
[1:34:38] Charlotte used to be a a little little
[1:34:40] city. Now it has grown evidently into
[1:34:45] something much larger than it used to
[1:34:46] be. Used to be a very safe place. And it
[1:34:51] still is considered the foothills of the
[1:34:53] Appalachians. Even though it's quite a
[1:34:55] ways couple hours away, it's still
[1:34:58] considered part of the heartland of the
[1:35:00] south. And here this girl, this woman is
[1:35:03] riding home and for whatever reason,
[1:35:06] somebody said, "I wished I knew the
[1:35:08] reason." What does the reason matter? We
[1:35:10] We may never know. People don't know.
[1:35:12] They're insane.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; They're driven by insanity. They're
[1:35:16] driven by demon powers. If you don't
[1:35:18] believe that there's a warfare going on
[1:35:21] in the realm of the spirit, I don't know
[1:35:22] where you're living.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; You got your head in the hole in the
[1:35:27] ground like an ostrich
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; because we are in a spiritual battle.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; And it is not a political battle.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; If it were only a political battle, it
[1:35:37] wouldn't merit being mentioned in the
[1:35:39] pullpit this morning. That's right.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; But it's a spiritual battle.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And we ought to be vigilant. We ought to
[1:35:46] be on guard in prayer
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; and we ought to go where God says go and
[1:35:50] stay away from where God says stay away
[1:35:53] from.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You want to be at the right place at the
[1:35:56] right time.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And you want to know that wherever you
[1:35:59] go, you can take some light with you.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And for some reason, this hoodie fellow
[1:36:07] just gets up and starts stabbing her
[1:36:10] and no one moves to help her because
[1:36:15] they're afraid of him perhaps. Maybe
[1:36:18] they're afraid of being drugged into
[1:36:21] jail, into court, into prison for trying
[1:36:24] to save her, for trying to stop him.
[1:36:29] Because we know that our nation has a
[1:36:31] precedent now of prosecuting people who
[1:36:34] try to stand up and stop those who are
[1:36:37] trying to do others harm. I don't know
[1:36:40] what the reason is. I pray to God that
[1:36:42] wasn't racially motivated. But I want to
[1:36:45] ask you today to consider the hour that
[1:36:48] we're living in
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and pray like you've never prayed
[1:36:52] before.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Before that girl got any attention. As
[1:36:56] soon as he got off the train, we're told
[1:36:58] that there were some from the front who
[1:37:00] rushed back to help her. It was too
[1:37:02] late. She had bled out.
[1:37:05] Now, this is a serious thing. I'm still
[1:37:09] trying to process this in prayer. Uh the
[1:37:12] next day, I I'm still dealing in prayer
[1:37:16] with it. It worries me. It bothers me.
[1:37:18] Burdens me. I said to my wife, "This is
[1:37:21] serious business." when you're minding
[1:37:24] your own business, doing nothing to
[1:37:27] aggravate or agitate the crowd, and
[1:37:29] someone just rises up over your seat and
[1:37:32] stabbed you to death.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; In America,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; I said, "We've got to be on guard and
[1:37:38] we've got to pray." Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And then the next day
[1:37:43] we hear or or some days after we hear
[1:37:46] this report, I got a notification
[1:37:51] that said Charlie Kirk has been shot on
[1:37:55] my phone. I didn't even move because I
[1:37:58] didn't believe it. I thought, why surely
[1:38:01] that is some crazy rumor, some urban
[1:38:05] legend, some foolishness that's going
[1:38:08] around because there's plenty of it
[1:38:10] going around. Are you with me?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have to agree with me. I just
[1:38:14] want you to listen. That's what you came
[1:38:16] for.
[1:38:18] I said, "Surely that can't be." And then
[1:38:21] we find out that it is real. It was
[1:38:24] tragic to me to find out that he had
[1:38:26] been assassinated.
[1:38:28] It shook me.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; It shook a lot of people and some of us
[1:38:33] who did not closely follow his
[1:38:36] organization.
[1:38:37] I did not.
[1:38:39] But I really enjoyed the spirited debate
[1:38:44] clips that I was sent by many folks from
[1:38:48] around the world with university
[1:38:51] students across America
[1:38:54] debating on moral and biblical issues.
[1:38:57] And because of that connection, I felt a
[1:39:00] huge sense of loss
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; for someone that I had never met. And
[1:39:05] everybody I spoke to felt the same. If
[1:39:07] you didn't, that's your business.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; But I'm only bringing this up because
[1:39:11] the spirit of the Lord nudged me that I
[1:39:13] should. My biggest feeling this morning
[1:39:16] is I have a broken heart for a nation
[1:39:19] that once stood strong and moral, a
[1:39:23] nation that exists because people were
[1:39:25] grieved by their inability to worship
[1:39:28] God according to the dictates of their
[1:39:31] heart
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; and according to the dictates of
[1:39:33] scripture.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Stay with me now.
[1:39:38] Uh it it it's troubling. It's been in a
[1:39:41] downward spiral for a long time, but
[1:39:43] it's it's getting increasingly and
[1:39:45] rapidly worse.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; This nation exists
[1:39:50] because people said we want to worship
[1:39:52] God without the government telling us
[1:39:54] how to do it.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? It's unthinkable that
[1:39:58] we've fallen so far as a nation to the
[1:40:01] point where it seems acceptable to
[1:40:03] assassinate someone in front of their
[1:40:05] family
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; and for the whole world to witness
[1:40:09] simply because of their stand on having
[1:40:12] a static unchangeable gender and
[1:40:15] biblical morality. There are two genders
[1:40:18] according to the Bible.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Is that what the word teaches us?
[1:40:23] And so I I really did appreciate I I I I
[1:40:27] wasn't looking to his political opinion.
[1:40:31] That's neither here nor there to me.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; But what attracted me to hear the things
[1:40:37] that were sent to me and later to to
[1:40:40] follow up was the fact that he just
[1:40:43] boldly declared
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; you know someone is telling you I don't
[1:40:49] know what I am. I'm not sure what I am.
[1:40:51] Sometimes I am a woman, sometimes I'm a
[1:40:53] man. Define a woman. Define all this
[1:40:55] kind of crazy talk that people do. And
[1:40:57] he just looks right at him at in the in
[1:40:59] the eye and said that's a lie.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; The word of God said the word of God
[1:41:04] said. The word of God said.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that in anybody.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; I I tell you, I appreciate anybody
[1:41:11] that'll tell us what the word says.
[1:41:14] And so what stood out to most to me
[1:41:16] about Charlie Kirk was that he had a
[1:41:19] love for the word of God
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; and passion that he demonstrated when
[1:41:23] talking about a life of faith.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Charlie Kirk believed that if we could
[1:41:27] get the youth of America back to the
[1:41:29] Bible
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; that it was highly likely that some of
[1:41:33] them would fall in love with Jesus.
[1:41:35] That's right.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And he knew if that alone could happen,
[1:41:38] it would deprogram their twisted minds
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; from the liberal brainwashing and
[1:41:44] influence. It would begin to influence
[1:41:47] every area of their lives,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; including the way they voted.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't wrong about that.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that a fulfilled
[1:41:55] destiny requires a devotion to truth.
[1:41:59] Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And while he may not have shared our
[1:42:03] revelation and understanding about many
[1:42:05] things,
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; and while there are many in our ranks
[1:42:09] who believe that there's no salvation
[1:42:11] outside of the Malachi 4 understanding
[1:42:13] of who Brother Brandham was, we know
[1:42:16] that's 100% incorrect
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; because it's anti-word.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; There's one requirement.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Call on his name in faith. The Bible
[1:42:27] said, "Whosoever calleth upon the name
[1:42:30] of the Lord,
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; is that what the Bible says?"
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Then that's what we're going to have to
[1:42:35] believe.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't make that man or woman
[1:42:38] an overcomer.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't make them a part of the elect
[1:42:42] lady.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; But it means they have eternal life.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; How do you get eternal life? Because you
[1:42:48] believe on the Lord.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's ABC's.
[1:42:51] Accept, believe, confess. If you accept
[1:42:54] that Jesus has died on the cross for
[1:42:56] your sins and you accept it and you
[1:42:59] believe it to be the truth and then you
[1:43:01] confess not only your sin before him,
[1:43:04] but you confess him to others,
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; the Bible said the same shall be saved.
[1:43:09] Right.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; So, while he wasn't uh necessarily a
[1:43:12] believer like you or uh someone you
[1:43:16] could agree with everything that came
[1:43:18] out of his mouth, I don't know because I
[1:43:20] didn't hear everything that came out of
[1:43:22] his mouth. But I liked the fact that he
[1:43:25] believed that the youth, the heart of
[1:43:26] America is where the change was needed
[1:43:28] most.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; I like that. And while again uh I liked
[1:43:34] his dedication to scripture,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; he not only memorized it, but I believe
[1:43:39] he wrestled with it and he studied it
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; and I believe that to the best of his
[1:43:44] understanding, he made every effort to
[1:43:46] live by that.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; I liked his hunger for truth. Uh it was
[1:43:50] clear. I like the fact that he committed
[1:43:53] himself to understanding the Bible to be
[1:43:55] more than a history book,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; but as the living word that transforms
[1:43:59] hearts
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; and it can transform nations.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I like the fact that he studied original
[1:44:05] languages.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; He loved Hebrew. He loved the Jewish
[1:44:08] people. He loved the nation of Israel.
[1:44:11] That's right.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; He publicly declared
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; to every person who would listen
[1:44:18] that he believed in Israel's right to
[1:44:21] exist. He actually loved the Hebrew
[1:44:24] language. An apostolic Acts 238 believer
[1:44:28] posted a testimony. I wasn't there. I
[1:44:31] don't know if it's true, but he posted a
[1:44:33] testimony saying that he knew very well
[1:44:36] one of the pastors of Charlie Kirk who
[1:44:38] had and that he had personally struggled
[1:44:40] for some time concerning scriptures that
[1:44:42] he read about the Holy Ghost and talking
[1:44:45] in tongues.
[1:44:47] He went to a pastor and the pastor said,
[1:44:50] "If it says it in the word, you said
[1:44:52] I've heard you say we have to believe
[1:44:54] it. And the only requirement for
[1:44:56] receiving it is to believe it with all
[1:44:59] of your heart.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; That pastor testified publicly that he
[1:45:05] Charlie Kirk had experienced the very
[1:45:07] thing that he was struggling with. I
[1:45:09] wasn't there. I don't know. But I like
[1:45:13] the idea
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; that if you're reading it and you find
[1:45:18] it and you don't understand it, you ask
[1:45:20] God to help you believe it. and then you
[1:45:23] open up your heart to receive it.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Some of you may pretend like you don't
[1:45:28] know who we're talking about.
[1:45:31] I doubt that that is for most of us the
[1:45:33] case.
[1:45:35] I like the fact that he wasn't just
[1:45:38] looking at the scripture from a surface
[1:45:40] value. I heard him say multiple times, I
[1:45:43] had to change my interpretation, he
[1:45:45] said, because I found out it meant more
[1:45:48] than what I thought it meant. Would
[1:45:50] every one of us benefit from having that
[1:45:52] kind of an attitude?
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, show me more about the original
[1:45:56] intention of your word.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; His sudden death reminds us we don't
[1:46:01] control our days,
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; but we do control our obedience.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy, I think I gave it to you
[1:46:07] just for the people to look at real
[1:46:09] quick. 2 Timothy 2:15. Is that what
[1:46:11] you're going to preach about? It's just
[1:46:13] the introduction. And I'm not doing it
[1:46:14] because I want to. I'm doing it because
[1:46:16] I felt like I had to. study to show
[1:46:19] thyself approved unto God.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; A workman that needeth not to be
[1:46:24] ashamed, rightly discerning, rightly
[1:46:28] dividing
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; the word of truth. Lord,
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; That word divides opinion
[1:46:35] from truth and reality.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Let's look at it in the amplified. Study
[1:46:42] and be eager and do your utmost to
[1:46:46] present yourself to God approved, tested
[1:46:49] by trial, a workman who has no cost to
[1:46:52] be ashamed, correctly analyzing and
[1:46:54] accurately dividing, rightly handling
[1:46:58] and skillfully teaching
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; the word of truth.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; I happen to believe that that's exactly
[1:47:06] what he was trying to do.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I liked his boldness and his courage. I
[1:47:10] like the fact that even they told him
[1:47:12] multiple times, "We're going to kill
[1:47:13] you. We're going to kill you. We're
[1:47:14] going to kill you." He didn't let that
[1:47:16] put him in a cave.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't let that put him in a commune
[1:47:19] on the back side of the desert.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to reach the youth, I have
[1:47:23] to go to where the youth are.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. He didn't hide
[1:47:28] his faith behind politics either
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; or culture.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; But he boldly declared it even if it
[1:47:34] wasn't popular.
[1:47:36] He listened to others, weighed their
[1:47:38] words, but never let the voice of man
[1:47:40] drown out drown out the voice of God.
[1:47:43] So, if I had to pick a scripture, and
[1:47:44] I'm done with this. If I had to pick a
[1:47:47] scripture that I believe is appropriate
[1:47:50] to the life that I knew of Charlie Kirk,
[1:47:54] it would be Romans 1:16. For I am not
[1:47:57] ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it
[1:47:59] is the power of God unto salvation to
[1:48:01] everyone that believeth, to the Jew
[1:48:03] first, and also to the Greek. Right.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Someone reached out to my wife because
[1:48:07] she made a post, passed something along
[1:48:09] and uh uh or or because of a post they
[1:48:12] made. Maybe she reached to them, but the
[1:48:15] the comment was was basically made. I
[1:48:18] you know, I don't think that he was
[1:48:19] displaying the the quality of a of a
[1:48:22] true Christian. Well, first of all,
[1:48:24] we're not supposed to be judging the
[1:48:26] motives of anybody's heart.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; That's up to the master.
[1:48:32] But my wife just said, "Can I can I ask
[1:48:34] what? Can I may I just Yeah. I said, 'Go
[1:48:36] ahead. So, she asked this person, "Uh,
[1:48:39] in what way are you talking about?"
[1:48:40] Well, I don't think he was always meek,
[1:48:42] and I don't think he was always kind,
[1:48:44] and I don't always think he was humble.
[1:48:46] I said, 'Honey, why don't you tell them
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; that the same Jesus who said, "Blessed
[1:48:53] are the peacemakers
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; is the same Jesus that went into his
[1:48:58] father's house with a platted whip
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; and drove out not the not the sinner,
[1:49:03] but the religious hypocrite
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; for making a merchandise of God's
[1:49:07] house."
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; There's a time to be meek and mild.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; That's the only Jesus that America's
[1:49:13] interested in. That's right. One who is
[1:49:15] meek and mild. But as the old song used
[1:49:18] to say, this old world has seen the last
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; of the meek and the lowly. Jesus.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; The one who's coming the next time is
[1:49:26] coming in the power of his kingdom.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that, read the
[1:49:31] book.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; He's coming to settle the score.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Scripture said so. The greatest battle
[1:49:39] ever fought in the Middle East is going
[1:49:41] on at the time of the second coming of
[1:49:43] our Lord to the Mount of Olives. He
[1:49:45] basically brings an end to a war between
[1:49:48] the the the children of darkness and the
[1:49:51] children of light. It has gone on so
[1:49:54] long uh then that there's going to be
[1:49:56] blood running
[1:49:58] like rivers
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; through the Megiddo Valley.
[1:50:03] Some theologians identify this as the
[1:50:06] battle of Armageddon.
[1:50:08] Quite similar to the battle of Ezekiel
[1:50:10] 38 and39, the battle of Gog and Mog. so
[1:50:14] much blood running that the only way to
[1:50:17] deal with the unsanitary environment of
[1:50:20] the dead bodies will be that the master
[1:50:22] himself,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; will call for the fowls of the air
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; to come and consume the carcasses of
[1:50:31] those who lay dead.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Blood running to the horse's bridal.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just quoting scripture.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the book said.
[1:50:41] Yeah.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; And uh all of a sudden in the heat of
[1:50:44] the battle,
[1:50:46] people are running. Those who have not,
[1:50:49] you know, received their their
[1:50:51] translation,
[1:50:52] they're running to the mountains and
[1:50:55] they're crying out that the rock should
[1:50:57] fall upon them and cover them. It's a
[1:51:00] awful hard time.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a very difficult three
[1:51:03] and a half years on planet Earth. You
[1:51:06] believe that?
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; You're with the Lord. I hope you're with
[1:51:09] the Lord. I pray he came the first time
[1:51:12] to redeem his bride. The second time to
[1:51:15] catch his bride.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Uh translate her. And the third time he
[1:51:19] comes with his bride. Revelation 19.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; On a white horse.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; And the armies of heaven with him.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I'm just quoting the book.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And the armies of heaven with him on
[1:51:33] white horses.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine this great battle going
[1:51:37] on out there? Blood everywhere. Dead
[1:51:39] bodies everywhere. The Bible said so.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I think it's metaphoric. I don't
[1:51:44] think you have to call birds to come and
[1:51:47] eat metaphoric carcasses.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; I don't think Jesus has to do that.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; I believe what the book says. Can you
[1:51:55] imagine this heated battle going on
[1:51:56] between nations and kingdoms of light
[1:51:58] and darkness and all of a sudden the
[1:52:00] skies fill up with angel armies? It
[1:52:04] looks like
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; saints on white horses and the master,
[1:52:07] the king of kings. Read it for yourself.
[1:52:09] Revelation 19, faithful and true. Here
[1:52:12] he comes.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I think that'd put a stop to anybody's
[1:52:17] fuss.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Puts his foot down on the Mount of
[1:52:22] Olives.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; And the Jewish people that have forsaken
[1:52:25] him, all these generations look and say,
[1:52:27] "What are these scars in your hands?"
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; And according to the prophecy of
[1:52:31] Zachchariah, he says, "This is that
[1:52:33] which I received in the household of my
[1:52:34] friends." and they receive him as the
[1:52:38] Messiah.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; I've met Jewish people in Israel who
[1:52:41] will tell you there's only one
[1:52:42] difference between you and I. You've
[1:52:44] received now imagine this now. You
[1:52:47] received the Messiah the first time he
[1:52:49] came and we'll receive him the second
[1:52:51] time he comes. And I said, "Yes, but do
[1:52:53] we necessarily believe that he is the
[1:52:55] same?" And I've had some say, "No, we
[1:52:57] don't necessarily believe that." But
[1:52:59] more than that, I've had them say, "Yes,
[1:53:03] we believe he's the same.
[1:53:06] I said the same office or the same
[1:53:08] person? The same person.
[1:53:11] Now, that's pretty powerful.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; It's God's plan.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; It's God's plan. It's what the scripture
[1:53:18] says. I'm not sure why you're quiet.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; So, we're in quite an hour.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; We're in quite an hour. I'm thankful
[1:53:26] that uh this man was not ashamed of the
[1:53:29] gospel. I I pray you and I will not be
[1:53:31] ashamed of the gospel.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray that we will will tell the
[1:53:34] truth no matter what it cost us
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; and that we won't hide. I pray that we
[1:53:40] won't change the way we dress, the way
[1:53:42] we live, the way we look, the way we act
[1:53:44] because society says that it's not the
[1:53:47] way it ought to be done today.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; I think we ought to be getting a farther
[1:53:52] away from the world
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; in the way we conduct ourselves,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; but not in the way we live this life.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:02] If we if we live it on 50 acres and lock
[1:54:04] the door
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; and we're not fulfilling the last
[1:54:08] commission,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; which is to go and be a light,
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; you got to tell somebody that when the
[1:54:14] whole world is wild,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; there's peace in Christ.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when everybody else is
[1:54:22] insane in this last hour, that God's got
[1:54:25] a people.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Great peace have they which
[1:54:29] love the law of God.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; And nothing shall by any means offend
[1:54:33] them.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And he said, those who keep their mind
[1:54:36] on me,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; he said, I will give them what?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Perfect peace.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Someone said, well, here we come to camp
[1:54:46] meeting and it's going to be a very
[1:54:48] difficult time. It's going to be a very
[1:54:50] hard time. We're all going to be
[1:54:52] burdened down. We're all going to be
[1:54:54] thinking about what happened last year.
[1:54:56] You can if you want to,
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; but you will miss God's appointment with
[1:55:04] you now.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I see. I'm going to have to help myself.
[1:55:11] Amen.
[1:55:13] To live in the past would be to give the
[1:55:17] enemy more credit
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; than he deserves.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Are hearts still aching? They are. But
[1:55:25] camp meeting didn't do it.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; The devil did it.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Selfishness did it.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; So why in the world would we want to
[1:55:36] magnify and amplify him?
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Aren't you going to
[1:55:41] allow us? You grieve all you want to at
[1:55:44] home.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; But when you come to the house of God,
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; you better bring your shine with you
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; because lives are at stake.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; If you believe I'm being too harsh, you
[1:56:02] wouldn't have liked the sermons of
[1:56:03] Jesus.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let the dead bury the dead.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; You follow me."
[1:56:09] I think I'm sounding kind of merciful at
[1:56:11] the moment.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I just don't want you to let that be the
[1:56:16] object of your conversation. I've heard
[1:56:18] it four, five, six times already.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; And you're not doing yourself justice.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Neither are you serving her memory
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; with love and justice.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; You're giving attention to to darkness
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; and not to light. Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Again, we hurt, we grieve, we love,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; but we don't redefine camp meeting.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; We were having camp meeting uh for feast
[1:56:50] of tabernacles
[1:56:52] way before a tragedy.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And it's only if you allow it to be what
[1:56:58] you what what what permeates your mind.
[1:57:01] Some of us are not afforded that
[1:57:03] pleasure because we have to keep
[1:57:05] fighting
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; for you to have a place to reach up to.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Now, uh we're praying, of course, for
[1:57:17] those closest to this painful thing. Of
[1:57:20] course, I have. I've certainly done my
[1:57:22] part. I hope you have.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will help every
[1:57:26] one of them. But for us all to adopt
[1:57:28] that, to carry that, for it to become a
[1:57:31] matter of conversation among us in the
[1:57:33] nurseries, in our gatherings, I think
[1:57:35] that is overboard. I think we're
[1:57:37] absolutely missing the day of
[1:57:39] visitation, if we do such a thing as
[1:57:41] that.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm interested, Brother Daniel, in
[1:57:46] the fact that Charlie Kirk had an
[1:57:48] organization that was called Turning
[1:57:50] Point
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; USA. Yes, sir.
[1:57:54] Well, that really strikes a note in me.
[1:57:58] And
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. Because when this
[1:58:00] prophetic burden that I've been carrying
[1:58:03] now for a few months, when it fell on
[1:58:05] me, the Lord gave me a very similar kind
[1:58:09] of of phrase. I'm going to skip ahead.
[1:58:13] He spoke to me one one afternoon in
[1:58:15] prayer and he said, "My people are
[1:58:18] coming to a divine pivot."
[1:58:23] Well, I thought I knew what a pivot was,
[1:58:25] but I thought I better def I better make
[1:58:27] sure I get the right understanding of
[1:58:30] what a pivot is. A divine pivot. Let Let
[1:58:34] me read first a definition of a turning
[1:58:36] point. Turning point is a rich metaphor,
[1:58:40] a place or moment when things change
[1:58:44] direction.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; I I like turning points then. I'm for
[1:58:52] turning points in God. Turning points
[1:58:55] are divine, often painful,
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; but they can usher in new levels of
[1:59:01] purpose.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Destinies
[1:59:04] forfeited, but now reclaimed
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and fulfilled.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Does that sound good to anybody?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Scrolls that floated by, now reclaimed,
[1:59:17] reactivated, or rerouted. But the
[1:59:21] purposes of God march on.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody say glory. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The truth.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; The truth.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; If any of us come to a place where we
[1:59:33] believe the truth is hanging on us.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; We need to understand the truth isn't
[1:59:38] hanging on us, neither is it waiting for
[1:59:41] us.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; It's moving forward all the time.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; And if you want to stay with it, you
[1:59:48] can. Amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; You just have to march.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; You have to march when you feel like
[1:59:53] marching. And you have to march when you
[1:59:55] don't feel like marching.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; You have to march when you understand
[1:59:58] the orders. And you have to march when
[2:00:01] you don't feel like understanding the
[2:00:02] order. You don't understand the orders.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; But you march on because truth marches
[2:00:06] on. Because the pillar of fire moves on.
[2:00:09] Because the cloud of glory moves on.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet tells us that God
[2:00:13] himself is constantly unfolding himself.
[2:00:17] That's right.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; We don't even yet know all we're going
[2:00:20] to know about who he is,
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; but we keep following him and we learn
[2:00:24] more about him the more time we spend in
[2:00:26] his presence. Anybody here?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Good. I'm just getting started.
[2:00:32] Turning point. A turning point is I'll
[2:00:35] come to mine in a moment. A turning
[2:00:37] point is when perspective change. When
[2:00:40] perspective changes. It may be a crisis.
[2:00:43] It could be a death, a moment of loss.
[2:00:46] But it can also be just a fresh
[2:00:48] awakening
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; to the deep to the deep
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; calling on the inside. It's here of a
[2:00:56] true believer at the noise of thy water
[2:00:59] spouts.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; The deep calleth to the deep.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the call is louder than than
[2:01:06] other times.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's almost silent.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; And there are moments of refreshing from
[2:01:11] the spirit of the Lord. Acts tells us
[2:01:14] moments of refreshing and restitution
[2:01:16] from the spirit of the Lord. And in
[2:01:18] those moments, it awakens that call. It
[2:01:22] increases the volume of the deep to the
[2:01:25] deep call inside of the believer. So
[2:01:27] tragedy can cause a turning point,
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; but so can a spiritual awakening.
[2:01:33] Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; In fact, tragedy
[2:01:35] can cause a spiritual awakening.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't have to be tragic
[2:01:41] circumstances. When those moments come,
[2:01:44] if we can recognize them and come into
[2:01:48] agreement with them, into alignment with
[2:01:52] them by mixing our faith with the word
[2:01:56] of promise that's been proclaimed, then
[2:01:59] destinies once forfeited.
[2:02:02] Once squandered,
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; once we let them slip away from us,
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; they can be reclaimed,
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; renewed. Lord,
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; they can do exactly what the spirit of
[2:02:15] God spoke to us today. He wanted to
[2:02:17] wanted to do to magnify the inheritance
[2:02:21] of the promises over this house.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; And brother brother Shaw screams out
[2:02:26] harvest. And that's exactly what it is
[2:02:28] is a seed sown Yes.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Becomes
[2:02:34] a harvest.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; I will tell you that under under all of
[2:02:39] the evaluation that I have discovered
[2:02:42] concerning a martyr, he was he's a
[2:02:45] martyr.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He died for for morality, for faith.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; He died because he had very boldly
[2:02:55] declared
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; that there's two genders.
[2:02:59] Well, why didn't other people die?
[2:03:01] Because there are very few people that
[2:03:02] are going to say that in public
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; because they're afraid to.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; I see Christian people scraping their
[2:03:11] bumper stickers off
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; because they don't want to offend
[2:03:16] anybody.
[2:03:18] Well, I want you to know there's a time
[2:03:21] to be pe at peace and there's a time to
[2:03:23] offend.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know if I
[2:03:27] believe that or not. I just believe what
[2:03:28] the book says."
[2:03:30] He said, "Think not that I've only come
[2:03:32] to bring peace."
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; There are families that are set against
[2:03:38] each other because of truth.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I would to God that it were not that
[2:03:42] way.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; But but sometimes we're put in a
[2:03:44] decision where we have to make a choice
[2:03:46] for truth.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; And when that decision comes, we've got
[2:03:49] to find the grace and strength in the
[2:03:51] Lord to stand for truth. We want to do
[2:03:54] everything we can to strengthen family
[2:03:55] bonds. We want to do everything we can
[2:03:57] to build relationships and cast out
[2:03:59] wedges.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; But there may come a time.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; There may come a time, it may be your
[2:04:06] cousin who decides all of a sudden she's
[2:04:08] a man.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; It may be your niece,
[2:04:14] your nephew who wants to bring his
[2:04:17] partner, her partner
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; to the family uh cabin
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; for a holiday.
[2:04:26] You may have to eventually make a stand.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody said that's not love. Well, I
[2:04:31] tell you, there's a time
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; to send and spend all the love that you
[2:04:36] possibly have.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; There's a time to put bait on the hook
[2:04:39] and try to catch somebody from the
[2:04:41] snares of the enemy.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; There's also a time to snatch them out
[2:04:45] of the flames of hell by the power of
[2:04:48] the Holy Ghost that says, "The word is
[2:04:52] my absolute.
[2:04:54] Anybody
[2:04:55] with me?
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; I appreciate it very much. When those
[2:04:59] moments come,
[2:05:01] those turning points, they they they're
[2:05:04] all through the Bible, scripture full.
[2:05:07] Saul to David, when the leadership
[2:05:10] shifted from Saul to David, I'd say that
[2:05:13] was a turning point. When the prodigal
[2:05:16] returned home
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; after living out there with the swine,
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; I would say that that was a a turning
[2:05:23] point when Esther
[2:05:26] was presented with this mandate
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; for such a time as this.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; I love what Mori said.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; How do we know, paraphrasing, how do we
[2:05:39] know but that you were brought to the
[2:05:42] kingdom for for such a time as this? But
[2:05:44] it was like, "However,
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; don't despair
[2:05:50] because God will raise up deliverance."
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; I hope you hear this.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; God will raise up deliverance from
[2:05:58] another source.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; If you won't say yes, God will find
[2:06:01] somebody who has an eternal yes.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hear me now.
[2:06:07] If you won't surrender to the word, God
[2:06:09] will find somebody.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; If you won't put your house in order,
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; God will find somebody
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; that'll put their house in order.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; How do you know that? Cuz the word said
[2:06:24] so.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; I like boldness.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; There's a place for it.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; I like courage.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; There's a place for it. The Lord gave me
[2:06:35] a phrase as I mentioned just a moment
[2:06:37] ago when this current prophetic burden
[2:06:39] began to fall. The word was a divine
[2:06:41] pivot and he said for some it would be a
[2:06:44] crossroads of faith. A divine pivot is
[2:06:47] often marked. It's very similar to a
[2:06:49] turning point but not exactly the same.
[2:06:52] A divine pivot is often marked by
[2:06:54] urgency, by clarity and the undeniable
[2:06:58] witness of the Holy Ghost. If if the
[2:07:01] Holy Ghost hasn't witnessed to your
[2:07:03] heart, if you're part of this body and
[2:07:05] the Holy Ghost has not witnessed to your
[2:07:07] heart that we're at a moment like that,
[2:07:10] I encourage you to pray a little more.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Turn your attention a little more toward
[2:07:15] the Lord. As I said a moment ago, a
[2:07:17] little little away from the internet and
[2:07:19] from the things that that steal our time
[2:07:22] and see if he won't help you to
[2:07:23] understand. We're in a moment right now
[2:07:26] that must be marked. It's a moment that
[2:07:28] has it's a moment in time that has to be
[2:07:31] marked.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; It has to be sanctified, which means set
[2:07:34] apart. It has to be acknowledged
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; to be the same to be that this is God's
[2:07:40] dealings with our heart. And we have to
[2:07:43] position ourselves
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; so that whatever it is that he's about
[2:07:47] to do,
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; that you're not in his way.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; I've made bold statements. I've said if
[2:07:56] you can't position yourself, if this is
[2:07:59] more than you can take, I'm sure you
[2:08:02] could find your place
[2:08:05] somewhere else.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; This has never been about numbers for
[2:08:12] me.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; It has always been about preparing a
[2:08:18] people.
[2:08:21] When I was just a young man and I saw by
[2:08:24] vision that bride
[2:08:26] being ravished,
[2:08:29] when I saw her wedding garment that she
[2:08:32] had so carefully picked out with
[2:08:36] modesty,
[2:08:38] she she strived to have something modest
[2:08:43] and elegant and beautiful. I saw this in
[2:08:45] vision and then when I saw that there
[2:08:48] were doctors,
[2:08:52] physicians
[2:08:54] who had come in and had in her moment of
[2:08:57] sickness, her weakness, she was now in
[2:09:00] bed and they had come in and uh
[2:09:05] literally ripped up her garment, ripped
[2:09:08] up her wedding preparation.
[2:09:11] And when the Lord,
[2:09:14] the angel, moved into that setting,
[2:09:18] he took pieces of that garment and
[2:09:21] distributed it to several who were
[2:09:24] standing there. I was one of those. I
[2:09:28] accepted that commission not as the
[2:09:30] commission, the only commission, the
[2:09:33] only one. No, it that's not how it was
[2:09:36] represented in the vision. But I took
[2:09:38] that very seriously. And I knew that
[2:09:41] somehow someway somewhere I would
[2:09:45] certainly play a role in trying to
[2:09:48] preserve
[2:09:50] what had been given. The word that had
[2:09:52] been given now destroyed by intelligent,
[2:09:56] you know, brainiacs
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; who have approached the message of of
[2:10:00] the hour from an intellectual point of
[2:10:02] view by by by causing people to be
[2:10:05] afraid of the spirit and afraid of the
[2:10:07] Holy Ghost and afraid of the gifts of
[2:10:09] the spirit and have told us silly things
[2:10:11] like they're done away with and it's all
[2:10:14] behind us and we now have the truth so
[2:10:16] we don't need these other things and
[2:10:18] that which is perfect has come and all
[2:10:21] the kinds of things that they've used to
[2:10:22] take away the spirituality of a bride.
[2:10:26] When the messenger himself said that
[2:10:29] that bride in the last days would be
[2:10:31] fully dressed in God's dress wear.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; He said the five-fold ministry
[2:10:38] was God's dressear.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Interesting, isn't it?
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; It is. It takes the ministry of
[2:10:45] apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,
[2:10:47] and evangelists to preserve the wedding
[2:10:50] garment, which is the re revelation of
[2:10:52] the word.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; To preserve it and to make sure that in
[2:10:56] the right time, she gets it back
[2:10:58] together
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; and she gets it on
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; so that she doesn't miss her
[2:11:02] appointment.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire to do is just obey
[2:11:07] God.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; I just want to obey God. So, if somebody
[2:11:11] gets their little feelings hurt along
[2:11:13] the way, let me go ahead right now and
[2:11:16] say, "I'm sorry.
[2:11:20] I'm in it.
[2:11:21] I'm sorry that we're still at a place
[2:11:24] like that
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; in 2025
[2:11:27] after serving the Lord all these years
[2:11:30] and being together as a congregation for
[2:11:32] 35 years that we still have to say to
[2:11:36] someone, I'm so sorry that you got your
[2:11:39] feelings hurt when the prophet keeps
[2:11:41] telling us over and over again, you're
[2:11:43] going to have to live above those
[2:11:44] feelings. Amen. That's right. Thank you,
[2:11:47] Lord.
[2:11:51] You ever get hurt? I do.
[2:11:54] But here's what I have learned. The
[2:11:57] quicker,
[2:11:59] the faster I can come back to joy.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody when I when things don't turn
[2:12:06] out the way I I thought they were going
[2:12:08] to turn out, I just get so beside
[2:12:10] myself,
[2:12:13] folks.
[2:12:19] pull it all back in. Yeah.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; You know, if some of you some of you
[2:12:23] some of who you are is out on get it all
[2:12:26] gathered back in so that you'll no
[2:12:28] longer be beside yourself, but you'll be
[2:12:31] all back together as a whole person and
[2:12:34] realize that life is going to bring
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; so many opportunities
[2:12:41] to sidetrack us, to disappoint us,
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; to give us hope deferred.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; But at some point, we have to make up
[2:12:48] our mind. I'm not going to hang out
[2:12:50] there overnight.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Not even overnight.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Not even overnight.
[2:12:59] I'm going to come back to joy.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Why would you want to do that?
[2:13:03] Because the Bible said the joy of the
[2:13:06] Lord.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; So, if you don't come back to joy as
[2:13:11] quickly as you possibly can, you're not
[2:13:13] going to get stronger.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Help me somebody.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to get weaker.
[2:13:19] And if there's one thing I know about
[2:13:20] the hour we're living in, the bride
[2:13:22] cannot afford to get any weaker.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; She must gain strength
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; because we're coming around that last
[2:13:31] curve.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; The finish line is in sight.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; And if you're going around here just
[2:13:39] hurting people on purpose,
[2:13:41] you need the Holy Ghost.
[2:13:48] If that's how you live your life and and
[2:13:50] call that, you know, I'm just setting
[2:13:51] people straight or giving a piece of my
[2:13:54] mind away.
[2:13:57] God didn't call you to do such a thing
[2:13:58] as that.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; You ought to be tender. You ought to be
[2:14:01] sensitive. I ought to be sensitive to
[2:14:03] somebody's feelings.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; But the truth is the truth is the truth
[2:14:08] is the truth is the truth is the truth
[2:14:10] is the truth.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; And truth must be told
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; and truth must be lived. So, while we
[2:14:16] while we don't believe that it's right
[2:14:18] to pet our wounds and and be jealous of
[2:14:21] one another, I I mean to tell you
[2:14:24] something. It's a sad thing for me to
[2:14:26] realize that folks are still consumed
[2:14:29] with envy and jealousy
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; at rapture time.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to ch I'm going to show
[2:14:35] you very clearly, if you haven't already
[2:14:38] seen it, I'm going to make it very very
[2:14:40] clear for us. We're not going
[2:14:44] we're not going to be translated out of
[2:14:46] here with the attributes of unbelief.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; And envy and jealousy is an attribute of
[2:14:54] unbelief.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[2:15:00] Oh Lord, give us pastors after your
[2:15:03] heart.
[2:15:04] Oh Lord, give us kind old doting
[2:15:08] grandfathers who will tell us how
[2:15:10] wonderful we are.
[2:15:13] And then somebody rises up and says,
[2:15:14] "No, I'd like to have a prophetic
[2:15:16] voice." Until they have one,
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; and then they'd rather have
[2:15:28] they'll come and ask your thoughts.
[2:15:29] They'll ask what the scripture says.
[2:15:31] They'll ask how you feel. and then
[2:15:33] before they ever get off the property,
[2:15:37] make the exact opposite of a decision.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to catch up on us one day.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to catch up on us one day.
[2:15:47] May God give us all grace and help.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; It's time for a divine pivot.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; It's time for every one of us to have
[2:15:54] our own personal turning point.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, let this be. You do
[2:15:59] believe. You do believe. Let me let me
[2:16:00] read this to you. Acts chapter 9. I need
[2:16:03] a few more minutes. Acts chapter 9:es
[2:16:05] 1-9. And Saul, Sha in Hebrew, Shaul, yet
[2:16:11] breathing out threatenings and slaughter
[2:16:14] against the disciples of the Lord went
[2:16:17] unto the high priest. Who is this?
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Shaul. Saul.
[2:16:25] Saul.
[2:16:27] who would become Paul,
[2:16:31] the greatest apostle
[2:16:33] of all times. Many people say
[2:16:39] there are certain elements of the
[2:16:41] messianic movement that really don't
[2:16:43] like Paul
[2:16:46] because under the inspiration of the
[2:16:48] Lord as a first church age messenger, he
[2:16:50] brought a balance between keeping rules
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; and building relationships with God.
[2:16:58] And that bothers some people because
[2:17:01] some of us are more comfortable if we've
[2:17:04] got all the rules written out for us
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; and we have rule police
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; to tell us when we infringe.
[2:17:13] But the apostle Paul believed according
[2:17:15] to the word. He believed that if you
[2:17:17] could have a change of heart,
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; you would find that faith and wholeness
[2:17:24] comes from intimacy and relationship
[2:17:27] with Jesus Christ.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Not from just keeping a set of
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; dos and don'ts.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; I believe in holiness.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; I believe men should dress like men and
[2:17:39] women should dress like women. Yes.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; I believe men should have good clean
[2:17:44] haircuts.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Nature should teach them that. Paul
[2:17:49] said, "And that women should have long
[2:17:52] hair." I believe the scripture when it
[2:17:54] says, "And that long hair is given her
[2:17:56] for a reason."
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; It's given her for a reason. More than
[2:18:00] one reason. I believe that's what the
[2:18:02] Bible said. So, I believe in separation.
[2:18:06] But what I don't believe in is when we
[2:18:08] get to a place where we are judging one
[2:18:10] another
[2:18:12] because we don't all have exactly the
[2:18:14] same thought about every little detail.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Now in a community of faith in a body of
[2:18:19] believers, we have an obligation.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; To keep peace and unity
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; and sometimes that means if meat maketh
[2:18:27] my brother to offend,
[2:18:30] I'm just quoting the book.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; I love it when the book gets us. Don't
[2:18:36] you?
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; I love it when I've made up my mind and
[2:18:39] the word comes and says,
[2:18:42] then what do we do? We have to change
[2:18:44] our mind.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; If meat maketh my brother to offend,
[2:18:50] the apostle said, "I'll eat no more
[2:18:51] meat."
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; This was meat, of course, that was being
[2:18:55] used and dedicated to idols. He said,
[2:18:57] "But that's going to be a problem for
[2:18:59] those who are weak." He said, "I won't
[2:19:00] do it anymore. My desire is to be able
[2:19:03] to reach somebody. Amen.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; And if something I do that I don't
[2:19:07] really have to do
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; is offensive to somebody else.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; My I think I'm sounding
[2:19:19] like I'm mad and I'm not. Not at all.
[2:19:23] I've been in the presence of the Lord
[2:19:25] with you. How could you be mad at
[2:19:26] anybody? But the word, the word deals
[2:19:29] with us sometime in strong and strange
[2:19:31] ways,
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; especially when we come to divine pivots
[2:19:34] and turning points.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; And Saul is breathing out threatenings
[2:19:37] and slaughters against the disciples of
[2:19:40] the Lord. In other words, the church,
[2:19:42] the Christians,
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; went unto the high priest,
[2:19:48] and desired of them letters
[2:19:51] desired of him letters to Damascus, to
[2:19:54] the synagogue. Let's take this on into
[2:19:56] Syria.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; That if he found any of
[2:20:02] this way,
[2:20:06] you know, this is how the Christians
[2:20:08] identified themselves
[2:20:10] in the beginning. They were followers of
[2:20:14] of the way.
[2:20:17] would have been a lot simpler,
[2:20:19] less complicated if we could have just
[2:20:23] kept joining ourselves to the way.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; But we all have this desire
[2:20:30] to wear a brand
[2:20:32] like cattle so that we can be identified
[2:20:35] as belonging to to something on earth
[2:20:39] when the reality is our citizenship is
[2:20:41] not of this world.
[2:20:45] So, I'm certainly not going to strut
[2:20:47] around and tell somebody I'm a
[2:20:48] Brandomite.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's as offensive to God as it would
[2:20:51] to be to brother Brandon if he was
[2:20:52] alive.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to run around and tell
[2:20:55] somebody I'm this or that or the other.
[2:20:57] I'm a Christian, a Bible believing
[2:20:59] Christian. don't always get it right,
[2:21:01] but I'm I'm pushing toward being able to
[2:21:03] do that because that's what the way and
[2:21:05] and if you want to label me uh other
[2:21:07] than being a part of the Christian way,
[2:21:10] then I'd like to know I'd like to be
[2:21:11] known as a Berean.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; I'd like to be known as somebody who
[2:21:15] doesn't swallow everything that somebody
[2:21:17] says.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; But I go back to the book
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; and make sure that it's also the word.
[2:21:24] That's right.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you've got an
[2:21:27] absolute
[2:21:29] And so he wanted letters to go down into
[2:21:32] Damascus to Syria and start seeing if he
[2:21:36] could find any of those traitors who
[2:21:39] were still fellowshipping at the
[2:21:42] synagogue but had accepted the faith of
[2:21:45] Jesus of Yeshua.
[2:21:47] I'm going to see whether they're men or
[2:21:49] women. He might bring them bound unto
[2:21:52] Jerusalem. I'm telling you, he wanted to
[2:21:54] bring them in chains.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; To Jerusalem. Let's read on. And as he
[2:21:59] journeyed, he came near Damascus. And
[2:22:01] suddenly there shine round about him a
[2:22:04] light from heaven.
[2:22:06] And he fell to the earth. And he heard a
[2:22:09] voice saying unto him, Sha Sha, why
[2:22:13] persecutest thou me?
[2:22:19] And he said,
[2:22:21] Who art thou
[2:22:23] Adonai?
[2:22:26] Who art thou, Lord?
[2:22:28] I don't know exactly who you are, but I
[2:22:31] know you're somebody that I ought to
[2:22:33] know.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, master, you seem to be somewhere
[2:22:38] above me. Who are you? And the Lord
[2:22:43] said, hallelujah.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that it didn't come in a
[2:22:47] mystery. Well, I am that one or I am
[2:22:50] that I am or I am the one you're look.
[2:22:53] I'm so glad that he just came right out
[2:22:56] and said, "I am Yeshua."
[2:22:58] [Applause]
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; If he were to have said Jesus, nobody
[2:23:03] there would have known who he was
[2:23:04] talking about, including Shaul,
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I am Yeshua,
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; which means salvation. I am the one to
[2:23:14] save. I am the promised one." And in
[2:23:18] English we would say, I am Jesus whom
[2:23:22] thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to
[2:23:26] kick against the pricks. Somebody is
[2:23:29] getting a turning point. Somebody is
[2:23:32] getting a divine pivot.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody is going to have a change.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Because you're not persecuting a church.
[2:23:40] You're not just persecuting uh some
[2:23:43] stragglers of the faith. It's me.
[2:23:47] And I better go ahead and let you know
[2:23:49] that if you think it's been hard up to
[2:23:51] this point, you're you now know who
[2:23:53] you're kicking against
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; and it's going to get harder from here
[2:23:56] on out. Can you imagine this kind of
[2:23:59] language?
[2:24:01] In fact, one of the things we believe
[2:24:02] Shaul was using against the believers,
[2:24:05] those who were a part of the way, was he
[2:24:07] was telling them, "Ah, you are one of
[2:24:09] those who believes he was raised from
[2:24:10] the dead." Wow. I never saw him.
[2:24:17] I wouldn't believe it unless I saw him.
[2:24:20] Did you know there was a there was uh in
[2:24:22] the early church, the church of
[2:24:24] Jerusalem, we understand from history
[2:24:26] there there was a requirement
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; that to be a voice in the in the church,
[2:24:32] the early church to be a voice, you you
[2:24:34] had to be a disciple or what maybe we
[2:24:36] would call today an apostle. And in
[2:24:38] order to be that, you had to have seen
[2:24:41] the Lord.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Sha didn't see him
[2:24:48] until his divine pivot,
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; until the day of his turning point,
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't qualify
[2:24:58] until that moment.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; And that day, he had to say with the
[2:25:02] rest of them, I've seen the Lord.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; I've seen the Lord. Amen.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; What if Peter would have got a religious
[2:25:09] spirit on him and said, "Yeah, well, you
[2:25:11] saw him. Haha. You didn't see him like
[2:25:13] we saw him?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; What if some of the other disciples
[2:25:17] would have said, "Oh, well, you didn't
[2:25:19] hunt with him and you didn't fish with
[2:25:21] him and
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; he didn't tell you secrets at sunset."
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. He saw him.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; All proof he needed. Somebody said, "Did
[2:25:33] he have the proof?" He sure did. He had
[2:25:36] the divine pivot.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; One moment he is fighting to persecute
[2:25:41] the way
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; and the next moment he's giving
[2:25:45] everything
[2:25:46] that he has to the way.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; He's telling everybody with boldness,
[2:25:53] come join the way.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; What changed your mind, Paul? Oh, I saw
[2:26:02] the Lord.
[2:26:04] He met me on the road to Damascus.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; He knocked me off of my onto my
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the
[2:26:20] pricks,
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; you religious
[2:26:24] zealot.
[2:26:27] You've dedicated your life to killing
[2:26:29] those who follow me.
[2:26:32] But that's only because
[2:26:36] I got a work for you to do.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; And you don't get to do the work until
[2:26:41] you run from it. You don't get to do
[2:26:44] God's business until first you've run
[2:26:45] away from it.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; So there's hope for a lot of you.
[2:26:53] There's hope for a lot of us
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; who didn't do it originally. Right.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; I think I'll quote my grandmother and
[2:27:01] make some folks mad again. My granny
[2:27:04] used to say when people would come and
[2:27:06] say, "I'm called feel called to preach."
[2:27:07] She said, "Well, if I were you, I'd run
[2:27:08] as hard as I could the other way."
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; And they just look at her. You know, you
[2:27:13] can imagine these young men, they had
[2:27:14] respect for her and and you can just
[2:27:17] imagine the look on their faces when she
[2:27:19] said, "If I was you, I'd get out of it."
[2:27:22] Oh, it's like it was like sucking the
[2:27:24] air out of the room. It was like putting
[2:27:26] a pin in a in a needle in a in a
[2:27:28] balloon.
[2:27:30] They look so deflated. And and and
[2:27:33] finally one of them or two of them would
[2:27:34] get enough courage, you know, and they'd
[2:27:35] say, "Well, well, why is that?" You
[2:27:38] said, "Because if you're really called,
[2:27:40] you'll never be able to get away from
[2:27:41] it."
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; The call of God will follow you wherever
[2:27:44] you go.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; I believe Paul would say, "Amen."
[2:27:48] The call of God will catch you on your
[2:27:51] way
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; to do the devil's doings
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; and turn you around.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; I I I would love to believe for a
[2:27:59] turning point in our nation. I would
[2:28:02] love to believe for a divine pivot. But
[2:28:05] what I recognize is we have to rejoice
[2:28:08] in what little bit of light we see out
[2:28:11] there. But there is a turning point that
[2:28:15] I'm pursuing and there is a divine pivot
[2:28:18] that I'm working toward and that is the
[2:28:21] awakening.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Ephesians,
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; the awakening.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Awake thou that sleepest,
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; and arise from the dead. Ephesians 5:14.
[2:28:36] and Christ
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; shall give thee light.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting and believing and praying
[2:28:45] and giving my all to see the awakening
[2:28:48] of the bride.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; I want to see her coming out of her
[2:28:53] clicks. I want to see her coming out of
[2:28:55] her fractions. I want to factions and I
[2:28:59] I want to see her coming out of of her
[2:29:01] little uh you know isms and sisms and
[2:29:05] coming back to the absolute of
[2:29:06] scripture.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; I want to see her once and for all
[2:29:14] decide who God is and how many he is.
[2:29:17] and
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; get rid of this two two Lord stuff and
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; two soul stuff and
[2:29:26] all the craziness that people have have
[2:29:29] have done with the message of the hour
[2:29:31] in these years since 1965.
[2:29:35] I'd like to see them have an awakening.
[2:29:37] I'd like to see them say we're not we're
[2:29:38] going to we're not going to keep going
[2:29:40] along with something that we know has
[2:29:42] lost its life.
[2:29:44] There's people in this nation that are
[2:29:46] still dedicated to propping something up
[2:29:48] that God said a long time ago, I'm done
[2:29:50] with that order.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; That's Saul. I'm I'm done with the order
[2:29:53] of Saul.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; I've done got a David. I've done got a
[2:29:58] boy out in the field with a harp who
[2:29:59] loves me so much that he just as soon
[2:30:02] spend his whole day instead of spending
[2:30:04] his life telling about how good he is
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; and how good he's been
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; and what all he's accomplished.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; And how God built their church.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; I've done found me a little boy out
[2:30:17] there who'll sing all day and tell me
[2:30:19] how good I am as God and how much he
[2:30:22] loves his papa.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; The order is changing. Uh-huh.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; There's an awakening coming to the
[2:30:27] people. And those who once supported the
[2:30:30] Saul order are now going to recognize
[2:30:32] that their future and their destiny is
[2:30:34] not in the ministry of Saul,
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; but it's in the ministry of a psalmist.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Those who will praise, those who will
[2:30:41] worship God with every fiber of their
[2:30:43] being,
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; those who will cling to the word
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; and not opinion.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:53] And as he journeyed, okay, who art thou,
[2:30:55] Lord? I'm Jesus. And he trembling and
[2:30:59] astonished said, Lord, what will thou
[2:31:01] have me to do? And the Lord said unto
[2:31:02] him, Arise, and go into the city, and it
[2:31:06] shall be told thee what thou must do.
[2:31:08] And the men which journeyed with him
[2:31:10] stood speechless, hearing a voice, but
[2:31:11] seeing no man. And Saul arose from the
[2:31:15] earth, and when his eyes were opened, he
[2:31:17] saw no man.
[2:31:20] But they led him by the hand
[2:31:23] and brought him to Damascus,
[2:31:26] and he was three days without sight, and
[2:31:32] neither did eat nor drink. Now, if I had
[2:31:34] time, I'd go and read the rest of that
[2:31:36] chapter. We can't do it this morning.
[2:31:38] You can do it later, and you'll find out
[2:31:40] that God always works on both ends of
[2:31:42] the line. Amen.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Anybody listening?
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; God always works on both ends of the
[2:31:48] thing. God's working on Shaul
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; and God's working on an Ananas.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; And Ananas had been shaking in his
[2:31:56] sandals. And his little faith community
[2:31:58] had been shaking in their sandals
[2:32:00] because they heard that there was a
[2:32:01] religious Pharisee named Shaul that was
[2:32:04] coming to bind them all up and take them
[2:32:06] to Jerusalem.
[2:32:08] Right.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; And the Lord begins to speak to that
[2:32:13] that one ananas.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Go lay your hands.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, brother brother Saul?
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; I'm here in the name of the Lord to lay
[2:32:27] hands on you
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; when you've been hearing for for weeks
[2:32:30] and weeks that he would go in lay his
[2:32:33] hands on the people of the way and drag
[2:32:35] them to Jerusalem to be tried.
[2:32:38] And now just little old Ananas
[2:32:41] is going to be used of God.
[2:32:44] Am I right?
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; To be laid to lay his hands on the on
[2:32:49] the great fear feared and dreaded Shaul
[2:32:53] who would become the respected and
[2:32:55] revered Apostle Paul.
[2:32:58] And he used just a little believer just
[2:33:00] somebody in the way who could get the
[2:33:03] courage. That was not only a turning
[2:33:05] point. Please understand that not only
[2:33:08] did Saul receive a turning point, so did
[2:33:11] Ananas.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; A divine pivot.
[2:33:17] His fear drained, his courage regained.
[2:33:22] He was ready to do the work that God had
[2:33:24] called him to do.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; It's powerful, isn't it?
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Go into the city. There's nothing like
[2:33:29] coming into alignment. Now, give me
[2:33:31] these last few minutes. There's nothing
[2:33:33] like coming into alignment with God's
[2:33:35] timing.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Pivots are not random. Turning points
[2:33:40] are not random. They happen in God's
[2:33:43] chyros moments.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 3:1, to everything there's
[2:33:49] a season and a time to every purpose
[2:33:51] under the heaven.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Yes,
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; a divine pivot, a turning point alters
[2:33:58] the trajectory of a life, of a ministry,
[2:34:01] of a nation.
[2:34:03] Uh, I didn't give them these verses, but
[2:34:05] Jonah 3:10, "And God saw their works
[2:34:08] that they turned from their evil way.
[2:34:10] And God repented of the evil that he had
[2:34:12] said that he would do unto them, and he
[2:34:14] did it not." God said, "I'm going to
[2:34:18] destroy the city."
[2:34:21] Yona the dove,
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; I need you to fly down there to Nineveh
[2:34:27] and tell him that I'm going to destroy
[2:34:29] the city.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; And what did the dove do?
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; He flew the other way.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; He flew to Tarses.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; He was running from his call.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Fearful.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Let me just look around.
[2:34:53] running from the call that God had
[2:34:55] placed on his life.
[2:35:01] Zeliana asleep.
[2:35:05] Is it safe for me to sing? Who did?
[2:35:10] Who did?
[2:35:12] Who did swallow a joke?
[2:35:14] [Music]
[2:35:16] Who did?
[2:35:18] Who did
[2:35:20] the fish did?
[2:35:22] God prepared a fish.
[2:35:29] The Bible tell
[2:35:35] the whale did
[2:35:38] the whale did swallow Jo.
[2:35:42] The whale did swallow Jonah
[2:35:45] the whale did swallow Jonah
[2:35:49] down,
[2:35:50] didn't he? God prepared a fish.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "I go I'm going this
[2:35:57] way." And God said, "That's all right."
[2:36:01] The Bible says he went, and I love this
[2:36:04] part, he did what? He paid his own fair.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; God may let you temporarily squirm out
[2:36:10] of your destiny scroll.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; But may I tell you right now, it's going
[2:36:15] to cost you.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to pay your own way.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; And there are no refunds when you spend
[2:36:23] something running from the call of your
[2:36:26] life. Somebody said, "I'm not a preacher
[2:36:28] and I didn't make you one,
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; but you're a minister."
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Man, woman, boy, or girl, we're
[2:36:35] ministers. We are representatives. We
[2:36:38] are ambassadors
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; of the way,
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; of the truth,
[2:36:44] of the life.
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; So, something happened.
[2:36:51] Three days and three nights.
[2:36:55] Not three pieces of a day and three
[2:36:57] pieces of a night. Exactly what the
[2:37:00] scripture says. I know there are all
[2:37:03] kinds of websites out there that talk
[2:37:04] about Hebrew idioms. And what I have
[2:37:07] found out in in in at least 25 or 30
[2:37:11] years of studying Hebrew idioms is that
[2:37:14] it's like it's like the doctors
[2:37:19] when they don't know what to call it.
[2:37:23] They just give it a name.
[2:37:26] And when when a preacher doesn't know
[2:37:28] how to make the scripture sometimes fit
[2:37:30] his his text, his theme,
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; he'll just blame it on being a Hebrew
[2:37:36] idiom. But the problem is there are
[2:37:38] enough Hebrew scholars in the world to
[2:37:41] let us know that sometimes people are
[2:37:43] just making a stretch.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; But when the scripture says he was three
[2:37:46] days and three nights, that's exactly
[2:37:48] what it means. And it was so vitally
[2:37:51] important to mark something beautiful
[2:37:54] that would come in the future. And Jesus
[2:37:56] said himself that he himself would be in
[2:37:58] the heart of the earth the exact amount
[2:38:00] of time.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; It's just what the book says.
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; There was a purpose in all those things.
[2:38:07] There's always a purpose if we could
[2:38:09] follow the continuity of scripture. It's
[2:38:12] bigger than Google.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will help us and lead us
[2:38:17] if we have a desire. Uh if we have a
[2:38:20] desire, he's faithful, isn't he?
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Something happened to Jonah.
[2:38:26] It was a miracle
[2:38:29] that old fish opened up his mouth and
[2:38:32] spit him up on dry ground and he ran
[2:38:34] like a crazy man to get down there. That
[2:38:38] was a turning point.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; And guess what? The people heard him.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; Took him through a journey, several days
[2:38:45] to get through the entire city.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; Repent. Repent. Repent. Repent. And
[2:38:51] guess what?
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; They did. Yeah.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; And guess what happened?
[2:38:57] Jonah got mad.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; While some people get upset with the
[2:39:05] Lord for not bringing their word to
[2:39:07] pass.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Jonah got upset with God because he
[2:39:11] brought his word to pass.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; What Jonah prophesied hap happened in
[2:39:17] the sense that they heard the word
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; and they turned Hallelujah.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; To the truth
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; and then there would be no reason.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you know that the prophecies and
[2:39:30] prophetic promises of God, the the
[2:39:33] judgments of God, all of it has a
[2:39:35] redemptive purpose?
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; And the purpose of God ever saying the
[2:39:39] purpose of God ever saying, "I'm going
[2:39:41] to destroy this city was to get their
[2:39:44] attention." That's right.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; And to cause their hearts to turn toward
[2:39:47] him. And it worked.
[2:39:52] I'm sure there were church police
[2:39:56] who posted all over the internet,
[2:39:59] Jonah's a false prophet,
[2:40:02] just like they do today.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; But Jonah wasn't a false prophet.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; God meant what he said.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; He said what he meant.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; But the people turned.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; It was a turning point.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; It was a divine pivot. May you have one
[2:40:17] today
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; before you leave this place.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; I'm nearly done.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; There's something I know about a divine
[2:40:23] pivot or a spiritual turning point. And
[2:40:25] that that means that the obedience it
[2:40:28] has to be immedi immediate. It needs to
[2:40:30] be now. You can't keep putting up.
[2:40:34] Excuse me. You can't keep putting it
[2:40:35] off. Hebrews 3:15. today
[2:40:40] if you will hear his voice.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; Harden not your heart as in the
[2:40:45] provocation,
[2:40:47] the divine murmuring. That's where we
[2:40:49] were when we left off Tuesday night.
[2:40:51] That divine murmuring,
[2:40:54] those people who belly achd and grumbled
[2:40:57] and complained
[2:40:59] until they they all ate the same
[2:41:01] spiritual meat, drank the same spiritual
[2:41:03] drink. But with many of them, God was
[2:41:05] not pleased.
[2:41:07] They heard the same word,
[2:41:10] Hebrews 3 and4, but it it profited them
[2:41:13] little because they didn't do their
[2:41:15] part. And here's where it becomes very
[2:41:16] serious in this place.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; See, God's going to do something.
[2:41:24] He's always doing something.
[2:41:26] He's going to do something. We're at a
[2:41:29] divine pivot. We're at a holy turning
[2:41:31] point in this house.
[2:41:35] I believe it.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; I believe we're closer than we have ever
[2:41:39] been before
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; to seeing some of the things that God
[2:41:42] has told us we would see.
[2:41:45] And where you've got this some people
[2:41:47] have this mentality. Well, I'll I'll
[2:41:49] I'll I'll believe it when I see it. You
[2:41:52] may,
[2:41:53] but you may not see it
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; cuz this is the way it works sometime.
[2:42:03] today. You've got to hear his voice.
[2:42:06] You've got to make sure you don't harden
[2:42:07] your heart against it.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; You've got to say, "Lord, I'm ready to
[2:42:11] be used
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; in whatever way." Because when God sends
[2:42:15] a turning point, when God sends a divine
[2:42:17] pivot, and I would say I would say that
[2:42:21] according to the program of God, uh, the
[2:42:24] death of this of this young man could
[2:42:27] be, it could absolutely be in some
[2:42:31] measure. It could be the potential is
[2:42:34] there for a bit of a turning point
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; because while there will not be a
[2:42:41] national revival
[2:42:44] according to the prophet,
[2:42:46] there can be an awakening
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; and there can be a restoration
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; of calling people back to Bible faith
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; and uh you know every generation
[2:42:59] deserves an opportunity.
[2:43:02] Please understand that this is how I
[2:43:04] believe scripture and the message. If
[2:43:06] God delays,
[2:43:10] if God delays and another generation is
[2:43:15] born, God is obligated.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Because he's a merciful God. Yes.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; If if if God delays,
[2:43:27] even if it's based on something that
[2:43:29] someone did or didn't do, if God says
[2:43:33] one more 40-year lap around the mountain
[2:43:35] for y'all,
[2:43:39] remember, they didn't go in until the
[2:43:42] old generation had died off.
[2:43:48] If God delays and another generation
[2:43:51] arises on the scene, I personally
[2:43:54] believe that God's word has obligated
[2:43:57] him to visit that generation. Right.
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; I I know people I know people who live
[2:44:06] uh less than a 100 miles from this
[2:44:09] church who believed
[2:44:12] and may still believe
[2:44:15] that mercy ended
[2:44:18] in 1977.
[2:44:24] I met one who told me that it ended. He
[2:44:29] he said we first thought it ended in 63
[2:44:34] when the seals came but then he said we
[2:44:36] we thought well if if I predict he said
[2:44:39] he said I predict it'll all be over in
[2:44:41] 77. So then we began to realize that by
[2:44:43] 77 then regardless of what was happening
[2:44:46] in the world mercy would be over. And I
[2:44:49] I I said what about your children? Why
[2:44:52] Jimmy's daddy used to say it sister? You
[2:44:53] know he did.
[2:44:57] I said, 'What about your children?'
[2:44:59] Well, if they're born after 77.
[2:45:02] What about your grandchildren? Well,
[2:45:04] they're born after 77. I mean, you call
[2:45:06] that revelation. I think that's a
[2:45:09] hard-hearted man.
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; I think somebody has gotten a little too
[2:45:13] puffed up.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; He spent a little too much time staring
[2:45:18] at a cloud.
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; He could have been using some of that
[2:45:21] time to read the book.
[2:45:25] Amen.
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; So there's no chance. He was telling me,
[2:45:28] "My children are here and they're going
[2:45:30] to have children and now his
[2:45:33] grandchildren have children,
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus terries, his
[2:45:38] greatgrandchildren will have children."
[2:45:40] And you're going to tell me that God's
[2:45:42] finished and there's no more mercy and
[2:45:45] the bride is still here and we're just
[2:45:47] fighting our way through. I want you to
[2:45:49] know that is unholy baloney.
[2:45:53] I can't believe you said that in the
[2:45:55] pull pit. Well, that's exactly what it
[2:45:56] is. Be glad I said it that nice.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; It's just unholy baloney.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; If God delays for whatever reason he
[2:46:04] chooses, it's God. He's sovereign.
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; Even if it means we won't line up. If he
[2:46:10] says time is going to be extended, the
[2:46:12] prophet told us the rapture is overdue.
[2:46:17] If it was overdue in 65, how overdue do
[2:46:20] you think it is in 2025?
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; But if God delays, then I believe
[2:46:26] according to the nature of God in the
[2:46:28] word, he is obligated.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; I don't think he minds us saying he's
[2:46:32] obligated.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; He likes to stick with his book
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; to visit a generation.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:39] So what that means for us in this place
[2:46:41] is my children have a have a have a
[2:46:44] right it seems to see the kind of move
[2:46:47] of God,
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; the supernatural occurrences of God
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; in their gener in their life.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about out there across
[2:46:55] America. I'm talking about in churches
[2:46:57] that hold on to truth and believe that
[2:46:59] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:47:00] forever. They have an they should have
[2:47:02] an opportunity. I believe God wants them
[2:47:04] to have an opportunity
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; to have their spiritual eyes open to see
[2:47:08] the pillar of fire to be filled with the
[2:47:10] Holy Ghost.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Gley and I laughed. I did most
[2:47:13] of the laughing. He just nodded. Just,
[2:47:15] you know, nodded and and snickered or
[2:47:17] whatever he does.
[2:47:20] But when he when we were in the back,
[2:47:22] Benjamin was singing, uh, wouldn't take
[2:47:24] nothing for my journey now. I said,
[2:47:27] "Brother Gilly, listen to them whippers
[2:47:29] snappers.
[2:47:31] The journey. What are they 20?
[2:47:35] What kind of journey have you had at 22?
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; I said they are. You and I have had a
[2:47:42] journey.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "We sure have. We've been
[2:47:45] through it, hadn't we? We sure have. And
[2:47:47] we're here to tell you
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; that at the end of it all,
[2:47:54] it's worth the journey."
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:48:03] Amen.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it was my glasses and not my
[2:48:06] teeth.
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; They're real. Sorry. They're not going
[2:48:10] nowhere. They're glued in.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't take nothing from a journey.
[2:48:16] &gt;&gt; The reality is it doesn't matter how
[2:48:18] long your journey's been.
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; You realize that the grace and the
[2:48:25] presence of God makes the struggle.
[2:48:29] It makes the trial. It makes the
[2:48:32] heartache
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; worth it all.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[2:48:41] No, I didn't fall. I just knocked my
[2:48:43] glasses into the into eternity there
[2:48:45] almost and had to go grab them. And now
[2:48:48] they're spotted. Can you imagine?
[2:48:51] I I had a little encounter with the deer
[2:48:54] yesterday. I
[2:48:56] I used to laugh at my mama. Forgive me,
[2:48:58] Jesus.
[2:49:01] I used to laugh at my mom as she got
[2:49:03] older. She just loved animals. She was
[2:49:06] never an animal lover.
[2:49:08] But when she got older,
[2:49:11] everything was cute.
[2:49:14] I would go along with her until she
[2:49:16] tried to show me kittens.
[2:49:19] Then I'd say, "Mama,
[2:49:22] yes, they're cute now, but they're going
[2:49:23] to grow up to be cats.
[2:49:26] And you know how I feel about cats." So
[2:49:27] she'd turn the page and show me a dog.
[2:49:29] And I'd say, "All right, now we're now
[2:49:31] we're communicating."
[2:49:33] She said, "Don't you just love to see
[2:49:34] them nursing their mama?" And I said,
[2:49:36] "Well,
[2:49:38] but you know what?
[2:49:40] It happens.
[2:49:42] The older you get,
[2:49:45] the more you find yourself taking an
[2:49:47] extra minute
[2:49:49] to notice the things around you.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; I'll stand like this and watch a lizard.
[2:49:55] Yesterday, I stood in the backyard by
[2:49:57] myself. Praise the Lord. Don't happen
[2:49:59] enough
[2:50:02] cuz when I'm at home, usually somebody's
[2:50:04] at home. But when you can get the house
[2:50:06] all to yourself, it's nice on occasion.
[2:50:10] They was all showering. I knew they
[2:50:12] smelt better when they got back.
[2:50:15] But I just stood for a long time and
[2:50:16] watched this little lizard wiggle across
[2:50:18] the way. And I thought, "Look at me. I'm
[2:50:21] appreciating things." I was sitting
[2:50:24] there in my chair studying and I I saw
[2:50:26] the mama deer,
[2:50:29] poke her head up
[2:50:32] right out our bay window
[2:50:37] and I eased over to the sofa so I could
[2:50:40] be closer to the window and and she saw
[2:50:43] me.
[2:50:45] She raised up her head. No wonder that
[2:50:47] thing gets so out of whack.
[2:50:49] She raised up her head. She looked right
[2:50:51] at me. I started started talking to her
[2:50:53] through the window and she stayed.
[2:50:57] She wasn't even worried about me
[2:50:59] anymore. She just started eating the
[2:51:00] flowers.
[2:51:02] And I thought, well, I'm going to get
[2:51:03] her some corn. We've done it before in
[2:51:07] and even Elelliana's got got the chance
[2:51:09] to do it. Feed her figs off the tree and
[2:51:12] feed the little babies, too. They'll
[2:51:13] come. And these this is a a group of
[2:51:17] deer that have been in our neighborhood
[2:51:18] for five four or five or six or seven
[2:51:21] maybe even longer than that generations
[2:51:23] of of deer. So they're it's this little
[2:51:25] tame pack of deer that uh one lost his
[2:51:28] mother some many years ago and a
[2:51:29] neighbor raised that one in the yard and
[2:51:33] now it's gone off and and they keep
[2:51:35] having babies and bringing them back.
[2:51:37] And I went out there to feed feed had a
[2:51:40] had handful of corn and and she just
[2:51:42] comes and she lets me rub her head and
[2:51:44] yes I wash my hands after her but she
[2:51:47] lets me rub her head and I scratch under
[2:51:49] her chin and talk to her the whole time
[2:51:51] and I'm thinking, "Oh my I'm I I am my
[2:51:55] mama."
[2:51:57] I said, "Oh, darling, I'm so glad you
[2:51:59] came this morning." I'm just talking to
[2:52:01] her like that. So, I posted those
[2:52:03] pictures and Sister Green's nephew,
[2:52:07] Brother Perry Green's wife's nephew,
[2:52:09] posted and he said, "Oh, Brother
[2:52:11] Shelley, uh, Aunt Janice would have
[2:52:13] loved to. She fed all the critters in
[2:52:15] the desert and she would have loved to
[2:52:17] have seen a picture like that." And all
[2:52:20] of a sudden, when I read that comment, I
[2:52:22] could hear her voice a
[2:52:25] song. I could hear her singing, "It will
[2:52:29] be worth it all.
[2:52:34] When we see Jesus,
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; it will be worth it all when we see him.
[2:52:43] There's a place where it says earth's
[2:52:45] trials will seem as nothing.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that the prize is worth
[2:52:56] the press.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The victory is worth the battle.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; May God give you an opportunity and may
[2:53:05] you seize it
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; to take a turn.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; A changing point, a turning point, a
[2:53:13] divine pivot and say, "Lord, whatever
[2:53:16] you have,
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; whatever you have for me,
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; now I've got to say this and I'll finish
[2:53:23] this Tuesday night."
[2:53:25] In Ephesians 5, where we started, verse
[2:53:27] 16, musicians are coming.
[2:53:33] Seeing then that you walk circumspectly,
[2:53:35] verse 15, not as fools, but as wise.
[2:53:39] Look at what he says. Redeeming the
[2:53:41] time.
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time because the days
[2:53:48] are evil.
[2:53:50] I'm going to read that in the amplified
[2:53:52] because some of you close seemingly
[2:53:54] close your ears when I'm talking about
[2:53:56] what it means in the Greek. Look
[2:53:58] carefully then how you walk.
[2:54:01] Live purposefully. Verse 15. Live
[2:54:04] purposefully and worthily and
[2:54:06] accurately, not as the unwise and
[2:54:10] witless, but as wise, sensible,
[2:54:14] intelligent people. But look at what
[2:54:16] verse 16 says. making the very most
[2:54:21] of the time,
[2:54:24] redeeming
[2:54:26] the time. Turn to your neighbor for just
[2:54:29] a moment and say, "You waste too much
[2:54:31] time."
[2:54:36] Some of you meant it a little bit more
[2:54:38] than you should have.
[2:54:40] Some of you were actually giving God
[2:54:41] thanks that you were sitting by who you
[2:54:43] were sitting. So, you had an opportunity
[2:54:45] to tell them what you've always wanted
[2:54:47] to tell them. You waste too much time.
[2:54:51] It's true.
[2:54:53] We waste too much time
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; worried over over what we can't change,
[2:54:59] what we can't stop,
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; what we can't prevent.
[2:55:04] We waste too much time trying to do,
[2:55:07] what we're not called to do, what we
[2:55:09] forget doing,
[2:55:11] &gt;&gt; what we're called to be doing.
[2:55:14] We run around in circles like gerbles
[2:55:19] &gt;&gt; to keep our hands busy
[2:55:23] &gt;&gt; while the while the destiny scrolls of
[2:55:25] the kingdom are just drifting down
[2:55:28] around us and we're not grabbing
[2:55:31] something.
[2:55:33] We stay separated from God's program for
[2:55:35] our lives.
[2:55:39] I believe there are people I don't
[2:55:41] usually say something like this, but I
[2:55:43] believe there are people watching this
[2:55:44] meeting right now and you know exactly
[2:55:46] where you belong to be.
[2:55:52] And there you see it.
[2:56:02] Why does it matter? Because God's got a
[2:56:04] plan. If he wants you, you need to
[2:56:07] wherever that is.
[2:56:10] I don't believe that streaming is the
[2:56:14] ultimate answer.
[2:56:18] We've got time to redeem. We've got to
[2:56:20] make the very most of the time we have
[2:56:22] left. And look at this. You may not like
[2:56:24] this translation, but it is so extremely
[2:56:27] accurate in this next phrase. Buying up.
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; Read it. buying up each opportunity.
[2:56:36] That's what redeem means.
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; In fact, the word is I is uh Strongs
[2:56:42] 1805. And it means to secure
[2:56:45] deliverance. It means to liberate. It
[2:56:47] means to ransom or rescue. It means to
[2:56:50] buy out. It means to rescue from loss or
[2:56:55] from mislication. It means to buy up
[2:56:59] or buy out.
[2:57:03] redeeming the time,
[2:57:05] buying back the time, and using it,
[2:57:09] squeezing it to get the most out of it.
[2:57:13] Is there anybody in this house that
[2:57:14] would say, "I have wasted time.
[2:57:18] I've wasted weeks. I've wasted months."
[2:57:20] Some of you might even say, "I've wasted
[2:57:22] years." And if you let the burden of
[2:57:25] that get too heavy on your shoulder, you
[2:57:28] won't be able to walk. You won't be able
[2:57:29] to praise the Lord. And so you've got to
[2:57:31] believe that what the scripture says is
[2:57:33] true. That by by the grace of the
[2:57:35] atonement, we can actually buy back.
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; forfeited destiny
[2:57:44] &gt;&gt; that we did not accomplish and walk in
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; because we were wasting time
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; when we should have been buying more
[2:57:51] time.
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; And that's not with money. That's with
[2:57:54] doing.
[2:57:56] Because if you'll do what he called you
[2:57:58] to do, he'll use you
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; in ways you've never been used before.
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; And when you're in the permissive will
[2:58:05] of God, your harvest is proportionate.
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; But when you're in the perfect will of
[2:58:11] God, your harvest is proportionate.
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; There's an extra oil. There's an extra
[2:58:17] oil. There's an extra abundance that's
[2:58:20] added to what we accomplish when we're
[2:58:22] doing the perfect will of God.
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we have recognized that
[2:58:26] this is a season. It's a it's a chyros
[2:58:28] moment.
[2:58:30] &gt;&gt; There are two kinds of time. Kronos and
[2:58:32] Cairos
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; or Chyros we say chyros in Greek.
[2:58:37] And uh Kronos time is what you can tell
[2:58:40] on the watch and what you can tell on
[2:58:41] the on the clock on the wall.
[2:58:45] But Chyros time,
[2:58:48] it's set time. It's appointed time. It's
[2:58:52] an appointment with an individual, with
[2:58:55] a church, with a ministry, with a
[2:58:58] nation.
[2:59:01] And when you discover the set time, the
[2:59:05] appointed time, then you have to
[2:59:08] discover what is the purpose of this
[2:59:10] time.
[2:59:12] If we're in a new spiritual season, what
[2:59:14] is the purpose of this new spiritual
[2:59:17] season? And that's what we put our hands
[2:59:19] to.
[2:59:20] I've said this many times. I am closing.
[2:59:23] This is me closing.
[2:59:26] I've said this many times.
[2:59:28] You know when to plant corn and you know
[2:59:31] when to pick corn and you'd be dumb to
[2:59:35] try to reverse it.
[2:59:38] It's a fixed law of sewing and reaping.
[2:59:40] It's part of God's created program.
[2:59:43] And you'd be dumb when when your
[2:59:45] neighbors are out there getting ready to
[2:59:47] pull up the corn
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; to go out and think it's time for me to
[2:59:50] plant it.
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; Do you see the simplicity of this?
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; I know there's exceptions. I know there
[2:59:56] are things that that that can have an
[2:59:58] extended season and I know there are
[3:00:00] certain things you can plant twice in a
[3:00:01] season, but you don't start in October.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; You got to start mighty early and you
[3:00:07] need to be where there's some warm
[3:00:09] weather
[3:00:10] &gt;&gt; and where the ground's warm. You Indiana
[3:00:13] folks,
[3:00:14] you're you probably have to wait a
[3:00:16] little while for your soil to warm up
[3:00:19] and wherever you are in the country and
[3:00:21] you have to learn the appropriate season
[3:00:23] for where you live.
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; And so you don't go out and plant when
[3:00:29] you're supposed to be reaping. You reap
[3:00:30] when you're supposed to reap. You plant
[3:00:32] when you're supposed to plant. So to
[3:00:34] think that we don't have to discover the
[3:00:36] spiritual seasons of the Lord.
[3:00:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And I've told you before that
[3:00:41] some time is is Kronos and it's on a
[3:00:44] timeline. It goes like this. I hope you
[3:00:47] hear me.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; I'm too tired to hear you now. Well, I I
[3:00:52] I pray you will hear it on a recording
[3:00:55] or something. Sometime is like that.
[3:00:57] It's it's linear time. It's it's a it's
[3:01:01] like a timeline where we learned. You
[3:01:02] know, I've been I was in school so many
[3:01:06] years ago that we learned simple
[3:01:07] addition on a timeline.
[3:01:10] You move three steps over and that's
[3:01:12] that's where you are. Three plus two,
[3:01:14] three steps and add two more and you're
[3:01:16] at you're at five.
[3:01:18] But that's not all of God's timing. Some
[3:01:21] of his timing is linear time or parallel
[3:01:25] time like that laid out on a timeline.
[3:01:27] Some of his time according to the
[3:01:29] scripture is actually what we call
[3:01:30] cyclical time.
[3:01:35] And that means never ending.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; And there's a scripture in the book of
[3:01:39] Mark, I don't have time to bring it out,
[3:01:42] but there's a scripture that talks about
[3:01:43] Jesus as he moved through the circuits
[3:01:46] of the synagogue.
[3:01:48] And that word is actually a word that's
[3:01:51] chosen
[3:01:54] if we would have translated it in
[3:01:55] English
[3:01:58] uh deeper it would have been it would
[3:02:02] have been translated as circuit
[3:02:05] which meant
[3:02:07] really you can begin
[3:02:10] but eventually you'll come right back to
[3:02:12] where you started.
[3:02:14] I I got to finish this. There's this
[3:02:16] there's this thought and I'm done. I
[3:02:20] don't believe you. Well, I don't believe
[3:02:21] me either,
[3:02:23] but I want to show you what I mean.
[3:02:25] Quickly, on the wings of a snow white
[3:02:27] dove, paragraph 143,
[3:02:32] Brother Bram says, "You don't know what
[3:02:34] I've suffered. Just mental oppression.
[3:02:37] Every seven years it's come all my life.
[3:02:41] That's where I'm at now. 78.
[3:02:48] What's he talking about? He's talking
[3:02:49] about cyclical time. He's talking about
[3:02:53] time that you can't just stretch out on
[3:02:55] a parallel because it continues to move
[3:02:59] all the way back around and all the way
[3:03:01] back around and all the way back around.
[3:03:03] Can that be broken? It absolutely can in
[3:03:06] a divine moment
[3:03:08] under the authority of Jesus Christ. If
[3:03:11] there's a cyclical season, some repeated
[3:03:15] something in your life that is no longer
[3:03:18] serving its purpose, it can be broken.
[3:03:20] But I'd want to know, I'd want to be
[3:03:23] real sure before I started coming
[3:03:26] against God's what he has used in the
[3:03:28] past. If God's ever used that moment, he
[3:03:31] used it for brother Brandham. He brought
[3:03:33] brother Brandon back to that place where
[3:03:34] he got a little bit beside himself
[3:03:37] every seven years so he could hear hear
[3:03:40] some clear direction
[3:03:43] for the next seven years. If some of us
[3:03:45] would have been listening when we were
[3:03:48] at this place
[3:03:50] some years ago, same place,
[3:03:53] &gt;&gt; we might not have had to do it again
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; and again.
[3:03:57] He said in the indictment,
[3:03:59] every seven years your life changes. So
[3:04:02] if you thought it was just him, he said
[3:04:04] every seven years your life changes. So
[3:04:06] the seven times seven, you see, makes it
[3:04:08] kind of hard and that's a complete
[3:04:09] change. And he said it bothers the
[3:04:12] women. Men usually get a kind of a funny
[3:04:14] carrying on during that time. He's
[3:04:16] talking about the the the changing of
[3:04:18] life after the seasons of seven.
[3:04:23] Men used to get kind of a funny carrying
[3:04:25] on during that time and sometimes leave
[3:04:26] their wives.
[3:04:29] Sevenyear itch they used to call it.
[3:04:32] But women are are unfertile after that.
[3:04:34] And that means that the at least seven
[3:04:37] cycles of seven.
[3:04:39] And and we all go through that. We must
[3:04:41] remember that that it's things that we
[3:04:43] must bear with one another and
[3:04:44] understand those things. So there's a
[3:04:46] reason for us to understand that
[3:04:48] sometimes God brings us all the way back
[3:04:50] around to where we were
[3:04:54] to see if our decision
[3:04:56] will be different.
[3:05:00] That's called redeeming.
[3:05:03] &gt;&gt; It only works if you recognize
[3:05:09] the season.
[3:05:12] If you don't if you keep on doing and
[3:05:15] I'm going to be real honest in closing
[3:05:17] and I I regret that there that visitors
[3:05:20] would have to hear me speak so directly
[3:05:22] to you as a body
[3:05:24] but I recognize that there are some of
[3:05:26] you folks as much as I love you
[3:05:29] that this talk that has been stirred up
[3:05:31] in the last little bit around us about
[3:05:33] God doing something I can tell that you
[3:05:35] are just Really,
[3:05:41] I don't want to say that you would
[3:05:42] reject it, but I want to say that you
[3:05:44] you think you know, you maybe you have
[3:05:46] some prediction of how it will be.
[3:05:50] And maybe you say, "Well, we've heard
[3:05:51] this before." I guess we have. We should
[3:05:53] have heard it according to what that
[3:05:54] quote was. We should have heard
[3:05:56] something similar every seven years
[3:05:57] since we've been together 35 years
[3:06:01] &gt;&gt; cuz God brings us right back to sea.
[3:06:05] he did to Israel.
[3:06:07] And he kept bringing them around the
[3:06:09] mountain and around the mountain until
[3:06:10] the old-timers died out.
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; He said he could have brought them
[3:06:14] straight across, but he had to bring
[3:06:16] them the desert route
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; because if they'd have got across and
[3:06:20] saw that there was going to be warfare
[3:06:21] after they got in the promised land,
[3:06:23] they would have surely run back to
[3:06:24] Egypt. So he took all them trips around
[3:06:27] the mountain to get Egypt out of them.
[3:06:31] &gt;&gt; Only took him a Moses to get his people
[3:06:33] out of Egypt. But it took them many
[3:06:36] circuits,
[3:06:38] many cyclical seasons of time
[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; to get Egypt out of them
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; so that a new generation
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; so that a new generation could arise on
[3:06:51] the scene
[3:06:53] &gt;&gt; that would learn from the mistakes of
[3:06:55] their parents
[3:06:56] &gt;&gt; and learn from the mistakes of their
[3:06:57] grandparents and they would say, "I will
[3:07:01] not be denied.
[3:07:04] Amen.
[3:07:10] &gt;&gt; I will not be denied.
[3:07:13] I know that we're living in the closing
[3:07:15] hours. I know that according to the to
[3:07:18] the to the to the eclipse. I know that
[3:07:22] we're there just a little bit of light
[3:07:23] left in Leodysia.
[3:07:26] But I will not be denied.
[3:07:29] We need a young man, a young woman who
[3:07:31] would say, "I'm not of the generation of
[3:07:33] the prophet.
[3:07:35] I'm not of the generation of the
[3:07:36] witnesses of the prophet." Most of them
[3:07:38] are all gone. And some of you didn't
[3:07:40] have the privilege of meeting them like
[3:07:42] some of us did. But you could you you
[3:07:44] you realize that and you recognize that
[3:07:46] and you'd say, "However,
[3:07:49] I'm here.
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; I will not be denied. Amen.
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; I believe the same God that met my
[3:07:55] fathers, the same God who met my
[3:07:57] grandfathers, the same God who met my
[3:07:59] great-grandfathers, will meet me.
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; And instead of just waiting on him to
[3:08:03] track me down and nail my hide to the
[3:08:07] wall,
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; so he can help me.
[3:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:10] &gt;&gt; I'll just run to him
[3:08:12] &gt;&gt; and I'll recognize that there's a
[3:08:14] turning point. There's a divine pivot.
[3:08:17] It's a moment of decision. I'm at a
[3:08:21] spiritual crossroads
[3:08:24] &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm being challenged to put my
[3:08:27] priority back in the word
[3:08:30] &gt;&gt; and then it's up to you.
[3:08:34] And like Jacob
[3:08:37] in days of old,
[3:08:39] I wrestled with the Lord.
[3:08:44] I would not be denied. I would not be
[3:08:48] denied. I would not be denied.
[3:08:52] And if you could let that rise up and
[3:08:54] produce super faith in this hour, I
[3:08:57] believe you you'd be glad you did
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; because he's offering us an opportunity
[3:09:04] to go higher,
[3:09:06] &gt;&gt; to go deeper,
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; to go wider.
[3:09:10] But that's going to require that church
[3:09:12] is not as usual.
[3:09:19] You see, God may move at 11
[3:09:23] when we start.
[3:09:26] That would mean you'd need to be here.
[3:09:29] He might move at 9:30
[3:09:33] after some of you have left
[3:09:36] or after some of you have not physically
[3:09:38] left, but you've mentally left because
[3:09:41] it's we're past 9.
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; It may mean that we'd have to have a
[3:09:46] prayer meeting, a little extra prayer
[3:09:48] meeting. It might mean that we'd have to
[3:09:51] miss a meal. It might mean that we'd
[3:09:53] have to cut back on our sweet. It might
[3:09:55] mean that we have to make up our mind
[3:09:57] that anything God wants to do is worth a
[3:10:00] small little sacrifice or price to pay.
[3:10:04] If you've all if you always do what
[3:10:06] you've always done, you'll always be
[3:10:07] what you've always been. You'll always
[3:10:09] get what you've always got.
[3:10:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "We've gone as far
[3:10:13] with God as we're ever going to go until
[3:10:15] we're willing to pay a greater price."
[3:10:17] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "But you don't know.
[3:10:19] I can't hardly pay my power bill. I've
[3:10:21] got problems in my children. I've got
[3:10:23] problems in my family. Yes, maybe we do
[3:10:26] know. Maybe we don't know. But I'll tell
[3:10:28] you what we do know. He's the answer.
[3:10:31] &gt;&gt; Revival in your heart is the answer. A
[3:10:34] refill of the Holy Ghost in your life is
[3:10:38] the answer.
[3:10:40] &gt;&gt; Spending time before the throne in
[3:10:44] worship and adoration.
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's the answer.
[3:10:49] &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of the problem and get
[3:10:51] them on the problem. solver. His name is
[3:10:54] Jesus.
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand every
[3:11:03] detail,
[3:11:05] &gt;&gt; but can you believe?
[3:11:09] Can you believe?
[3:11:12] Can you recognize your turning point,
[3:11:16] your divine pivot?
[3:11:31] the Lord visited
[3:11:34] some time back
[3:11:37] in a time of prayer
[3:11:39] and he
[3:11:42] laid real heavy on my heart
[3:11:46] that we should meet the Sunday night
[3:11:51] before camp meeting
[3:11:55] for communion and footwashing.
[3:11:58] And that's what we're going to do.
[3:12:02] We'll have our regular service that
[3:12:04] Sunday morning, but that Sunday evening,
[3:12:06] I'll tell you the time when we get
[3:12:07] closer to that day because I believe
[3:12:09] that's what God wants to do among us to
[3:12:13] initiate what he's going to do for us.
[3:12:17] I started giving hints and saying a few
[3:12:21] things along the way. I I wanted to make
[3:12:23] sure that I had the confirmation from
[3:12:25] the Lord. Now, you visitors, you wonder
[3:12:27] why that's such a big thing. Because
[3:12:28] we've not had it in a long time.
[3:12:35] There's some of you who've been coming
[3:12:36] to church here for some time and you've
[3:12:38] never been a part of a service where we
[3:12:41] had communion and footwashing. Don't you
[3:12:42] believe? Oh yes, absolutely we believe.
[3:12:45] But anything can become common.
[3:12:48] And when it no longer means anything to
[3:12:50] people,
[3:12:52] I I hate it. It's religion. Then
[3:12:58] it's like a teenage girl who wears a
[3:12:59] dress because mama says, "You think
[3:13:01] you're really preparing her for life
[3:13:05] without taking some time to explain to
[3:13:07] her why we do the things we do? Why we
[3:13:10] dress the way we dress?"
[3:13:14] Sometimes we we get so used to doing it
[3:13:18] the way we've done it that we it means
[3:13:20] nothing to us and we forget that if
[3:13:23] Jesus tries some of us
[3:13:27] won't be around
[3:13:29] if we leave them without knowing why
[3:13:31] they believe what they believe. We've
[3:13:33] crippled them. We've not launched them.
[3:13:36] I care. I want you to know I care. It
[3:13:38] deeply disturbs me that what has been so
[3:13:42] precious to me
[3:13:44] would not be precious to the next
[3:13:47] generation if Jesus dies.
[3:13:51] It so matters. It consumes me.
[3:13:56] And it's up to us. It's on us.
[3:13:59] It's on us, brother Greley and I and and
[3:14:02] and all of us in that age group and
[3:14:05] above
[3:14:07] who really have had a journey
[3:14:10] to make sure that we instill and we
[3:14:12] teach and by example we break it down
[3:14:16] and show you why God has called us to
[3:14:18] this life. And if we don't,
[3:14:25] there arose a generation
[3:14:28] who just didn't know.
[3:14:31] They didn't understand.
[3:14:34] May God give us grace. May there be such
[3:14:36] a turning point. May there be such a
[3:14:38] burden fall on young married couples.
[3:14:41] May there be such a burden fall on young
[3:14:43] people unattached.
[3:14:47] Instead of mourning your life away if
[3:14:49] you don't have a companion yet, you
[3:14:51] ought to embrace the seasons of the Lord
[3:14:54] and know that God has something for you.
[3:14:58] And there may very well be a reason why
[3:15:01] he has preserved you and and held you
[3:15:03] back for such a time as what is ahead.
[3:15:07] God's got a plan for every one of us.
[3:15:16] It's a turning point.
[3:15:19] It's a divine pivot. What you do with it
[3:15:22] is up to you.
[3:15:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[3:15:30] I cast my mind
[3:15:35] to Calary
[3:15:39] where Jesus bled.
[3:15:43] and died for me.
[3:15:47] I see his wounds,
[3:15:51] his hands, his feet,
[3:15:55] my savior on
[3:15:59] that cursed tree,
[3:16:03] his body bound,
[3:16:05] [Music]
[3:16:07] and drenched in tears.
[3:16:11] They laid him down
[3:16:15] in Joseph's
[3:16:17] tomb,
[3:16:18] the entrance seal
[3:16:22] by heavy storm.
[3:16:26] A Messiah
[3:16:27] still
[3:16:30] and all along.
[3:16:32] [Music]
[3:16:34] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. our
[3:16:41] God. Oh, praise his name
[3:16:46] forever
[3:16:48] more. For endless
[3:16:52] days, I will sing your praise.
[3:16:57] Oh Lord,
[3:16:59] oh Lord our God.
[3:17:04] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[3:17:12] Oh, praise his name
[3:17:16] forever
[3:17:18] more for endless
[3:17:22] days. I will sing your praise,
[3:17:27] oh Lord.
[3:17:29] Oh Lord, our God.
[3:17:33] And then on the
[3:17:37] third break of dawn,
[3:17:41] the son of hell
[3:17:45] rose
[3:17:46] again.
[3:17:48] He trampled death.
[3:17:52] Where is your sting?
[3:17:55] The angels roar
[3:17:59] for Christ
[3:18:02] the King.
[3:18:07] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[3:18:14] Oh, we praise his name
[3:18:19] forever
[3:18:21] more forless.
[3:18:23] [Music]
[3:18:25] Lord, I will sing your praise,
[3:18:30] oh Lord. We sing, oh Lord our God.
[3:18:36] Oh,
[3:18:38] praise the oh the Lord our God.
[3:18:45] Oh, praise his name
[3:18:49] forever
[3:18:51] more for
[3:18:56] Lord. I will sing your praise.
[3:19:01] Oh Lord,
[3:19:03] oh Lord our God,
[3:19:07] he shall return
[3:19:11] in rooms of white,
[3:19:15] the blazing sun.
[3:19:18] Oh shall pierce the night
[3:19:22] and I will rise
[3:19:26] among the saints.
[3:19:29] Oh my gaze transfixed
[3:19:34] on Jesus face.
[3:19:37] Oh
[3:19:39] praise the name of the Lord our God. Oh
[3:19:46] we praise his name.
[3:19:50] Forever
[3:19:51] [Music]
[3:19:53] more for and
[3:19:57] Lord I will sing your praise.
[3:20:02] Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.
[3:20:08] Oh
[3:20:10] praise the name of the Lord.
[3:20:16] Oh Lord, we praise your name
[3:20:21] forever
[3:20:23] more for endless
[3:20:27] days. Lord, I will sing your praise.
[3:20:32] Oh Lord, we sing. Oh Lord. Oh,
[3:20:40] and praise the Oh, the Lord our God. Oh,
[3:20:47] we praise his name
[3:20:52] forever
[3:20:54] more. For ending,
[3:20:57] oh Lord, I will sing your praise.
[3:21:03] Oh Lord we sing. Oh Lord our Oh we sing.
[3:21:10] Oh Lord.
[3:21:12] Oh Lord our God.
[3:21:19] [Music]
[3:21:20] And you have the name above
[3:21:25] all names.
[3:21:28] My God. And you are worthy of
[3:21:33] all praise.
[3:21:35] So Lord, my heart, oh it'll sing, how
[3:21:41] great
[3:21:43] is our God. You have the name.
[3:21:49] [Music]
[3:21:50] You have the name above
[3:21:54] all. Oh my God. and you are worthy of
[3:22:02] all praise.
[3:22:05] So Lord, my heart, oh it'll sing, how
[3:22:10] great
[3:22:13] is our God.
[3:22:16] [Music]
[3:22:19] Oh, and how great
[3:22:24] is our God.
[3:22:26] &gt;&gt; Sing with me. Sing with me. How great
[3:22:31] is our God? We want all to see how
[3:22:37] great,
[3:22:38] just how great
[3:22:42] is our God.
[3:22:46] &gt;&gt; You're so great and mighty, Lord.
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; How great
[3:22:53] is our God? Oh, sing with me. How great,
[3:22:59] &gt;&gt; how great
[3:23:01] is our God. We want all to see how
[3:23:07] great,
[3:23:08] just how great
[3:23:12] is our God.
[3:23:14] &gt;&gt; One more time, just like that. How great
[3:23:16] is our God
[3:23:19] and how great
[3:23:22] &gt;&gt; great is our God.
[3:23:26] &gt;&gt; Sing with me. How great
[3:23:31] is our God. We want all to see how
[3:23:37] great,
[3:23:38] &gt;&gt; how great,
[3:23:38] &gt;&gt; oh, just how great
[3:23:42] is our God.
[3:23:49] Right now, the Lord is offering you
[3:23:51] something.
[3:23:54] Maybe it's something that you were
[3:23:56] offered before
[3:23:58] and you were not in a position, a place
[3:24:01] of faith, or there were too many dead
[3:24:04] cats on the line, or you had other
[3:24:08] priorities.
[3:24:10] It could be that uh you just didn't take
[3:24:14] it.
[3:24:16] It's in those cyclical
[3:24:19] cycles of the Lord. And
[3:24:23] sometimes it happens even to a whole
[3:24:26] body of people of believers.
[3:24:28] It's up to you to discover.
[3:24:32] It's up to you to pray and ask the Lord,
[3:24:33] "Lord, what is it? What is it that
[3:24:36] you're offering me in this season?" If
[3:24:39] it's a closer walk with you, I want it.
[3:24:41] Yes.
[3:24:42] &gt;&gt; Just know just know there's a with every
[3:24:44] blessing, with every gift, with every
[3:24:46] privilege, there's a responsibility that
[3:24:48] come. It's not a price, but it's a
[3:24:51] responsibility that comes with it. Are
[3:24:53] you willing, if you if you desire that
[3:24:56] closer walk, are you willing
[3:24:58] &gt;&gt; to bear the responsibility
[3:25:03] of emptying yourself?
[3:25:06] I was studying the second transvision
[3:25:10] that the Lord gave to this body many
[3:25:13] years ago.
[3:25:15] And the man in linen,
[3:25:18] he spoke about the difference between
[3:25:22] the trumpet and the chauffar.
[3:25:26] And he said the trumpet is the work of
[3:25:28] men's hands. A man gets a vision, he
[3:25:31] gets a plan, he he makes a mold and he
[3:25:34] creates a a silver trumpet.
[3:25:37] But the chauffear is is different
[3:25:40] because in Bible days it's just the
[3:25:42] hollow horn
[3:25:44] of an animal.
[3:25:47] Today it's a little bit different, but
[3:25:51] in Bible days, an animal died
[3:25:56] for a chauffear to be able to sound.
[3:26:00] And the man in linen said that the
[3:26:04] little bride
[3:26:06] would be the chauffar,
[3:26:09] that it would be God's breath
[3:26:13] that would be in her. That's life, isn't
[3:26:16] it? Isn't that what happened to Adam?
[3:26:19] &gt;&gt; God breathed breath into Adam and he
[3:26:20] became a living soul.
[3:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:23] &gt;&gt; The breath of God is what made Abram
[3:26:26] become Abraham.
[3:26:29] The breath of God is what changes
[3:26:31] everything in us. And God said, "I want
[3:26:34] to fill my people like the chauffear
[3:26:36] with the breath of God, and then they
[3:26:39] will sound my voice. They will sound the
[3:26:41] alarm." Brother Brandham said it this
[3:26:43] way. That bride will be the final voice
[3:26:45] of God to the ages.
[3:26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[3:26:48] &gt;&gt; it won't be what we want to say.
[3:26:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:26:50] &gt;&gt; It'll be what he's already said.
[3:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:53] &gt;&gt; Echoing
[3:26:55] &gt;&gt; sounding through our life as an emptied
[3:26:58] out chauffar.
[3:27:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:27:01] &gt;&gt; What what they will do and what they
[3:27:03] would do then is sometimes there's a
[3:27:05] matter um it can be like blood. It can
[3:27:08] be hair
[3:27:10] that gets formed in a horn of an animal
[3:27:12] like that. and they and they would have
[3:27:13] to go in and clean that out. And so
[3:27:16] that's really where we are today if we
[3:27:18] if we want to be filled with the breath
[3:27:20] of God. The New Testament said, "And
[3:27:22] Jesus breathed on them and said,
[3:27:24] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[3:27:27] &gt;&gt; So the scriptures are clear. He wants to
[3:27:29] fill us with his spirit, fill us with
[3:27:31] his breath, fill us with his life, and
[3:27:34] then he wants to use us.
[3:27:37] And so somebody is getting offered what
[3:27:40] you've already been offered. but you
[3:27:42] weren't in a position to receive it. May
[3:27:44] you be I pray for all of us that we will
[3:27:49] be where we ought to be with him. That
[3:27:51] we can say, "Lord, now's the time. I
[3:27:53] take it
[3:27:54] &gt;&gt; proudly, gladly, humbly, thankfully,
[3:27:57] gratefully, and I'll do with it what you
[3:28:00] what you desire. No one can make that
[3:28:03] commitment for you, but we we don't want
[3:28:04] to prolong this anymore. Would you take
[3:28:07] this opportunity in prayer right now?
[3:28:09] Nobody telling you what to pray, but
[3:28:11] just according to the inspiration of
[3:28:13] your heart right now, would you ask the
[3:28:16] Lord, Lord, if there is something in
[3:28:19] your hand for me, I don't want to miss
[3:28:21] it. I don't want another 7, 10, 12, 20
[3:28:25] year cycle.
[3:28:27] I want to take it now. I want to
[3:28:29] surrender my all.
[3:28:31] I want to be used for my family. I want
[3:28:33] to be used for my neighbor. I want to be
[3:28:35] used for my coworker. I want to be used
[3:28:38] in this church body to bring life. I
[3:28:41] don't want to be a pew rider.
[3:28:44] &gt;&gt; I want to be a worker in the field, a
[3:28:46] gleaner in the field. I I want I want
[3:28:50] God's fullness.
[3:28:53] &gt;&gt; I want to come into that place of full
[3:28:55] adoption
[3:28:58] &gt;&gt; where maturity speaks
[3:29:01] &gt;&gt; instead of childishness.
[3:29:03] &gt;&gt; Grow us up, Lord. Here we are.
[3:29:07] We we line up. We sign up. We've come
[3:29:11] with with open hands and arms to say,
[3:29:14] "Lord, we embrace your destiny plan for
[3:29:19] us,
[3:29:20] &gt;&gt; no matter what it looks like."
[3:29:24] There are many of us in this room who
[3:29:26] who have fulfilled previous assignments
[3:29:28] and and in those assignments, we learned
[3:29:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. that your grace is sufficient
[3:29:34] for whatever you call us to.
[3:29:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray right now that somebody
[3:29:40] who's been waiting and a and fiddling
[3:29:44] around with their life,
[3:29:47] missing every chance,
[3:29:50] will catch it this time
[3:29:53] and volunteer willingly
[3:29:56] &gt;&gt; to be what you have called them to be.
[3:30:02] Search this body, Lord, as only you can,
[3:30:06] and move us into a higher place of
[3:30:08] faith.
[3:30:10] May we criticize less.
[3:30:13] May we murmur less. May we praise more.
[3:30:17] May we support more.
[3:30:20] May we strengthen feeble knees, hands.
[3:30:25] May we lift up those who have fallen
[3:30:28] down.
[3:30:33] May we take this opportunity. May we
[3:30:35] redeem the time
[3:30:38] in the name of Jesus. Are you praying?
[3:30:42] Continue to do that for just a moment.
[3:30:45] How great
[3:30:47] is our God.
[3:30:50] Pray your prayer.
[3:30:52] Pray your heart.
[3:30:55] You can boil it down to here I am.
[3:31:00] Send me.
[3:31:02] That's really all you have to say.
[3:31:05] If you don't know what else to say, you
[3:31:06] can just say, "Lord, here I am. Send me.
[3:31:09] Use me. Speak through me. Speak to me.
[3:31:13] Here I am. Here I am."
[3:31:16] Some of you have looked miserable a long
[3:31:18] time.
[3:31:19] It's time for the joy of the Lord to
[3:31:21] blow out the cobwebs.
[3:31:24] It's time for the peace that passes all
[3:31:27] understanding
[3:31:28] to settle your decision-making processes
[3:31:32] so that you can fully surrender. I say
[3:31:34] that to you with all the love I can
[3:31:36] possibly have.
[3:31:38] I want to see you make it. I want to see
[3:31:40] you succeed in everything God's called
[3:31:42] you to. And you can be assured that if
[3:31:45] you're doing his will, your preacher
[3:31:46] will be behind you hollering, "Amen."
[3:31:48] Go, go, go. Do what God say. Do do be
[3:31:57] [Music]
[3:32:01] is our God.
[3:32:04] Sing with me. How great
[3:32:09] is our God and all will see how great,
[3:32:16] how great,
[3:32:18] &gt;&gt; how great is our God.
[3:32:21] &gt;&gt; Let's lift our hands to him and say,
[3:32:23] "Here we are. We take, we take what you
[3:32:25] have to give us. How great
[3:32:30] is our God?"
[3:32:32] &gt;&gt; Young and old, say, "I'm here, Lord."
[3:32:34] &gt;&gt; Sing with me. How great.
[3:32:37] &gt;&gt; Use me as our God.
[3:32:39] &gt;&gt; Occupy my life.
[3:32:42] &gt;&gt; See how great,
[3:32:45] how great
[3:32:48] is our
[3:32:49] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of the old pattern. I'm tired
[3:32:51] of the old cycle. I'm ready to go
[3:32:53] forward in you. Oh, how great
[3:32:59] is our God.
[3:33:02] Sing with me. How great
[3:33:05] &gt;&gt; intercessors arise.
[3:33:07] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[3:33:10] &gt;&gt; Let the prayer warriors arise.
[3:33:14] &gt;&gt; How great.
[3:33:15] &gt;&gt; Come back to your destiny.
[3:33:17] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[3:33:18] &gt;&gt; Come back to your purpose.
[3:33:21] &gt;&gt; We call the spiritual midwives. Come
[3:33:24] back to your purpose.
[3:33:28] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[3:33:31] We're called the stewards of the
[3:33:33] promise. Come back to your promise.
[3:33:37] &gt;&gt; Come back to your position.
[3:33:39] [Music]
[3:33:42] &gt;&gt; How great
[3:33:45] is our
[3:33:46] &gt;&gt; We call to the trailblazers.
[3:33:49] &gt;&gt; Come back to the front of the line.
[3:33:51] &gt;&gt; Help blaze a trail.
[3:33:53] &gt;&gt; How great.
[3:33:54] &gt;&gt; Be the arrowhead again.
[3:33:56] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[3:33:58] &gt;&gt; Be that which pierceth.
[3:34:00] that which goeth a hand
[3:34:04] &gt;&gt; for running anointings.
[3:34:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, see how great
[3:34:10] how great
[3:34:13] is our God.
[3:34:18] &gt;&gt; Come on, just a few more minutes.
[3:34:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, and you have the name above
[3:34:24] all names. I accept it. You are worthy.
[3:34:30] &gt;&gt; I take my responsibility.
[3:34:32] &gt;&gt; All praise
[3:34:34] &gt;&gt; and Lord my heart will sing. How great,

[3:35:17] have the name above
[3:35:21] all name.
[3:35:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus. You are worth a name of
[3:35:28] all praise.
[3:35:31] And Lord, my heart will sing. How great
[3:35:38] is our God.

[3:41:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, as a people, we
[3:41:04] once believed
[3:41:06] for supernatural in our lives. Lord,
[3:41:10] &gt;&gt; your prophet told us we're supernatural
[3:41:12] class of people. We
[3:41:14] &gt;&gt; we we were born for prophetic purposes.
[3:41:17] You've showed us that your bride is
[3:41:19] called to a parabolic anointing. And our
[3:41:22] lives are parables.
[3:41:26] Your purposes are sometimes hidden, but
[3:41:30] we march them out. We walk them out. We
[3:41:32] live them out.
[3:41:40] Help us not to miss you in this hour,
[3:41:41] Jesus.
[3:41:47] We all have such a desire to be
[3:41:49] understood.
[3:41:51] We all want to be understood.
[3:41:54] We want to be heard and we want to be
[3:41:56] understood.
[3:41:59] The problem with living a parabolic life
[3:42:05] &gt;&gt; is you're you you won't always be
[3:42:07] understood until the till the fruit
[3:42:09] comes until the reality
[3:42:12] to the antitype matches the type.
[3:42:16] And you just got to learn to be faithful
[3:42:19] even in the vessel of misunderstanding.
[3:42:21] Amen.
[3:42:27] Lord, fill your people with peace today.
[3:42:30] It's unusual service.
[3:42:32] But you're God and you're a God of
[3:42:34] variety.
[3:42:36] &gt;&gt; Fill your people with peace right now.
[3:42:43] [Music]
[3:42:47] &gt;&gt; And I know it's not much. Have nothing
[3:42:51] else fit for a king

[3:43:04] Hallelujah.

[3:43:37] of destiny at this time. The Lord is
