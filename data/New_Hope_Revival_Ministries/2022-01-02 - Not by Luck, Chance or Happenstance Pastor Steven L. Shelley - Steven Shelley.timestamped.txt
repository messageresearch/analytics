[52:08] worthy is his name
[52:14] praise the lord you may be seated it's
[52:16] wonderful to see you in the house of the
[52:18] lord i don't know about you but i miss
[52:20] brother greeley
[52:23] and
[52:24] this is their second sunday away and
[52:27] he is ministering again today for his
[52:30] dad and uh
[52:33] he was asking his dad yesterday how he
[52:35] was feeling and he said well by faith
[52:38] i'm healed but my body's trying to tell
[52:40] me something different
[52:43] would you lift our elder brother greeley
[52:45] up to the lord and his wife and also
[52:48] sister joyce's dad
[52:50] as they are aging and uh
[52:52] particularly brother
[52:54] greeley is trying to carry on the work
[52:57] of the lord he pastors that
[52:59] small church in the hills of virginia
[53:04] and the largest portion of the
[53:06] congregation are elderly people and he
[53:10] labors
[53:11] constantly for them
[53:13] he's a faithful servant of the lord but
[53:15] as they get older there are more
[53:17] hospital visits and more home visits
[53:20] and because he is also aging it becomes
[53:22] difficult but god is being gracious to
[53:24] him
[53:25] and he appreciates our prayers very much
[53:28] so let's continue to do that
[53:30] i want to show you a couple of clips
[53:32] this morning and let me say we're happy
[53:34] to have all the visitors here we have
[53:36] quite a few of our own people still out
[53:39] we're very happy to have you i don't
[53:40] know some of you by name but you're
[53:42] welcome here
[53:43] and we just trust that you'll receive
[53:45] something from the lord
[53:47] and it is very nice to see brother reed
[53:49] again this week thank you for your
[53:50] sacrifice to come so far to be with us
[53:54] past hundreds of churches to be here
[53:56] today and appreciate that
[53:58] i just want you to hear our girl
[54:02] i want you to hear her
[54:04] interpreting in japanese
[54:07] we're very very thankful for fousey
[54:10] we are so very thankful for how the lord
[54:12] brought
[54:14] those sisters to us so many years ago
[54:18] sister emiko and her daughter fusay and
[54:20] now fousey is married to koya
[54:23] and
[54:24] ibuki is growing very fast
[54:27] they are fellowshipping as much as
[54:29] possible with a little group of
[54:31] believers in japan that has been 28
[54:33] years in the making
[54:36] some of you remember brother dennis
[54:38] ballard
[54:40] he came here he was the most if i say
[54:43] that someone is eccentric you can
[54:45] believe it
[54:47] because i may be the king of that
[54:50] he was the most eccentric man i've ever
[54:53] met in my life but he had the most
[54:54] sincere burden for japan
[54:57] he had married a japanese woman after
[55:00] the war
[55:02] and it was his desire that god send a
[55:05] salvation message and the message of the
[55:07] hour
[55:08] to
[55:09] japan
[55:11] and uh
[55:13] he came here unannounced from anchorage
[55:16] alaska
[55:17] and we had a few days of fellowship with
[55:19] him
[55:20] and on the last day he slid a check
[55:24] across the table to me and kept his
[55:26] fingers on one end of the check
[55:30] i knew there were some strings attached
[55:34] glanced down at the check and it was for
[55:36] one hundred thousand dollars
[55:38] the largest check i'd ever seen in my
[55:40] life at that time
[55:42] and uh he said if you will leave now
[55:46] and stay 360 days in japan
[55:50] preaching jesus and introducing this
[55:52] message this check is yours
[55:55] we will take care of your expenses while
[55:57] you're there and your plane ticket to
[55:59] get there and then this will be your
[56:01] gift because we want to see god well
[56:05] those were the early 90s and god was
[56:07] doing amazing things here
[56:09] and as much as i loved asia and had a
[56:12] heart already for the asian people
[56:14] having been to uh philippines and korea
[56:18] i didn't think that that was the call
[56:19] that god was placing on my life at that
[56:22] time and he we parted very friendly he
[56:25] he just said well then we've got to pray
[56:26] that god will raise up someone well
[56:28] years later the lord has done that
[56:31] and uh it was not our church that put
[56:33] that together it was through some
[56:36] missionary efforts of brother tim pruitt
[56:38] etc
[56:39] but our sister fousey and sister uh and
[56:44] emiko have been a great blessing in that
[56:46] congregation
[56:48] and that this week
[56:50] uh
[56:51] the pastor pastor fed
[56:54] reached out and he wrote a little note
[56:56] and he said we are also thankful for you
[56:59] being one of the instruments
[57:01] in paving the way for the message to
[57:03] take root here in japan and they
[57:05] recognize that this church had some help
[57:08] in that because
[57:10] we baptized a couple of the first
[57:12] believers in the nation
[57:14] so they asked that i would greet their
[57:16] new year service and i did that and
[57:18] we're not you're not it's 12 minutes
[57:19] long we're not going to play all of it i
[57:21] just want you to hear our girl
[57:23] interpreting
[57:24] give him just a little of it
[57:27] he traveled many miles
[57:30] turn it way up
[57:35] to visit me
[57:36] [Music]
[57:37] his brother
[57:52] most importantly
[58:06] and his great
[58:20] a burden
[58:27] [Applause]
[58:33] god bless them
[58:38] and they sent us a clip back and it's
[58:41] just about three or four seconds long i
[58:43] think so this
[58:47] [Music]
[58:48] is in that great
[58:51] [Music]
[58:54] oh
[58:55] thank you lord
[58:59] and they're growing god is adding to
[59:02] their numbers
[59:03] and we are thankful to hear there are a
[59:05] few foreign workers among them from
[59:07] philippines and other places but there
[59:09] are there are precious uh japanese
[59:12] people who are coming to the lord and
[59:15] we're very very thrilled to have even
[59:17] the smallest part in that and uh when
[59:21] fousey began to come so often she just
[59:23] became a part of our family didn't she
[59:26] and you people have been so uh
[59:28] hospitable and had them in your home and
[59:31] i miss them
[59:32] and i hope that they can come back and
[59:34] if not we'll have to go to japan and see
[59:36] them before too long

[59:45] lord has for us
[59:47] he's been good to us this year the past
[59:49] year 2021 it was not without challenge
[59:53] but god's grace has been sufficient

[1:00:07] at a big one today

[1:00:21] worry about it they tell me that 40 is
[1:00:23] the new 30.
[1:00:25] and he said i'm claiming that
[1:00:28] i didn't want to be too exaggerated you
[1:00:30] know i could have said
[1:00:32] that 40 is the new 25 but i wasn't
[1:00:34] feeling that that early in the morning

[1:02:14] she's a pentecostal girl i pray that god
[1:02:17] will keep her and protect her and
[1:02:19] watch over her in that vicious industry
[1:02:21] of
[1:02:22] christian music
[1:02:24] it's vicious
[1:02:26] but she has got a a tone and a touch
[1:02:30] that really speaks to my heart sometime
[1:02:33] she sings a song i speak jesus
[1:02:36] over every fear over every anxiety
[1:02:40] i need that sometime don't you
[1:02:43] we have a
[1:02:44] pentecostal man that we know of who's a
[1:02:46] doctor in mississippi and he
[1:02:49] took covet and he had quite a battle
[1:02:51] there for a few days and he said he was
[1:02:54] reaching for something that would help
[1:02:55] him in the middle of that he was trying
[1:02:57] to praise his way out and touch god for
[1:03:00] some victory and and he discovered that
[1:03:02] song
[1:03:03] and he said i just played it over and
[1:03:05] over again and i could feel that thing
[1:03:07] turning loose of my body
[1:03:09] there's power in that precious name
[1:03:13] but this is my old style

[1:12:43] our midst
[1:12:45] we're thankful that you woke us up this
[1:12:47] morning in our right mind
[1:12:50] and you were the first thought in my
[1:12:53] mind and in my heart when i woke up this
[1:12:55] morning
[1:12:57] and every time i woke up through the
[1:12:59] night it was you that came it was it was
[1:13:02] a thought of your goodness
[1:13:04] that flooded my mind
[1:13:07] and i began like so many have done over
[1:13:10] these past few days counting my
[1:13:12] blessings
[1:13:14] lord we could never praise you enough we
[1:13:17] could never thank you enough for what
[1:13:19] you mean to us today
[1:13:22] you are jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:13:25] and today and forever you change not
[1:13:29] your compassions they fail not your
[1:13:31] mercies are everlasting
[1:13:34] you are a refuge to your people in the
[1:13:37] time of storm
[1:13:39] we are gathered today lord to be
[1:13:42] encouraged by your word
[1:13:44] corrected by your word redirected by
[1:13:47] your word whatever it is that we have
[1:13:50] need of lord let your word speak to that
[1:13:53] today
[1:13:54] give us ears to hear give us a heart to
[1:13:57] understand lord let us each one feel our
[1:14:01] responsibility to pull on the gifts of
[1:14:04] god and make this time in your word as
[1:14:08] beneficial as possible
[1:14:10] because it's strength to
[1:14:12] us and lord we need that strength that
[1:14:15] only your word can provide
[1:14:18] we take authority over every foul
[1:14:21] spirit of the enemy and we declare in
[1:14:24] the name of the lord jesus christ you
[1:14:26] are already defeated
[1:14:29] you will not be allowed to hinder the
[1:14:31] people of god from eating at the lord's
[1:14:33] table today
[1:14:35] so we adjure you in the name of jesus
[1:14:38] to take your flight even now
[1:14:41] and we ask oh god that your perfect will
[1:14:44] will be accomplished and ministered
[1:14:46] in the marvelous name of the lord jesus
[1:14:49] christ yeshua our messiah amen and the
[1:14:52] church said
[1:14:53] you may be seated
[1:14:55] i want to preach this morning if i had a
[1:14:57] little title i would call it not by luck
[1:15:01] chance or happenstance
[1:15:04] not by luck
[1:15:05] chance
[1:15:07] or happenstance
[1:15:10] matter what 2021 brought us
[1:15:13] in our individual lives we know that we
[1:15:16] can never go back and relive it
[1:15:18] we are now on day two of 2022
[1:15:23] that means that we are exceeding a 2-2-2
[1:15:28] some of us have been watching 2-2-2's
[1:15:31] for a long time
[1:15:33] i could stand here for two hours or more
[1:15:36] and talk about the two twos of the bible
[1:15:39] and the two two twos of the bible and
[1:15:42] some of the amazing places
[1:15:45] where these things come together
[1:15:48] but when we were changing the hebrew
[1:15:51] calendar earlier
[1:15:53] in the fall of last year we looked at
[1:15:56] some of the things that go along with
[1:15:58] the hebrew year
[1:16:00] 5782
[1:16:02] and then we look for a bit at some of
[1:16:05] the two two twos of the bible
[1:16:08] there were a couple of them that were
[1:16:10] highlighted in the spirit and i want to
[1:16:11] just remind you of them very quickly and
[1:16:14] the ladies don't have them up there but
[1:16:16] i feel that they can probably find them
[1:16:18] but one of the ones that the lord was
[1:16:20] dealing with me about in the fall was
[1:16:22] acts chapter 2
[1:16:24] verse 22.
[1:16:26] you've got a bible there you can look it
[1:16:28] up and read it for yourself but it says
[1:16:31] ye men of israel
[1:16:33] hear these words
[1:16:35] jesus of nazareth a man
[1:16:38] approved of god among you
[1:16:41] by miracles
[1:16:43] and wonders
[1:16:45] and signs this is the only place in the
[1:16:48] entire bible where all three of these
[1:16:51] manifestations of god's glory appear in
[1:16:54] the same verse
[1:16:56] there will be other places where signs
[1:16:58] and wonders appear there may be other
[1:17:00] scriptures where miracles and signs
[1:17:02] appear but this is the only scripture in
[1:17:05] the bible where all three of these
[1:17:07] demonstrations of god's glory appear
[1:17:10] this is how jesus manifested who he was
[1:17:14] by miracles by wonders and by signs
[1:17:17] which god did by him in the midst of you
[1:17:22] as ye yourselves also know when i found
[1:17:25] that in the fall i said lord that's what
[1:17:27] i'm claiming for 222 for 2022 i'm
[1:17:32] claiming god that you will once again
[1:17:35] manifest your glory this time in a
[1:17:38] mini-membered bride this time in a
[1:17:41] man-child company not one man child but
[1:17:45] a company of men child
[1:17:48] men children
[1:17:50] a man child company that you will come
[1:17:53] in your great wisdom
[1:17:55] and perform by your glory
[1:17:58] miracles and wonders and signs and do it
[1:18:02] in the lives of your children your sons
[1:18:07] your bride in these last days so i've
[1:18:10] been praying into that now since about
[1:18:13] the first part of september
[1:18:15] and i'm believing that god is doing it
[1:18:19] and that it will soon be on the surface
[1:18:22] and you'll begin to see god using you
[1:18:25] in miracles and signs and wonders
[1:18:29] now if you were here last sunday you saw
[1:18:31] a miracle
[1:18:33] we only have a small part in that but we
[1:18:35] all have prayed and believed god
[1:18:37] and we know that we had a man here who
[1:18:40] was as close to being resurrected from
[1:18:43] the dead just about as you can get
[1:18:46] sent home to die
[1:18:48] and uh given just really a few days to a
[1:18:51] week
[1:18:52] and now two months later he sat in this
[1:18:55] service and gave testimony of the
[1:18:57] goodness of the lord and this sunday got
[1:19:00] in the vehicle rode all the way to
[1:19:02] lagrange an hour away and is preaching
[1:19:05] to his congregation that's the goodness
[1:19:08] of the lord
[1:19:11] if if god should take him home tomorrow
[1:19:14] that is still the goodness of the lord
[1:19:17] and what i've been saying to people who
[1:19:20] have asked different questions i have
[1:19:22] been saying over and over again you
[1:19:24] don't have to be sick to die
[1:19:27] you don't even have to be sick to die
[1:19:29] and there's no reason if god decides
[1:19:32] that he's going to call his servant home
[1:19:34] why not heal him
[1:19:36] why not go ahead and glorify his name in
[1:19:39] his body
[1:19:40] then if he leaves him here for years to
[1:19:42] carry on the gospel the miracle is
[1:19:44] profound
[1:19:45] but if he should call him home the
[1:19:47] miracle is still profound god has
[1:19:50] undertook in his life
[1:19:52] and i'm so thankful that all the glory
[1:19:56] belongs to god
[1:19:58] he planned it that way it was not until
[1:20:01] the doctor said the last time there is
[1:20:04] nothing else that we can do the vowel is
[1:20:08] perforated it has spilled its waste into
[1:20:11] an open cavity in his abdomen there's
[1:20:14] nothing that we can do he would not
[1:20:17] survive the surgery we're sending him
[1:20:20] home under hospice care and jesus passed
[1:20:23] by and said not yet
[1:20:27] not yet
[1:20:29] so i'm asking the lord for more miracles
[1:20:32] and wonders and signs
[1:20:35] the holy ghost spoke here one time years
[1:20:37] ago and he said i'm going to make my
[1:20:39] children the miracles and the signs and
[1:20:43] the wonders
[1:20:44] he's going to do such a work in us
[1:20:47] that only he could receive the glory for
[1:20:50] how many of you think that sounds all
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:54] i feel like this is a little loud
[1:20:55] somewhere i don't know where if it's out
[1:20:57] there if it's up here i feel like it
[1:20:59] needs just a little bit of adjusting
[1:21:02] so no matter what we've been through
[1:21:05] we have to reach for what's ahead
[1:21:07] and we have to do that in a mindset
[1:21:10] we know about how that negative stuff
[1:21:12] works
[1:21:13] we've got to do that in a mindset and we
[1:21:16] may have to tell ourselves over and over
[1:21:18] again get out of the past
[1:21:21] don't wallow around in yesterday's stuff
[1:21:24] come on now i want to say always i want
[1:21:27] you to understand we are not trying to
[1:21:30] take away from what you've been through
[1:21:33] you have legitimately been through some
[1:21:35] stuff
[1:21:36] you have walked through some darkness
[1:21:38] you have had trials you have had battles
[1:21:41] you have had wars just like i have but
[1:21:44] the truth is we're here today by the
[1:21:48] grace of god
[1:21:50] he has proven that he's going to help
[1:21:52] his people get through this
[1:21:54] and we stand here today knowing that we
[1:21:57] couldn't have made it without him how
[1:21:59] many of you know you could not be where
[1:22:00] you are without the goodness of the lord
[1:22:02] never made it
[1:22:04] you might be a somewhere with a hangover
[1:22:07] you might be somewhere coming down off
[1:22:09] of a high this morning but instead you
[1:22:12] are joined together with the saints to
[1:22:14] worship the name of the lord jesus
[1:22:16] christ all of that by grace
[1:22:19] and so we are reaching ahead and we are
[1:22:22] pressing forward to everything that god
[1:22:25] has for us this year
[1:22:28] in the message shalom
[1:22:30] he preached this message multiple times
[1:22:32] brother branham but in 1964 in phoenix
[1:22:37] january the 19th paragraph 184 he said
[1:22:40] god
[1:22:42] stands on the promised word for each new
[1:22:48] year
[1:22:51] where are you standing god
[1:22:54] where are you at today lord
[1:22:56] where might we find you if we went
[1:22:59] looking for you today i'll tell you
[1:23:00] where he is he's standing on the
[1:23:03] promised word for 2022.
[1:23:07] whatever in his mind he has seen he has
[1:23:11] purpose he has planned for 2022. that's
[1:23:14] what he's standing on today
[1:23:17] and i want you to know when god takes
[1:23:19] his stand on his word you and i should
[1:23:22] do the same thing
[1:23:24] because then we come into agreement with
[1:23:26] god's word and that loses to us the
[1:23:29] benefit and the blessing that's
[1:23:31] underneath that promise
[1:23:33] brother brannon went on to say he stands
[1:23:35] on it
[1:23:36] this year
[1:23:37] to fulfill what he has got promised for
[1:23:41] this year
[1:23:42] whatever it is i want to be right in the
[1:23:45] center of his will
[1:23:47] in the future like they did i wonder if
[1:23:50] anybody can say amen
[1:23:53] when we read just a moment ago psalm 31
[1:23:56] 15 it said my times
[1:23:59] plural
[1:24:00] are in thy
[1:24:02] hand
[1:24:03] singular
[1:24:05] i want you to know i know what hand
[1:24:08] he's holding my times
[1:24:12] only one hand
[1:24:14] times plural hand singular
[1:24:18] i'm not over here on the left hand
[1:24:23] the one he uses to wipe his brow
[1:24:26] but i'm being held over here in the
[1:24:28] right hand
[1:24:29] the right hand of his power and his
[1:24:32] authority
[1:24:34] the psalmist said my times are in
[1:24:37] thy hand
[1:24:39] he needed deliverance and he knew that
[1:24:42] god had already determined the day and
[1:24:44] the hour of his deliverance so he said
[1:24:47] lord my times my healings my
[1:24:51] deliverances my freedoms my
[1:24:53] breakthroughs my recoveries all my
[1:24:56] restitutions my restorations all that i
[1:25:00] have need of my down setting and my
[1:25:02] uprising all that i'm going to go
[1:25:05] through the rest of my life you're
[1:25:07] holding it in your right hand the hand
[1:25:09] of power and the hand of authority it's
[1:25:12] going to be all right and even though
[1:25:15] i'm persecuted and even though i have
[1:25:17] enemies and even though i suffer some
[1:25:19] things down here i know where my times
[1:25:21] are being held they're being held in the
[1:25:23] hand of the lord do you know how you're
[1:25:25] going to get through 2022 not by luck
[1:25:28] not by chance not by happenstance
[1:25:34] that's how you're not going to make it
[1:25:35] through
[1:25:36] would you give me the definition of luck
[1:25:41] you know i hear christian people
[1:25:42] sometimes talking about being lucky
[1:25:46] that's wrong
[1:25:47] that's not something that ought to come
[1:25:49] out of your mouth
[1:25:52] luck is chance god doesn't operate by
[1:25:55] chance
[1:25:57] he operates operates by predetermined
[1:26:00] purpose and plan
[1:26:02] luck is a force
[1:26:05] that brings good fortune
[1:26:07] or adversity
[1:26:10] the events or circumstances that operate
[1:26:13] for
[1:26:14] or against
[1:26:16] an individual
[1:26:18] i've heard christian people say i've had
[1:26:20] an unlucky year
[1:26:24] i've heard christian people part one
[1:26:26] another say good luck to you
[1:26:28] let me tell you something i don't need
[1:26:30] your wish of luck
[1:26:32] i need you to pray for me that i don't
[1:26:34] miss the timing of the lord in my life i
[1:26:37] need your prayer i don't need your your
[1:26:39] wishes of of good luck or best luck i
[1:26:43] need you to pray that i can walk in the
[1:26:45] center of god's will in 2022 because
[1:26:49] we're going to make it by grace we're
[1:26:51] going to make it by his word but it's
[1:26:53] not going to be by luck chance or
[1:26:55] happenstance
[1:26:57] i want you to give me the definition of
[1:26:59] chance if you will
[1:27:01] the assumed
[1:27:03] impersonal
[1:27:04] purposeless
[1:27:06] determiner
[1:27:08] i didn't make this up
[1:27:10] this is webster
[1:27:12] the gospel according to webster
[1:27:15] the assumed
[1:27:16] impersonal
[1:27:18] purposeless
[1:27:19] determiner
[1:27:21] of unaccountable happenings
[1:27:25] anybody else confused
[1:27:29] somebody said how did you all come to me
[1:27:31] it was just by chance
[1:27:34] well let me tell you what chance he is
[1:27:36] how did you meet your wife well it just
[1:27:38] was by chance
[1:27:40] how'd you get the job you got just by
[1:27:41] chance well let me tell you what who
[1:27:43] chance is
[1:27:45] chance is the assumed impersonal
[1:27:48] purposeless determiner of unaccountable
[1:27:51] happenings
[1:27:54] to me that's just a big fat zero
[1:27:56] it doesn't mean anything
[1:27:58] how many of you are glad you're not
[1:28:00] living by chance
[1:28:02] you're not living by the draw the lucky
[1:28:04] draw you're living by a plan that god
[1:28:08] has laid out for our lives before we
[1:28:10] ever showed up here on this planet
[1:28:13] the good and the bad and the ugly
[1:28:16] now somebody said the whole world is
[1:28:18] churning trying to determine why bad
[1:28:21] things happen to good people i'm telling
[1:28:23] you this god is sovereign god has a plan
[1:28:27] if you'll just hold on to him you'll
[1:28:29] find out before it's over that he didn't
[1:28:32] forsake you he didn't forget you you
[1:28:34] didn't fall out of his love you didn't
[1:28:36] fall out of his care he allowed these
[1:28:39] things to come your way because he's
[1:28:41] bringing you to a higher glory he's
[1:28:44] bringing you to a place where you can
[1:28:46] meet him where he stands the prophet
[1:28:48] said he stands today on the promised
[1:28:51] word for this year
[1:28:54] and god wants you to be able to meet him
[1:28:56] there
[1:28:57] you can't meet god in 2022 if you're
[1:29:00] still living in 2021
[1:29:04] you can't meet god for what he wants to
[1:29:06] do for us this year if you're still
[1:29:09] living in 1950
[1:29:12] you've got to catch up
[1:29:15] and you the reason why we get behind and
[1:29:17] we don't catch up is we're still trying
[1:29:19] to go and sort out all the things that
[1:29:22] happened to us
[1:29:23] why did that happen well why did that
[1:29:24] happen what if i'd done this
[1:29:27] just like we've heard and i've mentioned
[1:29:29] it more than one time with so many
[1:29:31] people dying this year not just of covet
[1:29:33] but of all kinds of things and you hear
[1:29:35] people say things and look grief is
[1:29:37] horrible and losing somebody you love is
[1:29:40] wretched and none of us want to walk
[1:29:42] through that ever again because most of
[1:29:44] us have walked through it already in our
[1:29:46] lives but the reality is we will
[1:29:49] if jesus tarries we've got another
[1:29:52] casket to follow
[1:29:53] there's no doubt in my mind about it but
[1:29:56] as you have seen it this year you hear
[1:29:59] people even god's people even people who
[1:30:01] have the message that we have saying
[1:30:03] things like if i could have just got him
[1:30:05] to a better hospital
[1:30:09] if i could have just got him to a better
[1:30:11] doctor
[1:30:12] if they would have just let him take
[1:30:14] hydroxychlorquin
[1:30:16] if i could have just got him a better
[1:30:18] treatment
[1:30:19] if i could have got her on vitamin d a
[1:30:21] little earlier
[1:30:22] come on now
[1:30:23] you cannot have it both ways
[1:30:27] you're trying to take something out of
[1:30:29] god's hands and put it in the hands of
[1:30:32] men and when we trust ourselves to the
[1:30:34] hands of men we're going to get failed
[1:30:36] every time
[1:30:37] the bible said there was a prophet named
[1:30:39] asa who trusted the lord all of his days
[1:30:43] and in his old age a king and in his old
[1:30:45] age he got diseased in his feet and he
[1:30:49] leaned on the arms of flesh and died
[1:30:52] why because he changed his program at
[1:30:54] the end
[1:30:56] he had always went to god and god had
[1:30:58] always moved on his behalf but when he
[1:31:01] decided
[1:31:02] this time i'm going to see what man can
[1:31:04] do for me let me tell you something i
[1:31:06] appreciate doctors i appreciate those
[1:31:08] smarter than i am but i want you to know
[1:31:11] your life your very existence your
[1:31:14] tomorrow your today is not in the hands
[1:31:17] of educated men it's not in the hands of
[1:31:19] a good hospital it's not in the hands of
[1:31:22] a good doctor your life is in the hands
[1:31:24] of a good god
[1:31:27] he may not you say well i'm going
[1:31:29] through some stuff that's not good you
[1:31:31] may be 100
[1:31:32] telling it just like it is
[1:31:34] you may be going through something
[1:31:36] that's not good at all but i'll tell you
[1:31:37] what the bible said he works
[1:31:39] all things
[1:31:43] for the good
[1:31:46] it didn't say all things that happened
[1:31:47] to us are good
[1:31:48] haven't you preached this before i have
[1:31:51] i just never called it not by luck
[1:31:54] chance or happenstance
[1:31:56] so can you give me the definition of
[1:31:58] happenstance
[1:32:00] i want to make sure we know what we're
[1:32:01] not depending on to get us through
[1:32:05] a circumstance
[1:32:07] especially
[1:32:10] that is due to chance
[1:32:14] happenstance is a circumstance
[1:32:17] especially that is due to chance can you
[1:32:19] take us back and show us what chance is
[1:32:22] because i've already forgot
[1:32:25] the assumed impersonal purposeless
[1:32:27] determiner of uncountable happenings
[1:32:30] look
[1:32:31] can you take us back to luck because
[1:32:33] i've already forgot what luck is luck is
[1:32:35] a force that brings good fortune or
[1:32:38] adversity the events or circumstances
[1:32:40] that operate for or against an
[1:32:42] individual brother branham said there's
[1:32:44] only two forces in all the earth
[1:32:47] not god the devil and lady luck
[1:32:51] not god the devil and chance
[1:32:53] or god the devil and champion and
[1:32:55] happenstance i'm going to be tongue-tied
[1:32:59] not at all but god and evil good and
[1:33:02] evil darkness and light and your hands
[1:33:05] if you've committed it so your life is
[1:33:09] in the hands of the lord
[1:33:11] he is the holder of your future
[1:33:14] he's the one who has your tomorrow in
[1:33:17] his hand
[1:33:18] he had your yesterday in his hand
[1:33:22] he knows exactly you know we we're we're
[1:33:25] we don't know we don't know how many
[1:33:26] variants are coming
[1:33:28] we don't know how many more viruses are
[1:33:31] coming
[1:33:32] we don't know what is going to fall on
[1:33:34] this earth the prophet of god talked
[1:33:36] about germ warfare being used in the end
[1:33:39] time
[1:33:42] who knows what's coming
[1:33:44] we have no way of predicting the future
[1:33:47] but what we do know is there's a great
[1:33:49] god
[1:33:50] that's got the future
[1:33:53] in his hands
[1:33:55] in a message god's gifts always find
[1:33:58] their places
[1:34:01] 63
[1:34:03] paragraph 77
[1:34:05] he said when you realize
[1:34:08] what we are doing here
[1:34:11] where did we come from
[1:34:14] or what business we got here got being
[1:34:16] here we wasn't put here just by chance
[1:34:21] now i know you've got to make it through
[1:34:22] the grammar to get to the meat
[1:34:24] we wasn't put here just by chance
[1:34:28] we were put here for a purpose
[1:34:32] and we
[1:34:33] must serve that purpose
[1:34:37] we're not serving luck
[1:34:40] we're not serving chance
[1:34:42] we're not serving happenstance
[1:34:45] we're serving a god-ordained
[1:34:48] purpose for our life
[1:34:51] but still we are back on the basis of
[1:34:53] free moral agency where we can serve it
[1:34:57] or reject it just like adam did in the
[1:35:01] beginning
[1:35:02] now i appreciate brother branham
[1:35:04] bringing the balance here because you
[1:35:06] are not a robot
[1:35:07] and you are not being forced to walk in
[1:35:10] a plan that you don't want nothing to do
[1:35:12] with
[1:35:13] you've got to make a choice
[1:35:15] but i can tell you right now the only
[1:35:18] success that we can have in this life is
[1:35:21] to cooperate with what god's got for us
[1:35:23] and every time we start kicking against
[1:35:26] those pricks we pay the price for it
[1:35:29] again and again and again can you say
[1:35:32] amen would you get with me this morning
[1:35:34] because i i think you need to hear some
[1:35:37] of this
[1:35:39] in a message
[1:35:41] things that are to be
[1:35:44] paragraph 31
[1:35:47] this is so rich
[1:35:49] i hope you'll give it your undivided
[1:35:50] attention even if you don't listen to my
[1:35:52] comments
[1:35:53] i pray you'll hear what he said
[1:35:56] you were all
[1:35:58] pre-planned
[1:36:01] by
[1:36:02] god
[1:36:06] nothing
[1:36:07] happens
[1:36:08] by
[1:36:09] chance
[1:36:11] with god
[1:36:13] he knows all about it
[1:36:17] it's all pre-planned
[1:36:20] planned for many generations back so
[1:36:24] that you could be
[1:36:27] here tonight do you hear what he's
[1:36:29] saying
[1:36:31] even your gathering here this morning
[1:36:34] was planned of god
[1:36:37] you may have got up this morning not
[1:36:39] sure where you would be here or not but
[1:36:41] i want you to know god already knew
[1:36:42] whether you'd make it or not he knew
[1:36:45] he already knew
[1:36:47] he already had it a part of his plan if
[1:36:49] it wasn't his plan you ain't here i'm
[1:36:52] just going to talk like brother branham
[1:36:53] here a little while you ain't here
[1:36:56] if he hadn't already seen it planned it
[1:36:59] allowed it you wouldn't be sitting here
[1:37:01] this morning so we must understand
[1:37:03] there's a reason for us being gathered
[1:37:05] together the way we are today it's a
[1:37:07] part of a pre-plan that god has laid for
[1:37:10] our lives let's read on
[1:37:12] he said just think that you at one time
[1:37:15] i'll repeat this again you at one time
[1:37:18] was in your father
[1:37:21] in the gene of your father
[1:37:23] now he didn't know you at that time
[1:37:27] neither did you know him
[1:37:29] at that time
[1:37:31] you were just a seed a gene in him
[1:37:34] you didn't have any kind of relationship
[1:37:37] or fellowship with your father
[1:37:39] he goes on but you see then you were put
[1:37:42] in the bedding ground in the womb of
[1:37:45] mother
[1:37:46] through holy wedlock
[1:37:48] and then you become a person
[1:37:50] expressed in the image like your father
[1:37:54] then there's fellowship
[1:37:57] there can't be fellowship until the gene
[1:38:00] is expressed but when the gene of life
[1:38:04] is expressed it comes forth in the image
[1:38:06] of the father who provided it
[1:38:09] and in that moment there is a bonding
[1:38:12] that takes place between a baby and a
[1:38:14] dad or a baby and a mother
[1:38:17] even though a portion of that baby was
[1:38:19] in mom as a as a seed i mean as an egg
[1:38:22] and a portion of that baby was in dead
[1:38:25] as a gene or as a seed and yet they
[1:38:28] didn't know one another you didn't know
[1:38:30] the personality that that baby would
[1:38:32] have you didn't know exactly how it
[1:38:35] would look even your ultrasound couldn't
[1:38:38] show you exactly how wonderful and
[1:38:41] amazing that baby was going to look when
[1:38:43] it was born
[1:38:44] you knew that you had contributed your
[1:38:47] part but there was no bonding no
[1:38:49] fellowship no relationship and this is
[1:38:52] such a powerful truth because as we go
[1:38:55] on we find out that we were with god
[1:38:59] even in god in the beginning
[1:39:03] we didn't know him
[1:39:05] we had not yet had fellowship with him
[1:39:08] we have no recollection of being there
[1:39:13] until we begin to have fellowship with
[1:39:15] him
[1:39:16] when we begin to have fellowship with
[1:39:18] him we recognize hey
[1:39:22] this is right
[1:39:24] this is somehow familiar
[1:39:27] i've experienced something like this
[1:39:29] before
[1:39:30] i can't quite put my finger on it but i
[1:39:33] feel like i've been here before the
[1:39:35] world calls it deja vu
[1:39:38] but we understand that sometimes what we
[1:39:41] are experiencing are memories
[1:39:44] of a time before we had an expression
[1:39:48] and without an expression we had not yet
[1:39:50] had fellowship with god
[1:39:52] but in the hour that we were expressed
[1:39:56] he began to woo us
[1:39:58] into a place of fellowship and it
[1:40:00] doesn't feel strange once we get in
[1:40:02] papa's arms
[1:40:04] we don't feel alone anymore and like a
[1:40:07] stranger anymore we feel like we belong
[1:40:10] when we know who we are in christ we
[1:40:13] feel like we belong and we feel like
[1:40:15] we're where we've always been and some
[1:40:17] of that is a memory
[1:40:19] of what it was like before we ever came
[1:40:22] to this earth that's why when you see
[1:40:24] the new city it's not going to be as big
[1:40:27] of a shock as you may think it is
[1:40:29] there's going to be elements of your
[1:40:31] eternity that are all
[1:40:33] so familiar
[1:40:35] because we know that even memories can
[1:40:38] be transferred through the gene
[1:40:43] oh it's very true
[1:40:45] we learn it we've researched it we
[1:40:48] talked about it when we were doing some
[1:40:50] stuff on the brain
[1:40:52] you are born with a memory that comes
[1:40:56] some from egg and some from seed you
[1:40:59] just don't know anything about it and
[1:41:01] may never you may live your whole life
[1:41:03] and never be able to connect with that
[1:41:05] until you get in the presence of the
[1:41:06] lord when you get in the presence of the
[1:41:08] lord and you start singing like gaither
[1:41:11] wrote feeling at home in the presence of
[1:41:13] jesus
[1:41:15] how is it that the first time you get in
[1:41:17] his presence you feel like you've always
[1:41:19] been there
[1:41:21] it's new but it's old
[1:41:24] it's strange but it's familiar all at
[1:41:27] the same time here's the reason why
[1:41:30] let's read on some of you are looking at
[1:41:32] me very odd
[1:41:33] let me see if i can look right back out
[1:41:35] audit you
[1:41:37] what do you mean by that
[1:41:40] now the only way that you can be a son a
[1:41:42] daughter of god because you have to have
[1:41:45] to have eternal life and there's only
[1:41:48] one form of eternal life and that's
[1:41:50] god's life only one form of eternal life
[1:41:54] that was god
[1:41:56] there there to be a son of god you had
[1:42:00] to be in him always
[1:42:03] you really believe that
[1:42:05] the gene of your life spiritual life
[1:42:09] tonight was in god
[1:42:11] not your natural gene life that was in
[1:42:14] your dad
[1:42:15] your spiritual gene life was in god the
[1:42:19] father before there was even a molecule
[1:42:23] oh you're older than you look
[1:42:27] because you were in your father before a
[1:42:29] molecule was ever created
[1:42:31] how many of you know we don't know how
[1:42:32] far back that was
[1:42:34] that could have possibly been millions
[1:42:36] of years not just the six thousand years
[1:42:39] we know of creation from the bible but
[1:42:41] we understand that before before genesis
[1:42:44] 1 took place there were some things that
[1:42:46] had already happened in god's creation
[1:42:49] do you understand that
[1:42:50] there were creatures who lived in that
[1:42:52] time period that didn't make it to
[1:42:54] genesis 1
[1:42:56] and people find the bones and the
[1:42:58] remainders and the fossils and the
[1:43:00] archaeologists dig these kinds of relics
[1:43:03] up and they try to find a place to put
[1:43:05] them in history and they say well they
[1:43:07] must be billions of years old we know
[1:43:10] that the earth as we know it it's
[1:43:12] exactly right at 6 000 years old but
[1:43:16] there was an existence before genesis 1
[1:43:20] and we don't know exactly what that was
[1:43:22] like but we know that whatever it was it
[1:43:24] was a part of god's original creation we
[1:43:27] know by what the scripture said there
[1:43:29] were molecules
[1:43:30] even civilizations of some kind of
[1:43:33] organization existed before the great
[1:43:35] deluge
[1:43:37] we don't know exactly what all that
[1:43:39] looked like but in order for there to
[1:43:41] have been creation then there had to be
[1:43:43] molecules
[1:43:44] so we could probably say that molecules
[1:43:47] are millions of years maybe billions of
[1:43:49] years
[1:43:51] and yet you were in god
[1:43:55] before a molecule had ever been created
[1:44:00] there is a part of you that is older
[1:44:04] than you
[1:44:06] come on now
[1:44:08] this was a great plan
[1:44:10] and you are nothing but the
[1:44:13] manifestation
[1:44:14] of the gene of life
[1:44:17] that was in god
[1:44:19] as a
[1:44:21] son of god
[1:44:23] now let's read on
[1:44:25] now you're expressed
[1:44:28] after his word has come in you he's
[1:44:31] talking about the spiritual expression
[1:44:33] of the spiritual gene
[1:44:35] to light up
[1:44:36] this age
[1:44:39] what is my purpose
[1:44:42] why am i here
[1:44:44] why was i born you may not like
[1:44:46] it because i'm not going to tell you
[1:44:49] that anybody in this room can be the
[1:44:51] president of the united states
[1:44:53] because you can't
[1:44:55] not every person in here
[1:44:59] no
[1:45:00] this is a philosophy of humanism
[1:45:03] that keeps telling people over and over
[1:45:05] again you can be anything you want to be
[1:45:07] not necessarily
[1:45:09] because god has a plan
[1:45:11] if you want to be more accurate you
[1:45:12] should say you can be almost anything
[1:45:16] that you desire to be as long as it's
[1:45:17] part of god's plan
[1:45:20] right somebody said well that just
[1:45:21] limits us oh no you have not i have not
[1:45:25] scratched the surface of what we were
[1:45:28] created to be to express in the last of
[1:45:31] the last days
[1:45:34] i don't want to i don't want to throw
[1:45:35] anybody off who may have never heard
[1:45:37] this before but the prophet uses words
[1:45:40] like amateur gods and he used his word
[1:45:42] like messiahs
[1:45:46] i don't think i've been walking in that
[1:45:48] lately
[1:45:50] so i'm just scratching the surface of
[1:45:53] expressing what i was created to express
[1:45:57] so you think all this happened by luck
[1:45:59] and chance and happenstance
[1:46:02] you think the earth as we know it is
[1:46:04] here because
[1:46:11] the assumed
[1:46:12] impersonal
[1:46:13] purposeless determiner of unaccountable
[1:46:16] happenings
[1:46:22] i believe in the great bang big bang
[1:46:24] don't you i believe in them yes sir i
[1:46:27] believe in the big bang
[1:46:29] with all my heart
[1:46:31] god spoke
[1:46:33] bang
[1:46:35] boom
[1:46:38] i don't know what it sounded like but
[1:46:40] all i know is that he spoke and all of
[1:46:44] exists everything began to move into
[1:46:47] place
[1:46:48] to create what it was that he was
[1:46:51] speaking
[1:46:52] it may have sounded like a sonic boom
[1:46:55] there may have been no words in what he
[1:46:57] spoke that day but everything
[1:47:00] that was there from from nothing he
[1:47:02] created everything that we see
[1:47:05] none of it by chance none of it by luck
[1:47:09] none of it by happenstance
[1:47:11] all by a divine creator with a divine
[1:47:14] order a god who knew it all
[1:47:17] and it ashamed that we make so many
[1:47:19] decisions on our own until we finally
[1:47:22] come to god and then we start asking him
[1:47:24] what he thinks about things
[1:47:26] how many troubles have we had and trials
[1:47:29] have we gone through because we did the
[1:47:31] choosing
[1:47:32] instead of yielding to god finding his
[1:47:34] will and timing
[1:47:36] we've paid a price folks
[1:47:38] that we didn't really have to pay
[1:47:40] somebody said what do you think about
[1:47:41] that what did that your free will
[1:47:44] your free choice you can't go back and
[1:47:46] undo that any more than you can undo
[1:47:48] anything else that's in your past but
[1:47:50] what you can do is determine from this
[1:47:52] day forward i will not move forward
[1:47:54] without i know god's will
[1:47:56] the prophet prophesied that there would
[1:47:58] be a thus saith the lord bride who would
[1:48:00] emerge in the last days she would not do
[1:48:03] anything unless she had the say of the
[1:48:05] lord every time she moved it would be
[1:48:07] thus saith the lord when she spoke it
[1:48:09] would be thus saith the lord not one
[1:48:11] prophet again
[1:48:14] we've had that
[1:48:15] not one prophet again but a prophetic
[1:48:18] people
[1:48:19] a prophetic bride a remnant of sons and
[1:48:22] daughters a manchild company
[1:48:24] that would emerge with that kind of
[1:48:26] power and authority in their life and
[1:48:28] that's what god's been working on
[1:48:30] all throughout history
[1:48:33] he said now you're expressed after his
[1:48:34] word has come in you to light up this
[1:48:37] age that's your purpose
[1:48:38] your purpose is to light up this age
[1:48:41] this is the darkest age ever known in
[1:48:43] the histories of man there's never been
[1:48:45] a darker day than the church age of
[1:48:46] laodicea
[1:48:49] it's so bad it's almost a total eclipse
[1:48:51] the light has almost been completely
[1:48:53] erased from the earth you are living in
[1:48:55] the last sliver of light
[1:48:58] for this planet does that sound like
[1:49:00] doom and gloom
[1:49:02] it sounds like reality
[1:49:05] the earth is destroying itself and i'm
[1:49:07] not talking about global warming
[1:49:10] i'm talking about a society that keeps
[1:49:12] rejecting god and rejecting god and
[1:49:15] rejecting god and rejecting god's word
[1:49:18] and because of that there's just a
[1:49:20] sliver of light
[1:49:22] the real light is in the bride
[1:49:26] you are here in this hour to light up
[1:49:30] this age and when you leave here by
[1:49:32] resurrection there will be no light left
[1:49:37] there will be a time of great
[1:49:40] tribulation jacob's sorrow
[1:49:42] tribulation like the world is never ever
[1:49:45] known before
[1:49:47] you'll be safe in a honeymoon in a
[1:49:49] millennium in a place where jesus is
[1:49:51] preparing and getting things ready for
[1:49:53] you and i you don't believe that do you
[1:49:56] i do with every fiber of my being in
[1:49:58] fact i think i've i think somehow i've
[1:50:01] been there in some form and i'm getting
[1:50:03] ready to go back there i think i'll
[1:50:05] understand it a whole lot better this
[1:50:07] time around don't you
[1:50:09] because the full expression has taken
[1:50:11] place he said you god's life in you
[1:50:14] because you're a son or a daughter of
[1:50:15] god therefore you get what i mean and he
[1:50:18] asked that as a question with a question
[1:50:19] mark therefore you get what i mean and
[1:50:22] the congregation says
[1:50:24] good good good good see
[1:50:26] and he goes on
[1:50:29] you are now made
[1:50:31] you're sitting in this church tonight
[1:50:34] because your duty
[1:50:37] is to express god to this nation
[1:50:41] and this people
[1:50:43] and this neighborhood
[1:50:46] where you associate
[1:50:48] wherever you are god knew that you would
[1:50:52] be here
[1:50:53] because you have to be
[1:50:55] one of his genes
[1:50:58] or
[1:50:59] his attributes
[1:51:00] let's go on
[1:51:02] you had to be
[1:51:04] if you ever if you've got eternal life
[1:51:07] then it always was eternal life
[1:51:11] and god before there was a foundation
[1:51:14] world knew
[1:51:16] that you would be here let me tell you
[1:51:18] something he not only knew that you
[1:51:21] would be expressed in the earth but he
[1:51:23] knew the precise moment
[1:51:28] somebody said i just can't i just can't
[1:51:29] get this
[1:51:31] i just can't fathom anything well let me
[1:51:33] just get real plain here
[1:51:36] this election this predestination this
[1:51:38] purpose is something that's demonstrated
[1:51:40] in the earth every day of the year
[1:51:45] don't you see the articles that come out
[1:51:46] on january the 1st
[1:51:49] they always the hospitals
[1:51:51] snap a picture of the first baby born in
[1:51:53] 2022
[1:51:54] already seen them
[1:51:57] and they weren't the only ones or just
[1:51:58] happened to be the first ones
[1:52:00] there may have been hundreds of babies
[1:52:02] born right here in this area
[1:52:04] on the first day of 2022 well let me
[1:52:06] tell you something in order for that
[1:52:07] baby to show up
[1:52:09] there was a whole lot of election that
[1:52:11] had to take place
[1:52:14] not by chance
[1:52:18] i want you to know there was a seed that
[1:52:20] had to get to that egg
[1:52:22] and it came by the billions had billions
[1:52:24] of cousins
[1:52:27] and it had a journey to swim i'm not
[1:52:29] trying to be too plain this morning but
[1:52:31] i tell you i think it's one of the most
[1:52:33] outstanding examples of election
[1:52:37] because one of them was ordained to make
[1:52:39] it all the way
[1:52:42] somebody said what about the rest they
[1:52:43] didn't make it
[1:52:48] it was not by selective order
[1:52:52] it wasn't a battle to the fittest
[1:52:55] it was god chose one
[1:52:58] he made it all the way
[1:53:01] amen
[1:53:02] he merged himself according to biology
[1:53:05] he merged himself with an egg
[1:53:08] and in doing so he could no longer claim
[1:53:11] his own identity because that moment
[1:53:14] that that egg was fertilized by that
[1:53:17] seed in that moment it became a new
[1:53:19] creation
[1:53:21] it was no longer an egg
[1:53:24] it was no longer a seed
[1:53:27] the seed joined itself with the egg and
[1:53:30] a new creation was formed in your
[1:53:32] mother's belly one that had not been
[1:53:34] there before
[1:53:36] because that fertilized egg is now an
[1:53:38] embryo and it is now a life
[1:53:42] amen and it now has a full set of
[1:53:45] chromosomes and it now has everything it
[1:53:47] needs to succeed in life
[1:53:50] come on
[1:53:51] and in order for it to get there and to
[1:53:53] accomplish that it had to get there when
[1:53:56] all the others couldn't make it
[1:54:00] one made it
[1:54:01] when the earth was filling up with
[1:54:03] nations god said i'll help them all if
[1:54:06] they'll trust the god of israel but
[1:54:08] israel is mine
[1:54:11] i'll be good to all the nations of the
[1:54:13] world but i'll only be good to them
[1:54:16] through the one that i have chosen i
[1:54:18] have chosen israel and by israel i will
[1:54:21] bless the other nations of the world so
[1:54:23] don't you doubt for one minute that god
[1:54:26] had a plan to get you here
[1:54:28] you were known of god and fashioned in
[1:54:31] the mind of god to be here to hear the
[1:54:35] word of the hour and to be a light to
[1:54:38] your age
[1:54:39] and even in our backslidden condition
[1:54:42] sometimes he still has a purpose and a
[1:54:44] plan for us
[1:54:45] and he who's us
[1:54:47] and draws us
[1:54:49] and he directs us
[1:54:52] see i remember a time and you say well
[1:54:54] brother shelly there's no long-lasting
[1:54:56] fruit that came out of it i want you to
[1:54:58] know that's a dirty lie i remember a
[1:55:00] time
[1:55:02] that a brother greely come along
[1:55:04] and he wanted to buy the old church van
[1:55:06] help us out
[1:55:08] and he bought the old church van
[1:55:10] o white church van
[1:55:12] and it had an eagle on it
[1:55:16] right
[1:55:17] and i think it said jesus christ the
[1:55:19] same yesterday and today and forever
[1:55:22] and brother greeley drives that van
[1:55:26] to a builder's association meeting
[1:55:30] and there's a renegade
[1:55:33] from california
[1:55:36] who's here to laytown
[1:55:39] with a cousin
[1:55:41] who's at that same builders
[1:55:43] association
[1:55:44] meeting and his name was steve valenti
[1:55:48] he sees that eagle
[1:55:51] and it reminds him
[1:55:53] of something from his past
[1:55:56] where a guy that he used to ride in the
[1:55:58] truck with had been listening to tapes
[1:56:00] of brother branham
[1:56:03] and he'd even tried to go to a church
[1:56:05] where this message was being preached
[1:56:07] but they didn't seem to be able to find
[1:56:09] a way to fit in and click in but for a
[1:56:12] while he embraced that word
[1:56:16] with everything that he had that wasn't
[1:56:18] by luck
[1:56:21] that wasn't by chance
[1:56:24] that wasn't by happenstance
[1:56:26] you say brother shelly where is that
[1:56:28] family i know exactly where they are
[1:56:31] they're on the west coast
[1:56:33] and they better be holding on for their
[1:56:35] life
[1:56:37] but i know there's a daughter here
[1:56:40] who married a young man from here
[1:56:42] who's raising some children here and i
[1:56:45] want you to know god loved kendra
[1:56:51] valenti
[1:56:53] enough
[1:56:55] that he allowed that meeting
[1:56:58] to take place that day
[1:57:00] brother greeley driving that van
[1:57:03] with an eagle on it
[1:57:04] brother see seeing that eagle and said
[1:57:06] hey there must be something to that they
[1:57:08] strike up a conversation and that family
[1:57:10] worships with us here for years
[1:57:13] now are they all still here they're not
[1:57:16] but god let us have a kendra and a milli
[1:57:19] and a nora
[1:57:20] out of that arrangement
[1:57:22] and i want you to know seed have been
[1:57:24] planted for the rest of that family
[1:57:28] and god doesn't lose anybody that
[1:57:30] belongs to him if you're with me you
[1:57:32] ought to say man that did not happen by
[1:57:35] luck
[1:57:40] it didn't happen by chance
[1:57:43] it didn't happen by happenstance
[1:57:46] it happened in the time and the order of
[1:57:49] a living god
[1:57:53] so you just go tell people party on
[1:57:57] toast on
[1:57:58] and make the best of your life while you
[1:58:01] can because if you are a part of that
[1:58:03] seed of god that's going to be expressed
[1:58:05] in the earth you will never outrun your
[1:58:08] destiny you will never outrun the god
[1:58:10] who saw you in the beginning you'll
[1:58:12] never be able to outrun the gene of his
[1:58:15] life
[1:58:16] that he deposited in you before you ever
[1:58:18] came to this earth
[1:58:20] you can't get away from that
[1:58:23] i'm losing my voice but you need to hear
[1:58:25] what i have to say before i close this
[1:58:27] morning
[1:58:29] i don't know what to you know we don't
[1:58:31] know what the rest looks like
[1:58:34] but i know where seed's been planted
[1:58:36] and i know that wasn't by mistake
[1:58:39] we could go around this room uh skip
[1:58:41] yantis
[1:58:43] we could go around this room
[1:58:45] because there was a little lady named
[1:58:47] betty pilkington
[1:58:48] that walked down to a mailbox to see
[1:58:51] her mail
[1:58:53] and you came by
[1:58:55] in your vehicle is that right was it you
[1:58:57] you came by in your vehicle you saw
[1:58:59] sister betty there and you thought oh
[1:59:01] she reminds me
[1:59:04] of uh of the sisters in the church that
[1:59:06] i come out of in texas
[1:59:10] you end up at some point striking a
[1:59:12] conversation with that lady
[1:59:18] say it go ahead
[1:59:21] right that's right because that's where
[1:59:23] she was living that was her place at the
[1:59:25] time where the curries live now
[1:59:27] and the next thing we know we're down
[1:59:29] there under the tabernacle having
[1:59:31] service and here comes this dark van

[1:59:54] there are things that have happened in
[1:59:55] the antis family that sadden us

[2:00:03] feelings

[2:05:34] 2022
[2:05:36] you're going to make it the same way
[2:05:38] you've always made it depending on the
[2:05:41] lord
[2:05:43] knowing that he will lead us
[2:05:46] if we lean on him
[2:05:48] [Applause]
[2:05:52] oh could i go on and i'll as soon as i
[2:05:55] get out of here i'll remember all the
[2:05:57] stories i wished i would have told
[2:05:59] all the connections that i used to would
[2:06:01] have told
[2:06:07] boy now my mind is reeling
[2:06:12] has everything that has happened with us
[2:06:15] been good and wonderful and glorious and
[2:06:18] no
[2:06:20] there's been hardship
[2:06:23] and heartache
[2:06:26] there's been joy and tears
[2:06:29] but none of it took god by surprise
[2:06:34] he has used it to build us to mold us to
[2:06:39] make us
[2:06:43] listen god hates divorce
[2:06:47] it's not god's plan
[2:06:49] but i realize that i am in a different
[2:06:52] position in my life today
[2:06:55] because of a voice that spoke to me and
[2:06:58] said your mom and dad are going to
[2:07:00] divorce
[2:07:04] i wasn't even five years old
[2:07:07] you're going to have some tough times
[2:07:09] but you're going to get through it and
[2:07:11] because you do there's going to be other
[2:07:13] young people that come to trust the lord
[2:07:15] because i trust me because i am going to
[2:07:18] bring you through this
[2:07:22] the bible tells us it was not so from
[2:07:24] the beginning i know that it wasn't
[2:07:26] god's perfect plan
[2:07:30] but i know that god saw it before he
[2:07:32] ever drew my mom and dad together he
[2:07:34] knew exactly what would drive them apart
[2:07:38] and he knew it enough to forewarn me
[2:07:41] nearly two years before it took place
[2:07:44] what was about to happen is just a very
[2:07:45] small toddler he spoke to me to prepare
[2:07:48] my heart because it was a part of his
[2:07:51] great big plan did it hurt and were
[2:07:53] there probably yes
[2:07:54] did you have troubles if you had some
[2:07:56] stuff
[2:07:58] so although none of these things are
[2:08:00] pleasant in themselves they keep
[2:08:02] bringing us closer and closer and closer
[2:08:05] to being fully surrendered to what god
[2:08:07] has for our lives
[2:08:09] oh hallelujah
[2:08:12] let's go on to the next paragraph
[2:08:15] and when the word or the water the
[2:08:17] washing of the water the word fell upon
[2:08:19] you it was expressed in a being
[2:08:23] now you have fellowship with your father
[2:08:27] god
[2:08:28] just as you have with your earthly
[2:08:31] father see let's keep going
[2:08:33] you are citizens of the king not
[2:08:35] citizens
[2:08:37] but your children sons and daughters of
[2:08:40] the living god if it be that the eternal
[2:08:42] life dwells in you now then if it was
[2:08:45] jesus was the fullness of god manifested
[2:08:48] he was the fullness of the godhead
[2:08:51] bodily keep going
[2:08:53] therefore when he came to the earth and
[2:08:55] was manifested in flesh you were here
[2:08:58] listen
[2:08:59] you were here in
[2:09:02] him
[2:09:03] then
[2:09:05] you believe that austin
[2:09:10] you were in him then
[2:09:13] because he was the word
[2:09:15] if you are a part of that word you
[2:09:17] always were a part of that word and
[2:09:19] therefore when that word was expressed
[2:09:21] in flesh you were identified in him in
[2:09:24] that word in the beginning was the word
[2:09:27] and the word was with god and the word
[2:09:28] was god and the word was made flesh and
[2:09:31] dwelt among us the word was made flesh
[2:09:37] what paragraph are we at can you tell me
[2:09:41] therefore you walked with him when you
[2:09:44] were in him
[2:09:46] when he was on earth you suffered with
[2:09:49] him and you died with him and you was
[2:09:52] buried with him
[2:09:54] and now you are risen with him
[2:09:58] i want to make sure you're hearing me
[2:10:00] you were risen with him and manifested
[2:10:03] attributes of god where are you at this
[2:10:06] morning setting
[2:10:09] shout that out again
[2:10:11] setting in
[2:10:12] heavenly places
[2:10:16] you thought you were just sitting in
[2:10:18] same old same old
[2:10:21] where you sit every sunday
[2:10:25] but the word says you are setting in
[2:10:29] heavenly places
[2:10:33] let's go on
[2:10:34] already raised
[2:10:37] resurrected to new life
[2:10:40] and setting in heavenly places in christ
[2:10:44] jesus oh
[2:10:45] that means so much nowadays church
[2:10:49] that means so much to us
[2:10:52] to see our self
[2:10:55] positionally placed in
[2:10:58] jesus christ
[2:11:00] now
[2:11:01] paragraph 33
[2:11:06] the last one
[2:11:08] now if we are those attributes of god
[2:11:11] we cannot live by creeds
[2:11:14] we cannot live by denominationalism
[2:11:18] we must
[2:11:20] read it for me
[2:11:23] we must live by the word because the
[2:11:26] bride is a part of the bridegroom like
[2:11:29] any wife is a part of her husband
[2:11:31] therefore
[2:11:33] we must be
[2:11:35] that word bride
[2:11:39] and what is that word bride
[2:11:45] the manifestation of this hour
[2:11:48] the bride not a creed or a denomination
[2:11:51] but a living oracle of god an expression
[2:11:55] of god's spoken word a living oracle of
[2:12:00] god a living attribute of god
[2:12:05] displaying to the world the attributes
[2:12:08] of god on your worst day
[2:12:11] we got to go
[2:12:13] on your worst day
[2:12:15] on your grumpy day
[2:12:19] chad i don't know why you came to my
[2:12:20] mind
[2:12:28] i talked to your boys
[2:12:36] i said to him
[2:12:38] your dad feeling any better no he wasn't
[2:12:40] feeling any better on the day he was
[2:12:41] grumpy
[2:12:44] i said
[2:12:45] your dad feeling any better
[2:12:47] yes sir he's feeling better he was
[2:12:49] grumpy
[2:12:52] now what would you think
[2:12:56] even on your grumpy day
[2:13:00] even on your bed head day
[2:13:03] bad hair day
[2:13:06] when you're at your worst
[2:13:10] when you're so rotten you stink
[2:13:14] your attitude's foul
[2:13:17] you've grumbled more than you praised
[2:13:21] you are still
[2:13:23] a living
[2:13:24] attribute of god
[2:13:29] he cannot
[2:13:31] lose you
[2:13:34] he will not
[2:13:35] lose you
[2:13:37] he will chase you he will pursue you he
[2:13:41] will wrap his arms around you until you
[2:13:44] surrender again to the life that he has
[2:13:48] chosen for you one that is not by luck
[2:13:51] not by chance not by happenstance
[2:13:56] but one that has a plan
[2:13:58] it has a purpose
[2:14:01] the manifestation of this hour expressed
[2:14:03] in this hour that we are now living in
[2:14:07] the same message things that are to be
[2:14:09] paragraph 41 it is 111. i got a little
[2:14:11] bit of time but i'm going to hurry
[2:14:16] i don't believe that a person just
[2:14:17] happened to be here by chance
[2:14:20] now just think when you come to the
[2:14:21] world everything had to be for prepared
[2:14:23] for you or pre-prepared rather for you
[2:14:28] do you understand that you are
[2:14:31] an amazing combination
[2:14:35] of your mom and dad
[2:14:37] you would have never been who you were
[2:14:41] i know some of you have said probably
[2:14:43] all four of mine
[2:14:45] at some point or another i wish so and
[2:14:47] so was my mama
[2:14:48] i wish so and so was my dad
[2:14:51] but don't ever let me hear you saying i
[2:14:54] might have to cut you off
[2:14:58] because there's probably been times
[2:15:00] when you was costing so much
[2:15:02] i wish so and so was your mom and your
[2:15:04] daddy too
[2:15:06] but you are what you are because you are
[2:15:09] a perfect combination
[2:15:12] genetically of your mom and dad you
[2:15:14] would not have been the same with
[2:15:17] another dad you would have not been the
[2:15:19] same without another mother god had to
[2:15:22] draw you together your parents together
[2:15:25] at just the right time
[2:15:28] and your mother and dad provided for you
[2:15:31] the body that you were going to live in
[2:15:33] but it was god who determined the living
[2:15:35] spirit that was going in you
[2:15:38] and he was going to put that in only you
[2:15:42] you didn't catch it because somebody
[2:15:44] else lost it
[2:15:46] somebody else died and didn't need it
[2:15:49] you got it because it was foreordained a
[2:15:51] portion of god's spirit for ordained for
[2:15:54] you before the world was ever formed
[2:15:59] he said i don't hardly understand that
[2:16:00] how that we could think that a god could
[2:16:02] prepare all these good things for us
[2:16:05] we could not put our trust in him
[2:16:08] that's what i want to talk about
[2:16:10] i wanted you to know you can trust him i
[2:16:13] want to tell somebody you can trust him
[2:16:20] i'm going to be real real
[2:16:23] plain
[2:16:25] on the other end of kendra there's a
[2:16:26] young man that could have had a wrong
[2:16:28] wife
[2:16:30] all of us could have had the wrong wife
[2:16:32] so he's no exception
[2:16:35] but a particular example of my point
[2:16:40] he could have had a wrong wife
[2:16:42] why are y'all looking at me like you
[2:16:43] feel sorry for him
[2:16:45] if this embarrasses him he ain't realize
[2:16:47] what he got
[2:16:50] i think you better know
[2:16:55] milly wouldn't be millie
[2:17:00] nor it wouldn't be nora
[2:17:02] if ben would have had another wife
[2:17:05] you think it don't matter
[2:17:10] it does matter
[2:17:15] he's got a brother that could have had a
[2:17:16] wrong wife
[2:17:22] but god
[2:17:24] but god
[2:17:26] but god
[2:17:28] sometimes the young people kid each
[2:17:30] other about how many they liked
[2:17:33] before they got to the one they got
[2:17:37] what does that matter
[2:17:39] as long as they weren't trying them all
[2:17:41] on for size
[2:17:44] when you're when you're a certain age
[2:17:46] you think you like something you you
[2:17:48] pick something out you pick somebody out
[2:17:50] you think that's the one i want to be
[2:17:51] with
[2:17:52] in a few few months or even a year so
[2:17:54] down the road you look back and you
[2:17:56] think what in the world
[2:17:59] was i thinking
[2:18:07] as i go through things sometimes i find
[2:18:09] pictures
[2:18:12] of girls that liked me
[2:18:16] and i thought i liked them
[2:18:18] and i didn't get them all tore up before
[2:18:20] i married
[2:18:23] i'll be digging through a box and i find
[2:18:25] them i don't even linger i just rip it
[2:18:27] up as fast as i can
[2:18:33] some of them ask me to be friends on
[2:18:35] facebook i say no
[2:18:40] i don't even want to be your friend
[2:18:45] just one glance
[2:18:47] i'm not talking about physical
[2:18:50] just one glance makes me so thankful to
[2:18:52] god
[2:18:54] that he spared me
[2:18:57] brought me the wife that he wanted me to
[2:18:59] have
[2:19:01] come on now
[2:19:03] it wasn't that i was such a catch that i
[2:19:05] was attracting so many it's that i was a
[2:19:08] target
[2:19:10] and satan wanted me to miss
[2:19:13] just like he wants you to miss
[2:19:20] there's a mother-in-law
[2:19:22] sitting back there one time that
[2:19:24] came to me and said brother jelly can
[2:19:25] you do anything with him
[2:19:30] i couldn't then and
[2:19:32] i can't do much with him now
[2:19:36] but i know this
[2:19:38] god had a wife for him
[2:19:42] sitting here this morning
[2:19:44] and three children to raise in the
[2:19:45] service of the lord with a good hearts
[2:19:48] good hearts
[2:19:50] and great personalities and good respect
[2:19:54] and anything could have happened
[2:19:57] had they not waited
[2:19:59] to know that they had gotten a hold of
[2:20:01] the right one
[2:20:04] i don't want to drag it up but boy it's
[2:20:05] on my mind i'm feeling old
[2:20:09] he's the only person in this room
[2:20:12] that ever answered a question like this
[2:20:16] because he
[2:20:17] there was this old gal that had her
[2:20:19] hooks on him
[2:20:22] why are you all so quiet
[2:20:24] i'm talking about chad
[2:20:28] there was this old girl that had her
[2:20:30] hooks on him
[2:20:33] [Music]
[2:20:36] i had a name for her
[2:20:40] and i can't say it because olivia don't
[2:20:41] lie for me to say this word it's not a
[2:20:44] curse word she just don't like hearing
[2:20:48] and i said this is not going to work
[2:20:52] this is not going to work this is never
[2:20:54] going to work this can't be right
[2:20:56] this girl's got a spirit on her
[2:21:00] there's no way in the world this would
[2:21:02] ever work
[2:21:03] i want you to tell me right now what i
[2:21:05] can do
[2:21:07] to help get this thing
[2:21:10] split now i realize the more i talk the
[2:21:13] more like a cult we'll we're gonna sound
[2:21:18] just hit me pretty hard
[2:21:22] i said
[2:21:23] what is it gonna take for you to get her
[2:21:25] out of your mind
[2:21:28] and out of your heart
[2:21:32] and he reached in his pocket
[2:21:34] and pulled out his wallet
[2:21:36] and laid it on the table
[2:21:38] and he said i guess you're gonna have to
[2:21:39] paddle me
[2:21:45] he was in school
[2:21:48] the pastor let me just say
[2:21:51] as a pastor i don't go around paddling
[2:21:53] people
[2:22:00] and for those of you who feel sorry i
[2:22:02] feel all that old unsanctified mercy
[2:22:04] coming up now and everybody feels sorry
[2:22:06] for him
[2:22:07] we could have paddled him every day of
[2:22:09] school and never caught up with all he
[2:22:10] deserved
[2:22:12] so don't you think he just
[2:22:14] looked up
[2:22:17] he said i think you're going to have to
[2:22:18] paddle me i said all right
[2:22:20] let's let's get ready
[2:22:23] and i did
[2:22:29] and guess what
[2:22:31] i beat him right out of her heart
[2:22:35] no
[2:22:38] that's not the way it works
[2:22:40] he made a conscious decision that day i
[2:22:44] better wait for god's choice for
[2:22:48] me come on
[2:22:51] and he did
[2:22:53] how many years later
[2:22:58] anniversary how many years you've been
[2:22:59] married
[2:23:05] they've been so engrossed in the story
[2:23:09] it's like popcorn huh
[2:23:11] 22
[2:23:13] years
[2:23:16] three
[2:23:17] amazing
[2:23:18] godly gifted children
[2:23:22] that wouldn't be here today
[2:23:25] had that old
[2:23:28] got her claws on him
[2:23:32] and what did you do i prayed for her
[2:23:35] that god would help her
[2:23:39] she's been through several sins
[2:23:42] and i still pray for her
[2:23:45] but there's a time
[2:23:47] that the enemy will launch every attack
[2:23:51] that he has because you're a target
[2:23:56] and god has to arrange in a line and
[2:23:59] place
[2:24:02] and if he has such a great glorious
[2:24:05] track record back there
[2:24:08] isn't he the same god today
[2:24:12] your purpose is to reflect the light
[2:24:15] to this generation
[2:24:19] he said that if he brought us in this
[2:24:20] chaos that we're in now and prepared the
[2:24:23] good things of our life for us here how
[2:24:26] much more can we trust him to prepare
[2:24:28] the things that is to come see the
[2:24:30] eternal things it seems i say it's very
[2:24:33] strange listen he's telling us that god
[2:24:36] can if god can take care of the natural
[2:24:38] he can take care of the spiritual if god
[2:24:40] can prepare good things for us along the
[2:24:42] way in life he can prepare a good
[2:24:44] eternity for us if you believe that same
[2:24:46] man brother branham said in 1963 that
[2:24:48] hezekiah's sickness with boils
[2:24:51] was not by chance
[2:24:56] he said it happened for a reason
[2:24:58] in john 11 4 i don't have time to read
[2:25:00] it
[2:25:01] in john 11 4 jesus is talking he's just
[2:25:05] got the news that lazarus is sick
[2:25:08] and he is
[2:25:10] reacting to the news and he says this
[2:25:13] sickness is not unto death but for the
[2:25:15] glory of god lazarus sickness and his
[2:25:18] death was a part of god's plan
[2:25:22] hello
[2:25:23] hezekiah's boils
[2:25:25] was a part of god's plan
[2:25:28] in john 9 we read about a blind man and
[2:25:31] the folks are trying to decide whose
[2:25:33] sins it are who sins it word whose sins
[2:25:35] it was
[2:25:39] that caused him to be blind
[2:25:41] john 9 1-3
[2:25:43] and jesus said neither
[2:25:45] hath this man's sin nor his parents but
[2:25:48] that the works of god should be made
[2:25:49] manifest in him it was a part of god's
[2:25:51] perfect plan that that man be blind
[2:25:57] because it was only by that that god
[2:25:59] could be glorified when he opened his
[2:26:02] eyes so the good the bad and the ugly in
[2:26:06] the message this day the scripture is
[2:26:07] fulfilled i won't read it
[2:26:09] it's paragraph 37 and 38 you can look at
[2:26:12] it later they could put it on the screen
[2:26:13] but if they do you might not listen to
[2:26:15] me
[2:26:16] brother branham is rehearsing what
[2:26:17] happened the day
[2:26:18] before he's talking about the mistake
[2:26:21] that was made he gets the new bible
[2:26:23] sister alfreda can tell you this very
[2:26:25] well because she was in you were in the
[2:26:27] service
[2:26:28] this lady right here for the put your
[2:26:30] hand up because there's some still don't
[2:26:31] know who you are
[2:26:33] sister elfrida was in the service
[2:26:36] brother branham's just been given a new
[2:26:37] bible he's going to john i think it was
[2:26:39] chapter 16 he was wanting to read from
[2:26:42] but he was reading out of john 17
[2:26:43] because he said the india paper was so
[2:26:46] thin
[2:26:47] in that bible that the bottom of the
[2:26:48] page stuck together and he thought all
[2:26:50] along he's just reading away he thought
[2:26:52] he was reading the right
[2:26:54] place of scripture how many of you
[2:26:55] remember this you know the story at
[2:26:57] least
[2:26:58] and this priest rose up
[2:27:01] and began to calm brother branham maybe
[2:27:03] you'll flash that up i think i think you
[2:27:05] can show us
[2:27:07] i think i can read just what he said
[2:27:10] in paragraph 37
[2:27:13] he said cause i think nothing happens
[2:27:16] by chance
[2:27:18] i was thinking about the comfort of this
[2:27:20] brother here coming telling me hold
[2:27:22] steady
[2:27:24] him being a priest oh steady
[2:27:26] maybe god is going to do something or
[2:27:28] something in that manner and i thought
[2:27:30] how could that be here's a mistake an
[2:27:33] embarrassing mistake have you ever been
[2:27:36] in an embarrassing situation
[2:27:39] brother braham's embarrassed he's
[2:27:40] standing before the full gospel
[2:27:41] businessmen
[2:27:44] in a great convention lots of things are
[2:27:45] happening this is a powerful few days of
[2:27:47] service some of the best
[2:27:50] and here he stands up
[2:27:52] his pages stick together he's trying to
[2:27:55] take a text he can't find the text
[2:27:58] he doesn't know what's happened
[2:28:01] and here's a priest that raises up on
[2:28:02] the front
[2:28:03] seat
[2:28:05] and steadies brother branham
[2:28:07] well maybe this has happened for a
[2:28:09] reason or something
[2:28:10] maybe god's going to show himself or
[2:28:12] show us something
[2:28:15] that prophet of god who had heard from
[2:28:17] god who had seen visions who was led by
[2:28:19] the spirit in that moment he wasn't even
[2:28:22] considering that
[2:28:23] he was considering how how how what a
[2:28:26] tether he got into reading the wrong and
[2:28:28] how will i correct oh what am i
[2:28:30] have you ever thought of that
[2:28:33] it took somebody on the outside to stand
[2:28:35] up and say
[2:28:37] now if you don't believe that that's how
[2:28:39] he took it look at the next next
[2:28:40] paragraph he said and then sitting there
[2:28:43] like a thunderbolt out of heaven it came
[2:28:45] to me
[2:28:48] the priests recognized that god was
[2:28:51] using this
[2:28:53] and that it was not a mistake
[2:28:55] i want you to hear me
[2:28:57] it was not a mistake
[2:28:59] it was not a victory for the devil
[2:29:03] the enemy had not won a goal
[2:29:07] god was doing something
[2:29:09] brother branham was unaware at that
[2:29:11] moment of what god was doing but when he
[2:29:13] sat down later and pondered it he said
[2:29:15] it hit me like a thunderbolt out of
[2:29:17] heaven
[2:29:19] he said and god took me to the scripture
[2:29:21] in luke
[2:29:24] where jesus is standing up in the
[2:29:26] synagogue
[2:29:27] and he's reading the prophecy of isaiah
[2:29:31] and the spirit of the lord fell on him
[2:29:32] he closed the book the bible said and he
[2:29:35] went to sit down and before he did he
[2:29:37] did something that was unimaginable
[2:29:40] he was not called up there to give
[2:29:42] commentary on the reading of the portion
[2:29:45] he was called to read it only and sit
[2:29:47] down this was the custom in the
[2:29:49] synagogue but after and listen listen
[2:29:52] notice that it was god who had jesus
[2:29:56] reading his own commission
[2:29:59] any other sabbath
[2:30:01] would have taken them to somewhere else
[2:30:03] in the prophecies
[2:30:05] but that day when jesus kept his custom
[2:30:08] that when he was in nazareth he attended
[2:30:10] the synagogue in nazareth he was there
[2:30:12] at the right day at the right time the
[2:30:14] scroll was unrolled to the right place
[2:30:17] he begins to read right where god wanted
[2:30:19] him to read and he was reading his own
[2:30:21] commission
[2:30:22] and when he closed the book the bible
[2:30:24] said which wasn't a book at all after
[2:30:26] all we know that a scroll
[2:30:28] just like the ones
[2:30:29] sitting up here
[2:30:31] he walks away and as he's walking away
[2:30:33] he says this day
[2:30:36] the scripture is fulfilled
[2:30:39] in your ears
[2:30:42] that's what god was saying
[2:30:44] in that happening that happened that day
[2:30:47] god has a message
[2:30:49] he has a word and there's a timing for
[2:30:52] that word come on now and so brother
[2:30:55] branham was then invited by democrat to
[2:30:57] stand the next night it was not his
[2:30:59] night to preach and he did not preach
[2:31:01] the message that we have this day the
[2:31:04] scripture is fulfilled is not a message
[2:31:05] it's only 20 something pages long
[2:31:07] it was it was it was the full gospel
[2:31:09] businessman giving brother branham an
[2:31:12] opportunity to explain
[2:31:15] that indeed the priest was right what
[2:31:17] looked like a mistake to brother branham
[2:31:19] what looked like a mistake to many
[2:31:21] others there was a priest there who
[2:31:23] caught it i wished you could hear what
[2:31:25] i'm saying
[2:31:27] oh he caught it and he said wait a
[2:31:30] minute
[2:31:32] don't trouble yourself
[2:31:34] calm yourself maybe it is and god is
[2:31:38] going to speak to us
[2:31:40] whoa and he did he wanted that valley he
[2:31:43] wanted that valley that arizona valley
[2:31:45] he wanted him to know that just like a
[2:31:47] prophet had raised up in the bible a
[2:31:50] prophet had been raised up among them
[2:31:53] and they ought to listen they ought to
[2:31:54] listen to what he was saying because the
[2:31:56] scripture was being fulfilled in their
[2:31:57] ears
[2:31:59] it's powerful
[2:32:01] so you may think that this is a mistake
[2:32:03] and that's been a mistake and that's
[2:32:04] been a mistake i want you to know these
[2:32:07] things that have happened along the way
[2:32:08] could absolutely be god bringing us
[2:32:10] somewhere taking us somewhere we may not
[2:32:13] see the message until we're sitting down
[2:32:15] one day with our mind on him and it hits
[2:32:18] us like a thunderbolt
[2:32:20] oh now that makes sense
[2:32:24] anybody with me
[2:32:28] let's see how personal i can get by with
[2:32:32] here's austin
[2:32:34] a young man
[2:32:36] not so young man
[2:32:37] but a young man
[2:32:39] not yet married
[2:32:41] been through a lot in his life
[2:32:43] failed a lot
[2:32:45] found a lot of grace
[2:32:46] found a lot of mercy
[2:32:48] don't you think he sits there wondering
[2:32:50] sometime when my time is coming
[2:32:56] don't you think that he hears these
[2:32:57] engagement announcements
[2:32:59] and don't you think that ever the
[2:33:01] thought ever crosses his mind when's my
[2:33:03] time coming
[2:33:04] he's not the only one he's just the one
[2:33:06] sitting right there in the front
[2:33:08] i want to say to him
[2:33:10] god doesn't make mistakes
[2:33:15] and he has not forgotten
[2:33:17] he has a plan for you you've not missed
[2:33:20] his plan
[2:33:22] you're waiting on his plan
[2:33:27] and you're as good as the best
[2:33:29] and better than the
[2:33:32] rest what billy andrews used to tell
[2:33:35] people
[2:33:36] because sometimes you get this idea i'm
[2:33:38] less than
[2:33:41] because you've got a past
[2:33:44] and billy andrews used to say i'll get
[2:33:45] her from there and quit feeling sorry
[2:33:46] for yourself your good is the best and
[2:33:49] better than the rest
[2:33:50] he said this message i'll tell you what
[2:33:52] he said he said this message didn't come
[2:33:53] for junk
[2:33:55] god sent this message for his elect his
[2:33:57] choice his bride the very fact you're
[2:33:59] hearing this message is proof of what
[2:34:01] you mean to god
[2:34:03] so he said you dismiss yourself and
[2:34:04] disqualify yourself but you're wrong to
[2:34:06] do that god has a plan
[2:34:14] steady yourself
[2:34:17] just hold on
[2:34:21] people cannot not people can
[2:34:22] misunderstand
[2:34:25] i know a young man that feels like he
[2:34:27] has a promise from god
[2:34:29] and he's waited and waited and waited
[2:34:30] and waited
[2:34:32] that promise hasn't been fulfilled
[2:34:36] he's been mocked and made fun of and
[2:34:37] ridiculed
[2:34:39] and cursed
[2:34:43] cursed out
[2:34:45] all because he was holding on to
[2:34:47] something he felt like god told him
[2:34:49] and as long as there was
[2:34:51] any possibility that it could be he
[2:34:53] wanted to hold on to that and i've never
[2:34:55] seen anybody i mean i'm being honest
[2:34:57] i've never seen anybody so privately
[2:34:59] attacked
[2:35:02] i've never seen such text messages and
[2:35:04] inboxes and instagram messages come to
[2:35:06] somebody who was just trying to hold on
[2:35:09] just trying to believe
[2:35:11] he believed that god spoke to him he's
[2:35:12] waiting on that word to come to pass
[2:35:15] he had a token of that he was holding on
[2:35:17] to that token
[2:35:18] i've never seen such a liking
[2:35:22] not too long ago a young man fell away
[2:35:25] from the lord and backslid and reached
[2:35:27] out and said he was going to come down
[2:35:28] here and whoop him and
[2:35:31] beat him and i don't know what all he
[2:35:33] was going to do and cussed and used the
[2:35:34] f words and all kind of supposed to be a
[2:35:36] young man raised in the message of truth
[2:35:41] and this young man just answered back
[2:35:42] i'm just trying look i'm not trying to
[2:35:44] cause you any trouble i'm just trying to
[2:35:46] hold on to what i feel like the lord has
[2:35:48] spoken to my heart come on folks
[2:35:51] what's wrong with
[2:35:52] people what you don't understand is god
[2:35:56] may be doing this
[2:36:12] there's others in this room waiting on a
[2:36:13] promise
[2:36:18] let's be careful not to be naysayers
[2:36:23] in one moment
[2:36:30] we gotta go
[2:36:33] he's
[2:36:34] here telling you the lord is here
[2:36:38] strange service strange atmosphere
[2:36:41] he's here
[2:36:43] all he has to do
[2:36:45] is step over to that one that's holding
[2:36:47] on to that promise
[2:36:49] it's like the angel of the lord passing
[2:36:51] through that neighborhood that night
[2:36:52] where them two women had a promise from
[2:36:54] god
[2:36:55] brother brahm had already pronounced
[2:36:57] them healed
[2:36:59] and there was no manifestation of that
[2:37:01] healing
[2:37:03] and one morning those two neighbors
[2:37:05] got their miracle
[2:37:07] at the very same time
[2:37:11] ran out into the
[2:37:12] road and was running to meet each other
[2:37:14] to tell each other what god had done and
[2:37:16] come to find out they both got their
[2:37:17] miracle at the same time brother branham
[2:37:19] was asked about that
[2:37:21] and he said well that was the angel of
[2:37:23] the lord walking through that
[2:37:24] neighborhood watching over the word of
[2:37:26] promise
[2:37:34] that old lying filthy
[2:37:37] devil
[2:37:39] the enemy of god
[2:37:41] the one who's painted a target on your
[2:37:43] back that wants to take you out and
[2:37:44] cause you to not believe
[2:37:46] that god's promises to you are true you
[2:37:48] ought to raise up today and tell him
[2:37:49] he's a liar
[2:37:51] you ought to raise up today and tell him
[2:37:52] you've listened to his lie long enough
[2:37:54] you're going to hold on to the promise
[2:37:56] of god god does not make mistakes you're
[2:37:58] not living your 2022 by luck or chance
[2:38:01] or happenstance you're living it by the
[2:38:03] divine program of the living god
[2:38:08] [Applause]
[2:38:18] every time i tell something personal we
[2:38:20] usually fall under some kind of attack
[2:38:24] spiritually so i pray that you will pray
[2:38:27] for my family and for their grace and
[2:38:29] their protection
[2:38:33] benjamin wanted to be married
[2:38:35] he felt like the lord had given him the
[2:38:37] girl that he was to marry
[2:38:40] he saw it way before the rest of his
[2:38:42] family saw it
[2:38:46] he begged me
[2:38:48] nearly a year ago
[2:38:50] but he was heading to texas
[2:38:53] is it all right if i should talk to her
[2:38:55] daddy
[2:38:56] and i said no
[2:38:58] it's not time
[2:39:01] it's just not time
[2:39:04] but daddy i yeah i know
[2:39:07] i know but it's just not time
[2:39:11] she didn't understand the delay we
[2:39:13] didn't know that until a few days ago
[2:39:16] she didn't understand the delay
[2:39:19] he didn't understand the delay
[2:39:21] here's how it came out
[2:39:23] we're sitting in our living room after
[2:39:24] they've after he has proposed and we've
[2:39:27] made a few plans and it's the day i
[2:39:29] think before she leaves and sitting
[2:39:30] there and even jenna spoke up
[2:39:33] and she said i didn't understand it
[2:39:35] i didn't understand it then but she said
[2:39:37] tonight i understand it
[2:39:39] she said i know that we have found the
[2:39:43] right time this is the right
[2:39:46] time
[2:39:48] benjamin said the same dad i didn't
[2:39:50] understand but now i know
[2:39:52] that we have found the right time does
[2:39:55] that mean anything
[2:39:58] does that mean anything no it means
[2:40:00] everything it doesn't mean anything it
[2:40:02] means everything
[2:40:05] to know that you're in the will of god
[2:40:07] is 50 of the battle
[2:40:10] to know that you're in the timing of god
[2:40:13] is the other 50 of the battle
[2:40:16] young people get it in their mind
[2:40:17] sometime and they'll say things like
[2:40:19] well what if jesus tarries them we don't
[2:40:20] ever get to have our let me tell you
[2:40:22] something that matters to you tonight
[2:40:25] but one breath of eternity
[2:40:29] what if we what if we wait so long we
[2:40:31] don't get to have babies before the lord
[2:40:32] comes are you really going to hold up
[2:40:34] the rapture for for labor pains
[2:40:43] you didn't come here for just the
[2:40:44] purpose of marrying and giving in
[2:40:46] marriage and having babies you are here
[2:40:49] to reflect the light
[2:40:51] you are here to manifest the word for
[2:40:54] your day
[2:40:56] and in order to do it you've got to find
[2:40:58] god's will you got to get in it you got
[2:40:59] to find god's timing you've got to get
[2:41:02] in it and if you don't understand it
[2:41:04] have a right spirit
[2:41:07] we never knew
[2:41:09] we never knew jenna was bothered by it i
[2:41:11] never really knew benjamin was bothered
[2:41:13] by it i'm used to him being bothered
[2:41:14] with me
[2:41:18] but they just kept it
[2:41:21] trust it
[2:41:24] in 2022 if jesus tarries
[2:41:27] it seems to be the right timing end of
[2:41:30] june
[2:41:32] seems to be the right timing
[2:41:35] and if it is there's not enough devils
[2:41:37] in hell that would be able to stop it
[2:41:41] and if it's not the right timing we
[2:41:43] trust a god who knows how to rise up and
[2:41:46] say
[2:41:52] thank you for your grace and protection
[2:41:53] over my family
[2:41:55] my times are in my hand i'm going to
[2:41:58] close
[2:42:02] but before i do
[2:42:04] i want to read something else from
[2:42:06] shalom
[2:42:07] 139 we have time
[2:42:10] see i did good i only come with eight
[2:42:13] pages today
[2:42:14] i got to all five of them five of the
[2:42:16] eight
[2:42:20] paragraph 141
[2:42:22] i shared this with the church in japan
[2:42:27] and it blesses my blesser
[2:42:30] to know that foose was
[2:42:33] interpreting that day
[2:42:37] changing the pages are changing
[2:42:39] calendars
[2:42:41] doesn't change time
[2:42:46] a lot of people say well the old year's
[2:42:48] gone throw away the old december
[2:42:49] calendar now and put up the other one a
[2:42:51] new year
[2:42:53] that's that's what new year's means to
[2:42:54] them
[2:42:56] let's read on
[2:42:58] to me
[2:42:59] i want to see what's promised for the
[2:43:01] day
[2:43:02] hear me
[2:43:04] i want to know what the light of the
[2:43:05] hour is
[2:43:09] i want to know what word god's standing
[2:43:11] on for 2022
[2:43:13] because that's what i want to get around
[2:43:15] that's what i want to rally around
[2:43:17] that's what i want to amen that's what i
[2:43:19] want to cooperate with
[2:43:21] brother branham said i want to know what
[2:43:22] the light of the hour is so i can know
[2:43:24] how to walk in it
[2:43:26] i want to know where i'm living what age
[2:43:29] i'm in
[2:43:31] how far up the road am i
[2:43:37] as paul said
[2:43:40] i could stand quoting again
[2:43:43] forgetting those things
[2:43:47] that are behind that are past
[2:43:51] now i press towards the mark the high
[2:43:54] calling to the complete
[2:43:58] identification
[2:44:00] when all time will fade out into
[2:44:02] eternity when jesus comes
[2:44:05] do as david did put
[2:44:08] your future young person old person
[2:44:12] in between person
[2:44:15] even if you're sitting here today and
[2:44:17] you think i've i've lived a whole lot
[2:44:20] more back there
[2:44:22] i've got a lot more days behind me than
[2:44:25] i do ahead of me even if you know that
[2:44:27] is probably your reality
[2:44:30] don't underestimate
[2:44:32] god's ability to move in your life in
[2:44:36] 2022.
[2:44:39] do as david did put your future into his
[2:44:42] hands don't look to anything else put
[2:44:45] david said here my time
[2:44:48] is in
[2:44:49] his hands
[2:44:52] you notice here in the psalms where we
[2:44:54] read it my time is in his hand he is my
[2:44:56] rock what is he he has revealed to me he
[2:44:59] is the revealed truth my time is in his
[2:45:01] hands amen oh my there you are
[2:45:05] my time belongs to him i am his i'm in
[2:45:08] his hand because he holds the time
[2:45:11] i don't know what the future holds but i
[2:45:13] know he holds the future so he who holds
[2:45:16] the future holds me
[2:45:17] so why should i think about setting
[2:45:19] forth this that the other for the new
[2:45:22] year
[2:45:23] you know
[2:45:26] statistics say that uh
[2:45:28] most new year's resolutions last on
[2:45:31] average of 20 hours
[2:45:37] that's not very long is it
[2:45:40] 20 hours
[2:45:43] one little precious girl she came to me
[2:45:45] this morning before service and she told
[2:45:47] me what her new year's resolution was
[2:45:50] but she didn't call it a new year's
[2:45:51] resolution
[2:45:53] she just reported it as a testimony
[2:45:55] and she said i'm not going to lie to my
[2:45:57] mom and daddy anymore
[2:46:01] i'm going to believe that that's more
[2:46:02] than just a resolution
[2:46:04] i'm going to believe that that is her
[2:46:06] faith declaration
[2:46:07] god will honor her to keep that but i'm
[2:46:09] looking down there and i'm thinking
[2:46:10] isn't that the most amazing thing to say
[2:46:12] i'm not going to lie to my mom and daddy
[2:46:14] anymore
[2:46:15] you don't think she knows
[2:46:18] she must know
[2:46:21] my time is in his hand knew that god
[2:46:22] whole the future david didn't know the
[2:46:24] future was but he knowed god had the
[2:46:26] future i don't know what the future is
[2:46:28] none of us do but we know he holds the
[2:46:30] future do you believe god holds your
[2:46:32] 2022
[2:46:33] now i want you to listen very carefully
[2:46:34] and i i've said that probably a hundred
[2:46:37] times
[2:46:38] patience
[2:46:40] why did he have to go and say this
[2:46:45] some of you would have much preferred if
[2:46:46] i would have stopped to paragraph 145
[2:46:49] but i put 146 in here just for you
[2:46:52] patience patience
[2:46:55] some of us get so some of us get in such
[2:46:57] a hurry
[2:47:00] i think a many a good man has done that
[2:47:03] you get in too much of a hurry you want
[2:47:06] to see you want to do it yourself
[2:47:09] and minister brethren you know from
[2:47:11] where i'm talking when i'm talking you
[2:47:13] that's listening to this tape i'm
[2:47:14] talking to you not only to the little
[2:47:16] congregation here but men around the
[2:47:18] world and this is not only to ministers
[2:47:20] but it works
[2:47:22] many men go out impatient
[2:47:25] but believing that the time is near you
[2:47:27] try to do something within yourself
[2:47:30] wait
[2:47:32] oh
[2:47:34] wait musicians are coming
[2:47:37] wait
[2:47:39] upon the lord
[2:47:42] it'd be better not to do it than to do
[2:47:44] it in the wrong timing
[2:47:47] yes
[2:47:49] you can destroy
[2:47:51] the brand of speaking to brother neville
[2:47:54] you get 99 right

[2:48:02] lot a little out of season just get a
[2:48:04] little pulled or pressed or somebody
[2:48:06] pull on you
[2:48:11] i got to wear when i was traveling among
[2:48:12] the charismatic people
[2:48:14] some people would be bold enough to say
[2:48:15] do you have a word of prophecy for me i
[2:48:17] said i sure do acts 2 38 repent and be
[2:48:20] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[2:48:22] christ for the remission of your sins
[2:48:23] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:48:24] holy ghost
[2:48:26] sometime i just kept walking
[2:48:28] knowing that they were studying there
[2:48:30] was such a letdown
[2:48:32] because they wanted something that would
[2:48:34] build them up and tell them all the good
[2:48:35] things that are about to happen in their
[2:48:36] life
[2:48:37] i'm not even going to move into
[2:48:38] something like that when we don't get
[2:48:40] the abcs right
[2:48:42] we better come back and get the abc's
[2:48:44] right
[2:48:45] amen
[2:48:46] we better be sanctified by the washing
[2:48:48] of the water of the word and baptized in
[2:48:49] the name of the lord jesus christ filled
[2:48:51] with the holy ghost
[2:48:53] many men go out impatient but believing
[2:48:55] that the time is near you try to do
[2:48:56] something within yourself wait upon the
[2:48:58] lord
[2:49:00] patience is virtue if you can have
[2:49:02] patience it's virtue it's virtue
[2:49:04] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[2:49:09] their strength
[2:49:11] now they that try to get ahead of the
[2:49:13] lord they that try to tell the lord
[2:49:16] lord i know you want me to do this and
[2:49:18] glory to god i
[2:49:20] don't do that
[2:49:22] wait
[2:49:23] upon the lord
[2:49:25] the bible said they that wait upon the
[2:49:27] lord shall
[2:49:29] renew their strength
[2:49:32] in 2022
[2:49:34] you don't want to get ahead of god
[2:49:40] let me say it again
[2:49:41] in 2022 you don't want to get ahead of
[2:49:43] god
[2:49:45] in 2022 you don't want to get behind god
[2:49:48] in 2022 you want to walk with him
[2:49:52] come on now
[2:49:53] and in order to do that you must
[2:49:55] understand
[2:49:57] that this is not happening in your life
[2:49:59] by look or chance or happenstance
[2:50:02] god has a plan he has a program
[2:50:05] he has a symphony
[2:50:07] and you were part of that symphony
[2:50:10] in the message shalom in phoenix
[2:50:14] that was in sierra vista
[2:50:17] in the message shalom
[2:50:19] i'll do i'll skip 232 and i'll do 261.
[2:50:23] oh lord
[2:50:24] let me stay with him the word
[2:50:29] it should be the last quote you have
[2:50:31] there
[2:50:33] paragraph 261 would you just play
[2:50:35] something soft
[2:50:40] shalom uh
[2:50:42] sorry this is sierra vista
[2:50:44] i'm skipping the one in phoenix that's
[2:50:46] maybe what you're i'm so sorry
[2:50:50] are you finding it
[2:50:55] don't ever
[2:50:57] hold
[2:50:59] any of these little ladies or
[2:51:01] well it's all right if you hold nathan
[2:51:03] responsible
[2:51:04] but don't ever hold these young ladies
[2:51:06] responsible because
[2:51:08] to follow me as a
[2:51:11] a gift
[2:51:14] this is it
[2:51:16] oh lord let me stay with him
[2:51:19] the word
[2:51:21] and manifest his light
[2:51:24] through all of us
[2:51:26] as we set forth in this new year
[2:51:29] with the determination
[2:51:31] not knowing what this new year holds
[2:51:35] but we're holding to him the word
[2:51:38] that knows the whole
[2:51:40] symphony
[2:51:42] from the beginning
[2:51:44] to the end
[2:51:50] don't you like that
[2:51:55] you stand up there with your symbols
[2:51:57] ready
[2:52:01] you look down and you see the trumpets
[2:52:03] they're just all the time playing
[2:52:06] the violin all the time playing just
[2:52:08] play play play they just get all the
[2:52:10] spotlight
[2:52:13] you're standing up there with your
[2:52:14] triangle or your symbols
[2:52:17] and you're wondering when will it ever
[2:52:19] be my turn
[2:52:22] you're just about discouraged
[2:52:25] you're gonna quit the symphony
[2:52:27] they don't need me
[2:52:30] they don't never let me play
[2:52:33] there's no part for me in this and all
[2:52:34] of a sudden when you're just about ready
[2:52:37] to pack up your little triangle or your
[2:52:39] little symbols and and go home because
[2:52:41] you're not necessary
[2:52:44] the conductor of the symphony looks
[2:52:46] right at you
[2:52:48] and he reminds you it's your turn
[2:52:51] and you've been waiting that whole piece
[2:52:53] of music maybe you've been waiting the
[2:52:55] whole evening
[2:52:58] and now it's your turn
[2:53:00] you almost got cheated out of your
[2:53:02] moment
[2:53:04] because you were beginning to find that
[2:53:05] your little tone your little your little
[2:53:07] contribution you were beginning to think
[2:53:09] it wasn't important
[2:53:13] and now the finger the stick of the the
[2:53:15] baton of the of the conductor is pointed
[2:53:18] at you and you cannot miss the beat
[2:53:22] the one thing you don't want to do is
[2:53:25] play your little triangle
[2:53:27] out of rhythm
[2:53:29] or clash your symbols
[2:53:32] out of rhythm
[2:53:34] because then you've messed the whole
[2:53:36] symphony song the beautiful
[2:53:41] wonderful
[2:53:42] composition you messed it up
[2:53:46] because you got tired of waiting on his
[2:53:48] baton
[2:53:51] you sold yourself out as not having an
[2:53:54] important role
[2:53:59] and the baton is now in your direction
[2:54:02] and it is time for you to do what god
[2:54:04] called you to do and if you've only got
[2:54:07] one strike of a triangle or one clash of
[2:54:09] the of the symbols it ought to be you
[2:54:11] ought to give it everything you've got
[2:54:14] you better make sure that it's on rhythm
[2:54:16] you better make sure that it's in the
[2:54:17] right timing you better make sure if
[2:54:20] you're to strike more than once you do
[2:54:21] don't you dare be out of place and this
[2:54:24] is how brother branham is preaching in
[2:54:26] this message shalom and this is only the
[2:54:28] end here but he's talking about he knows
[2:54:31] the whole symphony he knows how to bring
[2:54:33] the instruments in and he knows how to
[2:54:35] push them out and bring in another
[2:54:37] section as the music rises and falls and
[2:54:41] each one has their part to play
[2:54:44] everybody can't play the tuba i'm so
[2:54:46] thankful
[2:54:48] everybody can't be the tuba player
[2:54:51] everybody can't be the woodwind
[2:54:54] you have to be your part you must play
[2:54:57] your role and you must be ready at any
[2:55:00] time for the baton of the conductor
[2:55:04] to come in your direction
[2:55:07] and give
[2:55:08] to the people what god has placed in
[2:55:10] your life
[2:55:12] stand with me would you
[2:55:15] what an unusual
[2:55:19] atmosphere

[2:58:52] billy tebow is
[2:58:55] how old are working at dale champs
[2:58:58] 21 years old
[2:59:01] working at dell champs in mobile
[2:59:04] and there is a romanian brother young
[2:59:07] brother there were two i think two
[2:59:09] members of the family worked there
[2:59:11] didn't they just one
[2:59:16] they were coming up here to visit i just
[2:59:18] shared this with our brother here
[2:59:20] because he knows the family very well
[2:59:23] [Music]
[2:59:26] they were coming to our services on
[2:59:27] sunday driving all the way from mobile
[2:59:29] and god was doing some amazing things
[2:59:32] and they were taking videotapes home and
[2:59:34] sharing it with loved ones
[2:59:37] and billy was searching for the lord he
[2:59:39] you know his testimony you've heard it
[2:59:42] regardless of the things that he's
[2:59:44] walked through in his life
[2:59:46] the fact that he's still standing today
[2:59:51] and sound
[2:59:53] is a testimony that it was god who found
[2:59:55] him and sustained him
[3:00:00] they take that
[3:00:01] tape and bring it and billy's hungry and
[3:00:04] talking they're talking to him about
[3:00:05] what god's done in our day and he takes
[3:00:07] that video and
[3:00:08] it gets in the hand of his mother he
[3:00:10] takes it to mississippi to his mother
[3:00:13] and she gets a hold of that tape and how
[3:00:14] many of you know her testimony i don't
[3:00:16] have to tell it
[3:00:21] those people had to come all the way
[3:00:22] from mobile to get here to get that tape
[3:00:24] to go to go all the way back and take it
[3:00:26] and one of them had to be working at
[3:00:27] dell champs
[3:00:29] and billy had to be working there at the
[3:00:30] right time and there had to be a
[3:00:32] conversation between them to make the
[3:00:34] atmosphere right enough that he would
[3:00:35] give him that
[3:00:37] that videotape
[3:00:41] [Music]
[3:00:43] one day i'm sitting in perry green's
[3:00:45] office and he says to me
[3:00:46] i really want you to meet eric erickson
[3:00:50] i said i don't know who that is
[3:00:53] he said oh that's the brother in iceland
[3:00:54] who owns a television station but he
[3:00:56] believes this message
[3:00:58] i said well i'd very much like to meet
[3:01:00] him
[3:01:02] years went by and years went by and
[3:01:04] years went by and i'm in israel now
[3:01:07] working for the lord
[3:01:09] and i'm speaking there for sister nancy
[3:01:13] and brother olaf comes to a service
[3:01:16] it must have been 2002 when i was there
[3:01:18] with my family
[3:01:20] yeah that's right
[3:01:22] we were there for
[3:01:24] four or five weeks and then come home
[3:01:25] for two weeks and went back
[3:01:28] and brother olaf comes to the service
[3:01:30] and after after it's over radwan has
[3:01:32] prepared a meal and we sit down and have
[3:01:34] a middle eastern meal together
[3:01:36] and this
[3:01:37] distinguished looking gentleman from
[3:01:39] iceland introduces himself
[3:01:42] and he said i was so touched by your
[3:01:43] message today
[3:01:45] and he said i i want my boss to meet you
[3:01:49] he said i work for eric erickson
[3:01:52] i said oh that name sounds from here
[3:01:55] he said yes he's he's iceland he said i
[3:01:58] i i thank you you and he had maybe
[3:02:00] believed some of the same things

[3:02:07] touch with you
[3:02:08] i would like for you to come to iceland
[3:02:11] all right
[3:02:13] months go by and months go by and months
[3:02:14] go by and one day at the church in
[3:02:16] columbus the phone rings and they say
[3:02:18] there's a brother eric erickson on the
[3:02:19] phone for you and i take the call and i
[3:02:22] do something very very strange i say
[3:02:23] hello he says brother steve shelley this
[3:02:25] is brother eric erickson and i said what
[3:02:27] took you so long
[3:02:30] he said sir
[3:02:32] excuse me
[3:02:33] i said i've been waiting on your call
[3:02:35] for years
[3:02:37] and it was an invitation to come to
[3:02:39] iceland
[3:02:40] and do you know why he was finally
[3:02:42] inviting me not just because he had met
[3:02:44] brother olaf had met me and went back
[3:02:46] and told him but hawk
[3:02:50] who had been
[3:02:51] serving sin
[3:02:53] had gotten a hold of god
[3:02:55] given his heart to the lord and he was
[3:02:57] filled with such expectation and he ran
[3:03:00] across the transvisions
[3:03:02] that god had given me in the 90s
[3:03:06] and he said i want we need to have this
[3:03:08] brother here
[3:03:10] and that opened the door of the
[3:03:11] invitation
[3:03:13] that brought me to iceland
[3:03:15] and it brought hawk here
[3:03:20] and i won't tell it every little detail
[3:03:22] because some funny little things come to
[3:03:23] my mind then
[3:03:25] but he put a redhead
[3:03:28] in the side of a redhead
[3:03:34] in my mind i'm trying to figure out how
[3:03:36] are we going to get these red heads
[3:03:37] together can i tell that
[3:03:40] good good just to know what you're gonna
[3:03:42] tell and i'm thinking how am i gonna get
[3:03:44] i gotta i wanna i want her to notice
[3:03:47] him
[3:03:49] and i want him to notice her at least
[3:03:52] see if it goes anywhere and
[3:03:54] marabeth was working for us she comes in
[3:03:57] with her laptop
[3:04:03] and she's going to show me something on
[3:04:05] the laptop or i'm going to look at
[3:04:06] something on the laptop and up pops a
[3:04:08] little picture here

[3:05:03] to trust
[3:05:17] even though you ran away
[3:05:20] god brought you back
[3:05:23] you didn't miss your appointment

[3:05:32] pull in some negative

[3:05:36] love story or anything that god is doing
[3:05:39] is always perfect and beautiful

[3:05:43] always heartaches along the way there's
[3:05:46] always mistakes made

[3:09:26] [Music]
[3:09:32] you unfold your great plan for
[3:09:36] [Music]
[3:09:43] will us
[3:09:51] [Music]
[3:09:54] [Laughter]
[3:09:56] [Music]
[3:10:02] our hearts will cry
[3:10:05] [Applause]
[3:10:13] thank you jesus
[3:10:15] we say thank you jesus
[3:10:17] [Music]
[3:10:23] our hearts will cry
[3:10:46] [Music]
[3:10:53] [Music]
[3:11:00] it's your breath
[3:11:03] in our lungs
[3:11:05] so we pour out our praise
[3:11:09] we pour out our praise into your bread
[3:11:12] yes
[3:11:14] in our lives
[3:11:18] [Music]
[3:11:29] [Music]
[3:11:38] [Music]
[3:11:42] would you begin to thank god for how
[3:11:44] he's brought you
[3:11:45] [Music]
[3:11:49] maybe you've taken a
[3:11:51] trip down memory lane
[3:11:52] yourself
[3:11:55] you recognize that your life has not
[3:11:57] been just a
[3:11:59] a conglomeration of random
[3:12:02] happenings but that god has led you
[3:12:05] gently along
[3:12:07] when he couldn't be gentle he was at
[3:12:09] least gracious
[3:12:11] [Music]
[3:12:12] with one connection after another
[3:12:14] connection he has brought you this far
[3:12:17] and so there would be no reason for us
[3:12:19] to go back and expect a chance
[3:12:23] just happenstance
[3:12:26] would be what we would depend on in this
[3:12:28] coming year
[3:12:30] we are not standing here at the mercy of
[3:12:32] the world we are here
[3:12:34] in the hands of a merciful god
[3:12:39] you have every right to stand for your
[3:12:41] promise you have every right to contend
[3:12:43] for your promise
[3:12:46] you have every right to believe god for
[3:12:48] restoration and reconciliation
[3:12:53] you have every right to believe god to
[3:12:55] bring your backslid children to him
[3:13:00] to heal relationships
[3:13:04] to restore what has been stolen from
[3:13:06] your life you have every right to trust
[3:13:09] that god is able
[3:13:12] to recover all
[3:13:17] [Music]
[3:13:19] but it boils down to trust
[3:13:25] can you trust him
[3:13:30] can you really believe
[3:13:32] that all of your days
[3:13:35] and all of your times are held in his
[3:13:38] hand
[3:13:40] and if you can then your response to
[3:13:43] life is blessed be the name of the lord
[3:13:48] he gives and he takes
[3:13:50] [Music]
[3:13:52] but his name is worthy to be praised
[3:13:55] he is holy he is faithful
[3:13:57] he is true
[3:13:59] let's worship just a little bit more
[3:14:02] if you need to make a commitment to god
[3:14:04] do it now
[3:14:07] if you need to confess your trust to him
[3:14:09] do it now
[3:14:11] if you feel to come and worship with us
[3:14:14] you're welcome if not right where you
[3:14:15] are worship him
[3:14:17] commit your 2022 into his hands
[3:14:21] just know that he's got a plan and he's
[3:14:23] working it out for his glory
[3:14:26] by your sovereign will will you choose
[3:14:29] again today to cooperate with his
[3:14:31] program
[3:14:32] and his plan for your life
[3:14:37] god had a plan for saul
[3:14:41] and saul was just going to ride all over
[3:14:43] what god had for him
[3:14:45] he was going to miss it
[3:14:50] but god had a way of getting saul's
[3:14:52] attention
[3:14:56] struck him blind
[3:14:58] [Music]
[3:14:59] sent him to the gentiles
[3:15:02] in many places
[3:15:06] although peter was the apostle of the
[3:15:08] gentiles he used this righteous pharisee
[3:15:14] to bring us
[3:15:16] the greatest portion of the new
[3:15:17] testament
[3:15:20] god turned him around
[3:15:24] because he had a plan
[3:15:25] let's tell the lord right now we trust
[3:15:27] him
[3:15:29] i don't know who this young man is but
[3:15:30] some of you young brothers go and pray
[3:15:32] with him
[3:15:34] he has come to talk to the lord and we
[3:15:37] don't want to disturb him in that but we
[3:15:39] want to support him in that
[3:15:43] oh god may he surrender everything that
[3:15:45] he is
[3:15:47] may he hold nothing back
[3:15:50] may he recognize today like never before
[3:15:52] that he's not living by luck or chance
[3:15:56] that it's you that's allowed him to be
[3:15:58] here today for some reason you wanted to
[3:16:01] speak to his life
[3:16:04] oh god may he find your divine will in
[3:16:08] every decision that lays before him we
[3:16:11] lift him up lord

[3:28:13] smiling and worshiping the lord it's
[3:28:16] we're glad to see you
[3:28:20] be seated just a moment
[3:28:26] david how about you taking a microphone
[3:28:28] back for me would you would you get a
[3:28:29] microphone brother billy has an
[3:28:31] announcement to make this morning
[3:28:34] can't imagine what it would be
[3:28:44] it's his announcement
[3:28:46] might as well make it
[3:28:50] it was uh ironic that you had
[3:28:53] told that story because during the
[3:28:55] ironic is kind of close to chance and
[3:28:57] happenstance and look so could you
[3:28:59] choose another word
[3:29:02] but uh
[3:29:03] i was thinking when he was speaking i
[3:29:05] was
[3:29:06] looking back on my life and seeing that
[3:29:09] 21 year old
[3:29:11] well it was actually i was 19 when i
[3:29:13] went to dell champs and
[3:29:17] when i got there that first day i was
[3:29:19] supposed to
[3:29:21] meet my boss
[3:29:23] and i was told now he's your boss is
[3:29:25] darrell boulevard and
[3:29:27] he's in europe
[3:29:30] and he'll be back in two weeks and
[3:29:32] um i'm a mississippi boy thinking wow
[3:29:35] europe that's amazing but found out
[3:29:38] years later that he was actually in
[3:29:39] europe with my future wife
[3:29:42] and my future pastor's future wife
[3:29:44] that's right
[3:29:46] anyway during that two-week time i got
[3:29:48] transferred to a different shift
[3:29:51] so i didn't meet darrell till i was 21.
[3:29:55] and a lot of things happened and i was
[3:29:57] 21 years old and i was on
[3:30:00] the bourbon street new orleans and a
[3:30:02] street missionary was there
[3:30:05] and it set me on a journey
[3:30:09] to seek truth and uh
[3:30:12] darrell was instrumental in that
[3:30:15] with first tapes of brother brand and
[3:30:16] then
[3:30:17] tapes of
[3:30:18] brother shell and about a year later
[3:30:21] i find myself in the back of a church in
[3:30:24] edmonton
[3:30:25] sitting next to brother shelley and
[3:30:27] asking about some people but i noticed
[3:30:29] this girl on a piano and
[3:30:32] i was standing here during that
[3:30:35] before that we
[3:30:38] prayed for emily and rj and i was
[3:30:39] thinking well here i am
[3:30:41] in the back of a church looking at my
[3:30:43] wife playing 30 years later
[3:30:47] god's brought me through some pretty
[3:30:50] pretty hard times he has
[3:30:53] and i'm so thankful yes
[3:30:56] but during that when i first came to the
[3:30:58] lord in 20 when i was 21
[3:31:01] i was thinking
[3:31:04] and the person he took me to is darrell
[3:31:06] and i'm like god that's two years i
[3:31:08] could have been serving you why didn't
[3:31:11] you let that happen then
[3:31:13] and that's when god let me know he spoke
[3:31:15] to my heart very gently
[3:31:17] and said because it
[3:31:19] you weren't ready it wasn't my time
[3:31:22] because i wasn't ready so
[3:31:24] since that time i do
[3:31:26] know god's got a perfect timing in
[3:31:28] everything yes he does
[3:31:30] so my announcement is
[3:31:33] about four years ago laurel was in
[3:31:36] canada and uh
[3:31:38] that's when zion met solomon
[3:31:41] and he's asked me for her hand i'm sure
[3:31:44] you told him no
[3:31:45] for a couple of times
[3:31:46] [Laughter]
[3:31:49] but
[3:31:50] i kept going back to there's a perfect
[3:31:53] time three times a charm
[3:31:54] well i woke up yesterday with a release
[3:31:57] from the lord and
[3:31:58] and i'm very happy to say i was able to
[3:32:00] give solomon my blessing to ask zion to
[3:32:03] marry him
[3:32:04] he didn't waste any time so
[3:32:07] yesterday afternoon he proposed and she
[3:32:09] accepted so
[3:32:10] i want to welcome him to the family
[3:32:13] sometime in the future
[3:32:15] so
[3:32:16] [Music]
[3:32:20] [Applause]
[3:32:29] well done brother let's stand
[3:32:32] you have an opportunity to congratulate
[3:32:35] them as they begin their life together
[3:32:40] we know that god indeed does have a plan
[3:32:43] it's very very difficult for this
[3:32:45] congregation to accept the fact that
[3:32:47] they will be making their life in canada
[3:32:49] it appears
[3:32:50] but we know that god
[3:32:53] sees all
[3:32:54] knows all
[3:32:56] understands all
[3:32:57] and he gets the last say
[3:33:00] i'm glad he does
[3:33:02] because i've spoke what i thought before
[3:33:04] and found out that he gets the last say
[3:33:07] he's always right
[3:33:08] so let's just
[3:33:10] love on them and let them know that
[3:33:11] we're happy that they are preparing to
[3:33:13] begin their life together
[3:33:16] i remember his dad before he was a
[3:33:19] married man
[3:33:21] and how many siblings you have two
[3:33:22] sibling solomon
[3:33:24] so now we
[3:33:26] see their family going on for god and
[3:33:29] his grandfather we've known for since
[3:33:31] night since the 90s 91 probably
[3:33:34] and he pastors a church in in edmonton
[3:33:38] it's a wonderful family and we're
[3:33:40] thankful that god
[3:33:42] has brought them together
[3:33:44] lord jesus
[3:33:46] we love you today above all things

[3:34:13] i pray lord that each one of us will
[3:34:15] take a thought home with us
[3:34:17] from your word
[3:34:18] and if times get tough or things seem to
[3:34:21] be going amiss
[3:34:22] i pray that we everyone will remember
[3:34:24] that god has a plan
[3:34:26] you have a perfect plan
[3:34:29] and we want to be yielded and

[3:34:52] problem
[3:34:53] and loose perfect healing in everybody

[3:34:59] to find their place in you
[3:35:01] and we pray that you will open up the
[3:35:03] way
