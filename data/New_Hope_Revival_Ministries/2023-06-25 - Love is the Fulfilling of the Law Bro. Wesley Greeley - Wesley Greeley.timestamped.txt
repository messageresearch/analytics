[50:19] we just believe the Lord has purpose in
[50:22] all of these things
[50:25] before we look to the word I would like
[50:27] to give you a piece of good news
[50:33] a payment of seventy five hundred
[50:35] dollars was made to the mortgage of this

[51:07] God give us Grace to get rid of it
[51:10] have a mortgage burning
[51:12] amen Romans chapter 13 starting in verse
[51:16] 8. we're certainly glad to have you in
[51:18] the house of the Lord all of you that
[51:20] are watching this service by way of the
[51:22] stream we welcome you uh perhaps some of
[51:25] you out there are not aware that we do
[51:28] not stream our services on Tuesday night
[51:31] via Facebook and YouTube is that correct
[51:34] we only stream on Tuesday night with the
[51:37] app and with the website
[51:39] all right so
[51:42] um there's a possibility of some changes
[51:45] on things and so we just want you to be
[51:48] able to get to us so if you don't have
[51:50] the New Hope app it is available for you

[51:56] Romans Chapter 13 Verse 8 no oh no man
[52:00] anything but to love one another
[52:03] for he that loveth another hath
[52:07] fulfilled the law
[52:09] for this thou shall not commit adultery
[52:13] thou shall not kill
[52:15] Thou shalt not steal thou shall not bear
[52:18] false witness
[52:19] thou shall not covet and if there be any
[52:22] other commandment it is briefly
[52:24] comprehended in this saying namely Thou
[52:28] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[52:31] love worketh no ill in to his neighbor
[52:35] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[52:39] law
[52:40] and that knowing the time that now it is
[52:44] high time to awake out of sleep for now
[52:48] is our Salvation nearer than when we
[52:51] believed
[52:53] the night is far spent the day is at
[52:56] hand let us therefore cut off the works
[52:59] of darkness and let us put on the armor
[53:02] of light let us walk honestly as in the
[53:05] day not in rioting and drunkenness not
[53:09] in chambering and wantedness not in
[53:12] strife and envying but put ye on the
[53:17] Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision
[53:20] for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
[53:24] thereof
[53:26] let us pray before you're seated please
[53:29] Our Father how great you are and how
[53:32] thankful we are that you would invite us
[53:35] into your presence we want to thank you
[53:38] that you abide in us and we're thankful
[53:41] Lord to be gathered together corporately
[53:44] with your people now as we look to the
[53:47] word we're asking that you would hide
[53:50] the vessel and that you would speak to
[53:53] us today Words of Life words of help to
[53:57] us that will help us in this journey
[53:59] called life we pray God that you would
[54:03] give us the grace to put aside every
[54:05] distraction and every disturbance and
[54:08] that we would be able to focus our eyes
[54:10] on the word of God and pay attention to
[54:13] what you want to say to us Lord I
[54:16] realize in the preaching of the word
[54:18] different people receive different
[54:20] things and so God I ask you as we open
[54:24] up our lives to you today that you will
[54:27] take the word as you will and deliver it
[54:30] to the hearts of the people
[54:32] get honor and glory Lord again we pray
[54:35] for our pastor use him abundantly Lord
[54:37] for the purposes of the Kingdom while he
[54:40] is in Tucson and bring him back to him
[54:43] and sister Stacy back to us safely all
[54:46] of these other needs we again commit
[54:48] them to you we know God that you are
[54:51] well able to take care of all of them we
[54:53] give you ourselves now use us according
[54:56] to your purposes in the name of the Lord
[54:58] Jesus Christ we pray
[55:01] amen may the Lord bless you as you are
[55:05] seated today
[55:16] as I
[55:20] think about the
[55:23] Bible and
[55:26] we
[55:27] tend to read the King James version
[55:29] around here most of the time and lately
[55:32] I've been noticing that there are words
[55:34] in the King James that
[55:37] we don't use in everyday life
[55:40] uh
[55:42] verse 13 is namely a couple of them
[55:46] chambering and wantonness
[55:48] and right off of the top of my head that
[55:52] I don't have the Strong's definitions to
[55:55] give you but uh it it boils down to what
[55:58] verse 14 says put on the Lord Jesus
[56:01] Christ and make not provision for the
[56:05] flesh
[56:06] uh rioting and drunkenness and
[56:09] chambering and wantonness and strife and
[56:11] envying all of these are things that we
[56:15] give we allow to happen in our life
[56:18] because of the lusts of the flesh they
[56:22] are things that we allow into our life
[56:26] but that is uh really not the uh subject
[56:30] that I have today
[56:32] I would like to look at verse 10 uh love
[56:37] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[56:39] love is the fulfilling of the law in the
[56:44] previous verses uh it's it's written for
[56:48] us that thou shalt not commit adultery
[56:52] well that brings back to memory that
[56:54] this is one of the The Ten Commandments
[56:57] that we uh lump into what we call the
[57:00] Ten Commandments that you can go back to
[57:03] I believe Exodus 21 and you can find
[57:07] where that they're all laid out but here
[57:09] uh the writer says thou shall not commit
[57:13] adultery Thou shalt not kill thou shall
[57:17] not steal Thou shalt not bear false
[57:20] witness Thou shalt not covet now if you
[57:23] notice every one of these Commandments
[57:26] are the way that we interact with one
[57:30] another with our fellow human beings
[57:34] when we uh would commit adultery we know
[57:38] that adultery is when folks are married
[57:42] and they go outside of the confines of
[57:44] marriage and they find them someone else
[57:46] with whom to have a relationship with uh
[57:50] this is breaking up a marriage this is
[57:53] this is uh uh the the breaking down of
[57:56] love between a husband and a wife this
[58:00] is uh between human beings when we look
[58:04] at the one Thou shalt not kill uh really
[58:08] this should read thou shall not murder
[58:15] again if this is between
[58:19] this is on the horizontal level
[58:22] between human beings where that mankind
[58:26] his heart gets filled up with evil and
[58:30] he gets to a Breaking Point and some
[58:34] people Punch walls and some people pick
[58:37] up guns
[58:38] some people pick up rocks
[58:42] as
[58:44] Cain did to his brother Abel
[58:47] others pick up knives swords some kind
[58:50] of an instrument baseball bats hammers
[58:52] all of these are instruments when people
[58:56] get outside of their head when they get
[59:00] so full of Rage when they get so full of
[59:03] evil when they get so angry because that
[59:07] things have come into their life and
[59:10] then there they don't know what else to
[59:13] do and the rage boils over and they then
[59:17] want to take it out on someone else
[59:20] because when we live in the flesh we are
[59:24] always looking for someone else to blame
[59:27] for our troubles
[59:31] when we live in the flesh we don't like
[59:35] taking responsibility for the place that
[59:38] we're at the attitudes that we have the
[59:41] rage that we have inside the anger the
[59:45] malice the Envy the covetousness the
[59:48] lust we don't want to blame ourselves
[59:51] for the predicaments that we have put
[59:54] our own selves in we want to find
[59:57] someone else to blame
[1:00:00] but as we come closer to the coming of
[1:00:04] the Lord and as the holy spirit is
[1:00:07] requiring more out of us we will not be
[1:00:11] permitted to blame other people
[1:00:14] for our condition
[1:00:16] won't be able to blame the preacher we
[1:00:19] won't be able to blame the song leader
[1:00:21] won't be able to blame our husband our
[1:00:23] wife our girlfriend our boyfriend we
[1:00:25] won't be able to do any of that because
[1:00:27] it is all going to be our responsibility
[1:00:33] can't regulate what comes to you
[1:00:36] but you can control what comes back out
[1:00:39] of you
[1:00:44] so all of these things that is being
[1:00:47] listed here on the on the horizontal it
[1:00:50] is our interaction with one another with
[1:00:53] a humankind in in the Bible is telling
[1:00:57] us that uh law loving one another is
[1:01:01] fulfilling the law
[1:01:03] because when we have love in our lives
[1:01:06] and when we are truly loving one another
[1:01:10] we're not going to have a desire to
[1:01:12] break up marriages
[1:01:15] when we are loving one another we are
[1:01:18] not going to have a desire to murder
[1:01:21] including murdering someone's influence
[1:01:26] we're not going to have a desire to
[1:01:29] steal
[1:01:31] including stealing from God
[1:01:35] we're going to want to give everything
[1:01:37] that belongs to him and a whole lot more
[1:01:39] when we were truly in love with the Lord
[1:01:43] Jesus Christ and loving one another as
[1:01:46] we should we are going to find ourselves
[1:01:49] being givers more than takers
[1:01:54] when we talk about finances tithings and
[1:01:57] offerings and these kinds of things God
[1:02:00] has spoken to us in the older Covenant
[1:02:02] about one-tenth and and we give our
[1:02:05] tithe unto the Lord and we think how are
[1:02:08] we going to make it on that 90 percent
[1:02:10] but as we fall in love more and more and
[1:02:13] more with the Lord Jesus Christ and we
[1:02:16] find ways to be givers givers givers
[1:02:19] givers God is also a giver and he's
[1:02:22] going to find ways to give and give and
[1:02:24] give and give and you're going to find
[1:02:26] out that it's easy to live on 90 percent
[1:02:28] and you're going to want to give more
[1:02:30] and more and more and more until that
[1:02:33] you are so totally blessed by by
[1:02:37] receiving and giving because it's who
[1:02:40] God is and it's who you will become
[1:02:43] just giving unto the Lord everything but
[1:02:46] because that we live in this life our
[1:02:50] problem right now happens to be
[1:02:53] selfishness
[1:02:58] we are trying to preserve self
[1:03:05] and this is because that we are trying
[1:03:10] to maintain a a relationship with the
[1:03:15] Lord while still trying to have all of
[1:03:18] these things around us and living in the
[1:03:20] realm of the flesh more than we're
[1:03:22] living in the realm of the spirit and so
[1:03:25] we find ourselves still hanging on to
[1:03:28] our selfish attitude
[1:03:30] and not really allowing the Lord to love
[1:03:33] through us and that is they even see
[1:03:37] these things that are listed here these
[1:03:39] Commandments it boils down to
[1:03:42] selfishness
[1:03:48] adultery
[1:03:51] selfishness
[1:03:53] pleasing self
[1:03:56] murder
[1:03:58] pleasing self because something didn't
[1:04:00] go your way whether it be to physically
[1:04:04] murder someone or to murder someone's
[1:04:06] influence why would you murder someone's
[1:04:09] influence why would you try to kill
[1:04:11] somebody's influence
[1:04:14] now there there are times where that we
[1:04:17] have to separate our children from
[1:04:19] another's influence because we as
[1:04:22] parents with the Holy Ghost maybe our
[1:04:25] children don't have the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:27] it is God uses parents as the tutor for
[1:04:31] the children until that they receive the
[1:04:34] Holy Ghost tutor into their lives and we
[1:04:37] have to guide them we have to protect
[1:04:39] them we have to be one who says yes I am
[1:04:43] going to protect you from an outside
[1:04:45] influence and I want to cut that
[1:04:48] influence off because I see the end of
[1:04:51] that influence
[1:04:53] it is not a Godly influence but if there
[1:04:56] is a Godly influence in someone's life
[1:04:59] why would we try to cut that off why
[1:05:02] would we try to kill that are we afraid
[1:05:04] that someone else is going to have more
[1:05:07] influence in helping somebody to get a
[1:05:11] little farther in their walk with the
[1:05:13] Lord than we have and so we're jealous
[1:05:16] of that and we're envious of that and so
[1:05:19] we end up cutting off that influence
[1:05:22] killing that influence we need to think
[1:05:25] about these things
[1:05:27] but their selfishness because we're
[1:05:30] trying to preserve self because we're
[1:05:32] trying to build up self the the stealing
[1:05:35] part again this is this is
[1:05:38] self-preservation
[1:05:46] when we steal something that doesn't
[1:05:49] belong to us
[1:05:52] we're trying to preserve ourself
[1:05:54] whether it be
[1:05:58] stealing a pack of bubble gum
[1:06:02] whether it be stealing
[1:06:07] from our boss
[1:06:10] stealing from the Lord
[1:06:12] thou shall not bear false witness
[1:06:15] you ever think about
[1:06:19] tattlers
[1:06:20] gossipers
[1:06:22] people who are trying to preserve their
[1:06:26] own self-image
[1:06:28] and so they are good at telling a story
[1:06:31] in such a way that it makes them look
[1:06:34] good and makes somebody else look bad
[1:06:39] self-preservation
[1:06:40] so all of these things are
[1:06:43] combined
[1:06:46] as we interact with one another these
[1:06:49] are
[1:06:51] self-preservation
[1:06:52] mechanisms that we have
[1:06:55] try to protect ourselves to get through
[1:06:58] this world but what the Holy Ghost wants
[1:07:02] us to be so full of himself till that
[1:07:05] we're not trying to preserve anything
[1:07:07] but him
[1:07:11] till the word becomes so full in us
[1:07:14] until that we do not try to preserve our
[1:07:17] image we do not try to preserve anything
[1:07:20] about us except for that we live as
[1:07:23] close to the Lord Jesus Christ as we
[1:07:26] possibly can because when we are loving
[1:07:30] our neighbor as ourself
[1:07:34] when we are loving our fellow believer
[1:07:37] as ourselves when we're loving those out
[1:07:40] there that have all kinds of problems
[1:07:43] and they have all kinds of phobias and
[1:07:45] they have trying to take on all kinds of
[1:07:48] things to help them to get through
[1:07:52] another day of life
[1:07:54] and it makes them look so weird
[1:07:58] makes them act strange
[1:08:01] makes them do crazy things
[1:08:05] yet we as a as a Christian believer as a
[1:08:09] holy ghost believer we would have the
[1:08:12] ability to love someone else
[1:08:16] as we do ourselves
[1:08:20] there is a way
[1:08:22] and God grant us all of the
[1:08:26] ability to do it
[1:08:29] there is a way
[1:08:32] to truly love someone
[1:08:35] with an alternative lifestyle
[1:08:38] without
[1:08:41] putting our blessing on their
[1:08:43] alternative lifestyle
[1:08:47] because the Bible tells us it's an
[1:08:49] abomination
[1:08:51] and we do not want to be found blessing
[1:08:54] something that God has already cursed
[1:08:58] but that does not keep us from being
[1:09:01] kind
[1:09:04] so all of these things that we're seeing
[1:09:07] here the Bible tells us that they're all
[1:09:11] gathered together in one love your
[1:09:13] neighbor as yourself would you turn with
[1:09:16] me to Galatians chapter 5.
[1:09:20] Galatians chapter 5 and verse 6.
[1:09:27] for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[1:09:30] availeth anything nor uncircumcision
[1:09:34] but Faith which worketh by love
[1:09:39] you did run well
[1:09:42] who did hinder you that you should not
[1:09:44] obey the truth
[1:09:46] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[1:09:48] calleth you
[1:09:50] a little 11 11th at the whole lump
[1:09:53] I have confidence in you through the
[1:09:55] Lord that you will be none
[1:09:57] otherwise-minded
[1:09:59] but he that troubleth you shall bear his
[1:10:03] judgment whosoever he be
[1:10:06] and I Brethren if I yet preach
[1:10:09] circumcision why do I yet suffer
[1:10:13] persecution
[1:10:14] then is the offense of the Cross ceased
[1:10:18] I would they were even cut off which
[1:10:21] trouble you
[1:10:23] for Brethren you've been called unto
[1:10:26] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:10:29] occasion to the flesh
[1:10:31] but by love serve one another
[1:10:35] don't use your Liberty
[1:10:38] as an occasion to revert back to fleshly
[1:10:41] actions
[1:10:45] but by love serve one another for all
[1:10:48] the law is fulfilled in this one word
[1:10:51] even in this Thou shalt love thy
[1:10:55] neighbor as thyself
[1:10:58] now
[1:11:00] I am not going to have you turn there
[1:11:02] but I am going to read off a list
[1:11:06] that you would find in First Corinthians
[1:11:08] chapter 13 some of these came from the
[1:11:11] KJV some of them came from the new
[1:11:14] American Standards some of them came
[1:11:16] from the Amplified I was trying to get
[1:11:21] words that were more words that we use
[1:11:25] in our common language today so I'm
[1:11:27] going to read this list off of what love
[1:11:30] or love is not love is patient
[1:11:34] love is kind
[1:11:37] love is not jealous
[1:11:43] love does not brag
[1:11:48] love is not arrogant or rude
[1:11:54] love does not act unbecomingly
[1:11:59] love does not seek its own way
[1:12:03] love is not provoked
[1:12:08] love does not take into account
[1:12:12] a wrong suffered
[1:12:20] love does not rejoice in unrighteousness
[1:12:29] you know all those off-colored jokes
[1:12:32] might be told
[1:12:37] love rejoices in or with the truth
[1:12:44] love bears up under anything and
[1:12:48] everything that comes
[1:12:51] love is ever ready to believe the best
[1:12:54] of every person
[1:12:59] love hopes
[1:13:01] are faithless
[1:13:03] or Love's hope is faithless under every
[1:13:05] circumstance
[1:13:07] love endures without weakening
[1:13:12] and love never fails it never Fades out
[1:13:15] or becomes obsolete
[1:13:18] or comes to an end
[1:13:21] so this list here some of them uh are
[1:13:26] what love is and some of them are what
[1:13:29] love is not
[1:13:31] this is all found in First Corinthians
[1:13:33] chapter 13 come to be known as the love
[1:13:36] chapter where the the word that's used
[1:13:40] in the King James is charity and we use
[1:13:45] the word love love is patient and kind
[1:13:47] and all of these things this list are
[1:13:51] things that demonstrate what love is so
[1:13:55] that we know how to interact with one
[1:13:58] another with mankind as we are traveling
[1:14:01] through this life because because all of
[1:14:05] the law is fulfilled when you are loving
[1:14:09] your neighbor as yourself
[1:14:13] now as a human
[1:14:17] I
[1:14:19] like to
[1:14:21] pamper myself
[1:14:24] as you do
[1:14:27] all of us have our preferences
[1:14:32] of what we would call pampering
[1:14:39] some like it quite chilly in their homes
[1:14:42] and in the church some like it quite
[1:14:45] warm
[1:14:47] and because that we are human and we
[1:14:51] love our comforts
[1:14:53] our pampering
[1:14:55] we have tendency to say sometimes what
[1:15:00] we would prefer
[1:15:04] and sometimes
[1:15:07] when we voice our preference it goes
[1:15:11] beyond the voicing of our preference
[1:15:16] and becomes
[1:15:18] derogatory or maybe even to the point of
[1:15:22] a demand
[1:15:24] because we want to be comfortable
[1:15:29] because we tend to be selfish
[1:15:36] yet the fulfilling of the law is summed
[1:15:40] up in one phrase Thou shalt love thy
[1:15:44] neighbor as thyself
[1:15:47] I like it cold brother but what do you
[1:15:51] prefer
[1:15:52] I Like It Hot sister what do you prefer
[1:15:57] now
[1:16:02] I could get in a whole lot of trouble
[1:16:06] messing with the thermostats in this
[1:16:08] building
[1:16:11] but I would like to remind you as the
[1:16:14] congregation
[1:16:17] that we should prefer
[1:16:20] whoever
[1:16:21] is doing the work
[1:16:28] now
[1:16:30] I can throw a statement out and say you
[1:16:32] can fuss with your wife and your
[1:16:34] children at home about the thermostat
[1:16:36] of how you would like it hot or cold yet
[1:16:42] when we find ourselves
[1:16:45] preferring one another
[1:16:48] or our opinions of things will become
[1:16:51] less and less and less
[1:16:55] we're preferring one another we're
[1:16:58] trying by the grace of God to fulfill
[1:17:01] the law
[1:17:03] of God by recognizing that all of the
[1:17:07] law is fulfilled love your neighbor as
[1:17:10] yourself now this great big list of of
[1:17:14] uh things that we get from First
[1:17:16] Corinthians chapter 13 all of it boils
[1:17:20] down into first John chapter 4.
[1:17:24] first John Chapter 4 verses 7 through
[1:17:27] 10.
[1:17:28] sorry Mariah didn't give that one to you
[1:17:32] beloved let us love one another for love
[1:17:35] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[1:17:38] born of God and knoweth God
[1:17:43] he that loveth not knoweth not God for
[1:17:48] God is
[1:17:50] love
[1:17:53] in this was manifested the love of God
[1:17:56] toward us
[1:17:58] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:18:01] son into the world that we might live
[1:18:03] through him
[1:18:05] here in his love not that we loved God
[1:18:08] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[1:18:12] be the propitiation for our sins
[1:18:19] I wrote for yeah
[1:18:22] chapter 4 first John 4
[1:18:24] verses 7 through 10. now what I want you
[1:18:27] to get out of this is that we God is
[1:18:31] love
[1:18:33] and what we are striving toward
[1:18:38] is
[1:18:40] so much of Jesus Christ inside of us
[1:18:44] that we have the same nature as he does
[1:18:49] he does
[1:18:50] and his nature is and was
[1:18:54] that before you ever got here
[1:18:58] before your parents ever got here
[1:19:02] and generations before them
[1:19:05] even though that he knew that you and I
[1:19:08] were going to trespass against him
[1:19:10] because he is love he already had a
[1:19:15] Redemption plan in mind so that you
[1:19:19] could experience the kindness and the
[1:19:24] generosity and the patience and the
[1:19:26] non-jecy and all of these things that
[1:19:29] we've put in a picture here concerning
[1:19:32] what love is before you ever got here
[1:19:34] before you ever made your first mess
[1:19:40] before you ever had your first trespass
[1:19:43] before you ever did anything against
[1:19:46] someone else
[1:19:49] God already had a propitiation a a
[1:19:54] Redemption plan in his mind to be able
[1:19:58] to cover you
[1:20:00] he already had a plan in his mind to
[1:20:04] forgive you
[1:20:05] before that you ever were able to tell
[1:20:10] your first lie he already had it in his
[1:20:14] mind that he was going to forgive you
[1:20:20] before you ever did anything that would
[1:20:23] go against his word he already had a
[1:20:27] thought in his mind of a way that he was
[1:20:29] going to blot it out and not hold it
[1:20:32] against you
[1:20:34] and that was through the the the gift of
[1:20:39] the sacrifice of Calvary when the Lord
[1:20:42] Jesus Christ God come in the flesh it
[1:20:46] was by that that he already forgave you
[1:20:53] he made a way
[1:20:59] do you know that you can't even pray
[1:21:01] effectively if you don't forgive
[1:21:13] Matthew chapter 6.
[1:21:19] after this manner pray ye therefore
[1:21:23] Our Father
[1:21:25] which art in heaven
[1:21:27] Hallowed be thy name
[1:21:30] thy kingdom come
[1:21:33] thy will be done
[1:21:35] in Earth
[1:21:37] as it is in heaven
[1:21:39] this is what we're trying daily to do by
[1:21:42] the grace of God to get in the spirit
[1:21:45] and Ascend into Heavenly places and
[1:21:48] bring the plans of Heaven into the Earth
[1:21:50] as it is in heaven let it be on the
[1:21:53] Earth
[1:21:54] give us this day our daily bread and
[1:21:58] forgive us our debts
[1:22:02] as we
[1:22:04] forgive
[1:22:06] our debtors
[1:22:08] now I'd like to ask a question of us
[1:22:13] if we only forgave
[1:22:17] our debtors
[1:22:20] or let me let me rephrase that if God
[1:22:23] only forgave us as much as we forgive
[1:22:27] our debtors
[1:22:31] if God only forgave us as much as we
[1:22:35] forgive our debtors
[1:22:38] what would still be hanging on us
[1:22:44] measure for measure
[1:22:47] someone trespasses against us
[1:22:53] and we hold something in our heart
[1:22:55] against them
[1:22:58] and we don't forgive them
[1:23:02] we're hindering our prayers number one
[1:23:06] but I'm asking the question if we give
[1:23:09] this equation where that God only
[1:23:12] forgives us measure by measure as we
[1:23:15] forgive others how much is still hanging
[1:23:18] on us
[1:23:19] well that's not the way he works we
[1:23:21] already know that because he has already
[1:23:24] forgiven us before we made the first
[1:23:26] mess he already forgave us
[1:23:30] because
[1:23:31] by his foreknowledge
[1:23:35] because he's all-knowing he could
[1:23:38] predestinate us give us a prefixed
[1:23:41] Destiny to eternal life and because he
[1:23:45] knew all of the things that we would
[1:23:47] ever do but he knew that one day we
[1:23:49] would call on his name and we would
[1:23:52] repent and we would come clean before
[1:23:54] him he would forgive us all of those
[1:23:56] debts
[1:23:59] before we ever got here
[1:24:02] now he wants us to ask of course he
[1:24:05] wants us to uh recognize that we have
[1:24:08] trespassed
[1:24:11] he wants us to recognize that we we've
[1:24:14] just been a jerk
[1:24:16] he wants us to recognize that we've been
[1:24:19] unkind that we've been jealous he wants
[1:24:23] us to recognize these things and come to
[1:24:25] him in Repentance and say father forgive
[1:24:29] me I have I have done evil against you
[1:24:32] and against your word and against my
[1:24:34] fellow man and I ask you to forgive me
[1:24:38] and sometimes it requires going to a
[1:24:41] fellow man and saying I'm sorry
[1:24:44] I'm sorry
[1:24:50] but if God hung on to everything we hang
[1:24:52] on to
[1:24:57] how much would still be dangled before
[1:24:59] us
[1:25:02] man you talk about the devil being able
[1:25:05] to use something to beat you over the
[1:25:07] head with
[1:25:11] but the devil has nothing to hang over
[1:25:14] your head when you come clean before the
[1:25:17] Lord
[1:25:17] and you forgive even as he forgave
[1:25:23] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:25:28] to them that walk after the spirit
[1:25:32] we can be so clean and we can forgive so
[1:25:35] genuinely until that the power of the
[1:25:39] Living God operates through us and the
[1:25:42] love of Jesus Christ goes to other and
[1:25:44] we're giving kindness and appreciation
[1:25:46] and we're not allowing jealousy to take
[1:25:49] a hold of us and we're not allowing all
[1:25:52] of these things to so get
[1:25:55] in US
[1:25:59] now
[1:26:01] we can go back to Galatians where that
[1:26:05] it says that Faith Works by love
[1:26:08] and the Amplified I broke it down a
[1:26:12] little bit farther than the Amplified
[1:26:13] but the Amplified says faith is
[1:26:17] activated by love
[1:26:22] faith is energized by love
[1:26:27] faith is expressed by love
[1:26:31] and faith is working by love and when
[1:26:34] you look at it this way that that our
[1:26:37] faith that we have we
[1:26:41] ask the Lord to increase our faith and
[1:26:45] we can go to the Book of Luke and we can
[1:26:47] talk about how that faith is based on
[1:26:50] forgiveness and we forgive one another
[1:26:54] for what they trespass against us and so
[1:26:57] uh again this is this horizontal between
[1:27:01] mankind where that we are forgiving one
[1:27:05] another and we're honoring one another
[1:27:07] and we're expressing uh our love our
[1:27:10] kindness to one another and so then our
[1:27:13] faith
[1:27:16] is activated
[1:27:19] by love
[1:27:24] just take a moment I don't want you to
[1:27:27] dwell a long time on it but just take a
[1:27:29] moment to think about a season in your
[1:27:31] life
[1:27:33] when you are angry with someone
[1:27:37] and
[1:27:39] you held something in your heart maybe
[1:27:41] you never have
[1:27:43] I have
[1:27:46] but you held something in your heart
[1:27:47] against someone
[1:27:49] how active was your faith
[1:27:55] there was something that was hindering
[1:27:57] and it was unforgiveness
[1:27:59] so these things are uh
[1:28:03] they're they're hindering to us
[1:28:09] now what I want to get back to is where
[1:28:11] I was on Tuesday night concerning the
[1:28:14] capping of the
[1:28:16] of the pyramid
[1:28:18] because when we look at the scripture
[1:28:23] I believe it's in second
[1:28:25] Peter
[1:28:28] where this
[1:28:30] scripture is taken from
[1:28:34] second Peter chapter one again I did not
[1:28:37] give them this passage of scripture a
[1:28:40] verse for whereby are given unto us
[1:28:42] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:28:46] that by these ye may be partakers of the
[1:28:51] divine nature
[1:28:52] let's turn that word partakers around
[1:28:56] and
[1:28:58] say you might take part
[1:29:01] of the divine nature
[1:29:05] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:29:08] the world through lust and beside this
[1:29:11] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:29:15] virtue
[1:29:16] now
[1:29:18] our experience with the Lord starts of
[1:29:22] course with faith
[1:29:24] we have been given a Measure of Faith
[1:29:29] sometimes The Measure of Faith doesn't
[1:29:32] seem very small but again Faith Works by
[1:29:35] love and because that the Holy Spirit
[1:29:39] shed his love on you to even open your
[1:29:43] eyes to recognize that you were a sinner
[1:29:46] your faith could be activated to say yes
[1:29:49] I am a sinner and I want to become clean
[1:29:52] because I see that the blood of Jesus
[1:29:56] Christ that was shed at Calvary was for
[1:29:58] my sin it was to clean it
[1:30:02] to purify it to annihilate it to put it
[1:30:05] away and never to be remembered against
[1:30:08] me anymore because his love came to me
[1:30:11] my faith could be activated but our love
[1:30:14] for one another can cause Faith to be
[1:30:17] activated in us to be able to go to a
[1:30:21] higher level so then it says add to your
[1:30:24] faith after you've called on the Lord
[1:30:26] then you want to add to your faith
[1:30:28] virtue
[1:30:36] now if you
[1:30:38] you go back to the message the stature
[1:30:41] of a perfect man brother Branham took
[1:30:44] this word Virtue back to when Jesus was
[1:30:47] touched by the woman with the issue of
[1:30:50] blood where that virtue went out of her
[1:30:52] now I would like to further say that the
[1:30:57] word when virtue went out of Jesus the
[1:31:00] word in the Greek was dunamis
[1:31:02] power and strength that is not the word
[1:31:05] used here in second Peter the word used
[1:31:08] here as virtue is moral goodness or high
[1:31:13] moral standard virtue
[1:31:15] either way I'm not trying to take away
[1:31:19] from someone else's preaching I just am
[1:31:21] how I'm trying to get us to have
[1:31:23] understanding that this we're building
[1:31:26] this all of the law is fulfilled the way
[1:31:30] you treat your neighbor
[1:31:33] love your neighbor as yourself
[1:31:36] so now we have moral goodness or high
[1:31:38] moral standard then we have knowledge
[1:31:41] which is gnosis or the understanding of
[1:31:45] the lawful or the unlawful
[1:31:48] we come to Temperance which is
[1:31:51] self-control
[1:31:54] we're still working on this one
[1:31:58] honestly we're still working on all of
[1:32:00] them
[1:32:03] because my faith is not where I want my
[1:32:05] faith to be
[1:32:09] my moral standard I'm still working on
[1:32:12] it
[1:32:14] because of the
[1:32:16] pressing in every day
[1:32:20] of the moral standard of the world
[1:32:23] I have to constantly be on guard of my
[1:32:26] own moral standard
[1:32:28] because what the enemy wants to do is
[1:32:30] tear down your morals
[1:32:33] and as time goes by what the enemy does
[1:32:37] is he distorts things and he makes you
[1:32:41] think that well this is 2023 this is not
[1:32:45] 1970.
[1:32:47] that's not so bad
[1:32:50] and so we have to constantly be on guard
[1:32:54] with our moral standard and taking it
[1:32:57] back to the word of God
[1:33:02] to make sure that we are fully
[1:33:06] cooperating with the word of God with
[1:33:09] whatever we do
[1:33:11] with our understanding of what is lawful
[1:33:14] and what is not lawful and they're
[1:33:17] trying to press laws in on us to make us
[1:33:21] again distort or disa to change our
[1:33:26] views on what is lawful according to the
[1:33:29] word of God
[1:33:31] now man has the ability
[1:33:36] because he is under the influence of
[1:33:38] demonic spirits
[1:33:40] to give laws of the land that directly
[1:33:44] defy the law of God
[1:33:47] and as we come closer to the end it may
[1:33:52] be that we have to be like the Chinese
[1:33:55] believers
[1:34:00] we're glad there's going to be a
[1:34:02] necessity along the way that we have to
[1:34:06] defy the loss of the land because the
[1:34:10] law of God is the higher law
[1:34:16] self-control we're working on this
[1:34:18] because there are always things to come
[1:34:21] against you
[1:34:25] one thing or another
[1:34:28] there may be something that you
[1:34:31] have self-control over that I don't
[1:34:36] I may have self-control over something
[1:34:39] that you don't so we're working as
[1:34:42] individuals getting self-control of the
[1:34:47] things that the enemy torments us with
[1:34:49] bringing him to the Cross every day
[1:34:52] saying Lord I desire a laid down life
[1:35:01] love your neighbor as yourself that's a
[1:35:03] laid down life
[1:35:04] that's what Jesus came to the Earth for
[1:35:07] Jesus came to the Earth to demonstrate a
[1:35:10] laid down life
[1:35:12] he came to the Earth to demonstrate that
[1:35:15] he could walk through this Earth and
[1:35:18] love the neighbor as himself without
[1:35:21] defiling himself
[1:35:25] and he could show that all of the fences
[1:35:28] that the Pharisees had built they built
[1:35:31] it outside of the confines of what God
[1:35:34] had spoken and they tried to press some
[1:35:36] issues and some traditions and he told
[1:35:39] them that by your tradition you're
[1:35:41] causing the people to die
[1:35:44] have spiritual death
[1:35:47] because they were pushing it
[1:35:50] outside of the confines of God's word so
[1:35:53] then here in second Peter chapter one we
[1:35:56] have after Temperance or self-control we
[1:35:58] have patience which is a steadfastness a
[1:36:02] constancy an endurance
[1:36:07] and what works patience
[1:36:13] trials tribulations
[1:36:18] we all have them
[1:36:21] because God is working something in US
[1:36:26] tribulations trials fiery trials don't
[1:36:29] think they're strange because they're
[1:36:31] all part of this journey
[1:36:33] then we have godliness reverence respect
[1:36:36] piety towards God
[1:36:39] brotherly kindness again love of our
[1:36:41] brothers our sisters and then this
[1:36:44] finishes out with Charity or a love the
[1:36:46] this word means love feast
[1:36:49] affection
[1:36:51] good will
[1:36:53] brotherly love
[1:36:55] now what is the statement that brother
[1:36:57] Branham used
[1:36:59] some many years ago when he talked about
[1:37:03] they were all branhams
[1:37:05] they might scrap in the backyard
[1:37:09] but when they come to the front yard
[1:37:12] they were going to be a unified family
[1:37:18] because
[1:37:20] they were
[1:37:22] of one blood
[1:37:26] now we're human beings we all have our
[1:37:29] preferences we all have our desires we
[1:37:32] all have things that we like or dislike
[1:37:34] and it may not be the same as the one
[1:37:37] that we go to church with and so there
[1:37:39] are times that we have heated
[1:37:41] discussions
[1:37:44] in the backyard
[1:37:47] but we had better make sure when we come
[1:37:51] to the front yard to fight the devil
[1:37:54] that we're standing together so much so
[1:37:58] that the enemy cannot get one razor
[1:38:01] blade in between us that he knows that
[1:38:03] we love one another and that we're a
[1:38:06] unified Army against all of the Wiles of
[1:38:08] the devil and we're going to see that he
[1:38:10] falls
[1:38:18] those of you that are familiar
[1:38:21] with
[1:38:23] the teaching of brother Branham you have
[1:38:26] no doubt listened to this message the
[1:38:28] stature of a perfect man and you know
[1:38:30] how that he talked about this pyramid
[1:38:33] and and he wrote all of these words in
[1:38:35] it and then the Capstone that had never
[1:38:38] come down uh perfect love and he took us
[1:38:42] to Zechariah Chapter Four
[1:38:46] Zechariah Chapter 4.
[1:38:51] I'm making your Works Mariah
[1:38:55] sorry I didn't give you all of them
[1:38:59] Zechariah Chapter 4.
[1:39:10] let's start with verse six then he
[1:39:12] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:39:14] is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel
[1:39:17] saying
[1:39:19] not by might
[1:39:21] not by power
[1:39:23] but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[1:39:28] who art thou o great Mountain before
[1:39:30] zerubba Bell
[1:39:32] Thou shalt become a plane and he shall
[1:39:36] bring forth The Headstone thereof with
[1:39:39] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it
[1:39:45] now what we have come to understand is
[1:39:50] that we were going to receive extra
[1:39:54] measures of Grace in order for this
[1:39:57] Capstone Ministry to set down upon the
[1:40:01] Bride of Jesus Christ This Love This
[1:40:04] this ability to love our neighbor as
[1:40:09] ourself
[1:40:15] we say we love God
[1:40:20] but if while we're saying we love God
[1:40:22] and we hate our brother
[1:40:26] we've got an issue here
[1:40:31] God is trying to get us to understand
[1:40:35] that he wants us to have love one for
[1:40:38] another because we are all Blood Bought
[1:40:42] we are all bought by the blood of the
[1:40:45] Lord Jesus Christ we are all of One
[1:40:47] blood
[1:40:51] we're all a part of the family of God
[1:40:53] and so he is
[1:40:55] helping us to understand the necessity
[1:40:58] for us to have this perfect love come
[1:41:01] down upon us and so this headstone comes
[1:41:04] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto
[1:41:08] it now I want you to notice in verse 7
[1:41:10] it's not by might or verse six it's not
[1:41:14] by now not by might
[1:41:18] you can't get loved by your sheer
[1:41:21] willpower
[1:41:27] because about the time that you think
[1:41:30] that you're gaining Love by your sheer
[1:41:33] willpower
[1:41:35] you'll punch somebody in the face
[1:41:39] because they'll
[1:41:41] make you mad
[1:41:44] so it's not by you'll never gain it by
[1:41:47] your own might
[1:41:51] it's not by power
[1:41:56] no matter what is moving in this
[1:42:02] what looks like power
[1:42:04] to us
[1:42:08] you're not going to gain love
[1:42:12] by power
[1:42:15] love is only going to come the headstone
[1:42:20] I want you to understand that the
[1:42:21] headstone the capping of this pyramid
[1:42:25] the capping of this house
[1:42:28] is only going to come by the spirit of
[1:42:33] the Lord
[1:42:37] and the way that that happens is
[1:42:41] that I
[1:42:43] daily and most times many times during
[1:42:48] the day have to lay down my own will
[1:42:56] because my own will is always trying to
[1:43:01] come up and out
[1:43:05] why is my will always trying to come up
[1:43:08] and out
[1:43:13] well let's go back to what we've been
[1:43:15] hearing in previous weeks about eating
[1:43:18] the book
[1:43:25] I'm just going to ask us
[1:43:29] what book am I eating
[1:43:36] because I think we eat some books
[1:43:42] and while we're eating them depending on
[1:43:45] where we're living at
[1:43:47] while we're eating them
[1:43:49] they're sweet in the mouth
[1:43:54] then they become bitter in the belly and
[1:43:56] they come back up and out
[1:43:59] let me tell you friends
[1:44:01] there are some of the books that we eat
[1:44:03] that when it comes back up and out
[1:44:06] it's ugly
[1:44:11] a book of the flesh
[1:44:13] is going to produce works of the Flesh
[1:44:16] and words of the flesh
[1:44:19] we have been instructed to eat a book
[1:44:21] and that is the Living Word
[1:44:24] that is sweet in our mouth and it's
[1:44:26] bitter in the belly but the necessity is
[1:44:30] that we are going to once again let it
[1:44:32] come up and out and it's going to be a
[1:44:35] beautiful thing as we prophesy again to
[1:44:38] the the to many peoples and Nations and
[1:44:41] tongues
[1:44:44] but for the moment
[1:44:47] God is trying to help us
[1:44:49] to be careful what we actually eat
[1:44:54] so
[1:44:56] we have to get in the spirit
[1:44:59] have to get in the Holy Spirit
[1:45:03] people get in spirits all right
[1:45:06] but we want to get in the Holy Spirit
[1:45:10] every day of our life get in the Holy
[1:45:13] Spirit till that the Lord can do his
[1:45:15] work in us and he can help us to
[1:45:18] understand the amount of selfishness
[1:45:23] that we have in our own life
[1:45:26] and we interact with one another and
[1:45:28] that selfishness comes
[1:45:36] I want to say
[1:45:39] the Lord by his spirit is helping us and
[1:45:43] it's becoming less and less
[1:45:47] we're recognizing As We Worship the Lord
[1:45:50] together and these songs that that
[1:45:53] Inspire us to go to a higher level and
[1:45:56] to hear the words of these songs and the
[1:45:59] word of the Lord that is embedded in
[1:46:01] those songs that starts have an effect
[1:46:04] on us so that when the word comes across
[1:46:06] this desk it can have more effect in us
[1:46:09] and where then those songs reverberate
[1:46:12] in our in our minds and uh as as we're
[1:46:16] going throughout the week and in a
[1:46:18] phrase like laid down life will start
[1:46:20] reverberating in our mind and we
[1:46:24] recognize that's what the Lord wants out
[1:46:26] of us
[1:46:27] a laid down life so that we are
[1:46:30] interacting with one another and we're
[1:46:32] loving our neighbor as ourself this is
[1:46:34] the fulfilling of the law and it is
[1:46:37] really all of this is God building up to
[1:46:40] the point where that he can allow this
[1:46:43] Capstone to come down on us
[1:46:46] not by might
[1:46:48] not by power
[1:46:50] but by his spirit
[1:46:53] so
[1:46:56] in in so doing
[1:46:59] God is
[1:47:02] working in US
[1:47:06] and it's not going to be
[1:47:09] a public show
[1:47:12] what God is doing in you and what he's
[1:47:14] doing in me
[1:47:17] is not a public show
[1:47:19] now it is going to be demonstrated
[1:47:23] as we go through this time of intimacy
[1:47:28] with the Lord Jesus Christ and he's
[1:47:30] working on us and working on us and
[1:47:32] working on us by his Spirit nobody
[1:47:35] really knows what's going on on the
[1:47:37] inside of you
[1:47:45] and there are times you know who God's
[1:47:47] working on somebody by how irritable
[1:47:49] they are
[1:47:55] I can't see what God's doing inside of
[1:47:58] you
[1:48:00] but I can tell by how irritable you are
[1:48:03] that you're having a little struggle
[1:48:07] you know how I know that
[1:48:11] been there
[1:48:17] yet God is working inside of you and
[1:48:20] inside of me
[1:48:22] and you can't see what he's doing in me
[1:48:25] you can't see all that that's going on
[1:48:28] up here
[1:48:29] down in here and the Quivers that I you
[1:48:33] know that that that that that feeling
[1:48:35] that you get ah you can't see that and I
[1:48:38] can't see it in you
[1:48:40] yet I know that God is working
[1:48:43] because there are changes that are
[1:48:46] happening it happening in US
[1:48:49] that are causing us to want more and
[1:48:53] more and more and yes there may be times
[1:48:56] that God comes and requires another
[1:48:58] Peace and you may see me get irritable
[1:49:00] but don't you worry
[1:49:04] because I'm called and I'm elected by
[1:49:06] the will of God I'm going to lay it down
[1:49:10] it may be a little struggle for me it
[1:49:12] may be a little struggle for you but
[1:49:14] we're going to lay it down because we
[1:49:16] know this is what God is Desiring of us
[1:49:19] and requiring of us and we desire to
[1:49:22] please him with everything that's with
[1:49:24] inside of us
[1:49:29] so it takes this time of intimacy
[1:49:33] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:37] and it requires
[1:49:41] this going on inside of us
[1:49:45] the devil
[1:49:47] he can't see what's happening in your
[1:49:49] life
[1:49:54] he sends struggles to you
[1:49:56] but he don't really know what's
[1:49:58] happening to you
[1:50:02] foreign
[1:50:09] Joseph
[1:50:12] was
[1:50:14] a young man
[1:50:18] and he had these dreams
[1:50:25] he had these dreams about the stars and
[1:50:28] the Moon and the Sun
[1:50:30] then he had dreams about the sheaves and
[1:50:37] at the moment that he's telling them I
[1:50:40] have a feeling that he
[1:50:42] was pretty inspired
[1:50:49] and
[1:50:51] his brothers hated him for it
[1:50:54] and even with the second one is his dad
[1:50:57] even
[1:50:58] scolded him and said oh you think now
[1:51:01] your mom and dad are even going to bow
[1:51:02] down before you
[1:51:06] Joseph didn't really understand
[1:51:10] God had given the dreams
[1:51:17] but Joseph and his immaturity was not
[1:51:19] yet ready
[1:51:22] to have the Fulfillment of the dreams
[1:51:27] so then God sends Joseph down to check
[1:51:30] on his brothers
[1:51:32] and when Joseph was sent down to check
[1:51:34] on his brothers
[1:51:37] they saw him coming and they said oh
[1:51:39] here comes the dreamer
[1:51:41] let's get rid of him
[1:51:46] now I don't know what was going through
[1:51:48] Joseph's mind at that time
[1:51:51] whether he
[1:51:53] had maybe
[1:51:54] the the the the excitement of those
[1:51:57] dreams maybe some of it had faded I
[1:51:59] don't know maybe he was holding them in
[1:52:01] his heart I don't know the Bible doesn't
[1:52:02] really say
[1:52:05] but they threw Joseph in a pit and then
[1:52:07] after a while they sold him
[1:52:10] and Joseph went down to Egypt as a slave
[1:52:16] and ended up in Potiphar's house
[1:52:21] and if his brothers could have said
[1:52:23] anything about him at that moment could
[1:52:25] they have got to him they may have
[1:52:28] ridiculed him and said what about the
[1:52:30] dreams now
[1:52:32] foreign
[1:52:36] you remember
[1:52:39] that God had a plan in his mind all
[1:52:42] along
[1:52:43] Joseph as the human being could not see
[1:52:47] the whole plan of God
[1:52:51] and I don't know how tightly he held on
[1:52:54] to the dream while he was in prison
[1:52:59] or in Potiphar's house first
[1:53:02] but he was a prisoner
[1:53:06] he was a slave
[1:53:08] how tightly did he hold on to the dreams
[1:53:13] or did he kind of have a feeling as we
[1:53:16] do sometime and say I don't see how this
[1:53:20] is ever going to have a fulfillment I'm
[1:53:21] a slave now
[1:53:27] God was working on Joseph
[1:53:30] and Joseph didn't even know it
[1:53:35] then
[1:53:38] God tightens the screw
[1:53:41] down
[1:53:46] and lets a Wicked Woman accuse him of
[1:53:49] wrongdoing
[1:53:55] you ever wonder if
[1:53:58] potiphar knew his wife
[1:54:02] did potiphar know that his wife had
[1:54:07] some of that
[1:54:09] Delilah spirit in her
[1:54:12] I don't know
[1:54:17] but she was after Joseph
[1:54:20] lay down with me Joseph come into my
[1:54:23] room Joseph and Joseph Joseph kept
[1:54:26] no no no no no
[1:54:30] your husband has put me over this house
[1:54:32] and I am not going to trespass against
[1:54:34] him
[1:54:37] God was working on Joseph
[1:54:40] putting him in those predicaments
[1:54:44] to test him to try him
[1:54:49] tribulations in his life
[1:54:53] because God had an end plan
[1:54:57] Joseph probably couldn't see it at that
[1:55:00] moment
[1:55:02] and probably even more shadowed when
[1:55:06] Joseph was thrown into prison
[1:55:10] because of a wrongful accusation against
[1:55:13] him
[1:55:14] yet God was using those tribulations to
[1:55:19] prepare Joseph
[1:55:22] for a higher calling than Joseph knew he
[1:55:26] was going to have
[1:55:29] I've pondered this story about Joseph
[1:55:32] for some months now since this has been
[1:55:36] called a year of the supernatural for us
[1:55:38] Joseph went through his life and he's
[1:55:41] being tested and he's being tried and
[1:55:43] he's being positioned and tested and
[1:55:46] tried and positioned and tested and
[1:55:48] tried
[1:55:52] and Joseph really didn't even know he
[1:55:55] was walking out
[1:55:57] a supernatural
[1:56:00] happening in his life
[1:56:06] when he was a slave in Potiphar's house
[1:56:08] it didn't feel Supernatural
[1:56:12] when he was when he was a prisoner in
[1:56:16] the prison house because of a false
[1:56:18] accusation it didn't feel Supernatural
[1:56:24] when the Butler and the baker were
[1:56:28] thrown into prison and had dreams
[1:56:30] probably the dreams that Joseph had had
[1:56:34] years earlier when they talked about
[1:56:37] their own dreams the Butler and the
[1:56:39] baker that that that whole scenario of
[1:56:42] Dreams was probably stirred up all over
[1:56:45] again in Joseph's mind even as he's
[1:56:48] given interpretations to their dreams
[1:56:51] and Joseph doesn't realize he's walking
[1:56:54] out Supernatural
[1:56:59] when the butler was restored according
[1:57:02] to the dream and the interpretation
[1:57:04] thereof when the baker was hung from a
[1:57:06] tree and the birds ate his flesh as the
[1:57:09] interpretation of the dream
[1:57:13] that was Supernatural
[1:57:17] but Joseph was still in prison
[1:57:22] because God was not finished with the
[1:57:26] preparation for Joseph just yet
[1:57:29] and so now Joseph
[1:57:33] for two more years even though he told
[1:57:35] these men when you're restored to your
[1:57:38] position Butler
[1:57:40] would you out of kindness
[1:57:42] tell Pharaoh that I've been wrongfully
[1:57:45] accused
[1:57:46] maybe I won't have to stay in this
[1:57:48] prison any longer
[1:57:51] but God was not yet through
[1:57:56] with dealing with Joseph
[1:58:00] Joseph did not know that something so
[1:58:04] significant and Supernatural what's
[1:58:07] about to happen to him
[1:58:10] because he was in this prison
[1:58:13] from a wrongful accusation
[1:58:17] yet it was all the training that God was
[1:58:21] using for him
[1:58:23] so that when he came to the place of
[1:58:26] prominence when he came to the place of
[1:58:29] power well actually when he came to the
[1:58:32] right time the right season to where
[1:58:36] that
[1:58:37] the pharaoh would have a dream
[1:58:41] and nobody could interpret the dream
[1:58:46] and all of the sudden the butler
[1:58:50] has this memory
[1:58:52] oh I remember I feel so bad now two
[1:58:56] years later
[1:59:02] but even that two extra years was a part
[1:59:05] of Joseph's training
[1:59:10] can you imagine
[1:59:13] after about the first month
[1:59:16] after you've interpreted these dreams
[1:59:19] and you say to the butler you're going
[1:59:21] to be restored to your position you're
[1:59:24] going to go back to tasting the wine for
[1:59:26] the king so that you can make sure that
[1:59:29] you drop dead first if somebody has
[1:59:31] poisoned it you you're going to be
[1:59:33] restored to your position and when
[1:59:35] you're restored to your position would
[1:59:37] you remember me
[1:59:41] how many times did Joseph have to say
[1:59:45] I forgive
[1:59:48] I forgive
[1:59:51] I forgive
[1:59:53] I forgive that Butler that he didn't
[1:59:55] remember to tell the Pharaoh about me
[2:00:02] you don't suppose it was all just hunky
[2:00:04] dory for Joseph when he wasn't
[2:00:06] remembered do you
[2:00:08] you don't think he had emotions
[2:00:12] he did
[2:00:16] and so after a while
[2:00:19] two years
[2:00:25] now
[2:00:27] all this time Joseph is being worked on
[2:00:29] I just want you to think about it just
[2:00:31] for a moment if
[2:00:33] Joseph had not allowed
[2:00:37] God to work on him
[2:00:40] in this course of years
[2:00:43] and all of the sudden
[2:00:47] he is called out of the prison and said
[2:00:49] the Pharaoh wants to see you he's had a
[2:00:51] dream
[2:00:55] if
[2:00:57] he had not allowed the work of the Lord
[2:01:00] in his life
[2:01:01] he would have probably
[2:01:03] had a response
[2:01:06] about time
[2:01:10] I told that butler two years ago when I
[2:01:13] interpreted his dream to remember me and
[2:01:16] here it is two years later before I
[2:01:18] finally get called
[2:01:22] no
[2:01:24] something had been happening in Joseph
[2:01:28] now Joseph appears before the Pharaoh
[2:01:31] the Pharaoh explains these dreams to him
[2:01:34] and Joseph gives the interpretation
[2:01:36] thereof and is put in a place of
[2:01:40] prominence to where that he is second in
[2:01:43] command only to the Pharaoh of the land
[2:01:45] and all of that training up through that
[2:01:49] uh all of his childhood on up into his
[2:01:52] teenage years to the time of being
[2:01:55] thrown in the pit and sold by his
[2:01:56] brothers taken as a slave to Potiphar's
[2:01:59] house and throw it in prison it was all
[2:02:02] leading up
[2:02:05] Supernatural
[2:02:10] when you're in the pit
[2:02:13] you can't see the supernatural
[2:02:16] when you're in the prison you can't see
[2:02:18] the supernatural
[2:02:21] I'd just like to encourage you today
[2:02:23] that whatever it feels like God is the
[2:02:28] god of Supernatural and he is working
[2:02:30] something Supernatural for you something
[2:02:33] Supernatural in your life and and I just
[2:02:37] want to bring this back to what we were
[2:02:39] talking about the other night from The
[2:02:41] Book of Ezekiel because out from the
[2:02:43] throne ushered this life-giving water
[2:02:45] and if you remember uh when we read that
[2:02:49] the other night it talked about this
[2:02:52] water when it come out from under the
[2:02:54] doors of the temple and it started
[2:02:56] flowing and as it as it started
[2:02:59] gathering together it started out to be
[2:03:01] ankle deep and then as he waited out it
[2:03:04] became uh
[2:03:07] Knee Deep and then going deep and then
[2:03:09] Waters to swim in
[2:03:12] and uh
[2:03:14] I would like to read to you I'm not real
[2:03:17] good at reading quotes but I would like
[2:03:20] to read to you from a message uh I only
[2:03:24] gave you one is that correct would you
[2:03:27] pull that up and let me
[2:03:29] read debt this is from a message from
[2:03:32] that time 1960. these men picked me up
[2:03:35] and set me up on a great big high place
[2:03:37] and sent me down he's talking about
[2:03:39] going beyond the curtain of time
[2:03:41] and they were praising God none of them
[2:03:44] kissing me just embracing me and saying
[2:03:46] brother our precious brother
[2:03:49] and I looked and people was coming from
[2:03:51] everywhere and I said what is this and
[2:03:54] that voice now from no one the same
[2:03:57] voice that spoke in the room was still
[2:03:59] with me he said this is perfect love
[2:04:05] and I've always taught the evidence of
[2:04:08] the Holy Ghost is perfect love see I
[2:04:11] believe in speaking in tongue sure but
[2:04:14] though I speak with tongue in men and
[2:04:16] angels and have not charity love I am
[2:04:20] nothing become a sounding brass and a
[2:04:22] tinkling symbol so when you speak with
[2:04:24] tongues and got love with it that'll
[2:04:27] show you
[2:04:28] see he's not doing away with the gift
[2:04:33] and the love that we would have here
[2:04:36] would be like starting here from a
[2:04:39] shadow of the shadow of the Shadow into
[2:04:42] the Shadow and from the shadow to a Mist
[2:04:45] now he's talking about how it progresses
[2:04:48] and that's what I want you to kind of
[2:04:50] get an idea in the picture in your mind
[2:04:53] when we were talking on uh Tuesday night
[2:04:56] about that water that is Flowing it is
[2:04:58] Flowing this healing river flowing from
[2:05:01] the Throne of God and it's flowing from
[2:05:04] the very essence of the love of God and
[2:05:08] as you step in remember where we're
[2:05:11] starting really at the bottom with faith
[2:05:13] and it's it's very shallow it's very
[2:05:16] small and here he's putting it in
[2:05:18] different words it's a shadow of a
[2:05:20] shadow and from the shadow to a mist
[2:05:24] and to a little moisture and into a
[2:05:27] creek and into a river and then into an
[2:05:29] ocean that's where it arrive at there
[2:05:32] just perfect everything so as this love
[2:05:38] this the love of God is setting down
[2:05:40] we've we've got the faith and The Virtue
[2:05:43] the knowledge and the temperance and the
[2:05:45] patience and the godliness and brotherly
[2:05:47] kindness all of these things are being
[2:05:49] worked in us and again we can't really
[2:05:52] see what God is doing in us
[2:05:54] supernaturally but he is really working
[2:05:56] supernaturally friends
[2:05:59] the work that is going on in you and in
[2:06:02] me
[2:06:03] that God is doing
[2:06:05] it is not natural
[2:06:12] it's not by any of your might
[2:06:16] it's by your yes
[2:06:18] but it's not by your might
[2:06:23] because I can utter a yes out of my
[2:06:26] mouth
[2:06:27] that has no heart connection
[2:06:34] but if I can utter a yes to the Lord
[2:06:37] with a heart connection
[2:06:39] and say Lord I really desire to serve
[2:06:43] you with everything that's within me and
[2:06:45] I desire for there to be a completeness
[2:06:48] to what you promise what is going on
[2:06:50] inside of you is Supernatural
[2:06:54] for you to be able to say yes over and
[2:06:57] over again
[2:07:02] think about the natural just a minute
[2:07:08] because if
[2:07:10] in the natural
[2:07:13] somebody comes up to you every day
[2:07:17] and punches you in the side of the head
[2:07:22] and you
[2:07:24] might the first day
[2:07:26] kind of look at them a little sideways
[2:07:29] may even have a silly laugh
[2:07:33] say okay
[2:07:35] the next day
[2:07:37] same person comes up
[2:07:40] pounds you in the side of the head
[2:07:43] the next day they come and pound you on
[2:07:45] the side of the head
[2:07:47] after a while you're going to say
[2:07:49] enough of that
[2:07:54] I'm taking a different path
[2:07:56] I'm going to put somebody around me
[2:07:58] that'll punch back
[2:08:01] this is the natural
[2:08:05] that's the way we react in the natural
[2:08:12] we'll hit back
[2:08:14] punch back
[2:08:17] change paths do something
[2:08:21] but in the Inner Man
[2:08:24] there is something Supernatural
[2:08:26] happening
[2:08:27] because
[2:08:30] the devil which is a tool in the hands
[2:08:33] of God to bring about a perfection in a
[2:08:37] body of Believers comes to us day after
[2:08:40] day after day after day and he's the
[2:08:43] tool in the hands of God because God is
[2:08:46] Desiring for us to come to a stature of
[2:08:49] the fullness of Christ and we could
[2:08:52] react the same way we do in the natural
[2:08:54] I've had enough of this
[2:09:00] but yet
[2:09:02] we have sense enough to know this is of
[2:09:05] God
[2:09:09] sounds kind of silly doesn't it
[2:09:12] this beating is of God
[2:09:17] this battle is of God
[2:09:22] pick in the ribs is of God
[2:09:25] this mind battle is of God
[2:09:28] and we find ourselves saying yes
[2:09:32] you haven't got the power inside of you
[2:09:35] to do that
[2:09:37] it's a supernatural by the spirit of God
[2:09:40] that you can say yes Lord
[2:09:43] I'll lay that down
[2:09:45] Next Day a different punch yes Lord I
[2:09:49] see what you're trying to work on I'll
[2:09:52] lay that down
[2:09:54] it's all part of God trying to get you
[2:09:58] till that you can love your neighbor as
[2:10:01] yourself
[2:10:04] and in loving your neighbor as yourself
[2:10:07] it's increasing This Love
[2:10:11] the love this way is increasing this
[2:10:15] to him
[2:10:17] because you are now seeing your neighbor
[2:10:23] as something more than just a human
[2:10:26] being
[2:10:28] you are seeing them as a creation of the
[2:10:32] Living God the one who created the
[2:10:34] heavens and the Earth and you're seeing
[2:10:36] them as a creation that you can allow
[2:10:40] the love of Jesus Christ
[2:10:43] to work through you that you can love
[2:10:47] someone as he loved someone
[2:10:50] this statement for some people you're
[2:10:53] the only Jesus that they'll ever see
[2:10:58] and they're looking for him
[2:11:02] especially in people that claim to be
[2:11:04] believers
[2:11:06] they're looking for him
[2:11:10] and so
[2:11:12] God put you on the Earth
[2:11:14] and he lets Trials come to you
[2:11:17] just as when Jesus walked the Earth the
[2:11:20] Trials come to him they're coming to you
[2:11:23] because your desire is to become like
[2:11:26] Jesus Christ
[2:11:27] and he while he walked the Earth the
[2:11:30] Bible tells us that though he were a son
[2:11:33] yet learned he obedience by the things
[2:11:36] he suffered musicians you can come
[2:11:38] please
[2:11:40] by the things that he suffered he was he
[2:11:43] was
[2:11:45] becoming the son that he was destined to
[2:11:48] be and he allowed you to be on the earth
[2:11:51] so that you could fulfill the purposes
[2:11:55] of God in the earth till that you
[2:11:59] as well
[2:12:01] could become the son that he ordained
[2:12:04] for you to be
[2:12:05] by the things that you suffer
[2:12:12] you don't have to be
[2:12:14] like a Catholic
[2:12:18] you don't have to go find something
[2:12:23] to do to make yourself suffer
[2:12:28] don't have to do Penance you don't have
[2:12:31] to go climb over
[2:12:34] steps with glass in it or some wild
[2:12:37] thing to to suffer enough to get good
[2:12:42] enough for God
[2:12:46] like to remind you
[2:12:49] you can't get good enough
[2:12:54] you can never get good enough for God to
[2:12:57] accept you
[2:12:59] he already paid the price and he put the
[2:13:02] invitation out
[2:13:04] once he put the invitation out and he
[2:13:07] said come unto me all you that labor and
[2:13:09] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[2:13:11] he really wants to give you rest from
[2:13:13] your labors
[2:13:15] and he wants you to air get under his
[2:13:18] yoke because he said his yoke was easy
[2:13:21] and his burden was light so he wants you
[2:13:23] to get under his yoke
[2:13:26] he wants you to recognize that
[2:13:29] everything that comes your way every
[2:13:32] trial of life is because he is trying to
[2:13:36] get you to bring to to have your destiny
[2:13:40] fulfilled in the Earth
[2:13:43] what your destiny will look like I don't
[2:13:46] know I don't know what mine looks like
[2:13:48] no more than Joseph knew what his would
[2:13:50] look like
[2:13:51] all he could see was
[2:13:54] had some dreams
[2:13:58] saw sheaves bow and down before me
[2:14:04] now let's just be human beings
[2:14:09] if you were 16 or 17 years old
[2:14:13] and you saw these sheaves bowing down
[2:14:15] before you
[2:14:18] probably a little pride would get there
[2:14:25] I'm gonna be something
[2:14:30] don't know what that something looks
[2:14:32] like but somebody Something's Gonna bow
[2:14:33] down before me
[2:14:36] and then to have another dream
[2:14:43] yet we're not fit at that moment
[2:14:49] and we can scream and cry and jump up
[2:14:51] and down and say God why did you show
[2:14:53] this to me if it's going to take years
[2:14:55] to fulfill
[2:15:03] yet God
[2:15:06] come unto me
[2:15:07] all you that labor and are heavy laden
[2:15:12] and I will give you rest
[2:15:15] get under my yoke take my yoke upon you
[2:15:20] but Lord what about this and what about
[2:15:22] this and
[2:15:23] why am I in prison and why is it so dark
[2:15:27] and
[2:15:33] you're not ready yet
[2:15:37] I'm training
[2:15:40] I'm training
[2:15:43] it's all Supernatural it doesn't feel
[2:15:45] very natural it doesn't feel very
[2:15:46] Supernatural when you're in a natural
[2:15:48] prison
[2:15:51] no more than it did for Peter
[2:15:55] it didn't feel very Supernatural to be
[2:15:57] in a prison
[2:16:00] it felt so natural
[2:16:03] that the angel had to give him another
[2:16:05] kick and say get up boy
[2:16:12] you're living so much in the natural I
[2:16:15] got to give you another kick to let you
[2:16:16] know something Supernatural is happening
[2:16:22] Peter didn't realize that something
[2:16:24] Supernatural was going on
[2:16:28] he was in prison
[2:16:31] but Supernatural was happening
[2:16:36] so no matter where you're at today
[2:16:40] not really sure why I've diverted down
[2:16:42] this road
[2:16:44] but no matter where you're at today
[2:16:48] whatever it feels like right now
[2:16:51] you are in a supernatural
[2:16:54] Vision you're in a supernatural walk
[2:16:58] Supernatural is happening there is
[2:17:00] Supernatural happening in you it feels
[2:17:03] As Natural As Natural can be when you're
[2:17:07] fighting them out mind battle
[2:17:11] but I remind you once again
[2:17:13] God is doing something Supernatural
[2:17:16] inside of you that the devil can't get
[2:17:19] to and distort he can't destroy it he
[2:17:23] can't distort it he can't get a hold of
[2:17:25] it he doesn't understand it he only sees
[2:17:29] the effects of it and the effects are
[2:17:33] bringing about a love in the body of
[2:17:36] Christ because we're not remaining in
[2:17:39] the trickle we're not remaining in the
[2:17:41] ankle deep We are continuing to move
[2:17:44] forward In this River that is Flowing
[2:17:46] from the Throne of God this perfect love
[2:17:49] we are stepping out further and further
[2:17:52] into it to allow God to absorb Us in it
[2:17:55] so that we can interact with one another
[2:18:01] and it's no more displaying self
[2:18:04] but it's displaying him
[2:18:08] Stand Together
