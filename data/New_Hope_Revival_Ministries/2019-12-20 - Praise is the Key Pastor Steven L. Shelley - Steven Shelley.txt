========================================

Description:
According to Psalm 50:23 our praise is a slaughtered sacrifice. The nature of praise is an offering. It doesn't always come out of our abundance but as a response to God's faithfulness. So regardless of our circumstances, we should raise up with a loud voice to praise the Lord!

David said that he prayed 3 times daily but he praised 7 times daily. Maybe if we would praise more we would find that our prayer life was more effective.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus received a change of clothes he laid aside the glory he shared with the father it's at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ it's your faith that has been tried by the fire would be worthy of the well done he chooses to see what he saw about me that's mercy my love his grace take your place and take it now your family is at stake it's never too late for a man of integrity to go before God on behalf of his children [Music] [Music] I'm going to preach on praise hi I know there are other subjects but I'm stuck on this one you talk about him and he comes when I shared that experience with you Tuesday night of the Lord riding coming to me and an experience riding on the praises of his people when I told you about that Tuesday night I went home and experienced something so similar just a slight few little differences in it experienced something so similar to that again that I thought to myself my if that's all it takes is sharing it to experience it and to have then I ought not to hold back at all there's nothing like the thought of the Lord riding coming to you and he's riding on the praises of his bride praise is important if you believe that say man some 22 verse 1 my God my God why hast thou forsaken me this is not Jesus this is the psalmist why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my god I cry in the daytime but thou here is not and in the night season and am not silent but thou art holy come on now thou art holy o thou that inhabited the praises of Israel hallelujah thou art holy this was a psalmist who said I cry out and I don't feel like you hear me I pray and I don't get any answer but thou art holy o thou that inhabited the praises of Israel he felt like if I can just praise him he'll come to me come on now if I can just praise him he'll come to me let's pray father I thank you this morning for the wonderful presence of the Lord I thank you for fasting and praying and those who have been seeking your face and we know Lord that's just a tiny little taste a tiny little touch of what you have for your people but Lord I so appreciate it and we are so thankful for the atmosphere that was created this morning I was reminded in the new song that we sung Lord there's no giant can stand before your people for the battle is yours the battle is yours and Lord we give you praise that the battle is yours you are the victor and you have given us the spoils of victory and we praise you this morning Lord we praise you from the bottom of all we are we lift up your holy name and we say God you are worthy to be praised hallelujah and when we leave this place give us grace to walk straight Lord give us grace to please you in our words in our life in our action and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for its in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we pray amen you may be seated God delights in your praises in the old days it was a little bit hard to praise the Lord if you knew you weren't living right you know they just had this mentality and if you if you knew there were things in your life that ought not to be there well it was hard to praise the Lord because we heard all the time that God doesn't hear the prayer of sinners unless it's a prayer of repentance when will they got that might have been a scripture I can't help it it's in there but they emphasize that so much that people got this idea that in unless I know that everything is okay and I'm doing all I can and and there's nothing in me that would Mar me in any way until I get to that place I can't praise the Lord because if I do that's just like giving God dirty hands I don't believe that I want you to know this morning that I believe God delights in your praise he wants you to live right he wants you to walk in righteousness but I believe that God sees your praise if a sinner can pay his tithe and be blessed come on now if somebody who doesn't even serve the Lord can give God his part and receive a portion of the blessing that goes with that then I am convinced that you don't have to get clean enough to offer God a praise that he delights in he wants to hear you sing he wants to hear you praise Him and my granny used to say praise Him praise Him in advance praise Him before you get what you're looking for and she said if you do that God will store it up and when you're ready to get it it'll come but praise Him in advance and she also said she so many times God filled people with the Holy Ghost what she called on credit I said now granny I never read that in the Bible she said well I never read it in the Bible either but she said I've seen some of the meanest ungodly 'us rottenness people you'd ever want to know come and get saved ask the Lord to come into life and pray all the way through to the Holy Ghost in one service and there would be people sitting all over the building that had been seeking the Lord for the Holy Ghost 20 years and she said people would say sister Shelly why are they why would God do that because that man's got a lot to clean up or that woman's got to a lot to clean up and there they have prayed all the way through to the Holy Ghost she said well I don't know except that they touched the heart of God and he poured his spirit out and they hadn't been so hardened by religion that that they resisted what they felt and and they Annie she said maybe just fill them on credit because she said it takes a portion and it's true the scripture takes a portion of the Holy Ghost to start dealing and convicting see that's what the Baptist teach they believe you receive the Holy Spirit at repentance and if you didn't to receive another spirit at repentance you wouldn't have any strength to make any change in your life so they're not wrong that's why people say we're Baptists kostol because we believe that there is a place of eternal security in the word and that is not a license to sin but it's a grace to help you live the way you desire to live for him amen but I also believe that portion that you get in repentance it's not all there is for you I believe there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes but they were preaching so hard in those days you can't get the Holy Ghost until you're sanctified you got to be sanctified I believe in that but I want you to know you can't sanctify yourself enough not enough he has to come and brother when he comes with that sanctifying portion of his spirit the things you once loved you don't love them anymore the things you once hated you now loved and you're like that that man that we sung about I knew my family didn't like it that way because I'd heard my uncle say that when he got religion he didn't act that way but I stumbled to the altar he went to watch and to see what other people were doing but something got ahold of him I believe that is the grace of God in our lives to help us get to the place where we can make a full surrender to Him how many of you're glad that the Spirit of the Lord is for you he's for you he's not against you you with me this is the psalmist and he is prophesying in song not only is he prophesying in song but he is walking in spiritual parallel he's walking in a prophetic gift whether he realizes in her heart and he is singing and prophesying the very words that Jesus will utter and they will be recorded from the cross my father my father my God my God why have you forsaken me and when you recognize that David was moving in the spirit even though a lot of bad things were going on in his life at the time God was still allowing him to move in that spirit and pick up the inspiration of Messianic prophecy I really appreciate that and when you realize that you look over the life of David and you see that there were some real parallels in David's life he really had some suffering to do before he rained didney though he made some huge mistakes I want you to know they were huge mistakes he committed adultery and then murder to cover up that adultery but let's know something else about David he came with a heart of repentance because in all of David's shortcoming he never lost his praise this is something that we need to realize he didn't say I'm too dirty to praise he didn't come to receive something in praise he came to give something I want you to know praise as your offering you're not praising to get you're praising to give you're giving something away when you praise the Lord Amen because David saw that God in habit dissed he inhabits the praises of his people he lives in our praise that word inhabited the word in Hebrew means to sit to remain to dwell it means to stay to tarry all those words he tarries in the praises of his people he stays in the praises of his people you understand the scripture he lives there in those praises but that same Hebrew word also means a seat a dwelling a throne God sits on a throne of our praises think about it so this is perhaps what I was seeing in that experience God sitting Jesus sitting on the praise of his bride riding in I want you to hear me riding in not riding out riding in he was coming our way he was coming toward us and what was bringing him was the praises of his bride when you get that in your spirit this morning your praise will take on a new purpose because you're giving something away when you praise the Lord but you're also providing him a place to rest a place to sit a place to dwell to tarry to abide the Hebrew word is a seat also or a throne you are allowing the Holy One to be in throw and in your praises you heard us the other day they put a clip out about that Ark of the Covenant that is within that is his throne in this hour this is where the Lord is you want to know where the Lord is sitting he's sitting in his bride come on he's with us and he's going to be with us until the end of this thing he's never going to leave us now how many of you believe that he's gonna be with us until that time of glorious resurrection when the dead in Christ will rise first and we which are alive we're going to be caught up together to meet the Lord and to meet them in the air do you still believe in the resurrection rapture I still believe in that so if you take that Hebrew word and you should use that to help you understand that verse it could easily be translated this way you are holy now let's not forget what he was saying I pray and you don't hear me I ask and I don't receive but thou art holy that sounds like a backer clear the day didn't it ho the fields are barren fig trees have no kasam everything is about to get worse yet ah will praise thee David saying something very similar here he is saying o my prayers just fall to the ground it seems but holy you are holy and you are in throne on the praises of Israel how many of you know your spiritual Israel you are spiritual Israel this morning no doubt about it and if God was enthroned on the praises of his Old Testament Israel he is certainly in thrown on the praises of his people under the New Covenant can you believe that I believe it he could sit anywhere that he wanted to see it he could dwell anywhere that he wanted to dwell but guess where he chooses to dwell to be enthroned in our praises when you praise the Lord you're giving him a place in your life you're inviting him to come and sit in the middle of your stuff there's some stuff here Lord that you're not gonna like but I need your help in getting rid of that stuff so I'm going to bring you in and allow you to be enthroned in my praise I'm not praising because I'm worthy I'm praising you because you are worthy you are worthy my praise is not about me it's about you it's about who you are it's about giving you a place to dwell to abide to remain to stay - Terry - take your seat in my life in psalm 55:17 David said that he prayed three times a day now think about it three times a day evening and morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice same psalmist who said I pray and you don't hear me now he says I pray three times a day and you hear me I like it I like it because these songs were written at various times in David's life when he was going through different things and they reflect where he was in that particular moment just like your praise will at times it will reflect where you are in that moment but if I can find a place where David stopped praising the Lord I can't find it yet I'm still looking to find the place where he said life is just too tough I don't have any praise left in me I can't find that yet but I hear him saying over and over again I'm troubled I'm in dire straits I've got a lot of stuff going on but you are holy you are faithful as we heard son this morning you are good and I'm going to praise your name Saul is after him to kill him he is running for his life he will tell the story of some of his running and some of his hardship and yet in the midst of all of that like job in the midst of all that like job in the midst of some grumbling and a little bit of reflecting on how he feels mixed all in that song I will praise you Lord because you are wonderful and worthy you see David recognized my station changes my situation changes my feelings change my circumstances changed but my god he never changes oh he is always the same he is always faithful he is always good when there's more than enough he's God and when there's nothing he is still God and he's still able to provide David's you know his musing his reflection was certainly influenced by what he was going through but not his praise how many of you could agree with that you might find some little place where it's a little out of balance but there's a whole lot of blessing a whole lot of praising going on and there's some suffering going on in the Book of Psalms to let us know that the godly life the dedicated life the surrendered life it's not an easy life it's not a life with no hardship come on it's not a life with no heartache it's not a life with no suffering but God is good I want you to look at somebody and say look God is good tell them right now God is good he could sit anywhere in this world that he wants to sit give me just a little more in this monitor would you please he could sit anywhere in this world that he wants to sit but he chooses to sit right down in the middle of the praises of his people you want to bring God into this place why don't you help me preach you want to bring God into this plate do what you did this morning praising how you don't have to wait for somebody to call you up here you come up here when you want to I noticed that you were bringing a sacrifice of praise surely you didn't come in here feeling like that real praise is gonna cost you something are you with me evening morning at noon I will pray and he must have been Pentecostal because he said I'll cry loud he wasn't a silent prayer he led his petition he led his supplication they known he wasn't ashamed to pray three times a day I wonder if anybody has that discipline you're gonna make sure that you pray three times a day what if it was like a Daniels day where a decree is made you better not pray to that God and you do like David who has this discipline in his life to pray he doesn't get in the closet and shut the door did he no sir he went over and opened up the window so that all the Babylon could know that he would dare defy the decree of the king that's that's faithful David said I pray three times a day in the evening in the morning and at noon would you look at psalms 119 verse 164 and 165 that 119 is a long Psalm isn't it it's a big one look at 164 165 seven times a day do i what let me hear you say it again seven times a day do I praise thee how many times did he say prayed evening morning at noon how many times did he say praised every day seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments who great peace have made the next verse great peace have they which love thy law and nothing huh nothing shall offend them I preached a message here not too long ago as some speakers say it went over like a rat sandwich nobody really wanted it but I preached a little message that said there's no room for feelings in the bride and nobody really wants to embrace that kind of an idea but a prophet was pretty clear you gotta be able I don't know how I don't know when but I know where the grace will come from I'm gonna keep looking to the hills until I can get to that place that nothing offends me how many of you will make the same commitment I'm gonna keep looking to the hills I'm gonna keep looking to where my help comes from I'm gonna keep leaning and depending on the faithful God the one who's chasing me down with his goodness I'm gonna keep depending on the grace that I know he has to drop it over in my life that nothing peace and grace that nothing would be able to offend me because I know that I'm one of his and I know that I'm one of those who love his law how many of you would like to have that grace that peace in your life that nothing offended you nothing even a lot of junk that goes on out there in the world that we take so personal sometime but if we're not careful it will put on us a political spirit I don't want that I don't want my reaction to what's going on out there to give me a critical political spirit that divides instead of brings us together we all have our opinion about what's going on but I'd like to be in a place where instead of being offended this world's messed up folks when we're offended we draw back so we don't want to be offended we want to be challenged we want to be convicted we want to be quickened we want to be moved but we don't want to be a people so easily offended and especially with one another come on now with one another I said to you I've got to have peace and grace it only comes from God I'm not there yet I'm closer there than I have been in time past but closer there this is not a game of horseshoes this is a game of wanting to go all the way great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them you love the law of God but nothing shall offend them but I want you to go back and show us the verse that leads to that seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments great peace after they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them do you think maybe praise it's part of the key to get to a place where you can move and rest and move in peace and move with a non-offending spirit have you ever thought about if we really praise the Lord with our life not with just our demonstration in church but but we need that but also our life if we praise him if we lift him up if he really dwells in our praises if he really comes to sit where we have prepared praise for him will he not bring the peace we're looking for won't he bring the grace we need to get over whatever it is we're walking through I believe he will I believe once again I can say praise is a key and how many times a day or the show how many times a day did he praise seven times a day how many times did he say prayed three that is at least twice as many times Watchmen II said praise is the highest work carried out by God's children let me say it again praise it's the highest work carried out by God's children does anybody know the history and story of watchman Nee and you know a little bit about it he's written some amazing very simple but very deep material he was imprisoned he suffered he really paid a price to teach his people the simplicity of the gospel he went through a lot of stuff and he had some ideas that some people may not embrace but he has said some things that have been transformational at times in my life this is one that could help us praise is the highest work carried out by God's children we know how important prayer is we know that prayer is not only our responsibility but it's our privilege but here is a man after God's heart who said I pray in the evening in the morning or at noon but seven times a day I praise the Lord seven times twice as many times I praise then I pray come on he must have knew that there's a key with our Thanksgiving with our gratitude with our praise there must be a key I had this thought that if we praised more we would create a better atmosphere in our life and we could pray more strategically more anointed targeted prophetic prayers are you in me how many of you like to pray prophetic prayers somebody said what is it prayers that agree with the heart of God prophetic prayer prayers that are ahead of their reality and fulfillment we pray now concerning what God is about to do and we can only do that in an atmosphere of the Spirit we can only do that in another realm and is it possible that if we praised more we could pray more effectively I don't want to say pray less because that means some folk wouldn't be praying at all but more effectively is there anybody in here they'd like to pray more effective prayers there are times to praise we better be praising more than we're fretting we better even be praising more than we're praying because it's not about asking huh it's about giving how many of you know when my enemies we're searching me down to destroy me I prayed for them he said I made my clothes sackcloth and ashes and I prayed for my enemies what a concept same psalmist and my prayers returned come on now oh when you're casting good bread on the water you can be assured that it'll return to you not many days hence David proved this in his lifestyle oh I prayed for the I was sick he said I was afflicted I was in bad shape but I prayed for my enemies sister Rhonda and when I prayed for them What did he say my prayers did what they return to my own bosom oh come on I prayed for them come on those who despitefully use you those who have abused you there's freedom there's freedom in being able to pray and listen Church you got to get out from under self-righteous prayer oh I prayed for some of my enemies I sure have Lord I'd like for you to mop up the floor we maybe not all of us I hate to say that we're brother Hicks saying my mama I don't want to say all of us have but some of us to be honest we've said Lord get him get him really Lord get them they need it but David wasn't praying get him he was freeing get him different attitude Oh God get their hearts change their lives your judgment is not going to bring them but your love your mercy hey your goodness chasing after them I've had people say to me when I was back slid when I was away from the Lord something good happened in my life I knew that the Lord had brought it I knew I didn't deserve it I knew it wasn't anything I deserved or ought to have but I knew that it wouldn't happen without the Lord helping me and it caused my heart to want to turn toward him instead of away from him how many of you understand so we asked you Lord get'em with conviction with mercy with love but we don't want to see them destroyed we want to see them ministered to are you still here I need to close in a little bit so David was praising twice as much as he was asking some of us treat God like Santa Claus we only sit on his lap when we need something how most of us here we don't teach our children anything like that we just feel pretty strong and if you tell your children over and over and over a lie when they face life and the enemy gets in their head and he will we don't want them to come around and think that as you have told them about the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny and the Santa Claus you've also told them about Jesus and we don't want them to think that's a myth he's not a myth he's the only hope we have for eternal life and so we have to be careful what we tell our children amen we treat God that way we just warm up on his lap sometime because we need something and we know he already knows he already sees through us we don't ever have to feel guilty about approaching the Lord if we are walking in an attitude of praise and gratitude if you just go every day praising him lord I thank you lord I thank you I thank you for answered prayer I thank you for grace and mercy seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments lord thank you that America has not yet been destroyed thank you for for three plus years of reprieve in this country thank you for a for a bill against anti-semitism sign this week by our president thank you for that thank you Lord for the anniversary of the embassy moving from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Lord thank you for that thank you for the last full moon of this decade on 1212 and its peak was 1212 so this last full moon of the decade came on December 12 and peaked at 12:12 number 12 is government government of God I'm not going to make something out of everything but if something becomes so obvious God's saying something you get up at 3 o'clock in the morning and you don't have to turn on the night light to go to the bathroom because the light is shut the moon is shining in so bright you can see everything on the counter I could see everything it was like the lights were on in my bedroom because our bedroom faces the moon and not at night I could see everything and you just can't help but remember what we heard a prophet say it's only when the Sun goes that the moon shines but the moon is a reflection of the sunlight and the moon is a type of the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah and the real government of God is going to sit on the shoulders of those who carry Messiah on the throne of their life by giving him lordship and kingship full authority over everything that they are over everything that they have so these are glorious days come on now they're there in many ways terrible days oh yes but in many ways glorious days because God's doing his business God is faithful he's keeping up with his plan how many of you know he hadn't put anything on the back burner no siree everything God has promised it's always right before his eyes I'm nearly done this morning but it's right before his eyes he hasn't shoved anything to the backburner to forget it he can't see you without seeing your promise when he looks at you he sees your promise when he looks at you he sees your fullness come on he sees what the Blood has accomplished in your life all the way are you with me no under David when it came time to dedicate you're pointed Levites to play psalteries and harps to exalt the king to thank the Lord day and night hired musicians pitched a tent on Zion for the Ark of the Covenant changing the order of the day not hiding it behind the veil so the common man could never see the glory he was so glad to have the Ark of the Covenant back home in the city of Jerusalem the city of the Great King that he pitched a temp luck had never been pitched before that did not include a heavy veil of separation but it made an access for the people to stand off and see what was inside the tent and he lined the way with musicians and with singers who would just sing of the goodness of the Lord and the mercies of the Lord 24 hours a day they are singing praises unto God and magnifying the Lord you know that must have changed the atmosphere in Jerusalem come on now you've got a dedicated people now he had to hire them to do it because they had to live I'm sure they couldn't have jobs and be on duty all the time so he hired them and he placed them in shifts and he made sure their needs were taken care of and and their responsibility was to be on the step to be on the right post to sing the praises of God to play instruments under the Lord and do it over and over and over and over again because David recognized that pray shifts the atmosphere praise makes a difference in what we are feeling and what we're experiencing come on now and Solomon carried that tradition on so that when the temple was dedicated to the Lord the same kind of glorious praise was going up from before the altar trumpets were sounding and cymbals were playing Solomon was not Church of Christ he believed it was all right to play instruments and to give every talent to the Lord to the praise of God you're gonna do it do all you got give it all you have if you're gonna do something for God hear me somebody if you're gonna do something for the Lord give him everything you've got everything give it all to him like granny standing behind me with the guitar and if I ever got too low I sing loud down I've had too many strikes on the back of my head because granny would be playing over here and I'd be standing there and if I if I went a little softer on the sound she just she just took the neck of the guitar hit me right I can tell you some of the songs I was singing at the time I was singing we've got the power but I was just singing it we've got the power yeah I looked at her she said if you're gonna sing about the power you gotta sing like somebody to know some power she was serious come on now I can show you I can show you there wasn't no strum plate what that's not what they call them what I'm sure of what now a pick guard now that sounds so much better than strum plate from guards from play it didn't do no good old granny always kept very nice Gibson's always had a little hick guard but but granny didn't strum like that you got a you know strum like this for that to do any good granny strum like this and so when she left this world all of her guitars had valleys in them cut right through the finish and ride into the wood because granny had this concept if you're giving it to God sing loud with your heart if you're dancing you ought to give God everything you have and don't you sit back you stuck in the mud you and make fun of somebody else I'll just say this a lot somebody else's praise is not your business it's just not your place to tell somebody else how they ought to praise the Lord if they become a distraction we know how to speak to that if they get way out of order we know how to speak to that but I want to tell you something sweetheart my praise is nunya it isn't and I'm not saying that to be offensive to you I'm saying that so you get your mouth off of somebody else's phrase I don't understand some things I see oh it is not a requirement for you to understand somebody else's phrase but it is a requirement for you to get your own you're gonna get your own phrase it may not look like somebody else's prize but you gotta have some there's got to be a praise that comes out of you because you're here but if you keep observing and studying and critiquing and criticizing somebody else's praise I believe in modesty I believe in holiness believe when you're in the aisle or in the front you need to be mindful of your attire when you're dancing or worshiping the Lord that's not being legalistic it's it's right I've been on the conference circuit I've had to stand on the front row while women stood in front of their husbands to keep them from having to look at the Jezebel's that were dancing seductively around their husbands now that ain't God no woman ought to have to give up her praise to stand between that spirit and her husband come on now and I've seen that I don't believe in that I believe there's an order and I believe there's modesty and if you're gonna worship here please know that but but that is not something that anybody needs to get so hung up in that that you feel like that you're called to be the praise police you just praise you get your eyes on Jesus come on now get him off of somebody else listen I've told you about the tenth meeting in South Carolina where God healed those people the woman pushing the wheelchair you seen the picture of and God healed a man and a woman of AIDS and the stories are out there this black brother Caleb in the oniy who came here to preach he had just come from one of the pastors that was there and he had told him the testimony of how God had healed two of those from one family of AIDS in that meeting and when the presence of God came down and did what he did most people will worship in the Lord now I want to tell you something some of those family members had to come in they was barely dressed it was hot summertime in South Carolina muggy and mosquitoes there was a few times that it looked like there was more hanging out than there was tucked in do you know what I mean and my first reaction would have been somebody ought to help you know somebody ought to wrap them up somebody ought to do son who's gonna do it and all of a sudden I thought as I scanned the crowd and I saw all those revelaed people who'd been in the word for 25-30 years dead couldn't even praise the Lord that someone was testifying of being healed of AIDS when they were telling all over the country that there's no documented cases at that time they were telling all over the country no documented cases of everybody anybody ever coming back from AIDS totally healed and these believers sitting there praise the Lord praise the Lord and the ones who weren't doing that we're evaluating and I realize I got first of all I gotta stop looking because I'm seeing more than I need to see and second of all this is my house this ain't my tent I didn't put this somebody else is conducting this meeting I need to get my eyes off of that get my eyes on the Lord get my own praise on and you know what God knew what he was doing he sent his glory on that family and save them fill them with the Holy Ghost set members of that family free and they now that church is filled with second and third generation brother Kaylin I only know some of them 2nd and 3rd generation from that very family that got so touched they didn't know no better all they knew is God had just given their loved one back all they knew is that there was an atmosphere in there that you could feel and they couldn't be still my old gray-headed aunt used to sing a song that said I can't be still my heart would chill since I have found the Holy Ghost and it changed my stubborn will I can't be still I know what he's done for me and I've just got to give him praise I'm encouraging you to get your praise on it's not for show it's not to draw somebody else's attention but if enough good the Holy Ghost sincere people will do like you did today create an atmosphere nobody will have time to look around to see what anybody else is doing I've been in churches who claim to believe the word that have deacons go and tap people on the shoulder if they overhear someone speaking in a little bit of tongues as praise or intercession they stop them because they felt like that if their if that got too loud it was going to require an interpretation for it to be an order I want to tell you something that's chilling to see someone stop somebody that's chillin you better know that you're right and you better know you got the whole Bible backing you up and not a quote when you stop somebody like that because I want you to know there is a place we get in him we can't help ourselves hmm that next morning 1975 that next morning after being in the spirit all night long waking up all hours of the night speaking in tongues my backslidden granddaddy laid in the bed next to me over there on a twin bed two twin beds because he told my granny that night I better stay in there with Steve because I just never seen a case like this I woke up all hours of the night Vicki in tongues when I finally woke up the next morning they called me to breakfast I mean breakfast honey not cereal breakfast table steaming with breakfast and they went to ask me do you want milk or orange juice and I went to say orange juice I think and it was in another language and it was a long time that would happen to me at the most inconvenient moments when someone would ask a question and I would not think of my mom answer and go to say it and it would come out something else my granddaddy I can see him right now he put his hand on the table and he said I've never seen nothing like this but I'd be afraid to come against it that was his attitude that ought to be our attitude now I want to give you this verse in clothes oh my don't want to but it's late I know that give you one verse here Psalm 51 more solemn and we're doing 50 and verse 23 who so offereth praise glorifies me and to him that order if his conversational right will I show the salvation of God your words matter your conversation matters we believe we're living in the Hebrew year of the pay which is the mouth we have emphasis on what comes out of our mouth in this season and let us say from now on until rapture we're watching our conversation we must we've got to watch our words pray like he prayed put a watch over my heart a stay on my lips a seal on my lips that I may not sin against thee because you can get the hair right and the dress right and where to go and where not to go right and this thing right here come on how do you know because I know how it has been used in my life the psalmist said whoso offereth praise glorifies me the nature and get this please the nature of praise is an offering it is an offering this is not my idea this is the Bible concept whoso offereth praise that word offering is a Hebrew words of och it means a slaughter or excuse me a slaughter for sacrifice I'm not making that up it come right out of the lexicon Hebrew word 20 776 Strong's Concordance slaughter for sacrifice whoso slaughter a--the for sacrifice praise glorifies me got it you're praised according to this verse is a slaughtered sacrifice it is as though you have cut the throat of a lamb not just any lamb the best lamb you had to offer are you with me you give me five minutes of grace here Abel you've heard the Prophet tale with a jagged rock with a grapevine around his neck let his little lamb - the author Cain comes with a basket of turnips vegetables out of the garden the fruit of his hand Abel brings another offering he brings a lamb not just any lamb hear me his favorite lamb his pet lamb Abel raised this lamb loved this lamb but it was time to give God praise an altruist being built come on there was no Bible to read all they knew was the story that Adam her father had told them about how God Himself came down right in the Bible I served God all those years and never even knew that was in the Bible God came down and took animal skins and made Adam and Eve clothes to cover their nakedness he's right there in the book they knew this but King heard it but he didn't get it but Abel got a revelation when the altar was built and it was time to give God praise Cain brought brought his fruit turnips but Abel brought his a lamb grapevine around his neck dragging him over to the altar he sits down lays that little lamb in his lap picks up a jagged stone and starts hacking away at the jugular vein of that little lamb until it's blood you know what happens his blood is spurting with every beat of its heart and those heartbeats are getting slower and they're doing less but the blood continues to flow out of that vein until that little white lamb was bathed in red blood and guess what children so is Abel so was able able himself covered in the blood of his little offering don't you know God was pointing to Calvary come on when that when the purpose of that blood was not to drain into the ground it was to provide a way that the life of that blood could fall all over you so that when God looked down and saw Abel he saw him covered in the blood of his offering I need you to know an offering of praise will cost you something because it won't be based always on abundance it'll be based on love he loved that lamb but he loved God more Abraham loved Isaac but he loved God more he was willing to lay as Isaac on the altar to kill his promise because he loved God more and I want you to see this Cain is standing over there maybe kneeling over there by an altar and he's still trying to figure out what he missed because God came and was pleased with Abel's offering but the offering of Cain caused God to be Roth it stirred the wrath of God in his heart because King found out that day you can't get blood out of a turnip God was looking for blood not that he is bloodthirsty but he has a plan he had already created blood that would bring redemption to mankind come on now that was his offering an offering is going to cost you something whoso offereth praise and I will tell you one more time that's not a word that means reaching a pocketful of coins and take out a couple and give them to God that's not the word here the word is slaughter for sacrifice that's what your praise is because you're not praising him every time out of abundance or because everything's going good or because you feel like you always hears your prayer you're gonna have to be like David you ever read their other half of the deep calls to the deep at the noise of that waterspouts you ever read the rest of that phrase that's not the goodness of God that was washing over David that was the stress and pressure and heartache and persecutions of life all this stuff has washed over me until I have almost lost my my place but I'm going to give God what's his this is Davis at heart I'm gonna give him what's his I'm gonna praise him if he washes me down this mountain because there's a deep in here there's something in there that responds to God and it doesn't respond based on feeling lest and not on feeling none of what I have none of what I don't have it responds based on God's faithfulness I want to ask you has he been faithful in your life I'm not going to ask you if you've always been faithful to him because I I know the answer to that your answer is like mine no I've not always been faithful to him but I can say with sister Jaya that he has always been faithful to me and he deserves my praise
