TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but I do have to take on the mindset of Christ where I am pouring out my life for my fellow man for my brother my sister you see he started out as God he condescended into the form of a human Lucifer was trying to make an ascension before he ever made the descent it is necessary before we ever make our ascent our climb that we have to make the descent we have to come down we have to humble ourselves even as Jesus did this is not just about one man who descended first and emptied himself and he took on himself the form of a man and went to a cross to pour out his blood I don't have to do the pouring out my blood part but I do have to take on the mindset of Christ where I am pouring out my life for my fellow man for my brother my sister we are going to end up having to get dirty because not every person who is elected predestinated looks like you and me today there may be people who are under the bridge in Columbus Georgia I do not know they may be again in front of a toilet getting rid of the nastiness they put in their body last night it's hard to tell where they are but they are not in the same position that we are therefore I'm preaching to us today because I believe that it is necessary for us to recognize who we are that we do not have to be afraid to put ourselves in the mindset of Jesus Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God because he was put on the earth to save those that were lost
