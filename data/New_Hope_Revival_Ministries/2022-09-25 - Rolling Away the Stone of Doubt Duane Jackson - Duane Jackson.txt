thinking well they're just really trying to work it up this morning aren't they no we're trying to push you past your tiredness we're trying to remind you that you're not the only one tired what about the people up here on this platform you they think there's any tiredness up here you think brother Dwayne and sis and sister are tired they didn't sleep much last night had a hard time getting ready with a little baby brand new baby you think they're tired you think anybody up the sound booth is tired I would ask you to raise your hand if you're tired but I don't think that would do a thing for us [Music] buy us would it but I don't come let me tell you something I had to get help almost I had to turn on my hip to get out of bed in the middle of the night to get to the bathroom because I jumped around a little bit last night and woke my sciatic nerve up and when I was able to get dressed and get in the vehicle to come this morning I said to the kids I jumped around last night until I'm hurting but I'm going to church to jump some more can I ask you from the bottom of my heart from With all sincerity what else is there what else is there but to worship Him but to live for him but to give him everything we're a blessed people and we have received of the Lord and from the Lord for so long the least that we can do is give him something I'm not talking about lip service I'm talking about a life that says you mean more to me than my feeling you mean more to me than my tiredness than my sore back or brother Dwayne had a real pain in his back last night after ministering to us and we just push through we've had congestion I've had congestion two weeks and I know some of you have and lay down at night and you're drip and drip and drip and drip and drip but what do we do we can't stop We Can't Stop not in the middle of what God is doing for us I want to tell you where we are this morning I want to tell you where we are I'm going to take just a few minutes this is my special song and I said to the Lord when he woke me up this morning he woke me up to the sound of the shofar and I've had several experiences with the Lord since Sunday night excuse me since Tuesday night at the end of the service we just spoke for about 10-15 minutes to the church about keeping our standard as high as possible because the world is looking not only is Holy Ghost looking in Jesus but but the world is looking and we can't afford to lose our standard now we've got to hold on to Holiness with everything that we've got because the world is looking and that's why that's why we're called to this it's not our salvation our Salvation is by grace and purchased by the blood but two times since then not including last night but two times in the night had such a powerful confirmation from the Lord that we're being lifted in the spirit to a higher place and it's worth every effort it's worth the extra push to be lifted up into something fresh their their spiritual of blessings and experiences in him in New Dimensions in the spirit that we have never experienced in our lives before and we want everything he has for us because we don't believe it's just for a Feeling we believe it's for change I want to read you a verse of scripture because there are people from time to time who get offended or put out by a lot of things we do around here and one of them is because we mentioned the biblical feast and a lot of people get out of that they don't like that and they think that's Jewish and they think that's not according to the message and brother Branham didn't talk about those things I beg your pardon he did when the Sun goes down tonight we're we're at Yom trois and it is the Feast of trumpets does anybody believe he ever spoke about the Feast of trumpets he did anybody ever believe he spoke about Passover Pentecost anybody ever hear him preach about Tabernacles I have and when I woke up this morning I heard the clear sound of a shofar followed by the clear sound of a silver trumpet and I knew the difference in the sound because they have a distinction in their sound you've heard that Illustrated for us here in First Corinthians chapter 15 I want to show you the significance it is the it is the blasting it's the Awakening blast picture said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed stay right with me in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the that's Yom trois the last Trump when the Bible said the first Trump he's referring to shevolt Pentecost because the Bible said that when he appeared on top of Mount Sinai in giving the law and instruction to Moses there was the sound of a trumpet and the scripture refers to it later as the first Trump and then it talks about here last Trump and the Hebrews know that the last Trump is the resurrection Trump it's the one that calls the elect to rise up it's called The Awakening blast so when the Sun goes down tonight we are remembering one more year these are rehearsals these feasts are rehearsals and we don't keep the feast and we don't make nearly as much about it now as we have in the past because we feel like a lot of people have maybe got it and some have gotten over it but we feel like there are times that the spirit says Market and I believe he said to me this morning Mark this put it down make sure you remember what you're what what you're Where You Are said in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall whoop we shall what we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on help me now and this Mortal must put on immortality [Music] and brother Branham said in the Rapture message you mind can I take a minute I'm going to I have to because I told the Lord if no one else come forward with a song this morning that I would take this I would obey him I wrestled with him when he woke me up brother Adam said now it's the first thing is the sounding the first thing is a trumpet and or a voice a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet he got the order right as he continued shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice and if you think brother Branham is identifying his own human voice you're wrong because he was only an echo he was only a mouthpiece as brother preached to us last night he was only an amplification of The bridegroom's Voice but in case you get a little out of balance here he identifies the voice he said it's the same voice that loud voice in Saint John 11 38 through 44. that called Lazarus from the grave Lazarus come forth [Music] one of these days bride [Music] thank you [Music] oh my God one day the last Trump [Music] now that nothing I've said so far should get me in trouble but if I told you we don't know the day or the hour but we know the season it won't be in the spring won't be at Christmas time God keeps his word he keeps his pattern he died at Pentecost at Passover he died at Passover he became the Passover Lamb come on now that spring Feast we're coming now to this to the month when the Sun goes down we change months tonight we get the new moon in the new month and when we do we're going into a month of really focusing and concentrating on the things of God because in a few days we go into the days of all and we end this time of repentance before the Lord like like we had last night didn't you feel him as he came to say Amen to the preaching of the word and we just said Tunis Lord I don't want to be a nut here but it's almost like I could just feel the Lord tightening his people up just tightening us up well how do you know we didn't need to loosen us up well that's true some folks need to be loosened a little bit but I felt him tightening Me Up Just these these feet are dress rehearsals of what God has done and what he will do so we know the season we know that we are literally once again 2022 now we are entering into the season that one day [Music] this scripture will have fulfillment how do you know because God doesn't break the order of his word so one one fall as these things the reason why we don't know the day or the hour is because the calendar is off so we don't know exactly the day or the hour but we know the season whoa when we can start wearing jackets again we know we're entering into the season now let me stop no more commentary let me get this read so I can get out of the way I know people cringe when the pastor gets up like this in special meetings in it but I have to obey I I have to stay in good terms with my boss [Music] because he's going to talk to me tomorrow and I got to hear him tomorrow and the next day and the next day I can't afford to offend him how many of you feel that way I can't offend the Lord because I'm going to need him I'm gonna need him paragraph 153 he said now the third the first thing excuse me now the third thing well I didn't finish reading that did I did it yeah yeah no not quite did I that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead Sea to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next is what it was a trumpet a voice a shout a voice a trumpet shout to get the right biblical order shout voice trumpet let's say that shout voice trumpet he descends in a shout then the voice of the Archangel which is the voice that wakes the bride and then the trumpet that catches her let me read it he said now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets tonight it's sundown to the best of our ability on the calendar it's the beginning of the Feast of trumpets one of these days you won't have to hear this speech one season like this you won't have to hear this quote again you know why you'll be right smack dab in the middle of it he said that the trumpet which always the waste of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and they'll be the bride's supper the Lambs supper with the bride in the sky see does that excite anybody you people that strutted your stuff around here Friday night and acted like you were so glad to be dressed up honey that wasn't anything to compare with the feast I'm going to the marriage supper of the Lamb he said the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together we've had that the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride we're having that now we're having that now [Music] it's not just a physical death he's talking about back in the other ages he's talking about a physical death they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky he said why why that's the thing that takes place friends he said we're right here ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen [Music] while many have been ripening some have been rotting but the bride is ripening come on now Pentecostal seed is rotting denominational seed is rotting the message denominational seed is rotting but the broad seed is ripening in this hour the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned the stalks but the grain will be gathered into its Garner if you believe that same man now in the message the Feast of the trumpets quick very quick he said now as soon as this church the bride is drawn together she is taken up and that mystery of the seventh seal or the seventh seal the mystery of going and the Jews listen and the Jews is called by The Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets Elijah and Moses and they come back seventh is last that seventh trumpet will also be the last Trump what brother Branham is telling us here it's the same trumpet that caused the bride out of the grave in the resurrection it's the same trumpet that caused the two witnesses on the scene he says it he said which is the two prophets Elijah and Moses and they come back now in another quote in the same message Feast of trumpets I'm hurrying he said in between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet there is a prophet to appear before the Gentiles to call the people back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine that's happened [Music] now if that's happened where are we we're between the sixth and the seventh trumpet foreign [Music] caught between those trumpets because what the seals are to the Gentile bride the trumpets are to the Jewish elect he said isn't that right so we're caught in there somewhere he said Just Between the six and the Seven Trumpets the prophet to appear before the Gentiles to call the people back to the original Pentecostal Doctrine and then he goes on to say and the two witnesses of Revelation 11 appear to the Jews same timing to send them to Jesus while the church is being taken up all of them prophets amen the word of the Lord cannot be broken it won't be a denomination do you see it are you with me I got one more for you that are sleeping wake up if you've got a neighbor that's sleeping pinch them now when the gospel returning this is the revelation of Jesus Christ he said now when is the gospel returning to the Jews when the day of the Gentile is finished the gospel is ready to go to the Jews he said oh I if I could just foretell you a little something that's fixing to happen right here see right in this day you see it's fixing to happen we get it in the church age and this great thing is fixing to happen it'll carry over to Revelation 11 and pick up those two prophets Elijah and the Moses returning back for the Jews we're ready for it everything is setting in order just ready this Gentile message as the Jews listen as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles the Gentiles this is where we are hear me now hear me this is important to know where we are as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles read the next line that's where we are that's where we're living right now just any minute at any time the Gentiles will take this message to the Jews I'm just telling you what he said and how will we know that it has happened and the rapture will come that means there will be no Rapture until Gentiles have taken the gospel back to the Jews again powerful [Music] powerful powerful I'm looking for that I'm planning to be a part of that I don't know how but I'm planning to be involved in that I want you to know where we're living we're between the sixth and the seventh trumpet there's about to be a blast that's going to call the bride out of the earth a bride that's already gone on and it's going to wake up the bride that's here we're caught up together to meet the Lord in the air and the same trumpet that causes the Rapture to unfold in the seven seal to complete is the same trumpet that calls those two witnesses on the scene and they have a Ministry to the Jewish elect in Jerusalem we're at the end time you either look at me like you don't have a clue we're at the end time we're there so let him tune you let him tune you I want you to stand we're getting ready to hear the word brother Greeley is coming it's 12 10. oh he's still got an hour and 50 minutes plus I don't usually stop till two and then we

good to be in his house yes he is I felt him when I walked through the door this morning I felt his presence when I walked through that door this morning Satan was trying to come at us and do all sorts of things to discourage us he's a bluff he's a bluff he does not want you to enter in to his presence he will do anything and everything and he'll use anybody to try to keep you out of his presence you know last last night I shared with you a little a quote and I didn't have it written down and I don't like to to share things if I can't tell you exactly where I where I got it from um and I'll try not to keep you standing too long but I mentioned to you about being in the presence of God what brother Branham had said and and uh so I had to go back um uh last night when we got back to the room and and find it because I didn't want to just leave it um halfway done and it was in 1961 in the message of God be with us then where is all the Miracles brother Brownell makes this statement he says how can you stand in the face of wind without having wind blowing how can you get in water without being wet water is wet that's not a big Revelation right but water is wet that's the chemical of it it's wet and when you get in water you're going to get wet right but the next quote and when you get in the presence of God the supernatural there is going to be Supernatural signs and Supernatural workings of a supernatural God I believe that we are in the presence of a supernatural God this morning and all we have to do is get our doubt out of the way and he can work he can perform because that's what happens when God shows up Miracles take place we're in the presence of a miracle-working god this morning if we can get ourself out of the way he wants to work he wants to perform it's what he does it's nothing major to him brother Steve that's what he does he works miracles he does the Supernatural and we are in the presence this morning of a supernatural God I believe it with all my heart have your seats for just a few minutes if you if you would and um I tell you I love coming here brother Steve because I feel just a liberty I I feel I feel like I'm not uh constrained by by time I even took my watch off I set my watch over there so it won't keep reminding me of if I move my arm I have a habit of looking down to see what time it is and so I put the watch over there and um I believe you've come to worship I've come to hear from him I need to hear from him this morning I do want to say before I uh before I forget and get too far um into talking this morning that we certainly I want to thank brother Steve sister Stacy for for hosting us this weekend and and inviting us to be a part of the the meeting and I tell you it's truly an honor an honor and a privilege uh to be with you and to be a part of what God is is doing here and um you know we there's a there's a connection that we have I don't know how many were here um in February of 2021 uh when brother Steve had invited me to come and speak the first time that I spoke here um and at the end of the service if you were here you may or may not remember a brother Steve um felt led to have a prayer and um he he prayed and in his prayer he was praying for me and sister Heather and um he so eloquently described different things that was that was going on and and and he had recognized um our desire to see other people blessed you know and even whenever we were going through a time it seemed like a dry spell for us but we were able to enter into Thanksgiving for someone else whenever when they were blessed and that is that is really a secret to a lot of things if you can ever you see some you see your brother or your sister blessed and you can enter in to that and be thankful for their blessing then you position yourself in a place that God can then come and bless you as well well through through the prayer he he prayed and and um you know there was there were things that were were trying to be put into motion um that where we were trying to to discuss things with doctors and and to to find out if there were other other avenues other ways we could approach to uh to see if the Lord would bless us uh with the biological child and even though they had told us time and time again it won't happen we still had faith we still believed that even through medicine I believe that God can work through medicine he has done it I've seen him do it and at the end of the at the end of your prayer do you remember what song you sing you don't well I do because I listen to the prayer again last night as we were that's one of the little things that when the Lord speaks to us and and he gives us words of encouragement Heather's been able to she would capture those and save them and throughout throughout the years we'd had different people would give us words of encouragement and if you could save it and you go back and you listen to those things and it helps to build your faith whenever you're in a low spot you go back and you listen to those things you're like hey God was talking to me right that night while I was there he was speaking to me I want to listen to his words again and God was speaking through brother Steve and and you all joined in prayer and and we have a manifestation of that Faith with us this morning in Little Liam [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh God how I love you Lord thank you Lord for your manifestation Hallelujah [Music] he is so wonderful so wonderful at the end of the prayer brother Steve sang a song as we were dismissed that evening you sang a song it is well with My Soul and if y'all would I'd like for us to sing that song together this morning as as we get ready to enter into the word I don't know what key y'all singing in whatever you play it in we'll we'll sing it in but um I'm not singing it for you now I'm asking you to join in with me and sing if it's not well with your soul at this point don't leave this service this morning [Music] because he is here he is the same Jesus that walked over 2 000 years ago is here present Among Us this morning the same presence that Peter felt we have the privilege of feeling this morning the same Jesus that met Paul on the road to Damascus has come by here this morning to speak to me it's got to be personal you can't just sit there and say oh yeah he came and he came to talk to this person or that Pitchfork religion you know brother Stevie said oh that's for the so-and-so and oh that's for so and so you know no it's for me is for me he come to talk to me this morning would you join in song with me the song You Can't Sing sitting down I I sang in too many choirs and choruses throughout my younger years um had the privilege of singing in the North Carolina honors choir and the North Carolina All State Choir and the first thing that our instructor would tell us you got to stand up you can't sing sitting down because you can't get enough volume and this song requires volume you've got to lift it up to him you've got to lift this song up and really mean it and and what draws me to this song Oh I moved I got the wrong one pulled up that is not the right song Here We Go the third or fourth verse in this song and we'll sing it the fourth verse says Lord haste the day [Music] haste the day when my faith shall be sight this song was sung February of 2021 and things weren't in motion Heather wasn't pregnant we didn't know if she was going to be able to be pregnant but this song was sung and in the song it says Lord haste the day that my faith shall be sight and I believe that there's many of you that's been believing for certain things and it seems like it's been delayed but a delay is not a denial I heard brother Steve say that many years ago a delay is not a denial so what do we do we stand in faith believing and we say Lord I'm going to stand here until I see the Fulfillment of a promise that you gave I'm not standing on my own I'm standing on your word and I'm believing your word this morning Lord because you said it I can have faith in what you said not in my own thoughts not in my own thinking but I can have faith this morning I can have faith this morning and I can trust I can trust I can stand with you and believe for the need that you have because I have watched him perform in my life it took a few years they weren't always easy and it's not always easy while you're waiting but be patient in waiting don't grow weary in the waiting just keep holding on to his promise amen who in peace [Music] my way with

away all of our judgments you have allowed us the Lord to be free you've brought us Liberty this morning and we're thankful for it Lord Jesus thank you Lord father we just love you Lord help us Lord to get out of the way this morning that you might come and speak through your word the things that you would have said it's in thy precious name that we pray and we ask these blessings Jesus name hallelujah hallelujah praise your Wonderful Name Lord oh my mama how truly wonderful he is thank you to the Musicians this morning we certainly appreciate your labor oh [Applause] thank you so much thank you so much I gotta get out of this got to get out of that this morning oh my mama don't forgive me I get a little bit excited sometimes when I think about what he's done for me why wouldn't I get excited why would I want to be quiet why would I not want to shout about it why would I not want to tell somebody about the goodness of my God [Applause] I don't want to hide what God has done for me I'd be wrong for hiding it right I would be wrong to hide and not give him thanks to give him praise for what he has done for me but brother Steve already read part of my scripture this morning so um I'll just pick up where you left off I suppose um we haven't talked except for a little bit sitting around the the dinner table but um I love it when God comes down and confirms things the Sister Mariah she she sang the song last night I had no clue she was going to sing what she sung I'm told that that was the first time that that she had sung that song here and um talking about your cries Awakening the master well that's in the message this morning too so wow I tell you the Lord just the Lord has a special way of doing what he wants to do when we will allow him to do it if we would just allow him to come in and have his perfect will that's right I don't I don't want his permissive will I'm not I'm not satisfied with that now there are some blessings even within his permissive will but I want the fullness of the blessings I want complete blessings I want to yield myself to a place that I can be found in his perfect will this morning amen you know there's a um in 1961 um I think on the notes that I gave sister charity I I said 1964 and I didn't feel right about that I went back and looked at it this morning and it was 1961. um brother Bradham uh makes a statement now this is going to be an uh it'll sound like an odd service in the beginning but I hope you'll allow me um this uh by Folly if you want to call it that um I know this is not Easter but listen to what brother Branham said I want to I want to give you a little Easter story this morning and brother Brown said the message the greatest news flash in history but we allow Easter to One Day in the year that's our Easter One Day in the year is an Easter then he says every day in the year is or ought to be an Easter every day should be a thrill day of the Resurrection [Applause] that's what we've come to celebrate this morning is his resurrection every day should be an Easter I would ask you to turn with me in the Book of John this morning chapter 11. that you've already read from I'd like to start with verse 14. and 15 and then we're going to skip down to verses 38 through 40. and now you understand why I say brother Steve already started my message for me this morning and we're just going to carry on there's only one Holy Spirit only one Holy Spirit and as we said last night if we're tuned to the same thing we're going to be saying the same thing if I can get close enough to him there's going to be something that resonates through me this morning I believe that same Holy Spirit came down and was near brother Steve and it got near me and we're both saying the same thing you know why because we come from the same person we come from the same person of Jesus Christ we have that same representation dwelling inside of us John chapter 11 verse 14 reads like this then Jesus said unto them plainly he's talking to this to the disciples that's with him Lazarus is dead verse 15 and I'm Excuse me and I'm glad for your sakes that I wasn't there I'm glad that I was not there to the intent there's a reason that he was glad he was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him it was almost like he was getting a little flustered with him all right I mean let's let's go you're going to keep bugging me all right let's go to him let's move down to verse 38 through 40 if you would Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it right right Jesus said take ye away the stone why didn't Jesus just move the stone but it was something that they had to do something that they had to do he says y'all go get that stone moved out the way yeah take the stone out of the way Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord um by this time he stinks he's thinking yeah for he hath been dead four days Jesus said saith unto her said not I said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should have see the glory of God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word this morning you may have your seats we look on the scene don't forgive me that um that singing I don't like to sing halfway I don't like to do anything halfway if I'm going to give give something to the Lord I want to give him everything I got I want to enter in with everything that I have because that's what he did for me as we look on the scene this morning this little Easter Story um it opens up with with Jesus being told about his friend a dear friend that he loved dearly and they come to Jesus and they're like hey your friend Lazarus and he's sick he's he's sick he really needs you and Jesus is like all right I guess he's sick well let's just go this way and I'm sure they're all looking at him like wait a minute now this is like one of your really close friends and he has asked for you I mean he's asked specifically that you would come right because Lazarus has a need and Jesus said he just kind of brushed It Off he's like yeah he's he's not sick unto death you know he he's going to be all right you know and I don't find any other place where they where somebody comes back to him and says he is dead but Jesus himself said he's just he's not sick unto death because he saw beyond what they were seeing you know he sees beyond what you're seeing this morning too you know uh but they they came to him and and they're like they've really tried to encourage encourage them they wanted him to to hurry to come see their friend there was an urgency that they were trying to express to him because in their mind hey he's about to die if you if we can't get him in front of Jesus or Jesus in front of him he's going to die and they they were trying to plead with Jesus hey we really want you to come he's he's almost dead if you could come we know that if you get in his presence and he's in your presence that Miracles can take place because they had seen the Miracles take place they knew that all it took was one touch from the Master's Hand one time to him going in there and just speaking to Lazarus and Lazarus would have been made whole right but he told him he said it was you know we read what he said while ago it was for an intent there was a purpose he delayed his coming for a purpose now he did not explain himself when he delayed his coming he don't you don't always get a written explanation of why you're still waiting I didn't get a written explanation 16 years ago that said if you'll wait 16 years in two months then then I'll I'll minister to you and I'll take care of you and we'll I'll fulfill the promise no I didn't get that I got a promise though it was up to me to hold on to the promise even though I couldn't see the Fulfillment of it there was doubt that was blocking me I couldn't see beyond the doubt he can he sees beyond the stone that was laid in front of Lazarus tomb you know all they could see is that rock whenever that there was a rock laid in front of him Jesus didn't see the rock because he was The Rock he didn't pay attention to that because he was seeing what was fulfilled already on the other side of that rock he's like he ain't dead he sleeps he sleeps don't let me get too far ahead of myself this morning he he um Jesus tries to explain some things to the disciples and um you know I guess they're they're kind of talking to them I'm sure they were kind of confused too they're probably thinking you know I don't understand why why aren't we going to go try to help Lazarus out you know I mean this is this is your really close friend Jesus we we really should go and and he tries to tell him he's like he's he's just sleeping he's just sleeping you know how how it is sometimes if you you know that somebody's sick and you called up their their home and um you know somebody answers the phone and they say you're trying to call to check on them you're concerned about somebody that's sick so you call the house and somebody else answers the phone and they're like they're Whispering you know right he's he's resting he's he's sleeping you know so when when Jesus was telling them he's resting he's sleeping the disciples kind of went oh well I guess that's fine you know it's good that he's resting we just you know let him rest wish we could be resting too you know we're being persecuted we're being chaste and we'd like to be resting too I wish that we could rest like Lazarus was resting because in their mind they're hearing him say he's sleeping so that's what they're perceiving that he's resting and they said it do it doeth them well if he's resting let him rest that's the same way we would say to somebody today don't bother them just let them know later when they wake up that I called was thinking about them just just let them rest don't want to wake them up while they're resting because they need that rest for their strength and so that's what they thought Jesus was telling them he's sleeping he's going to be all right and finally Jesus like listen y'all I got to put it plain he is dead and I'm glad for your sake that I wasn't there foreign to the intent see he had an intention of not showing up there was something that he was trying to do he was trying to get them to believe you know even though they had been around him all the time they've been around him they still were not fully believing in who he was they had not completely had a revelation of who Jesus was you know some of them that's why at one place he says you know who do men say that I am he that was a legit question he's like hey what's what's the noise around Camp what's what's people saying you know in these different cities when we go through I you know you know maybe I don't maybe he didn't hear all the things that they were saying and so he's like hey what are they saying about me what are they saying and all some say this and some say you're that and some and then finally he just stops he says but honestly I'm really not caring about what they're saying about me I was just kind of asking you that but what I really want to know is do you know who I am who do you say that I am it's got to be that personal revelation that sinks into your heart that you know who he is it's great that brother Steve knows who he is and he can preach who he is brother Wesley knows who he is that's great but do you know who he is have you had a personal experience with Jesus Christ have you had an experience on the road where he come down and he stops you in your tracks and says listen up I'm trying to talk to you I'm trying to show you who I am and that's what he was trying to do with the disciples that were with him they still did not know exactly who he was and so he was trying with his best intention he let his friend die let his friend die in hopes that this is going to be something that's going to open their eyes wasn't hope for him let me change that that wasn't a hope for Christ he did it with the intent and the knowledge that it was going to take that the Lord corrected me when I said that that wasn't that wasn't a hope of of Christ because he knew what was going to happen and he knew that was the only way that it was going to open their eyes is for that to take place it had to be something major and that was pretty major to let his own best friend die before them and he says I did it with an intent that you may believe I came across a poem um during my my studies for this message and and um I'd like to share the poem with you it says doubt sees the obstacles faith sees the way doubt sees the Blackest Night faith sees the day doubt dreads to take a step faith soars on high and listen to this part doubt questions who believes Faith answers I I believe I don't know who wrote the poem but when I came across it I'm like I gotta write that down because I love it doubt will ask you a lot of questions [Music] do you really think you can believe that but what if but has Satan never brought up the what-ifs to you you know you you think you're you're moving in the right direction you think you've got a you know you you come to church and you you get out of service and you're you're on just this this emotional High you know because the supernatural has happened God come down and he spoke to you and you walk through those doors and you get in your car and you pull out of the driveway and Satan says yeah but what if what if it don't happen that way what if it don't happen that way right what if tomorrow you wake up and your back still hurts right what if you get to the job and and they say sorry you don't have a job no more you know what if he loves to throw the what ifs I wrote I wrote it down one time the Lord I believe he gave it to me I know he gave it to me um and I had a I have I have him somewhere in one of my messages I've written it out what if w-h-a-t-i-f worry helps anxiety turn into fear there's your what if that's what if that's what Satan wants to do worry helps anxiety turn into fear because that's all he wants to do is he puts those little little doubts in your mind a little bit of worry a little bit of fear a little bit of anxiety and he just sows a little seed here and a little seed there and if he ain't careful you end up watering it and it grows up to something that's huge in front of you and then it's blocking you from seeing what God wants you to see and you can't see past it you get to a place that you just you can't see past it in 1961 in the message if God be with us then where is all the Miracles brother Branham says where is the Miracles at Among Us where are they at God was talking to this man getting him ready to go out move the clouds out the sun is always Shining that's right when doubts are gone and oh there's an and here it's a conjunction that means there's a second part that's right when doubts are gone and things are made right a lot of people forget about that part you know yeah I can believe I can believe but you haven't went and made things right with your brother you hadn't made things right with your sister that you offended and you haven't cleared things up that's right it ain't gonna work when doubts are gone and things are made right Miracles will be there just as sure as the s o n not talking about the s-u-n but assures the sun is there Jehovah Shama he is there he's always there the son by the command of God shines every day it's there because God commanded it there and as long as there is day and night the son s-u-n will hang there sure not all the time you see it because clouds has it covered up fog clouds lower high covers it up but it's always their scene and the only thing you want to do to see Miracles today how many wants to see Miracles today the only thing you want to do to see Miracles today if you want to see the miracle of God just move all your doubt away move all your Creeds away move all your denominationals away and there the sun s-o-n is automatically Shining if you can clear your doubt away the same son that was shining in Peter's Day s-u-n-n-s-o-n that same sun is shining right now the same Jesus I got it right here Hebrews 13 and 8. it's right here it reminds me right here on my tie attack tie clip not a Thai attack sorry it reminds me Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the same Sun that's shown in Elijah's day we can walk outside and we see that same Sun that's right it's still Shining the Sun that we saw yesterday or you go out this afternoon and you look look up and you see that sun that's the same Sun that's shown on Moses the same Sun that's shown on Peter and Paul and John and Matthew and all of these that we read about that same s-u-n is still shining today and I'm here to tell you that the same s-o-n is still shining today the same Jesus Christ that walked with them walks with me right now right now he's a right now God I need him right now and he will show up right now if I can get rid of the doubt if I can clear up all of the doubt and make things right then I'm a candidate for the Miracles to take place I want to see the Miracles take place I have witnessed miracles in my life I know that there's different ones of you this morning that have witnessed Miracles Divine miracles in your life that's undeniable there's no way that anybody could take that away from you because it happened to you and I've witnessed Miracles but I want more I'm selfish I'll go ahead and tell you I'm selfish when it comes to the things of God I want more I'll do whatever I've got to do to get more if it means I've got to yell and scream and use my voice till it goes away I want more if it means giving up myself I want more hmm the disciples that were that hung around Jesus I like to call them doubting disciples he had to deal with them a lot you know because so many times he would he would talk to him and and they they witnessed so many miracles and they didn't have any any trouble believing you know who he was you know while he was kind of standing there with them most of the time um but then they they didn't fully understand you know they're like oh you know some people thought he was uh he was you know a prophet you know but many of them did not have a full understanding of who Jesus was as he stood there in front of them it just you know to them it was Jesus of Nazareth you know it was Joseph's son it was you know to many of them they couldn't get past that flesh body that God was dwelling in that's all they could see that was as far as they could see but it was God himself Jesus Christ was God himself manifested in flesh you and I are supposed to be God manifested in flesh today that's what we're supposed to be we've got to get all of ourself out of the way so he can come and be manifested through us he was The Giver of Life Jesus was the he was the creator of life and they couldn't see it right they couldn't see it you know go you go back and you look at um at Mary and Martha uh as I read through the scriptures on I noticed you know in in news broadcast um today you can turn on radios and you can hear different news broadcasts you could go from Station to Station and you you hear things and it seems like they've all been given the same talking point you know because no matter where you turn to you look to it's like every one of them saying the same negative thing and they're all you know every but it's always matching most of the time you're like but did they somebody just issue something out that says all right everybody talk about this today because it seems that way but as I was looking through the Scripture it seemed like both Mary Mary and Martha had the same talking point you go back and you look at it they um they would come to him and they you know different times they would come to Jesus and they said Lord you know if you'd just been here Lazarus wouldn't be dead right you know Martha says that one time can you go find another place Mary says that to him they both had already been talking about it together and they both agreed you know what if he'd just been here right we wouldn't be dealing with this right now if he'd just if he'd just come when we asked him to come why didn't he come you know but he had a purpose for that you know their uh their way of looking at it to me the way I perceive it is they were they in effect they were telling Jesus I could have believed for his healing on this side of the Stone but now he's placed in a place that I can't see him no more he's behind a stone and I can't see him so therefore I can't believe for his healing now because he's beyond my vision that's right they were trying to put limits on him it was beyond their vision they could not see Lazarus being healed from behind that stone exactly because there was a stone and I didn't even tell you what I want to talk about this morning rolling away the stone of doubt we've got to get the stone of Doubt out got to get it out of my way but but see they they talk to him and they're like Lord you know if you'd have been here you could have done something when he was on this side of the Stone but now he's in a place that we can't see him no more and evidently since we can't see him no more you can't see him either and Jesus says hang on a second hang on a second just because you can't see beyond that stone of doubt because that's what it was it rolled a stone of doubt in front of them and all they stood there and looked at was that stone they couldn't see what was behind the stone all they saw in their life was a stone and Jesus said y'all he's just sleeping back there if you could see through my eyes You Could See Beyond that wall of doubt that wall of worry that's standing in front of you because that's what they were they were full of doubt they were full of worry they were full of fears they were full of anxiety and all they could do was stand there and look at that stone and they would just sit there and look at it yeah oh if he was just on this side of the stone there was something he could do and Jesus said don't y'all know who I am I am the way I am the truth I am the life I made that stone I made that stone I can see through that stone was it Superman they're supposed to have these powers of of looking through different things like x-ray vision God's a whole lot better than Superman he sees right through all the fear he sees right through all the doubt all the things that you put up in front of you you put up all these things that blocks you from seeing what's on the other side and and Jesus says you know what listen would y'all go get that stone out the way yeah move it and they're like yeah but surely he stinks by now it's been four days it wouldn't have been four days if you'd just been here if you'd just done what we said you to come when we called you we wouldn't be having this conversation right now you know I think sometimes we look at the scripture and we we fail to really put it in perspective of of how I mean they had emotions like we have emotions I'm sure they kind of gave him a fit I'm sure whenever he when he finally showed up they're like whoa what what in the world happened to you you know we thought that you were friends you know and he's like I don't know what the big deal is you know I don't see what the big deal is he he did he's still living you know in his mind because he saw past he saw past the stone he saw past the grave the cave that he was stuck in Jesus didn't stick him in that cave he didn't put him in there so Jesus said hey y'all get him out y'all take him out of the cave and when he came out of the cave he was still bound it was still bound who loosed him nope yeah Jesus didn't loose him from the bondage that the people around him had placed him in those people had to go loose him they're the ones that bound him up tied him up in doubt and in fear he says I didn't tie him up in that doubt good I didn't put him behind that wall you go get him out open up the door allow him to come out and now you go loosen because you bound him up Jesus didn't bind them up Jesus hadn't bound you up but sometimes we allow the people that we get around to bind us up and we feel under bonded I can't move I can't you know I I can't do because I don't know what they're going to say oh if if I let go and I and I do something I don't know what they're going to say about me and you've allowed the people around you the circumstances so-called friends you've allowed so-called friends to come down and bind you up you got to break you got to break through that and if you think Hmm the scriptures say when you stand to pray forgive forgive there may be some forgiving that needs to go on you may not have realized that the The Grudges that you've held against somebody has put them in bondage you may not even realize that the things that you have said about somebody has placed them in bondage and all they need is for you to forgive them to release them from that bondage because God didn't bind them up like that and there may be some of that healing that needs to take place you know to you can release them release somebody from the bondage that you wrap them up in so they can serve him more Lord You're the one that's giving it to me that's not in my notes Jesus had a trouble of a struggle his his struggle that he fought was to try to get the people to believe you go you go through the scriptures look through it over and over the struggle that he had was trying his best to get the people to believe him for who he is you know what struggle brother Branham had trying to get people to believe yeah I believe the the angel told him that um you know if you can get the people to believe if you can get them to believe that nothing could stand before you right not even cancer it's the same struggle that Jesus had in his day is the same struggle that we have today is just simply getting people to believe that's all you got to do take him at his word and believe it that's what he Jesus said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this yes see he was trying his best to get them to believe so Jesus Jesus finally he had to remove the doubt Before Their Eyes tells them to take away the stone because they were just going to sit there and keep looking at it you know they weren't going to do anything about it they were just going to keep complaining he's going to sit there they were comfortable in complaining and too many people today get comfortable in complaining and not doing something about it and removing some stuff out of the way so Jesus can come and and do something in their life you know the the song that says to Mariah saying your cries have awoken the master yes so I wrote a little note down it says Jesus was invited to awake w-a-k-e he was invited to awake for Lazarus so he went to awake he was invited to a funeral service he was invited to sit there and mourn but he didn't go to mourn he didn't go to awake to sit there and mourn he went to awake to wake them up to let them realize who he was if we could if we could ever get to the place that we could die to ourselves that we could mortify our flesh and invite him to our funeral you get what I'm saying if we could kill this flesh get all of our thoughts all of our ideas out of the way and we could invite him to our wake that he could come and awaken us to who he is and what he wants done what he wants us to do just invite him have a funeral service this morning and invite him to your funeral and let him come and awaken you Anew there was a there was a time that the disciples had a need to wake up Jesus but the whole time he was trying to wake them up you know they thought we're going to perish if he keeps sleeping and in his mind he was trying to awaken them to who he was so he allowed things to happen for purposes to get them to a place that he could reveal one more time this is who I am this is what I can do will you trust me will you believe me will you will you move the doubt out get the stone of doubt that you've put in front of between me and you and the blessing that I have for you get that stone out of the way and then I can perform and I can do something The Awakening of Lazarus was not only for Lazarus but it was so the stone of Doubt of who Jesus truly was could be rolled away from the eyes of the people because they needed to be awakened they needed to wake up and recognize who he was I pray that God would help us I pray he helps us to realize wake up and realize who he is before it's too late because there will come a time that it's too late it's coming time I don't want there to be not an ounce not an ounce of doubt in my life he's done so much for me the song says he's done so much for me that I I cannot tell it all there's so many times in my life I've watched him come down and perform why would I want to doubt why do I ever want to doubt what he can do for me in in Luke chapter 24 verses 14 through 31. it says and they talk together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him Their Eyes Were darkened their understanding they could not see who he was and he said unto them what y'all talking about what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered and said unto him are thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them he played dumb what things what are y'all talking about what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty see many of them that's all on all they knew him as that's all they knew him as which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trust him now the the thing about the way they trusted was they hoped for they didn't have a true faith it was just a hope for if you go back and you you read through that they they were hoping not really believing so but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done now why would they even bring up today's the third day if this guy they're talking to presumably doesn't even know what they're talking about I mean but they're they're getting into some details now and and I'm sure he's like all right come on preach on yeah preach on just keep keep preaching he says yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the Supple curve and when they found not his body they came saying they came letting us know they came telling us that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the Sepulcher and found it even so as the women they're like not sure if I should believe them or not right I'm gonna go check it out for myself it's not a bad thing go see for yourself go see for yourself because somebody make mislead You Lead You Lead You Off The Path go see for yourself and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them old fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory in other words I really I I suffered all the things that I did I went through all the things that I had to do and you still don't believe I really had to do all that and you still don't believe me verse 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh unto the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it's towards evening and the day is far Spin and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he said at the table with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were opened that's when they knew him when he broke the bread and he blessed it and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished from their sight oh that our eyes would be open today that our eyes would be open today that as we would be here in this service and as the bread breaks is being broken forth before us and he comes down to sup with us and to that we would recognize who he is this morning and no longer be constrained by doubt no longer be constrained by worry you know this ain't my notes but it just comes to me you know sometimes the things that that we will allow to worry us will be things that a doctor will tell you now we go to doctors and we trust that the Lord will lead them and guide them through the information to the knowledge that they have to the best of their abilities but my hope and my faith doesn't does not lie within a doctor and within a doctor's report because I can tell you that those doctor reports can be wrong and I've got proof of that sitting right back well sitting over here he's here in the house and he's here in the house too the one who brought that to pass is here this morning but see you'll listen to a doctor you'll go in and a doctoral they'll all you know what a doctor can do all they can do is tell you what they can see now they'll they'll check your weight they'll check your blood pressure they'll check all these different things and they document it on filing they keep it on file and the next time you go they want to check you again and they compare it against your last and each time you go and they go and they go and you know they they go and they check all these things but all they're doing they are trying to Define you by what they can see they will Define Who You Are by what they see and don't don't have x-rays done they'll do ultrasounds they'll do all these different things and and they will try to Define you as a person by the things that they can see by all these different measurements that they can check you know but that's not how God defines you we're defined by what we can't see we're supposed to look beyond the physical look Beyond what's right in front of us look beyond the Unseen and claim those things that are not seen as though they are now the doctor will tell you that you're crazy they'll say now that we we heard we've we heard this between Heather and I throughout the years now you know the doctors this is what we see this and this is uh this is what's bad for you this is what's bad for him and and this things it just won't work and you know you really shouldn't get your hopes up um I don't want to be around some Negative Nancy that's telling me don't get my hopes up start telling me don't get my hopes up I'm going to stop listening to you right quick because I serve a God that's beyond hope I serve a god of Miracles I serve a God who is faithful to the things he's promised and just because a doctor will tell you you know from what I can see and that's when you stop him and you say I don't care what you can see because I'm looking at things that's far beyond what you can see I'm looking at things that he has told me I'm looking at things that he has shown me through a vision or through a through a a word of of the Lord that comes through somebody and speaks something to you don't don't book everything and Bank everything just because a doctor says that this is what it's going to be you can throw that in the trash I don't have no time for it if it's contrary to what my God has told me if it's contrary to what his promise has given to me I don't have the time to listen to it because all that's going to do when they say oh don't get your hopes up no we're supposed to come expecting we're supposed to come with an expectation of the miraculous to show up and have have his way this morning if you if you show up with the attitude of what I'm not getting my hopes up then why did you walk through those doors why did you wake up this morning if you're not going to have an expectation of what God can do I may not be able to see it but he's told me and I will trust what he told me over what I can see every day I'll say that again I will trust what he has said about me more than I trust what I know about me because the only thing that I know about me is what this flesh tells me about me but he said otherwise his word says I can have the things that I've asked for he will give me the desires of my heart if my motive my objective is correct and I'm in line with his word and I'm not out of line with his word and I go to him with a need he's going to fulfill it it's already been fulfilled don't let doubt stand in your way get the wall of Doubt get the wall of worry out of the way let don't don't be standing there on this side of the Grave looking at and say well I don't know what he can do because I can't see what's on the other side he has already seen what's on the other side believe him and walk toward it I don't know if who it was that made a comment about if there wasn't a you know if if the Lord told me to walk through that wall and I don't see a door I'm gonna believe that as I walk toward that wall and I get there he will make a door for me if he has asked me to do that he is powerful enough to make a door for me to walk through where there is no door because he is the door and if you will walk toward him he can open up no matter what it is no matter what you have need of you walk toward him and he will open it up before you this morning oh that our eyes would be open today we we just be we become so thick-headed sometimes like the disciples were you know and they were as he called him they were slow of heart to believe they saw a miracle after Miracle after Miracle after miracle and they were still unable to fully grasp fully understand and fully trust him for who he was I this morning I want the Holy Spirit just to roll away the stone of doubt in my life no matter what it is I want it rolled away from my life our spiritual eyes they get clouded up they get clouded up by doubt they get clouded up by worry you know and that's all it kind of just blinds us because that's what's right in front of us you know the the delay is we talked about it you know oh it's been it's been two years since I asked the Lord for for this to happen it's been three years it's been four years doesn't matter he is not delineated by time he's he's not constrained it's what delineated if you don't know that term but he is not constrained by time we're creatures of time he is not don't bind him up just because you haven't seen something happen in five years or you haven't seen something happen in five months and you've been praying about it and you've been asking the Lord for a specific thing don't let that delay become a stone in front of you that's blocking you just because that's there doesn't mean that there's not Joy waiting on the other side of it because there is and if you can ever get it moved out of the way and see what he sees through his eyes he don't want you to look through your eyes this morning he wants you to look through his eyes and see what he is seeing he sees Victory he sees Freedom he sees Liberty he doesn't see fear he says I ain't giving that to you I ain't done it I did not give you fear in the message if God be with us and another spot there uh then where all the Miracles brother around says take the clouds away then what happens the sun is right there the only thing you have to do today is not oh Jesus come and heal me oh Jesus give me the Holy Ghost just take the clouds away he's already there he is already there he come 1900 years ago and he is still there he'll always be there I don't know if you know what the definition of um of Doubt is the definition of doubt one of the definitions is the lack of assurance doubt is the lack of assurance Assurance is confidence or certainty right that's what Assurance is Thomas who was one of the twelve he had a doubt problem [Music] we referred to him as doubting Thomas he wasn't with the others when Jesus first appeared to them after the resurrection you know so he had trouble believing what they were telling him right and his comment to them was unless I see in his hands the prince of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails thrust my hand into his side I ain't gonna believe it it was a doubt in Thomas he says I got to see it for myself it's not a bad thing I want to see it for myself but there's times that you just got to believe because it was said sometimes you may not see it right then you've got to believe it Jesus said unto Thomas he said Thomas because thou has seen me thou Hast believed that he says blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed you know it's good Thomas I'm glad that you got to see me in this way so that it helps you to believe but it's even more blessed even more blessed are those that haven't seen but yet they still believe the the only reason that doubt can be present is simply due to the absence of the presence of God the absence of the presence of God introduces doubt for wherever God is there is assurance wherever God is there is certainty there is confidence there is a promise wherever wherever he is he is both the promised Giver and the promised keeper he himself is the manifestation of the promise he himself is the manifestation of the promise when we misplace our confidence and place it in our own abilities our own thoughts our own understanding it shuts the door to Faith and traps us within a tomb of doubt I'm gonna I'm gonna share that with you again when we misplace our confidence and we place it in our own abilities our own thoughts our own understanding it shuts the door to Faith and traps us inside a tomb of doubt but there's one present here this morning there's one here this morning that can roll that stone away that can call you out of that tomb Proverbs 3 and 5 says trust in the Lord with part of your heart trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding you know many times we stand in uh we stand in front of a door that that leads us to a place maybe that we've never been before I was um I was at work um it's been a few weeks back and and um it's not often that the the Lord um speaks to me through uh um I would call it like a day Vision um but there are times I've been in my truck before and just be going down going down the road or stop at a red light and all of a sudden you know the Lord just shows something right in front of my eyes I mean it's just as clear as as anything else around me and I just have to I have to stop because I can tell that he's showing me something I was walking through our uh our shop a few weeks ago and as I was walking through it was it was as though a vision opened up in in front of me brother Steve and um it was as though I was watching a person standing at a door and they were debating within themselves whether they should go through that door that's all I could see I could I could see an individual it it never was clear enough for me to see who it was but there was an individual standing at a door and they were communicating back and forth with within themselves should I open the door or should I stay on this side of the door on this side of the door I can see what's around me and I know what's happening here but they were compelled to go through the door but there was fear to take a hold of the the doorknob and open the door and cross into the other side and in this Vision because that what there was a turmoil going on in their mind was I don't know exactly what's on the other side of that door but then as as a vision kept unfolding I'm walk literally walking through the shop and this is just just just showing it in in my mind and and then I hear a voice that says trust me trust me the voice was from the other side of the door now there was one voice on this side of the door saying stay where you at stay where you're at you're comfortable where you're at stay here you don't know what's on the other side but then I could hear another voice on the other side of the voice saying just trust me just trust me for where I am you will want to be and then I then I broke you know it broke out of my mind and I was like that's that's so that's so real to me it's how it's how it is so many times because we come to a place in our life and and and you're thinking you know Satan would would be happy with you becoming lackadaisical yeah yeah he would be happy with you just being complacent where you are right now and not moving further he'd be glad for you to bow down to that altar of complacency and say you know it's it's all right it's all right everything's just fine I'm at peace where I'm at right now but the Lord is calling you further and there's a door that stands between you and him and he's just saying if you would just open that door there's a voice on the other side now that doors mostly closed that one's closed now I don't know maybe all of you have have been behind that door maybe maybe there's some that's never been behind that door now I could I could sit here and I could expound to you because I've been behind that door I could tell you of things that I've seen inside that room because I have been there and maybe you've never stepped inside that door and you I could sit there and tell you different things that I've seen it out there's a desk in there there's a chair in there there's a couple other little wooden chairs in there there's different pictures that's that's posted that's on the on the Shelf in there I can I could I could expound these things to you and try to to tell you what's in there from this place that I'm standing right here because I've been there right now if I was to go over and walk through that door and stand inside that room I could be even more in detail of telling you what's on that side of the door we've had one that crossed over went beyond the Veil and that told us of things that were to come things that's on the other side and we are to trust in that voice we're to trust in that voice but see there's many people that have a fear of that did you did you know that there's people that actually have a fear of a door there's there's there's actual fear it's into phobia into phobia is a fear of doors because they walk up to a door and they they don't know there's people that literally have that fear it's a phobia that they they're they're not sure should I open the door or should I stay on this side of the door and I'm like you got to go through doors everywhere you go I would hate to have have that fear but there are people with a fear of into phobia and they will stand at the door not knowing should they go through should they stay here we don't need to stop and just stand at the door we need to open the door he is the door Christ is the door open that and walk through be a part of it if people also they suffer from um decidophobia I did I did a study a while back looking at different phobias and there's um I came across it was like over 400 different phobias that are listed desidophobia I don't know if you've ever heard that word before but many times especially on Sunday afternoons um that's something that many people suffer with decidophobia it's the fear of making a decision where are we going to go eat I'm telling you it happens in our home decidophobia where are we going to eat I don't know whatever sounds good to you I don't know whatever sounds good to you it just goes back and forth you know and people suffer from decidophobia another another term for decidophobia is decision paralysis this is a this is a legitimate phobia that people have and it will cause them to freeze up and they cannot make a decision about something in First Kings chapter 18 and 21. says and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions they were suffering from decidophobia they were suffering from a decision paralysis if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word they were still stuck in decidophobia they could not make a decision they were afraid they were going to make the wrong decision they were they were afraid there's a there's a f-o-m-o fear of missing out somebody said it fear of missing out another one is um f-o-b-o fear of better offer Ed do you know some that have the fear of a better offer yeah there ain't no better offer than what we have in Christ ain't no better offer but yeah there's some that suffer um that decidophobia and the uh phobo kind of go hand in hand because they can't make a decision because they're afraid that there's going to be something better at the next door and if I buy this then I don't have the money to buy that so I don't know if I should if I shouldn't I'll just get on both and then I'll take them home and I'll decide and I can always take something back always take something back because target takes it back here's um doubt becomes very evident that it's present among people that fear of making a decision doubting is wavering an opinion that's what doubting is doubt is synonymous with worry it's worries synonymous with fear so many today there's a stone of worry there's a stone of fear there's a stone of doubt that's blocking their path to Jesus there's some people that suffer with called xenophobia xenophobia is the fear of the unknown it causes great anxiety for some because in their own thinking here again in their own thinking their own understanding the circumstances appear uncertain the outcome is unknown this is people that deal with xenophobia there's many people spiritually deal with xenophobia they sit and dwell within their own thoughts and try to figure it all out when Christ says cast all your cares upon me just give it all over to me don't worry about it no more don't sit there and try to figure it all out just trust me believe me follow me that's all he wants you to do he says cast all your cares upon me they they claim people will claim to believe that they came to believe that scripture but do they really because their actions show different their actions don't prove that they really believe what he said to do when you try to tell them just give it to God have faith I've said that to people before just just give it to him trust him have faith you know what um many times you'll get this response you just don't understand my situation you don't understand what I'm going through brother Steve you just don't understand and if you understood you would care if you could understand where I'm at you would care you're just acting like you don't care it's just you're just brushing it off oh just give it into the hands of the Lord just give it in the hands of the Lord that's just a talking point brother Steve that's just you're just you're just saying that saying that because that way out you don't have to talk to me no more you don't have to listen to my problems no more you really don't understand and you really don't care now I'm just using that example I'm sure that's never happened with anybody here and brother Steve's never heard that before so that's happened before with me at our church and stuff like that um how can you be so unconcerned it is it is how can you be so unconcerned do you not understand the trouble I'm going through yeah I do I do and I am really concerned about you I'm concerned enough to tell you that the only one that can take care of it there's only one that can take care of it and it ain't me it's not your pastor the only one that can take care of it is Jesus Christ himself he's the only one so yes he is concerned he's concerned enough to point you in the right direction but you can sit and listen to Somebody's problems all day long and that ain't gonna do a bit of good for nobody but if you can ever leave it at his feet and really leave it there don't go back and pick it back up again that's the problem with so many people today and you know he said it's supposed to cast all your cares on him lay aside every weight don't go back and pick it up but too often we do as as as as humans we we do we're like you know I wouldn't talk to the pastor today he just didn't seem concerned at all he just said give it over to God he didn't even want to listen to me because he just to give it over to God I tried to give it over to God and I still have it with me it's because you didn't really give it over to him you picked it back up again so you could pet it this is my worry this is my worry this is this is my little pet and I'm going to keep it because this is something that I like to talk about and I like to tell everybody about this and and oh it's just it's such a it's such a horrible thing that I'm going through and it's such a and people just don't understand what I'm going through and all they do is just say give it over to God they're trying to really help you they're trying to really help you you got to give it to him you gotta leave it there take your burdens to the Lord and leave it there don't pick it back up again don't pet it brother Dan daisley used to talk about he you know if his feelings would get hurt and uh he said he said I would just I would he said I would nurse that my feelings got hurt it's my right to to they hurt my feelings I could I can remember playing his day he would stand there brother Stephen they said it was my feelings they hurt my feelings and he would just let that go on and go on and he this is he would Express this and he said finally you know you got to let that go you know you gotta you gotta get rid of that you can't just keep nursing that that heart you know the hard feelings that somebody had against you and you you come into church you come into church and you got a chip on your shoulder against somebody and you're thinking nobody else knows about it oh but they do because it changes the way you worship you got something against somebody it changes the way that you worship when you walk through those doors and you're thinking nobody else knows nothing about it I guarantee you they do it stands out like a neon sign people look at you like what is wrong with him what is wrong with them no so it you haven't got it hidden you might as well go take care of it before service starts get rid of it get that get that chip off your shoulder you know and let it go then you can come in and you can enter into his presence and the supernatural can happen because you are at freedom to worship Mercy Mercy Mercy we have to commit it to God and leave it there you've got to be persuaded in what God can do for you you must be persuaded in what he can do for you the world that we live in is full of fear it's full of doubt we get the word um our word phobia from the Greek word Phobos if I say that correctly which comes from the word and I don't know if I pronounced it right it's p-h-e-b-o-m-a-i okay well I was I was leaning on on brother Steve there I believe it's pronounced fibble mine people my means in quote to be put in fear to be put in fear that's where Phobos comes from bibomai we get our word phobia from Phobos so to me that calls into question by whom to be put in fear by whom if you're put into fear it's by someone and it ain't God I can tell you that I don't care what the situation is if you're dealing with fear it is not from him now fear as in reverence completely different word not not talking about that that's that's completely different there should be a reverence but fear in being afraid if you're dealing with fear that didn't come from him that didn't come from him you can go ahead and cast that out because he he says I I've not given you the spirit of fear so if he didn't give it to you who did where did it come from it come from the accuser of the brethren that's where it comes from that's where fear comes from it's so easy for us to listen to what Satan is trying to tell us these little little fears a little word of fear and we ignore what the word is trying to tell us I tell you this morning there is a cure for every fear that you could possibly have whether it's four of them or if you're dealing with all 400 of them I certainly pray that you're not because some of the ones that I read through was some crazy phobias that that people have but there is a cure and that cures Jesus that cure this morning is Jesus first John 4 18 says there is no fear Phobos there's no Phobos in love but perfect love casteth out all fear perfect love casteth out all fear this morning we have an empty grave that empty grave removes all doubt it removes every ounce of doubt that our Savior Lives I don't have to go and stand in front of a grave that has a stone and wonder is there something on the other side but we have an empty tomb and the empty tomb removes all doubt there is no doubt about it in my mind that My Savior Lives this morning the stone of doubt the stone of uncertainty that was there in front of them Jesus said they're not going to be able to do that they are not going to be able to remove that doubt so it wasn't a soldier that removed that stone it wasn't Mary and Martha that went and removed that stone that was hiding Jesus or hiding an empty tomb Jesus himself rolled that stone away it wasn't going to be by no man not any man here this morning that can take that that stone of Doubt away from your life but Jesus Christ himself has already done it he has already removed that stone stop looking at the cave stop looking at the grave he's not there no more he's not bound up and he doesn't want you to be bound up this morning either he wants you to be free the the stone was rolled away over 2 000 years ago and we have seen this morning the sunrise at s-o-n we have watched him rise once again and he he wants he wants to continue to rise he at my at my work I tell the guys all the time um I leave my office door open I have an open door policy you know it I'm if I'm in there and I'm working and they need to come talk to me my door's open you don't have to come and knock on the door just walk in and and talk to me I got like 20 employees and if you need to talk talk just just call me and open the door or or just walk through the door because I keep it open and I look I was thinking about that I was like he's got an open door policy to us this morning there's there's no stone there's no door standing in the way he says it's open you need anything from me this morning just come and partake come and partake come and see that I'm not there in the grave anymore I'm alive I'm well whatever you have need of I have removed all doubt because if the stone was still there today there would be doubt we we would have a reason to question whether or not he rose but the stone is gone I thought about earlier seeing maybe we'll sing it in in a minute if y'all y'all sing the song Gone the stone is rolled back well maybe we can maybe we'll sing that song um oh mama mama can I can I give you another um another word from from brother Brandon this morning y'all are such a lovely congregation to to preach to and and um and to to be with and and be worse in worship with and I don't want to take advantage of you this morning um but I tell you it's just things are the Lord just just comes and talks and and I want to just be a yielded vessel to let him let him speak but I don't want to labor you too long this morning um so so maybe let me uh if you don't mind let me read this um uh quote from Brother Randleman if you want to go ahead if the musicians want to come back that will be a cue to me to um that I can I can try to to wind down here this morning um and I don't think I don't know if I gave you this one sister charity um in 1965 the message I guess it did well praise the Lord it is the rising of the Sun well good I don't have no I want to read it anyway I want to read it but there has got to come one there has come one there has got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics many people got hung up with the mechanics years ago and that's all they wanted to stay with was just the mechanics not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs talking about your car what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job now many younger people may not know what simonize is but so they wax it up there's simonized wax they would go out and polish up the the car when there's no dime what's what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has got to be a Dynamics to make it work that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shaken to life and Rise Again it'll make you shake into life and rise again this morning too and roll away the stone it says I am he that was dead so dead till the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again I want them to recognize through my life that he is alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it he was not only the mechanics but he was the Dynamics to prove it and if you have Jesus Christ Living inside of you you're not going to be full just of mechanics but there is going to be power there's going to be a demonstration of the Dynamics of his life living through you this morning don't get hung up just on the mechanics let his life live through you to perform what he wants performed that's what he wants us to do we want he wants us to allow him to live his life through us get my life out of the way that there be a resurrection this morning of his life through mine living out what he wants to do through me and through you this morning Romans I got to say Romans 8 11. it says this y'all go ahead and stand don't go and stand he says the scripture reads but if the spirit of him now now you read there's a place that brother Branham was quoting this scripture in one of his message and brother round would say there is the problem there's his catch referring to the butt if he said there's his catch but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you dwell in me he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you the same power of the Resurrection that was in Christ Jesus dwells in us right now the same power that brought him out of the Grave dwells in me dwells in you right now to break through whatever Stone of Doubt is standing in your way whatever wall of worry that's sending in your way that same Christ Jesus dwells in me right now to Break Forth through that this morning there was there was a prayer that brother Branham prayed at the end of the service My Redeemer liveth and in that I want to close with with with uh letting you hear this he says may the people go away from here to remember this Easter forever granted Lord and may the great Powers may the great angels that rolled away the stone on Easter morning may they stand present today to roll away every stone of doubt every fear every Discord take it from the hearts of the people granted Lord that the Holy Spirit might come down in great power and have access to everyone granted through Jesus Christ's name we ask it and the church says amen that's what I want through my life this morning I want that same resurrection power to be present to roll away every stone of doubt every stone of worry every every stone of fear that Satan has placed in front of me that state that Satan has encouraged me to put in front of myself he said it in front and said no you just water that water that worry water that worry water that worry no I'm not watering that worry I'm watering the resurrection this morning there is I'm watering my faith this morning because there's one who gave me a promise that supersedes anything that's standing in front of me this morning there's a wreckster res a resurrection life that's here this morning to break away all the stones that's standing in front of you and standing in front of me and I'm so thankful that he chose me I'm so thankful that he chose to dwell inside of me this morning I just want to tell him I love him I just want to tell him thank you Lord for what you've done for me this morning amen can we do you have that song um um gone the stone is rolled back I don't know what key it's in which one see oh try um try

praise God there's nothing wrong with that amen I love the how the quote started a resurrection is not a day you know brother Branham brother Branham uses the Pagan word Easter and they keep saying it it's it's it's it's we use it as a day but he ever but he said every day of the year ought to be a we say Resurrection whoa Hallelujah praise God I love the scripture that he ended with I know you think I've got a sermon coming but I don't what else could I say he said it all but that wonderful scripture that he ended with if but if the spirit of him that raised Jesus up from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal body Hallelujah and I don't think you have to wait till your graveyard dead to have your mortal body quickened it just means Made Alive somebody said oh you're just going on feelings well doesn't everybody doesn't everybody kind of go by feelings there's nothing wrong with feeling his wonderful quickening presence if you can get caught up in something brother Dwayne you know a lot of songs and singers and did you ever know the pains you ever remember hearing the pains uh he's still preaching and pastors of church I actually met him a couple of times but they sang a song that the conservative Pentecostals didn't quite know what to do with it says I'm a I'm a Jesus fan and they thought well that's a little you know but you know what people get excited I I could almost I used to could say the words by all the verses you know but I I can't quite get it I can't quite get the verses or I'd give you a little bit of the word I drove a little further and uh a crowd caught my my eye or something like that and they they were having a rock and roll party or something and he he said well I I they said man you're not with it we're just rock music fans listen to these words he said I was driving home one Friday when a commotion commotion caught my ear in a field a crowd was gathered I could hear them yell and cheer tell me why are you excited I ask a certain man he said there ain't no better reason I'm a football fan and I drove a little further and I saw another crowd they were dancing they were swaying I heard music playing loud I asked again why get excited I just don't understand someone said man you're not with it we're just rock music fans I went to church that Sunday and I heard the preacher say uh Jesus gave his life to save us and he's coming back someday I started getting happy how I shouted how I cried and then someone said don't get excited but this was my reply I'm a Jesus fan I'm a Jesus fan when I think about his Mercy I just got to lift my hands so if you hear me shouting you'll have to understand I can't help but get excited I'm a Jesus man whoa tell you what that's what I am this morning I'm a Jesus fan [Applause] oh Hallelujah I can't help but get a little bit excited captured my attention enthralled me I'm caught up in who he is now I want to give it where what do you got what have you got for one song have you got one worship here we I just I'm I'm tired I'll be honest with you I'm ready to go but I think we ought to sing one more I think we ought to we ought to

blessed let's give God praise for brother Dwayne my [Music] [Applause] preaching has been amazing and wonderful but that pre-service there before he started preaching singing It is Well when my soul and him holding that baby and I felt like I was living in the Bible this felt like I was caught up in something biblical you know that was what they said to one another in the in the beginnings of the latter rain Revival they began to go around to one another and they'd say Bible days are here again instead of saying God bless you brother it's good to see you they'd say Bible days are here again Bible days are here again brother random said if that vine ever puts forth another branch there'll be another book of Acts written after that I believe it it'll have to be exactly like the original one on the day of Pentecost and that'll give us reason to say we could say it now what we've seen God do and how he is delivered and moved we could say it without any doubt Bible days are here again oh I'm so glad they never left God had a people didn't he come on CE I was [Music] my eyes [Music] Within me [Music] under Neath [Music] [Music] everybody [Music] lose [Music] you see here [Music]

praise the King one time praise Hallelujah to the lamb praise the Lord you folks can slip back to your seat thank you for coming to worship he is worthy We Believe of you as you have said under the word today God is Minister to your need you may leave this place and find out that he's healed you you may go home to bring your lunch and find out something some burden you were carrying when you came is no longer on your shoulder because Supernatural things happen in the presence of that Supernatural God and when his word was going forth today perhaps something took place in you in that moment you didn't even know what was happening how has anybody ever had that happen to them I have healed with no prayer nobody praying just get in the right atmosphere all wonderful things can happen I don't normally say this because he's my son and but I want to tell you as a pastor how thankful I am a dad I'm very very proud but as a pastor I want to tell you how thankful I am for a worship leader who works up a sweat I mean that I mean that it's not it's not in the sweat that's not what I'm talking about but I I've been so many times in churches that had uh brought me in to bring Revival and then they would put that six foot icicle in the Pulpit to lead the worship no atmosphere created at all not to mention that everything was so Antiquated nobody likes old hymns any more than I do I don't mind hymns but they ought to be sung with an anointing you ought to at least have somebody act like they have some slight knowledge of what they're singing about and uh when Benjamin started leading worship he he got carried away and from the beginning and some people didn't like it and and uh but but somehow he has survived it and I wanted to just say to him I don't often say it to him publicly or about him but I want to say how thankful I am that he can create an atmosphere as a preacher to to come up behind that is a great blessing and we do have the the best we have the best musicians we are so blessed sister Laurel Sister Mary Beth sister West when she's here and we have others that are coming along that are going to be able to do very well on the piano when it's the time for them to be there and we've got these brothers on the guitars and Zach on the drums and and we're just blessed we're just blessed we got cameraman some of them don't look like they're old enough to to run cameras but they do and they do it with a good good job they do a good job at it and they do it because sometimes volunteers are few and hard to come by but they're willing and uh why Joseph up there he can run the whole thing he can run the stream and he can do a lot of it and we're just blessed I don't want to call names sister Laurel is not only a great musician but she is also an amazing dessert maker and she has made all the desserts that you have enjoyed this weekend you know somebody says well I'll bring I'll bring a pie and she says well I'll bring a hundred pies and 100 cheesecakes while I'm at it you know and we appreciate that and so many have brought and and fed and guess what in just a few days we get to do this again because camp meeting starts October the 11th Tuesday Wednesday Thursday I know this wasn't the time to mention it was it when you're already so tired Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and all day Sunday and we're going to have fellowship and we're going to have a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord at tabernacle's time I believe God's going to minister and he's going to meet needs would you stand One Last Time on our 2022 youth weekend every person who did something to help us thank you and we have kept sister Jennifer busy cleaning up after us and making it nice so that we could come back in here and we appreciate that so very much to the tent pictures the ones who put the tents up and ran the lights and it just goes on and on and on there's no way that one family or even two families could put everything together it takes a great number of people who are willing we're blessed to have workers and not not nearly as many grumblers as we have workers sometimes we Grumble while we're working but we get it done we get it done we're just so so blessed thank you brother Dwayne for coming and singing and preaching and blessing us so teaching us [Applause] sister Heather is super mom we're just it it just takes a lot you know I I hear people often complaining about the smallest little thing with their babies or children and I think about you know you really really ought to think about what it's like to drag them across the country to carry the gospel you know my wife was a superhero and it wasn't easy but we went and we didn't just go up the road we crossed the Nations we crossed the Atlantic time and time again with nursing babies and no it wasn't easy but what else could we do what else could we do and I appreciate them coming knowing that that Liam is a newborn and you're in a hotel and you're off schedule and I appreciate that I appreciate that they can look as good as they do and put together as they do and smile as pretty as they do knowing that they've been up and down all night long you know we're blessed to be able not to have to wait they could have said oh in about 12 months when things are all settled down we'll come but I'm thankful that they didn't do that I'm thankful for you mamas that have made the effort and I saw many having to get their babies fed during the service or taking them out or uh whatever the things you have to do that we just take for granted thank you thank you for your sacrifice we are just blessed and I I want you to know that we we know it we recognize it father we thank you most of all that you have been in every part of this weekend from the from the beginning from the planning stages to to putting everything together the gifts the talents the creativity that's represented in this house is a tribute to a living God an amazing God an amazing Papa and we want to thank you for each gift that you have placed in this body we want to thank you for every sacrifice advice made but all of that would be in vain it would just be an event had your presence not come and flooded us and minister to our needs as you have I pray that every young person is encouraged to run the race to make sure that they very often present themselves to you to be tuned and that we take our own courage to roll away the stone of doubt and may we like Shem shamgar stand and defend the promises of God until as we heard this morning Faith becomes sight until we hold them in our arms may we be able to stand courageously against every tide of the enemy believing and defending that the word of the Lord is yea and amen father pour strength into those who are weary bless our last day of Fellowship today we will gather for lunch and then the the kids will play the young people people will have fun with one another and we will talk with one another and we will be so blessed because you've given us this opportunity draw us closer to you we pray in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory and the church said to all of
