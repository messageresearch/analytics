[0:01] hell is going to March against you the
[0:03] devil's going to howl against you he's
[0:05] going to breathe accusations down your
[0:08] neck he's going to sell you half truths
[0:11] if he can spiritual warfare is not
[0:15] optional it's part of the Christian life
[0:18] but we have everything we need to defeat
[0:21] the enemy anytime anywhere no matter
[0:25] what the circumstances are we are well
[0:28] equipped by by taking God's armor his
[0:33] armor what you're putting on is not
[0:36] Romans armor it's not an armor that just
[0:38] belonged to a Roman soldier it's the
[0:40] armor of the lord lord today I'm putting
[0:43] on your armor I'm putting on the helmet
[0:47] of Yeshua the helmet of salvation I'm
[0:50] going to put on the breastplate of
[0:52] righteousness I'm going to prepare my
[0:55] feet with peace yes I'm going to take
[0:58] the sword of the spirit
[1:00] I'm going to guard my own heart my own
[1:04] garden because the enemy is always
[1:07] creeping around Desiring to seow his
[1:10] seeds of discrepancy if you're going to
[1:12] do something for
[1:16] God it's not anymore praise the Lord
[1:20] anyhow we sung that in the old church
[1:23] you know praise the Lord anyhow makes no
[1:25] difference what comes my way I'm going
[1:27] to praise the Lord anyhow m that doesn't
[1:30] sound like overcoming to me sounds kind
[1:33] of nice but it doesn't sound like an
[1:34] overcomer you see I'm not going to
[1:36] praise the Lord anyhow and give him any
[1:38] old praise Just Praise because I think
[1:41] I'm I want to give him what the
[1:42] scripture calls
[1:44] High that's Warfare praise that's
[1:48] actually what the word tells us it's
[1:49] Warfare praise it's praise that pushes
[1:53] back the
[1:54] shadow Just Praise Him not anyhow
[1:58] because you want to
[2:00] because you're fearfully and wonderfully
[2:03] created to praise him it's who we are
[2:07] it's not what we do it's an expression
[2:10] of who we
[2:12] are when the enemy woo comes in like a
[2:16] flood the Lord will lift up a war flag
[2:22] against
[2:25] him somebody said what if I don't have a
[2:28] war flag you do
[2:31] I would that men everywhere would lift
[2:34] up holy hands without wrath and without
[2:40] doubt and when the enemy sees a Believer
[2:43] going through the fire going through a
[2:46] trial going through joint pain going
[2:49] through whatever sickness you're dealing
[2:51] with and yet you've got your war flag up
[2:55] and you're saying my God is good he's
[2:59] good he's faithful he's going to always
[3:02] take care of
[3:06] me the Lord
[3:08] sth on top of the
[3:11] flood he rides it like a horse to come
[3:16] to your rescue when you call on him you
[3:20] may feel forsaken you may feel forgotten
[3:24] you may feel rejected you may feel
[3:27] overlooked but it's a lie your God
[3:31] hasn't misplaced you he knows exactly
[3:35] where you are get your war flag up Let
[3:39] Your Standard be raised against the
[3:42] enemy and he has no choice but to do
[3:45] what he has to flee from you
