Some will be traveling through the night. And I ask the angels to ask the Lord to let the angels be with them as they're uh traveling. We are expecting God to move among us through the rest of this weekend to move tonight. When we pray, let us remember the situation going on in Israel with the hostages. It it seems that the there has been a a deal that has been made and over the next few days it's supposed to unfold.

Do you really believe that, church? &gt;&gt; He is worthy today. Oh my. Don't you just love him? &gt;&gt; Don't you just love him? Don't you just love it when you feel him getting close to you? &gt;&gt; It just does something to me. &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't want me to react and he doesn't want me to rejoice, he better not get close to me. Cuz my hand's going to go up. My heart's going to say, "Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he is worthy today. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in miracles? &gt;&gt; Do you believe God still the same today that he was yesterday? The scripture said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You're looking at a miracle standing up here. I'm telling you tonight that no matter what you have need of, whether it's a whether it's a headache or a or a toenail pull off, Amen. or if it's life-threatening cancer, &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that God has the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's that close. He's that close. &gt;&gt; Amen. To answering that prayer. You see, there's no space between that. That's how close he is. And all we have to do is believe him. Is to have faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell you something? Faith is faith in the face of facts. &gt;&gt; Fact is 99 year old women don't have babies. Faith says otherwise. &gt;&gt; Faith says if you're going to if you're going to tear down the walls of a city, you don't march around with a 29piece orchestra saying pling all is well. But faith says something different. &gt;&gt; If you're going out and defeat a giant, you don't send a 14 or 15 year old kid that has no battle experience with you. But faith says different. &gt;&gt; And the doctor may have said there's no hope for you, but faith says there's something different. &gt;&gt; Thank God. All you got to do, Jesus said, only believe. All things are possible. God bless you. Let's talk to him. Father, how grateful and thankful and privileged we are to be able to stand in your holy presence tonight, Lord, to feel you so close to us, Lord. And we know that you come to do a work tonight through that word, Lord, through our faith and believing you. We have come believing, Lord. We are creating within ourselves an atmosphere to receive exactly what you have for us today, Lord. We put no restrictions. We put no limitation tonight, Lord, on what you're able to do. And we just open ourselves completely and holy to you and say, Lord, whatever it is that you want to accomplish in our lives, in our bodies, in our spirit tonight, Lord, we stand here as receptive vessels saying, "Touch us, Lord, tonight." You saw all these multitude of hands that were lifted today. I wish I had the ability, Lord, to meet one of those needs, but I do not. But we're serving a God today that said, "I will supply all of your needs according to my riches and glory." It doesn't matter what it is. It doesn't matter what resource it takes. You have the ability today. We cast ourselves and our needs and our petitions at the feet of Jesus today. And we trust you. We believe you today. Bless your man's servant as he brings this word tonight. open our hearts and give us a spirit and a heart to receive that to just speak to us and we walk out of this building. We walk out having been changed a little bit more to be like you that we've whittle off that we've shed off whatever it was that caused us not to be a perfect vision of the son of God. Help us I pray in Jesus name we praise you. We thank you. Amen. Amen. God bless. God bless you, brother John. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You may have your seat tonight. &gt;&gt; I felt my faith being stirred. [Laughter] You could tell it, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's good to be gathered once again tonight. &gt;&gt; A lot of us were here last night, but some traveled in today and we're so thankful to see them uh in the house of the Lord. Sister West, it is so good to see you and see Paul tonight. God bless you. [Applause] Johnny, I didn't see you last night, so I'm going to greet you tonight. God bless you. We're glad you're here. [Applause] Brother Isaac and Sister Mary Stofus traveled in today from Indiana. We're glad that they're here tonight. [Music] Sister Lily Klene and Aaliyah came from Missouri. I assume you traveled in today. God bless you. We're glad you're here. [Music] [Applause] I'm trying to scan the crowd. Make sure I get everybody. Isaac and Susan, we're glad that you all are here from Indiana. God bless you. Ruth Stoz traveled in today. God bless you from Indiana. [Applause] Over here, Pastor Brother Isaac and his wife, Sister Annie, and their children also traveled in from Indiana today. God bless you. [Applause] Now, some of these are leaving tonight, and we really want to pray for them. They're they're brave souls to travel all night to go home. They trade out because they have they have farms, they have produce, they have to they have to look after animals and so some of them come so and some of them stay behind and then they switch out. So that's what's happening tonight. We want to pray for them and believe the Lord to to uh help them get there and here and back there. And &gt;&gt; God is good. He's faithful. &gt;&gt; We're blessed to be able to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Tomorrow night is banquet night when we're going to celebrate Brother Shel's 50th preaching anniversary. It starts promptly at 6:00. There is going to be a lot of activity tomorrow night, including eating. So, it's going to start promptly at 6. They requested that I would tell you if you're the parents of small children where you're going to need to get in and out of the table maybe frequently that you would sit toward the ends because we are going to be tight there in the fellowship hall. And uh that they've got the little tables for the younger children over there on the side. You may have to tend to those children as well. So, if you have that age group of children, uh we're just doing that so that you don't have to uh spend as much time uh squeezing through the chairs. &gt;&gt; We're adding what you saw last night. They're going to add another row of uh of tables and chairs. So, we are going to be squeezed in there. When you go in, I will warn you, it may be cold, but it won't stay cold long. We only have two air conditioners down there. We got six in this building. So, &gt;&gt; uh we're going to add to it. &gt;&gt; We'll add to it as we need it. But I just want to give you that warning that we may uh have it cold when you go in because we've got to beat the rush. But we're going to have a good time tonight. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a good time tomorrow night. We're going to have a good time Saturday. We're going to have a good time Sunday [Applause] because where Jesus is, &gt;&gt; we can have a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; And I like the way brother John said. He said, "Lord, if you don't want me to react, don't come near." &gt;&gt; You see, he built us. God built us &gt;&gt; as emotional people. Whether you claim to be emotional or not, &gt;&gt; he claimed us as human beings with emotions. &gt;&gt; And when his holy spirit draws near to us and that vibration of the spirit starts happening, there's something that inside of me that reacts to that &gt;&gt; and and I could quench it. &gt;&gt; I have the human ability to quench it. But I believe that if we embrace the spirit of the Lord, he'll come again and again and again. &gt;&gt; And all that heavy burden that you've been hanging on to. All that heavy burden that you've just let rest on your shoulders, if you'll let him draw near to you, he can roll that burden right off of you. &gt;&gt; He promised he would &gt;&gt; in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. We're going to receive the offering for the expenses of the meeting tonight. As you put in your offering, perhaps you would have tithe the local people that you would want to put in as well. Brother Ellas, would you come again tonight and stand here? Ian, will you get the other bag and come and stand over here, please? We're going to uh bring our offering to the Lord. We want to see every need of this meeting taken care of. We don't want we we don't want to beg you. &gt;&gt; We're not beggars because my papa owns it all. &gt;&gt; And if we're obedient to his voice when he says give, he'll take care of this ministry. He'll take care of you. &gt;&gt; I've seen him do it over and over and over again. God is faithful. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you give to the Lord tonight. Would you sing this course? I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Well, I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. I'm so glad Jesus set me free. Singing glory hallelujah. Jesus set me free.

I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Singing glory. Hallelujah. Jesus set me free. Hallelujah. He whom the sun sets free &gt;&gt; is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're able, would you stand to your feet tonight? We're going to invite our brother Dwayne Jackson to the pulpit. He's going to sing and preach and testify in whatever the Lord lays on his heart. We believe that God sent him here for us. And I believe that there is a word from heaven that is to be delivered tonight that we can receive if we'll come with a right spirit and a right heart, a right attitude. Father, we thank you that we can be gathered here tonight as our brother would come. I am asking you that you will do the exceeding and abundant tonight in this house that you get all glory and honor through our brother as he ministers to us. And it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray and declare these things that you get glory. Amen. Would you help me to make Brother Dwayne welcome to the pullpit tonight? God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; I love you, buddy. If you're going to sing, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How can you not be excited &gt;&gt; in an atmosphere like this? &gt;&gt; Amen. you you can have your seats for just a a moment if you would and uh give me hopefully give me a chance to settle my nerves just a little bit. Um, I I I told brother told brother Wesley after his service the other night, I said I said, "You know, about a week and a half ago, the Lord gave me a a scripture that he impressed upon me to to to use for the service tonight, an opening scripture." And I was at first I I was excited. you know, when whenever you're you're praying and asking the Lord's direction and you you you feel like you get a word and you you write that down and and then the more I dwelt on it in my human mind, I said, "That don't make no sense to me. Why why would I why would you want me to use that verse? It it just it it I couldn't make sense out of it." And I I had a a thought that I felt like he was leading me on. And every time I kept going back to the first verse that I I had written down, I said, "Lord, that that don't make sense to me. Maybe maybe I I've miss I've missed it. But then after the service whenever brother Wesley preached the other night, I told him afterwards, I I know the reason why. &gt;&gt; I know the reason why. &gt;&gt; Everything makes sense to me now. &gt;&gt; And so many different things I'll share with you in just a minute. But I want to sing a song and um if you know it, please please help me. I'm not a I don't like to to sing specials. I I like to people to worship with me this evening. The the song is Speak to the Mountain. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Help me sing it this evening. &gt;&gt; From strength to strength we sometimes go. And again, we're sinking low in the shadow of a mountain looming high above our heads. We need not fear what lies ahead. For the word has clearly said that our faith would be sufficient to make the mountain disappear. Speak to the mountain. You'll not triumph over me. Be thou removed from here to yonder. Disappear into the sea. Speak to the mountain. Speak with authority [Applause] and the mountain must move. And you shall claim victory [Applause] in the midst of the battle. When the foe is gaining ground, look up and see the mighty hand of God reaching down. Oh, speak God's word name and Satan trembles. Speak God's word and watch him flee. For once again our God delivers. The mountain crles at our feet. Speak to the mountain. You'll not triumph over me. Be thou removed from here to yonder. Disappear into the sea. Speak to the mountain. Speak with authority and the mountainous move and you shall claim victory. Can I sing that second verse one more time? Now in the midst of your battle, when the foe is gaining round, look up and see the mighty hand of God, still reaching down. Oh, speak God's name as Satan trembles. Speak God's word and watch him bleed. For once again, my God delivers the mountains from his feet. Oh me to the mountain. You not triumph over me. Be thou removed from here to yonder. Disappear into to the sea. Sweet to the mountain. Oh, speak with authority. Oh, and the mountain must move and you shall claim victory. Oh, speak to the mountain. You triumph over me. Oh, be thou removed from here to yonder. disappear into the sea. Speak to the mountain. Speak with authority and the mountain must move. You shall claim victory. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you really recognize tonight &gt;&gt; what power &gt;&gt; and what authority that has been given to you. &gt;&gt; If you don't now, I hope by the end of this service that you do. I feel like so many of us have not taken a hold of it. &gt;&gt; It's been given to you &gt;&gt; to use what's been given to you, his word. &gt;&gt; But if you don't take it and you don't consume it, you're never going to be able to speak it. &gt;&gt; You must take and eat the book. &gt;&gt; It has to become a part of you. Would you stand with me this evening? Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name. Amen. Amen. I tell you, it is such a joy and such a privilege. Thank you musicians. I tell you the you just don't find better musicians in worship. We thank them for their their labor of love. And I tell you, it's if if you've ever if you've never been in their position, you don't realize how much it takes and how much they give of themsel. And uh I I tell you, I certainly do appreciate as as name as brother Joe was saying last night of of watching Brother Benjamin whenever he leads worship, it's it's not done half-heartedly. &gt;&gt; It it's not done and it's not done as a show. There there's I I've been to services where it appears as a performance is being put on, but that's not a show. That's him entering in to his personal worship. And if you want to join in with him, then do it. &gt;&gt; He He's doing the work. He's doing the work of a of of ministry, of inviting you in to the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you, there's been so many things just in the past two days that have that have just overwhelmed me with with things concerning about tonight. And I I don't make I don't want to keep you standing for long, but you'll be seated longer than you'll be standing. So, um, the the other night, um, last night, Brother Joe, Brother Joe Writers, in in his, um, in his ministry to us, he was he was sharing with us how how our position is key. &gt;&gt; The position that you're in, the position that you're supposed to be in is key. And he spoke he spoke on on Mark um, chapter 16 and and in his his speaking, he he made a comment. He said, "It must become an inspired word in my life." &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. It It must become an inspired word. &gt;&gt; It can't just be left just just on on here. It's got to be inspired word. &gt;&gt; And then and then a comment that he made about it was about eight minutes or so to till he he was finished up. He said, "We have to be able to make sure that the word is vested &gt;&gt; in us." &gt;&gt; Now, I can't tell you the last time I've heard the word vested &gt;&gt; used. You'll see why it's important to me in just a in just a moment. my morning devotional as I sat down to to read and study this morning. It it came up on my my screen and uh let me see if I can if I can find it now. My morning devotional popped up on my screen. It says, "We are God's mouthpiece." &gt;&gt; Hashtag speak the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My thought for this evening is by the power vested &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; And I I I tell you, I I love the continuity &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Benjamin comes out and he sings, "I was made for more." &gt;&gt; You'll find where that fits in at the end of the the the service this evening. It it just Everything is just is falling in line. And as I said, the things that Brother Wesley was talking about, it it clarified to me why I want to share this opening scripture this evening before I let you have your seats. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; My opening scripture tonight is Isaiah chapter 52 verse one and two. You got it. They got it on here. Awake. I I don't I don't think Isaiah was telling them, "Hey, wake up. &gt;&gt; Wake up. Listen to what I have to say." &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't quiet. &gt;&gt; No, he was trying to get their attention. He said, "Awake. Awake. &gt;&gt; Put on thy strength, O Zion. &gt;&gt; Put on thy beautiful." And I wrote down majestic, honorable, and glorious garments, oh Jerusalem, the holy city. For henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if you were here Tuesday night, &gt;&gt; you understand when brother Wesley was talking about the circumcision, &gt;&gt; right? This is why it tied in for me. Uh it made it it brought it clarity to me. No more come into thee the circum uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake thyself from the dust. Arise and sit down, O Jerusalem. Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, oh captive daughter of Zion. You don't have to be bound anymore. How you speak the word? &gt;&gt; The bonds have been removed. We have kept them on ourselves. &gt;&gt; He has not bound you. &gt;&gt; He's given you freedom. He's given you liberty. &gt;&gt; You have to take the bondage off. Loose thyself. &gt;&gt; Take the word, speak the word, and loose thyself. He's given you the power and he has given you the authority to do just that. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. I pray that the Lord will bless the reading of his word and bless the remainder of the service. And and uh I tell you, I I I know he's here. &gt;&gt; I know he's here. And if even if if I would if I would potentially make a mistake, I know he will clear he will clear it up. my my mind is going in so many different directions with with with so many things that that have have happened and I've heard and and um I I I want to bring it to you. I want to to deliver it to you as it came to me. In the book of in the book of Genesis 32 verse 28 says, "And he said, thy name shall be called no more Jacob, &gt;&gt; but Israel, &gt;&gt; for as a prince, thou hast power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." &gt;&gt; God placed that authority. He changed him. He changed his name and he placed within him a power and a position of authority. Now he had to step into it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He had to walk into the position that he was placed in. Tonight you and I must again walk into the position that he has placed before us. &gt;&gt; He puts a position there. But if you choose to turn aside, &gt;&gt; then his hands are tied. You you did you know that you can that you can tie the hands of God if you don't believe. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is what hinders him. Now it's not going to it's not going to hinder the ultimate of his plan and his will but it will hinder your ability to receive blessings and favor with him. &gt;&gt; Now the the word power we know it means authority. And the word vested as I said the the title this evening would be by the power vested in me. The word vested, maybe some people may not understand what that word means, but it means empowered or it means authorized. &gt;&gt; It means commissioned. &gt;&gt; And it means approved. &gt;&gt; So he has he has commissioned us with a power and an authority this evening. And if you're if you if you are confused about your position in Christ, you will never understand what your authority is &gt;&gt; and you will never know how to use it. &gt;&gt; So you you've got to get rid of the confusion. &gt;&gt; Satan wants you to be confused. &gt;&gt; He does not want you to accept that you are a son and a daughter of God. He wants you to forget who your father is. &gt;&gt; That's what he wants you to do. He wants to confuse you and get you pulled away from that because he knows &gt;&gt; that if you recognize your position and you recognize who you are, you get a true revelation of who you are, there is nothing that can stop you. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You know, there there's and I don't have it written down, but it just comes to my mind that that there was a place that Brother Brandham made made the comment that that when the true church gets a true revelation &gt;&gt; of what she is, that she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? You get a true revelation of your position in Christ, there's nothing that can stop you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stand in your way. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. And people say, "Well, my problem is too big for him." &gt;&gt; No, it ain't. &gt;&gt; No, it isn't. There's there's nothing that's too too hard for him. But, you know, in in our Christian walk today, there's there's many that that still live in a in a with a a spiritual popper mentality. &gt;&gt; They have not truly accepted who they are. &gt;&gt; And and so they they still they let Satan drag them down and bind them down with the thoughts in their mind. And so they live as a popper when they have been given the place of a prince and as a king. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't live that way. &gt;&gt; If if I had a million dollars, I I'm going to live like I had a million dollars. &gt;&gt; I don't have a million dollars. So I I I don't live that way. But if I was a millionaire, you would know it. I would I would act the part of a millionaire. There's a few people that that I know of that are millionaires and and honestly, you don't see them act in that part. I think it's because they don't want somebody else to know that they are because they know if they if the other people find out they are, then all they're going to want is &gt;&gt; give me give me give me. But but if I in in the spiritual sense, I'm I'm a the son of a king. &gt;&gt; That means something to me. You know, I I've had I've had my kids and you know, it's it's it's hard being a preacher's kid um because sometimes you get you get picked on or you um examples get used. Um but I've had them ask me a as they're as they're growing up, you know. Well, Dad, why why why do we dress the way we dress? Why do we act the way we act? Why why is it that we don't go to these places? And you know, I've got friends that they they go here and they go there and and their mom and dad says nothing's wrong with it. &gt;&gt; And and and they're allowed to wear this and they're allowed to wear that and and their parents said that there's nothing and they go to church. &gt;&gt; They say that they read the Bible. &gt;&gt; And what I remind them, I said, "Whenever you go out of the house, you represent our family." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, now they are a Jackson. &gt;&gt; Right. And in our in our community, in our in our county, the the Jackson family has been known for years and years and years. Our family has lived in in the in the same area since just around the turn of the century of 1700. So, there's a lot of Jacksons that live in our community. Our business that that we operate has been in business since 1952. My grandfather started the company. My dad runs the company. He owns the company. He doesn't run it anymore. He put that on to me. And I've I've been there for over 30 years working with him at the company. So, in our community, we're known. That's right. &gt;&gt; The people know us. The other day, my my mom and dad's building a a new house and they they had something that an issue about needing to get an inspector to come out and do an inspection. Brother Steve and and so they they called he called the inspector or somebody else called for dad and and the the inspector said, "Well, has such and such been done?" Well, typically an inspector goes out to the job site. &gt;&gt; They're not going to take your word &gt;&gt; because their jobs on the line. So they they called and and the person told him I I think it was my mom that was talking to him and um actually it wasn't sorry it was a it was another gentleman that was talking to him and they said the the response was is such and such completed and he said Doyle said Doyle is my dad's name. Doyle said it's done and his response to him was well if he said it's done it's done. He said, "I've never known him in all my years of knowing him," which was 50 almost 50 years. He says, "I've never known him to lie. &gt;&gt; Never known him to lie." See, there's a reputation that goes with our family name. &gt;&gt; And there's a reputation that goes with you. &gt;&gt; When whenever you go out into public, you are you're representing your natural family. &gt;&gt; You're representing your church that you attend. And you are a representation of God and his word. If you claim &gt;&gt; him as your father &gt;&gt; and you claim this church as your church, &gt;&gt; then you should feel that you should feel that burden within you that when I walk out into public, I don't want to look something other than &gt;&gt; what this says. &gt;&gt; I don't want to bring a reproach &gt;&gt; on my family's name. I don't want to bring a reproach on my church name and I definitely don't want to bring a reproach on his name &gt;&gt; cuz people look at you &gt;&gt; and let them look. &gt;&gt; Some people, you know, that as they're growing up, they're like, I I don't want to be I don't want to be called out. I I don't want to look different. We're called to be different. &gt;&gt; That's that that's what makes us who we are. We are called to be a separated people. There's a reason that we're we're called to be separated that none of that's in in in the notes, but praise the Lord. In in the message, fundamental foundation for faith, brother Brandham makes a a little comment. He says, "But he gave us these redeemed blessings that we might operate &gt;&gt; that we might operate the work of God by the energy &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit." All of the blessings that he's given to you is for a purpose. &gt;&gt; It's that we be that we are able to operate the work of God. Not operate your work, &gt;&gt; not operate somebody else's work, &gt;&gt; but we're operating his work. &gt;&gt; And we're doing it by the energy of the Holy Spirit. Over in the book of Revelations chapter 1 verse 5 and 6, it says, "And from Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood, &gt;&gt; and hath made us &gt;&gt; what? kings and priests &gt;&gt; unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Now, if he has made you a king and a priest, &gt;&gt; you want to go ahead and take my notes? &gt;&gt; I don't have &gt;&gt; Okay. He's going ahead and preaching for me. &gt;&gt; Live like it. That's what we're called to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How are you going to walk out in front of somebody and say, "I'm I'm I'm a son of a king." And you look like you just came out of the barroom. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what, they're they're not going to look at you and trust you and believe you. &gt;&gt; They're not. They're going to say, "He's double-minded &gt;&gt; and he's unstable &gt;&gt; in all of his ways." Trust me, the the people that live out in the world, they know scripture. &gt;&gt; They'll bring scripture to you. &gt;&gt; And they'll look at you and they'll bind you up if you ain't careful. &gt;&gt; They'll they'll bring scripture and they'll they'll they will bind you up with those because guess what? Their father is Satan. &gt;&gt; He knows the word. &gt;&gt; My Bible said he he he he fears. He trembles. He He knows the word, &gt;&gt; you know. He just can't live it. &gt;&gt; He wasn't called to live it. &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation chapter 5 verse 9 and 10, it says, "And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy." &gt;&gt; Didn't we just sing that just a few minutes ago? again. Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made hast made us unto our God, kings and priests. And we shall reign where? &gt;&gt; On the earth. This is where we will reign here on this earth. &gt;&gt; Now, if again, if he has placed you as kings and priests, there are responsibilities that go along with that. &gt;&gt; There's benefits that go with it. &gt;&gt; And there's responsibilities that go with it. Hopefully, we'll get to that in a little bit. In the message, faith is a substance. Brother Brandham says our bodies are groaning &gt;&gt; and we have an inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're children now, heirs of the kingdom. He said, "Oh my kings and priests unto God, offering spiritual sacrifice." &gt;&gt; That's what these sons Did I move? I think I went to the wrong spot. What does a priest do? Yes. Make a sacrifice. What is a spiritual sacrifice? That's what these sons and daughters do, which are kings and priests, yet not in full possession, &gt;&gt; but they're making sacrifices, offering to God spiritual sacrifices, &gt;&gt; the fruits of our lips. &gt;&gt; Giving praise to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Fruits of our lips. You say, "Brother Brandom, I I just don't feel like praising him." &gt;&gt; You ever been in that place &gt;&gt; in in this flesh? You ever been in that place? You're you're in a really low spot and and you're it's really tough to, you know, to to want to give that praise. He said he said that's the time &gt;&gt; to make the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Praise him anyhow. &gt;&gt; Kings and priests, sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifice, the fruits of our lips giving praise unto his name. He said, "Now notice it was for everyone that was a priest in the Old Testament. Everyone in the New Testament that becomes a Christian, born again, &gt;&gt; becomes a priest to God." &gt;&gt; And we are priests and kings. &gt;&gt; A priest is to make sacrifice. &gt;&gt; We'll let that settle for a second. &gt;&gt; A priest is to make sacrifice. People don't people don't want to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; They want the benefits of the king &gt;&gt; and the dominion that I have as the king. But don't make me sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But see, it takes both. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It takes both. A priest is to make sacrifice. And we give to God the sacrifice of our lips, giving praise to his name. Say, "I don't feel like it." He said, "Do it anyhow." &gt;&gt; That's a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Say, "I feel too tired." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The devil will tell you that &gt;&gt; will &gt;&gt; till he takes you to hell. &gt;&gt; That's tough. &gt;&gt; That's tough words. He will tell you that till he takes you to hell. Said, "That's right. You're to make a spiritual sacrifice. the fruits of our lips, giving praise to his name, priests and kings. Unto God the Bible said we were made us priests and kings. If we're kings and priests, how ought we to act? How ought how ought we to conduct ourselves? &gt;&gt; Excuse me. I wrote down we haven't been made kings and priests because of anything that we have done. I &gt;&gt; I want you to I want you to understand that it it wasn't anything that you did. &gt;&gt; But he chose you. &gt;&gt; And because he has chosen you and because you are spiritual Abraham's seed, the spiritual seed of Abraham, then you are a recipient of the inheritance &gt;&gt; that was given. It's only according to his sovereign will that he chose you and he placed a representation of himself within you. &gt;&gt; If his seed is inside you, &gt;&gt; it must bring forth of its kind. &gt;&gt; If his seed is inside of you, it will bring forth of its kind. Right. &gt;&gt; In 2 Thessalonians 1 11 and 12, wherefore also we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling. Now see, in my own self, in my own mind, I don't feel worthy. I I don't feel worthy to stand here in front of you this evening and even to open his word and to read his word. But it wasn't of my calling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, he's made me worthy. His word, his righteousness &gt;&gt; is what has made me worthy. I I didn't call myself I didn't this is the furthest thing than than what I would want to do. I I ran from it for 20 plus years to to not be in this position. And it it cost me it cost me, you know, many many years of of of of not being fully blessed the way that God wanted me to be blessed. But once I stepped into my position, &gt;&gt; then he was able to perform what he already had in place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it was me. I was out of position. &gt;&gt; I had to I had to accept the calling and I had to step into the position that he had set forth for me and then operate within that position. It's it's one thing to realize what position you are supposed to be in. Another thing to act on it &gt;&gt; and to step into it and do the performance that you're supposed to do. Not performance as a performing type thing, but do what he's asked you to do is what I'm saying. worthy of this calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you. &gt;&gt; That's that's what he's wanting. He he he is wanting to receive glory &gt;&gt; to him &gt;&gt; and ye in him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. In the book of Ephesians, I I I bring a lot of scripture to you that it's I hope you don't mind scripture. &gt;&gt; I love scripture. &gt;&gt; If I say something of my own, it could it could be wrong. But I guarantee you if I read to you scripture and I bring you scripture, it ain't going to be wrong. &gt;&gt; Never ever wrong. In the book of Ephesians chapter 2, verses 1 through 7, &gt;&gt; and you hath he quickened. who were dead in trespasses and sins. &gt;&gt; Now, I want I want to stop just a second. Brother Wesley, whenever you read from the book of Ephesians last night, chapter 2, what verse did you start with? Whenever he opened up with verse 8, I opened my notes up and I handed I showed it over to to Heather. I said, "Look, I've got Ephesians 2:es 1-7." and he started with eight. I I I again I love the continuity &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world &gt;&gt; according to the prince of the power of the air &gt;&gt; the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience &gt;&gt; among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, &gt;&gt; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. &gt;&gt; But God, &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; for his great love wherewith he loved us, his mercy. &gt;&gt; I I didn't deserve it. &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve it in in in the in the way that I was. I didn't deserve it. &gt;&gt; But he chose me. He chose me. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. That such an expression of God's mercy and his love. It was a divine intervention &gt;&gt; for you and me &gt;&gt; because without Christ, we're powerless. &gt;&gt; Without him, we're empty vessels. &gt;&gt; If if you don't have him, you ain't got nothing. &gt;&gt; If you don't have his love and you don't have his mercy, you ain't got nothing. &gt;&gt; You're completely empty. You would still be dead in your trespasses and sin. You'd be helpless &gt;&gt; and without a hope. &gt;&gt; But he is rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; He is the one who's made you worthy. &gt;&gt; He is the one who has given you authority. &gt;&gt; You didn't earn it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you could earn it. &gt;&gt; Nothing that you could do to earn it. &gt;&gt; And you definitely don't deserve it. Right? &gt;&gt; This flesh man don't deserve what he has given to us. &gt;&gt; But his love and his mercy just simply flows. &gt;&gt; It flows out of him. He wants to bring you mercy. He wants to offer grace to you. But will you accept it or not? &gt;&gt; His mercy brought a spiritual resurrection. And he has raised us up. The the scripture said he raised us up and seated with him in heavenly places. And I I I even I think I mentioned it last night. If if if we are seated with him and the scripture says that he has that he has been seated at the right hand of the father. &gt;&gt; The right hand of the father is a position of power. &gt;&gt; So if we are in him and we are in heavenly places and we are seated with him then we also &gt;&gt; by proxy we're sitting in a position of power and authority. We have to accept and recognize that position that he has placed us in in uh oh my I think I've got this in in the message gifts 1956 did I okay I did when Peter James and John &gt;&gt; had received power Jesus gave them power to heal the sick &gt;&gt; to cast out devils to raise the dead about Mark chapter 16. &gt;&gt; All this was already in my notes before last night. He says, "I can show you where God give that power to the church." &gt;&gt; And you that don't believe in divine healing or miracles, show me where he took it away from the church. [Music] Show me where &gt;&gt; he he he he he made that claim in front of many many people. Show me where. He said he um hang on. Let me find show me where he took it away from the church. But when they received it, he said the church today, this is what I the church today isn't needing power. &gt;&gt; It's needing faith &gt;&gt; to operate. What power it has. &gt;&gt; You've had so much embalming fluid pushed into you &gt;&gt; that the days of miracles has passed in some old cold morg with the icicles, the spiritual icicles hanging down. He was talking about churches. &gt;&gt; You understand? He's talking about churches and preachers that were pumping inbombing fluid into people. &gt;&gt; Spiritual icicles hanging down with 90 below zero. and somebody in there with some dead fluid to pump into you to be sure that you stay dead. &gt;&gt; They don't want somebody jumping up and shouting hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just keep them all quiet. &gt;&gt; Just keep it would scare them. &gt;&gt; It would you you have some of these churches when some of y'all would go in and and the word would be preached and the the the word given across the pull pit and a person shout up and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; It'd probably escort you out. We don't want that in here. &gt;&gt; There there are &gt;&gt; there are &gt;&gt; He said it's become such a place till the spirit of God has been grieved. And any church that denies the supernatural, &gt;&gt; get this. &gt;&gt; This is what our prophet said. &gt;&gt; Any church that denies the supernatural, it'll die as sure as I'm standing this pull pit. He that cometh of God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those who diligently seek him. He is alive. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever in every principle and power, a living Christ. When these disciples had received that power, he said, "Look at it. It just lays in man." Oh, they thought they were dignified. And they go right out a few days later and find themselves helpless &gt;&gt; before an epileptic. They could not cast the devil out. And Jesus come along and he said to them, "Oh thou faithless generation. &gt;&gt; How long will I suffer you? Bring him here." Oh brother, when he come before that real jewel, &gt;&gt; he cast the devil out of him. And the disciples come to him. They said, "Lord, did you take your power back?" He never said, "You don't have power." They said, "Why can't we do it?" He never said, "Well, because you lost your power." He said, "Because of your unbelief." &gt;&gt; See, the power had been given. The authority &gt;&gt; to move the same way Jesus was moving had been given. The problem was is they were not fully stepped into their position and using it in the correct way. &gt;&gt; They they they weren't they they you could almost say they it was almost like an impostor. You know, they they weren't using it in the right way fully moving under the uncction of the Holy Spirit under you know the under exactly how Christ wanted them to work and move. And many of them you know there was there was a time that um there was seven sons of They went out. &gt;&gt; Sure was. &gt;&gt; They were they were paid exorcist, &gt;&gt; you know, and and they wanted to go out and and and they were going to they they saw what the disciples were doing. &gt;&gt; I'm this is this is not here, but they I just that story come to my mind. They wanted to do what the disciples were doing because they seen they had been given authority to speak over the over over devils and cast devils out. So they went out and they were going to move just like the disciples and they go out and they they you know they go out to to cast the demon out and the demon speaks back to them. So you you've got to make sure that you are in &gt;&gt; the leading of the Lord. You are following his will. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has to be in accordance with his will. Guess what? If you don't move within his will, you're going to get in trouble. You're going to be on your own &gt;&gt; and he's not going to back you up. &gt;&gt; If you just try to I'm going to give somebody a word. &gt;&gt; You better know that you are following the will of God. &gt;&gt; It better not be coming from your mind. &gt;&gt; It better be coming from his word. And you better know that he gave you that specifically to give because these these guys, they went out and they were going to cast this devil out. And the demon said, "hm uh Paul, I know. And um Jesus, I know. I don't know who you are. You ain't got any authority over me." &gt;&gt; It's what the demon said. You You have no authority over me. You know, they were saying by the I I I forgot how they how they they said they was going to cast him out by the um in the in the name that Paul preached, I think is how how they they they said it. If &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and he said he said you know I know this one and I know Jesus but I don't in other words he's saying I do not accept the authority that you're trying to claim &gt;&gt; because the authority had not been vested &gt;&gt; to them &gt;&gt; it had not been given to them &gt;&gt; they had not been commissioned &gt;&gt; by God to do those things so he didn't have to back it up and if you try to go out on your own and you have not been commissioned by him. Guess what? You're going to fail. You're going to fall flat on your face and you might end up like them. They were fully embarrassed because that demon beat them up terribly, stripped them of their clothes, and sent them running away. &gt;&gt; That That's complete embarrassment. &gt;&gt; And I I don't want to be in a spot that that I'm trying to move something on my own and I'm trying to do something that the Lord has not told me to do. I want to make sure that I'm right in the center of his will. See, the thing is what I told you a moment ago that that my my dad is the owner of the business that that we operate called Jackson Steel. He's owned it now for for quite a few years and I've been working with him since uh 1993 92 somewhere around there. Long time ago. Well, there there came a time a few years back that he said I'm going to step back. He didn't want to fully retire, but he didn't want to deal with the day-to-day operations of the business. And and he he brought all the guys together and he and he stood me in front of all these all the guys that work. We got about 20 20 people there that that work. And he said, "As of today, he's running the company. All authority &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. All power to run the things of the company is in his name. He said, "We've we've signed it. His He's now listed as the president of the company, and if anything's being done, it goes through him. And if there's anything that I want, he this is him speaking. Anything that he wants done, he's going to tell me." So, as I run the company, I still operate the business knowing my father's will. Y'all understand that? &gt;&gt; I don't run the company just the way I want to run the company. &gt;&gt; I've been in my father's presence long enough. &gt;&gt; I know his ultimate direction for the business. &gt;&gt; He has told me in private many times he's given me direction. He said this, I want to see the company move to this level. I want to see us to do this and I want to see see us do that. I want to see the company grow. I want to make sure that that our guys are taken care of and and all these things. So, as I operate the business as the president now, I have I have authority on paper that I could go in and spend every dime that the company had. I could I could write a check and and sign it and it would get cash, &gt;&gt; but I would not be in the will of the father. That's good. &gt;&gt; Because I know the direction that he wants the company to go. &gt;&gt; He's just vested power. &gt;&gt; He commissioned me to be in hisstead &gt;&gt; to stand there in his place and speak. But the things that I'm speaking, I'm speaking what I have heard him say to me for years and years and years. And that's what we do with this word. Our father &gt;&gt; has presented his will to us. &gt;&gt; It's up to us if we've been commissioned to move and to work within &gt;&gt; his will. &gt;&gt; Don't do it on your own. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Brother Brandon would tell he he would tell the the um he would tell the story about the um the policeman, &gt;&gt; right? And um he said that that that policeman, he does not have the strength to step out there and stop a car. That's or you want say a semi-truck coming down the road and now there there's where's it at? But he walks out there. Guess what? I don't have the ability. I don't have the strength in me to stop a moving vehicle, but I guarantee you I walk out in that road and I flash this sheriff's badge in front of them, guess what? They're going to stop. Now, see the thing is, and I don't sure do y'all have an officer? Y'all have a a police officer? Okay. I didn't know if y'all had one that was a police officer in here. I was going to I I was hoping they would be. Pardon? Oh, you couldn't tell me. Okay. Now, see, the the thing is everything about this badge is real. Hold that. Look. Look at that. That's real. That's not a fake. That's real. See, I've got a I've got a friend of mine who is a who is a police officer, and I asked him the other day. I said, "Any chance I could borrow one of your badges?" He gracefully let me. He knows that I'm not going to do something wrong with it because, see, for me to stand out there now, they would respect that badge. Everybody's preaching for me. The the Yeah, we need help sometimes. Even though I'm an impersonator, I don't even have the authority to wield that badge. But they would respect that badge until they found out, wait a minute, You don't have authority. &gt;&gt; You're just holding up. You're impersonating an officer. And see, many people today &gt;&gt; impersonate &gt;&gt; a believer. &gt;&gt; They pick up the same word that you do. &gt;&gt; They'll use the same quotes that you do. &gt;&gt; And they have never been commissioned and authorized by God to use it. &gt;&gt; They become an impersonation. And they'll flash that badge and they want people to see that badge. &gt;&gt; They'll flash it in front of you. See what I know? &gt;&gt; See what I know. You need to listen to me. I'm standing. You need to obey me. &gt;&gt; See, this badge is legit, &gt;&gt; but I don't have the authority to use it in that way. I'm just using it as a sample tonight, as an example. But see, there's too many people today, sir, &gt;&gt; that are just impersonating being a true Christian. They pick up the same Bible you'd pick up. They'll speak those words out in front of you. Cuz I wanted Let's see. See, now I just bestowed a police badge to this young man right here. I vested, I commissioned him. If I had the true power and authority as a sheriff to deputize, that would be me commissioning him and me giving him authority now with that badge that he could go and he could hold that badge and he could the the authority that stood behind that badge would stand behind him. that's yours to keep. See, I gave it to him. He didn't come ask for it. But I chose to bestow it upon him. And that's what our heavenly father has done with us tonight. He chose you. He chose to place his word in your mouth. He chose to vest &gt;&gt; to commission you &gt;&gt; with his word to give you authority. &gt;&gt; But what are you going to do with it? Are you going to just keep it in your pocket? &gt;&gt; Are you actually going to wield it? &gt;&gt; Are you going to use it in the way it was intended? &gt;&gt; He has commissioned you. &gt;&gt; He told you to speak his word. and to speak it with authority. &gt;&gt; Everything, all the authority behind the Rutherford County Sheriff's Department would stand up for this badge right here if the right person is holding it. &gt;&gt; I'm just an impostor. But if the right person is holding it, if you have been commissioned by God &gt;&gt; to use his word as kings and priests, &gt;&gt; then the full authority of this word will stand behind you every single time that you speak it in faith believing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what's the key. Unbelief hinders you. &gt;&gt; People, they they they're they say, "Oh, yeah. I I know the Lord. He He gave me that badge, but I just I don't know that I I don't know if if I can use it or not. He made you priests and kings. &gt;&gt; You didn't put yourself there. &gt;&gt; He's the one who made you worthy. &gt;&gt; Your righteousness did not. &gt;&gt; He chose you and he chose to place his word within you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Water that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Water that with the sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; We We're We're supposed to be priests and kings. Oh, brother brother Steve, we we talked a little bit week or so ago or something. I I I'd sent something to him and and and also there there's there's more that goes beyond that. I'm not going to get into all of that, but there's a there's a prophetic ministry that comes with the bride as well. prophet, priest, and king. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; MelkiseDC, prophet, priest, and king. That's that's what's been given to us. That's what has been vested in us. It's what has been bestowed to us and commissioned to use the authority of the word. But are you going to stay in the popper mentality? Are you going to stay in the mentality of a victim for the rest of your life? or are you going to stand up and speak the word and say, "I don't have to let this mountain stand in my way anymore. &gt;&gt; I don't have to let this this mountain of of doubt &gt;&gt; stand in front of me. &gt;&gt; I've been given the authority of the word to speak it and move forward." &gt;&gt; Speak it and move forward. &gt;&gt; I have no idea where I'm at with my notes, but that's okay. 1 John 5:14. And this is the confidence that we have in him. &gt;&gt; That if we ask anything, see, a lot of people don't put that in. &gt;&gt; That's not convenient. &gt;&gt; Oh, it isn't convenient because then that means they have to pray and they have to lay before him to find out what his will is. But most people, they just want to say, "Anything that I ask, he's going to give it to me." &gt;&gt; No, it's got to be in accordance with his will. &gt;&gt; That's how we're supposed to pray. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you go to him, you're supposed to pray, "If it be thy will." &gt;&gt; Know that that that's one of the four most difficult words to pray. Thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's so difficult because my will is what I want. &gt;&gt; But when you go to him in prayer, that's how Christ prayed in the garden of Gethsemane whenever he was having to die out to himself. &gt;&gt; He says, "Not my will &gt;&gt; but thine be done." That's that's ultimately the hardest four words I think that a Christian prays is thy will be done because that means that you're completely dying out to yourself and you're taking self-will and setting it aside. And you know we're we we like oursel. We're human. We we like our will. We like our ideas and we think most of the time that our ideas are the best. &gt;&gt; We have to set those things aside and accept what God has for us. We have to operate and move within his will. &gt;&gt; We have to know the will of the father. In in in Luke 10 verse 19, he says, "Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you." &gt;&gt; Who gave you that power? He did. He's the one who vested &gt;&gt; that power to you. In the amplified, it reads like this. Listen carefully. I have given you authority that you now possess. Not going to possess, &gt;&gt; you now possess to tread on serpents and scorpions and the ability to exercise. &gt;&gt; Is it up there? The abil that's the &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. I'm in a different amplified. The ability to exercise authority over all the power of the enemy which is Satan. And nothing will in any way harm you. &gt;&gt; He's the one who has given us that power. His word has given us that power. In Matthew 10 verse one, he says, "And when he had called unto him the 12 disciples, his 12 disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease." &gt;&gt; What does that look like? &gt;&gt; What does what does that look like it when that it's put into action? You know, we we read the um the the the quote from Brother Brandon when he was talking about Peter and John, but I'd like to read to you the um in Acts chapter 3, verses 1-16. Says, "Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer." &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying to show you how how Matthew 10:1 has been put into action. went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour. And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said, "Look on us, and he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them." &gt;&gt; And then he got disappointed for just a moment. Then Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none." And I'm sure that for just a moment that man thought, "Well, then why did you stop? &gt;&gt; You know why I'm here." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; I I I need some money. I I I need something to help get me a loan. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And now you're going to stand here and waste my time by telling me, "Sorry, I ain't got no money." &gt;&gt; Right? Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, &gt;&gt; but such as I have. Not such as I'm going to get, &gt;&gt; such as I'm going to receive, but he said, such as I have, give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. &gt;&gt; And immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. &gt;&gt; And he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there's a lot there's a there's a whole lot just just right in there that that's going on and there's no way I can can go into all of that. But he I don't know how long he'd been lame from his mother's womb. I mean if you know anything if if that your muscles atrophy and and all these things and there's there would be absolutely no strength. That mean there was instantaneous recreation, &gt;&gt; an instantaneous miracle that took place in his body. &gt;&gt; He could not help but jump up. &gt;&gt; He had never felt that strength before. And all of a sudden, that strength and energy hit him. There was nothing that was going to stop him from leaping to his feet and shouting because there was a miracle that had taken place. And there's miracles that take place in our lives every day. And sometimes we're just we keep quiet about it. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't I don't want to make such a big to-do about it. &gt;&gt; He made a big deal about it. &gt;&gt; He wanted everybody to know and see what God had done for him. &gt;&gt; He wasn't going to need to be out there no more begging for for alms. He was going to be able to provide for himself. All right. &gt;&gt; You know, there was a um I don't if you've ever read any of uh uh anything by Thomas Aquinus. Thomas Aquinas. He was a uh 13th century um with the uh with the Catholic uh church I believe. Um but there was a time um he had went to the pope and um it was a time that that that they were counting a lot of income, a lot of revenue that had been coming in to the to the church. And the and the pope, he was kind of bold and and and he he looked over at Thomas Aquinas and he says, "No longer do we have to say as Peter, silver and gold have I none. And Thomas Aquinas looked at the pope and he says, "And neither can you, as Peter say, rise up and walk." &gt;&gt; See, it was all just finery. It was all beauty. It was all just a business. &gt;&gt; As brother Joe was talking, just it was just a business plan. It was just a way for money to come in. And that pope was he was bragging on, "Oh, we're not like Peter. We we don't have to say silver and gold have I none. They had they have all of it. They're they're they're so they're so rich, &gt;&gt; but they have no power. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, and like like but like Peter, you can't say rise up and walk. I don't care about this gold. I don't care about the silver. I don't care about anything this world has to give. &gt;&gt; You can have it all. You can take it all. But I want to be able to operate &gt;&gt; within the power and the authority of God's word because that is what makes a difference. &gt;&gt; You can have all of the wealth of this world &gt;&gt; and if you don't have him, you have absolutely nothing. And if you don't have a revelation &gt;&gt; of who you are in him, &gt;&gt; then you are living way below the privileges that you have been given. That he wants you to live. He doesn't want you to live just halfway. &gt;&gt; He said, I would I would that you have life and have it &gt;&gt; more abundantly. &gt;&gt; It's it's not just barely getting by. It's abundant life. &gt;&gt; That's the life that he has given to you and me. &gt;&gt; It's It's not that we have, as I said before, we we're not supposed to stay in that popper mentality. &gt;&gt; Step into your position &gt;&gt; as king and priest. Step into the position as sons and daughters of God. Take his word in your mouth and speak his word with the authority that he has vested within you that he has commissioned you to use. &gt;&gt; He put it there. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Now, if I if I was to try to go out to the road, like I said, as that police officer, and I walk out and I'm just in in just normal clothes and I walked there and put my hand up, guess what? They're just going to keep blowing on by me. &gt;&gt; But I if I go out there and I actually use what's been given to me and I stand up and I flash that in front of them. Guess what? They're going to apply their brakes and they're going to come to a screech and halt. &gt;&gt; And that's what has to happen for us. We have to put the devil in his place. &gt;&gt; But the only way you're going to put him in his place is you better know your place. &gt;&gt; If you don't know your place, &gt;&gt; everything is going to get out of whack. You must know your position. You must know the will of the father. &gt;&gt; And then you must operate within that will. &gt;&gt; I've got to skip down some. I got to I've got to skip some. You know, they they came to um they they came to Peter um Annis and Caiaphas and the different ones uh the Sadducees. They they came to to Peter and they they threw up this at him. Well, by what power, by what name have you done this? His response was, "By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, &gt;&gt; whom God raised from the dead, even by him do this man stand here before you whole." Amen. &gt;&gt; Another reference to the message from brother Wesley. This is the stone which the builders This is the stone which was set at not of you builders which has become the head of the corner. &gt;&gt; Peter wasn't ashamed to say that it wasn't done by him. &gt;&gt; Peter wasn't trying to take credit. Peter wasn't trying to make a name for himself. He wasn't going to stand up in front of them and and say, "I did it. &gt;&gt; It was all me. All me." No. He said it was by his name. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where power lies. &gt;&gt; Power lies in the name of Jesus. It don't lie in my name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It don't lie in your name. in power lies in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; It wasn't his power that had been given. It was the authority to speak the name of Jesus &gt;&gt; over any situation. You've been given that power. You've been given that authority to speak his name over any situation &gt;&gt; and watch it be resolved. &gt;&gt; But we have to put it into action. You you don't want to just, you know, it you don't want to just keep it in your pocket. &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't do any good if it just stays in your pocket. &gt;&gt; It doesn't do any good if you study and you read. That's great. But until you speak it, &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; that's that's where the power lies. It's in the spoken word. &gt;&gt; The Rama. That's whenever that's that's whenever things take place. Whenever you speak his word, &gt;&gt; reading his word is great. dwelling in his presence. You need to &gt;&gt; but you have to speak his word. &gt;&gt; That's whenever it t that's whenever action happens is by speaking his word. It was demonstrated in um Mark 11 um when when Jesus spoke to the fig tree. You know it said in um in Mark 11:20-24 said in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. Peter calling to remembrance saith to him, Master, behold the fig tree which thou cursseth is withered away. Jesus answering saith unto him, have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, that's just too simple." Well, that's that was the words of Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you that whosoever How many whosoevers do we have? Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, &gt;&gt; be thou removed, &gt;&gt; and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt. It's key. Shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them. &gt;&gt; It's important to believe. It's important to know his will. It's imperative that you walk in his will. &gt;&gt; Imperative. That's the only way it happens. It's the only way it works. It must be in alignment with his will. And I tell you tonight, I I believe that we're living below our privileges. &gt;&gt; He He has given so much to us. He has offered so much to us. He has placed so many things before us and yet we don't take advantage of our position and the authority that we have with his word. We were not made to be defeated Christians. &gt;&gt; We're not made to be a defeated individual. &gt;&gt; Brother Benjamin Benjamin sing the song this evening. I was made for more. &gt;&gt; See, brother Benjamin didn't know what I was preaching tonight. God did. I I I sent him a text this afternoon and I said um said, "Hey, is there a chance that you could sing?" I said, "Well, I I think the way I phrased it, do you do you have the song Made for More in in your things songs that you plan to sing this this week or I forgot exactly how I word it. I could pull it back up, but something to that that effect." And um I said because I I would love for you to sing that song this evening at the end of service. And his response was, "Well, I I already was thinking about singing that song, but would it be okay if I went ahead and sang it at the beginning of service and then we could follow up with it at the end of service?" And he said, "Would that is that going to affect anything?" I said, "No, not anything. To me, it just solidifies that that was what God wanted done &gt;&gt; because he didn't know that I was going to send him a text and ask could he sing that song because I know that I was made for more. &gt;&gt; I know that you are made for more &gt;&gt; and there's more for you to be had tonight. If you will choose to walk in what God has given to you, &gt;&gt; we we we don't have to to barely get by in our spiritual walk. &gt;&gt; He has given you such a higher level that he wants you to step into. &gt;&gt; Such a higher level of praise. &gt;&gt; And then whenever you enter into that level, there's it it's limitless to what God can do. when you enter in to those places with him. He'd say, "Brother Brandham, um he he made a comment on and and I don't even know if uh if I wrote down where it was at. It's okay. If you need me to find it, I'll find it for you. If you don't trust me, he he said, "Get some spunk about you." You can you can search for that word spunk. Get some spunk about you. Stand up and claim your God-given privileges. God promised you healing. It's yours. &gt;&gt; He's promised it to you. It's yours. Get some spunk about you and claim it. Take hold of it. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; You're not going to take what's mine away from me. I know it's mine. I I I guarantee you, you take some of these the little ones that's in here and they've they've gotten to that place. It only takes them about about 18 months of life. 18 to 24 months. Maybe not even that long, but at least no no longer than 18 months. And they understand the word mine. &gt;&gt; Cuz you go to take something away from them. Mine. Or their brother or sister tries to take something from them and it's mine. &gt;&gt; Mine. Mine. It's mine. Every single promise &gt;&gt; that's in this book is mine. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be like that 2-year-old and like my three-year-old that's going to fight you over it. &gt;&gt; You try to take it away from me, I'm going to come at you and I'm going to say, "No, it's mine. &gt;&gt; You can claim it for yourself, but that's mine." &gt;&gt; Why? Why can't we have that spunk about us as adults? &gt;&gt; I think we should. We have to. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have to sir. &gt;&gt; We We've got to come to that place that we say, "It's mine. I see where he gave it to me and it's mine." Brother Brandon would talk about if you if if you were given a like a a big warehouse or something and that it was given to you, he said, "I would walk every corner of it. I would open up every box." Now, I'm paraphrasing, but I would go through every every place in there and check it out. So, I want to know what's mine. I want to know what's mine. &gt;&gt; I want to open up every single page and read it and take it in and eat it and know what's mine. And then I'm going to act upon what's mine. &gt;&gt; It's my inheritance. &gt;&gt; It was given to me. &gt;&gt; My name is written in the will. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Your name is written in the will, too. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go through here and spend all the time to tell you what's yours. But I'm going to tell me what's mine. &gt;&gt; When I go to listen and I want to read the will, I've got a copy of my father's will. I keep it in a safe spot cuz I can open up that and I can read it and I can see the things that he has said upon my death. This you're going to receive this. You're going to receive this. You're going to receive this. You're going to receive this. &gt;&gt; He died for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he rose again. And he gave you so many promises. &gt;&gt; Don't be lax. Don't be slack in reading it and receiving what's yours. &gt;&gt; Get some spunk about you. &gt;&gt; Could I ask the musicians to come this evening? And I want to I want to to to end with with with just a uh just a couple more words if they would come and if brother Benjamin would uh would would come and and if he could sing that song again for us this evening. Not him just sing it but lead us within that song. In the message believest thou this brother Ram said the coming of the Lord is at hand. The church ought to be moving on into their powers. &gt;&gt; Science can only climb so far and then it has to drop off. &gt;&gt; But we got untapped &gt;&gt; sources. &gt;&gt; That's never been touched of the power unlimited of God that we ought to be moving into. He said, "We're living a million miles under our privilege tonight of privileges of Christians to be enjoying." And he said, "I feel ashamed of myself." This is Brother Brandham. "I feel ashamed of myself when I look out here and see the institutions and the sickness and the troubles that's going on right now. Our church ought to be walking the street, healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, doing signs and wonders, making the whole world realize that Jesus Christ lives. &gt;&gt; He lives. &gt;&gt; He lives. &gt;&gt; He lives. &gt;&gt; He lives in me. &gt;&gt; He needs to live in you, too. &gt;&gt; And if he lives, you should be saying the same thing. He lives. He's just not he's not a story in a book. &gt;&gt; He's a living word &gt;&gt; and he's living in a bride of this day. He's living in you and me. And there's a work for us to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's authority that we've been given. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've been given the the authority to use the word to speak to whatever problem, to whatever situation is standing in front of you right now. Right. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is. &gt;&gt; We sang we sang this the the song when I began. Speak to the mountain. &gt;&gt; You may have a mountain. Now, some of you may not have anything that's in front of you. May maybe maybe everything is smooth for you right now, but I guarantee you that there are those in this church tonight that have a mountain and stand in front of them. Sure. &gt;&gt; But through his word, &gt;&gt; through his word, &gt;&gt; you can speak to that mountain. &gt;&gt; And it may be only one pebble &gt;&gt; that moves. &gt;&gt; And you may it may not look like anything is happening, but give it time. Yes. &gt;&gt; Keep speaking to it &gt;&gt; and speak believing. Don't let unbelief creep in at all. &gt;&gt; You must cast unbelief aside. &gt;&gt; Whenever you speak to it, it must be spoken in faith. &gt;&gt; It most must be spoken in faith believing that it's going to take place. &gt;&gt; It can't be a hope so. Can't be a maybe so. It's I know that by his word I can claim these things. &gt;&gt; We have been made for so much more. Would you stand with me this evening? Would you please receive the power and authority that he has vested into you this evening? Walk into it. Step into it. Use it. Get some spunk about you &gt;&gt; and speak it. &gt;&gt; Step into your position tonight. Speak the name of Jesus over every situation. &gt;&gt; Every situation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We must speak his name. Speak through his word in accordance with his will. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Benjamin. Please sing. Cuz I know who I am. Cuz I know who you are. The cross of salvation is only the start.
