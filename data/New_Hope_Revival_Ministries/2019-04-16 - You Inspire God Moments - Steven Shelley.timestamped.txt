[0:00] I'm a healer I need to heal I'm a savior
[0:04] I need to say I'm a deliverer I'm only a
[0:07] piece when I'm delivering in this what
[0:12] we know about God
[0:27] we can do something that inspires the
[0:32] Lord that causes him to aiza
[0:36] Oh Lord arise to your rest how many of
[0:40] you know God's idea of rest is not like
[0:42] your idea of rest my idea of rest is
[0:45] like a nap God's idea of her ass is let
[0:50] me get up there in the praises that
[0:52] might be help me now let me get up there
[0:56] and abide in the praises of my people so
[0:59] that I can be Who I am
[1:04] Savior I need to say peace when I'm
[1:10] delivering in this what we know about
[1:14] God didn't the Prophet tell us that from
[1:17] the beginning before he was worshipped
[1:19] as God all of these attributes were in
[1:22] him it was in him to be a healer it was
[1:26] in him to be a savior but he wasn't able
[1:29] to do any of those things until there
[1:31] was someone first to acknowledge him as
[1:34] God and when somebody started
[1:36] acknowledging him as God and praising
[1:39] him as God and moving around the throne
[1:42] acknowledging him as God it loosed him
[1:48] it loosed him to be God
