[1:08:57] bar or the businessman tied to her

[1:09:19] care The Cry of my heart before I depart
[1:09:24] is to find my lost sister out
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:35] there I've forgotten the last
[1:09:40] verse but I'm going to leave it there
[1:09:43] okay because here we are we're here for
[1:09:46] a
[1:09:48] purpose and the purpose is to shed God's
[1:09:52] love listen
[1:10:01] the reason you experience things the
[1:10:04] reason you go through
[1:10:06] trials is to learn something about God
[1:10:09] that's right and you're learning
[1:10:10] something about God not so that you can
[1:10:12] learn something about God you're
[1:10:14] learning something about God so you can
[1:10:17] share something about God that's right
[1:10:20] and uh I have this little thought on my
[1:10:24] heart that that I'm going to
[1:10:27] share feel encouraged about it
[1:10:30] because when uh when I was in the back
[1:10:33] room listening there though the one
[1:10:35] thing that I heard was the brother say
[1:10:37] uh May the coal of fire touch him you
[1:10:41] said
[1:10:42] that and I'm going to minister on coals
[1:10:44] of fire this
[1:10:45] morning
[1:10:48] so uh so we're going to
[1:10:50] start in Hebrews chapter 9 from verse 1
[1:10:56] and we're going to trust that the Lord
[1:10:58] will be with us
[1:11:04] yes praise the
[1:11:14] Lord says then verily the first Covenant
[1:11:17] also had ordinance of of design service
[1:11:22] and a worldly Sanctuary right for there
[1:11:25] was was a tabernacle made the first
[1:11:28] wherein was the Candlestick the table
[1:11:30] and the showbread which is called The
[1:11:32] Sanctuary yes and after the second Veil
[1:11:36] The Tabernacle which is called the
[1:11:37] holiest of all which had the golden
[1:11:41] sensor the Ark of the Covenant overlaid
[1:11:43] round about with gold wherein was the
[1:11:46] golden pot that had Manor yes sir and
[1:11:49] Aaron's Rod that budded in the tables of
[1:11:51] the
[1:11:52] Covenant and over it the cherubims of
[1:11:54] Glory G shadowing The Mercy Seat of
[1:11:58] which we cannot now speak
[1:12:01] particularly now when these things were
[1:12:04] thus ordained the priests went always
[1:12:07] into the first Tabernacle accomplishing
[1:12:09] the service of God yes but into the
[1:12:11] second went the high priest alone once
[1:12:14] every year not without blood which he
[1:12:16] offered for himself yes and for the
[1:12:19] errors of the people the Holy Ghost this
[1:12:22] signifying that the way into the holiest
[1:12:24] of all was not not yet manifest while as
[1:12:26] the first Tabernacle was
[1:12:28] standing which was a figure for the time
[1:12:31] then
[1:12:32] present which in
[1:12:36] which were offered both gifts and
[1:12:38] sacrifices that could not make him that
[1:12:41] did the service perfect as pertaining to
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:48] conscience which stood only in meats and
[1:12:50] drinks and diverse ordinances
[1:12:55] diverse Washings and carnal ordinances
[1:12:57] imposed on them until the time of the
[1:12:59] Reformation yes let's pray Heavenly
[1:13:03] Father we ask you to be with us bless
[1:13:06] your word yes sir you speak yes in Jesus
[1:13:09] name amen amen you may be seated so I
[1:13:14] know
[1:13:16] uh don't ever change unless God tells
[1:13:19] you to change okay as God puts it on
[1:13:21] your
[1:13:23] heart you're about the loudest noisiest
[1:13:25] church I've been in as far as your
[1:13:27] worship service goes that's fine don't
[1:13:30] ever change unless God puts it on your
[1:13:32] heart okay one thing you have to be is
[1:13:35] you have to be true to yourself amen and
[1:13:37] then let God change you into the image
[1:13:39] of Christ because otherwise you're
[1:13:41] changing yourself into an image that you
[1:13:43] have in your mind not the image that God
[1:13:46] has of you okay that's very important
[1:13:49] and so as we look at
[1:13:51] this we're going to
[1:13:53] see uh well I did a Bible study one time
[1:13:56] and I know you folks like uh Bible
[1:13:59] studies I know you like the uh Old
[1:14:02] Testament uh I know you've got in
[1:14:04] trouble apparently according to the
[1:14:06] pastor here for uh being too Jewish or
[1:14:10] looking at the Old
[1:14:12] Testament uh and that's fine with me you
[1:14:14] know like May May the worst of my
[1:14:17] enemies have that accusation against me
[1:14:20] that oh boy he's he likes the Bible too
[1:14:23] much especially that old Testament but
[1:14:26] we we're going to look in uh Exodus 25
[1:14:29] because I started a Bible study years
[1:14:31] ago on uh the Tabernacle because every
[1:14:35] symbol in that every unveiling in that
[1:14:38] is something that is pertinent to us
[1:14:40] because a tabernacle is a dwelling place
[1:14:43] and we are the dwelling place of God
[1:14:46] okay and there's so much amazing things
[1:14:48] it's like for example this is amazing
[1:14:51] where was the Ark of the
[1:14:53] Covenant when Jesus was
[1:14:57] crucified it was not in the holiest
[1:14:59] place of all that's right it was lost
[1:15:02] what does that mean for us really
[1:15:05] interesting okay but we're not going to
[1:15:07] look at the Ark of the Covenant too much
[1:15:09] we're going to look at the cherubs
[1:15:10] because that's where I entered into this
[1:15:13] so in Exodus 25 it talks
[1:15:17] about uh the cherubims on the ark and
[1:15:20] that's
[1:15:22] um verse uh 18 and thou shalt make two
[1:15:26] cherubims of gold of beating work shal
[1:15:29] th make them in the two ends of The
[1:15:31] Mercy Seat thou shall make the Cherub on
[1:15:34] one end and on the and the other cherub
[1:15:37] on the other end even of The Mercy Seat
[1:15:40] shall you make the cherubs on the two
[1:15:42] ends thereof and the cherubim shall
[1:15:44] stretch forth their wings on high
[1:15:46] covering the mercy seat with their wings
[1:15:49] and their faces shall be one towards the
[1:15:51] other and towards The Mercy Seat shall
[1:15:53] the faces of the Char
[1:15:55] been be thou shalt put upon The Mercy
[1:15:58] Seat above upon the Ark in the ark Thou
[1:16:02] shalt put the testimony that I shall
[1:16:05] give you amen and
[1:16:07] now and there will I meet with thee yes
[1:16:11] and I will commune with thee from Above
[1:16:14] The Mercy Seat which are between the two
[1:16:16] cherubims which are upon the
[1:16:18] ark there shall I meet with thee and
[1:16:21] wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if we
[1:16:23] could say let me order my heart in such
[1:16:27] a way yeah let me have those things in
[1:16:29] my life in such a way that in the center
[1:16:32] of my life in that Holy Place dedicated
[1:16:34] to God those cherubims or their
[1:16:37] spiritual representation is there in
[1:16:39] such a way that God is pleased to say
[1:16:41] and I'm going to come and I'm going to
[1:16:43] meet with you there in your private time
[1:16:46] of prayer when you're out on the road
[1:16:48] when you're traveling that cloud that
[1:16:50] Pillar of Fire is going with you and God
[1:16:53] says I will meet with you there
[1:16:55] you know right and that's what we're
[1:16:57] aiming for amen okay but as I studied
[1:17:01] that we were looking at the chims and
[1:17:03] I'm
[1:17:04] like let's turn to uh
[1:17:09] Ezekiel and uh chapter
[1:17:18] one so as I was doing the study we
[1:17:20] started looking at the
[1:17:22] cherubims and this is really interesting
[1:17:25] okay how many wings did the cherubims
[1:17:27] have in
[1:17:29] Revelations
[1:17:31] six but in Ezekiel how many do they have
[1:17:36] four in the Tabernacle how many do they
[1:17:40] have
[1:17:42] two is it different creatures or is it
[1:17:45] an unfolding of a revelation where God
[1:17:48] says when I give you the law you can
[1:17:52] only fly as high as two Wings will take
[1:17:54] you
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:56] when I bring you into the spirit and we
[1:17:59] bring into the realm of Prophecy now you
[1:18:01] can fly as high as six uh four wings can
[1:18:04] take you yeah and then when we end up we
[1:18:07] end up six wings and we're flying as
[1:18:10] high as we can in the spirit into the
[1:18:13] Realms of the Heavenly you see little
[1:18:15] things like that just fascinate me the
[1:18:18] unfolding mysteries of God and we can
[1:18:20] learn something in that in our lives and
[1:18:23] say Lord you know there's justification
[1:18:25] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:18:27] Spirit and those things where we climb
[1:18:29] higher and higher into the realm can we
[1:18:32] recognize in our heart where we're at
[1:18:34] with our relationship with God and say
[1:18:36] is there a higher place for me that I
[1:18:39] can attain to Lord how can I live my
[1:18:42] life in a way come on that will allow
[1:18:45] your grace to come down to lift me into
[1:18:46] that higher place okay now a lot of that
[1:18:50] is not about how can I live my life in a
[1:18:53] way that will lift me no that's right
[1:18:55] it's about how can I live my life in a
[1:18:58] way that when God comes I'm prepared for
[1:19:00] him to lift me you see CU otherwise
[1:19:04] we're trying to force and push ourselves
[1:19:07] into the kingdom and that's not what it
[1:19:09] is sir it's waiting for God to lift us
[1:19:12] to a new place but let's let's look at
[1:19:15] this
[1:19:16] okay
[1:19:18] um verse five and out of the midst
[1:19:22] thereof came the likeness of four living
[1:19:23] creatures and this was their appearance
[1:19:25] they had the likeness of a man and
[1:19:27] everyone had four faces and everyone had
[1:19:29] four
[1:19:30] wings and their feet were straight feet
[1:19:32] and the soes of their feet was like the
[1:19:34] sole of a cast foot and that sparkled
[1:19:36] like the color of burnished
[1:19:39] brass and they had on the hands they had
[1:19:44] the hands of a man under their wings on
[1:19:45] their four sides and they four had their
[1:19:48] faces in their wings and their wings
[1:19:50] were joined one to another you know and
[1:19:52] we could just drop down in depth on any
[1:19:54] one of these uh we're not going to cuz
[1:19:56] we're going to get to coals of fire okay
[1:19:59] and they went everyone straight forward
[1:20:01] they turned not as they
[1:20:03] went okay but let's let's read verse 13
[1:20:07] as for the likeness of the living
[1:20:10] creature their appearance was like
[1:20:12] burning coals of fire and like the
[1:20:14] appearance of lamps and it went up and
[1:20:17] down among the living creatures and the
[1:20:19] fire was bright and out out of the fire
[1:20:22] went forth Lightnings so I I got stuck
[1:20:25] on that word what is the appearance of
[1:20:29] burning
[1:20:30] coals
[1:20:33] now you all americ well are you all
[1:20:36] Americans most of you Americans yeah as
[1:20:39] American I'm actually American you know
[1:20:42] I took the oath of Legion summoned
[1:20:44] American citizen
[1:20:46] so when I grew up in England in the
[1:20:51] 1980s I
[1:20:53] remember I our house had a coal
[1:20:57] Burning uh furnace who else had a coal
[1:21:01] burning furnace who
[1:21:03] okay who else had coal deliveries a guy
[1:21:06] come around with a truck with a big coal
[1:21:08] bag of coal on his back you ever okay
[1:21:13] so all right so when I thought of coals
[1:21:17] I always thought coal you know guy you
[1:21:20] you throw it in the fire it burns all
[1:21:22] right it's coal but that's not the kind
[1:21:25] of Co we're talking about all right
[1:21:29] what's the kind of Co we're talking
[1:21:34] about wood who said
[1:21:37] wood 10 points
[1:21:41] okay it's wood coal all right but what
[1:21:45] does wood CO mean so I started looking
[1:21:48] into that how many people like to uh to
[1:21:52] grill to cook meat on Grill yeah any
[1:21:56] brother not waving his hand okay how
[1:21:59] many use gas grill how many use charcoal
[1:22:02] grill gas girls charcoal
[1:22:05] girls both yeah okay so the kind of coal
[1:22:11] that we're talking about that's actually
[1:22:14] charcoal the coal of fire it's wood
[1:22:17] that's turned into a coal and so I
[1:22:19] started talking uh looking into that
[1:22:24] and we can see its word because there's
[1:22:27] there's scriptures like uh Abraham when
[1:22:29] he said go and sacrifice your son make a
[1:22:31] burnt offering okay take and he took his
[1:22:34] son and he took the donkey and he took
[1:22:37] the wood car tied on the donkey and so
[1:22:41] the idea was you kill the sacrifice you
[1:22:43] put the wood under it you burn the wood
[1:22:46] okay and then watch
[1:22:50] charcoal and this this is a real
[1:22:52] blessing okay charcoal
[1:22:55] is
[1:22:56] wood you like this with all of the
[1:23:02] volatility and wetness burned out of
[1:23:06] it
[1:23:08] okay so when you've got wood it's got
[1:23:12] oils from the tree it's got moisture
[1:23:14] from the tree you put it on the fire and
[1:23:18] if it's a really wet piece of wood it
[1:23:20] smokes like anything okay you see yellow
[1:23:23] flames popping up what's that that's all
[1:23:26] of the oil that's all of the water being
[1:23:30] burnt out of the volatile stuff being
[1:23:33] burned out of and when all that's burned
[1:23:36] out you're left with a coals of fire
[1:23:40] that's it you're left with
[1:23:42] charcoal
[1:23:44] okay
[1:23:47] and I just H that really excited me
[1:23:51] because you know wood represents
[1:23:53] Humanity right
[1:23:55] okay and so if you're in service for God
[1:23:57] if you need to be that coal of fire like
[1:24:00] you need to be a piece of wood with all
[1:24:04] the volatility burnt out of it all
[1:24:09] right because
[1:24:12] charcoal Burns hotter than
[1:24:16] wood okay it's only got the carbon in it
[1:24:21] all right charcoal also Burns with no
[1:24:25] visible
[1:24:27] flame it just kind of glows that's right
[1:24:31] charal Burns consistently calls a fire
[1:24:36] you know if if you're
[1:24:38] um you you you can take charcoal you can
[1:24:41] spray water on it and it will just you
[1:24:43] know it'll hiss and then the it'll come
[1:24:46] back and it'll start burning again Burns
[1:24:49] consistently and charcoal burns with no
[1:24:53] smoke
[1:24:55] no
[1:24:56] pollution in that
[1:25:00] okay charos is one of the most
[1:25:04] historically
[1:25:06] valuable pieces of uh
[1:25:11] human
[1:25:13] civilization you know
[1:25:15] why
[1:25:18] anyone charcoal is the only
[1:25:21] thing until the discovery of coal and
[1:25:25] oil and electricity but charcoal is the
[1:25:28] only thing that burns hot enough to melt
[1:25:32] metal you can't forge and shape metal
[1:25:36] wow without charcoal well until you know
[1:25:39] modern times the invention of coal and
[1:25:41] so on so when we're talking about a
[1:25:44] sword being made when we're talking
[1:25:45] about a plow the tools that you need to
[1:25:48] to maintain to to bring
[1:25:51] life
[1:25:53] charcoal is is vital to that because
[1:25:57] nothing else Burns hot
[1:26:01] enough in fact there there was a really
[1:26:03] interesting uh true story I read about
[1:26:07] uh World War II and a Russian uh tanker
[1:26:10] unit in World War II that was uh they
[1:26:13] had us Sherman
[1:26:16] tanks and uh they were out uh you know
[1:26:20] fighting the war against the Germans and
[1:26:22] one of the pieces on the tank broke and
[1:26:26] one of the tankers was a blacksmith or
[1:26:28] had some metal working he went they got
[1:26:31] wood they put it into the blacksmith
[1:26:34] shop in the local Village and they got
[1:26:36] the Bellows they got it hot enough that
[1:26:39] they could Forge weld this piece of
[1:26:41] metal that had broken on the tank and
[1:26:43] put it back on the tank and keep going
[1:26:45] and he could do that with wood but not
[1:26:47] with wood just wood but you've got to
[1:26:50] reduce it down to those burning coals
[1:26:53] then put air on it now it's hot enough
[1:26:55] that you can
[1:26:56] actually melt and work
[1:27:00] metal okay so now we want to
[1:27:05] think that's quite
[1:27:08] something even says it in the scripture
[1:27:10] let's look in Isaiah uh
[1:27:13] chapter um 54 verse 16
[1:27:26] all
[1:27:28] right it says behold they shall surely
[1:27:32] gather together but not by me whosoever
[1:27:35] Shall Gather together against thee shall
[1:27:37] fool for thy sake behold I have created
[1:27:41] the Smith that bloweth the coals in the
[1:27:43] fire and that bringeth forth an
[1:27:45] instrument for his work and I have
[1:27:47] created the waster to destroy no weapon
[1:27:50] that is formed against the shall prosper
[1:27:52] you see amen and so you can see now that
[1:27:58] putting air on that heats the metal up
[1:28:00] hot enough that you can actually work
[1:28:05] him and that that's has has a really in
[1:28:08] okay let's turn to Proverbs chapter
[1:28:19] 25 verse 21 it says If thy enemy be
[1:28:22] hungry give him bread to eat eat and if
[1:28:24] he be thirsty give him water to drink
[1:28:27] for Thou shalt heat coals of fire upon
[1:28:29] his head and the Lord shall reward thee
[1:28:31] what is a strange scripture if you think
[1:28:33] about it it's like I've got an enemy I'm
[1:28:36] going to be nice to him to Heap coals of
[1:28:38] fire on his head watch him
[1:28:44] Sizzle but it's not that it's not that
[1:28:47] it's I shall Heap those coals of fire
[1:28:49] upon his head watch him melt watch him
[1:28:53] become off so the Lord can change him
[1:28:56] and this is what we want to be we want
[1:28:58] to be the
[1:28:59] vehicles of God's change to others we
[1:29:03] want to be those people that you know
[1:29:06] how you you've got charcoal in the grill
[1:29:08] and you blow on it and and it heats up
[1:29:11] we want to be those people that God can
[1:29:14] blow on and just heats up and those that
[1:29:17] we come in contact with will be softened
[1:29:20] by that experience we'll be lit on fire
[1:29:23] by that experience you
[1:29:27] know that's what we want to be and how
[1:29:29] do we do that by becoming coals of fire
[1:29:33] not just dry pieces of wood but you need
[1:29:36] a dry piece of wood to create a coal of
[1:29:39] fire okay but the first thing you're
[1:29:41] going to
[1:29:43] get is a lot of that volatility coming
[1:29:46] out that yellow flame and I thought oh
[1:29:48] my goodness look at me when I get under
[1:29:50] a little pressure and I it's like what's
[1:29:53] that that's the vol ility coming out
[1:29:55] that's a sign that God is saying there's
[1:29:57] something in you I need to work on
[1:30:00] because that particular place I can't
[1:30:03] turn into a coal of fire that's useful
[1:30:06] because it's too
[1:30:07] volatile all right so we want to be
[1:30:10] useful for God so yes sir how many
[1:30:14] people know how charcoal is made
[1:30:17] anyone I looked you okay how's it made
[1:30:32] it's exactly right okay did did you all
[1:30:36] hear
[1:30:36] him okay so there used to be people
[1:30:40] whose job it was to make
[1:30:43] charcoal and and in England there's the
[1:30:45] charcoal burner pits in and so what you
[1:30:48] do is you take the wood you you stack it
[1:30:50] up and then you cover it completely in
[1:30:53] the dark you make sure there's just a
[1:30:55] little bit of uh ventilation you light
[1:30:58] fire to it and it burns and it smolders
[1:31:02] for days and days and days and you got
[1:31:05] to watch that fire because if too much
[1:31:08] air gets in it it catches fire and it
[1:31:11] will actually Destro so you're trying to
[1:31:12] burn off the volatility without burning
[1:31:15] out the carbon the charcoal it was a
[1:31:19] skill okay that died out probably 2300
[1:31:24] years ago when um you know coal other
[1:31:28] sources of power were
[1:31:32] discovered
[1:31:34] so we make
[1:31:39] charcoal twice
[1:31:42] burnt in the dark with no
[1:31:46] air if you ever felt like you've been in
[1:31:49] the
[1:31:50] dark with no air everything everything's
[1:31:54] just burning
[1:31:55] up there's no light anywhere that you
[1:31:58] can see and you're just there suffering
[1:32:00] and you're like God I don't know why am
[1:32:02] I going through this what are you doing
[1:32:04] in me you have no
[1:32:06] idea all right maybe you get angry oh
[1:32:10] this is unfair I believed in you God and
[1:32:12] this is unfair and it's like okay that's
[1:32:15] fine God is like yeah that's just the
[1:32:18] volatility coming out needs to bake for
[1:32:21] a few more
[1:32:22] days okay
[1:32:25] because God has a purpose for you he has
[1:32:27] an end in mind for you and he has a
[1:32:30] process by which he is going to shape
[1:32:33] you into what you need to be it's not
[1:32:36] necessarily going to be nice and easy
[1:32:38] you might have to be in the dark burning
[1:32:42] with no air for quite a
[1:32:45] while but if you want to be a coal of
[1:32:47] fire you need to be twice burned twice
[1:32:50] burned all right twice burn
[1:32:55] burn once in
[1:32:57] preparation and once in
[1:33:00] service all right let's have a look in
[1:33:03] uh Exodus again chapter
[1:33:06] 2 we'll look at some of these people
[1:33:08] that have been twice
[1:33:14] burned you know the story of
[1:33:18] Moses but let's have a look at verse 11
[1:33:20] I'm not going to do the whole
[1:33:22] thing it says but it came to pass in
[1:33:25] those days when Moses was grown that he
[1:33:27] went out to his Brethren and he looked
[1:33:29] on their burdens and he spied an
[1:33:31] Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his
[1:33:34] Brethren oh and he was on fire for
[1:33:37] God okay he knew his
[1:33:40] mission how could he not he'd been
[1:33:42] brought up by his mother Moses you're
[1:33:44] here for a very special purpose Moses
[1:33:47] the deliver is coming Moses God has
[1:33:50] protected you Moses God has put you in
[1:33:52] the house of pharaoh
[1:33:54] Moses yeah yeah and Moses was like Now's
[1:33:58] the
[1:33:59] Time he Now's the Time I can build I'm
[1:34:02] 40 years old I've got the wisdom I've
[1:34:04] got the experience I've built everything
[1:34:07] that I need to do and we're going to
[1:34:08] start ourselves a nice little slave
[1:34:10] rebellion
[1:34:11] here okay we're going to find a way to
[1:34:15] do this the first thing I'm going to
[1:34:17] need to do is I'm going to need to win
[1:34:19] those hearts and Minds I'm no need so he
[1:34:22] goes out and he slay slays the Egyptian
[1:34:24] kills him hides him in the sand and it's
[1:34:27] like step one completed and nobody
[1:34:30] noticed all right and what was it it was
[1:34:35] Moses volatility coming out in that
[1:34:38] burning he was trying to do God's will
[1:34:42] yes on he had the right goal the right
[1:34:44] purpose in mind but he hadn't been twice
[1:34:47] burnt yet and so as he did this the fire
[1:34:51] that came out of him it was full of
[1:34:53] noxious fumes you know uh the charcoal
[1:34:55] burners people would die if you went
[1:34:58] over that pit because of all the
[1:35:00] impurities being burned out of the
[1:35:02] ground it was a dangerous unhealthy job
[1:35:05] like most jobs were back then okay and
[1:35:09] you could die from those fumes because
[1:35:11] it would burn out all the bad stuff just
[1:35:14] leave the carbon behind all right yeah
[1:35:18] and so here's Moses and he's burning and
[1:35:20] he's on fire and he's trying to do
[1:35:22] something for God and he's all
[1:35:24] all heated up and on fire and he goes
[1:35:26] out and and what comes out his fleshly
[1:35:29] volatility wow and because it came out
[1:35:31] in his flesh he said okay this thing is
[1:35:34] come known and he runs away and God
[1:35:37] leaves him baking in the wilderness till
[1:35:40] he's baked out all of the
[1:35:43] impurities and then he says to
[1:35:46] Moses Now's the Time to
[1:35:49] go now I baked out all of your
[1:35:52] volatility now you don't even want to go
[1:35:55] Now's the Time all right and
[1:35:59] so so let's let's turn over a few pages
[1:36:02] we won't do the whole story but let's
[1:36:04] turn over a few pages to Exodus 14
[1:36:07] brother all right so lots of things
[1:36:09] happened to
[1:36:11] Moses I love the the phrase Moses was
[1:36:14] Meek above every man in the world you
[1:36:17] know what that
[1:36:18] means to be meek isn't to be like timid
[1:36:21] and shy to be is to be dependent on God
[1:36:25] yes to know that my strength is in God
[1:36:28] that's right okay
[1:36:31] and so here we are oh I love this you
[1:36:36] know
[1:36:38] um do you guys sing that song God any
[1:36:41] rivers you think are
[1:36:43] uncrossable okay I love that song all
[1:36:46] right uh there's a phrase
[1:36:49] there
[1:36:51] um God is the same
[1:36:54] his word is
[1:36:55] Dependable he'll make a way through the
[1:36:58] waters for you life situations by him
[1:37:02] are remendable right mountains and Hills
[1:37:05] he will part for you
[1:37:06] too
[1:37:08] okay life situations by him are
[1:37:10] amendable you know and that made me
[1:37:12] think of the Constitution of the United
[1:37:15] States of
[1:37:16] America and it was written and it was a
[1:37:19] good document but they got there and
[1:37:20] they're like hm that's a good document
[1:37:23] is a good foundation but there are some
[1:37:25] changes we want to make to that document
[1:37:28] and so we're going to get together and
[1:37:29] we're going to we're going to propose an
[1:37:32] amendment all right what situation do
[1:37:36] you have in your life where you would
[1:37:39] like to propose an amendment you know
[1:37:42] Lord I've read the terms and conditions
[1:37:44] of my life at the moment and I can see
[1:37:46] I'm suffering a little more than I'd
[1:37:48] like to I would like to propose an
[1:37:52] amendment okay
[1:37:54] all right the devil is going to vote nay
[1:37:57] we do not want that Amendment you're
[1:38:00] going to vote Yes I want that Amendment
[1:38:04] the deciding vote is God Amen he may say
[1:38:07] no at this time we're going to table
[1:38:09] that Amendment for a later date because
[1:38:12] I'm bringing you through something or
[1:38:14] you may say yes I will I that's a good
[1:38:18] Amendment let's do
[1:38:19] it okay and vote for the amendment but
[1:38:23] brother and sisters if you look at your
[1:38:26] life and you don't propose any
[1:38:29] amendments no one's ever going to vote
[1:38:31] on them on and if no one ever votes on
[1:38:34] them your life isn't going to
[1:38:38] change so here's Moses and the children
[1:38:42] of Israel God you know God loves The
[1:38:45] Impossible okay oh I love this God loves
[1:38:48] The Impossible all right so the first
[1:38:50] thing he says is okay how can I make
[1:38:54] this how can I make this impossible it's
[1:38:56] like I take a bunch of slaves out and I
[1:38:58] will lead them down into the desert
[1:39:00] where they're trapped by the hills
[1:39:02] that's pretty hard how will they get out
[1:39:04] I put the Egyptians behind them the most
[1:39:07] fearsome army in the world at that time
[1:39:10] I'll put the Egyptians behind them what
[1:39:12] else can I do to them I'll make them
[1:39:14] wait you know and I'll give Pharaoh
[1:39:17] blood lust for them and the Sea will be
[1:39:20] behind them the mountains will be in
[1:39:21] front of them the Chariots will be up
[1:39:23] there and there'll just be this cloud in
[1:39:25] the
[1:39:26] way like yeah now I like the odds
[1:39:31] because you know if I'd given them all
[1:39:33] swords and Spears and I I wouldn't like
[1:39:36] those odds yeah
[1:39:40] so verse 9 of Exodus
[1:39:43] 14 but the Egyptians pursued after them
[1:39:45] and all the horses and Chariots of
[1:39:47] pharaoh and his Horsemen and his army
[1:39:49] and overtook them encamping by the Sea
[1:39:52] beside pyro before
[1:39:55] bezon and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the
[1:39:58] children of Israel lifted up their eyes
[1:40:00] and behold the Egyptians marched after
[1:40:03] them and they were sore afraid and the
[1:40:05] children of Israel Cried Out unto the
[1:40:07] Lord they said unto Moses okay now look
[1:40:10] at this this is really interesting
[1:40:12] because this has applications for our
[1:40:15] situation as well
[1:40:19] okay the Lord did not choose a people
[1:40:23] that that were full of
[1:40:25] Faith all
[1:40:27] right he chose a people that were a
[1:40:31] people that had a few faithful people in
[1:40:34] it the Lord didn't choose disciples that
[1:40:37] were full of
[1:40:39] Faith
[1:40:40] okay you you want to know how to be in
[1:40:43] the Rapture just be close to God all
[1:40:46] right if you're a good friend of gods
[1:40:48] you could to be totally oblivious to
[1:40:51] anything going on like the disciples
[1:40:52] were oh
[1:40:53] Jesus told them I'm going to go to
[1:40:55] Jerusalem I'm going to die they're going
[1:40:57] to kill me but I'll rise again they're
[1:40:59] like
[1:41:00] yeah yeah that's good and the Bible says
[1:41:04] they were afraid to ask him what he
[1:41:06] meant it sounds really simple what did
[1:41:09] you mean why because God hid it from
[1:41:11] them why did God hide it from him to
[1:41:13] show us listen you don't have to
[1:41:14] understand it in order to get there you
[1:41:17] just have to be close to
[1:41:19] Jesus and so he rises from the dead and
[1:41:23] he appears to the women and they go down
[1:41:26] they tell the disciples we've seen Jesus
[1:41:29] and they're
[1:41:32] like
[1:41:33] yeah okay they weren't like wow praise
[1:41:38] God we've just been having a prayer
[1:41:39] meeting we know that's look at all the
[1:41:41] scriptures that have been fulfilled look
[1:41:43] at what's going on no they were like I
[1:41:47] don't believe
[1:41:48] you
[1:41:50] okay and eventually Jesus comes to them
[1:41:53] them they're like oh oh now we believe
[1:41:56] except Thomas and there's Thomas and
[1:41:59] he's
[1:42:01] like Thomas look the sisters told you
[1:42:04] they see Jesus right Peter and John went
[1:42:08] down they couldn't find his body at the
[1:42:09] empty tomb okay it's just starting to
[1:42:11] make sense to you Thomas and we all just
[1:42:15] saw him yeah he came to us it was
[1:42:18] amazing Jesus is alive he's risen from
[1:42:21] don't you remember he said stuff like
[1:42:22] that
[1:42:23] thas was like
[1:42:28] well are you trying to prank
[1:42:31] me except I put my fingers okay yes all
[1:42:37] right so how much Faith do you need yeah
[1:42:40] as much face as Thomas had yeah because
[1:42:43] Jesus said to him you know Thomas here I
[1:42:45] am come on fingers he didn't have to but
[1:42:49] you
[1:42:50] see that's the kind of Faith you need
[1:42:53] is just enough Faith as Thomas had
[1:42:56] because if you are with God he's going
[1:42:58] to take you through you see you don't
[1:43:01] need to be like all this mountain of
[1:43:04] faith and even if you are who was the
[1:43:07] person with the most faith in Jesus
[1:43:09] disciples that we would say we would say
[1:43:12] maybe
[1:43:13] Peter walking on the water no one else
[1:43:16] did that the most Faith what happened to
[1:43:19] Peter is the only one who had the
[1:43:21] deepest betrayal
[1:43:24] let's see why that God would stand in
[1:43:28] his grace and His glory not in your
[1:43:31] faith okay so just be close to God and
[1:43:34] love him amen
[1:43:38] so so that's the children of Israel in
[1:43:42] verse 13 Moses now he's a burning coal
[1:43:45] he's had all the
[1:43:47] volatility burned out of him and Moses
[1:43:50] said unto the people fear ye not stand
[1:43:52] still see the salvation of
[1:43:56] God which he will show you this day for
[1:43:58] the Egyptians whom you have seen this
[1:44:00] day you shall see them forever no more
[1:44:03] the Lord shall fight for you and you
[1:44:05] shall hold your peace
[1:44:07] Hallelujah why cuz now he was a burning
[1:44:11] coal praise God okay those changes
[1:44:15] didn't make him flare up situations
[1:44:18] didn't change his temperature he was
[1:44:19] just on fire for God and had that
[1:44:22] confidence and was in work for God
[1:44:25] praise the Lord but he had to be buried
[1:44:28] for 40 years in the dark with no hardly
[1:44:33] any air to turn him from the volatile
[1:44:37] into the burning coal that God can use
[1:44:40] and you may be on a similar place in
[1:44:42] your journey okay and we know that it's
[1:44:45] a continual work because we know when
[1:44:48] when Moses got to uh got to the rock for
[1:44:51] the second time oh you Rebels must we
[1:44:54] bring this water out of the rock for you
[1:44:55] and he smoked the rock what happened
[1:44:57] there was a little bit of volatility
[1:45:00] left in him that it flared
[1:45:02] up and God said to him for
[1:45:05] this you can't enter into the promised
[1:45:08] land which seems like a pretty harsh
[1:45:11] judgment but to whom much is given much
[1:45:14] is
[1:45:15] required okay and Moses was a bit upset
[1:45:18] about that you can see it in the
[1:45:20] scriptures cuz every time he talks to
[1:45:22] them he's like
[1:45:23] and there God told me I couldn't have
[1:45:26] entered because of you go read it in the
[1:45:28] scriptures you'll see him he's
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:33] like
[1:45:40] okay we can talk about
[1:45:43] Jesus going through those same
[1:45:46] things going to the darkness of the
[1:45:50] Wilderness tempted of the devil
[1:45:53] before being put into
[1:45:56] service making sure that that volatility
[1:45:58] was burnt out absolutely but you see
[1:46:00] with us it's an ongoing process just as
[1:46:02] it was with Jesus because look before he
[1:46:05] went to Calvary for that service God
[1:46:08] said to him I'm going to need to make
[1:46:11] sure that you're purified again that's
[1:46:14] why brother randam says he died more in
[1:46:15] Gethsemane than he did on Calvary okay
[1:46:18] he went to another dark place he went
[1:46:21] through another fire he went through
[1:46:23] oh my brothers and sisters
[1:46:27] listen No
[1:46:34] One you don't know what Jesus did for
[1:46:37] you okay he said I'll never leave you or
[1:46:41] forsake
[1:46:42] you all right so your friends can
[1:46:45] forsake you but you'll have Jesus oh yes
[1:46:48] your family can forsake you but you'll
[1:46:51] have Jesus
[1:46:53] okay your work may go away accidents may
[1:46:57] happen but you'll have Jesus cuz he'll
[1:46:59] never leave you or forsake you you will
[1:47:01] always have that Comfort connection and
[1:47:04] Jesus was connected to God like no other
[1:47:10] man has ever
[1:47:12] been my father and I are one that was as
[1:47:15] close as he was
[1:47:19] connected
[1:47:20] and his friends left it
[1:47:24] but he was still connected with
[1:47:26] God his foes attacked him but he was
[1:47:29] still connected with
[1:47:31] God that intimate precious connection
[1:47:34] that said it doesn't matter what they do
[1:47:36] to me I'm connected with God but what he
[1:47:40] did for you was he said in this moment I
[1:47:44] will become disconnected from God
[1:47:47] yes yes yes you can only be as
[1:47:51] disconnected from somebody
[1:47:53] as you are connected to them right all
[1:47:56] right that's true if brother Shelly said
[1:48:00] Derek you're a horrible person I
[1:48:03] wouldn't take him very seriously I
[1:48:05] barely know him I like him but you
[1:48:09] know he might say that after this who
[1:48:11] knows all
[1:48:13] right but even if he were serious in
[1:48:16] doing that I it wouldn't hurt me much
[1:48:20] yeah because I I barely know him
[1:48:24] but if my wife said to me wow you're a
[1:48:27] horrible person I want to separate from
[1:48:30] you and all those years of love and
[1:48:33] closeness has just come to nothing that
[1:48:36] that would
[1:48:37] hurt all right that would hurt so you
[1:48:42] think about how much Jesus suffered when
[1:48:44] he
[1:48:46] said father why has Thou forsaken me the
[1:48:50] center of his being that relationship
[1:48:52] with God was taken away from him that he
[1:48:55] could become sin for you
[1:48:59] amen and that's that burning coal in
[1:49:02] action
[1:49:05] purified a
[1:49:07] light in service for
[1:49:17] God
[1:49:21] yeah but the nice thing about burning
[1:49:24] coals is they'll put other Co you know
[1:49:26] if you if you um if you put coals on top
[1:49:30] of burning coals they'll light the other
[1:49:31] coals right okay that heat will spread
[1:49:34] and it will light it in a way that
[1:49:35] doesn't produce more smoke and doesn't
[1:49:37] produce more fire because the volatility
[1:49:40] is been already being burnt
[1:49:43] out and so that's where we have the Holy
[1:49:46] Spirit coming well okay let's turn to
[1:49:49] Psalms
[1:49:50] 18 this is just wonderful
[1:49:55] well it's a wonderful I
[1:50:00] mean
[1:50:02] prise all right I will this is the kind
[1:50:07] of Psalm it's like how how do you pick a
[1:50:10] place to start and how do you pick a
[1:50:11] place to stop all right so but I'm going
[1:50:15] to pick a place to
[1:50:17] start the Lord let I will love the Lord
[1:50:20] he's my strength I'm in trouble he's
[1:50:23] coming down to deliver me and here's how
[1:50:26] he's
[1:50:27] coming he's not coming timidly into the
[1:50:30] situation he is coming to amend the
[1:50:34] situation all right he is coming in
[1:50:36] agreement with my prayer come on and has
[1:50:39] said yes to me Hallelujah and here he
[1:50:42] comes yeah all right in my distress I
[1:50:45] cried verse six in my distress I cried
[1:50:47] upon the Lord I Cried unto my God and he
[1:50:50] heard my voice out of his Temple My Cry
[1:50:53] came before him even to his ears then
[1:50:55] the Earth Shook and trembled listen the
[1:50:58] foundations also of the hills were moved
[1:51:01] was shaken because he was the
[1:51:05] wroth there went up a smoke out of his
[1:51:08] nostril and a fire out of his mouth and
[1:51:10] coals were kindled by it what coals okay
[1:51:14] the coals of the hearts that were
[1:51:16] prepared for God to be in action yeah
[1:51:19] here comes his voice and burning coals
[1:51:24] okay so what are you being set on fire
[1:51:27] by does the voice of God produce a
[1:51:29] burning in you and that area that's
[1:51:33] purified prise okay Lord does the voice
[1:51:36] of God produce a burning in you that
[1:51:38] says here am I I'm getting hot yeah I'm
[1:51:41] getting lit on fire I'm ready to start
[1:51:44] moving for you I'm ready to be put into
[1:51:47] your service maybe I need to be put on
[1:51:49] the head of some hard unbeliever who
[1:51:52] deep down as a Christian that I need to
[1:51:55] melt through several
[1:51:57] layers of rock hard ice to get to that
[1:52:03] place okay cuz you know what the Lord
[1:52:05] doesn't
[1:52:06] care and you shouldn't care either what
[1:52:09] happens to you right you should care
[1:52:12] what happens to other people okay so if
[1:52:15] you're going through suffering you
[1:52:17] shouldn't be like Lord why am I
[1:52:19] suffering this is too
[1:52:21] hard you should be like Lord why am I
[1:52:23] suffering who is this helping what is
[1:52:25] this doing in my life okay may maybe
[1:52:29] you're suffering because your your your
[1:52:32] volatility is being burnt out but maybe
[1:52:34] you're suffering because you're on the
[1:52:35] head of someone hard and who needs to be
[1:52:38] melted you
[1:52:40] see and so just ah just keep yourself
[1:52:44] soft all right just keep yourself
[1:52:46] looking to
[1:52:48] Jesus okay the author and finisher of
[1:52:50] our faith he's going to start it he's
[1:52:53] going to finish it and he's our example
[1:52:55] what did he
[1:52:57] do in those situations where people were
[1:53:00] against him he continued in the love of
[1:53:03] God he
[1:53:05] did
[1:53:10] okay you don't have a clock in here do
[1:53:13] you no I got a watch so that's good okay
[1:53:17] so I'm just checking on the time um
[1:53:27] all right uh let's have a look at
[1:53:30] this this is really
[1:53:33] wonderful cuse of fire in service for
[1:53:36] God all
[1:53:38] right um let's turn to
[1:53:42] Leviticus chapter
[1:53:50] 16 and it's it's a chapter that talks
[1:53:53] about the day of atonement that talks
[1:53:54] about you know Jesus saving us the
[1:53:57] scapegoat the different symbols that are
[1:53:59] on
[1:54:01] it
[1:54:03] okay and it talks
[1:54:09] about okay we need to apply this to our
[1:54:11] lives okay so incense
[1:54:16] is prayers of the Saints very good okay
[1:54:19] so intense is are
[1:54:21] prayers all right let's have a look at
[1:54:23] incense for a
[1:54:24] moment verse 11 yes and Aaron shall
[1:54:28] bring the bulock of the sin offering
[1:54:31] which is for himself shall make an
[1:54:34] atonement for himself and for his house
[1:54:35] and shall kill the bulock of the sin
[1:54:37] offering which is for himself okay so
[1:54:40] this is happening in the outer court
[1:54:42] right okay the altar of sacrifice then
[1:54:46] he
[1:54:47] says and he shall take a sensor full of
[1:54:52] burning coals from off the altar before
[1:54:54] the Lord so he's going to take those
[1:54:57] coals from out of the altar of offering
[1:55:01] burnt offering and he's going to take
[1:55:04] them into the inner place right into the
[1:55:07] place of prayer
[1:55:09] now
[1:55:14] and in his hands full of sweet incense
[1:55:18] being small to bring it within the veil
[1:55:20] and he shall put the incense on the fire
[1:55:22] before the Lord and The Cloud of the
[1:55:25] incense May cover The Mercy Seat that is
[1:55:27] upon the testimony that he die not right
[1:55:31] all right so we can talk about the
[1:55:32] incense and the prayers and we have to
[1:55:34] cover ourselves with prayers it's still
[1:55:36] true you know it's still true but this
[1:55:38] is that new thing that I told you about
[1:55:40] well I told you I had something new this
[1:55:42] is really good okay
[1:55:48] listen when you
[1:55:50] grill with charcoal
[1:55:52] which in my opinion is the nicest way
[1:55:54] you know other people may different
[1:55:57] that's all right and you you've got
[1:55:59] let's say a hamburger and it's you know
[1:56:02] like 80% fat and you put it on there or
[1:56:05] you got a steak or a sausage or whatever
[1:56:07] you put on your grill what happens as
[1:56:10] part of that cooking process is the fat
[1:56:13] inside turns to oil and then it drips
[1:56:17] down on the grill and then you get
[1:56:19] flares up okay and then you take a
[1:56:23] bottle of water and you spray it or you
[1:56:24] close the lid and make sure because you
[1:56:26] don't want that burn flavor on
[1:56:29] you you know what I'm talking about
[1:56:31] right okay think of
[1:56:35] this when you have a coal of fire it
[1:56:39] doesn't produce that flare of itself you
[1:56:41] know what is burning is what has been
[1:56:44] put on it there's nothing of itself
[1:56:48] being burned because that volatility has
[1:56:50] already been burnt out so look at this
[1:56:54] oh we are we are the wood we are the
[1:56:57] sacrifice we come with the prayers what
[1:57:00] prayers are we offering we're going to
[1:57:02] put something and smoke is going to come
[1:57:03] up if we have been properly purified and
[1:57:07] we are true calls of fire nothing of
[1:57:10] ourselves is going to flare up and Flame
[1:57:13] up and contaminate the incense and get
[1:57:16] in the way of what God is trying to do
[1:57:19] he's going to put on our heart here's
[1:57:20] the prayer that you can pray for
[1:57:22] somebody and we say let that burning
[1:57:25] coal let that incense fall on me and
[1:57:27] just reflect back into heaven nothing of
[1:57:30] myself is going to flare up and Flame so
[1:57:33] everything returned to you is just what
[1:57:35] you gave
[1:57:36] me there's nothing of myself in there
[1:57:40] and that's where we need to be in our
[1:57:42] prayers to say
[1:57:45] Lord ah there's nothing of myself in
[1:57:48] here but how often do we pray and
[1:57:51] there's something of ourselves yes how
[1:57:53] often do we
[1:57:55] pray and James says that he says you you
[1:57:58] you ask and you receive not because you
[1:58:01] ask a miss that you may consume it on
[1:58:02] your own lusts right right and your own
[1:58:06] lusts aren't necessarily oh Lord give me
[1:58:09] a million dollars or oh Lord do this or
[1:58:11] do that it's just
[1:58:14] those us come on just those little
[1:58:16] things that are are missed they're
[1:58:19] missing from the from the the word of
[1:58:21] God it's
[1:58:23] okay you know sin and
[1:58:26] archery yeah Archer sin is the term for
[1:58:30] archery that's how I I actually took up
[1:58:32] archery
[1:58:33] recently um we went a place I got a bow
[1:58:36] and I'm died it's kind of fun all right
[1:58:41] but a sin
[1:58:44] is I'm aiming at a place right and I
[1:58:48] didn't hit the place that I aing this is
[1:58:51] a sin
[1:58:53] all
[1:58:55] right
[1:58:57] um when when we drove home from here uh
[1:59:02] back 12 weeks ago we went through
[1:59:04] Chicago area we hit the
[1:59:07] tollways and they they don't have the
[1:59:09] gates anymore I've been through them
[1:59:11] once before and they have the signs up
[1:59:13] that say go here to pay online I was
[1:59:15] like okay I got to remember to go and
[1:59:17] pay
[1:59:18] online um of course we were traveling 2
[1:59:21] 3 days I forgot
[1:59:22] and last week I got a
[1:59:25] notice Illinois toway please pay the
[1:59:30] $10 that you owe for no excuse me it was
[1:59:33] the $18 that you owe for the tollway or
[1:59:36] whatever it was and the $10 admin fee
[1:59:40] that it cost you to go you know for us
[1:59:42] to send you this letter all right now
[1:59:46] that was a sin if you like I missed I
[1:59:48] forgot I still had to pay the
[1:59:50] consequence it wasn't something
[1:59:52] something I did deliberately it's not an
[1:59:53] iniquity where you say I am deliberately
[1:59:57] going to do this all right and so here's
[2:00:02] what we're looking at when we say
[2:00:03] consume on our own lust it's not saying
[2:00:06] I am
[2:00:08] deliberately going to pray that um you
[2:00:13] know brother Wesley gets paint on his
[2:00:15] shoes cuz he got paint on my shoes you
[2:00:19] know okay that that would that's a bad
[2:00:22] prayer right that's my own lust Revenge
[2:00:26] you know what I mean there it is but
[2:00:28] that's not what we're talking about
[2:00:30] those things are easy to recognize when
[2:00:32] you're praying In the Flesh what we're
[2:00:34] looking at is saying there is a mark of
[2:00:38] the prize of the high calling that I'm
[2:00:40] aiming for consistently let the words of
[2:00:43] my mouth the meditation of my heart be
[2:00:46] accept I'll give you an example okay
[2:00:48] this is how easy it is I was talking to
[2:00:50] a brother one time and he was sharing
[2:00:52] some problems and I started ministering
[2:00:54] to him and and as I ministered to him I
[2:00:57] realized that I was a
[2:01:01] channel and the words I was saying
[2:01:03] didn't come from
[2:01:05] me all right they came from the Holy
[2:01:07] Spirit to him praise God may we all be I
[2:01:12] carried on
[2:01:15] talking and then a few minutes later I
[2:01:18] realized that the words even though they
[2:01:20] sounded very much like the words I'd
[2:01:21] said before the words were coming from
[2:01:23] me not from the Holy Spirit that's a sin
[2:01:27] that's my own lust that's my own conceit
[2:01:30] and it switched from there to there cuz
[2:01:33] you could bring a problem to me and I'm
[2:01:34] a fairly smart guy and I'm a fairly
[2:01:36] experienced guy and I could give you
[2:01:38] some
[2:01:40] advice and it could ruin your life even
[2:01:42] though it sounds good and sounds holy
[2:01:44] because it's not what God
[2:01:47] said
[2:01:49] okay and so what we're looking for is
[2:01:51] saying
[2:01:53] when we
[2:01:54] pray it's got to be what God has given
[2:01:57] us the words that God has given us not
[2:02:00] our own and to do that you need to be a
[2:02:03] coal of burning fire with all that
[2:02:06] volatility burn out of you that you've
[2:02:09] spent your time in that dark
[2:02:12] place okay that you've been
[2:02:16] purified
[2:02:18] yeah that the sacrifices that are going
[2:02:21] up to heaven cuz the same thing happened
[2:02:23] with the sacrifices you know it's
[2:02:24] interesting that the um the Lord
[2:02:29] said give me the sacrifice give me the
[2:02:31] fat of the sacrifice as well right and
[2:02:34] you can imagine that burning and the fat
[2:02:36] dropping down onto that wood and the
[2:02:38] flaring up to
[2:02:41] heaven but it's flaring up to heaven
[2:02:44] with the fat of the sacrifice not with
[2:02:47] the volatility of the
[2:02:49] wood okay so what are you you're
[2:02:52] sacrificing to God how are you offering
[2:02:54] it is it with that volatility that comes
[2:02:57] from you or is it just what God has
[2:02:59] given you to offer these are the things
[2:03:02] we should consider oh my and say Lord
[2:03:04] when I look at my life yes when I see
[2:03:08] these
[2:03:10] things all
[2:03:12] right have I been purified when the coal
[2:03:16] of fire touched the prophet oh yeah yeah
[2:03:19] took a a living coal aive coal that
[2:03:23] Amber glowing Cal yes looks like it's
[2:03:26] not even burning you you know what I
[2:03:28] mean
[2:03:30] okay and that's what we should
[2:03:33] be in our day-to-day lives we shouldn't
[2:03:37] be jumping up and down screaming
[2:03:39] shouting praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:03:40] there's a time for that I'm not saying
[2:03:42] that's wrong but most of the time what
[2:03:45] happens I remember lovely well so there
[2:03:49] was a brother he just got saved he was
[2:03:51] sitting in the church and I was sitting
[2:03:53] in the church and someone was
[2:03:55] preaching and I noticed every time the
[2:03:58] Pastor said amen this brother said
[2:04:01] amen okay cuz he didn't want to say Amen
[2:04:04] to anything that the pastor didn't say
[2:04:06] Amen to what's that he's learning in
[2:04:09] baby steps
[2:04:11] okay he's in the early stages of that
[2:04:14] that his s being brought out there
[2:04:17] nothing wrong with that but what we're
[2:04:19] looking at saying is this okay
[2:04:22] okay what I say what I do is it God
[2:04:27] flowing through me have I been purified
[2:04:30] amen am I on fire to God when I explode
[2:04:33] in Praise is it something coming from
[2:04:36] inside me that's of my own
[2:04:38] lusts
[2:04:40] yeah or is it something coming from the
[2:04:43] Holy Spirit dropping that down and I'm
[2:04:45] returning it without anything of self
[2:04:48] inside
[2:04:50] okay and
[2:04:52] you know these
[2:04:54] things
[2:04:56] listen the Seal of God has this the Lord
[2:05:00] knows who are who are his right okay
[2:05:04] there's no way you can good yourself
[2:05:05] into the kingdom of God there's no way
[2:05:07] you can bad yourself out of the kingdom
[2:05:09] of God that's right okay all you're
[2:05:12] looking at saying is can I be a servant
[2:05:17] a coal of fire that's bringing warmth to
[2:05:21] others
[2:05:22] that's
[2:05:23] lighting the life of others that's
[2:05:25] melting others that's just returning to
[2:05:28] God what he drops down on me whether
[2:05:30] it's a sacrifice whether it's a prayer
[2:05:33] I'm not I'm not returning to him from my
[2:05:36] own volatility but just from that
[2:05:38] purified whatever he drops on me I can
[2:05:40] return to him in praise and glory in
[2:05:43] prayer in
[2:05:45] Thanksgiving in a way that says I am the
[2:05:48] kind of piece of wood
[2:05:52] that can bend metal and shape it into
[2:05:55] shapes tools that God needs Mount the
[2:05:58] heart of the cold Stony hearted people
[2:06:01] Jesus
[2:06:03] yes so I'd like to encourage you today
[2:06:06] whatever you're going
[2:06:07] through
[2:06:09] yeah whether it's dark and and no air
[2:06:13] whether you can't see a way out stay
[2:06:17] faithful the Lord is purifying you for a
[2:06:20] purpose he has for you l
[2:06:22] amen okay don't get
[2:06:26] discouraged well if you do get
[2:06:28] discouraged don't worry about it okay
[2:06:30] there are times when you know Christians
[2:06:32] aren't always
[2:06:34] happy all right but Christians always
[2:06:36] have that connection with Jesus Christ
[2:06:39] the center of your life amen and he's
[2:06:42] the one that will Purge you and burn out
