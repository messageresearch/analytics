[0:07] there is a union
[0:10] there is a oneness
[0:12] that this word has revealed to us in
[0:15] this hour you can be one with him you
[0:19] can be one with the word and when you
[0:22] cut off that vital union of fellowship
[0:25] with him
[0:26] you can
[0:28] do nothing
[0:31] did you know carrying a spirit
[0:34] that is not christ
[0:36] can absolutely cut us off from our place
[0:40] of union
[0:42] with him
[0:43] it's happened to every one of us
[0:45] and so i don't even believe that it
[0:46] doesn't matter whether you believe it or
[0:47] not it's happened to every one of us
[0:50] we have faced situations and
[0:52] circumstances in life where our where
[0:55] somebody's action coupled with our
[0:58] reaction has caused us to carry a spirit
[1:00] that is not christ and when we carry
[1:03] that and nurture that and and and pour
[1:07] life into that instead of into our union
[1:10] with christ
[1:12] when we hold tighter to our woundedness
[1:16] when we hold tighter to our
[1:19] our pain
[1:20] than we do to our union with christ it
[1:23] absolutely cuts us off from the joy from
[1:25] the hope from the peace
[1:29] you see we're living in this hour among
[1:31] the walking dead
[1:33] we shop with the walking dead
[1:36] we work with the walking dead
[1:39] true
[1:40] we go to church with some who are
[1:42] walking dead
[1:44] nobody has forced them into a tube no
[1:47] one has forced them to live in that cold
[1:49] cold place
[1:51] but because of some circumstance or
[1:54] something that has happened in life they
[1:56] have withdrawn themselves into a into a
[1:59] tomb
[2:00] and though they walk and though they
[2:02] function and though they move even
[2:04] though they come to church sometime the
[2:06] hollow look in their face is a testimony
[2:09] that they are no longer drinking
[2:13] they're no longer drinking from the
[2:16] blood
[2:18] they're no longer eating flesh
[2:21] that's his
[2:23] they're no longer having communion with
[2:25] christ no longer abiding no longer
[2:28] dwelling with him you can change that
[2:31] you can change that today you can change
[2:33] that today with a made-up mind i'm going
[2:36] to abide in him i'm going to dwell in
[2:38] him i'm going to live in his word i'm
[2:41] going to rest in his word i'm going to
[2:43] feast on his word hallelujah
[2:48] i'm going to let his word encourage me
[2:50] and i'm going to let it thrill me and
[2:52] i'm going to let it correct me and i'm
[2:53] going to let it direct me
[2:56] made of mine
