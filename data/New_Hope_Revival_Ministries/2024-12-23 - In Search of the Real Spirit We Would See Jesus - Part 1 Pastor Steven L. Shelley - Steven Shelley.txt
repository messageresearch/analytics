Description:
“The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.” John 12:21

In “In Search of the Real Spirit: We Would See Jesus — Part 1,” Pastor Steven L. Shelley explores the authentic pursuit of Christ beyond cultural and religious traditions. Drawing from John 12, he contrasts the Greek philosophical mindset with the need for spiritual surrender to see Jesus as He truly is. Pastor Shelley emphasizes that Christ’s glory is found in His death, burial, and resurrection, not in worldly representations, urging believers to reject distractions and embrace the transformative power of His Spirit.

I need in that Revelation is strength in that Revelation there's Grace oh my what Revelation are we talking about that God sent a prophet no we're talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is presently right now you don't have to wonder where He Is We Know by Revelation exactly where Jesus is right now he's not missing come on now we know EX exactly where he is do you know where he is he's right here he's not a million miles away he's right here the throne in the New Covenant is not a million miles away it's here the Ark of the Covenant in the New Covenant the Ark of the Covenant in the New Covenant is not a million miles away or are in Israel under the new Covenant the ark is here that's what the scripture said read Hebrews it's here he's moved in it was his desire to find a house to dwell in you may be seated just a moment I admire you for the strength the the the determination the dexterity that you show to stand and I know that some of you aren't able and we certainly would want you to take rest when you need it but I I I get to stream Services sometime when I'm doing there are particular things I can do and stream certain things you can't do I can't do accounting or bookkeeping streaming in fact sometimes Benjamin will come to ask me a question and I'll say Olivia was in my office this week doing some filing for me and uh she needed to ask me a question and I said I just give me a few minutes and when I got through I had the I had my laptop I had my phone I had two screens on the computer and I had about 15 pieces of sticky paper I had written on to solve one problem so I had to use digital and analog that's just the bur that's don't don't it's not that the problem was so complicated it's just not my forte but God is good but I have a chance to stream Services sometime and I'm just just always shocked at how folk can sing 20 minutes into a worship service all still seated I I I don't get it I just don't get it and if you're not able you're you're but I'm talking about young people kids my when I come into the presence of the Lord I don't want to I don't want to make it physical rest I I I want to give him everything I have you know brother brandom talks about how we honor the word he said if the Queen of England were to walk in you're not even a British citizen but if the Queen of England were to walk in you'd stand up you'd show her respect the office that she holds if the president were to walk in you might he might not be of your party but you'd stand up and I gave the example When Stacy and I were in Washington and and President Obama was going to speak he was not my favorite President by any means I don't like his politics never did and never will but he he was the president he was the will of the people so I stood up and showed him honor and respect because that's what we would do so how is it when the presence of the Lord starts building that that somebody wouldn't want to do something to welcome the king so I'm so thankful I started to say I'm proud of you but then someone would misunderstand that but I am very very Papa proud of you because you make every effort to give God praise to enter in and I want to thank you for that so much he's worthy he's worthy I don't seem to be hearing you I don't think my ears are stopped up but he's worthy he's worthy to be praised well I I I I won't sing we've had lots of good amazing anoint you know I just kept saying to myself the anointing when we heard these song I kept saying to myself the anointing is what makes the difference difference the anointing is what destroys the Yoke brother brandom talked about those trained singers who could hit the highest note and the lowest note and they knew how to pause and when to breathe and when to how long to hold out the note and how to make it a short note and he said but if there's no anointing there I'd nearly rather hear somebody that could barely carry a tune but get under that anointing because it's that anointing that makes it Minister life to us I said it's the anointing and the anointing is not an etherial or ethereal mist or some mystical uh something in the room the anointing is a person that's what Messiah means when when you hear Brother RJ pray in the name of Yeshua the Messiah he's identifying Jesus by his Hebrew name and he's saying he is the Messiah the Messiah he is the anointed one and that's that's so appropriate uh for what I'm going to preach today before I forget we have to say uh that we are so glad to see Jesse in service with us this morning and [Applause] we and we won't Roa to keep her mind on the Lord today and Jesse keep your mind on the Lord he's going to give you a word today but it's such a blessing to have him we've missed him uh like a toothache we've missed him we're so glad we're so glad that he's home and looking good and clean and healthy and good well there's somebody sitting with brother Truman and sister Martha that I don't quite recognize he's almost taller a little taller really I think if if brother Truman's hair wasn't sticking straight up on top there sister Martha just put it put his hair down for him there there you go there you go anybody notice it ain't going down Wesley you are one more grownup handsome man God bless you we are so glad to see you after so long he's gotten a little bulky he's not lanky anymore and uh I hear that he's quite successful at what he does may God bless him in that and we we're thankful we're glad to see you in the house of the Lord I never know when the hollow Wells are coming anymore but I'm always happy somebody came in the room and said are the hollow Welles here I said I don't know he said well it looks like his truck out there so and I'm so glad that it is God bless you all very happy that you're here we're glad you're here I want to give the musicians a thank you for what they've done in the leading of the worship he's just good isn't he uh so December 23rd uh which is tomorrow tomorrow today's the 22nd isn't it is brother RJ's birthday we were just talking about him in his prayer and uh his birthday is tomorrow and so we want to say happy birthday to him I appreciate him when we were doing the conferences and speaking in so many places around the world I used to hear them say many of the different speakers would say especially PK would say if you if you hear something that makes your inner Spirit leap or tremble or respond it's because that's a part of your destiny it's a part of your Revelation and when when RJ's leading us to the Lord uh most what I can say is amen so be it yes Lord because my heart so responds my inner spirit so responds to the truth that he is speaking when he's leading us to the lamb it it it's just a wonderful thing to know it's a wonderful thing to be reminded of the goodness of God and tomorrow is also Matthew's birthday sister Rebecca and we want to pray for him and send him a happy birthday will you please tell him that we all said happy birthday and we're praying for him he's got big decisions to make in his life uh that's the problem when you're a genius you you you got more more more uh uh problems sometimes and more uh difficult decisions to make but we pray that he will make the best decision because at the end of this race you can be highly intelligent and lost at the end of this race you can have the greatest education that money can buy and be lost I was sitting in my office today and I said one of these days those doors are going to to be locked somebody's going to come they're going to show up here perhaps some of you are going to show up here on a Sunday morning and you're going to find out the doors aren't even open maybe just a two or three four five six people I don't know how many I hope they're none but I have a feeling that's very likely that there'll be somebody out there waiting wondering what has happened and the reality will eventually strike the Rapture has happened the Overcomers are gone somebody said well what would we do then well here's the thing always to remember if you can't live for the Lord now with the Holy Ghost in This World what makes you think you would be able to live for him when he leaves here with the bride honestly any strength you have any faith you have is because the Holy Ghost is in the world brother brandham called him the restrainer and the scripture said when he that now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and the prophet tells us that when the bride leaves the Holy Ghost is going with her and he said if you think it's bad now wait until then it will be total insanity can you imagine you get the little Holy Ghost Bride out of here and there's nothing left to hold back the darkness somebody said what about the Christians who are not not Overcomers the problem with that is the spirit leaves how will they do it how will you do it I would imagine that in that day the things that matter to you so much today won't matter at all I I've got a feeling that a woman's high heel shoes or earbobs or whatever else she wants to hold on to I've got a feeling that that won't matter in that day there is no price too great to pay as an offering of Thanksgiving to the Lord for calling us out of this old world you can say Amen or oh me there's no Christmas Bobble that's going to mean more to you and shouldn't mean more to you today than your exit out of here now if there wasn't enough uh oxygen sucked out of the room already we just took the rest out so I might encourage you to take a deep breath and suck it all back in Jesus wants to talk to us today would you stand while you're standing we just say to every precious believer who is streaming this service with us today God bless you brother Edmund and Ghana we yes we will pray of course we will pray and the writers God bless you and so many more here on YouTube Morocco praise God the Netherlands uh so many joining you from the the Millers are joining us from the road in Arizona California way out on the other coast Indiana more from Ghana it just goes on God bless every one of you I don't know where Eagle EDD is from but God bless you brother and and I just can't even take the time it goes on down God bless you and everyone asking for prayer and we will certainly pray for the streamers they mean something to us today amen John chap 12 beginning in verse 20 and we have a few verses here before before we get to the red letters but long about verse 23 we start going to Red Letters you don't get to see that on the screen but those are the words of Our Lord the Bible tells us that all scripture is inspired and that it is profitable for for both reproof and Doctrine and so we love all the the letters no matter what color they are but we should pay very close attention uh to the red letters and I actually have a Bible it's too big to carry around but I actually have a Bible back there that has all the words of God both Old Testament and New Testament in red and it it really makes a difference sometime you're looking down at a page and you say my god did a whole lot of talking and not just through the prophets but he spoke in fact in John chapter 12 he spoke Right Out of Heaven and some said it thundered some weren't sure what was going on but it was God speaking to God God was speaking to the physical fleshly expression of himself the son in the earth now in chapter 20 my let me just wipe my eyes one more time they're a little bit uh Misty I guess from the tears there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast now these were Gentiles they were perhaps prelit to the Jewish faith the god of the Bible or they would not have come to worship at the feast but they were certainly Gentiles who had come to Jerusalem to worship at Passover and perhaps even uh for for Pentecost verse 2 1 the same came therefore to Phillip which was of Betha of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus I I want you to think on that sir we would see Jesus Phillip cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew and Phillip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying red letter the hour is come but that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth read it much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it all those things that matter you're going to lose him anyway one day and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me hear it and where I am there shall also my ser vant be if any man serve me him will my father honor would you permit me to read verse 26 again if any man serve me who is the me here Jesus is talking let him follow me who's the anyman me I I might as well because he was speaking to to disciples and those who were gathered there that day but if all scripture is for us and profitable for Doctrine and reprove then I can clearly say without taking this out of context if if Stephen Shelly serves me let Stephen Shelly follow me that's right let him be an imitator did you read frid's text and if you did like most people and only read the first few paragraphs you didn't get the kicker at the end I hope you read it all the way through because to follow him means to be an imitator of Christ that means walk like he walked and talk like he talk live like he lived and worship like he worshiped follow him if any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be If any man serve me him will my father honor if you believe that would you say Amen Lord Jesus we are here today without a Personal Agenda we are here to discover your agenda for us we are uh many gathered here and many more gathered around the world connected to us uh via the stream and we give thanks for the technology and we give thanks for the desire in people's hearts to be connected to this house we pray today that you will hide your servant behind the cross and that you would speak through my lips as I would surrender my thoughts and my tongue to you I pray that you would open heart with your presence Let Your Grace be so known that it compels each one of us to open up our heart and let the word in if I speak something out of the word we pray that the Holy Spirit would bring correction before we leave this house and we will give you glory and honor and praise for all that you mean to us for your wonderful words of life we bless your Holy Name we ask for your help again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah and the church said amen you may be seated many many times in the message what we call the message the recorded sermons of brother brandham he used this text many times he may have called it a few different things and then there were many times that he was preaching on something else and he would mention the Greeks and he would mention the phrase in verse 21 sir you almost always put an S on it s we would see Jesus I don't know why you came here today I don't know if you came out of a sense of obligation if you were afraid of being talked about or preached at or you're here because you think it's the right thing to do perhaps some of you came because you wanted to be here and there's nowhere else in the world you'd rather be maybe You Came To Worship maybe you came to hear a good song Maybe you came to hear the word hoping that you could Wade through all the rabbit trails and find something in the pastor's sermon that would apply to your life I I don't know why you came but I'm preaching today about a group of Gentiles I would say that in the natural most of us here are that and these were not ordinary Gentiles they were Greeks and if you know anything about the Greeks you understand that they thrive D not in um what we might say truth but in knowledge you know there's a difference you can be an educated fool uh you can know a whole lot and not know much about what really matters and some of the Greeks were like that they they were uh they wanted to to pull away from the the culture of the past as they wanted to bring their mythology with them their gods though they were intelligent they wanted to bring their gods with them into a new culture into a new Society they wanted to divorce themselves from most anything that looked like Judaism although they recognized that it was God's idea and they honored and recognized that we will say today for the sake of understanding Jehovah we know he was never called Jehovah in the Old Testament not in the New Testament it it it there's no J in the Hebrew language so some people like to say Yahweh or yve or some people just like to boil it down and say God but we know for sure that the Greeks accepted the god of the Jews as one of the gods they didn't dispute that he was real they just disputed that he was any more important than any of the other gods there's a problem there can anybody see the problem and so because they wanted to uh henize that's the word we use for for taking the truth of the god of the Bible and making it more culturally acceptable and and particularly when we're talking about the Greeks we we say the heniz of the faith meaning the greying anybody can understand that the greying of the faith uh uh mind you one of the first things they did was to make sure that uh anyone who was under the influence of the Greeks would would separate themselves from any of the Traditions or even laws of the Jews and they knew that it was uh even SP spoken of in the scripture uh for instance a man having a beard follow me are you with me a man having a beard and they they thought well we'll just make as many steps away from the the faith of the Jews as possible and one of the first things they did is they said we think that a Greek citizen should be clean shaven so that was not a Christianity idea that was a Greek influence and it's quite it was quite unnatural then it's quite unnatural now it can be painful actually you're using uh in in those days first sharp rocks and later metal blades and scraping it ac across tender skin and there may be reasons for doing it today because you you work on a job that requires it or you're in a situation that requires it somebody said my wife just doesn't like it I'm not making a Doctrine I don't think a man has to have a beard don't misunderstand me but he might but I can say that it's of a Greek idea that he shouldn't it's a Greek mentality it's not a Bible mentality it's a Greek mentality and you know we had the the Olympics and that's a Greek idea if it's a glorified emulation it's competition that gives birth to strife and many champions never make it all the way not because they're not good enough but because they're not political enough you know we just had some years ago in the in our nation this Scandal of a uh actress and her wealthy husband uh going to to jail because they paid to get their kid into an affluencer money almost bribery money hush money you pay me a certain amount I can get them in they felt like they deserve better and that happens in competition on a high school level a college level professional level and on an Olympic level so the a real Champion may never make it there because they didn't have the same privilege or connection so the whole concept now also remember that the Greeks were not for uh gender separation they really believe that uh everyone both man and woman should wear the same toga and it should look the same the Jews both wearing robes but very different robes with different styling different color uh different belting so there was a clear distinction among the Jews though they both wear robe wore robes we understand that in second temple period men were already wearing breaches underneath their robe and they got that from the from the priest who had been doing it since the time of Moses uh but the Greeks especially the Greek men they like to to go commando with no undergarment on and they like to wear a toga and this this you know white almost see-through robe and the women would do the same and and everyone sort of began to look alike and women started cutting their hair and making it kind of a bold look and men doing the same shaving their face what they were doing was they were bringing people closer to the the idea that it doesn't really matter male or female now we know what God said about that are you with me I had got to the message yet for instance Deuteronomy 22 says that everybody ought to know this it is an Abomination that word Abomination is something God hates fact Abomination is the strongest degree of abhorring or hating so if if you read something the Bible says it's an Abomination it means God hates it it doesn't mean that it's not his preference he would rather it be a certain way I'm going to depend on somebody to get in here now or it means he hates it and there are many things he hates he hates a prideful look he hates a lying tongue he says it it's an Abomination a lying tongue is an abomination ation before me a prideful look he said one that SS Discord among the Brethren gossipy throwing one another under the bus that's an Abomination unto God something that God hates but in Deuteronomy 22 and5 he said that it is an Abomination for a man to wear that which pertaineth to a woman a woman to wear that which pertaineth to a man uh let me read it someone get that for me I'm I'm going to get it backwards if I if I don't look at it say it again woman first which I thought so but let me just pull it up here just a minute uh because I want to want to lay the the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are hated it's not that God's hating the person it's the fact that God is hating that there is no differentiation between male and female the women shaving their head you know cropping their hair to look like men and the men uh doing the bangs and and the and the you know man bun today but I meant just the curly fuzzy because they need a good haircut that is not just a preference I want to tell you that it is a spirit and the Baptist wouldn't preach against it anymore the methodists wouldn't preach against it anymore Assemblies of God wouldn't preach against it anymore Church of God wouldn't preach against it even Emanuel Holiness wouldn't preach against it anymore and so now it is widely accepted for women to wear pants and it is becoming accepted for men to wear skirts I guess you'd say you don't want to go to a big city because you'll see all kinds of things men with more Gucci bags than their wives you know just odd this world is an odd place face the blending of gender is wrong God is not pleased with that and you you need to know that you're you're born male or female not not both in the eyes of God or either according to your choice in the folks don't you know that's a spirit don't you know that's demonic don't you know that's hatched out of hell it's the same demon that inspires a woman to put tarantulas on her eyes I I saw a stood in ly behind a young beautiful I guess she was beautiful I don't really know underneath all that crud and these eyelashes look like my hairbrush not natural not attract active you don't have to help me I'm going on 50 years of preaching like this and the world just eats it up I see message folks with somebody else's eyelashes on there's it's a spirit it's not natural The World Is Gone to muck and God God have mercy on anybody that decides to have a backbone and say that's not right it's not right God have mercy on somebody that says you can come for the holiday but your same seex lover is going to have to find somewhere else to sleep you're not going to sleep together in my home God have mercy if you find somebody with enough backbone to say you're not married to her so you're not going to sleep in my house in the same bed because you're not married to her I don't care whether you think I'm a fogy or whether you think I don't love my family God help us to have a real saw log for a backbone and say I don't have to do it in a hateful way I I don't have to do it in a humiliating way I can do it in a gentle way a private way a quiet way just know when you come that's right one's on the sofa if it has to be that way I think it's better they're somewhere else put them in a barn put them in the tent do whatever you have to do but if you let them sleep in the same house you're on the couch and I'm telling you if that door opens in the night you're not getting any pumpkin pie tomorrow cuz this how as for me as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord here we love you we want you to be here we want to have fun with you but right is right wo and wrong is wrong so these Greeks knew everything about being wrong homosexuality was wild under this Greek era most wealthy men men of any affluence hired boys to be at their beckon call Young unmarried clean shaven men that Greek spirit is out of hell when the Greeks were in charge the Jewish faith had to be quiet the Romans followed suit when the Romans occupied the land the Jews could not keep Sabbath they couldn't uh celebrate the Feast of the Lord they had to do everything and secret fearing their life fearing for their life simply because another culture had come to rule the day to rule the land come on now there's another culture that's trying to rule America there's another culture that's trying to rule our nation in these last days somebody's got to make a stand now these Gentiles these Greeks were probably prelit to the Jewish religion and when the scripture said they came to worship at the feast it means to prostrate themselves before the god of Israel I want to honor that I want to say that in every culture and in every backslid generation there has always been and there will always be somebody some remnant some little group of people who will say I don't care if it's legal in the law of the land if God word said it is an Abomination it's illegal in my heart in my life in my family just a minute Amen brother preach I believe I will somebody should God bless these Greeks they had heard that Jesus had raised the dead there wasn't any Greek in the library that they had studied with that had raised the dead they got pretty interested in this now if they were Gentiles that had not made a conversion to the faith of the Jewish people they would have only been allowed to Worship in the outer court but had they made full conversion and been circumcised then they would have been allowed to come as a proelite as a converted one into the faith of the Bible we say Jew but it there were no Jews it was the Hebrews it was the god of the Bible the god of the Hebrews amen and then they would be allowed and fully fully accepted in we don't know the real story behind these men but we find them interesting I find them interesting they just walk up to Philip and they say sir we would see Jesus did you know the Bible never even tells us whether or not he met with them we don't even know if he was with them in their approach Jesus may have not even been there we just know they went and told Jesus what they said and Jesus never addressed their question their their desire for an interview he BAS basically saw it as a sign that when the Gentiles began to seek for the Messiah my time is coming to an end and basically if you read on you will find out in beginning in verse 24 he says I die he just says verily I say un you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and do die it abideth alone but if it die it it bringeth forth much fruit I die he's telling them there's something about these Greeks coming and asking after me that lets me know that this is the time and if they will lose their life they'll find something and you will too but if they love it you know if they if they serve me if any man serve me let him follow me if these Greeks want an interview let him go where I go let them live like I live let them worship like I worship and everything will be all right I'm about to leave here that's powerful to me sir we would see Jesus brother brandom tells us stay with me I I hope you can handle this uh because I'm on page one Mo sir we would see Jesus the message from 54 the soul Cry of these Greeks the Greeks seek wisdom and the Jews seek signs and Paul said we preach Christ crucified we're not preaching the wisdom of man we're not preaching for signs he said we're preaching Christ crucified and the Greeks has always wanted wisdom now brother brandom uses the word wisdom there it was really a higher form of knowledge that the Greeks were after the Bible tells us if any man lack wisdom what do they do they ask God and he gives it nothing wrong with wisdom but don't think because somebody's got gray hair they've got wisdom don't think because somebody's lived on the earth 50 plus years they've got wisdom I know some pretty unwise adults just a minute Amen brother I'm not saying you're one of them I'm just saying they exist and so but these Greeks come up perhaps were prelit to the Jew Jewish religion and came up to Jerusalem to worship at the Pentecostal Feast he goes on and then while they were up there they had heard of the great Fame of this one Jesus of Nazareth his Fame had scattered everywhere many disbelieved him thousands disbelieved him but thousands believed him isn't that great to hear and it was mostly among the common people not many Greeks not many affluent mostly the Common People brother Austin as you pointed out recently who heard him and believed him mostly common people I don't care I'm not embarrassed to be associated with the common people who heard him and believed in their day I've heard him and I've believed him in my day are you with me let's go on those who were were of the other type they did not have much time for him cuz they were satisfied with their religion they liked the gods they like the idols they like the competitions and feast to their gods they like their Fine Food they like to lay down all the time any picture you see of Greek uh uh you know they're laying down like the Romans always you see pictures of the Jews the only time they relaxed was to eat the rest of the time they're out working because if a man doesn't work he doesn't eat this is what the Bible said so they were of that other type they didn't have much time for him because they were satisfied with their religion they had father fathers had been taught certain things and and they'd had their Traditions handed down and something new no matter how phenomenal it was well he tried to tell them it was in Scripture that he was to come and oh well if it was to be and the priest would know something about it and therefore they wasn't interested I don't find that hard to believe but these Greeks these Gentiles when they heard come on when they heard Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God they came wanting to see Jesus show me Jesus I just got to see Jesus I I I see you guys and you're nice and all friendly enough but I I I I've come to see Jesus I believe that has been the heart's Cry of every man every woman who's ever heard anything about Jesus Christ has had the same thing sir we would see Jesus Lord that ought to be the Cry of the Bride sir they they didn't want to learn his theology they didn't care nothing about his teaching they didn't care about whether uh what kind of clothes he wore they were only interested in one thing they didn't come to change him they came to see him they're only interested in one thing that they wanted to see Jesus he said that's the main thing that's the Cry of today are you following with me sir we would see Jesus 10 years later 1964 he said that's why these Greeks were desirous to see this man they knowed in the word you know they studied the Hebrew scripture just like they' studied Aristotle they knowed that in the word what the Messiah was supposed to be and they wanted to see him they were Gentiles they had heard about him and now what they wanted in the Mighty God unveiled before us the Greeks wanted to to see him but they were unable to see him because he was in the temple of his Humanity now now some Greeks couldn't even believe what they heard because they didn't see how God could come down and live as a man but these Greeks they wanted to see it for themselves it doesn't mean they didn't believe it it just means if this is going on and I can get enough shackles together to get over there I want to see this for myself God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now we find that that these Greeks could not see him and notice the very words that Jesus expressed to them afterwards I don't know who he was talking to afterwards but I know he was talking he said except a corn of wheat fall into the ground dies and abides alone in other words they would never be able to see him in the change and this is as long as they kept the Greek mentality they would never be able to see God in the change in the mask that he was in then in Mor because he was veiled in human flesh they wanted to see a god riding a Heavenly Chariot like Zeus or some other mythological God but here was a God in a in a in in in a in in a simple man with a simple garment he wasn't dressed like like the the noble of the day or the educated of the day or or the rich of the day he was wearing a poor man's garment no more than the Garment of a fisherman and in the Greek mentality he couldn't have any importance at all do you know we judge people that way too sometimes they're a little rag tag looking sleep in their eye Etc and we think well they couldn't be very much it's not that brother we we can't be looking at the dressing we got to be discovering the realness of the heart and so if a man approached Jesus with a Greek mindset he would not have been able to see him for who he was God in human flesh now what was his relationship to the eternal spirit of the father or what was his relationship to the logos he was son but he was God of the Same Spirit of the same Essence and now made flesh so the Greek mentality would have kept many Greeks from receiving the Lord but there were some who were so stri struck struck so struck by what they read in the Hebrew Bible in the Hebrew scriptures in the Hebrew scrolls that they knew there was a messiah coming and they begin to think perhaps he would come humble and meek and lowly and we want to see this Jesus to see if he's the one that we're looking for as the Messiah oh my which kind of Greek would you be if you're a gentile here today will you be a Greek who approaches things from a Greek mentality or will you be willing to turn uh off that that that that mentality that is the culture of the day and see him for who he really is uh not just one of the Gods but the only true Living God come on and and and he's not an idol on a shelf and he's not a baby in a manger and he's not a twisted body hanging on the cross the church wouldn't know Jes Jesus the church at large wouldn't know Jesus if he walked down the aisle that's why the Book of Revelation shows us Jesus standing on the outside not of your heart but on the outside of his church my name is above the door but and I'm knocking to get in he said If any man would come and let me in I would have I would have Fellowship I would suck with him and he with me anybody going to help me preach but the church has missed him because they have tried to approach Faith from a Greek mindset and even many around this message have approached God and the message from a Greek mindset instead of from a Jewish mindset which is a biblical mindset when we're talking about a Jewish mindset we're not talking about modern Judaism which is a sad compromise to what the scripture talks about more man's ideas more man's ideas more man's ideas we've got people some who have even worshiped with us that would tell you that that the talmud is equal to the Bible oral tradition equal to the Bible that's false there are those who would tell you that every word and every message that brother Brandon preached is equal to the Bible that's false if oral tradition repeats something that was in the scripture I say Amen if this message if brother Brandon preached something that I can find it in the word and see this great understanding I say Amen not only with my mouth but with my life you see this is my life on Monday not just on Sunday and I pray it's the same for you you can't approach Faith from a Greek mindset the Bible talks about the conflict in the prophets between the sons of Zion and the sons of Greece the Asen of which we believe John the Baptist may have found found his later home among the inin who lived in cuman between Jerusalem and the and the Dead Sea not too far out of Jericho where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered and the writings of the Dead Sea Scrolls talk much about this Warfare this conflict between the sons of light and the sons of Darkness I wonder if they were prophetically speaking about the hour that we're living in right now where there is such conflict between the sons of Light and the sons of Darkness there is so much conflict between the sons of Greece and the sons of Zion I'm a son of Zion I want to tell the world I want to tell the internet I want to tell anybody who will listen I identify as a son born on the hill of Zion I'm not a wreath wearing toga wearing clean shaven Greek I want my identity to be with the sons of Zion oh my it's getting quiet he's come to ruin our holiday he's come to ruin everything I know I knew when I came this morning they knew what Messiah was supposed to be they wanted to see if this was him in the message the unveiling of God he said the Greeks wanted to see him wait a minute let let me go back to Mighty God unveiled I didn't finish it but when this corn of wheat fell into the ground then it could bring forth all Races oh I don't want to miss that he was sent to the Jews of course at that time but this corn his life this this seed would fall into the ground veiled God God veiled in human flesh hidden from unbelievers even the Jews couldn't see him because he was veiled in human flesh but he was being revealed to Believers he was being revealed to Believers he came to the Jewish race first but he wanted to reveal himself to others but they had to come with with an open heart like the Greeks in John 12 with an open heart they had to come if they came with a Greek mindset only they would certainly Miss who he was in the unveiling of God help us get through this the Greeks wanted to see him in St John 12:20 you've heard me preach s we would see Jesus did you notice that now the Greeks were Scholars they were great men and they had a great feeling for God as Paul preached to them on Mars Hill when he said I passed by you I saw the inscription to the unknown God he said that's your problem Paul said that's your problem you don't even know the god you worship you call him God and you don't even know him you don't know what he likes you don't know what he commands you don't know what he instructs but you like to call yourself identified with God there's a lot of people who want to be identified with this message of the hour with the revelation of Jesus Christ but they don't want to pay a price when it means standing against the popular way of doing it don't you dare try to take us anywhere past Fanny Crosby you if a song wasn't written you know at least 50 years ago it's not fit for our churches isn't he the same yesterday today and forever if he ever inspired a him writer can he inspire a him writer today if he ever inspired a gospel song of worship can't he do it today somebody said some worldly group sings that song so I'm never going to sing it but you'll sing what Elvie Elvis Presley sng hadn't been too long ago we sang right here How Great Thou Art that's right it wasn't the little Church on the Hill that made it famous so just because uh you know uh Elvis the pelvis sang it doesn't mean that it wasn't inspired of God that's right and doesn't mean that it can't be Sanctified and used for the work of the Lord just C Porter Wagner sung it don't mean I can't sing it come on get real folks you're going to you're going to be such a legalist that you're going to throw out something that God isn't don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it well but those who sing it jump up and down and the girls are in tight jeans and and rips in their clothes and and and do you see anybody around here doing that we're singing the same song sometime do you see us doing like that do you see do you see women in ripped jeans up here men in cargo shorts with their baseball cap on backwards up here singing like that no then we shouldn't be so quick to throw the baby out with the bath water that's right you think I'm being critical I'm actually not not yet it could come but but I I haven't hit that yet they they were they led the world in science and education they were great people the Greeks but they worshiped and believed in mythology and so books of Arts curious arts and so forth witchcraft vexes and all kinds of things they had pulled from many religions you see this bumper sticker that people have you know tolerance and they've got a cross and a star of David and a Buddha symbol and a k Quanza or whatever else I don't know what people are calling themselves these days hary krishnam or whatever they are Moonies you know remember the Moonies I don't know brandom I I don't know what kind of something people want to be identified with today but I'll tell you it's not this idea that there's a little bit of good in all of them so we'll just all you know just move move forward together as one big happy family you hadn't read the book I've read you're you're not looking at the book that I've been taking a look at God said there's only one thing we stand on and that is his word that means I can't stand in agreement with with with somebody who believes that that the the wafer is God once it's been blessed and Sanctified they believe that piece of bread becomes a substitution for the body of Jesus and you're supposed to worship that as it goes down the aisle on the pole you worship that that sun the the the wafer with the Rays coming out from it perhaps some of you have seen that it is now once it's blessed it becomes the Holy Eucharist and they believe that that is the body of Jesus Christ to to to kiss the hand of a priest that carries that is to is to kiss God so you you you think that I can worship like that you think that I can join in with that when the Bible tells me in in Revelation 18 isn't it come out come out and be separate sayeth the Lord come on we know what the word said but they got stirred up about this man who could heal the sick and foretell things that happened to the dot and they got stirred up so did guess what they did they just come to see him they couldn't turn him on the satellite TV they didn't have a satellite TV they couldn't find him on the smartphone they didn't have a smartphone they couldn't fax in their questions email their question no no no no we want to see him sir we would see Jesus you see these Greeks were great thinkers thank you for the quote they're always seeking more knowledge and higher Enlightenment is the phrase they like to use no doubt these certain Greeks were heirs to the same Greek culture they two had probably spent their lives reading great literature they probably only had a a few days growth you know they hadn't been living the way of a Jew a Jewish person a Bible believer at the time very long they were they probably stood out a little different they're just making their transition They too had probably spent most of their lives reading great literature stay with me however after pondering the great questions of life and speculating with Socrates and Plato and Aristotle they realize that there was a serious Gap in their life they knew so much from Socrates Plato and Aristotle but they realize there are some things we don't know very much about there's a great Gap here and we've got to find out so they they sought out for their answers a great Rabbi from Nazareth one Yeshua Jesus answered Phillip and Andrew when they told him about these Greek men basically his answer was I die except a corn of wheat to the many who sought after him in the gospels to all of the Greeks to Judas to the priest to the crowds Jesus final answer to all of those who questioned him was basically the same I die it's really the message of Christianity it's why people are more comfortable with him in a Manger it's the gospel that people have such a problem with it's how we get the good news you don't have any good news unless he died the good news is not that he was a baby the good news is he died buried and rose again on the third day and now his Spirit lives in US of course logically we understand that if he had been born he couldn't die we know that we're not ignorant of the fact that he was born but his birth wasn't like other births he didn't come from an egg that was provided from the body from the Fallopian tubes of Mary one Mary a virgin he was born of an egg that God supernaturally placed in Mary's body she was more or less an incubator I know that sounds horrible for for the for the mentality of Catholics who believe that she was also virgin born they also believe that Mary was virgin born no scripture for that that's why in Jerusalem there's two sites both the the burial of Mary and the Ascension of Mary because some people believe she died and was buried and others believe she never died she just ascended from heaven from to Heaven from Mount Zion I've been to both places that's why tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people around the world every day of their life repeat this over and over again Hail Mary Mother of God full of grace and hail Mary Mother of God not once not twice 50 times a 100 times a thousand times while praying the the beads on their bracelet the rosary it's big time serious to them even though there's no scripture anywhere in the Bible nowhere ever does it tell us that Mary was immaculately conceived or that we should repeat the phrase is the salutation of Elizabeth to Mary that we should say that over over again with the additional words added by the Catholic church and that we should do that depending on what the priest tells us because we go into a little booth father I have sin it has been 50 years since my last confession you have to tell how long it's been and my S what are your sins my son boy some of us would never see the light of the outside we would live in the booth I'm not calling names but I'm thinking of some we'd live in the booth with the curtain pulled if we had to name them all oh son your sins are not so far removed from the sins of others and so uh you can be full absolved of your sins if it would have been in the time of Martin Luther they would have been given a price how much it would have cost to to Spring them you know but today it's not uh not really um public celebrated like that and so they'll say well son uh you can you can uh be fully absolved of these sins by saying uh 10 Apostles Creeds 40 hail Mares and praying the rosary at least a dozen times tonight and they're relieved a good Catholic is relieved there's a way out come on folks no wonder Martin Luther as Twisted as some of his ideas were no wonder he jumped up off of his knees when he read the verse that said the just shall live by faith Hallelujah not by the Apostles Creed not by confession not by the rosary but by faith in the shed blood not faith in a baby in a Manger but faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ not faith in dressing right or or wearing your hair right but faith in the blood of Jesus Christ brought to you by Grace we don't live a separated life to be saved we live a Sanctified life because we are because we are saved yes I am praise His name are you with me to to the many he answered I die it's the same answer to to us who look for Jesus in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons you see there are many jesuses out there for the for the for the many people there's about as many jesuses as there are people there's a republican Jesus there's a Marxist Jesus communist Jesus self-help Jesus there's a light at the end of the tunnel Jesus there's a life coach Jesus there's a conservative Jesus some people even have a Democrat Jesus there is a Black Jesus a white jesus a Jewish Jesus an Asian Jesus there's a long-haired Jesus the Holiness people have a a Greek looking Jesus with the Greek hairstyle there's all kinds depends on what you're looking for whatever you're looking for in a savior you can find him and that's why we know that today so many people are looking to find a Jesus a savior a relief from their problem hello some are looking for no more than a good Lu charm some would be just as satisfied with a lucky rabbit's foot look this way get off your phones get off your phones I'm preaching to you today show me a little respect if you can't respect me respect the word put your phone down come on somebody's looking for something that can help them and ease their mind and and ease their conscience and so Jesus is or a d dozen some people can only relate to A Jesus who let's say is less than 10 or 11 pounds they can't relate to that Jesus that brother brandham described only one that's less than 10 pounds a a baby who's tightly wrapped in swaddling clothes that were likely to have been the same cloths that had been used to wipe down the sweaty filthy animals who are lodging nearby I've heard some more kind and and and glorified explanations for what swaddling clothes were but the reality is they were stinky Rags the sweaty animals had been brought down out of the out of the cold into leant into caves into sucas whatever was available and they had been wiped down with rags and if anyone knows what a horse looks like when he's when he's been running and they wiped him down and those they she didn't have a registry on Amazon Mary come she didn't have any bougie swaddling gowns she grabbed what she had the greatest the best Christmas gift people like to say and you can only say that if you're Catholic because Gentiles don't observe the mass I am not not a Catholic my faith is not based on a mass when I want to say the birth I say the birth of Jesus the birth of Christ I don't you say what you like I don't have to make him Catholic I want him to be I don't want him to be Pentecostal either I don't want him to be message either I want him to be God I don't need a religious Jesus I need God I need a God who can help me out of my mess I need a God who loves me who cares for me I don't need a crying snotting pooping baby in a Manger I don't need a Jesus that I've got to change his diaper I got to have one who died for me who made his life available to me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've got to have one who has never participated in Pagan Babylonian Greek or Roman practices I've got to have a God who never needed a Christmas tree to bring him praise or honor Or Glory because nobody in their right mind thinks deep in their heart that that Evergreen represents Jesus and if it does why do atheists put them up why do pagans put them up why do witches and covens put them up why why do Buddhists put them up do you know they're Buddhist now because Christmas has become a universal holiday having nothing to do with faith or truth or reality and what's crazy is only the Catholic Church could pull it off only the Catholic Church could make a mass to commemorate the birth of a of a of a God and the whole world honor it in some way or another no Pentecostal let me tell you something if it was a Pentecostal doing if I could prove to you that the Pentecostals were the first ones who put up the tree no message people would have them because they've got prejudice against all Pentecostal thoughts come on brother preach it it wouldn't happen Methodist then the Baptist wouldn't want nothing to do with it but there is a Catholic mass that transcends all religions and even participated in by atheists who believe that they're they're God man is God they'll tell you man is God all men are Gods I don't believe in God atheist will say and that's why you and I are here to remind them that God doesn't believe in atheist so they're equal I don't believe somebody when they tell me they don't believe there's a higher power they may not be able to identify him with a sick church are mixed up confused Church of 11,000 different denominations they may not be able to believe in that but I want you to know most everybody believes in higher power and if you think that's enough to have eternal life you're foolish there's only one way to eternal life and that's through the blood of Jesus Christ it's through repentance it's not by being good to the bride it's by real repentance and the and receiving the blood and the grace and the gift of God's life then you can have eternal life amen amen amen not under some trinitarian Doctrine not under some false baptism why don't you just go ahead and tell it like it is brother ROM told us that that the demon Spirits travel in those titles and if you believe that that's such a crazy statement look at the condition of the denominational Church world oh brother Shel you must think this church is doing all right and everything here's good not at all didn't you hear me tell you that I expect that there will be people who call me Pastor who will wonder that day why the doors aren't open why surely brother Shelly would have been here by now and unlock the door I've already moved out of here is a thought you mean to tell me you Pastor church and in your mind you really expect with everything that's in me I really expect it because I heard a prophet say in every Church there are believers and make Believers and unbelievers and so yes I expect do you spend your life trying to figure out who they are never I didn't call you I can't push you away I didn't save you I can't unsave you but I would be a prideful foolish man to think that because you sit under my Ministry you're a Believer automatically everything you know you you you're just going to you know claim your association with me and be all right folks it is not going to be that way there God don't have any grandchildren you're not going to be to tell the judge my mama had a lot of faith my mama my daddy my grandmother my grandfather when we meet these folks on the road and they say oh you people must be Christian you must be Pentecostal you must be Hol my mother was my grandmother was my grandfather was my my aunt was my uncle I need to get back to that you sure do that's right I tell them it's not too late that's right somebody times they say it's been 40 years since I've been in a church like my mama it's not too late you either believe there's one way or you believe there's many ways one way one Faith one Lord one baptism one Spirit woo he's wild today some people can only relate to A Jesus as I said him a moment ago less than 10 pounds they see him still in a Manger when they think of Jesus they still see the shepherd boy standing there and the wise men and they assume there's three of them Bible never says there's three the Catholic tradition is three because the Catholic Theologian said well let's see gold frankincense and M three gifts so there's three wise men not necessarily there might have been 10 with gold and 10 with frankincense and two with myr there might have been 22 there there could have been 11 there could have been nine and by the way they never made it they never made it to the to the cave or to the Suka they never made it by the time they got there Jesus was probably already walking somebody said well didn't they follow the star there yeah from the long way away they didn't have a Subway they didn't have a jet train come on or Jet Plane they didn't have an AM track at least you should know that from the nativity scene they had camels and mules don't you know haven't you ever seen the crash don't you even know what it looks like and and there are people who think that there was a special little Hut built you know with straw on top and it was made specifically for Mary and Joseph's to to birth a baby no no no no this was something that was used most likely at times for worship and other times to get the cattle out of the rain the manger that you see in your little nativity set made out of wood never existed it never existed in the second temple period trees were rare in Judea they're scrubs today you have to go way up in the high mountains of Israel to get a tree that's of any height like Alabama everything else is kind of scrubby but if you go up you can find some there are very few Carpenters by the way very few Carpenters because there are very few trees CU there are very few things made of wood most things were made of stone when you in Israel you never find a preserved wooden box from the time of the second temple but what you will find is Stone that has been carved out for the cattle to eat out of and most likely that was the manger he was laid in some believe that it was more like a shelf used at suot but whatever it was it wasn't that that little thing with with forked legs you know like you have seen your whole life come on some people have gone so far is to add Jesus to their nativity scene bowed down of course I mean uh Santa excuse me Santa bowed down of course to Jesus Christ someone said that's the right message to send to my children I want them to know that even Santa Claus bows no you want them to know that one is a lie and one is a reality so so figments of that to me that would be the same as putting Superman bowed down to Jesus in the in the manger neither one of them neither one of them existed Santa didn't exist someone said but he's named after some kind of St Nicholas the Catholic church was always quick to make somebody a saint you read a little bit about his life and you'll wonder trinitarian baptizing titles teaching a Catholic Doctrine it's not likely that he was the the saint that the the church would like for you to think that he was it's like having Spider-Man or I I don't want to leave you girls out Wonder Woman bow down and say oh isn't that sweet that shows that all powers bow no it's showing people that a figment of someone's imagination is bowed down and and wait to wait you wait till they get older and they say to you so is Jesus real somebody said well none of us would would teach our kids like that you would have if you hadn't heard the truth and some heard the truth and contined to do it anyway because they didn't have a backbone they thought they were going to find the kind of Jesus that would make them happy would that be the Republican one or the Democrat one would that be the trinitarian one or the one one one you know which one would that be we there's only one he's the god of the Bible his words are in red you believe what he said you do what said are you lost somebody said well you know you you just can't preach it like that I want you to know that some of us got saved because of that kind of preaching I want you to know some of us heard the word because somebody told it Gun Barrel straight and every southern gospel song that's ever been written about an altar has at least one part of a verse that says and the old preacher was preaching hell hot and Heaven sweet we need that sometime that's why I started with the idea that one day you may stand on the outside of this church and wonder where the rest of us are how do I know how do I know if I am or not ask yourself this question am I surrendered to every word of God if you can answer yes you can't be sure we hope we pray we keep doing what's right and what we know to do while we work on ourselves but the reality is one of these days there is a bride it's going to leave here and there's not going to be enough of her in this nation to make too much of a stir we know that unfortunately it's true but this is the Hope for For the Rest perhaps somebody will know perhaps some of your loved ones will know perhaps some of your friends will know that you weren't quite as crazy as you seemed you weren't quite as religious and fanatical and radical as you seemed because no one can find you there will be those who feel like you you followed your cult leader off into the woods and drank Kool-Aid but there will be those who knew you who really knew you who really loved you who really had confidence in you who will know where you are and they'll be doing everything they can to try to figure out how to get there the problem is they'll have to do it without the help of the Holy Spirit it is the truth and it's time we be REM mind it that it's the truth well you act like you're mad you know why that that passion comes because it's all you have to fight against it's all the things you have to fight against to preach the truth like this not from your enemies are you my enemy from my friends now it goes on let's go back to the manger we got the Shepherds there we've got I don't know how many wise men in our mind again although they didn't get there for quite a while they weren't there January the 4th or 5th either no took them a while don't forget don't forget that that there's little rays of light forming a halo around the head of this little 10B baby and Mary and Joseph have their hands folded and they're looking at their little baby quite passionately and love lovely don't forget you must remember that they also have unusual hair rays of light coming out of their heads because we know how the Catholics like their Halos I won't say it but it's true I've heard people say if you'd been carrying the picture you wouldn't had a car EG if You' have had the picture in your wallet you you sound worse than a Catholic you wouldn't had family problems if You' have had the cross at your rearview mirror these things are not religious icons and they are not Lucky Charms they're memories they're memorials to remind us of what God did a generation ago if you can't produce that same life today it does you no good whatsoever to study what God was in history a god of history is not what this world is looking for today it's a god of reality it's a presence Jesus are you with me it's 122 I have a few more minutes don't forget this beautiful little scene that people like most folks are more comfortable with the meek and humble baby Jesus in a manger than they are with the lion of the tribe of Judah Jesus did you know most churches are making Giant Steps toward ultimate reconciliation and what that means is they're preaching more often now and with greater boldness now including men like Pat Robertson he he was preaching it quite strongly there for many years that in the end everyone will be saved because the judgment is already taken place it took place at the cross and now ultimately everyone will be saved everyone will find their home in heaven you've never been to a funeral yet where anybody left any doubt much if any that everyone has met their loved ones now folks you need to know that there's not a ballroom out there somewhere in another dimension where we meet our loved ones who went to hell and if you go to hell you're not going to be meeting your loved ones that went to be with Jesus there there's not some Gathering Place in the etheral world where we all get together and then we get sent to wherever we deserve to be that's not the way it works the reality is you've had loved ones to die that you will never see them again unless you see them at the Judgment that's right and if you've had loved ones die without Jesus Christ there is no Grace or Mercy extended after death the scripture said as a man as a tree falls he lies the Bible tells us that if if you die righteous you're right if you die ungod Godly your ungodly wherewith shall The Sinner and the ungodly appear if the righteous scarcely be saved I don't understand why we have gotten so far from the Bible truth that everybody believes their mom and dad they're going to see their mom and dad and their cousin their uncles and everybody who's ever passed away only if they trusted in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ only if they repented of their sins the Bible said whosoever cth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved the problem is you can be granted eternal life because you called on the name of the Lord but if you're born to be an overcomer guess what you have to do if you were predestinated to be an overcomer you've got to overcome would God tell you to be something and then not give you what you needed to be it would he call you to do something and not give you the grace to do what he called you to do hello we got it it if we have got him if we abide in the vine we can do this we're all working on ourself but that doesn't mean striving In the Flesh it means yielding it means as we preached before come on Jesus walk through these rooms walk through these closets show me what I've got to get out of my life come on some of you ought to start in your real closet you ought to start in your real closet some of you ought to start in your wardrobe some of you ought to start getting rid of those immodest clothes low cut tight fitting clothes women with men's clothes in their closet men with women's clothes in their closet not because they belong to their spouse but because they belong to them you ought to start moving some of that out well I may need them if I quit going to brother shelle's Church you don't need them you need to make a stand I'm sick and tired of people thinking that they can't make a stand for God for Truth for his word you can make a stand for everything else you stand for gun rights you stand for Republican politic you stand for so and so if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything can't you stand for Jesus can't somebody stand for the word can't somebody take God at his word we don't have to like it we don't even have to understand it but if he said it we're Duty bound to try to obey it and sometimes we can't do it on our own we just have to do it by Grace Lord help me I can't do I cannot do this by myself there are some folks I just can't love by myself I need you to come and love them through me and you know what he he understands that thank you brother like I said most folks are more comfortable to today with the meek and humble little baby Jesus than the lion of the tribe of Judah the problem today is similar to how it was back then we look for a Jesus in all the wrong places because we are often looking to glorify ourselves I got to find a Jesus who agrees with my ideas I need a Jesus who agrees with my politics I need a Jesus who agrees with my lifestyle huh that's why there are so many uh gay and lesbian affirming churches all over the world I got to find a Jesus who will never never never call me to any higher form of righteousness he'll let me do what my what my Fallen Instinct drives me to do my Fallen based nature listen if every one of us went out of here and started yielding to our fallen based nature we would be no more than animals monkeys have no sense of loyalty to a companion oh yes oh no they don't you ever been to the zoo you better run past the monkey you don't take your small children there unless you want them to ask a lot of questions animals animals animals hello and that's what this world would be and when we leave cuz everybody's looking for something but they want him to look just like them believe just like me m yes my Jesus has got on the tie dyed t-shirt and he don't judge me when I'm smoking weed and rainbow doesn't mean God's promise you know it means it he he Winks at sin okay let's move on but the real glory of Jesus is found in the last place we would ever look not his birth not in his miraculous life not in his miracles not even in his precious words the real glory of Jesus is only found in his death burial and Resurrection his crucifixion that's why he tells us remember me not my birth not my childhood not even my Ministry he said remember my death remember my death he kept point you want to know who Jesus is he's pointing us to the selfless one he's pointing us to the one who has such great love that he laid his life down for people who hated him who despised him who turned around and not only murdered him but tortured him him until he died and he was doing it for them and he prayed he didn't rail he didn't condemn he didn't say you idiots don't know what you're doing he said father forgive them for they know not what they do this world will never be able to find the authentic Jesus if they keep him in a Manger they're looking for Christmas spirit this time of year not Holy Spirit my message was titled in search of the real Spirit we would see Jesus not the Christmas spirit not the I think I've been under a cookie Spirit not the cookie Spirit not the the real Spirit which was selfless living Jesus Paid It All oh oh to him I give in the message Serv we would see Jesus paragraph 104 how different today how different today sorry I'm going to I'm going to preach on a little bit today with the churches of the Disciples of today what do they do if you if you come to disciples today he's talking about the Greeks coming to the discip them disciples before they did anything they took these Greeks right into to the presence of Jesus I don't know if that physically happened or not but I know that's the answer yes it is right I know it's the answer I know the answer is to get people to the presence of Jesus that's why you can't invite them to church and then sit beside them like a bump on a log that's why you can't invite your Heathen neighbors and then forget that you're a Christian when they come that's why you can't clam up not worship because you got somebody in that's going to know you oh I tell you I found real character in my wife before I married her we were having quite a Revival in Canada and she was a manager at a clothing store and one of her co-workers had come to the Revival meeting that night and I'm thinking in my mind she'll certainly be dignified she she'll certainly restrain herself because she is with a co-worker that you'll have to face tomorrow looking you know cockeyed at her what I found was when the presence of the Lord came she found out I found out that she had the right character she wasn't concerned about what the girl next to her was thinking or feeling or watching she just yielded to the presence of the Lord ended up in the aisle and through the doorway she just J dance right through the doorway because when the presence of Jesus comes you worship well I've got family in the message and when they come I I just try to watch myself you ought to show them you'll accomplish more in family Harmony by showing them that you're going to give God attention you're not going to leave him in the corner with dirty feet hello them disciples before they did anything Lord please let me stay focused and read they took these Greeks right into the presence of Jesus and if he if he's the same yesterday today and forever he will have to act the same today if you're brought into his presence disciples today is too much difference for today they try to take you to a cradle or a Manger or to a Santa Claus or to a bunny that's right for Easter bunny rabbit for Easter or something another instead of Christ instead of Christ brother bram's identifying that that that baby in a Manger that's not the Christ that people are looking for they never bring you into the presence of Christ are you reading ahead I encourage you to Christmas isn't Christ that's not Christ it it's it can be warm fuzzy it can be family time it can be good food it can be lots of things but it can't be Christ he wouldn't have anything to do with something rooted that's right in tolerance compromise and paganism he's not honored by your C celebration he's grieved that you have reduced him to a baby in a Manger a a a sock on the mantle a Christmas pudding a tree in the corner not where you lay gifts to him where you lay gifts to one another he must wonder what is wrong with people today no history anywhere to to identify the tree somebody said well Martin Luther way before there was a Martin Luther trees were being chopped down and brought into people's homes to celebrate the winter solstice which was yesterday the shortest day and the longest night is that right shortest day longest night of the year pagans have been commemorating yesterday for hundreds and thousands of years many of which did it with an evergreen tree before there was a Martin Luther you know it's true before there was the winter so you you you you move back you go all the way back to simus you you go back to Saul s so you go back to the son God it's it's older than Catholicism but there was no Jesus involved until Catholics got involved and they were going to bring Jesus into whatever their form of Jesus come on I can show you I can show you let's move on let's move on Christ isn't Christmas isn't Christ today they bring you some other PL I don't care how quiet you folks get and I want you to know something it do does it bother you Pastor that all the churches and this message I look they can do exactly what they want to do that's right some little uh uh uh preacher boy of sorts made a PO made a public uh reel or or some kind of blog or something this week and any preacher in this message you know that preach I was told I didn't want it but you know preaches against Christmas where he's just looking for a name for himself you've got to be kidding me kid I already have a name mud it's been mud if you think your intimidation or that of the top 10 preachers is going to move me from what God has made so real to me you've got another thing coming as long as there's life in my body as long as there's breath in my body as long as I'm the pastor of this church you do what you will I'm going to preach the truth Christmas isn't Christ no today they bring you some other plac to some statute some church some organization some doctrinal law some picture on the wall some belt buckle some bolo tie but never get you in the presence of Christ meeting after meeting after meeting prayer line after prayer line after prayer line it's only a few who see the value of getting people into the presence of Christ a real true disciple would bring you right straight into the presence of Christ and from there Christ would show you what you had to do are you still with me Paradox it'll be a real Paradox one of these days when Jesus comes and the dead in Christ shall rise mortal take on immortality and the Rapture of the church comes in this Christmas times when people are shopping and dancing and drinking and celebrating something that they know nothing about like they was celebrating Washington or Lincoln's birthday not worshiping they've still got God In A Manger when God is Not In A Manger he's raised from the dead alive forever more living among proving himself as the same God that the nyine fathers carried and down Through the Ages has come since the day of Pentecost the same God that met Paul on the road to Damascus was a missionary the Gentile and a messenger from God to the Gentiles the Gentiles message started by visitation of the pillar of fire and it ends the same way come on in the message sech we would see Jesus I'm being gracious I'm not giving you but a few we take the word Christmas it's very seldom you ever hear Christ's name mentioned except Christmas the lights and tinsil is all on Santa Claus not on Christ till people hardly knows what Christmas is really for they've just Pagan it's all for Jesus happy birthday Jesus it's all for Jesus it's mostly for gluttony hot todes that's what it's mostly for we're not in my family not in my home we're a Christian and surely you don't have that filthy Pagan Tree in your house the lights and tinsil Santa Claus they've just paganized it and paganized it till it's all become Pagan it's a great commercial day now if they want to make a commercial day like Mother's Day or Father's Day thank you or Son's Day or daughter's day that's was kind of appropriate he brought me water and brother B said you can make a commercial day Son's day every day is a Son's day every day is a daughter's day that's all right but keep the commercial off of Christmas I seen a sign not long ago said put Christ back in Christmas folks here's the reality you can't put him where he never was in the first place if you had to put him back in Christmas you'd be putting him back either in the Catholic Church which he never was there or in the Pagan customs of the Heathen now they bring you to a church you learn to Creed they bring you to Christmas what do you do you see a Santa Claus they bring you to a church you see an organization they bring you in the little neighborhood kids you know and have somebody dress up like Santa Claus and give them a present but Christ brought them to the cross and when you get a real disciple they'll point you to Christ Christ will bring you to the Cross where you are crucified with him yes and his eternal life and your life meet together and your life dies and you take on his eternal life and then you're a Son of God Amen what a difference from the disciple of old the disciple of today let's skip 19 119 but Christ himself pointed people to his death except a corn of wheat falls into the ground it abides alone 120 oh how different how different but your life and his life find each other not at the church not in the building not in the Creed not in good works but in the cross where you are crucified with him that's where you find Christ you don't find him by doing better turning a new page starting a new life you don't find Christ you find Christ only in death not in a Manger not in a confession to believe in certain Creeds and fables you don't find Christ there a true amen wait a minute I didn't hear the amens a true servant takes you to him and he is the word then brother brandham if Christ is on Earth today a real servant would take him to him Christ well Christ is here in the form of his word and the word brings life because he is the word Christ is the word yes sir he is the word himself the true servant takes you to the word sir as we would see Jesus same message paragraph 135 that's the message to get to people not a cradle not a Manger Christmas it's not mentioned in the entire book of the Bibles never one time did Jesus refer them to his birth somebody said we're doing it for him he don't want it why can't somebody just get it why are you doing it for him he doesn't want it he doesn't appreciate it live for him December 25th and all other 364 days of the year and that will please his heart your birthday celebration for him brings him no praise no glory very little attention maybe you pray maybe you have the boldness to pray a Grace over the meal maybe somebody will at least read a few verses of the of the Christmas story which is really the story of his birth that's about it and then get then we want our gadgets where's my new iPad where's my new where's my new where's my new hello now I don't have it ready to place going to I hope you take this with you some of you streamers are you know you're hotheaded you're going to be sending me quotes you're all stirred up I know you are my church people are quiet and they've been living this a long time but they're all quiet and I'm just just you know deflating all the warm fuzzies really the Christmas spirit don't you feel it aren't you in the AR you in the Christmas spirit I don't want to be in the spirit of anything that's right other than the Holy Spirit the spirit of Christ the spirit of life and kindness and and love gives me indigestion the whole thought of it and and the fact that why don't you just just do it call it something else leave his name off of it call it Yule call it Soul Invictus call it celebrating the Equinox leave his name out of it it existed before he was ever born that's that's the message sir as we would see Jesus 135 that's the message to get people to not a cradle not a Manger Christmas is not mentioned the entire books Never one time did Jesus refer to his birth but to his death sir we would see Jesus one more one more 215 not not one time did he point any person to any Creed any denomination or to his birth or even Christmas not one time did he ever do it I'm following Jesus I'm just following Jesus [Music] Jesus he never did it he never asked for it he didn't want it still doesn't want it the bathroom is not for Christmas trees the Jews believe that it's appropriate to hang scripture in every room in the house except the bathroom there's a warning sometime on on Jewish art reminding you that the the bathroom is not an appr if it it contains scripture the bathroom is not an appropriate place to hang the scripture that's a place for evacuation it's a place to get rid of the junk and then they tell me but I'm putting this tree up because I want to remember Jesus and honor Jesus and and they've run out of places to put them so I see message Believers every year taking pictures of their trees in every room putting them up newly decorated hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds thousands of dollars they spend because the arburn tree they had last year you know or the AL or the ten oh excuse me let me let me get it right the Tennessee University of Tennessee tree they had last year it's not good enough for this year because the colors have changed so we've got to do it all over again and we've run out of places to put them so guess where we put them now on the back of the toilet because we don't want anyone to be in any room in our house not remembering Jesus so the first thing they think when they go into the bathroom and shut the door and turn around looking for the commode if they see that little tree there and you think for one minute that the normal average person says he's Jesus in the kitchen Jesus in the bathroom no they think what idiots live here what Christmas Fanatics some are happy we'll give you a candy cane after you'll be all right he never did Point anyone to anywhere else to know him but the cross and that self- crucifixion to yourself this is part of the crucifixion it's not fun to be the oddbird out the odd man out it's not fun it's not fun don't you just love Christmas and you have to say well my favorite what what is your favorite day of the year I always answer if I if I think it's appropriate December 26th why December 26th because Christmas is over for another year praise God you know I spared you I told I told some of the kids I told Amelia and and uh Nora I said I'm going to buy me a grinch hat and I'm going to wear it to church and preach this message I don't want to be the Grinch that stole Christmas it's not fun I never used I never used the word Santa in our home until our children were were quite old i i i shielded them to the best of my ability and when we saw one I would say oh look oh look it's Moses in a red suit and it's funny it is funny it is funny but Moses was real see and the other stuff wasn't [Music] amen I'm not done but nearly nearly Jesus never did write a Creed he never did ordain a denomination he he said wait a minute go back and that is self- crucifixion to yourself except a man be born again then in the manger Santa Claus he said Jesus never did write a Creed and never did ordain an nomination and then why is it we take so much of it and even lay every responsibility on it I want to ask you that Christmas now why is it that our churches lay so much on it you you you must belong to this church you got to say this Creed you got to do this listen there are churches around this message where if anyone d cares to not they are humiliated if they don't put the tree if they don't make the party if they don't we've got churches around this message that have already been busy a month Sunday school teacher party you youth party uh uh old adult party single party married couple party but they don't put much on Christmas it's all for Jesus why do they lay so much on it if it's not important it shows we've got a different kind of a disciple today they want to bring you to their Church to their denomination to their Creed and not to their Christ I don't have time to play it tonight today is it tonight already but Joshua sent me um a clip that I've never seen before brother Billy Paul is speaking somewhere in a foreign land I'm assuming somewhere in Europe but it I could be wrong and there he's taking some questions and they ask him about the Christmas tree is it all right we understand and and brother Billy Paul he he takes a long time to answer he just kind of smiles and he said well the truth is he said there was a deacon in the Tabernacle who worked for the Forestry Department and yes he would cut down a tree every year and leave it on the porch and sometimes dad would put it up for the kids now that's on him and and that's why I cling to that quote when he said don't you pay any attention to the messenger you just stay with the message are you calling brother Brandon a hypocrite no he may have had reasons for doing that I I it's none of my it's just simply to be honest with you it's just none of my business but I'm going to stay with what he said all of it all of it and the evidence is is clear much more negative than Pro they ask him about presents and because we all know brother Brandon would say Merry Christmas at times and then other times he said I'm not goodness it's not exactly a Merry Christmas it's Christ be with you that's good Christ be with you Monday Sunday Christ be with you spring fall summer winter Christ be with you God bless you that's what we're saying God bless you brother Christ be with you fine but sometimes he would mention we have a little something for the kitties look the little something for the kitties was not an iPod it was tangerines oranges apples and and some walnuts and a few pieces of hard candy in a bread bag that was the treat that'll work anytime you you give me a few pieces of candy and walnuts no I'll take it he said we got a little Su for the kitties he said thank you for the present the suit came from the church look the reality is you can buy me a suit too don't call it Christmas present but just say God bless you Pastor you're you're outgrowing that one or whatever be nice be nice you've had too many cookies whatever be nice but I love this I've never heard this they ask him about he brother Billy Paul said but let me let me tell you this he Saidi never knew dad he said we bought them for each other the kids but he said I never knew dad to buy anybody any of us a birthday a Christmas present and you know that means something to me I know he was a generous man I know he gave to to his family and I know he gave to others but there must have been some reason why that to his even his own children he said he just said he didn't do it there must be a reason he must have had something in his heart so during this time of year when people are searching for the Christmas spirit musicians are coming according to our culture you don't even know what the Christmas spirit is unless you watch the Hallmark Channel you're full of Christmas spirit when you have warm fuzzy feelings you're watching you know sappy love stories wearing red wool socks and drinking hot chocolate you know you have the Christmas spirit when you're partaking in all the festivities beginning with family and friends and bacon goodies and candy canes and santon toys and Christmas songs most of which by the way were written by Jewish songwriters giving and receiving gifts and the Christmas dinner is all Central to the spirit of Christmas one of the most important parts of of participating in the spirit of Christmas is the decking of the tree with ornaments in fact not having a tree or enjoying decorating one is the Tipping Point for most of those who don't have the Christmas spirit they'll just tell you right out you have no Christmas spirit you're the Grinch for good measure throw into the mix of Christmas cheer one must be loving and generous then you are set to have the Christmas spirit if any of you have done any shopping this week even buying groceries you've already realized that most of the loving cheer and generosity of the Christmas spirit has melted away through the years and that's why a young 24 year old mother in Mississippi friends of friends her and her family accidentally pulled out in front of someone coming out of a Walmart parking lot he followed them home with an automatic rifle and shot the yard shot the car the husband survived the 24 year old mother died the last I heard the infant child was in intensive care he must have thought they got the last doll or the last electronic his Christmas cheer had ran out what I see is sick what I feel is satanic what people call the Christmas rush to me is the same kind of rry spirit that represent that's represented by Migra it's the same kind of spirit that's represented in a in all you can eat Buffet sitting in a casino a casino Isaiah 1520 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil they put Darkness for light and light for Darkness they put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter search as one might the Christmas spirit can't be found in the scripture it's a false Spirit where works and feelings promote personal happiness the Christmas spirit is seductive because it mixes holy and profane two more now the Christmas Divine Healing now the Christmas is not a Protestant holiday it's a Catholic day the 25th of December was months and months before our or after before our Lord was born meaning it was already marked our Lord was born in April but he wasn't born in December if if you've been in Judea in December it's cold you know that he wasn't it's spelled c h r i s t Mas a Mass for Christ it's the Christ mass in Acts of the Holy Spirit now as we're approaching Christmas time now and here the things are decorated all up with Santa Claus instead of Jesus they don't even spell it anymore exmas is what they put they don't even spell Christ in Christmas anymore I I think it I think that's just good fine no problem I have no problem with that he doesn't belong there why the people never never even think about the birth or anything of Christ what it's really for only thing they think about is Santa Claus took his place and instead of rejoicing listen instead of rejoicing under the spirit of God can can I just hold my finger there they call off church it's a good thing that it's on Wednesday because we'll see among our rign we'll see won't we how many have a service on Wednesday night it's about Christ you know come on he said instead of rejoicing under the spirit of God they go out and get drunk and rejoice see that's what makes the difference men will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God he goes on and I'm closing I will War you to talk in the end about syncretism but I won't take time much time syncretism is the blending of all kinds of religious ideas and philosophies and theories with any other religion hoping to make it more palatable there would have been no Trinity except for the fact that there were many pagans coming to Faith and they were having such a hard adjustment moving from a polytheistic idea of God being many gods into a monotheistic idea of God being one leave it to the to the early church fathers especially those already formed under the Catholic church and meeting in the Creeds like the Nan Creed they decided there's one way that we can present God that would be less difficult to comprehend to the Pagan coming to the faith we will make God three three people acting as one VOA the Trinity is born that ought to disturb you it's accepted now in in in almost every major denomination in the world it it started as a compromise now it's become more than a compromise such a false doctrine that keeps people away from the real Christ hello hello same thing happened this is before this is before Constantine this is before Emperors made the decision to make Christmas Christmas as a national and international celebration people were already celebrating on December the 25th they'd been doing it for Generations centuries there were so many pagans coming to Christ praise the Lord praise the Lord praise God that there were pagans coming to Christ so why don't we just present to them the pure Gospel of scripture let them come out of their Darkness let them leave their P Pagan ways behind them and follow Christ wholeheartedly no the Catholic Church decided we've got to make it more palatable we can't take their celebrations from them so we'll combine theirs with ours it's called syn ISM it explains so much it's the idea that what we believe can be more palatable if we water it down with more comfortable words more tolerance more acceptance you know uh universalism we're all going to be saved in the end nobody's granddaddy went to hell you don't have to give up your Pagan ways we'll just make it part of we we'll just take a tree that's been decorated for years to celebrate false gods and we'll just tell them we're doing it for Jesus come on folks it's syncretism it's filth he says so it's not not the mixing of sweet and bitter it's it's it's the mixing of Darkness and Light and if you can't stand in this wicked hour and be the fish can't we have meals with our family sure you can and you should if you have a family that can respect what you believe you ought to be with them don't you shove anything down their throats don't you get preachy don't you be religious don't you be a fanatic enjoy your time together the reality is some of us don't have families like that we some of us have families that are going to force presence they're going to force their particular traditions and celebrations and it has to be done the way they've done it for years and when that's the case we're for we're forced with a revelation 184 decision come out from among them be separate sayith the Lord I I'm telling you the truth what do we do then we find other times we love them we fellowship with them we don't condemn others we don't act Pious or legal or religious I've had people say to me I have a letter on my desk from a saint from many years ago I'm writing to tell you before someone else tells you I gave in this year my family insisted my grown children insisted on putting up a tree in my house for their celebration I didn't want you to find out from somebody else so I'm writing to let you know I appreciated the sentiment I appreciated the kindness perhaps it normally wouldn't have even bothered me the way it did but the reality was something gripped my heart and said I I don't know why this came but something gripped my heart and said well it'll be the last Christmas that you ever celebrate with them on this Earth I didn't prophesy that it wasn't my wish or my desire or my hope it wasn't the fact that I wanted someone to be punished I think the children though they were grown should be spanked shamed for dragging that into their mother's home I didn't do I think that's disrespectful just like these backslid gals that wear their tight britches to their Mom and Daddy's house knowing that they've got a standard of life if you can't respect somebody enough to to be decent stay home boy that's tough isn't it I don't know why that came but it came so real well it'll be the last one if you can't stand just in my heart this came if you can't stand it'll be the last one I I somehow came to the understanding in my mind that it must be the Lord saying I can't leave you here brother brandom talks about the the man before he went too far he was already drinking smoking cigarettes already already far but before before he got too far God took him and I just had this idea if if they can persuade you that way what else will they persuade you and he loved her too much to let her go back to her lipstick and her slacks just come home then you can spend every holiday with me I I I don't even know why I shared that I'm not trying to instill any kind of fear in anybody it wasn't wasn't a fear tactic it it was just simply I believe God wants to give us courage love one another there are biblical options there are things that we can do together that are not Pagan nor perverted things that Jesus honored and respected like the rededication of the temple the reality ass seared we would see Jesus and we need to be the kind of disciples that will immediately bring people into the presence of the Lord not to a Creed not to a compromise but bring them straight into the presence of the Lord how many of you want to be that kind I want to bring them to Christ nothing else let's stand he's the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he's the light of the world Jesus is the light of the world he's the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he the light of the world oh Jesus is the light you don't have to be quiet now you can sing he the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he the light of the world oh Jesus is the light of the world let's go up he's the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he's the light of the world oh yua is the light of the world sing it with me just a little more in the monitor he the light of the world world and he shines his light upon us he the light of the world oh Yeshua is the light of the world sing again he the light of and he shines his light upon us [Music] he's Jesus oh Jesus is the light of the world play that would you softly he's the light may not be the season of his birth but it's the season season of rededication it's a season of Miracles it's the season of light we believe God took a little pot of oil only enough oil for one night and he multiplied it eight nights as the temple was being taken back from pagans they offered Pig Blood on the altar of God and they erected a statue of Jupiter in the Holy place a little Band of Brothers said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa we'd rather die fighting for truth than live under the Tyranny and debauchery of paganism in the Holy Place many gave their lives yes to fight against the resistance they were the resistance fighting against the [Music] majority when God gave them Victory unbelievable Victory how do a little band of fellows stand against an army of literal elephants it's recorded in the mccabes elephants that would be like tanks today and God gave them Victory a bunch of moms and dads went into that Holy place and they scrubbed the pig blood off the altar they made sure the Jupiter's statue was drugg out and burned and they wanted to light the holy manora they set it back up in place some people say it's just a tradition well there are people who say Jesus is just a tradition I know better than that they find a little pot of Sanctified oil would have taken too many days to consecrate new oil so they at least ate they said we'll just use what we got joy joy joy just a little bit of Joy use what you got it don't take a whole lot you know and God gave him a miracle he let the monora stay lit for eight nights so it's a season of Miracles it's a season of light it's a season of Consecration and dedication it's a season to wage war on compromise in your life I may die in the fight but that's what he wanted to bring me to anyway unless the unless a corn of wheat goes into the ground and dies it abideth alone but if it dies it multiplies Hallelujah and the Harvest is bigger than the seed so regardless of what you're doing let this be a time as we come to the end of the year on the Gregorian calendar let it be a time of Recon Lord where have I let the enemy creep in where have I let compromise come in somebody said well do I have to turn my head when I see Christmas lights I just told you it's a a season of Lights you don't have to be a fanatic I just wish they knew why they were putting them up it's more than a high power electric bill I just wish they wouldn't synchronize them to Jingle Bell Rock I just wish they would let everybody know I'm doing this because I want to tell the whole world that Jesus is the light not Santi Santa Claus Jesus is alive you ever pass a home and see a blow up of Jesus standing in the front yard with his arms wide open then you can really say you've seen something but it'll usually be Frosty or the or boes in a red suit I want to be a light I want my neighbors to know I want those I come in contact with every every day to know I want to stand on the word even when it's not popular I don't want to run my loved ones off I don't want to run people off but I want to stand with the word and I hope you will too Jesus is the light of the world not those strength but Jesus is the light sing it with me one more time Benjamin's going to come we're going to worship quickly just just a short set and we go he's the light and he shines his light upon us he's the light of the world oh Yeshua is the light of the world sing one more time as he comes for a moment he the light of the [Music] world and he shines his light upon us he's the light oh of the world oh

you Lord bless as the Lord oh my soul and oh my soul I worship His holy name we sing like never before oh my soul I worship your holy name [Music] and on that day when my strength is failing the end draws near and my time has come still my soul will sing your praise [Music] unending 10,000 years and then for forever more we bless you Lord bless the Lord oh my soul and all my soul I worship His holy name so we sing like never before Oh my soul lord I worship your holy name and bless the Lord oh my soul and oh my soul I'll worship His holy name sing like never before Oh oh my soul I worship your holy name if you're here today and you recognize that there's mixture in your life may have nothing to do with holiday but but you recognize that there's still mixture in you you want the wisdom of the Lord the leadership of God to help you deal with the mixture because if you know your heart you know that you want to be holy before him and and that comes not by works but by yielding more of your life and will to him and if you're here today and you'd say I recognize that there's still a mixture of light and darkness there's still bitter and sweet there there there's still some parts of me that I really need to consecrate to the Lord I I want to ask you to come I want to ask you to come and stand with us just a moment we'll make this quick no pressure it's only if you feel that this applies we're just going to sweep around our altar [Music] we want to pull down every every sign every message that we're sending out of our life that's mixed confusion every every message that that's coming off of us that's a little bit of light a little bit of Darkness we're want to pull that down we want his light we want Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to be the theme over our lives we want that to be the message we send and what we say how we dress where we go how how we live our lives how we live in the world but not of the world so if you've come forward because you wanted to just acknowledge I need a little help from him oh I think it's wonderful if you're streaming the service and you feel the same just let him know Lord here I am I I want to sweep around my altar I want to scrub a little I I just want to make sure that all is in order I don't want any odd against anybody any Prejudice any [Music] Envy I just want to be able to discern you in my life and in the life of others if you feel that way then I want us to pray pray together father we are here today your servants and it becomes our responsibility even when we're not asked to show you Jesus to those that we come in contact with our friends and neighbors they may never our co-workers they may never find the courage that the Greeks had to come and say sir we would see Jesus but it remains our responsibility and obligation to show you to those who seek you in Purity and love and in Holiness with real concern and sometimes we can't do that because we've let some things come in that's dimmed our light a little bit and we've compromised on some areas of truth that cause a mixed signal to be sent out from our lives so today here we are Lord standing around on this altar knowing that we can't do it for ourselves so we've come to you because you are able to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves Here We Stand our heart stretched before you believing that by your grace and your sanctifying power you will give us Grace to drag the Jupiter out of the Holy place to take jealousy by the throat and pull it down in our lives whatever it is that the enemy uses to condemn us or confuse us may we find the courage of the mccabes to stand against compromise and say we don't want to face a living God at the at the end of our life if we live a long life knowing that we got weaker and weaker in our testimony and weaker and weaker in our faith Lord breathe breath breathe your life right now over these precious dedicated people who are standing in your presence to be all that you have created them to be and some of them will be in uncomfortable situations this week shine out of them oh Father arrest them if they try to get religious if they try to get sanctimonious or legal arrest us arrest us it's not our desire to offend or to put off it's our desire to stand firm like a lighthouse and we have a tendency to go either way we're either too loose or too fanatic so we need your grace to stay in the middle of the road and keep our balance in the scripture so we ask you Lord Jesus for Grace right now we repent only you know folks what you've let in but whatever that is we we stand ready now Lord to repent and say we're sorry we have allowed things to come and take some of the room in our heart that belongs to you so today we ask for your uh true Grace to forgive us to cleanse us with the power of life and your blood and raise us up with Victory Hallelujah as sons of God Sons of the Kingdom sons of Zion yes may we never Bend or bow to the pressure of society or culture may we not be ashamed to be the peculiar your people the holy treasure that you've called us to be we're depending on you would you just lift your hands to him Lord I surrender all my will every part of my will I Surrender my emotions that get stirred up this time of year the Devil comes around this time of year sometime to make me think well it's not all that important and father we just want you to bring Grace into our minds into our will into our emotions we want to be able to rule and Reign every member of our body and bring it under sanctification for your name's sake Hallelujah we ask for this help in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the saints of God said amen bless the Lord oh my [Music] soul worship His holy let's do it before we go sing sing like never
