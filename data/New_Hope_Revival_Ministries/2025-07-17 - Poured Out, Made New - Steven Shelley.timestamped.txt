[0:00] We are called like wine, like grapes
[0:03] that have been crushed to become wine in
[0:07] the in the chalice in the cup of the
[0:10] King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He
[0:13] desires to find fellowship and
[0:16] relationship with us.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; And there's so much comfort in that.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; And there's peace and there's
[0:23] stimulation
[0:25] &gt;&gt; by revelation in that fellowship. So
[0:29] wine begins its fermentation process in
[0:32] a dark sealed place where the wine is
[0:37] changed over time and in stillness. The
[0:42] process of fermentation in the Bible was
[0:44] such that you're pouring from one vessel
[0:47] to another vessel to another vessel. And
[0:50] each time you do that, there's stuff
[0:52] left behind. How many of you been
[0:54] through some stuff in your life and
[0:56] you're thankful that you left some junk
[0:58] behind you
[1:00] &gt;&gt; and now you come forward some newness in
[1:02] you and you start churning again
[1:05] &gt;&gt; and then you're poured out about that
[1:07] time you're poured out again
[1:09] &gt;&gt; and what happens then is uh there are
[1:12] more drags
[1:15] &gt;&gt; you know it's hard to believe that that
[1:17] that I was that rotten
[1:19] &gt;&gt; that God had to just keep pouring me out
[1:21] and pouring me not leaving behind every
[1:24] time that which was unlike him. You
[1:26] know, it doesn't matter to me how many
[1:28] vessels it takes.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter to me how many years it
[1:31] takes. Before I leave here, I want to be
[1:33] just like him.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; It's the only way.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; The same God who brought you this far
[1:41] will take you all the way
[1:43] &gt;&gt; if you'll put your trust in him. So
[1:45] after that wine tithe was taken off of
[1:49] the first juice that was beginning to
[1:53] ferment, fermentation takes a shift and
[1:56] it starts becoming more violent.
[1:59] Violent. Yes. Violent pressure.
[2:04] Fermentation is not just bubbles.
[2:07] It's a tremendous amount of pressure.
[2:10] And Jesus said, "If you take new wine
[2:13] that's still in the beginning days of
[2:16] fermentation and you try to put that in
[2:19] an old vessel, the old vessel who's been
[2:23] through so much already, it will never
[2:25] be able to withstand the pressure that
[2:29] builds up in the process of transforming
[2:32] the juice to wine.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The new wine
[2:37] that that the kind is moving the kind
[2:40] that's still bubbling and purifying and
[2:42] getting sweeter and more valuable. That
[2:45] movement of God, God moving in us and us
[2:48] moving for him. You got to move. You got
[2:50] to move. We used to sing it. Amen. You
[2:52] may be high. You may be low. But when
[2:54] God gets ready, you got to move.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; You just got to move. You got to be
[3:00] willing to obey. You got to be willing
[3:02] to change. You got to be willing to go
[3:04] when God says go and stay when God says
[3:06] stay. Amen.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; He's a living reality in his people.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; We can't be satisfied with a form or a
[3:14] fashion.
[3:16] New wine demands a new vessel. The Lord
[3:18] will not waste his wine. He's searching
[3:21] for somebody who can be fresh, flexible,
[3:24] and have a yielded heart that can expand
[3:27] under pressure.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; That that just disqualifies stubborn
[3:32] people.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:34] Now this fermenting wine, it means it to
[3:37] me it symbolizes a revelation that's
[3:39] getting richer and realer in your heart.
[3:42] Doesn't mean new truth. It means a it
[3:44] means a fresh understanding of truth
[3:47] that has already been spoken in your
[3:48] life. Something perhaps you've already
[3:51] heard the prophet say, but it hasn't
[3:53] been made personally active in your life
[3:56] yet. That's why we need to let the
[3:58] process work. That's why we need to
[4:00] embrace what God is doing. Revelation
[4:03] doesn't stand still. Revelation by
[4:06] nature is always expanding. It's
[4:09] transforming. It's maturing
[4:12] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many want a fresh outpouring, but
[4:18] they don't want to be stretched.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Stretching is uncomfortable.
[4:25] Just leave it like it was. If it's not
[4:27] broke, don't try to fix it.
[4:31] If you're not growing, you may be trying
[4:34] to pour something living into something
[4:36] lifeless.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Your own old mindset or your wounded
[4:41] expectations,
[4:43] your hope deferred may be causing you
[4:47] not to receive new wine.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; Your hurt feelings may be causing you
[4:54] not to receive new wine.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to give the old skin
[5:00] away? Are you willing to let the old
[5:02] stuff slip away so that God can create a
[5:06] new vessel in you and fill you with new
[5:10] wine?
[5:11] &gt;&gt; There's so much going on inside of us
[5:13] when the word begins to stimulate this
[5:16] spirit within us by revelation.
[5:19] Oh, thank God. It makes you want to
[5:21] embrace the process. It makes you want
[5:23] to say, "Lord, just keep on pouring me
[5:25] from one vessel to another
[5:28] &gt;&gt; to leave behind what I don't need." If
[5:31] the good wine is not poured off the top
[5:33] and the yucky stuff left behind, then
[5:36] the wine is deeply affected. Each vessel
[5:39] in the wine- making process reflects a
[5:41] season of divine refinement. God is
[5:45] cleansing his people. God is preparing
[5:48] his people. God is getting his people
[5:52] ready
[5:55] for what he's going to do through them,
[5:58] in them, and through them.
