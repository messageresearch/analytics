and uh so when someone is up like these H who have sung for us this weekend and you stand up a little bit or you put your hand in the air or you shout Glory it's just like a saying Amen to a preacher because the preachers aren't the only ones here that have Ministry in fact everyone of us have Ministry in us we're everyone called to some form of ministry you say but I'm a woman yes you too you're called to some form of ministry and if we can encourage one another along this way if we can encourage one another then we want to do that I want you to go with me in to prayer for just a moment and uh I want you to ask the Lord to comfort sister Sally and her family uh she wanted us to thank you for praying and her mother made her final Crossing she had been sick a long time like my mom and

father we stand here in your holy presence our hearts are overflowing like the old timer said my tears are right behind my eyeballs and it's not out of sadness it's out of fullness there's such a full complete presence of the Lord such an atmosphere of Glory in this house today and we recognize that we have so much to be thankful for we lift up the need Lord of every hand that went up and we lift

to be an eyewitness to something if you're going to testify of it how many of you are glad you're an eyewitness to the saving delivering sanctifying Holy Ghost bap izing power of almighty God I'm not ashamed of it I have no intention of going back to 1906 Pentecost I'm heading all the way back to the upper room come on I want everything God did for the disciples that day when he poured the Holy Ghost on them and once I get all the Holy Ghost I can have I'm marching all the way back to Eden because it's not just back to Pentecost it's back to the garden it's back to the beginning it's back to dominion and Authority Hallelujah and we're not ashamed I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed brother Brandon was telling the story about FF Bosworth daddy Bosworth and he preached on atmosphere and he said it doesn't matter you put a hen egg under a hen it'll hatch but if you put it under a hound dog it'll hatch it's not what's sitting on top of it that causes it to hatch it's not whether it's his real mama or not that causes it to hatch it's the atmosphere and in an atmosphere like we're experiencing this morning anything can happen in your life and something may happen this morning and you may not even know it has happen until about 4:00 this afternoon when it Dawns on you that pain is gone when it Dawns on you that the depression isn't there anymore I've seen God deliver I've seen God deliver people in the right atmosphere and it took him a long time to even realize what it taking place in their life maybe that's happened to some of you I'm not preaching I'm sister Beverly I'll get yours in another time I'm not going to sing anymore I'm turning this brother loose today to give us what God has laid on his heart they have had a battle in the night but they're here on time looking as good as could be expected ready to do God's word will and give us his word I'm so happy for every one of you here I I know brother Brandon was a little critical of that that amount of transfiguration scripture there you know sometime he said isn't that just like a denomination want to build a church and stay a while but when I look at it I look at it like brother gy did I don't want to build a mother church and dedicate it to the pope I'm not trying to have another place that can be just like all the rest I didn't want to have a church I didn't want to have a place that was just like everybody else's I didn't set out to be as strange as we ended up being but I did not want to have a cookie cutter church I wanted you to come I wanted people to be able to come and never know what was going to happen we don't always accomplish that but I believe we come this morning not even knowing not really knowing what was going to and we still don't know yet it remains to be seen I don't have a lot of friends in the ministry uh you're my friends in the ministry but I mean a lot of preacher friends I'm very very very blessed to have brother Dwayne and his family as a friend I respect him I have confidence in him I honor their lives before the Lord I appreciate the times that he has spoken into this body he has spoken into our young people and to our older people and and I don't want him to come here today with some time restraint or feeling pressure uh it's a rainy day we we don't have any thing to do we can't do much outside and we're going to have lunch after a while but it don't matter to us whether it's lunch or leer we don't care we want God to have his way we started having these meetings again after many years of not having them every other month first Sunday every other month first Sunday because there are so many folks who stream who watch the services here and some of them don't even have a local church to go to so they need to come they need need to be able to come and get revived and filled up a little bit and then go back and fight the battles that have to be fought to live this Victorious Life one of these days you're going to look up into the face of Jesus Christ and you're going to know Hallelujah you're going to know it was worth it all you're going to know it was worth it all Holiness is right I want somebody to say Amen Holiness is

You'll wish you had more sacrifices you could have made You'll wish there were more things you could have done because you'll think I've never really done anything I remember brother brandom saying

anything from it right because it's my offering to him oh yes and I believe that for each one of these up here um I I come in and I I watch them as brother Steve said give everything amen they do give everything completely fully committed and surrendered to let God move through them I tell you what it would be an entirely different service if every single person Within These Walls came with that same attitude and that same willingness yes to be used of God that's right brother it would be amazing you would be blown away with what God would do and perform here in these in this house this morning I know it I know it I know it I know it I'm not even sure where to start well let me start by saying brother Steve thank you thank you for inviting us and you and brother and sister Stacy have have been so um so kind to our family brother Wesley and sister Joyce opening their home to us while here this this weekend and uh I tell you we we're truly blessed um to have the friends that we have yes we are truly blessed and I just want to say a public thank you to them for that invitation and yes we had we had struggles during the night and I'm not going to give Satan um any accolades all right I'm sure you've had struggles during the night but he's a loser God's the winner we're here and I'm not going to go back and revisit the things that was during the night all all I'll say is is the Lord came down and touched little Mila during the night prise God she she she woke up running a a a high temp and um we prayed we woke brother West sister Joyce up in the middle of the night and I hated we hated to do that but when you have a need you want to you want to go to people that you know can touch God as well and it doesn't matter how many you're going to ask I'm going to ask some people to pray so we we interceded and prayed for her and um and this morning she she when she woke up this morning her her temp was much lower and we're just believing and expecting Hallelujah this morning yes of a complete healing touch that's in her body Satan is not going to defeat us no sir he even tried to turn the power off actually he didn't try he he turned the power off at the house this morning I told Brother Wes I said you know we sang that song Take the dearest thing to me I didn't realize there you go he was going to take electricity and warm water from me this morning but that's all right that's all right Satan still defeated he is still defeated I don't want to keep you standing too long um let me read let me read a couple scriptures and then I'll I'll share with you something that that Heather shared with me this morning um but I let me let me share with you out of the out of the book of Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 11 your Bible readers know exactly where I'm at Hebrews 11 verse 11 reads like this through faith yes also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed right and was delivered of a child when she was past age because because she judged him faithful who had promised that's a big because right there we have to judge him Faithfully [Music] the one that gives you the promise there is a job for you to do the promise has been given you receive the promise through faith and judge him come on brother faithful that the one who gave you the promise is faithful to fulfill that promise in The Book of Mark 11 and verse 24 it says therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire on when you pray believe that's a requirement that's right when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them God bless you as you have your seats this morning I pray the Lord will bless the the reading of his word and the the rest of the service this morning I tell you I'm I'm just I'm excited to be here excited to be here just excited to see what God is going to do um I said I wanted to share something that Heather shared with me this morning in the in the early morning hours she um had had clicked on her her uh her Facebook she's sitting there with with Mila and you know Facebook gives you reminders of things if you made a post on a certain day and um so her little reminder popped up that on this day February the 4th in 2019 she made a uh she made a post and she said where there is expectation there is manifestation amen exclamation point amen and she did hash expecting hash believe leaving # watch God do it Glory fast forward five years to this morning I didn't know that she had posted that I didn't know that that was going to pop up on her page right could I didn't I didn't but the message that I want to bring to you this morning I told you the Lord had given me two words three weeks ago the second word is expectation there you go expectation the title I if I if I title this morning I'd say expecting and it shows I think I'm going to be able to do without those this morning praise the Lord I may not even need too many of my notes we'll see preacher's here this morning the anointing is here yes he is here hallelujah praise Lord you know whenever you are expecting how how many how many come expecting this morning right right you're going to have a whole lot of babies yeah that's the truth see we use the term expecting sometimes is anticipating something but then we also use the term expecting is whenever a woman is with child that's right and we say she's expecting see I didn't know see the Lord had already given me that word before you guys ever posted the flyer uh and it had mine and sister Heather's picture on it and it just so happened in that picture she was expecting and it showed it was clear in that picture that she was expecting and I whenever I saw the picture I'm like I get it yeah Lord I I know I'm on the right track am I know I'm on the right track Lord so I believe if I if I remember right there's either four or five sisters in in the church that are expecting somewhere around there five that's a good number Grace it's a good good number five that are expecting now to those that have been around people who women that are expecting they watch things change in their lives yes and things start to change pretty quickly whenever they're with child yes you know a lot of times they diet changes and things that they used to like to eat now they don't like it so much or their body starts rejecting the things that they're trying to put in and the body says no that's not what I need that's not what I want and get that trash out of here and that's what it's what their body will do it will dictate to you I can't take that in anymore during this time of my life because there's a different life that's inside of me and the life that's inside of me is dictating what I can consume heard the life that's inside of me is dictating that I can't eat certain things anymore I have to look at changing my diet yes sir there's even things that places that a pregnant woman can't go right you go to a a theme park and they would have signs that would tell you that you know don't ride this ride if you're pregnant right you know we got restricted U by our by her doctor because of things that was going on and they're like don't travel right because we want you to protect the life that is inside of you so be careful where you're going because we need you to protect that right now takes precedence yes whenever you're pregnant the life that is growing inside of you takes precedence over everything you have to listen to that it it will dictate what's going on you you'll find that you'll Place restrictions upon yourself because of that life that's inside of you and if you you you watch pregnant women as they as they progress you'll see that their walk changes you you'll see that that that that maybe they don't walk as they normally did they they kind of move a little bit and you want to say waddle but you hate I know you do I was thinking that word I didn't know if it was allowed I don't want to be offensive but it it's mean it's it's a it's a waddle um that that takes place and I mean I i' I've watched it um multip times in in our home and there is a change oh yes in the way that they walk yes and that change was because they're expecting there's a new life that's growing there's an inward change that's good brother that starts to make an outward expression right because of the inward change things on the outside will be changing as well and there'll come a time you know in the early stages of pregnancy Sometimes women don't even want people to know right they kind of hide it they'll they'll try to wear clothes that that don't show it exactly because there's a there's this little window of time that either women other people think that maybe she's just putting on weight or right you don't ask that question or is she pregnant and sometimes they're cautious on asking those because if she's not pregnant it could be very offensive oh it looks like you're putting on a little bit of weight are you pregnant no I'm not but see in the early stages it's hard to tell that's right that's right but you give it a little bit of time and then it becomes very apparent that there is definitely something different about that person there is a real life that is developing inside of them yes and that life is changing them come on now and it's becomes very apparent amen and you can tell that they are expecting and it shows right if you become pregnant with the word of God sir you say well finally he's going to preach now I've been preaching the whole time you sure have been preaching the whole time when we become pregnant with his word you'll find that there's changes that happen in your life if you're not finding changes taking place I question whether or not you have been impregnated by the word of God if you can still do all the things that you have always done oh if you still go to all the places that you've always went if you can still have the same conversations oh that's right it might get sticky but if you can still have the same kind of conversations that you've always had see because when a pregnant woman when she's pregnant in that home the conversations change the conversations are concentrated around that life that's right and pretty much where she goes at some point the conversation is going to start is going to twist around and turn to the pregnancy and the life that's living inside of her yes sir but if we can say we can stand here and say I've been impregnated by the word and yet we don't have any changes going on in our life our conversation never goes back to the word I question that right because I I I know I you get around people and it doesn't take long just listening to their conversations you'll find out what their passions are in life it'll either be and nothing against those that like sports I'm not a huge sports fan if it's there I I'll I'll I'll listen to it I'll watch it and go see a game but I'm not it's just not something that I that I like to go right into but there's many people they will sit there and they will quote stat after stat after stat of this baseball player this basketball player this football player I'll hear them at work and they're saying oh such and such game in the NFL and that quarterback used to be a quarterback for this college team and he came from this high school team and they're just spitting off names and places and I'm like how in the world do y'all think of all those things keep track of that and then you say something about church and they're just like oblivious to anything that's scriptural and sometimes you can be at church and tell things about the scripture and the people look at you but they can talk to you about this video game they can talk to you about all sorts of other things but they can't carry on a 5 minute conversation of scripture that's right but they'll sit there and talk to you hours about a basketball game come on and they'll sit and listen to a basketball game or or go to a basketball game and just really enter in and they go and they're excited about it and then people come to church and they're just like I wish Pastor Shelly had not told him that he could have all day it's it's but it's that way it's because there's never been a real change in their life now for you to become pregnant with the word you must spend intimate time with the Lord that's the only way you will be pregnated by the word is if you have intimate time with the Lord you say well how you going to back that up I'll give it to you 1965 God's provided place of worship in this great hour that we're living under this great expectation that's right of the appearing not just of Our Lord but the appearing of our lover the Jesus at any time expecting the appearance of our lover the Lord Jesus now I don't know about you but if you are expecting the appearance of your spouse tell it your lover you clean yourself up you make yourself presentable you you you go and say oh you know we're going to go out and have a special dinner now well I'm going to I'm going to go make sure that I go take a shower I wear good good clean clothes I'm going to I'm going to sanctify myself right because you're expecting come on the appearance of your lover yes sir and people want to come in the church with all sorts of trash on them come they come to church listening to whatever they want to listen to on the radio having conversations about who knows what I don't want to know but their conversations have not got them into a place into an atmosphere that they can walk in and present themsel to their lover they come in and they just become an observer they have not prepared themselves to experience intimacy with Christ right and and I don't have it written down but my mind's going going I think it was it was Joshua I believe told them to sanctify themselves and preparation to see the manifestations to see the Wonders come on now sanctify why why do they need to sanctify themselves just in order to see the wonders of God I mean he's God isn't he going to perform wonders just because he is God but he told them the one place I believe it was Moses that told him go wash your clothes wash wash your clothes sanctify yourselves and in preparation and see the wonders of the he's talking about the on the on the next day watch the wonders of God you can't come to God just any old way your heart has to be clean your mind needs to be clean your life needs to be clean that's right if you expect intimacy that's right with him that's good I believe it in in 1954 the message expectation brother brandom says now if God up there said by his stripes you were healed the Holy Ghost entwines brings that down by the power of God your heart is set on that it says yes by his stripes we are healed God you said in mark 11:24 whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it Lord we prayed for a meeting we've been fasting for a meeting we've been crying for a meeting yes Lord I believe the meetings on the road all right then stand there like oh till the power of God comes down when it hitss it says yes thought it was amazing last night you closed your service singing I'll say yes the next man says yes yes look at you you got double power yes another yes Triple Power yes four times power yes first thing you know it becomes thousands powers of yes then the holy spirit moves in and come confirms the word of God with signs and wonders following that's it that's what we need an expectation that's what we need this morning is to come in we have prepared an atmosphere and now we need to expect the miraculous we need to expect his presence to come in and fill this house and meet every single need but you have to be prepared to receive it that's right you have to be prepared I I wrote wrote this statement down and I I didn't come up with this statement and I don't remember who I heard it from years ago but it said expectation is the breeding ground for the miraculous to happen expectation is the breeding ground for the miraculous to happen when you come expecting in faith believing God can do Mighty things you say well he's God he automatically does mighty things okay Matthew 13:58 says and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief yes he is a mighty working God he sure is but we have a part to play as well right we have to be prepared we have to come expecting we have to create the atmosphere and we have to have a spirit of belief and acceptance of what he's going to do that's right the miraculous cannot happen in an atmosphere of unbelief that's right you hinder the working of God if you have an atmosphere of un unbelief now God can do whatever he wants to do yeah he said what was the scripture God will work and who will let it right I've heard many quote it God will work and who will let him or who will allow him but that's not what that scripture is saying God's going to do a work are you going to be the one that stops him yeah is it your unbelief that stops him now the work will get done but you will you will delay the blessings that happen in your life that's right you can cause yourself to miss out on the miraculous that could take place in your life if you stand in his way if you do not accept and prepare and be ready some people say well I I've been waiting on a promise a long time and for those people I can join in with you right I understand what you're going through I waited on a promise for a long time and it took me a long time to realize that it was my fault that that was holding the promise up and um once I found out once I realized that and that became known to me I got myself in into a place that I could receive what he wanted you know I was I thought that I was expecting in the right way but I really wasn't all right I thought I was going to church living my life every day praying asking God to perform and I thought that I was approaching him in the right way with great expectation to see the miraculous now he did not withhold all of the Miracles out of my family and out of my life I saw many miracles we had the miracle of Jaden coming into into our home the miracle of Savannah coming into our home Jaden's Jaden's story is is an amazing story in and of itself let me just drop this in here right quick we started classes for to become foster parents the very same day that he was born wowow the it was our first class that we went and took classes we had no clue about Jaden right his birth parents were the ones that gave him the name Jaden wow Jaden happens to mean Jehovah has heard wow Jehovah heard Jehovah heard my prayer thank God thank God thank God and if it had not been for the delay I like that Jaden would not have been in our home that's right but see God knew that that this is where he needed to be because he was an elected s God knew that Savannah needed to be in our home because she's an elected seed and he allowed me to walk around the mountain for a long time all right and then whenever we got in the right place and everything was right and he said okay now listen to me open your ears of understanding and listen to what I'm telling you yes sir there is more that I want to give you I want to bless you abundantly far beyond you could even imagine and when Liam came to our home we were just we were ecstatic just overjoyed and we thought that was the Fulfillment that was the completion and then God said you know what you've been faithful you followed What I've told you to do now I'm just going to give you a double blessing and he just poured out his His blessings upon us again and gave mil to to us so I tell you if you really get yourself in the right place and then expect things to happen we've got to be ready first Hallelujah then you can go to God and expect things to happen and watch them happen praise God psalms 27 and4 says wait that's a that's a word that people do not like people do not like the word wait I don't like to wait on most anything I hate going to a restaurant and sitting down and then have to you got to wait to get a table and then you have to wait for them to bring you something to drink and then you drink it really fast and you got to wait a long time for them to bring you something else to drink waiting is difficult for this human flesh it's for For Me Maybe it's not difficult for you but waiting is is something that I struggle with sometimes I don't like to wait on the bathroom to be available to use I don't like to be ready to leave and then have to wait on the rest of the family to be ready to go when I'm ready to leave I'm ready to leave she's not in here that's right I'll find I'll get it later but the scripture says wait and and if you look at that it's it's wait in faith that's it wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord the word wait in the Hebrew is kaval which means if I pronounce that correctly I believe it is kaval which means to t y to patiently patiently wait there you go to look for to Hope and to expect that's the type of waiting that we're to do on the Lord to look for to Hope and to expect I have a little thing that sometimes the Lord gives me words or I'll I'll see words like the word what if um I I wrote a thing down with about what if worry helps anxiety turn into fear true good many times we we struggle with wh ifs wh if this wh if that what if the other and uh and the Lord one day I was at at my office and i' I'd wrote out the the words what if and um then it's just as plain as day he he wrote it out for me worry helps anxiety turn into fear I believe cuz we'll just sit and we'll worry and worry and worry and it takes that anxiety that you have and that anxiety transfers over into fear but on the word waight I was I was there and this came came to me with Assurance I trust that's how I wait with Assurance I trust I have an assurance in the word of God right I know he's not going to fail his word he cannot fail his word I may put a damper on him fulfilling it in the in the timely manner in my life but he is his word will never fail never fail never fails cannot Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away if you look over in the book of Acts as a brother said the other night that doesn't mean that I'm just halfway through it just I was getting a little warm so I thought I would take it off Acts 3 veres 2-8 and a certain man lay from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us right and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said sorry silver and gold woo Have I None right see that's what he was actually expecting from them but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God see he gave heed unto them the scripture says he gave heed unto them with expectation to receive something he just did not realize exactly what he was going to receive he was thinking if I could just get a little bit of money that'll that'll that'll help me get some bread that'll help me make it another day but he did not fully understand through his expectation what he was going to receive that he was going to receive Deliverance uhhuh amen he was going to receive healing he would never have to go and beg again he he just reached up to them and whenever they reached their hand down to him he received a whole lot more than just some silver and gold and if you have a de we have to come with expectation we have to cry out yes sir we have to call out and expect to receive what we have need of Jeremiah 2911 see we we have a lot of expectations of things but in 29 Jeremiah 29:11 it says for I know this is God I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end see he has expectations there's there is a plan that he has for you all right and he's expecting us to take heed and follow that plan that he has for each one of us to come to his expected end exactly I want to be in his expected end not mine cuz mine's going to lead me astray I want to move forward in his expected end if in that scripture the definition of of expected is anticipated awaited hoped for watched for if you look at the word expecting it says to look forward to the probable occurrence or appearance of sorry I didn't give you those definitions to she told me last night if you whatever you give me I'll put up on the the board they can see it and I failed to send that it also means anticipating something to occur I love this that causes a considerable degree of confidence oh yeah oh yeah you really trust and believe that it is going to happen you know there was there was a woman one time with an issue of blood right and she cried out if I could just touch if I she had an expectation she said if I can just touch sir the hymn of His Garment she she believed because she had seen other things take place and she said I have a need and all I've got to do is just get close enough to him just to Touch the Hem of His Garment and if I can do that I have a great expectation that I will receive my healing yes yes because she had seen other things take place sir she had a high probable belief that it would occur for her as well all we have to do is reach out to him yes sir the healer is there we reach out to him in faith believing anticipating looking forward to a completion of something to happen don't just do it haphazardly well it might work if you come with that attitude it won't work you can't come into His presence in a half and a halfway attitude it has to be giving everything it come to him trusting believing expecting looking for it to happen she had confidence she had confidence that it would take place if she could just touch it Noah expected it to rain so he built an ark that's right he didn't wait until the rain started falling that's right amen that's right he had been given a a prophecy he had been given a message from the Lord that's right it's going to rain I'm going to destroy this place you need to prepare you need to have an ark built for the saving of your family that's right so he didn't wait to start seeing raindrops fall right he took the promise and expect expected it to be fulfilled and based on that expectation he started doing something about it he started planning he started building the boat if he had waited it' have been too late that's right see sometimes we receive a promise a word is given to you a word of Prophecy is given to you or you read something in the scripture and you you say Lord I believe you're speaking to me right there and then we just sat on our hands of do nothing and we just wait but we wait in a lacad isical way I'm just going to wait for God to do it all no you've got to start making preparations for it good that's right a couple years ago before before Liam was born before we even knew that that that Liam was going to be born we were having some issues with a vehicle and we're like well I think we're going to to we going to try to trade vehicles and at that time Heather liked the it was a Toyota Sequoia and my sister and brother-in-law had a a sequoia that was used and they were going to get rid of it and they they made us a good deal and and um so we're like okay well we went from a minivan to this Sequoia which is not easy to work with anyway my opinion and um and so we got into that that that Toyota and we drove it for just a little while brother Steve and I just I I could not get past the thought that at some point I'm going to need a van again because I'm believing that God's going to give me another child and finally I I told Heather and she didn't like it at the at the time she she and she liked the look of the Sequoia and she she liked that and and I I said we can't keep this car we've got to go back we've got to go back to a a van I said there's going to be a time that we have to have it and if I don't plan for that then I'm wrong so we went got rid of the the Toyota Sequoia and got went back into a Honda Odyssey and then after that things things transpired and we ended up having Liam and then we ended up having having me after that and we now we've got got out of the The Odyssey we went to a a Kia Carnival I told it's it's my Carnival of uh it's it's all of my monkeys and uh and in my circus and we're we ride around in our Carnival um uh if we we grow much more it's going to have to be something larger uh than that to uh keep us but through expectation I made changes and in and I was like why why am I going to a vehicle that would not fit us for a growing family and then I can and I'm going to walk around and tell people that I believe that I'm going to have more children listen we should hear this if I'm telling people that I'm going to have more children right I better have my house ready and we did we went we bought beds we went and made sure that we had things ready we we started making true preparation in anticipation that's right of a fulfillment of the promise true I did not have any evidence other than the promise right did not have any evidence that it was happening it was taking place and then it did but see we got ourselves in the right place the right position we got ourselves prepared and we entered in through faith with expectation Hallelujah and made oursel ready to receive what God wanted to do in the Book of Daniel 3 verse 16-8 Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter I like that in other words we ain't choosing our words wisely uhuh we don't care if it offends you or not right we're not careful to answer in this manner if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve your Gods serve thy Gods I my computer messes it up nor worship the golden image which thou has set up they were expecting God to show up they were expecting him to show up they said whatever you want to do we don't care because we know know that our God will our God can Hallelujah and we will go toward that fire with expectation that even even if you have to put us in the fire he's still going to show up and he did that's right because they were prepared and they were expecting and they had made their lives ready to receive what he could do that's right I wrote this down the other day it says a revelation of expectation generates a demonstration of preparation all right amen that's a lot a revelation of expectation generates a demonstration of preparation if you want to simplify it put your faith in action if you really believe what you say you believe put your faith in action start building that boat a ditch on dig the ditch make the valley full of ditches if they hadn't the water was going to still come but they wouldn't have been prepared for it that's right make the valley full of ditches 1964 the message when their eyes were open they knew him one little sentence out of that brother Brown says can you imagine the expectation of the appearing of Jesus Christ all right can you imagine the expect of the appearing of Jesus Christ you you look in and look in scripture and whatever the different cities in different towns they were expecting him to come there was a noise abroad sometimes so so much that that the Pharisees would go and and tell them y'all got to stop you've got to be quiet but see the people were expecting his appearance all are we does the life we live show that we are truly expecting his appearance this morning that's right our life must show that it must show that we are expecting his appearance there should be a great excitement Among Us right should be a great excitement Among Us I'm going to uh-oh see I was about to have that problem my phone says one time this is a different time I was thinking M I'm trying I'm trying I don't want to take advantage of people um wouldn't it be nice to to come into a service and know who is truly expecting cuz that's the person I want to sit beside yeah see I don't like to go to if I'm going to go to a ball game I don't want to go to a ball game where somebody doesn't care about being there I want to go to a game that they're going to enter in they're going to get excited they're going to jump no fun other exactly what's the point of going so I don't want to come into church and sit beside somebody that's just going to sit on the preacher right it's just going to be a bump on a log as one person said a bump on a pickle is just going to sit there I want to sit beside somebody who is excited I want to sit beside the person who has a high expectation of what God is going to do and that you're they're going to display that by the way that they worship by the way that they praise that they really are expecting God to come and move if we all had friends like the um the paralytic yeah he couldn't get to Christ but their faith their expectation sir he said even though you can't get to him take you four of them Lord picked him up is that good carried him into the presence of the almighty they get trying to come in the door and there's such a crowd they can't get through the door but see they knew what he needed they knew that he needed to be in his presence and they said you know what well if we can't get to the door we'll go up on top of the roof and we'll open that up amen what dedication what expectation that they must have had I mean that's a lot of work you're going to carry someone who is crippled can't move going to carry them up onto the top of a house tear things apart and lower them down and I'm thinking in their mind they're thinking all we got to do is get him to them we ain't got to carry him back that's right if we can get him in his presence we ain't got to worry about carrying that's the expectation level that they had if we could all have friends like that cuz sometimes we get into a little paralyzed State sometimes in our lives Satan will throw things at you and it kind of it hinders your walk a little bit and you you you feel hindered but then if you can have friends around you that said you know what you need you need to be in church oh yeah need to be in church brother need to be in church sister why you come go to service with me why don't you come over to my house and let's let's play a service let's let's let's play a tape let's let's enter in to that presence and come with an expectation of what God will do all right yeah and I guarantee you if you do that the atmosphere will change and you'll see healings you'll see Miracles transformed you know sometimes it's um it's pretty easy to tell by some people's attitudes their actions that they really are not expecting you can you can see it you can watch the lives you can watch how they talk to you you can watch how they come in a service and sit down and you'll know they're not expecting anything they're just they're they're fulfilling maybe to them what they consider is an obligation that's right and they're just going through motions but they really did not come that's right expecting if you go hunting you expect to kill I don't know if any any brothers that hunt in here no no brothers that hunt oh there's a few that okay it's all right I'm not I'm not judging you for for hunting Carolina yeah yeah no I'm not judging you you but if you're going to go let's say you're going to go bow hunting and you tell people I'm going bow hunting I want to go kill a deer and you show up to your stand you've got your bow but you didn't take any arrows you're not expecting to kill anything true we went out um Jaden went hunting with his grandpa my dad um a couple of months ago and and was successful killed his killed his first deer and we went looking for it he'd shot it and we were following the blood trail for two and a half hours in the night with multiple flashlights following drop by drop by drop and it took a very long time to find it and we get to it we finally do find it and I look at Jaden and I said where's the drag rope and he said it's at the tree stand it's at The Hunting stand I said why didn't you bring the drag rope and he said I didn't think we would find it you didn't think we would find it why do you think we spent two and a half hours looking for it and so then Dad has to take his belt off I thought he was going to take it off to Jaden at first took his belt off and wrapped it around to be able to drag the drag the deer back to the truck but I'm like why would you even do that if you didn't expect that you killed it we're going to spend all this time and you're telling me I left the drag rope all the way back near the truck like no if you you pull the trigger and you're you're going to go look for it you see you hit it make sure you have all the proper equipment with you when you go so you don't you don't don't have to take a belt off and then walk walk back that way it just it blew my mind whenever he told me that well I didn't expect that we'd find it I did I mean that's why I spent that that length of time he was honest he was honest amen let's go let's go to the book of Hebrews 11 verse 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that's telling me that I have to come with expectation I have to come with expectation in the message expectancy 195 53 brother Brown says and if you come expecting to get help from God God will meet your expectancy he always does I love always he always does wherever you go whatever you do what you expect brings your faith Hallelujah brother Brandon would say many times people usually get what they expect they come into a service and they're expecting this or expecting that he said you usually get what you expect in in the Book of John 1 verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth 1963 Christ is the mystery of God revealed says and remember we are now as his bride pregnated with his spirit amen amen oh my the church bearing Children See pregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life right bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the pinenes evidence of his resurrection that's right showing that he is not dead but alive forever more what what is showing that the signs that you're doing that's that's showing that he's alive this is eternal life and Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in Him Praise the Lord praise the lord we are alive in him yeah you may not be able to see when you and and some people this is It's is hard for them somebody will come into a into a church or they come into Christ they they they're they're new in into the body of Christ and and Christ starts dealing with their life and they they accept God they accept him as their savior they receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you say well I can't see VIs visible evidence that God is doing something in their life yet give it time give it time they're a new they're a new babe let him grow let him work let him do the work that's in their life because if they are truly with child if they have received his seed that's good brother sir it may take a little time not every one of the sisters that's in this church that have had children all present the same once they get pregnant some take longer to show there there's some that you they they show really quickly right and and people will notice I believe she's pregnant right there's a glow about her or there's a little more more belly about her I'm trying to be very cautious with the words that I use but some take a little bit longer to show they may go all the way through first trimester and almost to the end of the second trimester before you really see that outward appearance that would indicate that they're pregnant others and in some after you've had one or two sometimes it shows earlier but not everybody is the same whenever they natur I'm talking natural pregnancy not everybody's the same and not everybody's the same with our spiritual pregnancy not everybody grows at the same rate in the same Pace they are going to be growing oh yeah they have to be growing that's right I don't want to I I'll get in trouble say too much on that I'm growing too but I'm not pregnant um not I'm pregnant with his word um y'all forgive my Folly in the Book of Luke chapter 6 verse 43 3 through 45 for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit right for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of Bramble Bush gather they grapes a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bring bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh too many people say one thing and live another thing they'll profess one thing and they don't possess what they profess they live one life and they try to say that they believe and that they trust God but the life that they're living does not match up with the profession that they're saying Matthew 15: 7-1 says ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah isaas prophesy of you saying this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips right but their heart is far from me come on in vain they do worship me he acknowledged that they were worshiping him but they were worshiping in vain teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men and he called the multitude and said hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth defileth a man if you don't put the right stuff in the wrong stuff is going to be coming out you've got to put the right stuff in there's a lot of people that are just like the Pharisees today that fulfill the scripture second Timothy uh 3:5 says having a form of godliness having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from search from such turn away and I wrote a note that says it's too late to be playing church we ain't got time to be playing church we have no time to be playing church at all Paul had a testimony in Corin to the Corinthians he said in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstr ation of the spirit and of power if Christ is formed in you and we say that Christ is being formed in us how many believes that Christ is being formed in you if Christ is formed in you you will do the works of Christ that is a testimony that Christ is truly being formed in you when you start doing the works of Christ in 1965 invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother brandham says now we School our Seminary students in all kinds of Bible theology and things like that man-made theology it's got a bunch of church just exactly a Leota like God said it would be oh my when I look at that it makes me shiver pregnant ated with intellectual conceptions and I'm not telling you that this is just in the world this is in the ranks of the so-called message cly truth they have become pregnated with intellectual right conceptions that's right he said you've got to be a high school graduate before you can even enter you've got to have got to stand before a psychiatrist before you can be ordained on would you imagine Peter James and John going before a psychiatrist remember that 120 up there couldn't even sign their own name stand before a psychiatrist see if if all their their reflex was just right and so forth he said they had a reflex but it wasn't an intellectual conception or scientific research it was through the power of God when it struck them and I love this they know nothing to do but act out what the Holy Ghost said do they couldn't help it they didn't know what else to do just act out what the Holy Ghost said do they didn't pay any attention to any intellectual what the church said and what the priest said and what this said and that said they moved by the spirit moved by the spirit sir Fearless men 1 John 2:15 he said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is excuse me not even in you see so how can you be pregnated with the word of God which condemns the world condemns Hollywood condemns all of its Fashions condemns all these parties and carrying on and so called that they have in the name of religion it condemns it he said how can you be pregnated you can't be pregnated Christ is not going to impregnate a body that's full of sin ain't going to happen can't happen you must be clean must be chased yeah you've got to be clean to receive him it's the only way it's going to work he he will not impregnate the something that is full of the world yeah it has to be it has to be the same as him he has to place his Spirit within you right we have we have a spirit his Spirit has to be placed within you for them to then pregnate you with the word of God but people just they go on living any old life that they want to live but my Bible says what communion hath light with Darkness what Concord hath Christ with Bal see they're pretending to be Christians like people pretend things in in roleplay games these live roleplay if anybody's ever read about these different live that people actually go and they'll they uh do live roleplay they'll dress up in all types of Garb and reenactment things and and um and act like they're this character they'll take on all sorts of things about them they'll learn languages that's supposed to be for that character and they'll present that and they they just I don't know it's confusing to me uh I have a difficult time just being who I'm supposed to be not trying to pretend I'm somebody else if you're going to pretend I don't I don't say you need to pretend let me let me change that if you're going to role play find you character in the scripture and follow that if you feel like you've got to do roleplay games or something like that follow that find find yourself in the scripture and follow that live up to those standards don't live up to these things that's going on in the world don't don't find yourself consumed with those things that's going on in the world find yourself in the scripture oh yes and dress accordingly dress the appropriate attire that you're supposed to dress according to the scripture speak the language that you're supposed to speak according to the scripture I talked about last night not being conformed you know we don't want to be conformed we want to be transformed there's a there's a word I don't know if how many have heard this word um uh when dealing with pregnancies uh there's a word called pseudois and I don't know if anybody here is has ever heard heard that word anybody one of the brothers in the back okay pseudois is I'll give you the definition it says the appearance of clinical or subclinical signs and symptoms associated with pregnancy although the individual is not physically carrying a baby pseudois in other words it's a term called false pregnant yes it's referred to as phantom pregnancy see my mother went through pseudois before I was born she went through a time that she felt as though she was pregnant she had signs things changing in her body that caused her to believe that she was pregnant different things changing and all this and and it was really it was all because of her mind so she really wasn't pregnant and the way that they found out that she wasn't pregnant is that she went and took a blood test and the blood test showed whether or not there was true pregnancy or not we let that sink in for a second well see some people have signs in their body whenever they come into church and it starts looking like maybe the word has taken place in them and there will even be some outward appearances right you'll see them change the way they dress you'll see them change their conversation to start matching the conversations that's within the church body yes you'll see different outward signs but whenever it comes down to it it's really just a phantom pregnancy they are not with child of the word all they've done is pretended but see in their mind the intellectual as we spoke about a few minutes ago intellectually they believe that they've received something and they haven't they haven't received the seed yet from the word and his life is not truly growing in them see whenever you when you when you become pregnant they they go and they do um sonograms ultrasounds I was fascinated brother Steve to go in and watch the ultrasounds being taken because see it it I'm I'm sitting there in in that room about to Rejoice because I'm I'm sitting there I knew I I was asking the sonographer questions and I knew already knew the answers to it but I was like how does this even work and she saids well you see the image that you're going to see on this screen is presented because the device that I'm using is going to send sound waves through the body and it's going to project the image based on the sound waves bouncing off of it and it will create an image she said now when we look at that image we have what is the standard of that image is supposed to look like and we base as we study that image we base it off of our learning and off of our training we know what it should look like and if it doesn't look like what it says right there then we need to call somebody and talk to them and I'm sitting there in that room and I'm saying yes because when the word is preached oh yeah the sound waves are coming forth you know what the word is doing it's an ultrasound that's happening in every Service as the word Goes Forth it reflects off of each one of usah and it presents an image because of the words being spoken that voice is being spoken the sound waves of the voice is being spoken over your life and it's projecting an image yes now we've got to look at that image that's projecting and then look at this image which is our standard and if this image that's being projected as the word comes forth does not match up with the image which is they' they've been taught is the standard image we've got to check up we've got to find out what the problem is Right we've got to have this is a spiritual ultrasound this morning the word is going forth the word is bouncing off of your life and the word itself is going to present an image and that image is supposed to be Christ prise Lord anything that's unlike himen needs to be cut away it needs to be taken away as the word Goes Forth it shows us what is like Christ and what is not like Christ and it will show that will also be a way to find out whether someone is truly pregnant they think they're pregnant so they go in they do an ultrasound and they'll check that ultrasound through the imagery that's that is produced and they'll say yes or they'll say no but that's what's happening whenever you come to church that word is being preached and it's Bouncing Off Of You creating those the the sound letting the sound waves create bounce off of you and generate an image and it will tell you whether or not you are truly pregnant or if it's just pseudois or if it's just a false pregnancy or if it's just a put on you just think that you have received seed and you haven't yet and if that's the image that P that jumps up on the screen and shows us that we haven't truly received we need to stop and we need to say Lord what have what what am I doing wrong yes sir what is it in my life that's preventing yes the impregnation of the word of God right because at the at the stage that we are living in right now we should be pregnant expecting and it should show right it should show by now I saw sister Jenna the other day when we when we came in and I said I said God bless you you look pregnant and Heather said Twain I saidwhat that's the right thing to say it to me it is but she looks pregnant because she is pregnant now it' be awkward if she wasn't pregnant and you said you look pregnant but see I knew that she was see we had a situation at our church that that one of the sisters there and some of the brothers and different ones would say oh well you look really big you look really big I'm like y'all that's probably not what what she wants to hear why don't you just say you look pregnant and leave it at that you know you could you choose not to but I was acknowledging that she was with child wow and it was fitting with my message so that's why I had to acknowledge it if you if you bring it back to a a blood test this morning take it to a blood test take it to a blood test and find out are you truly impregnated with his word or not is it just a lot of falsehoods going around you I don't want it to be that I want to know that his word has been born in the manger of my heart this morning that's right in Galatians 5 19- 25 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness reings and everybody in the church says none of those apply to me none of those apply to me and then it kicks in and such like and that's where we get hit sometimes the suchlike right of the which I tell you before as I've also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are in that are Christ have crucified the flesh that's rough yes sir youve crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit in other words let the life that you live match what you possess let it the life that you live match what you profess this morning the more that Jesus is formed in us the greater the manifestation of his Spirit right there will be a greater demonstration of a risen Life of Christ and the corrupt works of the flesh will fade and drop away thank you Jesus are you beginning to show thank you Jesus is your life beginning to show his life this morning good question there should be a visible change reflecting on the outside of what's happening on the inside 1961 if God be with us where is all the Miracles and you know theou in your heart that a supernatural work has been done by a supernatural being when you once drank and smoked and lied and you women loved the world so much you kept wearing your makeup and your long or short hair and doing other things you did see some people wouldn't read this quote Oh I done run him off too I thought he agreed with this one and doing other things you did and you find out there something happens that all the devils in Hell couldn't make you do it again something happened a god of Miracles performed what did he do changed your vile heart changed your desires changed your nature a supernatural word by a supernatural God made a creature of time to a creature of Eternity amen took the world out of you and put Christ in you the hope of glory and you're filled with his spirit and ready to meet him if you're not filled with his spirit you are not ready to meet him can I say it that way if you're not filled with his Spirit you are not ready to meet him there has to be a new life inside of me the old man is gone the old desires are gone the new life does not feed on the filth of the world as a pregnant woman her diet changes as we become impregnated with the word our diet will change and you can no longer feed on the same trash that you fed on before that life became evident inside you it will make you sick the spirit of God the Life of Christ cannot feed on the trash of the world it feeds on the revealed present day word that's what it feeds on on the revealed present day word if you try to eat from some of the old things in your your past the new life will let you know right quick don't agree with it it will spew it out it will cause you to spew it back up kick the trash out there is a new creation that desires the word of God the bride of Christ has been impregnated Yeah by his word amen and today it is Christ that's being formed in you and in me and I tell you we should be showing by now we should be showing by now that his word has been born in the manger of my heart that's what the lord gave to me for you this morning I pray that it is a blessing to you and I and I pray that is an encouragement to you and if if you feel like you know that maybe I'm not presenting the way I should be presenting that yes I've claimed that I've received seed from him but my life is not truly matching up whenever I have when the word comes forth and it's do creating that ultrasound and I look at that image that I've yet to see my image and His Image perfectly aligned if that be the case don't leave this morning God can come down and he can minister to you and he can cut away yes he can use his word to cut away the things that's unlike him so we can produce the true image of Christ which is what we're supposed to produce God bless you would you stand with me this morning maybe as we turn the service back over we could just sing that chorus once again I didn't mean to run the preacher off this morning I pray he forgives me I love you all this morning I can't I can't express that enough so privileged to uh to have the friendship that I that I have here and and the the love that's expressed through this congregation is such a blessing it's such a blessing and I I'm so thankful and so so privileged to call you all friends this morning let your word be [Music] born
