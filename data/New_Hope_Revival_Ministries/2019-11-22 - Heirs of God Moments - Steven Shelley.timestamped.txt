[0:00] you have every right to claim the same
[0:04] portion that has been allotted of the
[0:07] Father to Jesus Christ you have every
[0:18] right to claim the same portion that has
[0:22] been allotted of the father to Jesus
[0:25] Christ you are not only joint heirs but
[0:29] you have the same promise that he had
[0:33] and the same life and if we have the
[0:39] same promise and the same life we should
[0:41] believe for the same power everything
[0:44] Christ inherited from the eternal spirit
[0:48] of the Father we are entitled to that by
[0:52] election and by his precious blood price
[0:55] it is ours the scripture said it's yours
[0:59] heirs of God join heirs with Christ if
[1:02] so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:07] may be also glorified together amen and
[1:12] did you know that according to the New
[1:15] Testament I suffered with him before I
[1:18] was ever born
[1:19] because Paul said I was crucified with
[1:22] him and if you made it to the
[1:25] crucifixion in the mind of God
[1:27] you made it through the suffering in the
[1:29] mind of God and if you made it through
[1:32] the crucifixion in the mind of God you
[1:34] made it through the resurrection in the
[1:36] mind of God as we are gathered here in
[1:40] his name with truth and under truth we
[1:43] are seated here together and
[1:46] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that is
[1:50] not a location that is a revelation not
[1:54] a location or a proximity that is a
[1:57] revelation amen
[1:59] so in the midst of your chunk in the
[2:03] midst of your hell am i permitted to say
[2:06] that in the midst of all of that we are
[2:11] seated because of truth
[2:15] we are sated together with Christ in
[2:19] heavenly places heirs of God joint heirs
[2:24] with Jesus Christ
[2:27] [Music]
