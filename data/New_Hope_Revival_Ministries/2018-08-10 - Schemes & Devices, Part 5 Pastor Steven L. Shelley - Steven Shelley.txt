TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope award [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelly I want to welcome you to the program today again it is a wonderful joy to be able to speak to you the wonderful glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the truth of the gospel and we're just thankful for this opportunity we appreciate the gospel Channel I know many of you watching this program really appreciate the quality Christian programming that's available to you 24 hours a day on the gospel Channel and I appreciate those brothers and sisters very very much and I consider it a real honor to partner with them in getting these programs to you we have had a beautiful response to this series that we've been working on now today we'll be number five in a series that we call schemes and devices and the response has been really exciting to us so many of you have called with your prayer requests and with your precious comments and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart I want to thank you that some of you have chosen to sow into the ministry and we appreciate that very much many of you have partnered with the gospel channel because we've encouraged you to do so and we want to thank you for that as well I'd like to say I appreciate your confidence in us that you would sometimes bare you know your heart to us on the machine sometimes if it's during our regular hours you may have a live brother or sister to pray with you otherwise you're leaving your prayer requests on our machine and we're taking that to the Lord in fact as I'm taping this program right now there are saints of God in one of the prayer chapels here on our property praying for you praying for me that we could be used of the Lord today and that God would minister to your needs so I want to say again we take your prayer requests most seriously and we have learned through the years the great power in prayer time would not permit me today and in fact I would have to make a list to to even begin to tell you the joys of answered prayer in my own life through the years what we have seen the Lord do many of you have called and written emailed to say that you're in a spiritual battle and that you need prayer support to get through that battle and I believe that's one of the reasons why the Lord directed us to bring you this series because as a roaring lion the enemy is certainly roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour but the theme of these programs is found in 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices we're learning together in this study some of the ways that the enemy is attacking the believer in this hour and we're learning strategies to overcome every scheme and every device that the enemy would throw against the child of God in this hour and let me remind you with encouragement we win by the grace of God there is no battle too severe for Jesus who is the victor and he gives us the victory we become his victory in the battles of life I'd like for us to go back today to where we left off in program four and let me remind you that if for some reason you've missed the programs we have a YouTube channel and I'm sure they'll give you the information of how to get there on the screen at some point during the program but I assume you could look up new hope revival ministries in the search field of YouTube find our Channel and let me invite you to subscribe if you'd like to do something that would be an encouragement to our staff would you subscribe to our youtube channel it blesses us to know and then you get a notification when we add new content to the channel if you've missed parts one through four in the series schemes and devices they're all available to you free of charge on YouTube and I encourage you to go back and listen to those again and again I had a note from someone today who said to me this was not through television but a saint of God in the Philippines wrote today and said your YouTube channel is being used of God to minister to me in a very personal way I don't know what the needs are in that family but the Lord knows and it's exciting for us to think that a YouTube channel with these programs and other good content would be able to reach much farther than even the gospel channel even the world wide web is such a wonderful way now to take the gospel to the ends of the earth and I was just delighted about that let's go to the scripture that we closed we had the last time we were together in 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 verses 3 through 6 and I've read them for you already in the King James Version and to conserve time because I have a lot I want to share with you today let's just do them again in the amplified instead of both but I encourage you to always look at the scripture in the King James version of the Bible I think it's a wonderful source of God's Word and then you may find other translations that will bless you and we use the amplified sometimes because we believe it amplifies the scripture and there might be a few places in there that that I would say maybe it didn't line up quite as properly as I would like for it to but I think you'll be blessed by this particular portion of scripture today 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 verses 3 through 6 and the amplified for though we walk live in the flesh we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons remember we talked about the fact that we have been given spiritual weapons to fight a spiritual war that manifests in the natural realm we've got to be able to discern and remember that the battle is it seems to be raging in the natural realm the circumstances of the battle are manifesting in the natural realm but the victory for the battle is never achieved in the natural realm it's always achieved in the spiritual realm using spiritual weapons the Word of God the authority of the blood of Jesus Christ and the authority of his precious name the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah what greater weapons could we have the blood the name the word this is powerful weapons to use against the enemy alright in verse 4 the weapons of our warfare are not physical weapons of flesh and blood but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds we were talking about strongholds we were talking about death structures and how that certain thoughts and certain lies of the enemy began to form a framework around our lives that become strongholds that the enemy will use against us over and over and over again so we've got to learn the spiritual weapons that are at our disposal for not only overthrowing those spiritual strongholds but to destroy them so that they can never be used against us again remember we talked about recently that the anointing the power of the anointing the authority in the anointing of the Holy Spirit it's not just to break yokes indeed it does that but it also destroys the yokes of the enemy so we're going to believe that as we learn and discover how the enemy operates and what we've been given to counteract the attack of the enemy that we will learn not only to break down tear down rip down these strongholds but continue in prayer continue applying the weapons that God has given us in the spirit until we see the utter and ultimate destruction of these strongholds that the enemy has raised up over our lives verse five in as much as we refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of God I don't know if that portion of Scripture resonates with you like it resonates with me but it speaks to me I feel life in these words we are chosen and called of God and given authority and power to refute to refuse the arguments the theories the reasonings the proud and lofty thoughts and things that the enemy uses to seduce us to beguile us into believing a lie instead of the truth the time has come saints of God to refuse to agree with the devil's lies about your life and destiny and the time has come to bring yourself into alignment and into position with with the authority that God gives us through his word to ultimately defeat every one of these proud lofty things these reasonings these theories these arguments I want to see every one of them ripped down and destroyed in my life and in your life for the glory of God we're not just here fighting as someone who is beating the air and we don't know what we're fighting against oh no we're uncovering the enemy today we're taking the cover off and we're going to see him for who he really is the great impostor the great deceiver the original kleptomaniac who comes as a thief to steal to kill and to destroy to tear down to uproot but Jesus is the remedy and he said I have come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly I'm telling you there's victory and there is an abundant life to the believer but it doesn't fall upon us like ripe cherries from a tree there is an activation of faith that is required faith must become a revelation in your life and you must use that revealed faith that faith that has been super-nice truly revealed to you by the Spirit of God you must actively use that against the same old worn-out tactics of your enemy it just it never really ceases to amaze me how the enemy will take the same old thing and use it over and over again how does he get by how does the enemy get by using the same old worn-out trick in your life I'll tell you how he has built a structure he has built a foundational structure around us which we define in this study as a stronghold one lie upon another lie upon another lie upon another lie until it becomes a woven I want to say inner woven in the fiber of how you think about yourself he starts telling you you you're a failure and you're born in the wrong family and you're never been anything but a shame and and a disgrace and you'll never be and then on and on and on and on it goes I've been able to sometimes recognize these strongholds in my life and how they operate by how my thoughts direct a thought will come of defeat or a failure of not accomplishing enough for the kingdom of God let me tell you something God will never bring that spirit of condemnation on you for not doing enough for the kingdom of God he'll bring conviction which strengthens you in hope to keep pushing forward to do more for the kingdom of God but he never brings that guilt and shame because you haven't done enough or because you weren't able to to achieve and succeed in everything that you set forth to do but I've been able to recognize and I can almost predict in fact I have what the next thought and the next thought and the next thought will be until I find myself on this little trail of thoughts and what they're really doing is one leading to another to another to another to become a stronghold in life that leads to depression that leads to ultimate defeat and that defeat that depression that nervousness then will paralyze us from using the weapons that we have been given India Bluff isn't the devil a bluff when you really hear how he operates and how unfairly he operates against the believer he really only utilizes the power that we allow him to have in our lives and we just fall like innocent victims into these traps where one thought I like to say piggy backs on another thought and that thought piggy backs on another thought until you have spent an hour in total defeat accomplishing nothing but but sort of licking your wounds and singing woe is me and living a life of defeat that Jesus he never intended for you and I as children of God as true believers to live in defeat even when we make mistakes even when we do fail even when we do fall short and we don't succeed at what we set out to do he wants to bring conviction that causes us to press in a little harder but remember when it's the Spirit of God there's always a measure of Hope involved of how we can correct our path and what we will see happen if we choose to be obedient rather than to disobey and break covenant so let's finish this verse of scripture where we're refuting arguments we're refuting theories and reasonings we're pulling down proud and lofty things that set themselves up against the true knowledge of God not just a head knowledge of who God is but an intimate knowing to know God to lean on God to draw your strength from God I want you to know that there is a source of strength that is more effective than your vitamins or as you might say in the UK vitamins there is a source of strength that is more powerful more sustaining more productive than even eating your leafy green vegetables we're talking about a source of strength found in intimate knowing of Jesus Christ leaning on him knowing that on my best day giving forth my best efforts I do fall short I would be a failure every time but because I'm drawing strength from him for my destiny for his destiny purposes in me to be fulfilled because I've learned he is my source I don't always remember it I have to remind myself sometimes I've made it way down the bunny trail of thoughts those piggyback thoughts that build strongholds sometimes I've made it way down five or six connected thoughts before I'm able to quickly discern and recognize hey wait a minute I don't have to sit here and think like this listen to this other voice that is not the voice of my beloved it's not the voice of the one who loves me so much that he not only gave his own life and shed his own blood to redeem me but he constantly lives he lives for the purpose of sustaining me and strengthening me and interceding on my behalf all what a great High Priest we have in the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah so if the thought is not in in alignment if it's if it doesn't fit with the truth of God's Word we must reject it and dig it up and cast it out even by the roots being verse six being in readiness to punish every insubordinate for his disobedience when you your own submission and obedience as a church are fully secured and complete that basically says we've got a lot of things we need to take care of in our own individual lives before we're ready to execute a lot of judgment on someone else this is just sound teaching that the Apostle Paul is giving to the church at Corinth so much like the advice and the commandment of our Lord Jesus Christ when he tells us how how to judge what is the right way to make a judgment and what is the incorrect way and when he tells us that we should not be concerned about the smallest particle in our in our neighbors eye when we have some other large bisetta ng sin or work of doubt and disobedience in our own life I like to compare those to the the toothpick and the telephone pole you know it's like trying to deal with the toothpick in your eye when I have a telephone pole in my own eye it's not a good idea the scriptures are clear but Satan would rather you spend all of your time focusing on judging someone else finding the hypocrisy in someone else's life because he knows if he can cause us to focus on where others are not measuring up we want discover God's perfect plan for how we need to step up to the Commission that he has given us in this hour again he desires to deceive and to seduce and to pull the wool over our eyes but we're exposing him today and if you let the Spirit of the Lord quicken this and make this real to you you'll be able to have to catch him when he approaches you the time we must always remember that the Apostle Paul instructed us not to fight with our carnal understandings or reasonings but to totally rely on God's Spirit as we battle against spiritual forces we have the Holy Spirit of God to help us fight the good fight of faith from and in the realm of the Spirit I want to give you today a three fold strategy I'm not the best when it comes to to giving a list of things or bullet points or step one step two step three and frankly I know a lot of people are burned out with the whole idea of step one step two step three but if this strategy is found in the scripture then it's inspired of God and it has to work you say all brother Shelly it may work in your life but I know it won't work in my life well that's not how you need to approach God's Word any way any strategy revealed to us in God's Word has to work in your life if you approach it with the right attitude in faith and hope and in surrender it has to work God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he would have need to repent if God said it that settles it and it can work and it will work and it must work in our lives the three fold strategy to pull down strongholds and to raise up in a in a new place in Christ in this hour he's found in verse 5 of 2nd Corinthians 10 that we were just reading King James says casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ that's the threefold strategy for dealing with the strongholds of the enemy we are number one we're encouraged by the scripture let me give you it again 2nd Corinthians 10 and verse 5 we are encouraged in the scripture to number one cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the true knowledge of God that is not an automatic thing it's something that requires focus it requires that we do something with in a conscious way we have to be able to recognize when the enemy is flooding our mind with imaginations that are not according to God's Word when the enemy will give us these long made-up scenarios scenarios that that what if what if what if what if what if what if and we can get so bogged down in the what-ifs that it makes you know the normal process of grief can be greatly greatly magnified if you get caught up in that cycle of what-ifs God doesn't want us living in the what-ifs or the maybe souls and and and it could have been and should have been and would have been he wants us walking with Him daily led by the Holy Spirit knowing that every weapon we need to win is given to us and Jesus desires to make us his victory what could be more powerful than that so number one in the three fold strategy cast down imaginations recognize when your thoughts are running wild and are no longer in accordance with God's truth concerning who you are and why you are here on this planet number two we have to bring into captivity every thought I want you to I'm gonna say this and somebody's gonna laugh at me but I'm gonna say it anyway when I was when I was a boy I I didn't have computers and things like that to play with until I was much older and so video games and that kind of stuff didn't didn't come around for quite a while one of my favorite things to play and I know it's politically incorrect I do I know it probably wasn't the best thing to play but but I like to play cowboys and Indians and and to be honest with you it didn't really matter to me which which one I was it didn't matter to me if I was a cowboy it didn't matter to me if I was an Indian I just enjoyed the chase I enjoyed the fun of course not discerning the depth of what I was playing and the and the effect that these kinds of things have had on history in our nation and of course I would in no way support the mistreatment of anybody any Native American or Indian or even a cowboy for that matter but in those days we would round up and and you know the truth is as a cowboy I would corral Indians and as an Indian I would Corral Cowboys it didn't matter which side of the game I played on in fact most everybody I play played with as a child wanted to be the Cowboys so quite often I would be an Indian but the truth is the game was to chase each other through the woods through the neighborhood and take each other captive and and corral them you know we would set aside a designated place and you would be so to speak a prisoner of war and you had to sit there until the game was over I want you to think something similar something that you can relate to perhaps a game that you played or an experience that you've had in life and I want you to recognize that this is what we have to do with our own thoughts I don't laugh too hard the neighbor may hear you but it's absolutely the truth we have an obligation according to 2nd Corinthians 10:5 to exercise the second phase of the threefold strategy of bringing down strongholds and that is to Corral to gather up all of our stray thoughts and submit them we must force them into submission to the very truth the amplified said that we should take them captive and bring them into the obedience of Christ the Messiah The Anointed One so what we're doing is we're corralling our thoughts and we're forcing them to submit to what God's Word has said a quick example that comes to my mind we're trying to believe God for healing and the symptoms get worse and the enemy will say see there you're not healed God doesn't heal today he hasn't healed since the days of the Apostles you're going to die there is no healing and it could go on and on and oh see there that spot is is looking more angry on your body your fever is going higher whatever the circumstances are he begins to send those lies and I'm telling you if you listen to two or three of those lies you'll start agreeing with them you know you go to the mirror and you'll say oh yes I look like death warmed over I guess I guess it's right I guess my symptoms are getting worse but I've so believed for my healing and now I I'm just so defeated I just don't even know if God loves me I don't even know if he still heals today maybe that's an extreme example but you take those thoughts for instance one God doesn't heal today take that you take that thought captive and pull it down and force that thought to be submitted to what God's Word says about sickness you know just stick it under here so to speak and force that thought to listen to what the truth is the truth says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed we were healed it is a finished work show the devil show that thought take that thought captive and read the scripture Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever take that thought over here to the Gospels and read about them healing deliverance ministry of Jesus Christ and then flip back over there to Hebrews and say you see here you dirty thought you live from my enemy if he ever healed the sick he's still a healer if he ever delivered the oppressed he is still a deliverer what you're doing is you're taking it didn't say only negative thoughts it actually said every thought every thought somehow someone said I remember teaching this in our church and and someone saying you mean thirty thousand thoughts a day have to each one be no but if we could it would be a good idea but remember how thoughts piggyback on one another so you can usually take out several hundred thoughts that at once by taking the main thought and submitting that to the Word of God and you'll find out that it does not fit and when you find out that that thought after you've taken a captive and wouldn't let it run wild in your head you've forced it to the obedience of God's Word you are gonna submit you-you-you thought you are gonna submit this this could perhaps be alive the devil in my mind and I'm going to force you to submit to the truth of God's Word you see there comes a time in our life that we're not listening to the loudest voice and we're not believing the majority of thoughts we're believing the right thoughts and we're listening to the right voice which is the voice of our Shepard of whom we are his sheep and we know his voice and a stranger we refuse to follow but the truth is that many of us like sheep are led astray by our own thought process this is one of the major schemes and devices that the enemy is using against the believer in this hour that battlefield of the mind but here is the scriptural strategy number one again casting down imaginations in every high and lofty thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and number two bringing into captivity and submitting every thought to the obedience of Jesus Christ and number three then we must become obedient to God to his word to his divine leadership and direction in our life we can't continue to rebel against the Word of God and expect the truth of God's Word to work for us like a lucky charm like a rabbit's foot or a horseshoe that someone puts over the door most of us know these things as superstitions and we don't want anything to do with them but you'd be surprised how many believers in this hour we'll approach the Word of God as though it were a four-leaf clover as though it were a lucky charm or an amulet of some kind and when it didn't seem to work they say just as I thought they'd forget that there's a there's a strategy in in in causing in activating the Word of God the word of covenant it has to be activated in our lives as individuals and that is by faith through obedience we must obey the Word of God and it seems to some like such a daunting task but what I have found out and I remember mentioning this in a broadcast recently what I have found out is I choose to understand what the scriptures say the commandments of the Lord the instructions of the Lord are not Grievous to those who love him when you love the Lord you want to please him you don't always succeed at it but your greatest desire is to not disappoint him to bring him joy to obey Him to follow his leadership thanks be to God that when we misstep when we miss the mark when we fail thank you Lord that we have an advocate with the father we have a way of escape we have a great attorney standing in our defense but that doesn't give us an excuse to never try to obey again it's very very important if we are expecting this strategy to work of casting down every imagination that exalts itself against the true knowledge of God and if we expect to be able to find victory by bringing every thought into captivity and forcing that thought to submit to the truth of God's Word if it doesn't line up with the truth of God's Word we refute that thought we reject that theory we're we're we absolutely refuse to believe those things ever again if we expect that to work we must also find a place of surrender in our lives to be obedient to God's Word to the wooing and the drawing and the leadership of the Holy Spirit to seek to know God's divine direction for your life it's important in this hour if we're going to use these strategies of God against the schemes and devices of the enemy it's important that we live a laid down life a surrendered life in other words one of the things that Laodicea the seventh of the church churches that were listed in Asia Minor and we believe that those seven churches and their characteristics were not just speaking about that time period but in fact those predominant weaknesses shortcomings and even sins that were represented in those seven churches have laid we should say overlaid across church history for many many many years 2,000 years of church history we may not be able to pinpoint them to the day in the hour that one ended and the next one began but we can certainly see through the shifts of political power and religious power in church history we can certainly begin to identify years where a church age was drawing to an end and a new church age was beginning if this is true and I believe it certainly is we are then living in the end of Laodicea the seventh the last of those Church age periods and one of the predominant things that that we know about the church at Laodicea and the spirit of this Laodicean church age is it was the the day of of people's rights it was it was a predominant movement in that hour too demand your rights even if your rights were contrary to God's plan or God's Word it's going to be very important in this hour that if we're going to achieve this place of becoming the lord's victory by defeating the schemes and devices of the enemy it's vitally important friend that we find a place of being able and willing to lay down our rights we're not banging on the table demanding our way any longer we now recognize that we are not our own we have indeed been bought with a price an incorruptible price a price that few of us have been able to even scratch the surface of understanding the life's blood of God blood that God created for the specific purpose of redemption placing that blood in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ who was the Word made flesh and that precious blood paying a price for you and I to be not just covered but completely redeemed back to God's original thoughts and plans concerning our life you see through the work of redemption it doesn't matter how far off the path you've gone it doesn't matter how vile your sins have been it doesn't matter how much time you spent running from the truth of God by his work of redemption in your life you become justified and we like to say that's just if I'd never sinned this is a work of Grace and a work of beauty that God wants to execute in your life and when you come under the influence and under the understanding of what redemption is it's it somehow makes it easier to find that place of saying yes Lord yes Lord not my will not my rights not what I want I want to live a laid down life of service and obedience to you so in order for this threefold strategy given to us in 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 in order for that to work in tearing down strongholds and dealing with the with the works of the enemy and his lies and devices against us we've got to finish all three we've got to make sure that we're being sensitive to the leadership of the Lord in our life and we're saying a great big amen to what he's calling us into in this hour part of living in a place of maintained victory because I don't want to just defeat a thought process and go on to have something worse I want to come to a place of being able to recognize throw up a thought process before it comes into being a stronghold that the enemy can use against me over and over again I want to walk in a place of maintained victory if Jesus is the victor and Jesus is living inside of me I become the victory his victory his reward and so I want to find that place of walking in maintained victory and the only way we can do that is to is to make sure that we're not giving ourselves that we're not yielding to the enemy in what he's trying to accomplish when you recognize the enemy working in something get away from that if he's working in your thoughts you pull those thoughts down and begin to think the truth of God's Word and speak it somebody said I can't silence the voice of doubt in my head or yes you can you get in your stand in the middle of your floor and read God's truth read it right out loud there's such power in the spoken word there's such Authority in the spoken word we're called as believers to both decree and to declare the truth of God's Word and it's hard to listen to the enemy when you're speaking the truth of God's Word into the atmosphere okay maybe someone will think you're crazy but I'll tell you that that is actually an expression of great sanity because it means that you have come to recognize that in every way that the enemy comes against you God has a way out remember what the scripture said with every temptation with every situation instead of circumstances that Satan races up in your life to defeat you God is opening a door God is opening an opportunity for you to step away from that temptation for you to step away from that process of destruction and come into agreement with God's Word who wouldn't want to serve a god like that the truth is we've got to make sure that we are never yielding ourselves to the plots and plans of the enemy vision chapter 4 in verse 27 tells us that we're not to give the devil place we're not to give him any space you know what that means it means a foothold a place to you know if you're climbing a mountain you're looking for a place to get a handhold or you're looking for a place to get a foothold and if you don't find that place you're not gonna climb any higher the enemy in the same manner is looking to get a foothold to get a handhold or a position in your life he wants to work in your mind he wants to cause strife in your family he wants to cause confusion in your church but if you and I are watching for his schemes and devices we can stop him we can cut him off at the pass and we can refuse to give place or space to the enemy Ephesians 4:27 in the King James says it this way neither give place to the devil period not a whole lot of instruction on how not to do it but but a very plain instruction or commandment that we should not so we discover we will discover if we if we seek to if we pray to if we ask the Lord Lord helped me to recognize any way that Satan desires to get space we don't have to give the devil real estate in our thoughts we don't have to give him real estate in our churches we don't have to give up space in defeat to the enemy we've been called to occupy territory according to God's Word the Bible tells us as we identify ourselves with the children of Israel that our footsteps means possession we can claim the promises of God until we see them activated in in our lives but if we allow the enemy to get in turn our head and refuse to hear the Spirit of God who often tries to warn us I'm telling you this sweet holy ghost how precious he is to try to warn us to try to steer us in the right direction to try to expose the enemy to us and sometimes we're too busy we're too stubborn oh we're too hardheaded to listen to the leadership of the Holy Spirit when he tries to lead us away from a particular situation we've got to be sensitive we've got to ask the Lord how do I become sensitive you just have to ask the Lord again and again if necessary Lord I want to be sensitive to your voice help me to discern your voice and to be able to distinguish your voice from all other voices someone recently wrote the ministry because of this program on the gospel channel and their confession was I sometimes find it difficult to be able to discern the voice is this God leading me or is it the in me the best advice that I know to give you to know the difference is does it line up with the word this is the absolute truth of God's Word in written form this is the record of God's eternal Word in written form and we can use it and utilize the gift that it is in our lives if you're feeling leadership or direction or you're hearing something in your spirit man and you're not 100% sure approach the Bible in a prayerful way let me give you an example you might come to the word and you might pray Oh father direct my my work my thoughts direct my fingers my hands to find a place to find something in this beautiful love gift you've given me that would help me to be able to identify and to recognize if this leadership that I have is of you or if it is indeed of the enemy I have to believe that if this is what we have if this is what God has given us I have to believe your answer is found in this word if you have a question concerning how to walk with God and what is God and what is not God I have to believe that the Word of God in conjunction in cooperation with the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit inside of you I have to believe that's the greatest tool that anyone could ever hope for to be able to differentiate between the two voices and to distinguish what is the true leadership of God in my life for this season I think we find it hard to know the difference sometime because we get a little caught up in the circumstances and we just need to pause we just need to take a minute and come before the Lord and approach God's Word in a prayer I actually suggest that when you're gonna sit down and do your Bible reading you don't just open the Bible and start reading but I suggest that you pray in a very prayerful way you come meditating in your heart asking that the Lord would lead you and direct you to the scripture where he would have you to be I think it's a wonderful idea to follow a Bible reading program but I think we should be fluid enough we should be flexible enough that if we pray and the Lord directs us in another direction that we should hope that his leadership will bring us to an answer for a situation that we're facing at the moment Ephesians 4:27 in the amplified we were talking about handholds and footholds in space it says leave no such room our foothold for the devil in other words it says give no opportunity to him just shut him off at the pass when he comes with a lie just shut him up by confessing the truth over your family over your life over your circumstance what the enemy often does in a situation like this is he stirs us in the soul realm he stirs us in the emotions I want you to know your emotions are not your enemy God gives us emotion but all how the enemy will use our emotions to give us amnesia it seems like when our emotions get stirred in anger we forget everything that we've ever known about how to handle ourselves in a moment like that I'm going to pray that God will help this threefold strategy to come alive in your life that you won't find it as just a cheesy piece of advice but that you will see it for what it really is there's power in applying God's Word to your life individually we must cast down imaginations we must bring every thought into captivity submitting it to the obedience of Christ and we must then surrender in obedience to his word to his leadership to his divine direction I'm going to pray that God will use that strategy in your life and that he'll give you special grace to bring your emotions down when you need to hear God's voice speaking to you father I want to thank you again for this opportunity that you have given me today to teach from my heart to speak truth that you have quickened to me and made real to me in my life I am NOT someone who confesses to know it all there's so much more of you that I want to know and understand and walk in but I want to be faithful to release what you have given me to benefit to bless to strengthen others I pray right now for the grace of God to take ahold of people's lives as they approach a way of bringing down strongholds that the enemy has built over them I pray that you will take Ephesians 10 and 5 and you will quicken it to the believer right now to the heart of the believer that you would show them you might expand this truth to them Lord you might give them even greater understanding of what I have brought today in seed form but I ultimately desire Oh Lord Jesus that you let your people walk in a place of victory until we our lives and the way we overcome circumstances is a testimony of your faithfulness of your grace and of what you have provided for us that we might overcome thank you Lord that we are not in this alone thank you that you are with us by the power of the Holy Spirit and you plan to stick with us and see us through to the end I thank you for healing the sick I thank you for directing with leadership those who need answers in their life I thank you for sharpening those who have asked Lord I want to know is this your voice is this the voice of my enemy lord I pray that by the power of the Holy Spirit you would sharpen that gift that spiritual discerning that we would know and quickly recognize if this be of God or if this is a play on a trick of the enemy to take us off the path Lord grant that to the believer and Lord speak to someone who is not trusting you fully in salvation and may they come to a place of born-again reality I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah all thank you so much for being with us today thank you for allowing me to speak my heart I get a little passionate about this subject because I know we've got an adversary out there who's walking about roaming about seeking whom he may devour but I'm so thankful to God that the word gives us the strategy we need so that we would never ever have to be ignorant of the devil schemes and devices I just want to bless you in the name of the Lord my heart is just swelling with love for you and I commit to continue in prayer until you become the victory that Jesus wants you to be god bless you again send your prayer requests to us and don't forget to
