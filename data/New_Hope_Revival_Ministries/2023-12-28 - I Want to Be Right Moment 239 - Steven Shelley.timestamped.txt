[0:00] that sometime we just have to cry out to
[0:02] God I've been wrong and we don't gravel
[0:06] we don't gravel in our wrongness we
[0:09] don't have to get beat because we
[0:11] realize that we've been wrong we just
[0:13] cry out Lord I'm wrong and I want to be
[0:17] right and so when we're wrong and we
[0:19] want to be right sometime one of the
[0:22] ways that we can get out of that place
[0:24] get out of the rut get out of the grave
[0:27] get out of the spirit of death is to off
[0:30] for a praise to God one that exceeds the
[0:35] shoulders one that gets a little higher
[0:38] than the
[0:40] ears when someone says I've got a gun on
[0:43] you you better
[0:44] surrender I've got a feeling that you're
[0:47] going to do more than
[0:51] hips come on I got a feeling you're
[0:54] going to go as high as your agility will
[0:56] let you go you're going to fully
[0:59] surrender and sometimes that is all it
[1:02] takes is a full Surrender by saying yes
[1:06] I don't know how to undo the mess but I
[1:09] know how to praise you when I praise you
[1:12] it's not trying to vote for the preacher
[1:15] I'm not voting for the pastor by
[1:17] praising the Lord I'm not taking sides
[1:20] by praising the Lord I'm not going to
[1:22] use praise for a political move I'm
[1:25] going to praise him because he's worthy
[1:27] I'm going to praise him because he's one
[1:30] wonderful only we can hope only we can
[1:33] hope that as the word Goes Forth it
[1:36] catches us where we are and we respond
[1:39] to it from where we are and God lifts us
[1:42] High you can't respond to the word on a
[1:44] different level than the one you're
[1:45] walking on but if you will respond to
[1:48] the word on the level that you have the
[1:50] level where you are God knows how to
[1:52] lift you to a higher
[1:58] place
