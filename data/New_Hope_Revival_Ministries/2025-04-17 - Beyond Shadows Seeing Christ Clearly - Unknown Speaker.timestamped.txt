[0:00] It's about hearing what Jesus preached.
[0:03] Somebody said, "What did Jesus preach?"
[0:05] Uh, he preached to them that all things
[0:08] must be fulfilled which were written in
[0:09] the law of Moses and in the prophets and
[0:11] in the Psalms concerning him. All of it.
[0:15] How many of you know there was no New
[0:16] Testament yet?
[0:19] He was preaching from the scripture,
[0:21] from the law, from the law, from the
[0:23] five books of Moses, from the prophets,
[0:25] from the Psalms, the poetic book, and on
[0:27] and on and on. It's not about making
[0:29] anyone culturally Jewish. It's about
[0:32] getting a greater understanding of who
[0:34] the Messiah is and what his birth,
[0:37] ministry, and death, resurrection, what
[0:40] it has really meant to us and what it
[0:43] means to us that he fulfilled it all.
[0:47] But I'd like to
[0:49] know, what did the Passover mean? And
[0:54] how is it that Jesus fulfilled it? Well,
[0:58] I'm not going to spend the rest of my
[1:00] life studying Easter because I know that
[1:02] Jesus had nothing to do and never has
[1:04] had anything and never will have
[1:06] anything to do with Easter.
[1:09] So why would I spend my life embracing,
[1:12] studying, researching Easter? But when I
[1:15] find that there is something that points
[1:17] me and that I might possibly have the
[1:20] opportunity to understand more about the
[1:23] image by looking at the shadow,
[1:27] especially when the shadow is in the
[1:28] word. It takes an
[1:31] image to cast a shadow. It takes an
[1:35] image in the
[1:37] light to cast a shadow. So the shadow is
[1:41] similar to the image, but it's not
[1:44] something that would give you as full or
[1:47] as complete of a picture. It's only a
[1:50] silhouette or an outline. It's a shadow.
[1:54] Do you understand? But there has to be
[1:56] an image. And there has to be an image
[1:59] in the presence of light to be able to
[2:02] cast a shadow. That makes that verse
[2:05] live. For we have a shadow. We have
[2:10] something that has been cast by an image
[2:13] in the light of good things to come.
[2:17] Don't judge people in meat or drink or
[2:19] holy days or new moons. Don't do that.
[2:22] These are shadows of things to come. And
[2:26] when the real comes, when the real image
[2:29] comes instead of the shadow, you will
[2:31] understand more completely and perfectly
[2:34] the shadow. And then you will see how
[2:38] that God is perfect.
[2:40] I want to present to you again a God who
[2:42] is perfect in all of his ways. A God who
[2:45] never makes a mistake. A God who never
[2:48] changes his mind about anything
[2:50] concerning his word. But the reality is,
[2:53] who in this world would want to hang to
[2:56] the shadow when you can hang to the
[2:59] image that produced the shadow?
[3:02] It's Jesus Christ. the same
[3:07] yesterday, today, and forever. But if
[3:10] there's something that we could use,
[3:12] study, pray about that would help us to
[3:16] understand the image more, then what
[3:18] would that be? It would be what the
[3:20] scripture calls shadows,
[3:22] types, symbols. Once you understand what
[3:26] the feast are, you can understand how
[3:29] Jesus fulfilled them. It doesn't matter
[3:32] how many times we returned to animal
[3:34] sacrifice. It doesn't matter how many
[3:36] years animal offerings were in place.
[3:39] None of those animals could atone for
[3:42] the sins of mankind. They were only a
[3:45] symbol of an offering given to God so
[3:48] that God would appease be appeased is
[3:50] what many people uh seem to look at it.
[3:53] But it's really saying, I I I thank you
[3:55] that you've given me a way to separate
[3:57] myself from my own behavior, from my own
[4:00] actions. But the blood of an animal only
[4:04] covered the surface of the sin. It never
[4:07] addressed the issue and it never brought
[4:10] full redemption or atonement. How many
[4:12] of you glad that the blood that Jesus
[4:14] shed for us was God's blood created
[4:17] specifically for the purpose of
[4:18] redemption? And it didn't just cover
[4:21] sin. What did it do? It remitted it. It
[4:25] brought us to what? Justification. And
[4:28] justification is boiling it down. Just
[4:31] if I'd never sin. Brother Brandham said,
[4:33] "You never did it.
[4:36] You never did it in the first place. It
[4:40] has been totally annihilated from the
[4:43] mind of God.
[4:45] Not just covered,
[4:48] undone, dissolved.
[4:51] Praise God. It does not exist.
