[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope a lord
[0:56] I greet you today in the matchless name
[1:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[1:06] Savior and our Messiah I'm Pastor Steven
[1:09] Shelley of New Hope revival ministries
[1:12] and we're coming to you again today on
[1:15] behalf of the gospel Channel and we're
[1:18] just thrilled for the opportunity that
[1:21] the Lord has given us again today to
[1:25] teach from His Holy Word his word is
[1:28] life to us it is a living entity in our
[1:33] lives and we can have a fresh Living
[1:37] encounter with God's Word on a daily
[1:41] basis we must remember that when we
[1:43] approach the Word of God we approach it
[1:47] in the spirit we approach it prayerfully
[1:50] we we approach it with the desire and
[1:54] the hunger to understand because I
[1:57] believe that the answer to every
[2:00] question in life can be found in the
[2:02] Living Word of God and I don't know
[2:05] about you but I appreciate the
[2:07] opportunity that we have through
[2:09] Christian television to learn more about
[2:12] the things of God and to be equipped to
[2:16] fight the good fight of faith here in
[2:19] what I believe is the end time I want to
[2:22] thank you for your prayer request for
[2:25] having confidence in us and sharing your
[2:28] needs with us and we invite you to
[2:31] continue to contact the ministry and we
[2:34] will spread your petition before the
[2:36] Lord and I believe that God is moving
[2:39] I'm excited about testimonies that have
[2:42] come in that God is answering prayer and
[2:46] you know when you when you get a
[2:47] testimony when you see that God is
[2:50] hearing and moving by a spirit well it
[2:53] encourages you to pray with greater
[2:56] fervency and it anoints your faith faith
[2:59] is like a muscle the more we exercise
[3:02] our faith the stronger it gets
[3:04] and so continue to share with us your
[3:09] requests and we
[3:10] we'll continue to help you carry them to
[3:13] the throne of God and really prayer is a
[3:16] privilege it's a real blessing to be
[3:19] able to cast all of our cares on the
[3:21] Lord knowing that he cares for us well
[3:25] today we're going to teach again in our
[3:29] series on schemes and devices and if you
[3:33] have missed any of our programs in this
[3:37] series we want to invite you to visit
[3:39] the new hope revival ministries page on
[3:43] YouTube we have a channel and you can go
[3:47] there to YouTube and watch any of the
[3:50] episodes on the series schemes and
[3:54] devices as well as other programs that
[3:57] we have produced for the gospel channel
[3:59] there are some clips from our church
[4:02] home some singing and I know you'll be
[4:06] blessed and if you'd like to be notified
[4:08] when we add something to our youtube
[4:10] channel then if you'll just go to the
[4:12] top of that page and and click the
[4:14] subscribe button we're not going to
[4:17] solicit anything from you what that does
[4:21] is it puts you in YouTube's system to be
[4:25] notified when we add any kind of content
[4:28] to that channel and we've actually had
[4:31] some people who have contacted us and
[4:33] said what a blessing to be able to go
[4:35] back because we realize an hour is a
[4:38] long time and you may have
[4:40] responsibilities the phone may ring or
[4:43] the roasts may need to be checked on in
[4:45] the oven and you may miss some of the
[4:48] teaching and so we're just thankful that
[4:50] we have a way to share it with you at
[4:53] any time and and I don't know about you
[4:56] but I have a YouTube app on my phone and
[4:58] there are times when when I want to keep
[5:02] up with what's going on in ministries or
[5:05] I like music I like good gospel music
[5:08] and so I subscribe to several channels
[5:11] myself and when I get an update if I
[5:14] have a moment some time I go right to
[5:16] the YouTube app and I enjoy that and I
[5:20] enjoy sharing it with my family so we
[5:22] invite you to do that
[5:24] also visit our website at revival dot
[5:27] o-r-g I tell you there are a lot of
[5:30] things on the website that would be a
[5:32] blessing to you and materials that you
[5:36] can order that I know would enhance your
[5:38] spiritual journey and we're always
[5:41] working to expand we have some
[5:44] interesting projects that we're working
[5:46] on right now and I'm getting pretty
[5:48] excited to have the opportunity to share
[5:51] them with you in the near future when we
[5:54] ended our last time together in schemes
[5:58] and devices we were speaking a little
[6:01] bit about the helmet of salvation and so
[6:05] I want to take you if you if you'll
[6:07] allow me to do Ephesians chapter 6 again
[6:11] and I'd like to read verses 10 through
[6:15] 18 and I was going to read it in the
[6:19] King James Version but I I think that
[6:22] you're very familiar with the way it
[6:25] reads the words and the way it sounds in
[6:28] the King James so let me read it again
[6:30] if you will in the in the amplified
[6:33] version of the Bible I believe that it
[6:36] will enhance our study today Ephesians
[6:40] chapter 6 and verse 10 in conclusion be
[6:45] strong in the Lord be empowered through
[6:50] your union with him draw your strength
[6:54] from him the strength or that strength
[6:59] which his boundless might provides verse
[7:05] 11 put on God's whole armor the armor of
[7:10] a heavy armed soldier which God supplies
[7:15] that's an important key when
[7:18] understanding the armor of the Lord it
[7:21] is weaponry that God provides for us
[7:27] what we have to do is actively utilize
[7:31] what God provides that you may be able
[7:36] Cecily to stand up against all the
[7:40] strategies and the deceits of the devil
[7:44] isn't that what we've been studying for
[7:47] weeks now strategies devices deceits of
[7:52] the devil he's busy our enemy is busy
[7:58] but I want you to know he is limited in
[8:01] his ability to dissuade you to distract
[8:05] you to pull you off your course if we
[8:09] make up our minds to give him less
[8:11] attention to listen less to the lies
[8:15] that he is always whispering to us in
[8:18] the realm of our mind and come
[8:22] continuously continually into agreement
[8:27] with God's Word
[8:28] tell you the enemy becomes more and more
[8:31] limited in his ability to attack you at
[8:35] any place in your life we're putting on
[8:40] that whole armor of God that we may be
[8:42] able successfully to stand up against
[8:46] all the strategies and the deceits of
[8:49] the devil for we are not wrestling with
[8:52] flesh and blood contending only with
[8:55] physical opponents but against the
[8:59] despotisms against the powers against
[9:02] the master spirits who are the world
[9:05] rulers of this present darkness against
[9:08] the spirit forces of wickedness in the
[9:11] heavenly supernatural sphere therefore
[9:16] put on God's complete armor that you may
[9:20] be able to resist and stand your ground
[9:24] on the evil day of danger and having
[9:28] done all the crisis demands to stand
[9:32] firmly in your place and that's why it's
[9:37] important for us to know where we're
[9:39] standing we want to know that when the
[9:42] enemy comes to us he will find nothing
[9:46] in us that agrees with him and then he
[9:51] has no room to work in our lives stand
[9:55] there for hold your ground when you know
[9:59] you're standing on the Rock of Ages when
[10:03] you're standing on the truth of God's
[10:06] Word you know that your position is in
[10:09] Christ it releases to you an authority
[10:14] that is bigger than either one of us can
[10:18] even begin to comprehend I am persuaded
[10:21] that after all these years of studying
[10:25] God's Word I entered into the ministry
[10:29] as a young boy in 1975 I've been
[10:34] following the Lord a long time and yet I
[10:37] realize more and more each day that I am
[10:41] living way below my means as a
[10:45] blood-bought sanctified by the washing
[10:50] of the water of the word and filled with
[10:52] the Holy Ghost believer we have
[10:55] everything we need to stop the enemy in
[10:59] his tracks you know it seems like
[11:03] sometimes when the enemy attacks we
[11:05] scramble and we talk about it more than
[11:09] we do something about it I'm under such
[11:12] heavy oppression I'm under such great
[11:15] attack we are indeed we are but I
[11:19] believe that we have been given power
[11:22] over all the powers of the enemy but
[11:26] again we better know where we're
[11:29] standing if there is any unconfessed sin
[11:33] in your life you may absolutely be
[11:38] weakening your ability to use the
[11:41] weapons that God has provided against
[11:44] your enemy you don't want there to be
[11:47] anything between you and the Lord when
[11:50] you're putting on his armor the armor
[11:53] that he has provided we use this
[11:57] expression sometime
[11:59] it's an old expression from the south
[12:01] from the southern part of the United
[12:03] States you don't want there to be any
[12:06] dead cats on the line you don't want
[12:09] there to be anything between you and the
[12:12] one you're calling on when you call on
[12:15] the name of the Lord you want to know
[12:17] that you have repented of all of your
[12:19] sin you have dealt with all measures of
[12:23] unbelief and you are taking him at his
[12:26] word I have full confidence that God
[12:32] wants to give us the victory because he
[12:36] is indeed the victory he is the victory
[12:40] stam therefore verse 14 hold your ground
[12:45] having tightened the belt of truth
[12:47] around your loins and having put on the
[12:51] breastplate of integrity and of moral
[12:56] rectitude and right standing with God we
[13:00] taught about that the last time we were
[13:02] together and having shod your feet in
[13:07] preparation to face the enemy with the
[13:11] firm footed stability the promptness and
[13:15] the readiness produced by the good news
[13:18] of the gospel of peace lift up over all
[13:24] the covering shield of saving faith upon
[13:30] which you can quench all the flaming
[13:34] missiles of the wicked one I tell you I
[13:38] like the way that is worded and take the
[13:42] helmet of salvation and the sword the
[13:48] spirit wheels which is the Word of God
[13:52] pray at all times on every occasion in
[13:56] every season in the spirit with all
[14:01] manner of Prayer and entreaty to the end
[14:06] keep alert and watch with strong
[14:11] purpose and perseverance interceding in
[14:15] behalf of all the saints God's
[14:20] consecrated people I tell you if that
[14:23] doesn't encourage you I don't know what
[14:27] will he is covering every part of our
[14:31] physical body which we know that on the
[14:35] inside of this physical body is the real
[14:38] man it's the real woman it's the Spirit
[14:42] being that God has created us to be in
[14:45] the beginning but the enemy in order to
[14:48] be able to get to your spirit he wants
[14:51] to attack the body or he wants to attack
[14:55] us in the realm of the soul the mind the
[14:59] will and the emotions that's why it's so
[15:02] important that of course we want to use
[15:06] the shield of faith quenching the fiery
[15:10] darts of the enemy we want to use the
[15:13] sword which is the word of God and we
[15:15] want to pick it up by the Spirit of God
[15:18] to defeat to cut down all of the of the
[15:23] arrows of the attacks of the enemy but
[15:27] it's also very important that we protect
[15:30] the vulnerable part the the control
[15:34] tower of the physical body which is the
[15:37] brain the mind is a part of the soulish
[15:41] realm and so we often because our brain
[15:44] has the capacity to think we often place
[15:48] the mind in conjunction with the brain
[15:51] and so when we put on the helmet of
[15:55] salvation we are protecting something
[16:00] very very important we are protecting
[16:05] the area of thought the area of our mind
[16:10] we as Christian believers have exchanged
[16:15] our minds for the mind of Christ we are
[16:19] putting on the mind of Christ we are
[16:24] taking authority over every stronghold
[16:27] and we are pulling down every
[16:31] imagination every thought that exalts
[16:35] itself against relationship with Jesus
[16:39] Christ and in order to continue in this
[16:43] process we've got to make sure that we
[16:46] have some protection for our thought
[16:49] life and that's where the helmet of
[16:53] salvation comes in it comes in handy we
[16:56] could say it protects the head it
[17:00] protects the mind the thoughts notice
[17:04] Paul says take it take it put it on he
[17:08] doesn't say it comes to us automatically
[17:11] when we wake up every morning that
[17:14] helmet of salvation is automatically
[17:16] placed on our heads he said take it put
[17:20] it on which means you and I have
[17:23] something to do we have to remain
[17:26] vigilant and watchful and on guard with
[17:31] our thought life we have to make sure
[17:34] that we are protecting all of our
[17:36] thoughts with the hope of salvation now
[17:41] I want you to hear that because the
[17:43] Bible tells us in first Thessalonians
[17:46] chapter 5 and verse 8 but let us who are
[17:51] of the day be sober putting on the
[17:56] breastplate of faith and love for an
[18:03] helmet the hope of salvation and so we
[18:08] have in one passage of Scripture put on
[18:12] the helmet of salvation in first
[18:17] Thessalonians we hear the Apostle saying
[18:20] our helmet is the hope of salvation
[18:26] the hope of deliverance now here's
[18:30] something interesting to notice faith
[18:33] brings protection
[18:35] to the heart faith brings protection to
[18:41] the heart how do we know that because
[18:43] Romans 10:10 says for with the heart man
[18:49] believeth you see our faith is in the
[18:53] dimension of believing we are believing
[18:57] it's faith in action when we believe for
[19:02] with the heart man believeth
[19:05] so he's exercising faith from the heart
[19:09] unto righteousness he is believing unto
[19:13] righteousness and then with the mouth
[19:17] confession is made unto salvation in
[19:22] other words what we confess as salvation
[19:26] must originate in the realm of the heart
[19:30] and in the realm of the heart or we
[19:33] could say the mind because biblically
[19:37] the heart is the seat of all emotions
[19:40] and the mind in the realm of the mind is
[19:44] where all of our emotions begin to
[19:47] spring forth from so this scripture says
[19:50] for with the heart man believeth unto
[19:52] righteousness and with the mouth
[19:54] confession is made unto salvation I want
[19:58] you to know your confession it's just as
[20:01] important as what you say you believe if
[20:05] there's any kind of crossing up of what
[20:09] we say with what we believe if we
[20:12] believe one thing and speak another it
[20:15] causes a disconnection and so the only
[20:18] way for our confession to accomplish
[20:21] what the Word of God says it will is to
[20:25] make sure there's nothing crossing up
[20:27] the connection between our heart and
[20:31] what comes out of our mouth it's very
[20:34] interesting to note that faith is a very
[20:37] important part of protecting the heart
[20:41] protecting the emotions protecting the
[20:44] realm of the mind but hope if if
[20:49] viii is what protects the heart hope is
[20:52] what brings protection to the mind and
[20:55] this means we can protect ourselves with
[21:00] hope and not just hope of of a sunny day
[21:04] tomorrow but hope of salvation the hope
[21:10] of salvation you see there's a there's a
[21:12] difference between faith and hope faith
[21:15] operates from the realm of the heart
[21:18] faith protects the heart but Hope brings
[21:22] protection to the mind against certain
[21:26] attacks of the enemy
[21:28] for instance discouragement and
[21:30] depression in Romans chapter 8 verse 28
[21:35] it says and we know that all things this
[21:40] is a very important verse of scripture
[21:43] because I'm telling you the enemy really
[21:46] likes to discourage us and to depress us
[21:49] with adverse circumstances but if we can
[21:53] reach for this verse of scripture every
[21:56] time with the hope of salvation knowing
[22:01] that God's Word cannot lie we know that
[22:04] all things work together for good to
[22:07] them that love God to them who are the
[22:12] called according to his purpose
[22:15] now notice Paul doesn't say all things
[22:18] that happen to believers are good
[22:20] because there are some bad things that
[22:22] happened to good people but we know that
[22:25] all things work together for the good
[22:29] that means God is watching out for you
[22:33] and I and we need to remember that all
[22:35] the time by putting on the helmet of
[22:39] salvation in hope we are cultivating a
[22:43] positive attitude we are working toward
[22:47] keeping a positive attitude and you say
[22:51] well now where is that what is how is
[22:54] that connected to the spiritual well I
[22:57] want you to know it's very connected
[22:59] because you're added to
[23:01] it affects the realm of the soul and the
[23:04] realm of the soul can easily affect the
[23:07] realm of the spirit now what we want to
[23:10] do is build ourselves up from the spirit
[23:13] man so that the spirit of truth that
[23:17] lives in our spirit can influence our
[23:20] mind our will and our emotions but if
[23:24] we're not building up the spirit man
[23:27] the soul will then take precedence over
[23:31] the spirit in other words we will live
[23:34] our lives led by the mind by the will by
[23:38] the emotions now emotions are very
[23:41] important part of who we are but we
[23:43] don't want to live emotionally we want
[23:46] to live spiritually we don't want to
[23:49] make decisions based on emotion we want
[23:52] to make decisions based on the spirit of
[23:54] truth that lives in our spirit by the
[23:58] beautiful work of redemption
[24:02] transformation conversion it's true that
[24:06] if we keep putting on the helmet of
[24:08] salvation in hope if we keep putting
[24:11] that on if we keep actively taking the
[24:15] helmet of salvation in hope it protects
[24:19] us from from our mind going to those
[24:22] places of discouragement and depression
[24:25] it also helps to cultivate a positive
[24:28] attitude in our life as we said a moment
[24:31] ago and it is a proven fact that when
[24:34] you think differently you live
[24:36] differently this is a proven fact the
[24:40] Bible even tells us as a man thinketh in
[24:43] his heart so he is and so God has a
[24:48] remedy you know he not only has a remedy
[24:50] for you and I to be able to fight the
[24:53] enemy when he attacks but he also has
[24:56] some solutions in the Word of God to cut
[24:59] the enemy off at the pass and that's
[25:01] what I'd like to see the overcoming
[25:03] believers began to do in this hour is
[25:07] instead of always you know fighting the
[25:10] enemy after his big
[25:12] against us I think we need to begin to
[25:15] recognize who we are through Jesus
[25:18] Christ and stop him before he's even
[25:21] able to put his hand on our body before
[25:24] he's even able to touch our family all
[25:28] wait a minute preacher you know that
[25:30] back that's that's a little little
[25:32] stretching you know you're stretching it
[25:34] a little bit not according to God's Word
[25:37] change begins in the realm of the
[25:41] thought it begins in the realm of the
[25:44] mind how important it is to keep coming
[25:48] back to the helmet of salvation in hope
[25:51] knowing that the Lord Jesus Yeshua which
[25:55] means salvation by the way that he is
[25:59] going to see us through the scripture
[26:03] tells us that the unrenewed mind the
[26:07] mind of carnality is the enemy of God
[26:12] remember the scripture says for to be
[26:15] carnally minded is death but to be
[26:19] spiritually minded is life well another
[26:22] way of saying that is that the carnal or
[26:25] the unrenewed mind is actually the enemy
[26:29] of God it is at enmity with God it's
[26:34] crossed up with God so it's very
[26:37] important when we're fighting the enemy
[26:40] when we're exposing his schemes and
[26:43] devices in our life that we keep putting
[26:46] on the helmet of salvation in hope that
[26:50] we keep coming back to the truth of
[26:53] God's Word shutting down every lie of
[26:56] the enemy you see walking in the hope of
[26:59] salvation is conditional as long as we
[27:03] choose to face life circumstances
[27:05] putting on the helmet of the hope of
[27:08] salvation we can remain strong no matter
[27:11] what our circumstances are but as soon
[27:14] as we allow our thought life to follow
[27:17] our circumstances instead of calling in
[27:21] authority our circumstances to follow
[27:24] our thought
[27:26] which is supposed to be the mind of
[27:29] Christ the Word of God so it works
[27:33] either way you're either going to be led
[27:36] by circumstances and emotions or you're
[27:39] going to be able to manipulate your
[27:42] circumstances by having the right
[27:45] thought process and I'm telling you the
[27:47] right thought process is not found in
[27:50] the New Age it's not found in some kind
[27:52] of yoga or Eastern mysticism the the
[27:56] right thought process is found in taking
[28:00] on the mind of Christ
[28:02] how would he think of this situation
[28:05] what would he have me to do and how do
[28:08] we discover the mind of God the Word of
[28:12] God in its printed form when when we
[28:16] read it in the spirit God is able to use
[28:20] this word to reveal to us what the mind
[28:25] of God is concerning any circumstance of
[28:29] our life any situation that we're faced
[28:32] with there's an answer I believe for of
[28:35] that situation
[28:36] a strategy for that circumstance that
[28:40] can be revealed to us by the Word of God
[28:44] I'm so thankful I am so thankful that we
[28:48] have the Word of God Romans chapter 14
[28:52] and verse eight says for whether we live
[28:55] we live unto the Lord and whether we die
[29:00] we die unto the Lord whether we live
[29:04] therefore or die we are the Lord's this
[29:09] is a promise that we have if we know
[29:13] that we are the Lord's
[29:15] we're his in death and we're his in life
[29:20] and I happen to believe that it would be
[29:25] the delight of the enemy to cut your
[29:27] life short but I also believe that the
[29:31] will of God for your life is stronger
[29:35] than the ability of the enemy to try to
[29:37] cut your life
[29:39] I believe that when we walk in Union and
[29:43] agreement with God's destiny purposes
[29:46] for our life the enemy can distract us
[29:49] but he cannot destroy us he can get our
[29:53] minds off of the goal with distraction
[29:56] he can dissuade us he can even bring us
[30:00] to a place where we yield a little and
[30:02] stumble but he cannot destroy what God
[30:06] has deposited in us his spirit life and
[30:10] that spirit life will lead us back to
[30:14] the word and remind us that we have in
[30:18] fact authority over every work of the
[30:22] enemy you put on the helmet which is the
[30:26] hope of salvation every time you act
[30:29] upon the knowledge that God is
[30:33] orchestrating events in your life when
[30:37] you are able even in the darkest moment
[30:40] of of a situation when you are able to
[30:43] say wait a minute God hasn't left me I
[30:46] feel like I'm in a prison I feel like
[30:49] that I am in a pit I feel like there is
[30:53] no way out for me but I know that I know
[30:57] that I know that I know that God has not
[31:00] forsaken me when you say that when you
[31:05] believe that and you say that confess
[31:10] that you are absolutely putting on your
[31:15] putting on the helmet of salvation in
[31:18] hope you're not living in denial you're
[31:21] not living in denial that you've got
[31:23] problems that that things going on
[31:26] around you aren't pretty and they're not
[31:28] pleasant but what you're doing is
[31:31] choosing rather to glorify God even in
[31:35] your adverse circumstances Paul and
[31:40] Silas beaten nearly to death in the
[31:42] Roman Jail if anybody had a reason to
[31:45] complain and throw up their hands and
[31:48] give up Paul and Silas
[31:51] but rather they chose at the midnight
[31:53] hour to grab the helmet of salvation in
[31:57] hope and put it down tighten it down on
[32:01] their mind and on their thoughts and the
[32:04] Bible said that at the midnight hour
[32:06] they sang praises to God they glorified
[32:12] the god of salvation and what did he do
[32:16] he set them free he made a way where
[32:20] there was no way blessed be his holy
[32:24] name so it's important to keep
[32:27] confessing and to keep believing that
[32:31] God is in control even when it looks
[32:35] like no one is in control even when it
[32:38] looks like the enemy is in control God
[32:41] is in control it's hard to be negative
[32:46] it's hard to be down in the money Grubbs
[32:49] in the throes of despair when you're
[32:53] reminding yourself God is in control God
[32:56] has never lost a battle he's a god of
[32:59] the battle he has never lost one battle
[33:04] he sits on top of the flood he sits
[33:09] above it all high and lifted up when you
[33:14] keep reminding yourself that God has
[33:18] never been caught off guard he has never
[33:22] been taken by surprise he sees all he
[33:26] knows all and he is in charge and
[33:29] control of our lives if we yield
[33:33] ourselves to him that he can work in us
[33:36] and for us and through us for our good
[33:42] even in bad circumstances good can come
[33:47] out of them when God is sitting in
[33:51] charge when he is on the throne when we
[33:53] instead of taking control of our lives
[33:56] back from God we want to keep
[33:59] surrendering our life to Him sometimes
[34:02] when when the
[34:03] when it looks like the train is gonna
[34:05] wreck we want to take the wheels don't
[34:07] you dare don't you dare take control
[34:11] take charge of your life when things are
[34:14] looking bleak or gloom that is the
[34:18] moment to take your hands off of the
[34:20] wheel yes and let God Drive let him
[34:25] listen it's too late in the hour to be
[34:28] the co-pilot we've got to let God be the
[34:31] pilot and why don't you just throw your
[34:33] leg over and get in the backseat and
[34:35] leave the driving to him and keep
[34:39] confessing with your mouth lord I know
[34:42] that you're going to see me through I
[34:45] can't even figure out how this could
[34:48] ever be good I can't even imagine how
[34:52] this thing could turn around but I know
[34:54] who you are and I know the power that
[34:56] you have and I'm putting on the helmet
[35:00] of salvation in hope I am raising up the
[35:05] shield of faith to quench the fiery
[35:07] darts of the enemy I am preparing my
[35:10] feet with the peace of the gospel of
[35:14] Jesus Christ I'm raising the sword of
[35:18] the Spirit which is the word of God and
[35:22] I'm gonna stand when I get dressed up in
[35:26] this whole armor of God I'm just going
[35:29] to stand in Genesis chapter 50 we read
[35:34] that in the presence of his brothers the
[35:38] same brothers who sold him into slavery
[35:43] Joseph looked them in the eye and said
[35:48] you intended to harm me you meant this
[35:53] for evil for my destruction but God
[35:58] intended it for my good and that's in
[36:03] verse 20 of Genesis 50 you you meant to
[36:08] destroy me you sold me into slavery
[36:13] after having already desert
[36:16] did me in a pit to die you were out to
[36:21] destroy me but God allowed those
[36:25] circumstances because he was going to
[36:30] promote me why don't you serve notice on
[36:34] the enemy today what you have meant
[36:38] devil to take me out God is going to
[36:42] turn it around for my good and instead
[36:46] of being taken out I'm going to be taken
[36:50] over I'm going to overcome these
[36:54] circumstances by keeping my hope my
[36:58] faith my trust anchored in the Lord
[37:01] Jesus Christ you might say preacher you
[37:05] almost sound like you believe what
[37:07] you're saying I believe it with every
[37:10] fiber of my being every cell of who I am
[37:15] says that God is more than able well
[37:19] brother Shelly are you always that
[37:22] positive no sometimes just like you I
[37:27] get distracted by the howling of the
[37:30] enemy by the closing in of the
[37:34] circumstances but I'll tell you what I'm
[37:36] learning as I'm at or in the Lord is
[37:39] that that amount of time that that time
[37:43] of being in the mope that time of being
[37:46] in the you know the valley of
[37:48] discouragement is getting shorter and
[37:51] shorter and shorter in my life I want to
[37:55] give God praise for that it's him and
[37:57] usually it comes as a nudge from him
[38:01] have you ever had the Lord nudge you you
[38:04] ever had the Spirit of the Lord just
[38:06] kind of poke you in the spirit man and
[38:08] you recognized wait a minute I've been
[38:12] sitting here allowing my thoughts to go
[38:14] down the bunny trail of defeat and I
[38:17] don't have to do that because my hope is
[38:19] not in my circumstances my hope is in
[38:23] the Rock of Ages my hope is in the Lord
[38:25] God who is above all
[38:28] the other gods that have been worshipped
[38:30] that have been praised did me see the
[38:32] children of Israel through and you know
[38:35] there were times that they were fighting
[38:36] against him it appeared instead of
[38:39] fighting for them but he led them right
[38:41] through the wilderness
[38:43] anyway providing for their need and gave
[38:46] them the inheritance that he had
[38:48] promised here is Joseph looking at it
[38:52] with the right attitude he's putting on
[38:55] the helmet of salvation and hope and
[38:59] saying wait a minute I can now look back
[39:01] and see that what you meant why should I
[39:04] hold this against you see why should I
[39:07] die a bitter death blaming you for what
[39:12] really became a part of God's promotion
[39:15] for me it didn't feel good at the moment
[39:19] it wasn't good it wasn't good at the
[39:21] moment it was not good to be left to die
[39:23] in a pit it was not good to be drugged
[39:26] up by a rope and sold to a caravan as a
[39:30] slave it wasn't good to end up in
[39:33] Potiphar's prison forgotten either but
[39:36] it was good when God allowed Joseph to
[39:41] be remembered to be brought up out of
[39:44] that prison and once again promoted to
[39:48] the second in control in charge in
[39:51] authority under Pharaoh himself
[39:54] this was the grace of God and remember
[39:58] this had God not positioned Joseph down
[40:02] in Egypt then what in the world would
[40:05] have happened to the children of his
[40:07] father and what would have happened to
[40:10] the nation of Israel because famine was
[40:13] going to strike the land and God was
[40:16] positioning Joseph to a place where he
[40:19] could feed the very ones who would
[40:22] inherit the promised God was taking care
[40:26] of Joseph's family through Joseph and
[40:30] through getting him down into Egypt
[40:33] although the circumstances of him
[40:36] getting there
[40:37] they were Pleasant it wasn't a vacation
[40:41] it wasn't that he stumbled down into
[40:43] Egypt you know enjoying every step of
[40:47] the way
[40:48] no he went there as a slave but praise
[40:51] be to God he left there as the king he
[40:56] left there with authority and he was
[40:59] able to preserve the promise of God
[41:03] given to Abraham Joseph refused to allow
[41:09] bitterness and depression to take root
[41:13] in his life because he knew that if he
[41:16] did he would miss out on God's highest
[41:21] destiny for him
[41:23] maybe you're satisfied to settle for for
[41:28] a second best destiny I'll just live in
[41:33] the permissive will of God but I want
[41:36] you to know I've learned enough about
[41:38] the Lord and about his word and what he
[41:41] can do to promote someone I don't want
[41:44] to live a half a day in anything less
[41:48] than his highest destiny purpose in my
[41:53] life now let me speak to you just a
[41:55] moment on a personal level I'm 50 years
[41:58] old and I realized that if Jesus Terri's
[42:02] the biggest portion of what I can do for
[42:05] him in the natural it seems if you think
[42:09] in the natural is behind me instead of
[42:12] in front of me there are times that the
[42:15] enemy uses that mortality I'm not afraid
[42:18] of death I'm not afraid to lay down and
[42:21] go home to be with the Lord that's not
[42:24] it at all if I had a fear if I had a
[42:27] concern it is I want to make sure that I
[42:32] do everything that God has birthed me
[42:37] brought me to this planet to do for his
[42:40] kingdom sake I've wasted time even in my
[42:44] life of ministry I've spun my wheels
[42:47] I've lived in the permissive will of God
[42:50] do you know what
[42:52] keeps me from falling into a deep place
[42:55] of depression and and realizing that if
[42:58] I'm gonna do anything I better do it now
[43:00] and you know how you can get I'm not the
[43:02] only person there are some people
[43:05] probably watching me today that that
[43:07] you're you're beyond 50 and you're
[43:11] thinking how will I ever have anything
[43:13] to do yet for God and how will I ever be
[43:16] able to accomplish it well I'll tell you
[43:18] what pulls me up out of that place when
[43:21] I feel the enemy trying to take me to a
[43:23] dark place in my thoughts it's knowing
[43:26] what God can do if you understand God's
[43:30] ability to accelerate and multiply if
[43:33] you understand God's ability to get
[43:37] things done in short order
[43:39] I'm telling you which God begins to pour
[43:43] acceleration into a specific purpose
[43:46] that he has in your life he can move you
[43:49] so quickly from one place to the next
[43:51] and he can accomplish all much more than
[43:56] your heart has ever imagined or dreamed
[43:58] that's the God we serve in a short
[44:03] amount of time he can take you from the
[44:05] pit to the prison to the palace in a
[44:08] short amount of time he can take you
[44:11] from the Roman jail and launch you out
[44:14] into a ministry like the Apostle Paul he
[44:18] whipped from from being the greatest
[44:21] enemy of the people of God the church
[44:23] the church love the baby church he was
[44:27] the greatest enemy she had and all of a
[44:29] sudden he began became the biggest
[44:32] proponent he became the biggest
[44:34] ambassador and God took him from a life
[44:37] of of really resentment and hatred
[44:40] because he was really dealing with some
[44:43] some religious stuff and launched him
[44:46] into a ministry and even even the
[44:51] Ministry of Jesus
[44:52] think about how it was so short from the
[44:57] time that he really stepped into the
[44:59] maturity of his office until his death
[45:03] three and a half years what a short
[45:07] amount of time and never before has the
[45:10] world ever been shaken like it was
[45:13] shaken by that span that short span of
[45:17] time somebody said yes but that was
[45:19] Jesus well I don't know if you realize
[45:22] it or not but he's living in me he wants
[45:26] to accomplish much in my life and
[45:29] through my life and the same to you if
[45:32] he can do all that he did in that short
[45:35] period of time he can pour the oil of
[45:38] acceleration over you right now and
[45:40] launch you so quickly into another level
[45:45] or another dimension of his destiny
[45:48] purpose for your life so don't get in
[45:51] those Molly grubs and stay there it's
[45:55] likely that you're gonna face those
[45:56] moments of discouragement it's likely
[45:59] that you're gonna have those feelings
[46:01] from time to time it's gonna look a
[46:04] little hopeless to you that's when you
[46:06] need to pull out the helmet of salvation
[46:08] and hope and pull it right down over
[46:11] your ears if you have to refuse to be
[46:15] defeated by an enemy refuse to listen to
[46:19] his lie and know that even if there's a
[46:22] lot of wasted time in your life that God
[46:25] knows how to do great and mighty things
[46:28] in your future if you just yield
[46:31] yourself to him Joseph was making a
[46:34] decision in Genesis 50 I'm gonna stop
[46:38] looking at things from my perspective
[46:40] and I'm gonna start looking at things
[46:42] from God's perspective all what a shift
[46:46] my what a change that can produce when
[46:51] we make up our mind to start looking at
[46:54] things as God looks at things it's as
[46:58] though Joseph was seeing his life
[47:00] through the hope of salvation he must
[47:03] have put the helmet on now in the New
[47:06] Testament there is I I think it's it's a
[47:10] great tragedy it's always really sort of
[47:14] hurt my feelings there was
[47:17] young man a gifted young man a man whose
[47:21] God's hand were certainly on and he
[47:25] really had some troubles
[47:28] his name was Dimas and the Apostle
[47:33] speaks about him in 2nd Timothy chapter
[47:36] 4 verse 10 and when I was preaching
[47:41] youth meetings for so many years around
[47:45] the world I have preached hundreds of
[47:48] sermons on this verse for demas hath
[47:52] forsaken me having loved this present
[47:55] world I don't know about you but that
[47:58] gets me that really touches me right
[48:02] down here you know I would I would say
[48:05] gut but I don't want to offend anybody
[48:07] way down in here it touches me deeply
[48:11] when I look at that word world present
[48:15] world it's the world that is in Greek a
[48:18] on it it's not it's not talking about
[48:22] the the actual earth it's talking rather
[48:27] about age a present age so the scripture
[48:33] could actually read for DeMuth demas
[48:36] hath forsaken me having loved this
[48:38] present age he fell in love with the
[48:42] spirit of his age o my children of God
[48:47] we can afford to fall in love with the
[48:50] spirit of this evil age that we're
[48:53] living in right now it doesn't say that
[48:56] Dimas got drunk it doesn't say that he
[49:00] stole money it doesn't say that he had
[49:03] an immoral affair it simply says he left
[49:07] this Destiny's purpose to follow the
[49:13] spirit of his present age he immersed
[49:17] himself in the spirit of his age he
[49:21] could no longer walk with Paul because
[49:23] Paul was now walking in the highest
[49:26] order of his destiny purpose in this
[49:29] spirit the Apostle Paul was walking
[49:32] according to God's will for his life
[49:36] here's a young man who was being
[49:40] mentored by the greatest missionary in
[49:42] the history of the church
[49:44] Dimas right alongside of Paul saw a
[49:49] great harvest of souls he must have seen
[49:53] many healings deliverances lives
[49:57] transformed but Dimas was so enamored so
[50:03] captured with the spirit of his age the
[50:07] age that he was living in that he could
[50:10] not go forward he was paralyzed to move
[50:16] forward he couldn't go forward
[50:19] he couldn't push himself further into
[50:22] what God had for his life and so the
[50:27] truth is Dimas sacrificed his fullest
[50:32] destiny purpose to embrace the spirit of
[50:36] his present age I see many in the church
[50:42] embracing the spirit of this age more
[50:48] than reaching forward to embrace Jesus
[50:52] Christ the church wants to be relevant I
[50:57] want you to know there's nothing more
[51:00] relevant than the truth the truth is
[51:04] what makes us relevant it's not our
[51:07] method it's not by compromising with the
[51:11] spirit of the age that we become
[51:14] relevant it's not by borrowing the
[51:18] things of the world that we become
[51:21] relevant I want you to know it's a thin
[51:24] line I believe the Apostle said I became
[51:28] all things to all men that I might win
[51:31] them I believe it's a thin line that the
[51:34] church must walk in this hour I believe
[51:38] that there is certainly room
[51:41] update many of our methods I believe
[51:44] that but we can never compromise our
[51:48] truth by adopting methods that are of
[51:54] the spirit of this present age it's not
[51:59] another rock concert that's going to
[52:02] deliver this generation it's it's an
[52:05] atmosphere that cannot be created by
[52:09] agreeing with the spirit of this present
[52:12] age this atmosphere for transformation
[52:16] can only be created when we stand on the
[52:21] truth of God's Word we gird ourselves
[52:25] with the armor that God has provided for
[52:30] us and we allow his love to love through
[52:36] us without compromise the church has
[52:40] accepted tolerance as her method and she
[52:46] calls it love I want you to know there's
[52:49] a difference between what we tolerate
[52:51] and what we love we must be careful to
[52:56] love the person to love the sinner while
[53:01] standing firmly against the sin it is
[53:07] the spirit of Laodicea that last church
[53:11] age that we read about in the book of
[53:13] the revelation that lukewarm Church that
[53:17] church that was rich increased with
[53:20] Goods and had need of nothing she
[53:23] thought we've got it all where we're
[53:27] drawing the crowd everything looks good
[53:30] but I want you to know the Church of
[53:34] Laodicea had no idea just how blind how
[53:38] miserable how wretched how naked she
[53:42] really was she needed to be clothed with
[53:45] Christ she needed to be dressed in his
[53:49] righteousness she needed to bring her
[53:53] out of the spirit the control of this
[53:58] present age and fall in love with
[54:01] eternity I want you to know as children
[54:03] of God rather than loving the age we
[54:06] live in we need to love the Eternity we
[54:10] need to love the one who is eternal and
[54:13] we need to allow him to mold us and
[54:17] shape us in this hour I want to
[54:21] encourage you today put on the helmet of
[54:25] salvation get yourself some protection
[54:28] for your thought life put on the helmet
[54:32] of salvation in hope remind yourself of
[54:36] Joseph's situation and the choices that
[54:40] he made to believe that God is bigger
[54:45] than the past he's bigger than the
[54:48] circumstances that got me here I'm not
[54:51] going to be bitter I'm going to let the
[54:54] Spirit of the Lord make me better I'm
[54:57] not going to blame everyone around me
[54:59] for the time that I've wasted or the
[55:01] things that I've squandered but I'm
[55:04] gonna put my hope in him and I'm going
[55:07] to believe that he is able to redeem
[55:09] everything that is lost father I thank
[55:12] you today that you are indeed a redeemer
[55:15] hallelujah you are more than able to
[55:19] redeem and to take back what we have
[55:22] squandered and what we might have wasted
[55:25] along the way the years that we might
[55:28] have spent not fully connected to you or
[55:32] the destiny purposes that you had for
[55:35] our life we repent today Lord I repent
[55:38] before you with sincerity of heart for
[55:43] any days that I have wasted along my
[55:46] journey not pushing for the very best
[55:50] that you had for me but accepting what
[55:53] the enemy was trying to do to take me
[55:55] under and I ask you to forgive me Lord
[55:59] for every bit of that and to raise me up
[56:02] with acceleration let my hope be
[56:06] anointed
[56:06] today Lord this is the prayer I not only
[56:10] pray for myself but I pray for every
[56:12] person watching this program today who
[56:15] will put their faith in here with me
[56:18] Lord would you use us for your glory
[56:21] would you lay your hand on us Lord right
[56:25] where you are just put your hand up
[56:27] toward him would you use us today Lord
[56:30] would you see our surrender would you
[56:33] move in our lives Oh God would you speak
[56:36] clearly to us what you would have us to
[56:39] do and then give us the grace to say yes
[56:43] not only with our mouths but lord may we
[56:47] find grace to say yes with our lives and
[56:50] with our obedience we pray right now
[56:53] that every attack of the enemy would be
[56:56] exposed and forted against the children
[57:00] of the Living God I pray for a hunger to
[57:03] be stirred in hearts and lives right now
[57:07] for the word of God I pray for grace to
[57:11] approach your word in spirit and not
[57:15] only in letter I pray Lord for men and
[57:19] women of God for churches for ministries
[57:22] that are reaching out to the lost that
[57:25] they will not compromise the word for
[57:29] numbers but I pray that they will take
[57:33] you at your word that if we stand on the
[57:36] faith of the Apostles and we do it like
[57:39] it was done in the book of Acts that you
[57:43] will add to the church you will add to
[57:46] the ministry daily such as should be
[57:49] saved Lord then the responsibility is on
[57:52] you to draw them we'll tell them the
[57:55] good news we'll live the life in front
[57:57] of them but it's up to you Lord to
[58:00] change them for your glory we ask these
[58:03] things in the name
[58:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen
[58:09] our time is gone for today but I hope
[58:12] you'll tune in again next time god bless
[58:14] you we love you bye bye for now
