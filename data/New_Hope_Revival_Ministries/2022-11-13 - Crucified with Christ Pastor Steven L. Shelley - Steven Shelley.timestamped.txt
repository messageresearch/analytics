[58:38] mother was taken from the nursing
[58:41] facility to the emergency room on
[58:44] Wednesday
[58:45] and uh
[58:46] didn't get a room until about 11 o'clock
[58:49] Wednesday night but really she was she
[58:53] was not in the hallway in the emergency
[58:55] room she was in a in a bay
[58:58] and she was actually getting tests
[59:01] faster there than she would have if
[59:02] she'd been in a room so the Lord knows
[59:05] everything
[59:06] and she was extremely dehydrated and she
[59:10] had been pocketing food and not
[59:12] swallowing
[59:13] and uh
[59:15] show her sodium levels were very very
[59:18] high and her blood pressure very low and
[59:22] of course she was confused as always
[59:25] but when something is going on and you
[59:27] can't communicate you know properly I'm
[59:29] sure it's even more frustrating so I
[59:32] have spent all day Thursday all day
[59:34] Friday and all day yesterday in the
[59:36] hospital and she is not improving she is
[59:40] most likely getting ready to see the
[59:44] Lord most likely
[59:46] and that really really Thrills my heart
[59:49] it does
[59:51] yesterday day before yesterday she was
[59:54] asleep most of the day very very groggy
[59:57] so much so that we double checked to see
[1:00:00] if they had given her something to make
[1:00:02] her so sleepy she slept so sound and so
[1:00:06] loudly all day long for we couldn't even
[1:00:09] hardly wake her up for the kids when
[1:00:12] they came and uh but yesterday she was
[1:00:15] not so sleepy she was more alert and she
[1:00:18] spoke some words of English a lot of
[1:00:21] times since the stroke in 2019 it's just
[1:00:24] been kind of mumbling that you can't
[1:00:26] quite make out
[1:00:27] but yesterday she said some clear things
[1:00:30] at different times and one of those
[1:00:33] things was she said oh I am so ready to
[1:00:38] go
[1:00:40] and I said mother are you ready to go
[1:00:42] home she said No Heaven
[1:00:48] so clear so clear
[1:00:51] and that was a great comfort to my heart
[1:00:53] of course it was
[1:00:55] I've grieved my mother now since the
[1:00:58] first stroke and so it doesn't feel
[1:01:01] quite the same
[1:01:03] as if it had not been such a drawn out
[1:01:06] process but as sister shoshana sung this
[1:01:10] morning who who am I
[1:01:13] you know to question God's will and his
[1:01:15] way
[1:01:16] so uh we will see how things go but her
[1:01:19] blood pressure was
[1:01:21] uh 80 over 38.
[1:01:26] and has been lower than that
[1:01:29] and she was in some pain yesterday from
[1:01:33] probably laying in the bed unable to do
[1:01:36] a lot of moving around and they're not
[1:01:39] able at this moment in the hospital at
[1:01:41] least to give her much for pain because
[1:01:45] it lowers your blood pressure
[1:01:47] and so uh God willing we will transfer
[1:01:51] her to hospice care tomorrow where she
[1:01:54] will be uh comfortable they will be able
[1:01:57] to address those things but it means
[1:01:59] that she's transitioning and it means
[1:02:02] that her long battle with dementia
[1:02:05] Hallelujah
[1:02:07] it's almost done and uh her mind will be
[1:02:11] clear and will be sharp again and she
[1:02:14] will know as she is known and the truth
[1:02:18] is we're almost home anyway
[1:02:22] we're almost home anyway so thank you
[1:02:25] for your prayers your texts your calls
[1:02:29] um I've been a little slack in answering
[1:02:31] a non-related text and calls but uh
[1:02:35] forgive me it's just not easy to take a
[1:02:39] lot of calls in the hospital because if
[1:02:41] I talk she stirs
[1:02:43] and she's wondering who's talking and
[1:02:45] what are they saying you know she just
[1:02:47] gets very fidgety
[1:02:49] um but I've had some wonderful
[1:02:50] expressions of love and concern that
[1:02:53] have meant so much to me and I haven't
[1:02:56] slept and so I was pretty tired this
[1:03:00] morning coming in coming over and I was
[1:03:02] met with a beautiful basket thank you
[1:03:04] sister
[1:03:08] it'll be all right I'm
[1:03:09] right sister Rebecca and Maya had Maya
[1:03:13] had made a beautiful card and and a
[1:03:15] beautiful basket of goodies and uh
[1:03:18] wonderful things and it really it meant
[1:03:21] something to me you always appreciate
[1:03:23] somebody doing something nice
[1:03:25] but in a moment like that it was just a
[1:03:27] real
[1:03:28] my mother doesn't need flowers she
[1:03:31] wouldn't know they were there she
[1:03:33] doesn't need anything like that I've
[1:03:35] told anybody who asked please don't
[1:03:37] spend your money on that
[1:03:39] she didn't like cut flowers anyway so
[1:03:42] why would she want them now
[1:03:44] why do you why do they want to waste
[1:03:46] them and cut them off like that so they
[1:03:47] die
[1:03:49] she didn't have a green thumb either so
[1:03:52] anyway
[1:03:53] most of her flowers were artificial I
[1:03:56] even had a friend who reached out
[1:03:57] yesterday or Friday he reached out
[1:04:00] Friday and he said brother Shelley I
[1:04:01] will come I will pay my own ticket and I
[1:04:05] will come and sit with you you don't
[1:04:06] have to talk you won't have to answer
[1:04:09] any spiritual questions I'll just come
[1:04:11] and sit in the room with you and you
[1:04:12] know that meant so much to me that
[1:04:14] someone would think of something like
[1:04:16] that several of you have offered to come
[1:04:18] and sit with Mother sister Alfreda
[1:04:20] sister Anita in different ones we
[1:04:22] appreciate that so much it has not been
[1:04:25] needed just yet but we'll see what the
[1:04:27] future holds
[1:04:29] I am hoping that in the next few hours
[1:04:31] uh
[1:04:38] the Home gate opens
[1:04:41] and that is all in God's hands
[1:04:44] isn't it
[1:04:45] I'm trying to get it out well we have
[1:04:48] birthdays this week
[1:04:51] not mine
[1:04:54] tomorrow Jennifer Jernigan has a
[1:04:57] birthday she's not here this morning
[1:05:00] because her
[1:05:01] usually non-romantic husband
[1:05:07] her rather average husband
[1:05:12] oh if I'm not crying I can laugh
[1:05:15] laughing will help me
[1:05:17] especially if I'm picking on Chad
[1:05:20] but he surprised her with the getaway
[1:05:23] and I love that and I just pray that
[1:05:26] they have a great time and and the kids
[1:05:30] have done okay
[1:05:32] I asked them had they been fighting he
[1:05:34] said no we haven't
[1:05:35] was it Luke I was talking to he said no
[1:05:37] we've not been fighting

[1:14:06] the prophet of God said it's just a
[1:14:08] doorway we're we're just going through a
[1:14:11] changing room now this is not the
[1:14:14] reality that is to come there is a
[1:14:17] reality we're walking in the negative
[1:14:20] that's the positive
[1:14:22] these Saints who have gone before us
[1:14:24] they're walking in the positive and
[1:14:27] they're wondering why we're having such
[1:14:29] a hard time down here with the negative
[1:14:31] they say if you could just see what we
[1:14:33] see if you could hear what we hear
[1:14:36] experience what we experience you'd
[1:14:38] never get cold you'd never get backslid
[1:14:42] you'd run all the way
[1:14:45] my little great aunt used to sing that
[1:14:47] I'd Lord I'd be willing to run all the
[1:14:49] way if I falter while I'm trying don't
[1:14:53] be angry let me stay Lord I'd be willing
[1:14:57] to run all the way
[1:14:59] some of us have run all the way
[1:15:02] there are some in this room that have
[1:15:04] never stopped running
[1:15:06] that's right you know that's something
[1:15:08] to celebrate
[1:15:09] they've never stopped running when they
[1:15:11] said yes to the Lord they realized then
[1:15:13] there was nothing to look back to
[1:15:16] nothing to look back to
[1:15:19] they asked me this week did your mother
[1:15:20] ever smoke I said she sure did did she
[1:15:24] ever drink she sure did I said she
[1:15:27] cussed pretty bad too
[1:15:29] the doctor didn't care about that
[1:15:32] he said well how long ago was that I
[1:15:34] said 1985 middle of the summer 1985. he
[1:15:38] said well how would you remember that I
[1:15:39] said that's because the Lord met her
[1:15:42] he met her and saved her soul
[1:15:46] and she never did that again
[1:15:49] boy those doctors there were two doctors
[1:15:51] and a bunch of a bunch of student
[1:15:52] doctors there interns there their eyes
[1:15:55] got big open the the little doctor one
[1:15:59] from Haiti
[1:16:01] she she looked up and she said I know
[1:16:03] what you're talking about
[1:16:05] he said I know what you're talking about
[1:16:07] Hallelujah okay Romans chapter 6
[1:16:12] I'm going to give you a a heads up
[1:16:15] my uh phone is on and uh if for some
[1:16:21] reason I would need to take a phone call
[1:16:23] then I'll just take it
[1:16:26] and you'll just be praying while I do
[1:16:29] and we'll get right back in here all
[1:16:31] right let's read so you can be seated
[1:16:33] again may God bless every one of these
[1:16:36] precious streamers we we had a little
[1:16:39] hiccup there on YouTube I mean on
[1:16:41] Facebook but I think they've got a link
[1:16:44] posted
[1:16:45] and uh God bless sister Ethel in the UK
[1:16:50] who is asking prayer for her
[1:16:52] granddaughter 22 months old in the
[1:16:55] hospital on oxygen
[1:16:57] very poorly needs a touch from the Lord
[1:17:00] father would you reach right now to the
[1:17:03] United Kingdom would you touch that
[1:17:06] precious little 22 month old child
[1:17:10] precious little girl You Are the Healer
[1:17:13] you're the wonderful physician you're
[1:17:17] more than able to heal her body to raise
[1:17:20] her up as a testimony that Jesus is the
[1:17:23] same
[1:17:25] yesterday today and forever he changes
[1:17:28] not to God be the glory to God be the
[1:17:32] glory to God be the glory
[1:17:35] bless all of you Romans 6.
[1:17:38] verse 1 what shall we say then
[1:17:42] shall we continue in sin that Grace May
[1:17:46] abound
[1:17:47] God forbid
[1:17:49] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[1:17:54] any longer therein
[1:17:56] no you're not that so many of us as were
[1:18:00] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:18:04] into
[1:18:07] uh-uh I didn't hear you
[1:18:09] into his death
[1:18:12] into his death
[1:18:15] didn't say into his life
[1:18:17] said into his death
[1:18:20] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:18:23] baptism
[1:18:26] into death
[1:18:28] what are we baptized into
[1:18:31] death is that clear
[1:18:34] is that clear to you do you understand
[1:18:37] that we are baptized into unto his death
[1:18:43] we're joining with him in death
[1:18:46] baptism in the water is a type it is a
[1:18:51] spiritual type of what's taking place in
[1:18:55] the spirit realm we are being baptized
[1:18:58] with water in the natural uh but we are
[1:19:01] looking for another baptism which is one
[1:19:04] by the spirit
[1:19:06] a spirit baptism and spiritually we
[1:19:10] enter into his death when we obey his
[1:19:14] word
[1:19:15] by baptism or by whatever means we
[1:19:18] choose to say yes to the word of God
[1:19:21] every yes is for a purpose every yes to
[1:19:26] the Lord is for a reason
[1:19:28] that like hurry
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:41] foreign
[1:20:15] therefore we are buried with him
[1:20:18] by baptism into death
[1:20:22] that like as Christ was raised up
[1:20:26] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:20:32] even so we also should walk how
[1:20:38] in newness of life
[1:20:41] there there must be death
[1:20:44] before there can be a resurrection
[1:20:47] we have to enter into his death before
[1:20:50] we can enter into his resurrection we
[1:20:53] can't have a new life until the old life
[1:20:55] is dead if you understand that say man
[1:20:58] all right verse 5 for if we have been
[1:21:02] planted together
[1:21:05] in the likeness
[1:21:07] of his death
[1:21:10] we are fellowshipping in his death
[1:21:15] baptized into his death
[1:21:19] we are cooperating with him in his death
[1:21:24] planted together we shall be also in the
[1:21:29] likeness of his resurrection
[1:21:35] wonderful powerful words
[1:21:38] the next verse knowing this that our old
[1:21:43] man
[1:21:47] I don't hear you
[1:21:50] it's crucified with him
[1:21:56] how many times was he crucified just
[1:21:59] once
[1:22:00] and so when he was crucified
[1:22:04] that's what the word says but that ain't
[1:22:07] how the preacher be I'm not asking you
[1:22:09] how the preacher preaches I'm asking you
[1:22:12] what the word said he said knowing this
[1:22:15] that our old man is crucified with him
[1:22:17] that the body of sin might be
[1:22:21] the body of sin destroyed
[1:22:24] that henceforth we should not
[1:22:28] serve sin if you're serving sin you
[1:22:31] didn't die
[1:22:34] there's no need in graying it out or
[1:22:38] compromising it if you're still serving
[1:22:41] unbelief
[1:22:44] living in doubt
[1:22:46] instead of living in faith
[1:22:49] then you've not died
[1:22:52] you don't get another opportunity to die
[1:22:57] so what do I do brother you remember
[1:22:59] that you have joined with him in his
[1:23:03] death
[1:23:04] let him have his perfect way in your
[1:23:06] life until you're dead
[1:23:09] quit squirming
[1:23:14] just die
[1:23:17] you know here's your problem here's my
[1:23:20] problem the two only two great forces in
[1:23:24] the whole wide world and they both want
[1:23:26] us dead
[1:23:30] the Devil Wants You Dead
[1:23:32] your papa wants you dead
[1:23:35] you can't afford to stay alive
[1:23:39] for he that is dead is freed
[1:23:45] you got to be dead
[1:23:47] he that is dead is freed from sin
[1:23:51] well I don't think that's what it means
[1:23:53] brother Shelley well I didn't know he
[1:23:54] had any theologians here this morning
[1:23:57] I didn't know we had any DDS here this
[1:24:00] morning all I know is what it says
[1:24:03] the holy spirit is here to tell us what
[1:24:06] it means all I know is what it says for
[1:24:09] he that is dead is freed from sin next
[1:24:13] verse now if we be dead with Christ it's
[1:24:18] not our own death
[1:24:20] it's are we Dead with Christ we believe
[1:24:24] that we shall also do what
[1:24:28] live with him you may be seated may God
[1:24:31] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[1:24:34] word I want you to rest but I don't want
[1:24:36] you to get quiet I don't want you to go
[1:24:39] comatose
[1:24:41] I slept less than three hours last night
[1:24:44] I can be here because of him I don't
[1:24:47] know what your circumstances are but you
[1:24:49] can be here because of him
[1:24:52] and his word is what's going to get us
[1:24:54] through this afternoon
[1:24:56] it's what's going to get us up in the
[1:24:58] morning it's how we're going to make it
[1:25:00] through the week
[1:25:01] it's by fellowshipping in his word
[1:25:04] where are we
[1:25:06] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[1:25:10] that we shall also live with him verse 9
[1:25:13] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:25:17] the dead
[1:25:21] which death are we talking about the
[1:25:24] only one
[1:25:25] he only died once
[1:25:27] he was only smitten once
[1:25:30] he did such an excellent and complete
[1:25:33] job
[1:25:34] he never has to die again
[1:25:37] I know there's been this unusual
[1:25:40] emphasis at times around the message
[1:25:43] that has almost de-emphasized the blood
[1:25:48] I don't understand that
[1:25:51] you say well brother Branham said well
[1:25:53] we're basing brother random was basing
[1:25:55] what he said on the word
[1:25:57] and Grace without Grace no one is saved
[1:26:02] he said have you met Grace
[1:26:05] have you met Amazing Grace how many of
[1:26:08] you can say yes I've met her
[1:26:11] but you must understand that without the
[1:26:14] blood Grace is empty
[1:26:17] there has to be a price there has to be
[1:26:21] a token for Redemption
[1:26:23] there has to be the shedding of blood so
[1:26:26] Grace became the transportation it
[1:26:30] became the truck that got the blood to
[1:26:33] your house but if the blood had not
[1:26:36] arrived you are still dead
[1:26:41] had the blood not gotten to your house
[1:26:43] you are still lost because the blood is
[1:26:48] the very life of God and without the
[1:26:51] life of God you have an expiration date
[1:26:53] you can't live eternally without the
[1:26:56] life of God so don't de-emphasize the
[1:27:01] blood
[1:27:02] somebody asked me one time around the
[1:27:04] message do you really think you ought to
[1:27:06] sing those songs about the blood knowing
[1:27:08] what the prophet said I said absolutely
[1:27:10] because I know what the word said
[1:27:13] we're not saved by works we're saved by
[1:27:18] grace but without the shedding of blood
[1:27:21] there is no remission for sins
[1:27:24] so I want you to understand that Grace
[1:27:27] was the transportation that got the
[1:27:31] token price of God's blood to you
[1:27:36] Grace brought it to you in your
[1:27:39] condition you couldn't have gotten to
[1:27:41] the blood on your own the blood had to
[1:27:45] come to you his hand had to reach
[1:27:48] farther down than you and I could reach
[1:27:52] up
[1:27:52] we could have never gotten to Grace we
[1:27:56] could have never gotten to the blood but
[1:27:58] Grace delivered the token life of the
[1:28:03] blood to you met you right in the gutter
[1:28:08] he brought you from the gutter most to
[1:28:11] the uttermost
[1:28:13] met you right in your sin right in your
[1:28:17] bondage right in your addiction right in
[1:28:20] your filth the blood found you there
[1:28:23] because Grace got it to you
[1:28:26] so you're saved by grace because you had
[1:28:29] to get the blood the token price had to
[1:28:31] get to where you are but do not
[1:28:33] de-emphasize the power of the blood of
[1:28:36] God for without that blood there is no
[1:28:39] hope for salvation and you'll find that
[1:28:42] balance is very well in the message of
[1:28:46] the hour
[1:28:47] how dare you take a few quotations out
[1:28:50] of context and de-emphasize the blood
[1:28:52] the bride will never stand for that
[1:28:54] we'll never stand for that
[1:28:56] we'll never stand for that because we
[1:28:59] know it's the blood that changes us
[1:29:01] yes we understand that we want to
[1:29:05] emphasize the blood
[1:29:06] I want to sing about it I want to talk
[1:29:09] about it but I also want to understand
[1:29:11] that there was a Chasm between us and
[1:29:14] the blood we had to have some way of
[1:29:16] getting it to where we were
[1:29:20] praise God I hope you're getting that
[1:29:22] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:29:24] the dead
[1:29:26] dieth no more
[1:29:28] death
[1:29:29] hath no more
[1:29:31] dominion over him
[1:29:33] he's not ruled by Death
[1:29:36] he's not restrained by Death
[1:29:39] he conquered death
[1:29:41] he defeated death
[1:29:43] if you believe that
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:47] for in that he died he died unto sin
[1:29:51] once that was enough but in that he
[1:29:54] liveth he liveth unto God it says he
[1:29:58] lives eternally died one time but lives
[1:30:01] eternally he doesn't just live forever
[1:30:03] he lives eternally
[1:30:06] eternity is longer than forever how many
[1:30:08] of you know that
[1:30:10] amen all right he goes on likewise
[1:30:13] reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
[1:30:15] indeed to sin but alive unto God through
[1:30:19] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:30:21] so we're dead
[1:30:24] and yet we live
[1:30:26] because we understand the power of his
[1:30:29] reproducible resurrection
[1:30:32] this resurrection that is for us
[1:30:35] it was his resurrection but in the same
[1:30:38] manner he chose to share his death with
[1:30:41] us he chooses to share his
[1:30:45] his life
[1:30:46] with us by the power of the resurrection
[1:30:50] and now verse 12 the last verse let not
[1:30:52] sin therefore reign
[1:30:58] in your dyable body
[1:31:01] your mortal body
[1:31:03] one day the body that you live in now is
[1:31:05] going to die it is a mortal body and
[1:31:09] your mortal body you are not to allow
[1:31:12] unbelief to Reign to rule to influence
[1:31:17] your decisions while you're living in
[1:31:20] the Mortal body you know the only sin is
[1:31:22] unbelief
[1:31:24] isn't that right all of these other
[1:31:27] things are the attributes of sin people
[1:31:29] drink and smoke and cuss and commit
[1:31:31] adultery and fornication and perversion
[1:31:33] and do all the things they do because
[1:31:35] somewhere in their life there is
[1:31:37] unbelief
[1:31:39] if you really believe that he is who he
[1:31:41] says he is and that he did what he said
[1:31:43] he did and that he's doing what he said
[1:31:45] he's doing
[1:31:47] then you are dying with him
[1:31:50] you are fellowshipping his death and
[1:31:52] your unbelief dies when the rest of you
[1:31:55] dies
[1:31:56] and you say I believe Lord help my
[1:31:59] unbelief I believe Lord I believe help
[1:32:02] my unbelief
[1:32:04] if unbelief ever Rises up and you can't
[1:32:07] think of Sister shoshana's song this
[1:32:10] morning and you you're just battling in
[1:32:13] the mind then you have to press your way
[1:32:15] back into the word
[1:32:17] and you have to take God at his word and
[1:32:19] say wait a minute doesn't matter how I
[1:32:22] feel doesn't matter how I think doesn't
[1:32:25] matter what it looks like all that
[1:32:27] matters is what the word has said
[1:32:32] so don't let sin reign in your mortal
[1:32:34] body that you should obey the lust
[1:32:36] thereof are you with me good I'm going
[1:32:39] to ask you a hundred more times
[1:32:41] now once you go to Psalms we got to
[1:32:43] hurry because I haven't introduced my
[1:32:44] subject yet
[1:32:46] Psalm 139 verse 16 and 18 in the
[1:32:50] Amplified Bible
[1:32:51] and if you have a problem with that plug
[1:32:54] your ears
[1:32:55] because I'm going to read it out of the
[1:32:57] Amplified anyhow
[1:32:59] your eyes
[1:33:01] saw my unformed
[1:33:05] substance
[1:33:07] and in your book
[1:33:11] thank you sister Kathy all the days
[1:33:17] I want to emphasize that not that we
[1:33:19] haven't already but I won't emphasize
[1:33:21] that all the days a double l means all
[1:33:25] that's all all means all make sure you
[1:33:29] understand that all means all
[1:33:32] I know we like to say all kinds of
[1:33:34] little fun things with words and we like
[1:33:36] to say the whosoever will doesn't mean
[1:33:38] whosoever will and we like to say all
[1:33:40] that but please be aware of this all
[1:33:45] means all
[1:33:47] it is without exception all of your days
[1:33:51] without exception
[1:33:53] were written
[1:33:56] they were written
[1:33:58] before ever they took shape
[1:34:03] when as yet there was none of them
[1:34:09] before you ever breathed your first
[1:34:12] breath on planet Earth your life story
[1:34:16] had already been written in the mind of
[1:34:20] God
[1:34:21] and that's why nothing panics him
[1:34:24] That's why nothing causes him anxiety
[1:34:27] and nothing catches him by surprise if
[1:34:31] you and I could read the book of our
[1:34:33] life we would be ready for anything
[1:34:36] but he has not given us that Grace to
[1:34:39] know what's on every page of every day
[1:34:42] of our life but he knows
[1:34:45] everything your sin your unbelief the
[1:34:48] attributes of your unbelief he knew all
[1:34:51] of that he knew your drug use he knew
[1:34:54] you're whoring around he knew every bit
[1:34:56] of it he saw it all it was all written
[1:34:59] down it was all recorded he knew it
[1:35:05] you know what's so fascinating about
[1:35:07] that he loved you anyway
[1:35:09] he watched over you anyway he pursued
[1:35:14] you anyway
[1:35:15] he didn't see you as dirty
[1:35:18] he thought you were worth saving
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] no one ever knew you like your papa
[1:35:25] knows you
[1:35:27] and yet he thought you were worth saving
[1:35:30] he went all the way to the Cross because
[1:35:33] he wanted you
[1:35:37] how many of you have ever become so
[1:35:39] frustrated with somebody you just said
[1:35:40] I'm done with him
[1:35:45] I may or may not have said it this week
[1:35:49] I'm done with him
[1:35:51] I'm done with her
[1:35:54] glad that even on the worst page of your
[1:35:57] life your papa never said such a thing
[1:36:00] as that about you he saw your days of
[1:36:03] confusion he saw your days of blindness
[1:36:06] he saw your days of hypocrisy he saw
[1:36:10] your day
[1:36:13] before you were ever fully formed in
[1:36:16] your mother's belly all the days of your
[1:36:19] life written
[1:36:21] in his book
[1:36:23] when as yet none of them had begun to
[1:36:26] happen now either you believe that or
[1:36:28] you don't
[1:36:30] you don't get to change your mind
[1:36:32] midstream
[1:36:34] you either believe that or you don't
[1:36:36] believe that
[1:36:37] and if you believe that you will
[1:36:39] understand that all things
[1:36:45] how many things
[1:36:48] all things work
[1:36:52] together
[1:36:58] I'll get to that in a minute all things
[1:37:01] verse 17 how precious and weighty also
[1:37:07] that word weighty is valuable how
[1:37:10] valuable also are your thoughts to me oh
[1:37:15] God
[1:37:16] how vast
[1:37:18] is the sum of them
[1:37:22] all of God's thoughts about you are
[1:37:26] written in the book of your life
[1:37:29] and yet this room would not hold the
[1:37:33] thoughts
[1:37:34] that he has thought about you
[1:37:36] he has thought about you so often
[1:37:40] so many times with such love with such
[1:37:45] care with such compassion that if every
[1:37:48] one of his thoughts about you were
[1:37:50] written down on pages of paper this room
[1:37:54] perhaps would not be able to hold the
[1:37:57] volumes
[1:37:58] if every thought he'd ever had
[1:38:01] I'm just it's what he said
[1:38:04] how precious and weighty also are your
[1:38:06] thoughts to me o God how vast is the sum
[1:38:10] of them
[1:38:12] Verse 18 if I could count them
[1:38:19] if I could count them they would be more
[1:38:22] in number than the sand
[1:38:26] every little grain of sand on every
[1:38:29] beach in the entire world and all the
[1:38:33] sand underneath thee ocean and all the
[1:38:36] sand on Sand Mountain Alabama
[1:38:39] where they grow those amazing tomatoes
[1:38:42] and all the sandy soil of this nation if
[1:38:46] all of that sin was gathered together
[1:38:50] you might begin to get an idea of how
[1:38:53] many times the Lord had thought about
[1:38:55] you
[1:38:58] now you may be wondering about now how
[1:39:00] does he have time to think about anybody
[1:39:02] else he's God he doesn't live in time
[1:39:06] he lives in eternity and because are you
[1:39:09] with me
[1:39:10] and because he is eternal let me just
[1:39:12] give you this example here or let me
[1:39:14] just give you this little uh a warning
[1:39:16] here
[1:39:17] you better amen now
[1:39:21] you better get in here now
[1:39:23] because it's about to get tight
[1:39:28] I haven't announced my subject yet
[1:39:31] it's going to get tight in a minute so
[1:39:33] this is your chance to let loose
[1:39:36] shout amen smile get in here because in
[1:39:42] a minute some of your stuff
[1:39:46] it's going to be laid out in here
[1:39:48] you you're going to be quiet then
[1:39:54] if I could count them there would be
[1:39:55] more in number than the sand when I
[1:39:57] awoke could I count to the end I would
[1:40:01] still be with you
[1:40:03] powerful
[1:40:05] I would still be with you I want to read
[1:40:08] you Romans 8 I was going to do that
[1:40:09] later but I want to read you Romans 8 28
[1:40:11] in the Amplified
[1:40:13] you've memorized it I'm sure in the King
[1:40:16] James but in the Amplified it says we
[1:40:19] are assured and no
[1:40:22] this is good oh this is so good
[1:40:25] you got to hear it this way we are
[1:40:28] assured and know that God being a
[1:40:32] partner in their labor
[1:40:37] God is partnering with all things
[1:40:43] in your life
[1:40:45] and all the things of your life and all
[1:40:49] the days of your life and all the
[1:40:51] thoughts of your life were written in
[1:40:54] his book
[1:40:55] before you were ever formed fully in
[1:40:58] your mother's womb and now God is
[1:41:01] partnering in labor with all things
[1:41:06] making sure that all things
[1:41:15] work together
[1:41:17] he's making sure
[1:41:21] that all things work together
[1:41:25] he's making sure
[1:41:27] that all things work together
[1:41:31] and are fitting are you with me
[1:41:34] punch your neighbor wake him up
[1:41:41] you don't I will
[1:41:46] making sure that all things work
[1:41:49] together
[1:41:50] and are fitting into a plan
[1:41:58] just remember it's a plan that you have
[1:42:01] already in eternity past said amen to
[1:42:09] you would know what you know had you not
[1:42:13] agreed
[1:42:18] you'd be trapped in denominationalism
[1:42:21] which is the mark of the beast
[1:42:27] somebody said I'm waiting on the mark of
[1:42:29] the beast to be no no no no no no
[1:42:33] that Antichrist Spirit has been in the
[1:42:35] earth since the time of Christ
[1:42:38] the word said so the mark of the beast
[1:42:42] is not a future reality it is a present
[1:42:45] reality
[1:42:46] we're not looking for a tattoo on your
[1:42:49] hand or one on your forehead we
[1:42:51] understand that by joining yourselves in
[1:42:55] League
[1:42:57] in Union
[1:42:59] with a lie
[1:43:04] makes you under a delusion
[1:43:09] that right hand of Fellowship
[1:43:13] means joining in partnership with
[1:43:17] something that God has rejected
[1:43:20] God has rejected denominationalism
[1:43:24] I wish you'd say Amen
[1:43:26] he's not only rejected it he has cursed
[1:43:30] it
[1:43:34] there's a Remnant that is still hid in
[1:43:37] error
[1:43:39] waiting on the bride
[1:43:44] waiting on the adoption of sons
[1:43:47] waiting on you and I to begin to rise up
[1:43:50] and do what we're here to do
[1:43:52] we're here to finish the king's business
[1:43:54] the bride is not here to look pretty on
[1:43:57] the Shelf the bride is here to finish
[1:44:00] the bridegroom's business
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:05] if God needed William Branham to finish
[1:44:09] his business on Earth he would have
[1:44:11] never taken him from the scene
[1:44:19] brother Branham did exactly what God
[1:44:22] called him to do he introduced a people
[1:44:25] to the bridegroom the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:29] and then he prayed the prayer of John
[1:44:32] the Baptist
[1:44:33] may I decrease
[1:44:38] many churches many Believers have failed
[1:44:41] to let that prayer be a reality
[1:44:45] because they are holding on to humanity
[1:44:50] you can't hold on to humanity you have
[1:44:53] to hold on to the bridegroom
[1:44:56] choose a company Three's a Crowd it's
[1:45:00] you and the bridegroom in the bridal
[1:45:02] chamber it's not you and your pastor and
[1:45:06] the bridegroom it's not you and the
[1:45:09] prophet
[1:45:10] and the bridegroom it's not you and a
[1:45:13] modern day apostle
[1:45:16] and the bridegroom it's got to be you in
[1:45:19] the bridegroom
[1:45:20] you wouldn't even know how to get in
[1:45:22] there if God hadn't sent a friend of the
[1:45:24] bridegroom
[1:45:26] we wouldn't know how to get to Christ if
[1:45:28] we hadn't heard the word like we did
[1:45:30] the very fact that you have heard the
[1:45:32] word and to the best of your ability
[1:45:34] have embraced it as the truth and caused
[1:45:37] your life to line up with it to me is
[1:45:40] proof
[1:45:41] that God is partnering with all things
[1:45:44] in your life he's bringing all things
[1:45:47] together they are fitting into a plan
[1:45:51] and in the end it is for your good
[1:45:55] the Amplified said for good to and for
[1:45:58] those who love God and are called
[1:46:02] according to his design and purpose
[1:46:06] all things work together for the good of
[1:46:08] them that love the Lord to them that are
[1:46:10] the called according to his purpose if
[1:46:14] you believe that's amen have you ever
[1:46:16] had a day that you didn't believe that
[1:46:22] have you ever had a moment that you
[1:46:24] wondered about that
[1:46:26] have you ever had a minute that you
[1:46:28] conveniently tried to forget that
[1:46:31] I'm so glad that God is Not
[1:46:33] schizophrenic
[1:46:35] I'm so glad that God doesn't need
[1:46:37] medication
[1:46:39] he doesn't have a split personality
[1:46:42] he said all things
[1:46:48] this thing must surely be from the devil
[1:46:50] well let me tell you something the devil
[1:46:52] couldn't get to you
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:58] except that it's a part of
[1:47:00] all things
[1:47:06] sickness all things
[1:47:09] heartache all things
[1:47:11] marriage difficulty all things
[1:47:14] betrayals all things
[1:47:17] hurts and wounds and Scar are you with
[1:47:19] me
[1:47:22] all things
[1:47:24] let me hear the church say all things
[1:47:27] I want to make sure that we understand
[1:47:28] that
[1:47:29] I want you to go to Galatians 2. I
[1:47:31] haven't started preaching yet
[1:47:33] Galatians 2 20. I I've been shut up in a
[1:47:37] hospital room all week
[1:47:40] I'm just glad to see somebody that's not
[1:47:42] dressed in Scrubs
[1:47:45] I am crucified this is King James I am
[1:47:49] crucified with Christ
[1:47:52] nevertheless I live
[1:47:55] yet not I
[1:47:58] but Christ
[1:48:01] liveth
[1:48:03] in me
[1:48:04] that's powerful but wait till you hear
[1:48:08] this
[1:48:10] and the life
[1:48:13] which I now live in the flesh
[1:48:17] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:48:22] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:48:28] allow me just to paraphrase here I am
[1:48:31] crucified with Christ I died
[1:48:34] when Christ died yet I live
[1:48:38] but the life that I now live is not my
[1:48:42] old life
[1:48:43] my old life died it died before it was
[1:48:47] ever born
[1:48:52] because you remember that Christ was not
[1:48:55] crucified first at Calvary
[1:48:59] he was first crucified where
[1:49:01] in the mind of God
[1:49:04] before there ever was a Calvary Christ
[1:49:07] was crucified in the mind of God now it
[1:49:11] had to happen in the Earth
[1:49:12] because whatever happens in eternity has
[1:49:15] to break through into time so that you
[1:49:18] and I who are creatures of the time can
[1:49:21] break back forth into that which is
[1:49:24] eternal because you are born
[1:49:26] eternal
[1:49:30] somebody said how could you say
[1:49:31] something like that because you are of
[1:49:34] the seed of Christ
[1:49:37] if the seed of Christ is in you that
[1:49:40] which is eternal has already been
[1:49:43] demonstrated
[1:49:45] in your life
[1:49:46] so even before your experience I know
[1:49:49] this is going to be a stretch for some
[1:49:51] but even before you experienced God
[1:49:56] encountered God there was already
[1:49:59] something Eternal laying in you
[1:50:04] now if you believe I'm not preaching the
[1:50:06] message I can I don't I didn't bring any
[1:50:08] quotes today
[1:50:10] but I love them all
[1:50:12] but I'll make one here
[1:50:14] brother random talks about the woman at
[1:50:16] the well
[1:50:17] having the seed of God in her
[1:50:22] now when did she get the seed of God
[1:50:24] when she joined the church
[1:50:30] did she get the seed of God before she
[1:50:32] had a husband
[1:50:36] of course she did
[1:50:39] think about what you're listening to
[1:50:43] when did she get the seed of God when
[1:50:45] she joined the church when she got saved
[1:50:47] when she went to the altar
[1:50:50] oh but the random said she came here
[1:50:53] with the representation of God in her
[1:50:56] how is that possible because before she
[1:50:59] was ever born God saw all of her days
[1:51:01] and every thought that he had ever had
[1:51:04] toward her was already written in his
[1:51:06] book
[1:51:07] God knew that the first husband wouldn't
[1:51:10] satisfy the second husband wouldn't
[1:51:12] satisfy the third husband wouldn't
[1:51:14] satisfied
[1:51:15] you have well said you've had five
[1:51:17] husbands and the one you have now is not
[1:51:19] your own
[1:51:20] God saw every bit of that he wrote down
[1:51:23] every name
[1:51:25] first it'll be Harry and then it'll be
[1:51:27] Joe and it'll be
[1:51:29] God knew every one of her husband's name
[1:51:33] he knew all about her
[1:51:37] and he said all things are going to work
[1:51:39] together in her life
[1:51:43] so that I can be most glorified
[1:51:46] you see he's jealous
[1:51:50] to him I said wait a minute God is a
[1:51:52] jealous God
[1:51:54] he's going to have his reward in you
[1:51:58] he's going to have his reward in you I
[1:52:01] would resist whatever you're going
[1:52:03] through right now in this moment if it's
[1:52:05] sleepiness I would resist it if it's
[1:52:08] nausea I would resist it
[1:52:11] my family can tell you I could hardly
[1:52:13] get dressed this morning because I was
[1:52:15] so nauseated because I was heaving
[1:52:17] trying to get my shirt on I was heaving
[1:52:20] trying to get over here heaving but I
[1:52:22] knew that I had to be here
[1:52:27] I think some people run from what they
[1:52:29] ought to stand against
[1:52:32] we don't need to run from the Roar
[1:52:35] we need to run toward the Roar
[1:52:37] brother sister anything worth having in
[1:52:40] God is worth fighting to get
[1:52:42] you choose whether you stay engaged in a
[1:52:45] service or not not the circumstances of
[1:52:47] your week
[1:52:49] you're not the only tired one you're not
[1:52:52] the only one that's worked hard this
[1:52:53] week somebody else sitting beside you is
[1:52:56] fighting that sleepy spirit
[1:52:58] but they must fight it
[1:53:01] you must fight it off because there's a
[1:53:04] truth here that God wants you to get
[1:53:06] before I ever announce my subject
[1:53:09] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[1:53:11] I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:53:14] and the life which I now live in the
[1:53:16] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:53:18] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:53:21] brother Branham said she sat on her
[1:53:23] mother's knee
[1:53:26] and she heard the stories of the
[1:53:30] exploits of a living God
[1:53:34] and every one of those thoughts and
[1:53:36] those wonderful stories began to Lodge
[1:53:38] itself
[1:53:40] and the only way that word could Lodge
[1:53:43] itself in her is because there was a
[1:53:45] representation there and the only reason
[1:53:47] why there was a reputation excuse me a
[1:53:49] representation there is because God
[1:53:51] foreknew her
[1:53:54] and by his foreknowledge he knew her
[1:53:56] choice
[1:53:57] because she didn't just make it on the
[1:53:59] earth she made it in eternity
[1:54:03] he knew her choice and so he let those
[1:54:06] words so seeds began to be sewn into her
[1:54:10] it found a lodging place because there
[1:54:13] was a representation there and brother
[1:54:15] Brandon even tells some of the stories
[1:54:16] that are that are that her mother told
[1:54:18] her like like the like the thief like
[1:54:21] the spies
[1:54:23] to Rahab
[1:54:26] she knew about the prostitute
[1:54:30] she knew about the prostitute that God
[1:54:32] used
[1:54:33] placed her in the lineage of Christ
[1:54:35] she knew about it
[1:54:37] and so all these things she goes out
[1:54:39] searching to satisfy this longing of her
[1:54:42] heart and she goes from one to husband
[1:54:44] two to three to four to five and then
[1:54:45] she's got one that doesn't belong to her
[1:54:47] and he doesn't satisfy either and I have
[1:54:49] preached to you for years that what she
[1:54:51] was longing for was not found in man
[1:54:53] number one two three four five or six
[1:54:55] but everything she ever needed in her
[1:54:57] life was found in the seventh man
[1:55:03] and the seventh man is not brother
[1:55:05] Branham the seventh man is Christ
[1:55:09] the angel of the Covenant is not a
[1:55:11] prophet the angel of the Covenant is a
[1:55:13] savior he's both Creator and savior
[1:55:19] I hope you catch that
[1:55:21] all right he goes on uh uh uh the life I
[1:55:25] now live let me read this in the
[1:55:26] Amplified let's Amplified and then we
[1:55:29] might announce our subject here in a
[1:55:31] minute I have been crucified with Christ
[1:55:37] we'll make sure you're reading it I know
[1:55:40] how you all cheat
[1:55:41] some of you is already through the verse
[1:55:44] in him
[1:55:46] I have
[1:55:53] then what in the world did Paul mean
[1:55:55] when he said I Die daily
[1:55:57] I'll tell you exactly what he meant he
[1:55:59] meant every day of my life I have to go
[1:56:02] back
[1:56:04] and place myself in the crucifixion of
[1:56:06] Christ so that my flesh will obey the
[1:56:09] word and not not my soul not my mind and
[1:56:12] my will and my emotions I Die daily I
[1:56:15] take myself all the way back to my death
[1:56:18] the one I had before I was born
[1:56:21] say somebody said isn't that out of
[1:56:22] order God's order is not man's order
[1:56:24] anyway we're talking about eternity and
[1:56:26] time now so don't get confused
[1:56:30] with him brother Branham says it clearly
[1:56:32] remember I mentioned this recently he
[1:56:34] said I was with Paul Revere last Sunday
[1:56:36] I think I mentioned it I was with Paul
[1:56:38] Revere well he wasn't really in the
[1:56:40] natural with Paul Revere but he said he
[1:56:42] identified himself as being with Paul
[1:56:44] Revere because he said I'm an American
[1:56:47] and and he said I was with Washington
[1:56:49] when he took the boat across the Chile
[1:56:52] Delaware whatever whatever I love it
[1:56:55] I've read it many many many times but he
[1:56:57] don't stop there
[1:56:59] he said and I was with Christ in the
[1:57:01] garden
[1:57:05] and I was with him at Calvary
[1:57:08] when the soldier pushed that spear in
[1:57:11] his side and butter blood and water
[1:57:12] flowed I was with him
[1:57:15] as his body lay in that cold dark grave
[1:57:18] but his Spirit man went down into the
[1:57:20] heart of the Earth
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:23] to capture the keys of death hell and
[1:57:27] the grave
[1:57:29] to lead captivity captive and to make a
[1:57:33] five-fold Ministry possible in the Earth
[1:57:40] he went after the Ascension gifts
[1:57:42] this is what the word says
[1:57:47] he stopped over into Paradise
[1:57:51] and he revealed himself
[1:57:54] where the random said he interrupted a
[1:57:55] testimony meeting that was going on
[1:57:58] Ezekiel had been testifying I saw him as
[1:58:01] a wheel in the middle of a wheel he said
[1:58:05] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they had
[1:58:08] testified I saw him as a fourth man in
[1:58:10] the fire
[1:58:13] I don't know David said I saw him this
[1:58:15] way that way or the other as a shepherd
[1:58:17] on the hills of Israel I don't know
[1:58:19] exactly who was talking but all of a
[1:58:21] sudden they didn't have to describe him
[1:58:23] anymore
[1:58:25] because he stepped right into Paradise
[1:58:29] one of the most Saints said various
[1:58:33] powerful there he is
[1:58:36] that's the one I saw Shadrach said
[1:58:38] that's him
[1:58:40] Daniel said that's the one that kept the
[1:58:43] lion's mouth closed all night Ezekiel
[1:58:47] said that's the one who stood as a wheel
[1:58:50] in the middle of the wheel
[1:58:55] and then he and and so that that's
[1:58:58] without the blood
[1:59:02] Those Old Testament Saints couldn't have
[1:59:04] eternal life without the blood of Christ
[1:59:09] they didn't get in that way they got in
[1:59:11] under the blood of a covenant of bulls
[1:59:13] and goats and
[1:59:15] but they couldn't go into eternity that
[1:59:17] way
[1:59:18] they were caught in Paradise in the
[1:59:21] realm of time but when cry oh when
[1:59:25] Christ made himself known and they
[1:59:27] recognized who he was they accepted what
[1:59:29] he had done Where Have You Been master
[1:59:32] mask where have you been and he began to
[1:59:33] tell them
[1:59:35] I was hanging on a cross
[1:59:38] my blood has been shed for your
[1:59:41] Redemption
[1:59:44] that's what they said
[1:59:46] what you just said is what they said so
[1:59:49] be it so be it so be it amen amen amen
[1:59:56] and then he said okay then come with me
[2:00:00] come with me
[2:00:02] scripture tells us he emptied out
[2:00:04] paradise
[2:00:07] somebody said where's that Matthew
[2:00:09] and many of the Saints
[2:00:13] just reading scripture now and many of
[2:00:15] the Saints which slept the rose
[2:00:18] many who had already died Resurrected
[2:00:20] and walked again the streets of
[2:00:22] Jerusalem
[2:00:23] is that what the word says
[2:00:25] not a one-man Resurrection
[2:00:28] but a many membered body Resurrection
[2:00:33] because Christ was the first fruits of
[2:00:36] the Resurrection all those other Saints
[2:00:39] could resurrect with him are you with me
[2:00:41] I know it's getting late not really
[2:00:45] all the rest of those Saints resurrected
[2:00:47] with him they began to walk the streets
[2:00:48] of Jerusalem can you imagine
[2:00:51] you're walking down to the market
[2:00:54] and all of a sudden you look up and
[2:00:56] there is ant flossy
[2:01:04] just think about it
[2:01:06] you better think about it
[2:01:09] you better think about it
[2:01:11] because it's about to happen that way
[2:01:12] again
[2:01:16] she said
[2:01:20] flossy
[2:01:22] is that you
[2:01:28] she's been dead 20 years
[2:01:31] what is happening oh
[2:01:35] there's my neighbor
[2:01:43] there's that crazy old man down the road
[2:01:48] walking down the street
[2:01:51] as fit as a fiddle
[2:01:53] as alive as he ever was
[2:01:56] what if the world has happened
[2:01:59] Christ had emptied out paradise
[2:02:02] Those Old Testament Saints had now said
[2:02:05] amen to the New Covenant that God had
[2:02:07] sealed with his own blood and for a
[2:02:09] quick short period of time they walked
[2:02:12] the streets of Jerusalem as a testimony
[2:02:15] that a better Covenant had been served
[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:19] a better one
[2:02:21] one that is eternal the old Covenant was
[2:02:25] temporal because this the the sacrifice
[2:02:28] of the Lamb or the ram was only good
[2:02:35] until it expired
[2:02:37] that that sin offering until you sinned
[2:02:39] again
[2:02:40] that atonement until you till the next
[2:02:42] year came a long time for atonement
[2:02:44] every one of those offerings of that old
[2:02:46] testament old testament old Covenant
[2:02:48] every one of those offerings had an
[2:02:50] expiration and you had to keep doing it
[2:02:52] again
[2:02:53] doing it that's where that's where the
[2:02:55] Pentecostals get it
[2:02:59] we got to go back and do it again got to
[2:03:00] go back and do it again gotta go back do
[2:03:02] it again gotta go back and do it again
[2:03:03] gotta go back and do it again if I had a
[2:03:05] dollar for every time I ever heard him
[2:03:06] quote as a boy repent and do your first
[2:03:08] work so repent and do your first work so
[2:03:10] repent and do your first works over
[2:03:11] repent do it first verse over so all we
[2:03:13] knew how to do is repent and be baptized
[2:03:14] again
[2:03:16] under titles it wasn't going to save us
[2:03:18] anyway
[2:03:19] hello
[2:03:21] because they were caught up in the
[2:03:23] spirit of a covenant that was not enough
[2:03:28] but when his blood was shed
[2:03:30] it's Eternal there's no expiration date
[2:03:32] on that offering he never has to die
[2:03:34] again he'll never have to bleed again
[2:03:36] you hear me he'll never have to bleed
[2:03:39] again
[2:03:41] once was enough
[2:03:43] and I want you to know the reason why we
[2:03:45] even mentioned that and it's not in my
[2:03:46] notes and it's not in my subject
[2:03:50] but the reason why we mention it is
[2:03:51] because we are told and I believe
[2:03:54] that as the first resurrection was so
[2:03:56] shall be the second
[2:04:00] we don't believe that the Rapture is
[2:04:02] it's a twinkling of an eye we believe
[2:04:06] that that is a description of a suddenly
[2:04:10] but we believe that the coming of the
[2:04:11] Lord through the resurrection Rapture is
[2:04:13] a process that is already unfolding
[2:04:16] the Lord has already ascended it
[2:04:18] descended in his word a shout has gone
[2:04:21] out to gather a bridal people
[2:04:23] come on
[2:04:25] the voice of the Archangel is sounding
[2:04:27] even now if you have an ear to hear it
[2:04:30] he's talking even now if you have an ear
[2:04:33] to hear it
[2:04:34] and the last Trump will be the last and
[2:04:36] brother sister we're coming into that
[2:04:38] hour
[2:04:41] just before that last Trump
[2:04:46] people won't like this
[2:04:49] but I can't tell you the day of the hour
[2:04:51] but I can tell you the season
[2:04:55] it won't be Passover
[2:04:59] he finished that
[2:05:02] it'll be around the fall feast
[2:05:07] it'll be around the it'll be around
[2:05:10] Rosh Hashanah
[2:05:13] it'll be around tabernacle's time
[2:05:16] it'll be around the day of atonement
[2:05:18] that that that that season there we know
[2:05:21] that because it's the only Trump that
[2:05:23] hasn't yet been fulfilled
[2:05:26] just before that changing of our body
[2:05:32] the glory of the Lord so rich in the
[2:05:35] Earth the Bride of Jesus Christ speaking
[2:05:38] with the authority of her adoption
[2:05:43] by the power of the creative word
[2:05:45] missing limbs are being restored among
[2:05:48] the people
[2:05:52] somebody said how will they beat the
[2:05:54] media off I don't think anybody has any
[2:05:57] problem believing that we won't have to
[2:05:59] deal with the media in such a move as
[2:06:01] that
[2:06:04] because they're going to be too busy
[2:06:06] over there covering phony politics
[2:06:09] they are not going to have time to see
[2:06:11] what a what a little group of people
[2:06:13] scattered around the world are doing by
[2:06:15] speaking legs back into place
[2:06:18] and should somebody come along and catch
[2:06:20] it well it won't be much
[2:06:23] because they will I want you to know
[2:06:25] they will laugh
[2:06:26] they will laugh they already mock now
[2:06:28] they'll really mock then
[2:06:30] you just let somebody somebody said I
[2:06:33] don't even believe that's possible then
[2:06:34] you don't understand who the Creator is
[2:06:36] do you because he already placed he
[2:06:38] already placed tokens of his
[2:06:40] reproducible resurrection in the natural
[2:06:42] in the earth even certain species of
[2:06:44] starfish when the leg breaks off or an
[2:06:47] arm or whatever you call it then another
[2:06:48] one has the ability to regenerate and
[2:06:50] build itself nerves can repair and build
[2:06:52] bones get
[2:06:54] anything anywhere cells divide
[2:06:59] so don't you tell me that God can't do
[2:07:02] it
[2:07:03] you said well I really believe then you
[2:07:05] won't
[2:07:06] because if you don't believe now
[2:07:11] if you don't believe God can do it now
[2:07:13] you won't believe it when he does it
[2:07:16] it's Faith it's by faith these things
[2:07:18] operate
[2:07:19] not by sight
[2:07:22] there will be so many blinded to it
[2:07:25] there'll be those who ride up in their
[2:07:27] magazines you know what phone needs
[2:07:29] those people are I know he really had a
[2:07:31] leg I know it's just a some kind of
[2:07:33] camera trick
[2:07:35] the little bride will never even miss a
[2:07:37] Beat
[2:07:38] because it's not going to be a world
[2:07:41] thing it's not going to be a public show
[2:07:45] it's going to be the final confirmation
[2:07:47] of Who You Are
[2:07:48] quick short work
[2:07:52] you'll look up one hour as God begins to
[2:07:55] move and breathe that way in his people
[2:07:58] and you'll wake up one hour and you'll
[2:08:00] see sister Tebow
[2:08:07] you look up
[2:08:09] in Tremaine
[2:08:12] you look up and see sister Burgess
[2:08:18] oh I can't believe such as that then you
[2:08:21] don't understand what the Rapture
[2:08:23] Resurrection is all about many of the
[2:08:25] Saints which slept the rose and walked
[2:08:27] again the streets of Jerusalem but the
[2:08:29] random said it'll be just like it was in
[2:08:31] that first time it'll happen that way
[2:08:33] again and the dead in Christ even the
[2:08:36] scripture says
[2:08:37] even the scripture says imagine that the
[2:08:40] dead in Christ shall rise first
[2:08:42] then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:08:44] be caught up together meet him in there
[2:08:45] the church is the one who put in the in
[2:08:47] in some gap of time there or tried to
[2:08:50] interpret that in some other way
[2:08:52] it's not just a sequence it means what
[2:08:55] it says the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:08:57] first
[2:09:01] I dreamed it
[2:09:03] in the early 90s I dreamed it I had
[2:09:06] buried a sister in my granny's Church
[2:09:08] I had come home to preach the message I
[2:09:11] had baptized her sister Eileen Smith I
[2:09:14] had baptized her in the name of the Lord
[2:09:16] Jesus Christ she had been a trinitarian
[2:09:18] Holiness woman her whole life she
[2:09:20] received the message of the hour she was
[2:09:22] baptized in the name of Jesus shortly
[2:09:24] thereafter diagnosed with incurable
[2:09:27] cancer and left here so suddenly she
[2:09:29] never got feeble
[2:09:31] she never got weak
[2:09:33] it took her so quickly
[2:09:35] God let the truth come in just the right
[2:09:37] hour he let her get the right baptism in
[2:09:40] just the right hour and then he took her
[2:09:41] home well I buried her and I stood was
[2:09:43] only Christian at her funeral except a
[2:09:45] few that were with me
[2:09:47] and I preach the truth to her family and
[2:09:49] told them I'm not going to stand here
[2:09:51] and tell you that you'll see your mother
[2:09:53] again
[2:09:55] because the reality is you won't
[2:09:58] living the way you live
[2:10:03] so you better get a good Glimpse today
[2:10:08] before they close that box for the last
[2:10:10] time
[2:10:11] but if you have any hope of ever seeing
[2:10:13] her again it'll be because you have
[2:10:15] given your heart to the Lord Jesus
[2:10:17] Christ you've been baptized in the name
[2:10:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ and filled with
[2:10:21] the Holy Ghost in Fire and then you can
[2:10:23] have hope that you'll see your mother
[2:10:25] again you'll say well that must have got
[2:10:26] really mad at you are you kidding
[2:10:29] I wouldn't have said it if the Holy
[2:10:31] Ghost hadn't been there to say it
[2:10:33] I began to just offer an opportunity for
[2:10:36] prayer and and nearly the whole family
[2:10:39] started calling on the Lord
[2:10:41] shortly thereafter
[2:10:43] I went to bed one night I think it was a
[2:10:45] dream things happened in the night
[2:10:47] sometimes their dreams sometimes they're
[2:10:48] night visions sometimes their
[2:10:50] experiences sometimes they're more real
[2:10:52] than you sitting in front of me today
[2:10:55] so we might not always call it the right
[2:10:58] thing and understand exactly how it came
[2:11:00] but it came it was like a dream
[2:11:02] I saw myself sitting in the old
[2:11:04] Fellowship Hall of the church in
[2:11:05] Columbus where sister Smith went to
[2:11:07] church
[2:11:08] and someone we were working we were
[2:11:10] doing some things in the fellowship hall
[2:11:12] and somebody said brother Shelley
[2:11:13] there's someone here to see you I said
[2:11:15] well by all means send them in
[2:11:18] and they began to come down those steps
[2:11:20] Around The Landing in the old church and
[2:11:22] walk down into the fellowship hall where
[2:11:24] it was and it was Sister Smith standing
[2:11:26] there young and radiant and beautiful
[2:11:30] and very recognizable
[2:11:33] I know exactly how I felt my heart
[2:11:35] seemed to stop I lost my breath I ran
[2:11:38] toward where she was and before I knew
[2:11:40] it
[2:11:41] I did in the natural what I had in the
[2:11:44] dream what I had never done in the
[2:11:45] natural I'd never hugged her neck I'd
[2:11:47] never embraced her that way I had always
[2:11:49] respectfully shook her hand
[2:11:51] but before I knew what I had done I had
[2:11:54] thrown my arms around her and laid my
[2:11:57] head over on her chest
[2:11:59] and I never said one time in that dream
[2:12:03] oh Lord
[2:12:05] I hope this is real
[2:12:10] now I know what you mean
[2:12:13] I just screamed out this
[2:12:20] this it's here
[2:12:23] you say well that was just a dream yes
[2:12:27] but it wasn't a dream that day in
[2:12:29] Jerusalem
[2:12:32] and it won't be the dream the next time
[2:12:33] it happens
[2:12:35] you mark them as they leave
[2:12:38] you mark them as they leave to join the
[2:12:40] great cloud of witnesses let me tell you
[2:12:43] something they without us
[2:12:47] they'll never enter into the fullness of
[2:12:49] their inheritance until you do
[2:12:51] the dead in Christ shall rise first all
[2:12:53] right now
[2:12:55] it's 107.
[2:12:57] how much more time do I have
[2:13:00] if you need to slip out we understand
[2:13:04] you can certainly go
[2:13:15] I don't know if I can do this Justice in
[2:13:17] the time that I have but I'm going to
[2:13:18] try I'm going to have to read some of it
[2:13:20] is that all right you're going to stay
[2:13:21] with me
[2:13:23] let me see did I finish that verse
[2:13:26] no
[2:13:27] didn't did I did I finish Galatians 2 20
[2:13:30] and Amplified no I have been crucified
[2:13:33] with Christ in him I have shared his
[2:13:36] crucifixion it is no longer I who live
[2:13:39] but Christ the Messiah lives in me
[2:13:43] and the life I now live in the body I
[2:13:45] live how
[2:13:47] by faith in by adherence to and Reliance
[2:13:52] on and
[2:13:55] I heard Josh this morning during worship
[2:13:58] saying I Trust You Lord I Trust You Lord
[2:14:01] I Trust You Lord you we better
[2:14:05] because all of our days were written in
[2:14:07] his book before any of them ever came to
[2:14:09] be
[2:14:10] nobody has the master plan like he does
[2:14:14] nobody knew what was coming like he does
[2:14:16] nobody knows how it's going to turn out
[2:14:18] like he does
[2:14:22] I'm not sure if I want to hit this or
[2:14:24] not
[2:14:28] complete trust in the Son of God who
[2:14:31] loved me and gave himself up for me
[2:14:34] are you with me
[2:14:37] I want to talk to you from my heart I
[2:14:39] want you to listen carefully now
[2:14:41] this is what the lord gave me
[2:14:44] and I had to get to this place where I
[2:14:46] could share this
[2:14:48] I'm one of those believers
[2:14:50] I'm done thank you for the scripture I'm
[2:14:53] one of those believers who has been
[2:14:54] grievously mistreated
[2:14:59] by other believers
[2:15:02] it's gonna be quiet now
[2:15:04] I told you it was coming I told you amen
[2:15:06] while you can
[2:15:08] I've been grievously mistreated by other
[2:15:10] believers
[2:15:11] ever since I started the journey
[2:15:14] from the time I was seven years old
[2:15:16] filled with the Holy Ghost he placed a
[2:15:18] gift in my life that caused me lots and
[2:15:20] lots of problems
[2:15:23] and people love that gift as long as it
[2:15:24] was telling them their problems or or
[2:15:27] what they needed or or some detail that
[2:15:30] could help build their faith
[2:15:31] but when it began to expose their sin
[2:15:34] and their lifestyle and their hypocrisy
[2:15:36] they weren't so happy with me
[2:15:39] it started shortly after I received the
[2:15:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost it followed me
[2:15:43] through Pentecost it followed me through
[2:15:45] Holiness movement
[2:15:46] it followed me into the message of the
[2:15:49] hour
[2:15:51] I feel misunderstood
[2:15:54] I have been rejected
[2:15:56] I have been maligned
[2:15:59] I've had the truth told about me
[2:16:02] that hurt
[2:16:04] I've had lies told about me are you here
[2:16:10] I'm one of those
[2:16:12] I'm one of those who knows what it's
[2:16:15] like to be rejected by your own
[2:16:18] by your own family by your own church
[2:16:21] family
[2:16:24] and I'm not alone
[2:16:28] because most of you are one of those
[2:16:33] somewhere along your Christian Journey
[2:16:35] somebody in the church
[2:16:39] some other Christian
[2:16:41] has maligned you
[2:16:44] misunderstood you hold on
[2:16:47] rejected you lied about you
[2:16:52] sometimes they told the hurtful truth
[2:16:56] about you
[2:16:58] maybe it didn't have to be told
[2:17:02] I want to know if there's anybody in
[2:17:03] here that can relate to my story
[2:17:07] maybe you like me has found it very
[2:17:09] difficult through the years to deal with
[2:17:11] it
[2:17:12] it's easy to say I forgive
[2:17:16] it's a whole lot harder
[2:17:18] to forget it
[2:17:21] anybody with me
[2:17:23] but if you're looking for truth
[2:17:25] and you're looking for healing
[2:17:28] you can have it
[2:17:32] you can be healed
[2:17:37] can overcome your crippling battles
[2:17:43] you can place your broken Twisted feet
[2:17:46] under the master's table
[2:17:48] and be whole again
[2:17:51] but not until you are willing to
[2:17:54] acknowledge
[2:17:55] the true source
[2:17:58] of your crucifying experience
[2:18:03] you're going to have to know
[2:18:06] where it really come from
[2:18:09] who really is the instigator
[2:18:12] of your crucifixion
[2:18:17] the herd of one Christian being cruel to
[2:18:20] another Christian is severe
[2:18:24] it's the deepest pain
[2:18:27] because we expect the best treatment
[2:18:31] from our Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[2:18:34] we expect the world to misunderstand us
[2:18:37] but we expect the church
[2:18:41] the other believers to embrace us
[2:18:44] if anybody should understand the
[2:18:46] difficult life that we are called to
[2:18:48] live in holiness
[2:18:50] it should be our brothers and sisters in
[2:18:52] the church
[2:18:54] in the body not just the local body but
[2:18:57] the body of Christ Universal
[2:19:00] the pain from such harsh treatment could
[2:19:03] leave us affected
[2:19:05] for the rest of our lives
[2:19:07] until we make up our mind to climb out
[2:19:11] I'm inviting you today and you that
[2:19:14] stream and you that archive I'm inviting
[2:19:17] you to climb out
[2:19:20] because there were many Christians who
[2:19:22] lost their natural lives
[2:19:25] they were publicly literally crucified
[2:19:28] or murdered
[2:19:30] there was ironius and polycarp and John
[2:19:33] the Baptist and Paul and Peter and Huss
[2:19:35] and Tyndale and hundreds of thousands
[2:19:38] more countless others who lost their
[2:19:42] lives
[2:19:44] all by the hands
[2:19:48] of religious
[2:19:51] men
[2:19:53] it wasn't by atheists
[2:19:56] it wasn't by agnostics
[2:20:00] it was by Christians
[2:20:03] that many have been crucified
[2:20:06] the Catholic Church
[2:20:10] they like to call themselves the
[2:20:12] heartbeat
[2:20:14] the very womb of Christianity
[2:20:19] and history tells us that not one single
[2:20:22] organism or Army
[2:20:24] in the history of the world has murdered
[2:20:28] more men and women
[2:20:32] not by the communist Army
[2:20:35] not by Hitler's regime
[2:20:41] no one has killed more Christians
[2:20:44] than the Roman Catholic Church
[2:20:49] they were quite literally crucified
[2:20:54] by Christians
[2:20:56] can you say Amen
[2:20:58] you might say it was in name only we're
[2:21:00] not here to make those judgments we're
[2:21:03] just here to say they didn't consider
[2:21:05] themselves or identify themselves with a
[2:21:08] heathen or with the lost or with the
[2:21:11] agnostic or with the atheists they
[2:21:13] believe they were the church the mother
[2:21:15] Church the holy church
[2:21:18] they believe that they spoke for Christ
[2:21:20] and what they did they did at the
[2:21:22] beckoning of Christ
[2:21:24] and so when Catholic Crusaders marched
[2:21:27] into Jerusalem and crucified Jews on
[2:21:29] crosses
[2:21:32] when men like Martin Luther even raised
[2:21:35] up and said all the Christ Killers be
[2:21:37] damned
[2:21:40] they did it in the name of religion
[2:21:43] so you are not alone
[2:21:47] you also have been hurt and wounded and
[2:21:51] betrayed by the hands of religious men
[2:21:57] many of these times in our life we have
[2:22:00] moved on from and we no longer have to
[2:22:02] look
[2:22:05] at our crucifiers
[2:22:10] our circles have changed
[2:22:12] our fellowship has changed our church
[2:22:16] has changed
[2:22:18] but some of us
[2:22:20] every single service must face
[2:22:28] must sing with
[2:22:30] must worship with
[2:22:33] must pray with and pray for the very men
[2:22:37] and women
[2:22:41] who nailed us to the cross
[2:22:45] I didn't say that so that you would feel
[2:22:47] sorry for anybody here
[2:22:50] I did it simply to remind you
[2:22:54] you're not alone
[2:22:58] maybe you moved on to another family
[2:23:00] maybe you moved on to another church
[2:23:02] maybe some of this is so far behind you
[2:23:04] you don't ever want to think about it
[2:23:06] unless you realize in some way it has
[2:23:08] crippled you but some of us we don't
[2:23:11] have the same privilege of being able to
[2:23:13] leave it all behind
[2:23:15] we can't change jobs we can't change
[2:23:18] careers we can't get away from it by
[2:23:21] changing churches
[2:23:23] it follows us everywhere we go the Deep
[2:23:27] wounds
[2:23:28] foreign
[2:23:30] heard the message of the hour I knew it
[2:23:32] was the perfect word
[2:23:35] and I thought that the most perfect
[2:23:36] people in all the world should be
[2:23:38] gathered around and I believed they were
[2:23:40] I believed they were I literally
[2:23:44] sincerely
[2:23:46] believed they were
[2:23:53] and my honeymoon lasted at least 30 days
[2:24:00] it's going to be quiet
[2:24:02] and what I come to find out is the place
[2:24:05] that possesses the most truth
[2:24:10] will be plagued
[2:24:13] overrun
[2:24:15] by the most hate field
[2:24:18] bitter
[2:24:21] spiteful
[2:24:26] hypocritical people
[2:24:31] somebody said wouldn't you like to live
[2:24:33] in Jeffersonville no sir re
[2:24:40] there's no City in the earth that
[2:24:43] experience more demons cast out
[2:24:48] than the city of Jeffersonville
[2:24:53] when I have had need to pass through I
[2:24:55] pass through quickly usually
[2:24:58] with lots of prayer
[2:25:01] on the few occasions that I've ever had
[2:25:03] to spend the night there I pray over my
[2:25:05] room I cast out all the deity spirits
[2:25:09] apply
[2:25:11] all the man worshiping spirits
[2:25:14] I don't want to lay my children down in
[2:25:16] a room where those Spirits have been I
[2:25:18] want to purify it I do you can ask my
[2:25:21] amendment I do I believe I pray
[2:25:25] because if all those demon Spirits were
[2:25:27] cast out of that place you know what
[2:25:29] they didn't all go back to hell where
[2:25:31] they come from
[2:25:33] they like to linger
[2:25:35] they like to twist
[2:25:39] they like to instigate crucifixions
[2:25:45] of those who believe that they're still
[2:25:48] a five-fold Ministry
[2:25:51] who believe that God still speaks to
[2:25:53] pastors and Prophets and apostles and
[2:25:56] teachers and evangelists
[2:25:58] those who believe that it's a little bit
[2:26:00] more involved than press play and obey
[2:26:06] so all those demon Spirits they like to
[2:26:09] crucify and there they don't go very far
[2:26:11] and they will anoint anybody who who
[2:26:13] wants to be anointed so some of my
[2:26:16] hardest battles and most bloody
[2:26:19] experiences were not in denominational
[2:26:22] Pentecost
[2:26:24] I have lost more blood and received more
[2:26:27] wounds at the hands of men and women who
[2:26:30] claim to believe
[2:26:32] this end time message
[2:26:34] than I ever had in any of the other
[2:26:37] movements that God brought me through on
[2:26:39] my way to the truth
[2:26:41] and yet in all of that I cannot remain
[2:26:44] bitter
[2:26:47] I cannot spend my Ministry attacking
[2:26:50] them
[2:26:51] I must speak the truth today because
[2:26:54] there are those who need to be brought
[2:26:57] out
[2:26:58] but I cannot dedicate my life to
[2:27:02] criticizing other churches or other
[2:27:05] movements or other Ministries
[2:27:10] it is not the plan of God it is not the
[2:27:14] will of God it will destroy our lives
[2:27:17] we must simply realize it was not them
[2:27:28] when I tell you that I for one go to
[2:27:31] church
[2:27:33] today worship today preached to today
[2:27:36] men and women who have crucified me I'm
[2:27:39] telling you the truth
[2:27:41] but I'm telling you it wasn't them
[2:27:48] I can't excuse their sin
[2:27:51] and I'll tell you why
[2:27:53] this was the scripture the Lord said
[2:27:55] read this
[2:27:56] lest anybody get the idea
[2:27:59] that because it was God using you to
[2:28:02] throw stones
[2:28:06] lest anybody get the idea that we can
[2:28:09] now say well it was God's will to
[2:28:12] crucify my pastor so it's okay that he
[2:28:14] used me
[2:28:18] that's extreme Calvinism
[2:28:24] to the Primitive Baptist
[2:28:27] who in the mountains of West Virginia
[2:28:28] and Carolina would
[2:28:31] blow a man's head off with a shotgun
[2:28:35] and say he was predestinated to do it
[2:28:42] being a part or a play or a piece in
[2:28:46] God's predestinated plan does not excuse
[2:28:49] us
[2:28:51] for our unkindness
[2:28:55] for the lies we've told
[2:28:58] for the rumor somebody said my you seem
[2:29:00] like you're trying to take care of local
[2:29:01] church businesses I'm not at all
[2:29:04] and that's not even what this message is
[2:29:06] about
[2:29:09] but I I love transparency I see it so
[2:29:12] rarely in the body of Christ
[2:29:14] I see it even rarer among ministers
[2:29:18] so it anoints me and behooves me I want
[2:29:21] to be more transparent if you can't
[2:29:23] follow a broken wounded man who's on his
[2:29:25] way to Restoration
[2:29:29] if you can't relate to somebody who's
[2:29:30] been through some hard things and made
[2:29:32] some big mistakes along the way who will
[2:29:35] you be able to relate to
[2:29:40] you can't follow a parent who didn't
[2:29:42] always get it right
[2:29:45] who you relate to
[2:29:47] we should be transparent with one
[2:29:49] another but nobody should find excuse
[2:29:53] in the message of predestination for how
[2:29:56] you have treated other people
[2:30:00] and I said Lord give me a word give me
[2:30:02] something so that at the end of this
[2:30:04] message I'm giving it away now but so
[2:30:06] that at the end of this message I can
[2:30:07] share this so that nobody will walk out
[2:30:10] of here because I've seen people make
[2:30:12] big
[2:30:13] ugly mistakes
[2:30:15] and then turn around and say well it was
[2:30:17] for God's purpose
[2:30:20] as though that excuses them from the
[2:30:22] wounds
[2:30:23] that they have inflicted it does not
[2:30:26] that's not how God operates
[2:30:29] you need to understand that
[2:30:31] in Matthew chapter 18 verse 6 in the
[2:30:34] Amplified it says but whoever causes one
[2:30:38] of them one of these
[2:30:41] little ones who believe in and
[2:30:44] acknowledge and cleave to me
[2:30:48] to stumble and sin
[2:30:51] that is who entices him or hinders him
[2:30:56] in right conduct or thought it would be
[2:31:00] better more excellent more profitable
[2:31:02] more advantageous for him
[2:31:05] that was the last scripture in the notes
[2:31:09] for him to have a great Millstone
[2:31:13] fastened around his neck and to be sunk
[2:31:17] in the depth of the sea
[2:31:22] even if God wanted to be wounded
[2:31:25] even if God wanted me broken and God
[2:31:29] used you to do it
[2:31:31] that does not justify your deed
[2:31:40] if you should look around this room and
[2:31:42] see that through the years there are
[2:31:45] those sitting here who have wounded you
[2:31:46] just remember this you have also wounded
[2:31:51] foreign
[2:31:52] as I look around this room I see whole
[2:31:55] people I see godly people I see
[2:31:57] wonderful people but I don't see any
[2:32:00] people that are perfect
[2:32:04] I see a few people who hang on to this
[2:32:06] martyr syndrome as though they're the
[2:32:09] only ones that have ever been persecuted
[2:32:11] the only ones that have ever gone
[2:32:12] through hardship
[2:32:14] I've had preachers come and stand in
[2:32:16] this Pulpit referring to me and say I am
[2:32:20] not like your pastor who had a Golden
[2:32:22] Spoon in his mouth
[2:32:27] the Golden Spoon is quite relevant
[2:32:31] what looks to you like a Golden Spoon
[2:32:34] may be a cross on somebody else's back
[2:32:38] so the truth is all of us have been
[2:32:41] wounded most likely and all of us
[2:32:46] have wounded others
[2:32:48] I'm preaching
[2:32:49] I can see some of you can't get there
[2:32:51] but I'm preaching
[2:32:53] you ever had your feelings hurt
[2:32:56] guess what
[2:32:59] you've heard other people's feelings
[2:33:02] all of it for a reason
[2:33:05] all of it for a purpose all a part of
[2:33:08] God's plan but that doesn't let any of
[2:33:10] us off the hook
[2:33:11] we owe a repentant we owe it to God to
[2:33:14] repent of how we were used
[2:33:18] and we should make it as much as
[2:33:20] possible Right with one another
[2:33:24] it's the only way to go forward
[2:33:26] anybody with me
[2:33:28] this is butchered lot more butchered
[2:33:31] than I expected but I need my last 30
[2:33:32] minutes sorry I'm taking and I'm
[2:33:34] claiming it if you need to go the
[2:33:36] washroom please do
[2:33:38] if you need to slip out for a moment
[2:33:40] stretch please do
[2:33:41] I don't know when I'll be back to preach
[2:33:43] I may be here Tuesday night I don't know
[2:33:45] I don't know so let me finish what I'm
[2:33:48] doing this morning if at all possible
[2:33:50] the pain from such a harsh treatment
[2:33:52] could leave you affected the rest of
[2:33:53] your life
[2:33:55] however if you refuse uh thankfully
[2:33:57] excuse me thankfully we have not had to
[2:33:59] deal with nearly as difficult
[2:34:02] circumstances as many who have clung to
[2:34:04] the name of Jesus Through The Years and
[2:34:06] lost their physical life how many of you
[2:34:08] can say I'm still living
[2:34:10] I've been wounded but I'm still living
[2:34:12] been talked about but I'm still living
[2:34:13] I've been broken been crucified
[2:34:17] but I'm still walking I'm still growing
[2:34:21] how many of you can hold up your hand
[2:34:22] and say I'm still growing in Christ
[2:34:27] however if you refuse to deal with your
[2:34:29] wounds your whole existence may be
[2:34:31] negatively affected probably leave you
[2:34:33] lame or even making the end marking the
[2:34:35] end of your life as a practicing
[2:34:37] Christian
[2:34:39] some serve unbelief countless years
[2:34:44] before they finally come back to God
[2:34:46] because of the wounding of someone along
[2:34:49] the way or at least at the very least
[2:34:51] driving you out of fellowship with other
[2:34:53] believers leaving you to isolate
[2:34:55] yourself while nursing your trust issues
[2:34:59] but it can affect you positively so much
[2:35:01] so that you re-emerge from your
[2:35:05] crucifixion by Christians
[2:35:08] as a new creature
[2:35:11] as a totally different person
[2:35:15] does anybody need to recover
[2:35:18] okay good let me give you the number one
[2:35:20] step to recovery from being crucified by
[2:35:23] Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[2:35:26] you must number one deal with the person
[2:35:29] who is most responsible for you being
[2:35:32] crucified
[2:35:34] I don't blame you if a name came into
[2:35:36] your mind
[2:35:41] it's very quiet in here
[2:35:44] I didn't come to play
[2:35:47] I don't blame you if a name came to your
[2:35:49] mind I don't blame you if a church came
[2:35:51] to your mind I don't blame you if a
[2:35:52] family member came to your mind
[2:35:56] but I want to encourage you not to look
[2:35:58] too deeply into this natural Realm
[2:36:00] or you'll bog yourself even down deeper
[2:36:03] in emotions that will never lead to
[2:36:05] Deliverance
[2:36:06] but I encourage you rather to look to
[2:36:07] the Realms of the spiritual not men
[2:36:11] it's easier to blame people
[2:36:14] and when we're done blaming people guess
[2:36:16] what the church likes to do are you
[2:36:18] listening
[2:36:19] then the church likes to blame Satan
[2:36:25] we laugh when we hear the expression the
[2:36:27] devil made me do it but it's obvious
[2:36:29] that a lot of people live their life
[2:36:31] thinking that that's why they are who
[2:36:32] they are the devil made them do it it's
[2:36:35] easier to blame one another it's easier
[2:36:37] to blame the enemy than it is to find
[2:36:39] the real source
[2:36:41] who is the one most responsible
[2:36:46] for those hardships that you have been
[2:36:49] through
[2:36:50] perhaps you're going to say you yourself
[2:36:52] that's not true
[2:36:54] because most of us would have never
[2:36:56] chosen
[2:36:58] the situations that we have found
[2:37:00] ourselves in
[2:37:02] I want you to look beyond the names of
[2:37:04] Earthly men and women and the painful
[2:37:06] memories of specific instances that you
[2:37:09] are forced to remember time and time
[2:37:11] again I want you to find out who is the
[2:37:14] one
[2:37:16] who wished This calamity in your life
[2:37:18] who wanted to see you broken
[2:37:21] who wanted to see you beat down finally
[2:37:24] devastated so that you could once and
[2:37:26] for all die
[2:37:29] do you know who he was
[2:37:31] is he really your enemy
[2:37:33] or is he possibly your friend
[2:37:37] alone is the one responsible for the
[2:37:39] crucifixion and persecution of every
[2:37:42] Christian
[2:37:44] yet even the wisest and most spiritual
[2:37:46] are usually in too much pain at the time
[2:37:52] to correctly identify the one who is
[2:37:54] most guilty
[2:37:56] the only way to discover who would do
[2:37:58] such a thing is to go to the scripture
[2:38:00] Luke Chapter 22. oh Jesus help us get
[2:38:04] through these last few minutes
[2:38:06] Luke 22 verse 39 and he came out and
[2:38:09] went as he want to the Mount of Olives
[2:38:11] and his disciples also followed him
[2:38:15] and when he was at the place
[2:38:18] he said unto them verse 40 pray that ye
[2:38:21] enter not into temptation
[2:38:23] and he was withdrawn from them about a
[2:38:26] stone's cast and he kneeled down and
[2:38:28] prayed saying father if thou be willing
[2:38:30] remove his cup from me nevertheless not
[2:38:33] my will but thine be done
[2:38:35] and there appeared an angel unto him
[2:38:37] from Heaven strengthening him and being
[2:38:39] in agony he prayed more earnestly and
[2:38:42] his sweat was as it were great drops of
[2:38:44] blood falling to the ground
[2:38:46] and when he rose up from prayer and was
[2:38:48] come to the disciples he found them
[2:38:50] sleeping for sorrow
[2:38:52] and said unto them why sleepy
[2:38:55] rise and pray lest ye enter into
[2:38:59] temptation how many of you know how that
[2:39:01] turned out
[2:39:03] they slept again
[2:39:05] our Lord was wrestling in the garden
[2:39:11] it is the very first time since his
[2:39:14] expression in the earth that the will of
[2:39:16] the father
[2:39:18] and the will of the Flesh of the son
[2:39:23] had been in conflict with one another
[2:39:27] somebody said how could you say such a
[2:39:29] thing as a one God preacher because I
[2:39:31] understand the expression of the word
[2:39:34] made flesh
[2:39:35] I understand that my savior was filled
[2:39:39] with the eternal spirit of his father
[2:39:42] and yet he lived in a body as a man
[2:39:46] with a mind with a will with emotions
[2:39:50] he said clearly if at all possible let
[2:39:54] this cup pass from me nevertheless
[2:39:59] how could he pray such a thing he said
[2:40:01] my spirit is willing I guess it was his
[2:40:04] Spirit was yielded to the will of the
[2:40:06] father
[2:40:06] but he said my flesh is weak
[2:40:10] there was a Warfare going on there was a
[2:40:13] conflict going on
[2:40:16] I want you to know this morning that if
[2:40:19] Jesus was ever going to fail you
[2:40:22] if he was ever going to give up on you
[2:40:25] it would have been that night in the
[2:40:28] garden of the olive press
[2:40:31] but I'm here to tell you he won the
[2:40:34] victory over his own mind will and
[2:40:36] emotion he won the victory over the
[2:40:39] weakness of his flesh and he said
[2:40:41] nevertheless
[2:40:43] not my will
[2:40:52] foreign
[2:40:53] be done
[2:40:55] it's helpful to remember there's never
[2:40:57] been but one who crucifies
[2:41:00] and one who has been crucified
[2:41:04] when you were broken when you were being
[2:41:06] broken and crucified at the hands of men
[2:41:08] and women in reality you were but
[2:41:11] entering into
[2:41:13] his crucifixion
[2:41:17] consider these circumstances who who
[2:41:19] caused his suffering his Agony his cross
[2:41:22] in all reality it was the very same one
[2:41:25] who plotted and planned
[2:41:28] yours
[2:41:35] who caused him to be placed on trial who
[2:41:38] arranged fault with false witnesses to
[2:41:41] testify against him who chose the men
[2:41:43] who would break his back causing beat
[2:41:45] his back causing rivers of blood to flow
[2:41:48] who selected those soldiers who would
[2:41:50] drive the nails in his hands and feet
[2:41:54] who crucified you
[2:41:58] the same one
[2:42:01] who is responsible for crucifying your
[2:42:04] lord
[2:42:06] if you could ask him
[2:42:08] ask your lord
[2:42:09] who crucified you who caused this pain
[2:42:12] who would have chosen such a harsh and
[2:42:14] seemingly cruel path of humiliation
[2:42:17] suffering and ultimately the explosion
[2:42:20] of your heart
[2:42:25] in the most awful death
[2:42:27] that anyone could have death by drowning
[2:42:30] internally
[2:42:34] the agony and pain
[2:42:37] burst his pericardium
[2:42:40] which caused his heart to enlarge and
[2:42:43] possibly burst itself
[2:42:46] sending the the pericardial fluid
[2:42:49] and the blood
[2:42:51] that's normally pumped by the heart
[2:42:52] loose
[2:42:55] outside of veins and arteries and
[2:42:57] capillaries loose
[2:42:59] through the inner cavities of the body
[2:43:01] so that when that Roman finally put that
[2:43:04] spear in his side it was water and blood
[2:43:06] that ran out it was not urine
[2:43:09] it was the pericardial fluid from the
[2:43:11] explosion of the heart
[2:43:14] brother Branham said it was so much more
[2:43:16] than that
[2:43:18] he said for like Adam
[2:43:21] Christ
[2:43:23] like God reached into Adam and removed
[2:43:25] his bride that day the Branham said that
[2:43:28] day at Calvary God reached in to the
[2:43:31] Christ
[2:43:32] and removed his wife
[2:43:34] removed his bride that's powerful
[2:43:38] that's powerful
[2:43:40] if you were to ask him if you were to
[2:43:42] ask your lord if you were to ask Jesus
[2:43:44] if you were to ask Yeshua the Messiah
[2:43:46] his answer would come soft and
[2:43:48] determined
[2:43:50] it was my father
[2:43:56] it was the father who wanted his son's
[2:43:58] crucifixion
[2:44:01] he even made sure that it would be at
[2:44:03] the hands of other religious men that
[2:44:05] day
[2:44:06] if you refuse to accept your crucifixion
[2:44:10] your persecution your hardships as
[2:44:14] coming totally
[2:44:16] from your father
[2:44:21] if you continue to accuse and point
[2:44:24] fingers at your natural brothers and
[2:44:27] sisters
[2:44:29] if you continually dwell in the valley
[2:44:32] of unforgiveness and grudges and
[2:44:34] vendettas
[2:44:37] then you were not really crucified
[2:44:42] you were only mistreated
[2:44:46] you did not nearly die
[2:44:50] you are still very much alive if you're
[2:44:53] still blaming people
[2:44:56] you are still very much alive if you're
[2:44:59] still blaming preachers
[2:45:02] if you're still blaming churches
[2:45:05] you are still very much alive you were
[2:45:08] only mistreated you have not yet died
[2:45:11] and I have the horrible horrible task of
[2:45:14] telling you your crucifixion has yet to
[2:45:16] come
[2:45:22] being mistreated by others is not nearly
[2:45:24] enough to change us into the image of
[2:45:26] Christ
[2:45:27] it's only by a real crucifixion it's
[2:45:30] only by becoming graveyard dead
[2:45:36] mistreatment makes us bitter
[2:45:39] recognizing the father as the source of
[2:45:42] our crucifixion
[2:45:43] will make us better
[2:45:46] we must embrace the truth he arranged
[2:45:49] every detail the very one who loves you
[2:45:51] more than anyone else could possibly
[2:45:53] love you wanted to see you dead
[2:45:59] your heavenly father
[2:46:03] your Abba
[2:46:06] your papa
[2:46:09] he selected your false Witnesses
[2:46:15] he selected some two witnesses those who
[2:46:18] spread rumors and whispered the truth
[2:46:21] behind your back
[2:46:23] instead of covering your sin
[2:46:27] he scripted the words
[2:46:32] that were hurled at you
[2:46:35] he knew which of those wounds and those
[2:46:38] words would crush you
[2:46:40] and ring in your ears
[2:46:44] for years to come
[2:46:48] I know men and women who tell me today I
[2:46:51] can still hear the voice of my long
[2:46:52] deceased parents saying you're stupid
[2:46:57] you'll never amount to anything
[2:47:01] the circumstances and surroundings of
[2:47:03] your crucifixion were arranged by your
[2:47:06] father and he also ordained the results
[2:47:10] the one who would smash the nails in
[2:47:12] your wrist and the one that rammed that
[2:47:15] still felt spear in your side chosen
[2:47:19] by the one who loves you the most
[2:47:22] for those who were most involved right
[2:47:24] on down to the Casual passerby who
[2:47:26] didn't stop the age you or help you in
[2:47:29] your trouble or pray for you when you
[2:47:31] needed to be in prayer prayed for the
[2:47:33] Lord directed it all the Lord it wasn't
[2:47:36] the Romans that crucified Jesus it
[2:47:38] wasn't the Jews that crucified Jesus it
[2:47:41] was his father before the foundation of
[2:47:45] the world that chose that death
[2:47:48] it could have been salvation by drowning
[2:47:54] but it was salvation by crucifixion the
[2:47:57] most awful death
[2:47:58] that anyone could ever die
[2:48:01] because all the horrors of other deaths
[2:48:05] are combined
[2:48:07] in the Roman
[2:48:09] execution of crucifixion
[2:48:16] all crucifixions bring rejection pain
[2:48:18] unfairness rumor and innuendos
[2:48:21] misunderstanding demeaning belittling
[2:48:23] loss of reputation loss of friends
[2:48:25] everybody's crucifixion
[2:48:29] it hurt everybody
[2:48:32] it didn't feel good for any of us
[2:48:39] but you've got to remember
[2:48:42] in all of this
[2:48:44] this was your father's plan
[2:48:51] it was his will
[2:48:53] for your life
[2:48:55] because the one who knew you best
[2:49:00] knew what would be most effective
[2:49:04] in causing you to turn loose
[2:49:07] of your own will to live as you wanted
[2:49:09] to live
[2:49:12] and live as he had chosen for you to
[2:49:14] live is anybody with me I feel pretty
[2:49:16] alone I feel pretty alone
[2:49:21] this was your father's will for your
[2:49:22] life after he selected all the players
[2:49:24] the accusers the crucifier then he chose
[2:49:27] the victim
[2:49:29] hand-picked you
[2:49:32] there's only one conclusion to come to
[2:49:34] as a True Believer
[2:49:36] you were being honored
[2:49:43] by your father
[2:49:48] he said I will not allow your enemy to
[2:49:53] destroy you
[2:49:56] I'll do it myself
[2:50:00] but I want your flesh dead I want your
[2:50:04] will dead I want your mind your will and
[2:50:07] your emotions dead I don't want you to
[2:50:10] live that old life anymore I want to
[2:50:13] give you a new life
[2:50:17] foreign
[2:50:20] in their right mind would have chosen
[2:50:23] perhaps the life that they've lived or
[2:50:25] the circumstances that they've had
[2:50:28] when we look around we feel like
[2:50:29] everybody in the whole wide world
[2:50:31] sometimes has had it better than we have
[2:50:34] but God knew exactly
[2:50:39] and it was honor and it was not hate and
[2:50:42] it was not spiked
[2:50:46] and maybe you're not there yet
[2:50:49] foreign
[2:50:50] but hopefully soon you and I will be
[2:50:53] able to come to the place
[2:50:55] where instead of blaming the devil for
[2:50:58] everything that has happened in our
[2:51:00] lives because it really just keeps it
[2:51:02] going
[2:51:06] or rather than blaming everyone else
[2:51:10] for what they have put us through
[2:51:13] maybe soon somebody will be able to say
[2:51:15] my loving father
[2:51:18] knew exactly what it was going to take
[2:51:23] to bring me to the place
[2:51:26] that I could be fully adopted
[2:51:28] and exercise the full Authority
[2:51:32] of the wife of Jesus Christ
[2:51:37] it was not an act of hate it was an act
[2:51:39] of love
[2:51:41] this has not happened to punish you
[2:51:44] or to watch you suffer as some Twisted
[2:51:47] entertainment for God
[2:51:50] this has happened to start a magnificent
[2:51:54] transformation in your life
[2:51:57] these hellish events have happened to
[2:51:59] bring you to exactly the place where
[2:52:01] your Lord wants you to be this was an
[2:52:03] act of love
[2:52:07] the purpose of any destruct crucified
[2:52:09] where are you who usually help me so
[2:52:11] much
[2:52:15] the purpose of any crucifixion is to
[2:52:18] destroy there are two kinds of
[2:52:19] Destruction one leads upward
[2:52:22] and one leads downward
[2:52:26] did you not at one time pray in your
[2:52:29] life whatever it takes
[2:52:35] make me just like you
[2:52:43] I did
[2:52:46] then you and I must become a Living
[2:52:49] Sacrifice
[2:52:51] who you really are is revealed during a
[2:52:53] crucifixion
[2:52:56] there's nothing to hide when you are on
[2:52:59] the cross you are naked to all of your
[2:53:03] accusers they see you in your strength
[2:53:06] and they have seen you in your weakness
[2:53:11] everything is revealed about you when
[2:53:14] you're the one on the cross
[2:53:16] some choose not to be restored
[2:53:21] but have rather remained forever wounded
[2:53:24] are you with me a few more minutes I'm
[2:53:26] very very tired
[2:53:28] to embrace this crucifixion is to allow
[2:53:31] the destruction of all that is in you
[2:53:35] which is not like Christ
[2:53:41] you don't hear me
[2:53:46] Lord I want everything
[2:53:49] that is not like you
[2:53:51] out of my life
[2:53:53] then you'd better embrace the stones
[2:53:57] you better embrace the nails
[2:53:59] you better embrace the the crown of
[2:54:02] thorns
[2:54:04] there was one Hill
[2:54:07] Three Crosses
[2:54:09] all three men were crucified
[2:54:12] each showed a different attitude toward
[2:54:14] their death
[2:54:15] one of them stole for a living
[2:54:18] he had been treated harsh many times
[2:54:20] maybe the first time he was caught
[2:54:22] stealing he blamed others
[2:54:24] but on this day of his crucifixion he
[2:54:27] made quite a scene he took no
[2:54:29] responsibility for his actions he blamed
[2:54:32] God in man he had no remorse he only
[2:54:36] wanted to escape had he escaped nothing
[2:54:39] in his life would have changed
[2:54:47] he would have went right back to his
[2:54:50] thieving
[2:54:52] foreign
[2:54:55] he had a great example hanging next to
[2:54:58] him
[2:54:59] on how to be crucified
[2:55:03] and yet he railed
[2:55:05] the second Thief you're with me
[2:55:08] he was also a wicked man blamed everyone
[2:55:10] else railed from the cross cursed his
[2:55:13] champion
[2:55:16] had he been taken down would he have
[2:55:18] been changed
[2:55:20] to escape would have been worse for him
[2:55:25] when you meet him after a while
[2:55:29] he will tell you I'm glad
[2:55:32] for the day that I was crucified
[2:55:36] something changed his attitude
[2:55:39] what was it
[2:55:41] he saw love
[2:55:44] as sister Flo sings he saw the man in
[2:55:47] the middle
[2:55:49] he saw an example of how to live now he
[2:55:53] saw an example of how to die
[2:55:59] he saw the Lord's reactions he heard his
[2:56:02] prayer father forgive he even called out
[2:56:04] to the other Thief
[2:56:07] and tried to get him to hold his peace
[2:56:10] he cried remember me
[2:56:18] folks you make a decision
[2:56:21] which of those thieves you're going to
[2:56:23] be today
[2:56:25] are you going to be the one who blames
[2:56:27] everybody else for their pain
[2:56:32] are you going to be one who says
[2:56:34] remember me
[2:56:37] when you come into your kingdom remember
[2:56:39] me
[2:56:40] because you lived and died I can die and
[2:56:43] live
[2:56:49] three men on crosses
[2:56:53] two when there are thieves one is an
[2:56:55] innocent man
[2:56:59] and when it was all said and done
[2:57:01] an innocent man died to live again
[2:57:05] one Thief died to never live again
[2:57:07] and one Thief became a son
[2:57:14] Jesus died with dignity not even
[2:57:16] answering those who mocked him how could
[2:57:18] he have died in such a manner so calm so
[2:57:21] quiet because of the evening before in
[2:57:23] Gethsemane he didn't make one social
[2:57:26] media post to tell the world he was
[2:57:30] being persecuted
[2:57:35] he just bowed his head
[2:57:41] and die
[2:57:47] surrendered
[2:57:50] if he would have hung there believing in
[2:57:53] his heart that Jews killed him he would
[2:57:55] have railed against his own people
[2:57:58] had he hung there believing that the
[2:58:00] Romans were responsible for his death he
[2:58:03] would have railed against the Romans
[2:58:06] but instead he knew exactly who had
[2:58:09] chosen the path that he had agreed to
[2:58:13] and so he prayed to the one who was
[2:58:16] responsible father
[2:58:21] forgive them
[2:58:24] for they know not what they do
[2:58:31] he had to learn to yield to his father
[2:58:34] his Gethsemane was many years before
[2:58:37] your Gethsemane
[2:58:40] I told you already of the conflict
[2:58:43] in the garden of the olive press
[2:58:46] those other two thieves deserve to be
[2:58:48] punished for their sins
[2:58:50] Barabbas deserved to be punished for his
[2:58:53] sin
[2:58:54] but Jesus did not
[2:58:58] Hebrews 5 8 in closing musicians are
[2:59:01] coming though he were a son
[2:59:06] yet learned he obedience
[2:59:09] by the things which he suffered
[2:59:13] Jesus learned to obey
[2:59:16] the will of the father
[2:59:19] by recognizing the source
[2:59:34] he never complained about his scars
[2:59:39] he didn't spend the rest of his
[2:59:41] existence referring back to his
[2:59:43] crucifixion to his old church to his old
[2:59:46] friends to his old preachers
[2:59:52] foreign
[2:59:56] he just realized
[2:59:58] my death
[3:00:00] was necessary
[3:00:05] I was headed
[3:00:07] down another road
[3:00:10] I had to yield my will
[3:00:19] your father
[3:00:21] is inviting you to a higher order
[3:00:27] to a higher life
[3:00:30] to a higher Realm
[3:00:35] sometimes it's cancer
[3:00:40] sometimes it's loss of
[3:00:43] loved one it's
[3:00:46] grief
[3:00:49] sometimes it's miscarriage
[3:00:55] is painful
[3:00:59] but this is your invitation
[3:01:02] to a higher order
[3:01:06] your loving father wanted you
[3:01:09] to experience the sting
[3:01:13] so that you might see the dark side
[3:01:17] of your own reaction
[3:01:20] because sometimes we think we're dead
[3:01:24] when we are very very very much alive
[3:01:30] let someone mistreat us let someone
[3:01:32] mishandle us let someone take advantage
[3:01:36] of us and let's see how dead we are then
[3:01:41] let our eyes become open to the reality
[3:01:44] of of what we have yielded ourselves to
[3:01:48] see then if we are dead or if we are
[3:01:51] very much alive
[3:01:53] but I want to tell you Jesus now lives
[3:01:55] on the other side of Resurrection on the
[3:01:58] other side of crucifixion
[3:02:00] so that you and I can live
[3:02:03] by the power of His
[3:02:05] Resurrection
[3:02:08] my last verse
[3:02:10] second Corinthians 4 17 for our light
[3:02:16] momentary affliction
[3:02:24] it's quiet in this church
[3:02:27] this slight distress of the passing hour
[3:02:34] is ever
[3:02:36] I'm reading in the Amplified I'm sorry
[3:02:39] I forgot to mark it as Amplified
[3:02:42] for our light momentary Affliction this
[3:02:45] slight distress of the passing hour is
[3:02:48] ever more and more abundantly preparing
[3:02:51] and producing and achieving for us an
[3:02:54] everlasting weight of Glory
[3:02:57] beyond all measure excessively
[3:02:59] surpassing all comparisons and all
[3:03:01] calculations
[3:03:03] a vast and Transcendent Glory
[3:03:07] and blessedness
[3:03:12] never
[3:03:14] to cease
[3:03:21] how is it
[3:03:23] that our father
[3:03:25] could choose such a death for us
[3:03:29] because he saw the other side
[3:03:35] he saw the resurrection
[3:03:38] he saw the ascended life
[3:03:51] it is the truth
[3:04:09] foreign
[3:04:22] when I was in North Carolina
[3:04:26] I told a little story that I've told you
[3:04:28] before
[3:04:31] and brother Danny Adams the pastor sent
[3:04:33] me a few days ago
[3:04:35] one of the tellings of this story I'm
[3:04:38] going to read it to you quickly would
[3:04:39] you stand
[3:04:43] foreign
[3:04:53] two young moravians
[3:04:56] heard of an island in the West Indies
[3:05:00] were an atheist British owner
[3:05:03] had somewhere between two thousand and
[3:05:06] three thousand African slaves
[3:05:09] and the owner had said no preacher no
[3:05:12] clergyman will ever stay on this island
[3:05:16] if his Shipwrecked we'll keep him in a
[3:05:19] separate house until he has to leave but
[3:05:22] he's never going to talk to any of us
[3:05:25] about God I'm through with all that
[3:05:27] nonsense
[3:05:29] 3 000 slaves from the jungles of Africa
[3:05:32] brought to an island in the Atlantic and
[3:05:35] there to live and die without ever
[3:05:38] hearing of Christ
[3:05:41] several thousand black slaves toiled in
[3:05:44] the sugar cane Fields under the burning
[3:05:46] Sun three thousand slaves were doomed to
[3:05:49] live and die
[3:05:51] without ever hearing of Christ
[3:05:57] in their 20s
[3:05:59] from the Moravian sect
[3:06:03] if you study history you'll find that
[3:06:05] the moravians were led by a wealthy man
[3:06:08] who had given his life to Jesus his name
[3:06:10] was count Von zinsendorf
[3:06:16] he hosted
[3:06:17] a prayer meeting that lasted over 100
[3:06:20] years
[3:06:24] two young Germans heard
[3:06:28] about the plight
[3:06:31] of these three thousand slaves that were
[3:06:34] serving a master
[3:06:36] who refused to allow anyone to tell them
[3:06:39] about God
[3:06:42] so they sold themselves
[3:06:45] to a British planter
[3:06:49] for the standard price
[3:06:51] for a male slave
[3:06:54] the Moravian Community from hernhut
[3:06:58] came to see the two Lads off
[3:07:01] who would never return again
[3:07:04] having freely sold themselves into a
[3:07:08] lifetime of slavery
[3:07:11] as a member of the slave Community they
[3:07:14] would witness as Christians
[3:07:17] to the love of God
[3:07:20] family members were emotional they were
[3:07:23] weeping
[3:07:25] they were wondering was their extreme
[3:07:28] sacrifice wise
[3:07:31] was it necessary
[3:07:36] the housings had been cast off and were
[3:07:39] curled up on the pier
[3:07:40] as the ship Slipped Away
[3:07:43] with the tide the Gap widened
[3:07:49] the young man linked arms
[3:07:51] raised their hands
[3:07:54] and shouted across the spreading Gap
[3:07:59] May the lamb
[3:08:02] that was slain
[3:08:04] receive the reward
[3:08:07] for his suffering
[3:08:14] this became the call of the Moravian
[3:08:16] Brothers
[3:08:18] and their missions to the world
[3:08:21] and this should be our only reason for
[3:08:23] being
[3:08:28] if you knew this morning this afternoon
[3:08:32] that your crucifixion your persecution
[3:08:36] your hardship
[3:08:39] was not for hate
[3:08:42] but for love
[3:08:46] wouldn't you be able to say
[3:08:51] if it was so that the lamb
[3:08:54] could receive the reward
[3:08:57] for his suffering
[3:09:01] wouldn't you be able to say it's worth
[3:09:03] it all
[3:09:04] to be his child
[3:09:09] wouldn't you Church
[3:09:14] if you could realize
[3:09:16] that it was chosen for you of your
[3:09:18] father
[3:09:21] not because he despised you
[3:09:24] he wanted you to be
[3:09:28] just like him
[3:09:35] if you could know
[3:09:37] that in the end of this life
[3:09:39] what you have suffered what you have
[3:09:42] walked through
[3:09:43] was pulling you into the crucifixion and
[3:09:46] the death of Christ so that you could
[3:09:48] also share his resurrection eternal life
[3:09:51] wouldn't you scream out it's worth it
[3:09:55] it's worth it it's worth it it's worth
[3:09:57] it
[3:09:58] if you find yourself here today still
[3:10:01] blaming the devil
[3:10:03] if you find yourself here today still
[3:10:06] blaming somebody else
[3:10:09] for your pain
[3:10:13] if you're not yet willing or have not
[3:10:15] yet been willing to understand that it
[3:10:17] was all a part of your father's plan to
[3:10:20] bring you to his image
[3:10:24] I invite you today don't leave these
[3:10:28] grounds
[3:10:30] until you settle this in your heart
[3:10:33] until you are able to say father
[3:10:38] I may not understand it all
[3:10:44] but like brother Josh Alano
[3:10:47] around the altar this morning I will say
[3:10:51] Lord I trust you
[3:11:04] if you are one who has struggled
[3:11:08] by pointing the finger at others
[3:11:14] because you were not yet emotionally
[3:11:16] ready to
[3:11:17] comprehend
[3:11:20] that it was really the one who loved you
[3:11:22] the most
[3:11:25] I want you to come and stand
[3:11:28] and I want you to tell your father
[3:11:31] Lord I trust you
[3:11:34] Papa I trust you
[3:11:37] I may not understand it all
[3:11:41] but I trust you
[3:11:44] and may I just say again none of us
[3:11:48] are getting off
[3:11:51] foreign
[3:11:52] words
[3:11:56] for the stones that we have thrown or
[3:11:59] the spears that we have hurled at one
[3:12:01] another we are not getting off
[3:12:06] it's better for us that a millstone
[3:12:10] we're tied around our neck and we were
[3:12:12] drowned in the depths of the sea than to
[3:12:15] be responsible for hindering one of
[3:12:17] God's little ones
[3:12:21] but the truth is
[3:12:24] that what the enemy meant for evil
[3:12:27] and he is out for you
[3:12:29] he wants to so destroy you that you'll
[3:12:32] never call on God
[3:12:36] he wants to see you dead for an entirely
[3:12:38] different reason
[3:12:40] your father wants to see you die
[3:12:44] so that he can come and live in your
[3:12:46] body
[3:12:47] and manifest who he is
[3:12:50] let's worship before we pray
[3:12:55] above all powers
[3:13:01] above all Kings
[3:13:06] of all nature and all created things
[3:13:15] [Music]
[3:13:19] and all the ways of men
[3:13:24] [Music]
[3:13:27] you were here before the world began
[3:13:35] of all kingdoms
[3:13:39] of all Thrones
[3:13:44] of all wonders this world has ever known
[3:13:53] above all well
[3:13:56] and Treasures of the Earth
[3:14:01] [Music]
[3:14:04] there's no way to measure what you're
[3:14:08] over
[3:14:09] [Music]
[3:14:30] like a rose
[3:14:33] trampled on the ground
[3:14:38] you took the fall
[3:14:42] and you thought of me
[3:14:48] above all oh
[3:14:51] [Music]
[3:14:54] crucified
[3:14:56] you were laid behind the snow
[3:15:00] [Music]
[3:15:03] you live to die
[3:15:06] rejected
[3:15:13] trampled on the ground
[3:15:18] [Music]
[3:15:22] and you thought of me
[3:15:27] above all
[3:15:30] [Music]
[3:15:31] powers
[3:15:35] of all Kings
[3:15:40] above all nature and all creating things
[3:15:49] above all wisdom and all the ways
[3:15:56] [Music]
[3:16:05] [Music]
[3:16:11] above all Thrones
[3:16:14] [Music]
[3:16:17] there's the world has ever known
[3:16:23] [Music]
[3:16:27] its Treasures of the Earth
[3:16:32] [Music]
[3:16:52] to die rejected
[3:16:55] [Music]
[3:17:11] me
[3:17:14] [Music]
[3:17:20] crucified
[3:17:21] [Music]
[3:17:24] hey
[3:17:30] rejected
[3:17:33] [Music]
[3:17:48] in your thoughts
[3:17:54] above all
[3:17:56] the only way
[3:17:59] that you could hold a grudge
[3:18:03] against God almighty
[3:18:07] for the life that you
[3:18:09] have lived
[3:18:11] for the things that you have endured
[3:18:15] is if you don't trust him
[3:18:19] one of the greatest benefits
[3:18:23] of seeing this message
[3:18:26] and the sovereignty of God
[3:18:30] is it helps us
[3:18:33] to trust our Papa
[3:18:37] to know that he is a good good father
[3:18:45] he will heal you
[3:18:47] he will restore you
[3:18:50] he will help you turn loose
[3:18:53] of your unforgiveness
[3:18:56] he will deliver you from bitterness
[3:19:00] he will heal you emotionally
[3:19:04] he will heal you physically for the
[3:19:07] effect that it has had on your body
[3:19:10] and he'll bring you to his resurrection
[3:19:12] life
[3:19:14] if you can but trust him
[3:19:19] and I know some are struggling this
[3:19:21] morning
[3:19:22] it's hard
[3:19:24] sometimes people say it's hard
[3:19:27] to serve a God the love of God
[3:19:30] who would not only allow such things
[3:19:35] seemingly orchestrate them
[3:19:38] [Music]
[3:19:41] but we have to trust him
[3:19:43] he knows
[3:19:46] he he was
[3:19:49] [Music]
[3:19:56] wrote
[3:19:59] to die rejected

[3:20:08] trampled on the ground
[3:20:17] then you thought of me
[3:20:21] [Music]
[3:20:28] crucified
[3:20:30] you will leave behind the stone you
[3:20:37] to die I rejected
[3:20:42] [Music]
[3:20:55] and you thought of me
[3:20:59] [Music]

[3:22:34] in the natural
[3:22:37] you have to catch it by the spirit you
[3:22:40] have to receive it by a revelation

[3:31:31] that I have caused
[3:31:34] such pain
[3:31:38] it breaks my heart to know
[3:31:42] that I have
[3:31:44] crucified other Christians
[3:31:47] with my words with my attitudes
[3:31:51] with my poor leadership through the
