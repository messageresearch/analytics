look like my battle but the battle's heavy and we want to pray one for another but we want to pray especially for our pastor because of the anointing that he carries because of the giftings that are in his life and you know sometimes it may look like that it's it's a rosy job but it's a battlefield it's it is a battlefield again we welcome you into the house of the lord this brother on the back there i don't recognize you but i'm glad that you're here in the house of the lord today the lord bless you uh i believe this brother over here is jose is that right that yeah okay you have your two daughters with you today we're glad that you're here in the house of the lord uh we just honor that and we're so glad that you come back among us my sister doris is here uh for a few days a couple days a couple weeks i don't know however long the lord would lead and uh so we're praying for megan that this baby will come in god's time and that it'll come with ease it will not be a long delivery ephesians chapter 5 i have a very strange subject this morning and i'm just depending on the lord completely verse 22 ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word and you may have your seats today we have come to understand through a prophet messenger he told us that the book of ephesians parallels the book of joshua when we think about the book of joshua we think about when god finished with moses ministry and he laid the burden upon joshua to take the children of israel into their promised land now the land was promised to them many years before but they had not yet acquired the promise but the promise was about to be theirs but the promise was not going to be theirs without fighting for it when moses was sent to lead god's people out of egypt's bondage moses did not know that he was going to have a battle on his hands to get the people to believe him as a prophet to believe him as a deliverer moses did not choose the job that god gave to him god laid that upon moses and when he laid it upon moses he laid it upon him without moses's natural abilities now all that moses went through to get to that point of being the deliverer god used those things to help him to have some understanding but god had to rip some things out of him before he was fully equipped to go in and be able to lead god's people out of that bondage so god sets up this scenario where that moses recognizes who he is he recognizes that there is some injustice that is going on amongst the hebrew people he goes down among them he decides he's going to get right down in the dirt with them and he lays aside all of his garments of egypt and he gets right down in the dirt with them and he begins to work alongside them and he sees the injustice and he becomes angry with what he sees and he decides that he was going to kill one of the egyptian task masters and bury him in the sand then the scripture tells us that the next day he's working and there's the hebrew brothers that are quarreling and moses tries to break up the fight and they say what are you going to do the same thing to us and moses realizes that he's found out and he flees for his life and god takes him on the backside of the desert where he meets the pillar of fire and there is a long period of time it doesn't make sense in our minds that that god would at 40 years old take moses out of egypt and begin to strip him of all of egypt to strip him of everything that he ever was and begin to reveal to him what he's been called to and it takes another 40 years for him to get ready to go into egypt and to lead god's people out and god gets him ready moses meets the pillar of fire and he sees that he has got to go and lead god's children out of this uh egypt land and so he does that and we know all the sequence of events how that they were up against the red sea and then god opens up the red sea and god takes them across and we've been hearing how that uh here brother shelley has been preaching how that when spies were sent into that land uh to scope it out how that some of them came back with uh an idea in their mind they had an imagination that these people were were that they were all giants and we're grasshoppers in in in in front of them and and they had this perception of what they were and so then god had to begin to strip out of them god had to strip out of them all of their conceptions of what they were some people are too proud and some people are too defeated we need a middle of the road where that we know who we are in christ jesus so god through 40 years of of wandering around in the wilderness god strips uh all of that uh uh pride and he strips all of that uh idea that i can't do anything i'm just a grasshopper in the sight of these giants he strips all of that away from them and all of the men of war they die out that have that generation and god gets them ready now we know that moses had an authority with god that was so beautiful but the people made him mad moses got upset with the people and when he got upset with the people god told him when the people needed water the rock had already been smitten once god told moses speak to the rock but moses in his anger in his frustration with the people and i have no rocks to throw at moses because we have all been in that kind of a fix where the people upset us they made us mad they made us angry and we did things that we weren't supposed to but in this case because of the authority that moses had because of the calling that was in his life and he was standing before the people rather than speak to the rock he took his rod and he smote the rock the second time and this was not to be so he was supposed to speak to the rock for the water to come out because of this god came to moses and told him you will not lead the people into that land i am going to raise up i've raised up joshua and the anointing that uh to lead this people is going to be placed upon joshua we have been told that the that our joshua is the holy ghost he is to lead us moses my servant is dead now joshua i'm laying this commission over on you this is now uh the holy ghost leading his many membered bride into their promised land joshua in the natural was given the commission to take the people of god into their promised land now this promised land was already theirs it was a promise it was an inheritance but it was not yet in their hand they had not yet experienced the reality of it and so god in his infinite wisdom he gives joshua instruction to go in and to conquer this land piece by piece in conquering this land the people had to be subject to their joshua joshua the son of none they had to listen to what joshua instructed them now we know that when they went to jericho god gave victory but there was a battle because someone got it in their mind that they did not want to listen to the instruction of joshua they decided that joshua was not handling things maybe fast enough or maybe this guy thought that he was not getting enough credit or he wasn't getting enough pay for his services we don't really know what was in his mind but the bible tells us that they went to battle and they lost men and this was not what they were used to be happening they were going to battles and not losing anybody now they went to a battle at ai and they lost men this was because there was a man among them that was not satisfied to be in his position in his calling that he was called for and he decided i'm not getting proper pay here i i need a little more spending money and he took these things now the funny thing is when he took them he hid them he did he didn't even have the he didn't even have the joy of spending them because he had to hide them because he knew he was a guilty man and when he hid these things and and these the the they realize that there's trouble in this camp we have got an issue here that we've got to deal with we should not have lost men so they begin to cast lots and it comes down to aiken and he makes his admission of what he did and he was dealt with in such a way that uh it would cause people not to want to do anything like that again but as they're taking this land god has given it to them piece by piece you remember he said i can't give it to you all at one time because if i give it to you all at one time there's not enough of you to occupy it there's not there's not enough of you to occupy the land and if you don't occupy the land then there are going to be some others that are going to come in and they're going to try to usurp authority on that that you cannot watch over and protect okay so god gives them the land little by little and as he is giving them the land they're conquering one city after another and they're inhabiting the land as god gives them victory now this is the way it is with the people of god we start out with our salvation experience and we know that it's the goodness of god that he would give us eternal life that he would come to us with salvation to be able to call on the name of the lord the bible tells us the man that calls on the name of the lord shall be saved and this is just simple gospel whosoever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved but that man hasn't conquered any ground he has done one little thing and that is he's called on the name of the lord now this is the beginnings but god wants to lead him further in that experience he wants to give him more of himself and so he beckons to him and he says repent i cannot explain all of the mystery to you but i know that there are people through the years that god has shown mercy to that lived wickedly all of their lives and at the last moment they called on the lord i don't know what their words were but i know that god is rich in mercy and he knows how to grant mercy and he knows all of the the whole total of a man every path that he ever went through and and every hard trial that he went through things that might look easy to us but to them it might look difficult and so it is not our job to try to judge a man in the path that he is walking in but it's our job to pray for one another and to ask the lord to give grace and strength and help to each of our fellow brothers and sisters in the place that they are so that you can be led by the spirit of god as you're walking this journey then the holy spirit if if you call on the name of the lord and if there's something in you that you want to walk further with him then he beckons to you repents do a turnaround get rid of all of that that you've carried for so long all of the sin the weights the things that beset you the unbelief i'm still getting rid of my unbelief still working i'm still taking the land by my joshua the holy ghost because he abides in me he's giving me the grace and he's giving me the leadership to be able to conquer the the amalekites and the hittites and the hivites to defeat all of them all of them in my life and it starts out with repentance because what i repent of today is i'm repenting of everything that i can see there are still things in you and in me that i cannot yet see but there will come a time when the holy spirit will take me deeper into the land and he will beckon to me repent it's another giant another hittite another amalekite remember little amalekites grow up to be big amalekites and there are some of us sitting here today that god called on us once upon a time to kill a little amalekite and we didn't do it whether out of rebellion or selfishness or whatever it may have been and that little amalekite has become a big amalekite and the holy spirit is now beckoning us it's time to repent he is once again pointing out the malachite in our life kill it kill it that seems so brutal brutal when god gave joshua instruction you go in the land and you kill them all don't spare one of them don't you spare the little children not the mamas not the daddies not the old men not the old women you kill them all now in our in our 2022 mentality this seems so cruel it seems so wicked it seems uh such that why would god do such as that because god already saw that those amalekites whether they were little they would grow up to be big ones and i don't care how embedded they are into the israelite camp there was an amalekite nature inside of them that was in their dna and it would in some way manifest along the way and and somewhere that that that spirit would come out so god said wipe them out and possess the land wherever the soles of your feet go it's yours now let's come back to the book of ephesians wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the lord now i don't want to dwell a long time on this but submitting is a level of trust to the man that god called to be your husband speaking to wives it takes a level of trust for a woman to trust her husband this is why that we as preachers and parents have stressed to our young people not to be unequally yoked with an unbeliever because when you are unequally yoked with an unbeliever and that man that you chose and you went away from the lord and you chose him and he chose you and and you have decided as a woman to continue following the lord but you have a man that doesn't want to follow the lord then it becomes an issue for that wife to submit herself to that man as unto the lord because he doesn't follow the lord she doesn't trust him especially when it comes to spiritual decisions she doesn't trust him so once again i speak to the young folks that are not yet married you be careful and you seek the lord with everything that is within you and you make sure that you have the baptism of the holy ghost and you make sure that that one that you choose has the baptism of the holy ghost not just speaking in tongues the real genuine baptism of the holy ghost that continues to guide that person into all truth because there are there there are again as god led the children of israel into that promised land they took the ground piece by piece they did not take the land all at one time they took it piece by piece and there are some who go so far and they quit they say i have the baptism of the holy ghost but they never let the spirit of god lead them any farther than that initial experience but we've got to go beyond that initial experience that first experience and we've got to keep walking taking the land taking the land taking the land taking the land so the wives paul is speaking to the ephesian church submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the lord now the scripture tells us concerning wives in the book of titus it talks about the aged men being sober grave temperate sound in faith and charity and patience this is titus chapter 2 the aged women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women all right older women here's your job that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children now older men you have been given the job to be sober honest temperate or to have self-control sound in faith in charity and patience and the aged women are supposed to be in behavior as becometh holiness because you are teaching the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children so if you hate your husband don't teach all right to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands didn't get no husband amen there that the word of god be not blasphemed young men likewise exhort to be sober minded now i just want to touch on this keepers at home now i am a man who believes that a woman a married woman especially with children should not have a job out in the marketplace i realize that we live in 2022 so don't throw rocks at me i'm just old-fashioned i am thankful that god made a way that my wife could be in the home now i want to take this word keepers because i am not going to let the wives the mothers get out of this part of it because it is very very important a job that god has given you your mothers women you have been given a job to be keepers at home now we could turn this word into you should be a homemaker a woman's job is to be in the kitchen i'm not going to go there today i'm glad my wife is home when i get home most of the time but i want you to look at this word keepers at home in a different light because this is the same word that is used in the book of genesis when god told the man that he was to keep the land the garden of eden and then this same word is in genesis i believe 3 maybe 16 somewhere around there when when uh the uh cherubim were put at the gate after the man and the woman were kicked out of the garden to keep the way to the tree of life they were that the cherry beans were to guard the way to the tree of life women young women are to be keepers at home you have a job to guard the gate you have a job as women to guard the gate of your home of your children the man called out into the workforce is not there all the time the woman there to guard or to keep the home to watch things that are coming in this is not solely the husband's responsibility now the husband is the head of the household but the woman is to guard at home because every which way you turn the enemy is looking for a way to get to your husband you your children the enemy is looking for a way to get to you because he wants to destroy the family structure so the woman is to guard i don't know how closely you've ever looked at proverbs 31 but it appears that that proverbs 31 woman was not an idol woman but she looked well to the ways of her house she watched over it her candle burned in the night time she was careful to make sure she did business she saw oversaw business transactions she was an active woman now i don't know at what point she became this active but when you have small children in the house as the children are growing up it is important for you as women young women mothers for you to watch over and protect to guard to keep at home to guard what is coming because like a roaring lion the enemy is coming to see who he can devour and mamas and daddies if he can't devour you he will try to devour your children and this is why it is so important for the moms the the young women the the mothers to be watchers to be keepers it's not just the men that are watchers in the home it is the women as well to guard and to keep the home and so women when you submit yourself to your own husband this is a starting point of guarding the house submitting to your husband as unto the lord so as you submit to your husband then you recognize that he is under leadership now i'm speaking to believers here a a husband that is serving the lord and trying with everything in him to to serve the lord with uh the spirit of god in him the woman the wife realizes that he is under the leadership of the holy spirit and so she wants to subject herself to her husband in everything now verse 25 husbands love your wives husbands love your wife now we can go back to the book of genesis we can see how that all of this came about we can see that there was sin in the garden that god said that man would rule over the women it would rule over the wife and that was not just so that he could carry a rod of iron and beat her on the head it was to be a covering for her remember when eve opened up the woman really she did not have a name until after the fall the woman opened up her mind she opened up the womb of her mind and she allowed the words the enemy to come into her mind and then it became an act and then the man realizing what had happened he went in with eyes wide open and he covered her and god told the man that he would rule over the woman over the woman now i am not trying to stir up any trouble with men or with women i'm trying to let you know that god has an order and when we get out of god's order then our lives become chaos we need to stay in god's divine order so the woman was put under the headship of the man but now the husband has been given a an instruction to love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now i just want to stop because he said husbands love your wives now what would that look like i don't know where else to go to except for first corinthians chapter 13. and find out the um what love really looks like the attributes of love so in verses 4 through 8 of chapter 13 we can see that love suffers long so any of us short fused husbands we got to work on that because love suffers long love is kind now when a man begins to beat on his wife because she did not do something the way that he wanted her to then there is a problem the husband is no longer loving the wife as christ loved the church all right so the king james uses the word charity which means love charity suffers long charity is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself this is not a word that we typically use in 2022 unless you speak shakespeare english to vaught means to boast oneself it means to self-display employing rhetorical embellishments in praising oneself excessively so there's just some definition for vaunteth not itself any man that needs to constantly be boasting about who he is you need to work on it charity is not puffed up see pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall and when we as a husband as a man now this really goes for everybody this is not man exclusive here all right when we talk about love and not being puffed up pride is a problem with all of us we can be so proud and puffed up and exert ourselves in front of everybody to try to display who we are and do you know that there's a pride in people to see how nasty they can be it goes from top all the way to the gutter pride works in so many ways that we don't see sometimes and god it takes the holy spirit as he's leading us into our land of promise it takes the holy spirit to point it out to us so that we do not become puffed up because we can be one who is out in the forefront all the time and constantly puffing up our chest to say who we are or it can be somebody that stays down and and they they're so proud of how humble they are charity does not behave itself unseemingly does not seek her own charity is not easily provoked well let's stop there a second because sometimes sometimes we become easily provoked fathers are to be men who do not provoke their children to anger and when our children do things that we don't like so many times depending on where we are what stresses we find out in our lives we react from that provocation of our children or a wife how do you think men become wife beaters they're easily provoked and it doesn't take anything to set them off men this is why we need the baptism of the holy ghost and we need a refilling on a refilling on a refilling because there are stresses of life that we do not need to allow to easily provoke us is not easily provoked thinketh no evil what are you doing preacher i'm talking about husbands loving their wives these are all the attributes that paul spoke in first corinthians church 13. thinketh no evil when a man begins to think that his wife is cheating on him he begins to think evil of her little signs he says that she is stepping out maybe now this can go either way and go either way i'm talking about husbands loving their wives as christ loved the church we live in a society where that there is a lack of commitment and what is that place ikea is that the name of that place the throwaway furniture that's about how marriages have come you know i don't like this one i'll throw it out and i'll go to ikea and i'll get me another one it's cheap and see this is the reason why people don't marry anymore they shack up but god instituted marriage one man one woman can i preach that here one man one woman is a marriage in holy matrimony i believe it ought to be with a minister of the gospel pronouncing in the name of the lord jesus christ god instituted this marriage because he was trying to show a picture in the end time let me read the rest of these concerning love thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never fails husbands love your wives ephesians 5 26 5 5 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word now what i want us to see today is this great mystery that god is trying to has been trying to unfold in the in the body of believers down through time he is trying to show by a man and a woman in a marriage he is trying to show a great mystery he said this is a great mystery referring to marriage but i speak concerning christ and the church this is a marriage that god is trying to uh bring about in the end time for the people of god to recognize that wives need to be in subject to their own husbands not to a denominational hierarchy not to an organized religion but a believer is subject to christ and god has put in divine order in the church apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists the five-fold ministry he put in the church for the end time and why did he do it for the perfecting of the saints he used he uses imperfect vessels to bring about a perfecting in the body of christ and it was because that he the headship brought it down into the earth to bring about all of what we're seeing now but he's speaking concerning christ and the church and he says for husbands to love their wives even as christ loved the church he's trying to demonstrate to us in an earthly way with husbands and wives families he's trying to demonstrate something that is a continual revelation or a great mystery he is trying to demonstrate what a genuine god-built marriage looks like and it is imperative that everybody is in their correct role when world war ii started and the men went off to war there was nobody in the factories but they needed some labor in the factories the men were overseas fighting the women went to work when the women went to work the war was over the men came back home the women did not want to give up that position in the workforce don't get mad at me god has a divine order and i know this is 2022. but i speak concerning christ in the church because as we see in the way of the natural so goes the spiritual because when the women i'm not don't don't throw rocks at me giving you history when the women went into the workforce and the men came home they did not want to give up that position so you either had both of them working or the man became dad mom stayed at the house cook the meals whatever because the women liked the authority that they had they liked the paycheck that they got nothing against that and the way that the enemy has pushed society it nearly takes both for a living in these days unless you choose to live really simply and most don't want to live really simply so now the women are after world war ii the women are in the workforce and they don't want to come back into the role of homemaker and so it just got worse and worse and worse now as this progressed i know this is going to sound like i'm bashing women but i'm really not i'm trying to explain to you concerning christ and the church and the place that a husband has and a place that a wife has the bride of christ has a position she has a position and that position is not to be some little push down push over this woman is called to be a keeper of the home to guard and protect you sitting every one of you sitting here today me included you that are watching this stream a believer when you come into this house you have a a job to be a keeper at home now again there there's an authority god placed a pastor in a position over the body but all of us are to be watchmen on the wall you may not have authority to speak into every person's life in this building but god gave you an authority over your own household and your life that you need to be a keeper you need to watch and guard it with everything that's within you so now the women are outside of in the workforce and they're not accomplishing their god-given role their order in the home and now the children start becoming delinquent because mama isn't guarding the whole i'm trying to put it in bible perspective here so as goes the world so goes the church now i am a preacher who believes that women do not have a calling behind the pulpit now can have your own opinion but i want you to look at the united methodist church and as the women have come in and been given the authority as pastors see god placed something in a woman in a woman that's sacred very sacred and there's there's there's something in her that has a tenderness a an ability to love people and and that's why a mama can love her children no matter how bad they are you understand what i'm saying so when she is placed in a place of authority behind a pulpit and she starts seeing sin in the people and she wants to be real careful how she tiptoes around that because of what has been placed inside of her this tenderness you know we we want to love our children we we want to make sure that they know they're a part of the family but this is how sin creeps in the door of the church because somebody's out of their position they're not in a rightful position and they begin to get soft on sin and then we start legalizing gay marriage and then we start legalizing this and legalizing and then it comes into the church and that is why there has to be an absolute there has to be an absolute and if we don't abide by the absolute then we find ourselves out of god's order and we're straying off of the path and god cannot continue to reveal the mystery to us because we've gone off into some pagan practice somewhere some kind of illicit behavior because things got out of order god gave away for a parent to correct their child he placed an authority in their hands called the rod of correction god placed an authority we can read it in the book of romans god gave an authority to the governing body and a law is put in place and if you disobey that law in the book of romans it talks about a sword but there's a way for that law to be brought back into a a law breaker to be brought back into a place of abiding by the law or go to jail god gave the body of christ a way to bring his authority into the earth and that was when he asked peter and the disciples who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say you're elias some say you're john the baptist some say this some say that but who do you say that i am thou art the christ the son of the living god and then he goes on to give the keys to peter and he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven we know that really that should read whatever's already been bound on the abound in heaven you're going to bring it to earth that's what we want we're not trying to manipulate heaven we're trying to bring what is happening in the heavenlies down to earth we have been given an authority in the earth to bring what god has already said into the earth because he's trying to display his character his attributes and he's trying to help you to see that he loved so much that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish as i said a couple weeks ago i like the way kent maddox said it so some years ago god loves you just the way you are but he loves you too much to leave you there he loves you too much to leave you in the condition that you are so he made a way for you and he is pouring that way out on you demonstrating through good marriages listen to me he is demonstrating through good marriages how that a husband would love a wife a husband that is not easily provoked a husband that doesn't have to always be right a husband that doesn't have to puff himself up all the time to show what a great guy he is demonstrating through a marriage this great mystery concerning christ and the church that he would love so much that he would come into the earth that he did not remain far removed from god's people but he came as a human being to demonstrate his love to us in that while we were yet sinners he died for the ungodly and so when he died for the ungodly we did not yet know him but he already died for us because he was demonstrating his love for us he did not die for you and just hope that you got it but in this passage of scripture he's telling the husbands to love their wives and the wives to submit to their husbands he's using the natural marriage to demonstrate and a heavenly pattern he's using marriage to demonstrate that husbands don't always have to be right they don't have to puff themselves up they don't have to uh put themselves in such a way where they think that everything has got to be about them now you can say it's all about jesus and then he'll turn around and say it's all about the bride he has a he has a beautiful demonstration that he wants to give to his people so that she recognizes that she is in her proper place under the headship and when the woman in the home gets out of her place when she gets out of her place and she tries to usurp the authority then we have a problem see we can go back to the old testament and we can talk about how that you have the breaking down of will the breaking down of society the breaking down of a strong leader until you get to an ahab he wasn't the first bad one there were some before him solomon had already started taking women into his life and then there were bad kings after him but then we got to ahab and ahab was bad he was bad enough by himself then it says that ahab went to another country and he chose him a jezebel and because she was a woman who was out of her divine order when she came into the kingdom of israel with ahab because ahab was already a man who would not stand up against sin he was not a he was ahab was the king but he would not stand for righteousness and truth and godliness in his kingdom so when he chose jezebel to come alongside of him she was not willing just to be quiet queen she wanted to run the country and we know that she ran the country she was the neck that turned the head and when he didn't turn fast enough she went a little higher do i need to remind you about nabal's vineyard because naboth was a man who said this is my inheritance and you can't have it i don't care if you are the king no i'm not trading ground with you this is my ground and so uh ahab pouty ahab goes back to his bed and cries the blues because that he can't have nabos vineyard which the bible says was right next to ahab's house jezebel comes in and starts patting him what's the matter baby what's the matter with you why are you crying nate balls won't let me have his vineyard you just stay right there and cry a while longer i'll handle things for you out of god's divine order ahab was the man that was the trouble husbands love your wives even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but at that should be holy and without blemish i said this some time ago i heard another preacher say it husbands you don't like what you get out of your wife your fault because you don't love them the way christ loved the church he said he loved the church and gave himself for it so that he could sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so that he could present it to himself a glorious church husbands love your wives as christ loved the church wives submit to your own husbands as unto the lord church submit under the authority that god placed in your midst pastor submit under the lordship of jesus christ and i believe that he does i believe that he is submitting himself under the headship the leadership of the holy ghost and everything has to be in god's divine order this is what this is about god's divine order this is not just good marriages and husbands and what this is about god's divine order because god does everything in order god is not a god of chaos so we've heard preached around here back in in the book of genesis when everything looked uh null it looked void it looked dark and that's not the way god creates things god is a creator of perfection he's meticulous in everything that he does he's a god of order and as he presents he puts things in divine order then he brought it in after he after things were made and he had this man and then the woman he wanted them to be in divine order and from the very beginning he puts things in this divine order but then the enemy wants to shift things out of order because as long as the enemy can get things out of order and he can keep chaos in your heart and in your mind then you are not allowing this continual mystery this great mystery or this continual revelation you are not allowing it to come to its full and complete picture but by the power of the holy ghost you see when god gives you the holy ghost he gives you the holy ghost to guide you into all truth he wants truth to be at the forefront of everything that you do he does not want you to go off into error so he puts truth right in your path he still gives you as a human being with free choice he gives you the opportunity to make the choice do i want this as my truth i don't care what your truth is there is truth jesus is the way and the truth and the life so as he puts truth in front of you he gives you a choice to choose truth or to be out of order there's i mean there's only two ways about it or disorder so then as you choose order and you step into that order then god comes and he takes the word you get that you get that initial ecstasy of the baptism of the holy ghost and there are times that ecstasy of the holy ghost comes upon you but you don't live in that ecstasy 100 of the time if we've ever given that impression i'm sorry because every day you're fighting battles and every day there is a there is a a battle of whether you're going to have communion with your lord or not this is a great mystery laying marriage out but i speak concerning christ in the church there's ecstasy in marriage but it's not 24 7. and when the ecstasy fades away comes and it goes try to stay g-rated here as it comes and it goes in a marriage but there still has to be communion between a man and a wife day to day some highs some lows but i speak concerning christ in the church so there is a there is a a buzz that comes there when the spirit of god comes upon you there is an ecstasy an excitement a just a something you don't know what to do with because it's supernatural supernatural and i want and desire as you do to live more of my life above the natural and the way that that's going to happen is i've got to have sweet communion with him when i don't feel the excitement like i did at church when i don't feel the high that i have felt i still have to have communion with him because he has taken the word and he is washing me cleansing me letting the word wash over me and over me and over me those words that i have heard for years prior and and maybe they just bounced off of me and i had no understanding of them and he comes around and he takes that same word and he watches me again this time i'm ready to receive this time i'm ready to get it this time my mind and my i have a whole new mindset because i've been hearing the preaching of the word and it's brought me into a whole different mindset and now i let that word wash over me and it washes another layer off of me why is that because i am one of those that he is going to present to himself as a glorious church without spot wrinkle anything it's going to be that he is presenting a perfect lady to himself and he's using marriage in this chapter he's using marriage to demonstrate in a natural something that is supernatural and so as he's washing us in his word he's letting these things go over us over us over us because he wants to present to himself this glorious church would you stand together with me today i try to stay in the uh in the scripture and not give my own ideas and as god unveils himself more and more with his word musicians can come please as god unveils himself more and more to us he is causing the body of christ it's it's not just about husbands and wives but it's about every person in the body of christ so yielding themselves dropping their own ideas their own intellect to drop it and say i don't have to have my way when we as a church body there is divine order as i said a few minutes ago there's divine order in the way that god puts authority in our life there's this divine order and god is desiring that each one of us walk in this divine order and so yield ourselves one to another preferring one another and it's going to take this love that i've read about it's going to take that love for us to prefer one another because human nature is we want to be top dog we want to be at the forefront we want to be noticed human nature is that we're easily provoked because we're all out here working in satan's eating all you know dealing with all the pressures of life these things come at us and we react so hastily so quickly but we need to yield to one another let me tell you how you start heard somebody say it last night i'll tell you how you start when you come to an intersection you see that sign that says yield and you don't really want to yield and you got time to go barely yield yield preacher you are being so simplistic no because that is just one little thing in life and then we carry our in a hurry to the next part and to the next part and to the next part and we never yield to anybody we never prefer anybody because it's always about i gotta get there i gotta i gotta yield yield jesus use me lord don't refuse me jesus use me oh lord don't refuse me sure there's no work that i can do and even [Music] [Music] and though the cost be great i'll work for you just a little faster oh jesus excuse me and o lord don't refuse me surely there's a word that i can do and even though it's lord and though the cost be great i'll work for you he's the lily of the valley he's the bride and the [Music] my soul [Music] me [Music] jesus used me jesus use me [Music] oh lord don't refuse me [Music] there's [Music] and even though it's um [Music] [Music] while they continue playing that if you're in this place there's already some that are standing around the front but perhaps you would see some things that are in your life that are out of order it doesn't matter what they are we're not going to try to put names on them but if you would see that there's some things that are out of order in your life i want to give you the opportunity to come and join us around the front of this building today we're just going to have a corporate prayer because we want our lives to be in god's divine order we want everything about us to know that we are subjecting ourselves ourselves our life our will our emotions even to the will of god and if you find yourself today you would just say you know there's some things that aren't quite in order in my life i want to invite you to come and stand around the front with the rest of these surely there's a work that i can do and even though it's some more [Music] [Music] be great i'll work for you he's the lily of the valley he's the lily of the valley he's the bright and the morning star he's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul he's the beautiful rose of sharon he's all the world to me but best of all he is my coming king sing once again jesus [Music] jesus used me oh lord don't refuse me surely there's a word that i can do [Music] took [Music] father as we are gathered around the front of this auditorium none of us better than the next we just have come presenting ourselves before the living god we realize lord that our salvation is secure and we're grateful for that today i want to thank you that you have given us the baptism of the holy ghost to guide us into all truth and because that we have that guide it helps us to recognize when things are not in divine order in our lives so we've come presenting ourselves lord and asking for your help lord i would venture to say that standing around the front of this place there are all sorts of thought about what the disorder is in their lives one differing from the other but by your spirit you have helped us to recognize that there is not that divine order that we long for and so we come presenting ourselves before you asking you holy spirit that you will by the power of the blood of jesus christ you will cleanse us from all the disorder from all of the things that have us hung up and that you will cleanse completely and bring the divine order in our lives my god my god my god you see it lord you see the chaos of minds you see that thing that keeps whirling around and around and around and around and around but god i'm calling on you right now by the delivering power of the holy spirit to cleanse cleanse lord we give it to you i'm not my own i'm under the headship of the lord jesus christ and under that headship lord i realize that the word is all that matters i have got to be washed in the water of the word and when i find myself in error to the word i run quickly let the word cleanse us today oh lord in the quietness of this service as men and women are standing here in a sober moment i ask you that you would show the way the word of how to come in agreement in divine order where there is no order or where there is lack of order god i thank you that you heal marriages i thank you that you heal families i thank you that you cause children to be in subjection to their parents i thank you that you have wives that submit themselves and they trust their husbands i thank you for husbands who love their wives and who submit themselves to the word of god i thank you for that lord thank you for the simplicity of the gospel i thank you that you have hid it from the wise the intellectuals the prudent and you revealed it to babes now we want to thank you lord by faith we look to the promise of the word of the divine order for our lives we will not walk in defeat we will not walk in distress but we will walk in faith that the order giver is bringing divine order in our lives we decree this in the name of the lord jesus christ for the glory of god he's the lily of the valley he's [Music] my soul the beautiful rose of sheriff he [Music] he is jesus [Music] surely there's a work that i can do

traveled far to be here we're asking you for special protection upon them god for our pastor and his family we are asking that you just let your presence overshadow them the rest of their time away
