[55:11] wonderful his presence is here tonight
[55:15] how do you know because I brought him
[55:17] with me when I came how many of you
[55:19] brought him with you I didn't wait till
[55:22] I got here to find him I brought him
[55:24] with me and you brought you you you
[55:26] brought your portion your lick of fire
[55:30] and now we're here tonight gathered in
[55:32] his name you may be seated again just a
[55:34] moment you must be getting tired of
[55:36] being up and
[55:37] down but we're just kind of like that
[55:40] around here I realize that sometimes our
[55:44] worship can be a little
[55:46] off-putting it can kind of you know take
[55:49] people back a little bit but I want you
[55:52] to know that uh no one is putting in any
[55:56] pressure on any visitor
[55:59] to worship like we
[56:01] do but neither are we going to let your
[56:04] presence here keep us from worshiping
[56:07] like we always do right you see a lot of
[56:10] the people who are worshiping tonight
[56:12] were never born into a system they were
[56:15] born in Freedom and it makes a
[56:17] difference does it makes a difference
[56:21] when when you your Exodus was from sin
[56:24] and you didn't have to go through Church
[56:26] systems to get to where you are it makes
[56:29] a difference and so we we can apologize
[56:33] for freedom freedom and liberty is what
[56:36] we were promised he didn't die just to
[56:38] make us stoic Christians he he died to
[56:41] give us freedom not freedom to sin
[56:45] freedom to worship Him and freedom to
[56:48] live a different life aren't you glad
[56:51] for that
[56:52] tonight I I uh am just blessed I'm so
[56:56] blessed uh I'm so blessed that I can't
[56:59] even hardly think of of the pleasantries
[57:01] and and the preliminaries that I should
[57:03] be saying now brother gy is the

[57:08] weekend because of the death of his
[57:09] brother-in-law and he Delights in being

[57:18] around the room brother but but he he
[57:21] really knows even the children's name
[57:24] and I don't know your name and you may
[57:26] have told me but it doesn't matter I
[57:28] know you're my brothers and sisters in

[57:36] be terribly disappointed we're none of
[57:39] us are much to look at but I'll tell you
[57:41] he is everything am and uh it doesn't
[57:45] sound too much like a man but I have to
[57:47] say it anyway to me he's so beautiful

[1:08:37] that internet that can be so vile and so
[1:08:40] worldly we want to use it to advance the
[1:08:43] purposes of the kingdom of God in every
[1:08:46] way that we can we want to do that would
[1:08:50] you turn this evening uh to Revelation
[1:08:53] chapter 3 beginning in verse
[1:08:58] 13 he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:09:02] the spirit saith unto the churches and
[1:09:05] unto the angel of the Church of the leod
[1:09:08] Deans write these things saith the amen
[1:09:12] the faithful and true witness the
[1:09:15] beginning of the creation of God and I
[1:09:19] would like to preach a couple hours on
[1:09:22] the beginning of the creation of God but
[1:09:25] not
[1:09:25] tonight I Know Thy works that thou art
[1:09:29] neither cold nor hot I would that thou W
[1:09:35] cold or
[1:09:37] hot so then because Thou Art
[1:09:41] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot three
[1:09:46] times three times he says the
[1:09:50] differentiation cold or hot I'd rather
[1:09:54] you be cold or hot I'd rather you be
[1:09:57] cold or hot but because you're lukewarm
[1:10:00] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[1:10:04] thee out of my mouth that's not a
[1:10:09] dribble because thou sayest I am rich
[1:10:13] and increased with goods and have need
[1:10:16] of help me and knowest not that thou art
[1:10:21] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:10:24] blind and naked it sounds like he's
[1:10:28] talking about the drgs of the world but
[1:10:32] he's not at all he's talking about the
[1:10:35] last Church age he's talking about the
[1:10:39] last Church
[1:10:40] system he's talking about the age that
[1:10:44] you and I are pulling out of we're
[1:10:47] living in a lap over between leod DEA
[1:10:50] and the bride age but this is where we
[1:10:53] have come from some of us have come from
[1:10:55] this it's our story Rich increase with
[1:10:59] Goods have need of nothing and knowest
[1:11:02] not that thou art Rich wretched and
[1:11:04] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[1:11:07] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:11:12] the fire that thou mayest be rich there
[1:11:17] is a richness that has nothing to do
[1:11:20] with this world's economy amen we
[1:11:22] started off tonight by singing I'm rich
[1:11:24] in faith and hope and love let me tell
[1:11:27] you something that's the riches of this
[1:11:29] bride that's our inheritance as him Hope
[1:11:32] and Faith and love and the the move of
[1:11:36] God uh I counsel thee to buy me gold
[1:11:39] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:11:40] rich and white rment that thou mayest be
[1:11:43] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:11:46] nakedness do not appear and uh anoint
[1:11:51] thine eyes with isav that thou mayest
[1:11:54] see is there anybody here tonight
[1:11:57] thankful for the isav I'm thankful for
[1:12:01] the grease I'm thankful that God
[1:12:04] has anointed our eyes as many as I
[1:12:08] love you see love is not just
[1:12:13] acceptance as many as I love I rebuke
[1:12:17] and
[1:12:19] chasen be be what
[1:12:23] zealous it means to have
[1:12:26] passion to be zealous
[1:12:29] therefore and
[1:12:32] repent in Hebrews let's catch a few
[1:12:35] verses there before we're seated chapter
[1:12:38] 2 veres 1-3 therefore we ought to give
[1:12:43] the more Earnest heed to the things
[1:12:47] which we have heard
[1:12:51] lest at any time we should
[1:12:56] let them slip for if the word spoken by
[1:13:01] Angels was steadfast and every
[1:13:04] transgression and
[1:13:05] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:13:09] of reward how shall I want you to to
[1:13:14] read the next word to me now we
[1:13:19] we how shall we not how shall they come
[1:13:23] on not how shall they how shall we
[1:13:28] escape if we
[1:13:31] neglect so
[1:13:34] great so great
[1:13:38] salvation I read to you just a moment
[1:13:40] ago about
[1:13:42] they and now I'm reading to you about
[1:13:46] we how
[1:13:48] shall we escape if we neglect so great
[1:13:52] salvation which at the first began to be
[1:13:55] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:13:58] unto us by them that heard him Jesus we
[1:14:04] are here tonight to lift up your name
[1:14:08] and the Saints are here they have
[1:14:10] sacrificed to be here they have come
[1:14:13] with their own
[1:14:15] Finance the gas and their automobile and
[1:14:18] the food they they would bring and and
[1:14:21] and need all all the things that are
[1:14:23] involved
[1:14:25] some of them are sort of camping out
[1:14:27] there may not even be enough beds to go
[1:14:30] around but Lord they they didn't come to
[1:14:33] hear me they didn't come to see us they
[1:14:36] didn't come just to Mark Alabama off
[1:14:39] their list of states they've come to
[1:14:43] encounter you and your word to to see
[1:14:46] you in living
[1:14:48] reality and I I need you tonight Lord
[1:14:51] because I'm just a man and I I can get
[1:14:54] in the way way just as uh like I can get
[1:14:57] out of the way so I ask you tonight to
[1:15:00] help me be moved out of the way let me
[1:15:04] catch the frequency of another dimension
[1:15:07] another realm and let me minister to
[1:15:09] this people in a way that would not wear
[1:15:12] them out but that it would somehow speak
[1:15:14] to their lives and in this we will give
[1:15:17] you all the thanks you're the worthy one
[1:15:20] and all the praise it's in the name of
[1:15:23] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:15:26] Saints said amen you may be seated we
[1:15:30] don't want to freeze the people out so
[1:15:32] if you see that they're getting cold
[1:15:34] then you can make the
[1:15:37] adjustments I don't want to start off
[1:15:39] with an
[1:15:40] offense and trouble anybody but I would
[1:15:43] like to read those verses for just a
[1:15:46] moment from the Amplified version and
[1:15:48] I'm doing that because tonight I don't
[1:15:51] have the time to break down every word I
[1:15:55] like to know what the word means I like
[1:15:58] to know not only what it means in Modern
[1:16:01] English but I like to know what it meant
[1:16:04] in the original language that it was
[1:16:06] written I'm not trying to be
[1:16:08] intellectual because you you can't put
[1:16:11] that on so you'll certainly see that I'm
[1:16:14] not intellectual but I want to be
[1:16:16] accurate and I want to be thorough and I
[1:16:19] want this word to not be misinterpreted
[1:16:23] or misplaced in any way way we can take
[1:16:27] sometimes a word of Old English this
[1:16:31] Bible that we have we're thankful for it
[1:16:34] it is the word of God preserved for us
[1:16:36] it's not full of holes it's not full of
[1:16:39] contradictions it's not full of mistakes
[1:16:42] but there are time I thought you would
[1:16:44] say Amen but there are times that we can
[1:16:47] misunderstand the word because it means
[1:16:50] something different today than it did
[1:16:53] under the reign of King James so I'd
[1:16:56] like to just uh break that down it would
[1:16:59] be wonderful to be able to do that but
[1:17:01] time wouldn't allow it so let me read uh
[1:17:03] just a moment these three verses since
[1:17:06] all this is
[1:17:09] true we ought to pay much closer
[1:17:13] attention I'm Hebrews 213 I hope I I may
[1:17:17] not be
[1:17:19] honey that's my daughter I don't want
[1:17:22] you to think I'm calling some random Mr
[1:17:25] honey although we are in the South and
[1:17:27] we do that sometime let me just read it
[1:17:31] since all this is true it's beginning in
[1:17:33] verse one I may not have given it to you
[1:17:35] that way we ought to pay much closer
[1:17:38] attention than ever to the truths that
[1:17:42] we have heard lest in any way we listen
[1:17:46] we drift past them you see that word
[1:17:51] slip uh that is used there in the King
[1:17:54] James it means to flow
[1:17:57] past when we think of the word slip we
[1:18:01] think of a
[1:18:02] misstep and we think of a a slippery
[1:18:05] path I don't know about you Northern
[1:18:08] people but but we Southern folks we just
[1:18:11] really went through something down
[1:18:14] here we had white stuff falling out of
[1:18:17] the
[1:18:18] sky and we had ice on our roads and uh
[1:18:23] it was almost like waking up in a
[1:18:25] foreign country or something to us and
[1:18:28] it was so slippery that it shut down the
[1:18:32] interstate can you imagine that we don't
[1:18:35] have enough sand trucks and all the
[1:18:37] things that you folk have and the
[1:18:40] interstate was closed down because there
[1:18:42] were so many wrecks and so many
[1:18:44] accidents that had taken place so when
[1:18:46] we think of the word slip we think of
[1:18:49] something slippery but this is not
[1:18:51] slippery the word is airm
[1:18:55] Foundation nothing slippery about it and
[1:18:58] the enemy is The Great Deceiver and the
[1:19:01] great Seducer and he would like to uh
[1:19:04] certainly to make us step off of that
[1:19:07] Foundation but it's not by because it's
[1:19:11] slippery because the word actually means
[1:19:13] to flow past to Glide by to drift away
[1:19:19] to fall off or to end up in Decline so
[1:19:24] the amp ified did very well when it said
[1:19:26] less than any way we drift past them
[1:19:31] what is them the things which we have
[1:19:35] heard we can't fall back from them we
[1:19:39] can't decline from them and we can't
[1:19:42] drift past them we can't drift away from
[1:19:47] them we've got to make sure that our
[1:19:50] feet remain on the foundation of the ABS
[1:19:54] absolute word of God the Holy Scripture
[1:19:59] amen are you going to help me tonight
[1:20:01] it's going to be a long evening if you
[1:20:03] don't help a little bit I'm talking
[1:20:05] about the Bible I'm talking about
[1:20:08] Genesis to
[1:20:09] Revelation I don't want to throw you off
[1:20:12] and cause you to misunderstand I'm not
[1:20:14] talking about your pastor sermons I'm
[1:20:17] not even talking about brother brandham
[1:20:20] sermons I'm talking about Genesis to
[1:20:23] revelation
[1:20:25] I'm talking about his absolute the
[1:20:28] prophet kept telling us what his
[1:20:31] absolute was it was the Scripture it was
[1:20:35] Genesis to Revelation he even said more
[1:20:39] than one time if if I say something that
[1:20:44] you can't find in that Bible in that
[1:20:48] scripture he said don't you believe it
[1:20:51] that's what
[1:20:53] he amen get
[1:20:55] quiet I I didn't give them the quotes
[1:20:58] but I've got them right here if you need
[1:21:01] them I have them don't take my word for
[1:21:04] it he said amen go back to the
[1:21:08] absolute and there's a lot of preaching
[1:21:11] that goes on in this old world around
[1:21:14] even the ranks of the message of the
[1:21:16] hour that we just couldn't really take
[1:21:19] it back to the word so it's not our job
[1:21:23] it's not our commission it's not our
[1:21:25] ministry to point out all those things
[1:21:28] but it is our ministry to stay on the
[1:21:32] word lest we fall off of it lest we
[1:21:36] drift past it you understand what I'm
[1:21:39] saying we've got an
[1:21:42] anchor we have an
[1:21:45] anchor so he said for for If the message
[1:21:49] given through Angels the law spoken to
[1:21:53] Moses was authentic and proved sure and
[1:21:58] every violation and
[1:22:01] Disobedience received an appropriate
[1:22:04] just and adequate penalty how
[1:22:09] shall
[1:22:13] amen how shall we
[1:22:16] escape there's a whole lot of preaching
[1:22:18] that goes on about out
[1:22:22] there but every now now and then we need
[1:22:26] some word about in
[1:22:28] here how
[1:22:31] shall how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:22:35] so great salvation if we let it drift by
[1:22:39] or we drift by it or fall off of it
[1:22:42] because the word slip can actually mean
[1:22:44] to fall off of it if we fall off the
[1:22:47] word what do we have
[1:22:50] left if we go out on a limb with some
[1:22:53] idea or some Doctrine or some
[1:22:57] interpretation that doesn't have its
[1:22:59] foundation in the scripture and we fall
[1:23:02] off the foundation we will be no better
[1:23:06] off than those who are living under
[1:23:09] their Leo Dean
[1:23:12] Spirit you see we not only have to
[1:23:15] overcome the spirit of the age but we
[1:23:18] have to overcome the temptation to yield
[1:23:21] ourselves to fanaticism amen
[1:23:25] Amen brother bandam preaching about
[1:23:28] Martin Luther he said you know that was
[1:23:30] one of the great things about Martin
[1:23:32] Luther there weren't a whole lot of
[1:23:34] great things about Martin Luther that's
[1:23:36] right he received one great Revelation
[1:23:39] that changed a lot of things but he
[1:23:42] struggled if you have ever read the
[1:23:44] writings of Martin Luther he he
[1:23:48] struggled uh almost to the end of his
[1:23:51] life with what he had done
[1:23:54] so yes it was a revelation that got
[1:23:57] bigger than him he was a messenger sent
[1:24:00] to bring it and it rolled like a
[1:24:03] snowball into the great Reformation but
[1:24:07] he personally continued to struggle with
[1:24:10] some of the reality that God is not
[1:24:13] nearly as interested in our works and
[1:24:16] our doings and our religious trappings
[1:24:20] as he
[1:24:22] is the Inner Man
[1:24:25] because if we get the inner man right if
[1:24:29] our heart is right if we can if we can
[1:24:31] win the victory over our mind over our
[1:24:35] will and over our
[1:24:37] emotions you see there's a great battle
[1:24:40] going on the greatest battle ever fought
[1:24:43] and it's not going on out
[1:24:46] there it's going on in here how shall we
[1:24:52] escape if we neglect and refuse to pay
[1:24:57] attention to such great a Salvation as
[1:25:00] is now offered to us letting it drift
[1:25:03] past us forever for it was declared at
[1:25:07] first by the Lord himself and it was
[1:25:09] confirmed to us and proved to be real
[1:25:12] and genuine by those who personally
[1:25:15] heard him speak how many of you know
[1:25:17] they were
[1:25:19] eyewitnesses they saw they heard and
[1:25:22] they told and God has preserved that for
[1:25:26] this day you need to understand that by
[1:25:30] elevating the word we're not putting
[1:25:33] anybody
[1:25:35] down you you don't have to put somebody
[1:25:37] down to elevate the word when you
[1:25:40] elevate the word who are you lifting up
[1:25:43] you're lifting up Jesus Christ John the
[1:25:46] Baptist said I must
[1:25:48] decrease that he might increase
[1:25:51] therefore anybody coming in the same SP
[1:25:54] spirit and power that John the Baptist
[1:25:56] operated in which was not his own
[1:25:58] anointing but it was a portion of the
[1:26:00] same kind of anointing that fell on
[1:26:03] Elijah of the Old Testament amen and
[1:26:06] therefore anybody coming under that kind
[1:26:09] of inspiration would have to live in the
[1:26:11] same vein in the same realm and that
[1:26:15] realm says I must
[1:26:20] decrease oh my you're going to make me
[1:26:23] work tonight aren't you
[1:26:25] I must get very small so that the one
[1:26:28] I'm come to introduce you to can get
[1:26:31] very
[1:26:33] large you understand what I'm saying
[1:26:35] don't you you can respect all the gifts
[1:26:38] of God we should respect The Messengers
[1:26:42] that God sent to us one to a church age
[1:26:46] how many one one to a church age we
[1:26:50] should respect the five-fold ministry
[1:26:52] because she is alive and we well there
[1:26:55] are still to this day Apostles prophets
[1:26:58] pastors teachers and evangelists those
[1:27:01] things are not
[1:27:03] over you see this message the prophet
[1:27:06] said is a restoration message some
[1:27:09] people have made it a subtraction
[1:27:11] message we're taking away from oh no
[1:27:15] this message was the one promis to
[1:27:18] restore to put back to place again what
[1:27:23] the enemy had taken
[1:27:27] away this is not just to take us back to
[1:27:30] the day of
[1:27:31] Pentecost it's to take us all the way
[1:27:34] back to the Garden of Eden all the way
[1:27:37] back to the authority that belonged to
[1:27:39] Adam in the beginning and so we need
[1:27:41] more than just a Pentecost but we need
[1:27:44] some of that because you see we've been
[1:27:47] in that Exodus so long that we no longer
[1:27:50] look at Pentecost like a denomination
[1:27:54] or like a movement to us it means
[1:27:57] nothing but an experience and without
[1:28:00] that original
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:02] Mana without that real Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] baptism you're going to fall off the
[1:28:09] Bible you're going to fall off the word
[1:28:12] you're going to find yourself drifting
[1:28:15] in life's sea and it doesn't have to be
[1:28:18] the influence of others because
[1:28:21] sometimes the battle that's right that's
[1:28:23] right
[1:28:25] you don't have to have another
[1:28:27] voice from the outside coming in you've
[1:28:31] got one on the inside sometime that's
[1:28:34] contrary he said so you you've got those
[1:28:37] two dogs well I'm Holy Ghost fi there's
[1:28:40] only one in me well I I I want you to
[1:28:42] know I don't understand that because the
[1:28:44] Apostle Paul the church age messenger
[1:28:46] the very first one that God sent to the
[1:28:48] Ephesian Church age he said in my
[1:28:50] innermost
[1:28:52] being not out
[1:28:56] there can I get out of this harness just
[1:28:58] a little bit he he he oh somebody said
[1:29:01] take it off why didn't you say that
[1:29:05] sooner he said in my innermost being
[1:29:09] there is a
[1:29:10] Warfare I want to do that which I would
[1:29:14] and when I when I when I desire and set
[1:29:16] out to do that which I would something
[1:29:20] else there's another War there's another
[1:29:23] in influence in my
[1:29:27] members that's trying to lead me so you
[1:29:30] don't just have to fall under the
[1:29:32] influence of someone else I think that
[1:29:35] some of you of course have come from
[1:29:38] systems that believe that if you cut off
[1:29:41] the world and its influence that
[1:29:45] everything would be all right but what
[1:29:47] we have failed to understand is the last
[1:29:51] battle it's not a battle from out there
[1:29:55] to
[1:29:56] inhere it's not an influence from the
[1:29:59] systems that we've been delivered from
[1:30:01] although some fall victim to that but
[1:30:03] the great battle the last one that the
[1:30:07] bride is winning yes she's
[1:30:10] winning we're winning in
[1:30:13] 2025 is a mind
[1:30:16] battle you see it's the lie in
[1:30:19] here it's the one you tell yourself it's
[1:30:22] the one the enemy Whispers to you from
[1:30:25] the inside out and if we neglect so
[1:30:29] great salvation if we let anything slip
[1:30:32] that has been delivered to us that has
[1:30:34] its foundation in the word we're the
[1:30:38] ones that are going to pay the
[1:30:41] price we're going to lose more than just
[1:30:44] a few folks we're going to lose more
[1:30:47] than we could even place value on or
[1:30:51] calculate this little bride is still
[1:30:54] I I I I want you to understand that even
[1:30:57] though the word of God has been made
[1:30:58] known we're not yet in the
[1:31:02] picnic this is still a war zone because
[1:31:06] all of hell is turned on this little
[1:31:11] bride You Know The Enemy he is so
[1:31:14] jealous of
[1:31:16] you Satan is so jealous of you because
[1:31:20] you are
[1:31:22] already in the mind of of God you are
[1:31:24] already what he wanted to
[1:31:27] be you already have authority that he
[1:31:31] wanted to
[1:31:33] have you already know his end and he
[1:31:37] knows his end and he knows that he
[1:31:40] cannot pluck you and I out of the hand
[1:31:43] of the bridegroom King the one who
[1:31:46] redeemed us with an Incorruptible price
[1:31:49] the price of his own blood he knows that
[1:31:52] he can't change your
[1:31:55] election he can't even make you not a
[1:32:00] son so so therefore it's not your
[1:32:03] relationship with God that the enemy can
[1:32:05] have any influence over it's your
[1:32:09] fellowship I said it's your
[1:32:12] fellowship I said it's your fellowship
[1:32:15] that the enemy would like to mess
[1:32:17] up because if he can break your
[1:32:21] fellowship with your father with your
[1:32:24] papa if he can break your fellowship
[1:32:27] with your creator if he can cause you to
[1:32:30] fall off or let truth drift by you while
[1:32:34] you're standing
[1:32:37] still if he can cause you to lift your
[1:32:40] anchor come on get distracted by the
[1:32:43] things that are said on the Internet or
[1:32:46] distracted by family members who think
[1:32:49] you've surely lost your
[1:32:51] mind if he can cause us to to get
[1:32:54] distracted in this hour he knows he can
[1:32:57] paralyze us he can't change our Eternal
[1:33:02] destination he can't take us out of
[1:33:04] Eternity with Christ but he can distract
[1:33:08] us and disuade us and cause us to stand
[1:33:14] still when the pillar of fire moves on
[1:33:18] you don't want to be standing still
[1:33:21] while the pillar of fire is leading the
[1:33:23] Bri
[1:33:24] forward and and where would he lead us
[1:33:28] Beyond where we already are let me tell
[1:33:31] you what the New Testament says let us
[1:33:33] go
[1:33:35] on let us go on unto
[1:33:40] Perfection not laying again the
[1:33:43] foundations of baptisms Etc
[1:33:46] amen you ought to know that the only
[1:33:48] Christian baptism by now is in the name
[1:33:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ you know that
[1:33:54] by now if you don't then there's got to
[1:33:57] be somebody to tell you what the word
[1:33:59] says but this little bride can only be
[1:34:02] hung in in understanding a godhead or
[1:34:06] understanding uh an end time event or or
[1:34:09] or something along that line we've got
[1:34:12] to win this battle here we've got to get
[1:34:15] bitterness out of the way and jealousies
[1:34:18] out of the way and resentments out of
[1:34:21] the way and and offense is out of the
[1:34:25] way we've got to do some
[1:34:28] gardening by the help of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:32] we've got to do some holding on and
[1:34:35] we've got to do some turning loose I
[1:34:37] said we've got to do some holding on and
[1:34:40] we've got to do some turning loose
[1:34:43] because there's a move on there's a move
[1:34:45] on let me tell you there is a move on
[1:34:48] for the little bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:34:52] ones who are allowing Jesus to get
[1:34:57] bigger the word to get
[1:35:01] bigger those who are turning their eyes
[1:35:04] to the
[1:35:05] scripture with the understanding that
[1:35:07] God has brought to us in this day
[1:35:11] there's no doubt about it this ministry
[1:35:14] that God has sent has caused the Bible
[1:35:16] to become a new book that's but yet we
[1:35:20] cannot make it say something
[1:35:24] that it doesn't
[1:35:26] say I don't know where my Amen
[1:35:29] Corner is tonight but I'm going to
[1:35:32] assume that you know I'm telling you the
[1:35:34] truth just the same in a message right
[1:35:37] down the road here in mon Georgia in
[1:35:41] 1955 I I won't finish reading that I'll
[1:35:44] go on uh God it the message was called
[1:35:48] Fellowship through the
[1:35:51] reconciliation of the blood
[1:35:54] your fellowship with God is of Great
[1:35:56] Value and importance in this hour amen
[1:36:00] God sending a Revival Across the Nation
[1:36:03] great signs and wonders and signs
[1:36:06] appearing everywhere and healing of sick
[1:36:09] the raising of dead and everything and
[1:36:11] Men weighed right on through breaking
[1:36:14] down every red light and running through
[1:36:18] every
[1:36:19] barrier what's that word refus refusing
[1:36:24] or you say I've gone to church I'm as
[1:36:27] good as you are that's not the
[1:36:29] question here is the question have you
[1:36:33] received the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[1:36:38] savior that's the
[1:36:41] question it's not what do you think
[1:36:44] about the
[1:36:46] seals the question is have you received
[1:36:49] the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior
[1:36:53] have have you been
[1:36:56] reconciled you and I have been given a
[1:36:58] Ministry of
[1:37:00] reconciliation and we're not only to be
[1:37:03] testifying about the good things that we
[1:37:05] have seen and heard in the ministry that
[1:37:08] God sent to help prepare us we're
[1:37:10] supposed to be testifying of the
[1:37:13] goodness of the Savior who held back the
[1:37:16] water did you sing that held back the
[1:37:19] water so that you and I could escape
[1:37:23] from the the Egypt of sin then he did it
[1:37:27] again he held back the water so that we
[1:37:30] could escape from man's
[1:37:33] religion you don't want to trade one
[1:37:36] man's religion for another man's
[1:37:42] religion else we fall off the word
[1:37:45] that's right we must not do that we must
[1:37:48] not get caught up in the
[1:37:51] semantics we must not get caught up only
[1:37:54] in the
[1:37:56] signs we must hear the voice and the
[1:38:00] voice didn't point us to the signs the
[1:38:04] voice pointed us to the word and he
[1:38:08] tells us
[1:38:10] Jesus Jesus is the word and had he not
[1:38:14] told us that the Bible already did in
[1:38:17] john1 did yes he is the word he said
[1:38:21] have you been reconciled you say well I
[1:38:23] belong to the nicest Church in town

[1:38:54] are no longer tormenting
[1:38:58] us one of the ways we can know are we
[1:39:01] born of the spirit of God is how is your
[1:39:04] fellowship amen how is your prayer
[1:39:09] life are you abiding in the
[1:39:12] vine have you discovered where real life
[1:39:15] comes
[1:39:16] from the the title of this that God laid
[1:39:19] on my heart is anchored or a drift the
[1:39:24] choice to cleave or to drift away it's
[1:39:28] it's our it's our choice uh I'm going to
[1:39:32] cleave I'm going to hold on to the word
[1:39:35] I'm going to lay my head on his chest
[1:39:38] I'm going to get as close to Jesus as I
[1:39:40] possibly can I'm not going to let this
[1:39:44] world affect my fellowship I'm not going
[1:39:47] to let the arguments that go on in our
[1:39:50] ranks affect my fellowship with Christ
[1:39:55] I'm going to shed that stuff like a duck
[1:39:58] sheds water whatever they do is on them
[1:40:02] whatever I do is on me I must have
[1:40:06] fellowship with him and when I say that
[1:40:09] I don't just mean hearing the
[1:40:11] preaching I mean meeting him in the

[1:41:15] and you'll discover that answer as you
[1:41:17] find fellowship with him draw the the
[1:41:21] the blinds together and close the

[1:41:31] with him Fellowship
[1:41:33] Divine come on
[1:41:36] now Fellowship you can
[1:41:38] study and not have
[1:41:41] Fellowship you can learn to
[1:41:44] memorize and not have
[1:41:47] Fellowship he said that's not the idea
[1:41:49] you're born perfect Fellowship the
[1:41:51] things of the world Dead Oh you said no
[1:41:53] don't condemn me well my brother some
[1:41:55] days some people don't even have a
[1:41:57] conscience he said one oldtime colored
[1:42:01] fellow after I was preaching on the
[1:42:03] street corner said preacher you know
[1:42:05] what your conscience is and and I said I
[1:42:08] have an idea sir what do you what do you
[1:42:11] think it is he said it's a little thing
[1:42:14] that sets like this and it's got
[1:42:18] four sharp and brother brandom is trying
[1:42:22] to use his accent pints which he said he
[1:42:25] was referring he meant points so some
[1:42:29] little something this was just his idea
[1:42:31] of how the conscious operated four
[1:42:35] points on it and when you do anything
[1:42:38] wrong it cuts I like to say it
[1:42:43] Pricks and he said you you you keep
[1:42:46] letting it cut it cuts a circle around
[1:42:50] there all four points you know St Ing
[1:42:53] and and he said after a while you don't
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:02] even you don't even feel it at
[1:43:05] all our lack of love in this hour has
[1:43:09] produced a a hardening of
[1:43:12] heart that has caused even those sitting
[1:43:15] in the church they're conscious sometime
[1:43:18] to be seared like a hot iron and that
[1:43:20] little thing is rolling around I'm just
[1:43:22] this is just an example just someone's
[1:43:24] idea of what it would like it's rolling
[1:43:26] around in there but you don't feel the
[1:43:28] prick
[1:43:30] anymore you don't feel the point of it
[1:43:33] anymore because you have ignored
[1:43:37] it so
[1:43:40] long we ought to give the most Earnest
[1:43:44] heed
[1:43:45] we we should how shall we escape amen he
[1:43:51] said and that's right you just keep
[1:43:55] lukewarm hear him drifting
[1:43:58] away drifting away and after a while
[1:44:03] you're all the way
[1:44:05] gone he doesn't seem to just be talking
[1:44:08] to
[1:44:10] denominations he seems to be talking to
[1:44:12] all believers in a message evidence of
[1:44:15] the Resurrection he said even in our own
[1:44:18] meetings we we we've got too much to the
[1:44:20] place there's too much on Divine Healing
[1:44:23] listen listen too much on Divine Healing
[1:44:26] he said instead of healing of the Soul
[1:44:30] he said brother what we need today is a
[1:44:33] Revival of breaking up Souls on fire for
[1:44:39] God does that speak to anybody's
[1:44:43] heart instead of dragging them along
[1:44:46] Sunday after Sunday come
[1:44:49] on propping them
[1:44:52] up it's going to get
[1:44:55] quiet you know petting
[1:44:58] them you know the old man said giving
[1:45:02] them a a sugar
[1:45:06] titt you know just making sure that that
[1:45:10] the paragard goes down with a spoonful
[1:45:12] of
[1:45:14] sugar you better melt a little sugar if
[1:45:17] you're going to swallow the uh the
[1:45:19] kerosene or whatever it is that someone
[1:45:21] is is thinking you you got to I want you
[1:45:24] to know folks we're past
[1:45:26] that we gave up the sugar TTS I hope
[1:45:31] that doesn't offend you we gave up the
[1:45:33] candy
[1:45:35] coating we don't need any more candy
[1:45:37] coating we need it to come so straight
[1:45:40] so Gun Barrel straight there's nowhere
[1:45:44] to run except to the
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:48] word we need it it's the only hope
[1:45:53] if your burden is to bring people out of
[1:45:56] other systems into the reality of the
[1:45:59] full word you definitely don't want to
[1:46:02] fall into some kind of a
[1:46:05] rut where you're pulling them out of one
[1:46:11] fire and a they're just changing
[1:46:17] boxes just just a minute I'm going to
[1:46:19] have to help myself a little bit preach
[1:46:21] brother preach PR brother listen you
[1:46:24] learn did you know this this

[1:46:29] will kind of celebrate in October is 50
[1:46:33] years of Ministry for me I may sound
[1:46:37] tonight like a beginner like I just got
[1:46:39] started but I want you to know I've been
[1:46:41] around this thing long enough to know
[1:46:45] that it's not another pat on the
[1:46:48] back that we need we need something so
[1:46:51] straight that as I said a moment ago we
[1:46:54] have nowhere else to run you know Dr
[1:46:57] Phil has no answers the the bookstore
[1:47:00] has no answers we know the churches out
[1:47:03] there don't have any answers and
[1:47:05] sometimes those that claim the message
[1:47:07] of the hour they don't have any answers
[1:47:09] either because they're trying to take
[1:47:11] somebody to a sermon and that is not the
[1:47:13] hope that they need no sir that will
[1:47:16] help make disciples out of
[1:47:20] them a tape can disciple it can train it
[1:47:24] can help us to understand this great
[1:47:30] book but we need
[1:47:33] deliverance we need somebody who raises
[1:47:36] up in authority and says you fou demon
[1:47:39] from the pit of Hell come out of that
[1:47:42] woman in the name of Jesus
[1:47:45] Christ and you don't want to do that in
[1:47:48] proxy you want to do that in full
[1:47:51] Authority any anybody with me yes you
[1:47:54] don't want to say in the name of the one
[1:47:55] that Paul preached about you don't want
[1:47:58] to say in the name of the one brother
[1:47:59] Brandon preached about you want to be
[1:48:02] known in that realm as well that you're
[1:48:04] a Jesus man you're a Jesus woman and
[1:48:07] because of that you have authority to
[1:48:10] speak to the mountain you have authority
[1:48:12] to speak to Darkness and it does not
[1:48:14] have you don't have to negotiate with it
[1:48:17] you speak the
[1:48:19] word that's why that Fellowship is so
[1:48:21] vital and so important important and
[1:48:23] that's why winning this mind battle is
[1:48:25] so vital and so important because we
[1:48:28] have all the authority we need right
[1:48:30] now it's just laying in us it's not more
[1:48:34] power we need we have all the power we
[1:48:37] need we just need to get all the
[1:48:39] distraction out of the way and come into
[1:48:42] perfect fellowship with
[1:48:45] him we need to understand that that you
[1:48:48] can't drag somebody else into the tent

[1:49:36] just a
[1:49:38] nut
[1:49:40] bubbles tiny little
[1:49:43] bubbles there came a time that the
[1:49:46] bubbles came
[1:49:49] out that was a signal
[1:49:53] the bride and groom are out of
[1:49:55] here best man you staying clean
[1:50:00] up we're going on now when Benjamin and
[1:50:04] Jenna left the left the venue where they

[1:50:09] Texas there were it was already
[1:50:11] Nightfall there were
[1:50:13] sparklers I was a
[1:50:18] wreck I couldn't even enjoy
[1:50:21] it because I could just see a big long
[1:50:25] uh head of
[1:50:26] hair going up in in in
[1:50:30] Flames I even said to some of the ones
[1:50:33] around me I said hold your hair back

[1:50:47] torch when you when you throw the rice
[1:50:50] when you let the butterflies go when you
[1:50:52] when you send those tiny bubbles in the
[1:50:54] air it's a
[1:50:56] signal that you've done your part thank
[1:50:58] you for coming God bless you all who
[1:51:01] we're out of here there's nothing wrong
[1:51:04] with that that's the way it's supposed
[1:51:06] to be that's the way it's designed to be
[1:51:10] and you're not going to drag somebody
[1:51:12] along with you it's just you and the
[1:51:15] bridegroom I'm telling you in order to

[1:51:43] of intimacy it's a place of communion

[1:51:49] fellowship and too many of us are
[1:51:51] missing it

[1:51:55] life because we're a
[1:51:57] drift we've let things come along we've
[1:52:00] pulled up our
[1:52:01] anchor we're still trying to figure out
[1:52:04] what we're going to call
[1:52:06] ourselves how we're going to classify
[1:52:10] ourselves are we going to be former

[1:53:18] right time you can tell them all the
[1:53:20] things you know and where you found it
[1:53:21] and who bless bled you and who helped
[1:53:23] you and who revealed it all to you but I
[1:53:25] want to tell you something now sometime
[1:53:27] people say well what do you believe they
[1:53:29] say well you know I we don't believe in
[1:53:31] women wearing this and we don't believe
[1:53:33] in women wearing that and we don't
[1:53:35] believe in the women and they say oh my
[1:53:36] you're pretty hard on women huh and we
[1:53:39] don't know what to say because it's like
[1:53:42] we give all the men a free
[1:53:48] pass we've even Twisted marriage and
[1:53:51] divorce so bad into such a into such a
[1:53:55] monster that the men are given a free
[1:54:00] pass oh it's quiet let's keep it on the
[1:54:05] word let's keep it on the
[1:54:07] word they're not interested in your
[1:54:10] they're not asking you about your
[1:54:12] convictions they're not asking you about
[1:54:15] they see that's why they ask you in the
[1:54:17] first place they saw that you were
[1:54:19] different they didn't go up to the
[1:54:21] Jezebel and ask ask her where she went
[1:54:23] to church they don't care where she goes
[1:54:25] to church they've already got what she's
[1:54:29] got they touched out reached out and
[1:54:32] touched you because they saw that you
[1:54:34] were not like everybody else around you
[1:54:38] so let this be your opportunity to point
[1:54:40] them to the living reality of Christ the
[1:54:44] word and that he's no longer just a
[1:54:47] page he's no longer just a 2,000 year
[1:54:50] old savior
[1:54:52] he's now a living
[1:54:56] reality living inside of the
[1:55:00] believer she that believer is not born
[1:55:03] from down here anymore we have a new
[1:55:06] birth I've got to
[1:55:08] hurry we're born from
[1:55:11] above let's go on we need a Revival of
[1:55:14] breaking up Souls on fire for God what I
[1:55:16] mean on fire is down at the
[1:55:19] altar with tears r running down their
[1:55:24] cheeks not for 5 minutes and get up and
[1:55:27] forget
[1:55:28] it but out trying to win the Lost back
[1:55:31] to Christ again a
[1:55:35] burden on their heart I don't know who
[1:55:38] the again is referring to it could be
[1:55:40] referring to both it could be referring
[1:55:43] to the one that had never known Christ
[1:55:45] it could be referring to the Christian
[1:55:47] who had temporarily laid down the burden
[1:55:49] for souls and now they're out telling it
[1:55:51] again
[1:55:52] I want you to know the best thing that
[1:55:54] you can do to witness to somebody is
[1:55:56] live the
[1:55:58] life live the life nobody cares if you
[1:56:02] jump when you go to church just just
[1:56:05] know for sure you're going to live as
[1:56:07] high as you jump isn't that right nobody
[1:56:10] cares if you dance nobody cares if you
[1:56:12] run nobody cares if you rejoice in the
[1:56:15] Lord you have every right to praise the
[1:56:18] Lord somebody said do everything but but
[1:56:20] jump up and down don't don't do that
[1:56:22] that's like the modern church let me
[1:56:24] tell you something I've been jumping a
[1:56:26] long
[1:56:27] time way before I knew anything about
[1:56:30] what was going on in the modern church
[1:56:32] for every
[1:56:38] counterfeit you grab a hold of a live
[1:56:41] wire and let's see if you can continue
[1:56:44] to act
[1:56:47] like
[1:56:49] icicles it's a hard issue
[1:56:52] now I'm I'm going to preach
[1:56:54] now turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter
[1:56:57] 4 verse 3 and 4 your eyes have seen what
[1:57:03] the Lord did because of bael peor for
[1:57:07] all the men that followed by elpor the
[1:57:10] Lord thy God hath destroyed them from
[1:57:13] among you verse four but ye that listen
[1:57:19] but ye that did
[1:57:27] cleave unto the
[1:57:29] Lord your
[1:57:32] God you are alive every one of you this
[1:57:38] day God destroyed those who followed the
[1:57:43] way of balum who followed the influence
[1:57:46] of balum to whoredom and idolatry he
[1:57:51] destroyed them all
[1:57:54] but you that stayed close to the
[1:57:58] Lord you that cleaved under the Lord
[1:58:01] little
[1:58:02] bride we've got to stay right up under
[1:58:05] Papa Eagle
[1:58:06] now we can't avoid to get off too far on
[1:58:09] our own little Affair our own little
[1:58:12] journey our own little thing you got to
[1:58:14] stay right up it's close to Papa Eagle
[1:58:17] as you possibly can did you know God
[1:58:21] designed that eagle with five primary
[1:58:23] feathers on the tips of his
[1:58:25] wings that mother or father eagle has
[1:58:29] the ability to do what most birds cannot
[1:58:31] do and that is he has the ability like
[1:58:34] the joints of your
[1:58:36] wrist come on to take those five primary
[1:58:39] feathers and begin just like that cir oh
[1:58:43] I can't do both at the same
[1:58:45] time am I am I doing it am I doing
[1:58:48] it wow thank you for the clap
[1:58:53] cuz I found myself doing different ways
[1:58:56] they have the ability to rotate those
[1:58:58] five primary fingers and it creates a
[1:59:02] centrifugal force in Hebrew it's called
[1:59:07] Nasha it is a a wind that is created and
[1:59:12] what happens is when Papa or Mama Eagle
[1:59:15] are are out on test
[1:59:17] flights they've already been knocked out
[1:59:19] of the nest they've already learned to
[1:59:21] do some flight lying but they're getting
[1:59:23] a little too big for their britches
[1:59:25] sometime and they stray too
[1:59:28] far mama or Papa Eagle will just fly
[1:59:32] right over the top of them and rotate
[1:59:36] those five primary feathers creating a
[1:59:41] centrifugal force that literally
[1:59:45] pulls that little straying Eagle hear me
[1:59:48] anybody here right up under Papa's prote
[1:59:52] chest I'm telling you tonight little
[1:59:55] bride wherever you are whoever's
[1:59:57] watching this I'm telling you that we
[1:59:59] have a tendency to get a little far away
[2:00:02] from Papa
[2:00:04] sometime we need to find our place as
[2:00:08] close to his
[2:00:10] chest don't criticize
[2:00:14] John it is
[2:00:16] listen not John in the Bible or John
[2:00:19] petersheim don't criticize them
[2:00:22] because they have a
[2:00:24] desire to lay their
[2:00:29] head you know I grew up in the Holiness
[2:00:32] Church a a and there was a lot of fire
[2:00:35] then and it wasn't all smoking mirrors
[2:00:37] there was some real
[2:00:39] fire did you ever see Wildfire a lot of
[2:00:43] it but I didn't let that distract
[2:00:47] me because I knew that the real fire was
[2:00:50] also present right you just got to make
[2:00:54] sure that when you're watching the fire
[2:00:56] you're not looking at the
[2:00:58] reflection remember what brother brandom
[2:01:00] said the night the pillar of fire came
[2:01:02] down in the Tabernacle and and took what
[2:01:04] he had written on the board and and put
[2:01:06] it on the wall of the church you go back
[2:01:09] and listen to that the people scream you
[2:01:10] can hear them as they begin to react as
[2:01:13] they begin to see that image transferred
[2:01:16] on the wall do you know what brother
[2:01:18] random said I'm not quoting directly but
[2:01:20] but this is what he said you go back and
[2:01:22] listen to him say it directly he said no
[2:01:24] no no no no not there that's
[2:01:28] right he said that's just a reflection
[2:01:31] right
[2:01:33] there and he pointed them in the right
[2:01:35] direction and they could then see what
[2:01:37] the pillar of fire had done God
[2:01:40] vindicating a
[2:01:41] word but most of the people didn't
[2:01:45] see until somebody pointed it to them
[2:01:48] until he said no no no that's the
[2:01:50] reflection look there there it is
[2:01:52] they were excited about the reflection
[2:01:55] that was not nearly as
[2:02:00] clear and they thought they were looking
[2:02:02] at the
[2:02:03] real until he told them no no no there
[2:02:05] it is look there he said that's how we
[2:02:08] do he helped us understand don't get
[2:02:11] distracted by by the reflection you find
[2:02:14] the real that's right don't be satisfied
[2:02:18] with a painted fire when you can meet
[2:02:20] the real wand
[2:02:23] [Applause]
[2:02:24] yeah cleave let's look at the word
[2:02:27] cleave but ye that did cleave unto the
[2:02:29] Lord your God are alive every one of you
[2:02:31] this day I'm hurrying this is me
[2:02:33] hurrying the word is cleave it's Hebrews
[2:02:36] in the strongs uh
[2:02:39] 1695 in English we would say
[2:02:43] debec it's a clinging to be
[2:02:46] United you that cleaved unto the Lord
[2:02:49] your God you that claimed you clung
[2:02:53] until you were United it means to hold
[2:02:55] to to hold fast to cling to to touch to
[2:02:59] cause to stick
[2:03:02] to you who got
[2:03:07] stuck not fly on the fly
[2:03:12] paper not Mouse in the glue
[2:03:16] trap but you as a sincere hearted
[2:03:20] believer you were spending so much time
[2:03:22] with Christ The Living
[2:03:24] Word because you need to invite him into
[2:03:28] your Bible
[2:03:29] reading you need to invite him into your
[2:03:32] prayer time did you know you can be
[2:03:34] sitting there and reading the book about
[2:03:38] him and missing the fact that he wants
[2:03:41] to be there with you his divine presence
[2:03:44] real you you may think the only time you
[2:03:46] can feel the presence and the quickening
[2:03:49] of the Lord is when you get in a
[2:03:51] corporate Atmos spere I want to tell you
[2:03:53] that's not my most genuine
[2:03:57] moment I'm not here today still standing
[2:04:00] after all of these years because of what
[2:04:03] I had experienced in the
[2:04:06] church that's it's because he has met me
[2:04:10] in the prayer closet he has met me with
[2:04:12] my Bible in my lap he has met me when I
[2:04:15] was hearing the prophet on the
[2:04:17] tape you can't leave out fellows
[2:04:21] [Music]
[2:04:24] ship
[2:04:27] intimacy with
[2:04:33] Christ the preachers get together and we
[2:04:38] argue over
[2:04:41] interpretations whose book is it and are
[2:04:44] they open or not open and are they all
[2:04:47] revealed or not revealed are they all
[2:04:49] fulfilled some fulfilled and not all
[2:04:51] fulfilled
[2:04:54] did Christ fulfill the Passover with his
[2:04:59] birth or with his
[2:05:03] death I could give you a list of aund
[2:05:08] more things that I've been in meetings
[2:05:10] with
[2:05:12] preachers and we found lots of things to
[2:05:15] argue with but there's one thing that we
[2:05:17] never hardly ever experienced
[2:05:22] was the
[2:05:23] reality of
[2:05:25] fellowship with the Living Word because
[2:05:29] as soon as you start
[2:05:33] squabbling I'm sorry I I'm sorry that
[2:05:37] somehow I picked the wrong message for
[2:05:41] tonight something you just can't relate
[2:05:44] to
[2:05:46] perhaps but I've never SE the only time
[2:05:49] I ever saw it is one time at the old
[2:05:51] church in
[2:05:52] Columbus we were having a little
[2:05:54] business meeting I I I think they're
[2:05:56] just about of the
[2:06:00] devil oh it brings out something in
[2:06:03] people sometime have you ever flown on
[2:06:05] an airplane lately you know and and
[2:06:07] those little agents that help you you
[2:06:09] you would think that some of them are
[2:06:11] some of them are so kind and so humble
[2:06:13] but you would think that some of them
[2:06:15] trained under
[2:06:19] Hitler you give them a little authority
[2:06:21] and oh my how they you you you give
[2:06:23] people a little authority sometime when
[2:06:25] you're talking about business and people
[2:06:27] will show you a spirit you didn't even
[2:06:29] know they were capable
[2:06:31] of and we had a little argument one time
[2:06:34] in the back of the church years ago
[2:06:36] before I was married a lifetime ago and
[2:06:39] it was over how many telephone lines we
[2:06:42] were we were subscribing to because in
[2:06:45] those days we were hooking up families
[2:06:47] and churches on the telephone hookup
[2:06:52] and some only had a a a a a thought of
[2:06:56] of of what we had to
[2:06:58] have and I've always been a bit of a
[2:07:02] Visionary and I've always believed that
[2:07:05] it was better to have a little more than
[2:07:07] you need then not enough when you need
[2:07:09] it so we were really having a time you
[2:07:13] know what I should have done I should
[2:07:14] have just ordered the
[2:07:16] lines and paid the
[2:07:19] bill but we wanted people to feel
[2:07:22] apart and and you've never heard it must
[2:07:24] have went on an
[2:07:26] hour and we didn't let the kids or the
[2:07:29] teenagers come in to theit I'm so glad
[2:07:32] they didn't see and hear all of that but
[2:07:35] when we finally ended and we we had to
[2:07:37] go through the sanctuary to
[2:07:40] leave what we didn't know was a prayer
[2:07:43] meeting had been going on in the
[2:07:45] sanctuary and the young people had
[2:07:48] called on the Lord and he had come to to
[2:07:51] their rescue and they were
[2:07:53] fellowshipping with him all over the
[2:07:56] room some laid out under the power of
[2:08:00] God some encountered enough of him they
[2:08:03] had gone into another
[2:08:07] language some were rejoicing and some
[2:08:10] were weeping and some were had
[2:08:13] stammering lips and oh
[2:08:16] my how do the adults who were fighting
[2:08:20] how do they walk through that untouched
[2:08:23] we
[2:08:25] couldn't you see your kids your
[2:08:27] grandkids in the spirit in prayer and
[2:08:30] what do you do you get right down beside
[2:08:32] him and pray through
[2:08:33] yourself and it turned in an argument in
[2:08:36] the back turned into a Revival in the
[2:08:38] front we need a little of
[2:08:42] [Applause]
[2:08:43] that we need a little of that
[2:08:48] again we're slipping some of us are
[2:08:51] drifting some of us have let problems
[2:08:54] cause us to lift our anchor just a
[2:08:57] little bit from the F solid
[2:09:01] foundation some of us have picked up the
[2:09:03] spirit of a Critic hear me Lord shake
[2:09:06] your neighbor just kindly gently wake
[2:09:08] them
[2:09:10] up wake them up they we're not here
[2:09:13] tonight to sleep I tell you what when
[2:09:15] I'm done in just a few minutes and we're
[2:09:17] down there eating dinner sleep then
[2:09:21] you have my permission to sleep then not
[2:09:24] now we're not in the Amish church
[2:09:26] tonight where most everybody
[2:09:28] sleeps we're not there no no no no no no
[2:09:31] we're awake tonight because we want to
[2:09:33] make sure that we haven't fallen off the
[2:09:36] rock we want to make sure that we
[2:09:39] haven't let some argument or some
[2:09:40] distraction or some misunderstanding
[2:09:43] come on
[2:09:44] now we want to make sure that we haven't
[2:09:47] got caught up in the politics
[2:09:51] and missing out on our fellowship you
[2:09:54] know I'm just deser just sensing I
[2:09:56] should say I'm just sensing in my spirit
[2:09:58] that somebody here tonight has fallen
[2:10:00] under a little bit of that Spirit of a
[2:10:03] Critic not not particularly here you've
[2:10:05] got plenty to criticize here but I mean
[2:10:08] something you just kind of brought along
[2:10:10] with
[2:10:11] you and maybe you're sort of looking for
[2:10:13] the perfect
[2:10:15] environment and you're looking for
[2:10:17] Perfect People well well I want you to
[2:10:19] know you're never going to find that
[2:10:21] like that because if a church is nearly
[2:10:24] perfect and you join
[2:10:28] it you're going to affect the track
[2:10:31] record you need to get listen this is
[2:10:34] the key to overcoming in the end time
[2:10:36] some of you have heard me say this many
[2:10:38] many many times number one three keys
[2:10:40] three keys three important powerful
[2:10:43] steps to overcome number one keep your
[2:10:46] eyes on Jesus and off of
[2:10:48] people number two keep your eyes on
[2:10:50] Jesus
[2:10:52] and off of people number three keep your
[2:10:54] eyes on Jesus and off of people I I
[2:10:58] believe it I really believe it brother I
[2:11:00] really believe that we slip off because
[2:11:02] we've got our eyes on somebody else
[2:11:05] don't get them on your pastor don't get
[2:11:07] them on the Deacon don't get them on the
[2:11:09] neighbor don't get them on the
[2:11:12] prophet get them on
[2:11:17] Jesus see how many times you can tell
[2:11:19] somebody Jesus said Jesus said Jesus
[2:11:23] said don't be just a parrot be somebody
[2:11:26] who's had an encounter who's had
[2:11:30] Fellowship not once in your lifetime
[2:11:33] once a day twice a day three times a day
[2:11:39] there's a
[2:11:40] bride who's been called to walk in the
[2:11:46] spirit to keep her head I got to close
[2:11:54] I want to be stuck to this word yes
[2:11:57] sir like a glue like an adhesive the
[2:12:00] rest of that definition to cause to
[2:12:02] stick to like an adhesive to be stuck
[2:12:05] together oh God stick us to you let us
[2:12:08] be so stuck to you w excuse
[2:12:13] me
[2:12:15] Glory I want to be so stuck to
[2:12:20] him I want everybody to
[2:12:22] know that I have been stuck to him that
[2:12:26] means where I go he's there watching
[2:12:29] over he hears what I say he knows what I
[2:12:33] think because he's with me you you've
[2:12:36] got a choice will will you will you make
[2:12:38] up your mind to stay anchored or will
[2:12:41] you
[2:12:42] drift in Ruth chapter 1 ver14 I didn't
[2:12:45] give that to them but I I thought I
[2:12:47] would bring it in because this has uh
[2:12:49] this has a thought that God gave me so
[2:12:51] many years ago that has certainly stayed
[2:12:53] with me and some other people there was
[2:12:55] a time of making a
[2:12:57] decision will we will we stay in
[2:13:00] Moab or will we go back to the land of
[2:13:04] of
[2:13:05] Bethlehem the the land of children's
[2:13:08] bread and there were two
[2:13:10] daughter-in-laws both of them widows now
[2:13:13] Naomi the
[2:13:15] Mother-in-law Ruth Ruth and orpa the
[2:13:20] daughter-in-laws
[2:13:21] they both loved Naomi they both loved
[2:13:23] their mother-in-law that isn't that a
[2:13:25] wonderful
[2:13:26] thing to love your motherin-law
[2:13:29] God help us all we should do that they
[2:13:34] really love
[2:13:37] Naomi and it came Time to Say Goodbye
[2:13:40] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[2:13:42] again and Ora kissed her
[2:13:47] mother-in-law but
[2:13:49] Ruth but
[2:13:51] Ruth
[2:13:54] clave unto her hear
[2:13:59] me it's easy to
[2:14:01] kiss and
[2:14:04] leave it's harder to stick
[2:14:09] around it's harder to say no no no no no

[2:16:30] things in Deuteronomy 4: 3 and 4 it's
[2:16:33] Moses
[2:16:35] talking they've come out of
[2:16:38] Egypt they've got a lot ahead of them
[2:16:41] and he said your eyes have seen what the
[2:16:43] Lord did down there because of ba peor
[2:16:45] for all the men that followed bael peor
[2:16:47] the Lord thy God that destroyed them
[2:16:49] from among you but ye that did cleave
[2:16:52] unto the Lord your God are alive every
[2:16:53] one of you this day well I want to know
[2:16:55] what happened in B peor and I don't have
[2:16:57] much time left tonight to talk about it
[2:17:00] but I'm not leaving just yet I want to
[2:17:02] give you just a little bit in Numbers 22
[2:17:05] 23 24 three chapters read it balum a
[2:17:08] prophet a real Prophet a genuine Prophet
[2:17:11] who got his eyes off of the God who
[2:17:13] called him and got his eyes on the
[2:17:18] paycheck he got his eyes on the paycheck
[2:17:22] and he was hired by by a moabit king
[2:17:26] bailo and bailo tried multiple times to
[2:17:29] get balum to curse Israel and and balum
[2:17:32] tried for the money but God wouldn't let
[2:17:36] him and God forced him
[2:17:40] ha God forced him to prophesy
[2:17:48] good he must have been deeply concerned
[2:17:50] about his
[2:17:52] paycheck and however when the cursing
[2:17:54] failed balam advised Moab and Midian to
[2:17:58] corrupt Israel both the tribe of the
[2:18:01] moabites and the tribe of the midianites
[2:18:03] to come in and corrupt Israel from
[2:18:06] within notice that phrase from
[2:18:10] within not not outside influence but get
[2:18:13] right in among
[2:18:15] them infiltrate their camps become like
[2:18:20] them
[2:18:21] uh uh make yourself friendly until they
[2:18:24] invite you to stay a
[2:18:28] while hospitality is a good
[2:18:31] idea but you ought to know what you're
[2:18:33] doing on when you keep moabites around
[2:18:37] when you keep midianites around
[2:18:42] right balam's Council LED Israel into
[2:18:45] idolatry and fornication at bpor numbers
[2:18:48] 31:16 I think you have it let's see how
[2:18:50] quick we can go behold these caused the
[2:18:52] children of Israel through the Council
[2:18:54] of balum to commit trespass against the
[2:18:56] Lord in the matter of peor and there was
[2:18:59] a
[2:19:00] plague not on
[2:19:03] moabites not on
[2:19:06] midianites but the plague fell where on
[2:19:09] the congregation of the Lord balam
[2:19:12] instructed baac to use women and
[2:19:14] idolatry as a trap for Israel leading to
[2:19:18] the events that took place in b El pure
[2:19:21] Revelation 2:14 red letter Jesus talking
[2:19:24] he said but I have a few things against
[2:19:26] thee because thou Hast there them that
[2:19:28] hold the doctrine of bam right who
[2:19:30] taught bailo to cast a stumbling block
[2:19:33] before the children of Israel to eat
[2:19:35] things sacrificed to unto idols and to
[2:19:37] commit fornication all manner of sexual
[2:19:41] sins pornography self-gratification all
[2:19:45] the things that are taking people
[2:19:47] captive right in the church house
[2:19:52] come on so even without a television
[2:19:55] even without a computer even without a
[2:19:58] telephone the devil is still the
[2:20:03] devil the
[2:20:05] Israelites listen this ultimately cost
[2:20:07] balam his life God's going to deal let
[2:20:09] me tell you he doesn't need you to bring
[2:20:12] the
[2:20:16] Justice it's not your
[2:20:18] job amen
[2:20:21] it's his
[2:20:22] job despite being a prophet who heard
[2:20:25] from God balam chose the path of
[2:20:27] compromise and deception for personal
[2:20:29] gain his actions led to the deaths of
[2:20:33] 24,000 Israelites and eventually he
[2:20:36] himself was killed when Israel defeated
[2:20:39] Midian in numbers 318 I won't take time
[2:20:42] to read it the Israelites were camped at
[2:20:45] Chaim they were seduced into idolatry
[2:20:47] and immorality by the moabit and
[2:20:49] midianite women they ended up listen
[2:20:53] they laid down with a
[2:20:56] heathen and got up worshiping a false
[2:20:59] god I'd like to preach that for two
[2:21:02] hours you can't lay down with the
[2:21:07] world you cannot lay your head in
[2:21:10] Delilah's
[2:21:12] lap and still hope that the spirit of
[2:21:15] God is going to stay with you these men
[2:21:19] laid down with the these horish women of
[2:21:22] median and Moab and the next thing you
[2:21:25] know the scripture said they were
[2:21:26] worshiping the god they were worshiping
[2:21:29] their
[2:21:30] gods the false god of
[2:21:33] bael right in
[2:21:35] pure that provoke the Lord to anger
[2:21:38] brother bandam says in 65 does God ever
[2:21:41] change his mind about his word do I have
[2:21:43] 10 15 minutes good and here we find out
[2:21:47] that balam went down there and he began
[2:21:48] to teach the people and he had an error
[2:21:51] and he run in the way of balam how that
[2:21:53] he did he and taught bailo and the
[2:21:56] children of
[2:21:59] Israel committed
[2:22:02] adultery now the Bible said they
[2:22:04] committed
[2:22:06] fornication brother vom said they
[2:22:08] committed adultery what are you doing
[2:22:09] you're trying to point out somebody's
[2:22:11] Miss oh no no no no you see they were
[2:22:14] married to
[2:22:16] God oh
[2:22:18] yeah so their sexual sin with one
[2:22:20] another was fornication that's right but
[2:22:23] the biggest sin was not the sexual act
[2:22:25] that they committed the biggest sin was
[2:22:28] that they had already sold their
[2:22:30] heart to another
[2:22:32] God and they were stepping
[2:22:36] out on their
[2:22:38] bridegroom it's right it's absolutely
[2:22:42] right he said
[2:22:45] uh the children of Israel committed
[2:22:48] adultery he goes on and a plague struck
[2:22:52] the nation of Israel the people and
[2:22:54] thousands of them died in one day 24,000
[2:22:59] and while they were all there before the
[2:23:00] altar of God
[2:23:06] praying still
[2:23:08] religious still going through the
[2:23:13] motions still doing churchy
[2:23:16] things just a minute I'm going to help
[2:23:18] myself Amen brother Amen brother that's
[2:23:21] exactly right they they were they
[2:23:24] weren't out in The Honky Tonks and the
[2:23:26] hell holes of the world why they were
[2:23:28] standing now at this moment 24,000 of
[2:23:30] their loved ones have dropped
[2:23:33] dead they're they're thinking that maybe
[2:23:35] we've made a big
[2:23:37] mistake but not all of them because in
[2:23:41] the midst of an hour that they should
[2:23:42] have all been on their faces before the
[2:23:43] altar of the Lord uh look what happened
[2:23:47] they were all there before the altar of
[2:23:49] the Lord praying here com an Israel it
[2:23:50] man with a minonite
[2:23:54] woman he took her right into his
[2:23:57] tent brother the random types that to uh
[2:24:00] to to spiritual things and and he said a
[2:24:02] denominational
[2:24:06] woman and went into the tent you hang
[2:24:09] around that stuff long enough even you
[2:24:12] who have been free from it you hang
[2:24:15] around it long
[2:24:16] enough your wife will want to do like
[2:24:18] their wives
[2:24:21] somebody said but there's a great
[2:24:22] Revival there there's a great Revival
[2:24:24] there there's a move of God there
[2:24:25] there's something going on there be
[2:24:27] careful because you hang around it too
[2:24:30] much your children don't want to do what
[2:24:32] their children are
[2:24:34] doing is that okay to say it's too
[2:24:37] late he said went in there with a
[2:24:40] denominational woman and went into the
[2:24:41] tent let's go on and the priest son
[2:24:43] walked over
[2:24:46] there the grandson of Aaron
[2:24:52] Phineas phas in Hebrew not Eli's son
[2:24:59] Phineas another Phineas the grandson of
[2:25:02] Aaron the first high priest he said and
[2:25:05] the priest son walked over there and
[2:25:07] took a
[2:25:12] javelin and killed them both and that
[2:25:16] stayed listen that stayed God's Wrath
[2:25:21] before you take out your
[2:25:24] Javelin you need to know that we're not
[2:25:28] living in that
[2:25:31] dispensation that's
[2:25:33] right God doesn't need you to get
[2:25:36] Vengeance for his
[2:25:39] nameen be not deceived God is Not mocked
[2:25:43] for that which a man shall so he
[2:25:47] shall vengeance is mine amen sayeth the
[2:25:51] Lord but God was so moved by the
[2:25:57] passion God was so sick and tired of
[2:26:00] sick and tired Israelites come
[2:26:03] on God was so tired of lukewarm
[2:26:08] Israelites that when he finally saw one
[2:26:11] with a
[2:26:13] backbone he said that's enough stop the
[2:26:17] plague come on you ought to be that
[2:26:21] one not the one that listen the
[2:26:24] scripture is pretty pretty
[2:26:26] graphic the javel and went right through
[2:26:29] them both the scriptures clear to even
[2:26:32] tell us it went came out of the woman's
[2:26:35] belly skewed them right there in the
[2:26:38] tent and immediately God stopped the
[2:26:41] plague that is not what God is calling
[2:26:43] you to do he's not calling you to
[2:26:45] execute Vengeance in his name however he
[2:26:48] is asking you to be cons
[2:26:50] consumed with the Zeal of the
[2:26:53] Lord to be consumed with the Zeal of the
[2:26:56] Lord's House where is his house not this
[2:27:00] building don't let that be your passion
[2:27:03] only I believe in church I believe in
[2:27:06] being faithful I believe in keeping this
[2:27:08] place as nice as we possibly can I
[2:27:10] believe in that but my passion is not
[2:27:12] for this brick and mortar building no my
[2:27:15] passion is for the house of the
[2:27:17] Lord in you and I we're the temple know
[2:27:20] you not that your body is the Temple of
[2:27:22] the Holy Ghost and and you destroy that
[2:27:24] and God will take care of you that's
[2:27:26] what the word said oh help us now help
[2:27:30] us
[2:27:33] now killed them both but what happened
[2:27:36] balam he succeeded in weakening
[2:27:43] Israel I don't uh pretend to know it
[2:27:48] all I
[2:27:50] have heard enough
[2:27:53] and seen enough to know that there's
[2:27:57] been a lot of
[2:27:58] weakening among those who once stood in
[2:28:01] the strength of the
[2:28:03] word and called Jesus on the
[2:28:06] scene there's been an even a weakening
[2:28:08] in this
[2:28:12] body let me uh show the house to the
[2:28:16] house there's been a weakening Among
[2:28:19] Us our passion for fellowship with him
[2:28:23] is not what it has been you thought it
[2:28:26] was quite a minute ago watch it
[2:28:29] now and it it disturbs me greatly
[2:28:33] because I have observed firsthand what
[2:28:35] happens if one generation Falls away
[2:28:39] from the faith of their
[2:28:41] parents
[2:28:45] amen the next
[2:28:48] generation is more likely
[2:28:51] to fall even farther
[2:28:54] away and farther away and farther away
[2:28:58] if you people some of you precious
[2:29:00] people that have come out of various
[2:29:02] places we all came out of something if
[2:29:04] you've come out of various places I know
[2:29:06] it was not in your heart to find the
[2:29:09] world you came out because you found
[2:29:12] greater
[2:29:14] truth and that's that makes you a Bible
[2:29:16] believer I'm telling you that proves
[2:29:18] you're a Bible believer it proves you
[2:29:20] were more than a church member a church
[2:29:23] member will stay with its church until
[2:29:25] it
[2:29:27] sinks a church member will stand back
[2:29:29] and watch their Church die on the
[2:29:33] vine and won't
[2:29:35] leave because Granny is
[2:29:40] buried in the
[2:29:42] backyard oh I'm coming
[2:29:45] down you've stirred me
[2:29:47] now I'm coming to you right granny is in
[2:29:51] the backyard five generations of people
[2:29:54] sitting in a dead
[2:29:57] church because they gave granny a
[2:30:01] grave I've seen it I've seen it well I
[2:30:06] couldn't leave there I couldn't come out
[2:30:07] of there because they gave my granny a
[2:30:10] grave get her yeah come on you go get
[2:30:14] you a permit and get her and take her
[2:30:17] somewhere else if that's the only way
[2:30:20] you can get out of dead cold formal
[2:30:23] religion Joseph said don't you dare
[2:30:27] leave my
[2:30:28] bones over
[2:30:31] here when you go in take me with
[2:30:37] you can you imagine what they look like
[2:30:39] this bunch of Israelites with camels and
[2:30:41] donkeys
[2:30:43] andp and and and
[2:30:46] Egyptian mummies
[2:30:52] plant me in the land of my promise plant
[2:30:55] me don't let anything hold you back and
[2:30:58] that's why you're where you are that's
[2:30:59] why you've moved where you've moved into
[2:31:01] spiritually is because there was nothing
[2:31:03] so precious to hold you in truth that
[2:31:07] was for another hour or another stage in
[2:31:10] your life and we have no we shouldn't
[2:31:13] spend our the rest of our life
[2:31:14] criticizing where we came from we should
[2:31:17] thank God that he led us down that way
[2:31:19] let me tell you something some of us are
[2:31:21] tougher people stronger committed people
[2:31:25] because we went through so much Church
[2:31:27] stuff we sat under Bishops and
[2:31:30] denominational systems and prejudices
[2:31:35] and yeah it ought to made us stronger
[2:31:38] not weaker
[2:31:40] yes so here's a a breakdown uh quickly
[2:31:43] again Israel God's people his chosen
[2:31:45] people his elected were
[2:31:48] lured into these relationships with
[2:31:50] these Pagan women until God sent a
[2:31:54] plague among them 24,000 people died and
[2:31:56] it would have continued it would have
[2:31:58] continued on until it nearly took them
[2:31:59] all had it not been for one man that
[2:32:02] said enough is enough is enough is
[2:32:04] enough is enough here we are trying to
[2:32:06] get back to God here we are standing
[2:32:08] before the altar of the Lord just hoping
[2:32:11] that he will move among us again and
[2:32:13] what are you doing you're in the tent
[2:32:16] with a horish woman from a Pagan
[2:32:18] religion instead of coming to the
[2:32:21] meeting where you might would have
[2:32:22] gotten a little help what are you
[2:32:26] doing you're in the tent having your
[2:32:29] pleasure and he said no
[2:32:33] more I I would really preach this but I
[2:32:36] know that some of you have a tendency to
[2:32:37] go overboard and so I don't want to be
[2:32:39] guilty of putting a javelin in your
[2:32:46] hand I don't want you to think you can
[2:32:48] win this thing by physical
[2:32:50] amen the violent taking it by force is
[2:32:53] not a physical violence it's a
[2:32:55] desperation and a determination that
[2:32:57] says you're not getting my promise
[2:32:59] you're not getting my Heritage you're
[2:33:01] not getting my
[2:33:02] inheritance I'll wrestle you down you
[2:33:05] foul Spirit of hell I'll kick you right
[2:33:07] where you need to be you won't you will
[2:33:10] not be able to pull me out of that I'm
[2:33:12] not going to slip away I'm not going to
[2:33:15] are you here yes I'm going to put my
[2:33:17] anchor down well we're closing in a
[2:33:23] moment let me just give you this one
[2:33:25] quickly honey Follow Me Oh Lord just
[2:33:27] once more hot
[2:33:30] springs did you know the Roman Catholic
[2:33:33] Church was first the Pentecostal
[2:33:36] Church it taken it 2,000 years to get in
[2:33:40] the condition it's got
[2:33:45] today so when you hear the Catholics say
[2:33:47] we're the original Church brother
[2:33:49] brandom was a proponent of that idea he
[2:33:52] said you could say that the original
[2:33:55] Catholic I don't know that we could say
[2:33:58] Roman but the original Catholic was the
[2:34:01] first
[2:34:03] church the Roman system kicked in much
[2:34:05] later and it took 2,000 years to get it
[2:34:10] in the condition that it's in today but
[2:34:12] now brother bram's not preaching in
[2:34:14] a Catholic
[2:34:16] Church he's preaching where Believers
[2:34:18] are hearing a fresh men
[2:34:20] message and what does he go on to say
[2:34:23] I'm closing
[2:34:26] eventually he said if this Pentecostal
[2:34:30] organization what if we left off the
[2:34:32] word Pentecostal would that be tampering
[2:34:34] with the word what if we just said for
[2:34:37] for instance if this organization keeps
[2:34:40] on another 50
[2:34:44] Years it'll be worse
[2:34:50] we've already got our
[2:34:53] icons we've already got our pictures and
[2:34:55] we've already got all of the little
[2:34:57] things that we love so
[2:34:58] dearly in another 50 years I hate to
[2:35:03] think what some folk would end up to
[2:35:08] be there's got to be a
[2:35:11] bride she's
[2:35:13] here there's got to be a
[2:35:16] bride there is a way back if you have
[2:35:21] let things drift by you if you have
[2:35:23] raised your anchor just a little bit let
[2:35:26] me tell you something leaven it only
[2:35:28] takes a smidgen do you know what that
[2:35:30] means some people say a smidge it only
[2:35:34] takes a
[2:35:35] smidge to get the whole
[2:35:38] lump
[2:35:40] leavened it it only takes a smidge of
[2:35:43] compromise and I'm not talking about
[2:35:45] compromise from man-made rules I'm
[2:35:48] talking about compromise from Biblical
[2:35:52] Holiness that's what we've got to be
[2:35:54] standing on biblical Holiness women like
[2:35:57] women and men like men we've got to
[2:35:59] stand on that because that's what the
[2:36:01] word says and we've got to be careful
[2:36:04] that the distinctions are so noticeable
[2:36:07] and so
[2:36:08] evident that there is no no
[2:36:11] room for for
[2:36:14] speculation and we've got to make sure
[2:36:16] that there's not enough compromise mixed
[2:36:19] in with it that the next generation will
[2:36:21] fall farther from the
[2:36:26] mark because if we're
[2:36:28] drifting what of our
[2:36:30] children what of our grandchildren if
[2:36:33] Jesus
[2:36:34] terries and I'm going to close with this
[2:36:36] musicians are
[2:36:38] coming true sign that's
[2:36:41] overlooked he said whatever you
[2:36:47] do don't you forget my words
[2:36:52] let this
[2:36:55] anchor God take an iron pin and engrave
[2:36:59] it in your heart that you won't forget
[2:37:01] it don't forget it thus sayeth the
[2:37:10] Lord I'm not here to tell you
[2:37:13] tonight about thus saith the
[2:37:17] Lord it's going to sink through the
[2:37:21] to the bottom of the ocean that's
[2:37:22] another
[2:37:24] one and I'm not here to tell you
[2:37:27] tonight any other thus sayith the Lord
[2:37:29] not tonight but this one he said this is
[2:37:31] thus sayeth the Lord return to
[2:37:35] God would you just gently look at your
[2:37:38] neighbor and just say it's thus sayith
[2:37:41] the
[2:37:43] Lord return to
[2:37:45] God with all your hearts yes return to
[2:37:50] God with all your
[2:37:53] hearts whatever you
[2:37:55] do return to God with all your
[2:37:58] heart if you are
[2:38:02] drifting if you realize that some
[2:38:05] troubles came some pressures came some
[2:38:07] in influences came and you you didn't
[2:38:10] you didn't take up anchor you know the
[2:38:16] difference you just lifted it a little
[2:38:22] brother as soon as that anchor comes off
[2:38:24] solid solid
[2:38:26] contact you're at the mercy of the
[2:38:29] Waves you're at the mercy of the
[2:38:33] element oh
[2:38:35] Jesus oh Jesus I wanted to preach
[2:38:38] something to encourage your heart I
[2:38:41] wanted to preach something especially
[2:38:42] you firsttime visitors I wanted to make
[2:38:45] you so happy that you would just smile
[2:38:49] like a a mule eating
[2:38:57] briers but he wouldn't give it to me
[2:39:00] that
[2:39:01] way we can we can all kiss we can all
[2:39:05] you know do the religious thing and say
[2:39:07] oh I love the
[2:39:10] Lord but are you glued to him are you
[2:39:14] cleaving to him are you clinging to him
[2:39:16] do do you do you rondevo with him every
[2:39:19] other week or every Sunday or twice a
[2:39:21] week and then you don't have anything to
[2:39:23] do with him the rest of the time if that
[2:39:25] is the case I want you to know you're
[2:39:27] drifting come on that's right come on
[2:39:30] somebody needs to tell you I it may not
[2:39:32] make me your friend or popular but I
[2:39:34] need to tell you that if you're only
[2:39:36] meeting him at the Gathering
[2:39:40] Place if that's the only time you have
[2:39:43] fellowship with Christ is when you get
[2:39:45] in the presence of other Saints you're
[2:39:47] living low
[2:39:49] way Beneath Your
[2:39:51] Privilege he's an everyday
[2:39:54] God I cannot live today I tell him every
[2:39:59] day I can't live
[2:40:02] today without your
[2:40:05] presence I don't have to dance all the
[2:40:08] time I don't have to shout all the time
[2:40:10] I don't have to talk in tongues all the
[2:40:12] time but I need to
[2:40:14] know that somewhere on the other end of
[2:40:18] my kite stream
[2:40:20] yes even when I can't see him and even
[2:40:23] when I can't hear him I need to know by
[2:40:26] the
[2:40:27] tug how many of you have ever felt that
[2:40:30] tug you got down on your knees to pray
[2:40:33] you could feel the tug on the other end
[2:40:35] of the line you you you you heard a
[2:40:37] message you said I'm going to hear a
[2:40:38] whole message I'm going to hear part of
[2:40:39] a message and you sit down and you say
[2:40:41] Lord speak to me listen we should always
[2:40:43] do it every time you open the Bible you
[2:40:46] ought to talk to the one who give you
[2:40:47] the word the author of the book you
[2:40:49] ought to say Lord come and make this
[2:40:50] real to me today I don't want to just
[2:40:53] read words I don't want to just recite
[2:40:56] words from a page I don't want to just
[2:40:58] quote something with with no life
[2:41:00] attachment I I know that my my answer is
[2:41:03] is to abide in the life of the vine and
[2:41:06] I want you to come and break this with
[2:41:08] me I want you to come and Quicken my
[2:41:10] heart with the reality of your words let
[2:41:12] your words of life oh yes Lord oh yes
[2:41:15] Lord Jesus Oh yes Lord Jesus you're
[2:41:19] either anchored or you're a
[2:41:28] drift when people leave a old-fashioned
[2:41:33] gospel preaching
[2:41:37] group they make the ugliest
[2:41:42] Sinners they make the most awful looking
[2:41:47] Sinners a woman that's never
[2:41:50] painted doesn't know how thank God she
[2:41:54] doesn't even know how and so when she
[2:41:58] gets free she calls
[2:42:01] it she doesn't know how to keep anything
[2:42:04] in
[2:42:06] moderation she she ends up like a
[2:42:11] clown that's not
[2:42:13] Freedom that's
[2:42:15] sinking you're sinking
[2:42:19] you're
[2:42:33] sinking you're either anchored or
[2:42:37] drifting your confidence the Bible says
[2:42:40] casting not away your confidence we're
[2:42:42] supposed to trust and have confidence in
[2:42:44] in our ministers and in our leaders
[2:42:47] and of course we are
[2:42:50] but if your confidence is only in
[2:43:00] flesh you may catch us on a bad
[2:43:05] day because we have them
[2:43:08] sometime I I've I've sat beneath the
[2:43:11] Juniper just like every other
[2:43:15] preacher Mondays are the wor
[2:43:22] worst you hear like a mocking sometime
[2:43:26] of everything you preached the day
[2:43:27] before it's like a cackling of the enemy
[2:43:31] in your
[2:43:32] ear why did you say it that way
[2:43:36] h no one was listening
[2:43:41] anyway every one of us have had that
[2:43:44] juniper tree moment we we've had the the
[2:43:46] the gourd Vine moment
[2:43:51] thank you Lord Jesus every time you send
[2:43:53] a
[2:43:56] worm to crack me on the head with a
[2:43:59] gourd and said now get out from under
[2:44:02] the shade of this thing this place of
[2:44:04] depression and prostration and get out
[2:44:06] there and do what you were called to do
[2:44:08] what you were born to do some of your
[2:44:09] living I know you I know you look Godly
[2:44:12] I know you're precious I know you love
[2:44:13] the Lord I'm talking to New Hope as well
[2:44:16] as anyone else I know that you're
[2:44:18] precious people people you're you're
[2:44:19] you're you're the cream of the crop but
[2:44:22] if you're not anchored you're
[2:44:27] drifting you need to search again for
[2:44:29] the light of that or Lighthouse you
[2:44:33] young people especially I'm telling you
[2:44:35] I know you're always preached that I
[2:44:37] know young people really really sometime
[2:44:39] become a Target I want you to know our
[2:44:42] hope is in you our
[2:44:44] confidence is in you we are depending on
[2:44:48] you
[2:44:50] to
[2:44:51] stand for
[2:44:53] truth you are the generation bombarded
[2:44:56] by the discrepancies and the lies and
[2:44:59] the mockings of this whole world and and
[2:45:02] you you're following a dead man and all
[2:45:04] the things you must fall in love with
[2:45:09] Jesus so that if you ever discover that
[2:45:11] your Prophet was a man
[2:45:20] Elijah was a
[2:45:22] man subject unto like passions as we
[2:45:26] are and yet he prayed that it wouldn't
[2:45:29] rain and guess what it didn't rain if
[2:45:31] you ever discover that your Elijah was a
[2:45:36] man you want to know that you are so
[2:45:39] deeply rooted in your fellowship with
[2:45:42] Christ your anchor has hit the solid
[2:45:46] rock your anchor is not on the church
[2:45:49] age
[2:45:50] book your anchor is on the living
[2:45:53] reality of the
[2:45:55] word you saw Jesus some of you in a way
[2:45:57] you've never seen him before because he
[2:45:59] was raised from the pages of history and
[2:46:02] made a living reality again he healed
[2:46:05] the
[2:46:06] sick rais the dead and he wants to do it
[2:46:09] through
[2:46:11] us you see there's a promise for the
[2:46:13] little end time
[2:46:17] bride maybe you're not holding on to it
[2:46:21] anymore but there's a little girl in
[2:46:25] Ohio who
[2:46:28] is there's a little girl that says
[2:46:30] didn't you say didn't you say that
[2:46:35] go are we drifting or are we
[2:46:39] anchored every one of us who were here
[2:46:41] and heard brother John give that
[2:46:43] testimony of his little daughter none of
[2:46:46] us have ever been able to forget it
[2:46:50] it shamed us all everyone really if you
[2:46:52] think about
[2:46:54] it her faith stronger than ours I'm sure
[2:46:58] she has faced as a child many moments of
[2:47:01] discouragement and disappointment that
[2:47:03] it hasn't been that it's not what but
[2:47:07] listen she's counting on us and we're
[2:47:11] counting on her we've got to stay with
[2:47:13] everything we've got anchored on this
[2:47:15] rock because God said he would send that
[2:47:17] last move just one last move for the
[2:47:20] bride for the bride not a public show
[2:47:22] not for the church at large Not For The
[2:47:24] World At Large his elect one more quick
[2:47:27] powerful
[2:47:31] work spoken word Authority that's
[2:47:34] creative ananas and safiras all around
[2:47:38] he said
[2:47:39] it he said
[2:47:42] it now many of our folk have decided
[2:47:45] that it's all happened and we we've
[2:47:46] missed it somehow
[2:47:48] there's been you know one Miracle out of
[2:47:51] a thousand cases and and and that must
[2:47:54] have been all there was but I I'm not in
[2:47:56] that boat I'm sorry I need to tell you
[2:47:58] I'm not in that boat I happen to believe
[2:48:00] that when this little bride goes out of
[2:48:02] here yes there'll be a quick short work
[2:48:05] with
[2:48:07] her it'll bring hard cases
[2:48:11] in it'll cause some backsliding lukewarm
[2:48:15] people perhaps to get stirred but why
[2:48:17] don't you stir your your
[2:48:19] down let's
[2:48:28] stand my boat of
[2:48:31] Life sails on a troubl

[2:50:43] sky among the Peaks my soul can can be
[2:50:51] found but an unexpected
[2:50:55] storm may drive me from the heights it

[2:53:00] [Music]
[2:53:05] me I've let my fellowship get a little
[2:53:11] affected but I'm calling on the master
[2:53:15] tonight I'm calling on the master
[2:53:18] tonight
[2:53:22] Lord everything I I let slip by me while
[2:53:24] I was in some kind of a
[2:53:27] stuper every message that I was too numb
[2:53:30] to hear
[2:53:31] every every move of the spirit that I
[2:53:34] just couldn't participate in because of
[2:53:37] where I was mentally I I want to
[2:53:40] recapture I want to drop my
[2:53:45] anchor I I've got caught up maybe you're
[2:53:48] you're
[2:53:49] caught
[2:53:50] up family
[2:53:54] drama Church politics
[2:53:57] even something
[2:54:00] has pushed your boat a little off
[2:54:04] course you don't have to spend all
[2:54:07] night you're not
[2:54:11] lost you're just in
[2:54:15] need to stop the drifting
[2:54:19] and let your anchor drop I I I wish that
[2:54:21] somebody
[2:54:23] tonight would make up your mind I'm
[2:54:26] putting the anchor back on the
[2:54:29] Rock I'm not going to let a fence drift
[2:54:33] me I'm not going to let what people
[2:54:35] think about me drift
[2:54:37] me I'm going to find the Solid Ground
[2:54:41] again I'm going to stand on the word and
[2:54:45] watch God keep his promise in my life if
[2:54:48] you're here tonight and you'd say I've
[2:54:50] just gotten a little off course somehow
[2:54:51] in my
[2:54:53] faith I'm not contending like I was once
[2:54:56] contending I i' I've gotten a little
[2:54:59] satisfied just just just slightly a
[2:55:01] little bit out of
[2:55:03] sorts and I want to be anchored I want
[2:55:07] my anchor to grip the solid rock of the
[2:55:10] word like the song we talk about
[2:55:12] sometimes in times like
[2:55:15] these if you feel that way I don't want
[2:55:17] to persuade Ade you this is not a
[2:55:19] denominational altar call but if you
[2:55:21] feel that way tonight I wish you'd just
[2:55:23] come and join those of us who are here
[2:55:25] to worship I wish you'd just get out of
[2:55:27] your seat if you feel comfortable doing
[2:55:30] so no no no even if you don't feel
[2:55:32] comfortable what what am I talking
[2:55:35] about this isn't your living room you
[2:55:38] you feel comfortable in your living
[2:55:40] [Music]
[2:55:42] room if if you feel the
[2:55:45] need just to say to him with you're
[2:55:48] coming I I I'm going to drop it I'm
[2:55:50] going to drop my anchor just a little
[2:55:52] little harder tonight I'm going to find
[2:55:55] the
[2:55:57] course I'm going to ask the Lord's
[2:56:01] Mercy the some of you have let some
[2:56:03] things slip back that you once cast off
[2:56:08] and you've let them slip back into your
[2:56:10] life and Cloud your
[2:56:12] judgment and affect your fellowship with
[2:56:15] him
[2:56:18] no matter what it
[2:56:19] is he knows how to calm that
[2:56:24] storm he knows how to break the
[2:56:27] spirit that's trying to affect your
[2:56:30] fellowship if you believe that say Amen
[2:56:33] let's call on him together right now I
[2:56:35] can't pray for you but I'll pray with
[2:56:37] you father we are gathered here
[2:56:41] tonight with a
[2:56:44] determination to stand firm on your word
[2:56:50] word we don't want to be
[2:56:55] thermometers that only reflect the
[2:56:58] condition of those around
[2:57:00] us we want you to help us to be
[2:57:04] thermostats we want to be so in tune
[2:57:07] with you so fiery with passion for your
[2:57:11] word that we affect the atmosphere
[2:57:14] around
[2:57:16] us let them see Jesus in
[2:57:19] us let others who are weary and who are
[2:57:23] struggling and who are oppressed in
[2:57:26] their mind let them see his light in me
[2:57:30] and let it cause them to swim their
[2:57:35] way back to
[2:57:39] safety Lord we lay before you every
[2:57:44] decision that we have made that has a
[2:57:48] ected our our
[2:57:50] anchor and we ask you to give us Grace
[2:57:53] tonight to correct our path to correct
[2:57:55] our
[2:57:57] course give us spiritually The Passion
[2:58:01] of
[2:58:03] Phineas the Zeal of the
[2:58:06] Lord there is a plague in the
[2:58:10] world but there is a plague in the house
[2:58:13] of the
[2:58:15] Lord and and one man and one woman sold
[2:58:22] out one who will go beyond Lord that's
[2:58:26] all it
[2:58:27] takes one who cries
[2:58:30] out one who will not let the sun go down
[2:58:34] without fellowshipping with
[2:58:36] you and communing with
[2:58:39] you one who will refuse to go two or
[2:58:42] three days without
[2:58:45] connecting they would never go one or
[2:58:47] two days days without water or one or
[2:58:49] two days without food and yet so many of
