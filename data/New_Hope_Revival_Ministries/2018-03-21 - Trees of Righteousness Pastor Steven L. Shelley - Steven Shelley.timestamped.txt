[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Weist
[0:43] in you the hope a lord
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelly from New
[1:04] Hope revival ministries in Smith Station
[1:07] Alabama and I'm coming to you again
[1:09] today on behalf of brother Eric Erickson
[1:12] and the entire staff of the gospel
[1:15] channel I'm just delighted for what the
[1:19] Lord is doing through Christian
[1:22] television in this hour you know there's
[1:25] not a lot of good things that can be
[1:27] seen on television around the world but
[1:30] I am so thankful to know that the gospel
[1:33] of Jesus Christ is being proclaimed and
[1:36] I counted a privilege and an honor to
[1:39] come to you today representing the
[1:42] kingdom of God coming to you to talk
[1:45] about the love and the grace of the Lord
[1:48] Jesus Christ and we want you to continue
[1:51] to support the gospel channel however
[1:54] the Spirit of the Lord might lead you I
[1:56] know that there are many faithful
[1:59] partners watching this program today and
[2:01] through the years you have sewn your
[2:04] finances to the gospel channel and you
[2:07] by the grace of God are part of the
[2:10] reason why they have been going strong
[2:13] for all of these years and we are
[2:16] constantly praying and believing God for
[2:18] even further expansion we're just
[2:21] excited when we hear from the saints of
[2:24] God across the UK and Scandinavia we're
[2:28] beginning to air also on Omega in
[2:31] Iceland there's just so many exciting
[2:35] things that are taking place and we're
[2:37] just very very thankful that this little
[2:40] ministry has a part you know there's a
[2:43] song that means a lot to me and it has
[2:46] for many many years it concerns our will
[2:50] you know our self will can be a very
[2:54] very strong thing and I believe there's
[2:57] a lot of grace available to us to be
[3:01] able to lay down our will and to take up
[3:04] the will of God but sometimes it's only
[3:07] through brokenness
[3:09] that we truly make the full surrender
[3:11] that is necessary I think about the life
[3:15] of so many of God's generals one
[3:18] particular man of God comes to mind the
[3:22] ministry of brother William Branham and
[3:24] how that before his great ministry that
[3:27] became a worldwide ministry was launched
[3:30] there was a lot of brokenness in his
[3:32] life
[3:33] he had a lot of sacrifices to make and
[3:36] there were a lot of changes that had to
[3:38] take place and I believe that through a
[3:41] lot of that suffering and pain his will
[3:44] was completely broken and laid aside and
[3:47] I believe it was then that the Lord
[3:49] Jesus Christ could step into him as his
[3:53] vessel and use him with an international
[3:56] ministry that is still impacting lives
[3:58] even today and there were many other
[4:00] great men of God and women of God who
[4:05] met a lot of sorrow along the way but
[4:08] because of that sorrow they emptied
[4:11] themselves of their own will and their
[4:14] desire and they allowed the Lord to come
[4:16] and live his life through them I'm not
[4:19] saying that's necessary in every life
[4:22] maybe you are someone who just has a lot
[4:26] of grace to be willing to quickly lay
[4:28] aside your opinion and your thoughts in
[4:31] your will and do the will of God but I
[4:34] have to say it hasn't always been that
[4:36] way with me I've known my share of
[4:39] separations I've known my share of grief
[4:43] and sorrow but I want you to know
[4:45] through it all if I could go back I
[4:48] don't know if I would change a bit of it
[4:51] because every step of the way the Lord
[4:54] Jesus Christ has been near he has been
[4:57] real he has been precious and as the
[5:01] song says the longer I serve him the
[5:04] sweeter he grows when I started out to
[5:07] carry the gospel it's just a small boy
[5:10] many years ago over 40 years ago the
[5:15] grace of God was with me then and I
[5:18] often pray to prayer and sung a song
[5:20] whatever it
[5:22] for my will to break that's what I'll be
[5:26] willing to do a few weeks ago at our
[5:29] little Church in Alabama I sunned that
[5:32] song and I'd like to share it with you
[5:34] by the songwriter Lanny wolf whatever it
[5:38] takes for my will to break Oh Lord
[5:41] that's what I'll be willing to do I hope
[5:45] it'll bless you there's a voice calling
[5:56] me from an old rugged tree and it
[6:04] whispers draw closer to me
[6:12] [Music]
[6:16] world far behind there are new heights
[6:21] to climb and a new life in me you will
[6:30] find

[6:38] it takes to draw me closer

[9:03] hands

[9:15] away Lord I'll go and your will

[10:05] willing to do take the dearest things to
[10:16] me if that's how it must be

[13:24] [Applause]
[13:25] [Music]
[13:28] for whatever
[13:32] it takes for my will to breathe
[13:41] take that's what I'll be willing to do
[13:55] yes amen I hope you appreciated the
[13:59] words to that song I think a lot of us
[14:02] can look back over our lives and see
[14:05] those junctions in time when we had to
[14:09] yield a little more of ourselves when we
[14:12] first start out to serve the Lord we are
[14:15] determined to give him everything but
[14:17] there comes times when he requires
[14:20] something of us and we clinch it with a
[14:22] tight fist and because of that there is
[14:26] a breaking that has to take place I'm
[14:29] not going to sell you some glorious life
[14:34] that has no price tag I know the truth
[14:38] is jesus paid it all the truth is
[14:41] salvation is free but I've said for many
[14:44] years a call of God on your life will
[14:48] cost you everything and I just have to
[14:51] believe that there are many of you
[14:53] watching this program today that you
[14:55] didn't start out just to be a church
[14:57] member but you started out because you
[15:00] were wooed and called and drawn by the
[15:03] Holy Spirit of God and you wanted more
[15:06] than just a Sunday religion you wanted
[15:09] to walk the supernatural life that
[15:12] perhaps you read about him the Word of
[15:14] God I know there are so many
[15:17] denominations in the world today and so
[15:20] many different ideas about what God can
[15:23] and cannot do today what He desires to
[15:27] do or maybe he doesn't want to do yet
[15:29] today but when I read the book of Acts I
[15:32] don't find anything in there that God is
[15:35] not willing to do for us and through us
[15:39] today if we can have faith to believe
[15:41] yes I believe that he is the same
[15:44] yesterday and today and forever and I
[15:49] still believe that through Jesus Christ
[15:51] there is power to heal the sick to cast
[15:55] out devils and to raise the dead in my
[15:59] early ministry as an attendant
[16:01] evangelist traveling up and down the
[16:03] East Coast
[16:04] sometimes dragging an old canvas tent
[16:07] and a bus with a trailer behind it I
[16:10] wasn't old enough to drive even in those
[16:13] days and always had a staff with me who
[16:16] would help to drive and to put up the
[16:18] tent I saw miracles and I know those
[16:21] miracles are still available today in
[16:24] the same way that they were all 30-plus
[16:27] years ago I saw the blind eyes open and
[16:31] the deaf ears unstopped I've seen
[16:34] cancerous tumors fall off under the
[16:36] floor in a service where someone was
[16:39] receiving prayer I've seen God or
[16:42] swallowed and I've seen massive growths
[16:44] in someone's stomach deflate by the
[16:49] authority of Jesus Christ in such a
[16:52] manner that women would leave the
[16:54] service holding their clothes because
[16:56] they they instantly had such a change in
[17:00] their physical body when the tumor
[17:03] disappeared I've seen God do so many
[17:07] wonderful things and I know that he is
[17:10] still able this perhaps may not be the
[17:12] the age or the season of divine healing
[17:17] with the miracles that that we saw in
[17:20] America in the UK and the great revivals
[17:23] of the 50s and 60s but it's not because
[17:26] God has changed it's not because Jesus
[17:30] is no longer doing these kinds of things
[17:32] or no longer desires to do them it's
[17:36] because so much has changed with the
[17:38] church and so much has changed with what
[17:41] people are willing to dare to believe
[17:44] God to do why don't you turn your faith
[17:47] loose here you have just worshipped
[17:50] agreed with a song whatever it takes
[17:52] Lord for my will to break so you're
[17:55] submitting your will to him saying Lord
[17:58] not my will but your will be done and
[18:02] while you're in a moldable and pliable
[18:05] moment like this why don't you go ahead
[18:08] and dare to believe that anything you
[18:12] need God to do in your life he is able
[18:15] and
[18:16] willing to do perhaps he has a divine
[18:19] appointment with you right now and
[18:21] that's why there is a gospel channel
[18:24] that's why there's a new hope revival
[18:26] ministries that's willing to come by
[18:30] means of the gospel channel and speak
[18:32] into your life I know that with the
[18:35] fast-paced life that people live today
[18:38] to sit in front of the television for a
[18:41] solid hour and hear a gospel message
[18:43] it's not what everybody wants to do and
[18:47] yet there you are and many of you are
[18:50] not just sitting here today watching
[18:53] this program but you have watched other
[18:55] programs here on the gospel channel some
[18:59] that we have done and and many others as
[19:02] well why is that is it because you're
[19:05] bored and you have nothing else to do I
[19:07] don't think that's it I think that God
[19:12] has an appointment with you I think
[19:14] you're hungry for the things of the Lord
[19:17] I think you desire I think there's some
[19:20] of you watching today who have a hunger
[19:22] that you don't even know how to explain
[19:24] or Express I think there's some of you
[19:29] that that have a closeted hunger in
[19:31] other words I think that you keep it to
[19:34] yourself
[19:35] maybe you go to church with a wonderful
[19:38] group of people but you don't tell
[19:40] anybody just how hungry you are for the
[19:43] deeper things of God and how you desire
[19:47] to see God move in your life in a
[19:49] supernatural way as we have heard about
[19:52] him doing in time past and we've read
[19:56] about him doing in the scripture maybe
[19:58] you're a little embarrassed to let your
[20:00] Sunday School class members know that
[20:03] that you're just tired of Church as
[20:06] usual there's something deep stirring
[20:09] within you and so you get your you you
[20:12] get a little fix you get a little
[20:14] stirring when you meet us here on the
[20:18] gospel channel you know that's perfectly
[20:21] all right but I can tell you right now
[20:23] but eventually when you get full of
[20:26] God's Word you begin to feel
[20:29] his life working in you in a personal
[20:31] and supernatural way you will not be
[20:34] able to keep it to yourself your very
[20:37] life your very character the atmosphere
[20:41] that you carry when you go out it will
[20:44] certainly betray you
[20:46] it will certainly eventually get out on
[20:49] you they're going to know and this is
[20:51] exactly how it's supposed to work any
[20:55] ministry that we do even any witnessing
[20:59] that we do for the cause of Christ it
[21:02] should be an overflow of what God is
[21:06] doing in our life personally as
[21:08] individuals it's not just about learning
[21:13] more so that we can do more it's really
[21:17] about becoming more of what God wants us
[21:21] to become it's it's a transformation
[21:25] that takes place and with transformation
[21:28] often there is a commissioning I'd like
[21:31] to share a portion of Scripture with you
[21:34] today that's not going to be uncommon to
[21:36] you in fact I think just about everybody
[21:40] knows the story of Moses and how he
[21:44] stood before that great bush that was
[21:47] burning with fire and yet it was not
[21:49] consumed but let's look at it today
[21:52] maybe we will have the grace to make it
[21:55] a little more personal Exodus chapter 3
[21:59] beginning in verse 2 and the angel of
[22:02] the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of
[22:05] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[22:10] looked and behold the bush burned with
[22:13] fire and the bush was not consumed and
[22:17] Moses said I will now turn aside and see
[22:22] this great sight why the bush is not
[22:26] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[22:30] turned aside to see God called unto Him
[22:34] out of the midst of the bush and said
[22:37] Moses Moses and he said here am I
[22:41] and he said draw not nigh hither put off
[22:46] thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[22:49] place whereon thou standest is holy
[22:53] ground holy ground
[22:57] I like this encounter that Moses had
[23:01] with God very much because there are so
[23:04] many lessons that can be applied in
[23:06] principles that can be understood in our
[23:10] own life when God desires to transform
[23:14] us by the word I think most every
[23:19] program that we have done thus far for
[23:22] the gospel channel has been focusing
[23:26] around the Word of God let me remind you
[23:30] today that when I say the Word of God
[23:32] I'm not just referring to the Bible
[23:36] which is the written record of God's
[23:39] Word it is inspired of God recorded by
[23:45] holy men of God who were moved upon by
[23:49] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[23:53] anything man touches translates
[23:57] reproduces it can sometimes get the
[24:00] fingerprint of man even the translators
[24:04] had choices decisions to make when they
[24:09] were choosing English words for words
[24:12] that had been recorded in Greek and some
[24:15] of them recorded in Aramaic and Hebrew
[24:18] but this Bible contains the infallible
[24:23] Word of God without mistake but I'm not
[24:28] just talking about the printed record of
[24:31] God's Word we've been also emphasizing
[24:35] the person of the word his name is the
[24:40] Lord Jesus Christ he is Yeshua our
[24:45] Messiah our salvation our deliverer he
[24:50] is the Living Word recently when you and
[24:54] I were together
[24:55] here on the broadcast we mentioned John
[24:58] chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was
[25:01] the word and the Word was with God and
[25:04] the Word was God
[25:07] skipping down some verses it says and
[25:11] the word became what which word the word
[25:16] that was with God the word that was God
[25:18] that same word became flesh and dwelt
[25:23] among us and we beheld his glory as of
[25:27] the only begotten of the Father full of
[25:29] grace and truth so our Lord Jesus Christ
[25:33] was a perfect representation of the
[25:36] Father while in the earth it's a
[25:40] beautiful thing that the word the logos
[25:44] could become flesh in the body of our
[25:48] Lord Jesus Christ that same eternal
[25:50] spirit that said let there be light
[25:54] that same voice that cried out out of
[25:58] the darkness let there be light that is
[26:01] the same spirit that is the same voice
[26:04] that was embodied in our Lord Jesus
[26:08] Christ and that same spirit and that
[26:12] same voice and that same presence that
[26:16] same Living Word can now be in the life
[26:20] of the believer by the baptism of the
[26:24] Holy Ghost and a full surrender to every
[26:28] word of God that means that in you can
[26:33] be the voice of God in you can be the
[26:37] presence of God in you can live and move
[26:41] and dwell the very life and the very
[26:44] Spirit of the Almighty God the same
[26:48] anointing the same manifest presence
[26:51] that was in the Lord Jesus Christ is
[26:54] available to the believer you say wait a
[26:58] minute preacher where do you get an idea
[27:01] like that from the written record of
[27:03] God's Word otherwise known as the Bible
[27:05] the
[27:06] book reveals to us that God chose a
[27:11] temple as a symbol
[27:14] he chose a tabernacle first as a symbol
[27:18] he even chose his own earthly body as a
[27:23] symbol all speaking to us he took his
[27:27] own physical body and used it in
[27:30] teaching examples for instance when he
[27:33] said you see that temple you can tear it
[27:35] down and in three days my father will
[27:37] race it up again many did not understand
[27:41] that he was talking about his body the
[27:44] temple of the eternal spirit of the
[27:47] Father remember how the scripture bears
[27:49] that out so all of these dwelling places
[27:52] of God Tabernacle temple even in the
[27:56] body of our precious Lord Jesus Christ
[27:58] all of these things were pointing to
[28:01] what God was looking for and that was he
[28:05] desired to Tabernacle to indwell
[28:08] to come and live inside more than one
[28:13] house not just one tabernacle one temple
[28:17] one body of our Lord Jesus Christ but as
[28:21] the New Testament teaches us he was
[28:23] looking for a many membered body he was
[28:27] looking for a corporate group of people
[28:30] that he could individually live inside
[28:34] of bringing the fullness of all that he
[28:38] is not just all that he was but all that
[28:42] he is he brings that when he comes to
[28:45] live inside of you that is a
[28:48] supernatural life that's more than
[28:51] Church anity and that's more than
[28:53] Christianity light that is the full
[28:57] expression of what God is looking for in
[28:59] the end time we should focus on him in
[29:05] this hour when things are so uncertain
[29:08] around us we need a bright spot in our
[29:11] life we need an everyday walk an
[29:15] everyday relationship and experience
[29:18] with Jesus car
[29:19] I was speaking to the church last night
[29:22] Tuesday night is our midweek service
[29:25] instead of Wednesday night and I was
[29:28] wanting to make sure that they knew that
[29:30] I have the same struggles that they have
[29:32] at time to get above my emotions to get
[29:37] above my circumstances I mean I can get
[29:40] upset I can get angry I can get
[29:43] discouraged I can get frustrated it's a
[29:46] good thing my wife isn't here because
[29:48] she'd be saying the loudest Amen it
[29:51] happens in our natural life but I've
[29:53] learned that I have a choice I mean I am
[29:58] the only one who can make the choice to
[30:00] get above that and to hear what God is
[30:03] trying to say to me in every situation
[30:07] that I face in life I have to be honest
[30:10] with you and tell you that some of the
[30:12] greatest instructions or strategies that
[30:17] I have received from the Lord in my
[30:19] entire ministry have come on the heels
[30:23] of the seasons of the greatest
[30:26] frustration I have ever known so
[30:29] frustrated that I didn't know whether to
[30:32] go to the ride or go to the left in fact
[30:34] I really didn't want to go either way
[30:35] just wanted to stop going and all and in
[30:39] that moment realizing what is going on
[30:43] what am i allowing the enemy to do what
[30:47] am i allowing my own mind to do to me
[30:50] and when we get to that place and were
[30:53] able to recognize it we come to
[30:55] ourselves it's an awakening just like
[30:59] the prodigal son down in the Pigpen all
[31:03] of a sudden he came to himself and he
[31:05] said what am I doing here
[31:07] my father has hired servants that are
[31:10] eating higher on the hog you can excuse
[31:13] the pun they're eating a little higher
[31:15] on the hog than I am I'm in the Pigpen
[31:17] they're eating beautiful food at
[31:20] father's house and they're just servants
[31:23] I believe I'll go home I'll ask father
[31:27] to forgive me and I won't ask him to
[31:30] restore me to sonship I'll just ask
[31:33] - let me be as one of the hired servants
[31:35] you know how the rest of the story went
[31:38] the father wouldn't hear of his own son
[31:41] being a hired servant and so he brought
[31:45] the ring and the robe that signet ring
[31:48] that would give the son restored
[31:51] authority to conduct business in the
[31:53] house of the father and on behalf of the
[31:56] father and that robe of acceptance and
[31:59] he killed the fatted calf and made a
[32:02] feast there was so much of a doodoo was
[32:06] made that the elder brother looking on
[32:08] he got quite jealous didn't he we have
[32:12] those awakening moments sometime when we
[32:15] are so frustrated we don't know which
[32:17] way to go
[32:18] we don't know what we're supposed to be
[32:20] doing and all of a sudden we just get
[32:22] quiet we just say lord help me let me
[32:26] find grace in your sight and we come to
[32:30] that moment of awakening it's like a
[32:32] light bulb turns off but we say hey wait
[32:34] a minute
[32:35] Lord you have this you've got the
[32:38] instruction and so the truth is some of
[32:40] the greatest strategy and direction that
[32:42] I've ever received for ministry has come
[32:46] at the end of a season like that where I
[32:49] just was almost to the point of putting
[32:52] up my hands in the air and saying I give
[32:54] up I just quit never desiring to give up
[32:58] on my relationship with the Lord but
[33:00] just deciding hey I just don't want to
[33:03] work all all the time and every day of
[33:05] my life for the kingdom of God you can
[33:08] feel quite unappreciated you can get all
[33:10] kinds of emotions going on you
[33:12] experience it in your own family life
[33:14] the enemy tells you nobody cares you go
[33:18] out of the house every day and nobody
[33:20] would hardly care if you didn't come
[33:21] back through the door at night the
[33:23] devil's got lies for every circumstance
[33:26] every situation that's going on he knows
[33:30] how to put his finger on it and tell you
[33:32] all kinds of things about it but his
[33:34] opinion doesn't amount to a hill of
[33:36] beans
[33:37] it's what God's word has to say and the
[33:41] Bible says with every temptation he'll
[33:43] make a way of escape in the Bible tells
[33:46] us if the
[33:46] trying of our faith this trying of our
[33:49] patience is working in us
[33:52] a greater glory a greater transformation
[33:58] so that we can discover and fulfill the
[34:02] real reason why we were born we talked
[34:07] about that the last time we were
[34:08] together now getting back to our text
[34:11] Moses is standing here on the mountain
[34:14] maybe looking for something you know he
[34:18] was a shepherd after all and the angel
[34:21] of the Lord appears to him in a flame of
[34:24] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[34:28] looked and he saw that this bush was on
[34:30] fire and yet the bush itself was not
[34:33] being consumed God was really speaking
[34:37] to Moses about his own life he was
[34:40] really telling Moses if I put my fire on
[34:43] you
[34:44] I'll burn out the interior I'll refine
[34:49] your character I'll burn out the dross
[34:53] in your life but I won't destroy you you
[34:57] know there's a fire that destroys and
[35:00] there's a fire that refines and the
[35:03] Bible talks about both of them and
[35:05] they're both fire but God wants to fill
[35:09] his servants with refining fire fire
[35:14] that burns out the dross fire that
[35:17] purifies us like gold this is what the
[35:20] scripture talks about the fiery furnace
[35:23] of affliction and trials I just have a
[35:26] feeling if you've been watching this
[35:29] program this long you're probably one of
[35:32] those that spent some time in the fiery
[35:34] furnace of affliction but didn't God
[35:37] come can't you testify to your neighbor
[35:41] that he came we had a precious sister in
[35:45] our church many years ago who has gone
[35:47] on to be with the Lord an
[35:49] african-american sister and she used to
[35:52] saying he may not come when you warn him
[35:55] but he's right on time
[35:57] and you know I found this to be true in
[35:59] my life
[36:00] maybe the first time I call it seems
[36:03] that he doesn't come but he comes he
[36:07] comes in his timing and Kent most of you
[36:11] watching this program and when I say
[36:13] most of you I mean if you can't if you
[36:17] can't recognize that God has come to
[36:20] your rescue it's simply because you
[36:22] haven't taken the time to consider it if
[36:25] you started taking time to consider the
[36:27] dark moments of your life you called on
[36:30] the Lord maybe your circumstances didn't
[36:33] change immediately
[36:34] maybe they didn't change at all but he
[36:37] came and he strengthened you and he
[36:40] undergirded you and he poured grace over
[36:43] your life and you kept going
[36:46] there are many elderly people who depend
[36:49] on the gospel Channel for their church
[36:52] for their fellowship they hear the word
[36:55] and receive the anointing of the Lord
[36:57] unable to go out and maybe weather
[37:00] changes or our some are shut-in and not
[37:03] able to go out at all and if we could
[37:06] turn this camera around and put a
[37:08] microphone in the hand of the saints of
[37:12] God many of which again watching this
[37:14] program right now and allow them to give
[37:17] their personal testimonies I know that
[37:20] everyone watching would be encouraged
[37:22] when you begin to hear of the
[37:25] faithfulness of God we read it in the
[37:28] Bible
[37:29] but when we when we began to hear it in
[37:32] our own time that God has been faithful
[37:36] he wants us to have an encounter with
[37:40] him that settles some issues maybe
[37:44] there's some doubts maybe there's still
[37:47] still some struggles going on in your
[37:49] life and I don't know that God will call
[37:52] you up on the mountain and appear to you
[37:54] out of a bush but he'll meet you he'll
[37:57] meet you in your living room right now
[37:59] he'll meet you in the parlor wherever
[38:03] you're sitting right now the presence of
[38:05] the Lord is willing to meet you if you
[38:08] call on him in faith believing I believe
[38:11] that he can meet
[38:13] you and that he will meet you and that
[38:15] he desires to meet you it's important to
[38:19] recognize his faithfulness to us in the
[38:21] past it's also important that when God
[38:24] begins to do things in our life now we
[38:26] recognize it and we honor him and we
[38:29] begin to give him thanks I like what
[38:32] Moses did Moses saw this angel of the
[38:35] Lord
[38:36] appearing to him in a flame of fire
[38:38] calling out to him and Moses said a very
[38:43] smart thing I might add I will now turn
[38:46] aside and see this great sight why the
[38:50] bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw
[38:55] that Moses was going to to take some
[38:57] time and we need to take some time to
[39:00] turn our attention toward God and what
[39:03] he desires to say to us in this in this
[39:06] life and in this moment in our lives
[39:08] that's why we've spent so many programs
[39:11] emphasizing the word it's because this
[39:15] is one of the major ways that God shows
[39:19] up in our life is by the written record
[39:22] of his word which leads us to a
[39:26] relationship with Christ the Living Word
[39:28] this this Bible this written record of
[39:33] the word has the ability and the
[39:35] potential to do to cause a change to
[39:41] begin to take place in your life leading
[39:44] you to that real encounter with the
[39:47] Living Word one verse of scripture by
[39:51] inspiration by the Holy Spirit allowing
[39:54] it to become a revelation to you I tell
[39:58] you it's like lighting the fire it's
[40:00] like a spark catching on you're reading
[40:04] it and all of a sudden it becomes alive
[40:05] to you and it's like it's spreading
[40:08] through the layers of your soul mind
[40:11] will and emotion I tell you sometimes I
[40:15] just take the Bible and ask the Lord
[40:17] where he would have me to read what He
[40:19] desires to say to me from the word and
[40:21] before it's over I'm on my knees because
[40:24] he speaks so
[40:26] roundly from his word I don't want you
[40:29] to think that it's only your interaction
[40:33] with a written page that I'm preaching I
[40:36] want you to understand that God wants to
[40:39] meet you at the printed page of his word
[40:42] but he wants to show up in your life as
[40:45] much much more than just a printed page
[40:49] he wants to show up in your life as a
[40:52] living reality and your response this is
[40:56] one of the things that we have
[40:57] emphasized in our programs together is
[41:00] that our response to the word is vitally
[41:06] important to position us to have a real
[41:11] encounter with the Living Word when we
[41:15] read and God begins to say this is this
[41:17] is something I want to lead you toward
[41:19] we read it and we can say wait I hear
[41:21] this now I'm reading this this makes
[41:23] sense I think this is what God wants to
[41:25] do in my life
[41:26] follow that pray into that what does
[41:29] that mean preacher it means all right
[41:31] lord I read right here that you want to
[41:35] establish me in righteousness as you're
[41:39] planting in the same manner that that
[41:42] someone who owns an orchard would plant
[41:46] a tree and with the expectation after
[41:51] planning that tree that it's going to
[41:53] require nurture and its nurture and it's
[41:56] going to require care and it's going to
[42:00] require labor but in the end there is
[42:04] the expectation that that tree is going
[42:07] to bear fruit and the fruit is going to
[42:11] be determined by the kind of tree that
[42:14] is planted and when we recognize that
[42:17] the Scriptures teach that we are the
[42:19] righteous planting of the Lord we are
[42:22] the trees let me say it in an easier way
[42:25] we are the trees of righteousness that
[42:29] God is planting in the earth in this
[42:33] last hour
[42:34] all right you read that in the Bible you
[42:36] read say for instance you're reading and
[42:39] you
[42:39] someone where God talks about the
[42:42] righteous man the godly man again being
[42:45] like a tree bringing forth fruit in the
[42:48] right season etc and Yuri then and then
[42:50] you begin to say Lord you said in your
[42:54] word you wanted men to be godly and that
[42:57] you wanted to establish them as your
[42:59] planting in the earth and you wanted to
[43:02] display your righteousness through your
[43:07] orchard through your planted trees it's
[43:10] its symbols I understand but it's a
[43:14] powerful way to pray I read here where
[43:17] you said that
[43:18] and so Lord I'm gonna claim that for
[43:22] myself and then it becomes a prayer and
[43:25] not just a verse of scripture you talk
[43:28] about I hope you I hope this doesn't
[43:30] sound absolutely fanatical to you but if
[43:33] it does I'm almost I'm almost ready to
[43:37] apologize but not quite because I think
[43:40] there's enough of you that have never
[43:42] tried this you've never tried it
[43:44] for instance Psalm 1 it says and he
[43:48] shall be this is blessed is the man
[43:51] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[43:53] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[43:56] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[43:58] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[44:00] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[44:02] doth he meditate day and night and verse
[44:05] 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by
[44:08] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[44:11] his fruit in his season his leaf also
[44:14] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[44:17] shall prosper
[44:18] that's more than a poem that's more than
[44:22] a dusty old poem it's actually a
[44:24] beautiful poem but it's so much more
[44:27] than that it's the living promise of God
[44:30] it's the utterance it was actually a
[44:33] spiritual utterance through the psalmist
[44:35] it was a song sung unto the Lord and it
[44:40] was prophetic in the sense that it was
[44:43] revealing to us the heart and the mind
[44:45] of God
[44:46] so let me let me make it personal in the
[44:50] heart and mind of God
[44:52] it is his will and desire for you to be
[44:56] a man a woman that walketh not in the
[45:00] counsel of the ungodly you don't receive
[45:02] your counsel from the ungodly you you
[45:06] find your counsel in the Word of God
[45:08] when you need advice when you need
[45:11] answers to life's questions you find it
[45:14] in the word or you seek out those who
[45:17] have given their lives to the Word of
[45:19] God so that they can give you counsel
[45:21] based on the word not based on the
[45:25] current trend it is the will of God for
[45:28] us not to stand in the way of sinners
[45:30] that simply means we have to be careful
[45:33] about who we make covenant with and who
[45:36] we make commitment and and this kind of
[45:40] connection for instance in marriage in
[45:43] business the Bible said we should not be
[45:46] unequally yoked together with
[45:47] unbelievers but it doesn't mean that we
[45:50] shouldn't be a witness it doesn't mean
[45:52] that we shouldn't minister and love and
[45:55] we should be light Jesus was not ashamed
[45:58] to eat with sinners he didn't think that
[46:02] it was going to defile him to to show
[46:06] himself a light to those who are walking
[46:08] in darkness but this scripture means
[46:11] we're not going to make covenant with
[46:14] with sinners we're gonna be joined with
[46:17] other righteous trees we're going to
[46:20] join ourselves with other right if
[46:21] you're looking for a companion in life
[46:23] you're not going to find a godly
[46:26] companion in the pub in the bar
[46:28] somewhere drunk on a stool if you're a
[46:31] godly man you're not going to find a
[46:34] godly woman in a place like that you're
[46:36] going to find the companion that God has
[46:39] for you and you're going to recognize
[46:42] that person because they're going to be
[46:44] seeking for the same thing you're
[46:45] seeking for desiring the same thing that
[46:48] you're desiring so it means we it is not
[46:50] your Will O God for me to to coven it
[46:53] with sinners in that manner or to sit in
[46:56] the seat of the scornful my my lord it
[46:59] is not your will for me to be scornful
[47:02] and critical and
[47:04] you know have an unnecessary and
[47:06] unwanted opinion about everything until
[47:09] I become so cynical and so critical this
[47:12] is a very common thing for all of us in
[47:14] this hour we can we can get influenced
[47:18] by news and we can get influenced by
[47:20] fake news and we can become so scornful
[47:24] until we we just see the the rotten in
[47:28] everything god it's not your will for me
[47:31] to be that way but but you said right
[47:33] here Lord that you'd if I'm going to be
[47:36] righteous I should find my delight in
[47:40] your instruction King James says law
[47:43] that word law is the instructions of God
[47:46] does that sound archaic this that sounds
[47:49] so old-fashioned that you can't grasp
[47:52] that God right now 2018 God wants us to
[47:58] find our instructions for life in this
[48:01] written record of his word and through
[48:04] our encounters with Christ the Living
[48:06] Word you're never going to receive
[48:09] anything in your relationship with the
[48:11] Living Word that's contrary to the
[48:14] written record of his word because he is
[48:16] one with his word he wants to give us
[48:20] instructions even today so as you're
[48:23] praying this you'd say Lord your word
[48:26] says that you'd that that you it is your
[48:29] desire for the righteous to delight in
[48:32] your instruction and you said here that
[48:35] in that instruction the righteous man
[48:39] meditates day and night so Lord I'm
[48:41] asking you for grace to keep your word
[48:45] in my heart day and night and when I'm
[48:49] in a situation where I have a choice of
[48:51] becoming angry and bitter and hateful I
[48:53] want to remember that your word says
[48:56] that there's a tender way to stand for
[49:00] what is right there are times that a
[49:03] gift in secret can pacify anger there
[49:08] the scripture talks about heaping coals
[49:10] of fire on people's heads by returning
[49:13] kindness by passing along kind
[49:18] instead of maybe what someone deserves
[49:22] sometimes you can encounter people in
[49:25] public who are so angry so so bitter and
[49:30] you wonder what you've done maybe a
[49:32] waiter a server in a restaurant and you
[49:35] wonder what you've done and the
[49:36] temptation is wait a minute you're being
[49:38] paid to bring me my food and you're
[49:41] gonna show me a little bit of respect
[49:43] this is what we feel like sometimes we
[49:46] want to do but if we're meditating in
[49:49] God's Word day and night we will
[49:51] remember that there's a right answer
[49:53] here somewhere in God's instruction for
[49:56] how to deal with someone who's misusing
[49:58] you that way and there's a way to speak
[50:01] life and light to that person who's
[50:04] going through something only the Lord
[50:07] knows the times that he's used people
[50:09] strangers even to speak light into my
[50:11] life when I was facing some darkness and
[50:14] you and I can be used that way but you
[50:17] get down here to this verse that we were
[50:19] emphasizing in the beginning Lord you
[50:22] said that your righteous men and women
[50:25] were to be trees planted by the rivers
[50:28] of water and that if we would be planted
[50:30] by your living spirit water because your
[50:34] spirit is life remember jesus said out
[50:36] of men's bellies shall flow rivers of
[50:39] living water this is what happens when
[50:42] you're filled with the Spirit of God it
[50:45] doesn't just stay capped up inside of
[50:48] you dammed up inside of you it it has
[50:52] force and it wants to come out and he
[50:55] wants to fill your life with those
[50:58] Living Waters so that they can spread to
[51:00] somebody else like that waiter who's
[51:03] treated you rough when serving your
[51:05] dinner he wants to open up your belly
[51:08] and let that life and the light of Jesus
[51:11] Christ shine through you so you're
[51:13] praying this back to him and Lord you
[51:15] said if I'd stay planted by the rivers
[51:17] of your water that I would bring forth
[51:19] fruit in season hallelujah
[51:24] not a tree that casts its fruit before
[51:28] the season meaning drop
[51:30] in fruit on the ground that is not
[51:32] ripened the tree turns loose or cast its
[51:35] fruit out of season then it becomes a
[51:38] waste it rots on the ground but Lord you
[51:40] said that if I'd keep myself planted by
[51:43] the rivers of water that I would bring
[51:46] forth fruit in my season in the right
[51:49] season and that my leaf would not wither
[51:52] and whatsoever I do would prosper again
[51:56] that may sound very very silly or
[51:59] old-fashioned to somebody watching that
[52:02] you would take God's Word and pray it
[52:03] back like that but I'm telling you you
[52:05] would be surprised how he will speak to
[52:09] you when you fellowship with him through
[52:13] his word this encounter that Moses had
[52:17] it commissioned him for the rest of his
[52:20] life and God just said I want you to
[52:22] come closer but you're gonna have to
[52:25] take off your shoes you're going to have
[52:28] to come barefooted before me because
[52:30] even the ground that you're standing on
[52:32] is holy ground you know God was wanting
[52:35] to reveal to Moses there's something
[52:38] higher than the bush my fire in that
[52:42] bush is what makes that bush special my
[52:45] calling on your life Moses is what makes
[52:49] you special and I'm telling you the same
[52:52] is true today it's God's call on your
[52:56] life that makes you unique it's God's
[52:59] call on your life that makes you special
[53:02] in this hour and we may not feel very
[53:05] special sometime you know how that works
[53:07] but it's not about feeling it's about
[53:10] the promises of God I just feel like
[53:13] there's a fiery evangelist that that
[53:16] that's yet to be born watching this
[53:18] program right now and when I say yet to
[53:20] be born I mean in the spirit not in the
[53:22] natural I just believe that there are
[53:24] many who will see this program who God
[53:29] has a witness in your mouth he's got a
[53:32] testimony in your mouth you've just got
[53:34] to open it up and let it out he wants to
[53:37] use your influence and I also believe
[53:40] that there are some watching this
[53:42] program that you have not
[53:44] surrendered your life to the Lord and
[53:46] I'm telling you you're not living the
[53:48] life you were created to live unless you
[53:52] have surrendered to God's will for your
[53:54] life he wants to to change us by His
[53:58] Word and Commission us into the reason
[54:01] why we were born and the reason why I
[54:04] brought this today was because I was
[54:06] still thinking about John when we were
[54:09] together recently we talked about John
[54:11] seeing this experience of the Lord Jesus
[54:14] standing in the midst of the seven
[54:16] golden candlesticks and his reaction to
[54:20] the glory and splendor of the Lord was
[54:22] to fall flat on his face and the Lord
[54:26] reached out put his hand on him fear not
[54:29] John I'm the first and the last I've got
[54:33] this I like it when Jesus says I am
[54:36] Alpha and Omega I am The Aleph and the
[54:39] Tov I'm the first and the last the
[54:41] beginning in the end because he's saying
[54:43] what I've started
[54:45] don't you worry I'm more than able to
[54:48] finish maybe you're one of those who
[54:50] sees the condition of the world and you
[54:53] see the condition of the church and you
[54:55] think that the kingdom of God is
[54:57] fizzling out well I want to tell you in
[55:00] the name of the Lord you're wrong if
[55:02] that's your thought in your opinion and
[55:04] that's the philosophy that you've
[55:06] accepted in this hour you're absolutely
[55:08] wrong and I tell you that with boldness
[55:11] the kingdom of God is not fizzling the
[55:14] work of Jesus Christ is not going undone
[55:18] he is doing wonderful marvelous glorious
[55:22] things in the lives of his people in
[55:26] this hour we are finishing up
[55:29] preparation in the spirit to accomplish
[55:32] great things for God and then I'm
[55:36] looking for the coming of the Lord
[55:38] oh yes I'm one of those who believes in
[55:42] the coming of the Lord I believe that
[55:44] he's coming for his people one of these
[55:47] days and I'm going to keep living toward
[55:50] that day looking toward that day
[55:53] working until that day believing for
[55:57] transformation to continue in my life in
[56:01] my family and my community of faith and
[56:04] wherever you are watching this program

[56:46] only comes from knowing you as a
[56:49] personal Lord and Savior I pray for the
[56:52] discouraged right now that they would
[56:55] not buy into this idea that there's
[56:58] nothing happening and in the kingdom of
[57:01] God and among God's people but that they
[57:03] would begin to reach into your word pray
[57:07] it back to you in the spirit and watch
[57:10] you perform mighty works in their lives
[57:14] and in their families lives for the
[57:18] glory of God I just pray right now for a

[57:33] asking you Lord to let somebody
[57:35] fellowship with you in your suffering

[57:41] healing until virtue flows into their
[57:44] body and they see a miraculous recovery
[57:47] and a change lord I thank you for

[58:00] support the work of the king
[58:02] and the enemy is trying to absolutely
[58:04] squeeze them out of having a life I
[58:08] asked you Lord to release help for them
