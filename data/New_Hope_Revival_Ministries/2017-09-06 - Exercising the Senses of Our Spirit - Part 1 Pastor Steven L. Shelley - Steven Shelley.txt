TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and tell you what a wonderful privilege it is to be able to come into your home or wherever you're viewing this broadcast and announce to you the good news of Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not two thousand years ago the son of God God in human flesh walked the earth our Messiah our Savior our deliverer and we understand the Gospel story he was crucified he died he went into the grave but that was not the end of the story Satan was hoping that it was but on the third day he was victorious over death hell and the grave and he raised from the dead he is the resurrection he told Martha and Mary concerning the death and resurrection of their brother Lazarus before he raised him from the dead he said I am the resurrection and the life they said well we know our brother will live again in the resurrection in Jesus Yeshua he just said I am you're looking at the resurrection he is resurrection life and so we just speak to the dead to those who are spiritually dead to those who are spiritually numb to those who have not yet come to the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ we just declared to you I prophesied to you today he is the resurrection and the life if you trust him you can have eternal life this body of flesh that we live in will one day die and it will go into the grave but there is a resurrection there is hope and one day we know that we're going to live forever and ever in the kingdom of God and so we just feel so blessed to be able to share even that if that was all that I could share with you two day I would feel extremely blessed to be able to announce that good news some of you have heard it for 30 years 40 years 70 years your whole life others of you perhaps changing channel surfing across this network found this program and you may have never heard that Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah is alive and well and doing might I add great things among his people all over the world I know you've heard about the outpouring of God's Holy Spirit it sounds like another day of Pentecost people are being overcome by the power of God somebody said oh I'm not interested in that well we need to be we need to be interested in the fullness of God's Spirit operating in our lives because death is at work in our members death is at work in this physical body and if in this life the Bible tells us in the New Testament if in this life only we have hope then we are of all men most miserable but I'm thankful that my hope is not only in this life but in the life Hereafter and so I want to share with you some insight from the scripture today and I want to thank you for contacting us you have called some of you have sent letters and emails to let us know this program is airing on several networks it is also streamed live over the internet on the two networks the gospel channel out of Iceland all across Europe and the UK and then on angel TV out of southern India we're going out across the Middle East and Asia and both of these networks stream their channel over the Internet and also we release some of these programs on podcasts so you can go to iTunes and subscribe to our Podcast our Eagle caste and for more information on how to do that you can visit our website at revival dot o-r-g revival dot o-r-g i'm gonna spell revival r e VI v al dot org o RG i want to make it simple because you'd be surprised how many ways I've seen people spell revival over the years and spelling it's not my number one gift either so I just want to make it simple for you it'll be on the screen as well let's get into the Word of God today and again thank you for tuning in we're going to begin a series where we're going to be speaking to you about exercising the spirit of man we are try and being we are body soul and spirit and we want to talk about that but we're gonna do it slowly we're going to teach from the scripture and I believe you'll be blessed by our time together today amen so let's get started in John chapter 3 we read a very familiar portion of Scripture Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus this ruler among the Jews who came to Jesus by night he didn't come in the daytime he came under the shadow of darkness in secret his heart was a heart of inquiry he was interested and he came to Jesus to find out just what was going on you see being a Jew he was very religious very knowledgeable of the law he knew the prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah and he was just fascinated but because he was a ruler among the Jews he didn't want to be identified he didn't want people to know that he had come so he came by night and he asked Jesus in John chapter 3 rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God this is verse 2 for no man can these things that thou doest except God be with him now I want to skip down for the purpose of this study to verse 6 and well I guess we better get verse 5 in here because it's the most powerful and important verse probably in this chapter jesus answered verily verily surely surely I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God how important is being born of the Spirit well without it you cannot enter into the kingdom of God now of course you know Nicodemus he didn't understand this and he said how can I enter a second time into my mother's womb and be born all over again now I'm a grown man of full stature and Jesus is giving him the revelation of how a new birth in the spirit is possible but I want to read verse 6 7 and 8 that which is born of the flesh is flesh understand that which originates in ish is initiated in the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again and then verse 8 the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit now just for those of you who may have never heard that simple plan of the gospel that we were talking about a moment ago how is one born of the Spirit well we must repent of our sins we must acknowledge before God that we have sinned and we have the Bible tells us in Romans 4 all have sinned and come short of the glory of God but John 3:16 tells us for God so loved the world that He gave His only be gotten Sun now another scripture tells us greater love have have any man than this there's there's no greater love possible than a man would lay down his life for his friends this tells us of the great love of God that he was willing to condescend he came down into a body made of flesh and that flesh was crucified the life that was in him the eternal spirit of the Father did not die did you notice I said the eternal spirit of the father did not die but the fleshly body of the Lord Jesus Christ did die paying the price the Bible tells us without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin and so we see from the book of Genesis the Garden of Eden all the way through to the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ that blood was necessary the shedding of blood interestingly enough the blood of Jesus was not just the ordinary blood it didn't just have the DNA of man but it had the DNA of God it was blood that was specifically designed for man's Redemption hallelujah and it doesn't just remit our sin it doesn't just cover I should say it doesn't just cover our sin but it remits our sin in other words it takes it away through justification just if I'd justified just if I'd never sinned oh my this is a wonderful thing that our loving father has done for us so we need to repent of our sin acknowledge that we're a sinner and invite the Lord Jesus Christ into our life and we can be born again we can be and then the Spirit of God comes in and washes us and sanctifies us cleanses us sets us apart and then we can be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire and if you've never heard of that if you can get a hold of a New Testament read in Acts chapter 2 the Bible a call said if you're if you're not familiar you see there are people listening to me that are not familiar with the layout of the Bible so I want to encourage you to look into it in a New Testament you're gonna have the four Gospels first Matthew Mark Luke and John these are the four Gospels the good news of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ for individual men who were eyewitnesses to the miraculous ministry of Jesus Christ in the earth and then the next book in the Bible the fifth book of the Bible is called in most bibles the Acts of the Apostles that's where we're talking about the book of Acts chapter 2 read it and you'll read about how the power of the Holy Spirit was poured out during the Jewish feast of Shavuot one of the three major feast in the Hebrew calendar where God commanded that every male Hebrew would come to Jerusalem to the temple and worship God and they were doing that for Shavuot when the heavens opened up the fire of God came down hallelujah and a mighty rushing wind and they were all baptized with the spirit that completes the new birth when a baby is born first there is an issue of of water and then an issue of blood and then an issue of life so the the natural birth the breaking of the water the issuing of fourth of the blood is the babies coming forth and then life in three steps so is the spiritual birth the natural birth three steps the spiritual birth also three phases repentance we repent we become justified we allow the Word of God to penetrate our lives and instruct us and wash us the scripture said we are wha we are washed or cleansed or sanctified by the washing of the water of God's Word that speaks of a great power of God's Word then we are filled with the precious wonderful gift of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost and fire now I'm telling you it's a wonderful wonderful experience acts 2:38 says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so it's a promise and it is a gift this is how we come now we want to talk about something that is I think vitally important to understand as spirit filled believers so now we've spent this time just introducing whoever might be watching who needed to have your memory refreshed on the plan of salvation or perhaps you've never really heard it before you've heard about Christians you've heard about those who follow Jesus and what you've heard may or may not be true may not be the truth because and as we should say I think that everyone who names the name of Christ is not following the Word of God and so they're going to be people who say well I was born a Christian I was born a Christian my mother was a Christian well I want to tell you something friend God doesn't have any grandchildren and so you're not just a Christian because your mother was a Christian or your father was a Christian because that may be your religion but we're not talking about religion we're talking about relationship oh and every man woman boy or girl is invited to have for themselves a personal encounter with the Living God a true-blue real genuine relationship with Jesus you say well that's impossible because Jesus left the earth he died raised from the dead and some 30 40 days later ascended into heaven we're told and so where is he now well that's where you need to read Acts chapter 2 I'll tell you where Jesus is he's right here living inside of me uh-oh somebody said I'm turning that preacher off he said he was Jesus well every spirit-filled believer is carrying in them a deposit of the Zoey that's a Greek word for the life of God it's inside of us so where is Jesus in the earth he is not in one physical corporate body he is now in a multitude of many membered body where we are walking out by the Spirit of the Lord introducing the life of God to the earth for more information if you need to understand some of these things we don't have time to go into the complete depth of it today contact us the address is given the email address is given and we'll be glad to help you get some resources or something information a CD or a printed article or something that would help you or lists of the Scriptures that would help you to engage to embark on a wonderful journey through the scripture now I want us to talk about this triune being that we are you see God is triune now when I'm teaching I don't use the word Trinity not that I don't believe that there is a Trinity of attributes in God a Trinity of because you know the tricycle has three wheels so I'm not opposed to that except for the fact that sometimes when people explain the Trinity they are really using hyper trinitarianism extreme trinitarianism where they get God so divided into three separate people that they lose all reality or concept of the oneness of God and because my heritage my great-grandparents were Jewish and they were from Lithuania I see very clearly in the Torah in the in the Bible that God is one here ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one but he has decided it was God's decision to reveal himself in a tri-unity in a great oneness in a great unity of spirit same spirit God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him how in spirit and in truth but he took his spirit and he has manifested himself in three distinct I think we can say distinct manifestations personalities administration's and what are they Father Son and Holy Spirit so I don't want you to leave this broadcast thinking that I do not teach the the tri-unity of God I do I see it very clearly I could never deny it because you're made similar you and I are also some sort of try unity a triune being we are made up of body that's this flesh that's what you see on the outside and then inside of this physical body there's two parts of me that you can't see one is my soul and the soul is often referred to as the seat of the emotions and inside of the souls so to speak if you were drawing circles three circles inside of each other is the human spirit now the interesting thing about the human spirit is in the Garden of Eden Adam was given the Spirit of God it was breathed into him and it created for Adam a human spirit so what was living inside of Adam his spirit was actually the spirit his spirit Adam's spirit was actually the spirit it was the essence of the eternal God we live in a to make it a little bit simpler we live in a three compartment home a three room home you could put it on three levels or you could put it as three separate rooms I've heard people say it's like a kitchen parlour or a living room and a bedroom and then I've heard people say it's three levels of floors if you wanted to do that then we could say that we live on the middle floor and we can choose to sort of reside there forever or we can also move up into another realm or another floor the spirit realm or move down into the realm of the soul and I know that's sounding a little bit complicated and that's why one just really teach very slow we're just laying sort of a foundation here today so you really need to tune in again next week and the next and the next because we're going to go through some scriptures here that I think are very important but let me just just give you a few notes here one each of us has the capacity and the ability to find expression and fulfillment in either the upper floor or in the lower floor or we could say if we're living in the living room of our home we can be happy in the kitchen we can have peace there we can have peace in the bedroom we can move back and forth and enjoy our life I know that is sounding a little bit odd but you'll get it I know you will because we're gonna go through it so plain and so many times and restate it and give so many examples that you're gonna catch it I know and it's for you it's for you to understand because I believe that we're about to come into a place in the kingdom of God where there is coming forth a company of people all over the world in every nation of the world in the islands of the sea who will be granted the spirit of the overcomer or the anointing of the overcomer we're not just going to survive in these terrible times that the world is facing right now there's going to be a Bride of Christ there's going to be an overcoming company of people that no matter what's going on around them in the natural they're going to move in the realm of the supernatural we're going to have supernatural protection we're going to have supernatural healing and health we're going to have supernatural leadership I believe that God's going to have a people who are so connected their spirit man is so connected now I guess I should say that we connect with the world around us with the atmosphere with the earth around us through the realm of the soul but we connect with God with the heavenly dimension with the third heaven we connect through our spirit man and so the inside of the inside is the spirit man the five senses that we know of the the smelling and the seeing the hearing the tasting the feeling so forth these five senses are ways that we contact that we have communication with the earth with the world around us with what we can see with what we can hear with what we can smell what we can taste what we can feel these are ways that our flesh is able to connect to the world around us and what we gather through these five senses is filtered in to the soul of man now our spirit man is on the inside of that and that's what we want to see exercised in this hour through the transgression through the fall in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve lost the ability to move into that spirit realm they only had connection with the earthly realm through the five senses of the flesh that information filtered into the soul so any kind of communication that they had was very low level communication low level understanding but there was a time that Adam was able to access God through his spirit because he was made in the very image and in the very likeness of God because of the fall he lost that ability to function both in the natural realm and in the spirit realm and he only functioned in the natural realm and I don't know about you but the natural realm is pretty limited somebody said what in the old are you talking about well it's in the realm of the natural realm this earthly realm that we find sickness that we find troubles that we get into bad situations that we deal with a lot of ugly stuff with addiction with generational curses with so many things that the enemy uses to hold us back we want to break out of this realm of the soulless realm the emotions and the mind and the and the affections and the imaginations and the conscious realm all this stuff that pollutes us that weighs us down and we want to be able to move into the realm of the Spirit I believe God gave us the Holy Spirit because he wanted us to be able to function whole we're to be whole we are we receive a lot of woundedness in this life don't we we lose a lot of our spiritual ground we lose a lot of that sometime when we get slapped upside the head with circumstances when we get sick when when our loved ones we see our loved ones suffering there's so many things that happen to us to distract us that's really what I want to say there's so much going on that we get it through our five senses we hear bad news we see mad news we can almost smell bad news there's so much of that that distracts us from developing a relationship of intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ so we want to see the the Spirit of God give us some strength to place some boundaries in our life to shut out some of the influences that the enemy wants to use to distract us I mean we've got to live and we've got a function in the earthly realm but and and we have access to that earthly realm but we want to be able to control that we want to be able to determine by the Spirit of God how we let our circumstances affect us in other words the enemy doesn't want you to have joy he wants to steal your joy he's a joy thief but things are going to come circumstances are going to come that sort of tried to affect our peace affect our joy but the test is how quickly how quickly do you come back to joy if you get sidetracked you start losing some of your peace and joy how quick do you come back to that do you just kind of wallow around in self-pity do you kind of wallow around in oppression and depression or do you quickly just start standing on the promises of God and rebuking the enemy and saying I'm gonna focus my attention on the Lord Jesus Christ and brother sister if you start doing that I don't care how adverse the circumstances are I don't care how bloody the wounds are if you start focusing on the Lord Jesus Christ you're gonna come back to joy you're gonna come back to peace every time and I'm feeling some of that joy I'm feeling some of that peace right now as I speak to you about how available it is in the body of Christ but we need to pray and go off the air and I hope you'll tune in again to the program the Eagles cry next week but let's pray father I'm excited it took me a whole program to get excited to start moving into what I wanted to speak about and lord I just pray I know I've kind of moved quickly and I don't want to confuse anybody I want to bless people and I just pray Lord that you will by the Holy Spirit you will let us digest your word let us get understanding let us get supernatural knowledge and then father above all things let us begin to live this out so we just come against the works of the enemy that try to distract and hinder God's people in this last day and I just released deliverance right now let's just get right to it I release deliverance from distraction from bondages from addictions Lord let's somebody just reach up to you and send mercy and grace into their home into their place of business wherever they are and let your peace fill that home I release your peace right now into that home into that place of gathering let your peace and your joy and your comfort come in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen any man I want to thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again next time god bless you I love you I want to be a blessing to you bye-bye for today you
