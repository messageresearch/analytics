TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it'll just be right down to a pure reduction of what jesus saw in us [Music] you're here in laodicea and every time you confess i don't know if i'll make it or not i don't know if i can get through this or not i don't see how i'm going to be able to survive this or not you're questioning the sovereign mind of god who sent you into this hour you are surely being tested and tried we are surely being sifted our hearts are being sifted before god we're in a great war in this hour but you're here because god saw that you would eventually yield your will would break you would make the right choice and again the right choice and again the right choice so that he could be glorified in your life he knew you would be broken he knew you would be squeezed he knew that you would suffer some things you would feel the sting of betrayal you would feel the grief of loss lost relationships of how things were and how we hoped they would always be but every part of that specially picked designed by a sovereign mind to bring you and i to that place where we could be roasted and reduced when we get down to the end of the end of this squeeze there'll be no actors among us there'll be no facades among us no false identities to protect our truth among us it'll just be right down to a pure reduction of what jesus saw in us before we came here and he assisted us by placing a seed in our life that's caused us to want more of him when everybody seemingly around us wants more of stuff
