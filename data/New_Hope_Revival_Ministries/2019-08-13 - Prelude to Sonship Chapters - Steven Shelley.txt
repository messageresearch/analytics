TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] it was just after my fifth birthday that my parents divorced and it seemed like overnight my mom became both mother to me and father she was my comforter my nurturer and she also had to be the chief disciplinarian and she was good at both I think that mother realized that me being an only child raised in a single-parent home that things would be a little different for me I believe that by the age of five my mother already knew that there was a call of God on my life she didn't understand it but I think she wanted to do anything that she could to help prepare me for whatever my life would hold there were times that I felt like she was a bit rough but when I look back over my life I realize that she was training me she was in her way helping to prepare me for my future and she was doing it because she loved me now I have to be honest in the heat of the moment I didn't always feel loved the Bible tells us that in Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 11 it says all discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful yet to those who have been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness you see we have a Heavenly Father who loves us so very much it is his desire to bring us to that place where we can perfectly reflect to a lost world his character his divine nature for some of us our training looks different I feel like that we go through different circumstances and different trials because we have a father who has seen all of our days he has them recorded in his book he knows exactly how we're going to be used for the sake of his kingdom and when and he knows exactly what it will take to get us to the place that he can really use us for his glory Spurgeon said that trials teach us what we are they dig up the soil and let us see what we are made of the Bible tells us that when the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness in Deuteronomy 8 that God led them for those 40 years in the wilderness to prove them to Humble them and to know what was in their heart you know God already knows what's in our heart he knows what's there but I believe that he allows us to walk through places in life that bring to the surface what is on the inside of our heart God giving us a chance to make it right and to correct it but our father is doing what he does and allowing what he allows for our profit for our good it may be hard to rejoice in the moment but we need to remember that there's great value great benefit and blessing when we pass faithfully through the trials and testings of life the Bible is filled with examples of those who went through the fire went through great hardship and through it all glorified the God of heaven gave God praise in all things he tells us in the last part of verse 10 he does these things for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness all of our good beads all of our righteousness our separated way of living none of that could attain or bring us to that place of his holiness and yet he said you are being trained instructed so that you might be partakers of my holiness that's how much he loves us brother Branham said that God allows certain things to happen in our life just to see what we will do about it he said every son that cometh to God must be tried and chastened and proved and then he said Satan will make you prove every inch of ground that you claim he certainly will so sometimes God lets these things happen not because he doesn't love us but because he does he went on to say he does these things sometime to see what kind of attitude you take so it's important that we maintain the right spirit that we keep the right attitude no matter what we're walking through in life and then I like what he said God trains his men then anoints them gives them experience takes them through the rigid training down through the sands of burning punishment trying and testing not only does he do that for his prophets he does it for his children because every son that cometh to God must be chasing tried tested by the word he talks about in the days before the smelter when they were looking for gold and they would get that gold ore out of the ground and they would pound it and pounded and pounded until it became so pure all the dross fell off just gold left and so shiny that the prospector could see his reflection in the gold what you're going through right now you may feel like you're under the hammer it certainly does not feel good in the heat of the trial in the midst of the battle but I believe that God's children our ultimate desire is to be totally surrendered to him we must not despise the correction the chastening of the Lord but we must allow him even invite him to do whatever is necessary to allow whatever is necessary so that we can become like that gold a real reflection when he looks into our life he sees himself looking back I don't know what you're going through today you may be in the greatest trial of your life you may feel rejected alone forsaken forgotten but I want you to know that your father loves you he is right there with you in the midst of what you're walking through and if you can look above the circumstance give God all the praise he deserves he will grant you the grace to get through to endure the Bible says those who endure to the end they're the ones delivered they're the ones saved I want you to know that we're praying for you that you will press the battle that you will worship the king and that you will begin to recognize that there is great value and profit in the training of the Lord god bless you [Music]
