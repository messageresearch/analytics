[0:04] [Music]
[0:07] people come around and they say why are
[0:10] they always talking about the seven
[0:11] Church ages why are they always talking
[0:14] about church history and how God moved
[0:17] in those seven ages of church history
[0:19] here's why you can't understand the
[0:22] coming Kingdom until you understand how
[0:25] God moves in the church you've got to
[0:28] see the church ages before you can see
[0:30] listen you've got to see the church ages
[0:33] before you understand the seals
[0:36] you've got to see where God was where he
[0:39] is and where he's going to be and you've
[0:42] got to see it all at the same time
[0:43] and there's no way that our little human
[0:46] mind could do that unless the Holy
[0:48] Spirit quickens the word and makes it
[0:50] alive to us like a revelation and I want
[0:52] you to know you can't whip the Devil
[0:54] with a shout you can't whip the Devil
[0:56] with a jump you can't whip the devil in
[0:59] tongues and interpretation but you can
[1:01] whip the Devil with a revelation
[1:04] get you a revelation of the word and
[1:06] there's not a devil that can stand
[1:08] before you because you don't meet him
[1:11] with your sensation you don't meet him
[1:13] with your emotion you meet him with a
[1:15] revelation of the word he understand
[1:18] that
[1:20] you see you you I believe in jumping
[1:22] around you know I'm gonna have I'm going
[1:24] to have a church that's alive I am not
[1:26] going to Pastor a church that's dead
[1:30] I'm not going to spend my time
[1:32] worshiping with people that could care
[1:34] less about worship I'm too old for that
[1:39] I mean it I'm too old for that in fact
[1:41] I'm not going to sit in too many
[1:43] services
[1:45] I don't have to
[1:48] somebody said aren't you going to the
[1:49] meeting there aren't you going to the
[1:50] meeting there no I don't have to sit in
[1:52] a dead service
[1:54] the voice that's talking to you now is
[1:57] not behind you
[2:00] the voice that God is speaking to you
[2:03] with now is in front of you
[2:06] and he's leading us
[2:08] Kingdom
[2:10] it's the promised land before us
[2:14] we're getting our eyes on the promise
[2:17] we can't spend our time focusing on the
[2:21] flaws of the modern day church I want
[2:25] you to be able to ask abundantly
[2:27] [Music]
[2:29] to be able to get what you ask
[2:31] I want you to see that God she does not
[2:34] want to live in a little limited box
[2:37] I want you to be able to have what you
[2:39] pray I want you to begin to see the
[2:41] answer to your prayers and I want to
[2:44] tell you that you can't as long as
[2:46] you're looking at the church
[2:48] John couldn't hear what he'd had to hear
[2:51] on Patmos if he would have only been
[2:53] looking
[2:55] somewhere God wasn't talking
[2:57] God wasn't Kingdom talking yet
[3:00] he was church talking so John had to
[3:03] turn to see the church
[3:05] the message of the Hour come
[3:07] we saw the church
[3:09] now it's time to see the kingdom
[3:11] [Music]
[3:13] anybody with me
