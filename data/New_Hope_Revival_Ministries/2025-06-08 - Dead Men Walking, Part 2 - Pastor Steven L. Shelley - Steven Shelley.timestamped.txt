[37:30] the stream, the Lord sees the needs that
[37:33] you have. He knows what they are. He
[37:35] knows best how to meet them. Would you
[37:37] continue to pray for Sister Audrey and
[37:41] for Sister Gert that God would help
[37:44] them? Would you also pray for Millie who
[37:48] has a a facial rash this morning with a

[37:53] but we know there's a mighty God is able
[37:56] to go right to the root of that. Yes.
[37:59] Would you pray for some of our folks who
[38:01] we haven't seen in this meeting? I'm
[38:03] disturbed. We uh could use their support
[38:07] and they could use what was here last
[38:09] night. Absolutely. So, let's pray that
[38:11] God will stir uh even our own people.
[38:14] Streaming is wonderful, but it's not
[38:17] like being there. Absolutely. It is. And
[38:20] I I want them to be stirred enough, you
[38:22] know, I want to be stirred myself so
[38:24] that I don't want to miss. If the doors
[38:26] open, I want to be there. Amen. I got up
[38:29] early this morning as the thunder and
[38:31] lightning woke me up. I got up. I said,
[38:33] "I better get my shower because if the
[38:36] power goes out, I I I'll be in a mess."
[38:39] I was determined. I don't have a choice.
[38:41] I have to be here. And uh I'm just
[38:44] thankful for you that are here this
[38:46] morning. I know there needs in the
[38:47] building as well. Amen. Amen.
[38:51] Amen. Sing this chorus with us as we get
[38:54] ready to pray.
[38:57] Jesus, just the
[39:00] mention of your
[39:07] name. The little flowers they grow. The
[39:13] desert
[39:15] blooms again.
[39:18] [Music]
[39:21] Just like
[39:23] fire in winter's
[39:27] cold, like
[39:30] pure
[39:31] preious
[39:34] gold.
[39:37] Jesus, just the
[39:39] mention of your name. Brother John Real,
[39:44] will you come and pray over the needs
[39:45] today?
[39:47] Oh
[39:49] Jesus, just the
[39:52] mention of your
[39:59] name. The little flowers they grow. The
[40:05] desert blooms again.
[40:10] [Music]
[40:13] Just like
[40:15] fire in winter's
[40:19] cold, like
[40:21] pure
[40:23] preious
[40:26] gold.
[40:28] Jesus, just the
[40:31] mention of your name.
[40:40] Yes, Lord. Heavenly Father,
[40:43] we come again, Lord Jesus. And we thank
[40:46] you, Lord, for being so faithful to us.
[40:50] Lord, you are so faithful. Your goodness
[40:53] has run after us time and again, Lord.
[40:56] When we were not worthy, Lord, you still
[41:00] loved us. You still counted us worthy,
[41:03] Lord. You still continued chasing after
[41:06] us.
[41:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus. We thank you,
[41:10] Lord. Now for the needs that are
[41:11] represented here, Lord, the ones that
[41:13] have been mentioned, the sisters, the
[41:16] the children, Lord, that have been
[41:18] mentioned that need your touch, we ask,
[41:20] Lord, I ask in your name that you would
[41:23] come and minister to them. Each and
[41:25] everyone, Lord, that has a need, Lord.
[41:28] The needs that were represented, Lord,
[41:30] behind every heart,
[41:33] that and every soul that had a need,
[41:35] that had a desire, Lord.
[41:39] Lord, you know it better than we do. You
[41:42] know everything, Lord. The unspoken
[41:45] needs, Lord, that the the the needs that
[41:47] are too deep,
[41:49] too too too deep, Lord, to be expressed,
[41:53] maybe even not even known to the to the
[41:56] own heart or soul, Lord. Lord, you know
[41:59] the emotional,
[42:01] the physical,
[42:03] the spiritual needs of the people here,
[42:05] Lord. Not just the people in this
[42:07] congregation, but Lord, even even out in
[42:10] the stream and the ones that are not
[42:12] here that sometimes come and are not
[42:16] here, Lord, we ask that you would
[42:18] minister to those needs. We just speak
[42:21] the name of Jesus over every need. We
[42:24] just speak the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:26] that you would Lord Jesus meet them in
[42:29] their need. Minister to them according
[42:32] to their need. Lord Jesus, thank you
[42:34] Lord for loving us. And Lord, let your
[42:38] love, let your divine love touch every
[42:42] heart.
[42:43] And speak to every need and heart here,
[42:46] Lord Jesus. Amen. Minister to them, Lord
[42:49] Jesus. Yes, Jesus. We pray this in the
[42:52] mighty name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[42:55] Amen.
[42:58] Praise the Lord.
[43:01] Hallelujah.
[43:06] Hallelujah.
[43:10] Thank you, Lord.
[43:14] The Lord is good and faithful.
[43:17] Oh, I think we ought to give him another
[43:19] shout of praise for what he did last
[43:21] night. Lord, we praise
[43:24] you. Thank you, Lord.
[43:28] You are faithful and true and
[43:31] mighty.
[43:34] Glory. You may have your seats
[43:37] [Music]
[43:39] today. Lord was moving here last night.
[43:43] Glad that he doesn't quit.
[43:46] He keeps
[43:47] moving. Whether I want to move with him
[43:49] or not, he keeps moving. But it is my
[43:52] sincere desire to move with the lamb
[43:56] wherever he steps and walks. I want to
[43:58] go with him. I want to know that I'm in
[44:01] the perfect plan and will of God every
[44:03] step that I make that he I'm moving with
[44:06] him. We're glad that you're here in the
[44:09] house of the Lord with us today. The
[44:11] Lord met us last night. I'm expecting
[44:15] that he will meet with us again today.
[44:18] He already is. He's here. He's moving
[44:21] among us. He's already touched my life.
[44:24] I pray that he's touching yours. That if
[44:26] if we'll open up our heart and let him.
[44:30] We We too often come with resistance.
[44:34] But we don't want to resist what he's
[44:36] doing. We want to let him do what he
[44:38] wants to do, however he wants to do it.
[44:42] Sometimes we don't like the way he works
[44:44] in our life.
[44:47] Yet we want to be
[44:50] willing. Let him do it how he wants to
[44:53] do it.
[44:56] And as our pastor was preaching last
[44:59] night talking about George
[45:02] Fox and he recognized George Fox
[45:05] recognized that there was a problem in
[45:08] his life to be
[45:10] sweet, to be patient, to be
[45:14] kind. We have a lot of issue a lot of
[45:17] times with impatience with others.
[45:20] But we also have
[45:21] impatience with what God wants to do in
[45:24] us.
[45:26] We get impatient with how long it's
[45:28] taking.
[45:31] Yet the problem is not him.
[45:34] It's it's us.
[45:37] It's us. Because we still have a part of
[45:40] our will that we're not letting loose
[45:42] of.
[45:43] But oh that God would grant us the grace
[45:47] to let loose of everything that we're
[45:50] holding on to that resists the power
[45:53] that resists the move of the Holy Ghost
[45:55] in our life.
[45:57] That's why we come together to allow him
[46:00] to break down all of that stubbornness,
[46:04] all that resistance, all that is in us
[46:06] that keeps him from doing what he wants
[46:09] to do so that he can come in with the
[46:11] sweetness and kindness and patience that
[46:14] we so desire. Amen. That's why we're
[46:18] here.
[46:19] Brother Kate is going to come to the
[46:21] piano and sing today for us again as
[46:25] we're worshiping together by the giving
[46:28] of our tithe and offering. We're we're
[46:32] letting this worship prepare our hearts
[46:36] for the preaching of the word to let the
[46:38] Lord do what he wants to do in us. Uh,
[46:43] Brother Aaron and brother Ian, I'm going
[46:44] to let you two brothers go to the people
[46:46] today as we give our tithe and offering
[46:49] unto the Lord. If you are here and
[46:52] you're not typically here, you want to
[46:54] give an offering, uh, if you'll put it
[46:58] in an envelope, if you want credit for
[47:00] it for tax purposes, uh, put it in an
[47:03] envelope with your name and your address
[47:06] so that we can, uh, make sure that you
[47:08] get a receipt for your giving. But we
[47:10] thank you for giving to the Lord.
[47:13] Everything that you give, it's for the
[47:15] purposes of the kingdom. We want to be
[47:18] wise with what we do with God's money
[47:21] and and and we're trying to do that. But
[47:24] we thank you for your giving. Thank you
[47:26] for every dollar that you give to help
[47:28] the work of the Lord that God has called
[47:31] us to. Let's worship together as we
[47:33] give. Brother Kate sings.
[47:36] When he's finished, I'd like to have
[47:38] Brother Dylan come and uh if he has a
[47:41] song he could sing or give us a little
[47:43] testimony or something when Cad's
[47:45] finished. Let's have Brother Dylan to
[47:46] come and greet the church with
[47:49] something. It feels good in here this
[47:52] morning, don't it?
[47:54] I was watching a minister earlier this
[47:56] week and uh he had said if God has
[47:59] allowed it, he's made a way through it.
[48:02] And there's so much peace in that. And
[48:04] that's just resting on my heart this
[48:05] morning. Just uh sing the song with me.
[48:10] [Music]
[48:18] [Music]
[48:30] I've lost some
[48:31] friends down the
[48:39] road. This world ain't easy. Walk alone,
[48:44] but I'm finding peace like I've ever
[48:48] known. And despite all my trials, one
[48:53] thing
[48:54] remains. One man's been with me and he's
[48:58] never changed. Let me say I serve a good
[49:03] Oh, I serve a good
[49:05] good
[49:09] God. He stood in my fire without my
[49:14] request. He took all my burdens that
[49:18] settles arrest. He reached out his hand
[49:22] from a cry of pure faith. And that's
[49:26] more than I need to know of his saving
[49:30] grace. So I'll lift my hands out on what
[49:34] I can do. But just looking back on what
[49:39] he brought me through, he picked up the
[49:43] pieces when my life was a mess. And I'm
[49:47] so
[49:49] thankful that he never left.
[50:02] I spent a liime trying to walk on water.
[50:07] Kept looking down and kept finding it
[50:11] harder. Stay above the waves. When I was
[50:15] thinking I'd drown. I threw up my hands
[50:19] and pulled me out and he lead me on the
[50:24] path that led back to him.
[50:27] He turned all the lights when everything
[50:30] looked so dim. And that's when I knew I
[50:35] found what I've been
[50:37] searching
[50:39] for.
[50:41] Oh, and he stood in my fire without my
[50:46] request. He took all my burdens at the
[50:50] set to rest. He reached down his hand
[50:54] from a cry of pure faith. And that's
[50:58] more than I need to know of his saving
[51:01] grace. So I'll lift my hands not on what
[51:05] I can do. But just looking back on what
[51:10] he brought me through. He picked up the
[51:14] pieces when my life was a mess. And I'm
[51:18] so
[51:21] thankful that he stood in my fire
[51:25] without my request. He took all my
[51:30] burdens that settles the rest. He
[51:33] reached out his hand from a cry of pure
[51:37] faith. And that's more than I need to
[51:41] know of his saving grace. So I'll lift
[51:44] my hands out on what I can do. But just
[51:49] looking back on what he brought me
[51:53] through, he picked up the pieces when my
[51:56] life wasn't messed. And I'm so
[52:01] thankful that he never
[52:06] left. Oh, he never left.
[52:13] He never
[52:17] left. And he never
[52:22] left. I need your
[52:27] glory. I want your
[52:31] glory. Less of me and more of you is
[52:36] what I need.
[52:40] Show me your glory.
[52:44] Show me your power.
[52:49] Less of me and more of you is what I
[52:54] need. Sing that again. Oh, I need your
[52:59] glory. I want your glory.
[53:05] Less of me and more of you is what I
[53:11] need. I want you
[53:15] glory. Show me your
[53:19] glory. More less of me and more of you
[53:24] is what I
[53:27] need. I want your glory.
[53:32] I need your
[53:35] glory. More less of me and more of you
[53:40] is what I
[53:42] [Music]
[53:43] need. Show me your
[53:47] glory. Show me your
[53:51] power. Whole less of me and more of you
[53:56] is what I
[53:59] need. I want you glory.
[54:06] [Music]
[54:09] I want you
[54:15] glory. Lord, I want you glory.
[54:24] [Music]
[54:32] I want your glory.
[54:35] I want your glory. Hallelujah.
[54:42] Hallelujah.
[54:44] [Music]
[54:49] Hallelujah. We heard last
[54:52] night what it'll take
[54:56] for the glory to come.
[54:58] too many people excited about it.
[55:02] It will require death. That's right.
[55:08] Just
[55:09] as John the Baptist
[55:12] recognized when the Messiah came on the
[55:16] scene, I must
[55:18] decrease so that he can increase.
[55:24] The message is still the same in 2025.
[55:29] In order for Jesus to be seen,
[55:36] in order for Jesus Christ,
[55:39] to be
[55:41] seen wherever I walk,
[55:45] it's got to be me
[55:48] decreasing so that he can
[55:51] increase so that it's not me that's
[55:54] being seen,
[55:57] but only
[55:59] him. Thank you, brother
[56:02] Cade. Brother Dylan,
[56:05] come. You can have your seats if you'd
[56:08] like. We invite Brother Dylan Robson
[56:10] from North Carolina.

[56:23] you.
[56:25] Hallelujah. Thank you.
[56:51] Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning?
[56:55] Amen.
[56:58] You know, Brother Steve said, "I'm back
[57:00] at home." I feel that way.
[57:04] You know, I brought my wife this time
[57:05] and
[57:07] um my daughter, Jubilee. Amen.

[1:06:03] of this
[1:06:05] world was getting closer.
[1:06:13] And the pole I

[1:06:19] I could bear.
[1:06:26] And I was on the verge of giving
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:35] over. And the strength
[1:06:39] within
[1:06:41] myself just wasn't
[1:06:46] there. And something keeps holding me.

[1:07:30] Oh, and Satan laid before me. His
[1:07:38] temptation. Oh, of his desire to steal
[1:07:44] away my faith.
[1:07:49] Oh, but I have found in time the
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:57] revelation. Oh, the strength I need to
[1:08:02] keep me by his
[1:08:06] grace. And Jesus is holding
[1:08:11] me. Every day I see
[1:08:16] Oh, he's helping me

[1:10:46] life. What more could he
[1:10:52] give? Oh,

[1:11:26] me. Oh,
[1:11:29] how he loves you and me.
[1:11:38] He
[1:11:40] gave his
[1:11:42] life. What more could he
[1:11:49] give? Oh,
[1:11:51] how he loves
[1:11:55] you. Oh,
[1:11:57] how he loves me.

[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:23] Sweep
[1:12:25] over my
[1:12:29] soul. Sweet
[1:12:32] spirit, sweep
[1:12:34] over my
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:40] soul. My
[1:12:43] rest is complete.
[1:12:47] While I
[1:12:49] sit at your
[1:12:52] feet, sweet
[1:12:55] spirit, sweep
[1:12:58] over my soul. Sing
[1:13:03] again. Sweep
[1:13:07] over
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:10] my sweep
[1:13:13] over my soul. Oh sweet
[1:13:19] spirit, sweep
[1:13:23] over my
[1:13:28] soul. My
[1:13:31] rest is
[1:13:34] complete while I
[1:13:37] sit at your feet.
[1:13:43] If you're able, would you stand together
[1:13:45] with us and sing again? Brother Shelley
[1:13:48] comes to minister the word. Let the Holy
[1:13:51] Spirit sweep over you. Sweep
[1:13:54] over my
[1:13:57] soul. Sweep
[1:14:00] over my
[1:14:03] soul. Sweet
[1:14:06] spirit, sweep
[1:14:09] over my soul.
[1:14:14] My rest, my
[1:14:17] rest is complete.
[1:14:20] While I sit, while I
[1:14:23] sit at your feet, sweet spirit, sweet
[1:14:29] spirit, sweep over.
[1:14:33] God bless you, Lord.
[1:14:35] Let's give the Lord just a real real
[1:14:39] real
[1:14:40] enthusiastic hand clap. Oh, we can never
[1:14:45] thank you
[1:14:47] enough for what you're building here in
[1:14:51] this
[1:14:53] service.
[1:14:55] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:15:01] He's so good.
[1:15:04] He is so faithful.
[1:15:06] He will build you a pavilion. He'll make
[1:15:09] a little bubble for you if you want him
[1:15:11] to. And he'll let you get right in that
[1:15:14] presence with him. And the one sitting
[1:15:16] right next to you may not feel one
[1:15:18] thing, but he'll let you if you so
[1:15:21] desire. I found my bubble today.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah. I couldn't think about what
[1:15:27] you were doing or experiencing or
[1:15:29] feeling because he was so rich and so
[1:15:31] real to me. Aren't you glad to be in the
[1:15:33] house of the Lord
[1:15:35] today? Don't be rushing
[1:15:37] us. I'm so thankful that Brother Dylan
[1:15:41] sung that extra song and had Sister
[1:15:43] Rachel to come and sing it because it
[1:15:45] ministered to me. And I'm thankful that
[1:15:48] I know who's holding me. It's Jesus.
[1:15:55] I think I'm going to go get back in my
[1:15:57] bubble.
[1:15:59] It's Jesus that's holding me.
[1:16:02] I'm thankful that he still
[1:16:05] does. I want you to give thanks to God.
[1:16:08] And it's a little hot here. Uh I want
[1:16:12] you to give thanks to God for these
[1:16:14] musicians and the backup singers and the
[1:16:18] worship
[1:16:21] leader, the staff, all that group up
[1:16:25] there. I mean, the media team.
[1:16:30] Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God is good.
[1:16:36] Amen. I was just thinking as they were
[1:16:38] singing that song. I've known Sister
[1:16:41] Rachel's family for over 30 years. And
[1:16:45] who would have ever thought that a North
[1:16:48] Carolina girl like that? I remember when
[1:16:51] her mom and dad did not have children
[1:16:53] and were believing God and God gave him
[1:16:56] a miracle, several miracles. He's a
[1:16:59] miracle working God. Who would have ever
[1:17:01] thought that a North Carolina girl would
[1:17:04] have found a a Arizona
[1:17:07] boy and end up in North Carolina close
[1:17:12] enough to come and visit us. I'm
[1:17:14] thankful for that. I'm really thankful
[1:17:17] and I believe that that his whole heart
[1:17:19] is in doing something for Jesus. And
[1:17:22] yours ought to be too. Mine ought to be
[1:17:24] too. Amen. We ought to give him
[1:17:26] everything we have because this is the
[1:17:29] last of the last of the last. It's now
[1:17:32] or never, folks. I'm going to wait on
[1:17:35] you to get in here
[1:17:39] now. This is
[1:17:41] it. This is it. Only one life will soon
[1:17:45] be passed. Only what's done for Christ
[1:17:47] will last. But this is the closing hours
[1:17:51] of time. And what we do now is going to
[1:17:54] matter the most.
[1:17:56] And that doesn't include warming a
[1:17:58] pew. I would I tell you if I if I had
[1:18:02] to, I would run as fast as I could to
[1:18:04] the city of refuge because this is the
[1:18:07] hour to find your ark.
[1:18:10] The enemy's wild. He's getting wilder by
[1:18:14] the minute. And he's out to steal, to
[1:18:17] kill, and to destroy. You believe that?
[1:18:21] And he wants to do it in Christian
[1:18:23] families. He wants to do it everywhere
[1:18:26] and anywhere that a door will be open to
[1:18:28] him. So if there's ever been an hour to
[1:18:31] find your city of refuge, this is the
[1:18:33] hour to do that. It's now. It's time.
[1:18:37] You're hiding always, of course, in
[1:18:39] Christ. But I wouldn't dry up and die
[1:18:42] and blow away if I were you. I would
[1:18:46] find a a an atmosphere. I would build an
[1:18:49] atmosphere where the oil of the Holy
[1:18:52] Spirit can flow down. Amen.
[1:18:56] Is that the best you can do this
[1:18:58] morning? Can I have a little more? Amen.
[1:19:01] Amen. Can you get a little more with us?
[1:19:04] I saw Benjamin dragging us, so many of
[1:19:08] us into worship. That's when I found my
[1:19:10] bubble. I said, "Lord, it just doesn't
[1:19:12] matter to me. Uh uh you know, I uh know
[1:19:16] what it means to be tired and I know
[1:19:18] what it means uh to be weary and I know
[1:19:22] what it means uh to let your mind
[1:19:25] wander. But I'm telling you uh do
[1:19:28] everything you can not to be in that
[1:19:30] position as the word would come forth
[1:19:33] today because God wants to help us. If
[1:19:36] you believe the Lord wants to help us
[1:19:38] tonight, let me let me see your hand or
[1:19:40] today. I I'm sorry about saying tonight.
[1:19:44] I know it's not tonight. Uh we have some
[1:19:47] birthdays this week and I I hardly want
[1:19:50] to take time, but it's not because
[1:19:52] you're not very special. So, let me do
[1:19:55] it very very quickly. Uh well, what what
[1:19:58] about the blessing of having Sister Lily
[1:20:01] here one day before her birthday? Uh her
[1:20:04] birthday is tomorrow and uh we want to
[1:20:07] wish her a very happy birthday ahead of
[1:20:10] time and uh on the on Tuesday the 10th
[1:20:14] uh little Mercy turned seven. Is that
[1:20:17] right? Did I get the number right? Mercy
[1:20:20] turned seven. She was singing last
[1:20:23] night. I could hear her singing at the
[1:20:25] top of her strength giving God praise.
[1:20:28] And it's also Brother Magnus's birthday
[1:20:31] on Tuesday. And uh I know Sister Ginger
[1:20:35] would like to be with him. He would like
[1:20:37] to be with her, but they're apart right
[1:20:40] now. But we're sending a very happy
[1:20:42] birthday. Be sure to pass it on.
[1:20:44] Wherever Ginger is, be sure to pass it
[1:20:46] on to Brother Magnus. And although they
[1:20:49] don't attend church faithfully here in
[1:20:52] person, uh, Sister Martha especially is
[1:20:56] a faithful streamer. And um, they have a
[1:21:00] 25th anniversary, if I've got the
[1:21:02] numbers right. 25th wedding anniversary
[1:21:05] on Tuesday. Wednesday, Ariel Jernigan
[1:21:10] turns
[1:21:12] uh, stupenda 16.
[1:21:16] Now, how did that happen?
[1:21:18] I remember being in the living room
[1:21:21] while she was being born in the
[1:21:24] bedroom and I remember the look on her
[1:21:28] Mimi's face
[1:21:31] uh when she came out of the room and
[1:21:33] said, "Pray, Brother Shelly, now the
[1:21:36] cord is wrapped around her neck." I
[1:21:40] believe they said three times, two or
[1:21:43] three times. Jennifer, did they say that
[1:21:45] or am I making that up? just once
[1:21:49] wrapped around her neck. And the the
[1:21:51] truth is, if you've ever seen a blue
[1:21:54] baby, she was blue when she was born
[1:21:58] because of that cord cutting off her
[1:22:01] oxygen. But it didn't take her long to
[1:22:05] pink up and to be one of the prettiest
[1:22:08] babies I've ever seen in my life. And
[1:22:11] she is 16 years old on Wednesday. And
[1:22:14] that makes me feel like an old man.
[1:22:17] on Thursday, Sister Sharon's birthday.
[1:22:19] She is faithful to remember everybody's
[1:22:22] birthday, to show them some love and to
[1:22:25] pray for them, too. And her birthday is
[1:22:28] on Thursday, and we want to wish her a
[1:22:30] happy birthday. Thank her for the gift
[1:22:33] that she is to all of
[1:22:37] us. And on Friday, Sister Alita, I know
[1:22:42] uh Papa is not here, but uh you all are
[1:22:46] you've made it 45 years on Friday. I
[1:22:51] think you all can make it now to the
[1:22:53] rest of the way. 45 years. Let's give
[1:22:56] God thanks for helping them.
[1:23:00] 45
[1:23:05] years. That's a long time.
[1:23:08] to be married, isn't it? Yes, it is,
[1:23:12] pastor. It's a long time. It's a long
[1:23:15] time to be married to anybody, isn't it?
[1:23:17] Yes, it is, pastor. Yes, it is. Amen.
[1:23:22] We're going to have a lot of fun this
[1:23:23] morning. I can tell. Turn in your Bible,
[1:23:27] if you will. I want to carry this on
[1:23:31] just a little farther. I didn't know I
[1:23:33] would, but I have decided to. I want to
[1:23:37] take it just a little further and uh
[1:23:39] we'll even maybe do that in another
[1:23:41] session as
[1:23:45] well. I want us to turn to
[1:23:50] Galatians chapter 5. I'm going to read
[1:23:54] one verse verse
[1:23:57] 24. And they that are
[1:24:01] Christs, that is a possessive word
[1:24:04] there, apostrophe
[1:24:07] s, they that are
[1:24:10] Christs,
[1:24:12] have what is that next word?
[1:24:17] crucified the
[1:24:19] flesh with the
[1:24:23] affections and
[1:24:26] lusts that are tied to that flesh. Do
[1:24:31] you understand that? Now, that word
[1:24:34] crucified there is a word that means to
[1:24:38] drive down a stake.
[1:24:41] They that are Christ have driven a stake
[1:24:46] right through their
[1:24:49] flesh, and they have accepted the
[1:24:53] finished work of the cross. And the
[1:24:56] affections and lusts of the flesh are
[1:25:00] dead. Now, that's what the word said. If
[1:25:04] you believe that, you ought to say,
[1:25:06] "Amen." Amen. May God add his blessing
[1:25:09] to the reading of his word. You may be
[1:25:12] seated. Uh I want to read again for
[1:25:17] those of you who may not have heard. I'd
[1:25:20] like to just quickly read the little
[1:25:22] quote from George Fox that brother Gley
[1:25:25] was referring to. Would that be all
[1:25:27] right?
[1:25:28] I knew
[1:25:29] Jesus and he was precious to my
[1:25:34] soul. But I found something
[1:25:37] within that would not be
[1:25:40] sweet and
[1:25:42] patient and
[1:25:44] kind. I did what I could to keep it
[1:25:49] down, but it was
[1:25:52] there. Anybody relate to that?
[1:25:55] I besought Jesus to do something for me.
[1:25:59] And when I gave him my will, Hallelujah.
[1:26:04] When I gave him my will. And in order to
[1:26:07] give him our will, we must stop
[1:26:11] defending ourselves.
[1:26:15] We have no
[1:26:16] excuse. And therefore, we must not spend
[1:26:20] any time or effort defending
[1:26:23] ourselves. Instead, we should utilize
[1:26:26] all that time to surrender our will. Not
[1:26:29] my will, Lord. Not my will, Lord. Not my
[1:26:32] will, Lord, but your will be done. Do
[1:26:36] you believe that?
[1:26:38] All right. And I asked him, I besought
[1:26:41] him to do something for me. And when I
[1:26:42] gave him my will, he came in and he took
[1:26:46] out all that would not be sweet.
[1:26:53] and
[1:26:55] patient and
[1:26:57] kind and then he shut the
[1:27:00] door. Now, I appreciate that. I
[1:27:03] appreciate reading what George Fox had
[1:27:06] to say. He was the co-founder of the
[1:27:09] Society of Friends or the Quakers. He
[1:27:12] was a part of what we would call the
[1:27:15] sanctification or holiness
[1:27:18] movement. Uh he was considered a
[1:27:21] Puritan.
[1:27:22] uh what we would sometimes call a
[1:27:25] pilgrim, a purist at the word. And he
[1:27:29] was a part of a people who
[1:27:32] emphasized sanctification as another
[1:27:36] installment of grace. I also embrace
[1:27:41] that because I believe that though we
[1:27:45] are washed by the water of the word, it
[1:27:47] is not a once and for all deal. We are
[1:27:52] even today we're being cleaned up and
[1:27:54] cleansed by that word. Sanctification
[1:27:58] has to begin. That's right. But it's yet
[1:28:01] a process of God refining us and shaping
[1:28:07] us and molding us into his image. If you
[1:28:12] are like George Fox and like me and you
[1:28:16] have found something something in you
[1:28:20] that struggles yet to be uh kind and
[1:28:25] patient
[1:28:26] uh and loving then perhaps it's because
[1:28:30] you and I have not yet surrendered our
[1:28:33] full will to the Lord.
[1:28:36] Uh it's a laid down will. It's only dead
[1:28:39] men walking. It's only dead men who have
[1:28:43] the opportunity to see the glory of God.
[1:28:47] And we we are going to have to enter
[1:28:49] into his death and walk in it and remain
[1:28:54] in it and choose to be there with him in
[1:28:58] death and in resurrection. And we're
[1:29:01] going to have to consider that in his
[1:29:04] death, every sin that I would or have
[1:29:08] ever committed, it was already judged at
[1:29:11] the cross. Is that what the New
[1:29:14] Testament tells us? The penalty has
[1:29:17] already been paid. You're not paying the
[1:29:20] penalty. The penalty was paid on your
[1:29:23] behalf.
[1:29:25] Amen.
[1:29:26] He did it for me. He stood in mystead.
[1:29:31] He that knew no sin
[1:29:34] became sin. That is not just bearing sin
[1:29:39] like a load on your shoulder. The word
[1:29:42] there is become. He became sin so that
[1:29:48] you and I could have all of that settled
[1:29:52] when we take our fellowship with him and
[1:29:55] with the work of the cross. Amen.
[1:30:00] Amen.
[1:30:04] I'm very thankful for that.
[1:30:08] Now,
[1:30:10] folks, we want to go somewhere, don't
[1:30:13] we?
[1:30:15] You think you might stir yourself just a
[1:30:17] little, stir your faith just a little
[1:30:19] and and come, let's have church
[1:30:23] together. you want to wake up a little
[1:30:25] bit and be a little alert and see what
[1:30:28] the Lord will do for you. Uh if not, I
[1:30:32] wouldn't be offended if we just have a
[1:30:35] little prayer and uh go to lunch and go
[1:30:38] home and take a nap. It would certainly
[1:30:40] be all right with me. But what I'm not
[1:30:42] going to
[1:30:42] do I is is work myself into a sweat if
[1:30:48] you would rather be somewhere else.
[1:30:51] So, if you are ready now for just a
[1:30:54] little while to pull on that word and
[1:30:56] not be distracted by anything or anybody
[1:30:58] around you, then I'm here. I'm here and
[1:31:01] I'm ready and I'm willing. And I believe
[1:31:03] God wants to get something across to you
[1:31:07] and to me. And so, we'll try this uh
[1:31:11] believing that whatever it is that is
[1:31:13] weighing us down that God will give us
[1:31:16] grace. I don't know what you might have
[1:31:19] worn in here today. I I know I have also
[1:31:22] at times been guilty of wearing
[1:31:25] something in here. And when I do that, I
[1:31:28] have to do like you. I have to come and
[1:31:30] say, "Lord, knock that off of me. I've
[1:31:32] got to get that off." Whatever that is,
[1:31:35] because I'll never be able to relive the
[1:31:38] Sunday morning service of June 8th,
[1:31:41] 2025. I only get one chance at it. And
[1:31:45] whatever God wants to do for me today, I
[1:31:47] don't want to miss it. I I don't want to
[1:31:50] miss it. And nor do I want you to miss
[1:31:53] it. And I believe that uh this kind of
[1:31:57] preaching, teaching is a joint effort.
[1:32:00] It it has to be our faith pulling for
[1:32:05] our own life. We We got to get rid of
[1:32:07] this this carnal mind. We've got to get
[1:32:10] it pulled down. We've got to to move
[1:32:13] into finding whatever that something
[1:32:15] something is and doing something about
[1:32:18] it. And and what we do is so small in
[1:32:23] comparison to what he's already done.
[1:32:26] That's the point that we we want to make
[1:32:28] sure that it is made today that carnal
[1:32:32] mind resist. When the spirit of the Lord
[1:32:35] comes, even a carnal mind will start
[1:32:38] resisting the spirit. I I don't want to
[1:32:40] go there, but today, why don't you and I
[1:32:42] make up our minds? We want to go
[1:32:44] wherever it is that he desires to take
[1:32:47] us. Romans chapter 6, beginning in verse
[1:32:51] 7 said, "For he that is dead is freed
[1:32:55] from sin."
[1:32:57] Hallelujah. Now if we be dead with
[1:33:01] Christ, we believe that we shall also
[1:33:05] live with him, knowing that Christ being
[1:33:09] raised from the dead dieth no more. I'm
[1:33:13] glad once and for all. Death has been
[1:33:17] settled. Death hath no more what?
[1:33:20] Dominion. Dominion over him. It doesn't
[1:33:23] have any dominion over you and I either
[1:33:25] if we keep this word for in that he
[1:33:28] died, he died unto sin once, but in that
[1:33:32] he liveth,
[1:33:34] he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye
[1:33:37] also
[1:33:39] yourselves. Reckon, reckon ye also
[1:33:44] yourselves. That means adjust your
[1:33:47] thought process and instead of seeing
[1:33:51] yourself still under the burden of sin,
[1:33:55] adjust your mindset and realize that
[1:33:58] it's all covered. And our requirement is
[1:34:02] to fellowship with that price that's
[1:34:05] already been paid on our behalf. The
[1:34:08] only thing necessary then is for us when
[1:34:11] we recognize that we have failed is to
[1:34:13] say, "Lord, forgive me. I'm sorry that I
[1:34:17] missed the mark and I want to do and be
[1:34:21] everything that you have made possible
[1:34:23] for me in your sacrifice. I'm going to
[1:34:26] keep going on. I'm not going to quit."
[1:34:28] Now, I've said so often times when
[1:34:31] you're dieting or you know, uh that's
[1:34:34] not a good idea because the first three
[1:34:36] letters of diet are die. E die. But you
[1:34:40] you if you're adjusting your your eating
[1:34:43] pattern, you know, you you think, well,
[1:34:46] I've worked so hard. I deserve a piece
[1:34:49] of pie. And the next thing you know, uh
[1:34:52] one piece didn't do it. And and and if
[1:34:55] if you're not careful, you will undo all
[1:34:58] you've done by petting yourself and
[1:35:01] telling yourself what you deserve. I
[1:35:03] deserve a treat. This is kind of how
[1:35:06] unbelief creeps up in our life. I I
[1:35:09] deserve to relax. I I deserve to have
[1:35:12] some kind of entertainment. I I deserve
[1:35:16] a few minutes to clear my mind. If
[1:35:18] you're not careful, the enemy will take
[1:35:20] advantage of that. He will open up a
[1:35:22] door into your inner man and he will
[1:35:26] wrestle you right out of the promises of
[1:35:28] God. And the devil doesn't have to
[1:35:30] defeat you. You will disqualify and
[1:35:32] defeat yourself. We sabotage ourselves
[1:35:38] by not every time making the right
[1:35:40] choice. I'm taking God at his word. I'm
[1:35:43] believing your word, Lord. Now he said,
[1:35:46] "Let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:35:50] mortal body that ye should obey it in
[1:35:52] the lust thereof, neither yield ye your
[1:35:55] members," verse 13, as instruments of
[1:35:59] unrighteousness unto sin, but yield
[1:36:04] yourselves. Yield yourselves. Give up
[1:36:08] and let God. Somebody said, "How do you
[1:36:10] yield? Can you give me three steps to
[1:36:12] yielding?" Well, I don't know if I can
[1:36:15] drag it out to three steps. It's really
[1:36:18] simple. Really, it's more simple than
[1:36:20] what we've made it. It's let
[1:36:24] go and let
[1:36:27] God. Uh, you know, when I was a boy, we
[1:36:31] used to see these bumper stickers that
[1:36:33] said, "God is my co-pilot."
[1:36:37] Uh, and when I when I see that, I get an
[1:36:40] image in my mind of a car with two
[1:36:43] steering
[1:36:44] wheels. I'm on one side steering and
[1:36:47] God's on the other side and he's
[1:36:48] steering. How many of you know that'll
[1:36:50] never work?
[1:36:52] That will never work. What you need to
[1:36:54] do is let him take the wheel.
[1:36:58] You crawl in the back seat and let him
[1:37:01] drive. Let him lead. Let him guide. Let
[1:37:05] him be the one. A and stop trying to do
[1:37:08] it all yourself. Is that right?
[1:37:12] He's not our co-pilot. He's got to be
[1:37:16] the pilot. He's the leader. We're the
[1:37:19] follower. He's the one who goes before
[1:37:21] us as a forerunner and we follow after.
[1:37:24] Is that right?
[1:37:26] Neither yield ye your members as
[1:37:28] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,
[1:37:30] but yield yourselves unto God, as those
[1:37:33] that are alive from the dead, and your
[1:37:37] members as instruments, not of
[1:37:39] unrighteousness, but of righteousness
[1:37:42] unto God. Amen. For
[1:37:45] sin shall not have dominion over you.
[1:37:54] Is that right? For you are not under the
[1:37:59] law.
[1:38:04] Now, what law is he talking
[1:38:07] about? Well, if you're following the
[1:38:10] apostle in his writings, you will
[1:38:13] understand he's talking about the law of
[1:38:16] sin and death.
[1:38:18] You are not under the law of sin and
[1:38:23] death. You are under grace which the
[1:38:27] Bible calls the law of the spirit in
[1:38:30] Christ Jesus.
[1:38:33] That's liberty. That's not liberty to go
[1:38:36] against the word.
[1:38:38] That's liberty to make the right choice
[1:38:42] and to find the strength that you need
[1:38:44] to make it again and again and again.
[1:38:47] What then? Shall we sin because we are
[1:38:50] not under the law of sin and death but
[1:38:53] under
[1:38:54] grace? What did he write? God forbid.
[1:38:58] This is not a license to be carnal. This
[1:39:01] is not a license to be fleshly. This is
[1:39:04] not a license to choose unbelief. but
[1:39:07] rather this is a freedom to understand
[1:39:11] that we can't get good enough. It's his
[1:39:14] goodness. It's his righteousness that he
[1:39:16] dresses us in. Know ye not that, and
[1:39:20] this is very powerful here, don't miss
[1:39:22] this. Know ye not that to whom ye
[1:39:27] yield yourselves servants to
[1:39:32] obey? His servants ye are to whom ye
[1:39:39] obey.
[1:39:41] It's according to who you let drive.
[1:39:43] Right. If it's your desire driving, if
[1:39:46] it's your will driving, if it's what you
[1:39:49] want to see happen driving, you're
[1:39:52] liable to end up in the wrong location.
[1:39:54] But if it's the law of the spirit that's
[1:39:58] driving, he's never going to lead you
[1:40:00] into bondage. He's never going to lead
[1:40:03] you into unbelief. He's only going to
[1:40:05] lead you into the righteousness of Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ. Somebody ought to say, "Amen."
[1:40:11] Amen. I'll say it. I'll say it because
[1:40:14] it relieves such a burden off of our
[1:40:17] life that I've got to get good enough.
[1:40:22] I I've got to do it all just right every
[1:40:25] time. A and I'm not allowed uh uh even
[1:40:29] one carnal thought. Don't you understand
[1:40:32] that Jesus knows how the enemy is
[1:40:35] working overtime to pull you out of the
[1:40:38] program and the plan of God? And listen,
[1:40:41] listen here. He He He's extrauh vigilant
[1:40:45] and overly busy with you because you
[1:40:49] have identified yourself as a part of
[1:40:52] the bride of Jesus Christ. Satan has
[1:40:56] little to fear from the denominational
[1:40:59] church.
[1:41:03] She's too busy eating donuts on the
[1:41:05] front row.
[1:41:07] She's too busy wearing her cargo shorts
[1:41:10] and her baseball caps to church.
[1:41:13] She's too busy in this and that or the
[1:41:16] other.
[1:41:18] But it's you that have embraced the
[1:41:20] entirety of the word. It's you that have
[1:41:24] heard the eagle scream. It's you that
[1:41:27] have understood that you're not holding
[1:41:30] the word. The word is holding you. It's
[1:41:34] you that have understood that he saw you
[1:41:37] before you were ever born and he saw you
[1:41:40] choosing him and he gave you a prefix
[1:41:43] destiny that will take you all the way.
[1:41:47] He's not only Hallelujah. He's not only
[1:41:50] able to author your faith, he's able to
[1:41:53] finish it.
[1:41:57] The more attention you give your
[1:41:58] carnality, the more attention you give
[1:42:00] your flesh, the bigger it'll get.
[1:42:05] Oh, that old devil's never satisfied.
[1:42:07] You give him a little attention.
[1:42:12] And he just delights in that. Amen. All
[1:42:15] right. Know ye not that to whom you
[1:42:17] yield yourself servants to obey his
[1:42:19] servants you are to whom you you obey
[1:42:22] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:42:24] obedience unto righteousness. Oh Jesus
[1:42:28] we choose obedience today. We choose
[1:42:31] obedience to righteousness
[1:42:33] today. We don't choose another day. Not
[1:42:36] one more hour over there in this mindset
[1:42:40] of defeat of sin and death and unbelief.
[1:42:43] But today we identify with obedience and
[1:42:47] righteousness.
[1:42:48] Uh in the message, the greatest battle
[1:42:51] ever
[1:42:52] fought. Last night I read paragraph 129
[1:42:55] to 132. I want to go to 136 and and read
[1:42:59] it. I think I perhaps also read this,
[1:43:03] but I'm going to share it again. Uh
[1:43:08] Caleb. Oh, I called him by his name.
[1:43:12] John Caleb is what I call him, but his
[1:43:15] name is Caleb John. He walked up here
[1:43:17] last night. I was staggering, so tired.
[1:43:21] And he pulls out his Bible and out of
[1:43:23] his Bible bag, he pulls out his notebook
[1:43:26] and he's turning the pages through the
[1:43:28] notebook. He said, "I've got to find the
[1:43:30] Bible section." I mean, he is giving me
[1:43:34] a an explanation of every Well, that's
[1:43:36] my that's my And he comes to his Bible
[1:43:39] section and he's written a prayer
[1:43:42] inspired by the sermon last night. Is he
[1:43:45] in here? What did it say? What did it
[1:43:48] say, John
[1:43:49] Caleb? Do you
[1:43:53] remember? Cast Satan out with a simple
[1:43:58] prayer. I like that. Don't you? Cuz
[1:44:02] here's what the prophet said. 136. How
[1:44:05] does he get in? Through this mind, this
[1:44:08] door, the battlefront standing there.
[1:44:12] Now, when you get the battle set in
[1:44:15] array, now the devil is sitting right
[1:44:17] through every heart this morning. He's
[1:44:19] sitting, this little girl's heart. He's
[1:44:21] sitting at your hearts. He's sitting all
[1:44:23] around. He's saying, "Oh, I've seen you
[1:44:26] try before. I've heard that before."
[1:44:29] Come on. 138. What did it say? Cast him
[1:44:34] out. Cast That's all. Cast him out. What
[1:44:38] did the Bible say here? Cast him out.
[1:44:43] Casting him out. We've been trained. Who
[1:44:48] trained us? The word.
[1:44:50] Cast him out with a simple prayer.
[1:44:55] He cannot stay where he is not welcome.
[1:45:00] If you give him uh one little
[1:45:04] inch, you know what will happen? There
[1:45:07] is not a day that goes by that you and I
[1:45:11] can afford not to encounter the presence
[1:45:16] of Jesus.
[1:45:18] Every day. Somebody said every day.
[1:45:22] Well, how in the world do you think I
[1:45:25] could do it every day? Do you brush your
[1:45:27] teeth every day?
[1:45:30] You should
[1:45:33] you
[1:45:35] should you
[1:45:37] should your gum health is directly
[1:45:42] related to your heart health.
[1:45:45] It's very strange to think about the
[1:45:49] fact that you can take
[1:45:53] bacteria from your mouth and send it to
[1:45:57] your heart through your blood vessels.
[1:46:02] That's true. But it's
[1:46:05] true. And and if you're if you don't
[1:46:08] like those
[1:46:09] fancy toothbrushes, then you can do like
[1:46:13] my granddaddy said, they took a little
[1:46:16] cutting off of a sweet gum tree and
[1:46:19] scrubbed as much of the gunk off as they
[1:46:21] possibly could. I brushed my teeth every
[1:46:24] day more than
[1:46:26] once because I know now. I didn't used
[1:46:29] to know. As a kid, I never wanted to. As
[1:46:31] a kid, I had to be made. But once I
[1:46:34] understood that I could easily affect
[1:46:37] the the health of my heart by not
[1:46:39] brushing my teeth, brother, I want you
[1:46:41] to know I become very faithful.
[1:46:44] You do that every day. Don't you eat
[1:46:47] lunch every day? Most every day. If you
[1:46:50] don't eat lunch, you eat dinner or
[1:46:52] breakfast. You eat something. I can look
[1:46:55] at you and tell you're not starving to
[1:46:58] death. Don't you put on your socks every
[1:47:00] day? Maybe not in the summer, but every
[1:47:05] day. Don't Don't you don't you comb out
[1:47:08] your hair every day? Some of you can't
[1:47:12] answer because you look like you just
[1:47:14] got out of the
[1:47:15] bed. Uh uh there are so many things we
[1:47:18] do every day. So then we can certainly
[1:47:22] make sure that we have an engagement
[1:47:26] with the presence of the Lord every day.
[1:47:31] sit under the word every day. We can do
[1:47:34] it.
[1:47:37] There's got to be something smart about
[1:47:39] this thing. There's got to be some
[1:47:41] benefit to it. It's got to be more than
[1:47:45] just a time thief.
[1:47:47] Use it to sit under the word of the
[1:47:50] hour.
[1:47:51] Read your Bible.
[1:47:54] Brother Benham said a Christian reads
[1:47:56] his
[1:47:58] Bible not three times a week.
[1:48:03] every day. If I asked, I'm not, but if I
[1:48:07] asked, very few of
[1:48:10] us, unfortunately, would be able to
[1:48:13] save. I read mine every day. And this is
[1:48:17] why we have such a struggle with the
[1:48:20] something something
[1:48:22] because there's only one thing that can
[1:48:24] defeat the lies of the enemy and that's
[1:48:28] the word. Amen. Somebody say, "It's the
[1:48:32] word." Word.
[1:48:34] That's what defeats him. Not just once,
[1:48:38] but all the time. Every day of the week,
[1:48:41] cast him out. Make sure you have
[1:48:44] encountered the presence of the Lord
[1:48:47] every day. Amen.
[1:48:52] Sing. Sing to him.
[1:48:56] I may not want to hear you sing, but he
[1:49:00] does. And I like to hear you sing, too,
[1:49:02] if you can
[1:49:04] sing. I'm not real fond of caterwalling,
[1:49:08] but he
[1:49:09] is. You see, your pastor didn't say make
[1:49:12] a joyful noise. He did.
[1:49:16] What I say is make sure you've got with
[1:49:19] the the musicians and you know your
[1:49:22] key. That's what I say. But he says it
[1:49:25] don't matter whether it sounds melodious
[1:49:28] to anybody else. It doesn't matter
[1:49:30] whether you have changed the octave or
[1:49:32] whether you stay on pitch perfect or
[1:49:35] not. He wants to hear like Benjamin said
[1:49:38] I think this morning. He wants to hear
[1:49:40] your voice. He wants to hear you sing.
[1:49:44] He wants it to come from your heart.
[1:49:46] Doesn't matter what it sounds like going
[1:49:49] down the road in the truck. Sing him a
[1:49:50] song. Sing him a love song.
[1:49:54] Hallelujah. And he'll draw near. He'll
[1:49:56] draw near. If you draw nigh to him, he
[1:50:01] will draw nigh to you. It's a promise.
[1:50:04] And he's not a man that he should lie,
[1:50:07] neither the son of man that he would
[1:50:09] have need to repent. We got to do it.
[1:50:11] Well, I forget to do it. Write yourself
[1:50:13] a note.
[1:50:15] Hello. Write yourself a note. My my my I
[1:50:20] I I keep uh I keep that sticky note
[1:50:23] company in
[1:50:25] business. I keep them in business. Thank
[1:50:28] you, son. Because I have to remind
[1:50:32] myself of many, many, many different
[1:50:34] things.
[1:50:38] Things I ought to
[1:50:40] know. Things I ought to
[1:50:43] remember. I I I'm going to tell you
[1:50:46] something private.
[1:50:48] I'm going to let you
[1:50:49] in. I'm going to have to get me some
[1:50:52] waterproof
[1:50:54] ones and stick it in the
[1:50:59] shower because two times this week I
[1:51:02] have got out from the shower and
[1:51:05] realized that I forgot to
[1:51:07] rinse the soap under my right
[1:51:12] arm. But I don't think you ought to be
[1:51:15] telling that in the pull pit. I didn't
[1:51:16] ask
[1:51:17] you. And I'm standing there thinking,
[1:51:20] "What is wrong?" Yeah, I did. No, I
[1:51:25] didn't. Well, I don't want to get back
[1:51:27] in the shower, so I have to get a rag
[1:51:28] down. I have to rinse off. And you know,
[1:51:31] if you don't get all that soap out from
[1:51:33] under there, it'll itch.
[1:51:36] You'll be going to town itching like
[1:51:38] that. Whatever you have to do to remind
[1:51:42] yourself, it's a necessity.
[1:51:45] You don't want to go with soap under
[1:51:46] your arm all day. Whatever you have to
[1:51:49] do to remind yourself, I'm going to sing
[1:51:51] him a song. I'm going to read my Bible.
[1:51:54] I'm going to hear a piece of a sermon.
[1:51:56] I'm going to do something that causes me
[1:51:59] to be strengthened in the inner man so
[1:52:02] that I can every time, all the time,
[1:52:04] every time defeat the enemy. I will I
[1:52:08] will cast him out. Brother Caleb John as
[1:52:11] a with a simple prayer. I'll get it
[1:52:14] done. 1 Corinthians
[1:52:17] 15:31, I
[1:52:19] protest by your
[1:52:21] rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus
[1:52:25] our
[1:52:26] Lord. I
[1:52:30] die
[1:52:35] daily. This is so
[1:52:40] contrary to our nature.
[1:52:44] It's
[1:52:45] also often times
[1:52:48] preached and it becomes
[1:52:51] contrary to the
[1:52:54] gospel. I mentioned a a scripture last
[1:52:57] night to know him in the fellowship of
[1:52:59] his suffering and how that is sometimes
[1:53:03] misapplied and people think that I I
[1:53:06] must suffer more. I've got to just keep
[1:53:08] on suffering so that I can be like the
[1:53:11] Lord. And you read that in context and
[1:53:13] that's not what he's saying at all. To
[1:53:15] fellowship with his suffering is not to
[1:53:18] keep suffering every day of your
[1:53:20] Christian life. That's a
[1:53:21] misunderstanding of the verse.
[1:53:24] It means that I must find myself
[1:53:29] identified
[1:53:32] with his suffering and understand that
[1:53:37] he suffered so that I don't have to
[1:53:39] always Amen. Suffer. It's a mixture of
[1:53:43] suffering and blessing. Aren't you glad?
[1:53:46] It's not always suffering. It's a
[1:53:50] mixture. Because what we must do is find
[1:53:53] oursel in that in that rock of ages in
[1:53:57] that place of the rock that has been
[1:54:00] smitten on your behalf and my behalf. We
[1:54:04] have to keep like the little eagle that
[1:54:05] has to go back to the to the rock that
[1:54:08] he was born on and clean up some of the
[1:54:11] things that life have caused harm to his
[1:54:15] body. You and I have to get back to the
[1:54:18] rock. We've got to go all the way back
[1:54:20] to the smitten rock. That smitten rock
[1:54:23] wasn't just a rock in Horeb, but Paul
[1:54:26] received by Revelation that rock. They
[1:54:29] all ate the same spiritual meat. They
[1:54:32] all drank.
[1:54:34] Hello. 1 Corinthians 10. They They all
[1:54:37] drank the same spiritual drink. They
[1:54:40] drank from the rock
[1:54:43] that what that followed them. And that
[1:54:47] rock was what? It was Christ. We've got
[1:54:51] to get back to the rock. Back to the
[1:54:55] Christ. I heard brother Brandham say
[1:54:58] again recently, I am convinced that we
[1:55:02] are not getting people to Christ.
[1:55:09] What do you think he would say today?
[1:55:14] When they preach two hours about a
[1:55:17] cloud,
[1:55:22] oh, I should have left that out.
[1:55:25] You'll go back to quiet. Some of you
[1:55:27] will.
[1:55:28] Streamers are clicking off. Go right
[1:55:30] ahead. Don't don't don't bother to hang
[1:55:32] around. But the truth is the truth.
[1:55:37] You don't have to continue to prove to
[1:55:39] somebody the supernatural nature of a
[1:55:43] cloud. That's not what we are called to
[1:55:46] do in this hour. Play the tape. Hear
[1:55:49] what brother Brandham said. Believe it
[1:55:51] if you have faith to believe it. But
[1:55:53] what our responsibility is as a
[1:55:55] five-fold ministry is not to convince
[1:55:58] people of the ministry of brother
[1:56:00] Brandham. Our ministry is to get people
[1:56:03] to Christ. Get them to Christ. Don't get
[1:56:08] them to us.
[1:56:11] Get them to Christ. Don't get them to a
[1:56:14] messenger. Get them to the message. And
[1:56:17] the message is the revelation of Jesus
[1:56:20] Christ. Amen. Some of that revelation
[1:56:24] lays on magnetic tapes and printed
[1:56:27] books, but everything there is not a
[1:56:29] part of that revelation. But here is
[1:56:32] what he said. The Bible is the
[1:56:35] revelation of Jesus Christ in fullness
[1:56:38] and in entirety. It's there. It's in the
[1:56:42] word. It's in the book. And when we hear
[1:56:45] our preacher say something that lines up
[1:56:47] with the book, we've heard the message
[1:56:49] of Jesus Christ. When we hear a prophet
[1:56:52] messenger say something that lays in
[1:56:54] that book with a doveetail, then we know
[1:56:57] that we have heard the message, the
[1:56:59] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:04] That's what we're that's the only thing
[1:57:07] that's going to get us
[1:57:09] beyond this great battle.
[1:57:15] Not quote you. You're not going to be
[1:57:16] able to quote the devil off your porch.
[1:57:18] I'm telling you. I know. I know I know
[1:57:21] that many will give it the same uh
[1:57:25] power, the same quality, the same
[1:57:27] inherency of scripture. That's an error.
[1:57:29] It's absolutely an error. That is not
[1:57:32] what he preached. That is not what he
[1:57:34] believed. And he said, in fact, if you
[1:57:37] embrace those kinds of things, you're
[1:57:38] looking to me.
[1:57:40] Don't look to me.
[1:57:43] Why would he say such a thing? because
[1:57:45] he knew as a human as as a man he would
[1:57:48] have the tendency to fail. But if he
[1:57:51] could get you really connected to the
[1:57:54] one who never fails,
[1:57:57] then when you find out that your pastor
[1:57:59] is a human or you find out that your
[1:58:01] prophet is a human, you won't be shaken
[1:58:04] right out of your faith. You'll run
[1:58:07] right to the rock. You'll go right back
[1:58:10] to the absolute again and again and
[1:58:13] again.
[1:58:17] Oh, that's why I don't make the big
[1:58:18] meetings
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:22] anymore. I die daily. The amplified
[1:58:26] said, I face death every day and die to
[1:58:31] self. It's a decision.
[1:58:34] It's a decision. This means that the
[1:58:36] apostle Paul chose on a daily basis to
[1:58:41] deny
[1:58:42] himself and follow
[1:58:44] Jesus. It means that the that the
[1:58:47] Apostle Paul Oh, I forgot I gave it you
[1:58:49] to you. To deny his own thoughts, to
[1:58:53] deny the lies that Satan whispered to
[1:58:56] him through his flesh, to deny anything
[1:58:59] and everything that is contrary to the
[1:59:03] spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Let me
[1:59:05] read it again. This scripture, I die
[1:59:07] daily. It means that the Apostle Paul
[1:59:10] chose on a daily basis to deny himself
[1:59:13] and follow Jesus. To deny his own
[1:59:15] thoughts, to deny the lies that Satan
[1:59:18] whispered to him through his flesh, to
[1:59:20] deny anything and everything that is
[1:59:23] contrary to the spirit of life in Christ
[1:59:25] Jesus. That is how the Apostle Paul died
[1:59:28] daily. It's a daily decision. It's
[1:59:32] powerful.
[1:59:33] It's powerful. You say, "Well, why would
[1:59:36] I need to die daily if I'm already dead
[1:59:38] to sin?" It's it's simply because it's a
[1:59:41] daily decision. We keep making that
[1:59:42] right decision. One day, one day
[1:59:45] choosing to make the wrong decision,
[1:59:47] brother, and you'll find yourself on a
[1:59:49] bunny trail out there uh that you don't
[1:59:51] want to be on. It can happen. One wrong
[1:59:53] move and you'll be way out there
[1:59:55] somewhere. This spirit is a sed is a
[1:59:58] seductive and seducing spirit and it
[2:00:01] wants to pull you off the word. You got
[2:00:05] to know where where you stand and you
[2:00:07] can't know where you stand if you don't
[2:00:08] know the word you stand on. Is that
[2:00:10] right? God's provided way. Paragraph 27,
[2:00:14] he said, "And you're bound to be
[2:00:17] backsliding
[2:00:19] constantly because it's just about
[2:00:21] impossible to always be moving forward."
[2:00:25] And we define backsliding as not always
[2:00:28] going
[2:00:30] backward. Sometimes you can be
[2:00:32] backsliding standing still.
[2:00:36] There's a time to stand still and see
[2:00:38] the salvation of the Lord there. But
[2:00:41] there's a time to be moving when God
[2:00:43] says to move. If God's telling you to
[2:00:45] move into something spiritually and
[2:00:47] you're still standing still, did you
[2:00:49] know that's backsliding?
[2:00:53] Why? Why is that backsliding, pastor?
[2:00:55] Because he's up there.
[2:00:57] The pillar of fire is leading you on and
[2:01:00] you're back here. You're way back here
[2:01:02] and he's way up there. So, you don't
[2:01:04] have to be actively moving backward.
[2:01:08] But by not following him as he goes
[2:01:10] ahead, you're already finding yourself
[2:01:13] in a backsliding place. So, it
[2:01:15] takes what does it take? Constant
[2:01:18] prayer. A constant prayer to God. Paul
[2:01:23] said, "I die daily." Here he is quoting
[2:01:25] that portion of scripture. And if Paul
[2:01:28] had to die daily, how much more am I
[2:01:30] going? I'm going to have to stay dead
[2:01:32] all the time. If Paul had to die daily
[2:01:35] to stay right with God, and so we'll all
[2:01:37] have to do that. Just die out to
[2:01:40] ourselves, deny ourselves, and that's
[2:01:42] getting God's way. You follow this? Now,
[2:01:46] there's only two ways of anything.
[2:01:49] That's the right way and the wrong way.
[2:01:52] And them ways are your ways and God's
[2:01:55] ways. That's right. Right way, wrong
[2:02:00] way. Let let me say wrong way, right
[2:02:02] way. Right way, wrong way. Then brother
[2:02:05] Brandham says the right way is God's
[2:02:09] way. The wrong way is your way. And you
[2:02:13] can't be in your
[2:02:16] way and God's way at the same time.
[2:02:21] I'm often praying,
[2:02:23] Lord, help me not to get in your way.
[2:02:28] I don't want to be in the way of what
[2:02:31] you desire to do. I don't want some
[2:02:35] protocol, some starchy uh uh uh form or
[2:02:41] system
[2:02:43] uh some kind of imitation, some
[2:02:46] something
[2:02:47] something to to cause me to get in your
[2:02:50] way. I want to move when you move. I
[2:02:53] want to pause when you pause. I want to
[2:02:57] be fluid. Is there anybody else in this
[2:02:59] house that you have that desire? We like
[2:03:02] our comfort zones, don't we? And so God
[2:03:05] lets us camp a while. He lets the fire
[2:03:08] uh remain stationary for a while, but
[2:03:11] then there comes a time that God said,
[2:03:13] "I'm going to take you in to a deeper
[2:03:15] place." It's not some new revelation
[2:03:17] that we're talking about, but it is a
[2:03:20] further driving down of that revelation
[2:03:24] into your inner being. You're not
[2:03:27] looking for new truth. The truth is the
[2:03:29] truth. You're looking for God to make
[2:03:32] that truth so real to you that you can
[2:03:37] use that truth to defeat your enemy.
[2:03:41] That's where we are. That's what we have
[2:03:43] need of. I've got to move along now. Uh
[2:03:46] and I will try my best to do that. So he
[2:03:50] said them ways are your ways and God's
[2:03:53] way. And you can't be in your way and
[2:03:54] God's way at the same time. You got to
[2:03:56] forget your own way to get in God's way.
[2:04:00] And you got to get out of your own way
[2:04:03] to get in God's way. For as long as
[2:04:07] you're in your own way, you're out of
[2:04:10] his way. Is that complicated? Can you
[2:04:12] follow that? So
[2:04:17] forsake I die daily.
[2:04:21] Paul said, "It's a constant and daily
[2:04:25] perpetual decision to forsake my way and
[2:04:29] to choose his way." It cost you
[2:04:32] sometime.
[2:04:36] It cost you
[2:04:38] sometime
[2:04:43] lots. that little chorus that
[2:04:46] brother Cade went into there at the end
[2:04:49] of a song. I didn't know he was going to
[2:04:51] do that. And I have to be honest, I've
[2:04:53] wanted someone to sing that, but I sure
[2:04:56] wasn't going to put that on
[2:04:58] somebody because when I heard it, I
[2:05:01] heard it on a clip of a secular
[2:05:04] television show where people
[2:05:06] compete to see who is going to win a big
[2:05:11] recording contract or something.
[2:05:14] this big old dark skinned
[2:05:17] boy. How old was
[2:05:20] he? 17 years
[2:05:22] old. Walks out there in this little clip
[2:05:26] and and uh he's going to
[2:05:29] sing and that's what he starts singing.
[2:05:31] And oh my, I can listen to it over and
[2:05:35] over again and every time I hear it, it
[2:05:38] goes right way down into my inner being.
[2:05:41] Lord, show me your glory. I want to see
[2:05:45] your glory. I've got to see your glory.
[2:05:49] Less of me and more of you. I want to
[2:05:52] see your
[2:05:55] glory. And uh I thought, well, I would
[2:05:58] sure like for somebody to sing it, but
[2:05:59] if anybody's ever heard him sing it, I I
[2:06:02] think you'd almost feel
[2:06:04] like wouldn't be no need to try.
[2:06:08] But I appreciate the confidence that our
[2:06:11] brothers showed today to say, "Hey, I
[2:06:13] might not be that big and I might not be
[2:06:16] that skin tone and I might not be able
[2:06:18] to do them trills and squeals and
[2:06:22] whatever, but I'm going to sing it
[2:06:24] because nonetheless, it is the truth.
[2:06:27] Less of
[2:06:30] me and more of you because I want to see
[2:06:34] your glory. And only dead men see your
[2:06:36] glory.
[2:06:38] So I got to figure this out. For as long
[2:06:40] as you're in your own way, you're out of
[2:06:42] his way. So forsake your ways, forsake
[2:06:44] your thoughts, forsake everything, and
[2:06:47] just rely on one thing. Thus saith the
[2:06:52] Lord.
[2:06:56] That's all. Then you know you're right.
[2:07:01] Somebody said, "Well, then he must have
[2:07:02] certainly been referring to only the the
[2:07:05] tapes and the Of course, that's not what
[2:07:08] he was referring to. He's referring uh
[2:07:11] to the absolute." And he's referring to
[2:07:15] because if you if you believe that only
[2:07:17] brother Brandham knew anything about
[2:07:19] thus sayaith the Lord then you don't
[2:07:20] believe what he said because he said
[2:07:22] that little bride in the last days she
[2:07:25] would have thus saith the Lord or she
[2:07:29] would hold her peace. Yes. So there must
[2:07:33] be a people being prepared now
[2:07:37] who will use that authority of the
[2:07:40] creative spoken word to see God prove
[2:07:43] again himself to be the same yesterday,
[2:07:46] today, and forever. That's what I
[2:07:48] believe. And I'll never be satisfied
[2:07:51] with only testimonies of what he did. I
[2:07:55] have got to believe that he still will
[2:07:58] and that he still can. And like brother
[2:08:00] Greley said, well, sometimes we get
[2:08:02] tired of waiting, but we know that
[2:08:05] there's a promise
[2:08:07] and we got to get rid of some things.
[2:08:09] We've got to get rid of some of our our
[2:08:11] grieviances and our offenses and all
[2:08:14] that go along with that. And we've got
[2:08:15] to get rid of our own ways and choosing
[2:08:18] our own carnal thoughts. That's part of
[2:08:20] what we got to get out of our
[2:08:22] lives. Replace it with the mighty word
[2:08:25] of God.
[2:08:27] And then here's another one. Uh, Caleb,
[2:08:30] write this down. Get some of this and do
[2:08:32] something with this one. This is a good
[2:08:34] one. Uh, in 19 uh 54, oh, but it's good.
[2:08:40] Paragraph 86 of the invasion, he said,
[2:08:43] "Nothing
[2:08:44] less. He that will follow me, let him
[2:08:48] deny himself, take up his cross, and die
[2:08:52] daily."
[2:08:57] stay
[2:09:01] dead. How can he tell
[2:09:05] us in the same
[2:09:08] phrase, you've got to die daily and
[2:09:12] you've got to stay
[2:09:14] dead. How can you die daily if you're
[2:09:18] already dead?
[2:09:21] This is one of those paradoxes of the
[2:09:24] New
[2:09:25] Testament because the New Testament
[2:09:28] reveals that our death is in him. That's
[2:09:31] right. Therefore, he died and we died
[2:09:35] with him. That's what the New Testament
[2:09:38] teaches us over and over and over and
[2:09:42] over again. Colossians, Galatians,
[2:09:45] Ephesians, Romans, on and on. And we're
[2:09:49] taught that our
[2:09:53] identification is in his death. When he
[2:09:56] died, we died. And
[2:09:59] yet the same apostle said I have to die
[2:10:03] daily because it's it's a daily decision
[2:10:07] as we just said a daily
[2:10:09] decision to pull down a carnal nature to
[2:10:13] pull down that prickly nature and to
[2:10:16] always submit everything to to his
[2:10:20] nature to his will to his way. stay
[2:10:23] dead there
[2:10:27] on the
[2:10:31] cross. Now, I find a little something
[2:10:34] interesting here. I'm not trying to make
[2:10:36] a big doctrine out of this, but he
[2:10:39] nonetheless, he that will follow me, let
[2:10:42] him deny himself, take up his
[2:10:46] cross, and die daily. Stay dead there
[2:10:51] on the
[2:10:53] cross. The
[2:10:55] cross. He didn't say stay dead on your
[2:10:59] cross, but stay dead on the cross. There
[2:11:03] is both revelations of the New Testament
[2:11:07] in not only the same chapter as we've
[2:11:09] read it, but in the in the same quote of
[2:11:11] the prophet. You've got a cross to
[2:11:13] carry.
[2:11:16] Jesus said, "Take it up. Take up your
[2:11:19] cross and follow me." That's part of the
[2:11:23] instruction. And here is the other part
[2:11:25] of the instruction. And stay dead on the
[2:11:28] cross. the cross of Christ, the one
[2:11:32] where he died. Identify yourself while
[2:11:36] you're dying daily to the flesh.
[2:11:38] Continue to identify yourself with your
[2:11:41] death on the cross.
[2:11:44] Because there's some part of us that
[2:11:45] died on that cross when he died. If you
[2:11:49] believe that, you can squeeze out an
[2:11:51] amen. It's the hardest message that I've
[2:11:53] ever tried to present to this body. I've
[2:11:56] been presenting it off and on for over
[2:11:59] 20 years I think maybe even longer than
[2:12:02] that and people sometime want to draw up
[2:12:05] because they would rather believe that
[2:12:09] you have to uh spend the rest of your
[2:12:12] life in this guilt and condemnation and
[2:12:15] struggle than to realize your victory is
[2:12:18] one revelation away.
[2:12:23] You know how to deal with us. Get a
[2:12:25] revelation. Get a revelation that you
[2:12:28] died with him at the cross.
[2:12:30] And all you have to do is deny that part
[2:12:33] every day and say, "I choose your part,
[2:12:36] Lord. I choose what you've done on my
[2:12:38] behalf." Amen. If you uh someone asked
[2:12:42] me recently if
[2:12:44] maybe maybe shock therapy
[2:12:50] because they're using physical shock
[2:12:54] therapy to try to
[2:12:56] reprogram people who have perverted
[2:13:02] identities. And uh the reality is you I
[2:13:06] mean you'd you'd be
[2:13:09] electrocuted because until that devil is
[2:13:11] driven out of your life, those thoughts
[2:13:14] are always going to harass you. And
[2:13:17] therefore you you you you'd electrocute
[2:13:20] yourself if you're trying to rewire your
[2:13:22] brain that way. You that that is that
[2:13:25] could not be your answer. Your answer
[2:13:28] has to be making up your mind to deny
[2:13:33] yourself and choose the finished work of
[2:13:37] the
[2:13:38] cross. That's the only way. Then that
[2:13:42] devil has no place to stay. He becomes
[2:13:45] extremely uncomfortable with the
[2:13:48] atmosphere that you've created. Give me
[2:13:50] I was just fixed to finish that one.
[2:13:52] Sorry. Stay
[2:13:54] dead there on the cross. That's right.
[2:13:57] Agony. The way I'll take the way. You
[2:14:02] sing with the Lord's
[2:14:04] despised few. Is that the way you want
[2:14:08] to take? You'll never be in the big
[2:14:10] crowds. You'll never run with the best
[2:14:12] of the runners. But I tell you, you're
[2:14:15] running with the elect if you choose to
[2:14:18] remain with the Lord's despised few. Can
[2:14:21] anybody say amen? Amen. Romans 7:21, I
[2:14:25] find then a law that when I would do
[2:14:30] good, evil is present with me. Let me
[2:14:34] tell you what he said about it.
[2:14:35] Questions and answers. He said, "You are
[2:14:37] an outward man which isn't controlled by
[2:14:41] six
[2:14:42] senses. You are an inward man controlled
[2:14:46] by one sense which is faith. And this
[2:14:51] faith
[2:14:53] disagrees with all six
[2:14:56] senses. If the six senses doesn't agree
[2:15:00] with
[2:15:03] faith, one
[2:15:05] is contrary to the other. Now, as long
[2:15:09] as the six senses agree with the faith,
[2:15:12] wonderful. But when the six senses
[2:15:14] disagree with faith, then
[2:15:17] what? Leave it alone.
[2:15:20] Now for instance, Jesus made a
[2:15:23] statement, a promise. The inside man
[2:15:26] says that's true. Follow this slowly.
[2:15:30] The outside man reasons.
[2:15:34] It can't be true. Then ignore the
[2:15:36] outside man.
[2:15:41] And accept the inside man.
[2:15:46] Now, that's the same thing that Paul's
[2:15:48] speaking
[2:15:50] of. He was sold under the
[2:15:54] law. I'm going on to
[2:15:58] carnal sin. Every one of us is the same.
[2:16:02] That's the reason we have troubles. We
[2:16:04] do married four or five times. I want to
[2:16:07] say two or three
[2:16:09] times. and this and that and all kinds
[2:16:12] of sin and adulteries and everything
[2:16:14] else along in our lives. It's because of
[2:16:17] those things. It's because there's a
[2:16:20] carnal nature saying one thing
[2:16:24] and there's an inward man saying another
[2:16:26] thing.
[2:16:28] If you listen to the outward nature, it
[2:16:30] will always choose the way of the flesh.
[2:16:32] But if you listen to the inside nature,
[2:16:35] if you've been regenerated by the Holy
[2:16:37] Spirit, then you will always have a
[2:16:40] voice inside telling you God's way every
[2:16:46] time. We're carnal and that part must
[2:16:49] perish. Anybody hearing that? But then
[2:16:52] inside we're a spirit man, soul inside
[2:16:56] and that's faith in God's word.
[2:17:04] Then we bring our outside
[2:17:07] body under subjection to the word by
[2:17:10] faith by accepting
[2:17:12] what
[2:17:14] God
[2:17:16] said. He could never
[2:17:18] lie. He's
[2:17:20] trustworthy. And then Paul says in the
[2:17:22] next verse, stay with me another moment
[2:17:24] or
[2:17:27] two. In verse 22, he said, "For I
[2:17:31] delight in the law of
[2:17:34] God after the
[2:17:37] inward
[2:17:42] man." That word delight means to rejoice
[2:17:45] with one another. That inward man is the
[2:17:47] inside of the
[2:17:49] inside. In Romans 7:23 goes on, I'm just
[2:17:52] reading verse by verse. But I see
[2:17:54] another law in my
[2:17:55] members waring against the law of my
[2:17:59] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[2:18:03] the law of sin which is in my members.
[2:18:06] This is not a ranked sinner who's saying
[2:18:08] this. This is the first church age
[2:18:10] messenger. This is the apostle Paul. He
[2:18:14] recognizes that at all times there's
[2:18:16] another law that's trying to
[2:18:19] win. Yes, sir. Still there. Still
[2:18:22] something. Rising up to keep him from
[2:18:26] being patient and kind, etc., etc.,
[2:18:29] trying to bring me into captivity to the
[2:18:31] law of sin which is in my members. Now,
[2:18:36] here's what brother Bram said about that
[2:18:37] verse. He said, Paul said,
[2:18:40] then questions and answers with my mind.
[2:18:43] Listen, with my mind, and I have the
[2:18:46] mind of
[2:18:47] Christ. Paragraph
[2:18:50] 102. I serve God with my
[2:18:54] mind, but my
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:18:57] flesh, but with the flesh. Let me give
[2:19:00] you just a minute. That's
[2:19:02] 59
[2:19:04] 122359 paragraph
[2:19:07] 102 of questions and answers. Just
[2:19:10] questions and answers. Not number four,
[2:19:13] number three, number two.
[2:19:16] Paul said then, I just really want you
[2:19:18] to see it because it get it gets a
[2:19:21] little
[2:19:23] bouncy.
[2:19:25] Hallelujah. Praise God. He's
[2:19:29] worthy. I have the victory in Christ
[2:19:37] Jesus. Probably on the new that
[2:19:40] you sent this
[2:19:42] morning. You're just going to wait.
[2:19:44] Yeah. Unless they tell me they don't
[2:19:47] have it, then I'm going to go
[2:19:51] on. Good time to get a
[2:19:55] breath. Hallelujah. I hear somebody
[2:19:59] snoring. You know it's quiet in church
[2:20:01] when you can hear a kid
[2:20:03] snoring. I assume it's a kid. If it's an
[2:20:05] adult, throw a song book at him.
[2:20:10] Paul said then with my
[2:20:13] mind and I have the mind of Christ. You
[2:20:15] see he said I serve God with my
[2:20:19] mind but my flesh but with the
[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:24] flesh I'm serving the law of sin. He's
[2:20:28] telling us what Paul said in this verse
[2:20:31] of
[2:20:32] scripture. What is it my flesh says
[2:20:35] tonight? You're too
[2:20:39] tired. Let me make sure I make some eye
[2:20:41] contact
[2:20:44] here. This is his lie on Tuesday night
[2:20:47] to some of
[2:20:50] you. To the rest of us, he knows it's a
[2:20:54] waste of time.
[2:20:56] Brother Greley, I know you'll be ready,
[2:20:58] but but but wouldn't it just shake you a
[2:21:01] little bit or just disturb you or just
[2:21:02] make you think, what is wrong with that
[2:21:04] pastor of mine? If I texted you on
[2:21:06] Tuesday and just said, you know,
[2:21:07] brother, I've had a hard day today. I'm
[2:21:09] just a little tired. I don't feel very
[2:21:11] well. I'm feeling unwell and I I'm I'm
[2:21:15] not going to be there tonight. So, just
[2:21:16] do whatever you can do. And if I feel
[2:21:19] like it, I'll be there on
[2:21:22] Sunday. I know you're not going to say
[2:21:24] much.
[2:21:26] You're not going to laugh. You're not
[2:21:28] going to even smile. But it's the truth.
[2:21:32] How do you think I get
[2:21:33] here? Because I know there's not much of
[2:21:36] a choice if I don't let brother Gley
[2:21:39] know he's still a working man. And if I
[2:21:41] don't let him know ahead of time, he
[2:21:42] hasn't had any time to prepare. Would
[2:21:44] that be fair to do that to him simply
[2:21:47] because I just don't feel like? If you
[2:21:50] live by your feelings, I won't see you.
[2:21:52] That's why we don't see some today.
[2:21:55] They're living by their feeling this
[2:21:57] morning. I I if I do that, if I were to
[2:21:59] ever start doing that, I know the I
[2:22:01] wouldn't be able to
[2:22:02] stop. If I ever got to enjoy, not
[2:22:07] because I was sick, but just because I
[2:22:09] was tired of sitting at home in my boy,
[2:22:13] I have a recliner.
[2:22:18] just don't need me to get up real fast
[2:22:20] because I
[2:22:22] can't because you have to press a button
[2:22:25] to to get
[2:22:26] up to get out of it. You have to make it
[2:22:29] go down and come
[2:22:31] up. And uh if I could just experience
[2:22:34] once or twice sitting in that recliner
[2:22:37] watching the service, I believe I could
[2:22:40] have a good atmosphere at home. I
[2:22:41] believe I could. But if I ever did that
[2:22:44] a time or two, you know what had
[2:22:46] happened to me? my old flesh would say.
[2:22:49] They don't even need you over there. You
[2:22:51] just stay here and take it easy. Are you
[2:22:55] with me? Oh, somebody said, "I I'm not I
[2:22:58] can't come to church. I've got a
[2:22:59] headache." Only God knows the times that
[2:23:04] that brother Gley or brother Shelley
[2:23:06] have stood here for 30 plus years, 35
[2:23:11] soon with a headache, with a belly
[2:23:15] ache, having to leave the pool pit for a
[2:23:18] minute or two to go to the
[2:23:21] bathroom. On my 50th birthday, I had to
[2:23:24] leave the pool pit to go and vomit so
[2:23:27] that I could come back and finish what I
[2:23:30] was here to do. But folks, you just have
[2:23:33] to make sure that you don't let your
[2:23:36] flesh win.
[2:23:38] If you're contagious, that's another
[2:23:40] thing. But but let me tell you
[2:23:43] something. Tiredness is contagious, too.
[2:23:46] It was all over this church this morning
[2:23:48] like a disease spreading faster than a
[2:23:51] virus. And you got to just do what you
[2:23:54] do and
[2:23:56] say, "I love what, brother. I love this.
[2:24:00] It's getting so quiet, but I'm good. I'm
[2:24:02] good now. Don't worry about me. I'm all
[2:24:04] right now." He said, "You're too tired.
[2:24:06] Your throat is too sore."
[2:24:13] I I've had people say, "I'm
[2:24:17] horse." I don't know how many times
[2:24:19] we've had to preach horse. How many
[2:24:21] times someone's had to lead the worship,
[2:24:23] Benjamin, lead the worship. Horse
[2:24:26] sometimes sore
[2:24:29] throat. Been out in the wind today. You
[2:24:31] shall not go to church tonight. I love
[2:24:33] the way he said you shall. It makes it
[2:24:36] religious. He knows what he's doing.
[2:24:38] You've been out in the wind today. You
[2:24:40] shall not go to church tonight. He said,
[2:24:42] "That's the law of the flesh. You've got
[2:24:46] an obligation. You have to be somewhere.
[2:24:48] You I understand that's not
[2:24:51] even faintly what we're talking about,
[2:24:54] nor what brother Brandham was talking."
[2:24:55] He said, "What is it? My flesh says
[2:24:58] tonight you're too tired." He said,
[2:25:00] "That's the law of the flesh." Now, my
[2:25:05] mind on the inside, the Holy Spirit
[2:25:08] said, "You keep your
[2:25:12] promise." You You remember you said,
[2:25:14] "Lord, I'll go where you want me to go.
[2:25:16] I'll do what you want me to do. I'll say
[2:25:18] if you'll just use
[2:25:22] me." That's like somebody who tells me,
[2:25:25] "I I feel like I'm called to be a
[2:25:28] missionary to the foreign field." And
[2:25:31] you ask them, "Do you know your
[2:25:32] neighbor's name?
[2:25:35] Have you ever invited your neighbor to
[2:25:37] find
[2:25:38] Christ? You know, the one you've been
[2:25:40] disputing with over the mailbox.
[2:25:43] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not
[2:25:45] needed on the foreign mission field yet
[2:25:49] until you can learn to make whoever God
[2:25:51] puts in your life.
[2:25:57] I told you about the FedEx guy
[2:26:00] and somebody told me how frustrated
[2:26:03] Nathan was on uh after the service here
[2:26:06] the other night. He was frustrated and
[2:26:09] pretty sure that that was the same guy
[2:26:12] uh I'll just say that guy that had done
[2:26:16] that. You know, I told you he hit his
[2:26:18] head and he was seeing
[2:26:19] stars and I ran after him to tell him,
[2:26:23] "Please don't drive across the grass."
[2:26:25] And I was calm when I got there. Thank
[2:26:27] the Lord. I didn't have enough breath to
[2:26:30] be mad. And I said, "I'll pray for you."
[2:26:33] And I prayed for him. And a few days
[2:26:36] later,
[2:26:38] uh, Brother Josh, he come back
[2:26:42] again and come there to the back door,
[2:26:44] knocked on the door, and and I said,
[2:26:46] "Hey, aren't you the same fellow that
[2:26:48] was here?" "Yes, sir." He said, I said,
[2:26:49] "How are you feeling now?" He said,
[2:26:51] "Fine." I right away. He
[2:26:55] said, and I said, "Well, I I knew you
[2:26:59] were in pretty bad shape there when I
[2:27:01] prayed for you." He said, "I want you to
[2:27:03] know he's got he's got metal in places
[2:27:06] that God didn't put metal." I mean, I
[2:27:09] don't know what all I can't even look
[2:27:10] him right in the face hardly. And he's
[2:27:13] got uh tattoos coming up, I think, one
[2:27:16] side. I don't know what all is on there.
[2:27:19] He He looked right at me. He made
[2:27:21] perfect eye contact with me. And he
[2:27:23] said, "You may have saved my life."
[2:27:26] I I said, "Well, no. I if if your life
[2:27:29] was spared, it was the Lord." He said,
[2:27:31] "Well, thank you
[2:27:35] both." That's what he did. Thank you
[2:27:37] both. He said, "You made a difference
[2:27:39] for me. No need to
[2:27:42] think that you're needed in Africa
[2:27:47] when you can't be a light to the man
[2:27:50] that drives across your grass.
[2:27:54] Hello.
[2:27:57] You keep your promise. The flesh said
[2:27:59] you're too tired. See, now the flesh say
[2:28:03] now there's no need. You pretty little
[2:28:05] thing. Listen, you beautiful girls here.
[2:28:07] You beautiful, beautiful sisters here
[2:28:09] and all the rest of you young sisters.
[2:28:11] Now the flesh say there's no need. You
[2:28:13] pretty little thing. You're the
[2:28:14] prettiest little thing in school. Don't
[2:28:16] pay no attention to that holy roller
[2:28:18] mother of yours or that fanatic father.
[2:28:21] See, you're the best looking girl.
[2:28:23] You're the prettiest boy, the best
[2:28:24] looking boy, the best built. You're the
[2:28:27] most popular there in this city. You
[2:28:29] see, and you yield your members to that.
[2:28:34] You know when mama says go and pin that.
[2:28:42] Just because the manufacturer split it
[2:28:45] doesn't mean you have to to to embrace
[2:28:48] that style.
[2:28:51] And uh some of those things they split
[2:28:54] like that or else no one would be able
[2:28:56] to walk in
[2:28:58] them. So you need there'd be no need to
[2:29:00] come home with them. Don't even bring
[2:29:02] them home because by the time your holy
[2:29:05] roller mother says pin that up, you will
[2:29:08] be walking. I want to say you you'll be
[2:29:11] waddling like a little duck around here.
[2:29:14] You make fun mama. You old fashioned
[2:29:16] want to pin up that and pull up
[2:29:20] this. Present yourself as modest. The
[2:29:23] devil will tell you that's that mama.
[2:29:25] That's that Shelly. That's that preacher
[2:29:27] of your you. You don't have to do that.
[2:29:30] You're you're this, you're that, you're
[2:29:32] the other. You're missing out. You're
[2:29:34] losing
[2:29:36] out. There's a whole world out there.
[2:29:40] If you listen to that and yield your
[2:29:42] remembrance to that, where do you come
[2:29:44] out at? The little end of the horn. The
[2:29:47] little end of the horn.
[2:29:50] Every
[2:29:52] time there's a seducing spirit that'll
[2:29:55] never
[2:29:58] stop once the bangs go,
[2:30:03] it'll never stop. You don't have to say
[2:30:06] amen.
[2:30:12] You put on a little bit of this or that.
[2:30:14] It'll never stop.
[2:30:17] You'll fall in love with the glit
[2:30:19] glitter and the glint, the gleam. You
[2:30:22] will. Paul said, "My flesh wants always
[2:30:25] to yield to that." Your flesh does, too.
[2:30:27] But the law of the spirit of God in the
[2:30:30] heart overcomes the flesh.
[2:30:34] And makes the body obey what the heart
[2:30:37] says do. Can somebody say with brother
[2:30:40] Brandham, hallelujah? Hallelujah. Now
[2:30:42] the law of sin and death works in your
[2:30:44] flesh, but the law of the spirit of life
[2:30:46] works in your heart. So your heart, your
[2:30:48] spirit and your heart will make your
[2:30:51] body obey what it says to do. Now to the
[2:30:56] critic who had a little problem with my
[2:31:01] stick man and sumo wrestler
[2:31:06] analogy. That's what he's
[2:31:08] saying. Just different vocabulary.
[2:31:12] It works the same way. It operates the
[2:31:15] same way. Questions and answers number
[2:31:17] four now. And as long as you're in this
[2:31:19] life, you're going to be
[2:31:22] sticky. You're going to have a carnal
[2:31:24] nature that's going to bother you. It'll
[2:31:26] rise up. It'll creep up. Die
[2:31:30] daily as long as you live. But the
[2:31:32] inside of you, you're born again. And
[2:31:34] when you re when you're raised up,
[2:31:36] you're in the likeness of Christ. and
[2:31:37] all the sin has gone from you. That's
[2:31:41] the thing. So here he's telling us how
[2:31:43] to deal with that sticky, prickly,
[2:31:45] carnal nature. When it rises up, you die
[2:31:49] daily. You choose to replace that lie
[2:31:51] with the word. You say a little prayer.
[2:31:54] You cast the devil out. And you keep on
[2:31:56] walking.
[2:31:58] Now, if you've wronged somebody because
[2:31:59] of that prickly, carnal nature, you're
[2:32:01] obligated to make that right. Here's one
[2:32:03] more quote.
[2:32:06] Same sermon, paragraph 36. He said,
[2:32:09] "Somebody told
[2:32:10] me he had one time was converted,
[2:32:14] received the Holy Ghost, and he said to
[2:32:15] him, "How you getting along?" He said,
[2:32:18] "Pretty good and pretty
[2:32:21] bad." What kind of answer is that? A
[2:32:24] real one, an honest
[2:32:27] one. How are you getting along? I would
[2:32:30] rather somebody say pretty good and
[2:32:32] pretty bad than spew for an hour at how
[2:32:36] hard it is to live a Christian life. So
[2:32:38] go ahead and be honest. I'm pretty good.
[2:32:40] I'm pretty bad. He said, "Well, how do
[2:32:42] you mean pretty bad and pretty good?" He
[2:32:46] said, "Well, since me received the Holy
[2:32:48] Ghost," he's talking to an Indian chief.
[2:32:51] since me received the Holy Ghost. He
[2:32:53] said, "There's been two dogs in me and
[2:32:56] one of them a black dog and one of them
[2:32:58] a white dog." You are know you know
[2:33:00] this. You're familiar with this. He and
[2:33:03] he said they argue.
[2:33:08] Black dog, white dog argue all the time
[2:33:12] trying to get the bone, trying to get
[2:33:14] the upper hand. Right? He said they
[2:33:17] growl and fight at one another.
[2:33:20] Where did he say those two dogs were?
[2:33:23] Where did Paul say that law of sin and
[2:33:25] death was going against the law of the
[2:33:28] spirit? Right here. Right inside. They
[2:33:32] growl and fight at one another and said,
[2:33:33] "The white dog wants me to do good. The
[2:33:36] black dog wants me to do bad." Said,
[2:33:38] "Well,
[2:33:39] chief, which one of them wins the
[2:33:48] fight? Aren't you cheating? I want you
[2:33:50] to cheat. Read. I want you to read ahead
[2:33:53] of me
[2:33:54] there. Which dog is winning the fight?
[2:33:58] Well, don't blame that on God. Don't
[2:34:02] blame that on the devil. The answer
[2:34:03] doesn't belong to God. The answer
[2:34:05] doesn't belong to the devil. The answer
[2:34:06] belongs to you. He said that depends on
[2:34:08] which one chief feeds the most.
[2:34:13] So, I think that's a good answer here.
[2:34:14] See, there just depends on the waring of
[2:34:17] the body that's in you. It depends on
[2:34:18] which one
[2:34:22] you which one you cater to. Which nature
[2:34:26] you cater to? The carnal nature after
[2:34:29] the things of the world are the
[2:34:32] spiritual nature after the things of
[2:34:35] God. That does it.
[2:34:39] How many of you found out if you pet
[2:34:40] this carnal nature,
[2:34:43] it'll win every time? You don't have to
[2:34:47] do that. Can I have five minutes?
[2:34:51] Thank you. One more verse. Romans 7:24.
[2:34:56] Oh,
[2:34:58] wretched
[2:35:00] man that I
[2:35:03] am. You You ever felt
[2:35:06] miserable because of those two dogs
[2:35:10] growling in you all the time? Let me
[2:35:11] look around. See if anybody will nod
[2:35:13] their head. Have you ever had that
[2:35:14] struggle?
[2:35:17] I want to let go and let God
[2:35:22] right after I have punched
[2:35:24] you. I'm not saying you. I'm just saying
[2:35:27] that's the growl. I'm going to handle
[2:35:30] this. And then the white dog says just
[2:35:33] let go and let put your trust in the
[2:35:35] Lord. Lean not to your own
[2:35:37] understanding. In all your ways
[2:35:39] acknowledge him and he will direct your
[2:35:42] path. I'm going to I'm going to take
[2:35:45] this into my I'm going to solve this
[2:35:48] problem once and for
[2:35:51] all. You ever felt that? Oh, you felt
[2:35:54] like you want to scream out, oh,
[2:35:55] wretched,
[2:35:58] miserable, confused, bipolar
[2:36:01] [Music]
[2:36:03] man that I am. Really, the root of of
[2:36:08] the word translated as bipolar is the
[2:36:10] same word that's used for a
[2:36:12] double-minded
[2:36:16] man. They're either uh
[2:36:20] manic or totally defeated,
[2:36:25] depressed. They're either
[2:36:28] hyper
[2:36:30] or in the throws of
[2:36:33] despair. This is not God's plan.
[2:36:37] If you are chemically that way, you need
[2:36:40] some help. If you are spiritually that
[2:36:43] way, the help you need is found in the
[2:36:45] truth of God's word. But if it's a
[2:36:49] physical thing that's driving your brain
[2:36:51] to that, you need some help. And help
[2:36:54] can be
[2:36:55] available for you. Oh, wretched man that
[2:36:59] I am, who shall deliver me from the body
[2:37:01] of this death?
[2:37:04] Brother Brandham tells us an answer in
[2:37:06] gyrus and divine
[2:37:08] healing. He said many times we judge
[2:37:12] people by their
[2:37:14] actions and sometimes we don't judge the
[2:37:18] heart because sometimes we don't know
[2:37:20] the
[2:37:21] heart. We can't see the heart. We can't
[2:37:25] see the real
[2:37:27] person or seeing what they do. And
[2:37:31] sometimes we define people as what they
[2:37:36] do. And uh that's easy. That's very
[2:37:41] easy because then we can make them the
[2:37:45] problem and not us. But the reality is
[2:37:49] it's only with spirit eyes that you
[2:37:51] would be able to catch a
[2:37:53] glimpse of how
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:37:56] pure somebody's heart is.
[2:38:00] And yet you may see them uh banging
[2:38:04] their way through
[2:38:06] life. Have you ever known somebody that
[2:38:09] moves like a bull in a china closet? And
[2:38:11] so you judge them that way and you say,
[2:38:14] "Why?" They don't have any regard for
[2:38:16] anybody. They just push their way in
[2:38:19] everywhere they go. They don't even care
[2:38:21] if they've been invited into the
[2:38:22] conversation. They they just they they
[2:38:25] just come right up and just blurt right
[2:38:27] in.
[2:38:29] They must really think highly of
[2:38:32] themselves. Did you know that could be
[2:38:34] the
[2:38:35] case? It can be. I've seen it to be the
[2:38:38] case, but that's not most often the
[2:38:42] case. We are dealing with so much social
[2:38:46] dysfunction in our society today. And I
[2:38:50] promise you, you don't want to hear all
[2:38:52] the reasons why I believe that is so.
[2:38:55] But we're dealing with so much uh
[2:38:59] ADHD and
[2:39:03] autism. The scale of autism is getting
[2:39:06] higher and higher, wider and wider and
[2:39:10] wider and wider because people are
[2:39:13] becoming wired wrong and differently.
[2:39:17] Not by birth or genetic, but by
[2:39:20] environment,
[2:39:23] by lifestyle.
[2:39:29] And once you've wired
[2:39:31] yourself to have a short attention span,
[2:39:35] it's a lot. It takes a lot to break out
[2:39:39] of that. Don't you know Satan knew that
[2:39:43] when he invented scrolling?
[2:39:46] Don't you know that he knew that this
[2:39:49] would be one other way that he could
[2:39:52] keep people from from hearing the word
[2:39:55] because their attention span would be so
[2:39:58] short and even if they were trying to
[2:40:00] read their Bible on their phone, they
[2:40:03] couldn't get very far for all the
[2:40:05] notifications and the dings. And because
[2:40:08] we have rewired our brain to care,
[2:40:14] really, we shouldn't be so disturbed.
[2:40:16] Like I said last night about Elon and
[2:40:18] President Trump disagree. I don't
[2:40:21] care. I'll be honest with you. I don't
[2:40:23] mean to be disrespectful. I don't care
[2:40:25] if they wrestle on the front lawn of the
[2:40:27] White House. It has nothing to do as
[2:40:30] long as Elon will walk off and use his
[2:40:33] genius brain to do good things and
[2:40:35] President Trump will get back in that
[2:40:38] White House and make some things happen.
[2:40:40] Uh if he wants any kind of support from
[2:40:43] me other than my prayer, we better get
[2:40:46] those hostages out. what few of them are
[2:40:48] alive. I don't have time to be concerned
[2:40:51] about the politics of some Twitter war
[2:40:54] or some ex war that's going on between
[2:40:57] them. So, here I am reading the Bible
[2:41:00] and Fox News will interrupt me to tell
[2:41:03] me that Elon, did you know this? You can
[2:41:06] fix that.
[2:41:08] You can shut that down.
[2:41:13] Some of you gamers, I I don't know how
[2:41:16] you could ever get into that kind of an
[2:41:19] addiction because it's one of the most
[2:41:21] dangerous things for the chemistry of
[2:41:24] the brain. It's being proven every day.
[2:41:28] Here you are. I heard my pastor. He's
[2:41:31] going to get quiet.
[2:41:33] Oh, if you're going to get mad and go
[2:41:36] home and not eat lunch, go ahead and do
[2:41:38] it now.
[2:41:40] I'll eat yours.
[2:41:43] Brother,
[2:41:45] you're reading a scripture. Pastor said
[2:41:47] we got to read the Bible every day.
[2:41:49] Well, if you really want to help your
[2:41:51] brain, read it on a page. Yes, sir.
[2:41:54] Because any minute or two that you can
[2:41:57] take away from the blue light of this
[2:41:58] phone will help you tremendously. But
[2:42:00] let's just say, you know, I I'm you're
[2:42:03] not there yet. You commit to reading
[2:42:05] three verses, but you are not committed
[2:42:07] to reading it in an old-fashioned
[2:42:09] leatherbound Bible. You got to have it
[2:42:12] on the screen. So, you are there and
[2:42:14] you'll get a notification. Uh uh I don't
[2:42:18] even know. J, can I use your
[2:42:21] name? I'm just making it up.
[2:42:25] I've never had a notification like this,
[2:42:28] but there'll be one that'll pop up and
[2:42:30] said, "Jia is waiting for you on Words
[2:42:34] for
[2:42:36] Friends." Is that what they call it?
[2:42:39] Words for Friends. You ever played that?
[2:42:42] Yes, I did a time or two years
[2:42:45] ago, but I didn't want to be on that
[2:42:48] much
[2:42:49] because I don't care if you're waiting
[2:42:51] on me.
[2:42:56] I have a
[2:42:57] life. Somebody said, "U, I texted you
[2:43:00] the other day and you didn't answer me
[2:43:01] right back. Get used to
[2:43:04] it. I only have 24 hours in my days. I
[2:43:08] don't know about yours. I can't possibly
[2:43:12] do. I can't possibly respond every time.
[2:43:16] It's bigger than I can do." But here you
[2:43:18] are trying to read three verses of
[2:43:19] scripture and Gia is waiting on
[2:43:23] you friends of words with friends.
[2:43:27] Bubble
[2:43:29] burst Minecraft. Is that what they call
[2:43:32] this rage
[2:43:34] today? Is that what they call it? Is
[2:43:37] that mind? M I ne or mind? Which is
[2:43:42] it? M I N E Minecraft. Do they notify?
[2:43:47] Don't act like you don't know. I'll call
[2:43:50] your
[2:43:53] name. Did they
[2:43:55] notify? Praise the Lord. Praise the
[2:43:58] Lord. Praise the Lord. Uh I know you
[2:44:03] don't really know, Aaron. You're just
[2:44:04] you're just quoting from somebody else.
[2:44:06] You know, you're asking you're
[2:44:07] commenting for a friend,
[2:44:09] right? Commenting for a friend.
[2:44:18] Don't you think the enemy knows what
[2:44:20] he's doing? Did I just take up my five
[2:44:23] minutes? I'm going to need five
[2:44:27] more. You're just trying to read three
[2:44:31] verses. Here's what I love. I love when
[2:44:35] somebody I love texts me and I can't
[2:44:38] answer them right away. And uh before I
[2:44:41] can uh get back, I'm getting question
[2:44:48] marks or or this emoji.
[2:45:00] I thought sometime I'm going to tell
[2:45:02] Benjamin, would you take a picture of
[2:45:03] the closed bathroom door and send it to
[2:45:06] soand so and let them know I can't
[2:45:09] answer them right now. There's no need
[2:45:11] to knock. There's no need to question
[2:45:14] mark. It it's it's
[2:45:16] overwhelming. And I don't I don't uh
[2:45:20] think that
[2:45:22] uh I I think if I didn't have texting I
[2:45:26] I would have I'd be on the phone all all
[2:45:28] day every day all day long. So So I I
[2:45:31] can't exactly do away with that. But
[2:45:33] I've got to make up my mind.
[2:45:37] You've got to make up your mind that if
[2:45:41] you don't start feeding that white dog a
[2:45:43] little more,
[2:45:46] the war is going to tear you apart.
[2:45:51] Now watch, let's go through this and
[2:45:53] close. Many times we judge people by
[2:45:55] their actions and not their heart. You
[2:45:59] know, I've often thought back here,
[2:46:00] there here is the spirit of a man. Next
[2:46:03] is his soul. The next is his mind. And
[2:46:06] then in his fle is his flesh. Now if you
[2:46:09] took that for thus sayaeth the Lord,
[2:46:11] brother Brandham has just made you
[2:46:14] quadruple instead of
[2:46:16] tripartate. Now that's not what he's
[2:46:18] trying to preach. He's trying to explain
[2:46:21] to us those different functions and how
[2:46:24] they operate in us. But if we understand
[2:46:28] from the word, the mind and the heart
[2:46:30] are connected because it is the seat of
[2:46:34] the emotions. We're not talking about
[2:46:36] the blood pump. Is that right? So, he's
[2:46:40] not giving you this diagram. He's just
[2:46:43] showing you what is what is in there. He
[2:46:45] said the next is soul, the spirit, the
[2:46:47] soul, the mind, and then the flesh. All
[2:46:50] right? Satan does not tempt down in
[2:46:53] here. He said he tempts out here
[2:46:57] in the flesh. For instance, you go down
[2:47:00] the street tomorrow, you're walking
[2:47:01] along singing Christian songs and
[2:47:04] somebody says, you know, she or he is
[2:47:06] just a
[2:47:07] hypocrite talking about
[2:47:09] you there. There's now the first thing
[2:47:12] your flesh picks that up in the
[2:47:18] ear and suggests to the
[2:47:21] mind, you know, how dare him call me a
[2:47:24] hypocrite. Get even. I've got to get
[2:47:26] even with him. He said time it gets back
[2:47:29] here. I don't know where he's
[2:47:31] pointing. Vengeance is he says this back
[2:47:34] here says vengeance is mine saith the
[2:47:37] Lord inside. I will repay. See that's
[2:47:41] it. He said so Satan tempts out here.
[2:47:45] You see he doesn't get down in here
[2:47:48] because it's immortal. It's the flesh
[2:47:51] that he
[2:47:52] tempts. So Satan tempts out there. Now,
[2:47:54] don't forget that you've got something
[2:47:56] that connects your flesh to the inside
[2:48:00] of the inside. I call it a soul. Most
[2:48:03] believers call it a spirit. Call it
[2:48:06] whatever you want to. Just understand
[2:48:08] that it's made up of mind, will, and
[2:48:10] emotions. No doubt about that. That's
[2:48:13] very, very clear in scripture. Your
[2:48:17] flesh picks up. Your ear suggested the
[2:48:19] mind. Satan temps out here. So, Satan
[2:48:21] temps out here. You see, he doesn't get
[2:48:24] down in here. That's immortal. It's a
[2:48:27] fleshy Tims. I think I put that twice. I
[2:48:31] didn't mean to, but that's
[2:48:33] good. Young man going down the street.
[2:48:36] Young Christian boy, young lady coming
[2:48:38] immorally dressed. The eye picks it up.
[2:48:40] That's the eye gate. The flesh suggests
[2:48:44] to the mind, "Oh, she's really looking
[2:48:48] good." I'm I'm I said that. That's not
[2:48:51] the quote. Then time it gets to the
[2:48:54] mind, it goes down the soul, the soul of
[2:48:57] man is the nature of the spirit, which
[2:49:01] could actually be
[2:49:03] 100%. Not taking time to quantify that,
[2:49:07] qualify that. Now, when the soul gets
[2:49:10] there, that the spirit
[2:49:12] says, "Whoever lookth upon a woman to
[2:49:16] lust after her has committed adultery in
[2:49:18] his heart already." The young man turns
[2:49:20] his head and walks away.
[2:49:22] [Music]
[2:49:24] See, thank
[2:49:26] God. Thank God he did. Thank God I
[2:49:30] did. Thank God you
[2:49:34] did. That's down here is where it's got
[2:49:37] to be. Not out here. It's got to be down
[2:49:39] in your heart where it's got to come
[2:49:41] from where God lives. Let's stand.
[2:49:46] I'm so
[2:49:50] glad that his
[2:49:53] blood has settled this score
[2:49:56] and his word is equipping us
[2:50:01] to defeat the
[2:50:04] enemy. A precious
[2:50:08] sister shared a little piece of
[2:50:12] testimony with me.
[2:50:16] something that she had found out in her
[2:50:19] own life and that is you cannot replace
[2:50:22] a thought, a bad thought, a negative
[2:50:25] thought with another thought and find
[2:50:28] the
[2:50:29] victory. The only way to find the
[2:50:31] victory is to replace that negative
[2:50:33] thought with the word of God. That's the
[2:50:36] positive.
[2:50:38] There's got to be a verse. I preached
[2:50:40] and taught during the the series on the
[2:50:42] mind about affirmations. And when you
[2:50:45] say that, people go crazy because they
[2:50:48] uh because they think that has to be
[2:50:50] some new age kind of meditation thing.
[2:50:53] But but it's just making a positive
[2:50:55] confession over your life, which the
[2:50:57] word has taught us and the prophet has
[2:51:00] taught us. I am what God says I am. I am
[2:51:04] what the word says I am. My victory is
[2:51:08] in Christ.
[2:51:10] And you can go on and on and on. I gave
[2:51:12] you a list one time of of scriptural
[2:51:14] affirmations that you can make from the
[2:51:16] word. You can find them. You can write
[2:51:19] them down and underline them in your own
[2:51:21] Bible and use them
[2:51:24] to die daily
[2:51:27] because only dead men
[2:51:30] see the glory of God.
[2:51:33] Amen. Amen. We must all be I had a text
[2:51:36] from a dear brother this morning that
[2:51:38] said, "I'm a dead man walking."
[2:51:41] That's exactly what we are.
[2:51:44] There's a part of us that's graveyard
[2:51:46] dead and there's a part of us that's
[2:51:49] very much alive through the resurrection
[2:51:51] life of Jesus Christ. Now, let's stay on
[2:51:54] the cross. Let's stay dead. Let's use a
[2:51:58] simple prayer. Didn't I call the
[2:52:01] musicians?
[2:52:03] Did I
[2:52:06] not? Can't you all read my
[2:52:14] mind? It's a good
[2:52:19] thing. What about the first 10 minutes
[2:52:21] of my message? You wouldn't wanted to
[2:52:23] read my
[2:52:28] mind. Let's watch him walk.
[2:52:38] There goes the boy who knows so much
[2:52:40] about Minecraft.
[2:52:46] What if I were to ask you to stand up
[2:52:48] here with a microphone and recite for me
[2:52:50] the books of the
[2:52:52] Bible in
[2:52:54] order or do what my school my Bible
[2:52:57] school teacher went to a Bible school
[2:52:59] class and they asked me if I could
[2:53:02] recite the books of the Old Testament
[2:53:06] backwards. I said,
[2:53:08] "No, don't believe I can. I've been
[2:53:12] following the Lord for years and I still
[2:53:14] have a thumb index in my Bible sometime
[2:53:16] because I have to I guess if I had so
[2:53:19] many sticky notes maybe I could put that
[2:53:21] on there
[2:53:25] too. You ought to know the books of the
[2:53:27] Bible.
[2:53:31] We should make sure in our
[2:53:34] homeschool that we teach our children
[2:53:37] the books of the Bible because they need
[2:53:39] to know where to get a hold of what they
[2:53:41] need to get a hold of.
[2:53:47] Had a daddy say to me not too long ago,
[2:53:50] I my kid has a phone, so I've never
[2:53:52] bought them a Bible. I said, shame on
[2:53:55] you,
[2:53:56] brother. They need a Bible because one
[2:53:59] day they may not have that phone or they
[2:54:00] may have it and it may be no good. They
[2:54:04] need a Bible. They need to be able to
[2:54:06] find the answer to life's
[2:54:10] questions. There is so much cyber war
[2:54:14] and so much uh ability now with
[2:54:17] artificial intelligence etc.
[2:54:21] Did you hear in the news that they
[2:54:23] caught this
[2:54:24] couple, Asian couple with a
[2:54:28] uh bacterial variant that they were
[2:54:32] bringing from the
[2:54:34] east to contaminate our
[2:54:41] wheat? You hear that in the news?
[2:54:46] Do you realize that uh there are enemies
[2:54:50] plotting against this nation and
[2:54:54] against
[2:55:00] Hello. We should probably encourage our
[2:55:03] children to eat those things they don't
[2:55:06] like in case they can't always get what
[2:55:10] they like.
[2:55:13] I don't know how it will be, but I know
[2:55:17] this. There's only one way out, and
[2:55:19] that's through the
[2:55:25] word. I made somebody pretty
[2:55:30] mad because I said this to them.
[2:55:36] I said, 'Well, I guess all of us could
[2:55:39] do a better
[2:55:41] job at teaching our children the
[2:55:43] importance of the message that God has
[2:55:45] given us through a
[2:55:49] prophet. Because if somebody hears this
[2:55:53] truth and uh and thinks that they can
[2:55:56] just
[2:55:57] uh go and be
[2:55:59] Baptist or go and be
[2:56:02] Methodist or go and be some other
[2:56:05] denominational form or fashion, they
[2:56:08] didn't get somehow a revelation of the
[2:56:11] importance of this truth that God has
[2:56:14] sent to us. You can say amen or o me.
[2:56:18] It is the
[2:56:20] truth. The greatest fear that I had in
[2:56:23] those years that I was uh speaking among
[2:56:26] the charismatics was that my children
[2:56:30] would lose their appreciation of the
[2:56:34] message of the hour and find their
[2:56:36] spouses in that
[2:56:39] mess. And so far by the grace of
[2:56:42] God only by his grace that has not been
[2:56:46] the case.
[2:56:49] We have got to help our our
[2:56:54] kids. The the cream of the
[2:56:57] crop. As I stood among those young
[2:56:59] sisters last night praying with them and
[2:57:02] over them and and you other prayer
[2:57:05] warriors who come to pray, I realize
[2:57:07] that they are so
[2:57:11] valuable and they matter so
[2:57:15] much. You do too, Aaron. Even though I
[2:57:17] picked on
[2:57:19] you and you do too,
[2:57:22] Carter
[2:57:23] Jubel, you matter so much because you
[2:57:27] represent the future. If Jesus
[2:57:31] carries and if the message of the hour
[2:57:35] matters little to
[2:57:37] us, it won't matter much at all to them.
[2:57:43] So while we are not called to venerate
[2:57:45] and
[2:57:46] vindicate a man, we are called to defend
[2:57:51] the gospel and the revelation of Jesus
[2:57:53] Christ and teach our families the
[2:57:56] importance of a message of separation
[2:57:59] that says come out of her
[2:58:02] and be separate sayith the
[2:58:04] Lord. God give us grace to do that.
[2:58:08] Lord Jesus, thank you for your word of
[2:58:13] of life and
[2:58:15] deliverance. And we have no excuse. I I
[2:58:18] tell you, I didn't get through these
[2:58:20] verses, but there they're there so many
[2:58:22] of them that they leave us inexcusable.
[2:58:25] We we just have no excuse because you
[2:58:27] tell us almost on every page of the of
[2:58:31] the epistles, you tell us that you've
[2:58:33] made the way. The way is made for us to
[2:58:38] overcome. And then you send a prophet
[2:58:41] who talks so
[2:58:43] plain and so
[2:58:45] simple that we all can have this image
[2:58:48] of two
[2:58:51] dogs. Is this a good day or a bad day?
[2:58:53] Well, it
[2:58:54] depends on which of those dogs, those
[2:58:58] natures I'm feeding.
[2:59:01] Lord, would you give us grace to ask
[2:59:03] ourselves about the things that steal
[2:59:06] our time? Which dog am I feeding with
[2:59:10] this?
[2:59:12] Oh, it's only by the Holy Ghost that we
[2:59:17] will be able to
[2:59:18] discern and have strength to make a
[2:59:21] better choice.
[2:59:28] Lord, may we stop identifying ourselves
[2:59:31] by our sin. And may we stop identifying
[2:59:34] ourselves by our disease. Yes.
[2:59:39] I'm a this, I'm a that, I'm a the
[2:59:41] other. And may we start identifying
[2:59:44] ourselves with the precious word of God
[2:59:47] that tells us, let the weak
[2:59:52] say. I hear people say, "I'm so poor, I
[2:59:55] couldn't rub two nickels together." And
[2:59:57] the word said, "Let the poor say, I am
[3:00:00] rich, and that is because of you, Lord."
[3:00:04] Every good and perfect gift comes from
[3:00:06] you. The bank account may not register
[3:00:08] that we're rich, but as the old song
[3:00:11] said, we're rich in faith and hope and
[3:00:13] love. We've got more than our share.
[3:00:15] It's because of
[3:00:17] you that we have what we have. Breathe
[3:00:20] on us in this hour. Give us grace to
[3:00:23] worship you with everything that we
[3:00:26] have. Bless our fellowship, Lord,
[3:00:31] today. May somebody get a hold of a
[3:00:34] promise that they can use to defeat the
[3:00:38] enemy. We'll give you praise. Jesus,
[3:00:41] you're worthy. You're worthy. You're
[3:00:42] worthy. You're worthy.
[3:00:48] Jesus. What a song. Than
[3:00:52] silver or
[3:00:55] gold. I'd

[3:01:07] I'd

[3:01:18] I'd
[3:01:20] rather be
[3:01:22] led by his
[3:01:25] nail pierced
[3:01:28] hands than to

[3:02:22] applause. Oh, I'd
[3:02:25] rather be
[3:02:28] faithful to
[3:02:30] his dear cause. Yes. Oh, I'd
[3:02:36] rather have
[3:02:39] Jesus than
[3:02:42] worldwide
[3:02:43] fame. Oh, I'd
[3:02:46] rather be
[3:02:49] true to his
[3:02:52] holy
[3:02:54] name than to
[3:02:57] be a king. Anybody else want to come?

[3:05:54] all. To him I
[3:05:59] freely give.
[3:06:03] I will
[3:06:05] ever love and I'll trust him
[3:06:11] in his
[3:06:14] presence.
[3:06:16] Daily
[3:06:17] live. Oh,
[3:06:20] I
[3:06:22] surrender all.
[3:06:27] Oh,
[3:06:28] I
[3:06:30] surrender
[3:06:33] all.
[3:06:34] [Music]
[3:06:36] Oh, to thee. My
[3:06:40] blessed
[3:06:42] savior
[3:06:44] I
[3:06:46] surrender all
[3:06:51] and
[3:06:52] all to
[3:06:54] Jesus high.
[3:06:58] Surrender
[3:07:00] humbly at his feet
[3:07:06] I
[3:07:08] worldly
[3:07:10] pleasures
[3:07:11] all
[3:07:13] forsake and take me
[3:07:18] Jesus take me now.
[3:07:22] Oh,
[3:07:23] I
[3:07:25] surrender
[3:07:29] all. Oh,
[3:07:31] I
[3:07:33] surrender
[3:07:36] all.
[3:07:38] Oh, to thee my
[3:07:43] blessed
[3:07:45] Savior
[3:07:46] I
[3:07:48] surrender all.
[3:07:55] to Jesus.
[3:07:59] [Music]
[3:08:01] Make me save your
[3:08:05] holy
[3:08:07] night. And let me feel the
[3:08:13] holy
[3:08:15] spirit
[3:08:17] truely know that thou art mine. Oh,
[3:08:24] I
[3:08:26] surrender all.
[3:08:30] Oh,
[3:08:32] I
[3:08:34] surrender all.
[3:08:39] All to thee, my
[3:08:43] blessed
[3:08:45] Savior,
[3:08:47] I
[3:08:49] surrender
[3:08:51] all.
[3:08:52] Oh, and
[3:08:55] I
[3:08:57] surrender all.
[3:08:59] Make that your prayer. Oh,
[3:09:02] I
[3:09:04] surrender all all to you, Lord. Oh,
[3:09:09] all to thee, my
[3:09:14] blessed
[3:09:15] Savior.
[3:09:17] I
[3:09:19] surrender all. Only you know what you
[3:09:22] need to surrender to him. But in an
[3:09:25] atmosphere like
[3:09:28] this, it helps so
[3:09:31] much to make that commitment.
[3:09:36] You identify what part of your will
[3:09:41] needs to
[3:09:42] bow and say, "By your grace, Lord,
[3:09:47] by your grace, I'm going to choose your
[3:09:50] will and reject mine." Would you do that
[3:09:53] right now? Here we are,
[3:09:56] Lord. The same for one is not the same
[3:09:59] for all. But the need for us all to
[3:10:03] surrender our will is the same. There
[3:10:06] are certain parts of who we are that we
[3:10:10] may hold on to and it may not be what
[3:10:13] the neighbor standing around the altar
[3:10:16] with us would need to. But Lord, without
[3:10:19] your grace, it doesn't matter how big or
[3:10:21] how small, we would never be able to
[3:10:25] choose your will over ours. Would you
[3:10:28] cover us right now like a
[3:10:30] blanket? Several times I could feel the
[3:10:33] Holy Spirit drawing near to surround us.
[3:10:36] Would you surround us,
[3:10:38] Lord? May you find a a place to to
[3:10:43] light, to lodge, to
[3:10:45] remain. And would you give us the grace
[3:10:48] that we need? Oh Lord, the mind battle
[3:10:52] has wearied some and has watered down
[3:10:56] their faith. But we believe today that
[3:11:00] your word feeds our faith. And we pray
[3:11:04] that faith will arise in this house to
[3:11:08] take you at your promises.
[3:11:13] Father, may we find that strength we
[3:11:16] need to confess your word in every
[3:11:21] situation because you have identified
[3:11:24] yourself as the high priest of our
[3:11:29] confession. A prophet told us that it's
[3:11:31] what we confess that you bear toward the
[3:11:35] throne. Oh God, I better be careful what
[3:11:38] comes out of my mouth. I should be
[3:11:40] careful what my confession is. So we
[3:11:44] surrender, Lord, today. Would you help
[3:11:47] us to go out of here today with a fresh
[3:11:52] determination to starve the dog that
[3:11:55] causes us the trouble
[3:11:58] and to let your
[3:12:01] righteousness
[3:12:02] [Music]
[3:12:04] triumph? when we get tired of waiting,
[3:12:07] would you come and comfort us? Because
[3:12:10] you said, Lord, that if we would not be
[3:12:13] weary in
[3:12:15] welloing, we would
[3:12:17] reap, we would receive a harvest in due
[3:12:22] season, in the right season, in the
[3:12:24] right moment.
[3:12:26] Father, forgive us for trying to rush
[3:12:29] you out of your divine season and and
[3:12:34] and choose our timing instead of
[3:12:37] yours. Fill us with love for one
[3:12:42] another. And may there be something in
[3:12:45] us that wants to see each other succeed
[3:12:47] in the faith.
[3:12:50] And may we do more than just root and
[3:12:52] cheer for one another. May we be willing
[3:12:55] to to pick up a brother, to pick up a
[3:12:59] sister, to hold up their weary hands, to
[3:13:02] strengthen their feeble
[3:13:04] knees, and to encourage them not only
[3:13:07] with words but by example.
[3:13:12] Lord Jesus, may we make you our number
[3:13:14] one priority in all things. For you said
[3:13:18] it was your desire to have preeminence
[3:13:20] in all things. Amen. and we will give
[3:13:23] you glory, honor, and praise for it's in
[3:13:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[3:13:28] pray. And the saints said, "Amen." Amen.
[3:13:31] Benjamin, I want you to sing one more
[3:13:34] song. We're leaving in a minute, but I
[3:13:37] want you to sing one more song while
[3:13:38] we're around the altar. I'm a child of
[3:13:40] the King. I want us to sing that as an
[3:13:43] anthem as we get ready to go. And I want
[3:13:46] to show you just a very very very short
[3:13:49] clip uh before you actually leave the
[3:13:51] the building today. So let's sing this
[3:13:54] with him. Are you are there any children
[3:13:57] of the king here?
[3:13:59] What a
[3:14:00] question. I don't see anybody that's
[3:14:05] not. I see a lot of children of the
[3:14:08] king.
[3:14:09] Well, I'm not a child. Well, I am. And I
[3:14:13] I see it a
[3:14:16] lot. We have to be like little children
[3:14:20] when we come to him. We can't uh hobble.
[3:14:24] We can't stomp in, you know, with
[3:14:25] hobnail shoes where angels fear to trod.
[3:14:29] We just come softly and humbly like a
[3:14:31] child. I want you to love one another as
[3:14:34] you sing this. I want you to consider
[3:14:36] that the person that you're shaking
[3:14:38] their hand or hugging their neck. I want
[3:14:40] you to consider I I am uh uh greeting
[3:14:45] another child of the
[3:14:49] king. May I see the value in that and
[3:14:53] pray for them beyond the service but
[3:14:56] carry them in my heart. Sing it. Once
[3:15:00] I was clothed in the
[3:15:05] ranks of my sin,
[3:15:09] I was
[3:15:10] wretched and poor. I was lost and
[3:15:16] lonely
[3:15:17] within. heart with
[3:15:21] wonderous
[3:15:23] compassion, the king of all
[3:15:27] kings in
[3:15:30] pity and love. He took me
[3:15:35] under his wings. Oh yes. And oh yes.
[3:15:41] Oh yes.
[3:15:44] I'm a
[3:15:45] child of the king. His ro you see his
[3:15:51] royal
[3:15:53] blood. It now flows through my
[3:15:58] veins. And
[3:16:00] I who was
[3:16:03] rich and
[3:16:05] born now can
[3:16:08] save. Praise
[3:16:10] God. Praise God.
[3:16:14] I'm a child
[3:16:16] of the
[3:16:18] king. Oh,
[3:16:20] now I'm a
[3:16:23] child with a
[3:16:26] heavenly home. You see my
[3:16:31] holy
[3:16:32] father. He has made
[3:16:35] me his own and I'm cleansed. Oh, by his
[3:16:42] blood can I
[3:16:44] glow in his love. You know,
[3:16:49] someday I'll sing with all the
[3:16:54] angels above and Oh
[3:16:59] yes. Oh
[3:17:01] yes. I'm a
[3:17:03] child of the king.
[3:17:07] Oh, his
[3:17:09] royal
[3:17:11] blood it now flows through my veins. And
[3:17:18] I who was
[3:17:21] rich and poor and now can sing. Oh,
[3:17:26] praise
[3:17:27] God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[3:17:32] Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise
[3:17:37] God. Praise
[3:17:40] God. I'm a child of the King. Sing it
[3:17:45] one more time. Oh yes.
[3:17:48] Oh yes. I'm a child. I'm a
[3:17:52] child of the King. His royal.
[3:17:57] His royal blood now. It now flows
[3:18:03] through my
[3:18:05] veins. And I who was
[3:18:10] rich and
[3:18:12] poor, now can save. Praise God. Oh,
[3:18:16] praise
[3:18:17] God. Praise God. Oh, praise
[3:18:23] God. Praise God.
[3:18:26] I'm a child of the king. You believe
[3:18:32] that? Give him a praise.
[3:18:39] Why don't we get you musicians to go
[3:18:41] down too so that you can get a good uh
[3:18:45] glimpse of this uh little video that's
[3:18:47] going to be released on social
[3:18:51] media.

[3:19:15] meeting October

[3:19:24] won't tell you. I'll I'll let the video
[3:19:26] tell you. But any questions about the
[3:19:29] dates of the next fellowship meeting or
[3:19:31] the camp
[3:19:32] meeting? I will tell you that we have
[3:19:35] already had a quite a host of people
[3:19:38] telling us that it is their deep desire
[3:19:41] to be with us this year at camp meeting.
[3:19:45] So, if you have any pools or need uh a
[3:19:50] place to stay, you better try to get
[3:19:52] your reservations in pretty early uh
[3:19:55] locally in the body. And uh we will try
[3:19:58] to make sure that we have gotten the
[3:20:01] best rate that we can get for hotels
[3:20:04] because we are expecting this year uh to
[3:20:08] be a bigger year than than last year.
[3:20:12] And uh it delights
[3:20:13] us. Feels a little tiring right this
[3:20:16] minute, but we're going to we're going
[3:20:18] to have a real great time in the Lord.
[3:20:23] I'm looking forward to it. I must be the
[3:20:26] only one,
[3:20:28] but I I'll look forward to it enough for
[3:20:30] for all of us. If you'll just dim the
[3:20:33] lights, it'll only take a few seconds
[3:20:35] and then we will rush home. Emphasis on
[3:20:38] rush, but safely. Get our food and come
[3:20:42] back. We need to be mindful of those who
[3:20:44] have a long way to travel. So, you don't
[3:20:47] have time to go home and shine your
[3:20:49] shoes to come back. You got to get over
[3:20:52] here with your with your food. And then
[3:20:54] the saints said,
[3:20:58] [Music]
[3:21:07] [Music]
[3:21:13] "Amen."
[3:21:17] Hallelujah. Praise the one who set me
[3:21:21] free. Hallelujah.
[3:21:25] Death has lost its grip on me and you
[3:21:29] have broken every chain. There's
[3:21:33] salvation in your name. Jesus Christ,
[3:21:37] you're my
[3:21:39] living
[3:21:42] hope.
[3:21:45] Yeah. Hallelujah.
[3:21:49] We praise the one who set free.
[3:21:53] Hallelujah.
[3:21:56] [Music]
[3:22:16] [Applause]
[3:22:22] That excites me. See all those happy
[3:22:26] people worshiping the Lord. Let's stand.
[3:22:28] Last time, the Lord go with you and keep
[3:22:32] you and bless you. May his countenance
[3:22:35] shine upon you. And may God grant you
[3:22:38] that great shalom, that great peace that
[3:22:41] only comes from him. Amen. Amen. You're
[3:22:43] dismissed to go now in the name of the
[3:22:45] Lord. God bless you as you leave tonight
[3:22:49] or today or nearly
[3:22:53] tonight. Meet us at the bottom of the
[3:22:56] hill.

[3:23:49] so he's so
[3:23:54] good
[3:23:56] to
