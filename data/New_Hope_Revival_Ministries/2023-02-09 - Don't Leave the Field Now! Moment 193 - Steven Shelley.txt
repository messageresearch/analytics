Description:
The enemy is strategic in knowing exactly when to strike. The Philistines would wait until the Israelites had plowed the fields, planted seed, cultivated, watered and fertilized the ground.  Then just in time for harvest they would burst forth and cause them to flee.  Without putting forth any effort they would steal the harvest. 

You have prayed and planted seeds for your loved ones, your children, your family, your friends. Do not abandon your harvest now. In your planting and waiting, guard and water the seeds.  Attain God’s favor by praising and worshiping Him.    

Be careful of your thoughts and words.  We are now coming down to an hour where we can’t afford to lose another field of harvest.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can't plant a seed and because it hasn't come up when you think it ought to come up you can't just abandon your seed I want you to know the enemy is strategic he knows exactly when to strike because the Bible tells us that year after year Harvest after harvest the Israelites would plow the field plant the seed cultivate the growth hold the weeds water the plants fertilize with fish heads and whatever else they did in that time so just about the time bushes are big the blooms have passed the shells are hanging the Lagoon shells are hanging on and it's just about time for Harvest why why don't they come when the ground needs to be tended because the enemy is his children want something for free they don't know what good sweat can accomplish the enemy will come in and try to steal your Harvest without putting any effort into what's going on he'll wait until it's just about ready to verse fourth and the Bible tells us that year after year when the lentils were ready the Philistines would come up over the hill screaming like a bunch of wild Indians scare the Israelites run off in the bushes and rocks and hide would come in with their baskets if you're a Believer you need to understand there's a turf war going on Satan wants to steal the bride's territory her jurisdiction and Dominion he wants to user from her authority to Sidetrack the bride from her destiny Satan wants to cut the bride off from her source he wants you to spiritually Wither in the field that's why he's after the pastors he desires to weaken you so that he can simply walk off with your inheritance [Music] when you think it ought to come up you can't just abandon your scene somebody's got to have faith and say I planted it in faith and I'm gonna guard it insane and one day I'm gonna repeat [Music] not in my timing [Music] but in the Lord's time so wait reap you've sowed prayed waited nothing comes in fact for some of you it seems like a harvest is long overdue sometimes we get tired of waiting but I am here to tell you today whatever you do do not abandon your seed do not abandon your seat you can speed up a harvest depends on what you do while you're waiting on your Harvest you if you're grumbling and complaining if you're reciting all the things you don't understand forgetting all the things you do understand am I with me everybody has doubt everybody has to deal with that from time to time but don't you get caught up in that vicious cycle whatever you do be careful about your thoughts watch the words that come out of your mouth you've got a lot at stake you've planted many fields with seed you have prayed and planted seed for your family you prayed and planted seed for your co-workers who prayed and planted seed for your children in the field now I I don't even mean a geographical location I'm in a state of faith a field where you have put something in the ground believing that God is going to give you the abundance of what you're playing the multiplication of the seed if you want the favor of the Lord to fall on you in your waiting season you spend that time let the people praise the old God let all the people praise thee then shall the Earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us how many of you are ready to plant your seed and guard them water them with praise stay on top of the thing until the Harvest comes I cannot tell you the fields that we have abandoned through the years I cannot tell you the harvests that we have lost in our lives because we got tired of defending the field we're coming down to an hour now or we can't afford to lose another field of harvest
