[5:43] foreign
[6:12] longer tethered to planet earth
[6:16] with all of its suffering and all of its
[6:19] darkness we have been raised up
[6:22] into heavenly places to sit with christ
[6:26] jesus through
[6:28] his precious
[6:29] revealed word
[6:31] i want to greet all of you in the lovely
[6:35] name of the lord jesus christ
[6:37] my only regret is that we cannot be with
[6:41] you there
[6:43] dancing worshiping the king of kings and
[6:47] the lord of lords
[6:49] i was able to catch just a few seconds
[6:52] of your worship a few moments ago and my
[6:55] heart
[6:56] was longing to be with you
[6:59] and to celebrate the goodness of god
[7:03] but circumstances
[7:05] have separated us
[7:07] at a time like this
[7:09] but i want you to know
[7:11] that the bride of jesus christ is
[7:15] marching on
[7:17] no matter what the enemy throws at us
[7:20] and because of precious brothers in
[7:24] ghana and precious brothers in alabama
[7:28] they have worked together
[7:30] and they have made this possible that i
[7:34] could have
[7:35] excuse me
[7:37] that i could have a small part in your
[7:40] convention
[7:41] and given the honor of speaking tonight
[7:46] getting things going
[7:48] i greet our
[7:49] esteemed pastor tay
[7:52] a true friend to me for so many years
[7:56] now
[7:57] and an apostle of this truth
[8:01] he has certainly pioneered
[8:04] so many wonderful wonderful things for
[8:08] the kingdom of god
[8:09] in the nation of ghana and has blessed
[8:12] the saints around the world
[8:15] as he has traveled even here to alabama
[8:18] he has been a blessing to so many so i
[8:22] say
[8:23] sir i salute you today in the name of
[8:26] the lord and would love to be there with
[8:29] you
[8:30] i greet your beautiful family in the
[8:33] name of the lord jesus christ
[8:35] we greet also
[8:37] the anointed speakers who will be
[8:40] ministering to you from your location in
[8:44] the next couple of days
[8:47] it's a blessing that you have again this
[8:49] time
[8:50] off work and you can gather together i
[8:54] pray sincerely that if jesus tarries he
[8:57] makes a way for me to come and be with
[9:00] you again
[9:02] i love pulling on to the church premises
[9:05] after not being there for some time
[9:09] i enjoy pulling onto those premises
[9:12] those blessed grounds
[9:15] and seeing
[9:16] the great progress that is made
[9:19] every time we come we see the goodness
[9:23] of god manifested
[9:25] with expansion
[9:27] and with his blessing
[9:29] and it just really thrills us
[9:33] we look around and we see so many things
[9:37] changing in the world around us
[9:40] and most of those things have brought a
[9:43] lot of sorrow and a lot of heartache to
[9:45] many families around the world
[9:48] but we want to say
[9:50] as believers
[9:52] that we trust the sovereign hands of god
[9:56] we know that he never fails
[9:58] and he never makes a mistake and so we
[10:02] just say together in all of the
[10:05] transitions that we have gone through in
[10:07] the last couple of years we just say
[10:09] together god is good say that with me
[10:13] god is
[10:15] good he is faithful and above all
[10:20] he is good he
[10:21] never fails
[10:24] well we have had wonderful blessings
[10:26] from the lord here
[10:28] in alabama over the last couple of years
[10:32] he has been faithful
[10:33] he is working and building up his bride
[10:37] we're seeing god's provision and his
[10:40] help for us
[10:41] both spiritually and physically
[10:44] my wife and i
[10:46] had the covet virus
[10:49] and we saw the hand of god move in just
[10:53] an amazing way and with many in our
[10:55] congregation who experienced it god was
[10:59] faithful and he brought them out and
[11:02] they are living testimonies
[11:05] of god's goodness and also his
[11:07] sovereignty we don't always know why
[11:10] things happen the way they do but we
[11:13] know that we are in great big capable
[11:15] hands
[11:17] in the midst of
[11:18] all the negative things that we see and
[11:21] hear in the news i have some good news
[11:24] that i want to share with you today
[11:26] you rejoiced with me
[11:29] there at bible believers fellowship
[11:31] when god gave me a wonderful wife
[11:35] uh it was announced to you and
[11:39] you shouted and praised god with me for
[11:43] his gift
[11:44] and you have done that through many
[11:46] milestones in my life
[11:49] and i think the next one was about nine
[11:52] months later when god gave us our first
[11:56] son benjamin judah who you have met
[11:59] he has been with me along with joshua
[12:02] our next son
[12:04] uh benjamin has played the drums and
[12:07] they're in the sanctuary of bible
[12:10] believers fellowship and if you haven't
[12:13] heard already
[12:14] it's our great joy to
[12:17] share with you the good news that uh
[12:20] over the course of the last few days he
[12:22] has asked
[12:25] the beautiful genocider to be his wife
[12:29] and she has accepted and so now they are
[12:32] engaged to be married sometime next year
[12:36] god willing i wanted to share that news
[12:39] with you because you i'm choking up
[12:41] again
[12:42] because you are a part of my family and
[12:45] you have prayed for me and been such a
[12:48] blessing in my life i want to bless you
[12:51] today i want to share with you some
[12:54] things that god has laid on my heart i
[12:57] want to say to
[12:59] pastor isaac and to the other speakers
[13:02] pastor john and whoever else might have
[13:05] the blessing of ministering to you i'm
[13:08] depending on you brothers to uh really
[13:12] emphasize
[13:14] the theme of this meeting and take it as
[13:17] high as you possibly can i'm here to
[13:20] introduce it a bit and to
[13:23] help break open the door but i'm praying
[13:26] for you men of god that you will be used
[13:29] in outstanding ways over the course of
[13:32] the next couple of days
[13:34] that there will be miracles among you
[13:37] deliverances among you healings and
[13:41] salvations and
[13:43] whatever god has
[13:44] but i also pray that the bride will be
[13:47] strengthened there to rise up in this
[13:50] last day
[13:51] for we need to get above
[13:54] this old stuff that we live in in this
[13:57] old past house of the flesh
[14:00] previously called to all of us satan's
[14:03] eden
[14:04] we're not bound to this earth we're not
[14:07] tethered to the things of this earth
[14:09] we've been called to a higher place
[14:12] and i believe those brothers are going
[14:14] to be mightily used of god
[14:16] i'm going to speak briefly about
[14:19] the theme of the camp and then i want to
[14:22] i want to move into something that i i
[14:25] have to bring to you today because the
[14:28] lord has placed it so heavily on my
[14:31] heart in prayer
[14:33] and i believe it will be a blessing and
[14:35] i believe that it will help you
[14:37] to to get up above because that's what a
[14:40] spiritual astronaut must do he's got to
[14:43] get up above all the other things
[14:47] that the enemy would use to try to keep
[14:50] us tied to this earth
[14:52] and
[14:53] in order to sort of open that up i want
[14:56] to just give you two quotations there
[15:00] are many from the message of the prophet
[15:03] but there are two that i want to use uh
[15:07] as a plow
[15:09] to sort of break open the ground and and
[15:12] show you what god has placed in my heart
[15:15] for you
[15:16] we are overcomers by the blood of the
[15:19] lamb by the word of our testimony and
[15:23] all of hell is marching against this
[15:26] little bride and yet there is victory
[15:29] that is rising up in our hearts because
[15:32] we know that god's word is being
[15:36] fulfilled in this very hour
[15:39] we also know that there are greater
[15:42] glories and greater fulfillments of this
[15:45] word just around the corner
[15:48] and so we must not give up
[15:51] i said we must not give up
[15:56] we must stay the course
[15:59] we must stay with the word of god with
[16:02] the word of the hour
[16:04] we must trust the lord to continue
[16:08] to reveal himself to us through his word
[16:13] and not be discouraged
[16:16] the enemy
[16:17] is using every trick in his bag to
[16:21] discourage us
[16:23] to distract us
[16:25] to cause us to get our eyes off of the
[16:28] word but we are
[16:31] we are spiritual astronauts and we are
[16:34] determined now
[16:37] not to be a part of this world around us
[16:41] the bible tells us even the words of
[16:43] jesus himself love not the world
[16:47] neither the things of the world we are
[16:50] loving the things of the kingdom which
[16:53] is another world and another dimension
[16:55] altogether the only way that we are
[16:58] going to spend eternity together in that
[17:00] kingdom
[17:01] is to
[17:03] let the word of god take us to higher
[17:06] heights
[17:07] let the word of god lift us up
[17:11] under the great inspiration of the holy
[17:14] ghost and strengthen us
[17:16] physically emotionally
[17:19] uh spiritually mentally in every way we
[17:24] are a tripartite
[17:26] man we are a tripartite human being we
[17:29] are spirit soul and body
[17:32] and we need to be ministered to and
[17:34] lifted up in all phases of who we are
[17:37] and there is nothing like the revealed
[17:40] word of the hour to feed all of that to
[17:43] nourish that and to cause us to see
[17:46] things from a different perspective in
[17:49] the message countdown the one that
[17:52] brother branham gave us in
[17:53] jeffersonville which was 62 paragraph 96
[17:58] and any man that ever lives for god will
[18:02] have to go beyond any five senses
[18:07] i just love that word because we know
[18:10] the enemy
[18:12] will use whatever he can get his hands
[18:14] on even the gifts that god has given us
[18:17] and our five senses are a gift from god
[18:20] they help us to have contact with the
[18:24] world around us
[18:25] and god wants us to be able to
[18:28] see and discern the beauty that he has
[18:31] created and there are things that we
[18:33] need to hear
[18:34] and things that he's given us to taste
[18:36] and to feel
[18:38] so these senses
[18:40] in themselves they're not our enemies
[18:42] but the enemy likes to use them
[18:45] and brother branham said when they begin
[18:47] to lie against the word that's when we
[18:49] have to recognize how the enemy's using
[18:52] them and don't pay any attention to them
[18:54] but but listen rather to the word of god
[18:58] and brother branham is describing here
[19:00] in the countdown that spiritual
[19:02] astronauts must go beyond their five
[19:05] senses so i'm saying to you my brethren
[19:09] no matter what you see or what you hear
[19:12] what you feel what you taste
[19:14] no matter what your five senses might
[19:17] tell you in such an hour as this you are
[19:20] not called to live by that
[19:23] you were born of god predestinated of
[19:27] god to live by the truth of god's word
[19:31] and i've told you many times before
[19:33] we're we're not here on planet earth
[19:36] to be thermostats
[19:39] because excuse me to be a thermometer i
[19:41] knew i would pick the wrong word we are
[19:44] not here to be a thermometer a
[19:47] thermometer is what tells us the
[19:49] atmosphere around us what temperature it
[19:52] is right now and if that's all we do
[19:55] we're no different than anybody else
[19:57] that walks up and down the streets of
[19:59] tema
[20:00] but we're called to be the thermostat
[20:04] and the thermostat is
[20:06] is the device that has the ability to
[20:09] raise up the level or to lower the level
[20:13] of the temperature and that's who you
[20:15] and i are
[20:16] we carry the anointing of god for the
[20:20] end time
[20:21] yes we live below our means we don't
[20:24] always operate in that anointing but we
[20:27] carry i'm telling you in the name of the
[20:29] lord we carry the anointing to overcome
[20:34] in the end time
[20:36] and we carry an anointing to shift
[20:39] the atmosphere around us
[20:42] so may god use you
[20:44] through the last few days of 2021
[20:48] and the entirety of 2022 if jesus
[20:52] tarries may you and i be used like never
[20:55] before to make an impact
[20:58] on the atmosphere around us
[21:01] there's never been an hour church where
[21:04] the world has been so fearful this this
[21:07] perhaps has struck more fear
[21:10] in people's hearts than the world wars
[21:13] that have previously taken place in the
[21:15] earth
[21:16] this this fear has been so tangible that
[21:20] you can see it and sense it and feel it
[21:23] on people that you may meet along the
[21:26] way
[21:27] so afraid of death so afraid of disease
[21:31] not understanding that above all god is
[21:35] sovereign and in control
[21:38] fear will bring torment
[21:40] you and i who have been called to be
[21:43] those spiritual astronauts
[21:46] we are also called to be that thermostat
[21:50] that we might be able to change that
[21:53] atmosphere of fear around us by speaking
[21:57] faith by living faith by practicing what
[22:01] we preach
[22:02] by really taking god at his word the
[22:06] prophet goes on to say here any man that
[22:09] ever lives for god will have to go above
[22:12] or beyond any five senses he'll have to
[22:15] go on any education any achievement that
[22:18] he's been able to do and believe god you
[22:21] can't lean on your education you can't
[22:24] lean on the trophies of what you have
[22:26] achieved you've got to move on and
[22:29] believe god
[22:31] he said break everything and lay it
[22:34] aside and sweep up
[22:37] into heaven
[22:38] oh he said what astronauts and so forth
[22:42] have been achieving in the natural god's
[22:45] been able to do it by his church by the
[22:50] spiritual the spiritual astronauts that
[22:54] we are called to be he said by a
[22:56] spiritual people who will believe
[23:00] we are a spiritual people you say well
[23:04] that sounds a little braggy well i don't
[23:06] mean for it to but i want to say it
[23:09] again and i want you to say it with me i
[23:12] am a spiritual person
[23:15] we are a spiritual people we're not
[23:19] called to be an earthy people a worldly
[23:22] people but rather a spiritual people a
[23:26] supernatural people who are not marching
[23:30] to the drumbeat of society we are not
[23:34] marching to the rhythm of this world
[23:37] hallelujah but we have another rhythm
[23:42] altogether there is another cadence in
[23:45] the bride of christ hallelujah and we
[23:48] are marching to that drumbeat we are
[23:51] moving to that cycle that god is
[23:54] releasing upon us in this hour the
[23:57] little bride church is is not going
[24:00] under we're going over we're not going
[24:04] lower we're going higher and it's
[24:07] because the word has been sent to do
[24:10] that for us
[24:11] you say brother shelly but we're not
[24:14] even free to worship and together like
[24:17] we did and we have to social distance
[24:20] and we have to wear the mask and we have
[24:22] to do this and we're forced to do that
[24:25] and it seems like things are getting
[24:27] darker they are
[24:28] things are getting darker out there but
[24:32] in here
[24:34] where the body of christ is things are
[24:37] not getting darker oh hallelujah things
[24:40] are getting brighter
[24:42] because it's our day to shine
[24:46] it's our hour to go forward in the
[24:51] wonderful grace of jesus christ brother
[24:55] branham goes on to say by a spiritual
[24:57] people who will believe he said any man
[25:00] or woman who will dare at any time
[25:05] any time to take god at his word is an
[25:10] astronaut
[25:11] so if you and i
[25:13] dare
[25:14] god
[25:16] if we will dare to take god at his word
[25:21] we are those spiritual astronauts that
[25:25] we're celebrating here in this
[25:28] convention we're no longer in the horse
[25:30] and buggy age we're no longer in the
[25:33] automobile age spiritually we're no
[25:36] longer just in the airplane age
[25:38] spiritually but we've been called to
[25:42] move by a force that is higher than than
[25:46] us
[25:47] brother branham says that in one of the
[25:49] countdown messages he said those
[25:51] astronauts they don't move by their own
[25:54] power at their own will he said oh no
[25:57] they're shot out of a tube
[26:00] he said it's it's a power behind them
[26:02] that shoots them out of here and we can
[26:05] say that we can say that we're not
[26:07] moving in the last hours of 2021 by our
[26:12] own strength brother sister if we're
[26:14] gathered together this way in the name
[26:17] of the lord it's by his grace it's by
[26:19] his power it's by his leadership we're
[26:23] we could be uh we could be in in a
[26:26] position much different than the one
[26:29] we're in right now
[26:31] i realize that many of you around uh
[26:34] ghana and around the nations of africa
[26:36] and around the world who will be
[26:38] watching this service today um i realize
[26:42] that your situations and circumstances
[26:45] are different and mine are different
[26:47] than yours but we're all facing some
[26:50] things in a way that we have never faced
[26:53] them before and if we get bogged down
[26:57] with what's going on around us
[26:59] we'll be we won't be astronauts
[27:02] oh no
[27:03] we we will be uh depressed and broken
[27:07] people and we will be a people failing
[27:11] to manifest the purpose for which we
[27:14] have been born and we're not going to do
[27:16] that we're going to get up we're going
[27:18] to rise up by the power of the holy
[27:21] spirit now one more little quotation and
[27:24] i'm moving on
[27:26] it's from the countdown this is the one
[27:28] he gave in shreveport louisiana uh in 62
[27:32] and thanksgiving time for us here in
[27:35] america
[27:36] in paragraph 76 he said the spiritual
[27:40] astronaut is eagles
[27:43] how many eagles are gathered together
[27:46] today
[27:47] i don't know where you are but god knows
[27:50] where you are
[27:51] how many eagles are out there how many
[27:54] eagles are gathered at bible believers
[27:56] fellowship sanctuary and tema ghana west
[28:00] africa wherever you're watching this
[28:03] i want you to know that god has called
[28:05] us to be those eagles brother branham
[28:08] said that's who the spiritual astronaut
[28:10] is he's an eagle he goes beyond all
[28:14] denominational creeds
[28:16] he goes beyond all denominational
[28:18] barriers
[28:20] all denominational thinkings
[28:23] all their cloudy thoughts
[28:25] do you really want to be involved after
[28:27] all these years with all the cloudy
[28:30] thoughts of denominationalism i tell you
[28:33] absolutely not
[28:34] to leave this pure word of the hour and
[28:38] to go back into that denominational way
[28:40] of thinking i'm telling you it seems to
[28:43] me like the grossest blasphemy that
[28:46] could be imagined it's exactly what the
[28:48] enemy would like to anoint some of us to
[28:51] do
[28:52] he would like to catch us in our
[28:53] weakness
[28:54] he would like to cause us to feel like
[28:56] we don't belong and we don't fit in and
[28:59] we're not a part of what is going on in
[29:01] the bride church
[29:03] and he would cause us to retreat back
[29:05] into something that god has already
[29:07] delivered us from but we say no to the
[29:11] enemy our eyes are not on the church our
[29:14] eyes are not even on our leadership our
[29:17] pastors our eyes are fixed on the lord
[29:21] jesus christ he is the captain of the
[29:25] host he is the chief astronaut he is
[29:28] above us all brother branham tells us
[29:31] that even christ was an astronaut and he
[29:34] rose above and you and i will do the
[29:37] same by his grace he said he goes beyond
[29:41] all their cloudy thoughts he goes above
[29:44] every cloud
[29:45] everything there is to look at he's up
[29:48] around the stars the astronaut and the
[29:51] astronaut believer is also up in the
[29:54] heavenlies he's far beyond these earth
[29:58] bound things that's what i want to say
[30:01] to you today my family i want to say to
[30:05] you
[30:06] that we are delivered from these
[30:09] earthbound things he has come with his
[30:13] word to cut us loose to sever the ties
[30:19] that would bind us to the carnality
[30:22] and the flesh of this earth and to cause
[30:26] us to grow up into the spiritual beings
[30:30] that he has called us to be
[30:32] we have been given power over all
[30:36] the power of the enemy and we must take
[30:39] that power and we must utilize that
[30:42] authority in this hour and we refuse to
[30:46] be defeated take that satan
[30:48] we refuse
[30:50] to be defeated in fact we refuse to be
[30:53] influenced by those earth-bound things
[30:56] around us
[30:58] we are soaring hallelujah higher
[31:01] we're soaring higher above it all by the
[31:05] inspiration of the holy ghost that falls
[31:09] on this word i want you to know
[31:12] sometimes i can be right by myself
[31:15] reading this great message that god's
[31:18] given us or listening to it on my phone
[31:20] and i can be caught up into a place
[31:23] where for a few moments of time i forget
[31:26] about everything around me problems
[31:29] bills that need to be paid pastoring a
[31:31] church of people who have needs and
[31:34] sometimes those needs get heavy
[31:36] all of these things can weigh on you but
[31:38] the word of god can catch you up into a
[31:42] higher place far beyond he said far
[31:46] beyond these earthbound things he's up
[31:49] high he's in outer space i'm quoting
[31:52] again see the earthly man doesn't know
[31:55] very much about outer space
[31:57] but if the astronauts in outer space
[32:00] he's there with it in other words he
[32:02] understands what's going on out there in
[32:05] the far regions of space because he's
[32:08] been caught up to it and when i begin to
[32:10] think about that
[32:12] think about eagles
[32:14] being astronauts we're both we're
[32:17] spiritual eagles who have become
[32:19] spiritual astronauts
[32:21] and i began to see about that that
[32:24] anointing that was to be present on the
[32:27] bride in the last days
[32:29] there were four creatures that stood
[32:31] before the throne of god and we
[32:33] understand that the creature that best
[32:36] represents where we are in the closing
[32:39] hours of the church ages is the flying
[32:43] eagle anointing
[32:45] i look at that like all the other
[32:47] preachers and believers before me and i
[32:50] notice that it doesn't say a a snorting
[32:53] ox
[32:55] it doesn't say a roaring lion or a
[32:58] walking man it just calls them
[33:00] identifies them as what they are but
[33:03] when it gets to the eagle
[33:06] it doesn't just say
[33:08] an eagle it says as a
[33:11] flying eagle
[33:13] there's a reason for that it's an
[33:16] end-time message for you and i
[33:19] that in order to be that astronaut in
[33:23] order to be that overcomer
[33:25] we are not just eagles by spiritual
[33:28] nature but we are eagles who have been
[33:31] called to soar and so we are not
[33:34] ourselves when we when we choose to
[33:38] remain earthbound
[33:40] you know i have been to those zoos
[33:43] brother branham talked about being there
[33:45] with little joseph and seeing that eagle
[33:49] all bound up in that cage and sometimes
[33:52] it's because the eagle has been
[33:54] harmed he has had some kind of
[33:58] an accident
[34:00] sometimes hit by a vehicle or someone is
[34:03] shot at him and he could not be
[34:06] rehabilitated to the point of living in
[34:08] the wild
[34:09] it seems quite unfair doesn't it for the
[34:12] the eagle to be bound like that but in
[34:14] some cases it's the only way he can have
[34:16] any sense of normal life at all
[34:19] but you and i are not that kind of an
[34:22] eagle the kind that has to remain on the
[34:24] earth
[34:25] we've had a wounded wing or two haven't
[34:28] we we've had some shots fired at us
[34:31] haven't we but god by his grace has
[34:34] poured the healing virtue of jesus
[34:37] christ over all of our wounds and he has
[34:41] anointed us that we would renew
[34:43] ourselves he's given us renewal and
[34:47] refreshment he's given us refillings of
[34:50] the holy ghost and so we are wiser
[34:53] eagles than we once were we are refusing
[34:57] to remain in our handicap we are
[35:00] refusing to remain in a state of injury
[35:03] when the lord has healed us and so the
[35:06] overcoming portion for the believer in
[35:09] the last age
[35:10] is the anointing of a flying eagle one
[35:14] that has not remained earthbound but one
[35:18] that has understood his privileges
[35:20] hallelujah he has understood that he was
[35:24] not born to live on the earth just walk
[35:28] around like any other
[35:30] animal or domestic animal you might see
[35:32] out there walk around like a dog or a
[35:35] cat oh no he has the grace and the
[35:38] gifted ability to fly
[35:42] oh to get up above it all and when i
[35:45] thought of that i looked again at some
[35:48] of the statistics that i have preached
[35:51] through the years about the eagle and
[35:53] the first one that caught my mind was
[35:56] that the eagle has the ability to soar
[35:59] at 10 000 feet
[36:02] did you know that most large passenger
[36:04] jets are flying at 30 to 35 000 feet so
[36:08] we're looking at an eagle
[36:10] and if you search it out you'll find no
[36:13] other bird is capable of remaining or
[36:17] most of them getting to that place if
[36:20] they can get there they can't remain but
[36:22] this that eagle has been specially built
[36:26] that he is able to soar to the height of
[36:30] ten thousand feet which is about three
[36:34] kilometers straight up in the air no
[36:37] other bird can do it he was created to
[36:40] do it he was specially built to do it
[36:43] and i want to say to you so were you
[36:46] you are created to get up above
[36:50] the atmosphere around you
[36:53] maybe the family is in a stir a stew a
[36:56] turmoil maybe there's problems with your
[36:59] job with your employment maybe finances
[37:03] have really taken a beating through this
[37:06] kind of pandemic and you're
[37:09] wringing your hands in concern and worry
[37:13] let me tell you my brother my sister you
[37:16] don't have to live in all of that
[37:20] depression you don't have to live in the
[37:24] squeezing of the enemy you've got
[37:27] something that others around you don't
[37:29] have
[37:30] you are not like every other bird you're
[37:33] not like every other man i i started
[37:36] looking at the astronaut school
[37:39] and just spent a little time reading and
[37:42] out of tens of thousands of people who
[37:46] want to be an astronaut it's amazing
[37:49] what a small
[37:50] number actually gets to live their dream
[37:54] well i want you to know you're one of
[37:56] the few hallelujah you're one of the few
[37:59] out of all the other birds who can't get
[38:02] to the 10 000 feet range to get up above
[38:05] the storm to get up above the wind and
[38:09] the rain and the turmoil and the disease
[38:12] and the affliction and the infirmity of
[38:15] earth's atmosphere but you my friend you
[38:18] my brother sister were born for that
[38:21] purpose that you would be able to just
[38:24] stretch your head and set your wings and
[38:28] allow the wind of the holy spirit
[38:30] hallelujah to carry you up up up up up
[38:35] above above
[38:38] above everything else and you're just
[38:41] saying goodbye to all the other birds
[38:43] that would flock around you as the old
[38:45] song we sing the old the other birds
[38:48] would like to flock around and and they
[38:51] call out and they don't understand they
[38:53] don't understand who you are they don't
[38:56] understand why you have been elected
[38:59] they don't understand why you don't have
[39:00] to be tossed around by the storms of
[39:03] this life they they just really don't
[39:06] understand but it's because you were
[39:08] chosen from before the foundation of the
[39:11] world you were built
[39:13] in a certain way just like the eagle was
[39:16] so that you can get under this word and
[39:19] this word will lift you up hallelujah
[39:22] this word will elevate you and raise you
[39:26] into a new dimension into a new place in
[39:29] the spirit will you yield to him and
[39:32] allow him to do that somebody said well
[39:35] you you haven't even taken your text yet
[39:38] that's right but i will before we close
[39:41] i will take my text but i want to finish
[39:44] this that eagle can get up above it all
[39:48] and what i have found out in my years of
[39:50] life is that if you can get up just a
[39:54] little higher than what you're going
[39:56] through and take a good look around
[39:58] just kind of stretch your head above the
[40:01] fence you know and see what's on the
[40:04] other side
[40:05] the enemy raises up fences to keep us
[40:08] from seeing the rest of the story
[40:11] the rest of the story he wants us
[40:14] focused on the bleak on the black on the
[40:16] dark on the negative on the pain on the
[40:19] suffering he wants us to focus on all
[40:22] that is wrong around us but oh my
[40:26] brother sister if you can just get your
[40:28] head up above the fence
[40:30] and look above the boundary and and
[40:33] survey the wondrous
[40:35] ability of god
[40:37] the wondrous power of god to give us the
[40:41] victory when we need it
[40:43] to raise us up with the wind of the
[40:46] spirit so that we can fly above it all i
[40:50] want you to know if you get up in that
[40:51] airplane i've never been in a in a a
[40:55] rocket ship but if you can get up in
[40:57] that airplane what looks so big down
[41:00] here on the earth these big buildings
[41:02] that we have in major cities around the
[41:05] world
[41:06] you can stand on the ground and look up
[41:09] 30 stories 40 stories right straight up
[41:13] in the air
[41:14] you can get in a building so tall
[41:17] that that you can feel it when you get
[41:19] to the top you can feel a slight sway
[41:22] it's built to do that
[41:24] it's built with an understanding that
[41:27] that is actually better than it being
[41:29] completely static completely stationary
[41:32] it needs that little bit of give for the
[41:34] wind and the storm i've been high enough
[41:36] in a building that i could feel that
[41:38] well i want you to know if you're
[41:40] standing out in front of that you can
[41:42] hardly look up and see the top
[41:44] it looks so huge but if you can go up on
[41:47] the top of that building and look down
[41:49] then you look down to those little
[41:51] people standing there looking up at that
[41:53] building and they look like little ants
[41:55] but if you can get in an airplane
[41:58] get way up above 30 000 feet if it's a
[42:02] clear day you can't always see that that
[42:05] if you're that high you can't always see
[42:06] the ground but if it's a clear day you
[42:09] look back down and that little building
[42:11] that looks so big
[42:14] uh when you were standing there looking
[42:15] at it it looks like a tiny little
[42:17] cracker box or something down on the
[42:19] ground and you can't even see the people
[42:21] that were standing there they're so
[42:23] little so perspective changes everything
[42:27] and the enemy knows that
[42:29] the devil knows that so he wants to keep
[42:33] us
[42:34] uh
[42:35] earthbound let's just say it that way he
[42:37] wants to keep us attached
[42:39] to this old earth
[42:41] but you have been given the grace of a
[42:43] flying eagle anointing that will take
[42:46] you so high that when you look at that
[42:49] problem that looks so big
[42:51] so insurmountable so impassable and
[42:55] impossible just a few minutes ago once
[42:58] you get caught up in that anointing as
[43:00] an astronaut
[43:02] you get up above it all and look down
[43:04] your perspective is entirely different
[43:08] so we've got to recognize who we are as
[43:10] the eagles and we've got to recognize
[43:13] who we are as god's end-time spiritual
[43:17] astronauts the eagle has the sharpest
[43:21] vision
[43:23] at a higher
[43:24] height
[43:25] of any other bird did you know that an
[43:28] eagle's vision is four to eight times
[43:32] sharper than the human eye
[43:35] and even though the eagle is small in
[43:38] comparison to a man his eye is almost
[43:42] the identical size as the eye of a man
[43:45] which gives him an incredible ability to
[43:49] see
[43:50] he has this great ability not only to
[43:54] see sharper
[43:56] but he also has the ability to see
[43:59] sharply
[44:00] from a long distance
[44:02] and we are told that an eagle can focus
[44:06] in
[44:07] on a jumping rabbit
[44:09] at 3.2 kilometers
[44:12] which for the rest of us over here is
[44:15] two miles
[44:16] a two mile distance between the eagle
[44:19] and the rabbit and the eagle can see
[44:22] that rabbit or what i have watched the
[44:24] eagle do is fly over a lake
[44:27] and you could be sitting in a boat and
[44:30] you wouldn't be able to see that fish if
[44:32] you were looking straight down into the
[44:33] water you couldn't see it but that eagle
[44:36] a mile up up in the air or more can look
[44:40] down in that water and see that fish if
[44:43] you've never seen it i wish you could he
[44:46] comes flying down out of the sky and
[44:49] goes on sometimes beneath the surface
[44:53] at least partially beneath the surface
[44:56] to catch that fish
[44:58] and you're thinking how in the world did
[45:01] he ever see it from up there he was
[45:03] built for that
[45:04] he was created for that and so it's no
[45:08] coincidence that brother branham called
[45:11] the spiritual astronauts eagles or
[45:14] believers eagles he got it right from
[45:16] the word of god where the believer the
[45:19] prophetic believer is referred to as an
[45:21] eagle and when i get that down in my
[45:24] spirit and i recognize at times that i
[45:28] am moping around in my circumstances
[45:32] just earthbound got more got more on my
[45:36] mind from this old world than i do from
[45:38] who i really am as a believer and when i
[45:41] catch myself doing that i cry out to the
[45:44] lord and what i usually do is instead of
[45:47] praying god help me i usually just raise
[45:50] my hand and start praising him singing
[45:53] some praise to him and you know what he
[45:56] that wind of the holy spirit will catch
[45:58] my wings and he will lift me above
[46:03] all of that
[46:04] circumstance he'll take me to a higher
[46:08] place in him
[46:10] now i have to take my text
[46:13] and i won't get to all of this
[46:15] but but it's out there
[46:18] this is a portion of a message that i
[46:20] brought to the church
[46:22] this past sunday and it's out there it's
[46:24] on the app and it's on youtube and it's
[46:26] on facebook
[46:27] and you can get the rest of it if if
[46:30] you're interested in it and i'm not here
[46:32] to trying to advertise something but i
[46:34] recognize that in the time i have i'll
[46:36] only hit a little of it
[46:38] but the the text that i want to leave
[46:40] you with that was my effort to help set
[46:44] the tone for these spiritual astronauts
[46:47] that are going to be gathering
[46:49] hallelujah for the next few days there
[46:52] in the great bible believers fellowship
[46:54] sanctuary and around the world i wanted
[46:57] to set the tone i got a little carried
[46:59] away though didn't i but the the the
[47:02] text that i have that i've got to give
[47:04] you is isaiah 54 17. it says no weapon
[47:08] say that with me no weapon
[47:11] that is formed against thee shall
[47:13] prosper and every tongue that shall oh i
[47:17] want to stop and say listen at this
[47:19] devil
[47:20] listen at this brother listen to this
[47:22] sister listen at this whoever you are
[47:25] no weapon that is formed against thee
[47:27] shall prosper and every tongue that
[47:30] shall rise against thee in judgment thou
[47:34] shalt condemn
[47:36] this is the heritage of the servants of
[47:39] the lord and their righteousness is of
[47:43] me
[47:44] saith the lord
[47:46] i want to read this very quickly in the
[47:49] amplified and i know that some people
[47:51] don't get their mind around that but i
[47:53] want to share it anyway he said but no
[47:56] weapon that is formed against you shall
[47:58] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[48:00] against you in judgment you shall show
[48:03] it
[48:04] or you shall show to be in the wrong
[48:08] that means you will reveal
[48:11] that it was not the truth it was a false
[48:14] accusation and you'll be able to do that
[48:16] by the consistency of your life
[48:19] this peace righteousness security
[48:22] triumph over opposition is the heritage
[48:26] of the servants of the lord
[48:28] we are his servants
[48:31] our heritage is to be an overcomer
[48:36] our heritage is to tear down
[48:40] every weapon
[48:42] that the enemy forms against our lives
[48:46] to be able to overcome that is the gift
[48:50] that god has given us in this hour
[48:53] this is the heritage of the servants of
[48:55] the lord those in whom
[48:58] the ideal servant of the lord is
[49:01] reproduced
[49:03] jesus christ is the ultimate servant of
[49:06] god
[49:07] because he said i can't do anything
[49:10] unless my father reveals or shows me
[49:13] what to do
[49:15] so he was the word made flesh totally
[49:18] surrendered to the will
[49:22] of the eternal spirit of the father
[49:25] such oneness
[49:27] such surrender
[49:28] such obedience
[49:30] so we are we are being trained
[49:34] to be the servants of the lord
[49:37] and our example is the greatest servant
[49:40] of the lord of all times and it's the
[49:42] life of christ that's being reproduced
[49:45] in us
[49:46] this is the resurrect excuse me this is
[49:49] the righteousness
[49:51] or the vindication
[49:53] which they obtained from me
[49:56] this is that which i impart to them as
[50:00] their justification says the lord
[50:02] hallelujah that blesses my blesser
[50:06] because i have no
[50:08] very little righteousness of my own to
[50:11] bring
[50:13] i could never stand in the holiness of
[50:17] god
[50:17] with what little bit of righteousness i
[50:20] can produce but i don't stand there in
[50:23] my righteousness hallelujah
[50:25] i stand there in his righteousness
[50:30] i stand there covered by what he has
[50:33] done on my behalf
[50:35] now i want you to know that god has
[50:37] promised you and i victory over all of
[50:41] our enemies
[50:43] he has promised us deliverance from all
[50:46] the weapons that are formed against us
[50:50] in this hour whether it's sickness
[50:53] whether it's the curse of words whether
[50:56] it's difficulty with finance or family
[50:59] troubles or or barrenness
[51:02] whatever the enemy
[51:05] is forming as a weapon
[51:07] against your life
[51:09] the word of god has said it will not
[51:12] prosper
[51:14] now how do i keep it from prospering i
[51:17] come into agreement with god's word
[51:21] i refuse to be shaped by the weapons
[51:25] that the enemy forms against me
[51:28] i refuse to walk in days of dark deep
[51:33] depression when the word of the hour has
[51:36] helped me to identify who i am and i
[51:40] recognize that i am called to sit in
[51:44] high places to sit together with christ
[51:47] in an elevated place far
[51:50] above the darkness of this whole world
[51:54] called to dwell where astronauts are
[51:57] to call to live and soar where eagles
[52:00] fly
[52:02] this is my heritage
[52:04] and what we recognize about
[52:07] these enemies
[52:09] that are used against us
[52:12] and sometimes it's a it's a person
[52:15] it can be a person
[52:17] sometimes
[52:18] it's cancer
[52:20] or a virus
[52:21] some sort of disease that the enemy uses
[52:25] against us as a weapon to destroy us
[52:29] but when we look at
[52:31] what the prophet of god told us the last
[52:34] great battle would be about
[52:37] he told us in the greatest battle ever
[52:39] fought
[52:40] that it would be on the battlefield of
[52:43] the mind it would be the greatest battle
[52:46] that we were ever fighting
[52:49] and it would be on the battlefield of
[52:52] the mind
[52:53] but he also let us know
[52:56] that it's not only the greatest battle
[52:58] ever fought it is the last battle
[53:02] that the bride will ever have to fight
[53:05] when we win the battle in the mind when
[53:09] we are able to shut down the reasonings
[53:13] of the devil
[53:15] when we are able to rise above them with
[53:18] the anointing of the flying eagle
[53:21] and get up to where we can sit with
[53:24] christ
[53:25] in heavenly places and he can reproduce
[53:28] his life
[53:29] he can reproduce his image in us when we
[53:33] come to that the battle
[53:35] is forever over
[53:38] so we are on a journey and we are
[53:41] winning
[53:43] one battle at a time
[53:45] one victory at a time one healing at a
[53:48] time one deliverance at a time
[53:51] but there's coming an hour when we will
[53:54] finish the greatest battle ever fought
[53:57] we will once and for all be the
[54:01] astronaut that we were born to be the
[54:04] eagle that we were born to be
[54:06] there is coming an hour where we will so
[54:10] be done
[54:12] be so finished so done with our own
[54:15] thinking
[54:16] we have really
[54:17] pulled it down
[54:19] cast it down
[54:20] and applied the word of god to it and
[54:24] renewed it by the unction of the holy
[54:26] spirit until we can then say we have the
[54:30] mind of christ and when we are fully
[54:34] functioning in that mind of christ then
[54:38] the greatest battle is the battle that
[54:41] has come to an end hallelujah and i
[54:43] believe that that is my destiny i
[54:47] believe that is your destiny we have won
[54:51] that battle in our heart we have we have
[54:54] potentially received the victory that
[54:58] jesus christ has won on our behalf but
[55:00] we're having to live that thing out
[55:02] every day
[55:03] and what we find out is that sometimes
[55:07] we
[55:08] become the weapon
[55:10] that is formed against us
[55:13] our lives we
[55:15] become the weapon
[55:17] that's formed against our own life how
[55:21] is that possible it's not like we take a
[55:25] gun and shoot ourselves in the foot
[55:28] it's not like we we attack ourselves in
[55:31] some physical way
[55:33] how is it that we become the weapon that
[55:36] is formed against our own life and
[55:40] well-being i can easily show you
[55:43] it is
[55:44] in the mind
[55:46] it is by our own stinking
[55:49] thinking
[55:51] it is because we do too much thinking on
[55:54] our own and not enough of that divine
[55:58] exchange
[55:59] where we exchange our own thoughts
[56:02] and our own way
[56:04] our own will for his thoughts for his
[56:08] ways
[56:09] for his will
[56:11] it becomes such a battle
[56:13] and
[56:14] i asked the lord let me just give you
[56:16] the scripture in psalm 141 and 3 he said
[56:20] set a watch o lord
[56:22] before my mouth
[56:24] and keep the door
[56:27] of my lips i want you to know god wants
[56:30] to cooperate with you
[56:32] he wants to help you win the battle
[56:35] of of words
[56:37] and thoughts
[56:39] the prophet told us
[56:41] that a word is a thought expressed so if
[56:44] your words are rotten it's because your
[56:47] thoughts are rotten and you say i just
[56:50] don't understand why that has much to do
[56:52] with overcoming spiritually and getting
[56:54] up above well i'll tell you why because
[56:57] thoughts matter and what we think
[57:00] affects every part of our life so i ask
[57:04] the lord lord give me a few thoughts
[57:06] give me a few things that i can share
[57:09] that are ways that we sometimes become
[57:14] the weapon
[57:16] formed against our own lives and the
[57:18] first thought that he brought to me by
[57:20] inspiration was by holding on to our own
[57:23] stinking thinking by holding on to our
[57:26] own negative thoughts
[57:29] proverbs 23 and 7 says for as he
[57:32] thinketh in his heart so
[57:34] is he you see we become
[57:38] what we think our thoughts form our
[57:42] lives how is that possible because our
[57:46] thoughts form our decisions
[57:49] our decisions form our actions our
[57:53] behaviors what we do and what we do
[57:57] ultimately determines how we walk out
[58:01] the destiny that god has given us in
[58:04] this hour
[58:05] everything my friend starts with a
[58:08] thought
[58:09] i dare say every person listening to the
[58:13] sound of my voice has a battle from time
[58:16] to time if not all the time
[58:19] in the mind in the thought life and
[58:23] those negative thoughts sometimes
[58:27] referred to as ants
[58:29] because they are automatic negative
[58:31] thoughts that come into the mind because
[58:34] we have wired them into our brain
[58:37] by harboring those thoughts by
[58:40] entertaining those thoughts
[58:42] my old granny used to say and it's an
[58:44] old southern expression brother branham
[58:47] used something similar to it she said
[58:49] you can't keep a bird from flying over
[58:52] your head but you don't have to stand
[58:54] still and let him build a nest in your
[58:56] hair
[58:57] it's the same way
[58:59] a thought can certainly fly by it can
[59:03] certainly come up in your mind but you
[59:06] have to make a decision as an astronaut
[59:09] you have to make a decision as an eagle
[59:12] are you going to let that thought become
[59:14] a weight on your shoulder are you going
[59:17] to let it become a noose
[59:19] around your neck or a gun in your hand
[59:22] are you going to allow that thought to
[59:25] become a weapon that the enemy is
[59:27] forming
[59:28] and helping you inspiring you to form
[59:32] that brings destruction and damage to
[59:35] your own spiritual being we must cast
[59:38] down all imaginations every thought that
[59:41] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[59:43] jesus christ and we're thinking some
[59:46] people upwards of a hundred thousand
[59:49] thoughts a day and some people it's much
[59:52] less twenty thousand thirty thousand
[59:54] thoughts a day come into our mind and
[59:57] everything begins with a thought and
[59:59] thoughts matter and if our mind doesn't
[1:00:02] change our life won't change
[1:00:05] if our thoughts don't change then we
[1:00:08] can't see real change in our life but if
[1:00:11] we change our mind
[1:00:13] change our words
[1:00:15] then we change our words because our
[1:00:18] thoughts have changed and then we see
[1:00:19] our life beginning to follow suit
[1:00:23] watch your thoughts because your
[1:00:24] thoughts become your actions and
[1:00:26] eventually become your destiny they
[1:00:29] become the pattern and the path that you
[1:00:32] walk out in life thoughts create your
[1:00:34] moods
[1:00:35] if you find yourself in a grouchy mood
[1:00:39] it's because you have allowed thoughts
[1:00:41] to enter in
[1:00:43] that have disturbed your sense of peace
[1:00:45] the sense of well-being that god has
[1:00:47] given you as a part of his little bride
[1:00:50] and so you can come into an angry mood a
[1:00:53] foul mood a depressed mood a sad mood a
[1:00:57] grumpy mood just by allowing a thought
[1:01:01] to stay too long and start building some
[1:01:04] kind of nest
[1:01:06] in your head in your hair
[1:01:08] you have the power by the grace of god
[1:01:10] to overcome that and to cast that down i
[1:01:14] wish that i had time to
[1:01:16] to break that down a little more for you
[1:01:19] but i want you to know that one of the
[1:01:22] ways that we allow our own selves to
[1:01:25] become the weapon
[1:01:27] that's formed against our life is by
[1:01:30] keep not keeping our thoughts centered
[1:01:33] on christ
[1:01:35] not keeping our thoughts centered on the
[1:01:37] word
[1:01:38] it's so important to recognize that many
[1:01:42] many physicians and doctors are telling
[1:01:44] us today
[1:01:45] that 75 to
[1:01:48] 98
[1:01:50] of all mental physical emotional and
[1:01:53] behavioral illnesses
[1:01:56] are
[1:01:56] formed from a bad thought life yes
[1:02:01] your thoughts can even affect your
[1:02:04] physical body they can affect the organs
[1:02:07] of your body and if you think this is
[1:02:09] some kind of new age uh
[1:02:11] hocus pocus you need to do some more
[1:02:14] digging around the message of the hour
[1:02:16] because brother branham in those prayer
[1:02:18] lines he would minister to people and he
[1:02:21] would say you're in this fix you're a
[1:02:23] nervous person you cross your bridges
[1:02:26] before you come to them and god wants to
[1:02:28] give you strength to get out of that and
[1:02:30] when you do
[1:02:32] your body will be healed
[1:02:34] and so there is a vindicated prophet
[1:02:37] helping us to understand
[1:02:39] that your thoughts
[1:02:41] have a great impact on your physical
[1:02:44] well-being and i can tell you for sure
[1:02:47] your thoughts have a great impact on
[1:02:49] your spiritual well-being so let's not
[1:02:52] be the weapon formed against ourselves
[1:02:54] there's something called a negativity
[1:02:56] bias and we don't have time to talk
[1:02:59] about that today but but it's just like
[1:03:01] a spirit that really kind of forms on us
[1:03:04] and we just start looking at everything
[1:03:06] negative it doesn't matter how positive
[1:03:08] it is it looks negative to us
[1:03:11] it doesn't matter how wonderful it is
[1:03:13] what god is doing we think it's the most
[1:03:15] awful thing that ever happened and it's
[1:03:16] a it's a bias that we form in our own
[1:03:19] mind
[1:03:20] and the enemy oh he just rejoices when
[1:03:24] when believers become so negative when
[1:03:27] they become so doubt-filled instead of
[1:03:30] faith field he just becomes so
[1:03:33] just really victorious he just dances
[1:03:36] all around because he realizes he's
[1:03:38] winning the battle of the mind against
[1:03:42] you if that's if that's how you're
[1:03:44] responding in the message testimony of
[1:03:47] the raising the dead boy in 1953 brother
[1:03:50] branham said here's an old slogan i want
[1:03:52] you to remember
[1:03:54] do right
[1:03:55] that's your duty to god think right
[1:03:58] that's your duty to yourself and then
[1:04:02] you're bound to be right so if you want
[1:04:05] to be right before god
[1:04:08] watch your
[1:04:10] thoughts
[1:04:11] the second way that the lord brought to
[1:04:13] me was
[1:04:14] that we can become the the weapon formed
[1:04:17] against our own life is by carrying
[1:04:20] offense
[1:04:21] we must let it go in the name of jesus
[1:04:25] we must not carry roots of bitterness
[1:04:29] against one another and i could expand
[1:04:32] that if time would let me but search
[1:04:35] your heart
[1:04:36] first of all search your mind for
[1:04:38] negative thoughts and submit them to the
[1:04:41] word of god second of all search your
[1:04:44] heart for any root of bitterness or
[1:04:46] offense that you may be carrying against
[1:04:49] any brother or any sister and as the
[1:04:51] prophet told us take that grubbing hole
[1:04:54] and dig that out of your life and the
[1:04:57] third thing that god spoke to me about
[1:05:00] in making this list was
[1:05:02] that we make a mistake when we remain in
[1:05:06] unforgiveness
[1:05:08] we
[1:05:09] must be a people
[1:05:10] who forgive
[1:05:12] it doesn't matter how many times seven
[1:05:16] times no no seventy times seven
[1:05:20] and if you are struggling to forgive
[1:05:22] somebody i want you to take a moment and
[1:05:24] step back and i want you to think of the
[1:05:26] things that god has forgiven you of
[1:05:30] time after time after time after time
[1:05:33] after time i've called on him for help
[1:05:36] he has helped me he has forgiven me he
[1:05:39] has set me free and i want you to know
[1:05:42] that makes me once i come to that
[1:05:45] understanding it makes me want to show
[1:05:47] the same compassion to others that he
[1:05:49] has shown to be
[1:05:51] i believe with all my heart i i would
[1:05:54] just love to take some more uh
[1:05:57] scriptures here and some more quotes but
[1:06:00] i i've gotten out an outline and i'm
[1:06:02] going to leave it with you
[1:06:04] i would just hope and pray that every
[1:06:08] one of us would enter into a new year of
[1:06:10] 2022 with a fresh slate that we would
[1:06:14] just repent before god of our negative
[1:06:17] thought life and we would just repent of
[1:06:20] any grudge that we're holding on to
[1:06:23] against someone else any root of
[1:06:25] bitterness that we've allowed the enemy
[1:06:27] to form in us
[1:06:29] and that we would search our lives to
[1:06:32] see
[1:06:32] if there is someone that we are
[1:06:36] walking in unforgiveness toward choosing
[1:06:39] not to forgive instead of choosing to
[1:06:42] forgive if we will
[1:06:44] act be actively involved in keeping our
[1:06:48] own life and vessels sanctified and
[1:06:51] clean before god not just the way we
[1:06:54] dress
[1:06:55] and present ourselves outwardly but most
[1:06:58] importantly how we are inwardly this is
[1:07:02] what god seems to be dealing with us
[1:07:06] about in this hour getting down into the
[1:07:09] root of the matter and allowing the holy
[1:07:12] spirit of god to deal with each part of
[1:07:15] who we are
[1:07:16] when we do that then we will not resist
[1:07:20] the anointing
[1:07:21] we will not resist the move of god's
[1:07:24] spirit that comes among us to lift us up
[1:07:28] above
[1:07:29] all
[1:07:30] the the
[1:07:31] mundane
[1:07:33] ugliness of life
[1:07:36] heartache and hardship and troubles and
[1:07:39] problems
[1:07:40] and depression choose today my brother
[1:07:42] sister to be the spiritual astronaut
[1:07:46] that god has called you to be choose
[1:07:48] today to be the eagle to
[1:07:51] soar before god with the overcoming
[1:07:54] flying eagle anointing getting up above
[1:07:57] all of this other stuff
[1:08:00] that has been such a weight around our
[1:08:02] necks i believe that a victorious bride
[1:08:05] is standing ready in this hour to do the
[1:08:09] work of god so that we can all catch a
[1:08:13] rapture i was going to close with a
[1:08:15] another quotation about the the from the
[1:08:19] countdown about the rapture but i'm
[1:08:21] going to leave that for one of these
[1:08:23] other brothers to minister to you
[1:08:26] i just believe that you're going to have
[1:08:28] a rapture time i do i believe you're
[1:08:30] going to be caught up into glorious
[1:08:32] places over the course of the next few
[1:08:35] days
[1:08:36] my heart is there with you
[1:08:39] i can't even tell you my eyes just
[1:08:42] filled with tears and my heart gets all
[1:08:45] choked up
[1:08:46] when i think about you
[1:08:48] and when i think about how
[1:08:51] so many of you have stood the test of
[1:08:54] time
[1:08:55] going forth to declare the goodness of
[1:08:57] god and his grace to us
[1:08:59] in this glorious message the revelation
[1:09:02] of jesus christ i send you my love and
[1:09:05] i'm going off today praying for you
[1:09:09] that you will
[1:09:10] search your hearts
[1:09:12] and make sure
[1:09:13] that you are not being a weapon
[1:09:17] formed against your own success

[1:09:24] forever father i lift up the saints of
[1:09:27] god in ghana west africa and all of our
[1:09:31] brothers and sisters around the world we

[1:09:39] election of grace i ask today that you
[1:09:43] would help us to take the grubbing hoe
[1:09:45] of your word

[1:09:51] unforgiveness if we need to go and make
[1:09:54] it right may we have courage to go and
[1:09:56] make it right give us grace to identify

[1:10:02] imaginations of our mind that can keep

[1:10:11] these meetings i pray that shackles will
[1:10:14] fall off
