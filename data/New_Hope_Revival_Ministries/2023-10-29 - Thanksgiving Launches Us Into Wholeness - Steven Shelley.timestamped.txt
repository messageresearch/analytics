[59:45] want to wish her a happy birthday let's
[59:47] go to God's word today if you are
[59:50] interested in uh a copy of the prophecy
[59:53] from camp meeting concerning Angelic uh
[59:56] reinforcements there's some on the back
[59:58] table there for you this morning if you
[1:00:00] didn't already get a copy and you can
[1:00:03] have one and if we need to get others uh
[1:00:06] then we certainly will we want to go to
[1:00:08] the Lord in prayer uh one more time
[1:00:11] before we approach the word and uh we
[1:00:14] want to not only pray for Israel as we
[1:00:18] said but we want to pray for our nation
[1:00:21] because this is a time I I don't know
[1:00:24] that there has ever been such an hour
[1:00:26] that we have had uh 20
[1:00:30] attacks on our personal property our our
[1:00:35] interest in other parts of the world 20
[1:00:38] attacks uh no casualties thank God but a
[1:00:41] great am amount of damage has been done
[1:00:44] and when we finally decide to retaliate
[1:00:48] we hit an empty
[1:00:51] warehouse and the world rejoices you
[1:00:53] know America's so happy we're we're
[1:00:55] we're uh you know getting some
[1:00:58] retaliation and we find out that we have
[1:01:02] with all of our intelligence
[1:01:04] capabilities we have bombed an empty
[1:01:07] Warehouse so we have sent no message to
[1:01:10] this world none no message at all in
[1:01:13] fact the message that we're sending is
[1:01:15] you just continue to take out uh our
[1:01:18] Assets in other nations and we'll just
[1:01:21] smile and let you get by and there's
[1:01:23] probably never been such an hour in
[1:01:25] America that our leadership was so weak
[1:01:28] that there's no one to make a decision
[1:01:31] you know God did a beautiful thing for
[1:01:33] us this week he put a Godly Man for the
[1:01:37] first time in a long time we can say
[1:01:40] there's a Godly Man uh as Speaker of the
[1:01:43] House and we're very thankful Louisiana
[1:01:46] has birthed defined man and God has
[1:01:49] somehow allowed him to be can you
[1:01:51] imagine the contrast between Pelosi
[1:01:54] and what God has given us now we're very
[1:01:58] very thankful for it but uh and you know
[1:02:00] that's an important office someone said
[1:02:02] to me recently I don't know what all the
[1:02:04] hoopla is about that's not a very
[1:02:06] important office it's actually the third
[1:02:08] highest office in our nation so it's
[1:02:11] pretty important and what that means is
[1:02:13] if something were to happen to our
[1:02:16] president and vice president at the same
[1:02:19] time the speaker of the house would be
[1:02:21] sworn in immediately as president of the
[1:02:23] United States so to know that there is a
[1:02:26] man there who who boldly declared from
[1:02:30] the floor I'm a Bible believing
[1:02:32] Christian and led by the spirit of God
[1:02:36] is a wonderful thing and we should
[1:02:38] certainly praise the Lord for that we
[1:02:40] want to pray that our leadership can get
[1:02:43] stronger in this hour not only in its uh
[1:02:46] bipartisan support for the nation of
[1:02:48] Israel but also to say to Iran that that
[1:02:51] uh you know we're tired of your you
[1:02:53] rattling your Sabers yes and we know we
[1:02:57] know that uh it's time for that
[1:02:59] situation to be dealt with so all we can
[1:03:02] do is pray and that's a
[1:03:04] lot prayer is a lot so let's just pray
[1:03:07] just a moment before we go to the word
[1:03:09] today Father we once again pray as
[1:03:12] Nathan did for the Peace of Jerusalem we
[1:03:17] pray oh God that uh peace will reain
[1:03:20] within her Gates and we pray Lord that
[1:03:23] she shall uh be a house of prayer for
[1:03:26] all nations as your word has declared
[1:03:30] and we pray for for the land of Israel
[1:03:32] and for the the people of that land your
[1:03:36] people Lord and brave brave courageous
[1:03:39] men and women many of them who left the
[1:03:43] Comforts of our nation many many years
[1:03:45] ago to stand in solidarity with the
[1:03:48] Jewish people we pray for their
[1:03:50] protection today we pray for the IDF and
[1:03:54] the iaf and we pray for uh each branch
[1:03:57] of protection for the nation of Israel
[1:04:00] including mosad we pray Lord that your
[1:04:04] hand would be upon them and they would
[1:04:06] make Godly choices that they would make
[1:04:08] wise decisions and that they would
[1:04:11] consider the the value of life and not
[1:04:14] only not only Jewish life but all life
[1:04:18] is sacred to you we pray for our nation
[1:04:21] we thank you Lord above it all we thank
[1:04:23] you for being God over this country over
[1:04:27] this nation we know that she has
[1:04:29] forgotten and forsaken you but we thank
[1:04:31] you that you have never forsaken her we
[1:04:34] thank you for raising up a Godly Man to
[1:04:37] be a voice in the House of
[1:04:39] Representatives we thank you for his
[1:04:41] witness already and for his testimony we
[1:04:44] thank you Lord that social media has
[1:04:47] been full this week of a prayer meeting
[1:04:50] that was on the floor Lord if there's
[1:04:52] ever been a time when we we need leaders
[1:04:55] Who Will Pray who will seek your face
[1:04:58] who will help this nation turn from her
[1:05:01] Wicked Ways this is the hour and so much
[1:05:05] is is depending on the strength of this
[1:05:08] nation in a time like this so we pray
[1:05:11] for our leaders oh God that you will
[1:05:15] truly uh give them strength and courage
[1:05:18] and wisdom and Leadership father may
[1:05:21] they may they make good decisions Godly
[1:05:25] choices may they may they not waffle
[1:05:27] around for election purposes but may
[1:05:31] they stand firm for for the protection
[1:05:34] of our assets around the world the the
[1:05:37] these are not just buildings they're
[1:05:39] people they're soldiers their families
[1:05:42] that are represented there living in
[1:05:44] those places with children here in
[1:05:48] America with wives and husbands back
[1:05:51] here at home and so we pray also for
[1:05:53] their protection we pray oh God that you
[1:05:57] will help us to be Watchmen on the wall
[1:06:00] and that you will inspire Us in the hour
[1:06:03] in which you would have us to be active
[1:06:05] on the wall of prayer and in the place
[1:06:07] of intercession and we will give you
[1:06:10] glory and honor and praise for it's in
[1:06:12] the exalted name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:16] Christ that we pray and the Saints said
[1:06:19] amen amen amen let's turn this morning
[1:06:23] to Psalm
[1:06:27] 116 I considered speaking today I have
[1:06:32] really uh dealt with
[1:06:36] some um backlash as we mentioned on
[1:06:39] Tuesday night uh since last Sunday and
[1:06:44] uh I really to be honest with you I left
[1:06:46] here feeling like quite a failure after
[1:06:49] the service on Sunday I just could not
[1:06:53] deliver what was was in my heart I I
[1:06:56] take full responsibility for that and I
[1:06:59] ask you to pray for me today it has left
[1:07:02] me a bit
[1:07:22] gunshy31 would you all punch one another
[1:07:26] you know let let her sleep for a little
[1:07:28] while and then and then punch her and
[1:07:29] you take your nap it's very very hard
[1:07:33] when you're already struggling to look
[1:07:35] around and see so many getting such good
[1:07:37] rest when you know that you've been up
[1:07:40] in the night preparing to deliver the
[1:07:42] word of the Lord I'm a little bit
[1:07:45] jealous that you're getting such good
[1:07:47] rest while the word is going forth so if
[1:07:50] you need me to help coordinate uh your
[1:07:54] your uh slot for sleep let me know we'll
[1:07:57] do a sign up schedule are you getting
[1:07:59] the point yes good I don't say it with
[1:08:03] any anger at all none whatsoever but I
[1:08:05] am serious this is not an hour this is
[1:08:09] just well
[1:08:13] anyway Psalm 116: 16-19 oh Lord
[1:08:19] truly I am thy servant I am am thy
[1:08:24] servant and the son of thine
[1:08:28] handmade thou Hast loosed my bonds can
[1:08:32] anybody say Amen to that thou Hast
[1:08:37] loosed my bonds I will offer to thee the
[1:08:47] sacrifice of
[1:08:50] Thanksgiving and will call upon the name
[1:08:54] of the
[1:08:56] Lord I will pay my vows unto the
[1:09:03] Lord now in the presence of all his
[1:09:09] people the the psalmist is saying what I
[1:09:13] have promised I will do I will fulfill I
[1:09:18] won't be slack in my payments to the
[1:09:21] Lord I will pay my vow do you know the
[1:09:24] Bible said it's better not to make a vow
[1:09:27] than to make a vow and break it we want
[1:09:30] to pay our vows to the Lord now in the
[1:09:33] presence of his people and then verse 19
[1:09:35] in the courts of the Lord's House in the

[1:11:23] honor and glory for it's in the name of
[1:11:26] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen while
[1:11:29] you're being seated I would just say to
[1:11:31] the streamers that we will go back and
[1:11:34] get your prayer request that you have
[1:11:37] posted here in the chat and we will pray
[1:11:39] over it I won't stop to mention those
[1:11:42] needs now but I know that uh that you
[1:11:45] are concerned and you shared your need
[1:11:47] and I want you to know we care about you
[1:11:50] we care about your need and we will go
[1:11:52] back over these requests I will myself
[1:11:55] and we'll pray over them and believe
[1:11:57] that God will meet you at the point of
[1:11:59] your need he's that kind of God I I said
[1:12:03] he's that kind of God C could you just
[1:12:07] uh put up for me the the uh the meaning
[1:12:12] of the word
[1:12:13] Thanksgiving I I uh I have not missed I
[1:12:19] realize that this is
[1:12:22] October and I I know that we are
[1:12:25] entering in in a few days
[1:12:28] to uh Thanksgiving time the month of
[1:12:32] November but I I just couldn't do it I
[1:12:36] had prepared this week to speak about
[1:12:41] some dark things some witchcraft type
[1:12:45] things and and I just I just couldn't do
[1:12:48] it I I I made plenty of notes and I have
[1:12:51] plenty to say about it and I
[1:12:53] I feel like I know a good bit about the
[1:12:56] subject but I just couldn't do it I just
[1:12:59] could not do it I I didn't see any
[1:13:03] reason at a time like this to glorify
[1:13:08] Halloween it it gets enough
[1:13:11] attention there is something wrong with
[1:13:14] a holy ghost filled
[1:13:16] believer that would post a picture of a
[1:13:20] grandchild dressed like a witch and
[1:13:23] expect me to think that's
[1:13:25] cute I there's something wrong you know
[1:13:28] what it is they don't believe they
[1:13:30] absolutely do not believe that
[1:13:32] witchcraft is
[1:13:35] real they think that it's some kind of
[1:13:38] game they're probably Harry Potter
[1:13:41] readers you know they they they don't
[1:13:44] understand uh what they're even playing
[1:13:47] around with but it has so weakened the
[1:13:50] church's ability to deal with anything
[1:13:52] like that
[1:13:54] because if you don't believe it exists
[1:13:56] then you're certainly not going to
[1:13:58] exercise any kind of authority over that
[1:14:01] stuff and it doesn't do any good to try
[1:14:04] to exercise authority over what you're
[1:14:06] opening the door
[1:14:08] for you have no Authority if you're the
[1:14:10] one opening the door to such darkness
[1:14:14] and I can teach I have I've done
[1:14:16] seminars and I've done whole whole
[1:14:19] prophetic sessions on witchcraft and
[1:14:22] opening doors and closing doors and
[1:14:25] repenting for generational iniquity and
[1:14:29] I I know the subject pretty well but I
[1:14:32] just thought at a time like this that we
[1:14:35] would rather choose to use this season
[1:14:39] to thank God in advance we don't have to
[1:14:42] wait until the third Thursday of the
[1:14:45] month to Show Thanksgiving and praise
[1:14:49] and honor to God so so we're kicking off
[1:14:53] the the season of Thanksgiving but we
[1:14:56] really believe in thanks living we
[1:14:59] really believe that being thankful is a
[1:15:01] lifestyle it's not something you
[1:15:03] celebrate once a year but it's something
[1:15:06] that you learn to walk in to offer the
[1:15:10] sacrifice of Thanksgiving the word
[1:15:14] Thanksgiving that's what I'm showing you
[1:15:16] here in the Hebrew it is strongs
[1:15:21] 8426 it is
[1:15:23] the word
[1:15:25] toada TOA it's a modern not only is it
[1:15:28] an ancient Hebrew word it's a modern
[1:15:31] Hebrew word and in Israel you will hear
[1:15:34] toada every day of your life there won't
[1:15:38] be a day that you live that you won't
[1:15:41] hear the word toada it means in modern
[1:15:44] Hebrew thank you and we add uh after
[1:15:49] toada we say toada rabah means very much
[1:15:55] so when someone says in Israel toar Rah
[1:15:59] they're saying thank you very much you
[1:16:02] answer them like many languages you
[1:16:06] don't answer them you're welcome you
[1:16:08] answer like other languages of Europe by
[1:16:11] saying
[1:16:13] please please is the way you answer when
[1:16:16] someone says thank you very much so in
[1:16:19] Hebrew you say toara and the answer is
[1:16:24] bakha bakha which means please or as we
[1:16:29] would use it it means uh you're welcome
[1:16:33] I I thank you for being thankful thank
[1:16:35] you for thanking me it's like some
[1:16:37] people who feel it necessary to write a
[1:16:41] a thank you note for a thank you
[1:16:45] note you'll got a lot of time that's
[1:16:47] what I want to say you got a lot of time
[1:16:50] you don't have to write a thank you note
[1:16:51] for a thank you note but how many of you
[1:16:54] like thank you notes well sure we do I
[1:16:57] want you to look at this word because I
[1:16:59] think it's an important word that I
[1:17:01] would like to keep before us as we enter
[1:17:04] the month of November it's toada
[1:17:07] properly it means an extension of the
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:13] hand so the New Testament is not so
[1:17:17] strange after all when the Apostle says
[1:17:20] I would that men everywhere would lift
[1:17:24] up holy hands without wrath and without
[1:17:28] doubt he gets that from the Old
[1:17:30] Testament word Thanksgiving toada it is
[1:17:34] an extension of the Hand by implication
[1:17:39] it is an
[1:17:41] avow now that is not AE I O
[1:17:47] U that's a vowel v w l for you School
[1:17:52] teach
[1:17:53] teachers ah and you can teach children
[1:17:57] you know how I learned that it it had
[1:18:00] something to do with borrowing
[1:18:03] sugar anybody remember that oh my
[1:18:05] goodness am I the only one that learned
[1:18:07] it that way the little girl the little
[1:18:10] girl couldn't talk very plain she went
[1:18:13] over and borrowed a cup of sugar for her
[1:18:15] for her mother from the neighbor and
[1:18:18] when she went back she gave her a can
[1:18:21] handed her the cup of sugar and she said
[1:18:24] AE I ow you a cup of
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:31] sugar AE lady I owe you a cup of sugar
[1:18:36] oh my
[1:18:42] goodness that's not the vowel we're
[1:18:44] talking
[1:18:45] about the word of vowel means an
[1:18:50] affirmation of the truth that you
[1:18:55] believe when you are showing God
[1:18:58] toada when you are giving God
[1:19:01] Thanksgiving when you are extending your
[1:19:04] hand to him you're not just saying thank
[1:19:07] you sir right you're saying I believe
[1:19:10] that you are good and I believe that you
[1:19:14] are faithful and I believe that every
[1:19:17] good thing that happens to me is because
[1:19:20] of you and I believe that you will never
[1:19:23] leave me nor forsake me and I believe
[1:19:25] that you will go with me even to the end
[1:19:27] of the Earth and I believe that though I
[1:19:30] Ascend in the heaven you're there though
[1:19:32] I make my bed in hell you're there and I
[1:19:34] believe it goes on and on and on and on
[1:19:37] and on it is an a vowel it is a
[1:19:40] statement that says I believe this is
[1:19:44] the truth that I
[1:19:46] believe an avow also means an honest
[1:19:51] admission I'm just honestly expressing
[1:19:55] that I can't make it without
[1:19:59] you it's
[1:20:02] adoration specifically a
[1:20:05] choir or A procession of worshippers
[1:20:09] have you ever heard of a worship
[1:20:11] parade this is a parade of people that
[1:20:15] are maybe we call it a Jericho March and
[1:20:19] there's a parade of people who are
[1:20:22] singing praises and shouting praises to
[1:20:25] the Lord that's what Thanksgiving means
[1:20:29] it
[1:20:29] means
[1:20:31] AOW
[1:20:34] confession so that's not the kind that
[1:20:37] happens behind the curtain in a in a
[1:20:41] confessional it's not the kind that
[1:20:44] takes place under a rock so no one can
[1:20:47] hear you or see you but it's it's a loud
[1:20:50] confession it's it's vocal
[1:20:53] Thanksgiving it's not silently being
[1:20:56] thankful it's about vocally being
[1:20:59] thankful it's about a sacrifice of
[1:21:03] praise it is a Thanksgiving or a thanks
[1:21:07] offering it's the word that is used for
[1:21:10] bringing an offering to the Lord not to
[1:21:13] cover sin not to cover a trespass not to
[1:21:18] ask for something or to gain favor for
[1:21:21] something you're going to need it's just
[1:21:23] a simple offering that you bring to the
[1:21:26] Lord that says I've got something to
[1:21:28] thank you for Lord like the old
[1:21:31] songwriter said Lord I didn't come here
[1:21:33] to ask you for
[1:21:35] anything I just come to talk to you I
[1:21:38] just come to thank you for all the other
[1:21:41] times you have come to my
[1:21:43] rescue in modern Hebrew you might find
[1:21:47] it interesting that that the that the
[1:21:49] word that's used for in modern Hebrew
[1:21:51] for turkey
[1:21:53] is from it's very similar to the root of
[1:21:56] the word that we're looking at now toada
[1:21:59] for Thanksgiving and so they believe
[1:22:02] that in modern Hebrew someone has drawn
[1:22:04] the connection so that you would
[1:22:06] remember uh uh the turkey at
[1:22:09] Thanksgiving and by the way it's very
[1:22:11] hard to get a turkey in Israel for
[1:22:13] Thanksgiving if you don't believe that I
[1:22:16] can tell you how expensive it almost
[1:22:20] $200 but we had one
[1:22:23] a fresh one we had to learn what to do
[1:22:26] with it it didn't come like the like
[1:22:29] they usually come but we made the best
[1:22:31] Thanksgiving we've ever had in Israel
[1:22:35] and we had some wonderful memories that
[1:22:37] are attached to that but Thanksgiving is
[1:22:40] not a
[1:22:42] day it's not a day it's an
[1:22:45] attitude it's an attitude that we in
[1:22:48] fact if you'll if you'll go on it says
[1:22:51] thanks is the speaking of the of the
[1:22:54] Excellence of a person or object this is
[1:22:57] all from the Hebrew with the focus on
[1:23:01] what does that say personal
[1:23:05] gratitude you you you can't just be
[1:23:08] corporately
[1:23:09] thankful this is an expression that
[1:23:11] comes from the innermost being it is an
[1:23:15] attitude of Thanksgiving an attitude of
[1:23:19] thanking God for his promise for
[1:23:25] deliverance are you cheaters reading the
[1:23:28] rest even while
[1:23:32] still you you mean you mean toada in
[1:23:36] Hebrew means all that yes every bit of
[1:23:38] this is from the Hebrew it it's an
[1:23:41] attitude of thanking God for his promise
[1:23:44] for deliverance even when you need
[1:23:47] Deliverance even when you've not seen
[1:23:50] the reality of the Deliverance that you
[1:23:52] you're pressing in for in fact
[1:23:58] before before it happens I'm going to
[1:24:02] give God an
[1:24:04] offering that says thank you Papa thank
[1:24:07] you ABA because you've done it before
[1:24:11] and if you've done it before I have no
[1:24:14] reason to think that you won't do it
[1:24:16] again and again and again and again and
[1:24:22] again again yeah so the simple word
[1:24:24] translated in English Thanksgiving to
[1:24:28] means all of that and it actually means
[1:24:32] about a half a paragraph more than that
[1:24:34] but I thought we would stop there in
[1:24:37] Psalm 50 if you'll go there with me or
[1:24:41] or wait for it to be on the
[1:24:42] screen offer unto God
[1:24:48] Thanksgiving and pay thy vows
[1:24:52] unto the most high this is one of about
[1:24:56] a dozen
[1:24:57] references that combines the word toada
[1:25:02] with paying a vow with fulfilling a
[1:25:05] promise a man is no better than his
[1:25:08] word sometimes in life we make
[1:25:12] obligations and we forget them because
[1:25:14] we're human surely we can show Grace for
[1:25:17] one another has anybody ever forgotten
[1:25:20] something that you said you would do and
[1:25:21] you just didn't do it but it wasn't
[1:25:23] because you wanted to be ridiculous it's
[1:25:25] because you just forgot you just failed
[1:25:28] to keep your in fact I've learned if I
[1:25:30] don't do it right
[1:25:32] away if it's one of those things that
[1:25:34] you can't do right away I'm in
[1:25:36] trouble a and that's why I went on and
[1:25:39] said you better Zach you better make
[1:25:41] your announcement now because even
[1:25:43] though it's written here as I've proven
[1:25:46] week after week just because I write it
[1:25:48] down don't mean I'm going to look at it
[1:25:49] to read it a a and so we want to be sure
[1:25:55] that as we enter in to a a season of
[1:25:59] Walking In
[1:26:01] Thanksgiving that we are preparing our
[1:26:04] offerings our I don't mean finances but
[1:26:08] but it's good because we've learned that
[1:26:10] giving is the key to coming out of
[1:26:12] poverty we've learned that we've learned
[1:26:15] that one of the ways we get out of the
[1:26:16] mess is to give our way out not complain
[1:26:20] our way out but to give our way out out
[1:26:22] we've learned the laws of seed time and
[1:26:25] harvest come on now and we've learned
[1:26:28] that we don't we don't round it uh
[1:26:31] down right we round it up somebody said
[1:26:35] do you have scripture for that I
[1:26:37] absolutely do the Bible said and the fat
[1:26:41] thereof go back and make sure you get a
[1:26:43] healthy scoop of fat when you lay your
[1:26:47] piece of meat on the altar that's what
[1:26:49] the scripture said make sure that you
[1:26:52] you're not doing it to the penny to
[1:26:55] begrudge God what belongs to him but
[1:26:58] Heap him up on Heap him up just a little
[1:27:01] bit you know all the Charities ask you
[1:27:04] to round it up don't they I see that I
[1:27:06] see the you you go to get a hamburger
[1:27:08] and they want to know where you round up
[1:27:10] your bill to help some charity out you
[1:27:12] ought to try rounding it up for him you
[1:27:16] ought to say Lord anyway I said it
[1:27:17] wasn't about it wasn't about giving it's
[1:27:20] about giving
[1:27:23] not necessarily from the wallet but
[1:27:26] preparing an offering of Thanksgiving to
[1:27:29] the Lord because he's always
[1:27:32] worthy and then he said offer unto God
[1:27:36] Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the
[1:27:39] most high and I may you may not have
[1:27:42] picked up 15 you did and call upon me in
[1:27:46] the day of trouble I will deliver thee
[1:27:50] and thou shalt glorify me me I want to
[1:27:53] make sure you see the the context of
[1:27:55] that offer unto God
[1:27:58] Thanksgiving an offering of thanks in
[1:28:03] advance and then pay thy vows to the
[1:28:06] most high and call upon me in the day of
[1:28:11] trouble I will deliver thee and thou
[1:28:15] shalt
[1:28:16] glorify me Thanksgiving launches us into
[1:28:22] to a level of wholeness that we
[1:28:25] desperately need in the body of Christ
[1:28:28] we become fragmented by our broken
[1:28:32] relationships we become damaged by the
[1:28:35] things that we have walked through alone
[1:28:37] in life and there is one thing that will
[1:28:40] restore us to wholeness quicker than
[1:28:43] anything else and that's learning to
[1:28:45] walk in a spirit in an attitude of
[1:28:49] Thanksgiving to the Lord I don't just
[1:28:51] mean Church we're a church that learns
[1:28:54] the value of praising when you get here
[1:28:57] but I mean when you wake up on Monday
[1:29:00] morning and you just get up thankful
[1:29:03] because you're a king's kid I just want
[1:29:05] to thank you that I'm a child of the
[1:29:09] king I just want to thank you that you
[1:29:12] have brought me a mighty long way
[1:29:15] instead of focusing on how far left we
[1:29:18] have to go we ought to focus on how far
[1:29:20] God has brought us
[1:29:22] and that if he can bring us this far
[1:29:25] guess what he'll
[1:29:26] do come on he'll carry us the rest of
[1:29:30] the way that uh uh then then down verse
[1:29:34] 23 of Psalm 50 I want to go to the other
[1:29:38] place that toah is
[1:29:40] used who so offereth praise glorify me
[1:29:47] and to him that
[1:29:52] ation a right will I show the
[1:29:57] salvation of
[1:29:59] God where is the word
[1:30:06] toada remember toada means
[1:30:10] Thanksgiving you don't see the word
[1:30:12] Thanksgiving in English appear in vers
[1:30:15] but the word TOA is there where is it
[1:30:18] it's
[1:30:19] praise there are several Hebrew words
[1:30:22] that are translated praise there are two
[1:30:24] Hebrew words that are translated
[1:30:27] Thanksgiving and sometime TOA which is
[1:30:31] usually translated Thanksgiving is also
[1:30:34] translated as praise who so offer
[1:30:38] Thanksgiving or a praise offering
[1:30:42] glorify me and to him that
[1:30:46] ereth his
[1:30:48] conversation a right will I sh show the
[1:30:52] salvation of God lord would you put a
[1:30:55] watch over my heart help me now help me
[1:30:59] now put a watch over my heart and to
[1:31:03] stay on my
[1:31:05] lips Lord put a lock on my
[1:31:09] lips squeeze my cheeks when I run off
[1:31:12] too much at the mouth come on the
[1:31:15] psalmist is saying if you will order
[1:31:18] your
[1:31:19] conversation if you will not allow allow
[1:31:22] your mouth to
[1:31:24] overload the rest of you if you will
[1:31:27] choose your words wisely and offer God
[1:31:31] praise that's do his name while choosing
[1:31:34] your words in life words that edify
[1:31:38] words that glorify not words that that
[1:31:41] murmur and complain and belly ache help
[1:31:45] me
[1:31:45] now so both of these verses Psalm 504
[1:31:50] and 15 and psalm
[1:31:52] 5023 use the word toada emphasizing as a
[1:31:57] sacrifice and the sacrifice is what you
[1:32:01] are offering ahead of time it's not the
[1:32:04] kind of sacrifice that you commit a
[1:32:07] transgression and you bring an offering
[1:32:10] to cover what's already done it's a
[1:32:13] Thanksgiving offering and in a
[1:32:15] Thanksgiving offering you are offering
[1:32:17] God Advance praise you're offering God

[1:38:15] murmurer hello your reputation will
[1:38:19] precede you when you're a praiser
[1:38:22] you're going to be one or the other
[1:38:24] you're either going to be a complainer
[1:38:26] or you're going to be a praiser I

[1:38:48] choose to live My Week with a praise
[1:38:55] some people are
[1:38:56] complainers and some are praisers and
[1:39:00] the real question
[1:39:02] is which one are
[1:39:11] you complainers or
[1:39:18] worriers thankful people are praisers
[1:39:27] Warriors are the first to
[1:39:30] complain they're always looking for

[1:40:03] blessings of the Lord and focus on
[1:40:05] things that are not going my way or am I
[1:40:08] constantly watching for the loving care
[1:40:10] of God in my life looking and searching
[1:40:13] for another opportunity to express some
[1:40:16] praise and some gratitude and I don't
[1:40:18] mean praise the Lord as some some
[1:40:21] punctuation to a sentence that doesn't
[1:40:23] mean anything praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:40:25] praise the Lord thank you Jesus praise
[1:40:26] the Lord hallelujah you know brother I
[1:40:28] was thank you Lord you know brother the
[1:40:30] other day praise the Lord I'm not
[1:40:31] talking about punctuating a sentence
[1:40:33] when you can't make a good sentence
[1:40:35] that's not what I'm talking about but
[1:40:36] I'm talking about setting your
[1:40:39] heart there's a dial on your heart and
[1:40:42] I'm talking about dialing in to
[1:40:44] Thanksgiving it's the solution for grief
[1:40:47] it'll deal with the spirit of heaviness
[1:40:49] in your life Thanksgiving will deal with
[1:40:52] a complaining spirit in your life hello
[1:40:55] come on Thanksgiving will cause you to
[1:40:57] look
[1:40:58] inward instead of outward it'll cause
[1:41:02] you to say Lord what must I do that I
[1:41:04] can
[1:41:05] maintain I want to maintain this kind of
[1:41:08] Praise I want you to see what the
[1:41:11] Apostle Paul says about the end time are
[1:41:13] you still with me second Timothy chapter
[1:41:16] 3 this is my
[1:41:19] translation and
[1:41:21] uh I have uh chosen some words using
[1:41:25] different different references here and
[1:41:28] I have put them in parentheses like
[1:41:30] you'll see in the Amplified Bible
[1:41:32] sometime so let's follow this through
[1:41:34] this know also that in the last days
[1:41:38] perilous times shall come Fierce
[1:41:42] Times Hard
[1:41:45] Times difficult times you better prepare
[1:41:48] yourself that's right yes yes we're
[1:41:53] living in days of
[1:41:55] Plenty but we we may not always have
[1:41:58] days of Plenty so we need to prepare
[1:42:01] ourselves we need to prepare our
[1:42:03] children for difficult days that may
[1:42:06] possibly come before the bride is
[1:42:08] raptured out of here and the Apostle is
[1:42:11] saying this know that in the last days
[1:42:13] perilous Fierce hard difficult times
[1:42:16] shall come for men shall be lovers of
[1:42:20] their own
[1:42:22] selves me me me me me me me me me me me
[1:42:26] I I I I
[1:42:28] I I've had it so hard come
[1:42:32] on
[1:42:34] Covetous lovers of money boasters self-
[1:42:38] exalted bragger on proud arrogant
[1:42:43] self-important
[1:42:46] hoty blasphemers defaming demeaning
[1:42:51] disobedient to parents I didn't think we
[1:42:54] needed to break that
[1:42:56] down I figure everybody in the house
[1:42:59] knows what it means to be
[1:43:02] disobedient as long as you're depending
[1:43:04] on your parents you ought to obey your
[1:43:07] parents and when you're no longer
[1:43:09] depending on them when they're right you
[1:43:11] ought to obey them anyhow
[1:43:15] hello
[1:43:17] unthankful
[1:43:19] ungrateful
[1:43:22] Unholy I like the way this Bears out
[1:43:26] Unholy it's opposing what is Holy it's
[1:43:30] not just the lack of
[1:43:32] Holiness it it's positioning yourself
[1:43:36] against
[1:43:46] Holiness
[1:43:49] h
[1:43:54] opposing what is
[1:43:56] sacred having no
[1:43:59] reverence without natural affection
[1:44:03] hard-hearted
[1:44:05] unfeeling without regard for others see
[1:44:09] that natural affection is often
[1:44:11] translated as something sexual but the
[1:44:13] root of that word is not coming out of
[1:44:15] something sexual it's coming out of
[1:44:17] someone who doesn't feel who has become
[1:44:20] know numb who lives in numbness without
[1:44:23] regard for
[1:44:25] others now that very spirit is what
[1:44:28] turns people into an alternative Spirit
[1:44:30] that's what turns into a homosexual or
[1:44:32] perverted Spirit it comes from being
[1:44:36] unfeeling and hard-hearted and selfish
[1:44:39] and without regard for others it comes
[1:44:42] from a spirit of Pride we know that from
[1:44:45] the word truce Breakers
[1:44:49] irreconcilable
[1:44:51] false accusers slanderous incontinent
[1:44:55] which means without
[1:44:57] self-control driven by appetites and
[1:45:00] passions
[1:45:01] Fierce
[1:45:03] Savage
[1:45:05] brutal despisers of those that are
[1:45:10] good
[1:45:11] traitors
[1:45:13] betrayers
[1:45:15] hey now look what he means rash Reckless
[1:45:23] it's going to be real quiet
[1:45:25] now
[1:45:27] Thoughtless and let's all on the count
[1:45:29] of three read the next one would you see
[1:45:31] if you see yourself yeah one two three
[1:45:37] headstrong you don't lead your way with
[1:45:40] your
[1:45:41] head you lead your way with your
[1:45:45] faith somebody said follow your heart
[1:45:49] wrong yes not follow your heart your
[1:45:53] heart can deceive
[1:45:55] you your emotions can fool you your
[1:45:59] thoughts can lead you astray your faith
[1:46:02] is what you
[1:46:03] follow come on now not headstrong
[1:46:08] leading with your head thoughtless rash
[1:46:14] Reckless forcing others to tiptoe around
[1:46:19] you
[1:46:20] High minded
[1:46:23] conceited puffed
[1:46:28] up having no
[1:46:33] sense
[1:46:35] senseless not even being aware of what
[1:46:38] you're putting
[1:46:40] off no sense of what vibe or what
[1:46:44] message you're sending as you stomp
[1:46:47] around lovers of pleasures
[1:46:51] more than lovers of God
[1:46:54] hello come on
[1:46:56] church compromis is the Trojan Horse of
[1:46:59] the word
[1:47:01] church having a form of
[1:47:04] godliness holding to a structure of
[1:47:10] piety but denying the power
[1:47:14] thereof from such turn away let me tell
[1:47:18] you something hypocrisy is the greatest
[1:47:21] offense to the Living
[1:47:25] God
[1:47:27] hypocrisy to know to do good and not do
[1:47:31] it to confess to live right and not live
[1:47:35] it is the greatest offense in the face
[1:47:39] of a holy God so having a form of
[1:47:42] godliness well I go to church every two
[1:47:44] every Sunday every Tuesday I pay my
[1:47:47] tithe you know I know I'm okay I'm doing
[1:47:50] what God would have me to do while
[1:47:51] totally ignoring the fact that you're
[1:47:54] leading with your head and you're
[1:47:57] conceited and puffed up and loving
[1:47:59] Pleasures more than God so having a form
[1:48:02] of godliness is not enough because if
[1:48:05] you're denying the power thereof the
[1:48:07] word of God says get away from those
[1:48:09] kind of
[1:48:10] people didn't say take them to
[1:48:15] dinner invite him to the
[1:48:17] party it said get away from folks like
[1:48:20] that until you walk around the altar
[1:48:23] washing your hands in innocency until
[1:48:26] you get everything made just right with
[1:48:28] the Lord be careful how you how you
[1:48:30] flock with with Geese of the same kind
[1:48:32] of nature as the one you've got now
[1:48:35] there there's some ugly things here in
[1:48:37] these
[1:48:38] verses ugly
[1:48:41] perverse horrible things but you know
[1:48:44] one of the things that shocks me the
[1:48:46] most is that Paul is warning Timothy
[1:48:50] that in the last days dark Spirits
[1:48:53] coming into the world would cause
[1:48:56] trouble for the
[1:48:59] church for for
[1:49:03] some it might be a bit
[1:49:05] surprising for me it is that tucked in
[1:49:09] here among such hideous and destructive
[1:49:12] Spirits is a warning that there would be
[1:49:15] a swarm of unthankful people that would
[1:49:19] fill the church Church in the end
[1:49:22] time not just traitors heady high-minded
[1:49:25] incontinent lovers of God lovers of
[1:49:28] pleasure more than of God but that there
[1:49:30] would be a
[1:49:31] swarm of unthankful people and the
[1:49:34] Apostle is placing it in the same order
[1:49:37] of these other fleshy
[1:49:39] sins to be
[1:49:41] unthankful to walk in in
[1:49:44] gratitude as an end time bride people we
[1:49:47] are facing many awful and ugly attitudes
[1:49:50] udes the least of which is not
[1:49:52] ingratitude ingratitude is defined as a
[1:49:55] lack of proper appreciation or thanks
[1:49:58] for something or
[1:50:02] somebody the dictionary defines being
[1:50:05] unappreciative as not fully
[1:50:08] understanding recognizing or placing the
[1:50:11] proper value on
[1:50:14] something we have a tendency not to
[1:50:16] Value something until we lose it that's
[1:50:19] not how Believers are to operate one may
[1:50:23] never expect that being unthankful would
[1:50:25] make it to such a hateful and dark list
[1:50:28] or that it would be deserving of the
[1:50:31] same harsh judgment as the other
[1:50:33] negative attributes in the Apostle
[1:50:35] Paul's warning but nonetheless being
[1:50:38] ungrateful unthankful is not here by
[1:50:41] mistake we're living in a very
[1:50:44] unthankful ungrateful generation come on
[1:50:48] it's being unthankful really such a bad
[1:50:51] thing we don't know for sure if these
[1:50:54] troubling issues are listed in order of
[1:50:57] importance but we can feel safe that the
[1:51:00] Apostle listed them as the spirit of
[1:51:03] Truth brought them to his mind so it may
[1:51:08] in fact be important to note that in
[1:51:10] verse two being unthankful is mentioned
[1:51:12] before being
[1:51:18] Unholy I got my knee
[1:51:21] covered but I take everything in life
[1:51:24] for granted
[1:51:26] hello I got my hair do
[1:51:29] right I'm holy
[1:51:32] enough but I'm not showing enough
[1:51:36] gratitude to God and to
[1:51:39] others come on now I didn't mean to get
[1:51:45] so so if a lack of Holiness remember
[1:51:48] what Hebrews 12:14
[1:51:53] says follow
[1:51:56] peace with all men and
[1:52:00] Holiness without
[1:52:02] which no man shall see the Lord so if a
[1:52:08] lack of Holiness would keep someone from
[1:52:10] seeing the Lord what do you think the
[1:52:13] result of being unthankful would
[1:52:15] be don't forget we're being warned in
[1:52:18] verse 5 to turn away from these kinds of
[1:52:21] people to purposely avoid associating
[1:52:26] with those who are under the influence
[1:52:29] of these dangerous attitudes and Spirits
[1:52:31] are you hearing me today
[1:52:34] Church it must be important if the
[1:52:37] Apostle is telling us pull away from
[1:52:39] people like
[1:52:42] that people who blame everybody
[1:52:45] else for their
[1:52:48] problems but we we cannot take the moral
[1:52:51] high road and avoid others until we
[1:52:53] examine our own hearts for any traces of
[1:52:57] these attacks against the end time
[1:52:58] people so the Apostle is indicating that
[1:53:02] one of the things the enemy will use
[1:53:04] against the people of God in the end
[1:53:05] time is a is an attitude of being
[1:53:09] unthankful or not having proper
[1:53:12] gratitude 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 15-18
[1:53:18] see that none render evil for evil unto
[1:53:21] any man but ever follow that which is
[1:53:24] good both among
[1:53:27] yourselves and to what and to all men
[1:53:30] Rejoice ever
[1:53:32] more pray without
[1:53:35] ceasing in
[1:53:38] everything not for in in
[1:53:43] everything help me give
[1:53:47] thanks in every
[1:53:50] everything give
[1:53:53] thanks I was left
[1:53:55] out in
[1:54:01] everything I deserve the
[1:54:03] raise that he got
[1:54:06] in
[1:54:10] everything I can't hardly make my car
[1:54:13] payment and she's rolling up with a new
[1:54:16] one
[1:54:18] in
[1:54:23] everything I can't buy school clothes
[1:54:26] for my children and yet that sister
[1:54:29] comes in here with a yet another new
[1:54:33] dress
[1:54:35] in
[1:54:37] everything first of all something you
[1:54:39] need to understand it's your
[1:54:43] responsibility to clothe your
[1:54:45] children if you're going to have them
[1:54:48] hello so you get that set up inside you
[1:54:52] get that fixed then you won't be looking
[1:54:54] to other people when God blesses you
[1:54:56] from the you'll say woo thank God for
[1:54:58] that amen praise the Lord I sure
[1:54:59] appreciate that but you won't be
[1:55:01] expecting it from
[1:55:03] others come on now in everything in
[1:55:08] everything in everything when the when
[1:55:11] the when the shower leaks in
[1:55:14] everything I got a leaky faucet I can't
[1:55:17] fix I do I'm telling you the truth I got
[1:55:19] a leaky faucet I can't fix it's filling
[1:55:22] up my sepy tank and I'm going to have to
[1:55:23] have it I'm going to have to have it
[1:55:25] pumped again but I just decided in
[1:55:30] everything I'm going to give God thanks
[1:55:33] it's a way to get things taken care of
[1:55:36] in everything give thanks for this is
[1:55:40] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:55:44] concerning you it's always the will of
[1:55:47] God for you and I to give God thanks
[1:55:51] it's always the will of God for you and
[1:55:54] I to live in Thanksgiving yes
[1:55:58] amen I believe that we are really living
[1:56:01] in an
[1:56:02] hour that we're not seeing
[1:56:06] breakthroughs in certain areas of
[1:56:10] prayer and when I recognize that that
[1:56:13] may be my case or it might be something
[1:56:17] prevailing in the body I begin to wonder
[1:56:20] what kinds of things can hinder my
[1:56:24] prayers what kinds of things can keep me
[1:56:28] from seeing the Breakthrough and the
[1:56:30] Overflow in certain areas of my life and
[1:56:34] if I were you this morning I would hear
[1:56:36] my pastor and I would search my heart
[1:56:39] and I would discover whether or not I am
[1:56:42] showing God the right amount of
[1:56:44] Thanksgiving now remember I'm not just
[1:56:46] talking about your church
[1:56:48] praise that's right I want you to know
[1:56:51] that that is you folks do good I I'm so
[1:56:55] thankful for you but I want you to know
[1:56:58] that's not when you're being the
[1:56:59] greatest test is is coming to you when
[1:57:02] you're in here the greatest test is when
[1:57:05] you get out there in everything give
[1:57:08] thanks in everything well I'm tired of
[1:57:11] renting I know what that feels like I
[1:57:14] rented a good good portion of my life I
[1:57:17] know what that feels like but I want to
[1:57:19] thank God for a place to sleep with a
[1:57:22] roof over my head come on and a bed to
[1:57:25] sleep in in everything give thanks in in
[1:57:29] the Amplified Bible uh first
[1:57:32] Thessalonians 5:18 the verse we just
[1:57:34] read says thank God in everything no
[1:57:38] matter what the circumstances may be be
[1:57:42] thankful and give thanks that pretty
[1:57:44] well covers it all for this is the will
[1:57:46] of God for you who are in Christ
[1:57:51] Jesus the revealer and the
[1:57:55] mediator of that
[1:57:58] will regardless of what Circle you're in
[1:58:02] not everyone appreciates what you do for
[1:58:04] them no matter how hard you try to
[1:58:07] please some people they're never going
[1:58:09] to completely appreciate what has been
[1:58:12] done for them or at the least
[1:58:14] acknowledge the effort you have put into
[1:58:16] something that they benefit from so if
[1:58:20] you're waiting on
[1:58:22] thanks you'll lose your
[1:58:24] blessing while you
[1:58:27] wait if you're waiting on the
[1:58:31] apology you'll lose your blessing while
[1:58:34] you wait so you just Praise Him you just
[1:58:37] thank him you just give him when you see
[1:58:40] people aren't very thankful and
[1:58:42] appreciative and even take advantage
[1:58:44] have you ever been taken advantage
[1:58:47] of it don't feel good
[1:58:51] hello you got to praise Him
[1:58:53] Anyway you've got to thank him
[1:58:56] anyway amen there are some people in the
[1:58:58] world and even in the church who are
[1:59:01] just simply unthankful
[1:59:06] people I've heard people pray for their
[1:59:09] food and say for these gifts we ask you
[1:59:11] to make us truly
[1:59:18] thankful that's a
[1:59:23] mouthful what are you saying when you
[1:59:25] ask such a prayer as that make me
[1:59:29] thankful the only way I know for you to
[1:59:32] be made thankful is to do
[1:59:36] without are you really asking God to
[1:59:38] help you do without so you'll start
[1:59:41] appreciating what he gives you I don't
[1:59:43] think so I believe being thankful is
[1:59:46] something you ought to be able to cook
[1:59:47] up on your own hello
[1:59:51] Lord help me you could say Lord help me
[1:59:52] to always be thankful but I don't think
[1:59:55] I'd pray make me thankful cuz the cow
[1:59:58] might dry up and quit giving milk so
[2:00:01] you'll be thankful for the milk you used
[2:00:03] to get hello no no no we can just set
[2:00:07] our our
[2:00:09] attitude on one of gratitude an attitude
[2:00:12] of gratitude and say Lord if it were not
[2:00:16] for you had it not been for you your
[2:00:20] hand oh you brought me such a mighty
[2:00:23] Long
[2:00:25] Way being thankful is not a natural
[2:00:28] state of mind for most people being
[2:00:31] thankful often comes from experiencing
[2:00:36] want being thankful for what you have
[2:00:39] often comes from remembering what you
[2:00:41] did not have a woman can be thankful now
[2:00:44] listen to this a woman can be thankful
[2:00:47] for the husband that she had has if she
[2:00:50] can understand what it means to not have
[2:00:52] a good
[2:01:02] husband I don't mean you get to or three
[2:01:05] choices and chances and then you pick
[2:01:07] from the best of your
[2:01:09] experiences I mean look
[2:01:13] around let me tell you how amazing your
[2:01:16] husband will
[2:01:17] look if if you start looking around the
[2:01:20] world around you even the church around
[2:01:22] you that's right oh some people don't
[2:01:25] have it real good in
[2:01:27] here believe I'll take a
[2:01:34] little you better be glad that God
[2:01:37] doesn't have as generous of a return
[2:01:40] policy as as some Walmarts and stores
[2:01:42] like that
[2:01:47] do a man will be thankful for the job he
[2:01:51] has when he's gone through a long period
[2:01:53] of time where he had no
[2:01:56] job or work tirelessly on a job that did
[2:01:59] not satisfy his
[2:02:02] needs I don't mind when I ask somebody
[2:02:04] how their job is and they say it's a job
[2:02:07] I don't mind that that doesn't offend
[2:02:11] me because I have learned that liking
[2:02:14] what you do is
[2:02:16] helpful but it's not necessary in
[2:02:19] providing for your
[2:02:20] family in other words you don't have to
[2:02:23] like it you just got to be thankful you
[2:02:24] got it you show God enough gratitude and
[2:02:28] thanks for the situation that you find
[2:02:31] yourself in now and you do it I mean go
[2:02:33] way out in your praise just just
[2:02:36] really pour it
[2:02:38] on and see if God can't turn that
[2:02:42] around being broke flat busted broke on
[2:02:49] I don't mean what some people say is
[2:02:53] broke broke because your allowance run
[2:02:56] out but you know where to find some more
[2:03:00] right I don't mean broke but you could
[2:03:03] draw from your savings account right I
[2:03:06] mean flat busted
[2:03:10] broke nothing no cushion no Dave Ramsey
[2:03:16] cushion emergency fund
[2:03:21] let me tell you about that emergency
[2:03:23] fund you touch it it's
[2:03:24] gone you put it back in place you'll
[2:03:27] need it
[2:03:28] again don't put that up thinking it's a
[2:03:30] savings account cuz the washer is going
[2:03:33] to break down and the dryer's going to
[2:03:35] break down come on and the lawnmower is
[2:03:37] going to break down
[2:03:39] hello it's life it's
[2:03:44] life I'm just thankful we don't have to
[2:03:47] chip ice and go down down to the to the
[2:03:49] ice
[2:03:51] house build a little little uh you know
[2:03:55] shed over the stream and put the ice in
[2:03:57] that and pack it in sawdust and oh Lord
[2:04:01] thank you thank you thank you that I
[2:04:03] don't have to draw water my my my
[2:04:05] faucets may be leaky but oh thank God
[2:04:08] they run I turn them on and the water
[2:04:10] comes and I don't have to haul the
[2:04:13] hello being broke teaches you how to be
[2:04:16] thankful for what you already have being
[2:04:19] sick can teach you how to be thankful
[2:04:20] for pain-free days staring death in the
[2:04:24] face can teach you how to be thankful
[2:04:25] for each and every day with those you
[2:04:28] love being lonely can teach you how to
[2:04:30] be thankful for someone who goes out of
[2:04:32] their way to be your
[2:04:34] friend thankful people are usually
[2:04:37] people who have been down the road of
[2:04:38] adversity they are people who know what
[2:04:41] it means to struggle there are people
[2:04:43] who have not had the world handed to
[2:04:45] them on a silver platter they work hard
[2:04:47] to get where they're at
[2:04:49] I'm talking about thankful people they
[2:04:52] worked hard to get where they're at they
[2:04:54] endured much expense and labor to reach
[2:04:56] a certain place in life they did all
[2:04:58] they could and when that failed they
[2:05:00] prayed to Jesus before the help came so
[2:05:02] they know that they know that they know
[2:05:06] where their help has come from so it's
[2:05:09] just a it's just a natural overflow to
[2:05:12] give him
[2:05:17] praise my grand
[2:05:20] almost always drove a new
[2:05:22] car she worked very
[2:05:25] hard she didn't make enough leading a
[2:05:29] church but she had a good job as a as a
[2:05:32] tax
[2:05:34] preparer somewhat of an
[2:05:38] accountant when she died she had a
[2:05:40] little something to leave behind because
[2:05:43] she worked
[2:05:44] hard it vexed my
[2:05:46] grandfather he worked as a uh he worked
[2:05:49] as a uh contracted help at uh Postman a
[2:05:53] contracted postman on post a civilian
[2:05:57] job but on Fort Benning it was a good
[2:06:01] job it made him enough money to do what
[2:06:04] he wanted to
[2:06:05] do bought him a lot of fishing poles and
[2:06:09] a lot of saws and a tractor ever now and
[2:06:14] again and just about anything he wanted
[2:06:17] but if he needed a new vehicle
[2:06:19] he he wasn't going to be able to afford
[2:06:20] that with his he would have had to stop
[2:06:21] buying boats
[2:06:24] and hand tools
[2:06:27] and when it come time to buy a new
[2:06:30] vehicle it was my grandmother that
[2:06:31] bought the vehicle and put him in a
[2:06:34] truck and you'd think that your wife
[2:06:37] working like that and giving you a a a a
[2:06:40] new truck to drive would would cause you
[2:06:42] not to want to Grumble and complain all
[2:06:44] the time but my granny would say uh
[2:06:47] honey I've got to leave early today for
[2:06:49] church because I got to go pick up
[2:06:50] sister so and so and sister so and so
[2:06:52] and brothers I got to go pick up them on
[2:06:54] my way to church they don't have a way
[2:06:56] to get to church and he would get so mad
[2:07:00] sister Flo knows what I'm talking about
[2:07:02] he would get so mad you're going to run
[2:07:05] that car in the
[2:07:09] ground not because she drove it to
[2:07:12] church the biggest portion of the miles
[2:07:15] but because she dared go by and pick up
[2:07:18] somebody else that didn't have that was
[2:07:19] going to destroy the vehicle you see
[2:07:22] what kind of spirit some people carry
[2:07:24] ungrateful Spirit he's driving a brand
[2:07:27] new Ford truck top of the line and he's
[2:07:31] worried about her automobile that she's
[2:07:34] going to run in the ground taking sister
[2:07:36] so and so to church and you know what I
[2:07:40] would hear her say honey don't worry
[2:07:42] about it it'll be all right I don't
[2:07:44] worry about it God will take care of us
[2:07:46] and I thought one of these days one of
[2:07:48] these days one of these days she is
[2:07:50] going to remind
[2:07:52] him I I I I really wished for the day
[2:07:56] that she would tell him and when I wear
[2:07:58] mine out told them folks to church I'm
[2:08:00] going to take
[2:08:02] yours the one I bought you and I'm going
[2:08:05] to wear it out taking people to church
[2:08:07] but one day she'd had all she could take
[2:08:10] and she never threw that truck up in his
[2:08:13] face but here's what she said she said
[2:08:15] now don't say another word to me
[2:08:19] about my vehicle wearing out to toing
[2:08:21] people to church God is the one who gave
[2:08:25] me that vehicle and if I wear it out for
[2:08:28] him he'll give me another
[2:08:31] one and I'll wear that one out for him
[2:08:35] but I'm telling you don't say another
[2:08:38] word to me about
[2:08:40] it and from that moment on every two
[2:08:44] years like
[2:08:46] clockwork before she ever pull pulled
[2:08:48] one out of warranty she went back
[2:08:51] down so a few weeks before she died she
[2:08:55] went down and bought a brand new Lincoln
[2:08:57] town car and I sure did en enjoy driving
[2:09:01] that one for
[2:09:03] years she said I won't get to enjoy it
[2:09:07] but she said just to show the devil now
[2:09:09] my grandfather was gone but just to show
[2:09:13] the devil she said I'm going to change
[2:09:15] I'm adding it to the wheel I'm putting
[2:09:17] it right at the top of the wheel and I'm
[2:09:19] going to say because I
[2:09:22] know that Steve will wear it out for
[2:09:27] Jesus I want him to have it because
[2:09:31] he'll wear that one out and even though
[2:09:33] Big Mama's not around God will give him
[2:09:35] another one to wear out doing the work
[2:09:38] of the Lord come on it's your
[2:09:42] attitude it he had an attitude to where
[2:09:45] he just couldn't see
[2:09:48] the goodness of God in his life and it
[2:09:52] left him so
[2:09:54] bitter such a wonderful man such a
[2:09:58] precious man in so many ways but he
[2:10:01] would not he could not come to that
[2:10:05] place of just saying lord it's because
[2:10:08] of
[2:10:09] you if it were not for you Lord had you
[2:10:13] not been such a good God come
[2:10:17] on
[2:10:21] the Bible sets unthankful people apart
[2:10:23] from thankful people to be unthankful is
[2:10:26] a Grievious attribute of sin when
[2:10:29] someone does something for you the
[2:10:31] response of your heart and your lips
[2:10:34] should
[2:10:37] be it's so
[2:10:39] cheap it costs so
[2:10:42] little to say to somebody thank
[2:10:46] you we get so
[2:10:49] busy it's so so easy to
[2:10:56] forget thank you for your
[2:11:01] prayers thank you for your
[2:11:04] faithfulness that's why I got on there
[2:11:09] on the on the chat on the app I just was
[2:11:12] so
[2:11:14] blessed by the fact that the pain was
[2:11:16] almost completely gone the next morning
[2:11:19] after two days of of really serious pain
[2:11:23] and I knew that I hadn't
[2:11:26] healed you know naturally I knew that
[2:11:29] the pain wasn't gone because the body
[2:11:32] had had just healed itself the thing had
[2:11:34] run its course it had gotten better I
[2:11:37] knew that somebody had touched the Lord
[2:11:41] and I wanted to say thank you I want to
[2:11:44] be a thankful hearted person don't you
[2:11:48] whether it's God or your next door
[2:11:50] neighbor or someone in the church or
[2:11:53] even a complete stranger brother Shaw he
[2:11:56] took brother Jim and Pastor Ryan
[2:12:00] Jasper to brunch one day while they were
[2:12:05] here Monday I believe it
[2:12:07] was they went to after looking around
[2:12:11] for it a bit they went to
[2:12:15] IHOP in
[2:12:16] Columbus they had a meal and both
[2:12:19] brother Shaw told me and Pastor Ryan
[2:12:22] told me and they were
[2:12:25] sharing he said he Pastor Ryan Jasper
[2:12:29] didn't feel like they had been
[2:12:30] particularly loud I know brother Shaw
[2:12:33] can get pretty excited because I saw him
[2:12:36] on YouTube this week and I know that he
[2:12:39] can stand for the word when he has to he
[2:12:42] was greatly challenged I didn't know
[2:12:43] this even happened he was greatly
[2:12:46] challenged on the street and he let let
[2:12:48] me just tell you he stood up to the
[2:12:50] challenge he was told he was going to
[2:12:52] hell because he believed in one God
[2:12:55] brother I'd rather take that
[2:12:59] chance I'd rather take that chance than
[2:13:02] any chance I
[2:13:04] know and he stood up now I know he can
[2:13:07] get a little loud but Pastor Ryan said
[2:13:09] he didn't feel like they were
[2:13:10] particularly loud they were just sharing
[2:13:12] constantly the whole time they were
[2:13:14] there just sharing the goodness of God
[2:13:17] and there was a man and his wife a
[2:13:19] couple sitting were they Caucasian was
[2:13:21] it an African-American couple I thought
[2:13:23] that's what he told me an
[2:13:24] African-American couple sitting over
[2:13:26] there somewhere having their breakfast
[2:13:29] at the same time and when the three men
[2:13:31] went up to pay the
[2:13:32] bill it had been paid for
[2:13:37] Glory you say well that what was that a
[2:13:39] a $35 meal or $3 or $20 meal oh my my my
[2:13:46] my every one of those men could could
[2:13:48] have could have somehow paid for their
[2:13:50] food it wasn't it wasn't the fact that
[2:13:52] they couldn't do it it was the fact that
[2:13:56] they were honoring God and God put it on
[2:13:59] somebody's heart to be I want to be the
[2:14:02] one I want to be like that little
[2:14:04] couple I want to that's how I want to be
[2:14:07] I want to be like that little couple
[2:14:10] sensitive to the voice of the Holy
[2:14:13] Spirit and
[2:14:15] left they couldn't even thank him
[2:14:19] they didn't even know their name so
[2:14:21] guess who got the
[2:14:23] thanks Lord thank you that you did that
[2:14:25] for us see I I I'm telling you it really
[2:14:29] really makes a difference when someone
[2:14:31] gives you something that belongs to them
[2:14:35] time th this is the one thing I I really
[2:14:39] struggle with
[2:14:42] sometime is how people
[2:14:45] devalue time
[2:14:50] if someone gives you their
[2:14:53] time they're giving you one of the most
[2:14:55] valuable things they
[2:14:57] possess their
[2:15:00] time I I feel like I don't mean to
[2:15:03] complain I want to be a praiser I feel
[2:15:05] like sometimes people don't value other
[2:15:08] people's
[2:15:10] time
[2:15:13] mine sometimes I feel that way I try not
[2:15:17] to let it get down in my
[2:15:19] heart what I try to let it do is remind
[2:15:22] me that that if somebody is
[2:15:25] choosing to give me a little bit of
[2:15:27] their time I I want to be thankful for
[2:15:30] that I I want to I do I want to I want
[2:15:33] them to know I appreciate that I think
[2:15:37] that it is a good thing for us to do if
[2:15:39] someone's giving you time or money or
[2:15:42] prayer
[2:15:43] love I think our heart ought to be quick
[2:15:46] to respond I'm I'm
[2:15:49] thankful thank you what really bothers
[2:15:52] me is I think sometime when when people
[2:15:56] think that you've got a lot or you have
[2:16:00] a lot of something time for instance or
[2:16:03] money or
[2:16:05] whatever and they do something for you I
[2:16:08] think sometime people Express their
[2:16:11] gratitude in a little less of a way
[2:16:14] because they're they're judging your
[2:16:16] they're estimating your ability to do I
[2:16:19] don't think it ought to be that
[2:16:23] way I don't think it ought to be that
[2:16:26] way I I think if I've got a a a a pantry
[2:16:30] full of canned goods 300 jars of green
[2:16:35] beans and I give you a couple
[2:16:38] jars I think that you ought to show or
[2:16:41] whoever gives them to you I think we
[2:16:42] ought to show the same thankful
[2:16:46] grateful because because it's something
[2:16:48] we didn't have it's something that
[2:16:50] somebody took of theirs and shared it
[2:16:52] with
[2:16:55] us there are certain people sometime
[2:16:58] will recommend a product to me that has
[2:17:01] helped them in different ways and some
[2:17:04] people will send you a
[2:17:06] link some people will deliver it to your
[2:17:11] doorstep some people will bring you a
[2:17:15] sample
[2:17:16] pack they'll literally take from what
[2:17:19] they
[2:17:20] have so that you can try the
[2:17:24] flavors so that you don't buy a flavor
[2:17:27] of something that you don't
[2:17:30] like that says
[2:17:32] something about who we are help me
[2:17:37] now oh
[2:17:39] yes praise
[2:17:43] God I'm all
[2:17:46] right we should give thanks to the Lord
[2:17:50] first Ephesians 5:20 giving thanks
[2:17:53] always for all
[2:17:56] things unto God and the father in the
[2:17:59] name of our Lord Jesus Christ everything
[2:18:02] every good day every pay raise even a
[2:18:07] quarter every good doctor
[2:18:11] report every help every encouragement
[2:18:13] every big every little thing that
[2:18:15] encourages and blesses our life we
[2:18:17] should show our thanks to God without
[2:18:20] thankfulness we're almost assuredly we
[2:18:22] will almost assuredly hinder the working
[2:18:24] of the holy spirit in our life Psalm and
[2:18:28] verse4 we read enter into his gates with
[2:18:30] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[2:18:32] praise be thankful unto him and bless
[2:18:35] his name we understand that being
[2:18:37] thankful to God will always lead us into
[2:18:39] higher
[2:18:40] praise it does Thanksgiving leads us
[2:18:44] into higher praise Thanksgiving and
[2:18:46] praise go hand hand in hand praise is a
[2:18:50] physical expression for being thankful
[2:18:53] for who the Lord is and for what he is
[2:18:55] doing in our lives we use our voices we
[2:18:58] use the posture of our bodies to praise
[2:19:01] the Lord because our heart is thankful
[2:19:04] Thanksgiving in the heart of a Believer
[2:19:06] is Never Satisfied to remain locked in
[2:19:08] it will always find an audible physical
[2:19:12] way to express itself in Praise hello
[2:19:18] I want to read another portion of
[2:19:19] scripture to you before we
[2:19:21] close I want you to go to Luke 17 with
[2:19:24] me for just a
[2:19:26] moment verses
[2:19:30] 11-9 and it came to pass as he went to
[2:19:34] Jerusalem that he passed through the
[2:19:36] midst of Samaria and
[2:19:39] Galilee if you're watching the news
[2:19:41] that's the West
[2:19:43] Bank as he entered into a certain
[2:19:45] Village there met him 10 men that were
[2:19:48] lepers which stood AAR off and they
[2:19:52] lifted up their voices and said Jesus
[2:19:54] Master have mercy on us and when he saw
[2:19:58] them he said unto them go show thyselves
[2:20:01] show yourselves under the priest and it
[2:20:05] came to pass as they went never anointed
[2:20:09] them never prayed over
[2:20:14] them he just said go get cleared
[2:20:18] go show yourselves under the priest and
[2:20:20] it came to pass that as they went
[2:20:23] what they were cleansed and one of
[2:20:28] them
[2:20:29] [Music]
[2:20:31] 10% one of them when he saw that he was
[2:20:35] heill turn
[2:20:37] back and with a what L and with a loud
[2:20:41] voice you think the Bible just put that
[2:20:42] in there for fun no it wanted to
[2:20:45] describe to you this man's gratitude
[2:20:48] Hallelujah he was thankful his life just
[2:20:52] changed he could go home to his wife he
[2:20:55] could go home to his children he could
[2:20:58] walk up and down the street without
[2:20:59] crying unclean unclean unclean he could
[2:21:02] put his regular road back on he could go
[2:21:06] right up and worship among other
[2:21:08] worshippers he didn't have to go into
[2:21:10] certain little room set aside for those
[2:21:12] of
[2:21:13] leprosy when he saw he was healed he
[2:21:15] turned back and with a loud voice he
[2:21:17] glorified God and fell down on his fa
[2:21:21] face at his feet giving him thanks and
[2:21:25] he was a Samaritan he wasn't even a Jew
[2:21:29] right he was a Samaritan and Jesus
[2:21:32] answering said were there not 10
[2:21:38] cleansed but where are the
[2:21:41] nine there are not found that return to
[2:21:45] give glory to God save this
[2:21:48] stranger and he said unto him
[2:21:50] arise go thy
[2:21:53] way thy
[2:21:56] faith hath made thee
[2:21:58] whole what an amazing Miracle what an
[2:22:01] amazing testimony leprosy in Bible times
[2:22:04] was a terrible thing we're not exactly
[2:22:06] sure what it looked like while it may
[2:22:09] have described what is known as Hansen's
[2:22:11] Disease the word probably included other
[2:22:14] skin diseases as well once a person and
[2:22:17] caught it it was considered incurable
[2:22:20] and those diagnosed with Leprosy were
[2:22:22] banned from society Leviticus 1345 and
[2:22:26] 46 tells us the person with such an
[2:22:28] infectious disease must wear torn
[2:22:31] clothes let his hair be uncamp cover the
[2:22:34] lower part of his face and cry out
[2:22:37] unclean unclean as long as he has the
[2:22:39] infection he remains unclean he must
[2:22:42] live alone he must live outside the camp
[2:22:44] while early Israelites didn't operate on
[2:22:47] the The Germ theory of disease they
[2:22:49] understood something about infectious
[2:22:51] diseases and those suspected of leprosy
[2:22:53] were kept isolated until their diagnosis
[2:22:56] was confirmed but the loathing directed
[2:23:00] all
[2:23:01] lepers directed at all lepers was not
[2:23:03] merely a fear of a
[2:23:05] disease leprosy made a person ritually
[2:23:08] unclean to touch a leper defiled a Jew
[2:23:12] almost as much as touching a dead person
[2:23:14] in a sense leprosy was a sign of God's
[2:23:16] dis favor and it was treated that way
[2:23:20] later Jewish practice prescribed that
[2:23:23] while lepers might attend the synagogue
[2:23:25] they must be first to enter and last to
[2:23:27] leave they must stay in a special
[2:23:29] compartment to isolate them from the
[2:23:31] other worshippers no less than a
[2:23:33] distance of six feet must be kept from
[2:23:35] any leper to the rabbis The Cure of a
[2:23:38] leper was as difficult as raising a
[2:23:39] person from the dead the word cleansed
[2:23:42] here in verse 17 means to heal a person
[2:23:45] of a disease that Mak makes one
[2:23:47] ceremonially unclean to make him clean
[2:23:50] to heal him especially of leprosy it was
[2:23:54] more than a healing but it was also a
[2:23:56] cleansing verse 14 is the key to
[2:23:59] understanding what happened and as they
[2:24:01] went they were
[2:24:03] cleansed the Greek construction uses the
[2:24:06] preposition in in remember brother
[2:24:09] brandom talking about in morphe it
[2:24:12] literally means in the
[2:24:15] going they were
[2:24:17] cleansed there came a point as they
[2:24:20] began to obey Jesus that their healing
[2:24:22] took place all of a sudden he said go
[2:24:25] show yourselves even though we talk
[2:24:27] about someone who believes belief
[2:24:29] doesn't exist in a vacuum faith is
[2:24:33] exhibited in what we actually do because
[2:24:36] these lepers believe they begin to obey
[2:24:39] and go to the village where the priest
[2:24:40] live as Jesus brother James says in the
[2:24:43] same way Faith by itself if it is not
[2:24:47] accompanied by action is dead can you
[2:24:50] imagine the social stigma that these 10
[2:24:53] men faced every day of their life they
[2:24:54] were unable to be around their families
[2:24:56] they had to watch their children grow
[2:24:58] from a distance they lived in colonies
[2:25:00] with other lepos people they were
[2:25:02] surrounded every day with the sickness
[2:25:03] of others and the stench of their own
[2:25:06] Rotting Flesh so these 10 men cry out to
[2:25:09] Jesus for their healing and he heal them
[2:25:12] as they were going but only
[2:25:15] one with was truly thankful and one of
[2:25:19] them when he saw that he was healed
[2:25:22] while the other nine went on their way
[2:25:24] there this one falls on his face at the
[2:25:26] feet of Jesus and cries out with a loud
[2:25:29] voice of Thanksgiving glorifying God
[2:25:32] Jesus noticed a distinction between this
[2:25:34] man and the other nine he said weren't
[2:25:38] weren't there 10 all of you together
[2:25:40] where about the other nine 10 were
[2:25:42] cleansed but only one is thankful what
[2:25:44] happened to the other nine only 10 % of
[2:25:47] those cleansed that day were thankful
[2:25:49] thank God for the few that come back to
[2:25:51] say Thank You Look what Jesus did for
[2:25:54] the thankful man that he didn't do for
[2:25:56] the other nine men who scurried off in a
[2:25:58] hurry to go about their lives in verse
[2:26:01] 19 he said unto him
[2:26:04] arise go thy
[2:26:07] way thy faith hath made thee whole this
[2:26:11] man was expressing thankfulness but
[2:26:14] Jesus accounted it to him for faith
[2:26:20] Faith makes us
[2:26:23] thankful when we are thankful God sees
[2:26:28] Faith people all the time I need more
[2:26:31] faith maybe what we really need is I
[2:26:35] need to be more
[2:26:37] thankful the phrase made you well or
[2:26:40] made thee whole is the Greek word
[2:26:44] Soo it's the same word translated to
[2:26:47] save or salvation a Suter in Greek is a
[2:26:52] savior a deliverer and the noun form of
[2:26:55] sotia is used widely of Salvation Soo is
[2:27:00] the con in the context means to preserve
[2:27:03] or rescue from natural dangers and
[2:27:06] afflictions to save to keep from harm to
[2:27:09] preserve to rescue to keep safe or free
[2:27:14] from disease this passage h at the fact
[2:27:17] that Jesus offers this leper more than
[2:27:20] the others they received healing but
[2:27:24] this leper received deeper
[2:27:28] salvation his faith had prompted him to
[2:27:31] return to the feet of Jesus and thanks
[2:27:33] and that personal contact that personal
[2:27:35] submission signifies a soul
[2:27:40] healing a
[2:27:42] wholeness something taking place on the
[2:27:45] inside
[2:27:47] that's more than Skin
[2:27:49] Deep Thanksgiving launches us into
[2:27:54] Holiness just a few more minutes as many
[2:27:57] of you know leprosy causes the flesh to
[2:27:59] die off on its victim's body literally
[2:28:02] fingers and toes and other extremities
[2:28:05] fall off as well they lose the ability
[2:28:08] to feel pain which causes them to do
[2:28:10] great harm to their bodies without even
[2:28:12] knowing it most of the time there is a
[2:28:15] difference between being healed of
[2:28:16] leprosy and being made whole as the
[2:28:19] thankful man was many Bible scholars
[2:28:22] believe that the original nine men went
[2:28:25] away healed of leprosy but still
[2:28:27] carrying the scars of their sickness and
[2:28:30] its Devastation to their bodies in other
[2:28:33] words nerve
[2:28:36] damage on the other hand the thankful
[2:28:38] man left that day not only healed of the
[2:28:42] terrible disease but what the Bible say
[2:28:44] also made
[2:28:48] whole in other words the Lord restored
[2:28:50] to him what the sickness had stolen from
[2:28:53] him this could mean even more than the
[2:28:55] body being restored to its original
[2:28:57] state but also his relationship with
[2:29:00] other people like his family and even
[2:29:02] his place of status within the community
[2:29:05] however you look at it Jesus did
[2:29:07] something more for the thankful man than
[2:29:09] he did for the unth thanful
[2:29:11] men here is why our worship is so
[2:29:14] important it is showing our thankfulness
[2:29:16] for his love for us and what he has done
[2:29:18] in our lives it brings into our lives
[2:29:21] that rearward the Bible talks about that
[2:29:25] extra blessing the added bonus the thing
[2:29:27] that not everybody else gets why don't
[2:29:30] you think about what you have to be
[2:29:31] thankful for today why not make a list
[2:29:34] of things that God has brought you
[2:29:36] through and tell him one more time thank
[2:29:39] you there is power in
[2:29:43] Brokenness the power to be made whole
[2:29:46] amen the power of being made whole is in
[2:29:49] finding an identity beyond your
[2:29:53] Brokenness hear me please it's not
[2:29:56] something Christ can exclusively do for
[2:29:58] you it is a process he participates in
[2:30:02] and provides for but you are the key you
[2:30:06] must choose to be thankful even in the
[2:30:09] hottest battle please listen musicians
[2:30:13] are coming even in the hottest batt
[2:30:17] battle and in the most violent of
[2:30:20] storms stay
[2:30:24] connected to
[2:30:26] Jesus don't turn him
[2:30:31] loose Don't
[2:30:33] Unplug from him or from your brothers
[2:30:37] and sisters if you do you will
[2:30:45] unravel we connect to Christ by
[2:30:49] connecting to his
[2:30:54] children our former Amish

[2:31:24] context he said well I'd rather him hold
[2:31:27] on to
[2:31:29] me I understand the
[2:31:36] concept Jesus never turns you
[2:31:41] loose but you're not merely blessed
[2:31:44] because he's holding on to you
[2:31:47] you're blessed when you can in spite of
[2:31:52] everything hold on to
[2:31:54] him your connection to him is through
[2:31:59] faith and faith is rooted in
