up in the we hours of early morning I always try to keep I'm not trying to make myself anything but I just want to be sensitive to the Lord yes we do and these things came to me and I know you know

you must not grow weary in the midst of the battle but be you strong in who I am and who I am in you yes you must be clothed in my full armor examine each piece and make sure you are fully clothed you

from Romans chapter 13. David Shirley is that you we're so glad that you're here God bless you [Applause] maybe you don't know it but Matthew drost and David Shirley were classmates to Nathan in Southern Union College some years ago and they have remained friends and we just believe the Lord has purpose in all of these things before we look to the word I would like to give you a piece of good news a payment of seventy five hundred dollars was made to the mortgage of this property and that brings the balance to 147 323.86 isn't the Lord good Hallelujah [Applause] when you start with nearly half a million 147 000 sounds real good we're Believing by the end of this year God give us Grace to get rid of it have a mortgage burning amen Romans chapter 13 starting in verse 8. we're certainly glad to have you in the house of the Lord all of you that are watching this service by way of the stream we welcome you uh perhaps some of you out there are not aware that we do not stream our services on Tuesday night via Facebook and YouTube is that correct we only stream on Tuesday night with the app and with the website all right so um there's a possibility of some changes on things and so we just want you to be able to get to us so if you don't have the New Hope app it is available for you that you can stream every service Romans Chapter 13 Verse 8 no oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not kill Thou shalt not steal thou shall not bear false witness thou shall not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill in to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cut off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantedness not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof let us pray before you're seated please Our Father how great you are and how thankful we are that you would invite us into your presence we want to thank you that you abide in us and we're thankful Lord to be gathered together corporately with your people now as we look to the word we're asking that you would hide the vessel and that you would speak to us today Words of Life words of help to us that will help us in this journey called life we pray God that you would give us the grace to put aside every distraction and every disturbance and that we would be able to focus our eyes on the word of God and pay attention to what you want to say to us Lord I realize in the preaching of the word different people receive different things and so God I ask you as we open up our lives to you today that you will take the word as you will and deliver it to the hearts of the people get honor and glory Lord again we pray for our pastor use him abundantly Lord for the purposes of the Kingdom while he is in Tucson and bring him back to him and sister Stacy back to us safely all of these other needs we again commit them to you we know God that you are well able to take care of all of them we give you ourselves now use us according to your purposes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen may the Lord bless you as you are seated today as I think about the Bible and we tend to read the King James version around here most of the time and lately I've been noticing that there are words in the King James that we don't use in everyday life uh verse 13 is namely a couple of them chambering and wantonness and right off of the top of my head that I don't have the Strong's definitions to give you but uh it it boils down to what verse 14 says put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh uh rioting and drunkenness and chambering and wantonness and strife and envying all of these are things that we give we allow to happen in our life because of the lusts of the flesh they are things that we allow into our life but that is uh really not the uh subject that I have today I would like to look at verse 10 uh love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law in the previous verses uh it's it's written for us that thou shalt not commit adultery well that brings back to memory that this is one of the The Ten Commandments that we uh lump into what we call the Ten Commandments that you can go back to I believe Exodus 21 and you can find where that they're all laid out but here uh the writer says thou shall not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill thou shall not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet now if you notice every one of these Commandments are the way that we interact with one another with our fellow human beings when we uh would commit adultery we know that adultery is when folks are married and they go outside of the confines of marriage and they find them someone else with whom to have a relationship with uh this is breaking up a marriage this is this is uh uh the the breaking down of love between a husband and a wife this is uh between human beings when we look at the one Thou shalt not kill uh really this should read thou shall not murder again if this is between this is on the horizontal level between human beings where that mankind his heart gets filled up with evil and he gets to a Breaking Point and some people Punch walls and some people pick up guns some people pick up rocks as Cain did to his brother Abel others pick up knives swords some kind of an instrument baseball bats hammers all of these are instruments when people get outside of their head when they get so full of Rage when they get so full of evil when they get so angry because that things have come into their life and then there they don't know what else to do and the rage boils over and they then want to take it out on someone else because when we live in the flesh we are always looking for someone else to blame for our troubles when we live in the flesh we don't like taking responsibility for the place that we're at the attitudes that we have the rage that we have inside the anger the malice the Envy the covetousness the lust we don't want to blame ourselves for the predicaments that we have put our own selves in we want to find someone else to blame but as we come closer to the coming of the Lord and as the holy spirit is requiring more out of us we will not be permitted to blame other people for our condition won't be able to blame the preacher we won't be able to blame the song leader won't be able to blame our husband our wife our girlfriend our boyfriend we won't be able to do any of that because it is all going to be our responsibility can't regulate what comes to you but you can control what comes back out of you so all of these things that is being listed here on the on the horizontal it is our interaction with one another with a humankind in in the Bible is telling us that uh law loving one another is fulfilling the law because when we have love in our lives and when we are truly loving one another we're not going to have a desire to break up marriages when we are loving one another we are not going to have a desire to murder including murdering someone's influence we're not going to have a desire to steal including stealing from God we're going to want to give everything that belongs to him and a whole lot more when we were truly in love with the Lord Jesus Christ and loving one another as we should we are going to find ourselves being givers more than takers when we talk about finances tithings and offerings and these kinds of things God has spoken to us in the older Covenant about one-tenth and and we give our tithe unto the Lord and we think how are we going to make it on that 90 percent but as we fall in love more and more and more with the Lord Jesus Christ and we find ways to be givers givers givers givers God is also a giver and he's going to find ways to give and give and give and give and you're going to find out that it's easy to live on 90 percent and you're going to want to give more and more and more and more until that you are so totally blessed by by receiving and giving because it's who God is and it's who you will become just giving unto the Lord everything but because that we live in this life our problem right now happens to be selfishness we are trying to preserve self and this is because that we are trying to maintain a a relationship with the Lord while still trying to have all of these things around us and living in the realm of the flesh more than we're living in the realm of the spirit and so we find ourselves still hanging on to our selfish attitude and not really allowing the Lord to love through us and that is they even see these things that are listed here these Commandments it boils down to selfishness adultery selfishness pleasing self murder pleasing self because something didn't go your way whether it be to physically murder someone or to murder someone's influence why would you murder someone's influence why would you try to kill somebody's influence now there there are times where that we have to separate our children from another's influence because we as parents with the Holy Ghost maybe our children don't have the Holy Ghost and it is God uses parents as the tutor for the children until that they receive the Holy Ghost tutor into their lives and we have to guide them we have to protect them we have to be one who says yes I am going to protect you from an outside influence and I want to cut that influence off because I see the end of that influence it is not a Godly influence but if there is a Godly influence in someone's life why would we try to cut that off why would we try to kill that are we afraid that someone else is going to have more influence in helping somebody to get a little farther in their walk with the Lord than we have and so we're jealous of that and we're envious of that and so we end up cutting off that influence killing that influence we need to think about these things but their selfishness because we're trying to preserve self because we're trying to build up self the the stealing part again this is this is self-preservation when we steal something that doesn't belong to us we're trying to preserve ourself whether it be stealing a pack of bubble gum whether it be stealing from our boss stealing from the Lord thou shall not bear false witness you ever think about tattlers gossipers people who are trying to preserve their own self-image and so they are good at telling a story in such a way that it makes them look good and makes somebody else look bad self-preservation so all of these things are combined as we interact with one another these are self-preservation mechanisms that we have try to protect ourselves to get through this world but what the Holy Ghost wants us to be so full of himself till that we're not trying to preserve anything but him till the word becomes so full in us until that we do not try to preserve our image we do not try to preserve anything about us except for that we live as close to the Lord Jesus Christ as we possibly can because when we are loving our neighbor as ourself when we are loving our fellow believer as ourselves when we're loving those out there that have all kinds of problems and they have all kinds of phobias and they have trying to take on all kinds of things to help them to get through another day of life and it makes them look so weird makes them act strange makes them do crazy things yet we as a as a Christian believer as a holy ghost believer we would have the ability to love someone else as we do ourselves there is a way and God grant us all of the ability to do it there is a way to truly love someone with an alternative lifestyle without putting our blessing on their alternative lifestyle because the Bible tells us it's an abomination and we do not want to be found blessing something that God has already cursed but that does not keep us from being kind so all of these things that we're seeing here the Bible tells us that they're all gathered together in one love your neighbor as yourself would you turn with me to Galatians chapter 5. Galatians chapter 5 and verse 6. for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little 11 11th at the whole lump I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will be none otherwise-minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be and I Brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution then is the offense of the Cross ceased I would they were even cut off which trouble you for Brethren you've been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another don't use your Liberty as an occasion to revert back to fleshly actions but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in this one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself now I am not going to have you turn there but I am going to read off a list that you would find in First Corinthians chapter 13 some of these came from the KJV some of them came from the new American Standards some of them came from the Amplified I was trying to get words that were more words that we use in our common language today so I'm going to read this list off of what love or love is not love is patient love is kind love is not jealous love does not brag love is not arrogant or rude love does not act unbecomingly love does not seek its own way love is not provoked love does not take into account a wrong suffered love does not rejoice in unrighteousness you know all those off-colored jokes might be told love rejoices in or with the truth love bears up under anything and everything that comes love is ever ready to believe the best of every person love hopes are faithless or Love's hope is faithless under every circumstance love endures without weakening and love never fails it never Fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end so this list here some of them uh are what love is and some of them are what love is not this is all found in First Corinthians chapter 13 come to be known as the love chapter where the the word that's used in the King James is charity and we use the word love love is patient and kind and all of these things this list are things that demonstrate what love is so that we know how to interact with one another with mankind as we are traveling through this life because because all of the law is fulfilled when you are loving your neighbor as yourself now as a human I like to pamper myself as you do all of us have our preferences of what we would call pampering some like it quite chilly in their homes and in the church some like it quite warm and because that we are human and we love our comforts our pampering we have tendency to say sometimes what we would prefer and sometimes when we voice our preference it goes beyond the voicing of our preference and becomes derogatory or maybe even to the point of a demand because we want to be comfortable because we tend to be selfish yet the fulfilling of the law is summed up in one phrase Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I like it cold brother but what do you prefer I Like It Hot sister what do you prefer now I could get in a whole lot of trouble messing with the thermostats in this building but I would like to remind you as the congregation that we should prefer whoever is doing the work now I can throw a statement out and say you can fuss with your wife and your children at home about the thermostat of how you would like it hot or cold yet when we find ourselves preferring one another or our opinions of things will become less and less and less we're preferring one another we're trying by the grace of God to fulfill the law of God by recognizing that all of the law is fulfilled love your neighbor as yourself now this great big list of of uh things that we get from First Corinthians chapter 13 all of it boils down into first John chapter 4. first John Chapter 4 verses 7 through 10. sorry Mariah didn't give that one to you beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins I wrote for yeah chapter 4 first John 4 verses 7 through 10. now what I want you to get out of this is that we God is love and what we are striving toward is so much of Jesus Christ inside of us that we have the same nature as he does he does and his nature is and was that before you ever got here before your parents ever got here and generations before them even though that he knew that you and I were going to trespass against him because he is love he already had a Redemption plan in mind so that you could experience the kindness and the generosity and the patience and the non-jecy and all of these things that we've put in a picture here concerning what love is before you ever got here before you ever made your first mess before you ever had your first trespass before you ever did anything against someone else God already had a propitiation a a Redemption plan in his mind to be able to cover you he already had a plan in his mind to forgive you before that you ever were able to tell your first lie he already had it in his mind that he was going to forgive you before you ever did anything that would go against his word he already had a thought in his mind of a way that he was going to blot it out and not hold it against you and that was through the the the gift of the sacrifice of Calvary when the Lord Jesus Christ God come in the flesh it was by that that he already forgave you he made a way do you know that you can't even pray effectively if you don't forgive Matthew chapter 6. after this manner pray ye therefore Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in Earth as it is in heaven this is what we're trying daily to do by the grace of God to get in the spirit and Ascend into Heavenly places and bring the plans of Heaven into the Earth as it is in heaven let it be on the Earth give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors now I'd like to ask a question of us if we only forgave our debtors or let me let me rephrase that if God only forgave us as much as we forgive our debtors if God only forgave us as much as we forgive our debtors what would still be hanging on us measure for measure someone trespasses against us and we hold something in our heart against them and we don't forgive them we're hindering our prayers number one but I'm asking the question if we give this equation where that God only forgives us measure by measure as we forgive others how much is still hanging on us well that's not the way he works we already know that because he has already forgiven us before we made the first mess he already forgave us because by his foreknowledge because he's all-knowing he could predestinate us give us a prefixed Destiny to eternal life and because he knew all of the things that we would ever do but he knew that one day we would call on his name and we would repent and we would come clean before him he would forgive us all of those debts before we ever got here now he wants us to ask of course he wants us to uh recognize that we have trespassed he wants us to recognize that we we've just been a jerk he wants us to recognize that we've been unkind that we've been jealous he wants us to recognize these things and come to him in Repentance and say father forgive me I have I have done evil against you and against your word and against my fellow man and I ask you to forgive me and sometimes it requires going to a fellow man and saying I'm sorry I'm sorry but if God hung on to everything we hang on to how much would still be dangled before us man you talk about the devil being able to use something to beat you over the head with but the devil has nothing to hang over your head when you come clean before the Lord and you forgive even as he forgave there is therefore now no condemnation to them that walk after the spirit we can be so clean and we can forgive so genuinely until that the power of the Living God operates through us and the love of Jesus Christ goes to other and we're giving kindness and appreciation and we're not allowing jealousy to take a hold of us and we're not allowing all of these things to so get in US now we can go back to Galatians where that it says that Faith Works by love and the Amplified I broke it down a little bit farther than the Amplified but the Amplified says faith is activated by love faith is energized by love faith is expressed by love and faith is working by love and when you look at it this way that that our faith that we have we ask the Lord to increase our faith and we can go to the Book of Luke and we can talk about how that faith is based on forgiveness and we forgive one another for what they trespass against us and so uh again this is this horizontal between mankind where that we are forgiving one another and we're honoring one another and we're expressing uh our love our kindness to one another and so then our faith is activated by love just take a moment I don't want you to dwell a long time on it but just take a moment to think about a season in your life when you are angry with someone and you held something in your heart maybe you never have I have but you held something in your heart against someone how active was your faith there was something that was hindering and it was unforgiveness so these things are uh they're they're hindering to us now what I want to get back to is where I was on Tuesday night concerning the capping of the of the pyramid because when we look at the scripture I believe it's in second Peter where this scripture is taken from second Peter chapter one again I did not give them this passage of scripture a verse for whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye may be partakers of the divine nature let's turn that word partakers around and say you might take part of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue now our experience with the Lord starts of course with faith we have been given a Measure of Faith sometimes The Measure of Faith doesn't seem very small but again Faith Works by love and because that the Holy Spirit shed his love on you to even open your eyes to recognize that you were a sinner your faith could be activated to say yes I am a sinner and I want to become clean because I see that the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed at Calvary was for my sin it was to clean it to purify it to annihilate it to put it away and never to be remembered against me anymore because his love came to me my faith could be activated but our love for one another can cause Faith to be activated in us to be able to go to a higher level so then it says add to your faith after you've called on the Lord then you want to add to your faith virtue now if you you go back to the message the stature of a perfect man brother Branham took this word Virtue back to when Jesus was touched by the woman with the issue of blood where that virtue went out of her now I would like to further say that the word when virtue went out of Jesus the word in the Greek was dunamis power and strength that is not the word used here in second Peter the word used here as virtue is moral goodness or high moral standard virtue either way I'm not trying to take away from someone else's preaching I just am how I'm trying to get us to have understanding that this we're building this all of the law is fulfilled the way you treat your neighbor love your neighbor as yourself so now we have moral goodness or high moral standard then we have knowledge which is gnosis or the understanding of the lawful or the unlawful we come to Temperance which is self-control we're still working on this one honestly we're still working on all of them because my faith is not where I want my faith to be my moral standard I'm still working on it because of the pressing in every day of the moral standard of the world I have to constantly be on guard of my own moral standard because what the enemy wants to do is tear down your morals and as time goes by what the enemy does is he distorts things and he makes you think that well this is 2023 this is not 1970. that's not so bad and so we have to constantly be on guard with our moral standard and taking it back to the word of God to make sure that we are fully cooperating with the word of God with whatever we do with our understanding of what is lawful and what is not lawful and they're trying to press laws in on us to make us again distort or disa to change our views on what is lawful according to the word of God now man has the ability because he is under the influence of demonic spirits to give laws of the land that directly defy the law of God and as we come closer to the end it may be that we have to be like the Chinese believers we're glad there's going to be a necessity along the way that we have to defy the loss of the land because the law of God is the higher law self-control we're working on this because there are always things to come against you one thing or another there may be something that you have self-control over that I don't I may have self-control over something that you don't so we're working as individuals getting self-control of the things that the enemy torments us with bringing him to the Cross every day saying Lord I desire a laid down life love your neighbor as yourself that's a laid down life that's what Jesus came to the Earth for Jesus came to the Earth to demonstrate a laid down life he came to the Earth to demonstrate that he could walk through this Earth and love the neighbor as himself without defiling himself and he could show that all of the fences that the Pharisees had built they built it outside of the confines of what God had spoken and they tried to press some issues and some traditions and he told them that by your tradition you're causing the people to die have spiritual death because they were pushing it outside of the confines of God's word so then here in second Peter chapter one we have after Temperance or self-control we have patience which is a steadfastness a constancy an endurance and what works patience trials tribulations we all have them because God is working something in US tribulations trials fiery trials don't think they're strange because they're all part of this journey then we have godliness reverence respect piety towards God brotherly kindness again love of our brothers our sisters and then this finishes out with Charity or a love the this word means love feast affection good will brotherly love now what is the statement that brother Branham used some many years ago when he talked about they were all branhams they might scrap in the backyard but when they come to the front yard they were going to be a unified family because they were of one blood now we're human beings we all have our preferences we all have our desires we all have things that we like or dislike and it may not be the same as the one that we go to church with and so there are times that we have heated discussions in the backyard but we had better make sure when we come to the front yard to fight the devil that we're standing together so much so that the enemy cannot get one razor blade in between us that he knows that we love one another and that we're a unified Army against all of the Wiles of the devil and we're going to see that he falls those of you that are familiar with the teaching of brother Branham you have no doubt listened to this message the stature of a perfect man and you know how that he talked about this pyramid and and he wrote all of these words in it and then the Capstone that had never come down uh perfect love and he took us to Zechariah Chapter Four Zechariah Chapter 4. I'm making your Works Mariah sorry I didn't give you all of them Zechariah Chapter 4. let's start with verse six then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou o great Mountain before zerubba Bell Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it now what we have come to understand is that we were going to receive extra measures of Grace in order for this Capstone Ministry to set down upon the Bride of Jesus Christ This Love This this ability to love our neighbor as ourself we say we love God but if while we're saying we love God and we hate our brother we've got an issue here God is trying to get us to understand that he wants us to have love one for another because we are all Blood Bought we are all bought by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we are all of One blood we're all a part of the family of God and so he is helping us to understand the necessity for us to have this perfect love come down upon us and so this headstone comes with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it now I want you to notice in verse 7 it's not by might or verse six it's not by now not by might you can't get loved by your sheer willpower because about the time that you think that you're gaining Love by your sheer willpower you'll punch somebody in the face because they'll make you mad so it's not by you'll never gain it by your own might it's not by power no matter what is moving in this what looks like power to us you're not going to gain love by power love is only going to come the headstone I want you to understand that the headstone the capping of this pyramid the capping of this house is only going to come by the spirit of the Lord and the way that that happens is that I daily and most times many times during the day have to lay down my own will because my own will is always trying to come up and out why is my will always trying to come up and out well let's go back to what we've been hearing in previous weeks about eating the book I'm just going to ask us what book am I eating because I think we eat some books and while we're eating them depending on where we're living at while we're eating them they're sweet in the mouth then they become bitter in the belly and they come back up and out let me tell you friends there are some of the books that we eat that when it comes back up and out it's ugly a book of the flesh is going to produce works of the Flesh and words of the flesh we have been instructed to eat a book and that is the Living Word that is sweet in our mouth and it's bitter in the belly but the necessity is that we are going to once again let it come up and out and it's going to be a beautiful thing as we prophesy again to the the to many peoples and Nations and tongues but for the moment God is trying to help us to be careful what we actually eat so we have to get in the spirit have to get in the Holy Spirit people get in spirits all right but we want to get in the Holy Spirit every day of our life get in the Holy Spirit till that the Lord can do his work in us and he can help us to understand the amount of selfishness that we have in our own life and we interact with one another and that selfishness comes I want to say the Lord by his spirit is helping us and it's becoming less and less we're recognizing As We Worship the Lord together and these songs that that Inspire us to go to a higher level and to hear the words of these songs and the word of the Lord that is embedded in those songs that starts have an effect on us so that when the word comes across this desk it can have more effect in us and where then those songs reverberate in our in our minds and uh as as we're going throughout the week and in a phrase like laid down life will start reverberating in our mind and we recognize that's what the Lord wants out of us a laid down life so that we are interacting with one another and we're loving our neighbor as ourself this is the fulfilling of the law and it is really all of this is God building up to the point where that he can allow this Capstone to come down on us not by might not by power but by his spirit so in in so doing God is working in US and it's not going to be a public show what God is doing in you and what he's doing in me is not a public show now it is going to be demonstrated as we go through this time of intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ and he's working on us and working on us and working on us by his Spirit nobody really knows what's going on on the inside of you and there are times you know who God's working on somebody by how irritable they are I can't see what God's doing inside of you but I can tell by how irritable you are that you're having a little struggle you know how I know that been there yet God is working inside of you and inside of me and you can't see what he's doing in me you can't see all that that's going on up here down in here and the Quivers that I you know that that that that that feeling that you get ah you can't see that and I can't see it in you yet I know that God is working because there are changes that are happening it happening in US that are causing us to want more and more and more and yes there may be times that God comes and requires another Peace and you may see me get irritable but don't you worry because I'm called and I'm elected by the will of God I'm going to lay it down it may be a little struggle for me it may be a little struggle for you but we're going to lay it down because we know this is what God is Desiring of us and requiring of us and we desire to please him with everything that's with inside of us so it takes this time of intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ and it requires this going on inside of us the devil he can't see what's happening in your life he sends struggles to you but he don't really know what's happening to you foreign Joseph was a young man and he had these dreams he had these dreams about the stars and the Moon and the Sun then he had dreams about the sheaves and at the moment that he's telling them I have a feeling that he was pretty inspired and his brothers hated him for it and even with the second one is his dad even scolded him and said oh you think now your mom and dad are even going to bow down before you Joseph didn't really understand God had given the dreams but Joseph and his immaturity was not yet ready to have the Fulfillment of the dreams so then God sends Joseph down to check on his brothers and when Joseph was sent down to check on his brothers they saw him coming and they said oh here comes the dreamer let's get rid of him now I don't know what was going through Joseph's mind at that time whether he had maybe the the the the excitement of those dreams maybe some of it had faded I don't know maybe he was holding them in his heart I don't know the Bible doesn't really say but they threw Joseph in a pit and then after a while they sold him and Joseph went down to Egypt as a slave and ended up in Potiphar's house and if his brothers could have said anything about him at that moment could they have got to him they may have ridiculed him and said what about the dreams now foreign you remember that God had a plan in his mind all along Joseph as the human being could not see the whole plan of God and I don't know how tightly he held on to the dream while he was in prison or in Potiphar's house first but he was a prisoner he was a slave how tightly did he hold on to the dreams or did he kind of have a feeling as we do sometime and say I don't see how this is ever going to have a fulfillment I'm a slave now God was working on Joseph and Joseph didn't even know it then God tightens the screw down and lets a Wicked Woman accuse him of wrongdoing you ever wonder if potiphar knew his wife did potiphar know that his wife had some of that Delilah spirit in her I don't know but she was after Joseph lay down with me Joseph come into my room Joseph and Joseph Joseph kept no no no no no your husband has put me over this house and I am not going to trespass against him God was working on Joseph putting him in those predicaments to test him to try him tribulations in his life because God had an end plan Joseph probably couldn't see it at that moment and probably even more shadowed when Joseph was thrown into prison because of a wrongful accusation against him yet God was using those tribulations to prepare Joseph for a higher calling than Joseph knew he was going to have I've pondered this story about Joseph for some months now since this has been called a year of the supernatural for us Joseph went through his life and he's being tested and he's being tried and he's being positioned and tested and tried and positioned and tested and tried and Joseph really didn't even know he was walking out a supernatural happening in his life when he was a slave in Potiphar's house it didn't feel Supernatural when he was when he was a prisoner in the prison house because of a false accusation it didn't feel Supernatural when the Butler and the baker were thrown into prison and had dreams probably the dreams that Joseph had had years earlier when they talked about their own dreams the Butler and the baker that that that whole scenario of Dreams was probably stirred up all over again in Joseph's mind even as he's given interpretations to their dreams and Joseph doesn't realize he's walking out Supernatural when the butler was restored according to the dream and the interpretation thereof when the baker was hung from a tree and the birds ate his flesh as the interpretation of the dream that was Supernatural but Joseph was still in prison because God was not finished with the preparation for Joseph just yet and so now Joseph for two more years even though he told these men when you're restored to your position Butler would you out of kindness tell Pharaoh that I've been wrongfully accused maybe I won't have to stay in this prison any longer but God was not yet through with dealing with Joseph Joseph did not know that something so significant and Supernatural what's about to happen to him because he was in this prison from a wrongful accusation yet it was all the training that God was using for him so that when he came to the place of prominence when he came to the place of power well actually when he came to the right time the right season to where that the pharaoh would have a dream and nobody could interpret the dream and all of the sudden the butler has this memory oh I remember I feel so bad now two years later but even that two extra years was a part of Joseph's training can you imagine after about the first month after you've interpreted these dreams and you say to the butler you're going to be restored to your position you're going to go back to tasting the wine for the king so that you can make sure that you drop dead first if somebody has poisoned it you you're going to be restored to your position and when you're restored to your position would you remember me how many times did Joseph have to say I forgive I forgive I forgive I forgive that Butler that he didn't remember to tell the Pharaoh about me you don't suppose it was all just hunky dory for Joseph when he wasn't remembered do you you don't think he had emotions he did and so after a while two years now all this time Joseph is being worked on I just want you to think about it just for a moment if Joseph had not allowed God to work on him in this course of years and all of the sudden he is called out of the prison and said the Pharaoh wants to see you he's had a dream if he had not allowed the work of the Lord in his life he would have probably had a response about time I told that butler two years ago when I interpreted his dream to remember me and here it is two years later before I finally get called no something had been happening in Joseph now Joseph appears before the Pharaoh the Pharaoh explains these dreams to him and Joseph gives the interpretation thereof and is put in a place of prominence to where that he is second in command only to the Pharaoh of the land and all of that training up through that uh all of his childhood on up into his teenage years to the time of being thrown in the pit and sold by his brothers taken as a slave to Potiphar's house and throw it in prison it was all leading up Supernatural when you're in the pit you can't see the supernatural when you're in the prison you can't see the supernatural I'd just like to encourage you today that whatever it feels like God is the god of Supernatural and he is working something Supernatural for you something Supernatural in your life and and I just want to bring this back to what we were talking about the other night from The Book of Ezekiel because out from the throne ushered this life-giving water and if you remember uh when we read that the other night it talked about this water when it come out from under the doors of the temple and it started flowing and as it as it started gathering together it started out to be ankle deep and then as he waited out it became uh Knee Deep and then going deep and then Waters to swim in and uh I would like to read to you I'm not real good at reading quotes but I would like to read to you from a message uh I only gave you one is that correct would you pull that up and let me read debt this is from a message from that time 1960. these men picked me up and set me up on a great big high place and sent me down he's talking about going beyond the curtain of time and they were praising God none of them kissing me just embracing me and saying brother our precious brother and I looked and people was coming from everywhere and I said what is this and that voice now from no one the same voice that spoke in the room was still with me he said this is perfect love and I've always taught the evidence of the Holy Ghost is perfect love see I believe in speaking in tongue sure but though I speak with tongue in men and angels and have not charity love I am nothing become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol so when you speak with tongues and got love with it that'll show you see he's not doing away with the gift and the love that we would have here would be like starting here from a shadow of the shadow of the Shadow into the Shadow and from the shadow to a Mist now he's talking about how it progresses and that's what I want you to kind of get an idea in the picture in your mind when we were talking on uh Tuesday night about that water that is Flowing it is Flowing this healing river flowing from the Throne of God and it's flowing from the very essence of the love of God and as you step in remember where we're starting really at the bottom with faith and it's it's very shallow it's very small and here he's putting it in different words it's a shadow of a shadow and from the shadow to a mist and to a little moisture and into a creek and into a river and then into an ocean that's where it arrive at there just perfect everything so as this love this the love of God is setting down we've we've got the faith and The Virtue the knowledge and the temperance and the patience and the godliness and brotherly kindness all of these things are being worked in us and again we can't really see what God is doing in us supernaturally but he is really working supernaturally friends the work that is going on in you and in me that God is doing it is not natural it's not by any of your might it's by your yes but it's not by your might because I can utter a yes out of my mouth that has no heart connection but if I can utter a yes to the Lord with a heart connection and say Lord I really desire to serve you with everything that's within me and I desire for there to be a completeness to what you promise what is going on inside of you is Supernatural for you to be able to say yes over and over again think about the natural just a minute because if in the natural somebody comes up to you every day and punches you in the side of the head and you might the first day kind of look at them a little sideways may even have a silly laugh say okay the next day same person comes up pounds you in the side of the head the next day they come and pound you on the side of the head after a while you're going to say enough of that I'm taking a different path I'm going to put somebody around me that'll punch back this is the natural that's the way we react in the natural we'll hit back punch back change paths do something but in the Inner Man there is something Supernatural happening because the devil which is a tool in the hands of God to bring about a perfection in a body of Believers comes to us day after day after day after day and he's the tool in the hands of God because God is Desiring for us to come to a stature of the fullness of Christ and we could react the same way we do in the natural I've had enough of this but yet we have sense enough to know this is of God sounds kind of silly doesn't it this beating is of God this battle is of God pick in the ribs is of God this mind battle is of God and we find ourselves saying yes you haven't got the power inside of you to do that it's a supernatural by the spirit of God that you can say yes Lord I'll lay that down Next Day a different punch yes Lord I see what you're trying to work on I'll lay that down it's all part of God trying to get you till that you can love your neighbor as yourself and in loving your neighbor as yourself it's increasing This Love the love this way is increasing this to him because you are now seeing your neighbor as something more than just a human being you are seeing them as a creation of the Living God the one who created the heavens and the Earth and you're seeing them as a creation that you can allow the love of Jesus Christ to work through you that you can love someone as he loved someone this statement for some people you're the only Jesus that they'll ever see and they're looking for him especially in people that claim to be believers they're looking for him and so God put you on the Earth and he lets Trials come to you just as when Jesus walked the Earth the Trials come to him they're coming to you because your desire is to become like Jesus Christ and he while he walked the Earth the Bible tells us that though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things he suffered musicians you can come please by the things that he suffered he was he was becoming the son that he was destined to be and he allowed you to be on the earth so that you could fulfill the purposes of God in the earth till that you as well could become the son that he ordained for you to be by the things that you suffer you don't have to be like a Catholic you don't have to go find something to do to make yourself suffer don't have to do Penance you don't have to go climb over steps with glass in it or some wild thing to to suffer enough to get good enough for God like to remind you you can't get good enough you can never get good enough for God to accept you he already paid the price and he put the invitation out once he put the invitation out and he said come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest he really wants to give you rest from your labors and he wants you to air get under his yoke because he said his yoke was easy and his burden was light so he wants you to get under his yoke he wants you to recognize that everything that comes your way every trial of life is because he is trying to get you to bring to to have your destiny fulfilled in the Earth what your destiny will look like I don't know I don't know what mine looks like no more than Joseph knew what his would look like all he could see was had some dreams saw sheaves bow and down before me now let's just be human beings if you were 16 or 17 years old and you saw these sheaves bowing down before you probably a little pride would get there I'm gonna be something don't know what that something looks like but somebody Something's Gonna bow down before me and then to have another dream yet we're not fit at that moment and we can scream and cry and jump up and down and say God why did you show this to me if it's going to take years to fulfill yet God come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest get under my yoke take my yoke upon you but Lord what about this and what about this and why am I in prison and why is it so dark and you're not ready yet I'm training I'm training it's all Supernatural it doesn't feel very natural it doesn't feel very Supernatural when you're in a natural prison no more than it did for Peter it didn't feel very Supernatural to be in a prison it felt so natural that the angel had to give him another kick and say get up boy you're living so much in the natural I got to give you another kick to let you know something Supernatural is happening Peter didn't realize that something Supernatural was going on he was in prison but Supernatural was happening so no matter where you're at today not really sure why I've diverted down this road but no matter where you're at today whatever it feels like right now you are in a supernatural Vision you're in a supernatural walk Supernatural is happening there is Supernatural happening in you it feels As Natural As Natural can be when you're fighting them out mind battle but I remind you once again God is doing something Supernatural inside of you that the devil can't get to and distort he can't destroy it he can't distort it he can't get a hold of it he doesn't understand it he only sees the effects of it and the effects are bringing about a love in the body of Christ because we're not remaining in the trickle we're not remaining in the ankle deep We are continuing to move forward In this River that is Flowing from the Throne of God this perfect love we are stepping out further and further into it to allow God to absorb Us in it so that we can interact with one another and it's no more displaying self but it's displaying him Stand Together father I'm asking you to take this word and deliver it as only you can I thank you that you are working in US both to Will and to do of your good pleasure and I'm asking you that you will take the words and put them all together as only you can God you give a peace here and you give a peace there but I thank you Lord for the pool of the people that they would call out to you and that they would receive from you Lord that's what the foolishness of preaching does God you get to the individual how you desire to get it to them so I'm

Believers oh God I ask you that you will touch lives we send your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ prosperity these are things Lord that you promise to those that keep Covenant with you but

standing up together right now as a family for these that are having a harder time right now and we're standing together against the enemy saying back off name of Jesus Christ Lord I am asking these that have yielded their members to the works of the flesh maybe now they're paying a price that they wish they didn't have to pay God May there be a yes a yielded yes to you this day Lord I don't want
