TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] hi I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the eagle cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and tell you that I appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to hear what the Lord has placed on my heart for you today and uh I believe God will speak to you if you'll just open up your heart right now and allow the Holy Spirit to take this word and drive it down into your spirit man and you know what I've noticed is we always start out with a plan we have a subject and a series going but I've watched how so many times the Holy Spirit Will direct my thoughts and take me a little bit off the off of our plan and I believe it's because he's speaking to someone's need specifically you know we've been trained and in uh our ministry to if we have a question if we have something on our heart that we we just present that when we're in church we just present it before the Lord in faith and we've watched the Lord time and time again no matter who is preaching who was doing the teaching we watch the Lord just change the flow of the message and direct the words right to our heart you know God is so good he is so faithful he is mindful of your needs whatever they may be God already knows about them and I just encourage you to present them to him in faith believing that already heard you and you can have exactly what you need from the Lord in fact while we're talking about prayer and faith and the power of God's faithfulness in our lives I'd like to invite you to send us your prayer request all the contact information that you'll need is available on the screen and I would be more than happy to help you pray over your needs it's always a blessing when we hear from someone out there across the nations of the world who have watched the Eagles cry broadcast and been blessed that's why we're here we're not trying to build a Ministry for a man or a kingdom for men but what we're trying to do is just sew something into your life that would make a difference we are truly living in the end time and if we listen to the news around us we could get awful discouraged with the death and the terrorism and destruction that's going on every day it's almost like we go to bed at night we wake up the next morning and we dread connecting to the news because we know that somewhere something awful has happened but I have some good news for you and that is Jesus is Alive and Well oh yes they crucified him that's absolutely right and he shed his blood for my salvation for your salvation but the good news is that is good news but the really good news is he didn't stay dead you know he defied death and won the victory over the grave and uh okay there have been many good men who have lived in the history of the world men who spoke good things and spoke about peace and demonstrated charity and kindness there are other men who are adored and uh lifted up exonerated in other faiths but I want you to know that uh my God is a different story and my savior the Lord Jesus Christ he died all right and paid the price for you and I to be born of the spirit but he didn't stay in that grave on the third day he arose and he lives today he is eternal he's not going anywhere and whatever you have need of he is right there waiting for you to call he's as close to you right now as the mention of his name if you'll just call on him you know my grandmother taught me when I was a very small boy that I would say to her how do we know that the Lord still loves us you know I was a boy I was the product of a divorce I was an only child my mom and dad divorced when I was 5 years old and so I had a lot of insecurities about love love was something I wasn't so sure about and my granny was trying to speak to me on a child's level and she said I tell you what you do you just sit down and begin to say from the depth of your heart I love you Lord I love you Lord I love you Lord with all my heart I love you and I want to serve you and she said you just keep saying that and listening very very still and very very close and she said I can almost guarantee that before you finish you're going to at least feel in your spirit or hear in your inner being the Lord saying I love you too and that may sound absolutely silly and it may not be an autal voice that shakes the room but I have still practiced that and that was many years ago I find that if I tell him I don't hardly get to two or three times before I can feel him hear him in my spirit reassuring me of his love and concern maybe you're in a part of the world where things are really dark and you're believing God every day for your daily bread and it's easier perhaps for you to get discouraged but I want you to know that you're on Jesus's map he has not forgotten you he knows exactly where you are and what your needs are and as I'm speaking to you right now I feel like there's someone watching this program that you're carrying such a heavy burden not for yourself but for your loved ones and you see how steeped they are in false religion and for generations and God in his graciousness revealed himself to you and called you out of the darkness of false religion and lies and you have come to the Glorious gospel of Jesus Christ and yet your heart remains so heavy for your loved ones for your family that are that are left in that kind of a situation well I want you to know that I join my faith with yours right now and I pray in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ that blinders will fall off of their eyes that their ears will be unstopped to hear the Glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ we read testimonies often around the world where the Lord is appearing to men and women in dreams in Visions in all kinds of various ways and revealing himself to them and most of these testimonies come from those who have other faiths who have other religions I've even heard of the Lord appearing like he did to to uh Saul on the road to Damascus and saying I am Jesus and I the one who has come to give you life what do you do with that when you've been taught your whole life that Jesus was just one of the prophets or not even a holy man at all and then he shows up and reveals himself to you well in that manner you have no choice but to surrender so I'm just going to agree with you that God will encounter your loved ones I don't know how and you know what it's not really up to you and I to tell God how to do it it's up to us to trust him when we pray believing that he will will do even exceedingly and abundantly that which we could even ask or think that's the promise of the scripture and I don't know about you but I'm resting in that I absolutely am now you let us know when you see God beginning to break through because we want to Rejoice with you we want to share the good news that Jesus still answers prayer and I believe he does we are in the middle of a series on the spirit and power of Elijah past present and future because we discover in the scriptures that the anointing that was on the life of Elijah the prophet was such an outstanding anointing with great characteristics and demonstrations of the power of God that God In His Infinite Wisdom said this is an anointing that's not just going to be needed once in the Earth but it's going to be needed a number of times we saw that repeated immediately in the life of Elisha who received a double portion of the power and the spirit that was on the Prophet Elijah we see in the scripture that also John the Baptist came fulfilling a portion of Malachi 4 5 and six and yet we believe that the spirit of Elijah returned again to finish up the leodan church Age Again turning the hearts of men and women back back to the original Faith back to the real absolute word of God we also believe that in this hour the world is nearing a time if we're not already there when it needs again the spirit and power of Elijah this time my prayer is that it will fall on a many membered body of believers who are sold out to the truth of God's word who are willing to be counted as those who are radical Changed by the power of God and who want to be Changers we we've been changed God has changed us now we want to help see change in other people's lives and then the scripture tells us there will be another installment of the spirit and power of Elijah during the Great Tribulation period the great wrath where two prophets will raise up and preach the Glorious truth from the streets of Jerusalem so each time this Spirit of Elijah has returned turn as was the promise Malachi 45 and 6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now we've been studying on the past few broadcasts some of the characteristics or attributes of the Elijah Elijah the prophet of the scripture and in doing so it helps us to identify the attributes and characteristics of those who will be or who have been anointed by the spirit and power of Elijah number one we said he was a man of the Wilderness he understood the value of pulling aside into separation and hearing from the Lord number two we said that he preached without fear against the religious order and the spiritual Norm of his day remember that great confrontation on Mount Carmen where God showed himself powerful and stronger than the make believe God bael and then we talked about the fact that Elijah the prophet demonstrated the raw power of God he spoke into the heavens and the heavens sealed up and there was no rain for the space of three and a half years but when it was time in the mind of God for rain to come again who was it that loosed the heavens none other than Elijah the prophet and James 5 say 17 tells us that Elijah was a man with like passions with with similar emotions and a similar Constitution to all men and yet he had power with God to to supersede even the laws of nature for the glory of the kingdom of the father I love that I believe that's a powerful truth and I'm looking for a company of Believers to exercise that same kind of spirit and Power in the end time Lord help me to be be patient I know it's coming and then at the end of The Last Broadcast we talked about the fact that Elijah because he was a man of like passions as we are he experienced some unbelievable emotional swings he was up on the mountain spiritually one moment and down in the pits the next and this is something that we want to guard our hearts against it seems that when that Mighty power of God falls on us we feel almost invinci able because of the power and the anointing that is surging through our body but when that anointing leaves us then we're left to deal with our own issues perhaps the issues that we have carried our whole lives issues of rejection issues of of not having an Earthly father to be able to relate to maybe be an orphan Spirit or a spirit of poverty or whatever it is that you have dealt with in your life and perhaps not completely overcome come when that anointing lifts it's almost like those issues become magnified and we find Elijah sitting under the juniper tree praying to die feeling like he was the only one so guard your heart because if in that hour that God sends the spirit and power of Elijah on a on a many membered body if you're a part of that number you're going to want to be usable you're going to want to have all of your dissu issues dealt with and you're going to want to be ready to step up to serve the Lord in whatever capacity he's calling you to in other words this is the hour of preparation and if you're still dealing with those uh strong emotions that have a tendency to pull you into depression I want you to open up your heart and let the Lord bring healing I want you to turn loose of the pain do you know that the the Bible talks about offense and the Bible talks about pain and it appears that these things are inevitable Jesus Promised I tell you offenses will come but what we're finding out is that even though pain and offense and even sometimes rejection are inevitable experiences that we go through in life the suffering is optional in other words if we choose to continue to suffer because of those things that we've experienced it's because we keep giving them value we keep holding on to them as though they were the most important things for the present and for the future and I want you to know yesterday's gone and it will never be again and what I'm saying to you right now is not an attempt to uh delegitimize what you've gone through or to devalue your suffering or your pain or the experience of rejection I want you to know that was real it was raw and and it's it's true that it set you back okay perhaps it held you back back and and stunted your spiritual growth in some way but again that was yesterday you do not have to continue to suffer there is a healing bomb in Gilead he wants to apply his healing into that area of your heart you've just kind of got to reach out and and and hand it to him and say Lord here is my heart come in Heal Me soothe the pain and Deliver Me from the suffering that is not who you are and unfortunately what often happens is we become our pain and we find our identity in what we have suffered I want you to know that is not who you are if you're born again you are a child of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords one who overcame the world and also has given us power to overcome you do not have to remain crippled or handicapped spiritually mentally emotionally because of the suffering the pain of your past there is a solution in the Lord so Elijah experienced these real highs and real lows and from that we learn it would be vitally important for you and I to try to guard our heart against those true uh emotional swings watch out for depression depression and and oppression of of the enemy is a real t IC in this hour hopelessness is one of the things the enemy uses against the body hope deferred there's so many ways that Satan works against us in the realm of emotions right in the flesh and the soul but I want you to know that we have everything we need in the Lord Jesus if we're just willing to trust him you know sometimes especially men they they're not very in touch with their emotions they they think that's for women you know I I'm not going to to sit down and evaluate my own emotional health or mental health that that's for women to do and and sometimes we blame that on chemicals and hormones of the body but I want you to know that there are many many men of God many men around the world who also deal with with heaviness and depression and and you need the Holy Spirit to give you a lift hold on because he'll do it if you open up your life and allow him to one of the last powerful characteristics that we notice in the life of the Elijah the Elijah of the book of Kings is that he was called to oppose the spirit of Jezebel now that was an unbelievable challenge for Elijah the prophet and it wasn't always easy and he didn't always feel capable or adequate to handle that Spirit but I want you to know God used him anyway way to begin to expose that Spirit of manipulation and that Spirit of control and that Jezebel spirit is a spirit that operates every day in the church around the world no matter where you are that Spirit of control from from the enemy desires to the church it desires to paralyze the leadership it desires to put Pastors in a position where they have no uh confidence to be able to deliver a clear word from the Lord and you know that Spirit of Jezebel has to be dealt with so that the truth can come forth and the Bride of Jesus Christ can be transformed by the full unveiling of the character uh of the Lord Jesus Christ there's transformation coming and Satan doesn't want you to be transformed if you just kind of lay down and and give up well the enemy will leave you alone but if you're determined to keep pressing toward the kingdom of God and pressing toward your bridegroom the Lord Jesus Christ Satan is going to do anything and everything he can to hold you back let me remind you one more time greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world uh today the spirit of Jezebel exercises a major role in the power of evil over the nations of the world and so the spirit of Jezebel is not just trying to paralyze the church but the spirit of of uh domineering control this Jezebel spirit this is how we're identifying it in scripture because Jezebel was the queen and she was actually calling the shots she was pulling the strings in the nation doing it through Ahab her husband Ahab had the title of being The Sovereign of the nation to make decisions but really that Spirit of control and manipulation on his wife Jezebel was controlling him and therefore controlling the Nations the nation and I want you to know today that Spirit of Jezebel is alive in controlling the Nations keeping them away from God and causing them to make foolish decisions in the name of Tolerance that only jeopardize the safety and and future of their own Generations that has to be dealt with and that can't be dealt with only in the voting box that has to be dealt with in the realm of the spirit and so we need men and women anointed by God with the spirit and power of Elijah to deal with that Spirit of Jezebel that seeks to control the Nations under the Jezebel Spirits destructive and manipulative sway the governments in recent years have enacted laws and policies that tear away at the social moral and spiritual fiber of of any country I want to say our country also the United States of America but it's perhaps also going on in the country where you are right now one of the primary ways that that Jezebel spirit gains inroads to power and to control is by deceiving and corrupting legitimate leadership corrupt leaders cause their people to go estay as well so I want you to see this in the government and I also want you to see this in the leadership of the church if the Jezebel spirit can control the leaders of a Nation then she is able to give that nation and the control of that nation into the hands of the enemy and when when the enemy has the ability to control and influence a nation I tell you you'll see the most destructive things take place in that Nation we're seeing that in the United States of America as many of our leaders have become corrupt then we're dealing now with the consequences of that corruption what can we do about it well the biggest thing that we can do about it is pray I still believe prayer works now looking at that in the church we see that it is Satan's desire to arrest good Godly leadership if he can get a hold of men who have surrendered their lives to lead the body of Christ and cause them to go astray cause them to fall into moral sin cause them to to fall into the temptation of misusing or mis handling funds caused them to turn their backs on blatant sin that is going on in the body and refuse to address it from a Biblical standpoint that Spirit of Jezebel if she can accomplish any of those things in the leadership of the church then she gets a voice and anybody any body of Believers where Jezebel has a voice you can rest assure the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord is not being heard in the frequency and anointing that it needs to be so we've got to pray pray against the spirit of control the same kind of spirit that we see displayed in the life of Jezebel the Bible talks about it in First Kings chap 16 and verse 30 and Ahab the son of omry did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to his wife Jezebel the daughter of ethbaal King of the zidonians and went and served bael and worshiped him and he reared up an altar for bael in the house of bael which he had built in Samaria this is the king of Israel building a temple to a false god in the land of promise in the land of Samaria and Ahab made a Grove that's a forest of trees and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him and lot of that he was already walking in an evil path but when he married this Jezebel the evil that was in her just strengthened the evil that was in the life of Ahab we understand by reading the scriptures that Ahab was a man of weak character character oh God we need you to raise up men with true character who walk in true Integrity who serve you Lord in the beauty of Holiness and righteousness you know that's a prayer that we ought to pray together as Believers when we come back together the next time for the next broadcast we'll go a little bit farther into understanding how the spirit of Jezebel works today and what we can believe God for to deal with that spirit so that the move of God can take place in our nations in our churches and in our individual lives I want to pray for you right now that that that God will give you strength and courage to walk before him in integrity and in wholeness father I thank you for every believer every person watching this broadcast right now if they're not Believers I pray that they will call on you and find forgiveness and salvation right where they sit at this very moment Lord if Believers are also listening right now watching this program who need a real stirring up in their spirit I loose the anointing of God to go right now and stir up those lives and with their faith and my faith we agree together right now for strong leadership in our nation oh God in the nations of the world men who will lead us back to the god of the Bible men who will take a stand for the Lord Jesus Christ we pray against that Jezebel spirit that she will be exposed and that the the anointing of the holy spirit will break the churches free from manipulation from control of the enemy so that the precious word of God can go forth with power and demonstration we ask this in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for His Glory thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again next time bye-bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music]
