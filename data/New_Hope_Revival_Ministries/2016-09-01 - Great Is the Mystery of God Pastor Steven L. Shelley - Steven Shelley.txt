TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when Adam was created of God he had a perfect Spirit he had a perfect body made in the image of God and he had a perfect Soul there was no struggle in Adam he was God reflected in the earth you want to know what God was like you want to know how God thought you want to know how God operated you could have seen all of that in Adam he had Dominion God gave him Dominion which means Authority and control if he said move it had to move if he said be still it had to stop if Adam would have said to the Moon stop shining it would have had to stop shining eternal life life and Redemption they run together but are not entirely the same thing Adam would have lived forever but he would not have had to be redeemed because he hadn't Fallen he wasn't lost in the same manner the Angels had eternal life they live forever God created them such to do that but they weren't redeemed and that's why one day when the bride the overcoming bride goes home we're going to sing a song that even angels could never sing I don't know what that song is going to sound like but I know it's going to be the song of the Lamb not just the song of Moses but the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb it's going to speak of what God reflected of himself in the older Covenant and what God displayed of himself in the newer Covenant the Lord Jesus Christ when you came here you didn't have the same pure spirit that Adam had had because of what happened in the Garden of Eden man was born with an adamic nature we call it in theology which is a fallen Spirit from the beginning but your spirit having come from the original spirit of God had the potential of being restored transformed transfused by the original spirit of God and brother that's what Redemption is it was never made clear in the older Covenant that God was not just looking to redeem man he was looking to make man Sons sunship is not clearly outlined in the older Covenant and that's why we understand that great is the mystery of God and in the voice of the days in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished mystery and the Bible tells us what that mystery is it's God manifested in flesh flesh he comes first in the revelation of who he is through the word he comes first in presence perusia first he comes by the revelation of the word and when the revelation of the word becomes a living reality in his sons it's what the scripture said as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God when his word becomes a revelation to us it rewrites it rewrites everything about us that is not in perfect alignment with God I believe that it's not just back to another Pentecost that we're Desiring we think think that's what we need and my we do need another refilling another outpouring another Pentecostal you know blessing yes we all need it but if you had it you'd still have the same old DNA the only thing that's going to satisfy that deep calling to the Deep that's in the spirit of the Bride of Jesus Christ it's when she is restored all the way back to to the original creation the very reason he placed the Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden was not to sustain Adam and Eve it was there to point he was there to point to another [Music] day when man would not only eat the tree of life but he would become one with the Tree of Life when tree becomes one with its branches [Music]
