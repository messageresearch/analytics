TRANSCRIPT
========================================
David was not going to get it wrong again he'd already been through some things he'd already changed the way the glory was carried it was to be carried on the on the shoulders near the heart of the levitical priesthood David said I I see it being such a hard task and so he wanted to design a new cart that he could put the Ark on that would make it a little easier to be stabilized and if you remember it it worked but not entirely because the cart would shake and the Ark would shake and the Commandment to the Levites was don't touch the ark you can move it by the Rings you can move it by the staves but don't put your hand on the AR AR I'm telling you am I'm telling you brother sister be careful how you put your hand on the glory be careful how you put your hand on the Pentecostal experience be careful how you put your hand on somebody else's spiritual worship be careful because usza reached his hand to balance the ark and God smote him dead and David carried the guilt David was under the conviction and condemnation of the death of usza the priest because God said I'm showing you that my way is the best way my way is the right way my way is the only way does anybody hear God saying that today I do my way is the right way but there came a time that David was stirred Again by the spirit of the Lord to get the ark where it really belonged back to the city of Jerusalem what stirred [Music] him he began to hear that wherever that Ark was the blessings of God were where the freedom of the holy spirit is the blessings of God are poured out where God is free to move to talk and to have his way that's where I want to be I want to be right there in the middle of that I don't want to SP in my life sitting somewhere where Jesus has been banished to the corner with dirty feet I'm not going to live my life in a lifeless church I'm not going to live my life in a place where the Holy Ghost is not free to move too late too late he filled me with the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old I am too spoiled by the Holy Ghost to be able to live my life in a place where there is more more structure than anointing I'm not opposed to God's order it's man's order that troubles my spirit anybody with me cuz if man is not working in tandem with God he may find himself touching what does not belong to him to touch and he may find himself on the ground so this was a strong indication to David that God's anger had begin to subside and quiet down and he said you know it might be about time for me to move that Ark a little closer because the Bible tells us that David pitched the tent for the ark to sit in it was called The Tabernacle of David it's referenced several times in the Bible in fact the Bible prophesies that in those last days I will rebuild the Tabernacle of David and the main difference there were several differences but the main difference hear this between the Tabernacle of Moses and the Tabernacle of David is the Tabernacle of David had no Veil so the worshipper was not banished to the outer Court the worshipper could come right up if he had Clean Hands and a pure heart he could come right up into the presence of God and worship before the Ark of the Covenant come on no Veil to keep him out that was a that was a pre- shadow of what would happen with Christ when when he died on the cross and the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom what David had what David was operating in what David was administering on Mount Zion was a pre-type of what you and I can experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is life everything the Holy Ghost does is life producing there's no death in the Holy Ghost there's no death in a Pentecostal experience there may be death in taking a Doctrine to a shut there may be death in making some little part of the picture the least of the gifts he said there may be some problem if we if we take that as though we have reached the Pinnacle this is why brother Brandon was so against the Pentecostal movement in those latter days is because they said this is this is it we talk in tongues we have reached the highest point and brother brandom said oh no W there's so much more out there for us
