[0:00] I would rather live in this hour
[0:03] and be a part of those who will see the
[0:06] Omega bride
[0:13] it's not just the alpha fruit
[0:16] but it's the Omega fruit as well you may
[0:20] not have been a part of the alpha
[0:22] Revival but you're going to leave here
[0:24] as part of the Omega Revival
[0:27] you know he said I am the aleph and the
[0:30] Tav I am the Alpha and the Omega I am
[0:33] the beginning I am the end and we
[0:36] discovered that he saved the best wine
[0:37] for last
[0:39] so as much as I would have liked to have
[0:41] lived in the days of the alpha bride in
[0:43] the days of the early Church in the days
[0:46] of the Apostles of old if I had to
[0:49] choose between the two I would rather
[0:51] live in this hour and be a part of those
[0:55] who will see the Omega bride and the
[0:58] Omega Revival the finishing Faith
[1:01] Revival the one that will finish our
[1:04] faith because he is both the author the
[1:06] originator of our faith and the finisher
[1:11] so if he starts a faith work in you he
[1:14] is more than able to the praise of his
[1:16] glory to finish
[1:20] his faith work in you
[1:22] and you've got accepted you've got to
[1:24] believe it you've got to live it
[1:27] you don't get to go do what you want to
[1:30] do
[1:34] you don't get to be your own guy
[1:37] your own gal
[1:39] you're chosen
[1:42] you're chosen for a purpose your life is
[1:46] to glorify him
