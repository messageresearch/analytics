having the same love being of one Accord of one of mine let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name and not at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the God the Father amen father we thank you for the read in the word in the name of Jesus Lord let your words

in the church here tonight amen the power soul body and big tonight anything is in pop is possible here tonight is that right amen there shouldn't be one Sikh among us here tonight any all what God does do is speak the word amen believe it with all of our heart amen any cathain can take place Church it's the hour to believe it's the hour to receive it's the hour to release all of our worry and our doubt and believe what God has manifested to us he says well worth is groaning waiting for the manifestations I want to say it is here we are the manifestations we are the testimonies of what God is doing in this hour amen the cream of the crop is here Church Amen hallelujah the champions are here tonight amen we are the finishers of the race we are the army that the devil can't pour down we are the believers that the devil scared of we are the hosts I meant the devil's terrified up we make him scream we make him terrified we fall on our knees and then when we get up and raise our hands and glorify the name of the Lord the devil is just totally lost amen hallelujah right tonight Church we got to believe that we are them we are the manifestations other sons of God is that right if we keep looking off to another people I mean it ain't going to be able to receive what it is for is that right amen the prophet of God he got to a place that he thought was coming but God gave him a revelation that it was him Oh church hey man let's quit looking Amen father down the road say when they get here don't be like a mighty army we have possessions here tonight we are the seed of Abraham a man we take back tonight everything that the devil stole back is that right hallelujah why shouldn't we believe here tonight why shouldn't we speak it praise the Lord all is laying here tonight amen it's taste it's just laying there for us to take him believe it amen hallelujah amen it's a choice a man I was thinking here just lately of thinking about the choice you know were you we got a right to choose is that right amen and it no and you know I do what I do because I choose to do it is that right amen and it takes us back into the beginning and God I mean Jesus was what God was is that right Jesus is the product of what God was in the beginning and when we see Jesus coming to the earth this is God's choice is that right that was God's choice amen amen if we if we could draw our minds back to where we said other night where God come from amen this was his plan is that right amen his choice was to come here and die to believe he meant to give and give and serve and serve is that right that was his character amen hallelujah and we think about that they meant how he that was his choice he could have done anything he could have chosen anything that he wanted to but he chose to redeem he chose amen to come down is that right Amen from his glory to the through the filth of this world I mean where did he come he come to a manger to be born he's right beside the the manure pile and they're a mean in the most humblest place there was that was his choice and I did not think about his choice and our choice here tonight Church our choice is too it's too high it's too great amen compared to God amen we look for the best things you know just like today every one of us had a choice what to put on our plate today all that food that was set out there is that right yeah I didn't see nobody since now you got to eat this and you got to eat that and you got to eat that hey everybody had a right to choose is that right everyone looked at the MyPlate and that's what I chose a minute now I could have chose more and I could have chose less is that right but what was on my plate I chose raise the Lord Amen what more was on the tables what I missed out can you say amen amen what was there is what I missed out how many people are missing out on the Word of God praise the Lord when it's all on the table when healings already done amen it's already yours but your choice I mean it's weird are you gonna take it or not what more can he do he's already healed you he's already saved you he's already wrapped your name on the Lamb's Book you choose to sit there you choose Amen not to receive it or you choose to believe it I believe we ought to say tonight I choose to believe I choose to receive I choose to Amen to tell the devil he's defeated he cannot win he's lost the battle praise the Lord I choose to believe here tonight that there's no use of the worry about it anymore it's over I choose to say from here for I'm gonna believe it matters all right amen and so we think about that we chose whatever we wanted and and there so we think about God he could have chose whatever he wanted praise the Lord but he was rich in mercy he was rich in mercy hallelujah he had a fallen people praise the Lord that he wasn't gonna let stay falling is that right he had a fallen family that he didn't want to say fallen amen he's seen sick people that he didn't want to see sick no more he saw people that the devil had cheated Amen that he didn't want to see cheatin no more amen he took off his kingly garment man hallelujah and he says I'm gonna come down amen to that nasty world I mean that I choose to go to a little manger in the stable praise the Lord Sarah the prophet of God said that was the character of God amen that was his character he may he made this earth I mean when you see the trees that is his character when you see the rivers that's his character and then when you see people that is his character I mean can we not see God here tonight he said buddy it was his loving character that mode Jesus Christ amen he says it was not in his intentions for men to die not for men to be sick not man to have heartache or worry it wasn't in his intentions is that right but he says God had a better way provided for us amen provided for us amen he said Paul speaking here thinking not robbery but making himself equal to God he meant his own character molded that kind of person is that right I mean you think about a character is the habits a man is our thinking of our mind he says hey man let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus is that right I mean so it's the mind it's the character it's where the mind and the spirit is that right it means so you see we can think about habits it may create character Oh church amen we're so easy to pick up habits it's so easy to pick up traditional habits is that right bad habits praise the Lord will create bad character but I tell good habits can create good character amen I choose to get rid of the bad habits and take out some good habits it's nice to choose here this evening I mean what kind of service we're gonna have it's up to us to choose what kind of song we're going to sing maybe it's up to us to choose I'm gonna get something here tonight I mean I'm gonna believe here tonight I'm gonna receive hallelujah praise the Lord amen just pray with me tonight you preach not me say preach today no you preach you preach me Amen I tell you I am no comparison Amen hallelujah of these brothers preaching up here amen praise a lot but God in us is the hope of glory is that right hey man what a few is up here yeah but I tell Oh God in us the hope of glory God in us I mean it doesn't matter who it is it's God in us perfecting the saints of God Amen God in us encouraging one another in one man one Accord you know I thinking about it today I thought about Derick Calvary when when in Jesus that man that they was walking with today Amen I kind of think that maybe when all of those men that were standing at the foot of Jesus really realized what was taking place they probably had in their mind that this is a murder this is this is murder took our friend and killed him hey man I know that they didn't have the revelation that was him dying for their sins is that right I mean I really don't think that they got that realization till after it was over with but after it was over with they got up there in an upper room oh praise the Lord after it happened Church Amen and they got into one man one Accord I mean it was an intense moment I mean their Messiah Amen all of that their hopes was that they left their jobs for they had left everything for their families everything it was intense because they thought everything was between him but church he was just becoming a beginning it was just becoming a big guinea what God's plan was fixed to take place his intentions was him to become in our hearts and doing the same works that Christ was no Church we can't put all the weight on brother Isaiah we can't put all the weight on brother Steve here we can't put on the wall all the weight on one person it's all of us in one Accord one night Amen believing that whatever God says just do the word just speak sisters we you can speak the word young brothers you can speak the word hey man it's got to do with our choices is that right amen I want to take God had a choice hey man and he just didn't choose for anything look what is his choice was he said there must be something to save this creation and nothing could save it because the high specie of his creation had fallen everything under it fell with it because it fell there's only one thing left that did not fall and that was God oh he didn't leave us here to die he said so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem this creation because there was nothing here that could create it and God's own love for the world created the character expressed in Christ Church that is why we're here tonight cause of God's own love God's choice God's character is why every one of us are here amen he said it was God expressed image in him was God God in Christ revealing himself to the world and no love could ever be greater than that love such a person a man would become what he did in order to redeem what had been lost he said that order said us our heart so in love with Christ that order stirs a man holiday to see what a condition that we have fallen into God projecting himself to make a plan of redemption this was done so that the penalty could be paid the penalty was death and 100 the sentence of death could not pay the penalty for the next one under the sentence of death so there had to be somebody who was free from death in order to pay the penalty amen the infant Jehovah crying in a manger could you imagine it yard alarmed the hearts of the believers could you imagine Jehovah being a baby amen could you imagine a little Jehovah plane as a boy he meant him as a teenager that was his choice praise the Lord I mean you know what it was like as a teenager confused I mean all kinds of emotions going everywhere Jesus had those but he chose to go through that time so he could say I've been there is that right he chose that praise the Lord he said could you imagine him as a teenager or in a carpenter's shop and could you imagine you such complete obedience to God Amen dying on a cross to redeem his fallen creation that's the kind of love that God had he had to become that in order to die to hold the sting of death Oh church hey man that's why we're here tonight he said think about it he said his character projected that lovely person no woman could bring that character amen Moses's mother couldn't bring it I mean he says none of them could produce this kind of character because it would come through sex by falling people but God projected his own body his dwelling place he meant cuz nothing else could project it but his own divine character projected this tabernacle hey man is I right amen so many times people judge people by the way they dress or their statue the man is not judged by how big he is or how strong his muscles are man's judged by character and character alone hey man it's all right man is judged by character what is in his heart a man a man he said there's no way that you could ever produce a character like that the character that God had you wouldn't have done it I wouldn't chose to done that none of us would have chose that that character wasn't handed down to us a man through our birth praise the Lord it wasn't even in us to think of one another like that is that right amen and we're Christians are we barely have one another today we barely think of another one we barely saw one another where we're at today much less if we was the board is sin and having that character we would have never done it praise the Lord it's like that song I don't know if you've ever heard it brother I was a the bad girl down the street mmm amen they said there was a bad girl that lived down the street everybody called the bad girl because of her life was just in a mess said but they was that an accident happened one day and they had heard some girl jumped in the car and saved this girl that was in this ray someone says who saved her who was it they said the bad girl down the street you know church man God has sprayed this earth with his blood he sprayed his earth with blood and every person that's walking around outside these doors amen has an opportunity has an opportunity to this word like we have it we should never get to the place that our noses up in the air Amen thinking they don't have a chance at it o Church whereas our character that we're wanting to see the walls redeem we're wanting to see this great gift handed down to others oh praise the Lord Church I mean God was looking at us like that Amen hallelujah we know enough of this message to realize Amen well is it for the blood I mean what would we look like everything that we ever done for my birth will be standing staring at God in the face maybe he needs to bring us behind the door sometimes Amen he says look here he says Jesus on his way up he said the devil always doubted that being any more than a prophet he didn't believe he was Immanuel God manifested in his own son he couldn't see that how could God the Great Creator ever stand there and let somebody pull his beard let somebody smite him in the face let somebody spit on him I'm talking about the God chose this character to let somebody spit in his face right I mean that was his character cough hey man hallelujah and we see that Amen is there jerking his beard and bloods pouring through I mean they placed that crown of thorns on his head I mean the devil standing there says this is no way could be the Son of God no way would he let them do that to him oh it was throwing the devil for a loop Church that God was letting them do that to him all brother sisters a felony already speaking to us that's the kind of character that God wants us to have hmm raised the Lord he never opened his mouth now you that's sittin here tonight that's going through these trials and through these Amen intense moments this is speaking to you here tonight while he's speaking those things last night I was thinking about the this here tonight the character of God hey meant that we don't fight amen amen we don't fuss back praising Allah we don't try to prove ourselves is that right God didn't try to prove himself he didn't fight back he didn't fuss back is that right he knew who he was and you know who you are and you know where you're standing a manhunt solid ground you're standing on the word Amen but don't let the devil try to prove you make you prove to him you don't have to do that that's what the devil wants us to do to try to prove to him O God didn't prove to the devil nothing he just said it is written say that it is written hey man it's all we got to do is believe who we are amen I just choose to believe Who I am amen he said the devil says that can't be the Son of God it just can't be he wouldn't put up with that but sons of God put up with anything as long as they are know they're doing the will of God and that's what he come to do criticism well now we with our message can we stand by the looking glass of God's Word and see Christ reflect in our own lives then can we bear such and reproach the message that we're standing for here someone can say something about it and yet you just don't open your mouth and say nothing about it he was an example because God was reflecting his character in him and then if we're sons and daughters of God we reflect his character in us then we become like him that's our heart's desire is to be like him is that right Emma Church amen you have a choice to be like anybody in this earth and then the internet is full of patterns I mean full of people that can do big things and do great things and show themselves other heroes and you can patter your life off of that I mean you've got a choice to do that amen but there's a choice that you can do the opposite of those things that find another pattern to look at and say there's a greater thing than that those are something that's affected my life that I choose to believe that's what I want to be like amen praise the Lord Amen I pray that we're interested in that character amen your mind makes your character let the mind Paul says let this mind that was in Christ being you hey man is that right I meant heard an idle mind is Satan's workshop you know Satan's got a workshop and it can be your mind if it's idle I mean if you're standing idle the devil is just sitting there working thoughts in your mind is that right in other words he's got his hammer right there on top of your head amen driving doubts and failures on all this in your mind amen but I'm telling you tonight you got a choice to believe you can choose to say Satan I am NOT going to believe that report I am NOT going to sit here and let you do those things is that right amen praise the Lord and so we see we're looking at God's character here tonight amen but I want to take you over to a place where David Amen was going to the throne because I want to type this as the bride is on her way to the throne Christ was on his way to the throne and that was the character he chose to go to the throne with is that right hey man I want to tell you David was anointed to go to the throne but before he went to the throne he had to get a character to get to the throne will go praise the Lord the bride is on her way but she's going to get a character on her way to the throne praise the Lord and that character comes through suffering it comes through Amen hallelujah I've just same in being intense moments Church verse the Lord oh my I want to tell you when you're looking at the bride you're looking at people that's went through hard things when they're still in church you're looking at people that has went through this test and went through this hard thing through the hardest things there's people out there a man that's never went through hard things like us and still be able to stand Amen with a positive attitude praise the Lord hey man I look at David and he's being chased before he gets to the throne you know David didn't run to the throne and and jerk anybody off when Samuel anointed him he didn't go straight to the throne is that right we're predestinated to be on the throne of God but I want to tell you hey man we got to go through some things to get there it matters not right a man we're gonna be worthy to be able to sit on that throne hey man there's gonna be people looking at us yeah I know who they are amen they are the ones that stood the test a mint that were over commerce in that age of Laodicea praise the Lord that they wouldn't bow to this and bow to that fanaticism is it right amen David a many as he's being chased amen you know and he goes into a cave the rest and here comes Saul comes in the cave with him is that right David's in the back there and his the one his chasing him is laying right there is that right I mean how many's had those nights where the devil's just going speaking through your mind telling you you can do this you can do that you can take revenge you can get back with them huh you can leave huh you can do this and that amen and David's sitting there with all these choices amen to say I'm tired of running I'm tired of this battle with this man I can end it right now I have the privilege to do it hey man he set her with all those choices amen but God says David as a man after my own heart you see David Heyman had an example and it was God Amen hallelujah he had fellowship with God like Enoch had Amen in here he he was after character of God praise the Lord in there he's got all those options and choices amen to take Saul and destroy his enemy Amen but ask that character is being expressed out of David he chooses to let Amen that man come out from behind him and go out that door alive praise the Lord and when Saul comes out that door Amen David says Saul Amen said I could have had your life I couldn't took this and stopped all of this nonsense I could have put it into this but he chose not to you know Church if we would have choices in our trials we'd like to say God I've had enough I've had enough I can't handle no more will you please stop it or will you please hey man hey man hallelujah just stop it all Lord but we choose to say nevertheless the I will be dying to the heart it was an intense moment when Christ was in the Garden of Gethsemane saying oh god I gotta do this Amen oh this is my choice but nevertheless not my will but thine will then Oh church amen oh praise the Lord God help me tonight Amen to speak to your heart and soul I mean I want to take your troubles everywhere if you're a believer trouble is all over you all around you is that right you can sit there and act like everything's good but I want to tell you Amen hallelujah amen I go home with me go home with you we'll find out what kind of trouble we got Amen a child of God's life is not easy amen

sir God's raising druggy Christians is that right amen hallelujah David him in a Mentos not to take that Amen as an end to the situation a man constantly kept on going and going praise the Lord but I tell you through all that running through those wilderness oh praise the Lord run to death the enemy on his trail and gets downer to the house of God amen in these story and ain't no food a meaning it's just for the priest eat the bread a manic but God allows him to go in there and eat that bread amen it's a meaning it doesn't harm him he puts no harm on David oh I don't want to tell you he's rich in mercy to his believers that's going through the hardest trials Oh church hey man God is letting it s eat some bread that'll give us strength to be able to come out of these things praise the Lord Amen hallelujah David was on his way to the throne and he's gaining this character the things that he's a man going through amen this tough thousand different things everybody seems to be ready to kill him this battle after battle finally gets to a win in the battle and he comes back home and the kings are stowed although the wives and all of their treasure him and all the things and take it away from him and then these churches ready to kill him his brothers amen everybody turned against him Oh church I want to tell you we're in a battle I mean everybody it's just after oh it's a nervous

praise the Lord I mean let me get to this probably all said he God put us on a free more agency that we could choose they said what kind of God would it be if he made us love him and he made us serve Him wouldn't be much choice would it Amy it'll be just well I'm here cause I got to be Emma Church you ain't in this church because you got to be you're here because you want to be you're here because I chose to be a man what made you choose to come here tonight there's many decisions that you could have made but you chose to be here you chose to hear this word Amen hallelujah I want to tell you there has got to be some kind of power behind a choice a man that is making you choose that choice is that right Amen I want to tell you if you could look behind that that choice tonight and see the power of God that's caused us to choose to believe this message choose to believe what we've heard from the beginning is more than able to give us confidence to the coming of the Lord church amen you would see the revelation of Christ in you the hope of glory the whole church I told somebody all today I said I wouldn't trade myself for nobody else now I know right now that sounds really really bad it's not because I like myself it's nothing to do with that it's because the experience and the relationship that I've had with Christ that I know if there ain't nothing in here to quicken when God's quickening amen then it won't be clicking is that right and I wouldn't trade myself because I would be afraid that they wouldn't have that Oh church when you get that revelation a man that God is dealing with you God's working with you then you're gonna be happy with what who you are and your position praise the Lord I'm telling you better than just your husband or your wife you wouldn't trade it you are just glad and you know with experience what God is doing in you Amen that you would say I'm happy to be Who I am I am happy to be a me that God has chosen me God call me Amen praise the Lord praise the Lord it'll make you go on it'll make you choose to keep going hey man it's all right I choose to be a winner don't you hey man hallelujah so he god give us a free more agency to be able to choose that we could choose on our own God wasn't gonna make us choose he left that up to us so it's up to us what we're going to do about it is that right and I know we're predestinated and I know foreknowledge and all of that but Amen gosh and I look down through time and seen the choice you was going to make and that choice is what puts your name on the Lamb's Book alive I know we didn't come to God he meant God came to us it was a Adam going through the garden saying God God it was God going through the garden saying Adam where aren't you it was none of us looking for God it was God coming looking for us oh praise the Lord you remember that time that dog came looking for you God came searching for you and he found you no church a little lost lamb saying Here I am Here I am oh-ho God searching tonight he meant to find that little lost lamb praise the Lord it wasn't us looking for God it was God chose us but see he you didn't know that choice was in you Amy you didn't know where it was that in your life but God could look down in time and see that we would choose to love this message choose to support a pastor and choose to go to church and choose to read our Bibles amen we would choose not to do those things amen all those other things but choose ain't meant to see what is the best oh I hope this makes sense Amen I'm just trying to give the leadership to the Lord amen he says I choose a man to fight praise the Lord I mean against the current of the world amen you know the way that everybody else is going you see what we're looking at we're looking at a world full of drifts people is just going along with the way it is in the hour I mean you see all the folks Amen that are just giving in with the new ways they've dropped their standards they've dropped their morals amen to go along with what is going in this day and age I'm telling you it makes you sick to see a man older ones that are giving in to the perversion of this hour amen amen it ain't their fault it's the older ones that's giving in to the new age us letting this perversely come in can you say Amen because they know but the children is not being tall Amen to know what's right because no one is taking them back to what is truth Oh church God says Amy hold the truth amen stay with the word tell your children to tell their children Oh amen what we're seeing is an hour where people don't know how to choose they're born as a boy and then they choose and then they've got the options where you don't have to be you can be something else you see it's just Satan trying to pervert my people's minds because Satan's trying to hit them at a young age to get them away from their identity can you pull them away from amen the the quickening power of God but I don't care what they look like I don't care what they think they are if that seat of God is in them brother Amen that quickening power is able to get a hold of them a man is able to change their lives Amen to bring them back to their reality of who they were in the beginning with God Oh church every one of us can say here under that quickening power and realize who we were in the beginning was gone I don't care what you look like or where you was at but it brings us the power God brings us back to our true identity with the Lord amen praise the Lord you know it's just drifting I mean it's easy to drift let's just think about that here tonight it's easy to drift with everybody the way they're going that right and you know when you drift you don't have to do nothing you just go you just let go and you just go I want to tell you a lot of people just just let go of everything is that right they don't know who they are they don't know what the purpose is they don't know whether they are going they don't know who that where they come from amen they'd have no purpose in me anything can happen in they don't bother room all their hopes even if it don't happen then it doesn't bother room they got no vision of people without a vision to perish amen but Churchill has a vision I meant to be what God wants it to be amen to have that character I mean we don't want to just drift I mean we don't be going to become Christians and things just start drifting I mean you were stretched drifting wink all caught a hold of you he got ahold of you and pulled out of that drift turkey out of that water that was going amen down the way is that right your life was troubled but he pulled you out of that amen and set you on something that was stable got your teaching got God told you who you were and all that but Saphir we don't watch out Amy will be come right back into that position of drifters we got to know our place that God wants us to be in the house of God we got to know our position I mean we we got to know that we got to fight against the perversion against all the wicked ways imagines that right you know the Hebrew boys let's think about them for a minute they chose not to bow when everybody else was bound when the whole church was bound they chose not to back just because something in them tell this is not right now that'll get us can you say man hey man there's a lot of people around you that might be going this way but there's something in you we'll be saying that's not right don't do that praise the Lord Amen I believe that's God dealing with you a man that's got checking with us amen and that's what did we were boys us there was out of place that they didn't think that was right huh praise the Lord you know that the devil had it so close that it looked like it was right and the boys believed in a prophet amen and they knew who it was amen and it was Daniel it was who God was speaking through through the hour is that right but the church went overboard and began to raise up an image like Daniel is that right amen and they had enough God in them to say that's not right they didn't drift along with the rest of them but they said that's not right and when they said that's not right it began to put up a tense teaching huh Amen it began to persecution on is that right I mean halt hell became to come against them amen the challenge was if you don't bow then you're gonna burn well brothers and sisters I want to tell you it's flipping around now if you bow amen you're gonna burn hallelujah praise the Lord we came bow to the things of the world anymore church we gotta stand a man if it's a fight we gotta fight against it but I choose not to drift with the world I know where it's going it's going over the dam it's totally lost but I choose not to drift with that hue man praise the Lord those boys I'm talking about boys not men boys chose not to go that way they stood and then the challenge was met we're gonna throw you in the fire Oh brothers and sisters the fires hot tonight Amen the devil hates this meetin praise the Lord the pressures against us but I want to tell you I choose to keep believing in a meeting like this is where people is giving their hearts back to the Lord backsliders are coming back to Christ amen minds are made up I'm not gonna keep letting this be able to defeat me any meetings like this is where people are turns around regroups Amen praise the Lord it's time to regroup amen hallelujah say we're not gonna buy to these things amen those boys regrouped he says even God won't deliver us we're still not going to buy huh brought up to the fire the door amen amen hallelujah amen they looked around them and the men were falling at their feet from the heat of the fire but they were still standing what's the matter with those guys I just had a heart attack or something what happened anyway I'm telling you it's time to see supernatural phenomenal things taking place in our lives when you're standing you're seeing people that's not standing hey man there's something about that isn't it I want to know why are you still standing why are you still going to church why are you still believing this message it's because God's doing something supernatural in it because you choose to keep believing you choose to keep putting your church clothes on and going to charge praise the Lord praise the Lord they open the doors amen they showed those boys in oh praise the Lord they was marching around like was marching tonight hey man why was we doing that tonight to show the devil weand island to show

many hey Allah D and they say in the fourth man was leading the fire with them and it was Jesus that came down there with those boys that chose not to by all praise the Lord Amen that was Jesus in the fire before he come to the manger that brought God on the scene your troubles can bring God on the scene if you choose not to go with the way everybody else is going amen I want you to look at that in our hour everybody is going the way the Laodicea look at the spirit of the layout of say it's naked there's no need no need of the Spirit of God it's going into insanity there's a current of Laodicea Amen and brother I mean it's troubled waters it's bad is that right you can look around me and you can see what's going on oh praise the Lord isn't it fifty times worse than what it was in the 50s isn't it so much worse than it was in the 60s some of your older ones you shaking your head you know how it was in the thirties and forties and fifties amen but looking at it in this age Oh church is the worst at worse and is drifting and it's going to drift into tribulation but there's a people that's saying I am not choosing to go that way I choose to believe that there's an escape out of this way hallelujah praise the Lord I want to tell you a man when you look in the rivers and there's a lot of lot of driftwoods out there raise the Lord but for those driftwoods could look over there in the Middle River and to see a boat going down through there they say well their boat their wood just like we are the wood just like we are yeah but there's something in the boat that ain't in the driftwood huh it's a power in the boat that's not in the driftwood Oh hallelujah is that right there's something that says we're not drifting we know where we're going there's something in this process we know where that we're right in the same water with you but we're not drifting we got a destiny we're going to opposite way we're not going to overboard we know where we're going and we're going out of here Church oh praise the Lord but I want to tell you you lose that power and you'll be just like the driftwoods I've seen boats over there with the triplets huh praise the Lord there's people Amen that was Christians that was doing good but now they're hung up because they chose Amen to just slack off a little bit chose to get a man just to not get involved with it a little bit Oh church you say our choice don't have nothing to do with it absolutely it does amen I want to tell you it's time to say I choose to believe Amen I choose to believe that I'm a child of God I choose to believe that I'm not going overboard with the rest of them praise the Lord I'm not going off into fanaticism I choose to believe that I'm gonna stay right on the to God praise the Lord I choose to be amen hey hey a person in this family that's gonna be a top host they don't believe the word not be a backslider not being a drifter but I choose to be someone in this family that will pray for the rest of them alright amen when you're fighting against the Carr brothers and sisters it calls us it causes a distraction doesn't it I mean you could take something that's fighting against the current amen it's easy to see worse yeah yeah it's easy to see where it's moving I want to tell you that the world's eyes are upon us and they say that we're not going with the current that we're fighting

fighting we're not fighting one another for fighting Amen hallelujah to stay alive we're fighting to stay above all of the fanaticism is that right Amen hallelujah Amen you know when you when the currents going down a man there's something that you can do you can swim out of this there's a choice do I swim or do I just drift you know and when you choose to swim then you're gonna have to fight against the car is that right it's life and death situation your choice is life and death situation mmm I want to tell you I believe God's revealed to us all here tonight what is life and what is

I ami didn't know who I was amen I choose to swim out of this because you have to break the law of gravity you have to fight against the friction Church a man if you're fighting that tells you you're not going along with the drift praise the Lord if you're fighting I'm gonna tell you amen you're doing something gets all the other Amen things that's trying to take you down but if you're not fighting Church oh you're losing ground you know it's so easy when the devil wants to pour all his negative news on you to tell you you're done you're finished as a brother that comes to preaches for us brother Joe Roberts his little wife she says she went 3 days without sleep she just had enough she couldn't have no strength she couldn't make it any longer said that third night she was just in bed that night and she said I I told the Lord the Lord I'm done I can't go no more father I had no strength to go no further I'm finished said to her dad has been gone years ago I said all of a sudden amen she heard her dad's voice says you're not finished yet you're not done and said her dad began to sing to her right there in her bedroom begin the scene so she fell asleep since she woke up hours later and he was still singing Church sometimes we think we're done sometimes we think I can't handle no more prison water he said I'll put no more on you than you can bear hey ma'am God likes to wait to the last minute to prove to us I've had this thing a man in control ever since you started amen but I wanted to see you fight I wanted to see your faith I could have healed you just like that but I wanted to see your faith well done here's your healing here's your deliverance oh it's worth at our church to fight sometimes amen hallelujah y'all been praying for my mother I want to be careful what I say but you know the doctors came in and and give her this report on top of this report on top of this report raise the Lord and there was just too much and then they said they wanted to scan her brain to see if it was there you know when they say it's here and it's here in the air what you to know if it's there but she said no I'm not gonna do that I read my Bible with my eyes I pray with my lips and I ain't going aloud for me to know what the devil is doing there praise the Lord see the devil likes to attack where the behind is mine battles is that right the workshop to tell you you ain't gonna live you can't do this is that right but she refused she chose not to know that praise the Lord Amen hallelujah and then then I give her over all this all this negativity and they give her no hope and sent her home praise the Lord then here comes all the medicine amen piles of it praise the Lord to let her drift to a place that she don't know who she is to a place that she can't fight to a place just to give up you know Church The Devil's got stuff that he wants us amen overwhelmed with that we can't think right that we can't resist the Bible says resist the devil and he shall flee is that right praise the Lord amen but he wants to lay so much honest that we he'll say put on us there's no use to fighting anymore praise the Lord but we need one another Church maybe you're in your
