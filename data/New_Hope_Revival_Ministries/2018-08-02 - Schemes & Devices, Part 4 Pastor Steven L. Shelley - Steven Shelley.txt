TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope award hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you today on behalf of the gospel channel brother Eric Erickson and all of the fine staff that worked tirelessly to make sure that the gospel channel continues to bring you good spiritual programming programming that will teach you the Word of God and strengthen you in your spirit man and encourage you to keep pressing toward the wonderful wonderful Savior our Lord Jesus Christ there's a whole lot that goes on to bringing this good gospel programming into your home and I hope that you will pray for the gospel channel and that you will believe God with us for all the provision that is necessary it's not cheap to buy time on the satellite and to get this Network into your home it's very expensive and we want to thank every one of the partners of the gospel channel for what you've done maybe you've never given and God would lay it on your heart and you would step up to the plate and you would sow into the work of the Lord I know this I believe that it's fertile ground and I believe that the vision that God has given brother Erickson is a real vision from God I believe that the gospel Channel is going to be raised up by the Lord to even accomplish much more than what it's accomplishing right now so what we can do is partner with them in prayer and with our giving and send them a note of encouragement when you can let them know that what they do is blessing your life and encouraging you to keep moving toward the Lord I know that it will be an encouragement to them I know how exciting it is when we hear from you when you call or email with your prayer requests we know there's someone on the other end of this camera it's encouraging to know to have a name to have a location and we take those prayer requests to the Lord and we mention them in our local services and we believe that God certainly answers prayer we have been studying together in our last few sessions schemes and devices and we use as a theme for this study 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 where it reads lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices I truly believe that as you watch these programs you're going to learn not to be ignorant of the devil's devices and I believe this is number 4 in the series and I don't know if you know this or not but you can go on YouTube and search for new hope revival ministries and you will be able to watch in in rerun you might say all of the programs that we do for the gospel channel so if today is your first day joining us in this series you can go to youtube and you can find parts one through three and watch them because I believe that the Lord is revealing some of the ways the schemes the devices the cycles that the enemy is using to hold God's people back I have good news for you again today and that is Jesus is the victor no matter what the enemy does no matter how he comes against you if you are washed in the blood of the Lamb if you are surrendering your life in obedience to the Word of God you have every right to pick up every weapon in the arsenal of the Spirit and use it to defeat the enemy to break down in a stronghold or any death structure that the enemy has raised up in your life we talked about strongholds recently and that is from the scripture that talks about casting down pulling down every stronghold the enemy what a stronghold is is in in the original that word means a castle or a fortress or a fortified place but if if there is a stronghold it also means to have possession of the mind and the emotions the enemy doesn't just want to pass by and leave a thought or two negative on your life he wants to build a platform he'd like to build a throne he'd like to just come and sit down in your life and continue to hold you back from the promises of God we talked about the last time we were together that the enemy one of the strongholds that the enemy often uses is Hope deferred that is hope that the enemy has violently seized hold of in your life dreams and visions passions things that God has stirred up in you purposes and why's that the Lord has revealed to be a part of your life and yet that old thief desires to come and steal them from us we're just thankful that we know greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world when we finished our study last time we were together we were talking about death structures and I'd like to give you just a little definition here about a death structure these structures are not only built over individual lives but also over whole congregations and ministries the enemy's ultimate desire is to cause death to visions to ruin lives and death structures are basically this whatever is not releasing life in you must be recognized as something that is releasing death Webster's dictionary defines the word structure as the manner of which something is constructed as a building or a bridge it implies how something is built a structure is similar to a framework by definition when we consider our bodies we often refer to our frame which is our skeletal system it involves the body structures and the bone structures let me read a portion of scripture to you to see if we can help help you see the difference between a death structure and that which releases life in you let's look at 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 6 in the amplified it is he who has qualified us praise God making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient I want you to know that your worthiness is not based on your performance your worthiness is based on what Jesus Christ has accomplished on your behalf your worthiness your fitness your qualification it's not your talent and your skill it's based on your yielded nough stew who has already finished the work of salvation and made it gloriously available to you and I as individuals it is he who has qualified us making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient as ministers and as dispensers of a new covenant of salvation through Christ the Anointed One not menís of the letter of legally written code but of the spirit for the code of the law kills the King James says the letter of the law kills but the amplified says the code of the law kills but the holy spirit makes alive I want you to know that the enemy can sometimes build a death structure over your life of religion he can make you so religious that you miss the joy of having an intimate personal relationship with Jesus Christ what happens is you become like the Pharisees that Jesus rebuked they were straining at a little gnat a tiny little insect while they were swallowing a camel the enemy likes for you and I to focus on the code of the law the letter of the law and that in itself though a gift from God and it has a divine purpose there's no doubt about it but if we don't approach it from from the place of being qualified by Jesus Christ being saved sanctified and made worthy through Jesus Christ we will get caught up in in the ritual of the law and in the routine and tradition of religion and we will miss the joy that comes from having a personal intimate daily relationship with Jesus Christ you can keep all the commandments and not have relationship I truly believe that God doesn't change his mind about his word I truly believe that the instructions that God has given us and his word are very very important but the enemy will take something as beautiful as the instruction of God and use it in your life as a framework to release death over you and death over your family we've got to be very careful because we want to have the life that the Holy Spirit brings from the word it's clear that if we are led by the law by doctrines of men by religious systems or traditions that make the Word of God none effective we're going to experience death rather than life let me explain to you that I don't believe all traditions are of the devil I don't believe that all traditions are just mere religious ritual I believe there are traditions that are rich that are powerful that have prophetic significance in our life but I'm talking about rituals that we can hold on to that render the Word of God non effective in our life that condemned us and cause us to judge and condemn others you know I believe in something that we sometimes refer to as convictions Holy Spirit convictions I believe there are things in your life that the Spirit of God will put his finger on and and point out to you with understanding that you should refrain from those things and they may not be necessarily things that are completely totally outlined in the scripture but the Spirit of God quickens it to you and says I want you to stay away from that I want you to refrain from those things I want you to know I appreciate the Holy Spirit of God leading me in my life I appreciate God putting that little prick on my conscience I appreciate God you know creating for me some boundaries I like to say spiritual boundaries that are created for me God knows me better than I know myself and he knows there may be certain areas where I need tighter boundaries than someone else what I have to be careful is to do is to follow those convictions to to stand in the boundaries and the parameters of what the Spirit of God deals with me about for myself and as the priest of my home I must also believe God to protect my family and as a pastor a shepherd of a local congregation I believe God uses those convictions to help guide us as a family as of as a people as a congregation but what we must be careful not to do is to judge and condemn others based on our convictions the Word of God is the same for all of us the truths of God's Word they're not optional they are unto us they are given to us but I do believe there are areas of conviction sometimes people will will erroneously call them tradition when when they're not necessarily tradition but but areas where the Spirit of God has spoken to to someone who has waited in prayer I would not have you to participate in the things of the world and this thing in particular we need conviction we need to to seek the Lord and ask for his leadership too to steer us away from things that might cause us to stumble but we don't want to add so much of a burden to people with our own conviction not not the word the word is not a burden the Bible said His commandments are not Grievous to me and they're not Grievous to me but sometimes we can take these little areas of personal leadership and conviction and we can try to weigh damn that brings death instead of life and so be careful how you lump everything into the same category if we as individuals are corporately in our churches build our faith on either of these foundations the traditions of men the doctrines of men religious systems and orders if we build our faith on either of these foundations rather than on the pure truth of God's Word as revealed by the Holy Spirit we'll be caught up in structures that tend that promote death instead of life it's going to be imperative that we who are a part of the limnic bride of Jesus Christ and I believe there are members of that remnant bride that that are connected to us through the gospel channel I believe that we must seek to overthrow to pull down every structure of death that the enemy would raise up in our life every framework of thought patterns and you know traditions we spoke about religious ritual that we have added to the Word of God and it promotes death and it leads to Hope deferred I believe we've got to be faithful to ask the Lord Lord revealed to me any area in my life where I've got off where I've stepped off the word where I've got a little bit off track and I'm bringing death to my family instead of life I hope I'm not confusing you I just want to expose any way that the Lord brings to my heart that the enemy is using to to build these strongholds in people's lives I want to expose every scheme I wish the Lord would show me every way that the enemy is working against people today every device that the devil is using because I'd like to sound the alarm I'd like to uncover the enemy I'd like to expose him for who he really is because I know that we have Authority and power through Jesus Christ against our enemy let's look at Ephesians chapter 2 verses 21 and 22 and we can do that also in the amplified Ephesians 2 21 and 22 in him the whole structure the body is joined bound welded together harmoniously and it continues to rise to grow to increase into a holy temple in the Lord a sanctuary dedicated and consecrated and sacred to the presence of the Lord how many of you want your body to be sanctified consecrated dedicated to the presence of the Lord and how many of you want to know that you're attached to the body of Christ who is also desiring to be sanctified consecrated dedicated to providing a place for the presence of the Lord to land to show up in your life experience in him and in fellowship with one another you yourselves are also being built up this is the kind of structure that we need a structure that connects us to him and to one another not a structure that connects us to our enemy and the Spirit of death you see the difference I believe this scripture is giving us a plan for a structure in the body of Christ that leads to life and to hope let me read verse 22 again all the way through in him and in fellowship with one another you yourselves also are being built up into this structure with the rest to form a fixed abode a dwelling place of God in by through the spirit I want to be an individual temple unto the Lord I want him to be able to come and occupy my life as his body my temple my body as his temple no you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and this is the kind of life that we want to be ministering in and we want to be moving in not death I want to release life wherever I go hope in Jesus Christ a death structure is created when the devil builds on the foundation of past hurts and pains and failures and disappointments and the weaknesses of yesterday can I read it again a death structure is created when the devil builds upon the foundation of past of the past the pains the failures the disappointments and the weaknesses of yesterday and the devil seeks to convince you and I we can never break free from our past we can never break free and you know he anoints people in our lives to constantly remind us of where we were what we used to be who we used to be I want you to know if any man be in Christ he is a new creature he is a new creation old things old life old sins old habits have passed away and behold all things Oh a ll all things have become new Satan desires to lock you in a death structure of your past if he can keep you moping in the asked wallowing in the disappointment hurts pains failures of the past he just builds a structure of death all over your life and holds you as his prisoner but I'm telling you there's Liberty for you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ through repentance by accepting what the Lord has done for you how he has qualified you how he has made you worthy with his own blood start fellowshipping the truth start choosing to move past your past and into your present somebody said didn't you mean to say into your future you can't move into the future until you are willing to embrace the present you've got to begin to recognize that God is moving today he is an on-time God yes he is he never misses an appointment he never shows up ten minutes too late he's an on-time God he is a now God and he has a now word for you in your life he is not just the God of history but the scripture says that he is a present help in the time of need do you presently need the Lord's help then step past your past make up your mind I'm going to meet Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday and today and forever I'm going to believe that he has come to deliver me from my past failure from my past hurts and wounds you know folks I know there are some of you watching this program today you've been so wounded so hurt so disappointed so let down so betrayed your life you have known great pain and great sorrow and I I'd like to say how sorry I am I mean that from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry for your pain I really feel compassion toward you in your pain and in your wounds and the hurts of your past I know there have been people who have let you down I myself have let people down not always being able to be what they needed me to be at that moment I know what it feels like also to be let down and I am I'm so sorry that you had to feel that and walk through that and experienced that but I'm even more sorry than it has paralyzed you I'm even more sorry that the enemy has used all of that stuff to keep you locked in a death structure and I've come today to tell you you don't have to live under a structure of death you don't have to be locked in a prison in a stronghold of Satan Jesus Christ has come that you might have live let's quote the whole thing the thief that's who we're talking about he cometh not but for to steal to kill and us to destroy but Jesus said I am come that you might have life say that with me life life it's no life when you're locked in your past it's no real life when you're when you're living as a prisoner to a structure of death all around you you can't break free jesus said I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly I want to declare to you today in the most holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that he has made a way for you and I to have not only life but abundant life more abundance in our life God has made that available if you can recognize how the enemy has built this structure scaffolding around your life that only leads to death and that he has built that scaffolding that structure on the foundation of the past what a scam what a scam artist the devil is to build this structure of death or smack-dab in the middle of your past knowing that you have not been able to get through your past to live in the present and to reach for the future he then attempts to take that and establish a strategy that becomes a structure resulting in abandonment or death of vision an abortion of Destiny Hope deferred let me read it again he then attempts to establish a strategy that becomes a structure resulting in abandonment or death a vision you know some of you God has given you hope for your future God's given you vision for ministry how you might help others how you might serve others well the devil doesn't want you moving ahead to obey God because he knows that if you begin to move in obedience to the call and the plan of God in your life it's going to release the abundance it's going to release the blessing and the devil doesn't want you to be blessed of God he doesn't want you operating in the abundant life he wants to shrink you he wants to pull you back and pull you down but Jesus wants to increase you he wants to expand you into his vision for your life you know it's true sometimes we get the wrong vision for our future sometimes in our human effort we come up with the wrong plan but I'm willing I pray you'll be also willing to trade in my vision for my life for his vision for my life I know I have ambitions plans things I'd like to do things I would like to see half but I'm willing to submit that to the one who has given me life Who am I to tell him how my life is to be he has already great plans for my life I've just got to be willing sometime to submit my life plan my life strategy for what he has planned for my life the enemy wants you to give up on all vision all plans he wants you to give up on even living out your destiny once a death structure is in place over us around us the enemy seeks to gain illegitimate Authority control over a life I want you to know if the enemy can't move you from the inside if he can't possess you from the inside he will control you from the outside that's his desire is to control you he is a an awful taskmaster he's a terrible slave driver he wants to crack his whip against your shoulder and cause you to serve Him even while you're a member of the local church I tell you that's wrong it's just wrong to allow the enemy to control our lives when we call ourselves Christians members of the body of Christ but if we don't know any better if we're ignorant of the devil schemes and devices and strategies then you know we're almost non responsible for what's going on but there must be an answer there must be a solution because ignorance is not the answer truth is what makes us free and so I believe God is raised up avenues he has raised up tools like Christian television like the ability to stream and to broadcast even over the Internet I believe God has raised up some of these purposes some of these technologies we should say and and means so that we can get the truth that we need to expose the enemy I mean yank the cover off of him really show him that we know he's just a bluff he's a tool in the hand of God to bring the Saints of God to perfection he only has the power and control over our lives that we forfeit that we allow him to have and this is how he operates he uses all of these death structures this living in the past causing us to turn loose of our vision and our hope for the future and builds that that you know structure all around us to kind of lock us in to keep help from coming to us and to keep us from reaching out for help because he wants to gain that illegitimate authority that illegitimate control over our life you know I heard once someone said if you ask the devil to dinner he'll bring his suitcase he won't just come to eat dinner with you he'll come to move in in other words if you open any door to the enemy in this hour he will move in he will absolutely move in the old timers used to say if you give the devil an inch he'll take a mile I want you to know he'll do more than that he'll continue to take and take and take and take as long as you just forfeit and surrender what's really yours don't you think it's about time to expose the enemy and for the body of Christ to rise up and take possession of the kingdom of God in the earth don't you really believe that there is hope for this world I do and it's only found in a true personal relationship with Jesus Christ the church is sick the body of Christ has fallen ill we have fallen prey it seems and have prisoners of war to the enemy and it's time that we wake up out of our slumber and we realize that we have taken from the enemy long enough we have the power to overcome and to defeat the enemy who comes to steal our hope and our vision and our purpose look at mark with me just a moment chapter 3 verse 27 and I'm going to read that also in the amplified it says but no one can go into a strong Mans house and ransack his household goods right and left and sees them as plunder unless he first binds the strongman then indeed he may thoroughly plunder his house in Luke chapter 11 verse 21 and 22 Jesus spoke of the strongman who is prepared and armed to keep his home and to protect his possessions but warns of what can happen when a stronger than he comes upon him and here is here's that verse when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armor wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils the original strongman here is you to have possession over your own life over your own giftings over the things that God has invested in you you're the original strongman here you're the one who keeps the house it's your home and you're the keeper of that home but if one stronger than you are should come upon you then he will come in and take every weapon and steal all of your possession I want you to know there is no no power no principality no spiritual wickedness that's more powerful than a man a woman who has fully surrendered to the life of Jesus Christ I've got a stronger than them all living inside of me and you do too through the new birth if you've been born again by the spirit into the family of God that we can say as we often quote greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world the one who is with you helping you to protect to defend what has been given to you by grace if you'll keep him as Lord of your life it doesn't matter who the enemy uses and how he comes against you you will absolutely have the victory there is a term that's used in the New Testament called the seat of Satan and it was considered it's mentioned as being a part of the city of Pergamum at the end of the first century Pergamum was a thriving City so why does the Bible tell us in the book of Revelation that it was a dwelling place of Satan well the answer lies in the ruins of the city's temples on one side of this city of air a beautiful city there were many many beautiful buildings there but on the other side on the flip side the city of Pergamum was one of the darkest areas cities in the entire Roman Empire revelation 2 verse 13 says I know thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is so Jesus speaking to the church in Pergamum telling them I know that Satan has a seat in your city he goes on and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan do here those terms where Satan's seat is where Satan dwelleth there were temples to false gods the people of Pergamum were known as the temple keepers of Asia the city had three large temples dedicated to the worship of the Roman Emperor another for the goddess Athena and the great altar of Zeus who was believed to be the king of the Greek gods many scholars believe this altar is what is being referred to as the throne of Satan mentioned in the book of Revelation the word throne in the Bible was used in a personal private residence it was a chair for the Lord of the house we might say the master of the house or in modern times we might say the man of the house the very fact that Jesus would use this terminology means that Satan felt at home in the city of Pergamum he sat on a throne there he built a place to dwell there in the hearts of men and women it was his territory Satan became the master of the house in the city of Pergamum it appears that false worship and pagan rituals that were going on in that city were evidently providing a home or a headquarters a comfortable place for evil to dwell there I want you to know this principle works today in a much more personal level there are lies that we agree with on a regular basis there are associations that we maintain there are roots of bitterness and jealousy and unforgiveness that we refuse to let go of there can even be objects in our home that we can possess that give the enemy permission to seat himself over our lives I want to read that again this principle works today in a much more personal level there are lies that we agree with associations that we maintain roots of bitterness jealousy unforgiveness that we hold on to and refuse to let go of and even objects that we possess that can give the enemy permission to seat himself over our lives god forbid how would you like to discover in this moment that you have kept a root of bitterness in your life so long that you are giving the enemy permission to sit down over your life to treat you as his throne even as he did in that in the churches of Asia Minor specifically the Church of Pergamum where it says Satan's seat was there was something about that temple in the city of Pergamum there was something about the rituals that went on in that awful place that that caused it to be considered the stronghold or the seat of the enemy but we're making this personal what if you found out that because you have refused to forgive a certain person you have actually been giving the enemy permission to keep harassing you in your life I tell you I believe it I truly believe that I think that it's even possible to travel abroad and to pick up little trinkets I know this will be too much for some people but I believe it's possible to pick up little trinkets and souvenirs from foreign countries that were that we're a little bit ignorant of of their culture and we don't know that sometimes these little may and little little figurines we call them are really images of false gods and representing parts of ancient culture that were against Christ that that were absolutely against truth and but by bringing those things into our home I've had God deal with me in my life and I've watched God deal with other people in their lives because when you when you when the enemy keeps coming in and coming in and coming in and and nothing you do seems to seal up your life and give you protection and victory against the enemy then you start examining even the smallest thing and I've had the Lord direct me at times letting me know there are there there's something attached to that item it represents something that you're not fully aware of and I've had the Lord and struck me get that out of your home and I have I've even burned items before because I didn't want them to fall into somebody else's hands you say wait a minute preacher now you're getting kind of fanatical well then I just encourage you to focus on on the issues that we mentioned bitterness and unforgiveness and but but what if all of that you've got victory over what if you truly can say I have no bitterness I I've forgiven everyone that I that's ever wrong to me but but still the enemy keeps getting permission it appears he has open access to my life to my family to our health to our finances well then you might consider some of the things that you've brought home some of the things that have been even given to you where where demons spirits like to use those items as permission to come in I'm not encouraging you to be a fanatic but I'm encouraging you to be a serious Christian a true serious child of God one who wants to walk in the fullness of abundance and blessing and truth and you are willing to submit everything every aspect of your life into the hands of the one who loved you so much so that he might put his finger on anything that would allow the enemy to keep harassing you and those you love I tell you you might pray about it you might ought to pray about it and consider these kinds of things because once we allow the enemy to have a seated position of false authority in our lives we have allowed him to be enthroned over us and he must be pulled down he'll never take himself off the throne over your life he will never surrender illegitimate authority that he is stolen from you automatically or just because he's tired of fooling with you and wants to go on and harass other people never once it's established the only way to break it is to tear it down in the authority of Jesus Christ and in order to do that you've got to be able to recognize it so how we would approach that is to just begin to pray lord it seems that the enemy has somehow been granted permission to just harass and torment my life and I'm asking you to turn the searchlight of your love onto my inner being and show me any root of unforgiveness any root of anger any root of jealousy or bitterness I'm asking you to search my home my treasures my possessions show me if any of my associations any of my memberships maybe I've joined something that's darker than what I realized when I was initiated in to a secret order or Society maybe through through relationships that are not of God we are not to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers sometimes even having business partners that are not born again of the Spirit of God a lot of these kinds of Association and you're just asking the Lord Lord show me put your finger look he's not going to come in and condemn you but he may gently guide you into that area show you specifically what what has given the enemy permission and what must you do you must then repent of participating hosting that thing in any way and cut off the access if it's an item then you just get rid of that thing as fast as you can if it's if it's a Association if it's unforgiveness then you have to start dealing with these things as God gives you strategy to do so as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God and I'm telling you God wants to lead you by his Spirit if you'll open up your heart and let him to dethrone Satan from your life to rip him down from having any kind of seat or throne over your family your church your your own life isn't an individual you've got to go to the word you've got to use the Word of God and the scripture tells us just to simplify the strategy in the time that we have left in 2nd Corinthians 10 and 5 we are to cast down imaginations let me tell you something that is arguments and theories and reasonings every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of God and lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ the Messiah The Anointed One there is a way to deal with death structures with false paradigms and strongholds there's a way to deal with Satan if he has taken seat over your life because you have somehow granted him illegal access this is such a powerful portion of Scripture that I don't think we could do a lot of justice to it in the in the time that we have left but we might as well read it and start the process start the journey 2nd Corinthians 10 verse 3 through 6 in the King James it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled the next time we're together I'd like to break that down for you I'd like to look at it in the amplified and I'd like to see just what the Apostle was saying to us about how we deal with these accesses that have been granted to the enemy in our life one more time let me say this is not my favorite subject this is not something that I really enjoy digging into or teaching but I think it's vitally important in the hour that we're living in right now that we asked children of God this is a message to believers I'm really speaking to Christians who have followed through obedience the steps outlined in the scripture we have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ we have repented of our sin we have asked him to wash us in his righteous blood and set us free from the law of sin and death we have allowed his word to sanctify us to cleanse us to set us apart for the service of the Lord and then we have been filled with his life by the power of the Holy Spirit and yet in our Christian experience and in our Christian journey we have have really dealt with a lot of junk because of Satan because of the enemy and now we're learning some things we're we're having some things made clear to us that we can use to expose the enemy and to pull him down I tell you I don't want him to have any illegal Authority in my life I don't want him to have a place to sit in my life I want to make my life so filled with the truth and life of Jesus Christ that Satan has to keep his distance you know I believe it's possible I truly do I believe there's a victorious life available in Jesus Christ we're gonna face some stuff we're gonna still have battles we're gonna still deal with issues of sickness and and heartache and loss and grief life is filled with those kinds of things but I don't believe we have to just lay down and take whatever the enemy decides to throw on us I don't believe that Jesus has called us to serve Him and has forsaken us and left us to fall a victim and to become prey to our enemy I believe the New Testament is clear he has given us everything we need through Jesus Christ to defeat the enemy let me pray for you right now I just appreciate you
