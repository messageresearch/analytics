[0:59] me I'm I'm I'm excited for it this is
[1:01] something I've been looking forward to
[1:03] and I'm glad it worked out yeah
[1:05] everything I always said everything
[1:06] happen for a reason reason for
[1:08] everything we're going to get to that
[1:09] and it was a time you know it worked out
[1:11] perfect today for sure because we're
[1:13] coming down we're headed south and we're
[1:16] not going to Tucson this year first time
[1:17] first time in 60 years I haven't gone to
[1:19] Tucson that's crazy to think about yeah
[1:22] are you is that a little bit
[1:24] Bittersweet better sweet uh yes and no
[1:28] yeah really I mean we're not having
[1:29] Harmon this year yeah so we had harbon
[1:31] 17 years in a row and that was a that
[1:34] was a challenge I'll be honest with you
[1:36] it takes a toll on you for sure no I not
[1:38] toll it just a lot of pressure yeah with
[1:41] singers that don't know how to sing and
[1:43] I shouldn't say that no but people that
[1:46] want to sing you know people that I know
[1:48] good people good people you know
[1:50] everybody you know everybody's a singer
[1:51] in their own way and I I learned the
[1:53] lesson and one time there this guy got
[1:56] up and set bad I mean it was bad and I
[2:00] said man next time we won't have him
[2:02] sing and the a brother come up
[2:04] afterwards he said you know what that
[2:05] guy meant to me when he sang that song
[2:08] and never said it again cuz you never
[2:10] know on them things when you touch
[2:12] somebody you never know the songs and
[2:14] you were on Harmony enough that you how
[2:16] I run that I always told him if you get
[2:18] I trust you if I didn't trust you you
[2:20] wouldn't be on stage sir you would not
[2:21] be there you'd meet Mr WS nobody wants
[2:25] to me this no but it was uh if they felt
[2:30] led to sing another verse go ahead
[2:32] because you get something pulling on you
[2:33] you better do that you better do what
[2:34] the Lord lead you to do not Mr WS or
[2:37] brother WS you have to L if you do it
[2:39] again yeah and that's the way I did that
[2:41] things that's and that's the way I am
[2:43] and you know we started Harmony we'll go
[2:46] right into that Harmony we'll go right
[2:48] into harmony started Harmony because I
[2:51] was in Tucson and I got tired if you
[2:53] went to Brother gre's Church they did
[2:55] people didn't talk to you you want to
[2:56] brother McHugh's Church they didn't get
[2:58] along yeah and I like Good gospel music
[3:01] I go to I go to the nqc National quet
[3:04] Convention I used to go with brother
[3:05] green and we used to used to be in
[3:07] Louisville and I take my dad and I had
[3:09] 12 tickets to that every year and
[3:11] brother Billy Paul would go with us and
[3:13] the people from voice of God I'd give
[3:14] them tickets and they'd all come and and
[3:16] I like Good gospel music I really do I
[3:18] like good singing it and um I talked to
[3:22] brother green one year about that I said
[3:24] why don't we just do that let's just
[3:25] have a little Harmony in Tucson
[3:27] so I didn't say Harmony we we sat down
[3:31] one day at First Cafeteria with brother
[3:32] green and about six or seven other
[3:35] brothers young men there and um we had
[3:37] to come up with a name we couldn't come
[3:39] and then and one then they come to
[3:41] Harmony in the desert I said that's the
[3:43] that's what we're going to do Harmon
[3:44] because it's music that yeah Harmony we
[3:46] wanted Harmony cuz we had different we
[3:48] had different names and you know
[3:51] Believers and singers or whatever and
[3:54] that's that's how we got there with
[3:55] brother green and the harmony got
[3:58] started because I wanted everybody to
[3:59] love each each other there's no
[4:00] preaching there at Harmony no preaching
[4:03] at all and if you do you get shut off
[4:05] your M your might get shut off you meet
[4:07] Mr words but I mean not being smart
[4:09] about it but that's just the way it was
[4:10] there was no preaching and you know I
[4:12] wanted people to Fellowship I wanted to
[4:14] show the love is what I wanted to do
[4:15] there we met a lot of good people I mean
[4:17] we met
[4:19] people um from all over it I mean and
[4:22] just thinking about like us like the
[4:24] kids or whatever we met people from
[4:26] Harmony that we would have never met
[4:28] ever if it wasn't before Harmony I mean
[4:31] like Hunter aong and people like that uh
[4:33] Abe and you know will and all them we
[4:35] never met them if it wasn't for Harmony
[4:38] and you know being able to go there and
[4:41] it's been good I mean the kids all got
[4:43] together the kids would be more
[4:44] friendlier than the adults but I think
[4:46] we had a we had Harmony was good it
[4:47] worked for 17 years it was good
[4:51] uh it was uh like I said no preaching
[4:55] and uh nothing against preachers or
[4:57] whatever but I mean I didn't want it to
[4:59] be a a thing like that I wanted to sing
[5:00] it good singers We There was good
[5:02] singers from all over the country I mean
[5:05] wow I couldn't believe we had some that
[5:07] kind of caliber around it I I knew that
[5:09] but I didn't for sure and the reason I
[5:11] did it I didn't have brother green do it
[5:14] I didn't have it at the church the first
[5:16] year was at the Civic Center in tucon
[5:18] before Christmas I thought that'd be
[5:19] good because everybody don't have
[5:20] Christmas well I found out that people
[5:22] do have Christmas I learned that one
[5:25] that was our first one right before
[5:27] Christmas and then we went to the fox
[5:29] seed
[5:30] for two
[5:31] years and that was a really interesting
[5:34] experience and uh now what what year did
[5:36] was the first
[5:37] one that been 17 years 2006 I
[5:41] believe and that was the Civic Center
[5:44] and then we uh brother uh it was really
[5:48] interesting cuz I don't know music I
[5:50] don't know a note from a do man I'm not
[5:52] stupid on that them guys were say play C
[5:54] or D or give me f or whatever and I
[5:57] don't have a clue just say sing the song
[6:00] to him that's what I say just sing it
[6:02] but that's the way I am and and then and
[6:04] brother
[6:06] Swanson come to me afterwards and he was
[6:09] professional he used to travel with
[6:10] Billy Graham and them okay and his
[6:11] daughter pharoh was a violinist and it
[6:14] got down at first night or second I he
[6:16] says you don't have a clue what you're
[6:18] doing I said you got that right but you
[6:21] know what when the Lord tells me to do
[6:22] something I do it I'm just going to be
[6:24] honest with you that's you know and
[6:26] that's what I told him and it I reminded
[6:28] him that a couple years ago he didn't
[6:31] like it but that's what he told me but
[6:33] you know Harmony was good for different
[6:35] people we met got some marriages out of
[6:38] it you know yeah some girl married

[11:23] we got along really well as kids and
[11:27] um
[11:29] and that's we met him the first time
[11:30] when I was out here and then uh we just
[11:34] clicked him and I just clicked this you
[11:36] know and
[11:39] uh uh my ab Maran and Gan Norman that's
[11:44] my dad's sister okay and my uncle
[11:47] Willard is my dad's brother and he's the
[11:49] one that give my uncle Jean the magazine
[11:52] okay the magazine the show brother

[12:08] Sun said all lot with brother bandam H
[12:10] my uncle jene was a hunter and uh that's
[12:14] where my dad was when brother
[12:16] brandham grabbed his hand you call him
[12:18] little
[12:21] Dy my dad was 6'4 big
[12:25] man you always called me little
[12:27] Donnie and he touch he says what's that
[12:30] on your ear he said I don't brother B I
[12:32] don't want to bother with it he says
[12:34] what's he said you know what's wrong he
[12:36] says I kind of know what's wrong but
[12:38] it's all right that's when brother
[12:40] brandham said I was quicking power he
[12:42] had cancer he had brain cancer so that's
[12:45] he was a quicking power that was my
[12:47] dad and
[12:50] uh it said he and then the quote it said
[12:52] he'd never had a scarf from it or
[12:54] anything no no no quit bleeding bleeding
[12:57] for 6 months or something like that just
[12:58] the drop of blood out of his ear there
[13:01] so and
[13:04] uh so that's
[13:07] uh that's that little testimony and then
[13:12] uh we went fishing with brother brownon
[13:15] one time with my uncle Jean MH and we're
[13:18] at
[13:19] Speedway and two sou Speedway in Fourth
[13:22] Avenue there's a fruit store right there
[13:24] I remember right the place cuz I was
[13:26] sitting in the back seat with my brother
[13:27] Mike and uh he kept B me ask him ask him
[13:31] cuz I had Polio when I was younger 13
[13:33] months old and and uh brother Brown says
[13:38] Bobby if you didn't have the polio You'
[13:40] never know where you'd go you know
[13:43] there's everything happened for a reason
[13:44] he said you probably would never
[13:46] stop you know and I and I look at that
[13:49] that's what I say to everybody I look at
[13:51] that all the time there's a reason for
[13:52] everything and it's tough sometimes I'm
[13:54] going to tell you yeah it's tough to
[13:56] look at reasons why you things happen
[13:58] that way
[13:59] and
[14:00] uh CU it's tough for me to get around
[14:02] man you see that at har manyy I mean
[14:05] I'll sit there give a little red light
[14:07] and fight and do this or that but I mean
[14:09] it's just the way it is cu if I didn't
[14:10] I'd probably be you never know I could
[14:12] have been an alcoholic I could have been
[14:13] anything you know so that's that's what
[14:16] I look at if I had to nickel for every
[14:18] time you have told me you know something
[14:20] you know that's for a reason or
[14:22] everything's for a reason you know it's
[14:24] it's something that ever since I met you
[14:26] and you started telling me that that
[14:27] I've tried to live by because sometimes
[14:30] things are super hard to understand but
[14:32] you know the Lord has you yeah you boys
[14:34] got in a wreck yeah you know but that's
[14:37] what I tell people 3
[14:39] seconds it's over man you have a second
[14:43] chance
[14:44] uh like a flat tire oh man I got a flat
[14:48] tire and uh or red light man I got to
[14:53] get to church I'm late but you never
[14:54] know there's a reason behind that stuff
[14:58] just like like uh in during Thanksgiving
[15:00] time I was driving back down from Myrtle
[15:02] Beach and it was supposed to be like a
[15:04] 7-hour drive ended up taking me almost
[15:06] 11 hour drive because of the traffic and
[15:08] rain and stuff and even then like I was
[15:10] getting so frustrated and I caught
[15:12] myself and I even said it out loud a
[15:14] couple times Everything's for a reason
[15:15] everything's for a reason and I would
[15:17] get up maybe another mile or so and
[15:19] there'd be another car accident thank
[15:21] you Lord you know that could have been
[15:22] me if I was if I wouldn't have been
[15:24] stuck in that traffic a little ways back
[15:26] yeah and you got to look at them things
[15:27] that way I mean because everything's you
[15:30] know the Lord works this mysterious ways
[15:33] I'm just going to tell you that he just
[15:34] handles things in mysterious ways that
[15:37] you you'll never figure out why you did
[15:39] this or why that girl left me or you
[15:42] know why did that guy do that to me or
[15:44] whatever and you know or why did I say
[15:48] that other guy but you know people look
[15:50] at you you got already you know people
[15:52] do watch everything you do and say and
[15:54] for sure you know that's the Reas I
[15:56] never use my name I use my name in I
[15:59] mean they don't need to know who I am
[16:01] can I've just been Hest with you you
[16:03] know I'm a businessman and they don't
[16:05] need to who know I am it doesn't matter
[16:06] who I am you know I'm kind of crazy but
[16:09] that's all right hey it's okay it's just
[16:11] Mr
[16:12] wordss that's Mr WS coming out um
[16:16] there's there's also something that you
[16:17] have that you've always given out and
[16:19] you probably I don't even know how you
[16:21] probably thousands and thousands of them
[16:23] little stickers yeah have faith I got
[16:25] two things in my wallet that stay in my
[16:26] wallet at all time it's the $2 bill that
[16:28] you gave me and the sticker that says
[16:30] have faith and that is that stays in my
[16:32] wallet no matter no matter what I got
[16:34] that in the back of my phone I give them
[16:36] out and it opens doors that you don't
[16:38] even know that opens when I pass them
[16:40] out cuz I don't we were at the airport
[16:43] the other day in
[16:44] Idaho Go Minneapolis and this lady come
[16:47] up to Jenifer she says what kind of
[16:50] religion are you we said we're
[16:52] Christians what you know and she looked
[16:53] holy you know she you know she was clean
[16:56] and neat and I give her that half face s
[16:58] and then there's a g ahead of us in the
[17:00] airplane she discovered him an operation
[17:03] and she was she was sucking air she
[17:05] wasn't doing very good she was I gave
[17:07] her one of the little stickers and she

[17:10] she said she turned her phone and she
[17:11] said see I got it right here she had it
[17:14] on her phone already but you never know
[17:16] you know you never know who you touch
[17:17] and things like that that's I'm just
[17:20] crazy that way and different things I
[17:21] mean shouldn't have say crazy but I just
[17:23] if I feel led to do it I do it for sure
[17:25] and you that's how you've lived your
[17:27] life really yeah
[17:29] they wonder why I do things yeah but

[23:32] mean it
[23:33] was like I said everything happened for

[23:39] where you just got to you know yeah it's
[23:41] Ty ofon yep y everything you
[23:43] know you shake your head on a lot of
[23:45] things but that's just the way it is I
[23:47] mean that's way life is one day maybe
[23:49] we'll understand it when we you know get
[23:51] to heaven maybe we won't but the Lord
[23:53] had a proud care for yeah he's you know
[23:56] he's got to laid out for sure you know
[23:58] Jennifer and I always always said this
[24:01] you
[24:01] know the Lord's will you know whatever
[24:04] we do that's one thing I got I got a
[24:06] great wife you got it let's talk about

[24:29] that's tough yeah but Lord's will be
[24:32] done for a reason but you know
[24:35] everything goes on you know in life
[24:40] uh it's interesting people though you
[24:44] know you around H many you see different
[24:46] people what they do and what they try to
[24:48] do you know
[24:49] but but there's good people and know
[24:52] what I always said I don't care where
[24:53] you go to church just go to church MH

[25:02] me just go there and shake hands you
[25:05] know be a brother you know put your arm
[25:06] around if they need something go help
[25:08] them there's so much like fighting
[25:10] between the churches and stuff nowadays
[25:11] and it's just sad it's stupid because
[25:14] the at the end I mean especially around
[25:15] you know the message churches because
[25:17] you're everybody believes the same thing
[25:19] I mean well there still yeah and it's
[25:22] it's just sad that there's got to be so
[25:24] much Division and fighting amongst the
[25:27] churches yeah that's re they wanted
[25:28] Harmony because I done 10 churches or 12
[25:30] churches in tuca when he started that I
[25:32] didn't like that yeah that's one reason
[25:34] I did it you know is that one of the
[25:36] reasons why you did it in Arizona yeah
[25:39] yeah yeah cuz I was down there yeah I
[25:41] went to an auction and the one brother
[25:43] would even talk to me because I went to
[25:44] Brother Green's
[25:46] church now how stupid is that and we're
[25:48] still going to church I mean we're going
[25:50] to go we're trying to go the same place
[25:52] I mean really give me a
[25:55] break you know I shouldn't say it that
[25:58] way but but and no I mean it's the truth
[26:01] you know I mean it's it's sad to you
[26:04] know have situations like that yeah it's
[26:07] but it's way life is people are funny
[26:09] and they they for a reason still so and
[26:13] sometimes you can't figure out the
[26:14] reasons and and it's just that's for
[26:16] sure maybe you'll understand it one day
[26:18] one thing about Tucson they got a lot of
[26:20] things going there they got Sabo yeah
[26:22] you know a lot yeah a lot of that's got
[26:24] a lot of lot of character there I mean I
[26:27] take care of you but they got a lot of
[26:28] things there Eagle Rock and stuff and
[26:31] some and uh Sunset you know yeah so I
[26:34] mean it's and people that come in for
[26:37] harmony enjoy going and right hikes up
[26:39] there and seeing all that stuff because
[26:41] I mean it's important for sure man she

[27:14] George's son and he's got it there and
[27:17] so they'll welcome you yeah it's
[27:19] definitely a beautiful oh it's thing to
[27:21] look at brother brat laid that out you
[27:23] knew that first yeah he laid that the
[27:25] way he wanted it okay I did not know
[27:26] that yeah yeah wow
[27:30] appr will you just tell me when and how
[27:35] like you got saved and baptized and
[27:37] where it was at and stuff I believe it I
[27:40] got saved on a Tucson Tabernacle brother
[27:43] brand when he was probably communion I
[27:46] was there and I
[27:48] was having a tough time I'll be honest
[27:50] with I was crying
[27:51] and and
[27:54] uh took communion and uh
[27:58] that's probably when I was 13 years old
[28:02] you know and then I got baptized in Smo
[28:04] Canyon what two years later or the K
[28:07] baptized me in
[28:08] Sabino the water in the water you
[28:11] baptized in Sabino yeah so you said well
[28:13] there's a pool right there when you go
[28:15] across the road there and that's where I
[28:17] got baptized at well so when since you
[28:21] were so young when brother Bam passed
[28:23] away and stuff uh what was it like when
[28:27] after you passed away and you started
[28:29] growing up listening to the message and
[28:30] studying and stuff what kind of effect
[28:32] did that have on
[28:34] you you
[28:36] know well I was going to high school
[28:38] there in Tad I was uh
[28:42] ampai Sarah was going there his daughter
[28:45] Sarah and
[28:47] uh so
[28:50] that I knew was right and wrong so I
[28:53] didn't do anything with the I I worked
[28:56] when I was a kid I mean I I I'd hire 10
[28:58] kids at from church and we I did a lot
[29:01] of things pained houses move furniture
[29:04] Brother Joseph helped me cuz I he was he
[29:08] wanted to be part of the kids and you
[29:09] know and I I made him work I just be
[29:11] honest with you he wanted to if you
[29:13] wanted me to pay him he had it
[29:16] work but we did that I did that for
[29:19] years with the kids and you know brother
[29:21] brandom I was we they have special
[29:23] meetings brother green used to have
[29:24] christas meetings there and you know and
[29:27] people would come in and I remember when
[29:29] the Believers first come there Tucson
[29:31] that year that's kind of where the
[29:33] Christian music I mean the gospel music
[29:35] for the B they the Believers from Canada
[29:37] and I remember them guys going on the
[29:38] trip and they come to our house before
[29:40] they left that next day
[29:42] and that's I got good friends with them
[29:45] Brother Art and brother minow I'm still
[29:47] good friends with them to this day and
[29:49] they and that's a lot of their music is
[29:51] there you know singing that and and that
[29:55] that was you know
[29:59] I
[30:03] was uh church it was different and then
[30:08] I remember the kids 77 I graduated
[30:11] 1970 but they heard of the tape that
[30:13] 1977 the world is going to come to an
[30:16] end M Nam kids are getting married like
[30:19] unbelievable young kids yeah 15 16
[30:24] thought they had to get married and some
[30:26] of them are still together a lot of them
[30:27] aren't and I I think that was wrong but
[30:31] that's hindsight I always say that's
[30:33] 1010 but you know that was part of the
[30:36] deal there that that was 1977 when
[30:38] everybody thought they should go they
[30:41] had to get married yeah they want to
[30:43] have kids before they could you know and
[30:45] that's that's one thing that was struck
[30:47] me a lot you know I look at things I
[30:49] look back to the message and that we
[30:51] were going have meetings and travel to
[30:54] different meetings around we I remember
[30:55] going to Christmas meeting we went to uh
[30:59] in
[31:00] December I think it was 1960 when
[31:03] brother Brown preached at Christmas
[31:04] meeting at Jeff we went back there for
[31:06] Christmas meeting and he passed out
[31:08] candy at church brother brandom did he
[31:10] preached a service there and passed out
[31:12] candy to the little kids in church I
[31:14] remember going to that meeting I
[31:16] remember that one cuz I thought that was
[31:18] really interesting to go to that and we
[31:20] went to Brother sop man's house to
[31:24] uh for Christmas lunch
[31:28] you know we were there at Christmas so
[31:32] uh do you have any stories that you can
[31:34] share about you and brother green or

[40:36] prayer that's awesome are you still the
[40:38] vice president no no you only get you're
[40:40] a ter oh yeah
[40:44] so um the only thing I would ask you to
[40:46] do is would you mind say in a prayer I
[40:47] like to get the guest to pray over just
[40:50] pray over the audience and um but I also
[40:53] it kind of has become like the I won't
[40:55] say Trend but I ask a lot of people at
[40:58] the end of every podcast if you have
[41:01] something that you could say to the
[41:03] younger
[41:05] generation um some advice or anything
[41:09] that you would have for the younger
[41:10] generation what would it
[41:13] be I always tell the
[41:16] kids if you get down and out just give
[41:18] me a call just give me a call I'd rather
[41:21] you call me than go to your funeral CU I
[41:24] tell you what things are tough
[41:27] tough enough but they're not that tough
[41:30] because you don't know if you do
[41:32] something crazy you don't get a second
[41:35] chance and you don't know how many lives
[41:37] you touch I always like the movie It's a
[41:40] Wonderful Life cuz I look at that and
[41:41] watch that how that
[41:44] was if you weren't here what would
[41:46] happen if you weren't here and I look at
[41:48] that cuz if I wasn't here this wouldn't
[41:50] have happened when they got married or
[41:51] this or that you
[41:53] know and or whatever where you meet some
[41:56] somebody you know you you just that I
[41:58] look at that cuz I watch that
[42:01] movie and that I look at that really it
[42:03] touches me I'll be honest with you
[42:05] because if you would have done this I
[42:06] couldn't have done that you know my
[42:08] whatever you know that's what I look at
[42:10] with the kids kids if you ever get down
[42:12] and even adults if you ever just give me
[42:14] a call just give me a call my phone's
[42:16] out all the time he's got Joshua's got
[42:19] my number just call him and give you my
[42:20] number and that's fine cuz I don't give
[42:23] my number out and if I call you it'll be
[42:24] no caller ID and that and you're not
[42:26] just saying that you really do mean that
[42:28] cuz I remember the first or second year
[42:30] I was at Harmony and we were getting
[42:32] ready to do the choir yep you got up I
[42:34] mean there was probably aund or
[42:35] something 100 or so kids maybe a couple
[42:37] more and you got out there and said if
[42:39] you ever need me call me and someone
[42:42] said well what if we don't have your
[42:43] number and you they said get ready and
[42:45] you gave I got myund and something kids
[42:47] and I had one girl call me so you never
[42:50] know and it may have and you may have
[42:51] done that just for that one girl yes
[42:53] yeah but like I always said if he gets
[42:56] somebody on your mind call them yeah do
[42:58] that cuz you just don't know what you're
[43:00] going to do when you touch somebody sure
[43:03] yeah little girl got in trouble you know
[43:06] Harmony last year or was it two years
[43:10] ago I had her sing a couple
[43:14] times and they said what you doing that
[43:16] you know they kind of you know they kind
[43:18] of quiz you yeah but that girl always
[43:20] going through some
[43:21] troubles and
[43:24] uh she had in trouble and uh she come
[43:28] back to Lord but I mean you just never
[43:30] know you know I I just
[43:33] uh and
[43:35] uh like the MC's for harmony you know I
[43:39] never picked him till I you know I I I I
[43:42] would sit there and think about it like
[43:45] I had a couple of them do a couple three
[43:46] or four times in a row
[43:50] and my brother used to critique me all
[43:53] time hey what do you got that guy doing
[43:55] for what are you doing this for you know
[43:57] but it's easier said and done if you're
[43:58] not there yeah you know but I give
[44:01] people Liberty when they when they do
[44:02] things you know you got to do you got to
[44:04] have faith you got to have that faith in
[44:06] things like that so but I'm truly
[44:08] telling you kids if you get trouble give
[44:11] Joshua a call you'll give you my phone
[44:12] number it's on like I said I'll call you
[44:14] back cuz it's I'm serious on that
