[0:00] but I do have to take on the mindset of
[0:03] Christ where I am pouring out my life
[0:06] for my fellow man for my brother my
[0:09] sister you see he started out as God he
[0:24] condescended into the form of a human
[0:30] Lucifer was trying to make an ascension
[0:34] before he ever made the descent it is
[0:39] necessary before we ever make our ascent
[0:42] our climb that we have to make the
[0:45] descent we have to come down we have to
[0:48] humble ourselves even as Jesus did this
[0:53] is not just about one man who descended
[0:57] first and emptied himself and he took on
[0:59] himself the form of a man and went to a
[1:02] cross to pour out his blood I don't have
[1:05] to do the pouring out my blood part but
[1:08] I do have to take on the mindset of
[1:11] Christ where I am pouring out my life
[1:14] for my fellow man for my brother my
[1:17] sister we are going to end up having to
[1:22] get dirty because not every person who
[1:27] is elected predestinated looks like you
[1:31] and me today
[1:34] there may be people who are under the
[1:36] bridge in Columbus Georgia
[1:38] I do not know they may be again in front
[1:41] of a toilet getting rid of the nastiness
[1:43] they put in their body last night it's
[1:46] hard to tell where they are but they are
[1:48] not in the same position that we are
[1:51] therefore I'm preaching to us today
[1:55] because I believe that it is necessary
[1:57] for us to recognize who we are that we
[2:01] do not have to be afraid to put
[2:07] ourselves in the mindset of Jesus Christ
[2:11] who being in the form of God thought it
[2:14] not robbery to be equal with God because
[2:18] he was put on the earth to save those
[2:23] that were lost
