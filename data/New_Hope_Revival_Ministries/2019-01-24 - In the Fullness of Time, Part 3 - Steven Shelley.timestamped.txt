[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right I Christ
[0:43] in you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:03] Shelley and I'm coming to you again
[1:05] today on behalf of New Hope revival
[1:08] ministries our ministry in Alabama in
[1:12] the United States and also on behalf of
[1:15] the gospel channel our partner we are so
[1:18] delighted that God has given us this
[1:20] opportunity we've been coming to you now
[1:23] for over a year
[1:25] and I've been involved with the channel
[1:29] for many years now and have made several
[1:32] trips to Iceland and I never cease to be
[1:35] amazed that God is using that little
[1:38] place Iceland it's a beautiful place but
[1:41] it's a small place and God is using it
[1:44] to have such an impact I don't know
[1:47] where you're watching the program from
[1:48] today but I know that it is a blessing
[1:51] to you the channel and the ministries
[1:54] that are represented there and I can
[1:56] tell that God is doing things in your
[1:59] life by your phone calls by your prayer
[2:02] requests by your praise reports and so
[2:05] we're here today because we want to be
[2:07] I'm not here today out of a deep sense
[2:11] of obligation I'm here because I want to
[2:14] be God has opened up this door and he
[2:17] has given us the grace to be able to
[2:20] come and share with you I hope a message
[2:23] that will encourage you I hope that it
[2:26] will be a message that will help you be
[2:28] directed in your life toward a closer
[2:31] relationship with Jesus Christ so let me
[2:34] invite you to continue to share your
[2:37] prayer requests and your praise reports
[2:39] with us it's always encouraging to hear
[2:43] that God answers prayer we know he does
[2:45] but it's always encouraging when someone
[2:48] calls or writes and they have such
[2:51] desperate need and it burdens our hearts
[2:54] sometimes as we read the need and almost
[2:57] feels like that we would like to reach
[2:59] out you know with our own hand with our
[3:02] arms we would like to reach out and join
[3:04] hands with you wherever you are and so
[3:07] at times in prayer our hearts feel like
[3:10] they're being joined with yours as we
[3:12] take your need
[3:13] the Lord and so when we hear that God
[3:16] has answered prayer that the tests have
[3:19] turned out okay that God has moved in a
[3:22] legal situation that the symptoms are
[3:24] gone and that someone is confessing
[3:27] their total healing in the name of the
[3:29] Lord Jesus Christ than it is certainly
[3:32] an encouragement to us perhaps you've
[3:36] noticed that there have been a few weeks
[3:38] where you may have not seen a new
[3:40] program we want to bring you new
[3:42] programming we absolutely do but one of
[3:46] the reasons why you might have noticed
[3:48] that is because I've just returned from
[3:51] Kenya with my two sons benjamin judah
[3:55] and joshua river and we had a wonderful
[3:58] time in kenya we ministered in nairobi
[4:03] and we ministered in Nakuru and all what
[4:07] a glorious reunion it was it had been
[4:10] some 18 years since the last time that I
[4:14] was ministering in Kenya and I have to
[4:18] tell you that I gave out all that I had
[4:20] to give the church at home was praying
[4:23] for us the family was praying for us and
[4:26] it took a toll because of the pool of
[4:30] the people
[4:33] [Applause]
[4:56] but I received more than I gave because
[5:01] I was able to hear glorious testimonies
[5:04] of the faithfulness of God and many of
[5:08] them 18 years in the making I met people
[5:12] who came to tell me what God had done in
[5:15] their lives 18 years before and why they
[5:19] were where they are today many of them
[5:22] gave thanks to God and credit to our
[5:25] ministry there in that area and all what
[5:29] a blessing what a joy that was to know
[5:31] that when we do something in the will of
[5:35] God for the kingdom of God with his
[5:38] anointing the results can be
[5:40] long-lasting and lives can be changed it
[5:44] was my desire for many years to go back
[5:47] to Kenya but waiting on the perfect
[5:49] timing of the Lord and not only did he
[5:52] reveal to us his timing but he made
[5:55] provision it was not an inexpensive trip
[5:58] but he made provision our little Church
[6:02] in Alabama they stepped up and gave
[6:04] sacrificially not only to send me to
[6:07] minister but to send my two sons with me
[6:11] and I think if you're watching this and
[6:14] you're a parent you will certainly know
[6:16] there's no greater joy than seeing God
[6:19] using your own children for the kingdom
[6:21] and so Africa is on our hearts today
[6:26] we're going to be going back to Ghana in
[6:29] the spring of this year and who knows
[6:33] what else God has but this is a ministry
[6:37] that is also very important to us to be
[6:40] able to come to you on a regular basis
[6:43] and share what is in our hearts I just
[6:46] want you to know that no matter what's
[6:48] going on in your life or what's going on
[6:50] in the world around you
[6:52] God is still good he is still mindful of
[6:56] right where you are what you're going
[6:59] through how you're feeling and whether
[7:02] you recognize it or not he already has a
[7:05] plan to bring youth
[7:07] he does if god's grace brings you to it
[7:11] that same grace will bring you through
[7:14] it i believe that so look to him and
[7:18] understand what a privilege it is to
[7:21] know that somewhere there is a great big
[7:24] God and he's not a million miles away to
[7:27] the believer to the believer we know
[7:29] exactly where he lives he lives in his
[7:33] people and what a joy to know that he
[7:35] has a blueprint my life is not taking
[7:39] him by surprise
[7:40] he knew it as we have been teaching in
[7:44] the first two lessons of this series in
[7:47] the fullness of time today is part three
[7:51] and we'll go back to our original text
[7:54] and we'll read that to refresh your
[7:57] memory and then we'll move forward in
[8:00] the teaching in galatians chapter 4
[8:03] beginning in verse 1 and reading through
[8:06] verse 7 now I say that as that the air
[8:11] as long as he is a child differeth
[8:15] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[8:19] of all but is under tutors and governors
[8:22] until the time appointed of the Father
[8:26] even so we when we were children were in
[8:30] bondage this is spiritually children we
[8:34] were in bondage under the elements of
[8:37] the world but when the fullness of the
[8:42] time was come God sent forth his son
[8:48] made of a woman made under the law to
[8:52] redeem them that were under the law that
[8:56] we might receive the adoption of sons
[9:01] and because he are sons God hath set
[9:07] forth the spirit of his son into your
[9:10] hearts crying Abba Father
[9:14] Papa wherefore thou art no more a
[9:18] servant
[9:19] but a son and if a son then an heir of
[9:25] God through Christ I don't know about
[9:29] you but those words fill me with
[9:33] strength they so encouraged me to know
[9:37] that God has an appointed time for all
[9:42] things
[9:44] and in all things and we all start out
[9:48] in this place of being immature
[9:53] we are teknon is the greek word we are
[9:57] adolescents we are children we have a
[10:00] lot to learn but as we progress in the
[10:05] things of God as we live the journey as
[10:08] we walk the miles we are ever learning
[10:12] we are ever changing and by the promise
[10:16] of God we are ever growing and we not
[10:20] only grow in knowledge and hopefully in
[10:24] wisdom but we grow in authority we are
[10:28] coming to a place where in the eyes of
[10:32] our Father we can be fully trusted to
[10:36] conduct his business on planet Earth I
[10:40] would like to say that in my
[10:42] understanding of the scripture all that
[10:46] has happened up until this hour this
[10:49] last time what we sometimes refer to on
[10:54] this program as the end of the end times
[10:58] I believe that's where we are I'm one of
[11:01] those old-fashioned preachers who still
[11:03] believes that the coming of the Lord
[11:06] Jesus Christ is near at hand I believe
[11:11] that there are some things that are
[11:13] unfolding and taking place now that will
[11:18] accelerate us as sons of God into the
[11:22] finality of our ministry because I
[11:25] believe that everything that has
[11:27] happened up until this point is so that
[11:30] in the last of the last days
[11:32] there would be a company of adopted sons
[11:37] no longer in the immaturity stage but
[11:42] moving from the Technol the way up to
[11:45] the wheels son a fully adopted
[11:49] trustworthy son you know there were
[11:53] things in my life that I thought
[11:56] crippled me but God could use them
[12:00] he could take full advantage of what I
[12:04] felt like was a handicap for instance I
[12:08] didn't grow up in a home with a mother
[12:10] and a father my father was gone and he
[12:14] was absent from my life and many times
[12:18] as a child as a teenager in my early
[12:22] twenties even preparing for marriage at
[12:26] 29 almost 30
[12:28] I felt handicapped in many ways but one
[12:32] of the benefits of that was God was
[12:35] teaching me I didn't learn it overnight
[12:37] in fact I should be transparent and say
[12:41] I'm still learning but I believe the
[12:44] lesson in my life because of what I
[12:46] viewed as a handicap was really God
[12:50] desiring to teach me how to fully depend
[12:55] on him we have a father we have a father
[12:59] who has so loved us who has so known as
[13:04] we talked about in Episode one in two of
[13:07] this series who has so fully known who
[13:10] we are who we will be that the
[13:14] Scriptures have told us that all of our
[13:16] days are numbered that God has seen it
[13:21] all from the beginning Psalm 139 and
[13:25] verse 16 in the complete Jewish Bible
[13:28] said your eyes could see me as an embryo
[13:32] but in your book all my days were
[13:36] already written my days had been shaped
[13:40] before any of them exists
[13:43] it Jeremiah we mentioned him the last
[13:47] time we were together the word of the
[13:49] Lord came to him in in chapter 1 verses
[13:53] 4 & 5 before I formed V in the belly I
[13:56] knew thee and before thou camest forth
[13:59] out of the womb I sanctified thee and I
[14:02] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[14:05] these scriptures give us so much
[14:09] confidence and hope in the God who has
[14:13] called us that before we were ever born
[14:17] while we were yet in our mother's womb
[14:19] he had a purpose for our life a calling
[14:23] on our life for many of us it was a high
[14:26] calling there is no other calling any
[14:30] higher than to be a surrendered servant
[14:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ and to serve
[14:37] him by serving others and he knew that
[14:40] he knew what would be going on in my
[14:43] family he knew that my dad would be
[14:45] absent he knew that my mom would suffer
[14:48] greatly that many things would happen in
[14:51] our lives my parents divorced when I was
[14:54] five years old my mother remarried some
[15:00] time after that it wasn't immediate but
[15:03] sometime after that my mother remarried
[15:06] and she she married a man who had been
[15:10] greatly abused as a child and as a
[15:13] teenager and because he had never come
[15:16] to healing and wholeness through Jesus
[15:19] he knew he had some influences in his
[15:22] life trying to point him in the right
[15:25] direction but he had never found peace
[15:27] in a relationship with the Lord and
[15:30] because of that he passed on the abuse
[15:32] and he mistreated my mother emotionally
[15:36] and he physically abused her in in a
[15:41] bloody way
[15:42] and all of this had such an effect on
[15:46] her life she was not a believer at the
[15:48] time and it certainly had an effect on
[15:51] my life I was not allowed to go to
[15:55] church in those days
[15:57] we moved away from the place that I had
[16:01] been born and that my the rest of my
[16:04] family lived and I remember standing
[16:07] many times at the window on Sunday
[16:10] morning of the second-story apartment
[16:11] where we lived
[16:13] watching the church bus that was in the
[16:15] days where churches still had bus
[16:17] ministry and I can see those children
[16:20] it's strange but I can see them now in
[16:24] my mind getting on that church bus to go
[16:27] to Sunday school and the tears running
[16:29] down my face because I so desperately
[16:32] wanted to be in the presence of the Lord
[16:35] God had already done something in my
[16:37] life at an early age and I wanted to be
[16:40] a part of what was going on on the other
[16:43] end of that bus route but God was
[16:46] shaping it and as I stood there's many
[16:49] many times tears streaming down my face
[16:52] his presence would come to me sometimes
[16:56] his voice would speak to me in my inner
[16:59] heart I would know that it was him and
[17:01] he would let me know somehow sometimes
[17:05] again I'm not ashamed to say it was by
[17:08] an inner voice sometimes it was by an
[17:11] inner feeling I just knew that God was
[17:14] going to turn things around in my life
[17:17] and in my mother's life and he was
[17:20] faithful to do that so there was pain in
[17:25] every life I think there are probably no
[17:29] ideal childhoods you know there's
[17:33] something even if you live in a
[17:34] beautiful home where there are two
[17:37] parents sometimes there are still people
[17:41] are human and mistakes are made and and
[17:43] we all have things that wound us deeply
[17:47] but I want you to know that God saw it
[17:51] he saw it before it ever happened and I
[17:55] think we've discussed on this program
[17:57] more than once well if God saw that it
[18:00] was going to be bad then why didn't he
[18:02] just stop it well I want you to know
[18:05] that many things that happen to us in
[18:07] our life God didn't create them they
[18:10] were created
[18:11] in my choices and decisions that either
[18:14] we made are those responsible for us
[18:17] made and we make choices and there are
[18:20] repercussions there are consequences by
[18:24] our choices and by our decisions and
[18:27] therefore there things that happen in
[18:30] our life that are beyond our control and
[18:32] God has chosen not to control every
[18:38] aspect of our lives we have a free will
[18:41] to choose him to choose what is right
[18:45] over what is wrong and so okay we can
[18:50] say why didn't he stop it because he
[18:53] didn't create it but he knew it I want
[18:58] you to understand he didn't make it
[19:00] happen he didn't create that situation
[19:04] but he knew it was coming in his
[19:08] foreknowledge did he allow it he allowed
[19:11] it yes I would have to say he did but
[19:15] for a far greater purpose in you than
[19:19] you can understand without the help of
[19:22] the Holy Spirit and our human
[19:24] understanding
[19:25] we will wallow in the pain of the past
[19:29] but when the Spirit of the Lord begins
[19:32] to to connect the dots or put the pieces
[19:35] of the puzzle together and show us what
[19:39] what we need to do sometime is allow the
[19:42] Lord to walk with us by the Spirit
[19:45] through those dark moments of our life I
[19:49] think everyone watching this program is
[19:52] familiar with the poem footprints and
[19:56] you know it's the truth perhaps it's
[20:00] something that's been used to so much
[20:02] and painted about and sung about and
[20:05] expressed so often in greeting cards and
[20:09] posters on the wall that that it's
[20:11] become so common that we forget the
[20:13] power of the truth but a man had a dream
[20:18] and in that dream he saw footprints on
[20:22] the sand
[20:25] and he saw that there were events in his
[20:29] life that he could look in and see and
[20:32] it seemed that in the darkest moments of
[20:36] his life instead of there being two sets
[20:40] of footprints there was only one and
[20:43] then there would be other times that he
[20:45] could clearly see in life things were
[20:48] better and there were two sets of
[20:51] footprints walking in the sand and he
[20:54] complained to the Lord like all of us
[20:56] have I mean let's be real
[20:58] we've all said Lord where are you have
[21:02] you forgotten me and he complained to
[21:05] the Lord as the as the poem goes and he
[21:10] said Lord why is it that in the times
[21:12] that I needed you the most you left me
[21:15] it's clear to me there's only one set of
[21:18] footprints I don't know where you were
[21:20] but you were not with me and I need an
[21:23] answer I need an explanation for why
[21:26] there were only one set of footprints in
[21:29] the sand and the and the Lord just
[21:31] replied that is not because I left you
[21:36] it's not because I forsook you it's not
[21:38] because I didn't know what was going on
[21:40] in your life and I left you to do it by
[21:43] yourself it's because I picked you up
[21:46] and I was carrying you in those darkest
[21:51] moments you were over my shoulder I knew
[21:55] that you couldn't make it by yourself I
[21:58] knew that your strength was gone I knew
[22:00] that you were to the point of giving up
[22:02] and I knew the only thing that I could
[22:04] do for you was to pick you up and carry
[22:06] you through those deep dark valleys
[22:10] through that awful pain and grief and
[22:14] loss that's why there's only one set of
[22:17] footprints because I was carrying you
[22:20] and I don't know if that's become so
[22:22] common that it can no longer minister to
[22:24] you but I'll tell you what it's still
[22:26] ministers to me and I believe it with
[22:29] everything that I am and and we need
[22:32] that experience sometime to walk back
[22:35] through life we
[22:37] the Lord with the help of the spirit
[22:39] don't do it by yourself because you
[22:42] you'll get caught up in the pain of the
[22:44] past but if you just say Lord would you
[22:46] show me would you walk through some of
[22:48] those memories with me and show me some
[22:51] of the ways that you were helping me and
[22:55] how that situation has shaped me and
[23:00] molded me in such a way that you could
[23:02] redeem the pain of it you could use the
[23:07] lessons that I learned maybe I didn't
[23:10] even know I was learning anything I was
[23:12] just in survival mode but now I can
[23:15] recognize by the grace of God I was
[23:18] learning something I was being prepared
[23:21] I was really sitting under tutors and
[23:25] life was teaching me something that I
[23:28] would need to be able to be so yielded
[23:32] to God in the end and and ultimately
[23:36] dependent on him if we can come to that
[23:41] understanding that if we accomplished
[23:44] anything good in our life it is because
[23:49] he has done it in us and through us it
[23:55] is not because we are clever or handsome
[24:00] intelligent well-educated trained in the
[24:04] social graces of life it's because we
[24:07] have somehow learned to yield to the
[24:10] Creator to the one who loves us the most
[24:14] who knows us the best and loves us the
[24:17] most and he's using these things to
[24:21] promote us you say well I'll tell you
[24:24] brothers Yeley
[24:25] it doesn't always feel like a promotion
[24:27] well that's just like any discipline
[24:30] that you go through any any any real
[24:33] teaching moment that you go through it
[24:36] doesn't feel good at the moment
[24:38] you know the Bible talks about the
[24:40] chastening of the Lord and I know that
[24:42] the church today they don't want to talk
[24:44] about the fact that sometimes we get we
[24:47] get chastened we get dealt with
[24:51] but it's not because god wants to
[24:53] destroy you or break you and leave you
[24:56] hopeless it's because he wants to teach
[24:58] you the importance of totally leaning on
[25:03] him and allowing him to live his life
[25:08] through you oh if the church at large
[25:13] could understand that's what grace is
[25:17] it's not God turning the other way and
[25:21] refusing to see the mistakes the sin
[25:24] that we commit but it's God loving us so
[25:28] much that he is always present to help
[25:32] us when we call to forgive us when we
[25:36] ask and to redeem the situation to take
[25:41] us all the way back to God's original
[25:44] thoughts about us in the beginning so in
[25:48] the first two episodes of this series we
[25:51] covered so many scriptures that talk
[25:55] about God knowing and God being aware
[25:59] and God having foreknowledge and I am so
[26:04] thankful that he does and that he did
[26:08] when we ended the last program we were
[26:11] in first John chapter 4 verses 12 and 13
[26:14] no man had seen God at any time if we
[26:19] love one another god dwelleth in US and
[26:22] his love is perfected in us there are
[26:27] some things that we have been made aware
[26:30] of there are some things that we have
[26:33] experienced in a token in a measure that
[26:39] must now be perfected in us and love is
[26:43] one of those things there is a perfect
[26:46] love there is a love perfected and that
[26:50] love is higher than than the phileo love
[26:55] the human love one for another
[26:57] it's the agapo it's it's the God love
[27:01] it's the perfect love
[27:03] and the truth is that when love is
[27:07] perfected in us we can love as God loves
[27:10] are you there brother Shelly I didn't
[27:13] say I was there but I'm on the journey I
[27:16] know that God is allowing things in my
[27:20] life to bring me to the place that his
[27:23] love can be perfected in me what is your
[27:27] what is your attitude about that well
[27:29] I'll tell you my attitude is bring it on
[27:32] Lord it's not always what I want it's
[27:35] not always with circumstances that I
[27:38] would choose but if it will allow me to
[27:42] be more yielded so that the things that
[27:46] you have started in my life can also be
[27:49] perfected and finished then I'm willing
[27:52] because if God allows you to walk
[27:55] through it remember he's already seen
[27:57] the other end and he knows that if you
[28:02] keep leaning on him he'll carry you when
[28:05] you can't carry yourself and you'll find
[28:08] that his love his grace his mercy his
[28:12] virtues are being perfected in you verse
[28:16] 13 hereby know we that dwell in him and
[28:20] he in us because he had given us of his
[28:26] spirit don't ever forget that by the
[28:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit we have
[28:33] received the Spirit of Jesus Christ the
[28:38] very spirit that was in his body in his
[28:42] earthly ministry that is the very same
[28:46] spirit that now dwells in us that makes
[28:50] us alive not physically alive but
[28:55] spiritually abundantly alive God had a
[28:59] plan we've talked about his plan for our
[29:03] lives but remember that he was the Great
[29:06] Architect from the beginning in the mind
[29:09] of God a blueprint was developed a
[29:13] thought many many many
[29:18] about humanity about the world about the
[29:22] amount of time and what would need to be
[29:25] happening in the earth before God could
[29:30] become man before the eternal spirit of
[29:34] the father could condescend into a body
[29:39] of flesh as John chapter 1 tells us in
[29:43] the beginning was the word and the Word
[29:45] was with God and the Word was God he
[29:48] later says in that chapter and the word
[29:52] became flesh that couldn't happen just
[29:55] any time it didn't happen in the days of
[29:59] Noah in the days of Abraham in the days
[30:01] of Elijah in the days of Isaiah even in
[30:05] the days of Malachi the last prophet
[30:08] that we read of in the Old Testament
[30:11] everything had to be lined up in God's
[30:15] mind and then he watched the earth so
[30:21] that when everything that needed to come
[30:24] into place would come into place he then
[30:29] knew that it was the fullness of time
[30:33] and in the fullness of time God sent
[30:37] forth his son into the world thanks be
[30:43] to God
[30:43] a way was made first the plan the
[30:49] blueprint was developed and then God in
[30:52] his mind made a way to accomplish his
[30:56] plans all of this was determined before
[30:59] the foundation of the world God's
[31:02] provided way the way that he would
[31:05] choose to bring salvation and redemption
[31:07] to the earth that was not an
[31:09] afterthought remember that was not
[31:12] somehow a reaction to what Lucifer had
[31:16] accomplished through the serpent in the
[31:18] garden no it was rather something that
[31:21] God had in his mind from the very
[31:25] beginning I just don't believe that the
[31:29] God of the by
[31:31] and the god I serve has been running
[31:33] around for over 6,000 years a few steps
[31:37] behind the devil and always trying to
[31:40] find out how to react to what the enemy
[31:43] does that's not the God of the Bible
[31:45] that's not the god I serve the God of
[31:48] the Bible knew from the beginning
[31:50] exactly how things were going to happen
[31:53] in the Garden of Eden and before there
[31:56] was a fall there was already a plan for
[31:59] restoration before there was a sin there
[32:02] was already a plan for the forgiveness
[32:04] of sin before man ever recognized what
[32:09] it really means to have fellowship with
[32:12] the Creator it was already in the mind
[32:14] of God to give us from the day of
[32:17] Pentecost forward a full baptism of the
[32:21] very same spirit that would live in the
[32:23] life and body of Jesus Christ none of
[32:26] these things were after thoughts the
[32:28] church ages of history as we know it
[32:31] that wasn't a part of God's afterthought
[32:34] oh no he thought it in the beginning and
[32:36] and each time you know many times down
[32:41] through these ages from the book of
[32:43] Genesis forward there are those moments
[32:47] we call them Chi heroes moments when
[32:52] things really come into a junction and
[32:55] God shows up in such a profound way and
[33:00] of course there was no greater junction
[33:02] in time than the one that happened in
[33:05] little Bethlehem when God became a man
[33:10] of flesh in Hebrews chapter 4 verses 3 &
[33:15] 4 it reads for we which have believed do
[33:20] enter into rest as he said as I have
[33:25] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[33:27] into my rest although the works were
[33:31] finished from the foundation of the
[33:34] world for he spake in a certain place of
[33:37] the seventh day on this wise and God did
[33:41] arrest the seventh day
[33:43] from all his works these are wonderful
[33:46] verses of Scripture in Hebrews chapter 3
[33:49] and chapter 4 where we learn about a
[33:53] rest that is promised to the people of
[33:56] God where we learn that it becomes
[33:59] necessary for us to sit under the word
[34:02] and then take our faith our contribution
[34:06] in this equation is faith to join our
[34:10] faith with the Word of God
[34:13] to let every cell of our body and every
[34:16] fiber of our being say Amen I fully
[34:21] trust God and I fully trust what he says
[34:25] and if he promised that he is faithful
[34:28] to do it and remember that God was angry
[34:33] with the children of Israel there was
[34:35] wrath involved because he gave them the
[34:37] opportunity to enter into rest and
[34:40] rather they they chose to quarrel and
[34:44] they chose to murmur and they chose to
[34:46] complain and so the Bible tells us in
[34:49] those same chapters even though the the
[34:52] glorious marvelous Word of God that was
[34:56] being delivered to them in that
[34:58] generation by the prophet Moses it could
[35:02] not have the full effect in their life
[35:05] in fact the Bible said it profited them
[35:08] little and why the answer was because it
[35:13] was not mixed with faith and God is
[35:16] speaking through the Apostle Paul to the
[35:20] to the Hebrew believers and this little
[35:23] phrase is stuck right in the middle of
[35:25] this admonition he said although the
[35:27] works were finished from before the
[35:30] foundation of the world
[35:32] the way was already made for the people
[35:34] of God to enter into the rest but it was
[35:38] not time and so what God did is he gave
[35:43] us from the book of Genesis all the way
[35:45] up to the coming of the Messiah tokens
[35:48] of rest tokens of rest the Shabbat the
[35:53] Sabbath was a sign
[35:56] token of rest God rested ceased from his
[36:03] labor to show us this amazing picture of
[36:09] God providing a perfect rest for those
[36:14] who would trust in him it's more than a
[36:17] nap on Saturday afternoon it was a state
[36:22] of mind it was a place it was it's
[36:26] really a realm it's really a dimension
[36:30] in the spirit Sabbath rest it's marked
[36:34] on the earth by a day but really it's a
[36:39] person and that person is the Lord Jesus
[36:42] Christ and the Bride of Christ the sons
[36:46] of God the sons of the kingdom that are
[36:50] being raised up in this hour to come
[36:52] into true union and real fellowship with
[36:56] him we will be the demonstrations of
[36:59] this kind of rest and this rest was not
[37:04] made available until Jesus came as the
[37:07] Messiah to give us total rest but the
[37:11] scripture said here these works were
[37:13] finished from the foundation of the
[37:16] world can I just say God's got this we
[37:20] need to trust him he's been working on
[37:23] this a long time well youth youth look
[37:27] around you you watch the news and you
[37:29] say huh this is out of control I want
[37:31] you to know God is allowing the heathen
[37:34] to rage God is allowing the world to
[37:38] come into this place of chaos but he
[37:41] gets the last say he gets the last move
[37:45] on the chessboard of life I'm telling
[37:48] you right now he has a plan to race up a
[37:52] people that will show forth the great
[37:56] grace of Jesus Christ as it has never
[38:00] been shown because he showed it as one
[38:05] man on the day of Pentecost the same
[38:08] life that was in here
[38:10] was multiplied and distributed to 120
[38:13] and then the spirit of religion began to
[38:16] work and what God tried to bring what
[38:20] God was bringing to pass what he was
[38:22] doing on the day of Pentecost it was
[38:24] only a matter of time before man began
[38:27] to water down that experience and divide
[38:30] among themselves because of dogmas and
[38:33] creeds and religious philosophies and
[38:36] ideas and it has taken the entirety of
[38:39] the church ages to bring us all the way
[38:42] back to the restoration of all things
[38:45] and we are now living in the time of the
[38:48] restoration of all things and there's no
[38:51] reason not one reason whatsoever that a
[38:55] bride cannot now step forward in the
[38:59] fullness of what God has called her for
[39:01] from before the foundation of the world
[39:04] the only thing that's causing delay is
[39:07] you and I and we can choose today I'm
[39:10] not gonna be responsible for the delay
[39:12] anymore I'm gonna fully yield my life to
[39:16] all that God has called me for I don't
[39:19] yet know you may not yet know the
[39:22] fullness of your purpose on this earth
[39:24] through the years God has revealed to me
[39:27] just a little tiny pieces of why I'm
[39:29] here and I hold on to them every day I
[39:32] would say almost every day they come to
[39:35] my mind but I don't yet know the
[39:38] fullness of my reason for being here but
[39:41] I want to know and I know that you don't
[39:43] find out by reading the paper and you
[39:45] don't find out by watching most of
[39:47] what's on television you only find out
[39:50] by spending more time in His Word and
[39:53] more time leaning on him that's my
[39:57] advice to discover who you are in him in
[40:00] Acts chapter 15 and verse 18 the Bible
[40:03] said known unto God are all his works
[40:07] from the beginning of the world
[40:10] everything that God has ever done and
[40:14] everything that God is ever going to do
[40:17] it was already in his mind from the big
[40:23] of the world now that is the truth that
[40:27] will stagger you until you come to the
[40:31] revelation of the beautiful sovereignty
[40:35] of God and then here are two verses of
[40:39] Scripture that I think are important one
[40:43] is revelation 13 verse 8 where it reads
[40:46] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[40:49] worship Him and it's referring to the
[40:52] Beast whose names are not written in the
[40:57] book of life of the lamb slain from the
[41:01] foundation of the world the book of the
[41:06] revelation is talking about those who
[41:09] will receive the system of the Beast
[41:13] they will receive the Ministry of the
[41:17] Antichrist and the false prophet and why
[41:20] will they do that because their names
[41:24] are not found written in the Lamb's Book
[41:27] of Life the book of Redemption from the
[41:30] foundation of the world am I to believe
[41:33] that these people had no choice no
[41:36] that's not what the scripture is saying
[41:38] to us at all
[41:40] the scripture reveals that they had like
[41:43] you and I a choice but in God's
[41:45] foreknowledge he saw that they would not
[41:50] choose do you know that this is
[41:52] mind-blowing it really is to think that
[41:57] even at the end of the end there will be
[42:01] those who will not ultimately choose to
[42:07] surrender their lives to the Creator the
[42:10] one who breathed life into them it is
[42:15] mind-blowing you would think that at the
[42:18] end of the and that's why the church has
[42:20] tried to come up with all kinds of
[42:22] little crafty ideas and doctrines and
[42:25] and whatever to teach us ultimate
[42:29] reconciliation and that in the end every
[42:32] person will be saved
[42:34] didn't have to die the way he died the
[42:37] scriptures are clear there will be those
[42:39] lost there are those in Hell right now
[42:43] and there will be many many others who
[42:46] will go to hell not because they didn't
[42:49] have a choice but because they made the
[42:53] wrong choice and because God knew their
[42:56] choice from before the beginning of the
[42:59] foundations of the earth
[43:00] many of them whose names were written in
[43:04] the book of life the book that records
[43:07] all human life on the earth they were
[43:11] never written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[43:13] or as the scripture says in Revelation
[43:16] 13 and 8 whose names are not written in
[43:20] the book of life of the Lamb we call it
[43:25] the Lamb's Book of Life
[43:26] in the Lamb's Book of Life are written
[43:30] the names of those who in their lives
[43:33] will choose to serve the Lord some from
[43:37] early ages some in their middle age some
[43:40] at the end of life but all that will
[43:43] choose to serve the Lord
[43:45] their names are recorded there and then
[43:49] another verse similar is Revelation
[43:51] chapter 17 and verse 8 the Beast that
[43:55] thou sawest was and is not and shall
[43:59] ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[44:03] into perdition and they that dwell on
[44:06] the earth shall wonder whose names were
[44:10] not written in the book of life from the
[44:13] foundation of the world see these names
[44:17] not only was the lamb as we read in
[44:20] Revelation 13 and 8 the lamb was slain I
[44:24] know that history teaches us and it is
[44:30] true that 2000 years ago the Lord Jesus
[44:33] Christ lived and died on a hill just
[44:37] outside the city of Jerusalem that was
[44:40] the that was the fulfillment and that
[44:42] was the reality and that was from the
[44:45] moment the point of origin
[44:47] where we could claim that sacrifice we
[44:51] could claim that death according to the
[44:53] Apostle Paul we can claim that death as
[44:56] our own death we can claim that
[44:59] suffering as our own suffering and we
[45:02] can claim his resurrection as our own
[45:06] resurrection or if that same spirit that
[45:10] raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[45:12] it shall also quicken or make alive not
[45:18] only your spirit man but one day your
[45:21] mortal body even though it may have been
[45:24] laid in the ground there is a
[45:27] resurrection and so this Lamb we know
[45:31] 2,000 years of church history but we
[45:34] understand from the scripture that in
[45:36] the mind of God the lamb was slain
[45:39] before there was an atom before there
[45:42] was a garden east of eden and before the
[45:45] world before he spoke let there be light
[45:48] in the mind of God the lamb was already
[45:51] slain oh how I love this I can't help it
[45:55] I love this God has a plan for planet
[46:03] Earth and he always has and he always
[46:06] will
[46:07] before there was a sinner there was a
[46:11] savior before there was a sick person
[46:14] there was a healer it was already
[46:18] provided for in the mind of God won't
[46:21] you serve Him
[46:23] can I ask you won't you serve God won't
[46:28] you surrender everything that you are
[46:30] and follow Jesus Christ the lamb slain
[46:36] from the foundation of the world
[46:38] so in Revelation 13 and 8 we see the
[46:41] lamb slain from the foundation of the of
[46:44] the world and then in revelation 17 and
[46:46] 8 we we read about those whose names
[46:49] were not written in the book of life
[46:52] from the foundation of the world which
[46:54] leads us to believe that from the
[46:56] foundation
[46:57] of the world there were names if these
[47:01] are those in 17/8 if these are those
[47:04] whose names were not written I want to
[47:07] know about those whose names were
[47:09] written and I'm glad to say today I'm
[47:12] one of them how could you make such a
[47:15] statement because I know it by the
[47:17] spirit it has been revealed to me that I
[47:21] am one of them whose names was found
[47:24] written not because I deserved anything
[47:27] but because God looked ahead before I
[47:31] was ever born and he knew that I would
[47:33] choose him and I have and I'm going to
[47:38] choose him tomorrow and I'm going to
[47:39] choose him the next day and I'm going to
[47:42] keep on choosing him because it's only
[47:45] in knowing him that we have real life
[47:48] and real peace and real joy we knowed in
[47:54] the scripture that 4000 years
[47:56] approximately before Jesus came Yeshua
[48:00] was born God gave Adam the first
[48:03] prophecy concerning the coming of the
[48:07] Messiah
[48:07] but it took 4000 years for that prophecy
[48:11] to come to pass and I'll read it to you
[48:14] and it's it's beautiful because from the
[48:19] beginning God was letting it be known
[48:22] I've got away this thing is gonna turn
[48:25] around there may be many times in
[48:28] history that if you're standing off
[48:31] observing you may think that Satan is
[48:34] winning you may think that death
[48:37] prevails but I want you to know that at
[48:40] the end of the end of the end the one
[48:44] who's heals is going to crush the head
[48:48] of the seed of the serpent that one is
[48:52] going to in the fullness of time that
[48:56] one is going to come I'm a little
[48:59] excited Genesis chapter 3 verses 14 and
[49:03] 15 the first messianic prophecy recorded
[49:07] in the Holy Scripture and the Lord God
[49:10] said in
[49:11] to the serpent because thou hast done
[49:14] this thou art cursed above all cattle
[49:17] and above every beast of the field and
[49:19] upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust
[49:22] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
[49:26] now let's remind ourselves what did the
[49:29] serpent do that he received such a curse
[49:31] he yielded himself he allowed Lucifer
[49:36] Satan to step into his body and to use
[49:40] him and I want you to know this sounds
[49:43] like a you know an unusual circumstance
[49:46] here but it still happens today this was
[49:51] a beast of the field but men and women
[49:54] today still yield themselves for the
[49:59] spirit of evil for for the devil himself
[50:02] to operate in their lives not just
[50:05] through witchcraft not just through
[50:08] Satanism but anytime that we allow the
[50:12] enemy to win instead of yielding to our
[50:17] creator's will for our lives we're being
[50:20] used you know you're being used all the
[50:24] time of something
[50:27] let it be God your Creator the one who
[50:30] loves you the most don't yield your
[50:32] members to sin the Apostle Paul said
[50:35] don't yield your members to unbelief but
[50:39] possess the reins of your mind choose
[50:42] what is holy what is virtuous what is
[50:47] beautiful what is perfect and refuse
[50:50] that which is of the enemy and the
[50:53] serpent yielded himself his body even
[50:56] occupied by Satan and he paid a price
[51:00] because before this moment the serpent
[51:03] he didn't look like the snake he walked
[51:06] upright he was a beast perhaps very much
[51:09] like a man but now he's going to crawl
[51:13] on his belly and eat dust all the days
[51:16] of his life and verse 15 and I will put
[51:20] enmity between thee and the woman
[51:24] and between thy seed and her seed the
[51:29] seed of the Serpent and the seed of the
[51:32] woman it shall bruise thy head and thou
[51:39] shalt bruise his heel evil Satan
[51:46] darkness would surely take ahold of the
[51:50] heel of the seed of a woman but don't
[51:54] you think for one moment that was the
[51:56] end of the story
[51:58] if Jesus the Apostle tells us really
[52:02] like this if Jesus would have only died
[52:05] for the sins of mankind and remained in
[52:09] the grave much of what we believe much
[52:13] of what we hope much of what we stand on
[52:16] would all be in vain but thanks be to
[52:20] God he didn't just stay there
[52:24] there was a plan and three days later he
[52:29] conquered death hell and the grave
[52:32] perhaps Satan thought I've done it I
[52:35] have killed the Savior but all let me
[52:39] tell you something he wasn't able to
[52:41] keep him or to hold him because Jesus
[52:45] came forth from the grave victorious
[52:49] over sin over death over hell and over
[52:54] the grave and he holds the key in his
[52:57] hand I'm so thankful for that and I'm so
[53:01] thankful that even though the enemy was
[53:03] allowed to to bruise the heel of the
[53:09] seed of the woman he was not able to
[53:13] change God's plan of provision for
[53:17] planet Earth because ultimately he got
[53:20] his head bruised I like to say crushed I
[53:24] like to say that our Lord Jesus Christ
[53:28] put his foot on the enemy on death on
[53:33] Hell on the grave it was only through
[53:37] this
[53:37] sinless son of man that full atonement
[53:42] could be made for man's sin but the law
[53:46] of sin and death for disobedience to
[53:49] God's law it had to be broken and the
[53:52] only way that it could be broken was by
[53:54] a sinless man a sinless one and that was
[54:00] our Lord Jesus Christ though he was
[54:03] tempted in all manner even as we are yet
[54:07] without sin the Old Testament teaches of
[54:13] an offering a sacrifice to be made
[54:16] before the Lord and it must be a
[54:19] blameless Lamb it must be a spotless
[54:24] lamb without flaw without blemish so
[54:29] examined by by the rabbi the priests so
[54:34] examined that a few discoloured hairs a
[54:40] crooked leg could disqualify that
[54:43] offering but our lamb the Lamb of God
[54:48] slain before the foundation of the world
[54:51] came in purity and holiness in a sinless
[54:56] life of perfection though tempted in his
[55:00] body of flesh he overcame and you and I
[55:05] can also overcome because he did so we
[55:10] have an atonement that has been made
[55:12] thank God not only friend has our sins
[55:16] have they all been covered by the blood
[55:19] of the Lamb but I'm thankful for the
[55:22] revelation of remittance they have been
[55:26] remitted we are fully justified by faith
[55:30] in the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:32] just if I'd never sinned he has removed
[55:37] my sin he has removed your sin if you're
[55:41] walking in a state of repentance before
[55:44] him so far away farther than the East is
[55:48] from the way
[55:49] he has cast them there drowned in the
[55:52] sea of God's forgetfulness never to be
[55:55] remembered against you any more praise
[55:58] be to God and now we can live a life of
[56:03] hope and victory and promise no matter
[56:06] what's going on no matter what our life
[56:09] looks like no matter what the world
[56:11] around us looks like we know we know who
[56:15] this is
[56:16] living inside father in the name of the
[56:19] Lord Jesus Christ I want to thank you

[56:36] in their hearts that you will reassure
[56:40] us again and again that you are
[56:43] sovereign that you have a blueprint that
[56:46] you have a plan and that you are willing
[56:49] you are able you are ready to guide us
[56:53] through every obstacle of life you have
[56:57] won the victory
[56:59] you are the overcomer and because you
[57:02] have overcome we can also overcome Lord
[57:05] I pray for the sick and the afflicted
[57:07] you are the healer you not only purchase
[57:11] salvation and redemption but you in your
[57:14] atonement you purchased healing and
[57:16] health and deliverance from disease and
[57:20] from lying symptoms and I pray right now
[57:24] for those who are sick and infirmed
[57:26] that you will minister and manifest your
[57:29] healing virtue to them in the precious
[57:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray for
[57:35] the prayer requests that have come in
[57:37] and those that will come in that you
[57:40] will move in such a way that only you
[57:42] can receive the glory Lord I know you
[57:45] use men and I know you work in
[57:47] circumstances but father I pray that
[57:50] you'll move in such a way that we will
[57:52] all recognize that it was you and that
[57:56] we will be like the few who came back
[57:58] and said thank you thank you thank you

[58:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[58:25] for his glory amen
