Description:
In the Old Testament God was very specific on how He wanted His dwelling place built and gave detailed instructions on how everything was to be structured. We believe that He no longer dwells in tents and temples but His desire is to inhabit a people, the Bride of Christ, and that she follow His divine pattern for how He wants His “temple” built today!

========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I'm coming to you from the New Hope Revival ministries in Smith Alabama USA and I count it a great honor and a great privilege to be able to come into your home or wherever you may be watching this broadcast and speak to you about the wonderful things of God's word I am grateful for these Christian television networks that God is using in marvelous ways to bring the truth to bring instruction to bring help to the nations of the world and I would like to ask you to pray for these networks that God will not only uh Prosper them that he will not only provide for their needs but that he will expand them that they will be able to reach out in into farther reaches so that more people can hear the gospel message in this hour I'd also like to invite you to contact us on our ministry website by email our website is revival. org and you can send us an email through the website or you can turn in your prayer request or any questions or comments that you might have there's some good reading material available for free on the website and uh I just like to be in touch with you I'd like to know where you are what your name is and where you're watching this program it would be a great blessing we're are a small group of Bible Believers in Alabama and we believe in the power of prayer and we're praying that God will use this broadcast to speak into your life so if you could if you feel like you can then contact us it would be a real joy to be able to hear from you we're at part four in a study on God's pattern how he measures Us in this hour I'm so thankful that we're not being measured by men's opinions of us I'm grateful that we are being measured by God's word and in our own strength we realize that we could never measure up but because of what he has done on our behalf and because of what he is presently doing in our Inner Man transforming us into His Image then we can measure up to God's standard in this hour let's get right back into the study shall we we were reading in Exodus concerning the Tabernacle and the temple the dimensions the requirements for the material that things were to be made of even the color God even chose the color for the curtains for the for the veils of the Tabernacle God is a meticulous God it helps me to understand that he cares about even the smallest detail in my life and uh that's a blessing to know that nothing happens to me that the Lord is not very much aware of and it must bring Comfort to your heart as well to know that wherever you are in the world you may feel isolated you may feel cut off from the body of Christ at large but you are not alone you are not hidden there God knows you and he knows your need and all you have to do is call on him and he's as close as the mention of his name we also were reading in the Book of Revelation about the instruction that God gave John to measure the temple The Altar and the worshippers so I think we've clearly established the fact that we are under the measuring Rod of the Lord even in this hour um we might could say it like one of the prophets said we are we are being weighed in the balance and found wanting um I truly believe that God is is weighing his bride his body in this hour and that we are not Measuring Up in the way that we should but I do believe that there is a glorious work that's going on on the inside the word is working mightily in us and we are being transformed there is a deep calling to the Deep that's what's going on inside of us right now and little by little step by step we are being changed from glory to glory from Faith to Faith from strength to strength what a wonderful promise we have uh as we have said before if we were left to figure it out on our own we'd just sit down stare at each other and scratch our head we wouldn't even know where to start try to discover what pleases God but he so graciously gave us this word with a little study in history you'll find out that men and women lost their lives to get us this word this written record of God's word many were persecuted and tortured to to preserve this word or because they uh went to such Extreme Measures to to bring us this written record of God's word so I love the Bible I do uh it it Grieves me deeply to see people butcher it try to make it fit their own thoughts to trim away some of the precious truths of God's word to make the Bible fit modern culture or modern society um in my nation in the United States people are being lambasted they're being laughed and at and persecuted for even saying what the Bible says about modern culture or Society or about a lifestyle that that may not be pleasing to God uh and and to speak about it publicly people are being ridiculed they're called bigots and legalists and Prejudiced and haters and uh but I want you to know uh it doesn't matter what what's being said God is going to have a people who will stand for the word no matter what the cost I'd like to go on just a little bit further in this study and I'd like to talk to you about something that was taking place in Ezra the book of Ezra chapter 8 the book of Ezra tells us about the the coming back of the Exiles to Babylon I think most of you remember that Israel was divided at one point into two kingdoms the northern kingdom and the southern Kingdom Israel and Judah Israel was taken captive the northern kingdom was taken captive by the Assyrians and sometime later many years later the southern kingdom was taken captive by the Babylonians and and some 70 years that were spent in Babylonian captivity and it was because of men like zerubabel and Ezra and Nehemiah uh that a that a shift began to take place and the Exiles began to return home in Ezra uh chapter 8 uh Ezra has received a word from the Lord to gather the people together and to number them for the journey and the Bible tells us that some 50 ,000 people and that's not many considering how many thousands were taken away in the Exile of the Southern Kingdom but about 50,000 people gathered at the river in Ezra chapter 8 to be numbered of the Lord to prepare for the journey to go home to the land of Israel and to the to the city of Jerusalem of course we know from the from uh reading about Nehemiah and and and we we read about the the awful condition the Fallen condition of the city and so forth but God was faithful and we know that the walls of the city of Jerusalem were restored we read about in the book of Nehemiah the gates were restored and and a beautiful work of restoration took place but in Ezra chapter 8 50,000 people are gathered at the river and let's look at verse 15 and I gathered them together to the river that runneth to to ahava and there Abode we intense three days and I viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of Levi this was very sad because all 12 tribes were to be represented in this return because uh after the this may be more detailed than you're after right now but after the Exile of the northern kingdom into a Syria uh there was a steady stream of captives after the Assyrian Empire was destroyed there was a steady stream of of those who had been taken captive that made their way back into Israel to the South so in the southern Kingdom by the time of the Babylonian exile there were all 12 tribes represented in the southern Kingdom of Israel what we call Judah and so all 12 tribes were to be represented in this and especially the Levites now now who were the Levites let's remember well Levi was one of the 12 sons of Jacob Joshua 21 speaks about the 48 cities that were inhabited by the sons of Levi you'll remember you Bible students will remember that when the land was divided up after Canaan was conquered that all of the tribes were given an inheritance a a portion a parcel of land allotted to their tribe except the sons of Levi that specific division of the priesthood they were given cities but not areas of land and so in Joshua 21 we read about the 48 levitical cities the cities that were to be inhabited by the sons of Levi we also know that when the Tabernacle in the wilderness was in place that the sons of Levi camped closest to the Tabernacle they surrounded the Tabernacle when it moved and it was their responsibility we read in Joshua 3: 3 and 4 it was the responsibility of the sons of Levi to carry the Ark of the Covenant at when when they made that Crossing at the Jordan River you'll remember in Joshua chapter 3 so the Levites were given a specific responsibility to maintain the cords and the curtains the poles the boards the bars the badger skins and even the sacred Furniture of the Tabernacle these guys had a lot of Duty had a lot of responsibility and then in Deuteronomy 33:9 and 10 it tells us that they were to be teachers that they were to teach Jacob the judgments the ordinances and the laws of God look what an important responsibility they had there it wasn't just keeping up with the furniture and the instruments they also had had to be Guardians of the instructions of God the ordinances the laws and the judgments of God in 2 Chronicles chap 17 and verse 9 uh it says they taught in Judah that's the southern Kingdom they traveled teaching the laws of God that is what constituted the message for that hour what the Levites taught they were teaching the people how to apply the Torah the instruction of God to to to Modern Life to their present situation but when it finally came time for the Exiles to leave Babylon to go home to the land of promise where are the Levites they didn't show up Ezra tells us where are the sons of Levi the holy priesthood of God we have everything and everyone else but the Levites didn't show up I'm telling you that's the hour that we're living in right now there are not not enough men of God there are not enough women of God in the world who are rising up in this hour as the Levites to guard the holy things to guard the sacred things of God to place value on what God has valued to love what God loves to hate what God hates to help teach the people about the measurements of the Lord what God is looking for for in a bride in this hour I think every young man out there when he begins to think about his wife he has a list in his mind of the things that he would like to have in a bride perhaps every young lady does the same thing I don't know how many things on your list you had to to compromise or to give up on uh when you finally found the one that God had chosen for you but I pray that you found the perfect will of God and even if it didn't mark off every uh everything on the list I pray that she's exactly what God wanted for you and he's exactly what God wanted for you but it's all right for us to have some idea of what we would like to have in life I had to give up very very little on my list I always wanted a wife who played the piano and my wife doesn't play the piano but she does a lot of wonderful things other than playing the piano but God has a list and he gives us the list list really it's not a secret list he gives us the list in his word of what he is looking for in a bride but if we don't have the sons of Levi to rise up in this hour and and guard the word of God and guard the truths of God and help us discern between profane and and and blessed we're going to sit here on the other side of the river in Exile we're not going to cross over into what God has called us to in this hour so I'm calling in the spirit a call is going out today that sons of Levi let's pray let's ask the Lord to raise up sons of Levi like never before who will grow so weary with Babylon I pray that the true sons of Levi will get so disgusted with the religious systems of this world that they can't tolerate those denominations uh boundaries any longer man's ideas man's Creeds dogmas so forth I pray that that the men of God the true sons of Levi will grow so disgusted with that stuff that they will have the courage to lead us across the river and back to the promised land but where are they in Ezra chapter 8 they don't even show up they've grown so accustomed to the life of the Babylonians uh which is a life of confusion God doesn't want his bride wandering around in confusion bumping into one another in the dark no sir a glorious light has shined on the word of God in this hour God has restored the truth of the word that was lost through the dark ages of History We Now understand justification by faith we Now understand sanctification by the washing of the water of the word We Now understand that the gifts of the Holy Spirit have been restored to the body and the precious gift of the Holy Ghost has been given back and restored to the church and all truth that was lost Through the Ages has been restored in a glorious message a revelation of Jesus Christ for us and so we have no excuse to stay over here in Babylon uh murmuring about how hard it is to live in Babylon but when the way is made for us to get out we'd rather stay in Babylon I hear the Cry of the spirit that we read about in The Book of Revelation that says come out of her and be separate sayth the Lord God is looking for a holy people and a separated people unto himself what a people that that live by the word a people that have discovered the likes and dislikes of the Living God a people that have found out what God is most concerned about what he loves and what he hates and they have uh agreed they have come into agreement with the with the plan of God we're being measured we're being measured by God's standard in this hour and the problem part of the problem is where are the Levites where are those men of Courage who will swim against the stream they used to say my granny used to talk about a jellyfish out in the ocean has no backbone he just goes wherever the wave tosses him but there's another fish in the in the American streams called the salmon and he's got a backbone all right she's got a backbone that mother will swim against the current for miles and miles and miles and miles to lay her eggs and when she lays them she dies she's wore herself out she doesn't have the strength to to continue to live but she is determined to swim against the current against the circumstances of life to get back to that place where the waters are calm where she can lay her eggs we need some salmon we need some Believers in this hour with a real backbone who'll take a stand for the word of God where are the Levites we need them and now don't you misunderstand me as to say that there are not any we have some men of God who are Towing the mark who are preaching the uncompromised gospel and we need to pray for them like never before that God will strengthen them and use them keep them healthy and strong that Satan will not be successful in breaking their bodies or silencing their voices but we also need to pray that God will raise up many more like them and that many of the sons of Levi those who are truly called to protect the holy things of God and to Value the holy things of God that they will wake up out of their Slumber out of their denominational stuper and be alerted to the sounding of the trumpet in this hour the trumpet is being set to our mouth the prophets are crying out it's time to come back to the word of God like never before enough of this compromise enough of this political correctness enough of this tolerance of sin God is looking for a people who are willing to pay the price the price is surrender the price is not something that you can't afford the price is simply to lay down your will and pick up the word of God and go forth in the power and strength of the holy spirit so there has to be a solution we're go we're getting ready to go back to Jerusalem and the Levites didn't show up those lazy boys where are they and so in verse 21 uh Ezra does something that helps solve the problem in verse 21 he said then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of a ah that we might afflict ourselves before our God to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance for I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and Horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake Him verse 23 for so we fast and and besought our God for this and he was intreated of us it was time to pray it was time to fast it was a time to be serious and solemn before the Lord if you could see with the eyes of the spirit the things that are swiftly approaching this world just look at what has happened and multiply that tens of even hundreds of times the the earthquakes the the uh political Uprising the slaughter of the innocent the the trouble of Civil War in Nations the threat of nuclear war uh all of the things that are uh falling on this Earth in a measure now will soon fall upon this planet without restraint and you're going to want to know that you're sheltered In The Arms Of God that you have found the Pavilion of the Lord safety and you're also going going to want to know that you're doing everything you can for the kingom look listen souls are dying and going to hell where are the Levites the church is backsliding and looking and acting more like the world every day where are the Levites it's time to fast and pray that God will raise them up in this hour there was a priesthood that was needed to handle and weigh out the silver and the gold if you look down to verse 25 uh as he began to to set some of these priest aside in verse 25 and he weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offerings of the House of our God which the king and his counselors and his Lords and all Israel their present had offered and he began to weigh it out and it was up to the priest to be able to weigh these things out and to handle in verse 28 and I said unto them ye Are Holy unto the Lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a free will offering unto the Lord God of your father fathers watch ye and keep them until you weigh them before the chief of the priest and the Levites and the chief of the fathers of Israel at Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the Lord verse 30 so the so took the priest and the Levites they showed up here they appear they showed up why do you think they showed up because the rest of the people were fasting and praying for the Lord's help so took the priest and the Levites the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God we couldn't take these gold valuable vessels and put them in untrustworthy hands it had to be Levites it had to be priests that were trained to Value what God values to protect what God has valued it had to be those men because when they measured it on this side of the river in Babylon the measurement had to be exact exactly the same when we got over to Jerusalem and if if if just if just Common Street people were carrying those vessels what is to say that one of them wouldn't have uh sold one along the way or thrown one aside because it was too heavy in his backpack but not the Levites they would have seen the value they would have known the importance of getting those sacred vessels of God back to Jerusalem oh help me pray for the Levites to show up in this hour uh so verse 29 says watch ye and keep them until so God is raising up that's what's going to happen when we cry out Levites are going to be raised up in this hour who will watch and keep guard and keep those holy things we need that anointing we we need to treasure the things that are sacred and holy to God the valuable truths that have been passed down to us we are so blessed in this hour We're blessed with technology to preserve the word of God to take the message of the prophets and preserve it and keep it and listen I want to tell you this any man who calls himself a prophet and his message doesn't line up with this word of God he is not a prophet he's a false prophet any Pastor who calls himself a true servant of the Lord and his message doesn't line up with with this book he's not a true Pastor he's a false Shepherd if we're going to be the mouthpiece of God in this hour everything we bring today has to line up it has to to fit in with God's measuring device this is God's yard stick that he's putting I almost picked my Bible up and put it over my head but I don't know how the camera angle would get that but we're under the word how about I just do it this way we're under the word the word is over us we're being measured by this word but we're also being strengthened and fed by this word sustained by the precious word of God the pure revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ I just say Lord feed us more Feed Us of your word and give us the grace to be able to discern it to understand it to move forward in it oh there's Dark Days Ahead well you smiling while you say it yes I'm smiling when I say it because there are also Glorious Days Ahead the Levites are coming forth the priest the zadok priesthood is rising up the sons of issachar are catching the timings and the seasons of the Lord we're going to see some amazing things in the earth you don't want to be out of the Ark of Safety let me pray for you now father I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak the truth and I thank you for Hungry hearts and fow ground that has received the seed of your word today I thank you that you're going to take these simple words and use them to bring people to their knees I thank

Lord I pray for healing for your body Deliverance for the sick and the oppressed I pray for the pastors for the churches for the leaders Lord I pray for all of those who name the name of the Lord and who are trying to do something for your kingdom challenge them with truth today if there is compromise among them or a spirit of lethargy or laziness upon them I pray you'll break it off in the mighty name of our Messiah Yeshua and that you will bring about a Revival that will stir the nations of the world Lord stir India Lord stir Europe Lord stir Asia Lord stir the Arab nations of this world stir
