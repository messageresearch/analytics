that your voice calms the troubled waters your voice comes Lord and calms those things inside of us that are that causes unrest Lord You Are The Prince of Peace and you have come that we could have

ones Lord I I remember Jerusalem today the nation of Israel God it seems that the war is intensifying but I pray over that Nation today asking God that you will be her protector as you have always been I ask you God that you will do great things that they don't even understand but Lord more than anything May their hearts be turned toward the god of Israel God we commit ourselves for the remainder of this service whatever you wish to do in the service God as our pastor would come to deliver the word may we have eyes to see and ears to hear and Lord may we consume the fire of God today

thankful that the Lord is on the Move I'm glad that I'm under his care that he is moving in my life and moving in your life and I know that the enemy is mad but I when when he gets mad it makes me know that there's belie there are believers that are rising up to face the challenge because of the Holy Ghost that dwells in us we see that we have been called for such a time as this we're grateful that he the Lord Jesus is working in US thankful for the Holy Ghost to guide us from day to day we want to receive the tithe in the offering today you can start getting that ready brother Kate if you'll get ready to sing for us please the Lord is good just want to report to you when I left the fellowship hall yesterday afternoon the air conditioner was running praise be to God the air conditioner man had many many struggles from the time he left us on Monday evening to the time he got back here yesterday but when he left here yesterday he was a happy man because it all went smoothly and and the unit was running when they left and when I left it was still above 80 de but it was just getting started so it it's going to take some time for it to get the temperature down but I'm thankful that it's there the Lord is providing for that might make mention to you that the Jerusalem rent is due in Jerusalem and uh it it is looking like that we are going to have to start paying the utilities again and the arnona is that right and so this is extra expense on the ministry we don't understand everything that the Lord is is calling us there uh for but we are just trying to obey him be mindful of what he has called us too the Lord is faithful he has looked after us now for 20 plus years concerning those apartments in Jerusalem and we want to be faithful to what he's called us to there's a lot going on in Israel right now but I'm glad that the god of Israel is watching over them and he's watching over me he knows us he knows what our needs are and he knows how to take care of us when the economy looks bad you we've got to understand that we are called to a higher economy the economy of God and if we'll do our part with keeping with his word I guarantee you he'll do his part to uh make sure that his word is taken care of in our lives he'll do his part you can be sure of that and so we bring our tithe and offering to him uh gladly we give to him brother Ellas would

Hallelujah you are [Music] oh yes Jesus yes Jesus yes Jesus thank you that you are Sav [Music] we worship Jesus to you be glory and honor and praise [Music] [Music] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus [Music] Jesus Hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I will lay Sinners upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise Behold a shaking and the bones came together and this is the word of the Lord to you at New Hope this morning hear him now hear the Lord so as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together here's the Lord bone somebody say bone to his bone his bone bone to his bone do you understand how important that is in that day and in this day that every bone find his bone you you you can't have a toe bone connected to an elbow right you you can't have a foot bone connected to a hip it's vitally important when God is rebuilding an army out of a valley of dry bones it's vitally important that every bone find his bone I am convinced this morning sitting here that God is calling you you to find your bone every gift has a compliment there is a complimentary gift for every gift that God places in your life the Bible said two are stronger than one and a three-fold chord is not easily broken for all my life God has dealt with me about a Synergy I I for years I didn't have a word I didn't have a word to explain it I just stumbled to explain it but now there there there came a word Synergy it's like Symphony it's the gathering together every bone look this way every bone finding his bone right you've got to be where God has planted you to be and you've got to be connected to who God has connected you to and you got to know who you've got to know who because when you when you come together how can two walk together except they be agreed and we know what happens when we join together Faith to Faith call of God to call of God sir and it matters it matters what you believe it matters where you worship it matters who you're in alignment with and I heard the spirit of the Lord saying this morning that I am releasing a sound to cause every bone to find his bone and I quickly looked at the scripture bone to find his bone Lord we want to know today where our bone is we want to know what you have connected us to and who you have connected us with we want to lay our life down beside others who have a likeminded faith we want to we want to surrender our gift a and walk with those who are who are gifted alike who are called Alik every Christian is not called to the same battle to the same work and Lord we want to know we can't go out to battle brother we can't go out to battle if we don't know who has our back we don't want to be in the Foxhole we don't want to be in the trenches with somebody who's trying to sell us out we want to be in the battle with somebody who's got our common interest our common vision is laid upon him the same way it was laid upon us and and this the only way we can it's the only way we can walk together yes if you don't you'll have one pulling one way one Ox going that way and another Ox going that way Lord bind us together today in the name of Jesus Christ all over this house and throughout the stream Lord let that anointing come that will help us some of you some of you real soft some of you are going to discover that you're already walking with your bone but you haven't acknowledged it you haven't really recognized that God has placed you where he has placed you in a friendship in a relationship in a church body I'm not just talking about the church body I believe that's the army that God's raising up but I'm talking about even in relationship boyfriend to girlfriend I tell you bone better find his bone you better find who you belong to because if you don't they'll take you out of the purposes of God for your life and nobody will pay the price but you that's right see everybody doesn't get their somebody everybody doesn't get the one that God called them to have do you understand that that's true because some people won't find their bone they're looking for something else they're not looking for a a a person who their gifting and their calling will compliment I don't know how to say it better join together both shoulders to the plow in marriage in friendship in in family relations most importantly in a church body I want you to know if one can put a th000 to flight two can put 10,000 to flight that that's God's mathematics seems to me like 1,000 and 1,000 would be 2,000 but God said when you're working with the one I've called you to be with when you're covenanted with the right person with the right thing then 1 + one doesn't make two on it makes 10 10,000 that's God's economics how many of you are glad you've discovered his economics I want you to sincerely pray right now Lord help me discover help me discover my bone help me find who you have called me where you have called me to walk I'll just say who your pastor is matters it matters yes L May God help you to know who your pastor is that's may God help you to know where you're to be and what you are to be used for God said I'm going to take some followers and make them leaders I'm going to take chameleons who have just tried to blend in to their environment and I'm going to make them somebody I'm going to make them something that is not dependent on their environment but I'm going to let them be I'm going to loose them and let them be what I have created them to be what I have called them to be and they're not going to have to try to change their colors when they're with a different group of people they're going to be have they're going to have Liberty and freedom to be who they are Lord right now we ask you to settle this thing in our heart settle this thing in our heart because when we know who our bone is and and what our Valley is where our place is spiritually we don't ever have to compete with one another we don't ever have to be jealous over one another we don't ever have to resent one another for how each other is being used in the body because we understand that in a body there are many members yes and they're not all of the same they're not all the same bone that's right some bones have a better reputation than others they just seem more important but the reality is every bone in the body is vitally important for the full function of that body amen and you've got to have it you've got to have it do you understand how it throws everything out of balance if the toes are removed did you know people have to learn to walk yes without doing this if they lose toes they don't look like much I think they're kind of ugly but we need them they keep us in the right balance may God help us May if you discover that you're a toe don't resent it say Lord thank you that somebody can be placed in the body to help bring the balance you hear him you hear him that's where we are in this hour I just felt released I felt such a a surge of the spirit of God we're singing about the greatness of our God and all of a sudden I could see Ezekiel calling on the Wind of the spirit to come and breathe because once the bone Finds Its bone sinu can [Music] come organs can come and then guess what happens there's got to be skin to cover it all up and to protect the body from from infection we're blessed I want you to give the Lord a great praise right now let's Praise Him hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah let's sing let's sing just a little bit more that let's sing just a little more of that before we get ready for the word hallelujah God then who could ever stop us and if our God is with us then what can stand against and if our God is for us then who can stand against and if our God is for tell me working stand [Music] again working stand against stand against this body this Army of he is our God and our God is our God is stronger our God is so much higher than any other and our God is healer he's awesome in power our god oh one more time oh and our God is greater we our God is stronger my God is so much higher than any any other father and our God is healer awesome he's a subit power our god oh Our [Music] God bless the Lord give him one more hand clap of [Applause] Praise aren't we blessed I mean aren't we blessed aren't you blessed to have these musicians laboring in the vineyard of the Lord under such great anointing and impact would you give them a thank you thank you sir thank you [Music] [Applause] ma'am I want to let you all go so that you can just as quickly as you can join us here in the sanctuary because I believe one more time uh that I have a word from the Lord for this body and I want you to all to hear it and to participate as much as you possibly can I know you're standing but I want to just mention a few things uh while they have a moment they need a moment some are going to maybe eat a couple bites of breakfast because they didn't have any and uh they're going to drink a little water and go to the bathroom and there's only one bathroom back there and then they're going to join us yesterday was Sister Ronda Shaw's birthday happy birthday sister Rhonda I had it all wrote down Tuesday night had it all wrote down Tuesday night

I thought oh my goodness he has been busy in these short years on the earth he's not nearly as old as some of us uh Friday would have been my dear dear friend and uh really rock steady um Confidant and and so much more brother Benny West would have turned 88 on Friday uh there are no birthdays in heaven I know some of you all just enjoy wishing your loved one a happy birthday In Heaven There Are No birthdays there birthdays Mark time and there is no time there they wouldn't have a clue what day it is have you ever thought that they wouldn't have a clue what day it is it's just one day it's that day that's the day it is one Eternal day never ends some of you seem dis disappointed you you ought to be rejoicing he he doesn't even know he won't know that it was his birthday he's already entered into the great eternity of God and then this coming weekend August 3rd and 4th Saturday night and Sunday are our fellowship meetings we're looking forward to whatever the Lord has the Lord will be with us he's with us today and then camp meeting this year again October 15th uh through the 20th and our next fellowship meeting will be December 6th and 7th so the camp meeting although it's not the first weekend of October will serve as our fellowship meeting for October but we'll get back to the first weekend in December if some of you discovered that you were uh signed out of the app and had to resign in that's my fault I did it I apologize to you you um I didn't realize when I merged some of your many accounts I discovered that some people change email addresses more often than others change socks and some of you had so many different accounts and so many different emails in the system that you're you were clogging up the system so we merged just it it just had to make sure was you and go through a few thing we merged and that might have kicked some of you out of the app let me encourage you to get back in log back in because it's not just prayer requests sometimes it's inspiration that drops on anybody in the body and they share it and it keeps us going and sometimes it becomes an SOS so all of you who think you're too busy to have the app I don't know what you're so busy with that you wouldn't want to pray for one another and that you wouldn't want to take the spiritual temperature of the bone that you're connected to in this hour so if you accidentally turned off the notifications it's so easy to accidentally do I encourage you to go back and turn them on you just go up to the little bell at the top and press it again and you'll get your notifications back uh because for now we're putting it in both places the Facebook group we do that because only the local group is is connected to the messenging uh uh system in the app but we sometimes we want you to know while I was in Salt Lake City there were a couple of SOS that were urgent and we wanted to make the people aware that there is a raging battle going on in that other realm and when there is it means Victory is is on the Horizon and and so you don't want to be unaware of what's going on and you don't want to be slacked in a time that you're supposed to be pushing you want to be pushing and if God should ever allow us a time to Coast I think coasting days are over but if he should give us a reprieve and let us Coast well you want to know you can Coast a little bit and so stay connected to the ministry if you possibly can because one day I notice I know notic that some people who never say I'm praying never put praying hands NE so easy to put praying hands it's harder to actually pray than it is to say I'm praying amen but I notice that people who never encourage anyone else who never say I'm praying for you if you get in a bind I've seen some of you come out of the woodwork come where I don't know where you've been hiding in the woods somewhere I see you show up all of a sudden to tell us that you've got a prayer request that you'd like for us to pray about let may I just ask you without making you feel too bad how fair is that we all need to know hey that somebody's fighting with us oh is it going to be that kind of a Sunday it's just a truth it's just a truth amen would you turn with me today to Matthew that is the first of the four gospels I'd like to read in Matthew chap 24: 10- 12 while you're turning there I'd like to give thanks again publicly for the Lord returning our bag to us it wasn't a large bag it was only almost what you would call a carry-on siiz bag but but the value of the things that were in that bag would have been $4,000 or more so we certainly wanted to get it back um I I don't want to my wife but she uses a CPAP machine not because she's overweight some people think that's the only cause of sleep apnea but uh hers has to do with a broken nose from a long time ago she wakes up with a headache if she doesn't use it she's been using it for years it's not something we've ever felt like we had to announce um because it's so often associated with snoring that would you don't want to talk about things like that but she needed it because she was waking up with headaches in fact one morning her vision was leaving uh because of something like a migraine coming on so we're so thankful that God you prayed and prayed and prayed you were probably tired of praying about it but thank you for pressing through and there are people who will never see their bags with what's going on right now people are overseas and their bags are somewhere else this is a big big mess the more dependent we become on on servers and Tech technology the more crippled we are when something goes wrong and it will it certainly will so thank you for praying uh I'm going to ask again that you give me the best of your attention this morning and I'll try to obey the Lord Matthew 24:10 and then shall many be offended oh dear what day is that it's got to be now too doesn't it it may have applied to other ages but there's never been an age like the woke age where everybody is offended about something many shall be offended and shall betray one another this is Jesus talking red letter and shall hate one another this is an age of rage and hate right I'm mindful sometime in public boy when I was flying home with my wife on Monday I knew people's nerves were pressed you could feel it in the air and I wanted to tiptoe I didn't want to stir anybody up because people had had their limit and when you're that way it's a it's just an opportunity presents itself to just rage and I knew that some I said honey look around these people's fuses are shorter than they have ever been before we we've got to pray that we get home safe L without watching someone drug off an airplane I mean you could feel it in the atmosphere so much rage so much hate and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall what wax wax cold so it's absolutely the truth there will be the false the false will always rise many will be deceived the Bible tells us it will be so serious that even the elect would be deceived if if it were possible we're not adding to the scripture are we we're getting it all in if it were possible so when someone decides that they have been deceived in the truth then you must understand the position that they're in they are taking themselves out of the numbered elect because the elect may get off they may slide they may slip brother brandom said they may look backslid but they will never that elect number never somebody say never be deceived it's not even possible for them to be deceived that ought not to make you strut that ought to make you want to keep crawling back to God if you believe that say Amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated thank you for remembering if all possible to give me the attention that you can because in a few moments I'm going to take a I'm I'm going to turn Corners here and I'm going to go off in a different direction and you're going to think where where is he going why is he bringing that in have you ever heard somebody bring something in and you wondered what in the world did that have to do with anything else that was said sometimes it's just doing our best to follow the mind of the Spirit uh we were taught that if you have a question you can sit there in the seat and pull on the gift and uh if that man has a a genuine gift to minister the word that you can pull toward you with your with your faith Hall your faith pool and and he might just go way off over there somewhere and start talking about something that that you you knew it had to be for you and you took it and you claimed it for yourself I want you to understand this message it'll end up being a few Services of a series and I want to call it this morning returning to your first love it's vitally important that that we beat our way back to our first love and if he's never been I'm convinced I hope this doesn't sound so very judgmental but I'm convinced that some people have followed along as a part of the church at large but have never fallen in love with Jesus in order just to fall in love with him you have to see your depravity you have to see how low you were and because we certainly don't like to look to where we were we like to keep our hearts and Minds planted on what is to come uh but we have to sometime look back and remember how low we were when he found us and when you remember what gutter you were laying in when Jesus passed by your way it'll cause you to love him and and then there are those who love him because they feel like he gave them a a a get out of hell a pass uh like playing Monopoly you know uh you know uh go to jail do not pass gold do not collect and and that's what they're looking for a a card that Springs you out of jail and so they say well I love the Lord because he saved me from hell that's not enough uh for the for the elect of God hell was never yours it was never created for you you weren't weren't ever really going there you're just walking down the wrong road but but your home was never built for you in hell you you even the psalmist said though I make my bed in hell though I choose to hide in hell it never was my my place of dwelling God has a home for you that is of Eternity and uh that's where you are always going to be eventually but you had to recognize your sinful nature your Fallen condition and you had to come to the Lord but many people follow Christianity attend church Faithfully pay their tithe and have never fallen in love with Jesus they've never spend enough time with him because you've got to subtract the time you spend in church you've got to subtract that that's not what it really means to spend time with him if you're spending time with him it's not a hundred other people and you and him if you're really fellowshipping with him it generally is you and him and to those Christians who have never taken the time for it to be you and him him and you however you want to say it you've missed out on what A Love Affair this serving God really is we don't just love him because he first loved us does we don't just love him because he saved us from hell we don't love him because of what his hand does on our behalf we've got to learn to love him for who he is for his very nature for his very character for his very attributes and if you don't see God as Sovereign you'll never fall in love with him because you'll always blame him for bad things that happen in your life but once you get revelation of his sovereignty you can really fall in love with him because you discover that even if you get on a boat going in the wrong direction that God knows how to meet you on the other end he knows how can you tell I've been studying Jonah all week long he I have but I'm not going to preach on Jonah today but I've been studying him all week long because I'm trying to answer answer the age-old question was Jonah backslid or not it's a big big question and I'm going to preach that for you sometime in the near future backslid or not backslid because for many many years brother brandham preached emphatically that Jonah was backslid and then all of a sudden around 58 or 59 I think it was he read somewhere where he might not actually have been backslid and from then on he said I read this and he said I like the way it sounded and from then on he began to preach it just a little bit different he got off he got out of God's plan he got out of God's will but he didn't have to start the journey all over the fish did part of the work when he got spit out he was better prepared and in a better location to get to where he had to go woo that's a godall man that's a god- calleded woman make a bad choice and God use the bad choice get in God's permissive will and God use permissive will to get you closer to perfect will that's the sovereignty of God that's why I love him that's why I love him so much he's just everything he he he never ever makes a mistake so I'll preach on that but but not this morning but the reality is that uh Jonah he he he did he started out to he wanted to obey God he was a true prophet of God he loved God he he was a head and shoulders Above the Rest but he just simply didn't want to go to Nineveh and there may be multiple reasons I'm again I'm not going to but I'm trying to anyway aren't I there may be multiple reasons why I didn't want to go but that don't make it right I don't always get to go where I want to go and I don't you know what I mean and sometimes we're put where we would rather not be I remember brother skipworth who worked so hard for so many years on this Campground fing in every mud hole back breaking work no heavy equipment a shovel dirt a five gallon bucket of gravel and when the early days were and we were ter trying to clean up this land so that we could even do anything with it he had hats he was a cap guy and his prized hat his favorite hat fell off of his head and into one of them mud puddles and it turned it red and a man who rarely ever talked above a whisper he got right aggravated and he said I hate this red mud you see they didn't have it where he was from in in uh over that way in Elmore County just over here in Lee County well I don't like it either there's a lot of things things I don't like about where God put me but I understand that I don't always get the choice I've got to be at the right place at the right time come on because I'm not born here to do my will I'm here to do his will you need to understand that folks it's not just preachers that are born for a purpose there's amen that are born for a purpose musicians are born singers and all of those who who serve the way this body serves you you are you are positioned for a purpose for a reason we are in that very easily offendable age many be offended Matthew 2410 and shall betray one another because of their offense they shall sell one another out you can say it that way you know uh it's a truth we saw it in covid and we'll see it even in Greater ways as we go along uh uh some neighbors see too many cars at your house and call you in and Report you somebody find out we were having Church during the Mandate and and call in and report US these kinds of things will happen and we won't just be betrayed by our neighbor or by a stranger but but we can get under a spirit of offense and we can begin to to be offended with one another to such an extent that we begin to betray each other it's part of the spirit of the age that we're living in and when offense is not dealt with it it graduates to betrayal and when betrayal is not dealt with it gravitates toward hatred come on now and that's where we're living right now there is such a rage uh in in the in the world we saw the the great protests that were taking place this week simply because prime minister Netanyahu is here speaking up he brought with him uh families of of those who have hostages he brought a former hostage with him to stand with him as he addressed Congress several soldiers who uh even had missing body parts because of this war that goes on in Gaza all the while there were many uh defacing the the the city of Washington down at the at the at the rail station I've been there I ate lunch there with my wife when we were in Washington lobbying for Israel we ate lunch there and they they climb up the monument and they paint these uh triangles of red and they say uh Hamas is coming for you they're not kidding they're not kidding there there are many of them who have no clue what they're doing you just pull one aside and interview them and listen at the dumb answers they give you'll know they don't even know why they hate but among them this is where we have to pray among them there are those who very much desire very much desire to destroy not only the Jewish state but they desire to bring down the greatest nation on the face of the Earth the one you and I are blessed to live in so it's an hour to stay on our prayer bones and it's an hour to make sure that we are not so easily offended the Bible tells us great peace have they which love the laws of God and nothing nothing shall by any means offend them I want to become unoffendable hello I'd like that and and because iniquity iniquity a little different than just sin unbelief iniquity is a little different iniquity represents something that has not been dealt with generationally do you understand what I mean by that that that that tendency that predisposition that falls on another generation and if if they don't deal with that stronghold of iniquity it it waves over it rolls over and Cascades down on the Next Generation and the Next Generation uh personally in my family line you know it was a spirit of lust and unfaithfulness and it had to be broken or it would have ruined my life my children's life my grandchildren's life it ruined my father's life it ruined my grandfather's life it ruined my great-grandfather's wife and by how many wives my great great grandfather had I think something was a m with him as well that is Iniquity it is a spirit of unbelief that rolls down from generation to generation uh we find it uh outlined for us in the Old Testament and and you know the the analogy of the grapes and setting the teeth on edge and we understand some of these things that come and America has its own share of iniquity that rolls down from generation to generation a wild spirit that gets on people because iniquity shall abound generational sin that just keeps ruling the generations how many of you would like to think that you have power by the blood of Jesus to cut it off so that whatever you've had to fight whatever you've had to deal with how many of you love your children enough you'd like to think they would never have to deal with that kind of a predisposition toward any form of addiction or even something as simple is jealousy it can run through generations and it will continue to do that until somebody's willing to stand up and say I'm guilty I'm guilty I'm wrong and I did it I'm not blaming it on my dad I'm not blaming it on my granddad I agreed with it I'm the one responsible now blood of Jesus grace of God come and set me right break every Fetter and every yoke I tell you if you don't get filled up when the unclean Spirit goes out he'll find some more he'll come in and the state of that man will be worse in the end than it was in the beginning isn't that what the Bible said and because iniquity shall abound would you read the last phrase for me love of the love of many shall wax cold now you remember brother brandham uh differentiating between the loves in the Greek New Testament he was not a scholar he was not not really he barely knew how to study the the Greek but he had people in his life that he could talk to about and would help and and uh underline different things in books and let him read and I appreciate his desire to to understand there were things he didn't grasp but I'm so thankful for the things that he did grasp and he talked to us about the different kinds of love agapo agapo love which is a noun agape love uh which is the verb form and you'll hear them both used in interchangeably in the message and and among the people even and fileo love which is a a human kind of love uh what kind of love do you think is mentioned here is it a human love a fileo love a relational love or would you think that it would be an agape love a Divine love and it says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold would you think that would be a relational love a fileo Love or would you think that is going to be an Agape or agapo love let me hear you guess just guess well you're absolutely right uh I wouldn't have guessed just standing back and looking at it I would have thought that in context the scripture would be talking about uh people losing their love for one another and that would be on on the level of a fileo love but what we forget about Agape or agapo love is that it is not only the love that God has loved us with Divine agape love or agapo love but it's also the love wherewith we as Believers love one another do you understand it both comes down to us from above and it goes out from us to others so this is definitely agape love and it says because iniquity is abounding the love the Agape of many shall shall do what shall wax cold did I give you that word it it's suko in the Greek suko and it means to breathe it's the Greek form of breathing to breathe to cool to be cooled to become cold and or dry the the Jesus is saying and those who Translate his words to us are saying something because iniquity is abounding around us because generational sins are taking over the age that we live in it's like something has breathed cool air frigid air on our love and we are no longer capable of loving one another the way we should the way that we have been loved because the spiritual temperature has been so affected in the atmosphere of This World by iniquity iniquity has taken such a stronghold in our land that it's like the enemy himself has breathed cool air and it has dried out our love it has chilled or made our love be almost Frozen and when love is frozen it can't be given it can't be shared it becomes solid it becomes dry it's no longer exchangeable how many of you know we don't only want to receive his agape love but we want to exchange it we want to share it we want it to flow through us to the brothers first to the household of faith first but also to a world that's dying and going to a Devil's hell we shouldn't be surprised when Sinners sin we shouldn't be surprised when the world celebrates iniquity we shouldn't be surprised when the world mocks Christianity mocks the Lord's Supper puts this Pagan goddess uh of of of sexuality uh and display blazs it in the opening ceremonies of the Olympics this uh overweight homosexual man nearly naked painted blue with a Vine wrapped around his you know whats and uh that is the celebration and when they ask the the sad little Frenchman why he came up with something so stupid his answer was my message is inclusion there's nothing in inclusive about that I don't want to be included in that I don't want to be a part of that that is the spirit of the age but I'm not I'm not particularly offended by it either because I expect it don't be shocked by it it's there as a shock factor it's there to shock you it didn't shock me I'm not surprised when Sinners sin and I'm not surprised when the world World celebrates iniquity and it's going to be worse and worse what's more concerning to me is when the church allows society and iniquity that's abounding to breathe cool air on our love when we dry up and when we freeze and we no longer show one another that Godly love that unconditional always forgiving love that's what I'm concerned ConEd about I'm not concerned about pagans being Pagan you understand the origins of the Olympic is Pagan it started in Pagan and it'll end in Pagan and so I'm not surprised I'm not even deeply concerned because the Bible tells us if you're a Bible student you know it's going to wax worse and worse I need some help it's going to get darker and darker and darker in there out there and the only answer is for it to get brighter and brighter and brighter in here and in order for that to happen we're going to have to Tha out our cold love we we we get too quick in throwing one another under the bus if if you dropped the ball you dropped the ball Fred you did no need to throw somebody else you did and there's nothing wrong there's no shame in saying I was wrong in the church age book we have that quote where it is said this is what we're missing in this hour the solution I'm paraphrasing my well it's a paraphrase book might as well paraphrase it the whole thing is this this we we we need to just cry out I've been wrong but we're protecting our pride and we're protecting our reputation and so we it's easier for us to throw a brother under the bus or a sister under the bus or shove the blame if we stumble in on Noah and he's laying drunk and his his nakedness is is exposed his sons loved him so much that they covered him up and they turned around and backed out of the room yes they weren't excusing his overindulgence they weren't excusing his carelessness to Lounge absolutely 100% naked they were showing him honor they weren't condoning his sin they underst what families do I'm not going to get a lot of help that's what families do they they fight in the backyard yours don't maybe not fisted but group text somebody's preaching today they fight in the group text or some fight on Facebook come on some have these strange post and somebody will say to me sometime brother Shelly or Pastor or what do do you know what they meant by that I said it's not meant for us to know it wasn't directed to us if you don't know what it meant it wasn't directed to you it was a personal dirty underwear thing that should have been washed and out on the backline but instead it got slung and drugged through public social media that's the hour we're living in now we should fight it out if we need to as families in the backyard but when we come around to the front yard we are a united front we are the body of Christ we are Bible Believers some of us are neopians cuz we found our bone hello I'm not ashamed to say that I found my bones I found my tribe praise God and I'm happy never regretted it I'm happy it's not always easy but I'm happy because I don't want to I don't want to live where he doesn't want me and I don't want to die certainly don't want to die out of my place amen I would have liked to have gone and helped out the Saints in Tucson it was on my heart it's something I would have loved to have done there were many there who would have not received me but there were many who would have there were many who prayed all kinds of prayers some so desperate that they even told us at breakfast uh we're praying that God sends an angel into brother Shell's bedroom at night and calls him to Tucson I it's nice to be loved it's nice to be wanted but as I told them that day three weeks of my preaching three weeks of my long sermons and you'd send me right back to Alabama where I came from because coming to a special meeting and getting it once every few months is not the same as having to face it service after service after service that's why we need a revelation of who our pastor is and we stay with him because he has some kind of a calling to help us get over we're not drifting from church to church and Faith come on now the enemy the spirit of the age has breathed on the love of the church this is husband wife love this is God's love to us our love to one another therefore all men shall know that they are my disciples because they make all the right quotations no because they have love one for another and love would rather take the blame than to excuse themselves and push the blame on someone else if we're in that kind of a family and we are if we're in that kind of family there's only one solution for us and that is to pray like wild men pray like wild women that the fire of the Holy Ghost will burn so hot so bright so hot so powerful that it thaws out our Frozen love come on greater love hath no man than this that a man would lay down his life for his friends Jesus did that on our behalf but sometimes we have to do that for one another because not to do it would be to expose someone in a way they don't particularly need to be exposed in such an hour as this are you following what I'm saying so when you're not taking any portion of the responsibility for something that you certainly had some responsibility in and you're shoveling it on someone else you are demonstrating the words of Jesus in our day unfortunately it's not the positive ones it's the ones that say when iniquity prevails the love of many shall freeze cold love I'm not going to preach on this you can go back and find the sermon I preached many years ago on the on the stronghold of cold love cold love is a demonic stronghold against the church we may enjoy temporary blessings and seasonal breakthroughs but we cannot experience true lasting Revival as long as Frozen love prevails Among Us amen cold love shuts down the power of prayer Cold Love Takes worship into will worship which is not enough we worship out of a love affair we're not using it as an act of our own will we're not doing it to exalt ourselves we're doing it to exalt the king cold love will shut down prayer it shifts Godly worship to will worship and it will disable the flow of the healing virtue in a church sickness will prevail in a house where Frozen Love is the stronghold sickness prevails confusion prevails chaos prevails there are some people who think that you can entertain a demon and you can bring somebody out of their bondage by giving them more Fellowship but I want you to know you can't Fellowship the devil out of anybody you can't Fellowship Rebellion out of somebody's heart you can't Fellowship cold love out of somebody's heart that's why churches will work so hard to to uh build and and promote a a youth uh uh uh Ministry and I believe in that with all my heart I think that we should spend more of our attention on young people than we do so don't misunderstand me but some people think that giving them something to do every night of the week is what's going to cause them to come into alignment with the promises of God for their life not until every night is a prayer meeting if every night is movie night if every night is bingo night you kids don't play Bingo do you Uno Uno Dutch blits whatever else we like to BL if every night is game night that's not going to bring Deliverance either it's not going to throw out our love if we think that entertaining is the key it's not we need it we need Recreation we need togetherness we need to create an environment of safety not only for young people but for all of us amen we need that but we need not think that that is the key it doesn't cause the lesbian not to desire to be a lesbian or the alcoholic not to be an alcoholic there's only one thing that'll do that and that's the fire of the Holy Ghost and we need him we need him we need him we need him we need him we need him are you with me we don't want the flow of healing to be so uh charity I'm on uh half a page we're not doing too good if we're going to get to 11 got to hurry Revelation chapter 2 verse 1-6 unto the angel of the church of Leo deia right is that what he said are you sure this is Ephesus let's read these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks anybody with me yes sir I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name sake has labored and H has not fainted this is beautiful words here nevertheless are you sure that didn't say Le oysa are you sure this is Ephesus am I mistaken when I tell you that Ephesus is not the last Church age but indeed it was the first church age do you remember that Ephesus was the church age that was closer to the time of the ministry of [Music] Jesus there were those alive who knew the ministry of Jesus who saw the ministry of Jesus who partook of the minister are you here of Jesus and they were in Ephesus First Church age and the message to Ephesus Church later to its age was nevertheless you got a lot of things right nevertheless I have somewhat against thee you read it I'm getting already a little tired here first love because thou Hast left thy first love the real ru loot of Frozen love the real cause of waxing cold in your love is because you leave your first love if you emphatically hold on to Jesus as the number one love of your life you will so value his love for you that you long to be a pipeline you long to be a conduit for that love to flow through you that kind of love doesn't keep a record of wrongs that kind of love doesn't behave itself unseemingly that kind of love doesn't get puffed up I want to tell you something folks years years of service for the Lord it doesn't give us a free pass it doesn't mean that we don't have to keep fighting but I can tell you something and if it sounds boastful I apologize for the way I've made it sound it's not my intention but I've been around I've been around a time or two uh I didn't choose this it chose me it did I I'm not I'm not here doing this thing because this is what I wanted to do or what I would like to do I've been arrested I've been apprehended I've been forced into doing something that I was never comfortable doing but I didn't really have a choice what of our ministry brethren in the Philippines who has labored so hard he has worked so hard to spread the word he is a a leader in the Philippines of doing what they call mystery Expos where they will go into a community and they will have seminars with the denominational pastors and they will share share with them some of the mighty things that God has done and is doing and have baptized many Pastors in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they have shepherded many churches coming out of error into truth he posted something a few days ago about pastors I'm sure you've read it similar to something that Hawk posted not too long ago mentioning some of the Perils of being a pastor It Looks So Glamorous you know we even get our own parking spot So Glamorous the money just rolls in for pastors we're the only ones in the whole wide world that only work of three or four hours a week and make as much money as we do and and everybody shouts amen you know it sounds a whole lot more glamorous than it is look how quiet people get when does anybody take up for pastors when do you take up for pastors I I rarely do it because it doesn't look good for the pastor to have to be the one to do it does it it doesn't look good it looks self-serving but every now and again you just get a bit overwhelmed and you just want to speak up not only for yourselves but for other pastors he posted that and I I commented right away happened to see it right away and I commented right away and I said my I'm praying for men like you who didn't choose to be a pastor but the office of Pastor chose you you know there may be tens of thousands looking for a meal ticket but let us not forget that there's got to be a few that are in it to win it that are in it for the right reason that are in it to see a body of Believers make the Rapture got to believe God I've got to believe I couldn't go on on if I couldn't believe the thing that stirred me up the most was not the fact that he posted that I've actually read that before but it was the fact that another brother that I know of in the message was the first one of the very first few people maybe even ahead of me I he had to be because I read his comment uh a and his his comment was something like this God forgive me if I don't say it just right I don't remember exactly how it was was worded but it said something like this you know basically most pastors are doing exactly what they want to do you know they just really enjoy the position of being a pastor in other words indicating that that that many just got up and went and I agree many did but our brother wasn't trying in that one moment to emphasize those who were mama called or Daddy called he was trying to bring a little honor and prayer covering for those who Mama didn't call and daddy didn't call but God called and what's the first comment that someone makes a resentful comment to show you how people really feel he was being reflective of his own heart and the Heart of so many just like him he sees it as an opportunity to to lay down in a bed of ease I commented to brother Malo and I said no man in his right mind would choose to be a pastor especially not in this age so I'm praying for those who didn't choose the office but the office chose them I want you to understand that we're living in such an hour that that we better know that we know that we know that we're in alignment and that we're in Covenant with somebody who wasn't mama called who wasn't Daddy called who wasn't big mama called but who was God called because the reality is some are called and some are sent and some just got up and went that's right and we don't need any of that in this hour that will never get the bride where the bride needs to be this early church age the very first one Jesus had barely ascended and left the scene and they had already left their how is it possible that hardly a generation has passed and they had already left their first love some people love church some people love the pastor and some people love Jesus the ones who love Jesus are are the ones who don't just show up on Sunday morning they fight their way through that's what brother green used to say some love church come on Sunday morning some love their pastor come on Sunday night and some love Jesus they come during the week well you got to admit it's harder you've worked all day you're wore out 99 degrees and and and and like yesterday morning or didn't know this morning I woke up the temperature was 72 doesn't that sound amazing at 10 minutes till 7 this morning 6:50 the the the temperature was 72 that just makes you just want to go right out in your pajamas and L down in the front yard cool until you keep reading 72° 97% humidity in that weather you don't even have to get a shower just go out inside you'll shower right off that's terrible humidity and people work in that outside you Brethren were they were telling me we're working up high in the fellowship hall doing different thing hot hot hot hot you wore out your electrolytes are gone you're weary I understand the the need to relax but those who really remember their first love will go above and beyond what the physical body demands I'm not trying to hurt nobody's feelings I remember what it was like the first years of our marriage we had one vehicle we could hardly afford that we had one and that means we either had to go together or only one of us went wherever it was that we were going we didn't have a big spread out house I'm living in the house right now I was living in in 1990 and you can get in one end of the house and talk you don't have to scream and be heard in the other end of the house it's just not that big of a house no downstairs no no Wing away from the rest of the house I can even stand in the garage that was closed in to be a den and talk and be heard all the way down the hall and so uh I know what it was like to have sleep Disturbed I know what it was like to have a baby that would get out of whack and days and nights mixed up and and all those things I remember it well I was not like some around here who I won't call their name that I used to ask how was the night they just had baby how was the night wonderful I won't call the name redheaded born on an island Wonder ful oh I slept so good oh I said you mean the baby slept all night yeah oh wonderful night great night if you know Hawk you may not know him that way but he really likes I mean he can really he can brag he can talk he's a foodie and he can make food W you make you want to eat something you don't even like if you listen to him oh I'd see meth a little later in the day and I'd say wonderful news so glad the baby slept she said what I didn't call his name what who told you that up all night long I remember that I remember that but I I didn't have the pleasure of calling in sick I was younger then about the age of some of you now that's got little ones I didn't get to call in sick my wife didn't get to call in sick we just had to do what we were born to do we just pressed in oh it's quiet because we weren't in love with the church we weren't in love with the preacher we were in love with Jesus and when you get really in love with him you start looking for an excuse to be in his presence presence instead of looking for an excuse not to I understand when people are made to work but I don't understand people volunteering to work and missing a service that I don't understand it goes against what I read in the Bible it goes against what I read in the message of the hour and I I don't think that I'm dumb when I when I observe they're running from something if we're ever it's quiet if we're ever going to get back to a RedHot love for one another first we're going to have to get back to when he was our first love what does it mean to be first love it means to love him above and beyond sir my number one affection my number one love my number one priority is Jesus Christ and his business his Kingdom Business nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love and here was the solution to the Ephesian Church age and I'm wondering if it worked in Ephesus why wouldn't it work for us in the closing hours of leod DEA remember therefore from whence this isn't leod deia this is Ephesus First Church yes are you going to go to sleep on me now first church repent from where thou Hast Fallen remember excuse me remember where you have fallen from and repent and do the if you're going to make him your first love again it stands the reason that you might have to repeat your first works again remember when you were excited remember when truth excited you remember when you didn't want to miss a service because you were afraid that something would happen and you'd miss it and you'd have to listen to Sister Joyce or sister Alfreda on tell about it cuz you knew they were going to be there anybody I remember a day like that yes sir you remember a day like that that Services would end and close and nobody wanted to move nobody rushed to Fellowship everybody just wanted to linger in the presence of the Lord and then they w't then we all went out to eat we couldn't get enough of one another's company because Jesus was our first love and it C caused our love for one another to burn to thrive many was the Sunday afternoon that without announcing a meal a meal would just happen one little family would bring theirs and another little family would bring theirs and another little family would bring theirs and they were just going to share it with their family the next thing you know there'd be a fellowship hall full of people eating on the on the on the lunch of just a few because we wanted to to be together and we want not to play volleyball that wasn't our driving force God ministered in those times I remember a young man that was about to make a terrible mistake in his life he was about to marry someone who really didn't believe in any way like he believed and we're sitting there after the meal and a vision drops I saw God delivering that young man out of the mouth of a dragon I begin to speak those words to his parents and God was faithful to do exactly what he said he was going to do and that didn't take place in the pull pit it didn't even take place in the sanctuary what are they building a fellowship hall for Fellowship food yeah yeah that's a part of Fellowship we have to eat because we understand that there are times and and let me tell you something when we Fellowship together in a hall together there's less of an atmosphere that gives us the tendency to talk it's hard to talk about somebody when they're sitting at your table sir it's easy to talk about somebody when you're over at somebody's house and nobody knows you're there because you're so secretive about it even to the point of lying about where you are when you build a an atmosphere like that I can only expect that anything will happen and anything will be said and unknown damage can be done but when we get together on brother we're creating a different atmosphere that's right somebody called me some time ago and said if we can get if we can get the right uh uh environment I'd like to put a piano I'd like to donate a piano and put a piano in there as long as we know that it would be protected great idea because God can move when the pie is eaten and the bones are discarded and somebody with a gift walks over to the piano and starts to play haven't we seen what God can do yes sir oh I don't know what you came to hear today but this is what the Lord said so I hope you can receive we need that we need that we don't need everybody pulling in their own Direction on now used to grieve my heart through the years I always wanted this to be a place I know God wanted it to be it was a refuge and it used to grieve my heart when everybody was trying to pull everybody to their house when there was a great opportunity to be gathered together here because I knew that inevitably if it was there somebody would be or feel left out but if we were all here here we can be here it's ours it belongs to us if we want to walk we don't have to ask anybody can I walk if we want to ride a bike we don't have to ask anybody can I ride a bike it's ours we only ask a few things our children are feel safe here we want it to always be that way I wanted to gather people here because that was the vision of this house and it's been difficult to do that through the years without a place to to eat thank you sir thank you brother gy thank you all of you Brothers every one of you who've worked and made a sacrifice they told me brother gy told me that the young man who owns the business has already acquired the second unit because it's going to take two units we didn't have the money to pay to have the second one put in or to purchase the unit but because of everything changing and different things happening he wanted to make sure he could get a unit to match that one so he went on and got a hold of it anticipating maybe he's got more faith than I do anticipating that we would soon need it God is good and I've already anticipated the fact that we're going to have to pass the hat to pay the power bill cuz it was about $1,300 uh a total for everything this month and if you don't think that makes a difference in a month like July when when offerings are smaller and when the heat is intense and the air condition has to run over but you know if God can do that I'm not speaking negative oh no I'm speaking positive I'm just letting you know that it it's an ongoing thing it's an ongoing thing to have it God is good he's blessed us he's going to keep blessing us now remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place I've always been baffled by this verse of scripture and I've always wanted to say what did the poor Pastor have to do with any of this what did the poor Messenger to the age have to do with this because that's the Candlestick he's talking about he didn't say I'm going to remove the Candlestick out of its place as though it were an inanimate object like a lampstand he said out of his place if you don't get back to your first love God was saying to the Ephesian church I'm going to remove the light I'm just being honest I think many many many Bible scholars agree that that's the meaning I'm not making this up or pulling it from a quote somewhere that I think many people understand that God was saying to the church first and then to the age if you don't if you don't Embrace what I've sent you let's see how you do without it but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate those who try to conquer the leoty and treat them like little peons while they show us how Mighty and lofty they are in the things of God God knows that is not my intention however I'm very thankful for the experiences that God's given me through the years and I am fully persuaded that I could help a person or two along the way not to have to hit the same dead ends and slam doors and ceilings that I had to hit along the way any man with a heart would like to be able to spare his own children that's right from having to learn the hard way I always worry about a parent who has this attitude I learn the hard way he'll have to too I'm a little worried about that I don't think that's how it's supposed to work generationally I think each generation is supposed to try to set up the Next Generation to have a higher ceiling oh Hallelujah I am 56 years old I have lived more years behind me that I could possibly have in this earth ahead of me but I've got children not just natural children but I've got spiritual children who can go higher now don't wait for me to die for you to fly you can go higher now you can get more now than I was ever able to get you can accomplish more now than I was ever able to accomplish if you reach for it let me say let me just say if I were sitting where you were and someone just said that to me here's what I would have done amen that's what I would have done amen because it's it's worth putting a little effort to and don't you want your children I I know some people have this attitude you know they've got to learn by the sweat of their BR like I did they got to learn by you know being punched and knocked around like what my goodness you despise them the crying is that bad the diapers stink that bad that you would wish something like that on them woo my I would that they would go higher than I ever could find a place to go in Worship in the depths of the word may they go deeper than I was ever able to scratch let me read two4 in the Amplified before we go home but I have this one charge to make against you that you have left abandoned the love that you had it first you have deserted me your first love the only consolation that we have this morning the only way we can look at each other is we know that that was directed to the Ephesian church and to the Ephesian Church age but the reality is the spirit of the Lord has updated it and he's given it to us today and he's saying to us I like all your accomplishments I like all I like the fact you've paid off the property I like the fact that you've won many spiritual victories along the way but there's one little thing about you that I'm quite disappointed in and that is you've allowed your love to grow cold because you have left the reason why you started in the first place was him it was him first is is in in Greek it's protos and it it means foremost in order of importance before beginning best the chiefest the first of all and that word love as I mentioned a moment ago is the Agape I wanted you to see it affection or benevolence the quality of warm regard for an interest in another esteem affection regard love love feasts Agape is a word that is even used used to describe festivals of love and that's not the Olympics it's not talking about debauchery no it's talking about as Wesley preached it's talking about a feast of love when the saints of God get together and they start loving on him and all of a sudden they look around the room anybody ever had this happen you start loving on him and he starts loving on you and then you look around the room and everybody just starts looking lovable I've had it I've had it happen it's one of the reasons why I'm still standing here is because when I would be in the throws of Despair like Moses and I would be complaining to God about the hardheaded murmuring grumbling belly aing people that he called me to lead through the years you're not the only crop I've had and all of a sudden I'd get to church and I'd start loving on him and he would start loving on me and Josh I would look around the room at the same people that I had just thought in my mind hardheaded rebellious stubborn mean mean bitter rotten let's don't go any further and all of a sudden they would look like the most unbelievable successful Victorious handsome beautiful Godly Shining Light coming out of their faces and I knew that they hadn't changed that quickly I hadn't changed that quickly it could only be when you start seeing people through his eyes that's right come on aren't you glad that when he sees you he sees you through the blood if we ever catch a glimpse of one another in the glory through the blood the warts are gone the Crooked ears are gone the broken nose is gone the pimples are gone the bald head is gone the triple chin is gone it's the beauty of the Lord that shines out of us all are you with me good I need just a few more minutes you are you sure do you need to do a few Jumping Jacks and then sit down anybody I'd be happy for you to in the church age book the thyon age it's written I want to give a warning right here here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the leodan or last age now this word was not directed to the leodan church age it was directed to the Ephesian Church age but the evil of every age has culminated and become exacerbated in the leodan church age so here we are in the leodan chur or last age selflove and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God toys will replace the kingdom work we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us and many are going to find that to be the reality a few more turns and curves down the road the Oneness of unity I wanted to share this that now a pastor any cult some little literature you'd read might say to you the days of Miracles is passed watch what he says here because this was if I would have gotten to this place this is where I was going to take you in a different direction for a few moments I'll do that uh either Tuesday night or Sunday but but let let's get just a a a preast a foraste of of what it's about he said that's a good place for the devil to slip one of them Spirits in there and make you a worse person you was when you was a sinner how could anybody be worse in the church than when they were a sinner well I've been around and I want you to know it's possible cause the religious sinner do I need to preach is the worst of all you get a a a a man with a little bit of religion on him and still a desire for sin and he's the most miserable man in the whole wide world and he's never satisfied unless everybody around him is miserable because he knows too much he knows too much to enjoy the full benefit of his sin oh the testimonies I heard your amen sister Jennifer thank you uh the testimonies that I have heard through the years of following the Lord of people who had a touch of God in their life and didn't know no better so Friday night they go out with their friends they've been in the service had a touch of God in their life Friday night they go out with their friends to drink order the same thing they've always ordered getting ready to party and all of a sudden everybody's drinking up and the beer or or whatever is still sitting on the table and the tears start flowing and they I've heard this folks so many times I couldn't tell you how many times and people start coming back to the table what's wrong with you what's wrong with you why you're usually the one drunk first it's usually a contest to see if anybody can beat you getting out of your head I don't know what's wrong with me I don't know what's wrong with me all I know is I'm just not having a good time well just take a big sip of that and it'll help you toward a good time and I've even had them say I took a sip and it tasted like warm urine in my mouth because they had met something bigger something higher something more real something Eternal and it made them miserable not religious to keep on sinning miserable able until they got their full Deliverance but we're living in an hour right now especially in this watered down message environment where people can feel quite comfortable doing the same thing they've always done not realizing that the religious sinner is the worst of all that's the worst Jesus said so it's the worst Spirit now this week I'm closing may take me two or three minutes to do it but this week like last week I had a few battles in the night and really there would be no glory in describing any of it to you might even give the critics more ammunition and I can't explain why I experience these things and others along the way do but some don't I don't understand that I don't know why it has to be I know that Jesus Is the Victor and he has won the Victory and I don't know why we have to continue to war against Darkness but we do because it's our responsibility to appropriate the blood to appropriate the victory that Jesus has given to us and so many nights are wrestling matches with Darkness not because it would it particularly uh trying to take me out but but often times as an intercessor it's what is trying to steal something from someone else and so it becomes quite a match and I know there are others here who experience that God strengthen you and bless you and I'm just going to give you a piece of advice the best thing to do is not try to explain it because there's people sitting on your Pew right now that could never understand it but it just happens it's rare that I ever have to call for help but there were a couple of nights last week in Salt Lake City that the burden was so heavy and the Warfare so tremendous that I knew it was much bigger than I could do by myself out of my own environment 1,500 miles away and so I put that on the app because I wanted to know that others were praying it was the destiny of others that was being wared against in such a seductive way and all we can do is pray and plead the blood and ask for help and by the way I felt some help coming in here this morning you might have heard me say send them in bring them in I felt them I felt them coming I felt rein go back and catch you'll hear it I felt reinforcements coming in praise God this battle we we only know part of it lot of it's invisible isn't it I felt the strength of the Lord's host coming in God is jealous over you God is jealous over you he's jealous over your destiny he doesn't want you to have to take the fish ride he wants to pay your way I'll just give part of the line here he wants to pay your fair doesn't want you to have to pay but and so because of what I experienced even this week after coming home a couple of nights I I asked the Lord for answers uh why even talk about Darkness why even talk about the Demonic why even bring any attention to it and 2 Corinthians 2:11 just jot this down so you'll know so that if you're friends from other places say why is brother Shelly always talking about demons and battling spirits and so forth please understand this is the reason why Les Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not we're not ignorant of his devices we know how he works because we've fought him before and we'll fight him again and the Lord dealt with me and he gave me some Revelation to share with with you and I won't be able to get to the meat of it now but I'll just give you the I'll just gloss the top he identified to me in the word three spirits that we must contend with in this season of proving we're being proven you you can call it testing tested tried but we're being proven God is seeing if his investment in us has brought us any maturity or not you understand and these three I want to say spirits but I I should probably say uh that they are more like Legions of spirits or groups of spirits that are certainly assigned against the last day bride and I want you to be aware of them because we won't have time to go over very deeply with them now it's closing time number one seducing Spirits which very often are lying Spirits they're Christians who have a hard time telling the truth and every time you over ellish I want to make sure you're listening to me I know it's I know you're tired I understand that I I I do totally understand it if you are a person who loses the grasp of Truth when you're talking because you often embellish exaggerate or spin we only find and listen no one is immune brother brandham had to do battle with the spirit of exaggeration he said so he said I I have a tendency to exaggerate that's big boy got quiet you you you mean you rather think that you're the only one that had a battle I like it when I can identify that he had a battle and the Lord even had to battle with these things and uh you have to deal with it and if you don't if you if you uh dress up the truth if you spin the truth so that it makes you look better now if it really was that way it really was that way but if you're turning it around a little bit because you want to make yourself look a little cleaner o somebody's hearing me now what you don't realize is by doing that you are inviting a lying Spirit into your life it's a lie now the world will say there are black lies and white lies and gray lies and purple lies and pink lies but since the devil is identified as the father of all all lies I have to believe they all come from him so I don't believe there are different colors but if you believe there's different colors to your lying you just need to know the author of it all pink yellow red purple white black exaggeration whatever is the devil and it may look innocent tricks and pranks and when I was going through such a dark time in my life with my nerves I was having hideous anxiety attacks and I didn't want to leave the house I didn't want to be with people and uh eventually gave into to my mother's wishes and was given a medication which clearly could have taken me out I'm telling you the effects of that medication could have easily taken me out until I decided that the side effects were worse than the anxiety I'm just telling you my story if you want to know the name of the drug I can tell you later did it help you with your nerves and anxiety a little bit well it actually did it was under a spiritual attack and if you're under a spiritual attack medication is only going to help you so much anyway if it's a spiritual attack it's got to be one in the spirit spiritual battle's got to be one in the interesting isn't it but anyway yes it took the edge off but what it began to do in my life was physical awful physical and uh yeah physical side effects and it began to try to lower my inhibition and I found myself thinking and tempted to things that I had never thought about or and I kept saying to the Lord how would you allow this why would you allow the enemy to put something in my head that's never been in my head before and and after a lot of praying the Lord began to talk to me and let me know that the root of this problem now was the medication and I was strongly urged by the doctor not to quitt it cold turkey but I didn't want to spend another day wanting to run out and do something thank God that I had enough of the Holy Ghost to keep me or I would have run out and done the things that the enemy was putting in my head because I didn't feel the same guilt or the same conviction or the same you know strength it wasn't there and if you can be altered that way medically that ought to put a little bit of a stirring everybody in the house only God helped me through and your prayers and your fasting and your and and my rocking chair on the front porch and my songs singing you you remember the song that brought me through some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood that's what brought me through just singing it over my mind and head so tormented I thought I was going to die and I just start singing that song and one by one those Spirits would have to lift and and leave we open up our lives to lying Spirits when we exaggerate or spin the truth it starts off with a husband and his wife or a wife and her husband the best thing to do brother sister is tell the truth and face the music get that out of the way don't hide the bag the shopping bags in the closet or God might let you come who might show you some Spirit travel I better not mention this on the on the on the Stream but God let me see he let me take a peek one time in my own bedroom on the other side of the world I said to my wife on the phone what were all those shopping bags over there just joking and and she was wondering how in the world I knew well anyway we never had that problem we never hit it but if that's a problem don't hide it just tell him I did it if he beats you beat him back but don't let the enemy gray the truth because every time you spin it you don't have to tell me it was on sale I don't care if you bought it you work for the money you spent it you don't tell me how much money you saved me don't start that if you start that you're opening up your life because it won't just be a Twist or an exaggeration it'll become an open lie ballf face lie I am convinced that there are people who lie without being aware that they are lying because they have lost control of what comes out of their mouth now that doesn't mean anything anything to the world out there it doesn't mean anything to the church out there but I tell you if this is a spirit that the enemy wants to use to trip the bride we better know it because that little twist of the truth doesn't stop there it begins to to seduce and to deceive and we want to be aware the second thing that was highlighted to me in the word that we were going to have to contend with in this season of of proving is religious spirits and I just read to you where he said the religious Center was the worst center of all a religious spirit because in the family of religious Spirits comes delusions and someone can be under a delusion and have no idea they have absolutely no idea that what they're saying is a delusion it just comes out out of their mouth they don't even know how opposite of reality it really is and that's why you must as Believers we must be careful uh and we must be mindful when we say the Lord led me the Lord spoke to me the Lord directed me the Lord moved me we should be extremely careful when we say that because if we are falling under the attack of a religious type Spirit we can come into a place of delusion where we confuse the voices I don't believe the Bride Can ultimately be deceived but I believe the bride can be a attacked with delusional Spirits with religious spirits that will make you think I've had them come and sit in my office and say to me God told me to marry this woman and what do I say all I can say to you brother is this if God told you to marry this woman he has gone against his own word and he's going to be held accountable Mighty almighty God is going to have to give an account to gospel preachers who have preached the word all these years that God was not a lie somewhere somehow he's going to have to straighten it out with us you can't reason with people sometime when they feel like God has told them something or God is leading them and that's the saddest part the saddest part about it it would be better for you and I to say I feel this this is what I want to do this is what I think I should say it it it would be easier and better and safer to say that than to come to a place where we we confuse the voices just a little bit and we're just and and you know what the reality is no one is setting out to to be wrong it's simply a confusion that the enemy will pour on you like a bucket of water it's the spirit of the age it's part of the Babylonian spirit and it's a spirit of chaos and confusion and I'm telling you what you can be the last to realize I've been around you keep saying that I know I've been around long enough to to know that there are many people who finally break out and they say I was wrong I thought that I was doing exactly what God Said now I said to this particular brother who comes to my mind I said well brother I don't see how in my I don't see how in the my whole life I just cannot grasp how that can work and guess what it didn't it can't under those circumstances do what you want to do and don't even drag God God in [Applause] it but if you're going to put God in it make sure that you're not under a religious spirit right all of us every one of us can fall under that influence my wife grew up under a bit of that religious spirit type thing the heart of her parents was pure pure I know her dad is listening to this his heart was pure and it was right but the messages that he sent were confusing and that confusion and then blaming the Lord for your confusion can become a generational thing and it has to be broken give us an example well a Revival would come up and our brother would fall under conviction for having the television so he would go home and unplug it and throw the thing out the door and when that when the fervor of that Revival would lift he would realize that he wanted to see the news or he wanted to see Star Trek I'm using him as an example not to dishonor or disrespect him but to tell you how you've got to recognize these things coming on in your life and the children are just sitting there is it wrong or not wrong is it right or not right is this what we're supposed to do is this required for the Rapture or is it not required for the Rapture so it'd be better to leave God out of it allog together and just say look I've got a problem I really like uh space fantasy than to say God said it was wrong God said it's okay God said it was wrong God said it's okay and that is what makes this thing religious when we have to use religious terminology to justify what sometimes can just be emotional ter turmoil anybody listening to your preacher how do you come up with these things I've been around and the last is familiar spirits and familiar spirits are assigned to Generations like we were talking about generational iniquity they're assigned to generations and those familiar spirits can operate like uh sorcery which witchcraft but they don't have to operate in the realm of Witchcraft because technically any demonic spirit that you become so familiar with that you just keep repeating the behavior under the influence of this spirit it's almost like people making buddies with demonic spirits and they become so familiar and that is one of the reasons why we have to pray over our homes and we have to pray over our pets we have to pray over our children especially we have to pray over what we put them down in front of we have to be concerned about their cartoons let's see if we can get a little help here we got to be concerned about all of it because the enemy is looking for an doorway yes now he's out there bothering other people with you know uh sex and drugs and and what all else and that's not to say that none of you ever struggle in those areas but he's operating a little differently against the elect than he is against those who could care less and these were the three things that uh he helped me and I want to close with this and I'm not even going to read the quote but you look at being led of the Holy Spirit Minneapolis Minnesota because I want you all to this is how I wanted to end today I wanted to to make sure that you understand I want to be much farther along than I am but I wanted you to be sure to understand that there is a clear difference in being demon possessed and Demon oppressed now brother brandom is clear on the subject and the scripture helps us to understand that so when when we say if I should ever say to you have I ever said to you don't answer have you ever come to me and have I ever said to you that's a spirit if I have please understand I didn't mean necessarily that you were demonic that you were demon possessed brother brandham discerned often times that there was a nervousness in people he claimed his own nervousness as a tendency toward the spiritual and I believe it but he also recognize that there is another kind of nervousness and I've often noticed that when preachers are making the quotes about a nervous person being a spiritual person they miss the fact that there's another reason for being nervous and he tells us that a person can be nervous because they're being oppressed by a demon spirit and and and the the the body's reaction the emotional reaction to a spirit trying to influence our life is that we can become physically nervous now I maintain that if you respond negatively that way in nervousness it probably is an indication that you were born to have a deeper spiritual connection with God and the enemy is trying to hijack that uh you know anyone with with a gift in their life or a special calling of some kind whether it is music or preaching or or or Administration or whatever it is the enemy is going to do do everything he can to cross the signals in their life and so if they are spiritually sensitive to the light they're often also sensitive to the dark and I wish we could choose but we don't get the choice what we want to be able to do is operate in the Discerning of spirits we want to be able to know is this nervousness and anxiety because I am moving out of God's will or because I'm trying to make a move into God 's will and the only way we can do that is follow it down through the word we don't have to end up in confusion when we've got the absolute amen musicians are coming and we're standing it's 2:00 it's 2:04 we could just say we don't have time to worship and leave but I'm not going to do that some have already told me that they had an appointment and had to be leaving about two and I excuse you when you need to leave and understand 1,000% but for the rest of us we want to know that anything this standing between us and our first love is dealt with I want you to remember this I'm giving you one more very serious piece of instruction Jesus said to Peter Satan hath desired to sift you as sweet but I have prayed for you that your strength fail not and when thou art converted strengthen the brethren in this hour this late hour we need to be careful with our Mercy we we need to be careful with our benevolence we need to be careful with our sharing and with our giving of ourselves our time our finances sir we need to be careful that we're not extending unsanctified Mercy sir by turning our head when we need to be on our prayer bones we need to make sure that we are Spirit spiritually fit and Holy Ghost sealed filled and sealed up yes sir before we spend an enormous amount of time trying to help other people order their steps the Bible tells us the blind can't lead the blind and one of the problems that people get into in an in an hour like this is they start leaning on other sources for their Direction now you need a revelation of who your leadership is yes sir and when you get that uh Revelation and remember it can be for a season but when you get a revelation of who that leadership is you ought to listen that's right does that sound controlling well I have no way of forcing you to listen but you ought to listen yes because it becomes increasingly hard for your leadership to pray you out of a situation that you are in because you failed to listen to Godly counsel now I know that may sound a bit controlling but there's a reason why God gives us spiritual leadership in the Bible it's established in the Bible and there's a reason why he does that and if you would take foot now that but I but brother shy I want you to counsel me and I want you to do this and I want you to do that I've told you before I'll tell you again I'm not a professional counselor that's not my my gift I'm not a professional counselor you've got to be willing to listen for the voice of the spirit because he'll speak to you through those you you have confidence in even your friends in the church and the in the fellowship he'll speak to you through them and you've got to be able to discern is this them trying to give me advice or is this the Holy Spirit and it's not always easy to know the difference and so we got to walk a very soft walk and that's why when we see others struggling we've got to be very careful how we're helping them up if our own life is not set in spiritual order and submitted to spiritual leadership because that becomes your covering and protection when you start speaking into someone else's life you want to know right and that's why and and this is not even really what I'm referring to but that's why I so respect someone when they come to me and say look someone has come and asked this question and here's what I'm going to answer this is what I feel to answer but I just want to make sure that you're aware of the fact that that I'm doing I appreciate that so much because again that's not what I'm referring to in the moment but that gives that person that individual a protection because it means that they're not stepping out from under their authority to use Authority in someone else's life brother the best thing you can do for me is the best thing you can do for the one next to you on the Pew and that's pray for them call their name out out before the Lord and pray that God will raise up a holy boldness the boldness of a lion in their lungs that they will not only declare the goodness of God and the faithfulness of God but that they will have boldness to speak their own destiny purpose right out of their mouth I am an overcomer I am a bone who is finding his bone I am one and when all my bones get together he's going to come like he did in ezekiel's vision he's going to Breathe on Me Hallelujah and what was just a valley of bleached bones a few moments ago will now become a mighty exceeding Army standing on its feet ready to do the work
