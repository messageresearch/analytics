TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and tell you again as we do every week what a privilege it is to be able to speak to you about the things of God about the things that are true the things that are pure the things that are holy the things that are unshakable and that's the revelation of Jesus Christ that is an unshakable Foundation uh it's a foundation that you and I need to be planted on and we need our roots to go down deep deep deep into God's word the scripture tells us that that everything that can be shaken is going to be shaken in the end time to see that which can remain or will remain and uh there is a kingdom we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken the kingdom of our God the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's just a privilege to serve the Lord and I want to thank you for contacting our ministry all the contact information will be given to you on the screen please send in your prayer request EST and your comments just let us know you're watching um I like to tell my kids you know I have four children and um and a host of children in our community of faith and I like to tell them uh where people are watching so if I get an email from uh from Denmark or from the Netherlands or uh India or wherever we hear from precious people I like to to tell my children and they get excited to know that the little broadcast is reaching out all over the world I want to thank God for the gospel channel I want to thank God for Angel TV and any other network out there that's that's really preaching the gospel and making it possible for those who have a burden to to get their message out it's not our message it's the message of the Lord Jesus Christ but we want to get that out to the world and uh I have a i Pastor a small Church Our Community of Faith is not extremely large by any means and uh so it it's really a blessing to be able to to uh have a program on these networks so please pray for them that God will bless them and continue to allow them to expand uh their Outreach I want to continue our study today on the birth pays of the Messiah Jesus in Matthew chap 24:8 talks about uh in that chapter he's talked about some of the signs of of his coming and and the Nearness of the end Etc and in Luke chap 21 also he gives a list of things and in verse 8 it said but all these are the beginning of Sorrows and in many translations we find that the words there uh are the analogy of a woman in the travail of Labor a woman who is about to give birth and we all know that those contractions will grow in frequency and in intensity as the child's coming uh near and so we see this happening in all of the things that our Messiah mentioned the Lord Jesus all of the signs that he spoke about we see those things happening and we do see the frequency and intensity increasing so we know we're nearing the coming of the Lord one of the things that we watch for uh is uh we made a list of the 10 um uh categories I guess would be the right word uh from the words of Jesus uh that contain the birth Pains of the Messiah and we're counting backwards number 10 was signs in the sun and the moon and the stars we've covered that number nine was violence upon the whole earth number eight famines pestilences and earthquakes and then on the program last week we started talking about nations in distress with perplexity and Luke chap 21 and verse 25 says and there shall be signs and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity and the Sea and the waves roaring now that word perplexity means confusion not having understanding remember the scripture talks about men's Hearts failing them for fear fear of the unknown fear of the things that are happening around them and we as the people of God those who are born again of the spirit of the lord we must not move in fear we must not live in fear in fact we have to operate in the spirit of joy and uh you know even though we see a lot of things going on even God's people being persecuted we have to rejoice and we have to cling to the Lord like never before and not be caught up in the distress of Nations and in the perplexity we ended the broadcast last week by talking about our responsibility as Believers we may feel very very insignificant uh when it comes to what's going on in Nations but we as Believers have a responsibility and the authority that is necessary to pray for Nations and I pray all the time asking for the Nations calling them by name uh I keep a globe in my office I keep a a book of maps near my chair where I pray and and I often go through the globe laying my finger on Nations and asking for them asking that God would bring Revival asking that the Lord would break down the strongholds of Darkness the the predominant spirits that control uh the atmosphere over Nations that God would break the curses that have been placed over Nations because of foolish decis decisions made by government leaders uh do that on a on a regular basis and uh and the enemy does come sometime and say you fool you know who do you think you are but listen I I know who I am I just have to remind myself sometime I'm a son of the most high God and if you're born again you are too and we need to be uh busy uh in prayer and intercession asking for the Nations calling for a shift so that the gospel there are nations right now where the gospel El is really closed uh as far as uh the freedom to to take the gospel everything that goes on in particular Nations is underground and I pray that God will give uh open doors and bless the missionaries and bless those who are in hiding uh risking their lives and some are being martyred every day around the world for the cause of of the Lord Jesus Christ and we have an obligation to pray for their safety and for those who are smuggling the gospel into uh into unfriendly Nations I try to remember them in prayer and one of these days we'll get to shake their hand one of these days we'll get to hug their necks and meet those that have been the beneficiaries of our faithful prayers so don't let the enemy beat you up when it comes to your right to prayer you're being called boldly to the throne of grace in this hour number six in the countdown of the birth Pains of Messiah is false prophets and false teachers Matthew 24: 4 and 5 and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Messiah and shall deceive many there's going to be great deception in the world uh and it's going to increase as we move closer to the coming of the Lord there are false teachers and false preachers and false prophets and there are even those who have set themselves up as a Earthly representation of God on the earth and uh you know we we we want to we want to be careful about about putting our confidence and our trust in popes and potentates and uh and and Bishops and and so forth we want our confidence to be in the Lord Jesus Christ and of course we don't want to cast our confidence away from men and women used uh mightily of God but we don't want to be uh conquered uh by by the the man organized structure of today's Church Society either we want to have an ear to hear from the spirit of Truth we want to believe that that God can reveal his word to us and indeed he can and we need to ask him to and we need to position ourselves to hear and to see what the spirit would say to us as individual Believers in this hour thank God I believe there are Apostles and Prophets living today I believe that with all my heart but but even in that as as necessary and as beneficial as it is to get a word from an apostle or a prophet I do want to stress the fact that according to the newer Testament we can hear from God for ourselves if we're filled with the Holy Ghost ghost and so if you get in a place where you're confused and you don't know who to believe or what to believe go down on your knees just lay yourself out before the Lord and say I'm confused I'm perplexed I don't know who to believe I don't know what to believe I need you to send the Holy Spirit to reveal to me the truth of God's word and you know what he will he will do exactly that if we trust him and depend on him to do that uh in in second Timothy 4: 3 and 4 the scripture said for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables now this is a a time of apostasy and we're living still in a time of apostasy where people are more interested in general uh in having their their their itches scratched uh than they are to hear the truth and and they want to hear something that that promises them prosperity and wealth they want to hear something that says you can uh live any way you want to you know be as drunk as you want to be sleep around as often as you want to but because of Grace it's okay the Lord understands uh so forth and Etc well you can buy into that if you want to but you can't prove that by the word of God and uh if you think you could live any old life and uh and and sin against the truth of God's word and stumble around in unbelief and and because you're a member of the church everything's going to be all right I'm telling you you're wrong in fact you're deceived if you believe that and you need to have your eyes Anointed with Isa you need to take another look at the book and you you need to see what God's word is saying and you need to cut yourself off from those who would teach you those kinds of things that are not according to the scripture God is looking for a people who will surrender their entire lives to him and their decisions will be based on the leadership of the Holy Spirit and not the leadership of the flesh if you follow the desires and lusts of your flesh uh you're certainly not going to draw closer to God you you you you're going to have some temporary pleasure but you're not going to have peace and you're not going to have real Joy the churches in our nation have become uh so many of them have become about entertainment and uh about coffee hour and uh all kinds of things I I mean I don't even like to talk about it I don't like to get into it but um you know um no respect for that which is holy uh no regard uh or ability or discernment it seems like to be able to differentiate between that which is holy and that which is profane I believe the bride of Christ is going to be sharper than a than a knife I believe the bride of Christ is going to be able to discern between good and evil and between holy and profane and we're going to cling to that which is holy and shun that which is profane in fact we're willing to trade some of our churchianity traditions and stand on God's word in this hour because the church has embraced and adopted so many Pagan practices so many Pagan ideas things that have no roots no foundation in scripture and you start coming against some of that and I'm telling you you can cause a lot of trouble in your family or in your church so be careful how you handle the truth that you get a hold of but I want to encourage you to dig a little bit and discover just how far modern-day Christianity has fallen away from its found ation in scripture and uh it might behoove us I think in fact it does to search the scriptures by the help of the Holy Spirit and and search our lives and search the way we have always done things there's one thing we need to know if we always do what we've always done will always be what we've always been and you may be satisfied with that maybe you like what you've been but I don't uh I've dedicated the majority of my life to serving the lord but but I don't like the wasted time there have still been long seasons in my life that feel like I have wasted uh time and I don't like that I want to be busy about the service of the Lord that's one of the reasons why we come to you every week on the Eagles cry we want to sound an alarm I just want to be one voice crying in the wilderness I thank God that there are hundreds and thousands more that God's speaking through in this hour all over the world but I I'm not responsible for their message I'm not responsible for their sphere of influence but I am responsible for the calling that God has placed on my life uh you know I don't I haven't told it in a while here on the broadcast but but I had a visitation when I was just small my first visitation in the spirit realm I was 18 months old somebody said you couldn't possibly remember that well you have a visitation from the Lord and you'll remember it too and then when I was three I had a real encounter with God where my life was was revealed to me and uh my mother is serving the lord today and if you saw her she could tell you that I told her the next morning what I had seen how the Lord had come and what he had said to me and my life has followed the pattern that the Lord described to me when I was three years old and I haven't always pleased him I've made mistakes along the way and I've failed him many many times times but I I love serving the lord and I love following him and I want to spend the rest of my life doing everything I can to encourage God's people you see there's a bride that's being called out in this hour and that bride is just not satisfied with with uh laxidasical Christianity she wants the heart of God she wants to to burn with passion for the truth and uh part truth or false false uh hood is not what she's after she wants the whole truth even if it means that she has to walk away from some of the things that she's walked in Prior uh she now has this moment where the lights are turned on and she said wait a minute you know we can't we can't continue where we've been we've got to get up and move into the higher dimensions of the spirit into the Realms of Glory into that Revelation for one door come up here I want to show you some things see God wants to reveal himself to you because he loves you we're in the the countdown of the birth Pains of the Messiah and we have made it all the way down to this one where we're talking about false uh prophets and false teachers and the fact that people want to have their itches scratched instead of hearing the truth because the truth hurts a little bit sometime but Jesus is the truth to know truth is to know Jesus to know Jesus is to know truth so we need to ask the Lord for discernment to be able to know if we're sitting under uh something that's genuine or if we're sitting under something that's false we need to know we need to have the Discerning of Spirits because we're going to see uh a tremendous increase in false Messiahs and false teaching and false prophets and you know the Bible said in the Old Testament if a prophet prophesies a word in the name of the Lord and it doesn't come to pass he should be stoned now we don't do those kinds of things today but we do need to consider the fact that the prophets that are called of God are not going to be prophesying error they're going to be prophesying thus sayeth the Lord and it's going to come to pass and and we're going to see the word of God how does God interpret his word he interprets his word by bringing to pass so there's been a lot of Hocus Pocus in the in the prophetic and charismatic movement uh and in the Pentecostal world but but we want to move on beyond that and we can't we can't help now uh what has happened many leaders have fallen and and uh lives have ended Ministries have ended in Scandal but we can't be paralyzed by what's happened around us we've got to keep our eyes on the sun you see we're Eagles we're called as Overcomers we're living in the in the last part of of the age where those four uh creatures who released those four creatures Before the Throne Each One releasing an anointing over a a period of seven Church ages of History 2,000 years of church history we're now living in the age of the Flying Eagle anointing and uh that that's that age to soar to to go into the place of the spirit to hear the mind of God and to be able to Proclaim it here on the earth and that's what's happening in this hour so don't spend your time spending your wheels with things that are false but ask the Lord to to uh open your eyes and let you see exactly where you are and let's pray for those who the enemy is after in this hour uh you know there I I I saw a documentary not too long ago where thousands of people are flocking to this particular place where a man has proclaimed himself to be the re incarnation of Jesus Christ and and what looks like intelligent people are flocking there by the by the hundreds uh to live in this place of Peace With Jesus don't be fooled by that at all uh we should know better than such a thing the scripture has described what his coming will look like when he comes that's how he's coming and uh so in the second coming when he comes the Bible said every eye shall see him and that's not something somebody living up in a commune somewhere in the Alps or or or up in Northern India or wherever that's that's not the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we're going to do a study uh in the near future on the threefold uh manner of his coming and where we're going to talk about that that shout and that Trump and that voice of God that's going to wake up uh call for Resurrection in this great Resurrection Rapture or Resurrection catching way uh that is uh exclusively for the bride of Christ not not just anyone who who names religion but those who are truly Overcomers uh let's go to birth pain number five as we count down and that is an increase in uh end time technology the Prophet Daniel spoke about uh when when he was talking when he was getting the scroll and the scroll was to be sealed up Daniel 12:4 but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased now this is not always negative uh technology is not always a negative thing the increase of knowledge is not always a negative thing just think about how how amazing technology is today for the advancement of the Gospel I remember when the internet was becoming very popular for Ministries and we uh we we jumped on it we were just a small church but we jumped on it uh that's why we have a we have uh the address web address revival. org because we got in pretty early and so extremely early actually because I could see in the spirit and know that the internet was going to be a a an awful distraction I I knew that it would just be a matter of time that pornography would would would be uh readily available and filth and violence and you know people would begin to learn how to make bombs and everything else on the internet I could see all of that um it's just like television there's so much filth and garbage and Scandal on television but listen God is using the internet and God is using the medium of television to take the true gospel to the Far Corners of the world and so we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater but I think we can clearly say that uh the increase in technology in the past few years is a sure sign that we are nearing the coming of the Lord because Daniel described that in the end of time the last days knowledge would greatly increase increase and we're able to do more I remember purchasing a computer years ago and uh when we did it in in in in tiny little bites of information and I remember somebody saying you'll never use a gigabyte you you would never fill up a gigabyte and now we carry these little devices in our hand that are uh that that are multiple gigabytes and now we're talking about terabytes and things even larger than that and uh I have to delete things off of my children's iPod because they want to download a free game and the and the thing is so full that I have to uh delete something to be able to do it and and it's you know 16 or 32 megabytes or or or gigabytes or whatever um and so we can certainly say uh that that uh knowledge is increasing and that is definitely one of the signs of the coming of the Lord what we want to pray is that not only is natural knowledge increasing and and technology that can can do uh negative things and detrimental things we want to ask the Lord to redeem technology so that it can be used for the advancement of the Gospel think about this this broadcast you're getting it many of you on the internet many of you are getting it by a satellite that's hanging up above the earth and the the broadcast is being teed up to that satellite you pull it down with a satellite dish or a cable box right into your living room and and I'm here in Alabama and and uh we're broadcasting out of out of India out of Iceland and you're getting it wherever you are across Scandinavia across Asia across Europe in the United States you're getting this broadcast I'm telling you I love what the Lord is doing I love the fact that knowledge is increasing I just find it unfortunate that sometimes in the increase of knowledge people leave out God whatever you do don't leave God out of your life we need him and we need him as the old song said if you've ever needed the Lord before you sure do need him now and that's nothing but the truth we need the Lord I'm going to pray for you right now that God will deepen your experience with him that you'll you'll position yourself to experience more of the Lord that you will be free from the trappings of religion and that your heart will burn with a passion for a real relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ there's no peace in the world like the Peace of knowing that we know him and that he knows us and that we're in this thing together protected by the arms of our loving savior who paid such an extreme price let me pray for you now father thank you for the listener for the viewer I'm asking you right now to reveal yourself maybe there are those watching this broadcast who don't know you in Salvation I pray Lord that you will deal with their heart and that you will hear their Cry of uh asking for forgiveness as they repent before you and that you will fill them with the power of your spirit you will reveal yourself to them in this hour I pray Lord that uh each believer who's watching the program today will be drawn closer to you by the Holy Spirit their walk will become a more steady and stable walk and their hearts will continue to to be flooded with the joy of the Lord Heal the sick I pray according to your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our mess mesiah amen thank you for watching the Eagles cry I'll be back next week I hope you will because I want to share with you more of what the lord has laid on my heart thank you again for watching byebye for now [Music]
