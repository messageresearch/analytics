[Music] &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; The battle is over. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Victory is won. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Just place softly. Would you just worship him for a moment or two with your own words? Nobody leading you in song, but you just using your own praise vocabulary. Give him some praise right now. Would you do that? Lift up your voices to the Lord. Lift up your voices to the Lord. Whatever he brings, let him create praise on your lips. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God will create praise on your lips &gt;&gt; if you yield to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't let it lift. Just keep right pressing. Pressing. &gt;&gt; Spirit of the Lord. Spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Precious Jesus. &gt;&gt; Precious Lord.

The battle [Music] &gt;&gt; again without any words, without any song words. Use your own words. Just a moment. We worship you, Lord. We exalt your name. We glorify you Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; We glorify your name. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. You alone are worthy, master. You alone are worthy. &gt;&gt; You alone are worthy. Jesus, we've come today to ensure that you are exalted. Your name is hallowed and sanctified among us. [Music] We didn't come to see or to be seen, &gt;&gt; but we have come to lift you up. &gt;&gt; Your spirit has made this place holy. Your presence has made this room holy, the very ground holy &gt;&gt; because you have come. And we say come closer Lord. We say b come closer Lord. &gt;&gt; Minister to every heart. Put your finger on every need right now. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already done. [Music] Lord, if you if you need to be seated, you certainly can. I know you've been standing a long time. You can worship sitting down. &gt;&gt; We love you today, Lord. We don't want to miss you. We don't want to get ahead of you. We don't want to drag behind you. We want to walk with you, Lord. [Music] You didn't just want to lead us. You wanted to walk with us. &gt;&gt; You wanted to walk hand in hand with us, Lord. &gt;&gt; You've identified yourself as a co-inheritor, &gt;&gt; heirs of the father, joint hes with Jesus. Lord, that's who we are. &gt;&gt; What does it mean joint hes with you? My equal. It's an equal portion. This was your desire from the beginning to have a bride in the last days that you could pour an equal portion of who you are into them and they would make right choices in preparation for such a union, a holy union. It's so holy and so complete that many Christians find it almost offensive. There are some even here today who find it just too much work. Lord, convict our hearts. Convict our hearts, Lord, that we would realize that there is no price too great that we would win, that we would have union, oneness with you. Yes. &gt;&gt; May we have strength to quieten our own thoughts, our own minds. There will be a bride who has your leadership. one that you won't even have to speak to, but you will guide us with your eye. We will know you and know so much about you, and we will have experienced so much of our precious bridegroom, King, that we'll know what you want. And that's why you could trust that bride with thus sayaeth the Lord. This was the promise of the last of the last days that you would have a people, a bride who would not move unless she had thus saith the Lord. That wasn't just through one man. It was her being your voice, your microphone, your amplifier. to a world that's sick and dying. We bless your name. You alone are worthy. Father, even folk like us can get churchy. We can get to a place where we just barely make it through the motions. And then suddenly you come. And then there's those who can't really enter in because they're worried. They're concerned about what some streamer is going to think. They're going to question church order. So we just say today, Lord, that every church is sovereign. You placed an authority in the church and we lean on that today. We'll do as you would desire and we'll follow your leadership. &gt;&gt; No matter who's watching, may your presence reach through, &gt;&gt; minister to needs. Folks are pretty tired of church. They're looking for you to come and visit with us. We exalt you and we give you glory. We give you honor and we we give you time. We say have your way Lord. Your own way. Your way not ours. The Lord is good. The battle is over. Victory is one. It's already done. The battle is over. Victory is one. It's already done. [Music] Just be seated a moment. Just be seated a moment. Now you've stood in his presence. Now sit in his presence for just a few moments. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're so wonderful, Jesus. Let's sing to him just another moment. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Yeah. Hallelu. [Music] Do you know what you're singing? Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. When you say hallel hal is 10,000 praises, multiplications of praises. many myriads, multitudes in Hebrew of praises. Hal unto unto and there's no J. It's Yah. So it's multiplied praises unto Yah, God, his holy sacred name. Sing it again now that you have been reminded what you're saying. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Lord, we love you. Do you love him? Lord, we love you. Lord, we love you. Lord, we love you. Are we together? Lord, we love you. Lord, we love you. Lord, we love you. Lord, we love you. [Music] Don't we love him? &gt;&gt; Why else would we choose this life if it wasn't because we loved him? Bless his name. Bless his name. The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. With all life's frustrations, I need you. And I know I do. Cuz the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. With all life's frustrations, I need you. Oh, I know I do. [Music] are the only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. Yes. The only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you. [Music] Is that your testimony? &gt;&gt; I I said, is that your testimony? &gt;&gt; Maybe you find peace in something else. There's no peace in this world, but in him. Right? &gt;&gt; I mean, you get out in God's creation, you feel his presence, you feel peace. That's because he's there. &gt;&gt; It's not because the trees are pretty. &gt;&gt; It's because he's there. I feel him. &gt;&gt; I felt his wonderful visitation through the night. And um I know that he's here and I know that he wants to speak to our hearts. I don't want to disturb him. But let's thank God for the musicians. We're so thankful for their labor among us. I don't want to scold you all in any way, but I'm going to ask you all to skip your coffee break. I'm going to ask you to go to the restroom and come on out here and be with us as quickly as you can simply because I don't want you to uh to spend any time outside of his presence if you can help it. Um, he is saturating somebody. I want to be that somebody. I want to be a sponge and soak it all in. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful Sunday for Christie to be with us today, Sister Williams's niece. And I say that because she's a worshshiper. She loves to worship. What a presence uh to for her today. And uh because it's her and she knows us and we know her and she knows the church, then we don't have to we don't have to put on airs. We can just be who we are in worship and she's just right there with us. Thank you so much for having that lovely spirit. We're glad you're here. Glad he's here. We did. We invited him, but we didn't have to. He was coming because we came. &gt;&gt; He comes with us. &gt;&gt; Uh we miss those who are not here today. We have quite a number of people out and sometimes I wish we had a a chat board or something where we could post in there and say I'm going to be out of town because then maybe somebody who uh had the thought, well, I don't know if anybody going to be gone, so I'll I'll go away this weekend. Well, if they knew maybe so many were going to be away, they they might would schedule a little differently. I don't know. But uh we it is what it is. God is good to us. We're not upset with people for for being away. No, not at all. In fact, I've stood in the gap uh two times uh this week even today asking the Lord just wait a little longer. He promised us he has promised us many great things and I wouldn't want anybody to miss it. Anybody understand? I would want everybody to be right in the middle of it. Let's stand if we can. And I'll tell you if I get the liberty, I'll share with you a couple things that he visited me with in the night. And I want Liberty to do it. And if he gives the liberty and you pull the liberty in, then we'll do it. If not, we'll hold it. But um God is good. Matthew chapter 13 verse 34 and 35. We are still in a series of sermons. We are making our way from the vine to the king's table. from the choosing and washing and crushing of the grapes all the way through the processes of fermentation so that we can one day be wine in the chalice of the great king. And you sang about it today. Now on the pathway the wine press falls heavy, but it's bringing forth only the best of the wine. &gt;&gt; Would you choose it any other way? Wouldn't you want to be the best of the best? &gt;&gt; And the only way to do that is uh perhaps to be submitted. It the I think the verse goes on to say uh so into submission and and uh that's a big thing. It's a big thing to to agree to. There are certain things that you agreed to before you got here and there are some things that you will agree to now if you if you get to move forward in him. &gt;&gt; And um I saw mantels, I saw anointings, I saw scrolls, I saw the callings of the Lord last night and um I saw them. I I don't know how to say it exactly, but um I believe that we come here with a with an assignment and with a prefixed destiny according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; I I believe we can fall out of God's perfect will. Just lay a foundation here. We can fall out of God's perfect will into a permissive will. And we pray when we come back to the perfect will that God will redeem the time and that anything we missed while we were cold, indifferent, or backslid or whatever you want to call it, encumbered by the snares and troubles of life that God will redeem it and bring it back to us. But I saw something last night that I don't know where to place. I'm not sure exactly how to theologically place it because I saw that there were uh things that God intended to accomplish, things that he wanted, he desired to do through our lives, but I saw them filtering down like trickling down to other people because many have not been willing to take what is theirs. And I've always sort of thought in my mind, well then it's just held in reserve for us until we get ready to go and obey God. But that's not what I saw in the night. What I saw in the night was it was nearly bypassing. And I thought, how horrible, how tragic that these promises would bypass some, but they were it was trickling down to others. And I saw that uh and I asked, you know, I prayed into it. I'm stumbling because I want to be careful how I say it, but I prayed into it and the Lord put a piece in my heart. And he let me know that there's a remedy uh for that. There's a prevention for that. And that is if we all just get willing as fast as we can, ready to submit to him as fast as we can. Uh because I don't mind you getting good things from God. I don't mind you doing some of the things that I'm called to do, but I won't mind. You understand? I'm not jealous over what he's called you to do or what he wants you to do, but what he wants me to do, I want to do it. &gt;&gt; I want to get the reward for it. &gt;&gt; And so, if I were you this morning, I would uh this is what I've done. If I were you this morning, I would make it a serious uh concern in my life to say, "Lord, I'm stepping up." I I just I saw that many are putting things off just like you've got all the time in the world. None of us do. Doesn't matter how old or how young. That's not how God does these things. None of us have much time to get done what we've been called to get done. And we are not the ones who get to decide the timing. We we can't say, uh, Lord, I'd like to do that when I get old, or I'd like to do that when I get married, or I'd like to do that when my children are raised. I need to know you're hearing me. &gt;&gt; Um, but we shouldn't do that. We should say, Lord, your will in your timing. &gt;&gt; And and and then we ought to hear the spirit when he says, "Now is the time. Now is the time. &gt;&gt; Now is the time. And And why not now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we've waited for it &gt;&gt; plenty long. Matthew chap 13 verse 34 and 35. I wasn't sure I would be able to pull myself back out of that place to even get up here. And I appreciated Joshua. I didn't ask him to take the service. uh he knew that brother Greley was gone and he and he mentioned it and he never said I'll well I'll do it. He just did it. I appreciate that very much and I'm glad that he would just keep singing until we could move on. Uh because some people they they wouldn't wouldn't want to do that. But you know there's a there's just we just get into a place sometime we can't do it. We just can't move. I don't want to move. &gt;&gt; You ever been there? I don't want to move. I want to stay right where I am cuz I don't want to change anything I feel. &gt;&gt; Matthew 13 uh verse 34 and35 we we covered the the vessel of misunderstanding. Now we've entered in to a vessel of public gaze which is a shallow vessel with a wide opening. And this was where the Lord took me in the night. All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables, and without a parable spake he not unto them. I want you to think about that just a minute. Just just think about it a moment. All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables. And without a parable, outside of a parable, he didn't say anything to them. It's interesting that it might be fulfilled. You you you've wondered in your mind why why was he always teaching parables like object lessons? Here's the reason. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying, "I will open my mouth." Old Testament now I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. No better mouth, no greater voice than God, his word in flesh &gt;&gt; to come along and speak those secrets that had never been spoken from before the foundations of the world. and and yet in a parable. Secrets yet in a parable. May God add his blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. And you who are so weary in the knees right now from standing so long, remember me. You would think that if God was going to speak to us as the prophet prophesied that he was going to speak things that had been kept secret from the foundation of the world and now the word has been made flesh and he's on the scene. Wouldn't you think that the secrets would be so easy to to hear and to discern and interpret and understand that he could just open his mouth and speak plainly? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you think that? But the Bible said it was parables that he spoke in. And without parables, he said nothing. &gt;&gt; And he did it because he was here to fulfill what the prophet of the Old Testament said. I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. So even in this day where we have had the mysteries of the ages preached to us, delivered to us one generation ago. And there are so many who like to look at those things and tell us we know it all and we've received it all and we understand it all. And yet we realize that many of the things that were spoken to us were in parables. We could almost call them riddles because if you say one thing in one sermon and the next sermon say something entirely different, either you're delusional or you're speaking in a parabolic way. For those who have ears to hear, let them hear what the spirit says to the church. There are just certain things that cannot just be put out there as plainly as he would have liked to have done it, as plainly as a pastor would like to do it. Uh because it would just be so confusing to some who have so little spiritual discernment that that they they just wouldn't be able to catch it. And we get in a vicious cycle of that kind of thing through the years. There's always somebody in the house that is quick to misunderstand and take something to to a wrong understanding or to a place where it doesn't need to be. So that's why it's vital that every one of us have the baptism of the Holy Ghost for ourselves. &gt;&gt; And you don't have the Holy Ghost because you believe Brother Brandham is a prophet. That's nonsense. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have the Holy Ghost because your mother had the Holy Ghost or your father had the Holy Ghost. That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have any grandchildren. &gt;&gt; And and even the devil believes &gt;&gt; that God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Sure enough. &gt;&gt; In fact, he has a five-fold ministry in the earth right now. And in that five-fold ministry, there are apostles and prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists. And they're not competing with the messengers to each of the seven church ages. They don't have to compete with them. I don't have to compete with Paul. &gt;&gt; If there's an apostle in the land, he doesn't have to compete with brother Brandham &gt;&gt; because those messengers had their office, their job, their commission, and they did it. and God took them off the scene &gt;&gt; in spite of what some people think. If if brother Brandham had not finished the commission that God gave for him to finish, he would have never I tell you if you are a person who believes that the devil has more authority and power in your life than the one who created you. I feel sorry for you. &gt;&gt; You see, I heard a message that has certainly made it real to me. The devil can't kill me. until God is through with me. &gt;&gt; I don't understand why that happens in some people's life in their 20s &gt;&gt; or their 30s. &gt;&gt; And being an empath, it breaks my heart &gt;&gt; when I hear news. I'm making my way through a writing uh of a woman who has become some kind almost a scientist. And I'm not going in to the detail of what I'm reading about, but it's very interesting because it is confirmation of something that the Lord showed us some years ago. And I finally found somebody who could write about it in a rather scholarly way. And her her understanding, she's not a preacher. I'm not reading a woman preacher particularly, but I'm reading her her understanding of numbers. I like it. And this for her, it was birthed out of a horrible tragedy. Three older children and a gap and then six children. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Can you imagine? Nine children, three older, six younger. And coming back from an event, all six of those children died. at one time in an automobile accident and her life was devastated and ruined and she didn't know how she could face another day and God began to show her some things that comforted her heart to let her know there's more waiting on us &gt;&gt; than just gold streets. &gt;&gt; Interesting. A lot of times the greatest things that God quickens and makes real to us in our life, it it's birthed out of a lot of pain &gt;&gt; and a lot of sorrow. And I don't believe there's any real worshippers in this house that haven't known at least their share. And some people might say more than their share, but then that would again question the sovereignty of God. &gt;&gt; That's where a worshshiper is born. But if a worshipper has come through some horrible things and has truly repented, God restores their heart for him. &gt;&gt; And those are the ones that you're going to see doing the extra, going the extra mile. Not just a hand lifted up or singing along with a song, but you're going to see some pushing a little beyond the comfort zone. Maybe they're not. Maybe they're not pushing beyond their comfort zone. Maybe they are. Maybe they're pushing. They're pushing beyond your comfort zone. Good. &gt;&gt; If my praise agitates you, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; may it provoke you &gt;&gt; to be more than a nominal Christian. &gt;&gt; There, this message didn't come to nominal Christians. &gt;&gt; It came to overcomers. &gt;&gt; And somebody's going to overcome. &gt;&gt; I am. Me, too. &gt;&gt; That ought to be your testimony. I'm going to overcome. It's not a time to fill your life with so many things other than the word. &gt;&gt; We're coming down now to an hour where it's got to be the word we feast on more than any other thing. &gt;&gt; You understand? So vital, so important. And what God's doing right now, there's a burden over the house. That's the Lord. The burden of the Lord. Jeremiah called it. It's the burden of the Lord. Jesus called it the zeal. quoting after the prophet when he said, "The zeal of a my father's house hath consumed me." There's a zeal over this house. And really, the message to you this morning is get in &gt;&gt; or you're going to be left absolutely sitting there with a wonder look on your face trying to figure out what blew through here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham referring to some of those visions that are now so questioned among the critics. He said, "It passed right through me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could have had the silver tip grizzly. God had always been faithful to give him what he showed him, but that was because his servant was always cooperating. It it it takes some cooperation on your end to bring a vision to pass. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If there's a vision that God's going to meet you at such and such a place on such and such a day, I wouldn't see how far I could get away from that place on that day. &gt;&gt; Would you? I'm just trying to talk in simple terms. I'd want to be right in the middle of wherever that word came and and and nothing lost. But but brother Brandon was talking about the weather. Some things were shifting there over the camp and he got pulled a little out of the perfect plan. &gt;&gt; And he said that vision went right through me and there was no real actual fulfillment of the silver tip grizzly. And many have said that makes brother Brandham a false prophet. I tell you it does not. It makes him a human being. &gt;&gt; And if you can't see him as thus, you really don't have any place among us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because God wanted us to see both the divine purpose &gt;&gt; and the human vessel, &gt;&gt; right? There was no silver tip grizzly fulfillment, but he recognized where it was missed and he said, "It went right through me. I don't want that to be my story. Maybe I just interpreted my own question. Maybe the answer came to my own question. I I was trying to figure out this morning reflecting back on what I saw. How is it that that it can be assigned to me and then filtered down to somebody else if I'm not in the right place at the right time? If it was for me, if it was to me, if it was something that I was supposed to do, maybe the uh the Holy Ghost, the brown bear. Thank you so much. Uh it was the brown bear, the silver tip he got. Oh, I'm so thankful that you texted and that I saw it. Thank you. Because that would have been more emails than I could possibly answer this week. Maybe I've answered my own question. If God has something assigned for us, we're not where we ought to be to to get it. Maybe it it it's not going undone. I can't accept that God will let something go undone. That's the old church mentality. I came out of a denominational church that that sort of believed that uh there would be people that would go to hell because there was nobody to tell them. And that's how they drafted all the missionaries. And that's how they forced people to get out and do things. And some of them were some of them were called and some of them were sent. And some of them just got up and went because they were under guilt. And they were told there's going to be souls crying out in hell. Why didn't you tell me? Now, that's not what we read in scripture. By the way, &gt;&gt; in scripture, we read that that it's not it's God's responsibility. &gt;&gt; To reveal itself, &gt;&gt; we just have to say yes. And if you won't say yes, somebody else will say yes. But because you said no doesn't mean that someone is to be lost. That's you you you can't you can't shift scriptures to fit a mission purpose. &gt;&gt; It is what it is. Let me tell you something. God can send angels. &gt;&gt; God can raise up orangutangs. &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; He spoke through a jackass. multiple times really. &gt;&gt; But once Balam's &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; he finds a way. &gt;&gt; There's you a blooper. Put that one in. &gt;&gt; Cussing in the pull pit. Donkey just wouldn't have fit in that moment where I was feeling. God can use a rooster. &gt;&gt; When I first come around the message, somebody said, "Well, reckon God could even use a woman?" like like a woman should be in the same category with a rooster or a donkey. Of course he can. He can use a woman. If he can use a man, he can use a woman. &gt;&gt; That is ridiculous. And there's more divorces and remarages that run in that kind of preaching &gt;&gt; than in the kind of preaching we're doing here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a woman can only lay down and be stepped on for so long and then she decides, "Look, I I got to find something. God's got to help me, too. If he can help you, he's got to help me. I've got to get some help here from the Lord." And uh you know how it goes. Now, uh you'd think that we would have all the answers and that what spoken to us through Brother Brandon would have been always so plain that anybody could get it. and he seemed to think in his understanding that it was as plain as it had ever been. But now that he's off the scene and we go back and listen to what he said and read what he said, we find out that there are still huge questions &gt;&gt; that we would like to understand better. And only the Holy Spirit can do that. And that's why we've got to have him &gt;&gt; for ourselves. &gt;&gt; You've got to have your own experience with God. You do believe that, don't you? &gt;&gt; You've got to taste the original mana for yourself. You do believe that, don't you? That's a quote. &gt;&gt; So, you can amen that. &gt;&gt; We've got to go in. And listen, that that mana doesn't come out to where we are. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; We have to go into where it is. &gt;&gt; It's behind the veil. &gt;&gt; It's in the ark of the covenant under the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; That's where the original pot is. So, you're going to have to I'm going to have to figure out how to get in there and get some of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has made a way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has made a way. He's made a way, but we don't want anything to pass right through us. We want to be right on it. &gt;&gt; And so, may God help us all uh to understand uh every parable and every symbol. And um you murmurers, some of you who murmur lately, and you say things like, "I don't know why all the talk about the vision is or I don't know why they're all why they're excited about that." You know, you need a life, &gt;&gt; you need to get out of your own head. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. You need to understand that God gives parables because he wants to give interpretations. &gt;&gt; He gives symbols because he wants to get understanding. He wants to give understanding. He wants you and I to get understanding. &gt;&gt; And if we don't understand the s symbols, we don't we don't even know the parables. How will we know what the parable is trying to tell us? Oh, I'll give you examples because this is the vessel of public gaze. &gt;&gt; That means you're going to be looked at. &gt;&gt; How many of you don't like to be looked at? Be careful how you say that. Cuz sometimes our lifestyle says something else. We love to be seen. The reality is the deepest part of who we are, we'd rather just hide. I think the servants of God would just rather hide behind who we are and just do what we do without anybody else knowing it. I'm sure you feel that way. But there are times that God turns a spotlight on you &gt;&gt; because he wants to refine you &gt;&gt; and he wants to get you to a place where he can use you as an example. &gt;&gt; And true refinement doesn't take place secretly. It often takes place publicly. You see, in order to hang in the hall of faith or the hall of fame, &gt;&gt; you first got to hang in the hall of critics. &gt;&gt; He's you're going to be scrutinized and studied and &gt;&gt; and and then the end result is going to be like what it was for Abraham. Can you imagine that? God his testimony, his memorial in the hall of faith reads. Can you imagine? It reads, "And Abraham staggered not at the promises of God." &gt;&gt; If if you're standing in the hall of faith, that's what his testimony reads. &gt;&gt; Abraham staggered none of the promises of God. You and I knowing the scripture, we know he staggered. &gt;&gt; We know that he decided, I'm going to put, you know, my thoughts in here and and sound like Sarah had a good idea. And it was a product of Sarah's mind and Abraham's loins &gt;&gt; that produced an Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Didn't turn out too good in the end. &gt;&gt; Still didn't turn out too good if you've read the news. &gt;&gt; It's still the seed of Ishmael &gt;&gt; that's mocking the sons of the promise, the sons of Isaac. still today just just like just like but Abraham being a patriarch uh we honor him and we're thankful for him and we learned something. We learned that no matter what he did, no matter how he moved, God so redeemed and so sanctified his story &gt;&gt; that now we read in the New Testament you staggered not. You know how many of you have staggered? We're not going to get over there and read about it. We're going to get over there and read Isabelle staggered not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brent staggered not &gt;&gt; at the promises of God &gt;&gt; because he's redeeming purposes in us. Don't you fret. If you won't do what he called you to do, &gt;&gt; somebody's going to raise up and do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, just remember this. They're going to get the reward. &gt;&gt; You don't get to be slouchy, sloppy, &gt;&gt; disobedient, and still get the blessing. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I don't really care about the reward if I can just have eternal life. If I can just see Jesus." I want you to know something. You may not uh may not care much about it now. But if you could catch a glimpse over there at eternity and understand there's only one class of people that's going to live with him &gt;&gt; in the city. &gt;&gt; That's those who wear the overcomer's garment. &gt;&gt; And it's a cloak of humility, not a cloak of pride, &gt;&gt; not a cloak of religious pride. It's one of humility. The church at large, the denominational church at large, those who call upon the name of the Lord and find salvation, their place is certainly at the base of the mountain. They they see the glory. They worship God. They bring their praise unto God. But it's only his wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. That lives with him inside that pyramid city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That mountain of Zion. And brother, you're going to want to be there. &gt;&gt; If you have an invitation to be there, you're going to want to be there. &gt;&gt; Now, over there, you know, to have eternal life, no, there'll be no jealousy there. There'll be no envy there. And so, that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; But if you've got an opportunity to go all the way, you ought to do it. &gt;&gt; Anybody following me? &gt;&gt; We can answer questions later if you have some. So here we find that in the vessel of public gaze, we're going to be looked at and scrutinized. Now, I shared with you an experience last Sunday. I had to rush through it because I did so much other preaching like I'm doing now. So I'm going to slow down a little bit. I'm going to share it again for a reason. I have a I have a bit of a commission to do it. and I'm going to do it and then I'm going to show you some things in the scripture really really uh carefully and but hopefully quickly as possible. Some years ago, we were having a wonderful time in a beach house in Fort Morgan. and brother and sister West had arranged to have that house for the week and we were invited to come and and and spend some time with them and we did and and we found out how different Fort Morgan, Alabama is from from even Gulf Shores and Orange Beach and we saw sea life that we hadn't seen anywhere else and we just enjoyed it. And Mariah was just a little baby at the time. She turned 19 this past week. She now has her own automobile. She paid for it in cash. Isn't that pretty good? &gt;&gt; Pretty good. Pretty good. And this time she was just a little baby, so I volunteered to stay behind a couple days while she napped. And then when she would wake up, I would take her back down to the beach. And I was laying her down. She was asleep. And I went in uh tiptoed out of the bedroom into the little bathroom that was adjacent. And I thought, I might get a shower. I feel so sticky. Then I thought, "No, that might wake her up. I better not do that. I'll just wash my hands." And so I found some liquid soap and I just wanted to wash the nasty beach salt water and that sweat and sand mixed together. You know what I'm talking about. It's fun when you're there, but as soon as you get away from it, you want it off of you. Or at least I do. And uh so I went in and and I began to wash my hands and I there was a towel hanging there and I thought, "Well, we can wash those. I guess they're for us to use." And I reached up to dry my hands on that towel and a voice spoke out in in in the room. I mean, to me it felt like an audible voice. Perhaps it was an internal audible voice, but it sounded almost as though if you'd have been there, you'd have heard it. Now, if you've ever had that happen, it's hard to explain. People look at you funny when you call it audible, but audible simply means you were able to hear it. &gt;&gt; I either heard it with my natural ear or my spiritual ear. I'm not sure if you would have heard it if you were there, but a voice spoke out and said, "I will give you a sign and I will make you a gazing stock." What a what a strange I I'm just washing my hands. You know, I'm not asking for something spiritual, just drying my hands. But the words affected me deeply because there was a part of me that responded to this message. I will give you a sign. Yes, Lord. That sounds good. But quick reflection on I'll make you a gazing stock. No, Lord, that doesn't sound good. Not that. It was like a deep cut. I couldn't imagine at the moment what it was about. I certainly had not been asking for any form of promotion. But the very thought of becoming a spectacle, exposed, inspected, scrutinized, and even further ridiculed was unsettling. He just did what he often does. He repeated the strange sentence again, this time much louder. And I think I would describe it as forceful. He said, "I will give you a sign and I will make you a gazing stock." And yet even the second time I dared to say, "No, Lord. No, not that." I can't say that at the moment I could even fully begin to unpack the process or digest what it could completely mean. But I knew that it didn't sound like fun. And as I said last week when I mentioned it to my wife, she didn't think it sounded like fun either. She didn't think it sounded fun to be married to a gazing stock. She didn't seem thrilled with it at all. I just prayed into it. Whatever it means, Lord, I know that eventually I'll have to say yes. Isaiah 7:11 was the scripture that he gave me. And and and you can put that up for us if you will. Ask via a sign of the Lord thy God. Ask it either in the depth or in the height above. In the amplified it says, "Ask for yourself a sign, a token or proof of the Lord your God, one that will convince you that God has spoken and will keep his word. Ask it either in the depth below or in the height above. Let it be as deep as shol as the grave or as high as heaven." I I like that part. Uh it seems like asking abundantly and I I like asking abundantly. Don't you? If you ask abundantly, you can expect an abundant harvest, an abundant result. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I told the Lord that if it was about scrutiny and criticism that that I seemed to have been a magnet for that my entire life since before I was even seven years old. So, I wasn't really asking for much more of that. And he called me again, this time to Hebrews 10:32:33. Didn't you just read this? I did. I'm reading it again. But call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions. Just when you think you fought them all, here comes some more. partly whilst you were made a gazing stock, both by reproaches and afflictions, and partly whilst you became companions of them that were so used. Now, do you understand what he just said? You know, I made you a gazing stock and I joined you to other gazing stocks. Well, thank the Lord. Then I thought I got something to praise him for. If I'm going to have to be a gazing stock, at least I can be joined to other who others who have been chosen to be gazing stocks. How many of you know there's a little bit of there's a little bit of comfort in knowing that it's not just you that's going to be evaluated, inspected, scrutinized, carefully worked over. That somehow brings a little comfort. I'm thankful for that. You've been there, some of you. In the Amplified, it reads, "But be ye ever mindful of the days gone by in which, after you were spiritually enlightened, you endured a great and painful struggle, sometimes being yourselves a gazing stop, publicly exposed to insults and abuse and distress, and sometimes claiming fellowship and making common cause with others who were so treated. I I needed some answers. And the Lord began to unpack the answers. And I want you to understand it because if you haven't lived it yet, you're about to. And you won't be able to come back and say, "We had no clue. Nobody told us." You You're warned. A gazing stock is a person or or a thing gazed at by many, especially with curiosity or contempt. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people are looking at you crazy because they're trying to figure you out. &gt;&gt; They're amazed at your unusualness. &gt;&gt; Your nature toward weirdness, &gt;&gt; the world calls it. uh your peculiar way and and they're squinting as though it helps them to to know you better. You see them across the room trying to figure you out. There are other times that someone is looking at you like that because they don't like you and they want you to know they don't like you. So they're squinting and they're looking and they're evaluating and they're thinking in their mind. There are some of them holy rollers. There are some of those blue jean skirtwearing women. They must all have 10 children and a hateful husband. People are always trying to figure out why you do your hair different and why you don't do exactly like everybody else does. And they're just sure that you must be a part of an abusive cult. And so they're watching you carefully. Some because they're interested in the in the look of uh of joy or uh the the light on your countenance and others are looking at you with disgust. Why don't you come on in to this century and why do you have to look like you came across I remember in the 80s when they used to talk about the church they would say you folks look like you just stepped off the Mayflower. It's obvious that people in this area don't know very much about what Amish are because we were also accused of being Amish a time or two just simply because we did a little different than somebody else. You knew it when you signed up. &gt;&gt; Nobody sold you anything and then later gave you the rules. &gt;&gt; You've been called. You've been appointed. You've been chosen. You've been singled out &gt;&gt; because God wanted you to be a parable. &gt;&gt; Hear this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He wanted you to be a parable &gt;&gt; in a confused world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The message hasn't been interpreted yet of of what you are and who you are. But it will be when you bring forth the proof, &gt;&gt; when you manifest the the tokens &gt;&gt; that you have been with him. That's when the understanding will come to the parable that you are. &gt;&gt; Oh, I see. Now, you see, they speculate and they and they scrutinize and they try to figure it all out and and they say, "Well, I bet they don't listen to country music." That's right. &gt;&gt; I expect they don't even wear bikinis. That's right. They're just constantly trying to speculate, figure out, and guess. But there's a promised season coming for the bride &gt;&gt; where she will rise up into the fullness of the whos sunship, &gt;&gt; full adoption, full manifestation of sunship. It won't be a year-long revival. It won't be a decadel long move of God. It'll be a short work. &gt;&gt; It'll be a quick work, but it will be the manifestation of the sons of God on the earth in a way that the world has not completely ever seen except in a demonstration of a mature fruit, a wave sheath offering. Christ being the first. Every messenger to his age also in some way waved over the people so the people could catch a glimpse of what an overcomer looks like. But it won't be just one man overcoming as we get ready to leave here. It'll be a body of people. I wouldn't call it a multitude, but I would call it a group of people all over the world that have been singled out, picked out to be picked on. &gt;&gt; Chosen to be picked on. &gt;&gt; Chosen to be spending some time in the fermentation vessel of public gaze. Looked at as a parable that can only be understood as a parable until the interpretation comes. and the interpretation will be the manifestation of his life. &gt;&gt; When you and I can manifest that life and that perfect love, nobody then will have to try to figure out anymore what you are &gt;&gt; or who you are. &gt;&gt; They'll know. They'll know. They'll know because they'll see the life of Jesus Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Will there be a harvest? Of course. There has to be a harvest. &gt;&gt; You can't put men and women on the planet who have the power of the creative spoken word, who live under the word revealed in their day and manifest the very life of the one who redeemed them and not expect others who have not yet had faith, who have not yet believed. You can expect that they'll just forever stand back gazing and not want to understand and become a part of what you have tasted. &gt;&gt; Some will move by curiosity and will quickly fall by the way. But there will be those whose seed of destiny is awakened in that hour. even loved ones who God has held out of this truth &gt;&gt; until such a season as the one I'm describing &gt;&gt; because he knew more about our loved ones than we knew about about them. And he knew that some people can take the criticism and the scrutiny and the church hurt and the church abuse and all the things that happen on a Christian's journey. Some can take it and weather it and come out on the other side smelling like Christ. But others would be like the children of Israel in the beginning. He said, "I couldn't take them straight in or else they would have become dismayed. They would have become confused by facing the enemies. &gt;&gt; So I had to bring them by a what? A desert route. I'll read you a quote in just a minute where brother Brandon predicts it was 40 miles. How could it possibly take 40 years &gt;&gt; to go 40 miles? It was God's choice &gt;&gt; because he understood that the children of Israel, his own Hebrews, they were operating under a parabolic anointing. They were operating under a a parabolic mantle. We know that because of what the New Testament tells us. Everything that happened to them happened to them for our &gt;&gt; in sample or example had to happen. Somebody had to murmur. Somebody had to complain against the prophet. Somebody had to steal the wedge. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be swallowed by the earth. I'd be careful. &gt;&gt; I mean that. I I would. You see, I'm just under this impression that God can do whatever he wants to do and he's not bound by the center of your Bible. &gt;&gt; That little page or two between the Old Testament and the New Testament, that doesn't limit him. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He can move toward us in a new covenant way. If he wanted to show us something right out of the old book, he could do that, too. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because he's still talking to us through earthquakes. And &gt;&gt; Naam prophesied he's a God of the whirlwind. He still is. &gt;&gt; He still talks to us out of those kinds of things. That seems kind of Old Testament, doesn't it? But God's still doing that. &gt;&gt; Benjamin and I were talking about it, I think on Tuesday of this week there, the earth just opened up and swallowed them and they're just watching them go down into the heart of the earth. God gave them an opportunity. And then the New Testament says, "And everything that happened to them was for a reason, &gt;&gt; and it was an example &gt;&gt; to you and I. I I got a feeling that example is so that we could see where they went wrong and steer away from it. &gt;&gt; I think that them being an example is where we can see where they went right &gt;&gt; and try to do right like they did right &gt;&gt; even more so &gt;&gt; because we have the understanding of the newer covenant. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? this whole thing gazing stock being looked on with curiosity or contempt in Hebrews the word is theatroso and it's the word that we uh uh root of the word that we use in English theater because it is to bring upon the theater to be made a spectacle of to be put on a stage and made a gazing stop by even reproaches and afflictions like the Bible said 1 Corinthians 4:9 for I think that God had set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death. For we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men. I want you to know that if you're chosen to be a parable, if you're chosen to be a gazing stop, if you're chosen to be a spectacle, you're known in every realm. &gt;&gt; You're known in every dimension. Not only does heaven know who you are, somebody on earth is going to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Some man or woman's going to come in uh contact, they're going to cross paths with you because God's got a parable he wants to demonstrate &gt;&gt; to to men, to women, to neighbors, to co-workers, &gt;&gt; to to co-shoppers in Walmart and the mall and wherever else you are. But there's also representation, knowledge of who you are and what kind of a destiny you carry in the lower regions, in the darkest places, &gt;&gt; among the damned, among those who are workers of iniquity, of another seed entirely. They're going to know who you are, too. You're going to be a parable to them, too. There's something that God wants you to show them, too. You can overcome. You can overcome. &gt;&gt; You're going to show angels that you can overcome. You're going to show your savior that you can overcome. And you're going to show the regions of darkness. I'm an overcomer. Not because I'm anything, but because greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in me than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; We compare these verses of scripture. To be made a gazing stop means that God would place me in seasons where my walk will not be hidden. Lord, may they be at this point in my life. May they be short in duration. my life, my decisions, my endurance, these would be openly observed. It was a divine head up. I It was a divine heads up. God was trying to tell me about this end season, this end cycle. He He was saying, "I will not test you in secret now. I will test you in public." I gave the example of somebody saying that uh I'm giving honor to a woman preacher because there's a dedication. Uh you know, I'm just amazed at how people zoom in on videos and things. Wow. It's just amazing that you can do that because I can't imagine unless that camera gets in pretty close that you could read that inscription there. That that is a that is a Torah scroll. It's the first five books of the Bible. And yes, it was dedicated in loving memory of my grandmother, Sister Mildred Shelley, 1923 to 1990, who inspired me to love Hashem, the name and Erits, Israel, the land of Israel. She inspired me to love it by taking me there as an 11-year-old boy in 1979. My life was changed forever. I'm not holding up a woman preacher or trying to ma make some statement there. It was just a It was just a way for me to remember the gift and and the fact that somebody's got enough time to scrutinize that and talk about it and say, "We don't believe the message." And uh we went through this some years ago because we don't have pictures of Brother Brandham here. They don't belong in here. &gt;&gt; And as long as I'm the pastor, they won't be in here. Not that I'm ashamed of him in any way, shape, form, or fashion. I just didn't come to church to look at Brother Brandham. I didn't even come to church to look at a picture of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, even he said about the cloud, that's my Lord there." I didn't come to church to look at a picture of my Lord in a cloud. &gt;&gt; I came to see him, &gt;&gt; the living word doing among us today, what he did in those days and in Bible days. your folk just like you don't see a you don't see a crucifix &gt;&gt; neither do you see an empty tomb &gt;&gt; be &gt;&gt; because we're looking to follow the living word &gt;&gt; and constantly being pointed back to parable &gt;&gt; will keep us from understanding what was really being spoken to us. The goal is not to see how much like brother Brandham we can get. The goal is to be one with Christ. And I personally needed this message. &gt;&gt; Me &gt;&gt; to get me to that place. Yes. &gt;&gt; But I'm not against someone who can fall in love with Jesus and get an understanding of who he is if they can do it outside of hearing what I hear and claiming what I claim. Power to them. &gt;&gt; But I know what it took for me. &gt;&gt; It took recognizing what God did and what he said. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for it. And I want you to understand the balance. We can pay respect without becoming men followers. If we become men followers, we've become men pleasers. &gt;&gt; And the scriptures forbid that that be our our behavior. And the scriptures forbid that that be our identification. &gt;&gt; It can even become a blasphemous name. &gt;&gt; Just a hollow name. It's ridiculous. I watched a little video on YouTube this weekend. Absolutely ridiculous. Now, they're saying that if you have gotten your your uh quote from anywhere but the official app, you can't really trust it. If it didn't come from Jeffersonville, they're referring to the hub. I want you to know the hub was was a a a creation of some brethren in British Columbia who have placed the messages of brother Brandham in in multitudes of languages around the world and preachers can download them. They don't have to go anywhere to get them. They can download them in their homes. They can print them out. When I first started doing missionary work in this message in the 90s, I I spent an evening in a hut with with a one light bulb that had been temporarily run from homes way off somewhere. They had out of out of respect to a visitor. They had run an extension cord and hung a light bulb over my head so that I could have some light. The walls were made of mud and it was as humble as it could be. And I sit there listening to a preacher in the message scold me and school me on what brother Brandham said. And before I leave, I look over at the table and I realize that this poor brother has about that many books and less than that of recorded messages. And he believes in his mind, I've got it all. I understand it all and I can school someone. I left there with such a burden. Not to condemn, but to give, to do anything that I could do to make it possible for him to have access to it all. And if he's read it all and heard it all and still wants to train me, I'm willing to hear what he has to say. But you can't take a handful of sermons and tell me you've embraced it all. Now, it only takes one to have a to to to really have a revelation, a beginning revelation. Brother Brown talks about that those hot natives over there would just hear one message and they would believe it. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about then to teach someone else. &gt;&gt; You got to know a little more. Now, you don't. They just can download it. They can have it all. They can read it all. They can compare it all. They can take it all back to the word. But but here this this campaign is going on to say, "Well, that's not out of Jeffersonville." This is how the man said it, the official app out of Jeffersonville, Indiana. And if that's not the app you have, you can't trust the quotations that come from these other apps. And I'm thinking to myself, if that doesn't sound like a denominational headquarters, &gt;&gt; don't don't stress. Don't strain to say amen if you don't agree. you sit there quietly. It's the most ridiculous thing. So, we're we got people running deleting. They just plainly say there's only one official app. And so, now we've got to all delete our our other apps even though they've got a whole lot more to offer those ministers over there who don't speak English. We got to delete them all because it doesn't line up with Prophet Jr. Well, I want to tell you something. We've come way too far to find oursel entangled in that kind of politics. &gt;&gt; Just get it. Get what you can. Read what you can. Hear what you can. And most importantly, be &gt;&gt; be what you hear. &gt;&gt; Be what you read. &gt;&gt; Pray. We need to pray until we can manifest &gt;&gt; in our own lives &gt;&gt; what we have heard. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's that's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I've got to hurry. This was a divine heads up. I'll test you in secret. I've done that. And now in public. This is the essence of the vessel of public gaze. A time when God allows the refining fire to burn in full view of everybody else. The crash and burn. Everybody sees it. Now, if you'll think back over the last few years of your life, perhaps the last few years of our church life, you might catch a glimpse of what that looks like. When we begin to hear that there's a little something more, we get so excited. We get so full of vim and vigor and zeal and burden and the spirit of the Lord is on us and we're ready. We're ready to prophesy and we're ready to call out sin and we're ready to do all kinds of amazing and glorious and wonderful things. The problem is sometimes we haven't matured enough in the new in the new that God is making real to us and we kind of get a little we kind of get a little bit like babies. Brother Brandham talks about those Pentecostal babies. They've never experienced anything or it's been a long time since they've experienced anything like that and they just get a little out of hand and and now they think that they can they can uh you know walk and talk and and tell everybody else what's wrong with them. I I don't think that that kind of a person ought to be thrown out. I think that person is sort of saying their life is saying I I just want to be usable. &gt;&gt; And you know, brother Vanam said that the the the the test on someone's gift. You want to test somebody's gift, see how well they take correction. &gt;&gt; That's a quote. If you can correct them by the word and they're willing to adjust, he said that that's genuinely most likely to be something that God has placed in them. But if you say a little something and they get so mad and they stomp around and they want to quit, &gt;&gt; then you understand that that gift, whatever it was they were operating in, that's not likely to be the Lord. Because the one thing we know is the spirit of the prophet is subject under the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; In in other words, anything that happens out there needs the sanction of the authority &gt;&gt; that's up here. &gt;&gt; That's what it means. It means that you don't rule. You don't you don't lead. Let's say you don't lead a body from the pew. &gt;&gt; The body is led from here. Whoever is in whoever is the one that God placed, &gt;&gt; it's that's not because it's me. It's whoever. And and so if there's a gift that operates out there, there's an order that it has to come in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and uh so it's all right. If someone asks you to hold your peace, do it. And then you're showing who I just want to be a help. I don't want to be a distraction. &gt;&gt; So we ought not to hold those kinds of things against people. Like the Lord showed me years ago. uh you know Hannah took her son to to uh the prophet Eli and and gives him there and and and says I just want him dedicated to the service of the Lord. And then the Bible said she you know she prayed so hard to get him and when she finally got him the Bible said she goes up every year to see him and to do what? To take him a new little coat. One time God spoke to me from that. He said, "Why do you think she had to go up every year and take him a new coat? He was living in the tabernacle. He wasn't out in the playing in the rocks and getting his coat ripped up." How many of you know why she had to take him a new coat every year? Cuz he was growing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I preached a message called growing pains. &gt;&gt; And we need to let God's people &gt;&gt; grow. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if if growing causes growing pains, we need to be tolerant of that. &gt;&gt; Wow, you're quiet. &gt;&gt; Not so critical. &gt;&gt; Like we're going to throw people out. &gt;&gt; We don't compromise, but we understand. I've said this before and I don't want to embarrass anybody. So, I'm not going to call names, but there were two little beautiful girls who came here from the from the dry, dusty deserts of this country. Saros and maybe Hila monsters thrive in the desert. These sweet little girls come here many, many years ago and they got in this atmosphere of liberty and freedom. And when the spirit of the Lord would move, they would screech. Such a glorious screech of response. It would pierce. It would make the fillings in your teeth vibrate. It felt like But who could be ugly? Who who who could be mean over something like that when you know that it's just first reaction, first response to feeling something a little more. My God, I wish somebody would screech like that this morning. I wish somebody would get in an atmosphere that you're unfamiliar with a little more than you've ever known before and you just react that way like a banshee scream. It's not because that's how you're going to do every time the spirit ever moves, &gt;&gt; but you're allowed some growing pains. &gt;&gt; You're allowed some spiritual growth and some spiritual maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to fall in the floor every time the spirit of God comes. Sometimes you're going to humble yourself in the floor. Sometimes you're going to be prayed for and you're going to find it difficult to stand up and you may fall out. Sometimes you just feel like you want to fall because you want to get as low as you possibly can. That doesn't mean every time God touches you, you're going to do that. Right. &gt;&gt; At one time the some of the thunder people were teaching that that if you if you were coming under the inspiration of the seven thunders, you'd fall forward. And so the people felt like anytime they wanted to fall, they had to pitch theirelves forward so they could be under the inspiration of the thunders. That's a denominational concept that we have to do it the same way every time we do it. So that Come on. I don't care if you fall or you don't fall. It doesn't matter if you shake or you don't shake. Cry or you don't cry. Talk in tongues or don't talk in tong. But whatever you do, get under the spirit. Get under the anointing. Get in the channel where God's spirit is moving. And don't you let your gift or calling or mantle filter down to somebody else because you wouldn't make yourself available [Applause] &gt;&gt; in such an hour as this. &gt;&gt; How tragic that would be. I got to hurry. God said, "I'm going to make you a sign before men and angels so heaven's going to know." And so this message to me was suggesting that part of my calling was to become a living sign. And don't think that I'm trying to say I'm somebody. Believe me, you're the living sign as well. What God does with with the with the papa in the pull pit. &gt;&gt; It's what God wants to do in the people. &gt;&gt; You won't perhaps you might not have the same calling or the same uh gift or anointing or or whatever office in the five-fold ministry. That's not what I'm talking about. But the but we know that God when he when he raises somebody up to lead a body of people, you can expect &gt;&gt; that some of the things that he dreams and some of the things that he sees and some of the things he hears is simply as a parable &gt;&gt; because God wants you to understand that you're the parable, too. &gt;&gt; You see 2 Corinthians chapter 3:2, this is what it means. 2 Corinthians 3:2, "Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men." &gt;&gt; Welcome to the gazing stop mantle. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the parabolic mantle. called commission. You're you're a living letter. An epistle was a letter from the apostle to the churches. It's like a newsletter directly addressing that body of believers. And yet we can say today like the messages of brother Brandham, those letters that that the apostles Peter and Paul and wrote to the churches there, Corinthians to the church in Corinth, Romans, to the converts at the church of Rome, Ephesians, those out of Ephesus, and it goes all the way through Thessalonians to the church at Thessal Thessalonica. And we can say that you are that newsletter. You're the one who's reporting on this hour and what God is desiring to do in this hour. And because you don't look just like them and talk just like them and act just like them and vote just like them, &gt;&gt; you become the parable. and they're scratching their head trying to figure out what it is you're saying. So, make sure that you're living what you're talking. &gt;&gt; Nobody cares in this house high you jump or how wild you dance &gt;&gt; as long as it's not vulgar or provocative. Make sure your skirt is long enough. Some of you could use a little help there. But you worship freely as long as when you go out of here, you're going to live &gt;&gt; as dedicated to the truth &gt;&gt; as you've demonstrated before our eyes. &gt;&gt; I don't say that to be critical. I say it to be as sincere as I know. I just don't mind loud praise. I don't mind uh a little bit of wild worship. I don't mind a little bit of emotion. If it doesn't have any, it's dead. But I want it to be because there's also sincerity of faith &gt;&gt; and and character and quality of life. We got to live like he tells us to live. Are are you here? &gt;&gt; One one uh one Sunday there came some folks here from another place. We were having a gathering down under the tabernacle some years ago. And these women were clearly not from our tribe, but they came here with a commission and a purpose. And one of those women began to prophesy after the service. And then even down under the tabernacle, she prophesied. She had no way of knowing what God had spoken many years before about my own personal life that I would wear a parabolic mantle and be uh commissioned with a parabolic anointing. She had no way of knowing that. And yet, as she began to prophesy over this place down there, uh she prophesied that this was a a congregation that would walk in purity of heart and that they would function in the in in a parabolic anointing, which is as a sign. They would function as a sign and they would do so because I had been given a parabolic mantle, which is exactly what the Lord said many, many years ago. Now what that means is is every church operating as a parable? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they are. Maybe every church around this message, maybe every church of every flavor on on in this county is operating as a parable. I don't know. I'm not commissioned to tell them where they are. I'm commissioned to remind us where we are. &gt;&gt; That means we're not always going to understand everything that happens. &gt;&gt; It's a parable. That doesn't mean it'll always be that way. The understanding will come. But if you can receive a message that declares the secrets that were hidden from the foundation of the world and still come to a place after studying it all these years that you say, "I don't understand it all." You're going to have to admit eventually that that's because some of it came like like the teachings of Christ. It came in a parabolic form. And if that be the case, then if it's for us, we ought to be able to try to pray and want to know. I desire to know. I'd like to know. &gt;&gt; I hear I hear our preachers telling us that the revelation of the seven thunders is here. Well, I want to know where it is and what it is. Some have said it's the virtues. That's incorrect. Doesn't fit the scripture. It doesn't fit all the quotes. Some have said it's seven men who have seven thundering messages to awaken the bride. I don't think that's probably correct either. But the very fact that we're having to say we're not sure is pudding proof that some of it came to us in parables. &gt;&gt; And I can show you the quotations if you need them. If you're a purist and you need them, I can certainly show them to you where he says more than one time it went by me in an unknown tongue. I could not make it out. And then there was another part where he said, "And that concerning the third pull tent vision, there was a portion there where he said, I will take that to my grave." Now, that would have been brutally unfair of him to do that had he not had an understanding that somehow someway that little bride reading between the lines, praying and asking God for understanding would come to the understanding of what it takes. How cruel and how unfair that would have been to tell people, I've got something you need to know to make the rapture, but I'm taking it to my grave. &gt;&gt; Let's let's be real here today. &gt;&gt; That's that'd be terribly unfair. Had he not known that there would be a people at the end who wouldn't go along with the crowd who says, "Oh, we know. We know. We know. We know." Well, what is it? Well, we know. We know. We got it. We know what it is. Well, what is it? We know it was in the seals. Well, that's real funny because he said it wasn't more than once. It's a parable. Why do you even talk about it? Because we have to know at some point. And it's like this. You're not going to know if you're not reaching to know. You're not going to know if you're not praying to know. You're not going to pull if you don't know you're supposed to be pulling. And why is it even important? Because he said it's going to take the revelation of those seven unknown thunders to wake up the bride. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. If there's if that's the truth, and I happen to believe it is, then we're going to have to do more than run around saying, "I know what they are. I know what they are." Oh, what are they? I don't I wouldn't want to say. You wouldn't want to say because you don't really know. uh that caused that kind of a preacher into I'm not trying to be I know it sounds I I came here to be bold but I didn't come to be mean but that that caused the integrity of that kind of a man really it caused it into great question to run around telling me you know and then can't tell us can't show us where it is some places he said it wasn't written at all other places. You said, "Well, it would have to be written somewhere in the word. We just might not identify it a as such until he shows us where it is." You know what that means? That means it might not be in the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; It may be written somewhere else in the word &gt;&gt; and we would have to see that by the spirit if if that's necessary. Maybe it's not, but I think it might be. And if it is, so what do we do in the meantime? Well, we don't get lazy &gt;&gt; and we don't give up &gt;&gt; and we don't see how many uh times we can miss our appointment &gt;&gt; we keep putting oursel in the position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want it. Come on. &gt;&gt; You saw me leave this morning. I left because I came under such an emotion that I couldn't stand there because I knew that I would be noticed and I ended up in the washroom weeping, begging the Lord, hold off just please, Lord, just a little bit because I could feel something coming over this atmosphere. I'm not trying to be weird, wild, strange. just I'm just being trying to be real which I may find this morning that I can't be but I'm hoping for that moment. I felt something moving and knew I felt like I knew in my heart where it was moving and then my mind begins to go to those who aren't here who would very much like to be in a service in an atmosphere where we might get another installment of what God said we would would see and hear and feel and experience. I would want to be right smack dab in the middle of that. Didn't God know? Yes, he knows. But I'm so thankful that he doesn't mind sometime when we say, "Lord, please. Show a little mercy. Hold back just a just a bit. Give us just a little while longer. I feel like the Lord uh moved for me simply because of what he dealt with me in the night. those things that were were to be assigned to you, to you, to you, to you, and we're not stepping up to take them. And so I they just started doing just filtering down. God's going to find somebody. Just take this as a as a as a whatever. He's going to find somebody to do what he told you he wanted to do in you. I hope it'll be you. That will be up to you. Somebody said, "Why don't God just make me?" Well, he can. Just ask Yonah the dove. Just ask Jonah. His name means dove. Just ask him. If God didn't know how to get him where he needed to be. &gt;&gt; Somebody said a man couldn't even live in a whale's stomach like that. Well, it's a good thing the Bible didn't call it a whale. Bible called it a great fish. And if you'll go up there to the Georgia Aquarium, they just lost one. I was sad to hear that. You'll find a fish up there big as a whale called a whale shark. There's all kinds of creatures. And listen, this might have been a creature that never existed before and never had an offspring. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the creator here. &gt;&gt; You going to let some scientists tell you that a man couldn't have been in the belly of a whale? If the word said it, &gt;&gt; I believe I believe it. &gt;&gt; You believe you believe it. &gt;&gt; He knows how. God can do anything but fail. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now I got to hurry. Oh, I didn't do I didn't do that for you to say that, but thank you. I know you mean it. So Jesus didn't say anything except he said in a parable. I like that. because he told us this this congregation would be walking in a parabolic anointing and that means your life will become a living parable. Brace yourself if you haven't already because that don't always mean fire and glory. &gt;&gt; It don't always mean rolling in the floor and talking in tongues and seeing visions and visiting with angels. And as one preacher uh uh mentioned lately, he said, "There are those people around us, you know, who who who have breakfast with angels and lunch with angels and supper with ang. And if I know I do, I'm going to tell it. I'm going to tell it. And I might tell it with your name attached to it just so you'll know that somebody desired." Listen, I loved it. I loved it because a little while later, this other little preacher gets up there to take take his part of the service the next day or whatever it was and he said, "You know, I I love the fact that the angels of the Lord are with us and he said, I I hear brother Brandham saying the reason why we don't see them is because we don't talk about them." He said, "But if we talked about them more, so if anybody in here had breakfast with angels, tell us." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't mock somebody because you don't know whether they did or not. &gt;&gt; Why a lie might provoke you &gt;&gt; to pray, Lord, &gt;&gt; let me be aware. &gt;&gt; Just let me be aware. &gt;&gt; Because whether you saw them at the breakfast table or you didn't see them at the breakfast table, the word says &gt;&gt; they were there, &gt;&gt; doesn't it? In camps roundabout. Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Why do Why do people want to be so Boy, Brother Green got stirred one time. He got stirred when they were having such critical things to say about people who saw angels. He got stirred and he just broke off and preached for weeks on angels. He said, "While I'm at it, I'm going to tell you all some supernatural experiences that I've never told anybody, but I'm going to tell them all right now." And he just unravels. thing because he wasn't on the earth much longer. Just go ahead and tell it. He said, "I've had multiple encounters. I read this week the things he wrote while we were in Israel together. I read the things he wrote and he wrote a a note back to his congregation and he said, "I've had two visitors since I've been here in the apartment." Just letting them know. Didn't tell them what they said. Didn't tell them who they were, whether they were angels or what they were. They weren't natural because I was there and he didn't get any visitors, but just he wanted the congregation to know, "Thank you for praying for me. God is meeting with me like he promised he would. I've had two visitors that have showed up since I've been here in the apartment." That was like maybe the second or third day that he had gotten there. Uh for he said, "I've made up my mind to talk about it." Because here is the quote where he said, "If you talk about it, they'll come. If you talk about them, they'll come." It works that way sometime. If all you talk about is SEC football, &gt;&gt; the angels could care less about I know I know I know I know that everybody believes that when they pray that God's going to let their favorite team win. &gt;&gt; Well, that's going to be impossible cuz if you got Christians on one side and Christians on the other and they're praying their team wins, how's God going to evaluate it? &gt;&gt; Does he Does he sometimes speak? Yes, he does. I've seen him. I've watched him do. God can do a lot of things, but angels don't come when we talk about those things. But when we talk about super, let me tell you something. This let me tell you this. Let me go ahead and tell this. &gt;&gt; If you will talk about the supernatural, &gt;&gt; you will become aware &gt;&gt; of the supernatural. &gt;&gt; It's always around us. That supernatural dimension and realm is always there, &gt;&gt; but we're not aware of it because we're busy here, we're busy there, we're doing this, do that. You just talk about it. Then you become aware of it. Then you start watching for it. Then you start thinking about it. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to tell everything yet. Well, oh my, the hair just stood up on my arm. You know, you don't have to tell that every time. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's God helping you to get ready to recognize his presence or to recognize the angels or to recognize the heavenly uh creatures or or the hosts because he's the he's the captain of angel armies and all angels don't operate the same. They don't all look the same. &gt;&gt; I I can tell you that by experience. They don't all show up the same. They don't all do the same work. They don't all look the same. I don't care. I'll be honest with you, if I never see another manifestation of an angel, I'll be all right as long as they're with me. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, the mighty one, the one that showed up for me some just a couple years back on on a beach out there at at top sale, I'm telling you, that's the one I want. Lord, if you'll let him be near me all the time, I won't have to worry about nothing or nobody &gt;&gt; because he showed me that he had come from the one who had power over all and that he had been built and created in such a way to let me know &gt;&gt; that the Lord is mighty. &gt;&gt; He's I'm telling you, he is mighty. The the Bible calls him in he in a in a in a translated Hebrew word, he's terrible. And when we hear terrible, we think that means, you know, that's just awful. But boy, it means terrifying. &gt;&gt; He knows how to move. &gt;&gt; Now, we'll pick this up another time, but here's what I want to show you about because I want to make sure you understand what it means to live under a parabolic mantle or a parabolic anointing or be a part of a parabolic uh body of believers. Uh somebody told us that we were that we were a prophetic class because God had sent this prophetic message to a prophetic class. So either brother Bam said it or leave said it, whoever said it, it's real. It's right and I like it. A prophetic class. And we are. You got to be. You can't understand a prophetic truth if you don't have a prophetic nature about you. And that's why we need to talk about these things. Why do we talk about? Because we need to talk about them. Because we need to become uh uh uh have a good foundation so that when we begin to see these things come to pass, &gt;&gt; we'll know. Hey, that's that's what the Lord said. &gt;&gt; Why? That is what the Lord told us he was going to do. Glory to God. When somebody when one of your loved ones comes stumbling in here one day and flops down in this altar and prays through the Holy Ghost, you'll be able to rise up and say, "Hey, that's what God told us was going to happen &gt;&gt; and now it's happening." &gt;&gt; You have to know God is always moved in in prophetic parables and in prophetic demonstrations, in prophetic intercession, and in prophetic acts all the way through the Bible. and act the prophetic acts and prophetic demonstrations are are pretty much the same kind of a thing. And if you have no grid for that, uh, I want to help you just a moment because this is what the Lord showed me to do. Turn to Isaiah 20. Got to hurry. Wow. Isaiah 20 uh uh verse two, sweetie. Isaiah 22 20 and verse two. At the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amos, saying, "Go and loose the sackcloth from all thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot." And he did so, walking naked. I didn't hear it. Naked and barefoot. And the Lord said, "Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot for 30 minutes." Lord have mercy. I doubt he was invited to preach any of the camp meetings. He probably didn't get one invite to a youth camp for three whole years while he walked around naked. It'd be one thing if he was 18, but at his age, he was beyond the stage of tight. He was now saggy and flappy and flabby. You needed that visual. It'd be like your granddaddy walking around in the yard for three years. Smile. Won't hurt you to enjoy yourself. Now, let's finish reading. Come on, class. I need back to back to the board. The Lord said, "Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia." You may not have noticed this, but Egypt and Ethiopia are not neighbors. And we don't have any full proof that he was ever in Egypt or Ethiopia. What we do know is that God had called him to do something very odd. I pray that you don't get similar calling. I pray I don't get similar calling. This example is the most extreme of the examples. I thought I would lead with it. You don't really want to think about it. Do Absolutely. I want you to think about it. I want you to think about what you'd have done if you'd have been Isaiah. And then I want you to think about the little old things that God has asked you to do. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm just being real. And you just couldn't do it because somebody might misunderstand you. They will. Especially if you're in the vessel of misunderstanding. Or somebody might gaze on you. Especially you. They will. if you're in the vessel of public gaze. And at the end of the day, doesn't matter if you were misunderstood or not. And it doesn't matter at the end of the day if somebody was gazing at you or not. What matters, I want you to hear me, church. What matters is at the end of the day, did you obey the Lord? &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; I expected a little better reaction than that. Isaiah's shameful exposure was not humiliation. It was God demonstrating, a prophetic parable, a prophetic act that had little to do with with Egypt and Ethiopia in the natural, but in the spiritual, God was doing something to Egypt and to Ethiopia. And he did it by a parabolic prophetic act in a in a prophet Isaiah whom I would just go ahead and tell you one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; You just just read them all and then you come back and see if you wouldn't say that he had one of the most profound prophetic ministries. Now, you talk about visions and who's supposed to have a vision and what is a vision? And even some have snickered a little bit and said, "Well, what is a transvision?" Read your Bible and come back to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just read your Bible. &gt;&gt; You got a King James version, don't you? Look up the word trance. See if it's in your Bible. See, if the Bible doesn't describe a a a particular uh kind or a particular installment of a vision, that doesn't come like a trance. It's very biblical. It's highly important at times &gt;&gt; that God would take you out of your present consciousness to be able to show you something that he wants you to see that in other circumstances you would be too distracted by your present environment to be able to see. So God just pulls you a little bit out. He pulls you a little bit out of your present reality. Somebody say, "Well, isn't that an altered state of consciousness?" Yes, it could be called that. And by the way, that's not evil either because that's what a dream is. &gt;&gt; You have to be in a particular place in your sleep cycle to even have a dream. &gt;&gt; Your consciousness had has to be so affected in such a state of rest. It's the deepest rest and you have to be in that place to really be able to have a fullon dream. Did you know there are people that don't dream in color? Did you know there are people who only dream in black and white? Did you know there are people who dream uh uh and have dreams in dreams? Did you know there are people who have had a dream of having a dream of seeing a vision? They dreamed of having a dream and in the dream that they dreamed of having they were seeing a vision. Explain that I just did. Why did God do it that way? You talk to him when you get a chance and you ask him and I'll I'll teach it. You bring me the syllabus and I'll teach what he tells you. We don't understand sometime exactly why. All I know is what the scripture said that in the last days. &gt;&gt; Now for you to say that was only in 1906 Isuza Street Pentecost then you would be denying that we're still in the last days. If Isuza was the last days, where do you think we are now? In the last of the last days. And he said, "In the last days, young men would see visions and old men would dream dreams." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; And and and that doesn't mean they'll all be spiritual dreams. Sometimes it's taco dreams and pizza dreams. You ate something you had no business eating at bedtime. Torments your sleep and gives you these crazy monster dreams. But that doesn't mean that God can't give godly dreams, &gt;&gt; directional dreams. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that he can't let you see something uh uh by vision that is not really in front of your natural eye, but rather in front of your spiritual eye. &gt;&gt; Like a few Sundays ago uh in our last fellowship meeting, the presence of the Lord was so real in that Sunday morning service. And I started down the the hallway there and I zoom zoom zoom. Now I already have to watch myself. I have a a floater and there's something else on my eye. I'm still waiting on the specialist to call me back. Have you ever been there? The doctor said he would call me. He hadn't called me. Of course, I did give me the number and tell me I could call if I wanted to. I must not have wanted to because I still haven't gone back. But if you've ever had a floater like that or something in your view, sometime you move your head, it moves. You move your eye, it moves. So sometime you're swatting at nats that ain't there. But this was different. I've experienced this before. It's just glimpses. It's just flashes of things. And uh when that comes, it's usually because the Lord is going to show something else to me. And it and and I can go in that stage a long time before I ever see a complete picture. But well, could that be your imagination? Well, I g I guess it certainly could be something that you But wouldn't you if you're imagining the way I understand the imagination is you have to utilize it. You you have to actively engage it. You have to call on your imagination to think of something. And and I I think I'm relatively sound. I I mean, I'm not 100% sure of my sanity, but I think I'm relatively sound. And I don't think that I was imagining something. Uh, in fact, I think if I was going to imagine something that made me stagger, I would imagine it when I was sitting in my leather motorized recliner, not going down the hall, stumbling like a drunk man. We don't know how to explain these things. They don't make one of us any more special than the other. We just need to believe. We just need to believe that it can happen. &gt;&gt; And if it can happen to any one of us, it can happen to another one of us. &gt;&gt; And we ought to be walking close enough to the Lord that if he wants to use us in a way he's never used us before that he could find us available and we be stepping up. I wouldn't want to think it was filtering down to somebody else because I was afraid to do a little something he asked me to do. &gt;&gt; I I hope it's not walking naked for three years as a sign to a nation that they better get their act together. But that was talk about the vessel of public exposure. He was there &gt;&gt; like literally exposed like as my servant Isaiah. He said, "I sometimes God strips us in public view, not to shame us, but to make his message unignorable." If a prophet prophesies to you with no clothes, you're going to close your eyes of hope. But you ain't going to ignore what he had to say cuz you're certainly going to think, "My, what in the world would possess a man to be that bold?" Of course, I you know, I'm sure we could file that under Old Testament behavior and we would think that if we had a New Testament prophets, we had New Testament prophets today after the five-fold ministry, we would find them to be more reasonable, more normal maybe in our mind. Uh well, we know that those who bridge the gap, like John the Baptist, he wasn't exactly normal. He he he lived in the wilderness, slept in caves, he wore camel hair, ate locust and wild honey, hadn't been to the barberh shop, probably smelt like a locust. Come on. And if any of the religious people came to his services, he just called them vipers and scorpions. And no wonder, no wonder they chopped off his head. But he had a message, didn't he? Let me give you one more and we'll go home. Hosea, this is a prophetic act. This is a parabolic anointing. Hosea was told to marry a prostitute from the temple. of a false god. I hope that's Old Testament doings, too, because I'm not performing the ceremony unless I know it's God. You understand? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hosea 1:2, the beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea. And the Lord said to Hosea, "Go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms, for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord." So he went, next verse, and took Gomer, the daughter of Dlame, which conceived and bare him a son. This was a parabolic mantle, a parabolic anointing. This marriage was a prophetic act. It's one of my favorite stories in the Bible that birthed one of my favorite songs of all time. And and it it I don't have the words in front of me, but it it it is Hosea speaking to his children. go plead with your mother because he married her. She bore him three children, wasn't it? Bore him children. And then she leaves him and goes back to the whoredoms of the false temple. And one day he sins for her by his children. She refuses to come. It'll all be forgotten. I'll forgive you and welcome you back into my home. I love you. Can you imagine? He loved her. He knew that she had now gone back to giving herself to the male worshippers who came to that filthy temple. She might have all diseases, but he loved her and he wanted her home. And he knew it was a part of what God was trying to say perhaps to Israel. Go. plead with your mother and they she refused and one day he sees her on the auction block &gt;&gt; and she's being auctioned off to the highest bidder and he is standing in the crowd bidding on his unfaithful wife. Can you find those words? I know we have it, but I'm not sure if you I don't remember exactly how to tell you to find it. The bids were getting high and he continues to bid on his own. And when she sees who it is, she she's baffled. Go plead with your mother were the words of Hosea as he sent his children to extend his mercy. So they journeyed down the old path that lead that led to much destruction. All the while their loving hearts were hurting. That is their mother. Their mother. Don't you know? Their hearts were breaking for the condition of their mother. Their hope was crushed inside as their compassion was denied. The woman they so loved seemed like a stranger. Heartbroken and alone, they took the long road home. For sin now reigned, and all hope seemed gone to change her. One day, the word was told. Some slaves were being sold. A restless love sent Hosea seeking. One by one, they brought them in, so beaten down with sin. Within his chest, his anxious heart was beating. All at once, she caught his eye. From his lips, the bids were high. She could not believe the voice that she could hear. Would he through judgment take her life forever end his pain and strife? What would happen as she saw him drawing near her? And this was what he said. I've come to take you home. I know that you've done wrong, but for you, I'd give my life through through sorrow. And I give my life through the sorrow, pain, and strife. I couldn't let you go. Let's leave the past behind. Beautiful line. Love conquers one more time. He took her hand and said, "There's a new day just ahead. I couldn't let you go." Now you think about it. A prophet who desired to be heard. If you've been called with a message, you want to be heard. I wonder what the church thought about him when they found out that all of a sudden he's taken a wife among the And I wonder how they delighted, how they laughed, how they talked, how they chatted, how they judged when they found out she'd left him and gone back to her whoredoms. And I wonder what they had to say when they found out that he had gone down there and bought her back because he loved her anyhow. Why would God why would God ask a prophet who he wanted to be heard to go and do something like that because he was sending a message to Israel. This is what you've done. &gt;&gt; This is what you've done. This is what you've done. But I've come to take you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The new the Old Testament says there came a time he divorced her and yet he came back and said, "I can't break my vow. You're mine. &gt;&gt; And I still want you. &gt;&gt; Even though you've been put away, I still want you because I love you." Now, what a message that's greater than anything I've set up here today. And how did it come? In a parabolic anointing. &gt;&gt; In a parabolic act, in a prophetic act. And I'm closing. Musicians are coming. I'm not done, but I'm closing. Of course, we have to. We could only take in so much. But I need to at least give you a a New Testament example because they're mel they're mel several in Acts 18 and6 while they're getting ready to play. This was Paul. And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his raignment and said unto them, "Your blood be upon your own heads. I am clean. From henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles." A Pharisee of Pharisees. Couldn't he have just delivered the message without shaking the garment? But the shaking of the garment was the full release of what God wanted them to know. You've stubborn. You've hardened your heart. You've stiffened your neck. You've spent all your time condemning the Gentiles. And you won't hear the word of the I'm going to the Gentiles. And he shook his garment against him. I can show you and I will Tuesday night, the Lord willing. What about Agabus who took the girdle of Paul and wrapped it around his arm and and bound up himself and said, "This is what's going to happen to you if you don't hear the word." This is the first church age messenger that Agabus, a five-fold prophet, is bringing correction to. And yet, he goes right on down and and we know what happened. And it it had to happen that way, no doubt. But somebody had to be willing to be obedient. And it came in a prophetic act. If God said, "I'm going to shake Alaska." If God said, "That old dragon out there is going to shake his tail and I'm going to shake Alaska." It shouldn't take somebody having to throw a rock in the air. But it did &gt;&gt; because that's how God deals in the prophetic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to set that thing in motion. And when he threw that rock up in the air, it was a parabolic anointing. It was a prophetic act that said now it can begin. Now, now is time for that word of promise to be activated. &gt;&gt; You understand that &gt;&gt; it takes some foolish things. Sometime God chooses the foolish things to confound the wives. This is part of what it means to be in the gazing pot, the pot of the vessel of public gaze. If you're not tough enough to handle it, you've still got time to bail. But if I could catch a glimpse and you could catch a glimpse of what God has promised for those who are willing to obey him no matter what the cost. There's probably many of us in here who have felt like at times God was requiring too much of us. But he will never ask from us anything that he doesn't provide grace to be able to do it. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that God is calling most of us to prophesy barefoot and naked for three years. I don't believe that God is calling most of us to hang upside down in a whale like Jeremiah. I don't necessarily believe that God is. But what if he did? If you can't obey the voice of the spirit when he says, "I want you to go up there and worship." I'm not saying that he's told any of you that and you didn't. But what if he had? I do know that there are people among us that I love dearly who treat worship kind of like it's a a sport of observation and I I feel sorry for you that you find yourself in that place because uh the really worship is a is a all hands on deck kind of blessing is everybody get in while you can and worship God. Don't worry about what anybody else is doing or saying. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to come up here to do it. But I'm just saying what if the spirit of the Lord's been telling you and you didn't do it. You you really think God's going to trust you with a message to a nation if he can't even prod your heart and get you to feel like you want and and here's the word of the Lord to you. If you don't begin to cry out to receive and to embrace the promises of God that have already been made to you. I used to would have told you that he'll just hold them in reserve until he can bring you into a place where you receive them. But he showed me clear last night and I saw mantels. I saw scrolls. I saw commissions. I I saw uh acts of obedience. I I couldn't even begin to describe it. But I saw it as it as it slipped over the shoulders around people that I'm standing before today. And it just comes filtering down as though it was going to fall. And it did eventually begin to Someone else reached up and said, "I'll take that. My God, I want my part. I don't want your part. I'm greedy, but not for you, your part. I I'm greedy for my part. I want what God has promised me, but but but if I were you, I'd ask the Lord, Lord, make me that that hungry for for it. Lord, if there's any promise that applies to me uh in this end time thing, I want it. If you've made some precious, I want it. I I'm going to position myself to receive it. I don't want it to fall on somebody. I know it would be a blessing to them, but if it's mine like the little dream they I think even brother Brandham told told about it, it went all around in the days of the healing revival. how he stands in the presence of God and sees all those packages, all those things that could have been his name on them. Well, why are they here? Why are they still here? My name is on them. You never ask. You didn't ask for them. So, here they sit. Boy, that makes me want to be greedy, doesn't it? You? It makes me want to say, Lord, if there's anything hanging around with my name on it, help me get ready &gt;&gt; to receive it. Let's stand. There's all kind of nice birthdays this week. Brother George Smith turns 80 on Tuesday. If you if you know how to reach him, harass him. There's a possibility that he'll join us in October. Whether he does or not, I love him. And I can't hardly believe he's turned 80. He's still going everywhere. Maya has a birthday this week. And Naomi streaming in the Netherlands has a birthday this week. And Tally Talia, I call her Taliana after Polyiana, but that's not her name. She has a birthday this week. She turns eight. Is that right? Where is she? She in here. Eight years old. Sister Martha West has a birthday on Thursday. And Sister Flo has a birthday on Friday. And Sister Natalie Hollowell has one on Saturday. And I had written down here that we pray for Brother Austin because he had some awful kidney stone pain this week. I don't have an update, but I have certainly prayed for him. Sister Megan Kino needed our prayers today. and Sister Pam, Aunt Pam Tibo, uh, needed some help. She's suffering in her with a terrible headache. This is becoming common, and we want the Lord to move for her. He's an ontime God, isn't he? &gt;&gt; I'm not sure how long we'll be able to keep pushing things off. So, we certainly want to be led of the Lord in all of our decisions, and we want to be where God would have us in the in the in the right place at the right time to receive whatever he has for us. Is that how you feel? Do you want to know that you're in the perfect leadership of the Lord? Even if it looks goofy to people, even if people don't understand your decision, you you certainly want that. Uh, Benjamin, I know it's kind of dry right now and and I would normally sing to help you get started, but just come. I I think I've delivered my my burden for this moment. Just come and lead us in something to worship the Lord with. He's [Music] the weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper. And when the darkness falls, it won't prevail. &gt;&gt; Because the God I serve knows only how to triumph. And my God will never fail. Oh my God will never fail. Cuz the weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper. And when the darkness falls, it won't prevail. Oh, because the God I serve knows only how to triumph. Oh, and my God will never fail. No, my God will never fail. And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belongs to you, Lord. And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. Yeah.

Oh, it belongs to you, Lord. Oh, and I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. Yeah. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. [Music] There's power in the mighty name of Jesus. You see, every war he wages, he will win. No, I'm not backing down from any giant. Cuz I know how this story is. Oh, I already know how this story ends. And I'm going to sing a victory.

Cuz you take what the enemy meant for evil and then you turn it for good. You turn it for good. Oh, and you take what the enemy meant for evil and then you turn it for good. My God, you turn it for good. Oh, and you take what the enemy meant for evil and then you turn it for by God, you turn it for good.

I'm going to see a victory. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle. Oh, it belongs to you, Lord.

For the battle belongs to you, Lord. I'm going to see &gt;&gt; I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. &gt;&gt; For the battle belongs to you, Lord. And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle. It belongs to you, Lord. Here we are today. Do with us Lord as you desire. &gt;&gt; We surrender our will. &gt;&gt; We say yes to whatever you require. &gt;&gt; We say yes to whatever you would ask of us. &gt;&gt; Many times the enemy would try to tell us that the ship has sailed and we have missed our opportunity. And yet today, Lord, we hear the call, the upward call of the spirit saying, "Now is the time to claim, to take possession of every promise, to wrap your faith around the promise and say, Lord, even now, I'm willing to receive it and to be it and to do it, to be obedient to you above all things." Now Lord, in order to keep us that way, you have to shake us sometime. And we embrace right now the siftings and the shakings of the Lord if they'll pull us into a more surrendered and submitted life to you. Oh God, cover us as you promised in that secret place. Stretch forth the pavilion over our lives. Oh God, we pray. Lord, whatever distracts us right now in this hour, would you give us grace and faith to get our eyes off of the stuff and get our eyes on the promise? And the promise is mature sons are going to come forth even in this near hour. Lord, this is the promise. You're the prize. You're the prize. You're the goal. You're the vision that is before us. We want to be everything you've called us to be. We want to do everything you've called us to do. And we understand that sometime the doing is never found until the yielding. So we yield. &gt;&gt; We just yield, Lord. It's easy to say it, but when you call on us, may we find grace to yield even as we have promised. Your word matters to us, Lord. We we look around this room and we see those who struggle and those who have problems, huge, big burdens to carry, physical needs in their body. You're the same healer that you always were. We ask you to let healing be manifested in your faithfilled people today. Oh God, may there be testimonies of how you have corrected uh many problems and healed many different kinds of infirmities because our faith was able to reach up and take a hold of the promise of who you are. Continue to stir us, Lord. Let it become so contagious. Let it be like Jeremiah who fell under such a prophetic burden of the Lord that he said, "When I thought I would shut up, when I thought I wouldn't tell it anymore, it was like fire shut up in my bones. Oh God, may the burden of the Lord and his house consume us all. And should we try to hold back, may it burn in our bones like a fire until we have fully yielded and obeyed your voice, Jesus. We're not here to play church. We're here to rise up and be what you've called us to be. Now, Lord, let it be that every person can come with us. Let it be that every heart would turn toward you. Lord, I pray that there would be no misunderstanding over what I've shared today. I did not want to. I didn't want to do it. I did it to be obedient to you. Now Lord, it's up to you to touch hearts, to open understanding. May no one go out of here with some kind of misunderstanding, but may they see the heart of the matter. May they hear your voice in it. Lord, it's time. &gt;&gt; It's time. The two and the fro has to come to an end now. It's time, Lord, for us to settle &gt;&gt; and get ready. It's time, Lord, for us to carry your mantle. &gt;&gt; May we hunger for it. May we position ourselves for it. I love what you've already started today. I bless your name. You're worthy to be praised. Would you just lift your hand to him before we leave? I know the time. Would you just lift your hand to him? Lord, you're so good. We could just worship on through the afternoon. It would really be easy to do that. But I understand. May the Lord just strengthen you right now. May he just plug you in. Hallelujah. May he just give you strength and energy. May he just fill you with his life from the oldest to the youngest. The very fact that you woke up this morning is proof that you're not done. &gt;&gt; The very fact that you woke up, you made yourself made your way to the house of God is proof today that part of this word is for you. &gt;&gt; Take it. [Music] Lay your head on his chest. Hear his heartbeat. Discern his will. Find what he wants you to do and do it. There's strength when we stand together in faith. When we pull away from the body, that's when the enemy has room to come in and divide. But when we pull together into his presence, the enemy's choked out, &gt;&gt; his distractions become smaller, and our determination becomes stronger. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see the victory. &gt;&gt; In fact, I want to be the victory. Sing a little of that again, just a little bit. The battle's yours, Lord. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory &gt;&gt; for the battle. &gt;&gt; For the battle belongs to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory &gt;&gt; for the battle. &gt;&gt; For the battle belongs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belongs to you, Lord. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. How many of you believe you're going to see the victory? &gt;&gt; I feel just do what you want to do, Lord. We're just yielded. We're not trying to make anything happen. We're just yielding. We yield. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. For the battle &gt;&gt; belongs to the Lord. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. Hear me in this hour in this sovereign storm. Hear me I say me I say I am preparing your heart. Seek me with all of your hearts. This hour this moment is sovereign. This moment is a display of my will for you. &gt;&gt; Seek me. I am calling you to a higher place than it will be. This year I will drive you to a high place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We spread our wings, Lord. We spread our wings with our eye on the higher. Lord, we look to the higher. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Our desire to find the higher. Lord, we set our wings. We're ready that you would carry us to a higher place. Glory be to God. Glory be to God. Glory to his name. Oh my, he's so good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to give you just a moment to love one another in this atmosphere. Not a lot of chatting, just love. I want to give you just a moment to hug those that you can get to or God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. It's one of the highest things that you could say to one another is God bless you. I don't want to be moving around in time like this. No, I I I'm inviting you to I feel like that's what he wants us to do. Let it go deep. God has a purpose, a plan, and he has a timing. Amen. Amen. I'm waiting on you. Is that right? The Lord has a purpose, and he has a timing for all things. I just want to give you this as you go. Get ready to go because I'm so thankful that Sister Shosana sent that text and I wouldn't normally see it, but it just happened to flash there on my computer. I didn't see it on the phone. I'm so glad that she asked, "Do you mean the brown bear or the silver?" And I said, "Silver tip grizzly." I want to read this to you so that you'll have it if you ever need it. Uh it is paragraph 11 of one of the sermons of the countdown. It's 62 September the 9th in the morning. The message countdown. And these countdown sermons I've gone through several of them yesterday looking for something and they're wonderful. In paragraph 11, he said, "So going on 32 years of ministry, I've tried to stay true to the word. I don't know of one thing I've ever had to alter on because I read it out of the Bible. Said just what the Bible said and let it go like that." And so I haven't had to take back or rearrange because I just said it the way the Bible says it. And I find out if God has spoken anything, then we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled. We seen that as I told you last night of a vision just recently that I had to be there, a warning to be there and telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them and I just walked on with the other men and the vision passed right through exactly God's part and I was left standing. So, we want to remember, you've got to stay on the word. Just stay right with the word. And where the word leads, you go right with the word and it'll bring you out. All right. I'm sure brother Brandham felt pressure to go along. Even though the the spirit was calling him in another direction, he was considering the feelings of the other brothers and what they were thinking and what they might need. And it moved him out of the place that he was supposed to be. And he said, "God's part went right through me. I was left standing there." Does that grieve your heart like it does mine? I'm also thankful it happened because it's been a lesson to me, but I'm I'm I'm grieved. I I would like for him to have had what he expected. Uh even if it was a bear, God gave one to David and he he gave them to brother Brandham many times. There are those who say, "Well, then he had to he'd have to come back and shoot that bear." No, because God's part's already done. It went right through him. I don't want to be in that position that I let unsanctified mercy or human compassion or uh worries about what somebody thinks or how they feel about about where we are. I wouldn't want to let anything like that hinder an appointment with the Lord. Do you understand that? I I'd want to be I I hear him talking sometime about uh situations in the beginning where a vision would come and and it would almost be right. But but no, no, you were supposed to be sitting there and you were to be there in that chair. Now, if you'll swap chairs, can you imagine? I can. I can imagine. That don't stretch me at all. It helps me. So, so you get where you're supposed to be and you get where you're supposed to be and then we can move on in the fulfillment of the vision. Does that make any sense to anybody? Boy, it's bigger than I can tell you. Lord, go with us today. I I just feel like you're pleased. I know there are those among us who would now like for it to go here or go there or to be this or to be that, but that's not your plan for for right now. uh you want us to chew and digest and meditate and contemplate and ruminate on what you've said so that we can be quick to obey. Again, I ask Lord that no one would leave with a misunderstanding but that we could go with peace here today. And I just pray Lord that in this hour of enlistment that your troops would volunteer willingly as the scripture speaks. We volunteer willingly to be what you have us to be. Bless our children. Bless these mamas who are expecting. Bless those who are traveling home today. [Music] We give you glory and honor. It's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you leave here today. I want to say this as you're slipping out. We have a little bit of a need uh uh in the church. God has been very good and faithful to us. I try not to ever be one who mentions it because we are certainly moving forward on other projects. But we have some equipment that needs to be updated and uh it's it's costly. And as far as the budget, well, we've got the bills paid for the month, but we're probably going to need what we have in surplus to start paying first of the month bills pretty soon. So if the Lord would speak to your heart and you want to mark something, you could market media, you could market equipment, uh you could do anything like that and it would be greatly appreciated. Uh Benjamin has sent his he purchased it, but he sent his uh he's had some problems with his in-ear monitor for leading worship and sent it off and got a new cord. Got the new cord back and the whole thing sort of went out and we've sent it off. We have no idea what the cost to repair it would be and it might even require it to be replaced. And we've got some storage equipment up there that's got that needs to be replaced. And we've just purchased equipment for the fellowship hall for sound so that we can have some uh m nice good worship down there. We're thankful for that. And uh if you just feel to over the next few weeks just put it in. You can market media or you can uh equipment or whatever. I just wanted you to be aware of the need with no pressure. If the spirit says so, help us. If not, pray that the need will be met. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're dismissed to go. Go in peace. Let's be sensitive to what the Lord has Tuesday night 7:00. I'm going to see victory for the battle. God bless you, Elisha. I love you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Mimi's for Papa's birthday. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to celebrate Papa's birthday today? Oh, look at these. What a handsome boy. I love you, Isaiah. Very much. Look at these sweet girls. Oh, God bless you, [Music] Oh, God bless you, Maya. Look here. Tally the birthday girl. Just a few days I'm going to see a victory. God bless you, Joseph. [Music] Hello, Aana. I didn't mention I didn't I don't know why I didn't, but I didn't mention that we've got a brand new little baby in the house this morning for the first time. We're so happy to have Abel. I know. Thank y'all though. The Lord has touched Sister Ashley. We were praying for her and the Lord's touched her. I'm so thankful. Scared us a little bit. Faith had to kick in. Amen. And has touched him as well. Abel Joshua Yantis. What threw me was T-Bo was trying to pop up, but mama's T-Bo, baby's Yantis. Uh let's make sure we continue to pray for them and love them and let them know. Uh how many of you glad to have a new one with us? [Applause] Glory. Glory. [Music] [Music] [Music]
