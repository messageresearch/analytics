[52:39] with sister Flo today Trey is that right
[52:42] and
[52:44] Autumn all right Trey and Autumn sister
[52:47] Flo is it my understanding that you used
[52:50] to babysit this young man
[52:51] [Laughter]
[53:00] thank you so much for the opportunity to
[53:03] get this off of my chair I am so happy
[53:07] this morning
[53:08] Autumn and Trey Mormon
[53:11] our babysit Trey when he was about 10
[53:14] years old
[53:16] and he was really passionate he found
[53:19] out that I was a Christian and he was
[53:21] real passionate about the Lord even at
[53:23] the age of 10.
[53:25] I think the Lord called him to preach
[53:27] and I think he's kind of died trying to
[53:29] dodge that but we'll see what God does
[53:32] for him but when they would get there
[53:35] every morning his grandmother and his
[53:38] grandfather was good Baptist people they
[53:41] I come out of a Baptist Church they good
[53:43] people they have a lot of love
[53:46] and uh
[53:48] his granddad didn't like it because I
[53:51] talked to him he would ask me questions
[53:53] about the Holy Ghost and about the Lord
[53:56] and about baptism and all like that and
[53:59] he was only 10 and he said sister Flo
[54:01] when I get to be a big man Papa
[54:05] can't tell me what to do and when I get
[54:09] big I want to be baptized and I want
[54:12] your preacher to baptize me
[54:14] and I said well all right you know
[54:16] that's that sounds good to me so I never
[54:19] dreamed that when he what 30 30
[54:22] 38 years old he would call me and say
[54:25] you know I think I want your preacher to
[54:28] baptize me and so
[54:35] I'm paraphrasing a lot of this but
[54:38] pawpaw was jealous of what he learned
[54:41] and what he would say about Jesus uh
[54:44] they would read the Bible and he'd say
[54:47] papa do you know what you're reading and
[54:50] he'd say yeah and he's telling me he'd
[54:51] say oh papa that's not what Jesus meant
[54:54] Jesus meant you tell him
[54:56] was absolutely jealous of what and he
[54:59] told his wife Vaughn we just buried her
[55:03] just a few weeks ago she and I were real
[55:05] close friends
[55:07] and he told her he said Vonnie if that
[55:09] woman don't quit telling Trey all these
[55:11] things I'm gonna you're gonna stop them
[55:14] from going over there but they didn't
[55:16] they kept coming and he was so
[55:18] passionate about the Lord and I just the
[55:21] reason I wanted to give this testimony
[55:23] is this
[55:24] don't ever give up on nobody
[55:29] because you never know when you tell
[55:31] somebody today it may be 10 20 years
[55:33] from now when they but God has his hand
[55:37] on people and he has his hand on you and
[55:40] you be sure you're anointed when you
[55:42] started telling these people about the
[55:44] Holy Ghost and the baptism and how to be
[55:46] saved you make sure you anointed to do
[55:49] it don't just get out there and talk
[55:50] because you can you've got to be
[55:53] anointed to do it that's the reason the
[55:54] Holy Ghost is so important life ain't
[55:57] life without the Holy Ghost
[56:00] I'll love the Lord Brother Shelly I love
[56:02] the Lord I'm so excited I said
[56:06] coming home to church this morning and I
[56:07] said Lord I can go on now because you
[56:10] know I'm just happy and I I feel like in
[56:13] my heart I've done a little bit of good
[56:15] I've done one thing good in a way
[56:18] Hallelujah
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:25] Hallelujah
[56:33] well if he was 10 and he's 38 now that's
[56:37] 28 years ago

[57:52] wall

[57:59] return void but it will accomplish where
[58:02] to it is sent amen now I'm here today

[1:12:24] you're ever going to live in
[1:12:27] if you think this is noisy my watch
[1:12:29] keeps telling me that you're in a very
[1:12:31] loud environment
[1:12:34] but it's not too worried about me
[1:12:36] because it it'll it knows that I'm I'm
[1:12:38] always about Sundays I'm in a loud
[1:12:40] environment and Tuesdays too you may be
[1:12:43] seated for a moment it's wonderful to be
[1:12:46] in the presence of the Lord
[1:12:49] wasn't he wonderful during worship
[1:12:52] he came and he is wonderful and worthy
[1:12:55] we don't want the enemy to receive any
[1:12:59] any attention in this service he's not
[1:13:03] worthy of it is he
[1:13:05] but if your week has been anything like
[1:13:07] mine I came determined this morning to
[1:13:11] give him my praise
[1:13:13] I came determined to lift up the name of
[1:13:16] the Lord
[1:13:17] because that's the only way as as
[1:13:19] Benjamin saying it's the only way
[1:13:22] uh we were streaming last night there
[1:13:25] was a choir uh if you'd like to find it
[1:13:29] on YouTube you can it's called the m b
[1:13:33] choir message Believers choir they are
[1:13:38] made up of mostly African and
[1:13:42] African-American believers
[1:13:45] um they uh sort of formed during covid
[1:13:49] and it was quite unusual to watch it
[1:13:53] during covet because they would be
[1:13:55] singing from different places and
[1:13:58] whoever was controlling the the zoom or
[1:14:02] or or whatever the the format was they
[1:14:05] would switch in and out and uh it was
[1:14:09] very well done and it was a blessing to
[1:14:12] people during covid uh since they can
[1:14:16] get together now uh brother gisson
[1:14:19] danner's Church in in wherever it is
[1:14:22] Covington
[1:14:24] in Covington Georgia hosted them in a
[1:14:27] larger building and uh brother Isaiah
[1:14:30] Brooks was there to sing and uh oh it
[1:14:35] was just a nice evening some of it was
[1:14:37] really good
[1:14:39] and brother Brooks was really good
[1:14:43] and Wesley Van Wyck was really good and
[1:14:47] the choir did very well but it was so
[1:14:50] nice and uh so Lively
[1:14:54] Wesley wrote a song uh I'd like for him
[1:14:58] to come here one day and sing it during
[1:15:00] a hard trial in his life he said and his
[1:15:04] mother is going through sister Sharon is
[1:15:07] going through a battle with cancer now
[1:15:09] and the song is called turn up my praise
[1:15:12] and you know what that's exactly what we
[1:15:15] have to do when Trials come when
[1:15:18] troubles come when when when hardships
[1:15:21] come we don't pull away from the one who
[1:15:24] can help us we draw up just as close to
[1:15:27] him as we can possibly get and we turn
[1:15:31] up the praise
[1:15:32] so if you think this was wild this
[1:15:35] morning you haven't seen anything we're
[1:15:37] just getting ready we're just practicing
[1:15:39] for what it will end up being I want to
[1:15:42] give him everything I have
[1:15:44] the Bible tells us to give him exuberant
[1:15:47] praise
[1:15:48] hi praise this book of So High Praise
[1:15:53] and and so we don't need to just wait
[1:15:55] till we get to church to do that we need
[1:15:57] to do it every opportunity is that right
[1:16:00] let me just briefly mention uh that
[1:16:04] there are some birthdays this week that
[1:16:06] we want to to mention and I have to
[1:16:09] because it's two of them are in my
[1:16:11] family uh sister Stacy's baby

[1:16:32] God I don't know how it is that my wife
[1:16:34] is getting older and I'm not I I don't
[1:16:37] know how that's happening but how did we
[1:16:39] end up with a 17 year old baby
[1:16:43] it just happens
[1:16:45] and uh it's not a happy memory but it's
[1:16:49] a Memory that will will always be
[1:16:50] attached to this day in 2015 brother
[1:16:54] Perry green went home to be with the
[1:16:56] Lord and when I was thinking about that
[1:16:58] this morning when I woke up uh I was
[1:17:01] thinking what a wonderful wonderful
[1:17:04] eternity it is for them now Sister Green
[1:17:07] is with him now on the other side and
[1:17:09] they are in the presence of the Lord and
[1:17:12] they wouldn't come back brother green
[1:17:13] wanted to be remembered he he he had it

[1:21:23] so many other places Tema Ghana West
[1:21:27] Africa we had Pastor Tay here with us
[1:21:30] last Sunday and we sure enjoyed that
[1:21:33] didn't we
[1:21:34] and uh let's see uh Zimbabwe
[1:21:38] sister Annie over in Columbus is
[1:21:41] streaming more from Ghana more from
[1:21:43] other places in Africa we love all of
[1:21:46] you and we appreciate you being with us
[1:21:48] let's turn to Hebrews chapter four are
[1:21:50] you in a rush
[1:21:52] that was kind of weak
[1:21:55] are you in a rush
[1:21:58] all right there are bathroom facilities
[1:22:00] if you need them
[1:22:01] you can go out and come back in quickly
[1:22:04] you don't you're not expected there to
[1:22:06] hold hold your your that sounds terrible
[1:22:10] how do I finish that sentence
[1:22:12] we don't want you miserable
[1:22:16] especially those of you over 50 you'll
[1:22:19] understand
[1:22:20] you have to slip out sometime do that we
[1:22:23] don't want to rush what the spirit of
[1:22:24] God would do for us today
[1:22:27] Hebrews 4 and verse 11 let us labor
[1:22:31] therefore
[1:22:32] to enter into that rest
[1:22:38] that rest
[1:22:40] lest any man fall
[1:22:44] after the same example of unbelief are
[1:22:49] you with me
[1:22:50] for the word of God is
[1:22:53] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:22:59] two-edged sword
[1:23:01] it's so sharp that it pierces even to
[1:23:06] the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:23:11] the New Testament tells us that man is
[1:23:15] is Body Soul and Spirit flesh Soul and
[1:23:21] Spirit and that line between spirit and
[1:23:25] soul is so thin that as far as we know
[1:23:29] there's only one thing that can get to
[1:23:32] that line and discern and that is the
[1:23:35] word of God it's so sharp and so quick
[1:23:39] so anointed and so powerful that it can
[1:23:43] divide between the will of the soul and
[1:23:47] the mind of the spirit and that's a
[1:23:50] battle that goes on within us because we
[1:23:52] have so many things operating in the
[1:23:55] emotional Realm of the Soul which is
[1:23:57] mind will and emotions and you as a
[1:24:01] Believer are not created to be led by
[1:24:04] mind will and emotions you are to be led
[1:24:08] by a regenerated spirit that is now the
[1:24:11] resurrected Spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:24:14] Living excuse me
[1:24:17] living inside of you as a believer
[1:24:21] but there are times that we need to know
[1:24:23] is this God leading me or is this my
[1:24:27] mind leading me
[1:24:28] is this God leading me in my spirit or
[1:24:32] am I being emotionally LED and there is
[1:24:36] one answer and that's not called the
[1:24:37] preacher
[1:24:39] the answer is go to the word
[1:24:42] go to the word of God that word of God
[1:24:46] is quick and Powerful sharper than any
[1:24:48] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:24:52] dividing asunder of mine will and
[1:24:55] emotions and spirit and of the joints
[1:25:00] and Marrow
[1:25:02] this was the apostles way of letting you
[1:25:05] know it can go right into the inside of
[1:25:08] the bone and is a discerner thank God it
[1:25:13] it is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:25:17] even the secret intents intentions of
[1:25:21] the heart how many of you remember when
[1:25:24] we spoke about this last we mentioned
[1:25:26] Matthew 7 judge not that you be not
[1:25:29] judged and when we look at that we
[1:25:32] recognize it doesn't mean that we can't
[1:25:34] look at the fruit and see if it be of
[1:25:37] God or not but it means we are not
[1:25:40] allowed to judge the intentions
[1:25:43] of someone else's heart now before
[1:25:46] you're seated let me remind you that
[1:25:48] sometimes we we think we know somebody
[1:25:50] really well husbands and wives
[1:25:52] especially and sometimes the the the the
[1:25:56] husband will say well honey I didn't
[1:25:58] mean that and the wife will say
[1:26:01] I know what you meant
[1:26:05] now that's the Judgment that's actually
[1:26:07] sinful
[1:26:10] let me say that again while you're all
[1:26:12] standing this will help your marriage
[1:26:15] that judgment is actually the very
[1:26:18] judgment that Jesus is speaking against
[1:26:21] you are never qualified to judge the
[1:26:25] intentions of someone else's heart
[1:26:28] there's only one that can do that and
[1:26:30] that's the Living Word of God that word
[1:26:33] of God can get down into your business
[1:26:37] that word of God can get down into the
[1:26:40] intentions of your heart and judge your
[1:26:43] motive and reveal your heart to you
[1:26:46] the Bible said we we sometimes need to
[1:26:49] show the house to the house that's what
[1:26:51] preaching is for he chose the
[1:26:54] foolishness of preaching to turn the
[1:26:56] mirror up sometime and let the house see
[1:26:58] the house thank God for the word I just
[1:27:02] want to say before all of you that I am
[1:27:05] most thankful for the word of God not
[1:27:08] just the printed page but the Living
[1:27:11] Word the quickening power that comes
[1:27:15] from the word of God is if you believe
[1:27:17] that same man I want us to pray together
[1:27:20] father we are here in your name in the
[1:27:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:27] Yeshua hamashiach we have come to honor
[1:27:31] you to worship you to lift up your Holy
[1:27:36] Name Your hallowed name in this house
[1:27:39] there is no God like our God and we
[1:27:43] acknowledge that among all the gods
[1:27:46] that men worship today there is only one
[1:27:50] true Living God Yahweh and we bless him
[1:27:54] and we thank him for his gift to us now
[1:27:58] we have come to look at the printed
[1:28:01] record of your word but we know that
[1:28:05] that book in itself can be used to kill
[1:28:08] we have not come to be murdered we have
[1:28:12] not come to be killed we have come to be
[1:28:15] made alive
[1:28:16] and so we ask that the Living Word would
[1:28:20] show up among us today and by the power
[1:28:23] of the Holy Spirit the anointing of the
[1:28:27] Holy Ghost you would cause this word to
[1:28:31] function and to accomplish all that
[1:28:34] needs to be accomplished in our lives
[1:28:37] today we are a tired people we're tired
[1:28:41] we're we're just confessing to you that
[1:28:45] life has made us tired and we are
[1:28:49] longing for rest
[1:28:52] we are longing for an eternity of rest
[1:28:56] with you
[1:28:57] but we are thankful that you have
[1:29:00] promised a a rest on the way to rest
[1:29:04] you have promised us a rest a refreshing
[1:29:09] that comes by the spirit it's not just
[1:29:12] provided for us by a day of the week
[1:29:15] it's much more than that but the Lord
[1:29:19] sabbah the lord of the Sabbath is among
[1:29:24] us today the one who was there in the
[1:29:29] beginning and we thank you for that and
[1:29:32] we need that Living Word to come and
[1:29:34] Quicken us back to life
[1:29:36] we need rest that that the sleeping pill
[1:29:39] couldn't give us rest that the pillow
[1:29:43] and the comfy covers couldn't give us we
[1:29:46] need a rest in our soul
[1:29:49] and that rest is in our spirit man Even
[1:29:53] Now by The Living Word of God so let
[1:29:56] that Spirit rest let it move forward and
[1:30:02] permeate the mind and the will and the
[1:30:05] emotions of every child of God and when
[1:30:07] we leave here maybe our body is still
[1:30:10] tired but let there be a leaping within
[1:30:14] us and the quickening of life within us
[1:30:18] that we can say it was good to talk with
[1:30:22] him in this manner it was good to walk
[1:30:25] along the road with him today did not
[1:30:27] our hearts burn within us as we walked
[1:30:30] with him on the road we will give you
[1:30:33] glory and honor now we take authority
[1:30:35] over every power over every principality
[1:30:39] over every dominion over every
[1:30:41] distracting spirit
[1:30:43] and in the name of the Lord Jesus in the
[1:30:46] name of Yeshua our Messiah we take his
[1:30:49] authority over that spirit
[1:30:52] we command you to bow to the sovereignty
[1:30:55] of the one true Living God and we ask
[1:30:58] Lord that your word could accomplish
[1:31:00] something in us we ask this in your most
[1:31:03] holy name
[1:31:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua
[1:31:08] our Messiah and the Saints said you may
[1:31:12] be seated I didn't mean to take so long
[1:31:14] in the prayer
[1:31:16] but it's vitally important in this hour
[1:31:19] that we are not just hearers
[1:31:22] of the word
[1:31:24] hello but but we must also be doers of
[1:31:28] the word
[1:31:30] and that means to say I believe the word
[1:31:32] and not obey it is is a huge huge
[1:31:36] conflict of interest
[1:31:38] the Bible said if you say you love me
[1:31:40] and you don't keep my Commandments you
[1:31:42] lie and the truth is not even residing
[1:31:44] in you powerful isn't it it's not even
[1:31:47] in you
[1:31:48] it's not even abiding in you the Bible
[1:31:51] also tells us that you shall know
[1:31:55] the truth and that's not a Doctrine
[1:31:58] that's a person
[1:32:00] you see we may all still be growing in
[1:32:04] our Doctrine
[1:32:05] we're still learning of the word no one
[1:32:08] in this building has arrived yet
[1:32:11] hello we're still learning of the word
[1:32:14] he's still revealing himself
[1:32:16] somebody said well we have a message we
[1:32:19] sure do and we can't agree on it
[1:32:22] so we're still learning of the word
[1:32:25] because that word is our absolute
[1:32:28] amen but but what we can do is we can
[1:32:32] surrender our will
[1:32:34] and we can say yes and amen to that word
[1:32:37] and when God corrects our Doctrine or
[1:32:40] shows us something more uh I I thought
[1:32:43] about even praying today before we
[1:32:46] started asking the Lord that he would
[1:32:48] apply I save
[1:32:50] how many of you know how powerful it is
[1:32:52] when the spirit of God just applies a
[1:32:56] salve to your eyes
[1:32:58] brother Branham talked about being
[1:33:01] brought up in a little Log Cabin you can
[1:33:03] go in the blue room there and see a
[1:33:06] painting of the of the little Log Cabin
[1:33:08] that brother Branham grew up in and in
[1:33:11] the wintertime with a wood stove as the
[1:33:15] only source of heat and that wood stove
[1:33:17] would go down in the night and sometimes
[1:33:19] go out
[1:33:20] and they would pile themselves under
[1:33:23] quilts how many any of you ever slept
[1:33:25] that way
[1:33:26] piled under quilts so heavy you could
[1:33:29] hardly turn over
[1:33:31] maybe I need to try that again because I
[1:33:33] toss and turn a lot you wouldn't
[1:33:35] couldn't toss and turn a lot under all
[1:33:36] those heavy quilts
[1:33:39] brother Branham talks about in in his
[1:33:42] childhood uh the the children's eyes and
[1:33:46] you've you've experienced this kind of
[1:33:48] cold at night and and it forms some kind
[1:33:52] of little mucus I I don't want to make
[1:33:54] you nauseated but some kind of film gets
[1:33:57] down in your eye they they used to call
[1:34:00] the dry part of it cracklins
[1:34:03] I've heard my granny say come here honey
[1:34:05] let me wipe the cracklins out of your
[1:34:07] eye by the way that's not the kind that
[1:34:09] goes into cornbread that's not Kosher
[1:34:11] moving right along
[1:34:13] brother Adam talks about they would wake
[1:34:15] up and their eyes would be frozen
[1:34:17] swelled matted I think is the word I'm
[1:34:20] looking for matted shut
[1:34:24] you know the church has got a problem
[1:34:26] with matted eyes
[1:34:28] but God's got a bride he can talk to
[1:34:32] she may not always listen the first time
[1:34:34] but he'll just keep talking to her
[1:34:37] how many of you are glad to say I'm one
[1:34:39] of them
[1:34:40] he just keeps talking to her
[1:34:42] getting all the religion out of us
[1:34:45] God didn't call you out of
[1:34:46] denominationalism to put you in some
[1:34:49] other kind of bondage
[1:34:52] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:34:54] shall
[1:34:56] make you free
[1:34:58] you're recreated by truth you're not
[1:35:02] just set free by truth but you become a
[1:35:05] new creature a new creation because of
[1:35:07] Truth are you with me so all the little
[1:35:10] kids piled under the the quilts you know
[1:35:13] their eyes would be matted together and
[1:35:15] and Mama or granny or whoever would go
[1:35:18] over to the wood stove light up the fire
[1:35:20] and there would always be a can does
[1:35:23] anybody remember the grease can
[1:35:26] my grandmother kept them uh I look like
[1:35:29] a almost looked like a coffee pot made
[1:35:31] out of tin had a spout on it and
[1:35:33] everything and that's where the bacon
[1:35:35] grease would go
[1:35:36] but in brother branham's childhood it
[1:35:38] was Greece can you imagine
[1:35:43] and I'm sorry to tell you I've I've had
[1:35:46] a little raccoon a time or two in my
[1:35:48] life
[1:35:49] and it's not much to have
[1:35:52] the one thing you can say about that and
[1:35:54] opossum both on kosher by the way uh the
[1:35:58] one thing you can say about that is
[1:36:00] their fatty
[1:36:01] and they're they produce a lot of Grease
[1:36:04] and so mama would go over to the stove
[1:36:07] and she would put that pot down on the
[1:36:09] eye
[1:36:10] and she would melt the Grease
[1:36:14] and when it got runny enough to you
[1:36:16] she'd stick her hand down in it and she
[1:36:19] would massage that warm grease in
[1:36:24] their eyes until the Madding would go
[1:36:26] away and they could open up their eyes
[1:36:28] and see clearly
[1:36:30] sometimes we need the Holy Spirit
[1:36:34] to apply the ice have to Open the Eyes
[1:36:38] of our understanding so that we can see
[1:36:40] what God's word is really trying to say
[1:36:43] to us you can sit this is my whole point
[1:36:46] if I could get this across this morning
[1:36:48] we could go home in five minutes
[1:36:50] because my whole point is this if you
[1:36:54] could see the power and the
[1:36:56] effectiveness of this word
[1:36:59] you would never miss your opportunity to
[1:37:03] be changed by it
[1:37:06] nobody would have to preach to you to
[1:37:08] read your Bible I read where brother
[1:37:10] random said a Christian would read one
[1:37:13] chapter at least one chapter of the
[1:37:15] Bible every day this was his thoughts on
[1:37:18] being faithful to God's word
[1:37:20] what I have found about that is if
[1:37:23] you're not careful it becomes a habit
[1:37:26] and you just rush to get through it
[1:37:29] and it's not how much of God's word you
[1:37:31] go through but it's how much of God's
[1:37:33] word goes through you
[1:37:36] are you letting the word that you hear
[1:37:38] be effective in your life you control
[1:37:41] that
[1:37:42] may I tell you this morning and again if
[1:37:45] you get it we could just go home may I
[1:37:48] tell you that you control the
[1:37:51] effectiveness of the word of God in your
[1:37:54] life
[1:37:57] I don't care how powerful it is I don't
[1:38:00] care how unique it is
[1:38:02] I don't care if it's something you have
[1:38:04] never heard before and you just drop
[1:38:07] your mouth and you say wow
[1:38:11] it's possible that even in that wow
[1:38:14] moment you are not changed by that word
[1:38:18] because you don't do your part
[1:38:22] you see you control the effectiveness of
[1:38:25] God's word in your in your life in your
[1:38:29] heart in your life and we're going to
[1:38:31] talk just a little bit about how that is
[1:38:33] done we are still speaking on the sword
[1:38:36] the labor and the rest
[1:38:39] I am amazed at this verse of scripture
[1:38:43] that tells us that we must labor to come
[1:38:48] into rest
[1:38:50] it seems like a great Paradox let us
[1:38:54] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[1:38:58] let me paraphrase that for you by saying
[1:39:01] it's not going to come automatically to
[1:39:05] you
[1:39:05] you're not going to find the rest that
[1:39:08] the Apostle is talking about uh you're
[1:39:10] not going to just stumble onto it
[1:39:13] you're going to have to pursue it
[1:39:16] now truth is chasing after you do you
[1:39:19] believe that because remember truth is a
[1:39:22] person
[1:39:22] it's not a Doctrine it's a person Lord
[1:39:25] Jesus Christ or you might say Yeshua our
[1:39:28] Messiah one in the same he's chasing us
[1:39:33] and why is he pursuing us because before
[1:39:37] the foundation of the world he knew us
[1:39:40] the Bible said so
[1:39:42] in fact the New Testament tells us I you
[1:39:45] have not chosen me
[1:39:50] I know people are scared scared of
[1:39:52] Calvinism
[1:39:54] because Calvinism went into into a hyper
[1:39:57] Grace
[1:39:58] and that's not according to the word but
[1:40:01] I want you to know Calvin didn't have
[1:40:03] everything wrong because he was reading
[1:40:06] the Bible one day and he saw where the
[1:40:08] Bible said you have not chosen me but I
[1:40:11] have chosen you says the Lord
[1:40:15] and what that means is before the
[1:40:17] foundation of the world God knew you
[1:40:21] before your mother or father ever gave
[1:40:23] you your name your God already knew you
[1:40:28] before you were ever born from your
[1:40:30] mother's womb your God already knew you
[1:40:34] in fact the scripture tells us that
[1:40:37] every one of our days was already
[1:40:41] recorded in his book before we were ever
[1:40:44] born
[1:40:48] you know why that's good news to me
[1:40:51] it means that nothing in my life is ever
[1:40:55] going to take God by surprise
[1:40:59] good bad ugly he saw it
[1:41:05] when it ever came my way and not only
[1:41:08] church did he see it but he provided
[1:41:11] Grace
[1:41:14] he provided a way of Escape
[1:41:18] he saw my Temptation before I was ever
[1:41:22] born but with every Temptation he made a
[1:41:26] way of Escape
[1:41:28] for me to get out of that mess
[1:41:31] he saw it
[1:41:33] and he not only knew what I was going to
[1:41:35] face but let me remind you he knew my
[1:41:38] choice
[1:41:41] he knew that I would one day choose him
[1:41:44] in my case as an 18 month old baby when
[1:41:48] I chose the Lord
[1:41:50] but see that was my will that was my
[1:41:52] desire that was something stirring on
[1:41:55] the inside of me and I didn't know way
[1:41:57] back then
[1:41:58] that he had already chosen me
[1:42:01] and then as that little a child about
[1:42:03] all four five years old when I prayed
[1:42:06] that prayer at the Baptist Sunday school
[1:42:08] sung my prayer come into my heart
[1:42:11] come into my heart he did imagine that
[1:42:14] he did
[1:42:16] change my life at five years old fill me
[1:42:19] with the Holy Ghost at seven years old
[1:42:21] he knew he knew my life he knew the
[1:42:25] difficulty of my life he knew the
[1:42:27] hardships of my life and he provided
[1:42:29] Grace
[1:42:31] you might say he deposited Grace in my
[1:42:34] grace account for the day that I would
[1:42:36] need to make some withdrawals has
[1:42:38] anybody in here ever needed to withdraw
[1:42:40] some Grace from your grace account
[1:42:44] Hallelujah unlock your bank account
[1:42:48] Your Grace account will never be an
[1:42:50] overdraft
[1:42:54] Hallelujah there'll never be a thirty
[1:42:56] dollar fee
[1:42:57] because there will always be enough
[1:42:59] Grace
[1:43:01] Hallelujah because I'm his
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:09] nothing is going to happen in my life
[1:43:10] that he hasn't already seen
[1:43:13] and that he hasn't already made a way of
[1:43:15] Escape
[1:43:16] but I have something to do
[1:43:19] I have to learn to trust him
[1:43:22] and when that word of God is going forth
[1:43:24] just as it's going forth this morning I
[1:43:27] can't sleep
[1:43:29] and I can't be distracted
[1:43:31] there's tons of things to distract us
[1:43:34] you know I don't want to keep talking
[1:43:36] about being over 50 but but you you find
[1:43:39] aches and pains
[1:43:41] you find situations that can distract
[1:43:43] you sometimes it hurts to sit sometimes
[1:43:46] it hurts to stand and you could easily
[1:43:48] be distracted by things but you have to
[1:43:51] make up your mind that I'm going to look
[1:43:53] to the words
[1:43:55] because in that book is my answer
[1:43:58] and I may not need it today but Monday's
[1:44:01] coming
[1:44:02] whoa it takes Grace to get through a
[1:44:05] Monday
[1:44:07] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[1:44:08] Saturday Sunday too
[1:44:10] but that Grace is already there but I
[1:44:12] have to participate with that Grace
[1:44:15] and I have to participate with the
[1:44:17] father's plan for my life
[1:44:19] I want to tell you something God's going
[1:44:21] to win
[1:44:24] sister Flo said something about Trey
[1:44:27] there kind of running or getting trying
[1:44:29] to get around the call that would have
[1:44:31] been my advice to him if he would have
[1:44:33] asked me as a 10 year old boy
[1:44:35] and he would have said to me brother
[1:44:36] Shelly I I feel like maybe I'm called to
[1:44:39] preach you all know what I tell people
[1:44:40] who say that to me I always say to them
[1:44:43] run
[1:44:47] run because the pulpits are full of mama
[1:44:51] called Daddy called
[1:44:54] Church club called preachers
[1:44:58] if you're just going to be another one
[1:45:00] of them sit down
[1:45:02] we don't have time for that but if he's
[1:45:05] really calling you guess what Young
[1:45:07] Brother he'll win
[1:45:10] you will never outrun this God we serve
[1:45:14] he will hunt you down
[1:45:17] he'll chase you to the uttermost parts
[1:45:20] of the earth and find you you'll never
[1:45:24] outrun the call of God in your life a
[1:45:28] man running from the presence of the
[1:45:29] Lord is the most foolish man on the
[1:45:31] Earth
[1:45:32] because he actually thinks one day he'll
[1:45:34] outrun God you will never outrun him
[1:45:37] David said though I make my bed in hell
[1:45:42] oh I take the wings of the morning and
[1:45:45] fly away like a dove he'll come to me
[1:45:47] there though I go to you know India with
[1:45:50] a backpack and climb the Himalayas and
[1:45:53] smoke dope and grow dreadlocks and
[1:45:58] he will find me there
[1:46:02] on the back side of the desert are
[1:46:05] sitting on the front row of the church
[1:46:07] wherever you end up if you belong to him
[1:46:10] and he has laid a high and holy calling
[1:46:13] on your life you'll never get away from
[1:46:16] him
[1:46:19] that's his love
[1:46:21] Oh How He Loves You and Me Oh How He
[1:46:25] let's Praise Him
[1:46:26] let's Praise Him
[1:46:28] [Applause]
[1:46:30] thank you for loving us
[1:46:33] thank you for loving us
[1:46:35] all right
[1:46:39] when we started the series
[1:46:42] we started in the Book of Genesis
[1:46:44] chapter one
[1:46:46] verse 27.
[1:46:48] so God created man in his own image
[1:46:52] in the image of God created he him
[1:46:55] male and female created he them
[1:46:59] and then in Genesis 2 7 and the Lord God
[1:47:03] formed man of the Dust of the ground
[1:47:06] Earth
[1:47:07] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:47:12] breath of life which is the atmosphere
[1:47:14] of Heaven
[1:47:16] So Adam Adam in Hebrew made of the red
[1:47:20] Earth
[1:47:21] a portion of Adam was of the earth
[1:47:24] earthy
[1:47:26] Dusty
[1:47:27] carnal
[1:47:30] emotional it would be once it had some
[1:47:34] life in it it's just a clay body now but
[1:47:37] then God Almighty hello God almighty
[1:47:42] reached over the balconies of Eternity
[1:47:45] and
[1:47:47] performed
[1:47:49] mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Adam he
[1:47:52] put his mouth over Adam's mouth
[1:47:55] and he breathed into Adam
[1:47:58] the Breath of Life
[1:48:01] which we would call ruach hakodesh the
[1:48:05] holy spirit of God he breathed in this
[1:48:09] Mortal dirt body a body of dust and Clay
[1:48:13] he breathed into him the very Breath of
[1:48:17] God we might in Greek call it Zoe which
[1:48:21] is which is God's own life I want you to
[1:48:25] know when you receive the true genuine
[1:48:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:31] when you have obeyed God's word Acts 2
[1:48:34] 38 repent
[1:48:36] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:48:39] name of Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah
[1:48:42] for the remission of your sins you shall
[1:48:45] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when
[1:48:48] you are filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:48:51] are being filled with the very Spirit
[1:48:53] life of Eternal God
[1:48:55] so that Zoe life is now inside of you in
[1:49:00] the same manner it was once inside of
[1:49:01] Adam
[1:49:02] and when that Breath of God went into
[1:49:05] Adam he was no more just bones and skin
[1:49:08] and flesh and dust and Clay but he was
[1:49:12] now a miniature God
[1:49:18] now that's where the church is check out
[1:49:20] that's where so many denominationally
[1:49:22] minded people check out but we can't
[1:49:25] change the Hebrew
[1:49:27] we can't change the original language of
[1:49:29] the Bible and the Bible is telling us
[1:49:31] that he was made in the very image and
[1:49:34] then the very likeness of God
[1:49:37] and if he were not God then he would be
[1:49:39] an idol
[1:49:41] and there's a lot of things God is but
[1:49:44] he is not an idol maker he's not an idol
[1:49:47] Builder God knew exactly what he was
[1:49:49] doing he made him with a with a holy
[1:49:52] holy spirit in him he created him and
[1:49:55] the Bible said when that breath went
[1:49:57] into that body Man became a living soul
[1:50:00] so he was not only given Spirit breath
[1:50:03] or Spirit life but now he was given mine
[1:50:06] will and emotions and God didn't make a
[1:50:08] mistake he knew that when when when
[1:50:11] Satan would show up in the garden and
[1:50:13] and possess this body of the serpent
[1:50:17] and speak lies he knew that when Adam
[1:50:21] would stand between Eve and and God and
[1:50:25] partake in the sin that Eve had already
[1:50:29] partook of
[1:50:30] God knew that in that moment that Adam
[1:50:33] would become the intercessor
[1:50:35] that was the first Adam
[1:50:38] did you all hear Pastor Tate talking to
[1:50:40] us last week about the last Adam
[1:50:43] we'll never need another one Jesus
[1:50:45] became the last Adam didn't he oh and
[1:50:48] everything that was lost because of the
[1:50:50] fall of the first Adam is regained in
[1:50:52] our lives as Believers because of the
[1:50:55] Redemptive nature of the last Adam
[1:50:57] so everything that Adam was you can be
[1:51:03] if you keep cooperating with that word
[1:51:06] you see we believe that there's going to
[1:51:08] be a short quick period of time on the
[1:51:10] earth before the bride is changed
[1:51:13] and in that moment we believe with
[1:51:15] everything that is within us that that
[1:51:18] there's going to be a bride of Believers
[1:51:20] sons of God on the earth that will
[1:51:23] function for a very short amount of time
[1:51:25] in the full Authority and Dominion of a
[1:51:28] living God just like Adam had in the
[1:51:30] beginning
[1:51:31] it's very scriptural by the way
[1:51:34] we understand that when Adam wanted to
[1:51:36] make changes in the garden he didn't do
[1:51:38] it with a shovel in a bucket
[1:51:40] he did it by the power of the spoken
[1:51:42] word
[1:51:43] we can say today that there is a people
[1:51:45] there is a people not there will be
[1:51:48] there is a pimple that carry the power
[1:51:51] and the authority of the spoken word in
[1:51:54] them right now
[1:51:57] it's not fully manifested because we're
[1:51:59] being dealt with in the soul
[1:52:04] the mind has got to get straightened out
[1:52:07] that's where the greatest battle ever
[1:52:08] fought is taking place every time
[1:52:10] Benjamin sang that verse I'm pointing up
[1:52:12] here this is the prison
[1:52:15] this is a pretty I I've never you know
[1:52:17] I've never been to jail in the natural
[1:52:19] I've never been in in real prison chains
[1:52:22] but I want you to know I can lock myself
[1:52:24] up into prison right here in my mind
[1:52:26] how many of you believe you can bind
[1:52:28] yourself
[1:52:29] you can limit yourself
[1:52:31] and right here nobody nobody has to talk
[1:52:34] to you you can do enough of that to
[1:52:35] yourself
[1:52:37] it's not other people's words that give
[1:52:39] me the most of my problem it's my own
[1:52:41] words it's my own thoughts and so we are
[1:52:45] dealing with stuff are you with me maybe
[1:52:48] this is just a lot of review for you but
[1:52:51] help me anyway
[1:52:53] we're dealing with a lot of stuff here
[1:52:55] and and you know our trials can get
[1:52:57] quite unique
[1:53:00] they're they're tailor-made
[1:53:03] their personality uh uh determined
[1:53:07] my trials will not look exactly like
[1:53:10] yours
[1:53:11] yours won't look exactly like mine now
[1:53:13] there are many common factors
[1:53:15] because Satan is not really that
[1:53:17] original
[1:53:21] so he really tells the same lie
[1:53:24] he just kind of dresses it up a little
[1:53:26] differently for whoever he's telling it
[1:53:28] to but the lies are pretty much the same
[1:53:30] but the situations in life will be
[1:53:33] different
[1:53:34] our family life will be different our
[1:53:36] our our work career will be different
[1:53:38] and our relationships will be different
[1:53:41] because what we're walking through now
[1:53:43] was tailor-made
[1:53:47] for you
[1:53:49] harnessed
[1:53:52] somebody said well wasn't it a wasn't it
[1:53:54] a a a product or a result of my choices
[1:53:58] exactly right but you're remembering
[1:54:01] perhaps that God who is Sovereign he
[1:54:04] knew the kind of stupid decisions I was
[1:54:06] going to make
[1:54:07] before I was ever born he knew all my
[1:54:10] uprisings and my down settings he knew
[1:54:13] all my strengths and he knew all of my
[1:54:15] weaknesses he knew the things that would
[1:54:17] tempt me and he knew the things that I
[1:54:19] would easily overcome are you with me
[1:54:22] and so my life was Tailor Made By Design
[1:54:25] and yes a lot of it is a result of my
[1:54:28] own poor choices but I want you to know
[1:54:30] God knew that from the beginning
[1:54:33] and he allowed those things into my life
[1:54:36] to shape me to mold me to make me to a
[1:54:40] place
[1:54:41] where I can win this mind battle
[1:54:45] he brought me to a place where I can
[1:54:47] ultimately lay my will down
[1:54:50] how many of you feel yourself getting
[1:54:52] closer to that day
[1:54:54] anybody put your hand up if you can say
[1:54:57] I really feel myself getting closer to
[1:54:59] that day that I can just surrender all
[1:55:01] my will
[1:55:04] you might as well
[1:55:06] he's not going to give up on you
[1:55:08] if you belong to him he's going to keep
[1:55:10] pursuing you the quicker you surrender
[1:55:13] the better off we're all going to be
[1:55:15] because sometimes you make us miserable
[1:55:17] given God such a hard time
[1:55:21] even my life would be a whole lot easier
[1:55:24] don't get me started
[1:55:27] if you'd quit running
[1:55:29] if you'd quit being so hard-headed but
[1:55:31] we all have the life to get through we
[1:55:33] all have these situations and
[1:55:35] circumstances to get through but every
[1:55:37] one of them are accomplishing something
[1:55:38] that's what you've got to remember when
[1:55:40] you're in the heat of the thing when
[1:55:42] you're in the thick of the thing you've
[1:55:43] got to keep asking yourself what's God
[1:55:45] teaching me
[1:55:47] why would you want to ask a silly
[1:55:49] question like that because the quicker
[1:55:50] you know what the end result of this
[1:55:52] test is going to be the quicker you can
[1:55:55] cooperate
[1:55:57] the quicker you can say yes sir I get it
[1:56:04] you're a little quiet this morning
[1:56:07] but it's still the truth
[1:56:09] you see when and when when Adam was made
[1:56:11] here he was made of two Realms the Earth
[1:56:14] realm and the Heavenly Realm he had a
[1:56:17] body of clay a body of flesh but the
[1:56:19] inner part of Adam was Heavenly Oh what
[1:56:23] a beautiful beautiful Synergy took place
[1:56:26] that day what a beautiful Union took
[1:56:28] place that day when the Breath of Heaven
[1:56:30] the Breath of God came down and touched
[1:56:33] the dusty body of man made in the image
[1:56:35] and likeness of God and he became a
[1:56:38] living Soul stood on his feet with the
[1:56:40] authority of God when he needed to put
[1:56:43] an apple tree somewhere he didn't have
[1:56:44] to have the shovel to do it he just said
[1:56:46] be there
[1:56:47] somebody said where do you get an idea
[1:56:49] like that Jesus taught it in the New
[1:56:51] Testament if you can just have faith as
[1:56:53] a grain of mustard seed you can say to
[1:56:54] the mountain be moved and it must pick
[1:56:56] itself up and be cast into the sea
[1:56:58] somebody said is that literal do you
[1:57:01] have a literal Mountain that needs to be
[1:57:02] moved because God's in the business of
[1:57:05] moving literal mountains if he needs to
[1:57:06] be but most of our mountains are not
[1:57:09] literal mountains of dirt
[1:57:11] most of our mountains are obstacles that
[1:57:13] the enemy has placed in our way and I'm
[1:57:15] telling you you've got authority over
[1:57:16] that talk to it I preaching to somebody
[1:57:19] talk to it
[1:57:21] [Applause]
[1:57:22] you get out of my way
[1:57:26] my God has given me victory over you you
[1:57:29] move out of my way I'm moving forward to
[1:57:32] do the will of my father
[1:57:36] stop me I
[1:57:40] I find yourself doing is going over the
[1:57:42] mountain
[1:57:46] God's about overcoming power
[1:57:49] how many of you feel is overcoming power
[1:57:51] in your life at times when you just
[1:57:53] can't seem to get it now we know what
[1:57:55] happened I gotta move on uh there was a
[1:57:59] serpent in the garden
[1:58:01] he was not a rattlesnake by the way
[1:58:03] we've had two big rattlesnakes killed
[1:58:05] here on the campground in the last few
[1:58:06] weeks we're not going to stop till we
[1:58:08] get them all
[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:13] it's over we might just invite all of
[1:58:15] them in the county come on over here
[1:58:16] coach we're going to fix you
[1:58:21] I hadn't got to kill one of these yet
[1:58:23] but I want you to know when I'm done
[1:58:25] they're dead
[1:58:27] I got a feeling Chad and Nathan are
[1:58:29] about the same way
[1:58:30] the first thing I see is the heads one
[1:58:32] place and the body's another that's a
[1:58:34] good place to start somebody said isn't
[1:58:36] that God's creation yeah and he can put
[1:58:38] it somewhere else besides here
[1:58:44] and if you're like like brother man
[1:58:47] Sonny if you're a a snake person well
[1:58:49] then maybe I'll just speak to him
[1:58:52] get off this Eagles Refuge hole in this
[1:58:55] Campground
[1:58:56] I don't want you where my children are
[1:58:58] playing
[1:59:00] come on
[1:59:01] but this this serpent wasn't like that
[1:59:03] it didn't crawl on its belly it walked
[1:59:06] upright
[1:59:08] and it wasn't ugly
[1:59:11] now
[1:59:12] must have been attractive
[1:59:15] and it was made so similar to the body
[1:59:17] of a man
[1:59:19] that you would have almost thought it
[1:59:20] was a buddy or something because Eve had
[1:59:23] no problem communicating with this
[1:59:25] serpent
[1:59:27] and I don't know a woman yet that's
[1:59:28] going to stand like the little
[1:59:30] children's Bible propped up against a
[1:59:32] tree and talked to a called up
[1:59:33] rattlesnake like it's her best friend
[1:59:35] the church can be so stupid sometimes
[1:59:38] can't we can't we all the spirits out
[1:59:42] there and sometimes it looks like the
[1:59:43] church gets all the spirit of stupid
[1:59:47] but but we all believed it
[1:59:49] we couldn't see beyond that that's all
[1:59:52] we could see even though we knew our
[1:59:53] wives and mothers and sisters would
[1:59:55] never do that but he would well it's
[1:59:56] because the serpent didn't look like
[1:59:58] that it wasn't cold around anything it
[2:00:00] stood upright reason had the ability to
[2:00:02] reason
[2:00:04] had the ability to talk and communicate
[2:00:06] with Eve and it didn't hiss at her at
[2:00:08] all because if it would have his she'd
[2:00:09] run
[2:00:11] you see Satan entered into that created
[2:00:14] Beast and began to talk through that
[2:00:16] Beast to Eve in such a way that it
[2:00:18] caused her to doubt the goodness of God
[2:00:24] if the enemy can cause you to believe
[2:00:27] that God is not fair that God is Not
[2:00:30] ultimately good that God is not out for
[2:00:32] you I want you to know he can sell you
[2:00:34] swampland in Florida to build your house
[2:00:36] on if the enemy can convince you that
[2:00:40] your God is not really a good God
[2:00:45] there are people in this room most all
[2:00:47] of us have struggled with a thought or
[2:00:49] two like that along the way how the bad
[2:00:52] things happen to good people and what
[2:00:54] kind of a just God would allow some of
[2:00:57] those things to take place that is the
[2:00:59] reasoning of the serpent
[2:01:01] it cost Eve to lay down her her moral it
[2:01:05] caused her to lay down what God had
[2:01:07] spoken to her she exchanged the word for
[2:01:11] a seed of discrepancy
[2:01:15] we could almost say that in that moment
[2:01:17] denominations were born
[2:01:22] because that's where we are in an hour
[2:01:24] like this men and women are every day
[2:01:27] willing to lay down the word of God to
[2:01:29] believe a seed of discrepancy
[2:01:32] that will never produce a seed of God
[2:01:35] a seed of discrepancy will never produce
[2:01:37] a Son of God a seed of discrepancy will
[2:01:40] always produce the son of a lie the son
[2:01:43] of a Bond woman not the son of a free
[2:01:45] woman how many of you know our mother is
[2:01:47] Jerusalem and she is not a Bond woman
[2:01:50] she's a free woman
[2:01:51] the Bible tells us our mother is free
[2:01:54] Hallelujah
[2:01:57] it's not Hagar
[2:02:00] and this is the goodness of God to us so
[2:02:03] when when Adam realized
[2:02:06] what Eve had done that's when he stepped
[2:02:08] up and said I've got to face God on her
[2:02:10] behalf
[2:02:12] and then we talked about the fact that
[2:02:13] in the cool of the day God came down but
[2:02:16] Adam and Eve weren't standing in the
[2:02:17] clearing to meet him were they they were
[2:02:19] hiding in the bushes and they their
[2:02:21] their answer was we're naked who told
[2:02:23] you your name nobody had to tell them
[2:02:26] because they send away the glory
[2:02:29] that had covered their bodies
[2:02:32] they were hidden in Shekinah light
[2:02:36] if you would have seen him you'd have
[2:02:38] thought they were angels
[2:02:40] because like Christ on the on the Mount
[2:02:42] of transfiguration light was emanating
[2:02:45] from their body we would know that if we
[2:02:47] didn't see it in the Hebrew
[2:02:49] the English doesn't seem to give us that
[2:02:52] quiet description but Hebrew helps us to
[2:02:54] know that they were clouded in light
[2:02:57] as soon as the fall took place that
[2:02:59] light left them and they realized they
[2:03:01] were naked and they covered up those
[2:03:03] parts that didn't need to be shown
[2:03:06] and they're hiding
[2:03:08] because they thought that God had come
[2:03:10] down to kill him
[2:03:12] but God didn't come down to kill him he
[2:03:14] came down to cover them
[2:03:18] I know you know that but you could
[2:03:19] squeeze an amen
[2:03:21] because somebody needs to tell their
[2:03:23] neighbor
[2:03:24] God's not out trying to kill you he
[2:03:27] wants to provide a covering for your sin
[2:03:31] the lamb is worthy how many of you know
[2:03:35] the lamb is Worthy
[2:03:38] and so the Bible said in Genesis 3 21 I
[2:03:40] know this is review
[2:03:42] pour you
[2:03:44] Genesis 3 21 unto Adam also unto his
[2:03:47] wife did the Lord God make
[2:03:51] coats of skin and clothing
[2:03:53] did you know God's a tailor
[2:03:55] did you know God's a seamstress
[2:03:57] did you know he knows how to make coats
[2:03:59] of skin
[2:04:01] but anybody that knows anything about
[2:04:02] animal skins knows you can't separate an
[2:04:05] animal from his skin without shedding
[2:04:06] blood and so right here the principle
[2:04:09] has started
[2:04:10] it started in the garden with an
[2:04:12] exchange of blood now the principle of
[2:04:15] redemption is started because these
[2:04:17] little lambs
[2:04:19] whatever they were fleecy animals they
[2:04:22] had to lose their lives
[2:04:24] God slayed them with his own hands and
[2:04:27] he made from their coat from their skin
[2:04:29] from their fur he made coats of skin for
[2:04:32] Adam and Eve
[2:04:34] because God was about to separate them
[2:04:36] from the garden of delight
[2:04:38] he was about to drive them out of Eden
[2:04:40] because there's one thing that God
[2:04:42] didn't compromise on and that is he was
[2:04:44] not allowed death in Eden not in the
[2:04:47] garden there could be no death in the
[2:04:48] garden are you with me no graves in the
[2:04:51] garden no graves in the garden so now
[2:04:53] Adam is going to die and Eve is going to
[2:04:55] die because they've sinned they've
[2:04:57] believed the LIE of the enemy and now
[2:04:59] their physical bodies are going to die
[2:05:00] and they're going to be placed in the
[2:05:02] grave one day and God said there'll be
[2:05:04] no graves in this Garden of Eden that's
[2:05:06] the garden of the light
[2:05:08] so they're going to have to be buried
[2:05:09] outside so we might as well get the
[2:05:11] business done and he drove them into
[2:05:13] Exile isn't that what the Bible tells us
[2:05:16] Genesis 3 24 so he drove out the man and
[2:05:21] he placed at the east of the Garden of
[2:05:24] Eden cherubims
[2:05:26] and a flaming sword
[2:05:29] which turned every way
[2:05:36] not to keep men out
[2:05:39] like we were taught
[2:05:42] but to protect and guard the way
[2:05:45] to the Tree of Life
[2:05:46] because no more would man just be able
[2:05:49] to go in man could have gone in and took
[2:05:51] a bite of that tree of life which
[2:05:53] represented the eternal life of God and
[2:05:56] man could have gone in and took a bite
[2:05:57] of that and try and lived forever the
[2:05:59] problem with that is with an unredeemed
[2:06:01] nature
[2:06:02] and God said I can't let that happen oh
[2:06:05] no that's not going to happen I'm not
[2:06:07] going to have a man 900 years old with
[2:06:09] no hope of salvation for today I'm going
[2:06:12] to Institute the plan of the Lamb the
[2:06:14] Lamb's plan is going into action today
[2:06:18] and I'm going to drive them out of the
[2:06:19] garden and I love it the way brother
[2:06:21] Branham explained it let me read it to
[2:06:23] you real quick even though I've already
[2:06:25] done that in in the cruelty of sin and
[2:06:27] the penalty that it costs to rid Sin
[2:06:29] from our lives paragraph 105 uh uh is
[2:06:32] that the one I want I can certainly do
[2:06:34] that one yeah I had gone back a little
[2:06:36] bit I think but that you're you're it's
[2:06:38] much better
[2:06:40] how I would like to deal there just a
[2:06:42] little bit and eat and notice when they
[2:06:44] were driven from the garden because of
[2:06:46] transgression all the blessings cut off
[2:06:49] because of transgression and I think
[2:06:51] tonight that's what's the matter with
[2:06:53] the church all the blessings are being
[2:06:55] cut off because of transgression there
[2:06:57] you are in that serious driven
[2:07:02] driven from the Garden of Eden
[2:07:04] now I want you to notice here come when
[2:07:06] Cain and Abel the two sons of Adam and
[2:07:09] Eve came forward to make an offering
[2:07:11] I believe the great cherubim was at the
[2:07:14] East side of the gate and that sword
[2:07:16] whirling back and forth guarding the
[2:07:19] gate there that entered into Eden
[2:07:21] noticed fire
[2:07:24] somebody say fire
[2:07:27] you don't believe in the Holy Ghost
[2:07:28] baptism
[2:07:30] you don't believe a little bit of
[2:07:32] tongues
[2:07:33] you don't believe in the quickening
[2:07:35] power you don't believe in somebody
[2:07:36] jumping around a little bit
[2:07:39] then you don't understand what the fire
[2:07:41] can do to a man
[2:07:43] Jeremiah encountered the fire of God he
[2:07:45] said it does it doesn't just feel like
[2:07:47] fire on the flesh it feels like fire is
[2:07:50] shut up in the marrow of my bone and I
[2:07:53] cannot control what God is doing in me
[2:07:56] that's the best place to be
[2:07:58] you all and I included we need to be in
[2:08:01] a surrendered place where we can no
[2:08:02] longer control the work that God is
[2:08:04] accomplishing in us because when we get
[2:08:07] in control
[2:08:09] we quench the Holy Spirit
[2:08:11] so we say Come Holy Spirit and stay as
[2:08:14] long as you want to stay and do whatever
[2:08:16] you need to do
[2:08:18] because we'll never get this Sunday
[2:08:19] morning back
[2:08:20] we'll never get August the 20th 2023
[2:08:24] back once we're finished with this we'll
[2:08:26] never be able to come back and reclaim
[2:08:27] it so if we waste one second of our time
[2:08:30] together today and we don't allow the
[2:08:32] Holy Spirit to burn in us like a fire
[2:08:34] and the word to cleanse us and sift us
[2:08:38] we may never get the same opportunity
[2:08:41] again because when we come back Tuesday
[2:08:43] night the anointing will be different
[2:08:45] and the call will be different and the
[2:08:46] purpose will be different watch and the
[2:08:49] crowd will be different
[2:08:51] remember I told you Sister Green used to
[2:08:53] say right in the middle of a great big
[2:08:54] time we're having the most wonderful
[2:08:56] time the kids are there she is having a
[2:08:59] blast she's reliving in fact she's 80
[2:09:02] something years old and riding horses
[2:09:03] with us
[2:09:04] she is really living life and all of a
[2:09:07] sudden in the middle of all that fun
[2:09:08] she'd say
[2:09:10] oh
[2:09:12] what's wrong sister green it's never
[2:09:14] going to be this way again
[2:09:19] what do you mean it's it's never going
[2:09:20] to be this way again
[2:09:22] we'll never be gathered just like we're
[2:09:24] gathered together
[2:09:25] again somebody will be missing something
[2:09:28] will be different
[2:09:30] it'll never be exactly like it is
[2:09:33] and I'd say to her then what we have to
[2:09:35] do is make the most of this we cannot
[2:09:37] let one moment of this slip by us we
[2:09:40] have to live to the foolish right now
[2:09:41] and enjoy every second of this let's go
[2:09:43] get ice cream she'd say okay
[2:09:47] she was right
[2:09:49] because we got that call just a few
[2:09:51] months ago that she had stepped out of
[2:09:53] this body
[2:09:54] and into another eternity and when my
[2:09:56] wife and I flew back to Tucson to do her
[2:09:58] funeral we realized
[2:10:01] that same Eerie feeling that fell on us
[2:10:03] in 2015 when we went back to to Barry
[2:10:06] brother green that same feeling I
[2:10:08] remember as we landed remember saying
[2:10:10] Tucson will never be the same for me
[2:10:12] again
[2:10:13] and I remember the same feeling coming
[2:10:15] in as we were going to Barry sister
[2:10:16] green Tucson will never be quite the
[2:10:19] same again we'll never go out that Bear
[2:10:21] Canyon road again and pick her up in
[2:10:23] that van and and have to push her up in
[2:10:26] that van and holler to Harmony and it's
[2:10:28] over
[2:10:29] and that is really how life is so I
[2:10:33] encourage you don't spend a day pouting
[2:10:39] don't spend the day sold up
[2:10:42] miserable mad at somebody holding a
[2:10:45] grudge against somebody live life in the
[2:10:49] Holy Spirit
[2:10:50] refuse to waste a moment of time in this
[2:10:54] life being mad at somebody
[2:10:56] you control that
[2:10:58] oh I'm preaching
[2:11:01] I don't know if anybody's helping me but
[2:11:03] I'm preaching
[2:11:04] don't do it don't let the enemy don't
[2:11:06] spend a moment of jail being jealous
[2:11:11] don't spend a moment holding on to
[2:11:13] something that you need to turn loose of
[2:11:15] or trying to want somebody to pay oh I
[2:11:18] want to see him pay
[2:11:21] the problem with that is you'll be the
[2:11:23] one you dig a pit for your brother the
[2:11:25] Bible said you'll fall in it yourself
[2:11:26] you've got to forgive you've got to let
[2:11:29] go hello
[2:11:30] can you hear the Holy Spirit
[2:11:33] you've got to let go
[2:11:36] it was the fire it was the Holy Spirit
[2:11:38] fire that was guarding the gate
[2:11:41] and today that's what guards the gate
[2:11:43] paragraph 107 if you're scared of Holy
[2:11:47] Ghost and Fire you'll never get in
[2:11:50] because you'll say oh the fire is there
[2:11:53] to keep me out
[2:11:55] but the fire is not there to keep you
[2:11:57] out the fire is there to cleanse you as
[2:11:59] you go in
[2:12:01] all we need him
[2:12:03] our God is a consuming fire
[2:12:05] he does not want to destroy you he wants
[2:12:07] to perfect you he wants to complete you
[2:12:10] can you help me
[2:12:11] you don't have to be afraid of that fire
[2:12:13] the fire is soared he said you'll never
[2:12:16] get in fiery sword of God God is a
[2:12:18] consuming fire watching that tree
[2:12:20] guarding that tree of life
[2:12:23] it's not so that he can keep eternal
[2:12:25] life away from you it's so that you can
[2:12:27] realize you'll never have eternal life
[2:12:29] apart from the Sun
[2:12:31] the Messiah
[2:12:33] his shed blood
[2:12:35] you'll only overcome in this life by the
[2:12:37] blood of the Lamb hello
[2:12:39] and the what
[2:12:41] and the word of your testimony you've
[2:12:43] got to tell somebody you can't keep this
[2:12:45] to yourself
[2:12:47] is anybody with me now I want to go
[2:12:49] quickly
[2:12:50] to Hebrews 4 11 in the Amplified
[2:12:53] let us therefore be zealous
[2:12:57] and exert ourselves I like the way the
[2:13:00] Amplified does this just a minute
[2:13:09] any good
[2:13:12] all the time
[2:13:17] nothing automatic here
[2:13:19] we've got to be zealous
[2:13:21] we have to exert ourselves remember King
[2:13:24] James says labor
[2:13:27] have you ever labored
[2:13:29] it takes exertion
[2:13:31] it takes effort
[2:13:33] it takes inertia
[2:13:35] you've got to be zealous and exert
[2:13:38] yourself and strive
[2:13:41] diligently Faithfully
[2:13:45] you can't you you can't try this week
[2:13:48] and give up next week
[2:13:52] you can't run the aisles this Sunday and
[2:13:54] next Sunday sit back there like you've
[2:13:56] lost your best friend
[2:14:00] oh just a minute
[2:14:01] um
[2:14:03] come on preacher
[2:14:05] diligently
[2:14:08] persistently
[2:14:11] consistently
[2:14:13] whether I feel like it or whether I
[2:14:16] don't I must be zealous
[2:14:19] to strive diligently to find the rest of
[2:14:23] God
[2:14:24] to know and experience it for ourselves
[2:14:27] my problem with some of my Messianic
[2:14:30] brethren
[2:14:32] is they want to so emphasize a 24-hour
[2:14:36] day
[2:14:38] and I believe it
[2:14:41] I believe God has given us a day of
[2:14:43] Sabbath for rest I believe it's a part
[2:14:45] of its plan
[2:14:46] but if we become legal
[2:14:49] about rest
[2:14:51] we lose the blessing
[2:14:58] if we become so legal that we have to
[2:15:01] get the neighbor
[2:15:03] to push the button on the elevator
[2:15:06] remember how much time I've spent in
[2:15:07] Israel
[2:15:11] if we're if we become so religious that
[2:15:14] we have to call a to come in and
[2:15:17] turn the stove on and off
[2:15:20] because we can't do that on Sabbath
[2:15:23] then it becomes such a Drudge
[2:15:27] then it becomes such a burden
[2:15:29] and the one thing that Jesus wanted us
[2:15:31] to know about Sabbath he is the lord of
[2:15:34] the Sabbath
[2:15:35] and he wanted us to know that he's not
[2:15:37] giving you rest to be a burden on your
[2:15:40] back
[2:15:41] he's giving you rest to foreshadow an
[2:15:45] age of rest and eternal rest so we pause
[2:15:51] to remember
[2:15:55] we pause to remember
[2:15:57] we greet one another if nothing else we
[2:16:00] greet one another shabbat shalom
[2:16:03] to remember that this day is different
[2:16:05] than any other day of the week this is a
[2:16:07] day that God has set aside for us to
[2:16:10] remember his provision
[2:16:12] in our life
[2:16:13] if you have a meal with your family it's
[2:16:16] beautiful to do it
[2:16:18] if you light a candle it's beautiful to
[2:16:20] do it but don't become so religious
[2:16:25] I'm on a preach don't you become so
[2:16:29] religious that you criticize others who
[2:16:32] don't have the same revelation
[2:16:34] I say this to my Holy Name Brethren I
[2:16:37] have friends in the in the sacred name
[2:16:39] movement
[2:16:41] who refused to say the word god
[2:16:46] some erroneously then call him Jehovah
[2:16:49] which we know is not his name
[2:16:52] and some of my friends out there refuse
[2:16:54] to say the name Jesus
[2:16:57] because they heard listen the whole idea
[2:16:59] came from from rabbis who who told
[2:17:02] people in the second temple his name is
[2:17:05] the name of a dog
[2:17:07] and I know Messianic people who will
[2:17:10] never even use the name Jesus because
[2:17:12] they say it's the name of a dog but
[2:17:14] here's what I tell them you've come way
[2:17:17] too late
[2:17:21] I'm very aware of what his Hebrew name
[2:17:23] is very aware I understand it I get it
[2:17:27] but remember I've seen the dead Rays
[2:17:30] using the name of Jesus
[2:17:32] [Applause]
[2:17:34] I've seen cancers fall off use I didn't
[2:17:37] always know his name was Yeshua
[2:17:40] I've seen cancers fall off and blind
[2:17:43] eyes to be open
[2:17:44] and so what I have come to understand is
[2:17:47] it's putting faith
[2:17:49] in the name
[2:17:53] I know men right now I can send you to
[2:17:56] some right now who will argue over
[2:17:58] whether you should say Yeshua yahshua or
[2:18:02] putting the syllable here or the
[2:18:04] emphasis there I want you to know if you
[2:18:07] get carried away in that you will be
[2:18:10] like so many others straining at gnats
[2:18:14] and swallowing camels
[2:18:18] that is being promised to us is arrested
[2:18:21] pursue
[2:18:24] to get to it's a rest that we have to
[2:18:27] shut off our minds we have to stop stop
[2:18:30] the LIE we have to say to the enemy I
[2:18:34] will not
[2:18:36] [Music]
[2:18:37] I'm standing on the word
[2:18:41] I'm not going to become so religious
[2:18:45] that I miss the spirit of Truth
[2:18:48] because the spirit of Truth is what
[2:18:50] transforms it's not the letter of the
[2:18:53] law it's not the letter of doctrine that
[2:18:55] transforms lives it's the spirit you let
[2:18:58] the Living Word show up
[2:19:01] he's pointing us to rest but the Apostle
[2:19:04] here is is making sure that we
[2:19:06] understand it doesn't come automatic
[2:19:07] just because you call yourself a
[2:19:09] Christian doesn't mean you're going to
[2:19:11] find this rest on your own you've got to
[2:19:13] be zealous for it a sister Flo used this
[2:19:16] word about our brother her passionate
[2:19:20] we've got to be passionate
[2:19:22] passion our desire to find the rest
[2:19:23] that's in him
[2:19:27] no May uh that no one may fall or perish
[2:19:31] this is where we're getting to by the
[2:19:34] same kind of unbelief and Disobedience
[2:19:36] into which those in the wilderness fail
[2:19:40] who this is serious business
[2:19:42] for the word that God speaks I love this
[2:19:45] for the word that God speaks you want to
[2:19:47] read it with me is alive and full of
[2:19:50] power making it active operative
[2:19:54] energizing and effective has that been
[2:19:56] your experience with the word
[2:19:59] whoa
[2:20:01] it's not a book of dead rules
[2:20:06] I believe in standards
[2:20:08] I believe in holiness
[2:20:11] I believe that men should dress and live
[2:20:13] and act like men and women should live
[2:20:16] and act and dress like women
[2:20:18] no no one doubts surely you that know me
[2:20:21] no I you I believe in separation of
[2:20:24] gender and I believe in in Holiness but
[2:20:27] but I want you to know it's it's not the
[2:20:29] dead letter of anybody's written record
[2:20:31] that's going to do anything it's that
[2:20:33] living reality of the word when it comes
[2:20:36] in the Holy Spirit quickens the word it
[2:20:38] becomes active and operative and
[2:20:40] energizing and most of all
[2:20:45] say it again
[2:20:47] effective it is sharper than any
[2:20:49] two-edged sword penetrating to the
[2:20:51] dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul
[2:20:53] and the immortal spirit and of joints
[2:20:56] and Marrow of the deepest parts of our
[2:20:57] nature exposing come on word come on
[2:21:00] Living Word of God expose me
[2:21:03] expose every part of me that is not like
[2:21:08] him
[2:21:09] [Applause]
[2:21:13] but if you get embarrassed so be it
[2:21:16] it won't be the first time I've ever
[2:21:18] been embarrassed how about you
[2:21:20] see I'm not playing with this word
[2:21:23] this is not what I do on Sunday
[2:21:26] my fellowship with the word is every day
[2:21:28] of my life and has been for nearly the
[2:21:31] past 50 years
[2:21:33] I want to Fellowship that word every day
[2:21:36] I want him to go down into the into the
[2:21:38] inside of the inside of the inside of
[2:21:41] the inside and if he finds jealousy
[2:21:43] there I want him to expose it
[2:21:45] and rip it out by the roots
[2:21:49] if there's ambition or competition in me
[2:21:53] I want it out
[2:21:54] [Music]
[2:21:58] it's the only way to be perfect in rest
[2:22:01] you see we rest when we realize that
[2:22:05] he's working
[2:22:07] all I have to do is cooperate
[2:22:09] now on the base level I'll have to do is
[2:22:12] say Amen
[2:22:16] it's the power of agreement
[2:22:19] my job is to say Amen
[2:22:22] it's not just lip service
[2:22:24] but my job is to come into agreement
[2:22:26] with that word amen
[2:22:27] amen amen and then let my life it won't
[2:22:32] just happen automatic but I have to
[2:22:33] lasso my life
[2:22:38] every thought that exalts itself I got
[2:22:40] to pull it down
[2:22:42] come on
[2:22:43] and I've got a lasso my life in such a
[2:22:46] way that I pull it back into the
[2:22:47] restraints
[2:22:48] of God's word
[2:22:51] because you can't hide from the word
[2:22:53] you can hide from the church you can
[2:22:54] hide from your preacher you can hide
[2:22:56] from your wife you can hide from your
[2:22:57] husband your boyfriend your girlfriend
[2:22:59] your parents
[2:23:01] you can hide from your siblings
[2:23:03] but you can hide from the word
[2:23:07] well that oh that makes me scared no no
[2:23:10] no it's not that kind of a fear you're
[2:23:12] not fearing the hammer that's going to
[2:23:13] crush your head remember he didn't come
[2:23:15] to destroy you he come to put your
[2:23:17] clothes on
[2:23:19] don't you know he could have killed Adam
[2:23:21] and Eve but he's a redeemer by Nature
[2:23:26] he didn't see a mistake he didn't see a
[2:23:29] failure he saw a plan whoa
[2:23:36] when he saw what Eve did as vile as it
[2:23:39] was
[2:23:39] when he saw what Adam did as vile as it
[2:23:43] was
[2:23:43] he didn't desire to destroy them
[2:23:47] he actually said
[2:23:52] now I can do what a purpose to do from
[2:23:54] the beginning
[2:23:55] tell me brother sister when was the lamb
[2:23:58] slain when was the lamb slain
[2:24:03] when was the lamb slain
[2:24:06] when Eve sinned
[2:24:09] when Adam sinned
[2:24:12] at Calvary
[2:24:16] when was the lamb slain
[2:24:19] John had to be caught up out of the
[2:24:21] nature of the flesh into the nature of
[2:24:22] the spirit he said I saw the Lord I was
[2:24:24] caught up on the Lord's Day
[2:24:28] Jews argue that it's the Sabbath
[2:24:30] Christians argue that it's Sunday and
[2:24:32] the whole church misses it it was
[2:24:33] neither
[2:24:34] it wasn't a Friday or a Sunday was it a
[2:24:37] Saturday or a Sunday had nothing to do
[2:24:39] with the day of the week I was caught up
[2:24:41] to see the Lord's day he saw this hour
[2:24:44] he saw the day that the sons of God
[2:24:46] would rise he saw the day that Sons
[2:24:48] would come to manifestation that's what
[2:24:51] he saw he saw a bride in the last days
[2:24:53] who would come out of pagan Christianity
[2:24:55] and serve the god of the Bible that's
[2:24:58] what he saw he saw a people that would
[2:25:00] win the rest
[2:25:01] they would win the rest
[2:25:03] they'd Win It
[2:25:05] not because they sat out and waited on
[2:25:07] the charge to give it to them but
[2:25:10] because they actively pursued it with
[2:25:13] passion with zealousness I must find
[2:25:17] this place of rest
[2:25:19] and I'm going to labor I'm going to
[2:25:20] sweat until I get to this place of rest
[2:25:23] I'm gonna and then when I get there I'm
[2:25:25] going to fight to stay there
[2:25:27] because it's not carnal striving we're
[2:25:29] talking about
[2:25:30] let me let me talk to you a minute I
[2:25:32] gotta I gotta say this
[2:25:36] has your
[2:25:37] bottom endured
[2:25:39] so much that your mind can't comprehend
[2:25:41] anymore can I have a few more minutes
[2:25:46] go down there to Jr's Steakhouse
[2:25:48] sometime I don't go often
[2:25:51] but go down there sometime and
[2:25:54] Chad there's a
[2:25:56] I don't even remember what it is son
[2:25:57] what is what did they name after Albert
[2:25:59] Ward
[2:26:01] a burger
[2:26:04] Reverend Albert Ward was an Assembly of
[2:26:07] God Pastor I knew all my life
[2:26:10] and asked his wife his wife died many
[2:26:12] years ago precious sweet lady uh brother
[2:26:15] Ward would go down to Jr's every day
[2:26:19] I was never in there that he wasn't in
[2:26:21] there and I have to be honest sometime I
[2:26:23] dug my head
[2:26:25] because he was a talker
[2:26:27] and he didn't understand lunch hour
[2:26:31] I'm in and out
[2:26:33] it was like
[2:26:35] he spent his day at Jr's so much so late
[2:26:38] so you go down there and see his name on
[2:26:40] the menu and remember that he's the one
[2:26:42] that got me when I was a little boy
[2:26:44] preacher
[2:26:46] put his arm around me I must have been
[2:26:48] about 12. and he put his arm around me
[2:26:50] he said little Stevie
[2:26:54] I need to tell you something I was
[2:26:56] preaching for him I remember the sermon
[2:26:58] can you imagine I was preaching on Noah
[2:27:00] at the Auburn Road Assembly of God
[2:27:02] Church because that's where the word was
[2:27:04] pastoring then little Stevie that was
[2:27:07] magnificent
[2:27:10] absolutely extraordinary
[2:27:14] but I need to tell you something
[2:27:17] hear me well and don't ever forget what
[2:27:19] I tell you
[2:27:21] the mind will only comprehend
[2:27:24] what the seat will endure
[2:27:35] that's why I was asking you about your
[2:27:37] seat
[2:27:44] it's not carnal striving
[2:27:47] fleshly striving that we do to come into
[2:27:51] rest
[2:27:53] it's Faith work
[2:27:54] say with me Faith work it's Faith work
[2:27:58] that's what it is
[2:28:00] it's not carnal striving here's carnal
[2:28:02] striving
[2:28:04] you've got to read the Bible through in
[2:28:07] one year
[2:28:08] that's carnal striving
[2:28:11] it's a good idea
[2:28:12] It's a Wonderful blessing you'll be
[2:28:15] blessed if you do it it'll strengthen
[2:28:17] you in the faith
[2:28:20] but don't put that on me
[2:28:23] I'm not gonna put that on you
[2:28:26] that's carnal striving
[2:28:29] that's trying to make people think that
[2:28:31] the more you read the more you get
[2:28:34] you can read it all and get nothing if
[2:28:37] you don't cooperate with the spirit
[2:28:40] it's just information
[2:28:42] are you calling the Bible information
[2:28:44] I'm telling you that the Bible will be
[2:28:46] no more to you
[2:28:48] than than information without the
[2:28:51] Grease
[2:28:53] without revelation
[2:28:56] without Revelation go to Cain and Abel
[2:28:59] [Music]
[2:29:01] it's time to give God an offering what
[2:29:04] did Cain do he goes out and gets
[2:29:06] rutabagers
[2:29:07] I'm paraphrasing
[2:29:09] the Bible didn't say rutabagas but I
[2:29:10] don't like them and it'd be very easy
[2:29:12] for me to give them away
[2:29:14] rutabagas brussels sprouts
[2:29:21] the Bible said he took the fruit of the
[2:29:23] ground
[2:29:24] and he was going to go lay that on the
[2:29:25] altar
[2:29:26] he didn't have a revelation he had
[2:29:28] religion
[2:29:31] he had a seed of discrepancy growing in
[2:29:33] him
[2:29:34] and he had a lot of religion and he
[2:29:37] thought I'll give God the best turnips I
[2:29:39] have the best tomatoes the best potatoes
[2:29:40] the best peas I'll go lay them on the
[2:29:43] Altar and God will be so pleased with me
[2:29:44] he'll say I'm the best Gardener there's
[2:29:46] ever been
[2:29:47] striving carnal striving religious
[2:29:49] striving I got to pray more got to read
[2:29:52] more got to do more got to go more got
[2:29:54] to be more
[2:29:57] I know I know I know people resist this
[2:29:59] I know you're PR you preach the message
[2:30:02] Believers and they can't even receive
[2:30:03] the Simplicity of what I'm saying right
[2:30:06] now because we are programmed by a
[2:30:09] church system
[2:30:11] gotta make one more trip gotta buy one
[2:30:14] more ticket gotta go to one more
[2:30:16] gotta go to one more convention gotta go
[2:30:18] to one more meeting gotta go to one
[2:30:22] and you can do all of that and be lost
[2:30:27] I gotta go to this conference in that
[2:30:29] conference and then and the other
[2:30:30] conference and I got on and on and on
[2:30:33] and on it goes
[2:30:34] that's not the kind of Labor that's
[2:30:36] going to bring you to the rest
[2:30:39] it's a faith work
[2:30:42] now should we read more yes brother bam
[2:30:45] tells us we should the prophet tells it
[2:30:46] he he said you could you could do a lot
[2:30:48] of things too much if you've never
[2:30:49] prayed too much we ought to pray more
[2:30:51] I'm telling you right now I can say that
[2:30:53] to everybody in this room I believe it
[2:30:55] always applies excuse me we can pray
[2:30:57] more
[2:30:58] we can pray more we should pray more we
[2:31:01] should miss a meal we should fast we
[2:31:04] should take this opportunity to set
[2:31:06] ourselves aside and draw close to the
[2:31:08] Lord but if you do that thinking that
[2:31:10] that alone is going to bring you to that
[2:31:13] place of rest in him
[2:31:15] you're going to get to the end of your
[2:31:16] fasting the end of your praying the end
[2:31:18] of your Bible reading still be bound
[2:31:22] come on
[2:31:24] some of my ameners are quiet
[2:31:28] and miserable
[2:31:29] until you understand that it's a faith
[2:31:31] work
[2:31:32] it was the lack of faith
[2:31:34] it was a lack of faith that caused the
[2:31:36] children of Israel not to enter the
[2:31:37] promise
[2:31:39] shall I read that to you
[2:31:41] we probably need to go on so that we can
[2:31:43] bring this to a landing here after a
[2:31:45] while
[2:31:53] don't we go to Hebrews 3 just a moment
[2:31:58] I don't want to skip too much
[2:32:01] but I want us to go to Hebrews 3 chapter
[2:32:03] 8 excuse me verse 8.
[2:32:09] I hope I'm not getting too far ahead
[2:32:15] Harden not your hearts
[2:32:18] hmm
[2:32:21] I don't like that kind of preaching it
[2:32:23] doesn't matter to me
[2:32:24] whether you like it or not
[2:32:26] but you got to keep your heart soft
[2:32:30] because if we let something Harden our
[2:32:32] heart
[2:32:33] and we can't hear God when he talks to
[2:32:35] us
[2:32:36] Harden not your hearts as in the
[2:32:37] provocation in the day of Temptation in
[2:32:41] the wilderness when your fathers tempted
[2:32:43] me proved me
[2:32:45] and saw my works
[2:32:48] hello
[2:32:50] 40 years
[2:32:51] the complete Jewish Bible that is
[2:32:54] translated by a friend of mine Dr David
[2:32:56] Stern of blessed memory
[2:32:59] he took that provocation from Hebrew I
[2:33:03] mean from Greek with a Hebrew mindset
[2:33:06] and called it the bitter quarrel
[2:33:09] it was a quarrel going on
[2:33:12] between the children of Israel and their
[2:33:14] God
[2:33:15] wherefore I was grieved with that
[2:33:17] generation and said they do always air
[2:33:22] in their heart
[2:33:25] not in their deeds
[2:33:27] your Deeds are the Overflow your words
[2:33:30] are the Overflow of your heart
[2:33:32] they do air in their heart are you still
[2:33:34] here
[2:33:35] and they have not what
[2:33:38] oh they knew the law
[2:33:42] it had been laid out for them they knew
[2:33:44] the rules
[2:33:47] but they didn't know the Lord
[2:33:50] they didn't know his ways you've got to
[2:33:53] make sure in all of your knowing
[2:33:55] that you learn to know the Lord
[2:33:59] it's more than knowing the rules it's
[2:34:00] more than knowing the original languages
[2:34:03] it's more than knowing sacred names
[2:34:07] you've got to know his ways
[2:34:10] and once you discover his ways you'll
[2:34:12] never doubt him again I'm telling you
[2:34:13] once you see the Lord's track record
[2:34:17] once your eyes are opened and and that
[2:34:20] that faithful God is revealed to you you
[2:34:23] won't struggle with trusting him anymore
[2:34:24] that'll be some rest on you on it how
[2:34:27] many of you want that rest I want my
[2:34:30] trust issues dealt with I want to be
[2:34:31] able to trust him and know that he
[2:34:34] always is out for my good
[2:34:37] Ness and if he requires anything of me
[2:34:39] he provides what I need to be obedient
[2:34:43] Grace Grace is provided for you and I so
[2:34:47] that we can be obedient to what God
[2:34:50] requires he's not asking anything from
[2:34:52] you and I that he doesn't give us
[2:34:54] so that we can offer it up that's the
[2:34:56] word
[2:34:57] that's the word
[2:34:59] wherefore I was grieved with that
[2:35:01] generation and said they do always air
[2:35:03] in their heart and they have not known
[2:35:05] my ways so I swear in my wrath
[2:35:09] they shall not enter into my rest
[2:35:15] 40 Years of carnal struggle
[2:35:21] they are close enough to the promised
[2:35:24] land to smell the grapes
[2:35:28] and God said you will not go in
[2:35:36] so I swear in my wrath they shall not
[2:35:39] enter into my rest take heed brethren
[2:35:43] now remember they are our examples First
[2:35:46] Corinthians chapter 10 Paul tells us we
[2:35:49] have this record because they are our
[2:35:51] example and I want everyone to take this
[2:35:53] warning very serious before we get ready
[2:35:55] to go and we're we're coming to a close
[2:35:58] take heed brethren
[2:36:00] lest there be any of you in an evil
[2:36:04] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[2:36:06] Living God
[2:36:10] but exhort one another daily
[2:36:13] while it is called today
[2:36:16] lest any of you be hardened through the
[2:36:18] deceitfulness of sin for We Are Made
[2:36:22] come on
[2:36:23] we are made
[2:36:26] partakers of Christ
[2:36:30] what good news
[2:36:32] if
[2:36:37] it's a tiny word isn't it
[2:36:39] but it's got a big impact in this verse
[2:36:41] if
[2:36:43] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[2:36:48] steadfast
[2:36:49] until the end
[2:36:52] it is vitally vitally vitally important
[2:36:58] that we hold our confidence through the
[2:37:00] trial through the heartache through the
[2:37:02] misunderstanding come on
[2:37:04] now I want you to go to Hebrews 4 2 in
[2:37:06] closing
[2:37:08] this is our job this is our
[2:37:10] responsibility and I won't have time to
[2:37:12] lay it out for you but I can at least
[2:37:13] read it to you
[2:37:15] this is our responsibility for unto us
[2:37:18] was the Gospel the good news preached as
[2:37:22] well as unto them
[2:37:25] but the word preached did not profit
[2:37:29] them
[2:37:34] not because they didn't try to obey it
[2:37:38] they tried to obey it
[2:37:40] they tried to keep the Commandments
[2:37:43] they tried to do what was right
[2:37:46] they tried
[2:37:47] they strive they strove they worked they
[2:37:51] labored
[2:37:52] but the word preached did not profit
[2:37:54] them and here's why not being
[2:38:01] it's a faith work
[2:38:04] it's more important than anything you
[2:38:07] can offer God today
[2:38:09] is your faith
[2:38:10] somebody said I I I I I just don't have
[2:38:13] you do have faith the Bible said you
[2:38:15] have faith to every man is given a
[2:38:17] Measure of Faith you have faith
[2:38:20] and your faith will grow if you use it
[2:38:23] but if you keep it
[2:38:25] and you don't invest it
[2:38:29] not being mixed with faith in them that
[2:38:31] did what
[2:38:32] that heard it
[2:38:35] all the children of Israel heard the
[2:38:37] same prophet
[2:38:39] what was his name Moses all the children
[2:38:42] of Israel heard the same Prophet Moses
[2:38:46] Moses was God's mouthpiece
[2:38:49] Moses had such a holy and perfect
[2:38:51] ministry that the ministry of the Lord
[2:38:53] Jesus Christ is compared in the New
[2:38:56] Testament to the gospel Ministry to the
[2:38:58] ministry of Moses there will be a
[2:39:00] prophet that God will sin like unto
[2:39:02] Moses and that Prophet ended up being
[2:39:04] the Messiah
[2:39:05] so if you want to know what God thought
[2:39:07] about Moshe here's what he thought about
[2:39:09] him he thought that his life and
[2:39:11] Ministry was a beautiful type
[2:39:15] of God in flesh who would come down one
[2:39:18] day in our messiah in our savior the
[2:39:21] Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua
[2:39:25] they all heard Moses
[2:39:28] and they heard the instruction
[2:39:30] and they heard the Commandments and they
[2:39:33] heard the law and they all tried with
[2:39:36] different various degrees of effort
[2:39:39] to keep
[2:39:41] what Moses had to say
[2:39:45] but the problem was many people put
[2:39:48] their trust in the law
[2:39:51] that means instruction by the way not
[2:39:54] rules and regulations the word law in
[2:39:57] scripture is instruction
[2:40:00] they put their confidence in the
[2:40:02] instruction
[2:40:03] instead of the end results
[2:40:06] the end results was to bring them to the
[2:40:08] promised land
[2:40:09] God wanted to give them Canaan
[2:40:12] he wanted to snatch it out from the
[2:40:14] hands of the wicked Pagan hoodlums that
[2:40:18] possessed the promise and wanted to give
[2:40:20] it to his children
[2:40:22] but you can't put your confidence in the
[2:40:24] instructions only
[2:40:28] people arguing about them
[2:40:31] now let me bring that up to some of you
[2:40:33] and I who have had a revelation that God
[2:40:35] sent an end time prophet
[2:40:38] that Prophet was a surrendered vessel to
[2:40:41] the Lord and we love love the ministry
[2:40:43] that God has used to help us get to
[2:40:46] where we are today I I hope that some of
[2:40:48] you appreciate my Ministry
[2:40:51] I'm not asking for amens I'm just saying
[2:40:54] it's only it's only automatic if it
[2:40:56] really is just who we are when somebody
[2:40:58] helps us on the way we love them and
[2:41:01] respect them and no one could have love
[2:41:03] and respect any more than I do for
[2:41:04] brother Branham
[2:41:05] but he was not infallible
[2:41:09] and he was not inerrant
[2:41:16] and so you can know all the quotes
[2:41:19] just like the Israelites knew all the
[2:41:22] instructions
[2:41:24] and still not go into the promised land
[2:41:26] because you didn't do your work
[2:41:29] your work wasn't just memorizing the
[2:41:31] quotes
[2:41:33] and running around the sign
[2:41:37] did you hear what Pastor Tate is going
[2:41:39] to get quiet here for a moment
[2:41:42] but did you hear what Pastor Tay said to
[2:41:44] us last Sunday he he said the key
[2:41:48] to the double portion anointing for
[2:41:50] Elisha was being able to recognize the
[2:41:53] homegoing
[2:41:55] of the Prophet Elijah
[2:41:58] he said if you can see me when I go
[2:42:01] what a silly thing to say
[2:42:04] my goodness Elisha couldn't even spend
[2:42:06] time in the outhouse
[2:42:09] because he knew that his key
[2:42:12] to having the mantle
[2:42:15] to having a portion of what Elijah had
[2:42:17] was he can't leave here without me
[2:42:20] seeing his departure I've got to see him
[2:42:24] leave
[2:42:25] I must recognize his leaving
[2:42:31] it's the same instruction given to us
[2:42:34] there in the Old Testament Moses my
[2:42:37] servant is dead
[2:42:41] in order for the children of Israel to
[2:42:43] follow their Joshua
[2:42:45] they had to recognize the ultimate
[2:42:48] Earthly demise
[2:42:51] of their Prophet Moses
[2:42:53] they had to see that he did what God
[2:42:55] called him to do and he finished the
[2:42:58] work
[2:43:01] he himself did not get to go into the
[2:43:04] Promised Land
[2:43:05] because he allowed the people to provoke
[2:43:07] him to anger when God said it's time to
[2:43:10] speak now it's not time to keep beating
[2:43:12] the rock you remember time to talk to
[2:43:15] The Rock Church I'm telling you it's
[2:43:17] time to talk to the Rock
[2:43:19] it's not time to go back and beat it all
[2:43:22] over again it's time to realize and
[2:43:24] recognize what you are
[2:43:27] so that you take a thought are you with
[2:43:28] me
[2:43:29] oh
[2:43:33] you see God sins prophets like Moses
[2:43:37] he sent to our generation a prophet
[2:43:40] voice
[2:43:41] a sign
[2:43:43] as promised
[2:43:45] it was it was to happen in the last days
[2:43:48] John the Baptist only fulfilling a
[2:43:50] portion of Malachi's prophecy there had
[2:43:52] to be another fulfillment of that
[2:43:56] because now the children's Hearts have
[2:43:58] to be turned back
[2:44:01] Jesus tells us you're right
[2:44:05] John the Baptist
[2:44:07] he did and and and his
[2:44:10] in other words yes there's a portion of
[2:44:12] that but there's something else you
[2:44:13] better not miss it here
[2:44:15] and we have seen it by the grace of God
[2:44:17] thank you Jesus
[2:44:19] but here's the problem with a sign
[2:44:22] when you're driving down these County
[2:44:24] Roads
[2:44:26] and you see a stop sign what do you do
[2:44:32] well you've got to slow down sure and
[2:44:35] then you stop
[2:44:37] let's say that together stop
[2:44:40] s t o p does it mean yield
[2:44:46] as sister Joyce was seemingly indicating
[2:44:50] no she wouldn't do that
[2:44:56] and where do we stop let me help you you
[2:44:58] need this I've watched some of you drive
[2:45:04] you don't stop in the middle of the
[2:45:05] intersection and say I stopped
[2:45:08] you stopped behind the white line
[2:45:11] you can't have the whole half into your
[2:45:13] car out there in the road for me to come
[2:45:14] by and take it off
[2:45:17] because I'm trusting you to stop
[2:45:20] if you're the one that's got the stop
[2:45:22] sign
[2:45:23] stop signs are important when God sends
[2:45:25] a sign it's important you believe God's
[2:45:27] still sending signs today I actually do
[2:45:30] I actually do I believe he's still
[2:45:32] sending signs today and when we see a
[2:45:34] sign especially of such importance and
[2:45:36] significance as the ministry of a
[2:45:38] prophet
[2:45:39] we certainly need to do what the sign
[2:45:41] says
[2:45:43] stop
[2:45:44] and Look Away to Jesus
[2:45:50] that was his ministry
[2:45:53] little bride
[2:45:54] I want you to see him
[2:45:59] he couldn't have a different commission
[2:46:00] than John the Baptist had to be the same
[2:46:02] kind of commission
[2:46:03] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[2:46:06] right
[2:46:08] and how did John come to the end of his
[2:46:10] Commission
[2:46:11] I must decrease
[2:46:14] he must increase how did Elijah come to
[2:46:17] the end of his commission if you see me
[2:46:20] when I go
[2:46:24] do you understand why that was important
[2:46:26] it was important because if they didn't
[2:46:28] see him called away somebody would
[2:46:31] believe that he would come back
[2:46:34] and continue his ministry
[2:46:37] they'd say he's just up in the woods
[2:46:39] there communing with the angels
[2:46:41] it was very important for Elisha to see
[2:46:44] him leave because that left no room for
[2:46:47] a return Ministry of Elijah you see I
[2:46:50] believe in return Ministry I believe
[2:46:52] that Elijah's return Ministry was Elisha
[2:46:59] anybody following me through my coded
[2:47:01] messages
[2:47:04] I do believe in return I believe that
[2:47:06] Elisha had just that a double portion
[2:47:11] of what Elijah had
[2:47:13] and I believe in a return Ministry today
[2:47:15] I believe the return Ministry of that
[2:47:17] Prophet is the bride yes sorry
[2:47:21] and I believe the trail is being written
[2:47:24] again
[2:47:27] but not by a single Indian chief
[2:47:30] this time it is being run it's a race
[2:47:33] that's being run by a people who will
[2:47:36] enter into the rest
[2:47:38] they will enter into the rest because
[2:47:42] they have learned that it's a faith work
[2:47:45] my my
[2:47:47] responsibility in this is not to fight
[2:47:50] about the quote and fight about the
[2:47:52] instruction my responsibility is to put
[2:47:55] my faith in that word because if I put
[2:47:58] my faith in the word that I hear I
[2:48:00] activate it in my life remember I told
[2:48:02] you you control
[2:48:04] the effectiveness of the word in your
[2:48:05] life it's your responsibility to say and
[2:48:08] I would do it if I were you before every
[2:48:10] service
[2:48:12] I'd say now Lord I'm here today to hear
[2:48:14] your word
[2:48:16] and I'm not here to hear it so that I
[2:48:18] can amen when somebody else needs it
[2:48:20] I'm here to aband my need
[2:48:23] I ain't gonna drop them amen bombs that
[2:48:25] we hear sometime and sometimes we joke
[2:48:27] about it
[2:48:28] when you know somebody else's toes are
[2:48:31] getting stepped on and you go
[2:48:33] amen
[2:48:34] because you really want them to hear it
[2:48:37] when you do that you're really making a
[2:48:39] mistake because you're shoveling the
[2:48:40] word that you may need in your own life
[2:48:43] so it's not just the verbal amen we're
[2:48:45] looking for it's the amen with the
[2:48:46] surrendered life
[2:48:48] and here's a problem that so many of my
[2:48:50] brethren have made they've made this
[2:48:51] terrible mistake they they they
[2:48:53] understood
[2:48:55] partially that every sign has a voice
[2:48:59] it does
[2:49:03] every sign that God sends talks
[2:49:06] it has a message it has something that
[2:49:09] God wants to say to us and so many jump
[2:49:12] out of their cars
[2:49:14] I better not see you doing this
[2:49:16] you're going to get run over
[2:49:18] you don't come to the stop sign and open
[2:49:20] up the door of your car and go run
[2:49:22] around the stop sign say oh stop signing
[2:49:25] stop sign the stop sign I know what that
[2:49:27] means a stop sign
[2:49:28] well yeah you stopped
[2:49:32] but you're focused on the sign
[2:49:34] and you probably failed to hear the
[2:49:36] voice because the sign came to cause us
[2:49:40] to stop
[2:49:43] and
[2:49:44] get still before the Lord so that we
[2:49:47] could hear the voice the voice of the
[2:49:49] sign said go all the way in my word keep
[2:49:53] your eyes on Jesus Christ he keeps all
[2:49:55] of his appointments come on look away to
[2:49:58] him
[2:49:58] the voice said you can have it all you
[2:50:01] can walk in the fullness of every bit of
[2:50:03] it but don't you be like that other
[2:50:06] generation who died after the
[2:50:08] provocation
[2:50:09] tempted me in the wilderness because
[2:50:12] they learned the quotes and they learned
[2:50:14] the instructions
[2:50:15] but they failed to do the faith work
[2:50:18] every service every service every time
[2:50:20] we read the Bible every time we hear a
[2:50:23] sermon on tape or on the app or wherever
[2:50:25] you hear your sermons we ought to take
[2:50:27] just a moment to say Lord let your word
[2:50:31] speak to my life today and I I already
[2:50:36] pull my faith up I pull it up right now
[2:50:39] and when I hear that word I'm going to
[2:50:42] attach my faith to that word
[2:50:46] I'm going to say Amen with my mouth I'm
[2:50:48] going to say Amen with my life because
[2:50:51] it's the only way
[2:50:52] that the word can be profitable and
[2:50:54] effective in me
[2:50:56] is for me to put my faith work in
[2:50:59] hello
[2:51:00] let's stand musicians are coming
[2:51:15] Moses
[2:51:17] was not inerrant or infallible
[2:51:24] to be that
[2:51:26] would have made him a perfect man
[2:51:30] there was only one
[2:51:34] he was emotional
[2:51:37] he made mistakes
[2:51:40] but when he spoke In The Name Of The
[2:51:43] Lord
[2:51:46] it was so
[2:51:48] and when the people added their faith
[2:51:51] to that word
[2:51:54] there was a generation that inherited
[2:51:56] the promised land do you remember
[2:51:58] but it was not the generation
[2:52:01] that originally heard the prophet
[2:52:04] it was their children
[2:52:07] the Bible said most of those who heard
[2:52:09] Moses died in the wilderness their
[2:52:11] carcasses bleaching and I'm just quoting
[2:52:13] the scripture their carcass is bleaching
[2:52:15] in the sun they they weren't lost
[2:52:19] God had a plan for them just like God
[2:52:21] has planned for people today
[2:52:23] don't worry about that
[2:52:26] Moses didn't go into the promised land
[2:52:27] either
[2:52:33] oh
[2:52:40] but there was another generation
[2:52:44] first of all let's say there was
[2:52:47] a Joshua and a Caleb
[2:52:54] you you feel it's all right
[2:53:00] did anybody turn red if they didn't I
[2:53:02] didn't succeed
[2:53:04] is that red
[2:53:06] oh he's getting a little pink
[2:53:12] there was a generation that missed out
[2:53:15] but how many of you know there was a
[2:53:17] generation who said we're going in
[2:53:24] 10 come back and had lots of gripes
[2:53:28] two come back with grapes
[2:53:31] and they said we can do this we can do
[2:53:33] this I know there are giants in the land
[2:53:35] but we can do this
[2:53:37] some said well we're just like little
[2:53:39] grasshoppers in their side and we'll
[2:53:41] never be able to take this land and
[2:53:42] we'll never get in we'll never bid to
[2:53:44] make it we'll never find the rest and
[2:53:46] we'll never inherit the promise because
[2:53:47] nobody told us we're going to have to
[2:53:49] put Giants out of the land in order to
[2:53:51] get in and get it
[2:53:52] maybe they didn't feel like the prophet
[2:53:54] gave them full disclosure but I'm
[2:53:56] telling you that if you get to the rest
[2:53:58] it's going to cost you something
[2:54:00] if you find that place of rest and
[2:54:02] confidence and Trust in his word so that
[2:54:05] you don't have to get shook up every
[2:54:06] time life throws you a wrench
[2:54:09] if you come to that and the bride is
[2:54:11] coming to that we're coming to a place
[2:54:13] of complete trust and confidence in the
[2:54:15] word
[2:54:16] and the word is going to help us out of
[2:54:18] every mess we're in
[2:54:20] that's why he sent the word he sent the
[2:54:22] word to heal us he sent the word to
[2:54:24] deliver us he sent the word to perfect
[2:54:25] us he sent the word to complete us and
[2:54:29] the word is going to take us over
[2:54:31] well we've got to put our faith work in
[2:54:35] we got to say that's my promise that's
[2:54:37] my I'm believing that I'm putting my
[2:54:39] confidence in that
[2:54:41] if you haven't started your faith
[2:54:43] Journey get on it
[2:54:44] because you can know a lot about the
[2:54:46] book
[2:54:48] but you've got to know the author
[2:54:50] you can know a lot about Christianity
[2:54:52] but you've got to know the Savior you've
[2:54:54] got to know the Messiah you've got to
[2:54:56] know the ways of God and here's the
[2:54:58] thing he's not over in the bushes hiding
[2:54:59] from you he wants to reveal himself
[2:55:03] oh if you're hungry to know him he's
[2:55:05] hungry to reveal himself to you he's got
[2:55:08] all the grease you need
[2:55:11] to unmat your eyes
[2:55:14] you can see him oh he's lovely to look
[2:55:16] upon he's beautiful to look upon do you
[2:55:19] believe that
[2:55:20] Benjamin come and lead us in a song of
[2:55:22] worship I want us to worship before we

[3:02:14] if he has you can deal with it now
[3:02:18] you don't have to carry that doubt any
[3:02:20] longer
[3:02:21] you can be like the little man in the
[3:02:23] ministry of Jesus who said Lord I
[3:02:24] believe help thou my unbelief
[3:02:27] my faith is not perfect but it's active
[3:02:31] tell him it's not perfect but it's
[3:02:33] active

[3:02:37] believe that you're going to fail me in
[3:02:38] anything in my life you've now I trust
[3:02:41] you I trust you there are times when I
[3:02:44] can't see clearly and I get scared
[3:02:48] but Lord I trust you
[3:02:52] remember that's not just the lip service
[3:02:55] but that's Surrender Your Life
[3:02:57] your will it's it's saying Lord I want
[3:02:59] to obey your word
[3:03:01] I want to serve you I want to go all the
[3:03:03] way with you
[3:03:04] if you're here let's just bow our heads
[3:03:07] for just a moment and if you're here and
[3:03:09] you would say I I want to trust him I
[3:03:12] want to surrender everything that I am
[3:03:16] to him and and I confess that there are
[3:03:19] times I get a little afraid
[3:03:21] fear Creeps in and and the way it gets a
[3:03:25] little blurry and I feel a little unsure
[3:03:29] my faith is not perfect but it's active
[3:03:33] if you feel that way I want you just to
[3:03:34] slip up your hand you can put it right
[3:03:36] back down
[3:03:37] God bless every hand in this building
[3:03:39] you weren't raising it to me you're
[3:03:42] raising it for him to see
[3:03:44] and can I tell you that he's not angry
[3:03:46] with you
[3:03:48] he's not angry with you because your
[3:03:50] faith is not perfect
[3:03:53] he's not angry with you for those times
[3:03:56] that that you wasted a service
[3:04:00] he's not angry with you but he's calling
[3:04:02] you to repentance
[3:04:04] he's calling you to accountability today
[3:04:07] and he's not doing it in Anger he's
[3:04:09] doing it in love he's saying I want you
[3:04:11] to step forward in faith
[3:04:13] I want you to move up in your faith and
[3:04:15] I want you to ask me
[3:04:18] he's really waiting at times on us to
[3:04:22] say Lord I can't see the way but I'm
[3:04:24] going to hold on to you
[3:04:28] I can't see the end
[3:04:30] there's there's some big uncertainties
[3:04:33] facing me right now
[3:04:35] but I I've got my my heart on you and my
[3:04:40] faith is on you let me pray with you
[3:04:41] right now as they just play that let me
[3:04:43] pray with every person who raised your
[3:04:46] hand father in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:04:48] Yeshua our Messiah we come today you saw
[3:04:52] every hand
[3:04:54] there's no one joining the church
[3:04:57] [Music]
[3:04:58] we're past that
[3:05:01] we're just raising our hands today to
[3:05:04] say there are times I get afraid
[3:05:07] but my faith is in you
[3:05:10] Lord you heard us confess that our faith
[3:05:13] is not perfect but you're perfect
[3:05:15] so our faith is in a perfect god with a
[3:05:18] perfect track record
[3:05:20] you have never failed us and we ask
[3:05:23] right now that your grace all the grace
[3:05:26] that you have deposited in our Grace
[3:05:28] account we draw on that right now do you
[3:05:31] need his grace
[3:05:33] if you're facing something and you need
[3:05:35] to make a withdrawal do that right now
[3:05:37] Lord I Need Your Grace
[3:05:40] I need Grace for where I am in the
[3:05:43] journey I need Grace to walk through
[3:05:45] what I'm walking through right now I
[3:05:48] have relationships that I need Grace in
[3:05:52] I have circumstances that I need Grace
[3:05:55] in I have doubts and uncertainties that
[3:05:58] I need your grace to show up on my
[3:06:01] behalf
[3:06:02] and so Lord I don't leave this place
[3:06:05] bitter
[3:06:06] and I don't leave her angry
[3:06:09] I leave here dependent
[3:06:12] I depend on you
[3:06:15] Lord we as a people
[3:06:18] depend on your grace
[3:06:21] we depend on the way of Escape that
[3:06:25] you're building for us
[3:06:27] we depend on your sovereignty
[3:06:30] and we cling to your goodness
[3:06:35] we heard the brother say last night
[3:06:38] the first time he heard the song the
[3:06:39] goodness of God the goodness running
[3:06:41] after me he heard his children singing
[3:06:44] he said what are you singing I don't
[3:06:46] understand that and he said all of a
[3:06:48] sudden it dawned on him that the Bible
[3:06:51] said surely goodness and mercy would
[3:06:53] follow me all the days of my life and he
[3:06:57] began to sing at the song to your
[3:06:59] goodness is running after me your
[3:07:01] goodness is running after me your
[3:07:03] goodness is running after me Lord even
[3:07:06] when it doesn't look like it we want to
[3:07:08] thank you today that your goodness is
[3:07:10] always pursuing us
[3:07:12] and mercy is in our corner
[3:07:15] and Grace is chasing after us
[3:07:19] and we commit right now to to to putting
[3:07:23] our faith in this thing to invest
[3:07:27] no matter who's preaching
[3:07:29] we come to put our faith in
[3:07:32] because we know that activates your word
[3:07:34] in our life would you help us forgive us
[3:07:38] for the times that we've let a whole
[3:07:40] sermon go by and we've never put any
[3:07:42] faith in
[3:07:44] we're going to be more mindful Lord if
[3:07:46] you help us
[3:07:47] to deposit our faith we're going to
[3:07:49] start doing it on the way over here
[3:07:52] we're going to start doing it on the way
[3:07:54] over here we're going to start letting
[3:07:55] you know Lord I bring in my faith with
[3:07:57] me today
[3:07:58] I intend to see the word work in my life
[3:08:01] I intend to see the work change me from
[3:08:04] glory to glory and strength to strength
[3:08:06] and Faith to Faith I Surrender right now
[3:08:09] uh no one is looking this way just yet
[3:08:13] [Music]
[3:08:15] but I'd like to ask you are you here and
[3:08:18] sometimes you just feel like that the
[3:08:21] Lord is just angry with you he just must
[3:08:23] be really upset with you put your hand
[3:08:25] down
[3:08:27] more hands than I expected I don't know
[3:08:30] what in the world
[3:08:32] would give us that impression
[3:08:34] perhaps we're basing it on our
[3:08:36] circumstances
[3:08:40] maybe we're looking for a fairer
[3:08:43] situation
[3:08:45] but I want you to know
[3:08:48] that it's not the anger
[3:08:50] of God that you're facing today
[3:08:53] or you'd be dust
[3:08:56] he said every opportunity to squish you
[3:08:59] like an ant isn't that the truth
[3:09:01] [Music]
[3:09:03] and yet he protected you
[3:09:05] and he ran after you
[3:09:07] he saved you from destruction
[3:09:10] again and again and again
[3:09:12] and even when you break his heart
[3:09:16] it's not anger that comes
[3:09:20] he's just waiting on you to repent
[3:09:23] where we're entering a season of teshava
[3:09:26] we're entering a season in preparation
[3:09:29] for the fall feast
[3:09:31] 40 days of repentance

[3:10:07] before you I repent
[3:10:10] for those times
[3:10:12] that I have not trusted for those times
[3:10:15] that instead of faith I have responded
[3:10:18] in fear
[3:10:20] every time I have thought that you are
[3:10:22] angry with me when your word clearly
[3:10:24] says
[3:10:25] the fire of your eyes is your fiery
[3:10:28] passion and love for me
[3:10:31] and you would move Heaven and Earth
