[0:00] be very very careful
[0:03] don't say he's clumsy
[0:13] I want you to be very careful what you
[0:16] say over your children I want you to be
[0:19] very careful what you say over your
[0:22] grandchildren
[0:23] very very careful because the spirit of
[0:26] the Lord woke me up
[0:28] and was talking to me in my spirit about
[0:31] something like this
[0:34] be very very careful
[0:37] don't say he's clumsy
[0:41] [Music]
[0:46] don't say he's socially challenged
[0:51] don't say she's socially
[0:57] and and here's where we really really
[0:59] see him
[1:01] we say like me
[1:04] come on
[1:06] what kind of mom and daddy are we
[1:10] and what we what we do we we Mark with
[1:12] our
[1:13] [Music]
[1:15] the authority of our words
[1:18] and for me to say over my son he's going
[1:20] to be an introvert like me she's going
[1:22] to be an introvert like me that one's
[1:25] going to be an extrovert like me why in
[1:28] the don't you have anything else to talk
[1:29] about
[1:31] [Music]
[1:33] it's like we project our fears on our
[1:35] children
[1:38] we're not going to do such a thing like
[1:40] that as we come into the fullness of
[1:42] recognizing Who We Are
[1:45] we really realize the effect of our
[1:48] words words in the negative we would
[1:50] also begin to discern the power and
[1:52] authority of our words in the positive
[1:54] and we would start speaking those things
[1:56] do you really want your children to be
[1:58] socially awkward because you've chosen
[2:00] to be
[2:03] oh it's quiet
[2:06] you know God didn't make you socially
[2:08] awkward no
[2:11] to be that way somebody has reinforced
[2:14] the death your definition of who you are
[2:16] someone has reinforced them
[2:21] I've chosen do that let me tell you
[2:22] something God can call you out of your
[2:25] shell and some of you God needs to put
[2:27] you back where he got you
[2:29] I'm kidding
[2:30] [Music]
[2:32] except anything that you don't like
[2:36] anything that you don't think is from
[2:38] him don't you accept it because mama had
[2:41] it and Grandma had it
[2:46] dancing right there
[2:47] it all ties right back to the word
[2:51] because you're fearfully and wonderfully
[2:53] made in the mind of a great creator
[2:55] let me tell you who you are you're the
[2:57] wife of Jesus Christ you're the Lamb's
[3:00] bride
[3:03] [Music]
