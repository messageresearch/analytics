[0:00] because it responded to the voice of the
[0:02] creator
[0:10] withstand him this is not automatic this
[0:15] doesn't come like ripe cherries from a
[0:18] tree withstand means you're gonna have
[0:20] to do something about it you're going to
[0:22] have to stand with some resistance
[0:23] you're going to have to be firm and to
[0:26] be steadfast and you're going to have to
[0:28] make her for mine I'm not going to allow
[0:30] the enemy to occupy my life any longer
[0:33] come on I'm not gonna be eat up and
[0:36] consumed with he did she did we'll never
[0:39] be able to sort all of that kind of
[0:41] stuff out in our life you'll never be
[0:44] able to undo some of the things that
[0:46] have already been done but there is a
[0:49] remedy to let the past be the past there
[0:53] is a remedy to live in the present there
[0:55] is a remedy to press into Christ that's
[0:58] the answer and not allow the enemy to
[1:01] continue to devour your destiny he wants
[1:06] it he's eating he's chewing you listen
[1:09] real close you might hear him chewing
[1:10] this morning wasted days and wasted
[1:14] years and wasted moments and wasted
[1:18] opportunities while the enemy is sitting
[1:20] over there in a corner just heating up
[1:21] our destiny eating up our Y eating up
[1:25] our purpose the reason why we were
[1:28] placed here on the earth and he will
[1:30] always do exactly what he's doing right
[1:33] now until you withstand him you just
[1:37] speak to the mountain you may not see
[1:39] the whole mountain crumble in front of
[1:42] you the moment you speak but you'd be
[1:44] careful not to miss because brother
[1:47] branham told us multiple times and his
[1:50] sermons concerning the authority of
[1:52] speaking to the mountain he said you may
[1:54] not see that one little significant he
[1:56] didn't say insignificant
[1:58] that's what you'd call it that's what I
[2:00] would call it one grain of sand on a big
[2:03] old mountain and one grain moves and you
[2:06] call that significant you know why that
[2:09] gray that one little thing that moved is
[2:11] significant because it responded to the
[2:14] voice of the creator and you know what
[2:18] it means it means that if God can roll
[2:20] one grain of sand off of your Mountain
[2:22] you can roll another and another and
[2:25] another and another and another
[2:28] so what do you do you just keep speaking
