[0:00] come see a man
[0:03] who has no condemnation for my life
[0:08] [Music]
[0:15] we're just a bunch of rotten people in
[0:18] the flesh
[0:20] it's only whoa it's only because of him
[0:25] hallelujah not because we've already
[0:28] always made the right choice
[0:30] or always thought the right thought but
[0:33] because he knew me
[0:35] he knew you before the world was framed
[0:40] he saw your choice before you were born
[0:44] come on and by his knowledge of you
[0:48] elected you predestinated you
[0:51] and made you a part of who he is
[0:55] sent you into this world with the
[0:58] representation
[1:00] of almighty god living inside of you in
[1:03] a seed form
[1:05] that could lay there for years
[1:09] unnoticed undetected until
[1:12] the right time in the mind of god
[1:15] whew and he brought you in to an
[1:18] atmosphere
[1:20] like he did the woman at the well
[1:23] had she not been ostracized and
[1:26] condemned by all of her friends
[1:28] had the whole town not turned against
[1:31] her
[1:32] she would have missed her appointment
[1:35] had jesus have gone the usual route
[1:39] he would have missed his appointment oh
[1:41] but because
[1:42] everybody else had condemned her
[1:44] rejected her ostracized her
[1:46] put her out talked about her so bad she
[1:49] couldn't show herself
[1:50] in their in their company she went to
[1:52] the well at a different time
[1:54] than everybody else and the bible said
[1:57] jesus said
[1:58] to his disciples i must needs
[2:01] [Music]
[2:03] i must needs go through samaria
[2:06] her need became his need and he found
[2:10] the wrath of well
[2:12] at the right time the prophet said that
[2:14] seed
[2:15] was laying there oh all the time
[2:21] it was being watered by the exploits
[2:25] sat on her mother's knee said and heard
[2:27] the greatness of god
[2:28] the stories of how god brought his
[2:30] people out god was watching over that
[2:32] seed
[2:33] even though she wasn't aware and she
[2:35] went out into the world
[2:36] giving herself to lust and was married
[2:40] and married and married
[2:42] i have no husband when she finally came
[2:44] in contact with the s.o.n
[2:46] [Music]
[2:48] i have no husband you well said you had
[2:50] no husband
[2:50] [Music]
[2:53] you've had a handful and the one you're
[2:56] living with right now is not your own
[2:59] in all of that in all of that that could
[3:01] condemn her
[3:02] i'd say a woman been married that many
[3:04] times
[3:06] it wasn't only the man that was part of
[3:08] the problem
[3:09] she's probably part of the problem too
[3:11] why because she was
[3:12] miserable she was born for another
[3:16] purpose
[3:17] she was born part of another world and
[3:20] here she was expressing something
[3:22] so contrary to what was inside of her
[3:26] you know it you know it but she got in
[3:28] the presence of the s-o-n
[3:30] that s-o-n struck that seed the light
[3:34] touched that seed
[3:35] that germ that was on the inside of
[3:37] god's representation
[3:39] in her and it came alive it quickened
[3:41] hallelujah
[3:43] my my my my
[3:46] and jesus loved her ministered to her in
[3:49] compassion
[3:51] oh the same people that have mistreated
[3:53] her rejected her she
[3:54] may have hated him there's no telling
[3:57] what she'd wished on them all
[3:59] but as soon as she found freedom as soon
[4:02] as the light turned on
[4:04] as soon as she recognized she was born
[4:06] for another world
[4:08] for another reason the first thing she
[4:10] wanted to do
[4:11] [Music]
[4:13] she didn't say i'm gonna sit here and
[4:14] wait on them to come apologize to me
[4:16] for the way they've treated me all these
[4:18] years no no she went running running
[4:20] running running running running running
[4:21] running running running to tell
[4:23] everybody
[4:24] who would listen to her come see a man
[4:29] who has no condemnation for my life
[4:34] sure but told me everything i've ever
[4:36] done
[4:37] and yet he loved me like i've never been
[4:39] loved before
[4:41] oh five husbands but i've never been
[4:44] loved
[4:45] like he loved me in a moment
