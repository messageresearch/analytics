[32:28] some of the things we do in our other
[32:30] media outreaches so i'm i'm not
[32:34] embarrassed that i take a little time to
[32:36] invite you to do that also if you would
[32:39] subscribe to the youtube channel if you
[32:42] would follow
[32:43] our facebook page this is the world
[32:45] we're living in today and this is how
[32:47] people keep up with one another
[32:50] i have probably 12
[32:53] full-size
[32:55] um filing cabinets down there at the
[32:58] office filled with letters
[33:01] and postcards and correspondence that
[33:04] came by what we now call snail mail
[33:07] and you know it's rare today to get a
[33:10] letter at the mailbox it's rare
[33:13] and uh because all the correspondence
[33:16] and you you may like it you may not like
[33:19] it you may be for it you may be against
[33:21] it but it's the reality of how we stay
[33:24] in touch with one another
[33:26] and many years ago the lord dealt with
[33:28] us here at our church about making our
[33:32] services available to those who were
[33:34] standing with us
[33:36] and we did it through telephone hookup
[33:39] and we had a whole row of telephone
[33:42] lines
[33:44] and old telephones old-fashioned
[33:46] telephones and these little switch boxes
[33:49] that brother wallace created for us and
[33:52] brother williams created for us
[33:54] and we would call the different ones or
[33:57] they would call us
[33:58] and we would put them on hold and when
[34:00] we flipped that switch
[34:02] everything that was going on in the
[34:04] service was then piped through the
[34:07] telephone lines and there would be times
[34:09] that 30 40 50 people would be gathered
[34:11] on the other end of that telephone line
[34:14] not able to see a thing but only able to
[34:17] hear i want to say thank you lord for
[34:20] technology i know the enemy likes to
[34:23] hijack everything
[34:26] and use it for his glory but i want to
[34:28] tell you it's being used for the glory
[34:31] of the lord jesus christ today and i
[34:34] want to thank him for it and i want to
[34:36] thank you for being connected to us
[34:38] yes we are stream only another week for
[34:42] sure we uh went that way a tuesday night
[34:45] was a week ago when we had a spike in
[34:48] the coronavirus variant among us
[34:52] and
[34:52] there are very few homes
[34:55] that were not touched by this last
[34:57] outbreak but i want to give the glory
[35:00] and the honor to the lord jesus christ i
[35:02] want to thank him for his mercy for his
[35:05] healing power for his strength and i
[35:09] want to report to you today yes there
[35:11] are still some at home who are
[35:14] struggling to get through they are still

[35:22] range from back pain to
[35:24] nausea to congestion
[35:28] all kinds of things but i want you to
[35:30] know that day by day god is bringing
[35:33] them through he's bringing us through
[35:36] because we feel this in our whole in the
[35:39] whole body we're a part of the body
[35:41] i want to thank god for his strength
[35:44] that i would be able to come and
[35:46] continue to minister to you that's his
[35:48] grace and i want to let him know how
[35:51] much i appreciate him for that we
[35:53] recognize that you may not be a part of
[35:55] our local congregation and you may be
[35:58] going through the virus where you are
[36:00] your family members i saw where sister
[36:03] lasseter was thanking us for praying for
[36:05] her granddaughter and family the lord
[36:07] has mightily touched them and brought
[36:09] them through

[36:16] and we're going to stand in agreement
[36:18] with you today and believe that god is
[36:20] going to see you through for his glory
[36:24] and it doesn't have to be the end it can
[36:27] actually be a time of transition for you
[36:30] if if i i don't know how many times i
[36:32] haven't stopped to count the times if
[36:35] the holy spirit has spoken in my inner
[36:38] being maybe some of you won't understand
[36:40] that language
[36:41] but many of you will he has spoken in my
[36:44] inner being in my inner spirit and he
[36:47] has said there is a reason in this
[36:50] season
[36:51] and so when god makes that real to you
[36:53] is as hard as it is to know that some
[36:56] people are really going through such a
[36:58] struggle
[36:59] you just have to say god i trust you i
[37:03] trust you and i believe that you are
[37:07] working even in the midst of sickness
[37:09] even in the midst of sorrow you are
[37:12] working all things for our good and
[37:16] ultimately to your glory so we want to
[37:20] give him the praise brother robert
[37:22] graves let us know today that a another
[37:26] co-worker of his working on a different
[37:28] shift i think
[37:30] lost his wife this week to covet we want
[37:33] to remember that family to the lord in
[37:36] prayer
[37:37] there was a prayer request that was sent
[37:39] him this morning for a family over
[37:41] across the river in columbus georgia
[37:44] grieving the accidental loss of their
[37:46] fifth grader
[37:48] just a precious little girl who had an
[37:52] accident in their home
[37:54] and was uh fighting for her life and she
[37:57] stepped over sometime through the night
[38:00] and that's a family that's in shock not
[38:03] only grief
[38:05] but shock and i'd like for you to lift
[38:08] up the williams family to the lord that
[38:11] god would just touch them i don't think
[38:14] there's anybody but especially a parent
[38:16] that can't feel that
[38:19] that that
[38:20] you know it's like a blow
[38:22] when you hear that someone has lost
[38:24] their child we know that some of you
[38:27] have other needs physical needs not
[38:29] related to the virus some of you are
[38:32] burdened for your families
[38:34] and you want the lord to move i know you
[38:36] do well i want to tell you he's able he
[38:39] is more than able he is abundantly able
[38:44] and we want to join with you in prayer i
[38:46] don't know if you are putting excuse me
[38:49] i don't know if you're putting your uh
[38:51] prayer request on here yet or not but uh
[38:54] if you will then we will go back and we
[38:57] will pray over those requests calling
[39:00] each one by name
[39:02] you know it's my joy to do it because i
[39:05] believe that prayer is
[39:07] sometimes we say well all i know to do
[39:09] is pray you know like prayer is not
[39:11] enough well i want you to know that
[39:13] prayer
[39:14] for one another is the best gift it's
[39:18] the greatest blessing that you could
[39:20] give to somebody else is to sincerely
[39:24] pray not just send your praying hands
[39:26] and then not do it
[39:28] but if you will sincerely pray one for
[39:31] another
[39:32] that god will move you don't even have
[39:34] to know the need but you just go in
[39:37] faith believing god and calling
[39:39] someone's name in prayer i've been
[39:41] keeping prayer lists for over 30 years
[39:44] close probably 40 years
[39:46] and
[39:47] sometimes i have certain lists that i
[39:50] pull out on certain days of the week and
[39:52] sometimes i pray over the whole prayer
[39:54] book and some days i call every name in
[39:57] that book and i say at the end of that
[40:00] name and their families
[40:02] because i know that prayer
[40:04] works
[40:06] i know there's power in prayer so we
[40:09] want to go to the lord in prayer but
[40:11] before we do let's sing that little

[42:04] that you have made a way
[42:06] for us to come to you
[42:08] and lay our burdens
[42:11] you not only told us to cast our burdens
[42:14] on you but you made a way for us to do
[42:17] it in prayer and by faith today
[42:20] we roll every burden every concern
[42:24] every need every worry every trouble
[42:27] we roll it off onto your great big
[42:30] capable shoulders and we say
[42:34] we trust you lord to save to heal and to
[42:38] deliver
[42:39] we pray for families that are grieving
[42:42] great losses
[42:44] lord would you undertake for them
[42:48] would you wrap your loving arms around
[42:50] them and whisper your grace and love and
[42:54] mercy remind them
[42:57] that if that loved one has
[43:00] made a real commitment to you
[43:03] that this is not really the end
[43:07] that death is a doorway and we will be
[43:10] reunited one day again we believe it
[43:13] lord we lift up those who are still
[43:15] fighting this virus
[43:18] we know it's nothing to play with
[43:20] we know that it's affecting different
[43:22] people in different ways
[43:24] but we know god you're above it and you
[43:27] stay on top of it
[43:28] and there is no virus or variation of a
[43:32] virus that can stand before your healing
[43:35] power
[43:37] i have just so hoped and prayed and
[43:39] believed
[43:40] that this weekend would mark a turning
[43:43] point
[43:44] in our local congregation
[43:46] that we would see those who have
[43:49] struggled along with their symptoms not
[43:52] able to get complete victory we are
[43:54] believing lord that you by the holy
[43:57] ghost
[43:58] will bring a shift to their bodies
[44:01] and that their immune systems will rise
[44:04] up in the name of the lord jesus christ
[44:06] and begin pushing every bit of this a
[44:10] trespassing spirit out of their body and
[44:13] give them victory today i pray
[44:16] in the wonderful name of the lord jesus

[44:21] turning their prayer requests in

[50:38] some birthdays in our church community
[50:40] and in my family this week and i want to
[50:44] mention them because we make it a matter
[50:46] as a family of god to pray for that
[50:48] person particularly on their birthday we
[50:51] might not ought to wait only till their
[50:53] birthday to pray for them but it's a
[50:56] good idea to make a little extra effort
[50:58] to pray for them and remember when you
[51:00] see that it's their birthday may it just
[51:03] jog your memory and cause you to spend
[51:05] some time asking the lord to help them
[51:08] sister kathy
[51:10] thibodeaux in our church
[51:12] is having a birthday this week on
[51:15] thursday and we want to say to her happy
[51:18] birthday she is coming through by the
[51:20] grace of god he is helping her
[51:23] and she is testifying of the lord's help
[51:26] in her body and we want to thank god for
[51:28] that and we just pray i pray that by the
[51:31] time thursday comes around you feel
[51:33] wonderful i know that god is able to do
[51:36] that and then on friday our baby girl
[51:39] who's not a baby anymore has a birthday
[51:43] she's momo to a lot of people she's
[51:45] mariah destiny to us
[51:48] and we are so thankful for her she
[51:50] brings a lot of joy into our lives she
[51:54] brings some challenges as well
[51:57] but uh it's all in good fun
[51:59] she is uh a real organizer and she's a
[52:03] real baker and she's responsible for
[52:06] making a whole lot of sourdough bread i
[52:09] saw ten loaves on the
[52:12] uh dining room table yesterday that she
[52:15] had made so it's hard for stacy and i to
[52:17] believe that our baby is 15
[52:20] but she will be
[52:21] on friday and then our oldest son who
[52:24] was leading worship today
[52:26] benjamin judah will be 23 is that right
[52:30] it's hard to believe that he will be 23
[52:33] years old so
[52:35] we want to wish mariah sister kathy and
[52:38] benjamin judah a happy birthday and also
[52:41] on
[52:42] saturday
[52:43] which is the 21st it's also joseph
[52:46] hawkson's birthday
[52:48] and we want to wish him a very happy
[52:50] birthday
[52:51] he's uh
[52:52] had a little bit of sickness but uh by
[52:55] the next day he was already playing
[52:56] outside so we want to thank god for
[52:59] giving him victory and he's a real
[53:01] helper around here and we just want to
[53:03] say happy birthday to brother joseph
[53:06] hawkson brother hawkins sister mary
[53:08] beth's oldest child
[53:10] who's quickly growing up
[53:13] and also to brother paul drown we want
[53:16] to say how much we love you brother
[53:18] you're a great encouragement to us and
[53:20] we want to wish you a happy birthday on
[53:22] saturday would you just
[53:25] show your appreciation even though they
[53:27] can't hear you and could we just clap
[53:28] for these musicians it was so good to
[53:31] have them here today and we got a good
[53:34] surprise when joshua yantis was here to
[53:37] play the guitar and
[53:39] he was one of the first to go through
[53:42] and he had a rough time there a day or
[53:44] two but god was really good to him he is
[53:46] back to work now and
[53:49] well we didn't reach out to the
[53:50] musicians we just
[53:52] we just even though all of them should
[53:54] just about be done we just left it with
[53:56] them and i was so excited and happy to
[53:59] see that uh that uh josh had come today
[54:02] to play the guitar for us it helps a lot
[54:05] and sister laurel was here to play the
[54:07] piano and mirabeth was taking a day of a
[54:10] break there because everyone in sister
[54:13] laurel's home is out of quarantine now
[54:16] and doing well by the grace of god so it
[54:19] was nice to have her playing today as
[54:21] well
[54:22] we want to thank you for giving
[54:24] uh there are ways for you to give even
[54:27] though you are our local congregation is
[54:30] not able to come and worship physically
[54:32] just yet uh there are those who are
[54:34] dropping off their tithe and offering
[54:36] that's a great blessing because then
[54:38] we're able to keep up with all of our
[54:39] responsibilities without a lag and we
[54:42] want to thank you for that thank you for
[54:44] your faithfulness to help us
[54:46] you can also give by the app and some of
[54:48] our people do all their giving on the
[54:50] app or visit the website you can give
[54:53] that way you can even mail an offering
[54:55] in
[54:56] and
[54:57] we just say
[54:58] this goes primarily to our local
[55:02] congregation
[55:03] but if the lord should lay on your heart
[55:05] to send something to help us do what we
[55:07] do it's costly we're out in the country
[55:10] and we pay over a thousand dollars a
[55:13] month to be able to have a right at that
[55:15] amount to be able to have the
[55:16] connections that we need to be able to
[55:18] get out to you this way
[55:20] and so anything you would want to do to
[55:22] help it's appreciated but your prayers
[55:25] is what we would appreciate above all
[55:28] let me say to the local congregation
[55:31] all of your giving toward the principle
[55:33] we had a mandate that we would start
[55:36] knocking down all the debt and it was
[55:40] overwhelming amount when we started but
[55:42] we're getting uh we're getting to where
[55:44] we can see that god is going to help us
[55:47] do that the lord was speaking to brother
[55:49] greeley that if we would make a
[55:51] concentrated effort to knock that off to
[55:53] get rid of it to start working it out
[55:56] until we could pay it off and be done
[55:58] with it that we would begin to see some
[56:00] other things activated and i believe
[56:02] that so just let me announce to the
[56:05] local body that uh since march this is 8
[56:09] 15 21 today and since the first sunday
[56:12] of march you have given 126
[56:17] 642.48
[56:20] and i want to give god the glory and i
[56:23] want to thank you for being a help to us
[56:26] i saw where someone this morning one of
[56:28] our streamers really part of our new
[56:31] hope family
[56:32] i saw where they uh put in a nice
[56:35] offering for the principal and uh they
[56:39] said it was compliments of mr biden and
[56:42] i knew exactly what that was about it
[56:44] was a family who had gotten the child
[56:46] tax credit and they had dedicated all of
[56:49] that to help us with that principle i
[56:52] appreciate that and i got a good chuckle
[56:54] out of it too might as well invest it in
[56:57] the kingdom
[56:58] and watch god pay the dividend and he
[57:01] does we want to turn this morning to
[57:04] romans chapter one
[57:07] we want to read in verse three and four
[57:11] this is where we started uh last week
[57:14] and then we're going to move a whole lot
[57:16] farther than that i'm just making a
[57:18] quick check here
[57:20] again thank you every one of you who are
[57:23] joining us live on all of the different
[57:26] platforms that we have we appreciate
[57:29] your support we appreciate your amens
[57:32] your virtual amens
[57:34] are welcome they're encouraging to us
[57:37] and we appreciate you being in touch
[57:39] with us that way
[57:40] and
[57:41] romans chapter 1 verse 3 and 4
[57:44] concerning his son jesus christ our lord
[57:48] which was made of the seed of david
[57:50] according to the flesh
[57:53] and declared to be the son of god with
[57:56] power
[57:57] according to the spirit of holiness
[58:01] by the resurrection from
[58:05] the dead
[58:06] for those of you who have been studying
[58:08] with us for the past weeks
[58:11] couple of months i would say now
[58:13] we are studying seven
[58:15] different offices of the holy ghost
[58:18] and these are all mentioned by name and
[58:22] we are on number four now
[58:25] we talked about the spirit of life
[58:28] we talked about the spirit of truth and
[58:32] we talked about the spirit of adoption
[58:36] and last sunday we started on
[58:38] the spirit of holiness
[58:41] and then we will go to the spirit of
[58:43] grace the spirit of supplication and the
[58:47] spirit of glory all seven of these
[58:50] mentioned in the scripture and it's been
[58:53] a good study and we are talking about
[58:56] again today the spirit of holiness and
[58:59] what holiness is i just want to re sort
[59:03] of recover
[59:04] some of our notes for just a moment
[59:06] before we move into another scripture
[59:08] holiness is not about religion
[59:11] it's not merely about a set of rules
[59:15] holiness is about relationship
[59:19] our god and creator long to have
[59:23] fellowship with his own created ones
[59:26] that you and i
[59:28] as our relationship grows with the
[59:31] father into maturity by the spirit of
[59:34] adoption which we covered it brings us
[59:38] in to a deeper revelation
[59:41] to a higher realization of just how holy
[59:46] our father god is
[59:48] true holiness is a result of the holy
[59:51] ghost changing our hearts and minds
[59:55] until holy living becomes a way of life
[59:58] for us
[59:59] we believe that holiness in lifestyle is
[1:00:03] an overflow of what the spirit of
[1:00:06] holiness is accomplishing in the life of
[1:00:09] the believer personal holiness develops
[1:00:12] as an overflow of relationship and
[1:00:15] intimacy with god true change takes
[1:00:19] place in our hearts
[1:00:21] when we allow the spirit of holiness
[1:00:24] to point out and to pinpoint areas of
[1:00:27] our life where we are not living up to
[1:00:30] the
[1:00:31] glorious power
[1:00:34] of his holiness
[1:00:36] we approach him with fear
[1:00:38] the fear of the lord not the fear of
[1:00:41] judgment not the fear of losing out with
[1:00:44] him but we are
[1:00:46] really standing in awe
[1:00:49] when we behold his holiness when we read
[1:00:52] the scripture and we read what he did
[1:00:55] and we remember what he is doing it
[1:00:58] really should cause us to be in awe of
[1:01:01] his majesty his splendor and his
[1:01:04] holiness and when you think about the
[1:01:07] fact that some of that holiness is
[1:01:10] residing in you
[1:01:12] when you think about some of the
[1:01:14] holiness of god is residing in you it
[1:01:18] causes you to want to make better
[1:01:20] choices it causes you to want to live a
[1:01:23] cleaner and more separated and
[1:01:27] consecrated life unto god can you say
[1:01:30] amen it brings about a true change
[1:01:34] holiness by greek word by the definition
[1:01:37] of the greek word is a process a quality
[1:01:40] and condition of a holy disposition
[1:01:44] and the quality of one's holiness in
[1:01:48] personal context excuse me in personal
[1:01:52] conduct the way we live our lives his
[1:01:55] holiness resting on our lives is the
[1:01:58] principle that separates the believer
[1:02:01] from the world remember it's not just
[1:02:05] what we do how we dress it's not just
[1:02:09] those things that separates us from the
[1:02:12] world it's the fact that his holiness is
[1:02:15] resting in us that's what makes us
[1:02:17] completely different now because his
[1:02:20] holiness is abiding in us
[1:02:24] the spirit of holiness by the holy ghost
[1:02:27] is operating in our life then it causes
[1:02:30] us to want to be different it causes us
[1:02:33] to want to live a modest life to dress
[1:02:36] modestly in a world that's gone
[1:02:38] absolutely insane
[1:02:41] it causes us to want to draw distinction
[1:02:44] where the world wants to blur the lines
[1:02:47] have you ever seen such a blurring of
[1:02:50] the lines as the hour in which we live
[1:02:54] when you hear the medical our our
[1:02:57] medical associations of our nation
[1:03:00] saying we're just about to the place
[1:03:04] where we are going to suggest that
[1:03:06] people no longer assign a gender
[1:03:10] identity at birth
[1:03:12] i want you to know that is just the
[1:03:14] blurring of the lines it's a spirit of
[1:03:17] babylon it's a spirit of confusion and
[1:03:20] when the spirit of holiness is at work
[1:03:23] in your life it actually makes you want
[1:03:25] to make the lion more distinct it causes
[1:03:28] a brother a sister to want to make the
[1:03:30] line darker you know what i mean draw it
[1:03:33] even even sharper right down the edge
[1:03:37] and say i don't want to be in the blurry
[1:03:39] line i don't want to be in the gray area
[1:03:42] but i want to stand on the side of god's
[1:03:46] righteousness and holiness
[1:03:49] holiness consecrates us to god's service
[1:03:53] both in soul which is the mind and the
[1:03:55] will and the emotions and is manifested
[1:03:59] in the body finding fulfillment in moral
[1:04:01] dedication and a life committed to
[1:04:04] purity i want you to know no matter what
[1:04:07] the world is doing around us god has a
[1:04:10] people no matter what teenagers are
[1:04:12] doing out there in the world we pray for
[1:04:14] them to find jesus but i want you to
[1:04:17] know those teenagers those young people
[1:04:20] that have received a touch of the holy
[1:04:22] ghost they have that spirit of holiness
[1:04:25] working inside of them pulling them back
[1:04:28] when they get a little close to the edge
[1:04:30] when they get a little close to the
[1:04:32] cliff thank god for the spirit of
[1:04:34] holiness that pulls us back and says now
[1:04:37] wait a minute isn't that a slippery
[1:04:39] slope now you know what i've had the
[1:04:41] spirit of god talk to my heart
[1:04:43] and uh when he was talking to my heart i
[1:04:46] realized that what he was dealing with
[1:04:48] me about is not definable as sin
[1:04:51] you you couldn't find a scripture to say
[1:04:55] that is just absolute a manifestation of
[1:04:57] unbelief that's just a straight out sin
[1:05:01] and you when you deal with that but yet
[1:05:03] you know the spirit of god's dealing
[1:05:05] with you about something but you can't
[1:05:07] quite see it in black and white in the
[1:05:09] scripture sometimes that's the spirit of
[1:05:12] holiness trying to pull you back from a
[1:05:15] slippery slope the bible said the spirit
[1:05:17] searcheth all things all the deep things
[1:05:21] and the spirit of god knows because he
[1:05:24] sees ahead and maybe by you accepting
[1:05:27] something into your life in that gray
[1:05:30] area that you cannot completely define
[1:05:34] as a work of unrighteousness
[1:05:36] maybe the holy spirit is pulling you
[1:05:39] back and dealing with your heart because
[1:05:41] he sees what's up ahead when one
[1:05:44] compromise leads to another compromise
[1:05:46] that leads to another compromise and
[1:05:49] then you have the church world in the
[1:05:50] condition she's in today i don't know if
[1:05:52] you're if you're helping me now i can't
[1:05:54] hear you out there i don't know if
[1:05:56] you're giving me any amens out there but
[1:05:58] i want you to know i'm telling you the
[1:06:00] truth so if the holy spirit starts
[1:06:03] dealing with you like that you might be
[1:06:05] the only one in the church
[1:06:07] you might be the only one in the family
[1:06:09] that has this conviction what that is is
[1:06:11] god is developing a conviction in your
[1:06:14] life now you've got to be careful with
[1:06:16] that conviction you can share with
[1:06:18] others how the lord has dealt with you
[1:06:20] but you've got to make sure as a
[1:06:22] believer that you don't judge other
[1:06:24] people by how the spirit of god has
[1:06:26] dealt with you because the spirit of
[1:06:28] holiness in your life may be pulling you
[1:06:32] back from something because you have a
[1:06:34] predispos
[1:06:35] predisposition
[1:06:37] you have a weakness there may be
[1:06:39] something in you that would cause you to
[1:06:42] really get in trouble if you start down
[1:06:44] that road where another believer might
[1:06:46] be able to just
[1:06:48] have that little thing in their life and
[1:06:50] never go any farther so i don't want to
[1:06:52] add confusion to what you may be hearing
[1:06:55] today but i just want you to know that
[1:06:58] god didn't fill us with this holy ghost
[1:07:00] to be a judge and jury for other people
[1:07:03] he filled us with this holy ghost to
[1:07:05] watch after our lives to guard our
[1:07:07] families and we should yield to him we
[1:07:11] should obey him if we feel like we're
[1:07:13] the only fish that's swimming against
[1:07:15] the stream
[1:07:17] holiness causes every component of our
[1:07:20] character to stand
[1:07:22] god's inspection and meet his approval
[1:07:26] if the spirit of god deals with you
[1:07:27] about something and you obey him and you
[1:07:30] make a change in your life then you
[1:07:32] don't ever have to worry about meeting
[1:07:36] god's condition because if you've been
[1:07:38] obedient you have met his condition you
[1:07:42] see the spirit of holiness is operating
[1:07:45] in the life of the believer to build in
[1:07:49] us
[1:07:50] not just a character but his character i
[1:07:53] know a lot of people that are characters
[1:07:56] that's a word we use in the sound say oh
[1:07:58] he's a real character oh she's a real
[1:08:00] character we're not talking about just
[1:08:03] someone's distinction we're not just
[1:08:05] talking about what makes somebody odd or
[1:08:07] unusual we're talking about the forming
[1:08:11] of his character the character of jesus
[1:08:15] christ i know a lot of people see him as
[1:08:17] a pushover but i want you to know jesus
[1:08:20] was humble and he was meek and he was
[1:08:23] mild but he was very serious about his
[1:08:26] father's business so sometimes we get an
[1:08:29] idea in our mind of of who he is and how
[1:08:33] he how he would behave if he were
[1:08:35] walking among us today and we may miss
[1:08:37] the fact that the same jesus who was
[1:08:41] willing to lose reputation by eating
[1:08:44] with the sinners is the same jesus that
[1:08:47] wanted to set his father's house in
[1:08:49] order when religion was taking over for
[1:08:53] sincerity and for relationship and so he
[1:08:56] can be meek and mild and gentle like a
[1:08:59] lamb but i want you to know the next
[1:09:01] time
[1:09:01] planet earth has an encounter with jesus
[1:09:04] christ he's not coming like that little
[1:09:06] lamb
[1:09:07] dumb before her shearers but i want you
[1:09:10] to know he's coming as a lion of the
[1:09:13] tribe of judah and he's coming to do his
[1:09:17] father's business the business of the
[1:09:19] kingdom can you say amen
[1:09:21] character is the mental and moral
[1:09:24] quality that is distinctive to an
[1:09:27] individual holiness causes every part of
[1:09:31] our character to be able to stand
[1:09:33] inspection to the holy spirit and meet
[1:09:36] the approval of our heavenly father the
[1:09:38] word character in the greek
[1:09:41] it actually talks about uh from the 16th
[1:09:44] century it actually talks about a stamp
[1:09:48] it talks about a a tool that is used to
[1:09:52] make an impression on something else and
[1:09:56] so your character is important your
[1:09:59] character is really who you really are
[1:10:03] when no one is looking
[1:10:05] your true character will come out and
[1:10:08] that's why we need i say we
[1:10:11] need the spirit of holiness operating in
[1:10:15] our life you see without the baptism of
[1:10:17] the holy ghost you don't have the spirit
[1:10:19] of holiness operating on the inside so
[1:10:22] that's why we need to stress today like
[1:10:25] never before that every man woman boy or
[1:10:28] girl needs to have the genuine baptism
[1:10:33] of the holy ghost and fire i want to
[1:10:35] read just a portion from the from the
[1:10:37] church age book
[1:10:40] uh
[1:10:41] there may be things in the church age
[1:10:43] book i don't
[1:10:44] perhaps agree with it seems to me like
[1:10:47] there are things that may not be exactly
[1:10:49] as he said it but this is a beautiful
[1:10:52] example
[1:10:53] of of taking a truth that was spoken and
[1:10:58] making it easy for us to get a hold of
[1:11:01] he it starts off in james chapter one
[1:11:05] uh he's quoting that verse and we might
[1:11:08] not have got that pulled up because they
[1:11:10] might not have recognized that as part
[1:11:12] of the quote so i'll just go ahead and
[1:11:13] read it to you and then we'll catch up
[1:11:15] here
[1:11:16] when it comes to to romans 8. first he
[1:11:19] said in james 1 verse 2 and 4 he said my
[1:11:22] brethren counted all joy when you fall
[1:11:24] into divers temptations knowing this
[1:11:27] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:11:30] patience but let patience have her
[1:11:33] perfect work that she may be perfect and
[1:11:37] entire wanting nothing and then the
[1:11:40] church age book said why does he stand
[1:11:43] by and now we'll pick up where where you
[1:11:46] had it the reason is this is the church
[1:11:48] age book now the reason is romans 8
[1:11:52] verse 17 and 18. he said and if children
[1:11:56] then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs
[1:11:59] with christ listen
[1:12:02] if so be
[1:12:03] that we suffer with him
[1:12:05] that we may be also glorified together
[1:12:10] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:12:13] present time are not worthy to be
[1:12:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:12:20] revealed in us
[1:12:22] and so after those verses were quoted he
[1:12:24] goes on to tell us unless
[1:12:27] we suffer with him
[1:12:29] we cannot reign with him
[1:12:33] you have to suffer to rain hear it you
[1:12:37] have to suffer to reign are you willing
[1:12:39] to suffer are you willing to do it with
[1:12:42] the right attitude and a right spirit
[1:12:44] because if we're going to reign with him
[1:12:47] we are going to have some suffering here
[1:12:49] also as a part of who he is we are on
[1:12:52] this earth training for reigning that is
[1:12:55] what's happening to us right now we're
[1:12:57] in training for a day that we're going
[1:12:59] to sit in his throne and even judge the
[1:13:02] nations and the scripture says even
[1:13:04] judge angels now that's a powerful
[1:13:06] authority that's given to the last day
[1:13:08] bride of the lord jesus christ it goes
[1:13:11] on to say the reason for this is that
[1:13:14] character that's why we're using this
[1:13:17] quotation
[1:13:18] the reason for this is that character
[1:13:21] simply is never made without suffering
[1:13:26] character is a you say it
[1:13:29] victory
[1:13:31] not a gift in other words character is
[1:13:34] not something that's imparted to you
[1:13:37] because you have surrendered your life
[1:13:39] to the lord jesus so you automatically
[1:13:42] receive character as a gift no sir
[1:13:45] character is a victory how many of you
[1:13:47] know what a victory is it's what comes
[1:13:50] at the end of the battle it's what comes
[1:13:52] at the end of the trial some of you who
[1:13:55] are fighting the virus right now when
[1:13:57] you get to the place that you can say
[1:13:59] i'm 100
[1:14:01] i've had a couple of people say to me
[1:14:02] this week i feel 100
[1:14:05] then you say i have the victory it's
[1:14:07] over with the battle is done hallelujah
[1:14:10] and i'm on the other side of it and
[1:14:12] that's what character is it's a victory
[1:14:14] it means you have been tried in the fire
[1:14:18] you have been tested in your life you
[1:14:21] have been put in positions that it would
[1:14:23] have been easy to compromise the truth
[1:14:26] it would have been easy to cheat it
[1:14:29] would have been easy to tell a lie but
[1:14:32] by the help and the grace of god you
[1:14:35] went all the way through the battle
[1:14:37] every time
[1:14:38] oh god help me oh god help me to do it
[1:14:42] right help me to say it right help me to
[1:14:45] choose what is right and by his grace
[1:14:49] and your obedience and yieldedness to
[1:14:51] him he brought you through it's like
[1:14:54] brother terry tidwell wrote the song uh
[1:14:57] god will make this trial a blessing and
[1:15:00] the last verse i believe it is said i'm
[1:15:02] standing now
[1:15:04] on the mountain looking back where i can
[1:15:07] see that when i was in that deep dark
[1:15:10] valley his strong hand was leading me oh
[1:15:14] it's good to feel the sunrise i can
[1:15:17] taste sweet victory god has made this
[1:15:20] trial a blessing that's the love he has
[1:15:23] for me
[1:15:24] so character is formed and victory comes
[1:15:28] on the other side of the trial on the
[1:15:31] other side of the testing hold on
[1:15:34] press on
[1:15:35] get a hold of god with everything you
[1:15:37] have
[1:15:38] let your hand of faith touch touch him
[1:15:41] and refuse to turn loose because he will
[1:15:44] pull you can anybody agree with me that
[1:15:46] he will pull you through the trial he
[1:15:50] will pull you through the test if you
[1:15:52] yield to the work of the holy ghost oh
[1:15:55] my
[1:15:56] i don't know what to think about
[1:15:57] groups of people who say that the
[1:16:00] baptism of the holy ghost is not for
[1:16:02] today
[1:16:03] i don't know what to think about people
[1:16:05] who make that their doctrine because
[1:16:07] first of all it's anti-word
[1:16:09] and second of all how do you make it how
[1:16:12] do you survive how do you get through
[1:16:15] stuff without the baptism of the holy
[1:16:19] ghost he works in us i just named four
[1:16:22] of the seven a moment ago as the spirit
[1:16:24] of truth as the spirit of life as the
[1:16:26] spirit of adoption as the spirit of
[1:16:29] holiness all of this is the holy ghost
[1:16:32] working in our life we're blessed people
[1:16:35] character is a victory not a gift a man
[1:16:39] without character can't reign
[1:16:42] because power apart from character is
[1:16:45] satanic now i know there are some people
[1:16:47] that say well brother brant i've never
[1:16:49] said it quite like that well i want you
[1:16:51] to understand that that is a truth
[1:16:54] that is a truth because it is based on
[1:16:56] truth
[1:16:57] you operate in power is one thing but
[1:17:00] are you operating with character that
[1:17:03] goes with that power i have said this
[1:17:05] many times before i don't want to take a
[1:17:08] lot of time to say it today but one of
[1:17:10] the many many many things that the
[1:17:14] message made such a difference in my
[1:17:15] life answered so many questions for me
[1:17:20] help me i mean really helped me on many
[1:17:23] many many things but one of the things
[1:17:25] that god used the message for in the
[1:17:27] early days was the message the anointed
[1:17:29] ones at the end time
[1:17:31] when i heard that message i had always
[1:17:34] had this question in my life
[1:17:37] my mind because i saw people being
[1:17:39] mightily used of the spirit of god and
[1:17:42] yet i knew their character was wrong
[1:17:44] i knew they were not living the life it
[1:17:47] eventually came out
[1:17:49] i don't know how many times through the
[1:17:51] years someone we knew some preacher
[1:17:53] somewhere would run off with a piano
[1:17:55] player
[1:17:56] have an affair on his wife and run off
[1:17:59] and marry somebody else and leave his
[1:18:01] children and i don't want to go into all
[1:18:03] of it
[1:18:04] maybe a man would come through mightily
[1:18:07] used in the gifts
[1:18:08] praying for the sick and they would
[1:18:10] recover and it would come out later that
[1:18:13] they were alcoholics
[1:18:15] or on drugs
[1:18:17] i have walked with men and in ministry
[1:18:20] through the years
[1:18:22] that would have such glorious
[1:18:23] visitations and experiences and then
[1:18:26] later find out that a lot of it was
[1:18:28] induced by the drugs that they were
[1:18:31] taking
[1:18:32] and these things so
[1:18:34] tormented my mind when i was just a
[1:18:36] young man and then i heard brother
[1:18:39] branham preaching on the anointed ones
[1:18:41] at the end time saying this that the
[1:18:43] anointing was genuine what the holy
[1:18:47] ghost was doing was genuine those gifts
[1:18:51] are are without repentance the bible
[1:18:54] tells us he gives a gift he doesn't take
[1:18:56] it back the gift on somebody's life may
[1:18:59] be genuine the anointing that operates
[1:19:02] that gift you see a lot of those things
[1:19:04] that happened in the services were
[1:19:06] because the people had faith because the
[1:19:09] believers were holding on they weren't
[1:19:10] pulling on a man they were pulling on
[1:19:13] god and god would come down and speak to
[1:19:16] their need and minister to their body
[1:19:18] and give them healing and and we we
[1:19:21] couldn't figure out how that's possible
[1:19:23] but then we heard the prophet teaching
[1:19:25] it that way and saying the man may be
[1:19:28] false
[1:19:29] the character of the man may be rotten
[1:19:32] but the gift that was placed on his life
[1:19:35] was from god and it was genuine he even
[1:19:38] gave us the example brethren of of a
[1:19:40] fortune teller
[1:19:42] a fortune teller that he had an
[1:19:44] encounter with and he talked about
[1:19:47] sometimes how these people are given
[1:19:49] true gifts
[1:19:51] but they are using that gift for the
[1:19:54] wrong reason they're using it for
[1:19:57] darkness instead of for the kingdom of
[1:19:59] light the gift itself genuine the way
[1:20:02] that gift begins to move on the genuine
[1:20:04] movement genuine we could say anointing
[1:20:07] absolutely because it's the anointing
[1:20:10] that causes the gift to operate like
[1:20:12] that however the life is wrong somebody
[1:20:14] said well what does all that mean it
[1:20:16] means that we're not following men we're
[1:20:19] following the word of god and if men
[1:20:22] fail if men fall if men
[1:20:25] throw in the towel i know men who just
[1:20:28] gave it all up and said i don't want any
[1:20:30] part of it every now and again
[1:20:33] a minister who is away from the lord
[1:20:37] away from ministry will even reach out
[1:20:40] to me and say pray for me i want to be
[1:20:42] remembered in prayer boy that really
[1:20:45] touches my heart
[1:20:46] i don't know what moves me to prayer any
[1:20:48] more than that because i know that i
[1:20:51] know that i know i may be preaching to
[1:20:53] some right now i know that i know that i
[1:20:55] know that god has placed a calling on
[1:20:58] their life and i know that somewhere
[1:21:00] along the way the enemy was able to trap
[1:21:03] them to trick them i don't know but it
[1:21:06] could be that the enemy was able to get
[1:21:08] them to put their eyes on people and not
[1:21:11] on the cross and not on jesus i want you
[1:21:13] to know as a minister who has been
[1:21:15] ministering a long time since
[1:21:18] 1975 i want you to know there have been
[1:21:21] many times along the way that i started
[1:21:24] getting my eyes on other people and that
[1:21:27] same devil
[1:21:28] would come and try to trick me and trap
[1:21:31] me and cause me to give up even at times
[1:21:35] so strong that the spirit of suicide
[1:21:37] would even try to come in but god in his
[1:21:40] glorious grace not because i deserved it
[1:21:44] not because i was good but because he
[1:21:47] had me in his mind before the foundation
[1:21:50] of the world he spared me and he
[1:21:52] delivered me and he brought me out of it
[1:21:54] so my heart goes out to those who have
[1:21:57] fallen by the wayside i call you in in
[1:22:00] the name of the lord jesus christ i tell
[1:22:02] you the gifts and callings of god are
[1:22:04] without repentance and all you have to
[1:22:07] do is call on the lord and he will not
[1:22:10] only restore your life but he will put
[1:22:13] you he'll just pick you up if you let
[1:22:15] him and set you on the right path and
[1:22:17] he'll help you to overcome daily we're
[1:22:20] too
[1:22:20] late in this thing to let a little
[1:22:22] bitterness to let a little resentment to
[1:22:25] get your eyes on people and give up on
[1:22:28] god don't dare do that whoever you are
[1:22:30] maybe you're just a believer in a church
[1:22:32] somewhere you have no real form of
[1:22:34] ministry well let me tell you right now
[1:22:37] that god wants to help you he wants to
[1:22:39] deliver you he wants to put
[1:22:41] pull you up pick you up and uh so i
[1:22:44] appreciated hearing brother branham
[1:22:47] teaching those things and it helped me
[1:22:49] to realize that was god moving that was
[1:22:51] god moving here the man had come under
[1:22:54] something false but god his character
[1:22:56] was false
[1:22:58] it shall reign on the just and the
[1:23:00] unjust the same holy ghost reign the
[1:23:03] same rain that fell in the vision the
[1:23:05] same rain that fell and caused the
[1:23:07] little wheat to raise up his hands and
[1:23:09] say praise the lord thank you jesus was
[1:23:11] the same rain that fell on the little
[1:23:13] tares and you know what they raised up
[1:23:15] and try to do the very same thing even
[1:23:17] though they were manifesting another
[1:23:19] seed
[1:23:20] something else i am thankful that god
[1:23:22] has an answer he has an answer for all
[1:23:25] of our questions i'm thankful that he
[1:23:27] has the power to reproduce his character
[1:23:30] in us if we yield to it he goes on to
[1:23:32] say so a man without character can't
[1:23:34] reign because power see the preachers
[1:23:36] had power
[1:23:38] but there was something wrong and here
[1:23:39] he says power apart from character is
[1:23:42] satanic so you want to watch that you
[1:23:45] want to watch that many many people are
[1:23:46] fooled by demonstrations of power we're
[1:23:49] not just looking for power in a ministry
[1:23:51] we're looking for character we're
[1:23:54] looking for a character that stands the
[1:23:55] test of time he said but power with
[1:23:58] character is fit to rule this is the
[1:24:02] bride that jesus is building on planet
[1:24:04] earth right now you may have failed you
[1:24:07] may have had a bad character you may
[1:24:09] have made bad decisions but i want you
[1:24:11] to know yield of the spirit of grace
[1:24:13] we're going to get on that next time
[1:24:14] well maybe not the next service but soon
[1:24:17] uh in a couple of services we'll be on
[1:24:20] the spirit of grace you let the spirit
[1:24:22] of grace do a work in your life let him
[1:24:24] remind you that he's the one who called
[1:24:27] you let me tell you something if jesus
[1:24:29] called you he knows how to deliver you
[1:24:31] he knows how to get you on the right on
[1:24:33] the right track on the right path and he
[1:24:35] knows how to come and once again reflect
[1:24:37] who he is in the life that you live
[1:24:40] that's the working of the spirit of
[1:24:41] holiness he goes on to say a man without
[1:24:44] character let me read it again a man
[1:24:46] without character can't reign because
[1:24:48] power apart from character is satanic
[1:24:50] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:24:53] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:24:56] throne on the same basis that he
[1:24:58] overcame and is set down in his father's
[1:25:02] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:25:05] with him we don't overcome by our own
[1:25:08] power we overcome by the blood of the
[1:25:10] lamb by the word of our testimony and
[1:25:13] the fact that we did not love our lives
[1:25:15] more than the service of the lord and
[1:25:17] the things of god i want you to know we
[1:25:20] have to be willing to not only live for
[1:25:22] truth we have to be willing to die for
[1:25:24] truth can we go on to the next little
[1:25:27] part and the little temporary suffering
[1:25:29] we go through now is not worthy to be
[1:25:32] compared to the tremendous glory that
[1:25:35] will be revealed in us when he comes oh
[1:25:38] what treasures are laid up for those who
[1:25:41] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:25:44] through much tribulation now that may
[1:25:46] not be the door you would choose to go
[1:25:48] into the kingdom but i want you to know
[1:25:50] it is the door that many of us have to
[1:25:52] walk through we have to walk through
[1:25:54] that door of tribulation to come into
[1:25:56] the fullness of the kingdom of god when
[1:25:59] i look at the concept of holiness we're
[1:26:02] moving on
[1:26:03] i could say
[1:26:05] and believe that it is one of the most
[1:26:07] misunderstood truths in the bible
[1:26:09] and we as human beings especially church
[1:26:12] church kids
[1:26:14] those of us who are raised around the
[1:26:16] church
[1:26:17] we are filled with so many concepts so
[1:26:20] many thoughts so many notions so many
[1:26:23] impressions sometimes we're standing on
[1:26:25] impressions we're standing on ideas
[1:26:29] we're standing on opinions instead of
[1:26:31] standing on the word did you know
[1:26:33] there's a whole
[1:26:34] we look around us we see the the
[1:26:37] condition the church world is in and we
[1:26:39] see that there are whole movements that
[1:26:41] are built on notions there are whole
[1:26:44] movements that are built on opinions
[1:26:47] there are whole movements out there that
[1:26:49] are built on thoughts and concepts but i
[1:26:52] want you to know if your concepts are
[1:26:54] wrong your theology is going to be wrong
[1:26:56] if your opinions are wrong and you're
[1:26:58] standing on them your whole theology is
[1:27:01] going to be wrong somebody said what's
[1:27:02] theology anyway i'm not a preacher so i
[1:27:05] don't have to worry about theology
[1:27:06] actually theology is the study of who
[1:27:08] god is and i want you to know you may
[1:27:11] not be a teacher you may not be a
[1:27:13] preacher but every one of us wants to
[1:27:15] discover the fullness of who god is we
[1:27:18] want to know that so that we can move
[1:27:20] according to that so that we don't miss
[1:27:22] anything that we are heirs of i tell you
[1:27:26] i i think often of the of the story of
[1:27:28] the man who got to heaven and he saw all
[1:27:31] of those all of those or had an
[1:27:33] experience and he went to heaven and he
[1:27:35] saw all of those packages just lines and
[1:27:39] stacks and stacks of packages he looked
[1:27:41] down and every one of them had his name
[1:27:43] on it what is this he asked these are
[1:27:46] all the things that you could have had
[1:27:47] you could have had these benefits you
[1:27:50] could have had these blessings but you
[1:27:52] never asked you never tried to access
[1:27:55] these things while you were on the earth
[1:27:57] i dare say that there are many of us who
[1:28:00] have received the baptism of the holy
[1:28:02] ghost who don't even understand what it
[1:28:05] means to yield to the holy ghost
[1:28:08] as the spirit of truth as the spirit of
[1:28:10] life as the spirit of adoption as the
[1:28:13] spirit of holiness
[1:28:14] all the holy ghost but different
[1:28:16] ministries
[1:28:18] different offices different
[1:28:19] administrations of the same spirit we
[1:28:22] may not even understand what god has put
[1:28:25] here oh my what he has placed here is
[1:28:28] more than enough to get us all the way
[1:28:30] so we don't want to build our theology
[1:28:33] our concept of god our thought of god
[1:28:36] our study of god we don't want to build
[1:28:38] that on notions
[1:28:40] we don't want to build that on sinking
[1:28:41] sands of opinion and thoughts and
[1:28:44] precedence we want to build it on the
[1:28:46] word we want to make sure that our
[1:28:48] theology is on the word that our belief
[1:28:51] system is built on the word and this is
[1:28:53] one of the things the spirit of holiness
[1:28:55] helps us do if we let him
[1:28:57] if we let him
[1:28:58] it's very very hard
[1:29:01] for a brother or sister to allow the
[1:29:03] spirit of holiness to correct some
[1:29:06] tradition that they may be holding to
[1:29:08] that's anti-word i tell you our
[1:29:11] traditions there's nothing wrong with
[1:29:12] traditions unless they're making the
[1:29:14] word of god of none effect or
[1:29:17] non-effective in our life and sometimes
[1:29:19] we can so hold on to tradition that
[1:29:22] we're really rejecting the truth of
[1:29:24] god's word what i love about this
[1:29:27] kingdom and what god has done through
[1:29:29] the church ages to bring us to where we
[1:29:31] are today is in different seasons
[1:29:34] of church history he shines his light on
[1:29:38] different truths of who he is it's all
[1:29:40] the truth it's all the truth but it
[1:29:42] begins to line up and it begins to stack
[1:29:45] line upon line and precept upon precept
[1:29:49] revelation upon revelation and that's
[1:29:51] why we want to make sure that we are not
[1:29:54] operating in opinion that we are not
[1:29:56] operating in notion that we're not
[1:29:59] operating and feeling we want to make
[1:30:01] sure that we are operating on and by the
[1:30:04] truth of god's word can you say amen
[1:30:08] i didn't hear you
[1:30:10] all right serving the lord in holiness
[1:30:13] it's not just about keeping rules
[1:30:15] it's not just about keeping regulations
[1:30:18] it's not just about measuring everything
[1:30:20] it's about so much more than that it's
[1:30:23] really about your will
[1:30:25] coming into alignment with his will
[1:30:29] lord
[1:30:30] not my will
[1:30:32] you know this is the ultimate victory
[1:30:34] our lord won the ultimate victory in
[1:30:36] gethsemane i know that we say the
[1:30:39] ultimate victory was at the cross that
[1:30:41] was your ultimate victory that was my
[1:30:43] ultimate victory but his ultimate
[1:30:46] victory was one in the garden of
[1:30:48] gethsemane when he said oh if at all
[1:30:50] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:30:53] nevertheless
[1:30:55] i've heard preachers say the most
[1:30:57] powerful word ever spoken was
[1:30:59] nevertheless
[1:31:00] not my will
[1:31:02] but thy will be done
[1:31:05] it was in that moment when he was able
[1:31:09] even though the will of his flesh
[1:31:12] was pulling in one direction and that
[1:31:14] was to live the will the pull of his
[1:31:17] mind and his will and his emotion it was
[1:31:20] pulling him in the direction that said i
[1:31:22] want to finish this i want to live i
[1:31:23] want to continue to minister i want to
[1:31:26] continue to help people on this level
[1:31:28] and yet in in gethsemane in the crushing
[1:31:32] when the olives were being crushed
[1:31:34] when he prayed until great drops of
[1:31:36] blood appeared as as it would just come
[1:31:39] right out of the pores of his body like
[1:31:42] perspiration
[1:31:43] the agony was so intense in the garden
[1:31:46] that medical doctors have examined the
[1:31:48] verses and they believed that the pain
[1:31:50] was so intense not at the cross but in
[1:31:53] the garden that it caused the
[1:31:54] pericardium that that sack of fluid
[1:31:57] around your heart to protect your heart
[1:31:59] when you get jarred around or when you
[1:32:01] move around and athletics or in an
[1:32:04] automobile or whatever that that sack of
[1:32:07] you know you don't even know you have
[1:32:09] one until something goes wrong with it i
[1:32:11] never had mine to burst that's very very
[1:32:13] serious that's death setting in but i
[1:32:16] had an infection one time after after a
[1:32:19] heavy series of meetings in ministry i
[1:32:23] got wore down in my body and i had
[1:32:26] i don't know something like
[1:32:28] mononucleosis i don't know exactly what
[1:32:30] it was uh other than than this that i am
[1:32:33] about to mention but i got so wore down
[1:32:35] that i began to have chest pains and i
[1:32:37] was i was way too young to be thinking
[1:32:39] about that and it was over my heart and
[1:32:42] i thought surely i'm having heart
[1:32:44] trouble i i may be having a heart attack
[1:32:46] and i ended up going to the doctor and
[1:32:48] it was pericarditis it was an
[1:32:50] inflammation and infection in the fluid
[1:32:53] and in that sack around the heart and
[1:32:55] brother i felt it and i don't ever want
[1:32:57] to feel that again but our lord was in
[1:33:00] such agony in the garden of gethsemane
[1:33:03] that they say that pericardium burst and
[1:33:06] that fluid began to run through his body
[1:33:08] mixed with blood and the and the the the
[1:33:12] capillaries of the body begin to burst
[1:33:15] and the blood began to come out like
[1:33:17] sweat would come out he was in great
[1:33:19] agony but i want you to know he won the
[1:33:22] victory he won a personal victory that
[1:33:24] day because he was able hallelujah he
[1:33:28] was able to bring his will in alignment
[1:33:32] to the fathers with not my will but thy
[1:33:35] will be done listen you say i don't
[1:33:38] think i could ever achieve such a thing
[1:33:40] not on your own not on my own but by the
[1:33:42] holy ghost that lives in us by the
[1:33:45] ministry of the spirit of holiness i
[1:33:48] believe
[1:33:50] i believe we can be honed into such a
[1:33:52] place where our will comes into perfect
[1:33:56] alignment with his will remember jesus
[1:33:59] said i can't do anything on my own it's
[1:34:01] only what my father shows me i can do
[1:34:04] you may think i've lost my mind today
[1:34:06] i'm not even looking for your comments
[1:34:09] to see if you're with me or not
[1:34:11] you may think i've lost my mind but i
[1:34:13] believe and i'm going to say it anyway
[1:34:15] i believe with all my heart that there's
[1:34:17] a bride that's being built in this hour
[1:34:19] i believe there's a people that are
[1:34:21] being formed in this hour who are going
[1:34:24] to come into that place where their will
[1:34:27] is in perfect alignment with his will so
[1:34:29] when you think of holiness and the
[1:34:31] spirit of holiness don't just focus on
[1:34:34] the fact that god has called us to
[1:34:35] sanctify ourselves i want you to know
[1:34:37] the bible tells us we should sanctify
[1:34:40] ourselves we should consecrate ourselves
[1:34:42] that word sanctification and
[1:34:44] consecration means set apart so and i'll
[1:34:47] give you these scriptures probably the
[1:34:49] next time we're together uh there are
[1:34:51] many of them
[1:34:52] in leviticus for instance there are
[1:34:54] several places where he tells the people
[1:34:56] you consecrate yourself you sanctify
[1:34:59] yourself which means you set yourselves
[1:35:02] apart
[1:35:04] from all these other things
[1:35:06] you make a conscious decision
[1:35:08] to put yourself apart from many of those
[1:35:11] things and he mentioned some of them
[1:35:13] under the law and in the new testament
[1:35:15] some of these things are mentioned that
[1:35:17] we should set our ourselves apart from
[1:35:20] now
[1:35:21] let me see i have a little more time
[1:35:23] would you turn to
[1:35:26] matthew chapter 23 if you have your
[1:35:28] bible there i want to read uh verse two
[1:35:31] to six
[1:35:32] we're not getting as far along in this
[1:35:35] as i would like to today but i don't
[1:35:37] want to hold you too long because i know
[1:35:38] some of you really need rest you need
[1:35:42] rest for your body
[1:35:45] all right matthew 23 verses 2 and 6
[1:35:48] saying the scribes and the pharisees sit
[1:35:51] in moses seat this is in red letter this
[1:35:55] is jesus
[1:35:56] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[1:35:59] observe
[1:36:00] that observe and do now let's not miss
[1:36:03] where we are jesus is talking about the
[1:36:05] scribes those who knew
[1:36:08] the letter of the law
[1:36:10] because they had copied it
[1:36:13] word for word not word for word letter
[1:36:16] for letter
[1:36:17] did you know that to be a scribe in the
[1:36:20] time of the bible of the scroll some of
[1:36:23] you see this uh behind me and you're
[1:36:25] wondering what it is from time to time
[1:36:27] we have people ask what this is
[1:36:30] but because it's dressed in in some
[1:36:33] velvet there with some words on it and
[1:36:35] people are asking well what in the world
[1:36:36] is that well that is a torah scroll the
[1:36:39] first five books of the bible and this
[1:36:41] particular one was hand carried
[1:36:44] all the way from iraq into jerusalem all
[1:36:49] the way hand carried and it's very very
[1:36:52] old and i feel very very blessed to own
[1:36:56] it now
[1:36:57] in in the time of the bible when scrolls
[1:37:00] like this were made and even today when
[1:37:02] they're made because they're still made
[1:37:04] today for the jewish people to read from
[1:37:06] in the synagogue on shabbat
[1:37:09] and
[1:37:10] when there may if one little mistake
[1:37:13] one little the ink drops on the page the
[1:37:17] whole page is finished there's no
[1:37:19] erasing
[1:37:21] there's no no starting over
[1:37:24] and and just scratching through it like
[1:37:25] we do there's no liquid paper you know
[1:37:28] white out
[1:37:29] the whole page is gone and it has to be
[1:37:31] started so these scribes from the time
[1:37:35] of the second temple they didn't just
[1:37:36] know the the
[1:37:38] the law they knew every letter of the
[1:37:40] law
[1:37:41] they had
[1:37:42] written it down copied it down time and
[1:37:45] time and time again can you imagine
[1:37:47] filling up a whole page and then having
[1:37:49] to start over and do the whole page
[1:37:50] again so they really knew and the
[1:37:52] pharisees they those were the men who
[1:37:55] were dedicated to keeping every letter
[1:37:58] of the law and beyond they they were so
[1:38:00] afraid of missing it they just wanted to
[1:38:02] add to it they just wanted to make sure
[1:38:04] everything was was well
[1:38:06] well under control but they lost their
[1:38:09] relationship because they were focusing
[1:38:12] on the letter and they were missing the
[1:38:14] fact that god was looking to have an
[1:38:16] intimate relationship with his people so
[1:38:19] this is jesus now and he's talking about
[1:38:22] the scribes and the pharisees they sit
[1:38:24] in moses seat which was a place of
[1:38:26] judgment which is a place of of
[1:38:28] authority as the elders of the of the
[1:38:31] community and this was a very important
[1:38:34] concept that we won't take time to talk
[1:38:36] about verse three all therefore
[1:38:38] whatsoever they bid you observe that
[1:38:40] observe and do but do not ye after their
[1:38:44] works
[1:38:46] for they say and do not
[1:38:49] now i want you to hear this is a royal
[1:38:51] rebuke isn't it this is jesus rebuking
[1:38:55] the scribes and the pharisees and yet he
[1:38:58] is telling the congregation
[1:39:00] you do what they say you observe what
[1:39:03] they say
[1:39:05] follow their words but do not follow
[1:39:08] their works
[1:39:10] you must hear what they have to say
[1:39:13] because they speak of the truth but they
[1:39:15] don't behave like the truth
[1:39:18] so jesus is really talking to the
[1:39:22] congregation he's really talking to a
[1:39:24] believer like you and i and he's saying
[1:39:27] what they bid you to observe observe uh
[1:39:30] and what they say do do but do not after
[1:39:33] their works for they say and do not
[1:39:35] verse 4 for they bind heavy burdens
[1:39:39] and grievous to be born and lay them on
[1:39:42] men's shoulders
[1:39:43] but they themselves will not move them
[1:39:47] with one of their fingers they've lost
[1:39:50] their compassion
[1:39:52] they've lost their feeling for people
[1:39:56] they have spent all this time focusing
[1:39:58] on the letter of the law and how to keep
[1:40:01] the letter of the law that they have
[1:40:03] forgotten the needs of the people they
[1:40:05] have forgotten to show any compassion or
[1:40:08] any love and they won't move any of
[1:40:10] those heavy burdens they just keep
[1:40:11] piling them on no matter regardless of
[1:40:14] the circumstances
[1:40:16] they had no mercy for those you know
[1:40:18] jesus had mercy he didn't come
[1:40:20] destroying the law but he had mercy he
[1:40:23] said my if you're if your donkey's in a
[1:40:25] ditch you got to pull it out
[1:40:27] if you're hungry you've got to pluck and
[1:40:30] eat
[1:40:31] and uh even though the law says this
[1:40:33] when you're in a place of desperation
[1:40:35] now
[1:40:37] the old preachers that i grew up with
[1:40:38] they said now jesus didn't mean you
[1:40:41] could shove your donkey into it so you
[1:40:43] could pull it out on sunday
[1:40:45] they used to talk about people all the
[1:40:47] time volunteering to work in miss church
[1:40:49] and they said see these people think
[1:40:51] they're standing on the word but they're
[1:40:53] they're guilty of pushing the donkey in
[1:40:55] so they can pull him out on sunday and
[1:40:57] they used to say jesus wasn't talking
[1:40:59] about that and indeed he was not
[1:41:01] but all their works they do here's the
[1:41:04] key but all their works they do for to
[1:41:08] be seen of men
[1:41:10] they make broad their phylacteries
[1:41:13] and enlarge the borders of their
[1:41:16] garments
[1:41:19] and love the uppermost rooms at feast
[1:41:22] and the chief seats in the synagogues
[1:41:26] this is jesus saying what they say is
[1:41:30] right listen to what they say but do not
[1:41:35] do it like they do it because they say
[1:41:38] it and they never do it
[1:41:41] jesus wanted the believer to not only
[1:41:44] talk it but to walk it
[1:41:46] not only to declare it but to live it
[1:41:49] and that's where character comes in
[1:41:51] because i want you to know you can fool
[1:41:53] people when you're around people but
[1:41:55] there's a set of all seeing eyes and god
[1:41:58] knows us when there's nobody looking but
[1:42:00] us
[1:42:01] what you do in the darkness what you do
[1:42:04] with no one looking around is a better
[1:42:07] reflection of your character than what
[1:42:09] you do when everybody's looking jesus
[1:42:11] said these men are doing a lot of
[1:42:13] religious stuff
[1:42:15] lots of religious stuff but they're
[1:42:17] doing it to be seen of men and it is
[1:42:21] holiness let me just say holiness is
[1:42:25] never so that you can make yourself
[1:42:27] appear holy
[1:42:29] it's never so that you when when you
[1:42:31] choose to dress a certain way because
[1:42:33] you want to reflect a sanctified and set
[1:42:35] apart life you're doing that as unto the
[1:42:37] lord you're doing that to cause people
[1:42:40] to see you that's why so many times
[1:42:43] through the years
[1:42:44] when we've been out in public
[1:42:46] not even thinking right that moment of
[1:42:48] the things of the lord i remember a time
[1:42:50] we were somewhere visit i don't remember
[1:42:52] exactly where we were except in the mall
[1:42:54] might have been in atlanta somewhere i
[1:42:56] just remember my little family and i
[1:42:57] think judith sister judith was with us
[1:42:59] if i remember correctly and we were just
[1:43:01] walking through a mall and all of a
[1:43:03] sudden i looked down and there was a
[1:43:04] woman standing between me and my wife
[1:43:06] and we were walking kind of brisk we
[1:43:08] were walking kind of brisk through the
[1:43:10] mall
[1:43:11] and this little lady just walked right
[1:43:13] up between us and was walking with us
[1:43:15] well we never slowed down and i thought
[1:43:17] well she's trying to pass between us
[1:43:19] she's trying to get between us
[1:43:21] and uh all of a sudden i could tell she
[1:43:24] wanted to say something and we just
[1:43:26] slowed down a little bit and she looked
[1:43:28] come and she said oh i used to be what
[1:43:30] you all are
[1:43:32] she said i used to walk with god like
[1:43:34] you all walk with god and she said i i
[1:43:38] just i i've just forsaken that i'm just
[1:43:41] not walking with the lord i said to her
[1:43:43] what i say to everybody who approaches
[1:43:46] me that way and i said ma'am it's not
[1:43:48] too late
[1:43:49] you can go right back to where you left
[1:43:52] off and you can set every wrong right
[1:43:55] and you can follow him the way you have
[1:43:56] once followed him and we stopped and had
[1:43:59] a conversation with that little lady one
[1:44:02] time we were standing in an amusement
[1:44:03] park with our family and a woman walked
[1:44:06] up like that and began to just confess
[1:44:08] her heart i used to serve god that way
[1:44:11] and never even asking us what we what
[1:44:14] our faith was now i know for sure
[1:44:17] that she saw a difference in the way we
[1:44:19] appeared the way we were living on the
[1:44:22] outside she noticed my wife she noticed
[1:44:25] a sister that was with us she saw that
[1:44:27] was different but i want you to know i
[1:44:29] know it was more than that because i
[1:44:32] know that a lot of times you see people
[1:44:33] out like that and they won't even smile
[1:44:35] at you you see women with their hair
[1:44:37] fixed just right and men looking clean
[1:44:40] and holy before and they won't even say
[1:44:41] hello
[1:44:42] i know there was something else that
[1:44:44] drew that woman to us i want you to
[1:44:46] understand i believe how we present
[1:44:48] ourselves out there is vitally important
[1:44:52] because it's one of the things that god
[1:44:54] uses to draw people to us when they see
[1:44:58] that we have set ourselves apart but
[1:45:00] don't you ever brother sister get to a
[1:45:03] place where you think that is what makes
[1:45:05] you holy don't ever get to a place
[1:45:08] church where you think that is what
[1:45:10] makes me right with god because i keep
[1:45:13] the standard because i follow a
[1:45:15] conviction because i i try to do what
[1:45:17] the church is teaching don't ever think
[1:45:20] that your holiness comes from that it
[1:45:22] comes from the word it comes from
[1:45:24] following jesus christ it comes from
[1:45:27] imparted righteousness it's his holiness
[1:45:30] it's his righteousness that's been
[1:45:32] imparted to us salvation is not of works
[1:45:35] lest any man should boast however
[1:45:38] there's a blessing coming i believe with
[1:45:40] all of my heart if you choose to walk
[1:45:42] before god sanctified and set apart
[1:45:46] i believe with all my heart that if you
[1:45:48] choose to let your behavior reflect
[1:45:51] christ let your dress
[1:45:54] reflect christ let the way you treat
[1:45:56] people in the world
[1:45:58] reflect christ
[1:46:00] how you treat people that pass you on
[1:46:02] the highway
[1:46:03] how you treat people in the line who cut
[1:46:06] in line to get in front of you i believe
[1:46:08] every one of those things testify of the
[1:46:11] real character
[1:46:12] that christ wants to build in us and
[1:46:14] that is a character that reflects him so
[1:46:17] you may you may have all the outward
[1:46:20] things right you you may get everything
[1:46:22] in line uh like the pharisees and
[1:46:25] scribes but jesus was after more than a
[1:46:29] people who would measure up externally
[1:46:32] i believe it's important don't you
[1:46:34] misunderstand this preacher
[1:46:36] but jesus was after more than just a
[1:46:40] people who would measure up externally
[1:46:43] he was after a people who would measure
[1:46:46] up by letting the spirit of holiness
[1:46:49] reflect and build in them the holiness
[1:46:53] of god i'm telling you
[1:46:55] in order for a bride to function in the
[1:46:58] authority
[1:46:59] i guess i better hurry now
[1:47:01] in order for a bride to function in the
[1:47:03] authority that god is calling her to
[1:47:05] function in she's going to have to first
[1:47:07] have his character his life formed
[1:47:11] inside of her this is so vitally
[1:47:14] important because there's a temptation
[1:47:16] to fix up the external to fix up the
[1:47:19] outside and not worry and not deal with
[1:47:22] the inside oh it's better to get it in
[1:47:24] the right order and let god do something
[1:47:26] on the inside see jesus said all they
[1:47:29] were doing was to be seen of men
[1:47:32] therefore it was more about pride than
[1:47:35] anything else
[1:47:36] oh they like to wear their robes long
[1:47:39] they like to enlarge the borders of
[1:47:41] their garments which which had to do
[1:47:44] with the zit seat
[1:47:45] they like to make that big and wide and
[1:47:48] and show that you know a man's a man was
[1:47:51] sometimes esteemed by the border of his
[1:47:53] garment
[1:47:54] and that's why we're told by many people
[1:47:56] that jesus wore a garment without a a
[1:47:58] border without a hymn
[1:48:00] is that perhaps there's words there that
[1:48:03] make us think that his garment was an
[1:48:05] unhemmed garment had no border on it but
[1:48:08] those religious men they would just
[1:48:09] start raising the hem of their garment
[1:48:11] making a bigger and bigger border at the
[1:48:13] bottom so that you could see more of
[1:48:15] their of their form of religion
[1:48:18] what they were trying to do and they
[1:48:20] made their phylacteries bigger the you
[1:48:22] know the things that that they would put
[1:48:25] between their their eyes on their
[1:48:27] forehead and bind as the scripture told
[1:48:30] them in the old testament to bind these
[1:48:32] things
[1:48:33] and we see the jews doing the same thing
[1:48:35] today as they pray setting these uh to
[1:48:39] feel them on their on their forehead and
[1:48:42] wrapping it on their arm but men got
[1:48:44] carried away and they wanted to make
[1:48:46] them wider and and bigger and more
[1:48:49] noticeable they were doing it to be seen
[1:48:52] instead of to reflect christ and jesus
[1:48:55] was upset i'm telling you he rebuked
[1:48:57] them it was about pride more than
[1:49:00] anything else it had very little to do
[1:49:01] with pleasing god i want to tell you
[1:49:04] right now that is not true holiness
[1:49:08] holiness is often misunderstood i want
[1:49:11] to set the record straight that what you
[1:49:14] do only to be seen of man
[1:49:16] because of the of the pride of your own
[1:49:19] life you want to be seen as religious
[1:49:21] you want to be seen as holy those things
[1:49:24] are not pleasing to god in fact they
[1:49:26] have real no no real value or merit in
[1:49:29] the kingdom at all this is what we end
[1:49:31] up producing when we try to make
[1:49:33] ourselves holy instead of letting the
[1:49:35] holy ghost do that in us and through us
[1:49:38] we get an idea if i do this then i'll be
[1:49:41] more holy oh i'm telling you that's not
[1:49:44] where true holiness comes from no siree
[1:49:49] let me read you a quotation uh it's uh
[1:49:52] it's about 15 minutes to one so i have a
[1:49:55] little more time about i'll take at
[1:49:57] least another 15 minutes and we won't go
[1:49:59] much beyond that and you know that's
[1:50:01] good for me i'm normally here to two but
[1:50:04] i'm going to try my best
[1:50:06] not to go too far
[1:50:08] beyond this
[1:50:09] let me read paragraph 120 from from
[1:50:12] satan's eden
[1:50:14] uh
[1:50:15] let me just show you some things from
[1:50:18] the message here that fit right along
[1:50:20] with where the true holiness is he said
[1:50:23] compare this now how much alike that man
[1:50:26] and his wife both in god's eden without
[1:50:30] one stitch of clothes on them and knew
[1:50:33] it not
[1:50:34] he's talking about adam and eve isn't he
[1:50:36] for they didn't they
[1:50:38] for why didn't they know it for they
[1:50:41] were veiled
[1:50:42] to their senses of nakedness
[1:50:45] by the holy veil
[1:50:47] of the holy spirit
[1:50:49] they couldn't even see
[1:50:51] they couldn't even discern
[1:50:54] they had no sense of good and evil they
[1:50:57] had no knowledge of good and evil
[1:51:00] for them it was all good what god had
[1:51:03] provided was all good they had not dealt
[1:51:06] with the temptation of sin they didn't
[1:51:08] know there was a darkness lurking in the
[1:51:10] garden they didn't know that beyond the
[1:51:13] the protective
[1:51:15] area of the garden that lay in eden they
[1:51:17] didn't know that there were many many
[1:51:19] things out there and that they were soon
[1:51:21] going to experience them all he said
[1:51:23] they could look right at each other and
[1:51:25] they didn't know they were naked they
[1:51:26] were veiled with the holy spirit of
[1:51:30] holiness
[1:51:31] they
[1:51:32] were veiled he said god's veil yet today
[1:51:37] can look and not lust
[1:51:40] they turn their head it's a holy veil
[1:51:43] see holy veil god had their eyes they
[1:51:47] were both one was man the other was
[1:51:49] woman and they did not know they were
[1:51:51] naked because the holiness of god kept
[1:51:55] their eyes veiled notice
[1:51:59] god hid their conscious from sin
[1:52:03] by the holy veil
[1:52:06] the prophet is telling us that even in
[1:52:09] the garden of eden the spirit of
[1:52:11] holiness
[1:52:12] was operating in adam and eve in such a
[1:52:16] manner that they could not even
[1:52:18] recognize that they were naked what's
[1:52:20] naked
[1:52:22] they were covered by the holy veil of
[1:52:24] god's holiness and then of course you
[1:52:27] know that veil was removed
[1:52:30] because of what took place in the garden
[1:52:33] of eden and we're working hard we're
[1:52:35] pushing our way through in faith to come
[1:52:38] back to a place where the spirit of
[1:52:40] holiness is so operating on the inside
[1:52:43] let me tell you something this is what
[1:52:45] he's talking about this is what we need
[1:52:47] in this hour
[1:52:49] we need such a manifestation of the
[1:52:51] spirit of holiness
[1:52:52] operating in us that if a man should
[1:52:55] come along and somehow without expecting
[1:52:58] to without intending to without trying
[1:53:01] to
[1:53:02] i don't mean someone searching
[1:53:03] pornography but i mean someone coming
[1:53:06] across something like that
[1:53:08] but such a work of holiness going on in
[1:53:11] their life and some picture flash up or
[1:53:13] they see listen it was reported that a
[1:53:16] woman was walking down the highway
[1:53:19] maybe out of her head i don't know but i
[1:53:21] read just where right in our town
[1:53:24] there was a woman walking up the side
[1:53:26] the road no clothes on whatsoever just
[1:53:28] walking up naked i i i don't understand
[1:53:31] what was maybe going on with her but if
[1:53:34] a man should see something like that
[1:53:37] there is a work of holiness the spirit
[1:53:39] of holiness by the holy ghost in that
[1:53:41] man that he could see that and turn his
[1:53:43] head
[1:53:44] not choose to look at something like
[1:53:47] that even though the opportunity was
[1:53:48] there maybe even nobody would know
[1:53:51] but he would choose not to take a second
[1:53:53] glance
[1:53:55] i won't even look back at that
[1:53:57] why
[1:53:58] because there was no lust he was he was
[1:54:01] yielding to the spirit of holiness
[1:54:03] instead of yielding to the temptation of
[1:54:05] lust he didn't want to set himself on a
[1:54:07] collision course for a whole lot more
[1:54:10] sin and a whole lot more heartache so he
[1:54:12] saw it and he never even allowed the
[1:54:15] lust to begin to form he turned his head
[1:54:18] you know brother branham talked about
[1:54:19] hanging the cross from his rear view
[1:54:21] mirror because of the things you'd see
[1:54:23] just driving down the road when i see
[1:54:25] something like that i looked to the
[1:54:26] cross what was he doing he was trying to
[1:54:28] yield to the spirit of holiness that was
[1:54:32] present in him by the holy ghost and
[1:54:34] shut out every opportunity for the enemy
[1:54:37] to come and contaminate your mind and
[1:54:39] draw you into the filth of this world i
[1:54:42] believe god's working that kind of work
[1:54:44] in people i believe there are people who
[1:54:46] are under the influence of the spirit of
[1:54:48] holiness and if they should see
[1:54:49] something like that could absolutely
[1:54:51] turn away from it and never even desire
[1:54:54] to take the second look
[1:54:56] is that common
[1:54:57] are there more people like that
[1:54:59] than than the ret no i don't think it's
[1:55:02] all that common but i think that's what
[1:55:03] god's doing in his people and i think if
[1:55:06] you're not there yet
[1:55:07] you're certainly moving in the right
[1:55:09] direction if you understand
[1:55:12] that the holy ghost is present in us to
[1:55:16] bring about that spirit of holiness
[1:55:18] to help shape and form and mold our
[1:55:20] character and our will to the character
[1:55:23] and the will of jesus christ and never
[1:55:25] go back listen everybody faces
[1:55:27] temptation in one way or another but
[1:55:29] you've got somebody on board this holy
[1:55:31] ghost
[1:55:32] is living inside of you to help you not
[1:55:34] to even take the second look
[1:55:36] my old granny used to say something you
[1:55:38] probably wouldn't agree with it but she
[1:55:40] used to say something like this she said
[1:55:42] you know it's not the first case
[1:55:45] it's not the first fifth
[1:55:46] that makes a man alcoholic
[1:55:49] it's the drop it's the first drop
[1:55:52] she said if he sets his she was talking
[1:55:54] about people who had come to know the
[1:55:55] lord too
[1:55:57] she said if he sets his mind
[1:55:59] towards something it's like pitching
[1:56:01] your tent towards sodom
[1:56:03] if he says i mean i can handle it i can
[1:56:05] handle it i know i can handle it i'm a
[1:56:07] strong man i'm a big man i can handle
[1:56:09] that and so i can just take a little
[1:56:10] drink i'm i'm tired i've worked hard
[1:56:12] today i'm just going to take a little
[1:56:14] drink i want you to know my granny felt
[1:56:16] like that was the worst thing that man
[1:56:17] could do not only did she think it was
[1:56:19] wrong she thought that was preparing
[1:56:21] himself to go down the road that he had
[1:56:24] no business going down that's not the
[1:56:25] only time he's ever going to be tired
[1:56:27] that's not the only time he's not ever
[1:56:29] going to look for something to ease his
[1:56:30] nerves or or calm him arrest him or
[1:56:32] something and what it develops in
[1:56:34] somebody like that is that slippery
[1:56:36] slope oh my that takes you farther sin
[1:56:39] will take you farther than you really
[1:56:40] want to go and it'll leave you there
[1:56:42] longer than you really want to stay this
[1:56:44] is how temptation works but i want you
[1:56:46] to know as believers we not only have
[1:56:48] forgiveness through the blood and grace
[1:56:50] of jesus christ but we have the holy
[1:56:52] ghost resident
[1:56:54] in us to help us
[1:56:57] come to a place where if the temptation
[1:56:59] was laid right there in our lap and
[1:57:01] someone could guarantee us
[1:57:04] no one will ever know what you do
[1:57:07] that there would be enough of god enough
[1:57:09] of the holy ghost enough of the spirit
[1:57:11] of holiness operating in us that we
[1:57:14] would still turn never take the second
[1:57:16] look never go back to revisit what the
[1:57:19] enemy had put before us we're going to
[1:57:21] opera there's going to be a bride
[1:57:23] operating
[1:57:24] i think she's here
[1:57:26] i think there are more that need to
[1:57:28] catch up but i think she's here i think
[1:57:31] there's a people being molded
[1:57:34] being shaped being fashioned into the
[1:57:37] character of jesus christ that's what
[1:57:39] the word has accomplished on our behalf
[1:57:42] can i give you one more thank you
[1:57:46] i didn't wait for you it happens to be
[1:57:47] another one from the church ages
[1:57:49] philadelphia and church age
[1:57:52] let's see if we have it yes they sought
[1:57:54] their righteousness
[1:57:56] after the law
[1:57:58] and failed miserably here that's what we
[1:58:00] were talking about in matthew's gospel
[1:58:02] they sought their righteousness after
[1:58:04] the law and failed miserably for by the
[1:58:07] law can no flesh be justified by the law
[1:58:10] can no man be made holy holiness
[1:58:14] is of the lord
[1:58:17] first corinthians 1 30 but of him are ye
[1:58:21] in christ jesus
[1:58:23] who of god is made unto us wisdom
[1:58:27] and righteousness and sanctification
[1:58:30] and redemption oh hallelujah i got to
[1:58:34] read that again but of him are ye in
[1:58:36] christ jesus
[1:58:38] who of god is made unto us
[1:58:41] wisdom
[1:58:42] and righteousness and sanctification
[1:58:46] and redemption second corinthians 5
[1:58:50] 21 the second part of that verse
[1:58:54] that we might be
[1:58:56] made
[1:58:57] the righteousness of god in him
[1:59:01] it was christ
[1:59:03] or perish
[1:59:04] and they perished for they refused him
[1:59:08] and men of that age
[1:59:12] even today
[1:59:14] were making this ass even today and men
[1:59:17] of that age as
[1:59:18] even today were making the same mistake
[1:59:24] as the jews took refuge in the synagogue
[1:59:27] form of worship so in the philadelphian
[1:59:30] age they were taking refuge in the
[1:59:32] church
[1:59:33] oh listen
[1:59:34] it is not joining a church that counts
[1:59:36] that doesn't mean that you don't have to
[1:59:38] have fellowship in a church but it's not
[1:59:41] joining the church that counts the life
[1:59:44] is not in the church the life is in
[1:59:48] christ
[1:59:50] oh
[1:59:51] i have to say amen
[1:59:53] i have to say amen this is the record
[1:59:56] that god hath given us
[1:59:58] to us
[2:00:00] eternal life and this life is in his son
[2:00:03] he that hath the son hath life and he
[2:00:07] that hath not the son of god hath not
[2:00:09] life listen at this next sentence i
[2:00:12] agree with it wholeheartedly
[2:00:15] man
[2:00:18] man is made holy
[2:00:21] by
[2:00:22] the spirit
[2:00:25] man is made holy
[2:00:27] by
[2:00:28] the spirit
[2:00:30] let's read on a moment
[2:00:31] it is the spirit
[2:00:34] of holiness
[2:00:36] this is what we read in romans 1 when we
[2:00:38] were beginning
[2:00:40] it is the spirit of holiness that raised
[2:00:43] jesus from the dead
[2:00:45] that indwells us
[2:00:47] and makes us holy how
[2:00:50] with his holiness
[2:00:51] oh
[2:00:52] i got to read it again i'm sorry i have
[2:00:54] to read that one more time
[2:00:56] it is the spirit of holiness that raised
[2:00:59] jesus from the dead
[2:01:00] put your finger there a minute you say
[2:01:02] how in the world can you say that that's
[2:01:04] what the bible said
[2:01:06] in romans 1 3 and 4 concerning his son
[2:01:08] jesus christ our lord which was made of
[2:01:10] the seed of david according to the flesh
[2:01:12] and declared to be the son of god with
[2:01:15] power according to the spirit of
[2:01:17] holiness by the resurrection from the
[2:01:19] dead
[2:01:20] so this spirit of holiness manifested
[2:01:23] and brought about this glorious
[2:01:25] resurrection it is the spirit of
[2:01:27] holiness that raised jesus from the dead
[2:01:29] that indwells us and makes us holy how
[2:01:32] with his holiness there he stands the
[2:01:35] holy one
[2:01:37] and we will stand with him yes we will
[2:01:40] clothed in his righteousness holy
[2:01:44] with his holiness there is a bride oh
[2:01:47] yes you tell this wicked world
[2:01:51] you tell this world that has compromised
[2:01:54] the word of god
[2:01:55] you tell this world that that's
[2:01:58] wondering whether a person a baby born
[2:02:01] is male or female or 11 dozen other
[2:02:04] genders you tell this world that has
[2:02:07] called right wrong and wrong right
[2:02:10] you tell this world that has left its
[2:02:12] natural affection and yielded itself to
[2:02:16] unholy and unnatural desires
[2:02:18] and lust you tell this world that is
[2:02:21] more concerned about somebody wearing a
[2:02:23] mask than murdering babies in the womb
[2:02:26] you tell this world that there is a
[2:02:30] people that are being clothed in the
[2:02:34] holiness of the holy one
[2:02:37] they're not always perfect in their life
[2:02:40] they're not always perfect in their
[2:02:42] choices but they have received an
[2:02:45] imparted righteousness
[2:02:48] they have received an imparted holiness
[2:02:52] and that holiness of him is working in
[2:02:55] them to bring them to a place where they
[2:02:57] can make the constant and consistent
[2:03:00] decision i choose the word i choose the
[2:03:02] word i choose the word i won't yield to
[2:03:05] the nakedness that is on display before
[2:03:08] me i won't yield to how easy it is to
[2:03:11] hide my secret sin
[2:03:13] i won't yield because i'm being clothed
[2:03:16] whoa i feel good i'm being clothed with
[2:03:19] the righteousness of him who has only
[2:03:22] ever been holy he's never been anything
[2:03:25] but holy ah one more
[2:03:29] 101 one more
[2:03:30] i got to get this one in it's one of my
[2:03:32] favorite quotations and i got to get it
[2:03:35] in
[2:03:36] and we'll come back at least one more
[2:03:38] session
[2:03:39] on the spirit of holiness
[2:03:40] what shall i do with jesus call christ
[2:03:43] 1963
[2:03:45] the dynamics
[2:03:47] of this church what church the end time
[2:03:50] bride church
[2:03:52] is that the denominational church no sir
[2:03:57] it's the holy ghost church
[2:03:59] it's that church that he had on his mind
[2:04:02] before the foundation of the world
[2:04:04] and it's not in a building
[2:04:06] it's not in a geographical location it's
[2:04:09] a universal bride it's abroad all over
[2:04:12] the world called by the word of the hour
[2:04:15] called by the holy ghost to truth
[2:04:18] to come out of compromise to come out of
[2:04:21] lethargy to come out of religion to come
[2:04:24] out of pride to come out of a sense of
[2:04:26] i've got to make myself holy
[2:04:29] and come to the reality that the only
[2:04:32] way you can be holy is to yield to him
[2:04:34] and the more you yield to him the better
[2:04:36] choices you make and the more you yield
[2:04:39] to him the more modest the lady wants to
[2:04:41] be she wants to cover her body she does
[2:04:44] not want to be you say this you make
[2:04:45] people mad but she does not want to be
[2:04:48] the object of somebody's lust she is
[2:04:50] saving herself for her husband she has
[2:04:53] no desire to draw the attention of men
[2:04:56] to the form of her body because she
[2:04:58] doesn't have to be frumpy
[2:05:00] no no she doesn't have to be frumpy she
[2:05:02] doesn't have to look like uh uh
[2:05:06] i might not ought to say what i thought
[2:05:08] to say
[2:05:10] she doesn't have to look like
[2:05:12] something left over from from last
[2:05:14] year's thrift sale no no no no no
[2:05:16] she's reflecting the king
[2:05:19] she doesn't have to look frumpy she
[2:05:21] doesn't have to look stale and outdated
[2:05:23] she just desires to be holy she just
[2:05:26] desires to be modest she desires to be a
[2:05:28] reflection of jesus christ she doesn't
[2:05:31] want all kinds of holes and tears and
[2:05:33] rips and things that you can peekaboos
[2:05:35] and things you can see through she
[2:05:36] doesn't want that not because she's
[2:05:39] afraid of the church or her pastor but
[2:05:41] because she wants to reflect jesus she
[2:05:43] does not want to be the object of
[2:05:45] somebody's lust she wants to be a
[2:05:48] reflection of the love of god if she
[2:05:50] draws anybody she wants to draw them to
[2:05:52] christ and not to herself and a man the
[2:05:55] same way a man who wears his jeans too
[2:05:57] tight has got the same kind of spirit on
[2:05:59] him he needs to be a little more careful
[2:06:02] about the way he displays his body as
[2:06:04] well because he doesn't want to be the
[2:06:05] object of somebody else's attention or
[2:06:08] affection he doesn't want to be drawing
[2:06:10] eyes to him he wants to be drawing eyes
[2:06:12] to jesus christ oh i wish you'd help me
[2:06:15] i don't know if you're helping me maybe
[2:06:17] uh maybe folks are turning that's too
[2:06:20] old-fashioned preaching for me i don't
[2:06:21] want no part of that well i want to tell
[2:06:23] you something he's going to have a bride
[2:06:25] he has her he has a bribe and she wants
[2:06:28] to reflect him
[2:06:30] the dynamics of this church will be a
[2:06:33] refilling of the holy spirit
[2:06:36] oh god we need it
[2:06:39] we need a refilling of the holy ghost
[2:06:41] would you tell him would you tell him
[2:06:43] right where you are as the musicians
[2:06:45] begin to make their way here for us to
[2:06:47] worship before we
[2:06:49] sign off today
[2:06:50] oh we need a revealing of the holy ghost
[2:06:53] why don't you make it personal and say
[2:06:55] oh lord i
[2:06:57] need a refilling
[2:06:58] of the holy ghost
[2:07:00] he said here in this message the
[2:07:02] dynamics of this church will be a
[2:07:04] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[2:07:07] have worked in a small measure while the
[2:07:10] headstone
[2:07:11] is coming down
[2:07:13] to unite with the body whoa
[2:07:17] what is it it's zechariah's prophecy
[2:07:21] it's the headstone
[2:07:23] it's the capstone
[2:07:25] it's jesus christ the living word coming
[2:07:30] down to unite himself to his wife to his
[2:07:35] bride and what she has operated in in a
[2:07:40] small measure
[2:07:41] while the headstone was coming down whoa
[2:07:45] to unite with the body listen to this
[2:07:47] but when that head
[2:07:50] christ
[2:07:51] and body the virgin bride when
[2:07:55] the head and the body unites together
[2:07:58] the full
[2:08:00] power
[2:08:01] somebody say full power
[2:08:04] the full power of the holy ghost
[2:08:06] hallelujah
[2:08:08] praise his name
[2:08:11] whoa
[2:08:12] the full power
[2:08:15] hallelujah
[2:08:17] i'm coming back to you in a minute
[2:08:19] the full power of the holy ghost
[2:08:22] would raise her up
[2:08:24] just exactly like that
[2:08:27] even the dead
[2:08:30] even the dead
[2:08:33] that's in christ
[2:08:35] or hundreds of years ago
[2:08:38] will rise i i got to read it again i got
[2:08:40] distracted
[2:08:42] my watch started talking to me
[2:08:44] and it was trying to search for raising
[2:08:46] the dead
[2:08:48] siri thought i was uh that i was trying
[2:08:51] to do a search on raising the dead
[2:08:53] so let me just read it carefully here
[2:08:55] but when the head and body unites
[2:08:57] together the full power of the holy
[2:08:59] ghost would raise her up just exactly
[2:09:01] like that even the dead that's dead in
[2:09:04] christ for hundreds of years ago will
[2:09:06] rise
[2:09:07] how is that bride going to rise she's
[2:09:10] going to ride this rise the same way the
[2:09:12] lord jesus christ did which we just read
[2:09:14] in romans 1.
[2:09:16] she's going to rise in the beauty
[2:09:20] whoa of her works
[2:09:23] no
[2:09:24] she will rise in the beauty of his
[2:09:29] holiness
[2:09:30] and take of light to the skies
[2:09:34] the dynamics
[2:09:36] is the holy spirit whoa
[2:09:39] you say i i don't know about what all
[2:09:41] that spirit of holiness is about well
[2:09:43] that spirit of holiness is trying to
[2:09:45] bring you and i to a full measure of his
[2:09:49] holiness
[2:09:51] so that our decisions and our choices
[2:09:53] and our lifestyle begins to be an
[2:09:55] overflow of who he is his holiness
[2:09:57] imparted to us
[2:10:00] but that spirit of holiness doesn't
[2:10:02] leave us when we get to that place he
[2:10:05] stays around in us and through us
[2:10:06] because one of these days the bride of
[2:10:09] jesus christ is going to rise in the
[2:10:11] resurrection in the spirit
[2:10:14] of his holiness
[2:10:18] his righteousness
[2:10:20] not what we have worked for
[2:10:23] but what we have yielded to i want to
[2:10:25] say that again
[2:10:27] not what we have worked for
[2:10:30] but what we have yielded to
[2:10:33] he is holy
[2:10:35] he is holy
[2:10:38] he is worthy he he's wonderful to be
[2:10:42] praised
[2:10:44] you and i are so blessed
[2:10:46] my brother sister my friend we are so
[2:10:49] blessed
[2:10:50] i say so many times everything that he
[2:10:53] has required of us
[2:10:55] he has provided for us
[2:10:57] he said i'm going to have a holy people
[2:10:59] what did he do he put the spirit of
[2:11:01] holiness by the holy ghost in the
[2:11:04] believer
[2:11:05] to work in us not just to show us what's
[2:11:08] wrong but to also show us what's right
[2:11:12] to manifest in us what is right to shape
[2:11:16] and form our character
[2:11:18] until we are bearing the character and
[2:11:20] the attributes of jesus christ are we
[2:11:23] all there potentially yes
[2:11:26] potentially we are
[2:11:28] but not always in the manifestation or
[2:11:31] in the reality so we're marching forward
[2:11:35] we're marching forward we're going into
[2:11:37] the kingdom through the door of
[2:11:38] suffering
[2:11:39] we are marching forward to be made into
[2:11:42] his image
[2:11:44] to yield ourselves to his holiness to
[2:11:46] his righteousness to his likeness i want
[2:11:49] us to worship the lord before we go
[2:11:51] today
[2:11:52] i want us to reflect on his holiness how
[2:11:55] wonderful he is
[2:11:57] how great it is to serve a living god
[2:11:59] we want to lift him up he's worthy to be
[2:12:02] praised so if you can stay with us a few
[2:12:04] more moments please do that and let's
[2:12:06] spend some time
[2:12:07] in worship right now if we could i don't
[2:12:09] know what you've got picked but
[2:12:11] just sing it and
[2:12:13] if there's not anything in it about holy
[2:12:15] or righteous we'll try to find something
[2:12:17] in a minute too but you just lead us in
[2:12:19] whatever you have there we're going to
[2:12:21] use this time to worship the lord

[2:12:45] and died for me
[2:12:48] [Music]

[2:28:09] i want to remind you that we will go
[2:28:12] back through the comments
[2:28:14] we will get your prayer request
[2:28:17] and i promise you
[2:28:18] that i will pray and i know there are
[2:28:20] members of this church
[2:28:22] that will go back over these comments
[2:28:24] and they will call your need before the
[2:28:26] lord i'm sure of that because we have
[2:28:29] some real prayer warriors in our church
[2:28:32] and i will do it myself
[2:28:35] so you can continue to add your prayer
[2:28:37] request
[2:28:38] through the afternoon if you want to
[2:28:40] come back to it and put them there
[2:28:42] i go back and read every comment
[2:28:44] and if there's a prayer request i've
[2:28:46] been faithful to the best of my ability
[2:28:48] to call that before the lord because i
[2:28:50] know there's power in agreement
[2:28:52] and i know if we come together believing
[2:28:54] we've seen god do some mighty things for
[2:28:57] those that we have been praying for
[2:28:59] we know people in other places in other
[2:29:01] congregations that have come right back
[2:29:03] from the brink of death
[2:29:05] and are already beginning to show such
[2:29:07] great signs of recovery for the glory of
[2:29:10] god what's the explanation god just
[2:29:12] wasn't through with them
[2:29:14] they had not run their course here on
[2:29:16] this earth
[2:29:17] they have yet something to do
[2:29:20] and we're going to be here i tell you
[2:29:21] you're going to be here exactly to the
[2:29:23] time
[2:29:24] until the moment that god has designed
[2:29:26] and desired to take you to be with him
[2:29:29] we're praying for the rest of you who
[2:29:30] are fighting these awful symptoms
[2:29:33] we're believing that you will have no
[2:29:35] long-term
[2:29:36] side effects and i encourage you not to
[2:29:39] spend a lot of time on google
[2:29:41] to read about all the things that can
[2:29:42] linger and all the things you can have
[2:29:44] for years i would say the devil is a
[2:29:47] liar it was god who is bringing me
[2:29:50] through this who has brought me through
[2:29:51] this and it's his healing power it's
[2:29:54] going to take care of every side effect
[2:29:57] and every
[2:29:58] lingering effect that the enemy would
[2:30:00] desire to keep placing on my body we're
[2:30:03] whole
[2:30:04] because jesus has paid the price to make
[2:30:07] us whole father i pray right now
[2:30:10] in the wonderful name of the lord jesus
[2:30:12] christ for every believer
[2:30:14] watching this program right now this
[2:30:16] service as it goes out if there's one
[2:30:19] person that doesn't know you as lord and
[2:30:21] savior i pray that in this moment they
[2:30:24] would surrender their life they would
[2:30:26] repent of their sin and they would yield
[2:30:29] to you to come in and fill them with who
[2:30:32] you are
[2:30:34] and with the wonderful power of the holy
[2:30:36] ghost
[2:30:37] lord i pray again for those battling the
[2:30:40] virus that they come through with the
[2:30:43] victory and that on the other end of
[2:30:45] this they will have a praise like
[2:30:47] they've never had before may they come
[2:30:50] out with an understanding of how
[2:30:52] gracious and how good and how merciful
[2:30:56] you have been in their lives lord every
[2:31:00] unspoken request we lift it up to you
[2:31:02] right now and every request that has
[2:31:05] come in on these different platforms i
[2:31:08] lift them up right now until i can go
[2:31:11] and read each one i lift these needs
[2:31:13] before you right now in the mighty name
[2:31:17] of the lord jesus christ i expect that
[2:31:20] there's going to be changes made and
[2:31:22] differences made because of the prayer
[2:31:25] of faith because of us binding together
[2:31:28] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[2:31:30] love you that's that's why we have made
[2:31:33] the decision to open the services for
[2:31:36] many many many years
[2:31:38] we were by registration only and uh who
[2:31:42] knows what the future holds there may
[2:31:44] come a time that we are forced to go
[2:31:46] back to such a a system as that but the
[2:31:49] lord placed a burden on two brothers
[2:31:51] hearts who work in this ministry that we
[2:31:54] should let this be expanded let the
[2:31:57] critics criticize and let the believers
[2:31:59] be blessed and so that is what we have
[2:32:02] done and it's because we love you
[2:32:04] and it's because we want to be a
[2:32:06] blessing to you
[2:32:08] in whatever way we can so we thank you
[2:32:10] from the bottom of our heart for being
[2:32:12] with us today i want to say to all the
[2:32:15] new hope family god bless you we love
[2:32:17] you we can't wait to be able to see you
[2:32:20] again we're going to be stream only
[2:32:22] tuesday night and i will give you a
[2:32:24] final decision hopefully by the
[2:32:27] leadership of the lord on tuesday night
[2:32:29] what we will do for next sunday but
[2:32:31] we're hoping and and really anticipating
[2:32:35] that we could be together again
[2:32:38] with some
[2:32:39] measures in place a little a little
[2:32:41] careful uh planning and whatever might
[2:32:44] be necessary for those of you that have
[2:32:46] not had the virus we want to be mindful
[2:32:49] of that but we long to be together in
[2:32:51] the presence of the lord god bless you
[2:32:53] we love you thank you for being a part
[2:32:55] of this service today bye-bye
