[0:00] this is bride time this isn't time to go
[0:03] back to the systems of the church this
[0:05] isn't the time to bow to the
[0:07] denominational spirits of the Antichrist
[0:10] this is the the hour and the time to
[0:13] stand on the word and here's where we
[0:16] won't be able to fudge anymore you won't
[0:18] be able to grab a hold of the coattail
[0:21] of somebody else's Revelation and stand
[0:24] against the Ws of the devil you'll have
[0:26] to be alone with God until he opens up
[0:29] the heaven
[0:30] and releases Revelation to your life and
[0:34] then when you hear Revelation from the
[0:36] spirit based on the absolute word of God
[0:42] that Revelation becomes a part of your
[0:45] DNA the devil can talk you out of having
[0:48] picking someone else's conviction but
[0:51] he'll never talk you out of what the
[0:53] Holy Ghost has revealed to you by the
[0:56] word because it has become a part of of
[1:00] you you have become a part of it and
[1:03] once that word is quickened to you in
[1:06] Soul and Spirit in the Inner Man you
[1:10] receive like
[1:12] Moses a
[1:15] transformation from relating to God as
[1:18] only a master and we his slaves you
[1:23] begin to relate to him as one who has
[1:26] invited you to cooperate with his ET
[1:29] Eternal
[1:31] plan he didn't just create you to serve
[1:34] him and when we think of serving the
[1:37] lord we often think of subservient and
[1:40] less than and not nearly enough and we
[1:43] have to uh hope and and work to get
[1:47] somewhere else God doesn't want to
[1:49] reveal himself to you like that he wants
[1:52] you to know that he could have chosen to
[1:55] call anybody that has ever lived on the
[1:58] face of the Earth he could have chosen
[2:01] them all if he would have desired
[2:04] to he could have left you out of your
[2:07] family when he was choosing but he cared
[2:09] about you before you were ever born he
[2:12] knew your name before your mother and
[2:14] father ever had manifestation on the
[2:17] earth he already knew your
[2:20] name he already knew where you would be
[2:23] just like he knew where Moses was going
[2:25] to be he didn't come down looking for
[2:28] him he came down to meet him when you
[2:31] receive the revelation of the Quicken
[2:33] word for the hour you receive the
[2:36] beginning of a
[2:37] Transfiguration the beginning of a
[2:40] transformation on the inside that works
[2:43] its way through to the
[2:48] outside and he no longer desires to be
[2:51] IM
[2:53] Emmanuel a a god with us but his
[2:57] ultimate desire from the beginning yes
[3:00] not an afterthought from the beginning
[3:03] his ultimate desire was to come down and
[3:06] live in you to walk in you you ought to
[3:10] be careful what you say you ought to be
[3:13] careful what you think you ought to be
[3:15] careful where you go because you're
[3:17] dragging
[3:19] Elohim y v not only the God and creator
[3:24] of the Heaven and Earth but The God Who
[3:25] longs to have intimate fellowship with
[3:27] you you're dragging him to those places
[3:30] you're submitting him to those thoughts
[3:33] you're exposing him to those words and
[3:36] to those behaviors and to those actions
[3:38] somebody said are you trying to strike
[3:40] fear in their heart no Godly conviction
[3:42] and
[3:44] reverence there is an absence of the
[3:46] fear of the Lord in this hour you can't
[3:49] Wade through the Slime and the swamp of
[3:53] this life and expect to be transformed
[3:56] into Oneness with Christ you're going to
[3:59] have to find the secret chamber you're
[4:01] going to have to find the Hoopa you're
[4:04] going to have to find the bridal chamber
[4:06] you're going to have to find the little
[4:07] room inside the tent the tent in the
[4:10] tent on you're going to have to find
[4:13] that little chamber where you go in one
[4:15] way and you come out Ms Jesus
[4:19] Christ and you operate in the authority
[4:22] of that name and that name is so
[4:24] powerful that it transformed
[4:27] Moses Hallelujah
[4:30] and he's one of the only prophets in the
[4:32] bible mentioned as being like unto
[4:35] Christ Moses was a perfect type of the
[4:39] Christ to come now how could he be that
[4:43] he could only be that because of what he
[4:45] received in the revelation of the name
[4:48] and the presence of almighty God he said
[4:51] I want to be to you the yod V I want to
[4:55] be to you the
[4:57] Yahweh the god who
[5:01] desires Union and Oneness and fellowship
