TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I've just come into a valley, one like I've never been before. I keep searching for a way out. Seems like there's padlocks on every door. Oh, there must be another sunrise, another sunset that I'll see. God will make this trial a blessing. That's the love he has for me. God will make this trial a blessing. Though it sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. No need to talk defeat conclus. [Music] Thank you Jesus. I've just come into a valley one like I've never been before. I keep searching for a way out but it seems like there's padlocks on every door. Oh, there must be another sunrise, another sunset that I'll see. God will make this trial a blessing. That's the love he has for me. You believe that? God will make this trial a blessing. Lord sends me to my knees. Though my tears flow like the river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discourage. No need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. Now I was not the first one to come into this place. You see every son of God. This same test he must face. But it is here that God can mold you, make you what you ought to be. God will make this trial a blessing. Just be patient. You will see God will make this trial a blessing. Oh, it sends me to my knees. Though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. No need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. Now I'm standing on the mountain looking back where I can see. When I was in that deep dark valley, guess whose hand was holding me? Oh, it's good to see the sunshine. I can taste sweet victory. God has made my trial a blessing. That's the love he has for me. God will make this trial a blessing. Though it sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged, no need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. Now, you may not be able to sing this verse just yet because you may still feel like you're in the hottest part of the trial, but I want you to know as sure as there's a God, you'll be on the mountain again one day. Takes two mountains to make one valley, that means there's twice as many blessings and high places in the Lord as there is dark places. So if you can't say that I've already made it through, say it by faith. Proclaim it by faith. Now I'm standing on the mountain looking back where I can see when I was in that deep dark valley. His right arm was holding me. Oh, it's good to see the sunshine. I can taste sweet victory. God has made my trial a woo. That's the love he had for me. God will make this trial a blessing. Hallelujah. Though it sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. No need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. I've heard this song for [Music] years. I've sung it lots of times, but there's something about a line in this chorus that's never struck me like it did this morning. I know it's true. I've probably said it before, but it just stood out at me. And here's the line. Though my tears flow like a river, that's not it. I've I've been a crybaby all my life. So that's not the one. It's the next phrase. Yet in him there's sweet relief. If you've ever had chronic pain in your body for about anything for any any reason, whatever kind of pain it was, hopefully it's prayer that delivered you, but maybe sometimes it's medicine that that takes the edge off. But there's nothing like having your suffering, your pain, your your agony leave you for just a few moments and find that place of relief. Maybe you've had respiratory trouble or something. All of a sudden, you get one deep breath as that stuff starts clearing out. That that wonderful peace, that wonderful I don't know if it's relief or release, but it's that wonderful moment when when it's all worth it because for just a few moments of time in him, you find absolute comfort and total peace. There's nothing like serving the Lord. Can you say amen? Amen. One more time. Listen to this verse. Now I'm standing on the mountain, looking back where I can see. When I was in that deep, dark valley, it was him holding me. Oh, it's good to feel the sunshine. I can taste sweet victory. God has made this trial a blessing. That's the love he has for me. Sing it out, would you? God will make this trial a blessing. Though it sends me to my knees, though my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged. No need to talk defeat. God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. [Music] God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. If you believe that, give him praise right now. Wonderful Lord.
