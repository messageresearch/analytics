[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Weist
[0:43] in you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[0:59] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:02] Shelley of the New Hope revival
[1:04] ministries in Smith Station Alabama and
[1:07] I'm coming to you again in partnership a
[1:10] great cooperation with the gospel
[1:13] channel and we're excited to be here
[1:16] today we appreciate all of the
[1:19] correspondence the emails the phone
[1:22] calls with your prayer requests and
[1:25] occasionally a testimony that God is
[1:29] answered prayer he is a prayer answering
[1:32] God and when we hear from you it's so
[1:35] encouraging just before I came out here
[1:38] to record this program today we received
[1:41] a prayer request from Ireland and I've
[1:43] already prayed for that brother and
[1:45] asked the Lord to meet that need and so
[1:49] we invite you to continue to reach out
[1:51] that way in many of you have mentioned
[1:54] what a blessing this series we have
[1:58] finished now six parts today is episode
[2:02] seven in the fullness of time and many
[2:06] have reached out to say that you've
[2:08] learned something you've been in church
[2:11] some a few people said I've been in
[2:13] church all my life but I'm hearing
[2:14] things that I've never heard before well
[2:17] that is so encouraging to us because I
[2:20] remember I remember the first time that
[2:23] I heard some of these truths and how
[2:25] they encouraged me and how they changed
[2:28] my life they gave me a level of trust in
[2:31] God my Creator my sovereign Lord that I
[2:36] had never had before and I just want to
[2:39] encourage you to keep approaching his
[2:42] word digging deep I think we've
[2:45] mentioned before that you can go on
[2:48] YouTube we have our own YouTube channel
[2:51] new hope revival ministries and I know
[2:53] that we have mentioned that you can go
[2:55] and see the episodes that you may have
[2:58] missed and today when I was looking on
[3:01] the channel I thought well perhaps we
[3:04] can go back and add the script
[3:07] to the description of the video and we
[3:09] will try to do that so that you could
[3:11] keep up I try to keep up with the verses
[3:14] that I share with you on what episodes
[3:17] so maybe if we put it there you could do
[3:19] your own homework you could go and mark
[3:23] those verses down and read them for
[3:25] yourself and underline them in your
[3:28] Bible and ask the Holy Spirit to speak
[3:31] to your heart to anoint your eyes with
[3:34] eyesalve I am fully persuaded my friend
[3:38] that the Word of God is our daily bread
[3:42] and really it is so much more than that
[3:44] I know that the Bible is a written
[3:47] record of Jesus who is the Living Word
[3:50] but it points us in the right direction
[3:53] and it creates an atmosphere when we
[3:58] approach it in prayer when we're going
[4:00] to read the Bible and we just take a
[4:02] moment to perhaps bow our head and say
[4:05] now Lord I need the Holy Spirit to teach
[4:08] me I need you to make your word alive to
[4:12] quicken it to my heart when we do that
[4:15] it points us it guides us into a deeper
[4:20] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:22] and I feel so blessed any of you that
[4:26] have ever read or have done any research
[4:29] about how we got the Bible that we have
[4:32] today many lost their lives many gave
[4:37] the entirety of their life to preserve
[4:41] to translate to protect the written
[4:45] record of God's Word and we're a blessed
[4:47] people we are a blessed people indeed I
[4:51] have a desire in my heart to visit the
[4:55] Museum of the Bible
[4:56] that has recently opened in Washington
[4:59] DC I've been to many of the museums that
[5:02] are there but what a wonderful thought
[5:05] to know that there is an entire museum
[5:08] dedicated to the greatest book that has
[5:11] ever been written and I love the Bible
[5:14] when I say that I mean that from the
[5:17] bottom of my
[5:18] because every time I pick it up I hear
[5:21] the Spirit of God speaking and it's
[5:25] always so precious for the moment
[5:28] whatever my need is a lot of times a lot
[5:31] of times when I pick up the Bible I say
[5:34] Lord you know what I need today you know
[5:37] what I need to read you know what I need
[5:39] to understand would you direct my
[5:41] thoughts would you lead me to where I
[5:45] should read today and sometimes I I feel
[5:49] sometimes I sense a direction of where
[5:52] to go other times I just maybe try to
[5:56] follow a pattern in my Bible reading but
[5:58] it's just a wonderful wonderful gift
[6:02] that we have and that's why I love
[6:04] teaching preaching that's why I love
[6:07] sharing with you some of the nuggets
[6:10] that the Lord has blessed us with down
[6:13] through the years that the understanding
[6:16] of God's Word is ever-expanding because
[6:19] again it is a written record but it's a
[6:22] written record of a Living Word the Word
[6:26] of God is alive Jesus Christ is the Word
[6:30] made flesh he lives in our heart in
[6:34] spirit form here we have the Holy Ghost
[6:37] the Holy Spirit of God living inside of
[6:41] us Christ in spirit form aren't we a
[6:44] blessed people we are a blessed people
[6:47] indeed so let's get into the study today
[6:51] and before we do that let me remind you
[6:54] again you can subscribe to the YouTube
[6:57] channel you can find us online we have a
[7:00] beautiful website revival dot o-r-g you
[7:06] can now download our new hope revival
[7:09] ministries app onto your smartphone or
[7:12] your tablet and you can keep up with all
[7:15] the programs another way of keeping up
[7:18] with the programs that you miss and one
[7:21] of my favorite things that we do is the
[7:24] New Hope moments you can find those
[7:27] usually one comes out every week
[7:30] and you can find that on the app and be
[7:33] inspired we just want to make as many
[7:36] resources available to you as possible
[7:39] because we understand that we need a
[7:42] daily connection with with him and we
[7:45] get that many times by hearing the
[7:48] anointed Word of God it makes us feel
[7:51] connected to him in fact by faith it
[7:55] does connect us to Christ and souls
[7:58] these are some of the ways that you can
[8:01] connect with us other than the program
[8:04] here and send in your prayer request as
[8:08] we mentioned earlier because we believe
[8:10] in prayer and we believe in the power of
[8:13] agreement there's a lot of things we can
[8:15] do too much of but but not prayer prayer
[8:18] is one of those things that we can never
[8:20] pray too much and remember that when we
[8:23] pray maybe we'll do some teaching here
[8:25] sometime on prayer because when we pray
[8:28] we're not begging we're not trying to to
[8:32] sell something to the Lord you know it's
[8:35] not a job interview or something like
[8:36] that
[8:37] or a sales pitch we're coming because he
[8:40] told us to come we're coming at his
[8:43] invitation to present to lay down our
[8:46] petitions to thank him first and
[8:50] foremost for all the things that he has
[8:53] already done in our lives and then to
[8:57] pray a prayer asking that our lives
[9:00] could come into agreement with God's
[9:03] purpose and plan for us every single day
[9:07] I want you to know that Christianity is
[9:10] not a religion it is a relationship and
[9:14] it is a day by day hour by hour minute
[9:18] by minute walk of faith but all what we
[9:22] be glad won't we be glad when we step
[9:27] into a dimension into a home that he has
[9:30] prepared for us I'm so glad friend that
[9:34] I know that this life is not all there
[9:37] is I'm so glad that I know that I know
[9:40] that I know
[9:41] that there is something even more real
[9:44] than the life we're living right now
[9:46] there is an eternity with God not just a
[9:50] hope not just a promise but it is a
[9:53] reality and we keep journeying on as
[9:57] pilgrims toward Christ and toward an
[10:01] eternity with him I remember one time a
[10:06] young child asked me brother Shelly
[10:08] won't we would be bored in heaven if all
[10:12] we do is go to church and well first of
[10:15] all most of the time church is not
[10:17] boring to me on the occasion it
[10:20] certainly can be but no there's a whole
[10:24] lot more there's a whole lot more
[10:26] waiting for us beyond our heavenly home
[10:30] the new heaven and the new earth eternal
[10:33] life with him we will worship the king
[10:37] we will be busy as the overcoming bride
[10:40] of Jesus Christ reigning with him ruling
[10:43] with him in his throne and there will be
[10:46] plenty of things going on that will keep
[10:49] us certainly occupied through the
[10:53] endless ages you know I've got to make
[10:56] it I've got to make it and I can not by
[11:00] my good behavior because sometimes I
[11:02] fail but because of his grace and
[11:05] because of the faith that he has placed
[11:08] in my heart to stay connected to him I
[11:11] pray that our time together is not in
[11:15] vain that God will use some of these I
[11:19] don't want to say doctrines I want to
[11:22] say truths but but some of it is really
[11:26] essential doctrines in understanding
[11:28] God's Word but you know you can hear a
[11:32] doctrine and you can associate yourself
[11:35] with a doctrine and not be personally
[11:38] connected to it but when God makes his
[11:41] word come alive and he reveals it to you
[11:46] and it becomes a personal truth a
[11:48] personal revelation to you I'll tell you
[11:51] it becomes more than a way
[11:53] been more than a comfort more than a
[11:55] weapon it becomes life to a strength to
[12:00] us when our Lord was tempted in the
[12:02] wilderness by Satan he answered him how
[12:06] by the word it is written and I'm
[12:11] telling you the Word of God can be a
[12:13] great weapon in our life but it can also
[12:16] be strength when we're weak it can bring
[12:20] healing to us when we're needy in body
[12:22] and mind it can lead us and guide us
[12:27] when we have questions I believe there
[12:30] are so many answers in the Word of God
[12:31] not just how to live a Christian life
[12:34] but but how to be a good person you know
[12:37] the book of Proverbs gives us such
[12:40] wisdom and knowing how to treat other
[12:42] people there are so many precious things
[12:47] preserved for us in God's lovely Word
[12:50] and I feel like I'm one of the most
[12:53] blessed people on planet earth to be
[12:56] able to come in and talk to you share
[12:58] with you teach you a little bit
[13:00] encourage you from this Living Word
[13:03] precious Word of God Galatians chapter
[13:06] four verses one through seven is our
[13:09] foundational scripture passage for this
[13:13] series and I want us to read it yet once
[13:16] again now I say that the air as long as
[13:21] he is a child differeth nothing from a
[13:25] servant though he be Lord of all verse
[13:29] two but is under tutors and governors
[13:32] until the time appointed of the Father
[13:35] verse three even so we when we were
[13:39] children were in bondage under the
[13:41] elements of the world but verse four is
[13:46] the focus but when the fullness of the
[13:50] time was come God sent forth his son
[13:56] made of a woman made under the law to
[14:01] redeem them that were under the law that
[14:04] we might receive
[14:06] the adoption of sons hallelujah
[14:10] verse six and because ye are sons God
[14:16] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[14:19] into your hearts thank God for that
[14:25] witness that the very spirit of God's
[14:29] Son the Spirit of Jesus Christ has been
[14:33] sent forth into our hearts crying Abba
[14:39] Father Papa my papa
[14:43] my daddy I believe that we should
[14:47] approach the Lord with great reverence
[14:49] and great praise and great gratitude and
[14:54] Thanksgiving but I want you to know
[14:57] there are some times when we are so
[14:59] broken when we have lost so much and
[15:04] what we really need is daddys love we
[15:08] need Papa and I know there are many of
[15:11] you watching this program today like
[15:13] myself you didn't really have the love
[15:18] of your earthly father as a constant in
[15:22] your life and then perhaps that that
[15:25] makes you and I a little more needy in
[15:28] that area than someone who grew up in a
[15:32] home with a very loving father my mother
[15:35] did everything that she possibly could
[15:38] as a single parent to provide for me
[15:43] both Mama's love and when I needed it to
[15:47] be a dad but how many of you know
[15:50] there's just something missing in a
[15:51] situation like that but I want you to
[15:54] know I hope this sounds sincere because
[15:58] I mean it from from a place that I don't
[16:00] usually talk from but I'm telling you
[16:04] the Lord has been he has been he has
[16:08] been that Papa to me so many times you
[16:13] know I I worry sometime that people
[16:16] never come to know
[16:17] that way they never come to know him
[16:20] that way and and of course if he's never
[16:23] been presented to you in that way you if
[16:26] then you may have never known to open
[16:28] the door that he would come in and be
[16:31] that Papa to you I believe he comes at
[16:35] our invitation and well I I'm a I'm a
[16:40] daddy and I remember the fear that
[16:46] struck my heart as a brand-new married
[16:51] man my wife and I we kept ourselves pure
[16:57] like the scripture states like the
[17:01] scripture says and we married and we
[17:05] weren't we weren't kids and I was almost
[17:10] 30 years old and my wife a couple of
[17:14] years younger than I am and I loved her
[17:18] so much I knew that God had brought her
[17:20] to my life and I knew that I wanted to
[17:23] be a father but when when we heard the
[17:25] news rather shortly after we were
[17:29] married really just just a few weeks we
[17:33] found out and I remember the fear that
[17:37] struck my heart hi I never had a dad
[17:40] example how will I how will i how will I
[17:44] learn how will I know it was a fearful
[17:47] thing some of you understand and the
[17:50] only thing that I could take comfort in
[17:52] was what a Papa what a father God has
[17:57] been to me through my life and I asked
[18:00] him
[18:01] no I begged him pleaded with him would
[18:03] you would you please help me to be the
[18:06] kind of dad to my children that they
[18:08] will need and that they deserve and
[18:10] really I guess you could say I I know I
[18:13] have failed
[18:14] oh my fail every week in some way as a
[18:18] dad to my children I'm sure I do but I
[18:20] can tell you this in any place in any
[18:24] area of parenting that I have been
[18:27] successful in in any area that I've got
[18:31] it right it has been because I look to
[18:34] the example that had been set before me
[18:37] by my Heavenly Father if you can come to
[18:41] know him that way
[18:42] I remember there have been times in all
[18:45] of my children's life and my oldest our
[18:49] oldest son will be 21 years old this
[18:53] year and our baby will turn 13 this year
[18:57] and I remember it doesn't happen as
[19:00] often as it used to but I remember those
[19:03] times when I really didn't have to say
[19:06] anything I didn't have to have the right
[19:09] words all that Mama and I had to do was
[19:13] hold them while they cried it out and
[19:17] I'm telling you sometimes as Christians
[19:21] as adults parents grandparents we need a
[19:26] Papa
[19:27] we need a Papa who can just hold us
[19:30] while we cry it out there's nothing like
[19:33] experiencing his strong arms of love and
[19:38] knowing in the deepest part of who you
[19:41] are that he loves you and it is because
[19:45] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[19:49] into your heart he has brought you into
[19:53] the spirit of adoption that you're able
[19:57] to respond to him in this manner
[19:59] Galatians 4:6 crying Abba Father
[20:04] Papa God verse 7 wherefore thou are no
[20:08] more a servant but a son and if a son
[20:11] then an heir of God through Christ I'm
[20:16] telling you we have an inheritance much
[20:20] of what much of which we will begin to
[20:25] understand and partake of before the
[20:29] coming of the Lord but so much more we
[20:34] will experience after that change takes
[20:38] place but I believe that we have an
[20:40] inheritance that we can claim now that
[20:43] we can walk in now I believe in fact we
[20:47] must come to understand in new and fresh
[20:50] ways the authority that God wants to
[20:54] give to us as sons of God if you are a
[20:58] little lady watching this program and
[21:00] you'd say well I can't quite identify
[21:03] with being a son of God well I
[21:06] understand that because we brother
[21:08] sometimes we we have to get our mind
[21:11] around being the Bride of Christ but the
[21:14] truth is these promises are not gender
[21:17] based he is looking for a bride without
[21:21] spot without wrinkle without blemish one
[21:25] who is preparing herself to meet the
[21:27] Lord but what makes that possible is the
[21:30] gift of adoption the spirit of adoption
[21:33] and the glorious truth of sonship we are
[21:38] sons of God led by the Spirit so I want
[21:43] to move into the teaching that we have
[21:46] set aside for episode 7 of the fullness
[21:49] of time that word fullness it means to
[21:53] fill to the fullest it means to complete
[21:57] to fill to the top so that nothing shall
[22:01] be lacking to bring to full measure and
[22:05] so really when we look at verse 4 but
[22:08] when the fullness of time was come we
[22:10] realize that from the creation time so
[22:14] to speak let's look at it like this time
[22:18] had been filling up and filling up and
[22:20] filling up and everything was getting
[22:23] ready you might look at it like this the
[22:27] stage was being set every player every
[22:31] every actor every person who would have
[22:34] a role was being brought on to the scene
[22:38] many had come on the scene and many had
[22:41] left the scene there had been many
[22:44] different kingdoms and we we go through
[22:49] the scripture and we look at what
[22:51] was going on among the Canaanites and
[22:53] the Egyptians
[22:55] now we come toward the period of the New
[22:58] Testament we see the Romans coming on so
[23:01] kingdoms have come and gone and leaders
[23:04] and kings and dictators have already
[23:07] come and gone
[23:08] sin has become a serious problem God had
[23:13] to deal with that problem through the
[23:14] flood baptizing the earth - to begin
[23:19] again with Noah and his righteous family
[23:22] you just start looking through the
[23:25] scripture and you will see and and what
[23:29] if I should tell you that none of that
[23:31] was in vain none of that was wasted
[23:35] every bit of that was the the vessel of
[23:39] time getting fuller and fuller and
[23:42] fuller and fuller so that for such a
[23:45] time as God would determine that time
[23:49] was full he would send forth the apostle
[23:53] send send forth his son born of a woman
[23:57] born under the law but you and I who've
[24:00] been studying these scriptures together
[24:01] carefully for these past seven weeks and
[24:06] even before that we understand through
[24:09] John 1 that it wasn't just the sending
[24:13] of a son indeed it was the sending of a
[24:15] son but who was the son the son was the
[24:20] Word of God the Word was with God the
[24:24] Word was God the word became flesh dwelt
[24:28] among us
[24:29] so this son that was sent when time had
[24:34] been filled up just look at it like a
[24:35] vessel like a pitcher that you fill up
[24:40] with water and sometimes maybe it would
[24:43] get full and then a little something
[24:45] would happen and maybe it would get a
[24:46] little empty I don't know exactly how to
[24:48] paint the picture but then it would fill
[24:51] up and it would fill up and prophets
[24:53] would come we mentioned we mentioned
[24:55] kingdoms and political powers but
[24:56] prophets would come and they would die
[24:59] and
[24:59] another prophet would come another word
[25:02] of the Lord would come to generation God
[25:05] constantly calling his chosen people
[25:07] back to him but there came a time that
[25:12] the bucket that the vessel was filled to
[25:15] the brim to the top complete lacking of
[25:19] nothing to full measure and in that
[25:22] moment of Chronos time God said today is
[25:29] the day now is the season that a son
[25:35] will come and will pay the price I have
[25:40] that verse of scripture broke down in
[25:42] the original Greek all the way through
[25:45] that word son the coming of a son it's
[25:50] the wheel's word in greek it's the
[25:52] mature son and Jesus was the first
[25:56] mature son but the Bible tells us that
[26:00] because of him many sons will come to
[26:03] glory many sons how are we sons by the
[26:09] spirit of adoption how do we manifest
[26:13] that we are sons John 1 as many as are
[26:17] led we have to be willing to be led you
[26:22] know sometimes we get this attitude
[26:23] nobody's gonna tell me what to do I
[26:26] don't have to follow anybody well
[26:28] everybody's following somebody
[26:31] everybody's following somebody it's just
[26:34] part of life everybody answers to
[26:37] somebody in life so why not is believers
[26:40] why not surrender our will oh my I have
[26:45] a will I confess to you that I have a
[26:49] will and I daily I don't think that's an
[26:53] exaggeration i daily have to push that
[26:56] will down because it gets a little
[27:00] hottie it gets it gets to wanting to
[27:02] exalt itself against another will the
[27:05] most important will is the will of God
[27:08] in my life I must be led I must be
[27:12] led by the Spirit of God this is how we
[27:15] demonstrate that we are sons of God
[27:18] so Jesus Christ the real son he became
[27:23] the first mature son so that you and I
[27:26] might also come to the maturity that is
[27:29] scripture that is mentioned in the
[27:31] scripture and then it says that he was
[27:35] sent to redeem verse five to redeem them
[27:39] that were under the law and that word
[27:41] redeem is one of my favorite words
[27:44] because if it doesn't just mean to save
[27:47] something it means to take something all
[27:51] the way back to its original purpose why
[27:55] it was created in the first place and I
[27:59] guess every one of us we were born for a
[28:03] purpose and we got away from that
[28:06] purpose most all of us strayed in our
[28:10] youth we found our own way our own will
[28:14] our own support system our own vices our
[28:19] own addictions we set out to do it our
[28:23] way our circumstances may be different
[28:27] but really there there is that struggle
[28:30] that takes place in the heart of every
[28:31] man to do it his way every woman to do
[28:34] it her way
[28:35] but then we found him many of us and I
[28:40] pray that if you have not yet found him
[28:43] you will you will find him I know that
[28:47] he is searching for you I know that he
[28:50] is not lost I know that we're the ones
[28:53] that are lost I know that he is
[28:54] searching for you I know that you have
[28:58] to be aware of that to be able to
[29:00] recognize his call in your life
[29:04] sometimes it's loud sometimes he calls
[29:08] through preachers he may call through a
[29:10] Christian television program but
[29:13] sometimes the call is just this quiet
[29:16] pool on the inside of our life that that
[29:20] says there's a higher power there's
[29:22] something bigger than you are
[29:23] you are not on this
[29:25] in vain no matter what the circumstances
[29:29] of your of your conception were no
[29:32] matter what kind of environment you were
[29:34] raised in are brought up in you are not
[29:37] here by accident I feel most assured
[29:42] that God has an appointment with you in
[29:44] this hour and that is to redeem you back
[29:48] to the original purpose of your birth of
[29:51] your creation God is a redeemer by
[29:54] nature you've heard us say that before
[29:56] and what we have in in biblical history
[30:00] from the creation to the cross from the
[30:03] cross all the way to the Millennium
[30:05] it is God's unfolding plan of redemption
[30:09] I love that God not only wants to redeem
[30:13] mankind he wants to redeem the planet we
[30:17] all know that we have made a mess of the
[30:20] planet that God has given us to live on
[30:23] we've been careless but God has a plan
[30:26] of redemption he's going to end up
[30:28] renovating it by fire but there's a new
[30:32] heaven and a new earth that will come he
[30:35] wants to redeem the earth he not only
[30:37] wants to redeem my life in your life but
[30:40] even the earth oh my and to believe to
[30:44] think that we're a part of that plan and
[30:46] I believe I am Redemption always comes
[30:50] with a price
[30:51] the word redeem we we know that God
[30:55] altom utley had authority to do his way
[30:58] and his will but because man was lost
[31:01] because we were taken captive by our own
[31:03] lusts we had become enslaved by our own
[31:09] lusts by our own desires and then so we
[31:13] had to be redeemed away we had to be
[31:16] taken away stolen away so to speak but
[31:19] not stolen bought purchased with a price
[31:22] a ransom was paid so many circumstances
[31:28] and situation said that we could say
[31:31] kidnapped us so to speak but a ransom
[31:34] had to be paid to redeem now if we were
[31:39] just go
[31:39] be slipped into another existence or are
[31:42] some some little slight change we could
[31:45] look at it only in the sense that we
[31:47] were saved from tragedy or saved from
[31:50] something else but it wasn't just
[31:51] salvation
[31:52] it was Redemption Redemption has a cost
[31:57] we are not our own
[31:59] we are bought with the price and you
[32:02] know what that price is
[32:03] we've studied it together you and I the
[32:06] precious blood of Jesus Christ blood
[32:11] that was created specifically for my
[32:15] Redemption for your Redemption and we
[32:19] could go on that that adoption the word
[32:22] adoption there the spirit you have
[32:24] received the spirit of adoption it's
[32:26] another beautiful word because this is
[32:28] not adoption in the sense that we think
[32:31] of it today adoption in the time of the
[32:34] scripture was an entirely different
[32:36] process because even a natural born son
[32:39] had to be adopted in his own family so
[32:43] this is not just the taking in as we
[32:47] know adoption of an orphan or someone
[32:50] who doesn't have a parent to raise him
[32:53] and we we go through the proper
[32:55] authorities and through the proper
[32:57] procedures and we adopt a child into our
[33:00] home by fostering that child and then
[33:03] legally adopting him but in the Bible in
[33:05] the time of the scripture adoption was
[33:08] an entirely different thing even though
[33:10] Benjamin Judah and Joshua River are my
[33:14] natural born sons had we lived in the
[33:18] time of the Bible a first temple or
[33:22] second temple period and many years
[33:25] after adoption would have been a
[33:27] different process altogether though they
[33:29] were born a shellye
[33:31] they would be they would set as we read
[33:34] right here Galatians 4 they would be
[33:38] under tutors and governors until the
[33:42] time appointed of the Father until they
[33:46] had proven themselves they learned
[33:48] enough they had experienced enough under
[33:52] tutors and the governors and now it
[33:55] would be time for them to have authority
[33:58] to conduct business to carry on the
[34:01] affairs of the Shelly family and in that
[34:05] moment there would be a celebration
[34:08] there would be a declaration of full
[34:11] adoption and authority there would be a
[34:13] great family celebration and then their
[34:17] name would be just as real as my name to
[34:22] conduct business on behalf of the family
[34:26] and this was the process of adoption it
[34:29] was bringing them from natural-born sons
[34:31] to complete mature sons with the same
[34:37] authority of the father in the family so
[34:40] this is what the spirit of adoption has
[34:44] done is doing in my life and in your
[34:47] life bringing us to a place that when we
[34:50] surrender in obedience to the truth of
[34:54] God's Word remember we've got to quit
[34:55] resisting it with our own will and we've
[34:58] got to surrender to his will and when we
[35:00] do that we come to a fuller measure of
[35:04] the stature of a perfect man we come
[35:07] into a greater place of maturity and
[35:09] when we are growing in that grace of
[35:12] maturity we're no longer acting like
[35:14] like little brats
[35:17] if you will forgive me for saying it
[35:20] that way the Apostle Paul said when I
[35:22] was a child I thought as a child I spoke
[35:24] as a child I behaved myself as a child
[35:27] but when I became a man a wheeeeel son a
[35:30] mature son I put away my childish things
[35:33] I put my toys aside and I had to now
[35:36] conduct business because I had a family
[35:38] of my own this is what what we
[35:40] understand and so this is what's
[35:43] happening in our life this is a process
[35:47] and so getting saved what we call
[35:51] getting saved that's just a small part
[35:53] it's a bigger it's a bigger plan
[35:56] Redemption it's a bigger plan than just
[35:59] inviting the Lord into your life well
[36:02] well how do we know we're on the journey
[36:03] because we keep cooperating with
[36:05] we keep yielding to him and I encourage
[36:08] you to do that because this spirit of
[36:11] adoption comes by the spirit this
[36:14] adoption process comes by the spirit not
[36:17] by the letter of the law but by
[36:20] experiencing the Spirit of God that word
[36:24] spirit there in the spirit of adoption
[36:27] in Galatians is is numa which is breath
[36:30] wind it's the same word we use in Hebrew
[36:33] the the Ruach the very breath of God so
[36:37] it's by the breath of God that we come
[36:39] into a higher place of adoption and a
[36:43] higher place of authority I'm glad of
[36:46] that
[36:46] I'm glad of that because it means it's
[36:48] not just my responsibility to mature
[36:51] myself what I do is I have to yield
[36:55] let the spirit keep moving over my life
[36:58] I hope somebody gets that it's a daily
[37:03] yielding Spirit of God lead me Holy
[37:06] Ghost of God lead me today
[37:08] God my life and let me let me renew my
[37:13] relationship with with the Lord with
[37:16] Jesus Yeshua our Messiah and so we're no
[37:20] longer servants we start out just
[37:23] servants but that word servant is a word
[37:27] that can mean slave a bondman one one
[37:31] who who is serving in an indentured
[37:35] manner no freedom of his own but we are
[37:38] no longer servants but we are coming
[37:42] into sonship as sons oh my what a
[37:46] difference that can make in our life and
[37:49] so when we think about this in the
[37:52] fullness of time we're thinking again
[37:55] about that stage and we're thinking
[37:58] about how everything had to be set up
[38:00] because God in His sovereignty
[38:02] he knew that the Lord His Son Jesus
[38:08] Christ our Messiah would come that he
[38:11] would be rejected that he would be
[38:13] crucified that he would die that he
[38:15] would be that he would rise again on the
[38:17] third day
[38:18] that on the day of pentecost the church
[38:21] would be born and the gospel would need
[38:23] to go out and the good news of the
[38:26] baptism of the Spirit would need to go
[38:29] out and so I loved I loved reading and
[38:33] finding out that there were there was no
[38:36] time in history better from from the
[38:42] time of Calvary all the way back to the
[38:45] Garden of Eden there was no better time
[38:48] in the history of mankind for the Lord
[38:52] to come as the Son of God everything was
[38:56] set up in such a manner that his coming
[39:00] was in the fullness in the perfect
[39:02] timing of the Lord I have some notes
[39:05] here that I can share with you you know
[39:07] the Roman roads there was a lot that
[39:11] went on in in the in the Roman
[39:14] occupation there were some serious
[39:17] things that took place in the Roman
[39:19] occupation even of the city of Jerusalem
[39:21] but it wasn't just Jerusalem it was that
[39:25] an entire part of the world the entire
[39:27] region was being conquered so to speak
[39:31] by the Romans but because of this
[39:35] conquering and there were many dark dark
[39:38] things about it but because of it they
[39:41] they built a system of roads
[39:44] unlike there had ever existed before in
[39:49] fact the Romans historically were
[39:52] responsible for opening up the world
[39:54] they opened up the world to every
[39:57] community in that entire region through
[40:00] the Mediterranean the landscape was
[40:03] paved with Roman roads they would take
[40:07] mortar a concrete type mixture pour it
[40:11] into a trench sometimes three feet thick
[40:15] and cobblestones would cover the top and
[40:19] then they would pour salt on top of the
[40:22] cobblestones to harden the surface of
[40:26] the stone and the mortar and would you
[40:29] believe that men
[40:30] those roads built in the time of the
[40:32] Romans are still traveled on today
[40:34] I myself have traveled on roads that
[40:39] were laid by the Romans in the time of
[40:42] Christ they were so well done but what
[40:46] happened was for instance the Ignatian
[40:48] way you can read about the Ignatian way
[40:51] this was a road that stretched across
[40:55] Macedonia the Macedonian world allowing
[40:58] all the early apostles especially the
[41:01] greatest missionary of the time the
[41:04] Apostle Paul an easier means of travel
[41:07] and listen Paul as we know from the book
[41:10] of Acts he had a hard way to go in many
[41:14] ways he went through a lot of stuff but
[41:17] he would not have been able to cover the
[41:19] ground to to cover the territory that he
[41:25] covered had it not been for this great
[41:28] network of Roman roads in spite of
[41:31] thieves and and other threats along the
[41:34] way one could go from city to city
[41:36] across that entire macedonian region
[41:39] with relative ease this established a
[41:42] wonderful opportunity for the spread for
[41:45] the communication of the gospel had this
[41:48] happened had had Jesus come 100 years
[41:52] before it would have slowed down it
[41:56] would have greatly impeded the entire
[41:59] process of sending the gospel forth not
[42:02] only were there roads but remember by
[42:05] this time there were very established
[42:07] shipping routes and so we read of some
[42:11] of the experiences that the Apostles had
[42:14] in in ships and all of their experiences
[42:17] were were not pleasant but the routes
[42:20] were already set up God allowed the
[42:24] timing to be just right spice routes
[42:26] were already operating from the Orient
[42:29] all the way across the land of the Bible
[42:32] and through Macedonian all the way up to
[42:34] up to to Rome everything in place I love
[42:40] that because it reminds me that God knew
[42:43] exactly what he was doing this didn't
[42:46] just happen by chance this was God
[42:49] allowing the fullness of times to take
[42:52] place the vessel was filling up little
[42:55] by little by little so the world was
[42:57] ready physically that's the point I
[43:00] wanted to get to the world was ready
[43:03] physically for the coming of the Messiah
[43:06] for the coming of the savior of all
[43:09] mankind and then we find out that
[43:12] religiously the world was ready we've
[43:16] spoken about culture a little bit what
[43:18] was going on I'm telling you there there
[43:22] was a lot of philosophy that was going
[43:25] on that was anti God and against God and
[43:28] there was a lot of paganism in the land
[43:32] and very much idolatry and people were
[43:37] worshipping everything from the Sun God
[43:40] to the dancing goats it was a it
[43:44] religiously a very very sad time and
[43:46] even even Judaism the faith of the Old
[43:50] Testament the the the faith that God
[43:53] established in the earth it had also
[43:56] become very corrupt the religious
[43:58] climate in the land of the Bible the
[44:01] Land of Israel as a nation that
[44:04] religious climate was very difficult
[44:06] because there was this clash of paganism
[44:11] and of the of the Pharisee spirit that
[44:17] had taken over the faith of the Bible or
[44:21] we would say the faith of the Hebrews
[44:24] Judaism if you will remember the
[44:28] Maccabees had had revolted against this
[44:31] this occupation and they led Israel to a
[44:35] time of temporary relief a reprieve a
[44:38] little bit of freedom but since the time
[44:41] of the high priesthood and the religious
[44:46] establishment of the day during that
[44:48] same period it had so degraded
[44:52] roaded the the character of the
[44:56] leadership the integrity of the
[44:59] leadership had fallen and with a little
[45:02] bit of study about the the city of
[45:05] Jerusalem some years after Christ at the
[45:09] destruction of the temple in 70 AD you
[45:12] do a little reading there and you'll
[45:14] find that even the priesthood of the
[45:16] Holy Place the Holy Temple had become
[45:19] quite corrupt religion was a mess at
[45:24] this particular time and so the
[45:27] Pharisees they were offering a heavy
[45:30] burden of legalism and most of them with
[45:35] no character to draw people to it it was
[45:37] just a heavy burden and extreme legalism
[45:40] that they were trying to to lay on the
[45:43] on that on the shoulders of the
[45:45] worshippers and then there were various
[45:47] other groups or sects like the Sadducees
[45:50] and they offered no hope for
[45:53] resurrection you you know you better get
[45:56] it right because you only get one chance
[45:57] and that's it and it's over and it's
[45:59] finished and done and they didn't
[46:01] believe in eternal life by the
[46:03] resurrection and so that wasn't much to
[46:06] get excited about so you've got paganism
[46:09] invading the world expanding crazy
[46:13] coming from the far reaches of Asia and
[46:15] now reaching across the the entire area
[46:18] of the Mediterranean it's now crossing
[46:21] seas it's traveling the same roads I
[46:23] mean so things were being set up for the
[46:27] gospel to go forward but also error was
[46:32] was being able it was able to go into
[46:35] many many places because of the shipping
[46:37] routes and the roads etc and then you've
[46:40] got the paganism then you've got the
[46:42] faith of the Bible the scripture the Old
[46:45] Testament Judaism as we as we have
[46:47] mentioned earlier it was becoming
[46:49] corrupt and divided and hopeless very
[46:55] little hope being offered for the people
[46:57] they were very very oppressed and very
[47:00] confused and instead of looking for
[47:03] Savior they were looking for a middle
[47:05] very general to come as a messiah and
[47:07] save them from the oppression of the
[47:09] Romans but God knew exactly what he was
[47:12] doing he knew exactly what he was doing
[47:14] there was no hope anywhere else the
[47:17] pagans and all of their idolatry they
[47:20] were offering no hope to the people and
[47:22] now even the scripture even even Judaism
[47:26] as outlined in the Old Testament it was
[47:29] offering no hope to the people and guess
[47:31] what
[47:31] in that particular religious climate God
[47:36] sent forth his son so the world was
[47:40] prepared physically the world was
[47:43] prepared religiously and we can say from
[47:47] Scripture that the world was ready
[47:49] prophetically there were various
[47:52] prophecies from the Old Testament very
[47:55] well known prophecies among the people
[47:58] that would describe precisely the
[48:02] entrance of the Messiah into the world
[48:04] his birthplace would be talked about his
[48:07] flight into Egypt would be mentioned
[48:10] that he would be born of a virgin had
[48:12] been prophesied even the timing of his
[48:16] death had been prefigured in Daniels
[48:20] prophecy through the prophecy of the 69
[48:22] weeks everything was in order
[48:27] prophetically so look at this
[48:29] physically religiously prophetically the
[48:32] scene was set the time was chosen the
[48:36] vessel of time was fooled and what did
[48:40] God do he came he came in a body made of
[48:45] flesh as we mentioned before not to a
[48:49] palace not to a not to a royal hospital
[48:54] but he came in the most humble of places
[48:58] and even the city of his birth was
[49:02] prophesied in Micah chapter 5 verse 2
[49:05] but thou Bethlehem Ephratah though thou
[49:09] be little among the thousands of Judah
[49:12] you're just a tiny little country town
[49:16] yet out of thee shall come
[49:19] forth unto me that is to be ruler in
[49:22] Israel whose goings forth have been from
[49:26] of old from everlasting this was just a
[49:31] spirit of the Lord had fallen on Micah
[49:33] the prophet and he had risen up to
[49:35] prophesy the city of his birth and we
[49:39] know from the scripture Matthew chapter
[49:41] 2 verses 4 through 6 and when he had
[49:45] gathered all the chief priests and
[49:46] scribes of the people together he
[49:48] demanded of them where Christ should be
[49:51] born this was Herod and they said unto
[49:54] Him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[49:58] written by the prophet and thou
[50:00] bethlehem in the land of judah are not
[50:03] the least among the princess of Judah
[50:06] for out of thee shall come a governor
[50:08] that shall rule my people Israel this
[50:13] was God's doings it was God's plan even
[50:19] the city chosen prophesied hundreds of
[50:22] years before it came to pass and notice
[50:27] that when it come time to announce the
[50:30] birth here is the son he has arrived on
[50:33] planet Earth the world will never be the
[50:37] same and that doesn't mean that for
[50:40] 2,000 years everything has been
[50:42] beautiful oh no the world continues to
[50:46] go farther and farther away from God but
[50:49] we have a hope today that they didn't
[50:52] have in any other hour until the
[50:55] fullness of time had come and when it
[50:59] was time to announce his coming was it
[51:02] to the most learn it was it to the most
[51:04] educated was it to the to the one who
[51:07] had the most power no Luke chapter 2
[51:10] verses 8 through 20 tell us I don't know
[51:13] if I'll have time to read it all but but
[51:15] we know these scriptures let me start
[51:18] and there were in the same country
[51:20] Shepherds sheep keepers the keepers of
[51:24] goats stinky humble Shepherds keeping
[51:31] watch over their flock by night
[51:33] and lo the angel of the Lord came unto
[51:36] them not to Herod not to the Emperor the
[51:40] ruler he didn't go to Rome to announce
[51:42] it no no the angel of the Lord came upon
[51:47] them and the glory of the Lord shone
[51:50] round about them and they were sore
[51:52] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[51:54] not for behold I bring you good tidings
[51:57] of great joy the best news folk the best
[52:01] news the world had ever heard which
[52:04] shall be to all people for unto you Is
[52:06] Born This Day in the City of David a
[52:09] savior which is Christ the Lord and this
[52:12] shall be a sign unto you you shall find
[52:16] the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes we
[52:18] talked about those lying in a manger and
[52:21] suddenly there was with the angel a
[52:24] multitude of the heavenly hosts what a
[52:26] production not just the angel of the
[52:29] Lord that's powerful but now a great
[52:32] multitude of heavenly angels the
[52:35] heavenly hosts all gathered down into
[52:38] one little field outside the city of
[52:41] Bethlehem what a beautiful thought
[52:45] praising God this great heavenly hosts
[52:48] saying glory to God in the highest and
[52:50] on earth peace goodwill toward men and
[52:53] it came to pass as the angels were gone
[52:56] away from them into heaven the
[52:58] Shepherd's said one to another let us
[53:00] now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing
[53:03] which has come to pass which the LORD
[53:05] hath made known unto us and they came
[53:09] with haste and found Mary and Joseph and
[53:11] the babe lying in a manger and when they
[53:13] had seen it they made known abroad the
[53:16] saying which was told them concerning
[53:17] the child and all they that heard it
[53:20] wondered at those things which were told
[53:22] them by the shepherds but Mary kept all
[53:25] these things and pondered them in her
[53:27] heart and verse 20 and the Shepherd's
[53:30] returned glorifying and praising God for
[53:34] all the things that they had heard and
[53:36] seen as it was told unto them and what
[53:40] are you and I doing two thousand years
[53:43] later we're still rejoicing at the song
[53:45] of the
[53:46] Jools we're still rejoicing at this
[53:49] beautiful announcement and not only the
[53:53] beauty of the announcement but the
[53:55] reality of the Promised One for that
[53:59] little baby that was laying there in
[54:01] that little City of David Bethlehem the
[54:05] house of bread Bethlehem the house of
[54:07] bread that little baby he grew in wisdom
[54:14] in favor in knowledge we remember he
[54:21] baffled the teachers didn't he when he
[54:24] was separated from his parents he went
[54:28] through preparatory years coming into
[54:31] his place coming into his maturity
[54:34] though we were a son he had something to
[54:38] learn a hard lesson the lesson of
[54:42] obedience and indeed friend our Lord was
[54:45] faithful he was obedient even unto death
[54:48] and here we are 2,000 years later I am a
[54:52] product I am a product of this gift my
[54:57] life is what it is today because of this
[55:01] gift because he didn't remain the little
[55:03] baby he grew up he fulfilled all that
[55:07] was spoken of him he went to the cross
[55:10] betrayed by his own brethren murdered by
[55:14] his own kinsmen but it was a part of
[55:17] God's beautiful plan death the grave and
[55:21] hell couldn't hold him hallelujah he
[55:23] came forth victorious from the grave and
[55:26] he lives tell somebody he lives he lives
[55:32] in my heart he lives in your heart and
[55:36] if he doesn't live in your heart you can
[55:39] repent of your sins you can make the
[55:43] choice to obey God and his beautiful
[55:45] word and he will live in you by that
[55:49] spirit the spirit God called it tear
[55:54] through the through the prophet or the
[55:55] Apostle in Galatians the spirit of his
