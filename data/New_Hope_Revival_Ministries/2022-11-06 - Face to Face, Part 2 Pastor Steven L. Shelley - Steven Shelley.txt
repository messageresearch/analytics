"And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand [at] the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man [in] his tent door.

got to have a miracle and it has become legal and such a battle it's really witchcraft yeah yeah I want the Lord to do something yes Lord seems like the more we've prayed this week the worse it gets which is so understandable to me because the enemy is losing his hold yes I want to believe that God will give them the victory that they so deserve and need and would you pray for every person that was touched in the meetings in North Carolina last weekend we've had beautiful testimonies thank you Lord one from a from a dear sister who had carried something 35 years her feet crippled by it

camera God they they just want Deliverance for their lives they want healing they want a miracle and so God as we come to you we come with Thanksgiving because we know you're moving we thank you for this testimony Lord that you just by the faith in the preaching of the word somebody reached up and grabbed a hold of something for their life Lord that is what is possible with our lord Jesus and so

it's wonderful to be in the house of God it's wonderful to feel his presence and to know that he is here and uh we're just thankful to be home and to be safe and we got home and we streamed the service here Tuesday night on our way and we were very blessed I haven't gone back to see Sunday service yet I caught a little of it but I'm looking forward to it I know it was also a blessing Tuesday night was outstanding it wasn't just an ordinary Tuesday night service but you were hearing from the Lord it was really really timely and uh we're thanking God for that so if you didn't get a chance to hear it it's on the app and it's in your hand it's in your purse it's in your pocket wherever you carry your phone around your neck or whatever you do I think some people don't carry their phones I think some people don't ever look at their phones I don't in fact know why some people have phones do you it's certainly not so that we can get in touch with them I can tell you that right now on occasion I do lay mine down uh it's important to do that from time to time so your hand doesn't grow like that but I try to get back to him as quickly as I can I check my phone three times at least three times a night in the middle of the night to make sure that someone has not reached out in need and if someone says pray for me I do I do it's important that we carry one another in hours like we're living in right now this is a critical hour and we're facing some things and we need to be in prayer for the election maybe you feel like Alabama's not that important and you're right in the fact that we are not by any means a swing state but uh most of our election is pretty pretty secure but uh our nation we need God to move and I don't have any candidates to endorse all I know is what the Holy Ghost said he spoke clearly to my heart some years ago and he said if you're going to vote vote for the things that are closer to the heart of God so I said well what are those things and he spoke to me concerning the sanctity of life that's to protect The Unborn in the womb he spoke to me about the sanctity of marriage that's marriage between one man and one woman for life and then he spoke to me about a love for Israel and God loves Israel I want you to know he loves Israel he loves the Jewish people and it's important that we align ourselves with those principles is that all that matters no there are other things that matter but God said if you're voting you're going to vote vote for the things that are nearer and dearer to my heart so that's what the rest we leave in God's hands and if you are registered to vote then I think you should exercise that right one of the reasons why I feel that it's important and I know there'll be many critics who watch this stream who believe that Christians should have nothing at all to do with politics I think that's quite narrow-minded to be honest with you I really do and having spent some time in Nations where people don't have uh the the freedom to express themselves then I am so thankful that you and I have at least one vote and uh we have a whole lot more than that on our knees we can shift a lot of things in prayer so we want to be praying this week for the election uh I want to mention a few things too you want to just say how wonderful the time together was in North Carolina we would have left to have had all of you there with us but we were thrilled that many were able to come and I didn't do a lot of recruiting Because I have a burden for what's happening here and I wanted the service here to be blessed but everyone who went was a special blessing to me and as a pastor it's a wonderful feeling to look out and see familiar faces your own folks amen and smiling and pulling and they were used sister Anita was greatly used to sing in every service that she was there and God ministered and he moved and for me it was like a family reunion and I and I can't even tell you how I got so overwhelmed when I when I got there to the church I got so overwhelmed I had to go hide in the office because my emotions got so excited and so stirred to see people that I hadn't seen some in in 30 years some in 20 25 years uh particularly you all know that in in Holiness when I was many years ago in the Holiness movement there was a couple who meant a lot to me Jeff and Amanda rooksager and I had no idea that she even knew the meetings existed much less that she was going to be there the first night and when she got out of the of the car it was a real surprise and so many more and we appreciated it and of course Sister Evelyn was so faithful and and we appreciated that as well we had a couple uh what what are the names of the young couple from Indiana Lavina Levina and David and Levina uh so our one of our Couples from the former Amish group they came and were with us and uh even brother brother Daniels longtime friend uh Lisa and her husband and family were there and God was there most of all his presence was real they're hungry people everywhere uh tired of church ready to experience God when they come together like you've had the privilege of experiencing him here this morning that's him he was moving among us we have so much to be thankful for and then uh tomorrow is the birthday of a friend of mine I have not mentioned him too much we are Facebook friends but we've had communication together his name is brother Eric Arnold he's in France serving the lord with his wife and children there and I was so blessed on Friday night an elderly couple came up after the service and introduced themselves to me as his parents who live not too far from the church so it was really wonderful his mother said to me I don't quite understand the connection between you and Eric but she said I'm just so glad that we got to be here and I think we were probably a little more traditional than than maybe what they would be used to but they were so supportive and came back the next night and uh Eric when you hear this uh Monday November the 7th is your birthday so I'm going to wish you a happy birthday since I'm talking about your precious parents uh and then Friday of this coming week is a day that we have celebrated around here a long time because so many so many people celebrated special days on Veterans Day November the 11th that was brother tremaine's birthday that was the tremaine's wedding anniversary which would be over way over 70 years now that they would have been married sister Hoyer turns 102. on Friday 102. that's getting on up there and we send our love to them she is certainly not as healthy as she has been in most of her life but uh there is some reason why the Lord has left her here brother Hoyer left us many years ago so let's pray for sister Hoyer this week that God's perfect will be done in her body and her life and then Amelia where is Millie uh hold up your hands so everybody can see you she has a birthday she's definitely not going to turn 102. how old is Amelia going to be seven that's a great age and uh God bless and happy birthday to Millie and Jonathan Hollis who was here during our camp meeting who means so much to us his birthday is on Friday as well on Veterans Day so if you get a chance to greet him on social media do that he texted last night to say that he was invited by Brother Elam Fisher to come up and and go to service with them it's about an hour and a half from where Jonathan lives and he'll be back down here in a few weeks to be with us so he was going to go to church with them today which I'm very excited about that isn't the Lord good are you all tired of me talking I hadn't even started preaching yet well sometimes we need the news maybe you're not interested but you're only you there may be somebody that is I don't know what key to you [Music] you grew so tired of the conflict the pain and the fire and the storms and sometimes give your doubts and [Music] you've even questioned foreign [Music] foreign that's when I heard my Lord whispered to me oh he said indoors [Music] I know you are fighting [Music] away at last who has [Music] Tim give me that first person you've grown so tired [Music] all the pain fire and the storms [Music] in your doubt had come to you 've even question oh where is the Lord you know I have prayed in the Darkness [Music] I could see waiting [Music] for me that's when I heard foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] words [Music] with just a few days remaining somebody tell me what is a good soldier to we must order [Music] don't you give up now I know [Music] but you're gone away [Music] more timeless oh now we know that the Lord is [Music] we see God's prophets words coming true oh not with just a few days remaining church tell me what is a good soldier to do stand and sing it with me would you we must endure [Music] hold fast [Music] yes [Music] [Music] but you're all the way [Music] oh had the last whole fast go bow [Music] s [Music] we can't give up now we can't get weary now [Applause] we've got to keep pressing on with everything that's in US the victory is in sight oh Hallelujah somebody know we're in the home stretch now if you made it this far surely you can endure the Bible said he that endureth till the end the same shall be saved it's not those that start out in the race and fall by the wayside but it's those who keep running you don't always have to run fast you just got to keep moving you'll be disqualified if you stand still too long you just got to keep moving and that's what we're doing by the grace of God remain standing let's thank the Lord for the musicians for the leading of the worship [Applause] we're going to be reading again in Exodus chapter 33. if you want to go back there and we'll welcome all of you who are streaming this service from Southern Norway from Indiana Arizona South Africa the Netherlands Ghana uh all of British Columbia all of that on YouTube many from Arkansas many who are streaming from many places on Facebook I can't it won't let me see all the places but we just send love and greetings to every one of you you who are on the app no matter how you're tuned in with us today we're blessed to have you we have so much to be thankful for I won't say that again you didn't hear me we've got so much to be thankful for you you don't have to wait till until the third Thursday of the month to be thankful we've got to be living this life of thanks living instead of just Thanksgiving right it's a life and we have so much to be thankful for let's go to the word Exodus 33 and 10 and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of noon a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle verse 12 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou Wilt sin with me yet thou Hast said I Know Thee by name and thou has also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will do what I will give thee rest Moses is waiting on the name of a companion who will go with him leading the children of Israel forward he said you say you know my name and yet you have not revealed to me yet who will go with me and this was God's answer my presence shall go with thee and wherever the presence of God is the person of God shows up I will go with thee my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and listen to what Moses said and he said unto him next verse excuse me and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence before you're seated I want to call your attention to verse 13. again now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated today show me now thy way that I may Know Thee I want to say to you body of Christ that it is not enough to know the will of God we want to know the will of God without knowing the will of God we wonder aimlessly directionless we we have a tendency to go in circles in fact because we don't like to go too far beyond our comfort zone you want to help me we we like to stay in our familiar circumstances so sometimes like Johnny Crowe we just go in circles or or like the 12-foot Shuffle we just go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and if someone says something to it without moving I'm moving I'm moving I'm moving yeah yeah you're moving you're not stationary but you're not going anywhere either you're moving but you're not going anywhere you're just going back and forth perhaps circling around your comfort zone so I want to say to the church today it's not enough to know the will of God I think that sometimes our attitude is the highest is to know the will of God if I can know God's will for my life then I have really achieved something well I want you to know that until we know the way of God and until we are able to understand the ways of God it does us very little good to know the will of God because you can know the will of God and not understand the ways of God and Miss what you know you may know that it is God's will for you to go to a particular place but if you don't know the way of God you won't know how to get there in God's will you understand and and how do we learn the way of God how do we learn the ways of God we look to the word if we want to know where God is we look to the word if we want to know where God has been we look to the word if we want to know where God is going we look to the word so that old dusty Bible sitting on the coffee table in your house it's time now to use it for more than a decoration it's time now to use it as a road map because God's holy word and printed form has been preserved for us as a road map it not only reveals to us the answer to every question in life it not only reveals to us the will of God for our lives but it also reveals the way of God Moses said I want to know your way that I may know you you see it's not enough to know what God has done you've got to examine what he's done to begin to try to discover his heart you may not always always know the wise but the more you learn about the way of God the way that God moves the way that God thinks the way that God functions the more you learn about the way of God the easier it becomes to get you into the will of God because you're not walking around with hobnailed shoes like fools Where Angels Fear to trod one of the things we need to discover about the way of God is how to reverence him we've got to discover how to reverence God you know the prophet tells us how to to understand how to reverence God he gives us a road map he said you've got to learn to reverence the men of God [Music] I'm not preaching about me I'm preaching about you because I consider this room to be filled with men and women of God the word the phrase man of God is not just the pulpit it's the Servants of Jesus Christ if we are serving him we are men and women of God and we must learn to to honor one another so that we can learn to reverence God if you can't honor the one that God sins [Music] then you'll miss God altogether yes I'm not preaching on on respecting your pastor it's a good message it ought to be preached from time to time I'm talking about learning to honor and respect one another you see I don't want you to be beholden to one another I don't want you to be obligated to one another I want you to learn to walk with each other on the same course because you've understood the will of God and you're discovering the way of God I'll tell you God's way is not like man's way you know God just gives and gives and gives and gives and gives and gives and he never makes us feel guilty for what he's given to us have you ever had God hold anything over your head that he did for you I wonder how many times God has watched you and I walk away from his Blessing to go do our own thing could have snatched us back I wish somebody would help me preach today I'm going to preach anyway but I wish you'd help me a little bit let's share the labor isn't that a good way to do it let's cooperate God could have snatched us back he could have took the sucker right out of her hand he's the one that put it in there he could have took the lollipop back he could have said you no longer deserve that but how many of you know God that's just not who God is God doesn't want you walking with him because you feel obligated walking with him he wants you moving with him because you love him and because you wouldn't dare walk with anybody else come on this is not you'll learn to love him you know they used to say that in the early days of fixed marriages and I honestly believe some of you would be very well off in good shape to let me fix yours because some folks ain't doing so good by themselves they need a little help picking you'll get a rotten fish to start with you're going to end up with a rotten fish you better get the right one to start with you better start with the right one so you can finish up with the right one you know some old boy will make you think he's the only one there is some gal will make you think she's the only chance you got the fish God's Great Big ocean is full of fish you don't need but one and that's not the one you want that's the one God wants for you and once you know that let me just ask you this get my little something in here now once you know that what else you need to know um well we're getting to know each other once you've already discovered God's will then you're just trying to discover his timing because the more you know about somebody the more you maybe talked right out of it sometimes it takes some rough Edge knocking around to get us where we can howl getting two walk together except they be agreed I want you to know I wouldn't begin to consider someone that didn't have the faith that I have I wouldn't begin to consider someone in this hour that didn't believe the message of the hour and able to recognize the servant that God sent in this day because the one thing I know about this message is the prophet tells us that the bride will know the message for her day and in one place he said that's part of the proof that she has received the Holy Ghost now I know we all have to come in contact with it that's the grace of God to us we have to come in contact with it and we don't all come in early and we don't all hear it early but it's important that we hear it and if you think God is Raising you up to correct that message you are way too late producing nothing that compares with that you see God has given us a great understanding of his word is that all truth no there's some truth that's not there what do you mean by that that that's what he said I'm just telling you what he said you see there's truth out there that we may not have yet come into in our life it's there it's Lee's in the message in seed form it lays in the word in seed form we just have to come to the place in our life where we can receive it and if somebody has a hungry and a sincere heart before God God desires to reveal to them the truth and the truth is not to take us back under the law the truth is to fill us with God's grace help us to appreciate all the things that get us to this place and I believe in memorials I believe in memorials I believe in memorials I believe in giving memorials and raising memorials and marking memorials I believe in remembering things that God has done for us along the way I believe in remembering the Feast of Jehovah because that helps us to understand how he did and why he did what we know he has done by coming in word form in in flesh form rather the word in flesh form and paying a price it's in the typology of the older Covenant that we are able to see the reality of what the Holy Ghost has done for us it was not enough for God to be above us I think I said this the last time we were together that was good but that wasn't enough it wasn't even enough for God to be with us in Yeshua in Jesus Emmanuel God With Us we needed God who would want to go back to God above who would want to just go back to God you know like like we've said here many times before people say oh I just wish Jesus would walk in that door and I'd tell him something or I'd ask him something or he would do something for me no you missed him he already walked in that door this morning sat down on your pew he's now living in his people brother random told us if Jesus were to walk in here in some form and walk up and down the aisle he couldn't do anything else for you that he hadn't already done isn't that good to know because the responsibility is no longer on him it's on you to sit there as the word Goes Forth and to reach up like that little elderly sister did and said hey 35 years my feet have been crippled because somebody dropped me but I hear the wire and it's made up my mind for me whoa Hallelujah that's who God is he wants us to hunger not only for his hand what he will do for us but he wants us to be hungry for who he is and in order to know who he is we have to look at his ways and we don't just look at what he has done we look at what he is doing and we look forward to what he is going to do Moses was bold I got to hurry because this was what we covered the last time we were together Moses was very bold he had that kind of relationship with God Moses told God that he didn't he did not know the angel that he wanted to sin to lead them God said I'm going to send my angel before you Moses said that's nice I don't know him that's pretty bold if you don't mind I'd like a little more than just the angel to come I'm looking for something else Lord you know my name and my desire is to know you more and I want you to lead the way for us and he actually went one step further or just leave us where we are it's not more about church we need to know not not more about how to do Church that's not what we need we need to know more about him and when I'm talking about knowing him I'm not talking about head knowledge I'm talking about lay your head on his chest kind of Revelation [Music] there you discovered his heartbeat there you learn his ways anybody with me good many years later the Apostle Paul expressed the same desire to know him in Philippians 3 8-10 in the Amplified and yes I read it when we were together but I'm going to read it again and I'm going to try to read it without a lot of comment that's going to be hard yes furthermore I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the Priceless privilege the overwhelming preciousness the surpassing worth and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of this is powerful and of progressively becoming somebody say progressively you don't know all of him today you're going to know right how many of you have served the Lord 50 years or more hold up your hand to know about him it's the progression of knowing it's the it's the revealing it's the unveiling it's the peeling off are you with me it's the peeling off of every layer that helps us it's watching him and every one of a life situations how he moves he doesn't always come when we want him he doesn't always come the first time we call him but he hears us and he's never late he's always right on time I want you to consider a time in your life that you prayed and you prayed and you prayed and it didn't look like God was hearing you and then all of a sudden it shifted and you were able to look back and say hey God was with me all along I wasn't by myself he was with me all along this is part of the discovery this is part of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with him of perceiving and recognizing and understanding him more fully and clearly for his sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish refuse drags in order that I may win gain Christ the anointed one and I and that I may actually be found and known as in him to be found in him you want to know where I where I'm hiding I want to hide in him if you miss me I want you to be able to find me in him it's powerful not having any self-achieved righteousness that can be called my own based on my obedience to the Law's demands ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired but processing excuse me but possessing that genuine righteousness which comes through faith in Christ the anointed one the truly right standing with God which comes from God by what by Saving faith for my determined purpose is that I may know him that I may become progressively more deeply and intimately acquainted with him perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of his person more strongly and more clearly and that I may in that same way come to know the power outflowing from his what from his resurrection which it exerts over Believers and that I may so share his sufferings as to be continually transformed in spirit into his likeness even to his death in The Hope in the hope now traditionally the church has looked at this fellowshipping with his suffering as though we must suffer to be like him and suffering is a part of this life we're going to suffer our character is being honed we are being shaped to him but I want you to know that your suffering is not even Worthy to begin to be compared with his so I heard people casually saying things that aren't really biblical in Doctrine or at least an understanding of the word you know oh I'm just suffering I'm just suffering for Jesus I'm just under so much persecution uh God is really having to do all this you know and and I'm just hurting like he heard and and going through so much so that one day I can be what I'm supposed to be folks I want you to know that suffering alone and hardship alone and sickness alone and grief alone won't make you like him it's only when you begin to understand that when he suffered when he suffered you were in him you came here by Grace having already experienced the reality of suffering with Christ before you ever went through a trouble before you ever had a problem help me now before you ever had loss or grieve for a bad marriage or whatever it was you had already experienced something in a greater dimension than the one you're now walking in because the Bible says that when he suffered we suffered not only with him we suffered in him and when he died we were in him that's what the word says this is New Testament now oh yes it's the book it's the book and when we died in him when he died we died in him so I've already suffered with Christ I may have some more hardships down here but you can't judge a man by his hardship because hardship can make you bitter understanding your fellowship with his suffering can make you better understanding that you've never suffered alone anything you've suffered you suffered connected to Christ you were fellowshipping with him in his suffering and therefore everything he obtained is my inheritance anybody with me that's why if somebody gets a little something wrong along the way they're not lost because they already died in Christ amen and the Holy Spirit is among us to pull us back to say wait a minute you've got to correct your course that's not how Christian that's not how a child of God lives that's not how a child of God speaks that's not how a child of God treats one another you see I came to a place in my life one time where I greatly resented my mother's dependence on me I know it sounds awful I know it sounds terrible but it's my testimony you can't take it away from me I won't try to change your testimony but everybody likes to be appreciated you know because of that I taught my children something because of this struggle that I had for years with feeling like my own mother was taking advantage of me in life I'll explain it in a minute I see some of you already looking at me like I'm you know the worst of the worst that's all right we've all got our stuff just the best with me we've all got our stuff and the truth of Truth so but because of that I taught my children to thank to be thankful and when they get up from the table I taught them to say thank you my obligation it's my obligation while they're little and in our home to provide a meal but we didn't just give them grub we tried to give them what they wanted we tried to give them something nice when we had when we had steak they had steak or we didn't have steak it's real simple you don't have to live by that there was never a time that I could afford a steak for my wife and I but wouldn't wouldn't buy it for the children if if we couldn't afford it we all ate hamburger right see but if they got it whatever they got I wanted them to be thankful and I wanted them to express it I know it's not only in words my wife thanks me I didn't make her but my wife because it's been the atmosphere of our home my wife says thank you for dinner honey if we're out to eat she's my wife I'm not gonna let her starve I want her to eat well but it really means something to me when my wife says thank you for dinner it means because everybody wants to be appreciated I loved doing for my mother because she went without and she suffered on my behalf and I told you those stories she I I went to a yuppie school and I didn't have what a lot of other kids in my school had but my mother wanted to make sure that I had something to represent what was going on and so I may not have had two shirts with an alligator on it but I was going to have one my mama was going to make sure I know some of you think that's just silliness but my mother was going to make sure all my classmates had one for every day but I was going to have at least one and when the swoosh come foreign see all you folks running around thinking the swoosh is new it's old we was wearing Nike before you was born and I may have had schoolmates that had a pair of every color and I didn't and I didn't feel bad but my mama was going to make sure that she did without so that I could have one pair and so I I enjoyed in life being able to give my mother things that she would not be able to afford and my mother from the time I married well wait no way before then from the time I pastored at 17. from 17 on my mother never had to pay a utility bill from the time I was 17 forward my mother never had to pay her own utility bill I paid them for her and I did it with joy and I enjoyed doing it until I didn't one day thank you brother somebody understands me one day a little bitterness got in my heart [Music] a little bitterness got my heart my mother had a lot of shoes and she had a lot of nice clothes and she had a lot of nice things and she spent a lot of money on nice things and she was able to do that because I was paying her bills and I was thankful to do it my mama was still working by the way for most of that time until I didn't something got in my heart I don't know where it started I don't know how I let it get there because I'm being one thousand percent sincere when I tell you it was a real joy and pleasure to do it many many many many many many times until one day it wasn't and I hated the way I felt I was ashamed of the way I felt I was ashamed for anybody to know how I felt and I just prayed Lord help me I don't want to have that in my heart I want to I want to continue to have joy and and to be thankful that you have let me have my mother and to help give her back some of the things that she provided for me so I struggled and I prayed and I struggled and I prayed and I struggled and I prayed and I kept it pushed down until one day a Sunday morning it tried to overwhelm me I don't remember the circumstances of why but we were having communion that night and I knew that that bitterness in my heart and that deep resentment in my heart well were you pastoring of course I was pastoring I've been doing that since I was 17. were you still preach of course I was preaching I wish we lived in a world that if I didn't feel like doing it I didn't have to do it but once you accept the responsibility you don't get to check out because you don't feel Worthy or because you don't feel like doing it or feel like coming you just you just have to do it you you just make up your mind and you do it so I couldn't I couldn't res step aside while I got it all worked out I had to go there knowing [Music] that I was sharing the struggles that as others were struggling I was also struggling but you know what God met me oh after that service everybody went to lunch I didn't go to lunch I went back up into the church to pray and I stayed there all afternoon and I said Lord I got to get this out of my heart and I knew that I had to ask my mother to forgive me and I knew that was going to hurt her I knew it was going to hurt her I knew it had never really occurred to her because I had never treated her any different I just kept doing what I had always done I didn't let her know what was eating at me it took all afternoon for me to pray through and touch God but when the victory came it came it was a Deliverance it was a mighty Deliverance because I needed it where is Joshua come and drive this off honey do something to help me I think I've I've over sweated it or something you hear it making a rattling sound when God delivered me he delivered me and I said Lord you're going to have to give me Grace to talk to my mother because I don't want to hurt her and you know I don't want to take more time on that hurry honey uh here's one I just don't think I can get to the connection praise the Lord God is so good [Music] foreign [Music] me isn't he good in the good all I want to say about that is when it came time before the service to start and I had to talk to my mother about what was in my heart she was so gracious the spirit of the Lord was still present because of all the praying through and I was able to apologize to my mother for carrying that and she was able to apologize to me for taking it for granted she never saw it all I needed was every six months or so a thank you you know honey thank you for what you do for me thank you that you paid the bills you didn't have to do that thank you that was all I needed but she didn't realize I needed it so she couldn't give me what I needed because she didn't really know what I needed anybody following me you may think that's so small and so silly but I want you to know the enemy was going to use something that small to Sidetrack me I knew I wasn't going to take communion with that in my life I knew that once God shined the Highlight on that that I had to do something to get that right and to get it under the blood because I didn't want to carry that forward in life I want you to know this is an hour that God's spotlight [Music] is shining around us and God desires to highlight things in our heart he desires to highlight things in our life that's keeping us from fully abiding in Christ and fellowshipping with both the suffering and the blessing and understanding who we really are to be in this hour so if God brings something to your life to your mind to Your Heart by the Holy Spirit I beg you to go before the Lord I beg you to spend time with him and I'm a testimony that no matter how big or small he knows how to go down to Grub the very root of it and to get it out of your life The Cry of the remnant bride in this hour is we want to know you [Music] you have to help me we want to know you we want to enter into more intimate fellowship with you more than power more than signs more than wonders more than Miracles we're running after him Hallelujah foreign good thank you honey thank you praise the Lord praise the Lord we want to fully understand the finished work that he has accomplished not only for us but what he has accomplished in US so that our striving and our soulish efforts can cease Moses experienced an encounter fellowship with God face to face the face of God speaks of his spirit this would mean the spirit of Moses having deep fellowship with the spirit of God how many of you want to understand that how many of you want to practice that in your life it means drawing string I need more volume here drawing strength and life directly from his source is a part of the bridal paradigm he doesn't just call you his bride so that he can put you on display he calls you his bride because he wants you to gain your strength and your sustenance from him he wants you to be connected to the Vine down a little he wants you to be connected to the vine he is the vine we are the branches you understand that in Genesis 1 the connection is made between the face of God and the God and the spirit of God moving on the water when we read that his Spirit was moving upon the Water the actual English says upon the what the face of the deep when we read in Revelation 17 and verse 15 we read that water speaks of multitudes of people it even speaks of Fellowship among those people and we read in second Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse 18 if you'll put that up there we're going to we're going to make some progress here in just a minute we're going to push back in but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image how every time you come into the presence of God you touch his glory every time you touch his glory you grow I said every time you touch his glory you grow I said every time you touch his glory you grow when we come into His presence we grow we are being changed from glory to glory we don't come here to worship to see one another we're not here to see what somebody else is doing what kind of a manifestation somebody else has we're here to put our eyes on the Lord to gaze upon him with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord that we might be changed into the same image by touching the glory from glory to glory he's changing me even as by the spirit of the Lord as we begin to enter as his bride into that kind of Union that Moses was crying out for we are changed into his image not by what we hear but by what we see somebody said what do you mean doesn't the word change us yes the demonstration not the printed page it's the Living Word that changes us when you and I can get in the presence of the Lord and we begin to see the living word among us and we start ignoring one another's shortcomings and faults and failures and mistakes and bumps and hardships and whatever else we've been through as a body when we get to a place that only we can see the Lord we're not looking at each other we're not worried about someone being a little louder than someone else or someone doing a little differently than someone else we're not here to look at each other we're here to look upon the Lord somebody said isn't that isn't that difficult to do not when he shows up he was here this morning all we have to do is make a choice I'm not going to look at others I'm not going to look at my circumstances I'm not going to look at how hard it was to get here this morning I'm going to see the Lord because the more we look to the Lord the more we're changed so it's by seeing the lord it's by seeing the Living Word it's by seeing the manifestation of his presence that we are changed it's by touching his glory that we are changed with open face I've been feeling in my spirit for a long time at what we need more than anything else more than a new revelation is a better understanding of what God has already revealed a deeper revelation of what has already been accomplished on our behalf perhaps it will deliver somebody from the gerbil wheel of performance perhaps it will cause somebody to realize it's not by our carnal striving that we become like him it's not actually by doing that we become like him it's by waiting it's by waiting they that what they that is the same word that's used for making rope I told you that some time ago that word wait in Hebrew similar to the word that's used for weight in in Greek in the New Testament when it says and she arose and waited on them it doesn't mean she did nothing it means that she served their needs that's the New Testament that's Greek in Hebrew the word that's used for weight on the Lord is the same word that's used for making rope it means The Taking of of many small strands and binding them together so when Isaiah prophesied they that wait upon the Lord he was saying those who bind themselves to the Lord those who hold on to the Lord no matter what's going on in life no matter what's going on in circumstances those who hold on with everything they've got we might say it like the world says it sometime those who who feel like they're losing so they tie a knot on the rope and hold on to the knot let circumstances of Life cause you to be separated from the only one who can guide you through them don't let it break your fellowship with the word don't let it break your fellowship with the glory we need the glory we need the presence of the Lord to be changed all of our worship is not Warfare every song is not to be about Warfare I believe in Warfare oh believe me you don't have a choice but to believe if you're attached to this word you don't have a choice but to believe it it's your everyday reality when I got to North Carolina I dreamed all night long the first night one dream after another about witchcraft all night long all night long and the Lord was dealing with me about a stronghold of Witchcraft in the area and it didn't start with the dark arts and it didn't start with the new age it actually started with rebellion in the hearts of church people it just started with rebellion in the hearts of church people you know the Bible Likens that Rebellion that lack of obedience to Witchcraft an idolatry the Lord showed me that that's how it started but because it had been a stronghold in the area it had caused a gathering of those kinds of things into that into that place I didn't know where the church was and so I didn't even address it until Sunday morning but God did some pretty amazing things but on Saturday night as we were leaving the church we I first I reached out to one of the brothers and I said brother are you aware of a lot of Witchcraft or something like this in this area and he said well no not not what really comes to mind and another thing really comes to mind then he wrote back and he said well there is a woman that they've called to which who who practices these kinds of things but I think she may be dead now then he wrote back a few minutes later and he said well there is a a witchcraft New Age store just a few doors down from where I live I said okay well that that might be a connection when we left when we left the church on Saturday night to go down and have some food and fellowship with the church people we had to drive right through downtown Morganton to get there and in order to do that we had to drive down where parties were taking place on the downtown Square for Halloween so there's a man standing out there on the corner breathing fire swallowing fire with a big crowd around then we go down here and there's some kind of rock concert going on and they're twisting and gyrating and doing all kinds of things Sunday morning when I mentioned that kind of a spirit in the area there's a sister who comes there and she said you're mighty right brother Shelley you don't know how right you are she said Monday night Halloween night every year every year the witches come together in Morganton and dance in the street she said they block off the roads and the witches come from everywhere and and there's a one time a year that they're parading and proud of of their of their Curious Arts now I tell you something if you don't think that shifts an atmosphere in a region and so we prayed about that all night long one dream I had I was standing in a windowsill standing looking at her windowsill and someone had had this row of statutes statues idle looking things and uh crystals and and Stones hanging down hanging down in the window and these little statues lined up across the the aisle and the spirit of the Lord says to me see what you can do so I began to pray against the Witchcraft that was attached to those crazy looking things in the window and every one of them at the same time laid down on the windowsill and and the Lord said I'm giving you authority over that so that that makes you want to pray and I prayed a little longer and they begin to roll back and forth under the under the inspiration of that prayer never dream dream After Dream After Dream it just went on all night long on on Saturday night I dreamed all night long about eagles if every dream the first night was about witchcraft ever dreamed the last night was about eagles I saw a storm of eagles the spirit of the Lord took me here to the parking lot of this church I'm standing in the parking lot and I hear a voice calling for a perfect Eagle storm I said well I've heard about a perfect storm I know about a perfect storm but I don't know what a perfect Eagle storm is but you know I began to learn because the spirit of the Lord began to blow and the wind was blowing Eagles he was blowing Eagles from every kind of Direction Gathering them up over the top of the parking lot I I saw golden eagles I saw bald eagles I saw some Eagles uh species I didn't recognize and I even saw several Snow White Eagles in in the storm and it was a perfect storm the wind blowing in all four directions blowing Eagles remember what God Said over this place in the beginning he took us to Matthew where the carcass is where the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together and God was gathering them up in the air way up in the air they were blowing in from all four directions and when they got over the campground they began to turn together rotate together and it formed a perfect Eagle storm and is that perfect storm like a tornado begin to blow around I watched it as it began to lower itself bringing those Eagles right down onto them well what does that mean well I don't know what it means I don't know every detail of what it means but I know what we've been told we'll be the anointing that gets the ride through this last hour it's a flying eagle anointing Revelation it's the anointing of a flying eagle I know what a perfect storm is in the natural and I tell you that's what we need to meet The Perfect Storm we need a storm of Overcomers we need some Overcomers to blow around us amen and you know what I believe we're talking to some this morning I believe there's others I believe bone is about the fine bone hear him hear him I believe bone is about to find bone I believe God's about to gather some bones together in the graveyard I believe God's about to raise up a mighty Army on his feet that just a few hours before was nothing in the world but a bunch of bleached out dry bones son of man to that do you believe do you believe do you believe that these bones can live again Lord thou knowest Lord thou know it Lord send a perfect Eagle storm blow them in blow them to the Refuge blow them as you said you would give us Grace to be able to to nurse them to nurse them when they come I said Lord we can't be overwhelmed you've got to be in your timing because you've got to be able to help the wounded those those moping molting Eagles those Eagles that are forgotten how to fly God said they won't have to fly on their own I'll just gather a perfect storm and draw them myself all they'll have to do is yield to the wind oh there's a whole lot in that is anybody hearing me so I've been feeling that more than needing a new revelation we need a deeper understanding we need a deeper understanding of what God's already done on our behalf to finally begin to see once and for all all that he has completed for us a few more minutes if you give them to me second Corinthians 3 13 and 14 and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded you ought to hear this I wish the whole Messianic world could hear this I wish they could read these verses for themselves they might not be so divided and full of hatred toward one another if they could catch this they've gone the way of the denominational churches if they could just hear what the word of the Lord is saying here he said not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil which Veil which Veil is what the veil can be removed God's going to remove that veil of national blindness one of these days Israel is going to see her Messiah for who he is if you believe that same man and the word of the prophet of ultra will be fulfilled all of Israel he said all of Israel shall be saved that is the promise of the word so it's not missionaries we need it's getting us along to where we need to be so that God can do what he said he wanted to do he said in second Corinthians 3 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord [Music] the veil shall be taken away everything that is separated Israel from their Messiah will one day be turned away it'll one day be torn down every Veil that has tried to separate you from an intimate Walk With Jesus Christ that same veil has to come it has to come down the only way it'll come down is for us to turn to the Lord just like the Jewish people just like National Israel it's when we turn to the Lord it's when we Rend our hearts and not our garments it's when we renew our Union with him that we can come to that place is anybody with me oh there's so much let me see got a few more minutes I want to get to something but I don't know if we can or not I Exodus 34. 29 and 30. and it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sinai where the two tables of testimony in Moses hand when he came down from the mount that Moses wished not that the skin of his face Shone while he talked with him and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him there had been a Transfiguration take place verse 33 until Moses had done speaking with him he put a veil on his face but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him he did what he took the veil off nothing nothing needs to be there nothing that will separate you from intimate face-to-face fellowship with the spirit of God nothing needs to remain he took the veil off until he came out and he came out and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded there needed to be a separation there needed to be something in that hour so that the people could look Beyond The Vessel they didn't need to see The Shining face of Moses they needed to see the living reality of God Almighty who was working in and through Moses you cannot put your eyes on the vessel you've got to get your eyes on the God who called him or her amen you've got to get your eyes on God Moses saw Glory the glory was a manifestation of God's love and mercy what Moses endeared the people feared their flesh separated them from being able to fellowship with that Glory sometimes today people feel the Holy Ghost and they get afraid if he touches you if the spirit of God touches you he's simply reaching out to you in love he would never hurt you the Holy Ghost would never make a fool of you Lord Rim the Veil Lord we're in the veil that seeks to separate us from having intimate fellowship with you are you with me what would God be able to do if we could keep our flesh down if we could keep our flesh from being a hindrance to the will of his spirit Israel was afraid but Mercy was behind that Veil Remember The Mercy Seat 25 years ago this month when my wife walked up the aisle of the church in Columbus she wore a veil her beauty was concealed the people were afraid of what they heard but Moses saw love he saw love manifested he saw love demonstrated When Stacy and I were married and she came down that aisle with her face covered by a veil but when we made our vows one to another her veil was lifted and I could see her with open face we made sure in the ceremony that her face was not veiled when we made our vows one to another because that is a moment that I needed to be able to look in her eyes and she needed to be able to look into my eyes and there didn't need to be any lace between us there didn't need to be any Veil between us I'm telling you there doesn't need to be a veil between you and the bridegroom in this hour and as I read to you a few weeks ago the spirit of the Lord said I am sending an anointing that will remove the final veils that separate my people from my presence I don't know about you but I'm signing up for that right now I don't want anything to stand between me and his presence when we made our vows one to another her veil was lifted and I could see her with open face I didn't kiss my wife in front of the church because we were we were teaching that a kiss should that that there should be no kisses until marriage and so I didn't want our kiss like that to be in front of the whole wide world we we made up for it later understand but what did what do you think that would have been if I would have tried to kiss her through that Veil that would be like washing your feet with your socks on who washes their feet leaves their socks on who's going to kiss their wife behind the veil we're not Muslim if you want to come into that kind of intimacy with Christ so that you can say like me like Moses said I want to know your way I want to know your way I don't want to go anywhere unless you go with us or maybe you're like Paul oh that I may know him that I may begin to understand what it means that I have already suffered with Christ if we don't understand that then our suffering now is wasted because we look to that as though it buys us something in the Kingdom your suffering does it buy you something in the Kingdom his suffering it's what broke loose all that the enemy had damned up anybody with me I want you to know Jesus removed that Veil that separated you from him the word has come and now we're not looking at the Lord through the lattice anymore it's springtime a turtle dove is cooing the Lord is in plain view that's why we needed the revelation of Jesus Christ anybody with me that's why we needed the revelation of Jesus Christ the church had looked at Christ for so many years behind the lattice behind the veil we needed an unveiling we need an apocalypsis we needed God to let us see who he really is a veil gone nothing to separate us nothing to stand between us and the word tells us that this was demonstrated in Mark chapter 15 if you want to look there in Mark chapter 15. verse 37 and 38 in Jesus cried with a loud voice he gave up the ghost it means your spirit left him and the veil of the Temple was written in Twain from the top all the way to the bottom the veil that had kept man from having free access Zechariah 3. full access unhindered access oh Church we're we're not beginning to live where we're called to live is that discouraging we we haven't we haven't begun to live where we're called to live well what do we do give up no we press harder we dig out all the roots of bitterness if there's any resentment I don't care who it's stored I got up here and told you my own testimony not because I was proud of it not at all but because I wanted you to know that any of us none of us are immune the enemy constantly wants something to root in US brother random said you got to take that grubhole out and you've got to Grub that thing out by the root you can't ignore it how many of you know you can't ignore these things bitterness can't be ignored jealousy can't be ignored resentment can be ignored a religious devil can't be ignored you've got to Grub it out it's got to be dealt with Jesus removed the Veil from top to bottom history tells us if you would have hooked up several yoke of oxen to both sides of that Veil you couldn't have ripped it apart with a rope it was so thick and intricately woven together there was no way that an earthquake or any other natural disaster would have had the effect of tearing that Veil from the top to bottom I know what happened and you do too the almighty hands of God came and he tore that Veil like a sheet of paper from top to bottom not from not man doing not man giving us access God giving us access and then he said come in come in the veil is gone can I have paragraph 69 and I'm going to close in just a moment I know I've struggled with you this morning please forgive me paragraph 69 this is Brother Branham serving communion father as we take this communion as we call it communion it is in remembrance of you and when this little beaten wafer touches our tongues and goes into our mouth may we recognize that he was bruised and mashed torn for our sins somebody read that next line and that there are so many types here his body was a veil of Flesh the scripture said so his body had to be torn not only did the veil of the temple have to be torn to expose religion but the veil of his body had to be torn so that the God that was in him could now become a part of who we are and that Veil that hid him from us now he's in us if you believe that same man now he's in us the Holy Spirit in the message desperations paragraph 189 for the random said I hold kosher bread wrinkled and broken representing the body of Jesus Christ through this Riven Veil we have you get to go where only the high priest could go he only could go one day a year you can go 365 days a year 24 hours a day because the veil is Riven because your death is in him because your suffering is in him because he paid the price with you in him brother man who said it's faith by identification I heard brother random say you've heard us preach this for years you hear him cry out he said I was with Paul Revere he wasn't with Paul Revere in the natural he was with Paul Revere Revere in the vacation he said I'm an American I was with Washington when he crossed the chili Delaware he wasn't with him in body he was with him by identification when Paul said I died in Christ he died in him by identification and we Fellowship that Truth by faith we now have access to the holy of holies in the last quotation while the musicians are coming why are people so tossed about good question why are people so tossed about why do the smallest things Shake people off why do we get so bewildered about the smallest things why do we let little things get us so thrown off he said into this holy Place follow me and this is the end into this holy Place Aaron went once a year the congregation watched him he was dressed right he had to be anointed right he had to walk right blessed be the Lord dressed right walked right anointed right he had Bell and a pomegranate on His Garment and as he walked they played holy holy holy unto the Lord with every little Ringling it was screaming out holy holy holy unto the Lord he taken before him a charger of blood the blood of the Lamb the blood of the atonement and he was anointed with the Rose of Sharon the anointing ran off his beards come to the hymns of his skirt and he was walking into the inner courts in the presence of God listen and when he went behind there the veil fell behind him he was shut out was he shut out or was he shut in both he was both shut out and shut in he was hid from the outer world out praise be to God there is a hiding place Abiding Place that we can walk in the presence of God and be hid from the things of this world you don't hear them no more I want you to listen do you know how I can say this to this church do you know how I can in good conscience say to this church we haven't even began to live in that place because I know your testimony is similar to mine very few of us can testify today that we're living in the soundproof place very few of us could testify in honesty and say by faith we are there I want to tell you by faith I'm behind the veil by faith I'm in Heavenly places right now seated with Christ Jesus by faith I'm in a soundproof room I'm in a soundproof World by faith but very few of us can testify of this in reality that means there's something else to get a hold of he said there is a hiding place Abiding Place that we can walk in the presence of God and be hid from the things of this world you don't hear them no more it's sound proof Hallelujah sound proof the world is on the outside gasping and looking but you're on the inside in the presence of the Eternal everlasting God I'm closing I don't want to put you on the spot but I'd like to see those who are not who are who have no doubt that you worshiped this morning in the presence of the Lord I'd like for you to raise your hand I want to put you on the spot now look there's a church full of people who said I don't have any doubt I was in the presence of the Lord when I was worshiping him you really believe that you believe that Aaron it's a good name you believe that then here's who you were standing with in the presence of the Eternal everlasting God eating from this manna that will last for spans of years hundreds of years original manna the kind that Moses got abide of the kind that they had on the day of Pentecost say manna same spiritual food eating from this manna that will last for spans of years hundreds of years it never contaminated never did it give out and a man that once walks into God foreign slip of the tongue but for me an inspiration a man that once walks into God oh that I may know him oh that I may know his ways and a man that once walks into God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of God eating the manna do you know what you had for breakfast this morning when you were entering into the presence of the Lord no it wasn't biscuits and gravy when you were worshiping and in the presence of the Eternal everlasting God you were eating something that comes from another realm another dimension it's the show bread it's the bread of his presence that's what it symbolizes when you come into the holy place from the outer court for the table of show bread was that was bread that represented his face it represented his presence when you are standing in the presence of the Eternal God he is giving you a taste of that presence bread you are tasting man huh that can never be contaminated because it's living reality not a printed page it's the living reality it's the evidence of the word it's spirit to Spirit Fellowship now let me just stop with this a moment because somebody started listening we rarely fellowship with one another on a spirit level most of my friends in the message would say in the soul but I say in the spirit and here's the reason why because the soulish realm is mined will and emotions most of our fellowship takes place in the flesh physical contact and in the soulish realm mine will and emotions we decide with our mind David whether we're going to fellowship or not well I think I'm gonna go home take a nap miss Fellowship this afternoon or I think I'm going to go over here and and and and I need some things at Walmart God be with you or I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna miss I'm not in a good mood I'm going I'm not going to have any fellowship with the folks today go do such and such I got this plan I got that we make it we make that up in our mind it's an act of our will we don't want to we don't we don't feel like it we don't we feel like it we do so we meet it with our mind and with our will we make a decision that's not Spirit Fellowship that soul Soul Realm and then that last part that big part of who we are emotions that's a big part we don't like what somebody says we get emotional we don't like what somebody does on the volleyball court back to that yeah we get emotional some people even get mad and go home emotional that's not Fellowship don't you go home and call that Fellowship that's not the kind of Fellowship we're talking about that'll never be enough I know there are people who want to be with somebody all the time I'm not that person I don't want to be with people all the time I love people but I don't be people all the time I like I like family time because you know what I realize I realize that if I carry a church full of people with me and I lose my own family I'm no success you understand so I like family time too and I like quiet time me time do what I want to do time which these days usually consists of sitting in a chair at one time it was gardening but now it's usually just sitting and we need that sometime we can be together and not be fellowshipping with one another on the kind of level I'm preaching about because if our emotions are still kicking in this is just one level of Fellowship but did you know there's a higher Fellowship do you know where that took place already today in this altar you were never more intimately connected with the one next to you than you were when you were standing here in the presence of the Lord if you indeed had shut off your emotions if you indeed had stopped looking around to see what somebody else was doing there is a fellowship in the spirit realm that takes place and it doesn't only have to take place during the worship time in the service it can take place when we're together sitting around the table you don't always have to be talking about the Lord to be having that kind of Fellowship it's on a deeper level it's not just the words coming out of your mouth it's just the Oneness you hear me sometimes saying when people come up here at the end of the service I say come closer come closer come fill in the reason I do that is because I don't want people to have to stand way up that aisle when there's plenty of room up here there's something about being close to one another I know we've come through flus and Coronas and all kinds of stuff but there's something about being close to one another in his presence it makes us feel connected it makes us feel one together and I want you to know you gain more strength from that moment than you do from the lunch that we're going to eat after a while it's the nourishing of the spirit man you are there to fellowship with God but what happens when my spirit is connected to him and your spirit is connected to him it pulls us into a Oneness whoa and then if you laugh louder than me I don't even notice I don't even care if you jump around a little more than I do or you do sing a little out longer louder I shut all that out because I'm so happy that you have connected with your creator I'm so happy that your spirit has connected with his so what we have to keep doing is checking our spirit to make sure that we've no longer shifted into some other kind of connection but we are ever just giving it just just and a man that once walks into God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he's in the presence of God eating the manna no wonder 12 o'clock nine o'clock later or anything he is living in the presence of the king [Music] doesn't matter doesn't matter long it's been doesn't matter how much time has expired he's living in the presence of the king no wonder every day is fine for him he knows where he is at he has found the secret place he has went behind the veil wait a minute what about that day that you wake up and your emotions are in a tether and your texts are going crazy and you're you're running all you gotta do is remember you found the place you've got to get back there you will have your peace Disturbed life will not out of that place but once you learn how to get there you can go again and again and again and again and again you don't have to be in church you can do it in your automobile you can pull over the side of the road and find the secret place he has went behind the veil the doors is closed behind him he don't see nothing of the world them doors was made sound proof by sheepskin and goat skin and this is made sound proof by the baptism of the holy spirit that high [Music] you mean it's not about tongue talking and jumping pews it's really about more than that it sure is it's about hiding a man in Christ yeah and there he becomes you read it and he walks daily before him in this manner oh thank you Jesus last paragraph what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of God all things are his then did you know the healing you need is yours did you know the Deliverance you need is yours do you know getting rid of that bitterness or resentment is yours it's yours it's there it's available all that God was he did what all that God was he poured into Christ all Christ was let's stand that day you'll know that I am in the father father in me and I in you all the privilege that the believer has if they could only accept it oh the privilege Hallelujah what are we going to worship with this morning this afternoon [Music] to worship him again before I leave I want to have some fellowship with his spirit I want to have some more manna [Music] that's where I'm alone too [Music] [Applause] [Music] I love you Jesus

satisfied in our relationship with you and you become the only thing that we need [Music] and so Lord for all the emptiness right now that's represented in this room I'm asking you to pour in every time we've tried to figure it out and come up with a plan to survive when you didn't call us to be survivors you called us to be Overcomers every time we've let the flesh choose our way instead of lingering in your presence to discover your way every bit of that has left us with an emptiness and tonight today we stand before you Desiring to be whole oh Lord like brother Greeley told us recently our cry like John's cry [Music] I must decrease he must increase now Lord I'm asking you to pour Who You Are into those empty places in every heart in every life right now and I prophesy and decree wholeness I declare that we will not move forward as a broken people and an empty people but I decree that we will move forward in wholeness because we found our place it's not always easy but we

wise as we move in this Authority make us wise as we speak let words of life and words of truth someone is living in the greatness [Music] a blended reality where the purest truth [Music] has been somewhat deluded and defiled I'm asking the Lord [Music] to give you integrity and total truth it's dangerous to believe a lie it's dangerous to speak a lie may God come right now and give us a Clear Vision of Truth when we when we describe our reality may we do it with accuracy without embellishment may we speak only truth May there be no mixture found in our mouth May there be no mixture found

when we love him we tell him about it we sit down and we adore him and worship him and see love drives us to that love drives us to that we are standing around this altar now to confess our love for him he already knows our heart but love drives us to tell him it compels us to tell him I want you to stretch your hands toward the lord and with your own language I want you to tell him how much you love him and appreciate his presence in your life and how far he's brought you from I want you to tell him right now that he means more to you than anything else Lord we love you we love you Lord

creative word of God it's closer to us than it's ever been would you just express your love for one another just now before we go would you discreet somebody I want you to say it I know it's more than words but I want you to say it to somebody brother I love you sister I love you I want you to say it until all the awkwardness is gone until it doesn't bother you anymore to say it I want Brothers to say it to Brothers until it's not awkward anymore to say brother I love you [Music] by this shall all men know that we have passed from Death unto life because of our love for one another [Music] because of our love for the brethren [Music] how can we love a God we haven't seen [Music] when we can't love a people that God gives us to love [Music] in the message from that time this came out Friday portion of this today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming returning good for evil that's real power that can love your enemy do good to those that do evil to you that's real power that's God's power yes Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not because of religious duty but from his heart brother Graham said that's what real power is being able to love those who have mistreated you and taken advantage of you may God help every one of us to pass this test I don't think sometimes we really understand the depth of love and what it really means to love him and to love one another but may God help us to do that it's not always easy there's no promise that it will be some folks are just a little more difficult to love than others but God places those in our life oh yes you've got some don't look at me [Music] unless I maybe you're looking at me because I'm the one that's harder for you to love maybe that's what it was about you were looking mighty strain I just can't hardly believe that all of us don't have one at least one and God put that one there [Music] God puts them there because you and I to overcome and be a love one another do you believe that oh Hallelujah did you miss somebody when you were given your love if you did make up for it now [Music] touching your grace [Music] in the cloud of the rise in your presence oh God [Music] my God in your [Music] that's where I am strong touching your grace [Music] in your presence oh god oh still would you father thank you for this time together in your word most of all we thank you for your wonderful presence that is Among Us and we ask o God that as our faith reaches up to take a hold of every promise that it will come to manifestation and fruition in our lives and we'll give you glory and honor and praise bless our fellowship together today may it not all take place in just the realm of the flesh or the emotions but may we be able to touch one another somehow in that realm of Holy Spirit your spirit that has regenerated ours in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen let me just say as you get ready to go that we will bring our food back and have Fellowship together we have a spring day in the middle of November we have a spring day to enjoy today two weeks from this Sunday we're going to be taking a risk next Sunday it's going to be quite cool I'm not sure what we'll do it could even be cooler two weeks from today but on November the 20th I want us before we take the tent down on November the 20th Sunday November the 20th I want us to have a lunch together a Thanksgiving lunch and we will celebrate that day together because Benny will be leaving to go out of town for the holiday brother Branham said that Thanksgiving is the only real American holiday and in one place he said the Christian holiday it's it's not just about a day but it's a day that we can remember if I had my choice I would like to have Thanksgiving dinner with all of you on Thursday but we have families you have obligations and we can't do that but we can do it Sunday so you may need a blanket you may need your wool coats that you buy and don't wear there's I doubt there's anybody maybe a small child that's outgrown that we might have to get a warm coat for but I think most of us have more coats hanging in the closet than we'll ever wear in in Alabama so you may need to get you one out because it could be cooler I I would dare say it will be cooler than it will be today but on November the 20th my wife will put a put a group together on Facebook for that I know some of you aren't on Facebook but we don't have any way of getting in touch with everybody over everything if you can't connect with us that way then you'll just have to be told to pass the word around let the information get out that's the best we can do we're just uh we just have lots of other things to think about so please help us get the word out but she will put together so that we can for sure focus on Thanksgiving dishes that particular lunch and make it just a real special time we're going to decorate the tables and we're going to make it just a real a real special time of remember I've wanted to do this for so long and it's been years since we've been able to do it one day in the near future may we have a warm comfortable cool place that we can Fellowship together in a building somewhere may God grant that for us but if he will help us and he will cause the weather to be mild a little bit possible if possible that Sunday November 20th we'll have a Thanksgiving lunch together and fellowship God bless you as you leave Tuesday night at seven o'clock you're dismissed to go in the lovely name of the Lord he's been good to us in your presence oh God meet back with us for lunch in your [Music] in your presence O Lord my God in your presence that's where I am strong seeking your face touching your grace in the cleft of The Rock [Music] presence presence [Music] that's where I belong [Music]
