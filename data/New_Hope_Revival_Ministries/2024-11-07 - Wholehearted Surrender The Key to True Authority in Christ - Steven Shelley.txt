Description:
Pastor Steven L. Shelley shares a powerful call to full devotion, urging believers to make Christ Lord of all aspects of their lives. He emphasizes that half-hearted commitment leaves no room for true transformation; Jesus desires our whole heart and mind. In the face of life's struggles and spiritual battles, Pastor Shelley reminds us of the authority and power given to us as adopted sons and daughters of God. True discipleship isn’t about comfort but about perseverance through trials, finding strength and victory in the Word. Only through full surrender can we manifest Christ within and stand strong in our purpose.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you won't let him be Lord of all he's not interested in being Lord at all he doesn't want half your heart maybe you think that's pickiness but he doesn't want half of you he doesn't want part of you he wants all of you he can't do much with half a head with half a body no no he needs a single-minded man I don't care how many rocks are being hurled your way how many arrows are being thrown at you how many vicious satanic lies are being cast your way you can't live another moment in that kind of place that's what pulls people to the edge you must not be double-minded you must let Jesus have preeminence in every situation look to him he's got it I see people who are under attack praising why because somebody here is winning the greatest battle ever fought minute by minute by minute by [Applause] minute not because we're superheroes or above humans but because we found the key the answer is in the word that he might have preeminence in all [Music] things Jesus was the pattern son somebody said well when they made him they broke the mold no no no no no God made him and recorded the mold because there must be many sons not many jesuses many sons all of creation granth yes sir travaileth for the manifestation of sons of God that's right who will rise up with some creative Authority if you're a true disciple of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Spirit washed and Sanctified by the word you've already been given the full endowment of power but you don't know what to do with it because it's only through sunship it's only through full adoption that we begin to understand the authority that's given to us as Sons to answer with the word instead of our emotion the enemy is asking a bunch of questions and if you answer with your emotion sir he's going to tie you up and Tangle you up in your own thoughts but if you answer with the word he doesn't know what to do with you right here's somebody here's a son that knows what to do with the power as long as the church doesn't know what to do with the power it's like a wasted commodity but when sunship becomes our understanding by Revelation then we know who we are because of whose we are yes and we begin to have confidence in the god who's living inside of us and we begin to understand that the mystery was always to be always to be Christ in you [Music] amen the hope of glory somebody said well if everybody knows that it's not a mystery everybody doesn't know it most people say it but they don't know it it's different it's not just having some little small deposit of a spirit in you and now I'm I'm I it's Christ in me no no no what house will you build me I'm not looking for a tent anymore I'm not looking for a tabernacle anymore I'm not looking for a for a wood and and Stone Temple anymore I'm looking for a tripartate man I'm looking for one who will yield himself Body Soul and Spirit to become an anointed man and an anointed woman and I want you to know that while you are tossing in the sea of Life somebody in the house is winning the battle Pentecost understood the filling but they didn't understand the positioning they didn't understand what full adoption looks like that releases The Authority when a son is properly placed when a son is properly put position you can't be properly placed or positioned if you're floating on a bed of ease cushions cushions and rose petals don't position Sons battles blood bullets sweat spit trenches that's what places and positions Sons it's battle
