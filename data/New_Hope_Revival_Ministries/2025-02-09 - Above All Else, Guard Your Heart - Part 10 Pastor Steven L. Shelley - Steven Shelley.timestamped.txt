[1:05:03] You Lord we thank you this morning for
[1:05:06] the privilege that we have of worshiping
[1:05:10] the Living
[1:05:12] God we recognize this morning that it's
[1:05:15] not optional for the sons of God it's
[1:05:19] not only a privilege but it's a
[1:05:23] responsibility we are intercessors
[1:05:26] representing the Heavenly in the earth
[1:05:30] and it is our connection when we worship
[1:05:33] you when we raise our hands when we sing
[1:05:38] praises when we speak praises to you we
[1:05:42] are
[1:05:44] abiding we are connecting
[1:05:48] ourselves to our life
[1:05:50] Source oh God may we see it not only as
[1:05:55] a blessing and a privilege but may we
[1:05:59] catch the responsibility that you have
[1:06:02] placed on our shoulders as Bridal
[1:06:07] intercessors it is our
[1:06:10] responsibility to make sure that the
[1:06:13] connection between Earth and Heaven is
[1:06:16] unbroken and that you have full Liberty
[1:06:19] in the house you enter in through the
[1:06:23] gate of your children we are the Gates
[1:06:26] we are the doors and you enter into the
[1:06:30] Earth through your sons through your
[1:06:33] bride and so Lord it is a great
[1:06:36] responsibility that we have as
[1:06:39] Gatekeepers of planet Earth may we
[1:06:43] understand that it is not based on how
[1:06:46] we feel or what we're going
[1:06:49] through it has nothing to do with our
[1:06:52] feelings but it is why we were born
[1:06:56] why we are here it's part of our purpose
[1:07:00] and we want to take full advantage of
[1:07:02] who we are as sons of God coming to the
[1:07:07] place of full
[1:07:09] adoption you are searching the Earth
[1:07:12] even now looking for a people that you
[1:07:15] can place the totality of your Authority
[1:07:19] in and we practice we practice as
[1:07:24] Believers using that Authority in our
[1:07:27] prayer life but Lord we believe there is
[1:07:30] a time just around the corner where that
[1:07:34] Authority will be expressed better in
[1:07:38] declaration in Prophecy in speaking your
[1:07:43] word that more will be accomplished by
[1:07:48] speaking your word by declaring and
[1:07:51] decreeing your word than was ever
[1:07:54] accomplished
[1:07:56] by traditional prayer so may we find our
[1:08:03] place in this
[1:08:05] hour as your
[1:08:08] Gates may we lift up our
[1:08:11] heads and welcome the King of Kings and

[1:15:36] musicians I commend you Benjamin for
[1:15:40] pushing through the distraction this
[1:15:43] morning that you had to work with I I
[1:15:46] commend you for not letting it
[1:15:48] discourage you but running on going on
[1:15:51] chasing after God I appreciate that it's
[1:15:55] why we have the Breakthrough moment that
[1:15:57] we have right now because he didn't give
[1:15:59] up you didn't give up amen that's how
[1:16:03] this thing works it's a partnership
[1:16:05] we're a team in this amen sometimes it
[1:16:08] feels like we're pulling alone but we're
[1:16:10] not and uh when we are few in number uh
[1:16:15] in the in the in the seriousness of the
[1:16:18] hour We're few in number sometime but
[1:16:20] when that is the case there is a great
[1:16:22] band of angels a host of Heaven that are
[1:16:26] pulling with us and for us and we are
[1:16:29] compassed about by such a great of cloud
[1:16:32] of witnesses who without us they have
[1:16:36] already laid to rest but without us they
[1:16:39] can never enter into the fullness of
[1:16:41] their Eternal Destiny they cannot be who
[1:16:45] God intended for them to be yet the
[1:16:49] fullness until you and I also finish
[1:16:52] this race they without us are not
[1:16:56] complete there's not a bride by by uh
[1:17:00] age or by or by Dimension or or by time
[1:17:03] frame there's one
[1:17:06] bride I know we hear the prophet
[1:17:09] sometimes differentiating between the
[1:17:12] Jewish bride and the Gentile bride but
[1:17:15] scripturally he's doing that to help us
[1:17:18] understand the difference between uh the
[1:17:20] dispensation of law instruction and the
[1:17:24] dispensation of Grace or what we call
[1:17:26] the church ages but the reality is they
[1:17:29] are not two Brides uh our God is not
[1:17:32] into
[1:17:34] polygamy he has one
[1:17:36] bride Paul the Apostle saw it in Romans
[1:17:39] 11 she is neither
[1:17:43] Jew nor Gentile she has been made one
[1:17:48] new
[1:17:50] man both Jew and Gentile one new man is
[1:17:54] in Christ Jesus the word says He has
[1:17:58] torn down the middle wall of
[1:18:04] partition and there is no more
[1:18:07] separation between Jew or Gentile male
[1:18:12] or female
[1:18:15] spiritually in eternity there is no
[1:18:19] difference there is difference in in
[1:18:22] time and in the natural Realm of of how
[1:18:26] we Minister unto the Lord and to each
[1:18:28] other but when God is getting ready to
[1:18:32] pour out himself he's not saying wait a
[1:18:34] minute I got to find a man I got to find
[1:18:36] a woman I got to I got to find a Jew
[1:18:39] I've got to find a gentile he said that
[1:18:42] in the last days he would pour out his
[1:18:45] Spirit
[1:18:46] upon All
[1:18:49] Flesh anybody believe that I know you're
[1:18:52] standing I I I I know all All Flesh and
[1:18:56] then he differentiated by
[1:18:58] relationship he said uh and upon your
[1:19:03] servants let let me let me pull that
[1:19:06] somebody give me the verse let me read
[1:19:09] it because I'm missing what the point I
[1:19:11] want to make I will pour out my spirit
[1:19:15] uh upon All Flesh it's in Joel but also
[1:19:18] in acts right give me just a minute I
[1:19:21] know you're
[1:19:23] standing but you'll be seated a
[1:19:29] while if you find it there it is all
[1:19:32] right great you're faster than me and it
[1:19:35] shall come to pass in the last days
[1:19:39] saith God I will pour out my spirit upon
[1:19:43] say it with me all
[1:19:46] flesh your sons and your daughters shall
[1:19:52] prophesy and your young men
[1:19:55] shall see visions and your old men shall
[1:20:00] dream dreams what's the next verse say
[1:20:03] and on my
[1:20:06] servants he said first of all on
[1:20:10] yours go back and let's look at that on
[1:20:14] your sons and your daughter they shall
[1:20:17] prophesy and your young men shall see
[1:20:20] visions and your old men shall dream
[1:20:24] dreams s and on my servants and on my
[1:20:29] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[1:20:32] days of my
[1:20:36] spirit and they
[1:20:38] shall prophesy there is a clear
[1:20:42] distinction between your sons and
[1:20:45] daughters and my servants and
[1:20:48] handmaidens your sons and daughters is a
[1:20:51] part of the church ages no doubt about
[1:20:54] it
[1:20:55] my servants and my handmaidens is about
[1:20:59] sons and bride it's a different
[1:21:02] dimension it's the elect of God and he
[1:21:06] said your sons and daughters are going
[1:21:08] to have the same Spirit poured out on
[1:21:10] them they're going to dream Dreams
[1:21:12] they're going to see Visions they're
[1:21:14] going to be mightily used but don't
[1:21:17] forget that I'm going to pour out my
[1:21:19] spirit on my servants and my handmade
[1:21:23] duns
[1:21:27] I will pour out in the last days of my
[1:21:29] spirit and they shall do what
[1:21:33] prophesy there's no indication here that
[1:21:38] that prophecy will cease in fact
[1:21:41] Revelation 10 tells us that they will do
[1:21:44] what they will
[1:21:46] prophesy
[1:21:47] again so there's a problem with some
[1:21:51] somebody's
[1:21:52] theology that these things are
[1:21:56] finished there's a great need yet in the
[1:21:59] Earth for Sons and Daughters to know who
[1:22:01] they are handmaiden servants to know who
[1:22:04] they are and to begin to declare that so
[1:22:06] look what God does he reaches down and
[1:22:08] uses a prime minister of the Israeli
[1:22:11] State who studies the Bible he he
[1:22:15] teaches a Bible study he meets with
[1:22:18] members of the kasset and has for many
[1:22:21] many years uh when his dad was alive and
[1:22:24] even after the death of his father to
[1:22:26] study the scripture but he doesn't
[1:22:28] perhaps know that Jesus of Nazareth is
[1:22:32] Messiah we don't know for sure but it
[1:22:34] seems that he may not completely know
[1:22:36] that but he knows that the lion of the
[1:22:39] tribe of Judah is roaring well there's
[1:22:42] not two
[1:22:44] lions there's only one and that lion is
[1:22:48] the one who stepped forth from the
[1:22:51] lamb and
[1:22:52] roared he's still roaring
[1:22:55] Proverbs chapter 4 I didn't give you
[1:22:57] this it's from uh uh from our study I
[1:23:01] want to want to there's so much I want
[1:23:03] to say but I already have caught the
[1:23:05] preacher now and I don't want to lose
[1:23:07] him but uh God bless you all Zion minko
[1:23:11] has a birthday on Tuesday God bless her
[1:23:14] and sister Adina uh hammermeister has a
[1:23:18] birthday sister alfreda's older sister

[1:23:29] her and we are thankful for her prayers

[1:23:34] she knows that we are praying for her as
[1:23:37] well that's brother Bernie for you that
[1:23:39] don't know that's brother Bernie's mom
[1:23:42] and she is also the mother of brother Ed
[1:23:45] hammermeister who's the pastor of the
[1:23:47] church in Edmonton so may God bless her
[1:23:51] abundantly we had a wonderful trip I'd
[1:23:53] like to tell tell you about it maybe I
[1:23:55] will uh on Tuesday but not now keep thy
[1:24:00] heart Proverbs
[1:24:02] 4:23 with all
[1:24:04] diligence for out of it heart are the
[1:24:10] issues of life may God add his Blessing
[1:24:14] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:24:17] seated let let's not
[1:24:20] forget that we have a couple of Series
[1:24:23] going on
[1:24:25] inside of each other ultimately the word
[1:24:28] of the Lord for this year has been Above
[1:24:32] All Else guard your
[1:24:35] heart this is where you have the most
[1:24:38] Authority is over your own heart over
[1:24:42] your own mind the Bible said let every
[1:24:45] man be fully persuaded and that means
[1:24:49] within himself you've got to know that
[1:24:52] you know that you know amen amen you've
[1:24:55] got to know that you know that you know
[1:24:58] you've got to know what you know that's
[1:25:00] right and you've got to know that you do
[1:25:03] know and you have alone the authority to
[1:25:07] search out your heart you can't just
[1:25:10] trust
[1:25:11] emotions because they are
[1:25:14] deceitful they operate uh under whatever
[1:25:18] influence you're under if you're under
[1:25:20] the influence of offense your emotions
[1:25:23] will be be
[1:25:25] offended if you operate under a a spirit
[1:25:28] of jealousy your emotions will tend
[1:25:32] toward uh you know rejection and feeling
[1:25:36] looked over and left out and all that
[1:25:39] good stuff so you can't trust your
[1:25:42] emotions but you have to pray that they
[1:25:45] come into alignment with what has
[1:25:48] happened in your regenerated inside of
[1:25:50] the inside are you with me that's the
[1:25:53] inner most being some call it the soul
[1:25:56] the scripture calls it the spirit
[1:25:59] doesn't matter what you call it as long
[1:26:01] as you understand how it functions when
[1:26:04] Jesus comes in he doesn't come to save
[1:26:07] your
[1:26:08] emotions he comes to to take your Fallen
[1:26:12] human Spirit it fell under Adam's
[1:26:16] authority to take your Fallen human
[1:26:19] Spirit to infuse it or baptize it with
[1:26:23] his own life
[1:26:24] with his own Holy Spirit and you take
[1:26:27] anything dead Fallen broken ruined and
[1:26:33] plunge it under the life of God the
[1:26:37] blood of Jesus as sister was singing
[1:26:40] what happens to death death has to go
[1:26:43] and that reproducible Resurrection
[1:26:46] breaks forth in your once Fallen spirit
[1:26:50] and now you rise up in a new spirit and
[1:26:54] the Bible said that life that you once
[1:26:56] lived by that unction that once moved
[1:26:59] you through life it's not moving you
[1:27:02] through life anymore you're now moving
[1:27:04] through life with another kind of Life a
[1:27:08] regenerated Spirit one that has been
[1:27:11] born a new one that has been born from
[1:27:15] Heaven are you with me and that's so
[1:27:18] powerful because nothing can bring your
[1:27:21] innermost part Soul or spirit whichever
[1:27:24] you prefer to call it nothing can bring
[1:27:27] that down it has been resurrected it
[1:27:31] should be the control tower the prophet
[1:27:35] tells us that the nature of the spirit
[1:27:38] is the soul and that's why people often
[1:27:43] put it in that other order but what you
[1:27:46] what you need to understand is uh the
[1:27:50] nature of something is how it moves how
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:54] behaves how it manifests and therefore
[1:27:59] you turn that thing around and you want
[1:28:01] to know who you really are you really
[1:28:04] are what's coming out of your soul now
[1:28:08] that's in this realm in the spirit realm
[1:28:11] that innermost being it is just like
[1:28:14] Jesus you are already seated together
[1:28:17] with Christ in Heavenly places but if
[1:28:20] you're not living out of that if it has
[1:28:23] not taken charge over your soul life
[1:28:27] mind will and emotions then you'll live
[1:28:30] out of the soul and if you live out of
[1:28:34] the Soul you're going to be fickle and
[1:28:37] that means you may be spiritual one
[1:28:39] moment and carnal
[1:28:41] another the Bible said that makes a
[1:28:43] double-minded man glance this look this
[1:28:46] way every now and again uh that makes a
[1:28:49] double-minded man and the Bible said a
[1:28:51] double-minded man is UN
[1:28:55] a can't trust him he talks one minute
[1:28:59] out of his soul he talks one minute out
[1:29:02] of his Spirit you don't ever know which
[1:29:04] man you got he's
[1:29:06] unstable he he's mentally
[1:29:09] imbalanced because he is living out of
[1:29:12] both parts of the inner being in Judaism
[1:29:16] there's only one part uh of the Inner
[1:29:19] Man and they teach that that is Soul and
[1:29:22] Spirit functioning together and that is
[1:29:25] how God wants it to be he wants our soul
[1:29:29] to be under the control of that
[1:29:32] regenerated Spirit which is the life of
[1:29:34] Jesus Christ and you know this you've
[1:29:37] heard it but we forget it sometime our
[1:29:40] responsibility is not in that innermost
[1:29:43] part the spirit our responsibility is in
[1:29:46] the soul life because what God has done
[1:29:50] in the spirit is done and what is
[1:29:53] happening
[1:29:54] now is redemption and salvation is
[1:29:57] taking place in the Middle Ground praise
[1:30:00] God praise God you're being saved you're
[1:30:04] being redeemed mind will and emotions
[1:30:09] and when you come to the to the totality
[1:30:11] or the entirety of that guess what
[1:30:13] you're you have full adoption and your
[1:30:16] name on the check you know what it says
[1:30:18] you know how it is you've got the
[1:30:21] authority of all of Heaven back in you
[1:30:24] up and so one of these days you're going
[1:30:26] to have total redemption in the third
[1:30:29] part of who you are that's the body of
[1:30:30] Flesh it's coming you're going to lay
[1:30:33] this body down and you're going to pick
[1:30:35] up another
[1:30:36] one you see the body that you live in
[1:30:40] now is not your original
[1:30:42] body this isn't the original
[1:30:45] one God already made you a body yes
[1:30:49] sir it's on the other side it's in the
[1:30:51] other realm waiting on you that's what
[1:30:55] he said this body is second body this is
[1:30:59] Fallen body one of these days you're
[1:31:02] going to lay this thing you're going to
[1:31:04] shed it like a
[1:31:07] shell like a snail out of his shell
[1:31:10] you're just going to shed it
[1:31:13] Hallelujah and you're going to step into
[1:31:16] that Spirit body that was created for
[1:31:20] you one day I'm going to take a step
[1:31:24] right into that body there are times in
[1:31:27] the goodness of God that we actually
[1:31:30] feel a pull from that
[1:31:32] body isn't that interesting to know it
[1:31:35] pulls on us and if you're sensitive to
[1:31:38] it you need to become sensitive to the
[1:31:41] fact that you have representation in
[1:31:43] both
[1:31:44] Realms you're represented in Physical
[1:31:46] Realm of time in a body like this a
[1:31:49] flesh you live in but you're also
[1:31:51] represented in eternity where there is
[1:31:53] no time with a spirit body isn't that
[1:31:57] interesting and that body over there has
[1:32:00] the ability to pull you to pull on you
[1:32:02] to tug at you praise God it has the
[1:32:05] ability to call out to
[1:32:07] you isn't that interesting brother Ram
[1:32:11] said have you heard from your theophany
[1:32:13] well I have I've heard from mine he's
[1:32:16] getting ready for me to come and occupy
[1:32:19] it is't that interesting it is so that
[1:32:24] is more real than what we are walking
[1:32:25] around in right now it's a reality not a
[1:32:29] fantasy not a fairy tale it's a reality
[1:32:32] well I'm just down I'm just down and I'm
[1:32:35] just I'm just I'm just heavy and I'm
[1:32:38] just down well you don't have to stay
[1:32:41] there such is common to man to get down
[1:32:46] but if you spend 24 hours in that realm
[1:32:49] you're living below your means as an
[1:32:51] overcoming Christian get right back up
[1:32:54] what if I wake up the next morning feel
[1:32:55] down fight your way out of the paper bag
[1:32:58] look this way get off your
[1:33:01] phone get off your phone and listen to
[1:33:04] me this morning you might get a hold of
[1:33:06] something that'll help you to win this
[1:33:09] race I want you to look again quickly at
[1:33:12] Matthew 24 verse
[1:33:15] 10-13 we've looked at that this is Jesus
[1:33:18] talking so we're we're uh in a series
[1:33:22] Above All Else guard your heart
[1:33:24] we are in a sub series of Above All Else
[1:33:29] guard your heart that I would call a
[1:33:31] comprehensive teaching on the spirit of
[1:33:34] offense and this morning we're going to
[1:33:37] spend a little bit of time with Joseph
[1:33:40] and his brothers we spent some time with
[1:33:43] a with Cain and Abel and we didn't
[1:33:46] finish with them but we we have moved on
[1:33:49] my fear is that you'll lose all interest
[1:33:51] in this if we stay too long but but uh
[1:33:55] let me just say there there's a lot more
[1:33:57] that we could have uh talked about
[1:34:00] biblically with Cain and Abel but we'll
[1:34:03] just Ease on because we want to get to
[1:34:07] something pretty Nitty
[1:34:09] Gritty as soon as possible Jesus says in
[1:34:13] Matthew
[1:34:14] 24:10 and then shall many be
[1:34:20] offended and shall betray one another
[1:34:24] and shall hate one another so offense
[1:34:28] and betrayal is a part of the end
[1:34:31] time Jesus said it it it's going to
[1:34:35] happen you're going to get offended
[1:34:38] offense is going to come trouble's going
[1:34:41] to come hard times are going to come but
[1:34:45] don't you be the one who does it to
[1:34:46] somebody else keep your mind clear your
[1:34:50] heart clean your hands sanctified
[1:34:54] purified amen many false prophets shall
[1:34:57] rise and shall deceive many and because
[1:35:02] iniquity shall abound the
[1:35:05] love of many shall what wax cold the
[1:35:10] stronghold of cold love there wouldn't
[1:35:13] be a problem with cold love if there
[1:35:16] wasn't so much iniquity and compromise
[1:35:18] around that's what paralyzes and freezes
[1:35:22] out our love verse 13 but he but he or
[1:35:27] she that
[1:35:30] shall
[1:35:32] endure unto the end the same shall be
[1:35:37] delivered shall be saved shall be
[1:35:40] redeemed shall be caught
[1:35:44] away uh Luke 17 And1 in the Amplified
[1:35:49] said and Jesus said to the disciples
[1:35:52] Temptations SN snares traps set to
[1:35:56] entice to sin are sure to come but woe
[1:36:03] to him by or through whom they
[1:36:07] come that word offended that is in both
[1:36:11] Matthew and in the King James version of
[1:36:14] Luke
[1:36:15] 171 uh it is that word
[1:36:20] scandalo uh in Greek and it means to put
[1:36:23] put a snare in the way caused to stumble
[1:36:27] or be led to sin it means to set a
[1:36:31] trap and to catch somebody in offense
[1:36:36] it's the devil's job it's his it's his
[1:36:39] desire to paralyze you with hurt
[1:36:45] feelings he wants to do that remember he
[1:36:49] can't do anything about your redeemed
[1:36:54] regenerated Spirit he can't unsave you
[1:36:58] unredeem you unelect you un predestinate
[1:37:02] you unjustify you he can't do anything
[1:37:06] about what's already done but what he
[1:37:08] will do is he will mess around in the
[1:37:12] middle ground trying to get you offended
[1:37:15] about everything and if you don't
[1:37:17] believe it's the spirit of the age you
[1:37:19] you just got to read the paper this is
[1:37:22] cancell culture we're living in right
[1:37:25] now and and and everybody's got to be
[1:37:27] careful what they say and it don't do
[1:37:30] anybody good if they've got any
[1:37:31] influence out there to say anything
[1:37:34] because by Monday morning they'll be
[1:37:35] apologizing for it they don't have a
[1:37:38] choice because they'll be unfriended
[1:37:41] unfollowed unsupported nobody will buy
[1:37:44] their
[1:37:46] music and so they've got to say well I
[1:37:48] you know
[1:37:50] I'm so don't get excited when you hear
[1:37:53] somebody saying
[1:37:55] something because if they desire to
[1:37:58] remain popular if that's their ambition
[1:38:01] if they've got an Elvis Presley Spirit
[1:38:03] then they're going to just have to come
[1:38:05] right back and apologize so uh because
[1:38:07] somebody is going to be
[1:38:11] offended and uh they're offended about
[1:38:14] this offended about that some people are
[1:38:16] offended that the church will not
[1:38:18] endorse their
[1:38:21] lifestyle we can love you as an
[1:38:24] individual we can pray for you as an
[1:38:27] individual but we can't endorse
[1:38:30] sin you don't want us to say it's all
[1:38:32] right when the word says it's not all
[1:38:34] right do you so people get so offended
[1:38:39] by those things because again we want an
[1:38:42] automatic relationship we don't want to
[1:38:45] have to pay anything for it don't want
[1:38:46] to have to give anything up we're living
[1:38:49] in an hour where everybody wants to do
[1:38:51] what's right in their own eyes they
[1:38:53] don't want
[1:38:53] have to explain it to anybody don't want
[1:38:56] to answer to anybody are you with me
[1:39:00] that's where we are but you know we got
[1:39:03] to get away from that as
[1:39:05] Believers just let the world roll on I
[1:39:08] sung from the time I was a child the old
[1:39:11] song that said I'll stand for Jesus and
[1:39:14] let the world go by we better do that we
[1:39:18] better stand for Jesus and let the world
[1:39:21] go by
[1:39:23] I don't care who wins the Super
[1:39:26] Bowl don't matter tomorrow it won't
[1:39:30] matter by midnight it'll be over Pro I
[1:39:33] don't know about the times but it'll be
[1:39:35] over and and it'll be what it is and
[1:39:38] somebody will be excited and somebody
[1:39:41] will be
[1:39:44] dejected somebody will call in work
[1:39:47] tomorrow cuz their team
[1:39:50] lost oh I'll stand for Jesus let the
[1:39:54] crazy foolish world just go by who cares
[1:40:00] what they
[1:40:01] do somebody said you don't want to know
[1:40:03] the score sure I I'll I'll listen to the
[1:40:07] score the only one only reason why I
[1:40:10] would even care is I'm a little I'm a
[1:40:13] little intrigued by the the names of the
[1:40:19] teams you really can't lose
[1:40:23] because Chief has a very prophetic
[1:40:26] significance through the through through
[1:40:28] the word and so does
[1:40:30] Eagles other than that it don't
[1:40:37] matter all I care about his standing for
[1:40:41] Jesus let the world Roll by I didn't
[1:40:45] vote for who Taylor Swift recommended
[1:40:48] could care less don't even know what she
[1:40:50] looks like if you showed me a picture
[1:40:53] I'm might call her Miley Cyrus or
[1:40:55] something I might not even know what she
[1:40:56] looks like don't really care I'm going
[1:40:59] to stand for Jesus and let the world go
[1:41:05] by we have
[1:41:07] to cuz many are going to fall under
[1:41:11] scandalo they're going to take the
[1:41:14] bait oh and wear the
[1:41:19] mask that's the hour we're living in so
[1:41:23] there's many examples in scripture of
[1:41:27] What offense can do and we know that
[1:41:30] offense from the very beginning can be
[1:41:32] so strong that it drives somebody to
[1:41:37] hatred bitterness first
[1:41:41] resentment comparison leads to
[1:41:43] resentment resentment leads to
[1:41:46] bitterness bitterness leads to malice
[1:41:50] which is a high degree of hatred and the
[1:41:53] next thing you know Murder is is the
[1:41:57] next step it might be with a gun it
[1:42:00] might be with hateful
[1:42:02] words we're going to be responsible
[1:42:05] regardless Let the church say Amen am so
[1:42:08] we're going to have to deal with some
[1:42:10] things the Bible teaches that Believers
[1:42:12] will have various kinds of problems here
[1:42:15] on Earth if anybody told you that the
[1:42:17] Christian Life is a bed of ease they
[1:42:20] lied
[1:42:23] but if anybody told you it's harder to
[1:42:25] be a Christian than a sinner they
[1:42:28] lied the Bible said the way of the
[1:42:30] transgressor is hard there are
[1:42:34] difficulties in the Christian life but
[1:42:36] we've got somebody on
[1:42:39] board John Jesus said in John 16:33 red
[1:42:43] letter these things I have spoken unto
[1:42:46] you that in Me In Me In Me you might
[1:42:51] have peace peace where is our peace

[1:44:03] to find your peace is get in me stay in
[1:44:06] me he said it's not enough to connect
[1:44:10] with him because our feet gets slippery
[1:44:14] on its
[1:44:15] foundation and that which we have heard
[1:44:19] has a tendency to go Drifting by us as
[1:44:23] we preached last Sunday we let truth go
[1:44:28] by us without identifying with it so
[1:44:32] it's out there in the atmosphere but
[1:44:35] it's not in here where it needs to be
[1:44:38] don't you dare let it slip don't you
[1:44:40] dare let it uh float by you in the
[1:44:43] Stream of Life grab a hold of it it's
[1:44:47] your life preserver somebody ought to
[1:44:49] say amen truth truth is is not Doctrine
[1:44:54] truth is a person the person is made up
[1:44:57] of
[1:44:58] Doctrine he's made up of everything good
[1:45:02] everything perfect everything holy but
[1:45:05] he's a person he's not a church he's not
[1:45:09] a
[1:45:10] prophet truth is not I believe serpent
[1:45:15] seed that is a truth I'm not talking
[1:45:18] about a truth I'm talking about clinging
[1:45:22] to
[1:45:23] the truth he's a person omniscient
[1:45:27] omnipresent omnipotent he's a person
[1:45:30] Jesus said I am I am the resurrection I
[1:45:33] am the life I am the
[1:45:36] bread I am the water he's saying I'm
[1:45:40] everything you need and more stay in me
[1:45:44] abide in me it's not
[1:45:46] automatic you got to swim you're not a
[1:45:51] jellyfish you're a

[1:45:56] shoulder amen we have to as Believers

[1:46:06] something happens push p u h pray until
[1:46:10] something happens push don't float Don't
[1:46:15] Drift
[1:46:18] push these things are going to come he
[1:46:21] said but in me you're going to have
[1:46:23] peace in the world you're going to have
[1:46:25] tribulation but be of good cheer I've
[1:46:27] overcome the world some of these trials
[1:46:29] will be regular problems that are common
[1:46:31] to all of human the whole Human family
[1:46:35] has problems tribulations trials Sorrows
[1:46:37] heraches losses griefs but some of them
[1:46:41] are specific to the
[1:46:44] believer Matthew 5:45 that ye may be the
[1:46:48] children red letter that you may be the
[1:46:51] children of your Father which is in
[1:46:54] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[1:46:59] the
[1:47:00] evil and on The
[1:47:03] Good the sun got up this morning come up
[1:47:07] over the horizon and God's people needed
[1:47:11] it benefited from it and so did the evil
[1:47:15] Wicked hearted man the sun is God's gift
[1:47:18] to all of us it rises and sets on the
[1:47:21] good on the evil on the righteous and
[1:47:23] the unrighteous and he sendeth
[1:47:26] rain on the just we could say on the
[1:47:30] Justified and the unjust the unjustified
[1:47:34] the redeemed and the unredeemed the
[1:47:37] believer and the non-believer sun warms
[1:47:39] us up Rain sends us what we need for
[1:47:44] future Harvest uh it's not just the the
[1:47:47] believer's crop that benefits from the
[1:47:51] rain your a a his neighbor his Tomatoes
[1:47:54] drink it in
[1:47:56] too it's the plan of God common to man
[1:48:01] but some things are not just common to
[1:48:03] all men and to the Human family at large
[1:48:06] some things are targeted to the believer
[1:48:09] and that's why we're told in First Peter
[1:48:11] 5:8 be
[1:48:14] sober don't be drunk with your
[1:48:17] emotions don't be drunk with your
[1:48:20] situation don't be drunk with your C
[1:48:23] circumstance if your family is haywire
[1:48:25] don't you be
[1:48:27] Haywire if your job is chaotic don't you
[1:48:29] be
[1:48:31] chaotic if your friends are wishy-washy
[1:48:34] don't you be wishy-washy you be sober
[1:48:37] don't be drunk don't be giddy don't be
[1:48:42] sloppy that's right you know how drunk
[1:48:44] people are be sober be serious there's a
[1:48:48] time to laugh there's a time not to
[1:48:51] laugh there's a time to be to have fun
[1:48:54] to enjoy life to eat and enjoy the fruit
[1:48:58] of our labor as a gift of God there's a
[1:49:01] time to refrain from eating there's a
[1:49:04] time to refrain from partying from
[1:49:07] celebrating there's a time to be serious
[1:49:12] amen there's a time to eat
[1:49:15] cake and there's a time not to eat
[1:49:19] cake you've got to know the difference
[1:49:22] be so sober and don't be LAX about it be
[1:49:25] what Vigilant we broke that down for you
[1:49:28] many times no need to do it again
[1:49:30] because your
[1:49:34] adversary at all
[1:49:37] sist that old
[1:49:40] attorney because that adversary word
[1:49:42] there is a word that's used in legal
[1:49:46] terminology to represent the the
[1:49:49] accuser your accuser your ad adversary
[1:49:53] the devil he is both sober and
[1:49:56] Vigilant and he's not a
[1:49:59] Believer he is as
[1:50:01] a roaring line which means he's got more
[1:50:05] noise than
[1:50:07] power but he don't stand
[1:50:10] still he's
[1:50:13] creative he's not
[1:50:16] stationary he's moving all about in your
[1:50:20] business I'm preaching he's in your
[1:50:23] stuff he heard what you
[1:50:26] said he heard what you said and he's all
[1:50:29] in your stuff and he's got plenty to say
[1:50:32] about it he's a roaring line lot of
[1:50:34] noise lot of hot air always on the Move
[1:50:38] seeking
[1:50:40] whom remember that doesn't mean who he
[1:50:42] can take a bite out of who he can trip
[1:50:44] up who he can hinder it means who he can
[1:50:46] eat up consume
[1:50:53] if we really took this at face value
[1:50:56] which we won't always do because some
[1:50:59] people couldn't handle the reality of
[1:51:01] what the verse says it would be too too
[1:51:04] UNC it would be too too common it would
[1:51:07] be too uh off color or whatever you like
[1:51:11] to call
[1:51:12] it but if we took this verse in its
[1:51:16] original language and we took it to the
[1:51:19] fullest of the meaning of the root
[1:51:23] do you know what we'd be
[1:51:25] saying we'd be saying the enemy wants to
[1:51:28] eat you digest
[1:51:32] you oh you all are trying to help
[1:51:37] me when I think of expel I'm thinking
[1:51:40] out of the
[1:51:41] mouth that's not what is being
[1:51:46] said digest you and
[1:51:53] oh you people are so clean and
[1:51:56] holy
[1:52:00] poop he wants to turn you into
[1:52:03] something that's vile he wants your
[1:52:07] testimony to
[1:52:09] stink uhoh uhoh uhoh am I going to get
[1:52:13] Flack he wants to make your testimony
[1:52:16] stink he wants to make your reputation
[1:52:20] in Christ stink
[1:52:23] he wants to eat you
[1:52:25] up and not spit you out but to so devour
[1:52:29] you there's nothing left if there's any
[1:52:32] good in you he'd like to get a hold of
[1:52:34] that and leave you just
[1:52:38] waste like the Apostle said
[1:52:42] dung that's what he desires to do but
[1:52:45] I've got news for him I'm not going to
[1:52:48] be still long enough for him to eat me
[1:52:52] I'm going to keep moving
[1:52:54] too and I'm going to learn eventually
[1:52:57] that I don't have to run from him
[1:53:00] because it's just a roar I'm running
[1:53:02] from what I have to really do is show
[1:53:05] him my
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:08] badge I may look like Barney F to you
[1:53:12] devil but this badge says I have the
[1:53:16] authority that I need to stop you in
[1:53:19] your tracks I'm a Believer I'm a blood
[1:53:23] bought Son of God I'm Sanctified by the
[1:53:27] washing of the water of the word I've
[1:53:29] been filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:53:33] and I don't have to run from
[1:53:36] you and one of these days I'm going to
[1:53:39] dance on your
[1:53:42] lid a thousand years you're going to
[1:53:44] toss and
[1:53:45] Tumble and I'm going to take my turn on
[1:53:48] the lid of the
[1:53:50] Abyss on the lid of of the bottomless
[1:53:53] pit it's true devil you're going to be
[1:53:56] loose for a short time at the end of
[1:53:58] that thousand years and given a second
[1:54:01] swat at the Nations but what you don't
[1:54:04] know is that after a thousand years of
[1:54:07] King
[1:54:10] Jesus somebody'd be a
[1:54:12] fool to choose your rotten
[1:54:15] ways why do you think that the nations
[1:54:18] of the world are exposed to King Jesus
[1:54:21] for a thousand years here would you go
[1:54:23] back to being a republican after the
[1:54:27] Millennium W that's good
[1:54:30] preaching would you go back to being you
[1:54:33] know some Shriner some you know identify
[1:54:36] yourself with some group or organization
[1:54:40] after living under the authority and
[1:54:42] reign of King Jesus for a thousand years
[1:54:45] where the lion lays down next to the
[1:54:47] lamb and the little baby plays on the
[1:54:48] hole of the ass and a little child leads
[1:54:51] the Beast of the
[1:54:53] wild because of King Jesus on the
[1:54:57] throne and then you're going to go let
[1:54:59] that little devil that's been trapped up
[1:55:02] for a thousand years running around like
[1:55:04] a little uh pointed eared Mouse uh
[1:55:08] coming out of that pit you're you're
[1:55:10] going to follow him you you're going to
[1:55:12] deceive him oh you don't understand what
[1:55:15] a thousand years of peace and the reign
[1:55:17] of King Jesus is going to do to this
[1:55:19] whole
[1:55:20] earth so yeah you can you can have your
[1:55:23] little spell but I need to tell you
[1:55:25] right now it's not going to do much good
[1:55:28] because by then this bride will have all
[1:55:31] the authority she needs she'll know who
[1:55:34] she is some of some of us will already
[1:55:37] be coming back riding on horses with
[1:55:39] King Jesus and the rest of us will be
[1:55:41] raised up
[1:55:47] Immortal be sober be vigilant because
[1:55:50] your adversary of the Devils is a
[1:55:51] roaring life walketh about seeking whom
[1:55:53] he may devour you see the
[1:55:56] problem is there are some problems let
[1:55:59] me let me restate this there are some
[1:56:01] problems that the whole world
[1:56:02] experiences and some blessings and
[1:56:04] benefits there are certain difficulties
[1:56:08] and situations and trials that only
[1:56:10] Believers
[1:56:12] face and here is the reality of the
[1:56:15] believer you don't mind as much when you
[1:56:19] recognize hell is persecuting you
[1:56:23] you don't mind as much when you realize
[1:56:25] your enemies are against you are you
[1:56:28] with me you don't mind this much when
[1:56:31] the world doesn't want anything to do
[1:56:33] with
[1:56:33] you because what
[1:56:37] Fellowship ha light with Darkness but
[1:56:40] where the believer is often
[1:56:44] trapped it's when the hurt when the
[1:56:48] trial comes
[1:56:50] from a breath a
[1:56:53] brother when it comes from the
[1:56:56] Brethren betrayal is even more difficult
[1:56:58] when it comes from from
[1:57:02] Friends enemies you can expect they hate
[1:57:05] you they want to see you
[1:57:07] destroyed but when
[1:57:09] friends want to sabotage your life when
[1:57:13] other Christians want to stop
[1:57:16] you oh let's preach a while when other
[1:57:20] believers uh uh have you for
[1:57:23] dinner not not
[1:57:28] literally it's hard David said in Psalm
[1:57:32] 55 let's go there 12 through 14 he said
[1:57:36] for it was not an enemy that reproached
[1:57:39] me then I could have borne it neither
[1:57:43] was it he that hated me that did magnify
[1:57:46] himself against me then I would have hid
[1:57:48] myself from him but it was thou a man
[1:57:53] mine
[1:57:55] equal my guide and my
[1:58:01] acquaintance my
[1:58:05] father-in-law my king he could have
[1:58:09] said but it was thou a man mine equal my
[1:58:13] guide and mine acquaintance we took
[1:58:17] sweet counsel
[1:58:20] together shared our our hearts with one
[1:58:24] another bore our
[1:58:27] sorrows to one
[1:58:29] another exposed
[1:58:32] ourselves
[1:58:34] transparently to one another and we
[1:58:37] walked unto the house of God together in
[1:58:41] company had it been my
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:47] enemy I would have bounced back by now
[1:58:54] had it been a
[1:58:57] Democrat I'd be laughing by
[1:59:00] now but it was you it was you it was my
[1:59:04] friend it was my
[1:59:06] brother it was you that uh we shared
[1:59:10] sweet Fellowship coffee together and
[1:59:14] bore
[1:59:16] our
[1:59:18] interests our desires our dreams our
[1:59:20] Visions our our our
[1:59:22] goals and our
[1:59:26] fears our weaknesses our vulnerabilities
[1:59:29] and because it was
[1:59:31] you I'm having a lot harder time
[1:59:35] bouncing back this is what the psalmist
[1:59:37] David was saying and if there are any
[1:59:39] believers here that have ever found
[1:59:42] woundedness at the hand of another
[1:59:44] believer you know that it is
[1:59:47] particularly vile and sharp and painful
[1:59:51] and and it is a pain that doesn't just e
[1:59:54] away as quickly as you would like for it
[1:59:57] to it's something that you nurse and
[2:00:00] something that you somehow hold on to
[2:00:02] and if you're not aware that it's
[2:00:05] crippling your feet if you're not aware
[2:00:08] that it's handicapping you you may stay
[2:00:12] in that
[2:00:13] offense
[2:00:15] indefinitely but once you get a good
[2:00:18] look in the mirror once you see that
[2:00:20] you're not walking like you once walked
[2:00:23] you're not talking like you once talked
[2:00:26] you're not overcoming like you once
[2:00:28] overcame you then need to do something
[2:00:31] about that
[2:00:33] woundedness you need to do something
[2:00:37] about that
[2:00:40] offense some people believe that they've
[2:00:43] had a particularly hard week so they
[2:00:47] deserve three pieces of cake instead of
[2:00:51] one
[2:00:52] a dozen Crispy
[2:00:55] Cream instead of
[2:00:58] one I use food because I understand
[2:01:02] it I understand how it can become uh our
[2:01:08] vice our
[2:01:10] crutch but it's any it's any VI it's any
[2:01:13] sin it's anything it's any
[2:01:15] Indulgence we keep telling
[2:01:18] ourselves I deserve a break from church
[2:01:21] because I've been
[2:01:22] uh I've been to church every Tuesday
[2:01:24] night for a year so if I lay out a few
[2:01:26] weeks shouldn't make any difference to
[2:01:27] anybody it doesn't matter what situation
[2:01:30] you're in we somehow convince ourselves
[2:01:33] that it's okay to be that way it's okay
[2:01:35] to stay that way it's okay to feel that
[2:01:38] way it's called
[2:01:40] self-justification it's a characteristic
[2:01:42] of the spirit of
[2:01:46] offense if you're around somebody always
[2:01:49] justifying themselves always excusing
[2:01:51] them
[2:01:52] themselves always shifting
[2:01:54] blame you need to know and we're going
[2:01:57] to break that down very comprehensively
[2:02:00] in a week or so a week or
[2:02:03] so I've spent many
[2:02:06] hours not only finding the
[2:02:11] characteristics of the spirit of
[2:02:14] offense but
[2:02:16] identifying the spirits that run with it
[2:02:21] because something you need to understand
[2:02:24] is that there are families so to speak
[2:02:28] this is just a analogy to help you there
[2:02:31] are often families of spirits that run
[2:02:36] together joining hand in hand
[2:02:40] strengthening one another for instance
[2:02:43] you may be under the influence of a of a
[2:02:46] of an offended Spirit a spirit of
[2:02:48] offense you might find yourself being
[2:02:51] angry that's that's because anger is one
[2:02:53] of the spirits that runs with
[2:02:56] offense you might find bitterness
[2:02:58] because bitterness is a spirit that
[2:03:01] often runs in
[2:03:02] tandem with a
[2:03:07] fence we will cover that so extensively
[2:03:11] until you'll pray to God we can move on
[2:03:13] to something
[2:03:14] else I'm sure of it betrayal is tough
[2:03:19] when it comes from brothers friends
[2:03:22] family asked
[2:03:23] Joseph Joseph was soow by his
[2:03:27] Brethren betrayed by his own
[2:03:30] family
[2:03:32] blood blood family no halves no
[2:03:37] steps blood
[2:03:40] family serious if you look at these
[2:03:43] Patriarchs I shouldn't have said halves
[2:03:44] I should have said uh steps all blood
[2:03:49] related
[2:03:52] and yet Joseph is a nearly perfect type
[2:03:59] of the Lord Jesus
[2:04:01] Christ beautiful have you ever looked at
[2:04:04] the characteristics similarities
[2:04:07] commonalities between Jesus and Joseph
[2:04:10] well I want to help you with them
[2:04:12] quickly this morning we don't have a lot
[2:04:13] of time to spend here but I want to give
[2:04:16] you a few of them so you'll understand
[2:04:18] just how important this betrayal was
[2:04:22] in the life of Joseph Joseph was beloved
[2:04:26] by his father Jacob just as Jesus was
[2:04:30] beloved and declared of the father to be
[2:04:34] his beloved Son both of them beloved
[2:04:39] special sons look at it with me beloved
[2:04:43] Sons Joseph Genesis 373 now Israel loved
[2:04:47] Joseph more than all his children he had
[2:04:50] a favorite
[2:04:52] because he was the son of his old
[2:04:58] age he was
[2:05:01] proud you've got to understand the the
[2:05:04] the whole patriarchal system of
[2:05:07] that Eastern
[2:05:10] culture he was proud that at his old age
[2:05:13] he could still father a son so Joseph
[2:05:17] the late baby became one of the
[2:05:19] favorites he wasn't the last
[2:05:23] but he was one of the most favorites
[2:05:26] because he was the son of his old age
[2:05:28] and he made him a
[2:05:30] coat of many colors just asked Dolly
[2:05:33] pardon she sung about
[2:05:35] it look at Jesus Matthew 3:17 and lo a
[2:05:40] voice from Heaven saying this is my
[2:05:43] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so
[2:05:47] both Joseph and Jesus were identified in
[2:05:49] scriptures as being beloved sons of
[2:05:52] their fathers number two both were sent
[2:05:56] by their fathers on missions Joseph to
[2:05:59] check on his brothers Jesus to seek and
[2:06:02] to save lost Humanity look at Genesis
[2:06:06] 3713 and Israel said unto Joseph do not
[2:06:09] thy Brethren feed the flock in sheam
[2:06:12] come and I will send thee unto them
[2:06:16] Jesus in John 3:17 for God sent not his
[2:06:20] son into the world to condemn the world
[2:06:22] but that the world through him might be
[2:06:24] saved both beloved Sons Joseph and Jesus
[2:06:28] both beloved Sons sent commissioned with
[2:06:32] a purpose by their fathers do you see
[2:06:35] that both were rejected number three by
[2:06:38] their own people Joseph by his brothers
[2:06:41] who sold him into slavery Jesus by the
[2:06:44] Jewish leaders his own people who handed
[2:06:47] him over to be crucified so they both
[2:06:50] experienced both Joseph and Jesus
[2:06:53] rejection by their Brethren Joseph in
[2:06:56] Genesis 37:18 and when they saw him AAR
[2:06:59] off even before he came near unto them
[2:07:02] they conspired against him to slay him
[2:07:05] not his
[2:07:09] enemies his brothers Blood Brothers
[2:07:12] somebody say Blood Brothers Blood
[2:07:14] Brothers Blood Brothers same father
[2:07:16] Blood Brothers and Jesus in John 1:1 he
[2:07:21] came unto his
[2:07:23] own just like
[2:07:25] Joseph and his
[2:07:27] own received him not number four they
[2:07:32] were both sold for
[2:07:34] silver Joseph in Genesis
[2:07:37] 3728 then there uh there passed by
[2:07:51] lifted him out of the pit sold him to
[2:07:53] the midianite merchantmen lifted him out
[2:07:55] of the pit and sold Joseph to the
[2:07:58] Israelites for 20 pieces of silver Jesus
[2:08:03] sold by his own Matthew 26:15 and said
[2:08:08] unto them what will you give me and I
[2:08:10] will deliver him unto you and they
[2:08:12] covenanted with him for 30 pieces of
[2:08:16] silver somebody said that's not a real
[2:08:18] type it is a real type it was it was
[2:08:20] silver they both were sold we don't have
[2:08:23] that many biblical instance instances of
[2:08:26] someone being sold particularly by
[2:08:29] silver you could look at that and
[2:08:31] understand why maybe another time but
[2:08:35] not not now but somebody said well Jesus
[2:08:39] got got a little more for Jesus than it
[2:08:42] did for Joseph Ju Just think about the
[2:08:45] value only only 10 pieces the savior of
[2:08:47] the world has
[2:08:49] come and and uh although the the value
[2:08:51] of the silver had likely gone up between
[2:08:54] the two men's lives only 30 pieces of
[2:08:57] silver sold our Lord to his
[2:09:00] death could God have stopped
[2:09:03] it why didn't
[2:09:06] he you really know that do you
[2:09:09] understand that by Revelation you stood
[2:09:12] between him and and his father stopping
[2:09:15] the whole thing the old song he could
[2:09:18] have called 10,000
[2:09:20] angels to loose the nails set him free
[2:09:23] he could have set the whole world on
[2:09:25] fire but he died alone the song writer
[2:09:29] said for you and me number five Joseph's
[2:09:32] path to Glory came through suffering and
[2:09:35] humiliation he was falsely accused
[2:09:37] imprisoned But ultimately Rose to become
[2:09:40] second only to Pharaoh in Egypt
[2:09:43] similarly Jesus endured false
[2:09:45] accusations death on the cross but was
[2:09:48] then resurrected and exalted to the
[2:09:50] right hand of power and authority Joseph
[2:09:53] in Genesis 39:20 and Joseph's Master
[2:09:56] took him put him into prison a place
[2:09:58] where the king's prisoners were bound
[2:10:00] and he was there in the prison and Jesus
[2:10:04] in Isaiah it talks about 538 for he was
[2:10:07] cut off out of the land of the living
[2:10:09] for the transgression of my people was
[2:10:12] he
[2:10:14] stricken
[2:10:16] powerful and as we mentioned the
[2:10:18] exaltation after the suffering Joseph in
[2:10:21] Genesis 41:41 and Pharaoh said unto
[2:10:24] Joseph see I have set thee over all the
[2:10:26] land of Egypt Jesus in Philippians 2:9
[2:10:30] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[2:10:32] him and given him a name which is above
[2:10:34] every name do we really have to go
[2:10:36] through all this we really
[2:10:38] do we really do because this is what
[2:10:42] study in the Bible looks like and it's
[2:10:45] important to do it I don't think we
[2:10:47] would have faed near the distraction
[2:10:49] this morning that we faced in trying to
[2:10:52] break through into worship if more of us
[2:10:55] would have been engaging
[2:10:57] him Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[2:10:59] Friday
[2:11:02] Saturday we may not realize this in fact
[2:11:04] you may get offended oh how could
[2:11:08] anybody get offended during a
[2:11:12] series on a fence you might even get
[2:11:16] offended when I tell
[2:11:17] you but it matters
[2:11:21] when you walk out of here on a Sunday
[2:11:23] afternoon and you don't ever mention him
[2:11:27] again on a week when we don't have a
[2:11:29] Tuesday night service you don't ever
[2:11:31] engage his word again you don't ever
[2:11:33] open your Bible or open your app phone
[2:11:36] app with a Bible and read a verse or two
[2:11:39] make a devotion read a devotion pray a
[2:11:42] devotion ask yourself some questions
[2:11:45] about your own
[2:11:46] life take a moment to worship turn on a
[2:11:50] worship song lift your hands right at
[2:11:52] the
[2:11:56] sink right in the backyard yes sir oh
[2:12:00] Jesus you're
[2:12:02] worthy I don't want to be offensive but
[2:12:05] that's what believers do if you're not
[2:12:07] taking that opportunity you're not
[2:12:09] living like a Believer I want to tell
[2:12:12] you something if you're not taking that
[2:12:14] opportunity you're not living like a
[2:12:18] Believer no wonder we come together so
[2:12:24] distracted fussing and fuming all the
[2:12:26] way to church and then expect the song
[2:12:29] leader to pull us into the presence of
[2:12:32] God no throw your shoulder into it
[2:12:36] push how many of you found it worth it
[2:12:39] when you do when you adjust your own
[2:12:42] attitude listen when you adjust your own
[2:12:45] attitude you make my job easier I don't
[2:12:47] have to adjust it for
[2:12:49] you you come in here just adjust your
[2:12:51] attitude and say look I don't have time
[2:12:54] to be thinking about all my troubles and
[2:12:56] trials worries and betrayals I've come
[2:12:59] to lift up the King of Kings and the
[2:13:03] Lord of lords what about a
[2:13:08] Monday what about a Tuesday what about a
[2:13:11] Tuesday when there's no church listen
[2:13:12] folks if we will engage him in some way
[2:13:16] by faith every day brother brandom says
[2:13:19] a True Believer reads his Bible every
[2:13:22] day and
[2:13:26] praise this give me give me give me
[2:13:29] count I don't really think
[2:13:31] so because God is not a
[2:13:35] Buddha he's not a lucky
[2:13:40] charm he doesn't want to just be asked
[2:13:43] for something he wants to be adored he
[2:13:47] wants to be reverenced he wants to be
[2:13:50] worshiped
[2:13:52] he wants to be
[2:13:54] loved he wants you to turn off Netflix
[2:13:58] and spend a moment or two with
[2:14:02] him he wants you to get off
[2:14:06] YouTube and spend some time with
[2:14:10] him how long has it been since you've
[2:14:13] heard a message by Brother brandom
[2:14:16] somebody said they're too long you ought
[2:14:18] to be used to that by now
[2:14:22] listen 20 minutes at a
[2:14:25] time you got a
[2:14:28] smartphone don't be a dummy with your
[2:14:30] smartphone use it
[2:14:33] smartly put it on the counter got to
[2:14:36] brush your teeth got to comb your hair
[2:14:39] please comb your hair Ben please comb
[2:14:42] your hair Jonathan please comb your hair
[2:14:46] everybody's got to comb their hair when
[2:14:48] they get ready to go out you you're not
[2:14:51] some what what mama would have called a
[2:14:53] woolly booger that's probably not a nice
[2:14:55] term but we just said it anyway uh
[2:14:58] you're representing the king of the king
[2:15:00] of kings and the Lord of
[2:15:03] lords put a little deodorant on
[2:15:10] and wash your face get the cracklings
[2:15:12] out of your
[2:15:14] eyes represent Jesus to a world that's
[2:15:19] lost come on
[2:15:22] make up your mind to make up your mind
[2:15:24] to make up your mind to serve him with
[2:15:27] everything that you've got don't miss
[2:15:29] your opportunity he's as close as the
[2:15:32] mention of his name
[2:15:36] amen so they both suffered some stuff
[2:15:41] but they had exaltation they were lifted
[2:15:43] up Joseph in Genesis 4141 uh we covered
[2:15:46] that and we covered Philippians 2
[2:15:49] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[2:15:51] him and given him a name which is above
[2:15:53] every name let you and I be actively
[2:15:55] involved in Philippians 2:9 every day
[2:15:57] lifting him up highly exalting him in
[2:16:01] Praise when people come and they lay the
[2:16:04] trap don't take the bait give him praise
[2:16:10] instead somebody come to you and give
[2:16:12] you the dirt the dump on somebody else
[2:16:16] you just say well here's the reality of
[2:16:19] it they're probably just just like
[2:16:23] me not what I want to be not what I
[2:16:25] ought to be but not what I used to be
[2:16:28] let's pray for him and give him a little
[2:16:30] Grace what if you did that what if you
[2:16:33] didn't take the cheese what if you
[2:16:35] refused the bait what if you just kept
[2:16:39] your mouth shut would it be so hard
[2:16:43] wouldn't it be worth it to hold the
[2:16:47] victory for more than 24 hours at a time
[2:16:51] wouldn't it be worth it to be less
[2:16:53] distracted in life because every time we
[2:16:56] entertain the bait of offense or we get
[2:17:00] involved in somebody else's
[2:17:03] beeswax every time we do that that was
[2:17:06] for
[2:17:07] Billy somebody tell him what I said I
[2:17:10] included him every time we get involved
[2:17:12] in somebody else's beeswax we are
[2:17:15] missing our
[2:17:18] opportunity to shine
[2:17:22] number seven both did you hear me I
[2:17:26] plugged you both became Sur saviors of
[2:17:30] their people Joseph saved many from
[2:17:33] famine storing up grain while Jesus
[2:17:37] offers spiritual salvation from sin
[2:17:41] Joseph in Genesis 45:7 and God sent me
[2:17:44] before you to prepare you a posterity in
[2:17:47] the earth and to save your life lives by
[2:17:52] great Deliverance who is he talking
[2:17:55] to his
[2:17:57] brothers that's who he was talking to
[2:17:59] his own the ones that the ones that
[2:18:02] tried to kill
[2:18:04] him throw him in a
[2:18:07] pit killed an animal took that coat of
[2:18:11] many colors dipped it in the blood of an
[2:18:14] animal took it back to his
[2:18:16] father and said oh Father wild beast
[2:18:20] have t your favorite son apart
[2:18:23] lies he lay rotting in a pit somebody
[2:18:27] had compassion let's sell him to the to
[2:18:30] the traveling Merchants uh you know
[2:18:33] whatever bit of that was God's Sovereign
[2:18:35] will and plan he used the Betrayal of
[2:18:39] his brothers to put him closer to where
[2:18:41] he wanted him to be so that Deliverance
[2:18:45] great help me great
[2:18:49] Deliverance it's going to come to your
[2:18:51] lives my brothers and your children and
[2:18:54] your children's children and your
[2:18:56] children's
[2:18:57] children one of those brother's name
[2:19:02] was
[2:19:05] yehudah
[2:19:07] Juda Judah could have starved to death
[2:19:11] had it not been for
[2:19:13] yourself had it not been for his brother
[2:19:16] Judah would have died there's a problem
[2:19:18] with
[2:19:19] that it's from the loins of Judah that
[2:19:22] Jesus
[2:19:25] came Judah was a son Jesus was a son of
[2:19:31] Judah had he died Not only would
[2:19:35] salvation have not come to all the
[2:19:38] children of
[2:19:39] Jacob but Salvation wouldn't have come
[2:19:42] to you and
[2:19:45] I somebody said you can't look at it
[2:19:47] that way that's exactly how you have to
[2:19:49] look at it well couldn't have God raise
[2:19:51] somebody else up he could have but he
[2:19:53] already had a plan through
[2:19:54] Judah so God preserved his life and
[2:19:57] guess what he used a Brother Joseph who
[2:20:00] could have been offended who could have
[2:20:02] been bitter who could have wanted
[2:20:04] Vengeance who could have wanted to take
[2:20:06] revenge who could have killed them all
[2:20:08] and been Justified even under the law
[2:20:10] for doing so but he chose rather to take
[2:20:14] God's perspective and God's perspective
[2:20:17] said I got a plan in all of this I
[2:20:21] haven't left you
[2:20:23] Joseph I'm taking you from the pit to
[2:20:27] the Palace I've got a
[2:20:32] plan I've got a plan for your life it
[2:20:38] hurts you're bleeding on the
[2:20:41] inside the Betrayal feels more than you
[2:20:44] can
[2:20:45] bear the Bible doesn't talk to us much
[2:20:48] about the time that Joseph spent been in
[2:20:50] the
[2:20:51] pit but it wasn't a
[2:20:54] party or it
[2:20:58] was I'm sure there were days of pity
[2:21:01] party you ever had one don't you look at
[2:21:05] me like you've never had a pity party
[2:21:06] some of you been in one a whole
[2:21:09] week some of you came in here today with
[2:21:11] a big old pity party some old sad look
[2:21:14] on your face wanting somebody to ask you
[2:21:16] what was wrong I'm not I am not going to
[2:21:20] play your
[2:21:26] game my responsibility is not to be your
[2:21:29] buddy God didn't call me to be your
[2:21:31] buddy I don't have
[2:21:33] any he didn't call me to be your buddy
[2:21:37] he didn't call me to treat you or to
[2:21:38] look at you like a friend he called me
[2:21:41] to train you
[2:21:43] that's that's what he said 50 years ago
[2:21:46] when he called me to this work to train
[2:21:49] you because you got something to
[2:21:53] do and you don't always train with a
[2:21:57] carrot thank God for every carrot he's
[2:21:59] ever given me to keep me moving along
[2:22:02] but it wasn't the carrot that brought me
[2:22:04] to my knees it was the staff it was the
[2:22:08] rod it was the
[2:22:10] Whip and you don't even despise the rod
[2:22:14] when you understand its purpose when you
[2:22:18] understand that to be trained means
[2:22:20] means to be
[2:22:22] told and then an example set before you
[2:22:27] that you can follow that's what training
[2:22:30] looks like so I have to practice this
[2:22:34] when I don't feel like when I don't
[2:22:38] wna it's my
[2:22:41] responsibility to
[2:22:43] wna you got to make yourself W sometime
[2:22:46] for somebody else
[2:22:51] as we have talked about before we come
[2:22:53] in here we're not
[2:22:55] Hypocrites we don't come in here to put
[2:22:57] something on we come in here not to
[2:23:00] reflect
[2:23:02] feelings pain or struggles or
[2:23:05] trials I didn't come in here with a blue
[2:23:08] face so you'd ask me what my problem was
[2:23:11] I came in here ready to lift up the Lord
[2:23:15] because it doesn't matter what my
[2:23:17] problem is and it doesn't matter what
[2:23:18] your problem is if Jesus is
[2:23:21] Lord he can handle them all he can take
[2:23:25] care of it all he can heal every pain he
[2:23:28] can soothe every
[2:23:30] heartache he can speak peace to the
[2:23:34] chaos rest to the stress there are
[2:23:38] certain personalities of people we have
[2:23:40] quite a few around here who aren't
[2:23:43] happy if somebody doesn't share their
[2:23:45] level of stress
[2:23:50] you've got to understand that just
[2:23:52] because you're a basket case it's no
[2:23:54] indication that anybody else needs to be
[2:23:57] one to make you feel
[2:23:59] better you don't need somebody to follow
[2:24:02] you down the road of chaos you need
[2:24:05] somebody
[2:24:06] solid you need somebody who will tell
[2:24:09] you the same thing every time you talk
[2:24:10] to them look
[2:24:12] up Jesus is
[2:24:16] Lord he'll get you through he'll make a
[2:24:19] way
[2:24:21] where there is no
[2:24:26] way you shouldn't be compassionate sure
[2:24:29] we should that's not what I'm saying
[2:24:31] sure we should be
[2:24:33] compassionate but some people feed off
[2:24:36] of
[2:24:39] sympathy which is a characteristic of an
[2:24:42] offended
[2:24:47] Spirit sometimes what we think we want
[2:24:51] or
[2:24:53] deserve is not what we need at
[2:24:57] all sometimes we need somebody to look
[2:25:00] us right in the eye and say suck it up
[2:25:07] buttercup get
[2:25:10] up just get up and press
[2:25:15] on oh I love the looks
[2:25:20] and the
[2:25:21] feelings all that gets stirred when you
[2:25:24] preach a little message like
[2:25:27] this I know Jesus wasn't that way he
[2:25:30] wasn't I've prayed for you
[2:25:35] Peter Satan has desired to sift you his
[2:25:38] wheat but I've prayed for you that don't
[2:25:41] sound I I know I know I know how you
[2:25:45] think he said it oh come here Pete
[2:25:52] Peter Peter Peter Peter it's going to be
[2:25:56] all right I don't believe that was he
[2:25:59] tender he was was he kind he was was he
[2:26:03] loving he was was he compassionate he
[2:26:07] was but he understood that he was there
[2:26:10] to train those
[2:26:12] disciples cuz he was
[2:26:14] leaving do you understand the pressure
[2:26:17] that he carried I'm out of here my my
[2:26:20] time didn't he try to tell them my time
[2:26:22] is getting short fellas
[2:26:24] Fellers my time is getting short I'm
[2:26:27] about to leave here if you're going to
[2:26:30] make anything out of yourselves you
[2:26:31] better do it
[2:26:34] now cuz I'm sending you out like
[2:26:38] Lambs Among
[2:26:41] Wolves you run from the enemy and you'll
[2:26:44] become
[2:26:45] dinner you know who you are you'll stand
[2:26:48] up in the faith
[2:26:52] Hallelujah woo don't you realize that's
[2:26:55] what made Peter
[2:26:58] transformed it took him a reed that was
[2:27:01] blown around in the wind and made him a
[2:27:05] solid
[2:27:09] rock revealed a revelation to him that
[2:27:12] the whole Church of Jesus Christ is
[2:27:14] built on the
[2:27:19] betrayer became the
[2:27:21] foundation that the church is built
[2:27:24] on the one who denied the
[2:27:30] denier became the
[2:27:34] reflection he stopped trusting in his
[2:27:37] biceps and started trusting in his
[2:27:40] savior I prayed for you Peter it's going
[2:27:44] to be rough when you see who you
[2:27:46] are Satan has desired to sift you as
[2:27:49] weed
[2:27:52] yes but you're predestinated elected and
[2:27:55] bride you don't have anything to worry
[2:27:56] about is that what he said
[2:27:59] no he said when you get
[2:28:04] saved when you become a new creature
[2:28:07] when thou
[2:28:09] art
[2:28:11] converted when you get what you've been
[2:28:13] talking about when you
[2:28:16] become what you
[2:28:18] confess don't for forget the rest of the
[2:28:21] folks when thou art converted strengthen
[2:28:24] the brothers show them how show them
[2:28:28] give your testimony tell them how weak
[2:28:31] you were tell them how how blown around
[2:28:34] you were tell them how you denied wear
[2:28:38] it don't deny it but don't you stop
[2:28:42] there Peter you go on make sure you tell
[2:28:45] them that it wasn't John who laid his
[2:28:48] head on the breast of the Lord it wasn't
[2:28:51] James who went to Death By The
[2:28:54] Sword it wasn't Matthew or Mark or Luke
[2:28:58] The
[2:28:59] Physician it was you that got the
[2:29:02] Revelation you are not just
[2:29:06] Jesus Son of
[2:29:09] Joseph abiding in
[2:29:12] Nazareth but you are the anointed one
[2:29:15] the mesiah the Messiah you are the son
[2:29:21] of the Living God I've told you hundreds
[2:29:24] of times that wasn't church doctrine
[2:29:27] nobody in the synagogue was preaching
[2:29:29] that God had a son there's prophetic
[2:29:32] indication in the in the prophets of the
[2:29:35] Old Testament Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel
[2:29:38] and maybe a few others that God was
[2:29:41] going to come in another form perhaps
[2:29:44] even as a son but by the time the second
[2:29:47] temple period came nobody
[2:29:51] was teaching preaching or believing that
[2:29:55] Messiah was going to be
[2:29:57] deity or that he was going to be a
[2:30:00] son of the Living God a powerful godsent
[2:30:05] military General who would deliver the
[2:30:08] Jewish people out of uh Roman occupation
[2:30:12] driving back the apostasy of the
[2:30:17] Greeks and making PE for Jerusalem all
[2:30:21] of that they
[2:30:23] believed that's what Peter would have
[2:30:25] been taught that's what he would have
[2:30:27] heard Shabbat after
[2:30:30] Shabbat so it wasn't his Pastor his
[2:30:35] Rabbi it wasn't his
[2:30:38] parents it was somehow in prayer in
[2:30:42] meditation in giving of himself before
[2:30:45] the Lord that a that a truth dropped
[2:30:49] into his heart bypassing his
[2:30:52] head and he said I know who you
[2:30:55] are you're the son of the Living God
[2:30:58] you're God in human
[2:31:00] flesh blessed are you
[2:31:03] Simon for Upon This Rock I'll build my
[2:31:06] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[2:31:08] Prevail against it don't ever forget
[2:31:10] that's the same Peter that the little
[2:31:13] dishwashing woman said you've got to be
[2:31:14] one of them what don't know what you're
[2:31:18] talking about here come another three
[2:31:22] times before the crowed
[2:31:25] once Peter had already denied the Lord
[2:31:28] Thrice three times all the Common People
[2:31:31] isn't that
[2:31:33] amazing people that didn't really matter
[2:31:36] in the economy of
[2:31:38] influence but Peter in that moment
[2:31:40] couldn't stand the thought that somebody
[2:31:41] would think he was identified with him
[2:31:44] because it would mean his sudden death
[2:31:46] and death did come to Peter
[2:31:51] he was martyred he he certainly
[2:31:55] suffered and was willing to pay the
[2:31:58] price in that moment because
[2:32:02] Revelation had preceded it had it had
[2:32:06] taken preeminence or prominence over his
[2:32:10] shiftiness and now he was a rock and now
[2:32:14] he could stand for Christ and now he
[2:32:17] didn't care what anybody thought not
[2:32:19] even the Dig Aries and leaders I am I am
[2:32:22] him you ever heard of that Jesus of
[2:32:25] Nazareth I'm one of his I belong to him
[2:32:28] I am him that's what identification
[2:32:31] means it doesn't just mean I'm
[2:32:33] acquainted with him it means I am him
[2:32:36] whatever you would do to him do it to me
[2:32:39] CU I'm identified with
[2:32:41] him Joseph and Jesus saviors of their
[2:32:45] people have a few more minutes not many
[2:32:47] but a few when Joseph revealed himself
[2:32:50] to his brothers he showed forgiveness
[2:32:52] and mercy just as Jesus offers
[2:32:54] forgiveness to those who rejected
[2:32:57] him Joseph in Genesis 455 now therefore
[2:33:01] be not grieved nor angry with yourselves
[2:33:04] that you sold me
[2:33:05] [Laughter]
[2:33:09] hither don't worry
[2:33:12] fellas can you
[2:33:15] imagine for God God did send me
[2:33:20] God I thought it was midianite
[2:33:26] Merchants Joseph didn't mention the
[2:33:29] pit he didn't mention the 20 uh pieces
[2:33:33] of
[2:33:35] silver he didn't mention the medanite
[2:33:37] traders who traded him
[2:33:40] again before he got to
[2:33:43] Egypt he said for God did send me before
[2:33:46] you to preserve life
[2:33:50] you tried to take
[2:33:52] mine and God sent me ahead to preserve
[2:33:55] yours talk about eating Humble
[2:34:00] Pie they
[2:34:02] ate because of
[2:34:05] Joseph their children ate because of
[2:34:09] Joseph ain't that
[2:34:12] beautiful that's why he had such a
[2:34:14] beautiful
[2:34:16] spirit he took God's perspective in
[2:34:18] Jesus same way in Luke 23:34 then said
[2:34:22] Jesus father forgive
[2:34:25] them they're not just calling him bad
[2:34:29] names they're not just making fun of
[2:34:32] him they're not just inviting him to the
[2:34:36] bonfire they're crucifying
[2:34:42] him they're plucking out his beard
[2:34:46] spitting on his
[2:34:47] face when he said I'm thirsty they
[2:34:50] didn't give him water not not blue
[2:34:53] bottle or
[2:34:56] otherwise they took some hispin which is
[2:35:00] a plant that grows wild and
[2:35:03] rough in the Holy
[2:35:06] Land tied it onto a a pole staff and
[2:35:11] dipped that thing in vinegar and held it
[2:35:14] up to his mouth has anybody in here ever
[2:35:16] thought you sure like to have a big Swig
[2:35:18] of V when you were
[2:35:22] thirsty it only brought a burn to his
[2:35:24] lips parched you ever had chap
[2:35:29] lips come in contact with something with
[2:35:32] any acid in
[2:35:33] it you got really cha lips air can hurt
[2:35:36] it can't it but here's vinegar on an old
[2:35:39] rough piece of Sage Brush like touched
[2:35:42] it to his lips there was no there was no
[2:35:45] uh soothing in that there was no
[2:35:51] no
[2:35:54] Comfort a Roman soldier decided to make
[2:35:57] sure he was out of his misery and took
[2:36:01] a spear and ran it through his side and
[2:36:04] blood and water flowed and and Jesus is
[2:36:08] praying father forgive
[2:36:12] them Joseph is saying don't worry
[2:36:15] Brothers I forgive you God used you he
[2:36:18] got me here to help you and Jesus is
[2:36:20] hanging there saying father forgive them
[2:36:23] for they don't even know what they're
[2:36:24] doing they don't even know they're
[2:36:26] serving the higher purposes of the
[2:36:28] kingdom of God they don't even know that
[2:36:30] in their wickedness with their selfish
[2:36:33] intent they are still in the hand of my
[2:36:35] papa and he is using them to save the
[2:36:40] world to save the world
[2:36:49] there's also a parallel in how Jesus and
[2:36:52] Joseph's circumstances were used by God
[2:36:55] to bring about good as Joseph told his
[2:36:58] brothers I love this
[2:37:02] verse Joseph took God's perspective in
[2:37:06] Genesis 50:20 stay with me a few more
[2:37:08] minutes but as for you ye thought evil
[2:37:11] against me you minute for my
[2:37:18] destruction but God meant it unto good
[2:37:23] to bring to pass as it is this day to
[2:37:28] save much people alive powerful and
[2:37:33] Jesus in Acts 2:23 him being delivered
[2:37:37] by the determinate counsel and for
[2:37:40] knowledge of
[2:37:41] God ye have taken and by Wicked hands
[2:37:46] have crucified and slain
[2:37:50] the Apostle wanted them to
[2:37:53] know you did the dirty deed but you only
[2:37:58] did it because it was the will and the
[2:38:01] forn knowledge of God or you could have
[2:38:04] never done it Jesus told him no man
[2:38:06] takes my life if I die in front of your
[2:38:09] eyes it's because I laid down my life in
[2:38:12] front of you you need to know powerful
[2:38:15] isn't it and then last there are many
[2:38:18] others I just chose
[2:38:21] 10 Joseph's emotional reunion with his
[2:38:24] brothers where he Embraces them and
[2:38:26] speaks kindly Words of Life to them you
[2:38:30] can find that in Genesis
[2:38:32] 45: 14 and 15 it mirrors how Christ
[2:38:37] lovingly received those who come to him
[2:38:40] no longer calling us servants but
[2:38:42] friends as in John
[2:38:45] 15:15 but this speaks of the
[2:38:48] reconciliation with his Brethren Genesis
[2:38:50] 454 and Joseph said unto them come near
[2:38:54] to me I pray you and they came near and
[2:38:58] he said
[2:39:01] hey I'm Joseph your brother remember
[2:39:06] me I'm the one you sold into
[2:39:10] slavery I'm the one you throw it in the
[2:39:12] pit and left to
[2:39:15] die but don't
[2:39:18] worry all is
[2:39:20] well in Jesus Ephesians
[2:39:23] 2:18 says for through
[2:39:26] him we both have access by one Spirit
[2:39:31] unto the father
[2:39:33] reconciliation with their Brethren that
[2:39:36] that
[2:39:37] both is speaking about that one new man
[2:39:40] that we were talking about a little
[2:39:41] while ago because of his
[2:39:44] sacrifice we're no longer divided by a
[2:39:47] wall of partition
[2:39:50] brother brandham makes reference to this
[2:39:53] typology in the life of of Joseph and
[2:39:56] let me give you that and we'll
[2:39:59] close in the message God's only provided
[2:40:02] place of worship shf
[2:40:04] Port I'm only mentioning this because it
[2:40:07] comes to
[2:40:08] mind Jonathan's dad and
[2:40:13] Grandparents were there during this
[2:40:16] series of meetings in shreport and upon
[2:40:19] this com Stone upon Stone in each age to
[2:40:24] vindicate that word that's coming up
[2:40:28] just exactly as Jesus did in his age
[2:40:32] which is the Capstone of it all in him
[2:40:37] laid every
[2:40:39] age oh
[2:40:41] my that doesn't sound like an eighth
[2:40:43] grade
[2:40:44] education in him Jesus laid every age in
[2:40:51] Jesus was
[2:40:54] Moses in Jesus was
[2:40:57] David and Jesus was the prophets and he
[2:41:02] said is that right in those little
[2:41:04] Pentecostals didn't know what to say
[2:41:07] yeah yeah I guess so he said look at
[2:41:10] Joseph sold for almost 30 pieces of
[2:41:13] silver throw it in supposed to be dead
[2:41:16] taken out went and come to the right
[2:41:19] hand of pharaoh look exactly Jesus was
[2:41:23] Joseph was in
[2:41:28] Jesus
[2:41:30] powerful where do you think you
[2:41:33] are you better
[2:41:36] be you better
[2:41:38] be and then uh one more
[2:41:42] place in a masterpiece of a message
[2:41:45] called the
[2:41:47] Masterpiece paragraph 61 one brother
[2:41:50] Bram said now watch every Masterpiece is
[2:41:52] put on a foundation a
[2:41:55] sculpture Angelo he's speaking of
[2:41:58] Michelangelo Angelo's Monument of Moses
[2:42:02] is on a three or four foot piece of
[2:42:04] marble it's got a foundation some of us
[2:42:07] have been there some of us have
[2:42:11] seen these
[2:42:13] statues that Michelangelo created
[2:42:16] including the Pata and which is the
[2:42:18] mother of Jesus holding him his broken
[2:42:22] dead body in her
[2:42:25] arms and his amazing painting in the
[2:42:29] cine Chapel I've seen it with my own
[2:42:32] eyes it leaves some kind of a an effect
[2:42:35] on your on your an imprint on your
[2:42:39] life brother brandham said so God in
[2:42:42] preparing this
[2:42:43] masterpiece he put it on a foundation of
[2:42:47] the Patriarchs
[2:42:50] now typically in scripture the
[2:42:52] Patriarchs are the 12
[2:42:55] sons of
[2:42:58] Jacob it can also
[2:43:01] mean Abraham and Isaac and other fathers
[2:43:05] but in the book of Acts when the
[2:43:07] Patriarchs are referred to it's
[2:43:09] specifically speaking concerning the
[2:43:11] brothers of Joseph Joseph and his
[2:43:13] brothers he said and the patriarch
[2:43:15] Foundation First was Abraham then Isaac
[2:43:18] then Jacob then Joseph he said that
[2:43:21] makes the four
[2:43:23] corners and now Abraham was on the
[2:43:26] foundation of Faith let's say it had
[2:43:28] four foundations the foundation of Faith
[2:43:30] was Abraham the foundation of love was
[2:43:32] Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob
[2:43:36] God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that
[2:43:41] but in Joseph
[2:43:45] woo let's go back and catch that
[2:43:49] Faith was Abraham love the foundation of
[2:43:53] love with Isaac the foundation of Grace
[2:43:57] Jacob but in Joseph Grace but in Joseph
[2:44:02] was
[2:44:04] Perfection there is where he could set
[2:44:07] the monument upon not the First
[2:44:09] Foundation second third but on the
[2:44:11] fourth Foundation
[2:44:14] Perfection that means to us that Joseph
[2:44:17] was a perfect
[2:44:19] type of Jesus and that in Jesus Joseph
[2:44:24] was
[2:44:26] represented Abraham portrayed Christ of
[2:44:29] course so did Isaac in love Abraham did
[2:44:33] in faith Isaac didn't in love Jacob did
[2:44:36] by his grace because Jacob means
[2:44:39] deceiver or supplanter and that's what
[2:44:42] he was but God's grace
[2:44:49] God's grace was with
[2:44:53] him he had to do what he
[2:44:56] did there was a purpose in all of that
[2:44:59] business amen but when it comes to
[2:45:03] Joseph there's not nothing against him
[2:45:06] just one little scratch for the
[2:45:09] foundation must also be a
[2:45:11] masterpiece when he told his father the
[2:45:13] prophet say to say to Pharaoh your
[2:45:16] people are cattle raisers and not
[2:45:18] Shepherds
[2:45:20] because a Shepherd is an Abomination to
[2:45:22] the Egyptians I hardly think that was a
[2:45:27] sin but brother brand is pointing out
[2:45:29] this one
[2:45:32] small differentiation to help you to see
[2:45:36] but when the old prophet got before
[2:45:37] Pharaoh he said your servants are
[2:45:41] herdsmen so it scratched it
[2:45:44] see that's why it still makes it the
[2:45:46] Masterpiece Joseph the life of Joseph
[2:45:50] the foundation of
[2:45:52] perfection beautiful perfect type of our
[2:45:54] Lord he said now the foundation is laid
[2:45:57] through faith love
[2:46:02] Grace let us go
[2:46:05] on I was waiting on you to help me now
[2:46:08] you must be worn
[2:46:09] out let us go on
[2:46:12] unto not laying
[2:46:15] again some preachers all they can preach
[2:46:18] is baptism in jesus' name nothing could
[2:46:21] be more important than
[2:46:24] that but we must get
[2:46:27] it do it tell others to do it and move
[2:46:34] on now the foundation is laid through
[2:46:37] faith love Grace and to Perfection
[2:46:39] through the
[2:46:41] Patriarchs last paragraph now the body
[2:46:45] work that come on this Great Masterpiece
[2:46:48] was the
[2:46:50] prophets
[2:46:51] Patriarchs then the prophets the
[2:46:53] scripture says that the Church of Jesus
[2:46:56] Christ is built on the foundation of
[2:46:58] Apostles and Prophets he said I hope
[2:47:01] hope you can read it the prophets not
[2:47:03] the laws the prophets for the prophets
[2:47:07] with a with a s plural notice was the
[2:47:10] Vindicated word which makes the body not
[2:47:13] the Patriarchs the prophets they were
[2:47:16] the word and that includes Jesus Jus
[2:47:19] Christ who was both Prophet priest and
[2:47:24] King so this is this life of Joseph uh
[2:47:28] we are on page eight of about 12 or 15
[2:47:32] musicians are
[2:47:34] coming will
[2:47:37] close mostly just laying a
[2:47:40] foundation for this
[2:47:45] struggle just consider this week
[2:47:50] had he
[2:47:52] allowed an offended
[2:47:55] heart to be turn to
[2:48:00] bitterness he would have thrown the
[2:48:02] whole plan of God watch me these folks
[2:48:06] can walk without you watching them let's
[2:48:09] watch them come on everybody get in
[2:48:11] place so we can watch y'all
[2:48:15] walk because you all are more important
[2:48:17] than the word
[2:48:21] everybody settled
[2:48:22] now NOP back out the
[2:48:29] door this is pretty serious business
[2:48:34] here because I'm a I'm looking at some
[2:48:36] precious
[2:48:38] people who have been
[2:48:40] Paralyzed by your
[2:48:44] woundedness your offense has been
[2:48:46] contagious
[2:48:49] and there are people sitting here that
[2:48:50] haven't grown spiritually in a long time
[2:48:55] not because the opportunity wasn't
[2:48:57] before
[2:48:58] you but because you couldn't jump over
[2:49:01] that last hurdle and let it
[2:49:05] go there's not a person in this room
[2:49:08] that hasn't been
[2:49:09] betrayed
[2:49:11] wounded sold out in some way your family
[2:49:16] let you down your preachers let you down
[2:49:19] your pastor let you
[2:49:21] down there are some people who are still
[2:49:24] struggling under this thought that
[2:49:26] brother brandom let them down because he
[2:49:28] wasn't a perfect
[2:49:29] man and because he didn't have perfect
[2:49:32] recall and because he left us with some
[2:49:34] confusing questions and they can't get
[2:49:37] over that you better let that one go too
[2:49:41] because if we would have had a perfect
[2:49:43] man we might would have thought he was
[2:49:46] the second coming of Jesus Christ like
[2:49:49] some other misguided and deceived
[2:49:53] Souls but since we saw that he was
[2:49:55] flawed in his flesh and Humanity we can
[2:49:58] accept one another with our
[2:50:02] flaws and with our humanities and still
[2:50:05] respect the gift and the
[2:50:07] office in each other's
[2:50:10] lives we
[2:50:12] cannot let
[2:50:15] offense be strengthened
[2:50:18] by calling out to other spirits of envy
[2:50:22] and jealousy and Division and strife and
[2:50:25] rebellion
[2:50:26] and
[2:50:28] bitterness
[2:50:31] unforgiveness we've got to put this
[2:50:34] thing not to rest to
[2:50:38] death we have to look away to Jesus in
[2:50:41] such an hour as
[2:50:45] this it's going to
[2:50:47] happen somebody's going to let you down
[2:50:50] again somebody's going to hurt your
[2:50:51] feelings again somebody's going to wound
[2:50:53] you again some people are so
[2:50:58] wounded that all they do is go around
[2:51:03] wounding we can blame them or we can
[2:51:07] pray for them and and think in our heart
[2:51:10] how miserable it must
[2:51:13] be to be so
[2:51:15] handicapped that you live to Buckle
[2:51:19] somebody else's knee to knock somebody
[2:51:22] else down what an awful existence it
[2:51:26] doesn't sound anything like the
[2:51:27] overcoming life of a child of God
[2:51:32] there's an author his name is Francis
[2:51:36] frangipan and he says this
[2:51:39] bitterness is unfulfilled
[2:51:44] Revenge bitterness will eat you alive
[2:51:48] right it's an
[2:51:54] acid bitterness can't operate by
[2:51:57] itself it has to have a power
[2:52:00] Twin it has to pull from
[2:52:03] offense and that offense if it's
[2:52:06] partnered with
[2:52:08] bitterness you can rest assured that
[2:52:10] unforgiveness is running in the
[2:52:13] crowd that right there folks will steal
[2:52:17] your victory
[2:52:19] and it'll knock you out of God's
[2:52:21] blessing and
[2:52:22] favor I wouldn't want anybody to be so
[2:52:26] important in my life that they kept me
[2:52:30] out of God's will I wouldn't want
[2:52:33] anybody to be so important in my life
[2:52:35] that they caused me to miss the blessing
[2:52:38] because I allowed what they did to me
[2:52:42] what they said about me
[2:52:49] hinder me stop me discourage me make me
[2:52:53] quit or make me whine I don't only want
[2:52:56] to not quit I don't want to
[2:53:00] whine there's a young man around the
[2:53:03] message who's spending an awful amount
[2:53:05] of
[2:53:06] time talking about himself on social
[2:53:10] media how hurt he is with everybody and
[2:53:14] nobody acknowledges him and nobody lets
[2:53:18] him praying the prayer line and
[2:53:20] everybody talks about him behind his
[2:53:23] back and nobody wants to shake his hand
[2:53:25] and when he when they do he knows
[2:53:28] whether or not they like
[2:53:30] him you know what I'd like to say to him
[2:53:32] but he's not in any way
[2:53:35] teachable what I'd like to say to him is
[2:53:37] join the club
[2:53:39] buddy you just describe my 30 years in
[2:53:43] this
[2:53:47] message I've walked walked into rooms
[2:53:49] having not done anything to anybody in
[2:53:52] that room and knew that I was the talk
[2:53:55] of the
[2:54:01] room people that I've not talked to in
[2:54:04] years knew more about what was going on
[2:54:06] in our church than some of you that sit
[2:54:09] here every
[2:54:11] Sunday and asked me about it while I was
[2:54:14] in
[2:54:16] Tennessee they know what song s we sing
[2:54:19] and they know what losses we suffer and
[2:54:22] they know how what we preach and what we
[2:54:25] do because they've got a an anonymous
[2:54:28] window into here I know what it means I
[2:54:32] know what it means to be discounted and
[2:54:37] devalued I could whine I could write I
[2:54:41] think I'll write 50 devotionals on how
[2:54:43] I've been
[2:54:45] hurt what do you think that would do for
[2:54:48] any
[2:54:49] anybody
[2:54:52] nothing we we we got to get above that
[2:54:55] quit talking about that and talk about
[2:54:58] the
[2:54:59] victories woo I've won some how many
[2:55:03] have won some
[2:55:04] victories how many have overcome some
[2:55:08] offenses how many have loved through
[2:55:11] your pain and
[2:55:12] forgiven through the
[2:55:15] offense knowing they murdered you
[2:55:19] but you forgive them and you can hug
[2:55:22] them and you can say God bless you and I
[2:55:25] love you and mean it somebody ought to
[2:55:27] do something about that tell that talk
[2:55:30] about that write a song about that make
[2:55:33] a Blog about
[2:55:36] that don't wallow around in yesterday's
[2:55:42] junk pick up press on give him praise

[2:57:23] who is mortally wounded love them Speak
[2:57:28] Life to them but God have mercy on you

[2:57:38] saying embrace
[2:57:41] them Speak Life to
[2:57:44] them give them a helping hand and get on
[2:57:47] a and out of
[2:57:49] there because if you lay down with them
[2:57:53] you'll take on their offense and you'd
[2:57:55] be surprise the people who are crippled
[2:57:58] by an offense that was not done to
[2:58:01] them you'd be surprised how many mamas
[2:58:04] are mad at
[2:58:05] people because their children were
[2:58:08] wronged by that
[2:58:10] person that's not your offense to carry
[2:58:13] we're parents we're Mamas and Papa Bears
[2:58:17] we we some times have to give away
[2:58:19] pieces of our mind that's why when we
[2:58:20] get older we're running a little short
[2:58:22] of it
[2:58:23] sometime but the reality is it wasn't
[2:58:28] yours my grandmother used to say the
[2:58:32] children will get out there in the yard
[2:58:34] and fume and fight and
[2:58:37] fuss knock each other
[2:58:41] down parents will get involved and
[2:58:44] everything goes to a higher
[2:58:46] level parents parents are wanting to
[2:58:49] sue go to the school
[2:58:52] board go all kinds of
[2:58:54] ways and guess where the children are
[2:58:57] backyard
[2:58:58] playing mama hates mama daddy hates
[2:59:01] Daddy and the children are all made
[2:59:05] up playing in the
[2:59:07] backyard that's how life is don't you
[2:59:10] get caught up in somebody
[2:59:12] else's Lord
[2:59:15] Jesus I I thank you for the life of
[2:59:19] Joseph I'm not done with him he's
[2:59:22] talking to me and I appreciate that so
[2:59:26] much in his in his moment when he could
[2:59:31] have he
[2:59:33] chose rather your
[2:59:36] perspective instead of his
[2:59:40] fleshly feeling or thought he decided he
[2:59:45] made a choice to trust
[2:59:49] and when he made that decision to trust
[2:59:51] you he couldn't hold on to the hurt or
[2:59:54] the Betrayal or the wound he had to
[2:59:57] believe that you had a higher purpose in
[3:00:00] all things
[3:00:01] Lord I remember reading the book and
[3:00:04] preaching the sermon years ago crucified
[3:00:07] by
[3:00:08] Christians and it came to me by the
[3:00:13] reality that it wasn't the Romans and it
[3:00:16] wasn't the Jews that cruci ified you but
[3:00:20] it was your
[3:00:21] father it was ultimately the will of God
[3:00:25] for you to die on the
[3:00:27] cross so I could forgive the Roman
[3:00:29] soldiers and I could forgive the Jews
[3:00:32] and go on and really that that's our
[3:00:34] present
[3:00:35] reality we have gone through the things
[3:00:38] that we have gone through painful
[3:00:41] hurtful sorrowful things and at any
[3:00:45] moment you could have stopped it at any
[3:00:47] moment you could have stood in the
[3:00:48] middle any moment you could have
[3:00:50] shielded us from the Betrayal or the
[3:00:52] wound but you chose
[3:00:55] rather to
[3:00:57] watch knowing that one day we would get
[3:01:01] above it and Beyond it be stronger more
[3:01:05] filled with faith and closer to the
[3:01:09] position that you could use us in the
[3:01:11] last days thank you Lord for some of it
[3:01:14] us it has been horrible pain
[3:01:18] but every bit of it has brought us
[3:01:20] closer to where you needed us to
[3:01:23] be as manifested and adopted sons of God
[3:01:27] in the end time so Lord we we are
[3:01:30] learning to kiss the
[3:01:34] waves that Dash us again and again into
[3:01:38] the Rock of Ages we love you Lord you've
[3:01:41] never done us wrong you've never failed
[3:01:45] us you have poured in oil and
[3:01:49] wine you have listened to our complaints
[3:01:53] you have heard our sorrowful cries you
[3:01:56] have seen our broken and bleeding hearts
[3:01:59] and you have loved us and healed us and
[3:02:02] restored us now we need you God to come
[3:02:06] and separate
[3:02:07] us from the
[3:02:10] residual that we have held on to so that
[3:02:14] we can be
[3:02:16] free love lives depend children depend
[3:02:20] Generations depend on us to Let It
[3:02:26] Go your strength is perfected in our
[3:02:31] weakness come Jesus and be really big
[3:02:35] and really strong in us we pray for your
[3:02:38] glory let's give him praise let's
[3:02:41] worship him before we go today he's
