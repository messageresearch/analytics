it's her 70 oh I better not tell that it's her birthday and if she wants to wear that I'm going to let her wear it I may wear one on my birthday it's not disrespectful when you know her it's just Megan and we're very happy to celebrate her birthday with her today and tell her how much we love her Zachary is going to have a birthday on Tuesday where is he maybe he's gone out but uh we want to wish him a very happy birthday I think they had a fun time celebrating it the other night with ice skating and I didn't get to be there but I got to be a beneficiary of the homemade ice cream which I didn't need but very much appreciated and it was exceptional it wasn't just plain homemade ice cream it was exceptional I saw we're thirsty of this week sister Rebecca's husband Hollis is going to have a birthday and we want to pray for him on that day and and and celebrate another year in his life and give thanks to God for him and what the Lord is doing for him now and then on Saturday of this week before we meet again is ginger ellsworth's birthday and she's kind of got a sideways smile but it's good it's good to have another year you've made another rotation getting ready for your next one and God is good and Sister Mary botch away in Calgary we send you happy birthday greetings next Saturday as well there will be a service here next Saturday Night February the 4th at six o'clock please join us let's come and be together and you know things come and go and and people travel here and there and I'm going to be taking some time off soon uh somewhere beginning around the second week of February I'll be in for some of the weekends but I'll be away from the office for several weeks and looking forward to it very much um so let's get as many services together as we can and let's Rejoice that we don't have anything to worry about because brother Greeley is gone this weekend so he can be home for a while and without an emergency he's going to come and hold the fort and we're going to be led of the Lord over the course of the next couple of months to see what God has for us I've been praying hard and I'm ready to hear from him I'm I'm expecting to hear his voice over the next couple of months with direction for us for the rest of the year and Beyond we're getting closer to the Rapture than we've ever been before and there's so much in my heart that I want to see him do I want to be a candidate that he can use to accomplish those things before he comes and gets his bride how many of you understand that he's faithful he's going to do his but I want a part of it I'm a little selfish when it comes to that I want a part of what God's doing in the end time I want to be in the middle of it do you hear me I want to be in the middle of it and I'm sure you do as well and so let's position ourselves for what God has for us amen I won't be so far away that I can't get home in an emergency so you don't have anything to worry about and we'll let you know a little bit more about that as the weeks come come away we've got several weekends together before that happens but God is good and he is faithful would you turn with me to Romans where we were Tuesday night I didn't tell them up there that I would go back there but I want to go back to Romans 8 verses 17 through 25 we're going to read that today as we prepare to go into the word and I want to remind you that we serve a supernatural God he desires to use his Supernatural people in a supernatural way and he has supernaturally provided everything that we have need of to finish the course I want to remind you today that everything you need to make the Rapture is in you right now you're not waiting on another portion you're not waiting on more of something you're just waiting on a shift to take place on the inside of you that you would Embrace fully what God has already done on your behalf when our thoughts change our vocabulary begins to change and when our vocabulary changes our circumstances begin to change because we speak to them God wants to hear you sing he wants your voice to be spoken your body desires to hear your voice spoken with the authority of the creator that Authority is in you you didn't create this body he did but his authority resides in you if you let the doctor have more authority over your body than you have if you let him speak with more authority over your body than you speak You're missing your opportunity to take authority over what God has given you to live in it's your house and it's your place to Speak Life to every cell of your body if you believe that's amen so Romans chapter 8 beginning in verse 17 and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God thank you Lord for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now Hallelujah and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body how many of you are looking for a body to be redeemed for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it how many of you are just waiting not waiting by doing nothing but waiting by doing everything we know to do we're waiting by doing everything we know to do to bring ourselves into a higher position I fought many battles in the night last night some on your behalf I don't know what you fought what you faced but God has given us the victory when the sun come up we had Victory and we're going to believe God now I think that presence that came in there a few moments ago was to just wash some of that off of my life and off of your life but let's just have a prayer before we go to the word fully today Father we thank you that you have won the war we thank you that you are the mighty conqueror we thank you that there's not a battle that you have not already won you're giving us Victory Day by Day sometimes minute by minute and we want to thank you for that now Lord the night was long and it was dark and the enemy tried so many times to attack and I I would dare say that I'm not the only one who battles in their mind last night but I thank you that you are my Victor I thank you that you have paid the price and the war is won the victory is mine I want to ask now Lord as we approach your word for myself and for anyone under the sound of my voice who's battling in their mind or has battled through the night with dreams or whatever the enemy might have used to distract them from this day we pray right now that the blood of Jesus be applied to our minds that our minds be painted with calvary's blood that we are able to see that we are purified that we are cleansed by that precious blood that nothing that the enemy would desire to hang on us can remain we shake it off we shake it off we shake it off in the authority of Jesus Christ if there be any heaviness over our lives because of what we have walked through or waded through we shake it off in the name of Jesus we ask that you come and kiss us with understanding from your word and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said amen you may be seated God is so good to us he is so good to us we are his Supernatural bride he is so good to us Hallelujah well I just realized something I printed a new set of notes because I added to them but I didn't Circle things in my new ones that I had circled in my old ones so will you give me a minute to find my circles sure Pastor we're happy to do it we've got time we're not in a hurry we're with you all right in the message Revelation book of symbols 1956 paragraph 70. these are some quotes that I've missed over the last few weeks and I want to call your attention to them and uh then we will move into just a little bit uh different angle this morning paragraph 70 Revelation book of symbols 1956 so is the Church of the Living God that's been born down in the middle of fanaticism and chaos but she's wound her way through the grime you're not listening to me yet she's wound her way through the grime until she's on top of the thing now Hallelujah how many of you been winding your way through some stuff wading your way wasn't that the prayer that we just prayed wading our way through some stuff some slop some Grime some slime but she's on top of the thing now brother random said spreading forth her wings for the flight she's getting ready for the Rapture many shall run to and fro and the people that know their God shall do exploits in that day how many of you believe that's the word that's our promise they shall know their God they shall be strong and they shall do exploits God's revelation to his church sit still Little Flock positionally stay where you are brother Branham is instructing us that we must not lose ground we can't always press forward without the spirit of God leading us but we cannot lose an itch we must sometimes stand still and see the salvation of the Lord so we remind ourselves today to positionally stay where we are don't back up don't compromise don't give in an inch don't trade one addiction for another Addiction come on stay where you are on the word let's go on as sister Gertie and sister Angie used to sing here keep holding on don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to his church that's what's a holding back the coming of Christ now and the great Millennium hear this do you want to understand the delay brother random is telling us where the delay comes from he said that's what's holding back the coming of Christ now and the great Millennium it's this great Supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church what will happen when we awaken that Supernatural power that is already in us we're not waiting for a place to go and get it we're not waiting for another portion of it we're waiting for something to awaken it within our spirit I want you to know I don't know anything better than praise to awaken what is dormant in your life I know the words the answer I know the word is the answer for everything but if you've got something dormant in your life connect to him and that's through our praise we can't sit through a service without raising our hands without engaging and entertaining the spirit of the Lord without welcoming him into our lives to engage with us we can't do that and expect that Supernatural power to raise up in us to the measure that we're looking for we've got to be engaged with him we've got to worship Him and praise him as many as you as many of you have learned to do it's this great Supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church if we can get that thing to wake up in us we don't have to wait any longer on the coming of Christ he's coming back for a church just like he birthed on the day of Pentecost he said it same power same signs same wonders same power same Authority this word has taken us right back to where he started the thing now we've got to catch a hold of that and allow God to awaken every part that's laying dormant in us so that we can step up and take our positions you believe that in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965. paragraph 325 brother Branham says Church you who I'm speaking to tonight Across the Nation if you've separated yourself from denomination and all the filth and things of this world and all those things that keeps you in man-made Creeds and orders and things like that you separated yourself look up get ready the fire is going to fall one of these days God is going to let him come and a sight to behold would you be ready when he comes would you be ready to go up with him when he comes the secret Rapture look at how he says it the secret Rapture of the the Rapture is Supernatural the resurrection is Supernatural and it's only for a supernatural people we need to understand here there are some who have asked questions lately and we need to understand again we may not like it we may not fully understand it but the Rapture resurrection that we're looking for is only for the bride of Christ we've been saying this for years it's what the prophet taught us we've been saying it for years and there's never ever a full amen there's always only a portion of an amen because we don't really like it that way but we didn't get to choose it that way God said the rest of the church is going to go through they're going to have to face some things they're going to have to get their dirty garments cleansed because truth matters I want you to look at somebody and say truth matters you can't believe anything you want to believe and be right you can't believe anything you want to believe and be ready for the Rapture You've Got to Believe I believe truth of that's why he said he sent to us so that we could come every time back to that word and know what we believe you don't have to worry about those who are not going in the Rapture they have the opportunity to do exactly what the word has said they will do they've called on the name of the Lord and they will have eternal life because they have called on the name of the Lord but their way their way their life may get extremely difficult when you and I leave here then what must I tell somebody to do so that they can become the bride it's not about becoming the bride it's about being the bride before the foundation of the world I know that people struggle with that but remember the scripture is clear God loved every nation he created nations of people but out of the Nations that he created he chose one and he said these are my chosen people this is my elect people he's done the same through the church ages he said now I'm going to raise up a people from among the Gentiles I'm going to put my name on them and I'm going to meet with him where I put my name it won't be the names of denominations or Creeds it'll only be under the revelation of Jesus Christ we must value what we have we must value what we've heard we must understand and live the life of joy and victory because God's given us a truth did we deserve it I doubt that would you have chose me would I have chose you think about it but he did anybody old enough to remember the old TV show Father Knows Best your father knew best Hallelujah I'm so glad he didn't choose me because he saw my behavior was always going to be right he chose me because he could he chose me because he looked ahead in my life and he saw that I was going to choose him and that nothing the world through at me was going to cause me to turn my back on him and nothing that the denominations did would so pollute my mind that I wouldn't look for his pure word he knew that when that pure word fell into my life I'd leave everything else and eat that and become transferred into the word changed into the word because I was blessed to eat the word it's big what we're talking about we're talking about the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride she'll be from Mortal to immortality be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep this Supernatural Rapture of the supernatural bride or as he said here this secret Rapture of the supernatural bride is our destiny it's our destiny do you know I've heard people say well I'm just not going to believe that anymore I I I'm just not going to believe that anymore I don't think I I'm the bride and I'm just not going to believe that anymore I'm just going to go find me a place to be an easy Christian somewhere folks I want to tell you something you don't get to make those kind of choices if you were born for this truth you'll walk in this truth or you'll you've never seen the hard life that's coming I'm telling you right now if this is a supernatural year we're going to see God dealing with his people in a supernatural way I wouldn't be surprised if the Holy Ghost doesn't come this year and start claiming what's his so you and I better give him everything that's his in our life right now we better lay it all down and surrender everything because I want you to know I don't even want to mention this or not but I listened this week to the lyrics of a song that Dolly Parton wrote now I say it's a it's really really a shame when somebody that looks like Dolly Parton is the one that has to release a message like like like she's released I don't have any reason to doubt that God gave her a dream she says that God gave her a dream and she wrote a song and released it on her birthday and and let me just give you the the gist of it the gist of it is I've been watching you don't make me come down there [Music] don't make me come down there and have to tend to you my I know you're being quiet because of the vessel I know you're being quiet I'm sure you're right go ahead get it out type it in I'm sure somebody will have something negative to say about me because I mentioned it but I listened to the song and I thought oh my goodness she's not only going to make sinner mad she's going to make the church mad because basically it says I've tried to tell you what to do I've tried to help you along the way and you keep doing it your own stubborn way and I'm going to have to come down and see about you I'll tell you when the bride goes out that's exactly what's going to happen he's going to come down and take care of some business that needs to be taken care of there's no there's no easy peism there's no just floating into eternal life it's a fight for everybody who has it even for you and I who've inherited it because he saw our choice and he chose us even we have to do some contending even we have to do some fighting we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep this is our destiny and I am so thankful for that I want to give God the praise I wanna I wanna catch one that we had already from from the message Queen of Sheba paragraph 10 . I've circled it but we've already had this one but I want us to have it again and yes I'm jumping around and it'll take her a minute or two to get them and uh already she already has some struggle with the computer moving fast enough but uh we're we're willing to wait now they was falling they was failing they was failing to see his Supernatural work the people the churches had gotten so far away from the supernatural until they could not give an answer to their congregation for the supernatural that was being done so they just had to class at something you know this is a problem where we are right now no one is supposed to see a vision except brother Branham that doesn't line up with the Bible uh maybe you got that out of some isolated quote in a church age book but you didn't get that out of the message and if you found that you didn't find it in the word the Bible tells us old men will dream dreams young men will see visions no one is going to come and take that messenger's place but God's going to have a supernatural people that he deals with in a supernatural way and even the Rapture is going to be a supernatural thing and so you know I think sometimes they've used reverence as an excuse for death now let's be very reverent now let's be very reverent let's worship very reverently let's move very reverently let's be very reverent we wouldn't want anybody to think we have the Holy Ghost around here we wouldn't want anybody to think we'd gotten a hold of a live wire around here come on so they have to start making excuses in brother branham's day they had to explain to their congregations why these things were over because they couldn't have people going down to the Brandon campaign and seeing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so they took to their pulpits and they started explaining how these things were done away and many people boldly called it Devils the workings of devils now we come all the way through and the messages found us and has reached thousands tens hundreds of thousands of people around the world and many of us have fallen back into this easy this easy place of of just relaxing and you know a great big spiritual vacation while the enemy just Delights with the way he's ruining marriages and ruining lives and running children out of the faith somebody's got to raise up and say hey we're the supernatural people that the prophet prophesied and we're going to see God moving in Supernatural ways instead of figuring it out laying aside their thoughts and going to the scriptures instead of that they just answered their congregation said why he's the devil that's all he's just a fortune teller or something there's nothing to him they had to say something they had to answer something they couldn't tell the whole truth but then when he did that Supernatural it usually blinds those who are blinded to those things it makes them worse but in every generation God has always had his agents with an S One messenger to an age but many agents how many of you want to be one of his agents it's got down some time to merely one but God always had somebody in every generation that he could lay his finger on oh yes Lord some people that he could put his finger on and say this is my people and they'll do as I tell them to do oh father would you find some people in our midst that you could come down and put your finger on and know that they will do that we will do as you tell us to do isn't that what we're looking for let me make sure I didn't miss one I don't I don't remember if I did this adoption one I remember mentioning an option I don't remember if I did this adoption Tuesday night so let me do this before I move on to the subject for this morning this is from the message adoption number four paragraph 80 brother random said go go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a manifestation now hold on just a minute now how many of you would like to be functioning in such a level in the Supernatural that instead of having to beg for your need you just come up and look at your brother your sister you look at your your pastor you look at someone there near you and you just say brother I need such and such and such and such from the Lord how many of you'd like to be in such an atmosphere that that Pastor or that brother would just turn around and say and I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] and I don't mean just saying it and not be I mean say it and it be he said there's a manifestation well this is what we're believing God for he hasn't changed let's go on oh brother my crops is burning out yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send you a reigning In The Name Of The Lord wasn't one of those manifestations of the spoken word in brother branham's life and Ministry wasn't that control and authority over the elements of the Earth didn't he speak to that storm and didn't that storm have to obey then what about a bride on this scene that could say to that little brother I'll send you all the rain you need in the name of the Lord [Music] can you believe that we might see those things not might can you believe that we will if we stay on the word we will then there shall come oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man the domain don't you believe that God originally gave man the dominion over the Earth he gave it to Adam he gave it to Adam his son he gave Jesus Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in his name with this assurance ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it over the Palmer waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the position the church by that sounding good he said in the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua and Joshua placing the people where they belong now if they wouldn't stand still and he put Ephraim here and over on menace's land and this one would come back fussing and stewing how they ever going to get along isn't that a good question how are they ever going to get along he said I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecostal that's one part of it and then here's the doctrinal part I'm a Oneness I'm a Tunis I'm a three-ness I'm a so-and-so around this message they'll say I'm a one Soul I'm a two Soul I'm a three soul they say all kinds of things I'm a Jackson Knight I'm a Brandon Knight I'm a colemanite I'm a shelley-eyed I'm a wmo I'd I'm a back in that day it was a Perry green night and come on oh no no no no no no I'm a Jesus man come on now I'm beyond that I'm thankful for every servant of the Lord but I'm attached to him how many of you have made him your attachment my anchor holds because it's in the Rock of Ages you with me you said the sons and daughter God is wanting to place his church how are you going to do it stand still God is wanting to place his church the Sons and Daughters of God God let me live to see it as my prayer yes so close till I can just feel it with my hands almost look like it's right there that's what I've longed to see waiting for the time when walked down the street there lays a laying there from his mother's womb Silver and Gold Have I None oh waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God hallelujah listen this is the most successful healing minister of all time [Music] tens of thousands of people came from all over the world and received their healing and he's not satisfied he won't be satisfied as long as they're all coming to him for what they need he's looking for a day when the Bible talks about the Bible talks about Bible days here again the church moving like the Apostles of old he said oh waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God hallelujah when God shall make himself known when they'll stop sickness you're not listening when they'll stop sickness when they'll stop cancer they'll stop diseases I want you to listen carefully to paragraph 88 you think Cancer's something the Bible said there's coming a time when men will not will rot right in their flesh and the buzzards will eat off carcasses before they even die cancer is a toothache to what's coming if you read the book of the Revelation you'll find out that after the Rapture of the church there's such disease such hideous hideous judgments falling on planet Earth we better be so thankful so grateful realizing how blessed we are to have a ticket for the first trip out of here I want you to turn with me now to Ephesians chapter 6. beginning in verse 10 through 18. if we serve a supernatural God if we are a supernatural people and God has surely provided everything we need to fight the good fight of faith and he's certainly given us a supernatural armor to stand against The Wiles of the enemy and we're going to need it finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil folks if God has given us various pieces of the armor we got to put it all on we can't go out to meet life with some of it missing we've got to make sure that we are fully dressed in the armor of God to be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood this is not a personality fight this is not a people conflict but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and all right wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all and having done all having done all just stand and you can't do anything else you know what you can do you can stand we must stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness which is his and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God how many of you think that sounds like a pretty good armor praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints we're going to the message it wasn't so from the beginning paragraph 25 now we find Our Lord then in his work that he claimed to do nothing of himself John 5 19 20 and verse 30. but what he seemed the father doing he gave all praise to God thing that was unnatural Supernatural every armor that we have brother all of our armor is what does it surprise you that a supernatural God would dress his Supernatural people in a supernatural armor [Music] be no surprise in that why would God give a supernatural people a natural armor when our battle is not a natural battle it's not a flesh and blood battle amen I said a moment ago it's not a battle of personalities it's not a battle of various cultures it's a spiritual battle in order to win a spiritual battle we have to use spiritual weapons in order to fight in a supernatural battle we have to have a supernatural armor I'm so glad that our armor is a supernatural armor nothing natural that we have he said we must believe it I want you to watch this next paragraph because these are not the kind of weapons that we are used to fighting with we usually fight with our words anybody here this morning I can't fight for you all night and then fight for you all day somebody's gonna have to do something we usually fight with our words and if our words don't do anything we we might even fight with our fist well don't look at me like you hadn't don't tell me you've never slapped somebody don't tell me you've never punched somebody most may not have but quite a few have [Music] let me see your hand if you're willing to admit you've you have oh that's the majority of us Josh did you hold up your hand you've never punched one of your brothers oh let me let me you'd make a good Philadelphia attorney that's what that sounded like you know they used to say I don't recall [Laughter] have you ever punched anybody have you ever slapped anybody you ever hit anybody ever knocked anybody down sister under view oh I think if we went around maybe it was our siblings our brothers our sisters our exes I don't know what it was but somewhere along the way we've let our anger get the best of us and we've tried to win a battle in the natural you'll never win a battle in the natural because even those natural what seem like natural battles when they have to do with your life they're bigger than natural there's some reason why the enemy is trying to get you entangled in this fight there's some reason why he's trying to distract you from your Spiritual armor here's how God wants us to fight in this hour he said what is the fruit of the spirit love Joy peace who's ever heard of winning a battle with peace who's ever heard of winning a battle with love who's ever heard of winning a battle with joy meekness gentleness patience he said now you go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarter's worth of patience I need it five dollars worth of love I could stand a lot of that see it's the Unseen something listen it's the Unseen something that's our whole armor if we're fighting a battle in an unseen Realm then our weapons may not be seen in the natural they may also be unseen but Supernatural he said that's our whole armor we stand in the Unseen World looking at the Unseen things yet to us we see them because our faith detects them and says it's there see I want you to know you are well equipped second Corinthians chapter four verse 8 in the Amplified Bible says this then what verse did I give you I gave you the wrong verse anybody here it's second Corinthians 4 18 not 4 8. sorry about that in the Amplified Bible second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 18. since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are visible are temporal brief and fleeting but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting how many of you are thankful then that your weapons are are unseen we have to train ourselves where to look our flesh and nature will always turn to the Natural circumstances that surround us but we have another nature his spirit in us will often remind us and provoke us to look to the Unseen realm the other realm the reality of the supernatural unseen realm when the enemy tries to weight us down and discourage us and confuse us and defeat us we'll never get out of that place if we're looking at our natural circumstances it's only when we look away to Jesus isn't it it's only when we make a conscious decision okay I know what I see I know what it looks like I know what it smells like I know what it sounds like but I also know what God's word has said about it so I choose to ignore what I see in here and I choose to Anchor myself in what I cannot see in the natural but what my faith tells me is very much a reality in the message sir we would see Jesus brother random said in paragraph 45 and the whole Christian armor now is unseen the Christian looks at what he doesn't see natural now look that's the only way you can be a Christian you've got to believe God who you can't see see now look watch here the whole Christian armor is love Joy faith long-suffering patience meekness gentleness Holy Spirit see all those things are unseen they're unseen but the things that's unseen is the ones that has the reality the Unseen things if you and I would start fighting these battles that come with the Unseen realm with love with joy with faith with long suffering with patience with meekness with gentleness if we would allow the goodness of the Lord to overwhelm us and we start responding to to all the attack of the enemy with the armor that God has given us we can have the victory brother we can walk in the victory how many of you believe that calling Jesus on the scene uh 64 or paragraph 11 I like this first phrase he said you can't make yourself believe have you ever tried to you can't make yourself believe it's something it's a quality that's in you faith is the substance not just to make imaginary it is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you believe and you don't see even when you don't see you believe and all the whole Christian armor now remember is by faith it's all Supernatural how are you going to fight with with faith and love and joy and peace and long-serving goodness me you're going to have to do it by faith you're not going to be able to take an inventory and say I don't think these things are in my life and therefore I'll just go down and utter defeat you're going to have to claim them by faith you're going to have to say if I have the Holy Spirit then the fruits of the Holy Spirit or somewhere in me the armor for the Unseen battle is somewhere in me I'm going to have to ask God to bring that to manifestation that's all unseen things that's the whole Christian armor the Christian always looks at things that he does not see because he's looking what that's right I had a promise not what's going on presently he keeps his eye on the promise he refuses to look on what the enemy you know he tries to howl and huff and puff and threat to blow the house down and all the things the enemy does because he wants to get your eyes off the promise he wants to get your eyes off the word and then in the message the Queen of Sheba paragraph 17 brother random said that's the only way you can be saved is by faith the Bible said without faith it's impossible to please God you've got to look at the Unseen and a whole armor of Christianity is Supernatural the people how that a man can say that he believes in God and preaches in a church and says he does not believe in the Supernatural when the full armor of God the full armor of Christianity is what the full armor what is the armor of Christianity love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness patience Faith did you know we can't make ourselves produce these things it's only by engaging with the Holy Spirit it's only by staying in touch with the holy spirit that we're able to produce any of these fruit we can't make ourselves do these things we just have to yield to the Holy Ghost that's in us that means we have to very much be in touch with who's walking around in our shoe leather he said what is love what is Joy go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarters worth of it I need it right now see you can't buy love joy peace long-suffering goodness patience gentleness Faith you can't buy it it's it's what tell me what it is and the whole armor of the Christian is what and we're bitten by the scriptures to put on the whole armor of God be girded about the whole armor did you know he's telling us to be dressed with the supernatural Gotta Have It you got to believe in it you got to believe for it before you can have it don't you let the enemy talk you out of the supernatural in your life in your life you've got to have it and then in a message demonology the Physical Realm paragraph 91 brother Brandon said the whole armor of God is what by faith how do you know you got it on by faith I mean you can go through the scripture I've done it before in prayer Lord I'm asking I'm putting on the helmet of South I'm putting on the Lord right now I'm asking you to give me the shield of faith Lord I'm asking you to let my feet be shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace Lord I'm asking you to place the sword of the spirit in my hand I've prayed through the armor many many many many times but how do I know he did it how do I know it's there I have to believe it by faith he said it was my armor I give you the this is the believer's armor I'm giving you the whole armor of God and it's by faith we haven't got one natural thing of this world everything a Christian Church is a faith act look at the armor of God love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience is that right everything what everything's Supernatural nothing natural so we don't look at the things natural the bill that is not being paid the symptoms of the physical infirmity the confusion in the family we don't look at the things natural because we're not operating there the little bride of Christ is to be operating where in the Supernatural how does she do it by faith by faith by faith how do we operate in the things that are Supernatural by faith and the only way we can base it is Faith is on what God Said was the truth and we look at the Unseen we look at the Unseen we purposefully consciously choose again and again and again and again and again to look at the Unseen and here's what we must do even like Abraham call those things which are not as though they were my family is seeing you my family is sealed the Battle Is Over Victorious one it's already done come on you just don't know how mean they've been this week my family is sick they didn't like one of my pictures on Facebook this week I'm really being persecuted my family is really persecuting me they didn't like any of my pictures on Facebook this week my family is sealed you know we get aggravated at people sometime I get aggravated with some of you at times I'm gonna give you an example it's going to be a little personal are you ready let me just take a little water I don't need more courage but I do need a little hydration I want to see how I'm going to say this we love details I'm a detail driven person I like details some folks in this church don't like details they live in the general areas of life nothing specific you're waiting for me explain I know I know I know so by the time you get the prayer request you don't get many details with it from some folks some folks give you way more details than you need when he went out of here he had on blue socks and Tennis Shoes now how many of you know you don't need to know that to pray for him come on and then you've got the other ones that'll just say he needs prayer well we all do and sometimes we'll come back around and check with some of them that said he needs prayer well how's he doing I don't know these folks are not very detail driven I don't know how he is I ain't heard from him don't know couldn't tell you and you want to say didn't you ask me to pray for him I'm saying him to help throw off the scent trying to find well I don't know hadn't heard from him in a while so what am I supposed to do somebody tell me what am I supposed to do am I supposed to keep praying or am I supposed to wait for you to tell me he needs prayer again follow me just a minute I know this is getting a little long because I'm having so much fun there's a fine line sometimes we would like a checkup come on give me a little checkup is anything changed is anything any better it's all the news bad has there been any good news and sometimes people live such a close private life they don't want they want you to do all the praying but they don't even want you to even know what you're praying about so you better have the Holy Ghost and sometimes listen and that's very frustrating but sometimes someone has had to make a conscious decision I can't live in the details I can't live in what I see what I hear or what I know I can't live by the pictures I see are the reports that I get I've got to live in the Unseen and then the Unseen he's already CEO see so sometimes we're very frustrated when we don't get to know all of what's going on but we also must remember that some people have chosen in life yeah to to say wait a minute I can't live from the day-to-day reports of it's worse today than it was yesterday he's gone from beer to Jack Daniels you don't need that detail you you don't need the detail you you don't need to know what pill he's changed for what pill what what addiction he's traded for another addiction what you need to know is your answer doesn't come from the scene world your answers coming from The Unseen Hallelujah your faith is not going to be anointed if you're only looking to what you can see and what you can hear but if you make a decision my family is sealed come on my body is healed we're not living until the doctor's report we're living by the faith in the son of the resurrected Lamb of God and we know that he is able the only way we so so we don't look at the things natural because we're operating Supernatural and the only way we can base it is faith faith is on what God Said was the truth we look at the Unseen God said he's all right God says she's going to be all right God said if you put your trust in me everything's going to be all right because I'm moving he's moving even when we don't see him even when we don't feel him he's moving come on like brother Joss sung he's turning it around we don't see the turnaround yet but we're not looking to what we see we're looking to what we cannot see because that's where the promise is and so sometimes we have to call those things which are not as though they were if you're doing that without faith you're telling a lie you're just lying but if you're doing that with faith you're doing exactly what God given has given you the privilege to do call those things that are not as though they are she's going to be okay why because I'm calling those things that have not yet manifested into existence God's got the job so I'm not looking at the lack thereof I'm looking at the promise never seen the righteous forsaken or God's seed begging for bread how many of you appreciate this verse Abraham he did it he guided amen Abraham called those things which was not like God did as though they were being a hundred years old he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief may God give us the strength that we need not to stagger at the promise of God through unbelief now are you too tired to hear a little more you sure in a message called only believe paragraph four use our armor we got an armor God works with us and gives us the armor and the whole armor is on the supernatural see love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience is all in the Supernatural if I should ask you do you have love joy peace long-suffering goodness meeting at gentleman's patience you'd say well I on a good day I do but I don't have many good days see you're looking at what you think what you've perceived you're not looking at the supernatural you're looking at it a very natural way well I don't seem to have enough love I don't seem to have enough Joy I don't seem to have enough peace but this is Supernatural by faith there's no way to measure this it's all in him so the reality is yes I have love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience all these Supernatural things are working in me because I have the Holy Ghost the real question is do you have the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost love joy peace long-serving goodness beings it's there because the Holy Ghost is there it's all in the Supernatural even when you don't see it even when you don't feel it even when it's not manifesting to the measure that you would desire it doesn't mean that it's not there now remember he goes on and if you let your faith loose to God's spirit it brings your body in subjection to God's Redemptive blessing to you I think you should hear that and pay a little attention to that if you let your faith loose if you turn your faith loose toward God's spirit that brings your body in subjection to God's Redemptive blessing for your life and anything that Jesus died for he's sitting at the right hand of the father tonight that's figurative figurative that's the right hand of power and authority that's the figurative language of the Bible just like when he said he sent the angels to the four corners of the Earth it's figurative biblical language don't let that throw you up the Bible's full of that kind of poetic language all right let your faith loose to God's spirit it brings your body in subjection to God's redempted blessing to you and anything that Jesus died for he's sitting at the right hand of the father tonight making intercessions [Music] upon your confession well I don't have no faith I don't have no love I don't have enough Joy I don't have enough long-suffering I don't have enough goodness what could he say what could he say if he's making intercession only on your confession he'd have to repeat before the father what you say well he said he didn't have any love not enough love he said he didn't have any joy that do you think that's going to get anything done no no that's not the way it worked if your confession is this I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and therefore every Redemptive blessing of God is mine and any place where I have been short in the past in manifesting the Supernatural Armor of God I confess I decree I declare in the mighty name of Jesus that I will be filled and protected with love with joy with peace with long suffering with meekness with goodness with gentleness because that is my inheritance thank you and then figuratively our Lord is confessing out over the heavenlies do you hear that he's filled with love he's filled with joy he's filled with peace and the angels say then let me go and minister to him and let me go minister to her and let me do what I can to help make sure that they're walking in the promise that they're confessing you believe it works that way I do I really do I actually do all right let's go on whatever you confess that he's done and believe it's your personal property every believer every person that's born again has the right to any of the Redemptive blessings when you get saved Jesus just takes and hands you a checkbook to last you all through life's journey and his name signed at the bottom of every one of them oh my my my my whatever you have need of you ask the father in my name it'll be done just sign a check and send it up there are you afraid to sign one tonight no fill her out send it up it's recognized yes sir it's recognized he'll certainly bring it to pass this is Supernatural now part of our Supernatural armor are those fruits of the spirit but the greatest weapon that we've been given in the Supernatural to fight the supernatural battle by a supernatural God as a supernatural people is the word I want you to look at these just with me just a few minutes the conflict between God and Satan 1962 paragraph 58 this is powerful stuff right here he said God knew this great Warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people oh my goodness the devil could never get ahead of God he could never plan a war that God didn't know anything about he knew every detail so so God knowing what the devil was going to do God knowing what the enemy was going to do he provided everything you and I need to defeat him on every on every level on every plane God knew this great Warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do he know just exactly how to equip God's people so if we notice the very first thing that God equipped his children was being infinite he knowed what it took to defeat Satan Anytime Anyplace anywhere on any condition I'm going to say that again I didn't get enough he knowed what it took to defeat Satan any time any place anywhere on any condition now he wouldn't say I'll give him something here in a few years later I may study out something better to give them and then after a few years later like we in the military force the old bow and Aaron Sledge rock hammer the next was after bow and aracoma musket and after a musket of Springfield and now the atomic weapon and things he kept growing more but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's the infinite God now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle listen God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition the right kind of an attack the right kind of everything that they had need of that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the rapture it's been provided for us to get us all the way from Eden to the rapture if you believe that's amen what was it huh that's what defeats Satan it's the word it'll defeat him anywhere any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing there is the word you want to win a supernatural battle use your Supernatural weapons the word we find Jesus on Earth just to prove that was the best equipment when Satan come in hand-to-hand combat with Jesus can you imagine brother Branham is saying that Satan came in hand-to-hand combat with Jesus he never just reached over with his power and tied his hands he just took the same weapon that God gave in the Garden of Eden his word look at what Jesus said it's written it's written and he punched him right out of the ring with it that's right because it's God's best the word is God's best paragraph 62 and look where it is it's not just one or two in a church it's for every one of us every believer has a right to take his word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him anywhere you meet the enemy this word is what you have to use and Jesus proved it when he come oh Hallelujah so he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy when the all-out Warfare comes at the battles and set in a ray there's only one thing a real Soldier can use a real Christian Soldier [Music] that's thus saith the Lord powerful word that's our weapon right there that's all we need it's thus say of the Lord walk right out there and meet the enemy with the assurance that nothing thousand may fall at your right in ten thousands at the left but will come neither just remember that God made this statement and gave this to his children and it's the best thing that's ever been yet Satan and Eden when he first come to these attacks to attack a person knowing the children of God was fortified with the word with this word Satan attacked the word see he never attacked the being he attacked the word first oh yes you can't believe that Branham guy you see if the enemy can move you off the word because that's what the word is that's what we've got we've got the word of God it's right here for us we carried under our arm we better be carrying it in our heart and we couldn't always understand what we read and so God kept his promise and he gave us an understanding of that word by Revelation and he did what he always did throughout the scripture he used a prophet to help us understand that word don't let that throw you off that was always God's plan that was his plan from the beginning the first prophets in the Book of Genesis it goes all the way through the Bible it was always God's way it was always God's plan but see if the enemy can can discredit brother Branham in your mind he'll cause you to doubt the word you believed you'll take everything brother bam said and you'll start questioning that that's how somebody could leave a church like this and go back to a trinitarian church because once you start discrediting a man you'll start taking everything he ever said apart and you'll be getting father and father and father away from the word every chance every time just further and further away and the enemy just bold mind what a what a what a joy what what a real celebration it is for him because the only thing that God has given you to defeat him you're getting further and further away from that because you're letting the enemy discredit that in your own heart and mind so you won't use that against him you ought to take this word and use it you ought to take this word and defeat the enemy because according to this message it'll work anytime anywhere under any circumstance wherever you meet the devil all you got to do is pull the word out and whip the tar out of him I agree he may not respond to you but he will respond to the word he has no choice you anybody believe that he attacked the word first and then in the greatest battle ever fought I think I'll do one more I'm very tired and I think you are too uh in the in the in paragraph 149 of the greatest battle ever fought he said the great hour of charge is at hand Hallelujah soldier with armors gleaming color streaming faith and doubt is setting yourself in a ray in this Tabernacle this morning doubt on one side faith on the other this is where we are this is where we are sold your standards your post of Duty hallelujah our captain the Morning Star leads on he never goes back he never don't know the word retreat he don't have to retreat a man certainly the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt oh my between everybody the Battle Zone Shine Your spear soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready amen God anoints his army America dresses their soldiers in the best that they can have to dress with steel helmets and armors and whatever they got armor tanks whatever they go in god dresses his army hallelujah what kind of equipment do we use the spirit of the sword the word of God Amen it's the best there is the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword Hebrews 4 Pearson even the son of the bone even the mayor of the bone even a discerner the thoughts of the Mind the word of God to believe his word and that's the way God armors that's what he gave to Eve to arm herself with she broke her armor down how'd she do it by opening up her mind to reason now does a sister really have to wear a skirt in a dress all the time the Bible just said long hair it didn't say you couldn't trim it and so is it really wrong for a woman to put the scissors to her hair that's how the enemy works is it really wrong for you to follow that trail of pornography after all it's no one else is involved it's just your sin just you wouldn't that be much better than you going out and getting another woman somewhere and causing such pain and heartache see how the enemy works I I don't want to just stay on the sisters but I I saw that so many years ago the enemy would come to a sister start talking to her well you know if you really want to be able to deal with it you just get it permed and then you won't have to deal with it as much because it'll it'll it'll tighten it up and shorten it up and you'll be able to do something with it and the next thing you know it's so chemically burned until it's all fallen off and falling out and anybody listening to me that that is that's power on your head you be careful what you do with that because that represents power and authority on your head and brother sister when you go to pray you need all that power and authority that you can have and it's a it's an outward don't you let the enemy start talking to you reasoning away those things as though they don't matter they matter um don't you let the enemy say well I'll go to the theater with my pastor to see the chosen but next week I saw a good advertisement there and and it may be are but it probably won't be too bad so I'll just go and sit down in front of that come on well I noticed someone else had this and I noticed someone else was doing this and I know so the enemy is so slick and so sly that he will come and try to get you to reason with your own faith you set out never ever to open up your life for compromise but the next thing you know you've fallen off that slippery slope very very very careful because once you get down that slippery slope and away from the word I'm telling you you're losing the very weapon that you have to win the supernatural fight that's what he gave Eve to arm herself with she broke her armor down how'd she do it by opening up her mind to reason you didn't reason you don't reason with God's word it has no reason God didn't have to offer us a reason for what his word says we just say amen and do it we don't have to have an explanation I hope somebody's listening to me we don't have to have an explanation there's no reasoning in God's word there's not no doubt about it there's no reasoning to it it's God's word that settles it in fact that settles it forever I said we were going to close by and read one last one while the musicians are coming it's quite early somebody say it's quite early I'm going to putting on the whole armor of God I want to tell you something else that God has given us to help fortify the army we found out that his word is our greatest weapon and that he has dressed Us in the armor of these great fruits of the Holy Spirit but God's given us something else and we better understand that we need this it's way more than press play and obey we need a live Ministry first of all we need a living example we need somebody who can teach us how to praise we need somebody who can lead us in prayer we need somebody who can show us how to respond to the word paragraph 76 now God fortified his army what with himself I tell you you can't get any greater fortification than God fortifying his own Army so God has fortified his army himself and how has he done that in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors all plural all plural we need that five-fold Ministry what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is God's dress in inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer 4C before Satan ever gets to it Dunn told it uh what is it God dressed up in his church we have had the last messenger but we have not had the last prophet or the last Apostle or the last Pastor or the last teacher or the last evangelist we know exactly how long they'll be with us because Ephesians tells us until right we all come to the unity of the faith he said these office God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit working through man a woman have a beautiful role in the body of Christ to have gifts and to operate in those gifts but not to serve in that fivefold Ministry that's not their place this is God's spirit his presence working through man and if that office listen and if that office denies any of this word so for instance if you've got a pastor who denies any of this word and he's disqualifying himself as being a part of God's dress wear oh wow and if that office denies any of this word then it's not God dressing no not that that's the wolf in sheep's clothing watch that fellow beware of him and that's me or anybody else it is your responsibility to make sure that I do not deny the word if I get off that word it's your responsibility to pray me back on that word not your responsibility to write emails about me post articles about me publicly rebuke me but it's your responsibility to warn me to pray for me to help me because if I fall away from being a part of God's dress wear then you're left without that representation of God in your midst so we've got to pray for our leaders our pastors our ministers and we have young men Among Us who have said to me they feel the call of God on their life to minister the gospel and we want to make room for them In God's Time because he doesn't just use the tape player or the computer or the MP3 or the Chip he's ordained this five-fold ministry as part of the way that the Church of Jesus Christ is fortified against the enemy that fivefold Ministry must stay on the word if he Strays from that word then we've got big problems that need to be dealt with if you believe that say Amen so not only do we serve a supernatural God we're a supernatural people and not only are we a supernatural people but God has given us everything we need supernaturally to win this battle there is a secret Rapture coming for the supernatural bride of Jesus Christ we have the gifts of the Spirit that are given to us as armor you meet the enemy with love and joy and peace and come on brother random tells us how devils are cast out they're not cast out in anger [Music] devils are cast out in love that's how the enemy is defeated it's by that armor that God has given us thank you Jesus for it he's given us his word which is the greatest weapon that anybody can have against the enemy and then thankfully God has also given us a five-fold Ministry to help prepare us to help protect us to help keep us in the faith because we are a supernatural people let's Stand Together you'll have to Pardon Me he's good he's so good he deserves Our Praise he deserves our focus our attention we want to spend the time left that we have together today worshiping him and lifting up his name if you have a need let me tell you how to get your need met come into His presence with worship come into His presence with praise draw the Holy Spirit to you by the way that you acknowledge the sovereignty and faithfulness of God Lord you are so good you are so faithful you have been so good to us oh Lord we have so much to be thankful for you start letting that flow out of the depth of who you are and God is more than able to come right where you are and meet your need but it's always so wonderful when we can come and worship God together so come and lead us let's come and prepare our hearts again and worship before we go let's see what the Lord will do he's not finished with us yet let's see what he'll do before we leave Hallelujah thank you
