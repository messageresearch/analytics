[0:00] and without the life of God you have an
[0:03] expiration date
[0:09] [Music]
[0:10] but you must understand that without the
[0:14] blood
[0:15] Grace is empty
[0:17] there has to be a prize there has to be
[0:20] a token for Redemption
[0:22] there has to be the shedding of blood so
[0:26] Grace became the transportation it
[0:29] became the truck that got the blood to
[0:33] your house but if the blood had not
[0:36] arrived you are still dead
[0:40] had the blood not gotten to your house
[0:43] you are still lost because the blood is
[0:47] the very life of God and without the
[0:50] life of God you have an expiration date
[0:53] you can't live eternally without the
[0:56] life of God so don't de-emphasize
[1:01] we're not
[1:03] some works
[1:05] by grace but without the shedding of
[1:08] blood there no remission for sins so I
[1:12] want you to understand that Grace was
[1:16] the transportation that got the token
[1:19] price of God's blood to you
[1:24] to you Grace brought it to you in your
[1:26] condition
[1:27] you couldn't have gotten to the blood on
[1:30] your own the blood had to come to you
[1:33] his
[1:35] had to reach farther down than you and I
[1:39] couldn't reach up we could have never
[1:41] gotten to Grace we could have never
[1:44] gotten to the blood but Grace delivered
[1:49] the token life of the blood to you
[1:54] met you right in the gutter
[1:56] he brought you from the gutter most to
[1:59] the uttermost
[2:01] met you right in your sin
[2:03] right in your bondage right in your
[2:06] addiction right in your filth the blood
[2:10] found you there because Grace got it to
[2:13] you so you're saved by grace because you
[2:16] had to get the blood the token price had
[2:19] to get to where you are but do not
[2:21] de-emphasize the power of the blood of
[2:24] God for without that blood there is no
[2:27] hope for salvation
