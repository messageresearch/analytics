Description:
"I want you to understand that as believers of this end time truth, that God allowed that same pillar of fire to come down at Shavuot in the upper room and divide itself.  

So if the pillar of fire is the anointing and the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God, I want you to understand that when the anointing comes, he comes like a Person, not a feeling, but he comes as a manifestation of God."

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
understand that as Believers of this end time truth that God allowed that same Pillar of Fire to come down at Shavuot in the upper room and divide itself one great manifestation of God now divided into individual little licks of fire appearing over their head and that same light I want to say this again it divided itself you see God is in the multiplying and dividing business he both multiplies and he divides and so on that day he both multiplied and he divided he divided himself because he was that light he was that fire he was that cloud amen same manifestation the Bible is clear that was God that wasn't an object lesson that wasn't just a symbol it was a manifestation of God so if the pillar of fire is the anointing and the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God I want you to understand that when the anointing comes he comes like a person not a Feeling but he comes as a manifestation of God if the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God did you know the anointing is also a manifestation of God not a Feeling it's really God showing up in the house and the pillar of fire is a manifestation of God amen and uh so are you because you are a word sent from God and the Bible said that God is very very particular about his word and not any of his word none of it will return to him void and what that means is it will not return to him not having accomplished all that he sent it to accomplish and that includes you you must see yourself as a part of that word a part of that fire a part of that anointing we are the anointed did you know anything that the anointing falls on it becomes anointed of God did you know on that day that the pillar of fire fell on the mountain it chose an ordinary Bush if I know anything about God's character he chose the loneliest bush [Applause] he chose Bethlehem chose to make him a Galilean he chose Shepherds to sing about his birth to go tell the good news about this verse why it had to be Shepherds so if I know anything about the character of God he didn't say let me look down here and see the most amazing Bush I can use it it was more or less most likely that it was just a scrub God said that one will do when God crawled into that bush and it began to burn with a fire and the fire could not consume the bush God protected the bush so that he preserved the bush so that it burnt but was not yet consumed so when was that bush most important when God was in the bush when the fire was on the bush was the bush holy before the fire or after the fire it was holy when the fire came if we were denominationally minded we would say as soon as the fire left the Bush was still holy and we would build a shrine and we would paint a picture of it and we would make an icon in the Church of it and we would have people do the sign of the cross when they passed the picture of the Bush because we like to put the holy in common things and make them big things and we do that with religious intent and not sincere Hearts so I don't know what the bush looked like after but I want you to know as long as the fire of God was on that bush an ordinary Bush was made into a holy bush and as long as you and I have the very life of God inside of us doesn't matter what we were five seconds before he came when he puts himself in US we become a holy Bush we become a holy people foreign
