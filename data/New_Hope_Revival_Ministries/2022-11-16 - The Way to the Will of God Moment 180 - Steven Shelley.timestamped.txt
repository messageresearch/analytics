[0:00] and we want to know where God is going
[0:03] we look to the word
[0:11] I want to say to you body of Christ
[0:15] that it is not enough to know the will
[0:18] of God
[0:20] we want to know the will of God without
[0:22] knowing the will of God we wonder
[0:25] aimlessly directionless
[0:29] we we have a tendency to go in circles
[0:31] in fact
[0:32] because we don't like to go too far
[0:35] beyond our comfort zone so I want to say
[0:38] to the church today it's not enough to
[0:41] know the will of God I think that
[0:43] sometimes our attitude is the highest is
[0:48] to know the will of God
[0:50] if I can know God's will for my life
[0:52] then I have really achieved something
[0:55] well I want you to know that until we
[0:58] know the way of God
[1:00] and until we are able to understand the
[1:03] ways of God it does us very little good
[1:06] to know the will of God because you can
[1:09] know the will of God and not understand
[1:11] the ways of God and Miss what you know
[1:15] you may know that it is God's will for
[1:18] you to go to a particular place but if
[1:20] you don't know the way of God
[1:22] you won't know how to get there in God's
[1:25] will
[1:25] [Music]
[1:27] and and how do we learn the way of God
[1:30] how do we learn the ways of God we look
[1:34] to the word
[1:35] if we want to know where God is we look
[1:38] to the word if we want to know where God
[1:41] has been
[1:42] we look to the word and we want to know
[1:45] where God is going
[1:47] we look to the word so that old dusty
[1:51] Bible sitting on the coffee table in
[1:53] your house it's time now to use it for
[1:57] more than a decoration
[1:59] it's time now to use it as a road map
[2:03] because God's holy word in printed form
[2:06] has been preserved for us as a road map
[2:10] it not only reveals to us the answer to
[2:14] every question in life
[2:16] it not only reveals to us the will of
[2:19] God for our lives but it also reveals
[2:22] the way of God Moses said I want to know
[2:27] your way
[2:29] that I may know you
[2:32] you see it's not enough to know what God
[2:35] has done
[2:36] you've got to examine what he's done to
[2:40] begin to try to discover his heart you
[2:43] may not always always know the wise
[2:46] but the more you learn about the way of
[2:49] God
[2:50] the way that God moves the way that God
[2:53] thinks the way that God functions the
[2:56] more you learn about the way of God the
[2:59] easier it becomes
[3:01] to get you into the will of God
[3:04] because you're not walking around with
[3:07] hobnailed shoes like fools
[3:11] Where Angels Fear to trod
