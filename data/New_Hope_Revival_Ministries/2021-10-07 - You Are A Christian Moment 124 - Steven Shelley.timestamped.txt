[0:15] of god however you want to say it i want
[0:16] to i want to say it in a way that people
[0:18] don't think i'm blaspheming but if a
[0:20] horse have a horse he's a horse
[0:22] the car have a car as a cow and if god
[0:25] have a son he's a god
[0:26] because i want you to understand who you
[0:29] are you're not a pushover
[0:32] you are a christian
[0:34] forget about what you used to be
[0:36] god has transformed you
[0:39] don't let the devil take your mind back
[0:42] to where you used to be because that's
[0:44] not you and if you got the holy ghost
[0:47] the bible said you are a new creature a
[0:50] new creation all things are passed away
[0:53] and behold all things have become new we
[0:55] are supernatural we we must stop being
[0:58] men and women
[1:00] thinking like men thinking like women

[1:25] because of the god that was in him
[1:27] and god knows the devil know when you

[1:32] whatever god wants you to do
[1:35] the bible said who the word came to he
[1:37] said he called them gods and the word
[1:40] cannot be broken
[1:43] hallelujah and the word has come to you
[1:47] oh what i'm trying to say is that you
[1:50] once you realize what god has made you
[1:54] you become invincible they were first
[1:56] called christians at antioch not because
[1:59] of the clothes they wear it was because
[2:01] of their behavior they act like god they
[2:03] talk like god they raise dead they heal
[2:06] the sick amen either the blind was open
[2:09] all of those things were given to the
[2:11] early christian and if we come from the
[2:13] same branch and if we are the same
[2:15] branch we must produce the same thing
[2:18] [Music]
