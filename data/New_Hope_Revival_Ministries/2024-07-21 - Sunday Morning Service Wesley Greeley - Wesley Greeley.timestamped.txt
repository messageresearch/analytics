[1:07:06] minister to them whatever the case may
[1:07:09] be I didn't receive any uh prayer
[1:07:12] requests today of of anybody that might

[1:07:17] I'm glad that you're here all of you

[1:07:30] minister to you through the word today
[1:07:32] through the presence of his anointing
[1:07:34] Galatians 3:9 so then they which be of
[1:07:39] Faith are blessed with faithful
[1:07:43] Abraham for as many as are under the
[1:07:46] works of the
[1:07:47] law are under the
[1:07:50] curse for it is written cursed is
[1:07:53] everyone that continu with not in all
[1:07:56] things which are written in the book of
[1:07:57] the law to do
[1:07:59] them but that no man is justified by the
[1:08:03] law in the sight of God it is
[1:08:06] evident
[1:08:08] for the just shall live by
[1:08:14] faith no man is deemed
[1:08:17] righteous if he tries to keep the
[1:08:20] instruction because the just shall live
[1:08:24] by faith amen verse 12 and the law is
[1:08:27] not of Faith but the man that doeth them
[1:08:31] shall live in
[1:08:33] them Christ hath redeemed us from the
[1:08:36] curse of the law being made a curse for
[1:08:43] us for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:08:47] that hangeth on a
[1:08:50] tree that The Blessing of Abraham might
[1:08:53] come on the Gentiles through through
[1:08:55] Jesus Christ that we might receive the
[1:08:59] promise of the spirit through
[1:09:02] faith Brethren I speak after the manner
[1:09:07] of men though it be but a man's Covenant
[1:09:11] yet if it be confirmed no man dis anth
[1:09:16] or addeth
[1:09:18] thereto now to Abraham and his seed were
[1:09:21] the promises made he saith not and to
[1:09:26] seeds as of many but as of one and to
[1:09:31] thy seed which is
[1:09:33] Christ and this I say that the Covenant
[1:09:36] that was confirmed before of God in
[1:09:39] Christ the law which was 430 years after
[1:09:44] cannot disol that it should make the
[1:09:47] promise of none effect for if the
[1:09:51] inheritance be of the law it is no more
[1:09:53] of promise but God gave it to Abraham by
[1:09:58] promise wherefore then serveth the law
[1:10:02] it was added because of
[1:10:05] transgressions till the seed should come
[1:10:08] to whom the promise was made and it was
[1:10:11] ordained by angels in the hand of a
[1:10:15] mediator may the Lord add a blessing to
[1:10:17] the reading of his word
[1:10:19] today you may have your seats
[1:10:40] this is going to seem maybe a bit
[1:10:43] strange but I'd like for you to turn
[1:10:44] with me to Genesis chapter 3
[1:10:55] Genesis 3 verse
[1:11:00] 1 now the serpent was more subtle than
[1:11:03] any beast of the field which the Lord
[1:11:06] God had
[1:11:07] made and he said unto the woman
[1:11:11] yay hath God said You shall not eat of
[1:11:14] every tree of the
[1:11:16] garden and the woman said unto the
[1:11:18] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:11:21] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[1:11:25] the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:11:27] garden God hath said You shall not eat
[1:11:31] of it neither shall you touch it lest
[1:11:35] you
[1:11:36] die and the serpent said to the woman
[1:11:40] you shall not surely die for God does
[1:11:44] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:11:47] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[1:11:49] shall be as God's knowing Good and Evil
[1:11:56] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:11:58] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:12:00] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:12:04] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:12:07] thereof and did eat and gave also to her
[1:12:10] husband with her and he did
[1:12:13] eat and the eyes of them both were
[1:12:16] opened and they knew that they were
[1:12:18] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[1:12:23] and made themselves a
[1:12:26] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:12:28] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:12:30] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:12:34] from the presence of the Lord God Among
[1:12:36] the Trees of the garden and the Lord God
[1:12:40] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[1:12:43] are you and he said I heard your voice
[1:12:47] in the garden and I was afraid because I
[1:12:50] was naked and I hid
[1:12:53] myself and he said who told you that you
[1:12:56] were naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[1:12:59] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:13:01] should us not eat and the man said the
[1:13:05] woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
[1:13:08] gave me of the tree and I did eat and
[1:13:13] the Lord God said unto the woman what is
[1:13:16] this that thou Hast done and the woman
[1:13:19] said the serpent beguiled me and I did
[1:13:24] eat
[1:13:27] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:13:30] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[1:13:33] cursed above all cattle and above every
[1:13:37] beast of the field upon thy belly shal
[1:13:40] thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[1:13:43] days of thy life and I will put enmity
[1:13:46] between thee and the woman and between
[1:13:49] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[1:13:52] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:13:57] I want you to take a moment to notice in
[1:13:59] verse 14 that when God cursed the
[1:14:04] serpent he said that you are cursed
[1:14:07] above all the
[1:14:09] cattle now we know by Revelation that
[1:14:13] the
[1:14:13] serpent
[1:14:15] specie was an
[1:14:18] upright
[1:14:20] being we have come to understand very
[1:14:23] close to the human yet without a
[1:14:27] soul and this upright
[1:14:32] specie was cursed above all of the
[1:14:35] beasts of the field meaning the cattle
[1:14:39] are
[1:14:40] still
[1:14:44] upright the beasts
[1:14:47] of the wild are they they go about on on
[1:14:51] four
[1:14:53] feet but this particular species was put
[1:14:57] on his belly and the Bible says that he
[1:15:01] would go upon his belly and that he
[1:15:03] would eat dust all of the days of his
[1:15:05] life that was the curse that was placed
[1:15:09] upon him a declaration of words that was
[1:15:13] placed upon him now I have often
[1:15:17] wondered myself this is a preacher
[1:15:20] wondering here I have often wondered
[1:15:24] when God
[1:15:25] cursed that particular
[1:15:28] serpent from that time obviously they
[1:15:31] were all on their belly but was all the
[1:15:33] rest of the serpent
[1:15:35] population put on their belly at that
[1:15:41] moment could be might not be I don't
[1:15:47] know
[1:15:49] just something that a preacher has
[1:15:51] thought about
[1:15:53] before and I'd like know the answer but
[1:15:56] I don't have but I know that from that
[1:15:59] moment the specie was on its belly there
[1:16:02] is no serpent speechy that's upright
[1:16:08] today all right then verse 16 unto the
[1:16:11] woman he said I will greatly multiply
[1:16:13] thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow
[1:16:17] Thou shalt bring forth children and thy
[1:16:19] desire shall be to thy husband and he
[1:16:22] shall rule over thee now this was
[1:16:27] God's plan from that moment because the
[1:16:31] woman being the weaker vessel she was
[1:16:35] given this part
[1:16:38] of even though the word curse is not
[1:16:41] used here he said I'm going to greatly
[1:16:44] multiply your sorrow and your conception
[1:16:48] in sorrow you're going to bring forth
[1:16:50] children and your desire is to be toward
[1:16:53] your husband now I know that we live in
[1:16:56] a day when women's rights is
[1:16:59] rampant and we see that even in the
[1:17:03] churches even though the scripture uh
[1:17:06] shows that a woman is not to teach or to
[1:17:09] usurp Authority we see that it is very
[1:17:13] uh much happening in the church World At
[1:17:16] Large where that ladies women are being
[1:17:19] put in as preachers as pastors and I
[1:17:23] I've watched now for several years in
[1:17:26] particular the United Methodist Church
[1:17:29] that has has most uh put in the most of
[1:17:33] the women for ministers and you have
[1:17:36] watched as that church has gone closer
[1:17:39] and closer and closer to this uh this
[1:17:44] homosexual uh perversion where that they
[1:17:47] are allowing it in every aspect so much
[1:17:51] so until the denomination split
[1:17:58] and I I really have no stones to throw
[1:18:02] I'm making an observation to say that a
[1:18:06] woman has that that more tender side to
[1:18:10] her and when she's in a place of
[1:18:12] authority there begins to be compromise
[1:18:15] because of that heartfelt nature that
[1:18:18] she has toward children and when the
[1:18:21] children begin to get off when they when
[1:18:23] they start going to their own devices
[1:18:26] the mother's uh the mother's typical
[1:18:28] nature is still to embrace and to love
[1:18:31] and that is why there should not be
[1:18:33] women in the
[1:18:40] Pulpit enough of that verse 17 and Adam
[1:18:44] said unto Adam he said because thou has
[1:18:47] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[1:18:49] has eaten of the tree of which I
[1:18:51] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[1:18:55] of
[1:18:56] it cursed is the ground for thy
[1:19:03] sake the serpent was
[1:19:08] cursed put on the ground eat dirt the
[1:19:12] rest of his
[1:19:15] life the
[1:19:17] woman was told that she would be her
[1:19:21] sorrow would be greatly multiplied
[1:19:26] and the
[1:19:28] conception would be of
[1:19:31] sorrow but to the man he
[1:19:34] said cursed is the ground for your sake
[1:19:39] in sorrow you shall eat of it all the
[1:19:41] days of your
[1:19:44] life thorns and thistles shall it bring
[1:19:47] forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
[1:19:50] herb of the field in the sweat of your
[1:19:53] face you shall eat bread till you return
[1:19:56] to the ground for out of it you were
[1:19:58] taken dust you are and to dust you will
[1:20:02] return now he told the serpent he was
[1:20:04] going to eat dust and now he's telling
[1:20:06] the man that you started out his dust I
[1:20:09] took you from the dust and you're going
[1:20:11] to go back to
[1:20:12] dust what I want you to catch from what
[1:20:16] I have just read in this scripture
[1:20:19] is the man was not
[1:20:22] cursed the seed was not
[1:20:25] cursed the ground was
[1:20:28] cursed all right so we see that the
[1:20:34] ground had a curse on it which meant
[1:20:38] that it wasn't going to bring forth as
[1:20:40] easily as it would have in time in in
[1:20:44] previous time before the curse before
[1:20:47] the fall it was not going to bring forth
[1:20:50] in the same manner of which it would
[1:20:53] have previously and so it was going to
[1:20:56] take the sweat of the brow in order for
[1:21:00] man to be able to get the crop to grow
[1:21:03] and not only that he was going to have
[1:21:05] to contend with thorns and
[1:21:09] thistles prickly
[1:21:14] things things that he did not want
[1:21:16] growing in his vegetable
[1:21:19] patch even though he SED good seed he's
[1:21:22] still having to deal with the wheed s of
[1:21:25] the thorn and the thistle all right so
[1:21:28] now I'd like for us to look at uh uh
[1:21:30] some things that when when the law came
[1:21:34] uh through Moses I want us to look in
[1:21:37] Deuteronomy chapter 27 starting with
[1:21:40] verse
[1:21:41] 14 I want us to just look at a few
[1:21:44] things how that through the law there
[1:21:47] was a
[1:21:50] curse verse 14 the Levites shall speak
[1:21:53] and say unto all all the men of Israel
[1:21:55] with a loud
[1:21:57] voice cursed be the man that maketh any
[1:22:01] Graven or molten image an Abomination
[1:22:05] unto the Lord the work of the hands of
[1:22:08] the Craftman and putteth it in a secret
[1:22:11] place and all the people shall answer
[1:22:13] and
[1:22:15] say
[1:22:16] Amen now God put in place by the law
[1:22:22] cursed be the man that that maketh a
[1:22:25] Graven or a molten image the work of the
[1:22:28] hands of a Craftsman
[1:22:31] now we can get a picture in our mind of
[1:22:36] a wooden Idol we can get a picture in
[1:22:40] our mind of a metal Idol uh we can think
[1:22:44] about the New Testament where that Paul
[1:22:47] was having to deal with the copper Smith
[1:22:49] and the silver smith and all of these on
[1:22:53] Mars Hill was having to deal with these
[1:22:56] that we're building them with our hands
[1:22:58] but I want us to also think about the
[1:23:01] the Abominations that we have built in
[1:23:04] our own
[1:23:07] mind there have been periods in our life
[1:23:10] where we have not gone in our secret uh
[1:23:13] room and had this wooden object that we
[1:23:16] started focusing our attention on but we
[1:23:19] have had Abominations in our head we
[1:23:22] have had we have had a a a a work of the
[1:23:26] hands of a
[1:23:27] Craftsman we crafted
[1:23:31] it we were the ones that put it all
[1:23:34] together by the will of our
[1:23:37] imagination by our reasonings by
[1:23:40] whatever Avenue it got there but we had
[1:23:44] to tear it
[1:23:49] down secret
[1:23:51] place I can't tell what's in your head
[1:23:54] and you can't tell what's in mine but we
[1:23:57] have built through our lives some
[1:23:59] abominable things so we don't want to
[1:24:02] just put this all on the people that had
[1:24:04] a wooden object that they were looking
[1:24:06] at verse 16 cursed be he that sth light
[1:24:10] by his father and mother and all the
[1:24:12] people shall
[1:24:14] say all right we we got to be careful
[1:24:17] that we honor our father and mother no
[1:24:19] matter how unruly they are no matter how
[1:24:22] awful they are no matter what they are
[1:24:25] we can find something to honor them
[1:24:28] with verse 17 cursed be he that removeth
[1:24:33] his neighbor's landmark and all of the
[1:24:36] people shall say
[1:24:40] Amen let's just put it in modern terms
[1:24:43] because we're not living in in now we we
[1:24:46] have property
[1:24:47] markers and and you can try your hand at
[1:24:51] going and trying to remove property
[1:24:53] markers if you wish
[1:24:55] to but somewhere in a government
[1:24:58] Courthouse there are some layout lines
[1:25:02] and pins that that even if you remove
[1:25:05] them there are uh um surveyors that have
[1:25:10] the ability to get those pins back in
[1:25:13] their rightful place there are many of
[1:25:16] people who have thought that they own
[1:25:19] property because that the line had been
[1:25:21] moved but a new survey revealed that
[1:25:24] that really wasn't so and so this is a
[1:25:28] case in the natural of removing a
[1:25:31] neighbor's Landmark but let's get it a
[1:25:33] little more detailed into
[1:25:36] terminology uh in in the spirit because
[1:25:39] there are people who have a tendency
[1:25:43] that when you start making a move toward
[1:25:46] God and you put down your marker you put
[1:25:50] down by the promise of God you put down
[1:25:53] your landmark marks there's always
[1:25:55] somebody that wants to come and yank
[1:25:58] that Landmark up they want to take it up
[1:26:01] and say the days of Miracles are passed
[1:26:04] you don't need shouting and speaking in
[1:26:06] tongues you don't need all the gifts of
[1:26:09] the Spirit we're in a new day but that's
[1:26:11] somebody that's removing the neighbor's
[1:26:15] landmarks if that's the landmark you
[1:26:17] want for yourself you go right ahead and
[1:26:20] put that Landmark down but as for me in
[1:26:23] my house we will will serve the Lord and
[1:26:25] I have put down some landmarks that need
[1:26:28] to stay in place and if the Holy Ghost
[1:26:31] comes and says that you're you're not
[1:26:34] dreaming big enough you're not putting
[1:26:36] big enough landmarks in place and he
[1:26:39] says he says to enlarge your borders
[1:26:42] then by the Holy Ghost we'll pull up the
[1:26:44] landmark and we'll make the property
[1:26:47] bigger but if if somebody comes along
[1:26:50] usually they're not trying to make it
[1:26:52] bigger usually they're trying to make it
[1:26:54] smaller they're trying to make it less
[1:26:57] for you but cursed be he that removeth
[1:27:00] his neighbor's landmarks and all the
[1:27:02] people shall
[1:27:04] say cursed be he that maketh the blind
[1:27:07] to wonderer out of the
[1:27:11] way and all the people shall
[1:27:14] say
[1:27:15] Amen now we can you we can again we can
[1:27:19] this was no doubt for the naturally
[1:27:23] somebody that could not see with their
[1:27:25] eyes but friends I tell you there are a
[1:27:27] lot of people that are blinded
[1:27:31] spiritually and if we at all try to lead
[1:27:37] them astray because they are blind or if
[1:27:40] we even say it ain't even for them now
[1:27:44] are we causing them to wander out of the
[1:27:47] way what we really need to be doing is
[1:27:50] shining the light of the Gospel in their
[1:27:53] path Shining the light out of us letting
[1:27:56] the light that is in us the let it
[1:27:58] coming up and out of us until that it
[1:28:00] lights their path until their spiritual
[1:28:03] blindness can be done away with and they
[1:28:06] can find their way into the goodness of
[1:28:09] God and all the people shall
[1:28:12] say Amen cursed be he that perverteth
[1:28:15] the Judgment of the stranger the
[1:28:18] fatherless and the Widow and all the
[1:28:21] people shall say amen I think we have
[1:28:24] talked before about how that we have a
[1:28:27] we have a uh a responsibility even in
[1:28:30] the New
[1:28:31] Testament to take care of the fatherless
[1:28:34] and the Widow and that we should be on
[1:28:38] their side and not pervert the Judgment
[1:28:40] that might be against them but be able
[1:28:42] to help them along the way verse 20
[1:28:46] cursed be he that lith with his father's
[1:28:48] wife because he uncover his father's
[1:28:52] skirt and all the people people shall
[1:28:56] say cursed be he that lith with any
[1:28:59] manner of Beast and all the people shall
[1:29:11] say I don't
[1:29:15] understand I don't get
[1:29:18] it but it is an increased mentality in
[1:29:22] 2024
[1:29:26] because why why would that even be why
[1:29:28] would it even be it's because that
[1:29:31] people have turned God down so much till
[1:29:35] the Bible says that they're turned over
[1:29:37] to a reprobate mind and when you have a
[1:29:41] reprobate mind you do things that you
[1:29:43] never thought you would do in a million
[1:29:46] years but because that the enemy is on a
[1:29:50] rampage and he's causing young people to
[1:29:54] to drink and to smoke and to take drugs
[1:29:57] and it Alters their mind they begin to
[1:30:00] do things and and and and the the
[1:30:02] natural desire of a man is changed and
[1:30:06] rather than wanting to be with a woman
[1:30:09] he wants to be with it this is this is
[1:30:11] this is stuff that we maybe shouldn't
[1:30:14] even talk about in a mixed crowd but I
[1:30:16] tell you God still has this uh curse in
[1:30:20] place all of these things really are
[1:30:23] still in place
[1:30:25] friends sir we'll get to the rest of the
[1:30:28] story in the moment I'm trying to lay
[1:30:30] something out here for you cursed be he
[1:30:32] that lith with any man or beast verse 22
[1:30:35] cursed be he that lith with his
[1:30:39] sister the daughter of his father or the
[1:30:44] daughter of his mother and all the
[1:30:47] people shall
[1:30:50] say will you forgive me if I add to the
[1:30:56] word because I think that we could go
[1:30:59] even further with a daddy and his
[1:31:02] daughters or a mother and her sons or
[1:31:04] any of that kind of
[1:31:07] nonsense
[1:31:10] pedophilia verse 23 cursed be he that
[1:31:13] lith with his
[1:31:15] mother-in-law and all the people shall
[1:31:18] say cursed be he that smiteth his
[1:31:21] neighbor secretly and all the people
[1:31:24] shall
[1:31:26] say cursed be he that taketh reward to
[1:31:30] slay an innocent person and all the
[1:31:33] people shall say
[1:31:39] am you know we we are kind of
[1:31:42] sheltered in the fact that we don't
[1:31:45] really see this kind of thing taking
[1:31:48] place but there
[1:31:51] is still
[1:31:54] Mafia type
[1:31:56] people that do this kind of thing when
[1:32:02] there is somebody standing in the way in
[1:32:05] this dog eat dog world where that they
[1:32:08] slay with slay they would take money to
[1:32:11] slay an innocent person to get to a
[1:32:14] place of Authority or power because that
[1:32:18] that P that other person is in the way
[1:32:21] they might would pay money uh it it no
[1:32:24] doubt happens in politics it no doubt
[1:32:26] happens in the political world it no h
[1:32:29] no doubt happens in the drug culture and
[1:32:32] it happens all around the world but the
[1:32:35] Lord is put it in the law cursed be he
[1:32:38] that taketh reward to slay an innocent
[1:32:41] person and all the people shall say Amen
[1:32:44] cursed be he that confir not all the
[1:32:48] words of this law to do them so if you
[1:32:55] you would not partake in any of those
[1:32:59] things that I've just
[1:33:01] read but yet you would refuse to confirm
[1:33:05] the words of the
[1:33:07] law with an
[1:33:09] amen then you're cursed
[1:33:13] too so that means that people that say
[1:33:17] I'm just going to lay out a church I'm
[1:33:19] just going to you know kind of remain
[1:33:21] neutral at the work
[1:33:26] you got to take one side or the other
[1:33:28] either you're going to be part of the
[1:33:29] cursed crowd or you're going to be part
[1:33:31] of the bless crowd that's just who he is
[1:33:36] because God is as as brother Shelly was
[1:33:38] preaching God is not a
[1:33:41] mixer he is a
[1:33:44] separator and he is the one that brings
[1:33:46] separation into our life and he doesn't
[1:33:49] want us to have all of this mixture in
[1:33:52] it he wants us to be separated unto
[1:33:54] himself Deuteronomy 21: 22 and 23 if a
[1:34:00] man have committed a sin worthy of death
[1:34:03] any of these
[1:34:05] things that we've just
[1:34:08] read if if if a man's committed a sin
[1:34:11] worthy of death and he be put to death
[1:34:14] and thou hang him on a tree his body
[1:34:16] shall not remain all night upon the tree
[1:34:19] but Thou shalt in any wise bury him that
[1:34:22] day for he that is tanged is a cursed of
[1:34:25] God that thy land be not defiled which
[1:34:29] the Lord thy God giveth for an
[1:34:32] inheritance so all of us as long as the
[1:34:36] law was in place all of us if we
[1:34:40] trespassed on any of these things we
[1:34:43] were
[1:34:47] cursed and friends we might would like
[1:34:51] to think that we could overcome every
[1:34:55] bit of that in our own will and our own
[1:34:58] strength living under the
[1:35:00] law and there were men and women that
[1:35:04] aspired to that they they reached for it
[1:35:08] but they found themselves no doubt of
[1:35:10] failing in one place or another because
[1:35:14] it was the law it was the law that was
[1:35:18] put down because men had God knew that
[1:35:22] men would trespass
[1:35:27] pass he knew every one of us would
[1:35:32] trespass from the Garden of Eden when
[1:35:34] the first man and woman trespassed when
[1:35:38] they fell uh because of a beguiling
[1:35:42] spirit because of a spirit that came and
[1:35:46] and seduced them into doing things now
[1:35:50] the Bible said that that the woman was
[1:35:52] the one that was seduced she was the one
[1:35:54] that was deceived Adam was not deceived
[1:35:57] he partook willingly to cover his wife
[1:36:01] this is of course the picture of the
[1:36:04] Lord Jesus Christ who took on him the
[1:36:07] sins of us
[1:36:09] all because he knew that we the weaker
[1:36:14] vessel the woman the bride the woman she
[1:36:18] was the weaker vessel and she would be
[1:36:21] the one who would fall
[1:36:24] he was not going to
[1:36:27] fall but he knew that we were going to
[1:36:31] fall but he had a predestinated will for
[1:36:35] our lives now if you are sitting here or
[1:36:38] out across the camera uh I don't see how
[1:36:42] that you can read the New Testament and
[1:36:44] and not uh uh see that he has a
[1:36:47] predestinated will by his forn knowledge
[1:36:51] and and the more that I go along
[1:36:54] uh you know it's it's it's it's like the
[1:36:57] brother said last night was he was
[1:36:59] giving his testimony you know God he he
[1:37:04] said we had to have faith and he knew I
[1:37:06] couldn't get enough and so he gave it to
[1:37:15] me he said without faith it is
[1:37:18] impossible to please God and I can't
[1:37:21] muster up none on my own but the the
[1:37:23] Bible said to every man is given a
[1:37:25] Measure of Faith I didn't give it to you
[1:37:28] your preachers didn't give it to you God
[1:37:31] is the only one that can give you that
[1:37:32] Measure of Faith but he's the one that
[1:37:35] said you had to have it to start with so
[1:37:37] he made a way for you to have
[1:37:39] it and he knew that you couldn't
[1:37:42] overcome the curse by yourself so he in
[1:37:45] his beautiful
[1:37:49] Plan before you ever got here
[1:37:54] he had a plan in place because he didn't
[1:37:58] want you to live under the curse of the
[1:38:00] law he didn't want you to live under the
[1:38:04] weight of the
[1:38:07] law the law is
[1:38:10] weighty it holds us down to a point
[1:38:15] where that we feel like that we can
[1:38:21] move lest you should misunderstand
[1:38:26] me God has a
[1:38:30] law a law that is still in place
[1:38:37] today we do not do away with the Old
[1:38:43] Testament we believe what he said in the
[1:38:46] Old Testament in the old Covenant and
[1:38:49] that he brought it forward and made it
[1:38:52] more clear to us in the newer Covenant
[1:38:55] and in some places made it even heavier
[1:38:57] than it was
[1:39:00] before yet he understood that the blood
[1:39:04] of bulls and goats could never take the
[1:39:08] guilt and the
[1:39:09] condemnation away from the people it
[1:39:12] could never lift that heavy burden off
[1:39:14] of them so he already had this plan in
[1:39:20] place because of the law where he said
[1:39:23] any man that hangs on a tree is a curse
[1:39:26] and yet he came and he took on him the
[1:39:30] iniquity of us all all of your sin all
[1:39:35] of your shame past present and future
[1:39:39] every bit of it he took it upon himself
[1:39:43] that day at Calvary as he was walking
[1:39:46] toward Calvary as he started his Earthly
[1:39:50] Ministry he was taken on him he was
[1:39:53] seeing the sin that was around
[1:39:58] him the degraded mindset of the
[1:40:03] people he saw it everywhere he
[1:40:10] went and he spoke the word of Truth
[1:40:15] wherever he
[1:40:17] went and he spoke it with such
[1:40:21] conviction that men hated him for
[1:40:24] it because and then the men that hated
[1:40:28] him the most were the religious men men
[1:40:32] that had been trying to live under the
[1:40:35] weight of the law for years and years
[1:40:38] they lived under that weight and they
[1:40:41] just were trying to put it on the
[1:40:47] people but not living it
[1:40:51] themselves and as with
[1:40:54] men they decided that the law of God was
[1:40:57] not enough they had to build some
[1:41:01] fences and they began expanding the law
[1:41:05] and Jesus called them
[1:41:08] Traditions not all Traditions are wrong
[1:41:12] but Jesus said because of your
[1:41:15] Traditions you have made men to
[1:41:19] trespass because of your Traditions you
[1:41:22] have made men do things that they didn't
[1:41:25] have to
[1:41:26] do and Jesus began preaching to them but
[1:41:31] all of the while he's taking on the
[1:41:33] weight on the weight of this sinful
[1:41:36] world as he's going toward the cross he
[1:41:39] knows the
[1:41:42] end but he's still day by day laying
[1:41:45] down his will to in order to get to the
[1:41:49] finality of it the cross
[1:41:53] the execution
[1:41:55] stake the place where that he would end
[1:41:58] all of your
[1:42:00] pain all of your suffering all of your
[1:42:04] shame all of your
[1:42:06] condemnation all of your guilt well
[1:42:09] brother I feel awful guilty today how
[1:42:11] how do you figure that he ended it
[1:42:16] all either you believe the word or you
[1:42:21] don't then you might ask me have you
[1:42:24] never felt guilty oh yes I have felt
[1:42:27] guilty I have felt condemnation I have
[1:42:30] felt I have felt pain I have felt I've
[1:42:33] I've experienced all of the things we
[1:42:35] just talked about but when he went to
[1:42:39] the
[1:42:40] Cross when he hung on the execution
[1:42:44] stake he did it for me and he did it for
[1:42:48] you so that I did not have to live under
[1:42:52] the curse of the
[1:42:55] law here's our
[1:42:59] issue even after we come to the
[1:43:03] knowledge of the truth even after we say
[1:43:07] Lord I I need you to forgive me of all
[1:43:11] of my
[1:43:15] sins I have sinned against you I've
[1:43:20] sinned against your people and I'm
[1:43:22] asking continue to forgive me and we
[1:43:26] have to come with a repentant heart
[1:43:28] toward
[1:43:30] him we
[1:43:38] must but when we after we have accepted
[1:43:44] him as our Lord and our savior remember
[1:43:48] he took the curse away
[1:43:54] he took the curse
[1:43:57] away he reversed the
[1:44:03] curse sometimes this is hard for us to
[1:44:05] get our minds around because we still
[1:44:07] see so much
[1:44:10] curse we still see people that are
[1:44:13] trespassing the law of God
[1:44:17] and we at times still do foolish things
[1:44:23] things that go against the knowledge of
[1:44:27] God against his goodness in our lives
[1:44:30] and we create again we create
[1:44:32] Abominations up
[1:44:38] here in secret places we create these
[1:44:44] Abominations and it's not God's
[1:44:48] fault the curse has already been lifted
[1:44:52] right
[1:44:53] through what he did at
[1:44:58] Calvary now you remember when when when
[1:45:01] God came to the man and the woman in the
[1:45:05] garden he told Adam the man he said the
[1:45:10] ground is
[1:45:13] cursed the seed wasn't cursed the ground
[1:45:17] was
[1:45:21] cursed the thorns and the thistles were
[1:45:25] seed they were what they were from the
[1:45:29] beginning the maple tree was a seed but
[1:45:33] it was what it was from the beginning an
[1:45:35] apple tree a piece of cor a cornstalk a
[1:45:39] wheat stalk all of it was the seed there
[1:45:41] was nothing wrong with the
[1:45:44] seed but the ground was
[1:45:49] cursed the Bible tells us in Matthew
[1:45:52] chapter 13
[1:45:53] that the word of God is a
[1:46:01] seed and when the seed of the word of
[1:46:04] God comes to
[1:46:06] us it is coming to a fleshly body that
[1:46:11] must go back to the
[1:46:14] dirt and it is dealing with the spirit
[1:46:18] the soul and the
[1:46:21] body there's nothing wrong with the
[1:46:28] seed and I may have preachers to
[1:46:31] disagree with
[1:46:33] me yet I'm going to say that the problem
[1:46:37] is the
[1:46:43] ground the problem is the ground because
[1:46:46] I don't know about you but my soul is
[1:46:49] still being uh it's the by the blood of
[1:46:53] Jesus Christ by the power of the work at
[1:46:56] the cross of Calvary my my ground the
[1:47:00] curse is being
[1:47:03] reversed it is being reversed because of
[1:47:07] Calvary because of the power of the work
[1:47:11] on the execution
[1:47:14] stake he's not finished with me
[1:47:17] yet so here I am 54 years old and and
[1:47:22] been been saved now for 35 years and and
[1:47:26] pressing into the goodness of God and
[1:47:29] it's not the seed's
[1:47:31] fault it's not the problem of the
[1:47:34] seed somewhere along the
[1:47:39] way there's been
[1:47:44] poison
[1:47:48] poison you know all of my life I've
[1:47:50] heard about the the the tragedy
[1:47:54] of the soldiers that went to Vietnam and
[1:47:57] the the the the atrocities that they
[1:48:01] dealt with and and how they came back
[1:48:03] with uh all kinds of ailments and they
[1:48:07] didn't know what to do with them and
[1:48:09] then they started talking about this
[1:48:10] agent orange and this agent orange was
[1:48:14] used this poison they would spray all of
[1:48:17] the foliage because the I believe it was
[1:48:20] the Viet Kong that were hiding in the in
[1:48:23] the foliage and so they sprayed all of
[1:48:26] the foliage to try to expose
[1:48:30] them and it killed everything in
[1:48:38] sight and it
[1:48:40] caused there to be a reaction in
[1:48:45] physical bodies
[1:48:46] both Vietnamese and our our guys as
[1:48:51] well now St comes with his
[1:48:56] poison and just because that you got
[1:48:59] saved the enemy didn't quit shooting his
[1:49:04] poison and just because you got saved
[1:49:08] and you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:10] Ghost it doesn't mean that all of the
[1:49:12] ground was 100% ready for seed because
[1:49:18] you know as well as I know that we have
[1:49:21] spit some things out before before we
[1:49:24] have refused the seed because the ground
[1:49:27] was a little bit corrupt it was cursed
[1:49:30] there was there was still some levels of
[1:49:32] the curse that was there but I'm here to
[1:49:35] tell you today that the blood of Jesus
[1:49:38] Christ the cross of Calvary the work at
[1:49:41] the cross of Jesus Christ revers The
[1:49:45] Curse
[1:49:53] we've heard the
[1:49:55] phrase
[1:49:57] salvation is
[1:49:59] free it
[1:50:02] is but to live for Christ will cost you
[1:50:11] everything
[1:50:14] everything and I find myself the older I
[1:50:18] get and the closer that I get to him and
[1:50:21] the more of the word of God that I hear
[1:50:24] I find myself saying Lord I give you
[1:50:28] everything because I realize that there
[1:50:30] was something that I held back yesterday
[1:50:33] and something that I held back the day
[1:50:35] before and he doesn't even always reveal
[1:50:38] what it is he doesn't reveal it always
[1:50:41] but I realize that I held something back
[1:50:44] and that I'm still struggling with the
[1:50:47] the curse that's on the ground I'm still
[1:50:49] struggling with that curse because I'm
[1:50:51] not agree being with
[1:50:56] him I find myself in an atmosphere with
[1:50:59] you and I find that I could agree with
[1:51:01] him on
[1:51:02] everything I get out from under the
[1:51:05] atmosphere and I go out in life and I
[1:51:08] find that there are things that have
[1:51:10] pools that have pools that have pulls
[1:51:12] because the ground is still cursed and
[1:51:15] I'm not agreeing with him that the curse
[1:51:18] is
[1:51:21] reversed still deal dealing with the
[1:51:23] mind the will and the
[1:51:28] emotion he paid the price
[1:51:32] friends he did it all at
[1:51:34] Calvary he paid the price so that you
[1:51:37] could overcome smoking so that you could
[1:51:39] overcome drinking so that you could
[1:51:41] overcome drug addiction so that you
[1:51:43] could overcome beastiality so that you
[1:51:46] could overcome homosexuality so that you
[1:51:48] could overcome pedophilia so that you
[1:51:50] could overcome pornography so that you
[1:51:53] could overcome the lust of the Flesh and
[1:51:55] the lust of the eye and overcome the
[1:51:57] pride of life he went to Calvary and he
[1:52:00] overcame all of
[1:52:02] it he did there is no question about it
[1:52:06] in my mind today he overcame all of it
[1:52:10] and the Bible said that he was tempted
[1:52:12] in all manner as we are so somewhere
[1:52:14] along the
[1:52:16] way he had to deal with all of it
[1:52:22] for what kind of period of time I don't
[1:52:25] know how long his temptation was I don't
[1:52:27] know but this one thing I know when he
[1:52:30] got to Calvary when he when he was
[1:52:33] hanging on calvary's cross and he said
[1:52:36] it is finished on him was every sin
[1:52:40] every shame every iniquity every
[1:52:43] backsliding condition every bit of it
[1:52:46] was hanging on
[1:52:50] him and he said it is fath
[1:52:54] finished and he
[1:52:59] died now had that been the end of
[1:53:03] it it would not have helped
[1:53:09] us but the Bible tells
[1:53:12] us that he descended into the lower
[1:53:14] parts of the earth and that he led
[1:53:17] captivity captive and gave gifts to men
[1:53:19] and what was that gift that he gave unto
[1:53:21] men all of those that were previous to
[1:53:23] the cross of Calvary those that had
[1:53:26] lived under the law the best they knew
[1:53:28] how and they kept Covenant with almighty
[1:53:30] God they reive the same salvation that
[1:53:33] you and I receive but that that wasn't
[1:53:36] the all of it all of that curse all of
[1:53:38] that sin all of that iniquity all of the
[1:53:40] shame all of the guilt and the
[1:53:42] condemnation the stuff the stuff that we
[1:53:45] carry around today that weights us down
[1:53:48] so much friends he took it back to hell
[1:53:51] where it belong
[1:53:55] bels he did not take it back to the
[1:53:57] Heavenly portals of Glory with him he
[1:54:01] descended first and he took all of the
[1:54:03] weight of everything that you've ever
[1:54:05] carried or ever will carry and he took
[1:54:07] it back to hell where it belongs and he
[1:54:10] put it back on the
[1:54:14] devil and he took the keys of death hell
[1:54:19] and the
[1:54:21] grave all of
[1:54:23] it he took the keys so that means that
[1:54:29] the devil does not really have authority
[1:54:32] in your
[1:54:35] life he only has Authority by what I
[1:54:39] give
[1:54:40] him that's how he plays around in our
[1:54:43] lives that how that's how he gets us
[1:54:45] messed up in our
[1:54:47] mind that's how he causes us to build
[1:54:51] abom ations in our
[1:54:54] mind Idols in our
[1:55:01] mind because we've agreed with
[1:55:04] him we have agreed with him that our
[1:55:07] ground is still
[1:55:09] cursed we have agreed with him that
[1:55:12] we're still walking under a curse but
[1:55:15] the Lord Jesus came to reverse the
[1:55:20] curse and because I am a predestinated
[1:55:24] believer in the end time I have the
[1:55:27] authority as well to reverse that curse
[1:55:31] in my life and you have the ability to
[1:55:35] reverse the curse in your
[1:55:38] life but you and I and anybody else has
[1:55:42] to agree with the word you we have to
[1:55:45] agree with the fact that the curse has
[1:55:48] been
[1:55:49] reversed and that the way that has been
[1:55:53] protected by the
[1:55:55] sword in the garden the way to the tree
[1:55:58] of life that has been protected by the
[1:56:01] Flaming sword that same sword is now
[1:56:05] driving us to the tree of life because
[1:56:08] the curse has been lifted off of
[1:56:15] us the
[1:56:17] curse is reversed
[1:56:22] yet we
[1:56:25] agree with the
[1:56:28] curse the
[1:56:30] Declaration that is put over
[1:56:36] us the curse of the law is a prayer or a
[1:56:42] declaration for injury for harm or for
[1:56:48] Misfortune and if the law is what you're
[1:56:51] going to follow the law you're going to
[1:56:54] have to pray pay the price of the
[1:56:58] law anybody that wants to walk under the
[1:57:01] law of the old
[1:57:04] Covenant don't misunderstand
[1:57:08] me if you want to walk under the law of
[1:57:10] the old Covenant without the blood of
[1:57:12] Jesus
[1:57:13] Christ there is a
[1:57:17] declaration or a prayer for your injury
[1:57:21] for your harm or for your Misfortune if
[1:57:24] you
[1:57:26] trespass we read all of the
[1:57:29] curses if you do this you're cursed if
[1:57:32] you do this you're cursed if you do this
[1:57:34] all of that curse has already been
[1:57:37] declared that there is a if if you do
[1:57:40] the deed you get the
[1:57:43] curse but when Calvary
[1:57:46] happened we know by the word that the
[1:57:49] lamb was slain from before the
[1:57:50] foundation of the world
[1:57:54] and all of those that were under the
[1:58:00] law I believe that by the forn knowledge
[1:58:03] of God he knew all of those that would
[1:58:06] follow the
[1:58:08] law as well as those that would be
[1:58:10] mixers and those that would go their own
[1:58:12] way and those that would you
[1:58:18] know it reminds me
[1:58:22] as I was listening to the brother's
[1:58:25] testimony last night there where we
[1:58:28] were he talked about the hold
[1:58:32] that drugs and
[1:58:36] alcohol and rock music had on his
[1:58:42] life and the law
[1:58:46] said that if a child was
[1:58:50] disobedient and would not
[1:58:54] walk in a way that was right that he was
[1:58:56] to be
[1:59:02] Stone but under the New Covenant there's
[1:59:06] Grace under the newer Covenant and under
[1:59:09] the revelation of this message that we
[1:59:11] have in the end time we have been told
[1:59:14] to hold the token over our
[1:59:16] families we've been told to hold the
[1:59:18] token over what does that look like what
[1:59:20] does holding the token over over them
[1:59:23] well the first thing that we got to do
[1:59:24] is we got to pray for
[1:59:27] them and we've got to live holy and
[1:59:31] godly in front of them for them to have
[1:59:35] something to Aspire
[1:59:39] to so if you live like the devil in your
[1:59:42] house and expect your children to do
[1:59:44] better that ain't really fair to
[1:59:48] them you're not training them
[1:59:54] I don't care if you tell them this is
[1:59:56] what the Bible said that's not training
[2:00:03] them if you tell them not to smoke pot
[2:00:07] but here you are smoking
[2:00:10] it that is not training
[2:00:13] them if you tell them not to watch
[2:00:16] pornography but yet you're doing it that
[2:00:18] is not training them
[2:00:22] training them is living it in front of
[2:00:25] them and explaining from the scripture
[2:00:29] why we do what we do why we live like we
[2:00:31] live explain and getting them an
[2:00:34] atmosphere where that they can also be
[2:00:36] trained by the preaching of the word
[2:00:39] it's not all of the preachers job to
[2:00:41] train your
[2:00:43] children God gave you your children for
[2:00:46] you to train he gave me mine for mine to
[2:00:49] me to train and my wife
[2:00:54] and we all fail miserably at times yet
[2:00:57] we continue to press forward to try to
[2:01:00] train our children in the way that they
[2:01:03] should go so that when they're older
[2:01:06] they will not depart from it and we pray
[2:01:08] by God's grace that they never go out
[2:01:11] and experience anything of this
[2:01:17] world then people get this mentality
[2:01:21] well they got to have a battle sometime
[2:01:23] I promise
[2:01:25] you I promise they're going to have
[2:01:32] battles you want me to put it in planer
[2:01:35] terms what is the phrase that we always
[2:01:37] say Church hurt is the worst
[2:01:40] hurt and if they're part of a body
[2:01:43] they're going to experience some things
[2:01:45] along the way because it's part of it's
[2:01:47] part of iron sharpening iron
[2:01:55] my
[2:01:56] wife tells me you tell the people that
[2:02:01] you pass one test and the next one's
[2:02:03] harder she said it's not exactly that
[2:02:06] way you pass a test because you're going
[2:02:09] to take all that you've learned from the
[2:02:13] past and you're going to be able to take
[2:02:15] that knowledge that understanding that
[2:02:18] overcoming and you're going to be able
[2:02:19] to step into the next test so that e
[2:02:22] even though it may seem like that there
[2:02:25] there's there's things in there that
[2:02:27] you've not yet experienced but what you
[2:02:29] have accumulated from the past is going
[2:02:31] to give you the grace and the strength
[2:02:33] and the courage to say I've got this one
[2:02:35] there may be a couple little problems
[2:02:37] that I I've got to figure out I've got
[2:02:40] to I've got to have some understanding
[2:02:42] but I'm going to take what I've learned
[2:02:43] from the past I'm going to bring it up
[2:02:45] to this test and I'm going to be able to
[2:02:47] figure out these problems too because
[2:02:49] all of that overcoming I've done in the
[2:02:51] past is only helping me that I can
[2:02:54] overcome
[2:02:55] now I'm going to pass the
[2:02:58] test because Jesus passed the test and
[2:03:02] Jesus lives in me but I would now here's
[2:03:05] the problem that I have because that I
[2:03:08] I've already said that we we have this
[2:03:11] problem because the ground is cursed but
[2:03:13] the curse has been reversed
[2:03:23] there a hang on a
[2:03:28] minute as many as are led by the spirit
[2:03:31] of God they are the sons of God there's
[2:03:35] a scripture that I'm trying to grasp
[2:03:37] that that
[2:03:39] that
[2:03:45] uh to them gave he the power to become
[2:03:51] the sons of
[2:04:03] God but as many as received him to them
[2:04:08] gave he power to become the sons of God
[2:04:11] even to them that believe on his name
[2:04:15] which were born not of blood nor of the
[2:04:18] will of Flesh nor of the will of man but
[2:04:21] of God so as many as received him that's
[2:04:26] you that's me we received him we
[2:04:29] received him into our lives and as we
[2:04:32] received him we he gave us the power to
[2:04:35] become the sons of God and we're not
[2:04:38] earning our way into becoming sons of
[2:04:41] God because on over in the Scripture it
[2:04:44] tells us that that to them he did for
[2:04:49] no he did also predi
[2:04:53] destinate them to be conformed into the
[2:04:56] image of his own Dear Son and the the
[2:05:00] image of his own dear son was that his
[2:05:03] son went all the way to Calvary and
[2:05:06] although the curse was laid upon him he
[2:05:09] gave up his own will and he took that
[2:05:12] curse to hell and there he left it and
[2:05:15] he ascended to the right hand of the
[2:05:17] father and because that he accomplished
[2:05:20] all of that he has Mercy On The Mercy
[2:05:23] Seat the blood is still on the mercy
[2:05:25] seat and I am partaking of that blood I
[2:05:29] am partaking of the power of that blood
[2:05:31] I am partaking of that because I hear
[2:05:34] him say to as many as received him to
[2:05:38] them gave he the power to become the
[2:05:40] sons of God what do sons of God do do
[2:05:42] they meddle around in the law do they
[2:05:44] build Abominations do they continue to
[2:05:47] agree with the cursed ground no sons of
[2:05:49] God those that are sons of God they
[2:05:52] agree with what has already been done
[2:05:54] the curse that has been reversed the
[2:05:57] curse has already been taken on to
[2:06:00] Christ he took the
[2:06:03] curse and the curse he took with him to
[2:06:12] Hell the Earth still has its curse on it
[2:06:16] the Natural Earth still has its curse on
[2:06:18] it
[2:06:22] this still has its curse on
[2:06:31] it if you disagree with
[2:06:36] that I just like
[2:06:38] to say that I hope you have some death
[2:06:44] insurance place
[2:06:46] somewhere because the curse on this is
[2:06:49] still here
[2:06:52] but this
[2:06:54] curse that has been on the minds the
[2:06:58] wills and the emotions of people through
[2:07:02] ages and
[2:07:04] generations the Lord Jesus took that
[2:07:07] curse to
[2:07:09] hell and he left it
[2:07:13] there yet we find ourselves agreeing
[2:07:17] with that curse
[2:07:21] friend you don't have
[2:07:23] to you don't have to agree with that
[2:07:29] curse
[2:07:32] for your emotions that get so out of
[2:07:38] balance for your
[2:07:40] personality that is so
[2:07:47] sharp or jokester
[2:07:51] always
[2:07:54] jesting you don't have to agree with
[2:07:57] it just because you're daddy was and
[2:08:01] your daddy your granddaddy was and his
[2:08:04] dad was you don't have to agree with
[2:08:09] it you don't have to carry the
[2:08:12] personality of another
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:16] generation if if it is
[2:08:19] unkind if it is OB obnoxious you don't
[2:08:23] have to carry
[2:08:25] it because the curse was taken to Hell
[2:08:29] the curse has been reversed and he wants
[2:08:32] us to agree with him now don't get
[2:08:36] yourself all out of shape with me saying
[2:08:39] that when I say the curse is reversed if
[2:08:43] Jesus Took The
[2:08:47] Curse I'm still dealing with
[2:08:50] it because I don't totally agree with
[2:08:53] him you
[2:08:55] don't why would you say such a thing
[2:09:02] preacher you don't
[2:09:07] either you don't
[2:09:10] either oh yes preacher I agree with the
[2:09:13] Lord till somebody makes you mad
[2:09:21] somebody runs you off the
[2:09:30] road till you find out your child has
[2:09:32] dabbled in something that you know they
[2:09:41] shouldn't
[2:09:43] yet it is finished
[2:09:53] our
[2:09:54] ground that was
[2:09:58] cursed is only
[2:10:01] cursed if we curse
[2:10:03] it now what is a
[2:10:05] curse a prayer of Declaration or or a
[2:10:09] declaration for injury harm or
[2:10:16] Misfortune now all I'm saying is what
[2:10:20] has already been said
[2:10:22] said the words of our
[2:10:27] mouth were either blessing or
[2:10:32] cursing and the
[2:10:35] seed is not
[2:10:40] cursed and the ground doesn't have to
[2:10:45] be because Jesus Took the curse to hell
[2:10:49] and left it there
[2:10:53] so we
[2:10:54] continue
[2:10:57] cultivating picking up
[2:11:05] rocks better ever picked up rocks out of
[2:11:08] a
[2:11:10] field one of the worst jobs I remember
[2:11:14] as a young person when the
[2:11:18] neighbors would plow the field and then
[2:11:20] disc the
[2:11:24] field and then they would say will you
[2:11:27] help me to pick up
[2:11:31] rocks and every year there were rocks to
[2:11:34] pick up even though the field had
[2:11:36] previously been plowed and disced and
[2:11:38] planted if it got plowed and disced and
[2:11:41] planted the Rocks came up
[2:11:43] again I'm amazed at the farming
[2:11:46] techniques used today there's no plowing
[2:11:48] there's no discing that none of that
[2:11:51] they cut a crop and they plant a new one
[2:11:55] special
[2:11:56] Machinery but we would pick up rocks and
[2:12:00] we got rocks that are in the way we've
[2:12:03] allowed things and it has caused things
[2:12:06] to grow
[2:12:09] crooked we need to pick up some
[2:12:12] rocks and we need to let the word become
[2:12:15] nourishment in our in the soil of our of
[2:12:18] our minds our will our motion we need to
[2:12:20] let we need to let the word become uh uh
[2:12:24] nutrients to put uh life back in the
[2:12:28] soil and that is exactly what it has
[2:12:30] been doing yet we continue to pronounce
[2:12:35] curse we put a
[2:12:38] misfortune on
[2:12:42] ourselves we don't have
[2:12:45] to
[2:12:47] because Jesus took it all at Calvary
[2:12:52] and
[2:12:54] he gave the
[2:12:58] remedy for us to be able to walk under
[2:13:02] the blessing of
[2:13:06] heaven and when he gave the blessing in
[2:13:10] the Old
[2:13:12] Testament he had this pronounced onto
[2:13:16] the people and he told them that the the
[2:13:20] blessing shall come on you and overtake
[2:13:23] you if you shall hearken unto the voice
[2:13:26] of the Lord your
[2:13:28] God and that's what we do when we hear
[2:13:31] the word we receive it and we allow it
[2:13:34] to bring nutrients into the ground so
[2:13:37] that the seed can continue doing what it
[2:13:40] needs to do and we agree with his voice
[2:13:44] and so then he said in Deuteronomy
[2:13:46] chapter 28 starting in verse three
[2:13:49] blessed shall you be in the city and
[2:13:51] blessed shall you be in the field
[2:13:54] blessed shall you be shall be the fruit
[2:13:56] of the body and the fruit of your ground
[2:13:58] and the fruit of your cattle and the
[2:14:00] increase of your kind and the flocks of
[2:14:02] your
[2:14:04] sheep blessed shall be the basket and
[2:14:07] thy store blessed shall thou be when you
[2:14:10] come in and blessed shall you be when
[2:14:12] you go out the Lord shall cause your
[2:14:15] enemies that rise up against thee to be
[2:14:17] smitten before thy face
[2:14:21] they shall come out against thee one way
[2:14:23] and flee before thee seven
[2:14:30] ways not by you running them off the
[2:14:35] road not by you punching them in the
[2:14:39] face not by you using your voice of
[2:14:44] sarcasm
[2:14:47] no it is because that you allow the word
[2:14:51] of God to bring nutrients to
[2:14:55] you and then these seeds are planted in
[2:14:59] you and they grow with uh such fervor
[2:15:03] and you remember in the New Testament he
[2:15:04] said some of them would bring 30 fold
[2:15:07] some 60 and some H hundredfold and and
[2:15:10] that is because of the nutrition of the
[2:15:13] soil that they're planted in so he says
[2:15:16] you're going to you're if your enemy
[2:15:18] Rises up against you he's going to be
[2:15:20] smitten before your face they shall come
[2:15:22] out before thee one way and flee before
[2:15:25] the seven ways now might I remind you
[2:15:30] that we do not fight Flesh and
[2:15:39] Blood hear somebody's voice say I do
[2:15:45] well you're going to walk in the cursed
[2:15:47] ground
[2:15:51] let the Holy Ghost see friends there
[2:15:56] there's we say we receive the Holy
[2:16:01] Ghost but do you know what we
[2:16:03] need more than the Holy
[2:16:08] Ghost
[2:16:15] Blasphemous John said when he comes he's
[2:16:18] going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[2:16:20] and
[2:16:22] fire that's what some of us
[2:16:26] need we need the fire of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:30] to come and burn some things out of
[2:16:34] us to burn all the
[2:16:40] underbrush to burn some thorns and this
[2:16:44] oh I know he said let the tears grow up
[2:16:49] together but I've had some harvests
[2:16:51] along the
[2:16:52] way yes
[2:16:54] sir but I realized that I've not had the
[2:16:57] hundredfold Harvest that I really desire
[2:17:00] to have and so I need some of the Holy
[2:17:03] Ghost and Fire to come in my life and
[2:17:05] burn some things out of me that I did
[2:17:08] not know were in there I need some of
[2:17:10] the fire of God to burn out some of the
[2:17:13] tormenting spirits that have been inside
[2:17:16] of me I need the Holy Ghost in fire to
[2:17:18] burn some of the demon things out of my
[2:17:21] life that I've allowed to remain there
[2:17:24] and I kept pronouncing the curse over it
[2:17:27] and the curse remain and so I've had to
[2:17:29] live with the curse and live with the
[2:17:31] curse and live with the curse because I
[2:17:34] didn't agree with the reversing of the
[2:17:36] curse of Calvary when he took it to hell
[2:17:39] and I've had to deal with it but oh that
[2:17:42] the Holy Ghost and Fire would descend
[2:17:45] upon us and he'd come by the power of
[2:17:47] the Holy Ghost and burn out of us all of
[2:17:51] that stuff that hinders the growth of
[2:17:53] the
[2:17:55] seed the problem is not with the
[2:18:01] seed it's because of some of that
[2:18:04] noncertified seed that we've allowed in
[2:18:07] our
[2:18:08] lives and because it's GMO and because
[2:18:12] it's
[2:18:13] hybrid because it's been genetically
[2:18:16] modified by the demon spirits of hell
[2:18:19] and we've allowed it into our lives and
[2:18:21] it seemed like that it had a a stronger
[2:18:25] ability to grow than the certified seed
[2:18:28] and we watched it grow and it got bigger
[2:18:30] than everything else and it was greener
[2:18:32] than everything else because it was what
[2:18:34] we kept
[2:18:36] watering but the certified seed is still
[2:18:39] there my friend if you've been under the
[2:18:41] sound of the word of God there's still
[2:18:44] some certified seed that have been
[2:18:46] planted in you you need the Holy Ghost
[2:18:50] and Fire
[2:18:57] the Lord shall command the blessing upon
[2:18:59] your
[2:19:00] storehouses and in all that you set your
[2:19:03] hand to he shall bless you in the land
[2:19:05] which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[2:19:07] musicians can come verse n the Lord
[2:19:09] shall establish thee and holy people
[2:19:12] unto himself as he has sworn unto thee
[2:19:15] if you keep the Commandments of the Lord
[2:19:17] thy God and walk in his ways and all of
[2:19:19] the people of the Earth shall see that
[2:19:21] th are called by the name of the Lord
[2:19:24] and they shall be afraid of thee and the
[2:19:28] Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods
[2:19:31] in the fruit of your body in the fruit
[2:19:34] of your cattle in the fruit of your
[2:19:36] ground in the land which the Lord swear
[2:19:40] unto your fathers to give thee has the
[2:19:42] Lord given you some land have you put
[2:19:45] down your landmarks then woe be to the
[2:19:48] man who comes and tries to remove the
[2:19:51] landmarks out of your land that's right
[2:19:55] you know how they get by with it cuz you
[2:19:58] agree with
[2:20:00] them something that you thought was
[2:20:04] established and you had put down a steak
[2:20:08] and somebody came along and gave you a
[2:20:10] better idea and they pulled up your
[2:20:12] steak and say I don't really think
[2:20:14] that's where it belongs and you began to
[2:20:17] agree with them and you let them put the
[2:20:19] stake down somewhere else oh friends I
[2:20:22] tell you get let the Holy Ghost and Fire
[2:20:25] get a hold of you today and let that
[2:20:27] steak let that Landmark be put down so
[2:20:31] that the Holy Ghost can put you
[2:20:33] plenteous in Goods in the fruit of your
[2:20:35] body in the fruit of your cattle in the
[2:20:37] fruit of your ground in the land which
[2:20:40] the Lord God gave
[2:20:43] you he called you to a particular
[2:20:46] location because he had a land he wanted
[2:20:49] to give to you
[2:20:51] don't let anybody remove the
[2:20:54] landmarks the Lord shall open up unto
[2:20:56] thee his good treasure the heaven to
[2:20:58] give the rain of the land and his season
[2:21:01] and to bless all the works of your hand
[2:21:03] and you shall lend unto many nations and
[2:21:05] thou shalt not borrow and the Lord shall
[2:21:08] make Thee the head and not the tail and
[2:21:11] thou shalt be above only and thou shalt
[2:21:15] not be beneath if you hearken unto the
[2:21:18] Commandments of the Lord thy God which I
[2:21:21] command unto thee this day to observe
[2:21:24] and to do them and shall not go aside
[2:21:27] from any of The Words which I command
[2:21:30] thee this day to the right hand or to
[2:21:33] the left to go after other
[2:21:38] gods other
[2:21:41] gods other
[2:21:44] gods other gods to serve
[2:21:48] them and then he goes on to talk talk
[2:21:50] about the curses which we've already
[2:21:52] covered but my Lord has reversed the
[2:21:56] curse he has reversed the
[2:21:59] curse do you need some Holy Fire of God
[2:22:06] today I believe that every
[2:22:09] believer could see some stuff in his or
[2:22:12] her life that he needs the fire of God
[2:22:16] to burn something out of him
[2:22:22] so that the ground that you have can
[2:22:26] become the fertile soil without any
[2:22:29] curse on it without you helping the
[2:22:33] curse by the words that you speak over
[2:22:36] to your own self or over your children
[2:22:38] but you speak life every time that you
[2:22:41] speak you're speaking life I speak life
[2:22:44] into the nutrients of the soil of my
[2:22:46] soul I speak life into it I speak life
[2:22:49] into the
[2:22:51] nutrients of of the food that I eat so
[2:22:54] that it becomes nourishment for my
[2:22:56] physical body friends we are living in
[2:22:59] the end time and I do believe that this
[2:23:02] is not just for the mind the will and
[2:23:05] the emotion the spirit is already taken
[2:23:07] care of that's settled by by the by the
[2:23:10] new birth but I believe that as we come
[2:23:13] nearer and nearer to the end time we
[2:23:15] have said before we are not leaving out
[2:23:17] of here as broken down sick people we
[2:23:22] are going out of here whole by the name
[2:23:24] of the Lord Jesus Christ but we've got
[2:23:27] to make sure that our soil is ready to
[2:23:31] receive that seed and that we are
[2:23:33] speaking life over the soil
[2:23:37] right the sword is driving us back to
[2:23:40] the tree of
[2:23:41] life we're drinking from the Waters of
[2:23:44] the river uh uh the the rivers of the
[2:23:46] Water of Life freely he gave it to us he
[2:23:50] wants that the the nutrients that are in
[2:23:52] that River of Life to be inside of us
[2:23:55] and he wants us speaking over our beings
[2:23:58] life and health and goodness and
[2:24:00] kindness and meekness he wants all of
[2:24:02] that settled down over us and if we have
[2:24:05] something inside of us today that is
[2:24:08] still of the other direction of a cursed
[2:24:10] nature the Holy Ghost is here today to
[2:24:13] burn it out of us to burn it out of us
[2:24:17] in the name of Jesus Christ to burn it
[2:24:20] out of us let's stand together
[2:24:24] today my God my God I come to you today
[2:24:28] with Thanksgiving I thank you Lord for
[2:24:31] the fire of the Holy Ghost I thank you
[2:24:34] for the anointing of the Holy Ghost I
[2:24:37] thank you Lord that we don't have to
[2:24:39] only be in church or listening to music
[2:24:43] but God we can allow the fire of God to
[2:24:46] meet us in our time of prayer where God
[2:24:49] you can do something miraculous for us
[2:24:54] but while we're under the sound of this
[2:24:56] word today we say here am I
[2:25:00] Lord here am I let the coal from off the
[2:25:04] altar touch my lips oh Lord let it burn
[2:25:10] away all of the
[2:25:13] curse that I agree
[2:25:18] with holy God
[2:25:21] cleanse me of the things that I have
