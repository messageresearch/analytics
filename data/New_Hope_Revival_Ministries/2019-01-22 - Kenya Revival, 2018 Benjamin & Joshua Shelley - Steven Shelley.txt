TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] hey I'm Benjamin shell and I'm Joshua shell and today we'd like to take you on our journey we just got back from Kenya Africa with our dad and uh so we're going to tell you some different things that happened along the way some things we saw the Lord do some friends that we made and I hope you enjoy [Music] this when we first get there you know Dad's CD's playing right in the car his singing CD you know you get to Convention and you hear oh well I was in your dad's meetings you know when he was here you know 2000 or even earlier than that and you know you would think going there after 18 years all that would have had kind of dwindled away you know people would have started to forget what had happened in the meetings then and it definitely it crossed my mind like you know maybe you know are they even going to remember much about it like yeah but they do they remembered everything there was boys that were 2 years old that remember the service when the pillar of fire came in the room I mean they just they remember that stuff and of course I mean that's that's something that would obviously stand out but you know 2 years old you know You' think you'd have just forgot it hearing more about Dad's Ministry there before I was even around um made me made something click and realized that we had to go um and so I think hearing what had happened things that had happened before I was even around made me realize we we have to go and do this I mean I told Dad like I I don't want to go I I just didn't want to go at that point and I just really prayed that night and at overall I just really felt like I needed to go I may not have wanted to really but I needed to before I left I was pretty low and I you know we all go through those ruts you're just low I go over there and me being a worship leader here um to see the worship to see the sincere worship that they have and to see them worship and not care what anyone else around them thinks just to worship and it be from them straight to him and and there was there was nothing like nothing for show it was all so so sincere and I think maybe the Lord wanted me to go over there to see that to' be like there's people still that worship with a sincere and pure heart that have no motives they just want to worship Him set your heart and daning you set your heart daning set your [Music] [Applause] heart I think for me really it was just to to get away from different things in my life and just to really like focus on him a lot and be able to just take oneon-one time with him and it made me want to come back and to serve him more and to um really just you know worship with my whole heart you know I I'll raise my hands and clap or whatever but it made me check myself to see you know was I really worshiping with my whole heart and um so coming back I definitely just wanted to give it my all and you know Praise Him to the fullest and honor him to the fullest first church service was on Friday night and uh we get out of the car and they're singing one of dad's songs but that was after we were stuck in traffic for for 2 hours 2 hours and then we get there we open the car there's we didn't it was a old school building that they were using for a church it was outside though and um so we walk in and there was probably 300 people yeah something like that something like that and um they were worshiping and it it's amazing it's beautiful to see them worship to be honest with you it's just it's beautiful and then uh dad preached that night and you want to talk about entering into the the word and amening the word and you know letting your amen be heard they they do that to the fullest extent the lady came up in a uh plastic chair they she could barely could walk cuz of her knees and they brought a plastic chair up so she could sit down and um that was in the morning service well that afternoon or evening I can't remember which one it was but she came up on the platform and testified and she was fine like walking running around like perfectly fine and just that morning she couldn't she barely could walk like she was literally would was came to stand at the altar and they had to bring a chair cuz she just couldn't move and then that night or whatever she was able just to walk up on the platform and give her testimony out and there was one I I believe it was the first um Sunday night of the convention uh dad was preaching and he got towards the end and he said um something to something like um the spirit of cancer he called the per of cancer out and I know for sure there was at least more than 10 people that said they were healed of cancer that night you trespassing Spirit you take your dirty hands off the children of God but the pastor guere got a call and a lady got filled with the Holy Ghost while dad while Dad was preaching one of the services in Nairobi if I if I'm and not even a hand was laid on her yeah nothing just dad was talking about you know you don't need to be you don't have I don't have to pray for you you can receive it right where you are right now and that day she went home and just sat laid in her bed and just prayed and cried out to the Lord until the Lord came down and like she knew she was full of the Holy Ghost I receive my Deliverance receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire receive him right now receive the Holy [Applause] Ghost Pastor Peterson Guero is over three churches in different parts of Kenya we preached at all three of his churches his sons that we were with the most would be Anthony and mangi oh they're they're awesome by the end of it they were you know their family like the boys in their culture if you're in like their dad's age group whatever you call him dad anyways and so the twin boys were calling Dad Dad and um just just dad said he never experienced anything like this in Africa just like um they would just come over to the house they had rented for us and just sat in fellowship with us for hours and hours until late into the night and he said it helped him so much cuz it felt more like a family it felt more like you know fellowship and stuff like that this guy comes up to me and Taps me on the shoulder and he's like my son wants a picture with the I think it's pronounced Zoom I'm not 100% sure but um and I was like excuse me and I thought he was saying asking to take a picture with his family like a picture of the family and I was like I'm not sure what you're saying so I was like mangi and so he told me and he wanted his son wanted a picture with the white man and if I'm pronouncing this right I think it's Zoom means white man and so I got a picture with somebody I have no idea who he was but he want his son wanted a picture with the white man we first when we first landed we were in a um we're in Nairobi which is a city and it's not a huge City but there's 4 million people in the city so it's it's slammed so by the time we spent I believe around a week in Nairobi so when we went to Nuru where it's more of Countryside it was we were very happy because it was and driving there was fun cuz you know you got to see different Villages you got to see uh the the Great Rift Valley that was neat like I love Nuru better than I do nirobi just because it's not as slam it's not and of course you know seeing all the animals and stuff is pretty amazing like you can go see him in the zoo and be like oh that's really cool but it's nothing like going out into the wild and you know seeing the animals in their natural habitat they told us before going into the convention um you know you're going to be tired and you know I thought to myself yeah okay you know we'll be tired but you know we'll be fine right most of the people were getting up at 4: to 4:30 the first worship and prayer started at 5: so they were up from you know 4: maybe even earlier and most of these people aren't going to sleep until 12 12:30 until whenever they would go to sleep so they're getting very minimal rest and not only that they're sleeping on mattresses that are like this thin on pavement um on concrete floors you know and hot it's hot not they don't have fans like we would here and uh you know people weren't complaining they were they were so they had so much anticipation um that they didn't care I never heard one person complain like at all the whole time yeah they they didn't care they were so grateful to be there right they have such freedom and I I find in traveling with that that a lot of the Bride in America is so so bound so they're they feel it feels like they're in such captivity um you know they go to church and they stand there like a statue instead of the word is alive and if the word's alive the people should be alive and not dead and so going over there and seeing how alive the people are makes you want to be more alive makes you want to worship more makes you want to press in more they're fighting this really the same battles that we are and um just because you know they have so much freedom in their worship and stuff we can have that here we can have that here but like he said a lot of churches are just bound up and we just need to let go and you know break our chains off and just to be free one of like some you know stuff that really sticks out to me is um the kids to see how the just the little kids worship and how they are you know just love I I love being around them like you know when we went to their Sunday school and stuff and handed out candy and sang with them and that was like that was so much fun to me because uh I made friends over the week of these little boys and little girls that you know would come up to me every time they saw me and just like hey what's up you know and um it was really nice because most the kids there um all speak English unless they're really really little so it was really nice just to be able to talk to you know you could talk to them and can communicate with them you know there wasn't that language barrier that's there in most cases and so we were able to get really close to a bunch of the kids and just really just have a relationship and a bond with them well in talking about the kids worshiping I noticed um you know if you look at when when when someone's praying in America and you look at the little kids no matter what the age are their eyes are probably open looking around the room you know good 90% of the time right it's not that way in Africa you you look out over the congregation while a prayers is going forth the kids are on their knees the kids are either on their knees are both hands are in the air and most of the time they're crying and praying not praying quietly under their breath praying loudly like and that was pretty amazing to see one of the churches in Nuru they actually have two benches um like the pull pit would be here the benches are like right here on the side where all the little kids sit like probably 2 to six or something like that maybe even younger and when Dad would D dad started praying really hard they all turned around and got on their knees and would just and they none of them moved until Dad was done praying they didn't get up they didn't look around they stayed in that position and prayed and you could hear them praying it wasn't just for show you could hear them praying so the clip you're about to see is pretty neat uh dad had just got up to the platform it was an afternoon session um he hadn't even really even started preaching yet and I don't even remember what exactly he said but he said power and when he said power every light in the building shut off all the microphone stopped working there was no electricity at all and so here Dad goes he just rolls with it and starts singing oh Lord send the power just now and I'm telling you what those people started singing and it was so so fun it was probably one of the most fun things that even happened I was like it was just fun like I would have been fine with the power just staying out like yeah because because people were like we don't care no power it's fine like they they were just going to keep going and so that was really fun [Music] dad got done preaching and just started singing press on like he had done in a couple other services and uh started walking up and you know up the aisles you know shaking everybody's hand press on press on and just something really moved and as he started walking all the way to the back just shaking as many hands as he could and yelling out to the People Press on um something really just the anointing really fell and I looked back I was able to look back back and saw Benjamin and Dad just was weeping and um of course you know it made me just start crying and you know just to see Dad you know Dad gave it his all like you know he he really was 100% like you know he meant [Music] it Hallelujah Jesus I love you thank you for with me we can go all the way can go all the way we can make much further now Hallelujah I have always Dad has always told me about the services where people were being carried out the window and stuff like that and I had never seen it you know I believed it but never saw it but in that service I literally saw them there were so many people falling out they were picking them up and carrying you know filing them out the door to lay on the grass cuz the the anointing was just so strong it was hard to leave the anointing like that like it was hard just to you know just just to leave you you didn't want to leave morning we left I I was crying like a baby because just you know after 16 days of being with these people every day yeah every day they're more like family than they would be friends and so knowing that you know I may not see them for you know another year Lord willing if we go back you know um you know that that's that's hard go through your life and see what is really important and what you need to clean out because you know the only way we going to get closer to him is if you make more room for him and he's doing his part but you got to look sometimes and see if you're doing yours and clean out all the junk and um stuff that's gone bad in your life Freedom will come when when people come together and decide hey when they come into church and decide we're going to be free we're we're not going to be bound anymore we don't care what people think anymore we're just going to worship because at the end of the day worship is about him anyway it's not about your peers that are around you
