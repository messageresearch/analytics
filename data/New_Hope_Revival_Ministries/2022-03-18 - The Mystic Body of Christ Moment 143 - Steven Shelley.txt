Description:
Who set up this Mystic Body of Jesus Christ?  Only the Lord Jesus Himself.  He is the Highest and Supreme Authority who with His own blood purchased us and places us in a living organism.  That is the real true Church.  We can’t be immersed nor sprinkled into that Body. “WE MUST BER BORN AGAIN!”
