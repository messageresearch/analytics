TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sovereignty means to exercise Supreme and independent Authority we have a God who is independent of any other Force there's nothing he he doesn't have to confer with anyone or anything he doesn't have to ask anybody's permission to be God he's God and God Alone he once existed alone with his thought there was nothing to worship him so he began to create that which would worship him that which would glorify him and L him as God but he was in essence always God waiting on an opportunity a time a moment in the fullness of his time from eternity he would create first angels and Heavenly hosts that would glorify him and praise him and worship him and eventually Adam who was made both male and female in the beginning and God reached in and pulled the feminis or the female part out of Adam and made for Adam a bride she was found in him and he reached inside and pulled her out even spiritually you and I were created in Christ when he was created somebody said you mean Christ was created the Bible said he was the beginning of the creation of God he was God but in physical form he was a creation of God there is no Eternal sunship there is sunship but not Eternal sunship there had to be a moment of stepping down of condescending to come in the role as a son but don't misunderstand there are not two Gods we are not tuness there's one and he is as much God as the father was everything that was in Jehovah he poured into Jesus Yeshua the Sun and everything that was in the sun has been poured out upon the church the bride Church in these last days so sovereignty means to exercise Supreme and independent Authority we're talking today about a sovereign God for us and through us I can tell you this God doesn't Delight in suffering he doesn't get joy out of pain he doesn't sit there like some crazed lunatic you know I got you I zapped you look what I can do you may have found that kind of a villain in your Disney life but our God is not like that he doesn't find Delight in anyone's suffering although he allows all things yes for his purpose all things listen All Things serve God in order to manifest his sons the goal in this life is that there will be Sons manif ested in the end of this and yes there are pain there's pain and there's loss and there's suffering and there are innocent people caught up in the swell of some of these things but the ultimate goal of our creator is to manifest sons in the end time the Bible tells us watch this even sin evil and the fall will serve God's purposes till the end he is going to have sons to fellowship with throughout all eternity and he's going to bring them forth in this hour and he's going to squeeze them out we're coming out of this thing by being squeezed out of it your Comforts are going to be [Music] challenged and if you if you know that something's coming that's God and you don't like it you're human and so what you say is you come in into prayer and you say Lord I might not necessarily like what's coming down the river now I I I I I may not be real but I want you to help me not to get in your way he's a sovereign God for us and through us oh God I don't want to get in your way so help me I'm going to pray what I know is right I'm going to vote what I know is right I'm going to do what I know is right but in the end I'm going to praise you the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord somebody said I just don't believe this kind of it doesn't matter what you believe what matters is what the word said you can't have it both ways I refuse to call myself a servant of a God who is less powerful than what he created he created the devil the Bible said he created evil for his purpose the Bible said he didn't just make light he made the darkness too and he uses it to turn people toward the light God uses Darkness to turn people toward the light he allows evil to turn people toward that which is right Hees he harnesses your problems your trials and uses them to bring you closer to him yes
