========================================

Description:
Scripture teaches that when we call upon the Name of the Lord, we shall be saved.  However, that is only the first step.  In our journey the Holy Spirit calls us to repent and do a turn-around.  He will help us rid ourselves of all sin and guilt, overcome the giants that have tormented us so long, and come to a walk of obedience, of freedom and holiness and be transformed into His image.
