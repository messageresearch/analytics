[37:40] He still desires to fill with his Holy
[37:43] Spirit.
[37:45] Oh, hallelujah. Yes.
[37:49] As we go to prayer today, do you have a
[37:51] need you just like to lift your hand
[37:53] into the presence of the Lord? He sees
[37:56] the hands all over the house, out across
[37:59] the stream. The Lord sees the need that
[38:02] you have and he knows how to handle the
[38:05] situation. Yes, he does. and he's more
[38:09] than cares for you. We pray for your
[38:12] needs.
[38:13] My dear old friend,
[38:18] not old, but we've been friends a long
[38:21] time, Brother Frank Christensen in
[38:24] Norway, stands in need of our prayers.
[38:27] He believes that God is more than able,
[38:29] more than sufficient to meet his needs.
[38:33] So, let's please remember him to the
[38:35] Lord in prayer. And many are traveling
[38:38] away for the holiday coming up. We want
[38:40] to pray that the Lord will give them his
[38:42] leadership and direction. Yes. And his
[38:44] protection according to his perfect
[38:46] will. Yes, Lord.
[38:49] We continue to pray over the nation of
[38:51] Israel.
[38:53] As we take these needs to the Lord
[38:55] today,
[38:57] you deserve the glory and the honor.
[39:00] Yes.
[39:03] You deserve the glory. Glory
[39:08] [Music]
[39:11] and the honor.
[39:15] [Music]
[39:18] Lord, we lift our hearts
[39:23] to worship
[39:26] and we lift our hands in praise.
[39:32] You deserve the gloryy
[39:36] [Music]
[39:39] and the honor.
[39:46] Lord, we lift our hearts
[39:51] in worship
[39:54] as we praise your holy
[39:59] name.
[40:00] For you are great.
[40:05] You do miracles
[40:09] so great.
[40:13] There is no
[40:15] one else like you.
[40:19] Oh, there is no
[40:22] one else like you. For you are great.
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] You do miracles.
[40:33] [Music]
[40:38] There is no
[40:40] one else like you.
[40:45] Oh, there is no
[40:48] one else like you.
[40:52] You deserve the glory
[40:56] [Music]
[40:59] and the honor.
[41:04] [Music]
[41:06] Lord, we lift our hearts
[41:11] to worship
[41:14] and we lift our hands in praise.
[41:20] You deserve the glory
[41:24] [Music]
[41:25] and the honor and
[41:29] the honor.
[41:34] Lord,
[41:36] we lift our hearts
[41:39] to worship
[41:42] as you come and pray for the kingdom.
[41:47] For you are great. For you are great.
[41:54] You do miracles.
[41:59] [Music]
[42:01] There is no one else like you.
[42:08] Oh, there is no
[42:10] one else like you. For you are great.
[42:19] [Music]
[42:23] So great.
[42:26] There is no one else like you.
[42:39] You are living. We proudly call you Aba
[42:43] this morning.
[42:45] We proudly call you Papa.
[42:48] We proudly call you Adonai this morning.
[42:51] You're not just our father. Hallelujah.
[42:54] Oh, you're not just an all powerful
[42:56] omnipotent being, but you are our
[42:59] savior. Yes, you are our redeemer.
[43:03] You are our healer this morning. We've
[43:06] met you in different places in life and
[43:09] in these different places. You've
[43:11] manifested these different things that
[43:13] you are. But this morning, as we come
[43:16] before you, God, we come empty. We come
[43:19] bare. And we ask, Lord, that you would
[43:21] shine your light into the deepest
[43:23] crevices of our heart. Grant it. I want
[43:27] nothing left of myself, oh God. I only
[43:32] want you. May you radiate from every
[43:36] corner of my life.
[43:39] May there be nothing of Daniel Miller
[43:42] left today.
[43:44] God, this house desires you above all
[43:48] else.
[43:50] Lord, where we've allowed the enemy to
[43:53] put filler in our life today,
[43:56] where we've allowed the enemy to bring
[43:58] in mortar that was not part of your
[44:01] eternal word. Your word says everything
[44:06] that can be shook will be shook. God,
[44:10] we're asking you, shake us to our core
[44:16] so that nothing but you is left. Lord,
[44:20] will you fill the gaps, Lord? Will you
[44:23] fill the cracks? Will you be our missing
[44:27] portion? Build your house, oh God.
[44:32] There's nothing you can't do today.
[44:35] We hear you. We see you today. Not just
[44:39] as that eternal being, not just as some
[44:42] mystical power out of our reach in
[44:44] another dimension, but we see the
[44:47] manifested God walking in shoe leather,
[44:51] taking our sins to Calvary and dying in
[44:55] our place that a people could be born in
[44:59] your spirit.
[45:01] We bring our needs before you, God,
[45:03] because we can't make a way for oursel.
[45:05] That's right. We bring our needs before
[45:07] you today because we can't heal ourself.
[45:11] We bring our needs before you today
[45:13] because we can't fix ourself. We need
[45:17] you, Papa.
[45:19] We need you, oh God.
[45:22] You're in this house.
[45:24] No doubt somewhere someone is desperate
[45:27] before you today.
[45:32] No doubt before this week is over,
[45:34] they'll turn. and they'll find their way
[45:35] through social media and they'll hear a
[45:37] word that will forever change their
[45:40] life.
[45:41] That's why we do it. Oh God, the net's
[45:45] being cast.
[45:47] Lord, we're we can't help what gets
[45:49] tangled in the net, but you told us to
[45:50] cast the net. So in the name of Yeshua
[45:54] Hamashiach, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[45:56] Christ, we throw today for your glory.
[46:00] We cast today for your honor. Lord,
[46:02] we're asking you to move for every name
[46:03] that was called before you this morning
[46:05] for the upcoming travels. Lord, we need
[46:07] you. We need you. If there ever was a
[46:10] minute, Lord, if there ever was a day,
[46:12] if there ever was a time, we need you
[46:14] now. Lord, the warfare is great, but
[46:17] God, you're greater.
[46:19] The enemy is powerful, but you're more
[46:21] powerful.
[46:22] There's nothing you can't stop. There's
[46:25] nothing you can't come between. And
[46:26] there's no there's no weapon formed
[46:29] against us today. Jesus, thank you for
[46:32] this body. Thank you for your word.
[46:34] Lord, we ask you to take your master key
[46:37] once again.
[46:39] Help us to step aside and let you walk
[46:41] through every doorway. You've got the
[46:43] key.
[46:44] Lord, we surrender and we thank you for
[46:47] the promises that you give and for what
[46:49] you're doing. Amen. In the name above
[46:51] all names, we pray the Lord Jesus
[46:53] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[46:57] Amen.
[47:03] For you are great.
[47:08] You do miracles
[47:12] so great.
[47:15] There is no one else like you.
[47:22] Oh, there is no
[47:25] one else like you. For you are great.
[47:33] You do miracles.
[47:35] [Music]
[47:41] There is no one else like you.
[47:48] There is no
[47:50] one else like you.
[47:59] Now give him another worthy clap of
[48:02] praise.
[48:03] We shout with our voices of praise unto
[48:06] you, Lord.
[48:10] Hallelujah.
[48:15] Praise the Lord. You may have your seats
[48:18] today. It's good to see you in the house
[48:22] of the Lord. We are blessed to have the
[48:26] opportunity to come into the house of
[48:29] the Lord, gathered with the saints to
[48:32] know that he is in our midst. We brought
[48:34] him with us. He is here and we give him
[48:39] all the praise.
[48:41] Sister Hannah, it's nice to have you
[48:43] again today. The Lord bless you. We're
[48:46] glad to have you here in the midst of us
[48:48] today. God bless you.
[48:53] It's nice to have brother Daniel and
[48:55] sister Anna here with us today.
[48:58] They're on the road so much, but what a
[49:00] blessing to have them home today. Sister
[49:03] Dorothy, it's good to see you again
[49:05] today. Lord bless you.
[49:07] [Applause]
[49:11] Jerry and his mother Kim, they've just
[49:13] become a part of us. We're glad that
[49:15] they're here. God bless you.
[49:20] Nia must have talked grandpa into coming
[49:23] to church. We're so glad to see brother
[49:26] Donovan today. God bless you.
[49:33] What a blessing to have him here. I know
[49:36] Nia is a happy girl.
[49:42] Yeah.
[49:43] [Music]
[49:45] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[49:46] Lord today?
[49:49] When you drove on the campground today,
[49:51] you probably saw more red dirt than
[49:54] you've seen on this campground in some
[49:56] years. We didn't bring one ounce more
[49:59] than there's ever been here.
[50:03] There's not one shovel full more of red
[50:05] dirt on this campground than there was
[50:07] two weeks ago. Just a lot of it moved
[50:10] around.
[50:12] God willing, this week the ground is
[50:14] going to be painted green.
[50:18] What do I mean by that? We're going to
[50:20] hydro seed. What is hydro seed? Hydro
[50:24] seed is a mixture of hay and straw and
[50:29] seed, grass seeds of uh two varieties as
[50:33] far as I know. And it's it's just a big
[50:36] sludge that they spray out on the ground
[50:38] and it turns the ground green. But by
[50:41] God's grace, it's going to grow green
[50:43] grass.
[50:45] Uh why did we choose hydro seed over
[50:48] sod? Because the expense is so large for
[50:54] sod and the amount of square footage
[50:56] that we needed was
[51:01] we needed 36,000 square feet of sod from
[51:04] what we estimated, which was going to
[51:06] cost in the proximity of $14,000.
[51:10] And we're thinking that for 2500
[51:14] or so, they're going to put this hydro
[51:17] seed. And so, uh, we are believing that
[51:22] God is going to send the right showers
[51:24] at the right time. God is going to raise
[51:27] up people to help us to keep it watered
[51:29] so that it will because it is still
[51:31] going to need watered. There will be a
[51:33] summer. Yes, there will be a summer. And
[51:35] and so, we're going to have to keep it
[51:37] watered. uh when we fixed the pipe up
[51:40] here, we put a put a faucet up here in
[51:43] the ground so that we would have easy
[51:45] access for water uh up there, but over
[51:48] here there's no water pipes on this side
[51:50] of the building. And so we are going to
[51:53] have to hook to the to the building and
[51:55] water over there, which means that those
[51:58] of you that live down here, make sure
[52:00] that you're slowing down so that you
[52:02] don't destroy our water hose if you have
[52:04] to go across it. We are just asking for
[52:07] cooperation, but we're just trying to do
[52:10] what we can to make this land what God
[52:13] called it to be. We're we're cooperating
[52:15] with him to see that the vision is
[52:18] fulfilled. Uh we we first and foremost
[52:22] we want the spiritual atmosphere over
[52:25] the ground to be right. And and then we
[52:28] want to make sure that the natural
[52:30] atmosphere is right, that we're doing
[52:32] what God has called us to do in the
[52:34] right season to make it what he wants it
[52:36] to be. Then after the ground is fixed,
[52:38] and then we're going to get the parking
[52:40] lot uh re um recoded and the lines
[52:44] repainted, by God's grace, that will be
[52:46] accomplished before camp meeting time.
[52:49] Uh believing for that. Just looking for
[52:53] God to meet us today and in every
[52:56] service. between now and camp meeting,
[52:58] but believing God to meet us in camp
[53:00] meeting, too.
[53:04] Uh about the slow down. Could you say
[53:06] that just one more time? Because even
[53:09] when we mention it, even when I mention
[53:12] it, uh I'm still aware at different
[53:15] times that people come come by really
[53:19] extremely too fast. Uh and it's not all
[53:23] men. It's there. We never know when
[53:27] there'll be children out playing
[53:30] and
[53:33] then there's workers sometimes in the
[53:35] road and sometimes somebody just walking
[53:39] to get some exercise. And so we want to
[53:41] be very cautious as soon as we come onto
[53:43] the ground to slow down and make sure
[53:48] that we're being very aware of
[53:51] everything that's around us. And not
[53:54] only that, we we seem to have children
[53:57] that navigate to the parking lot. So, we
[54:00] want to be real real aware when we're
[54:02] moving our vehicles, uh, especially in
[54:04] the dark, uh, because we never know when
[54:07] a child is going to run. And and and
[54:10] I understand we need to keep our
[54:13] children in in check, but sometimes they
[54:15] get away from us. And and we want to
[54:19] make sure that we're using utmost
[54:20] caution while we're here on the ground.
[54:23] and and not just with our vehicles, with
[54:26] our attitudes, with with our words, with
[54:29] our actions that we we are with uh here
[54:33] on the on the ground and even with
[54:35] bicycles and and whatever you might ride
[54:38] or walk or we just want to honor one
[54:41] another. Amen. We want to receive the
[54:44] tithe and offering today giving as unto
[54:47] the Lord. Um we are praying for the
[54:51] nation of Israel. We continue to sew
[54:54] into the work in Jerusalem, believing
[54:56] the Lord is going to uh enhance our
[54:59] vision as to what he desires of us in
[55:03] Jerusalem and the nation of Israel. Uh
[55:05] but we continue to sew into that land.
[55:08] We continue to give our offering for uh
[55:10] what we call the building fund, which is
[55:14] going to help to pay for some of this
[55:15] out here. And uh well, maybe all of it.
[55:19] Uh we are thankful for the men that have
[55:23] given their labor, their machinery. We
[55:25] want to make sure they get fuel in their
[55:27] machinery. Um I I I want to just take a
[55:31] moment to honor Austin Yantis
[55:35] on Tuesday. I meant to do it. Those of
[55:38] you that live on the ground uh would
[55:40] appreciate the caution with which he was
[55:44] digging beside the water pipe
[55:47] because we went probably 30 feet where
[55:50] the water pipe was just kind of hanging
[55:52] in the air and it would have been very
[55:54] easy just one small mishap to hit that
[55:57] pipe and break it and and create quite
[55:59] the mess and put you without water. But
[56:01] I honor you, Austin, for your skill on
[56:04] the machinery and as well as all of the
[56:07] rest and brother Truman and whoever. I
[56:10] even got to run it. Uh got to learn how
[56:14] to
[56:15] I'm not used to joysticks, but I learned
[56:19] and I moved some dirt, too. But I'm I'm
[56:22] thankful for these that have Joseph and
[56:25] Jubel and Ian. They they did well
[56:27] leaning on a shovel. I mean, scooping
[56:29] dirt.
[56:34] Just be honest. Anybody that has ever uh
[56:38] worked with a shovel knows that they
[56:40] would rather scoop dirt as lean on a
[56:43] shovel because leaning on a shovel can
[56:46] get quite boring.
[56:48] I'd rather be doing a little bit of
[56:50] work. But I'm I'm grateful to everyone
[56:52] to those of you who helped to bring some
[56:54] meals to them and and and help them
[56:57] through the day. water, drinks, whatever
[56:59] it was. God bless you. Thank you for
[57:02] what you do for the kingdom of God and
[57:05] for the service uh of the Lord and this
[57:08] campground. Uh let's receive the tithe
[57:11] and offering as brother Kate is getting
[57:13] ready to sing. And uh so brother Austin
[57:16] Yantis, will you come? Brother Ian, will
[57:18] you come? Let these two brothers come to
[57:20] you today. Give is giving unto the Lord
[57:23] with your tithe and your offering and
[57:25] just with a cheerful heart worship him.
[57:37] [Music]
[57:50] So many times I've questioned
[57:53] certain circumstances
[57:56] or things I could not understand.
[58:02] [Music]
[58:03] Many times in my trials,
[58:07] weakness blurs my vision, my
[58:11] frustration.
[58:12] He gets so out of hand.
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] It's then that I reminded
[58:22] I've never been forsaken.
[58:26] I've never had to stand the test
[58:30] alone.
[58:32] And as I look at all the victories,
[58:36] that spirit rises up in me. And it's
[58:40] through the fire my weakness is
[58:44] made strong.
[58:47] [Music]
[58:50] Oh, and he never promised that the cross
[58:55] would not get heavy and the hill would
[58:59] not be hard, too. to climb.
[59:05] No, he never offered
[59:09] a victory without fighting. But he said
[59:13] help would always come in time.
[59:19] Just remember when you're standing
[59:23] in the valley of decision
[59:26] and the adversary says give in. Oh, just
[59:33] hold on.
[59:36] My God is going to show up
[59:40] and he will take you through the fire
[59:44] again.
[59:48] Oh, I know within myself that I would
[59:52] surely perish.
[59:55] But if I trust the mighty hand of God,
[59:58] he'll shield the plans again,
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:03] again and again. Oh,
[1:00:08] he never promised that the cross would
[1:00:12] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[1:00:16] hard to climb.
[1:00:21] No, he never offered. Oh, a victory
[1:00:26] without fighting. But he said help would
[1:00:29] always come in time.
[1:00:35] Just remember when you're standing
[1:00:38] in your valley of decision
[1:00:42] and the adversary says, "Oh, just give
[1:00:46] in. Oh, just hold on.
[1:00:52] My God is going to show up." Oh, and he
[1:00:56] will take you through the fire again.
[1:01:01] No,
[1:01:04] he never promised that the cross would
[1:01:07] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[1:01:12] hard to climb.
[1:01:16] No, he never offered
[1:01:20] a victory without fighting. He said,
[1:01:24] "Help would always come in time."
[1:01:28] Just remember, boy, just remember when
[1:01:32] you're standing in your valley of
[1:01:35] decision
[1:01:37] and the adversary says just give in.
[1:01:42] Oh, just hold on.
[1:01:47] Our God is going to show up. Yes, he
[1:01:49] will. And he will take you through the
[1:01:53] fire again.
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:58] Oh, and he never promised that the cross
[1:02:02] would not get heavy and the hill would
[1:02:06] not be hard to climb.
[1:02:13] He never offered oh a victory without
[1:02:17] fighting. But he said help would come in
[1:02:22] time. Aren't you glad?
[1:02:26] Just remember when you're standing
[1:02:29] in your valley of decision
[1:02:33] and the adversary says, "Why don't you
[1:02:36] just give in
[1:02:38] or just hold on? Remember this. My God
[1:02:43] is going to show up. He'll do it again
[1:02:46] and he will take you through the fire
[1:02:50] again.
[1:02:51] Oh, just hold on.
[1:02:56] My God is going to show up. Yes, he
[1:02:58] will. And he will take you through the
[1:03:02] fire again.
[1:03:07] He will take you through the fire
[1:03:11] again.
[1:03:13] [Music]
[1:03:22] Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:29] Don't dare let go.
[1:03:32] My You hold on to him because I know
[1:03:35] that he's holding on to you. Aren't you
[1:03:38] glad? Aren't you glad? Give him one more
[1:03:41] praise. Give him one more hand clap of
[1:03:44] praise.
[1:03:50] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:03:54] You may be seated this morning for just
[1:03:57] a few moments. I don't want to take too
[1:03:59] much time for preliminaries because
[1:04:03] we've had a wonderful informative time
[1:04:06] in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Um, I
[1:04:11] want you to know that so far to just add
[1:04:15] to what brother Gley has said. So far,
[1:04:16] what has been done here, not one person
[1:04:19] has uh turned in an invoice as of yet. I
[1:04:24] have mentioned it and there will be
[1:04:26] forthcoming ones, but so far these
[1:04:29] brothers have done what they've done
[1:04:31] without without uh a check. And I want
[1:04:35] you to know that uh that is impressive
[1:04:39] and humbling and uh not not entirely
[1:04:43] their place. They're doing it as uh an
[1:04:47] offering unto the Lord. Uh some of some
[1:04:50] of it and uh I knew that they had to buy
[1:04:53] a piece of some some I don't guess you
[1:04:56] call it equipment, but supplies things
[1:04:59] that they needed to to put in the
[1:05:01] different parts. And I know that there
[1:05:04] was a a brother who just did it. Just
[1:05:06] bought it just and and never asked for
[1:05:09] anything. So I I want you to know that
[1:05:12] uh that's stretching your building fund
[1:05:15] money, stretching it a little bit. And
[1:05:18] um uh we're just believing that that
[1:05:21] God's going to help us for the future.
[1:05:24] And I want you to know that uh Josh
[1:05:27] Yantis is one of the most conscientious
[1:05:30] and careful and concerned uh leaders
[1:05:34] that I know of. He he knows his craft.
[1:05:38] He knows he knows this this business and
[1:05:41] he knows the skill that is required. And
[1:05:44] brother Truman Miller is uh they make
[1:05:48] the best co- captains of any team
[1:05:51] there's ever been in the in the whole
[1:05:53] world. We are blessed.
[1:05:56] We are blessed. Would you just give them
[1:05:59] one more thank you for all they've done?
[1:06:04] We are so blessed.
[1:06:08] Thank you so much for being many of you
[1:06:11] were here on Friday evening to celebrate
[1:06:14] with us. our youngest daughter, our
[1:06:17] caboose Mariah, has graduated and we're
[1:06:22] thankful that she has finished her
[1:06:24] course of study and we're thankful that
[1:06:26] we got to celebrate it together and I
[1:06:29] had a real real good time. Um, it was a
[1:06:33] very relaxed time. It it got that way
[1:06:36] and they started playing music and we
[1:06:38] started singing and the kids got to
[1:06:40] singing and it was uh that was the icing
[1:06:45] on the cake. And if you missed that
[1:06:48] opportunity, you really missed something
[1:06:49] because uh we weren't able to stream it.
[1:06:53] Although I did see Sister Rebecca with
[1:06:55] the phone in the air. I'm assuming that
[1:06:57] was for for Sister Terry. And uh I'm so
[1:07:00] glad you did that. That's a sacrifice to
[1:07:02] stand, you know, raise that phone up,
[1:07:05] but mama is home with her mama and uh we
[1:07:09] want to thank you for that. We want to
[1:07:11] join with brother Gley in telling you
[1:07:13] the importance of praying for the nation
[1:07:16] of Israel. Um we are certainly in a very
[1:07:21] serious time. This is a very serious
[1:07:24] time for for the nation of Israel and
[1:07:27] for the nation of the United States of
[1:07:29] America. Uh the the uh the regime in
[1:07:34] Iran uh refers to Israel as the little
[1:07:39] Satan and uh the US as the big Satan.
[1:07:44] And uh we are uh faced uh to this this
[1:07:50] has been going on for over 15 years.
[1:07:53] And when we were working closely with
[1:07:55] Apac, it is one of their main driving
[1:08:00] themes. They taught us again and again
[1:08:05] the danger of the uh Iranian regime and
[1:08:10] their nearness to having nuclear
[1:08:13] weapons.
[1:08:14] Intelligence has said that they were a
[1:08:18] few weeks away from being able to attach
[1:08:22] a nuclear warhead onto a missile that
[1:08:25] has plenty of power and range to get it
[1:08:29] to Manhattan.
[1:08:32] And so, you know, there's a time to
[1:08:35] strategize, there's a time to think
[1:08:37] about it, uh there's a time to wait it
[1:08:40] out and know what the right move is. And
[1:08:43] then there's a time to get her done.
[1:08:47] And I don't say that with any casual
[1:08:51] flippency for any loss of lives. I don't
[1:08:55] rejoice. I never have. I came close to
[1:08:58] it one time uh with a a pretty evil
[1:09:03] leader. But uh I can't help what popped
[1:09:06] into my mind. You can't always help it.
[1:09:08] You don't have to entertain it. You
[1:09:10] certainly don't have to say it in the
[1:09:10] pool pit. But I was driving along and
[1:09:14] the word came that Arafat was finished.
[1:09:17] And this thought came to my mind from
[1:09:19] the Wizard of Oz. Isn't that spiritual?
[1:09:21] And and and I said, "Oh, well,
[1:09:23] ding-dong, the witch is dead."
[1:09:26] And then my heart was a little smitten
[1:09:29] because I don't care how evil somebody
[1:09:32] is, there's somebody somewhere that
[1:09:34] loves that person.
[1:09:37] Think of it. Some wife. I don't know how
[1:09:40] you could love some of these ugly folks,
[1:09:42] you know, but somebody, some mama, some
[1:09:45] mama drew that child to her breast and
[1:09:49] and and wanted the best. Amen. So, I
[1:09:53] don't rejoice at the loss of lives on
[1:09:55] any side of any skirmish, but I will
[1:09:58] tell you that u the the Jewish lives
[1:10:02] that have been lost are just as valuable
[1:10:05] as any other life. And any nation that
[1:10:09] would not be willing to defend
[1:10:11] themselves in these kinds of
[1:10:13] circumstances
[1:10:15] is a weak and woke nation. And I'm
[1:10:18] thankful that uh uh do you always have
[1:10:21] to agree I get asked this often. Do you
[1:10:23] always have to agree with the leaders of
[1:10:25] Israel? No. Do you always agree with the
[1:10:28] leaders of the USA? Of course not. You
[1:10:31] don't always have to agree with their
[1:10:33] tactics or their strategies or their
[1:10:36] policies.
[1:10:37] Is there corruption in the Knesset? Yes.
[1:10:41] Is there corruption in the Senate and in
[1:10:43] the House of Representatives? Same.
[1:10:44] Same. Just because Israel is a promised
[1:10:48] nation and the Bible has told us that
[1:10:51] God is married
[1:10:54] to the land. That that's big.
[1:10:58] And I understand the one new man a as
[1:11:01] good as anybody understands the one new
[1:11:03] man both Jew and Gentile come together
[1:11:06] through the covenant of grace. But I
[1:11:08] also understand that the covenant that
[1:11:11] God made with Abraham
[1:11:14] is an eternal covenant as well according
[1:11:16] to God. And he said that he would give
[1:11:20] them their land and that one day uh no
[1:11:23] one would remove them again. Now, that
[1:11:26] either has to come to pass
[1:11:29] or it was a false prophecy. Is that
[1:11:31] right? Do we hold the scripture to the
[1:11:34] same standard? It has to it has to come
[1:11:36] to pass. Um, I have some woke folk uh
[1:11:41] who will post every day this week that
[1:11:43] this is this Israel is not the Israel
[1:11:46] promised and uh this is the the
[1:11:49] Rockefeller Israel and the u you know
[1:11:53] the Illuminati Israel and so forth.
[1:11:55] Well, you say anything you want to, but
[1:11:58] a vindicated prophet said
[1:12:01] that this was the eternal insign
[1:12:05] that was spoken of in the prophecies of
[1:12:07] the prophets of the Old Testament. He
[1:12:09] called the star of David, the
[1:12:11] Magandavid. In Hebrew, it's called the
[1:12:13] Magand Davided. And he called it the
[1:12:16] fulfillment of scripture. And when they
[1:12:19] when they raised that that uh star of
[1:12:22] David again uh over Jerusalem, he said,
[1:12:25] "Scripture is being fulfilled. This is
[1:12:28] an eternal insign."
[1:12:30] And I've been in this thing so long that
[1:12:34] I've had people come and say, you know,
[1:12:36] the star of David is a is an adjustment
[1:12:39] of the pentagram and uh it's really
[1:12:41] satanic and it has nothing to do with
[1:12:43] Israel. Well, uh, I'll just say that I
[1:12:47] believe the scripture says different.
[1:12:49] And I believe brother Brandham said
[1:12:50] different. And, uh, my good friend,
[1:12:54] brother Perry Green, used to say very
[1:12:56] often, if you don't believe in God, if
[1:13:00] you don't believe in a God, watch
[1:13:03] Israel.
[1:13:05] because he said there is nothing on the
[1:13:07] planet that is a bigger testimony and a
[1:13:11] bigger evidence that there is a God than
[1:13:15] the modern establishment or the restored
[1:13:17] establishment of the nation of Israel.
[1:13:21] We know that it is true. We've seen and
[1:13:23] heard and I have interviewed living
[1:13:26] witnesses and brother Gley has seen and
[1:13:29] and spoke with living witnesses of those
[1:13:32] wars. We've sat down and had Turkish
[1:13:35] coffee with witnesses who saw uh men
[1:13:39] dressed in white
[1:13:45] on the day that Israel recaptured the
[1:13:48] the Temple Mount and Jerusalem for the
[1:13:52] first time in in uh several dec
[1:13:56] thousands of years really uh
[1:13:59] at least
[1:14:01] uh had not then in total control of
[1:14:05] Jewish hands until that day and they
[1:14:08] recaptured the city and God showed up
[1:14:11] angelically on the temple mount and the
[1:14:14] soldiers saw an army that didn't exist.
[1:14:18] the enemy soldiers of the United Arab
[1:14:20] League of Nations, five nations gathered
[1:14:23] together against the city, against the
[1:14:25] nation first and then joined in the in
[1:14:28] the harassment of of trying to hold on
[1:14:31] to the city. And um there were men in
[1:14:37] white
[1:14:39] um I don't know exactly what you call
[1:14:42] them. Uh I think the word is something
[1:14:45] like safari fatigue. Do you know what
[1:14:47] that is? It's uh because Israel was
[1:14:51] originally part of the British mandate
[1:14:53] and they wore uh what looks like
[1:14:57] fatigues but but not camouflage. Uh
[1:15:00] they're a desert tan. Does anybody know
[1:15:03] what I'm talking about? A jacket and
[1:15:05] pants. And there were there was an army
[1:15:08] that showed up on the top of the temple
[1:15:10] mount in white safari fatigues.
[1:15:14] And and the the uh soldiers who were
[1:15:17] there that day, they didn't know who
[1:15:19] they were. And they were so afraid. They
[1:15:21] were so afraid of of what they saw.
[1:15:24] Where did this army come from that they
[1:15:27] ran out of their sandals?
[1:15:30] They left their shoes.
[1:15:33] And uh when when the army the real army
[1:15:35] I mean no no that was the real army.
[1:15:38] When the Israeli army finally got up
[1:15:40] there all they see is empty shoes
[1:15:42] everywhere.
[1:15:45] You know that's God.
[1:15:47] If you can take down the Egyptian air
[1:15:49] force with mav cocktails
[1:15:53] because you so believe in the promises
[1:15:55] of God. Can you imagine flying in low
[1:15:58] lowflying little planes and literally
[1:16:00] dropping uh Coca-Cola bottles of of fuel
[1:16:04] out out over the the not only
[1:16:09] there were tanks that were stopped
[1:16:14] miraculously. I don't think a Matav
[1:16:16] cocktail did that. I I I think that just
[1:16:19] put a little little liquid on the on the
[1:16:21] on the hood of that thing. It had to be
[1:16:23] God that just arrested it. Amen. And we
[1:16:26] have walked in the history of that.
[1:16:28] We've walked through I've touched some
[1:16:31] of those uh tanks that were stopped and
[1:16:33] we've placed our hands and even climbed
[1:16:35] onto some of those uh big airplanes that
[1:16:39] were stopped miraculously. So listen,
[1:16:41] whether you believe that Rockefeller did
[1:16:43] it or God did it or or whatever your
[1:16:46] thoughts are, be careful what you say
[1:16:50] because God said uh we are to bless
[1:16:53] Israel.
[1:16:54] Brother Brandham said, "If you want to
[1:16:56] know what God is doing, you you use
[1:16:58] Jerusalem, you watch Israel, you watch
[1:17:00] the Jews. They're God's time piece." And
[1:17:04] somebody said, "Well, they don't they
[1:17:05] haven't even accepted Jesus." Just hold
[1:17:07] on. If they would have, according to
[1:17:10] Paul, if they would have accepted him
[1:17:12] the first time, you and I might have not
[1:17:15] never come. We might have never come.
[1:17:17] Right.
[1:17:19] He's pretty clear in Romans chapter 11
[1:17:22] that it was God who blinded their eyes.
[1:17:28] So for you and I that you and I would be
[1:17:30] able to see. Isn't that the goodness of
[1:17:33] God?
[1:17:35] And so God turns this thing around. And
[1:17:37] we know that because of the seals. We
[1:17:40] hear the prophet talking about the fifth
[1:17:42] seal. those souls underneath the altar,
[1:17:46] not martyed Christians,
[1:17:49] Jews who died for the faith that they
[1:17:51] held. And they're crying out, "Oh Lord,
[1:17:54] how long?" The scriptures are
[1:17:56] prophetically clear. He's coming to the
[1:17:59] Mount of Olives. Are you still with me?
[1:18:03] And there will be scars in his hands.
[1:18:06] And that nation will ask, "What are
[1:18:08] these scars in your hands? This is that
[1:18:10] that I have received in the household of
[1:18:12] my friends. And if the prophets are
[1:18:15] right in the Old Testament, they clearly
[1:18:18] tell us in that hour all Israel,
[1:18:22] those who are true Jews, yes, will be
[1:18:26] saved. Amen. That is the promise of God.
[1:18:30] Uh so we want to pray. Uh, I prayed. I
[1:18:34] was uh awake uh this morning at 5:30,
[1:18:39] about 5:20, praying. I prayed for an
[1:18:41] hour before I got out of bed for you,
[1:18:44] for the nation of Israel, for our
[1:18:47] leaders. This is a serious time. And I
[1:18:50] will say one more time, I don't care if
[1:18:52] it sounds political. You can uh you can
[1:18:56] take it or leave it. Doesn't really
[1:18:58] matter. But I think that it's important
[1:19:00] for me to say that we are blessed. Uh we
[1:19:04] didn't we didn't elect a pastor. We
[1:19:06] weren't praying for a pope. We we we uh
[1:19:09] we chose uh a leader and and u I'm
[1:19:13] thankful that he he has moved and not
[1:19:17] just to protect the nation of Israel,
[1:19:18] but protect the opportunity that you and
[1:19:20] I need to finish raising our children.
[1:19:23] God is good
[1:19:26] all the time. That's my sermonet.
[1:19:31] And uh I'm not taking it back and I'm
[1:19:33] not even going to take an extra offering
[1:19:34] for it. It's just it's just free.
[1:19:37] Totally free. Let's thank God for these
[1:19:39] musicians. I'm not going to sing. I just
[1:19:41] sang.
[1:19:43] That was my song.
[1:19:47] Would you stand with me? You can tell
[1:19:50] that I have lots to say.
[1:19:53] And uh let's believe that God will talk
[1:19:55] to us. That's why we're here.
[1:19:59] And this has been an unusual time.
[1:20:03] God has been dealing and stirring many
[1:20:06] hearts.
[1:20:09] Many things are happening, shifts and
[1:20:13] seasons changing spiritually. We feel
[1:20:15] these things.
[1:20:19] Some are extra sensitive to them.
[1:20:22] And pray for those. Pray for those
[1:20:25] because it's a struggle because it
[1:20:28] affects it uh it shadows everything they
[1:20:30] do. It affects everything they do. Every
[1:20:33] relationship they have is affected by
[1:20:36] their sensitivity to those things that
[1:20:38] happen in another realm.
[1:20:40] When brother Brandham was speaking to us
[1:20:43] concerning the book of the revelation
[1:20:46] and it was later rewarded but but well
[1:20:50] worded in the church age book. He spoke
[1:20:53] about the book of the revelation not
[1:20:55] being for just anybody.
[1:20:58] He said it's it's a prophetic book and
[1:21:01] it is only understood by a prophetic
[1:21:05] class.
[1:21:06] Did you know that as a believer of this
[1:21:09] end time message uh you are a you are a
[1:21:12] part of the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:21:17] You believe that? And in fact, you are a
[1:21:20] king called out of Abraham. That's what
[1:21:23] the book of the revelation tells us. And
[1:21:26] that makes you by by nature. It makes
[1:21:30] you a prophetic people. If you have
[1:21:33] received the revelation of the
[1:21:35] revelation, the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:37] Christ, then you you had to be uh
[1:21:41] specifically designed to be able to see
[1:21:43] it and understand it. He told us
[1:21:46] multiple times, everybody will not see
[1:21:48] it. They just won't be able to see it.
[1:21:50] So, we should really, I think we should
[1:21:53] value the blessing and the benefit of
[1:21:56] God opening our eyes to see the
[1:21:58] unveiling, the apocalypsis of Jesus
[1:22:02] Christ. He's no longer behind the
[1:22:04] lattice. I'm waiting on your amen. He's
[1:22:08] no longer behind the lattice, but he has
[1:22:10] stepped behind
[1:22:12] the lattice. And the scripture says he's
[1:22:15] now in plain view.
[1:22:18] Aren't you glad that Jesus Christ, his
[1:22:21] work, his attributes, his power, his
[1:22:24] intentions toward you are no longer
[1:22:26] hidden in symbols and mysteries.
[1:22:29] Hallelujah. But we now have the reality.
[1:22:32] We have the antitype of every type. We
[1:22:35] have the reality of every shadow. When
[1:22:38] Jesus unveils himself, there are no more
[1:22:41] shadows.
[1:22:44] Only thing we do is go back and remember
[1:22:46] where the shadows were and thank God
[1:22:49] that he's no longer standing in them.
[1:22:51] But he's made himself real. Did anybody
[1:22:54] get born again by a shadow? No, sir. No.
[1:22:58] No. It was real blood.
[1:23:01] Help me. It was real blood. It was the
[1:23:05] blood of God.
[1:23:09] Wasn't Mary's blood. It wasn't Joseph's
[1:23:11] blood. It was the blood of God. It was
[1:23:15] blood specifically created for the
[1:23:17] redemption of mankind. I'm glad the life
[1:23:20] of that blood has fallen on me. Are you
[1:23:23] Are you ready for the word? This week I
[1:23:27] I sent out a message because of an
[1:23:30] experience that I had with the Lord. I
[1:23:33] was desperate. Have you ever been
[1:23:35] desperate? I was desperate. I didn't
[1:23:38] think that I would be able to go on uh
[1:23:41] like I was in that straight
[1:23:44] and you know just in a fix and God in
[1:23:48] his great mercies.
[1:23:51] It was only him who who met me with an
[1:23:56] answer.
[1:23:58] I'm not anything
[1:24:00] but I am thankful to be able to see and
[1:24:04] hear. How many of you glad you have eyes
[1:24:06] to see and ears to hear? And I'm sick
[1:24:10] and tired of trying to dress it up and
[1:24:14] and dress it down and make it more
[1:24:16] palatable
[1:24:17] for for carnal Christians.
[1:24:20] Amen. Why don't we just say what it is?
[1:24:24] We're a prophetic class of people
[1:24:26] following a prophetic message. Amen.
[1:24:29] Amen. And and and and no wonder we can
[1:24:31] believe that God would deal with
[1:24:33] somebody in a dream or a vision. As long
[1:24:36] as that dream doveetales with the word
[1:24:39] of God as long as that vision or
[1:24:42] revelation fits the absolute of
[1:24:44] scripture because only the Bible is
[1:24:47] inherent and infallible. Amen. The
[1:24:51] church age book is not inherent. Amen.
[1:24:54] And it is not infallible. But that Bible
[1:24:56] is. He told us it was our absolute. And
[1:25:00] as long as you get a feeling, I'm not
[1:25:02] against feelings. Don't live by them.
[1:25:05] But if you get a feeling that's based on
[1:25:07] the word and you can you can show us
[1:25:09] that in the word, I'm for it.
[1:25:13] If you worship a little differently than
[1:25:15] I do, but I can find something about it
[1:25:18] in the word.
[1:25:21] I'd rather I'd rather join you than to
[1:25:24] condemn you. Yeah, I'm in it. Because
[1:25:28] I'd rather praise him than anything I
[1:25:30] can think of. Uh you look at me and you
[1:25:33] say, "Well, you must enjoy eating."
[1:25:34] Well, I do. I'm not going to tell you I
[1:25:36] don't. But there is one thing I'd rather
[1:25:38] do, and that is to give my life in
[1:25:42] praise. I want to I love to praise him.
[1:25:44] Don't you?
[1:25:46] And so, uh the text this morning is from
[1:25:50] Jeremiah chapter 48.
[1:25:56] And I'm just going to read the paragraph
[1:25:59] before we take the scripture. Just one
[1:26:01] paragraph of the message that I sent out
[1:26:04] to you on Wednesday.
[1:26:07] And I said these words. The Lord spoke
[1:26:09] very clearly to me today while I was in
[1:26:11] prayer that some of us have settled on
[1:26:15] our leaves.
[1:26:18] I can't tell you how long it's been
[1:26:20] since I read that scripture or thought
[1:26:23] about the text.
[1:26:26] I do remember it on occasion,
[1:26:30] but because someone brings it up
[1:26:33] because I preached that in the late 80s
[1:26:36] and the early 90s across the country, I
[1:26:39] preached that text and when people are
[1:26:40] mentioning 12oot shuffle and one more
[1:26:44] night with the frogs and some of those
[1:26:45] sermons, there are those who will
[1:26:48] remember from the grape vine to the
[1:26:50] king's table. And that's where this text
[1:26:53] came from. But I hadn't thought of it in
[1:26:56] a long time. But he spoke to me that
[1:26:59] Wednesday morning very clearly in my
[1:27:01] office while I was in prayer. Some of us
[1:27:04] have settled on our lees.
[1:27:08] Now that disturbs me and I don't put
[1:27:11] myself in a category other than the same
[1:27:13] category that we're all in this morning.
[1:27:16] There there may 1,000%
[1:27:20] absolutely there may be lees dregs
[1:27:24] that I have settled on. And if that is
[1:27:28] the case, I want to repent before God
[1:27:30] today, not tomorrow. I want to repent
[1:27:34] before God today. And I want to make
[1:27:36] sure that I am willing and ready to be
[1:27:38] poured from vessel to vessel to vessel
[1:27:41] to vessel until there are no more dregs
[1:27:45] until there is no more leaves found in
[1:27:48] me. Jeremiah 48:11. Moab,
[1:27:52] if you'll just show us that Moab hath
[1:27:55] been at ease from his youth,
[1:27:59] and he hath settled on his lees,
[1:28:04] and hath not been emptied
[1:28:07] from vessel to vessel,
[1:28:10] neither hath he gone into captivity.
[1:28:14] Therefore, his taste remained in him,
[1:28:20] and his scent
[1:28:23] wasn't
[1:28:24] or is not changed.
[1:28:28] I'm going to read it again. Moab had
[1:28:30] been at ease from his youth, and he hath
[1:28:33] settled on his leaves, and had not been
[1:28:38] emptied, or poured from vessel to
[1:28:40] vessel, neither hath he gone into
[1:28:42] captivity. Therefore, his taste remained
[1:28:45] in him, and his scent is not changed.
[1:28:50] Pray with me just a moment. Father, we
[1:28:54] are here today not to see or to be seen.
[1:28:58] We've just got the same old clothes on
[1:29:00] we always wear, except I have a new tie
[1:29:03] somebody gave me. We're just This day is
[1:29:08] for many just an ordinary Sunday. But
[1:29:11] for me, it's more than that because I'm
[1:29:14] carrying something that I've got to get
[1:29:16] off of my heart, off my chest. I can't
[1:29:20] carry this by myself. I've got to get it
[1:29:23] out there. And we've got to as a body
[1:29:26] pray into it. And we need your help
[1:29:30] because the one thing we want to be is
[1:29:33] uh wine in in in your cup on your table.
[1:29:38] Yes. Everything we do, we want to we
[1:29:41] want to bring glory and sweetness and
[1:29:43] honor to you. We don't want to be a
[1:29:45] reproach.
[1:29:47] We don't want to, as Paul said, we don't
[1:29:50] want to go all the way and then become a
[1:29:52] cast away. A falling away with 99 and a
[1:29:56] half. We want to be a hundred. We want
[1:30:00] to go all the way. We don't want to stop
[1:30:02] at the bottom levels of the stature of a
[1:30:05] perfect man. We want to go all the way
[1:30:08] to the crowning of perfect love
[1:30:11] that releases the authority of the
[1:30:13] spoken creative word of God again for
[1:30:17] the bride.
[1:30:19] The example has been set for us and now
[1:30:22] we just want to be positioned and
[1:30:26] prepared for what is next. I can't do
[1:30:29] this without you, Lord, and I can't do
[1:30:31] this without the help of this
[1:30:33] congregation and these precious
[1:30:35] streamers. May we all be awakened by the
[1:30:38] spirit of inspiration a receive
[1:30:40] something from your hand. In the name of
[1:30:42] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. And the
[1:30:45] saint said, "Amen." You may be seated
[1:30:49] today. Don't please don't leave me.
[1:30:54] Stay with me. I can't tell you the years
[1:30:57] that uh have gone by that Charity and
[1:31:02] and some others have helped
[1:31:06] to
[1:31:08] put those scriptures up and the quotes
[1:31:11] and people have found it. I' I've had so
[1:31:14] many people, even streamers, say it's so
[1:31:16] helpful. I'm a visual learner. It helps
[1:31:19] me to see it, etc. My wife always says I
[1:31:23] get so much out of a message when there
[1:31:26] is some sort of uh demonstration or
[1:31:31] that's why the colt rack is still in
[1:31:32] here because that that kept our
[1:31:34] attention for a couple services and now
[1:31:36] I every time I think I'll put it back I
[1:31:39] think well I don't want anybody to think
[1:31:40] I'm moving the landmark
[1:31:43] but I don't want to leave it there
[1:31:45] forever either because some one of these
[1:31:47] precious girls said something about wow
[1:31:49] that coat rack is still there. That's an
[1:31:52] antique. I there they were a little
[1:31:55] bothered by the fact that it was still
[1:31:56] there or trying to understand it. But we
[1:31:59] have found that sometimes looking at the
[1:32:01] quote, especially with the broken
[1:32:03] English, it makes it more careful, more
[1:32:06] easy, excuse me, easier to catch.
[1:32:10] Uh, and I've not done any of that, but I
[1:32:13] tried this week to do a few slides just
[1:32:16] to make it a little bit easier. And it's
[1:32:18] because I want to tell you something
[1:32:20] about Moab.
[1:32:22] And I didn't want to go through it
[1:32:25] without you seeing it. And I didn't want
[1:32:27] to ask them to have to do all the work
[1:32:30] by themselves. So, uh, first of all,
[1:32:33] would you introduce the the title of the
[1:32:36] message because I've changed it a little
[1:32:38] bit. It used to be from the grape vine
[1:32:41] to the king's table, but today I want to
[1:32:44] call it from vine to vessel, the making
[1:32:47] of the king's wine.
[1:32:49] And I want to be that wine. I do. Uh we
[1:32:54] sing about the perfume poured out and
[1:32:57] the wine in worship. And I want to be
[1:33:00] that wine that brings pleasure and
[1:33:04] sweetness to the mouth of the king. I
[1:33:07] didn't make up the analogy. The Bible
[1:33:09] uses this analogy. We want to know
[1:33:12] something about Moab.
[1:33:14] And I don't know too much from memory. I
[1:33:17] I knew some things, but I didn't know
[1:33:19] nearly as much as I want to leave with
[1:33:21] you this morning. And we're going to do
[1:33:23] it very quickly. And that's why it's up
[1:33:25] here. That part has to go very quickly.
[1:33:27] Moab's comfort, according to Jeremiah
[1:33:30] 48, Moab's comfort had become its curse.
[1:33:35] Uh-huh.
[1:33:37] Now, you know, that's pretty serious.
[1:33:40] It had become its curse. And I want to I
[1:33:42] want us to think about who is Moab. You
[1:33:46] know, this is in Jeremiah.
[1:33:49] Jeremiah, what what time frame is he? Is
[1:33:52] he speaking about the specific Moab next
[1:33:55] next to to who is Moab?
[1:33:58] Uh is he speaking about Moab or the
[1:34:02] descendants of Moab? When we look at it,
[1:34:05] we find that Moab was a nation born out
[1:34:08] of compromise and shame.
[1:34:11] It descended from Lot through an
[1:34:15] incestuous relationship with his
[1:34:17] daughter after the destruction of Sodom.
[1:34:21] Genesis 19. Thus were both the daughters
[1:34:24] of Lot with child by their father, and
[1:34:26] the firstborn bear a son, and called his
[1:34:28] name Moab. the same is the father of the
[1:34:31] Moabites
[1:34:33] unto this day. When you hear the term
[1:34:36] Moabitete, what do you think of?
[1:34:39] You think of Ruth, who was a Moabitetish
[1:34:43] woman. And I tell you, not only did she
[1:34:47] come from the land of Moab, but she is
[1:34:50] the representation of real redemption.
[1:34:52] Amen. Amen. because she came from a less
[1:34:56] than noble people, but she joined
[1:34:59] herself to a noble God, to a real God.
[1:35:03] We're not going to serve any more of
[1:35:05] these other gods, Cheroth and and other
[1:35:08] gods that the Moab I'm going to find the
[1:35:10] God of Israel. He's mine. Your God will
[1:35:13] be my God. Your people will be my
[1:35:15] people. Wherever you go, I'll go and
[1:35:18] wherever you lodge, I'll lodge.
[1:35:21] This is powerful and important for us to
[1:35:24] remember because Ruth appears in the
[1:35:27] lineage
[1:35:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:35:31] A and by the way, so does another less
[1:35:34] than noble character by the name of
[1:35:37] Rahab.
[1:35:38] Amen. She might have had a a painful and
[1:35:43] loose past, but when it came to the
[1:35:46] nitty-gritty,
[1:35:48] you understand that kind of talk? She
[1:35:50] obeyed. Yes, sir. And God saved her
[1:35:54] house because of that scarlet thread. If
[1:35:58] you were to examine some of our
[1:36:00] pedigrees, you'd find out that some of
[1:36:02] us came from less than noble heritage.
[1:36:06] Oh, but thanks be to God, we don't have
[1:36:08] to be known by where we come from
[1:36:10] anymore.
[1:36:12] Not in the earth. We're known of having
[1:36:14] a citizenship that is far, far above
[1:36:17] this old world.
[1:36:19] Maybe there are slave owners, horse
[1:36:21] thieves, low down conniving skunk people
[1:36:25] in your life and in my past, in my
[1:36:28] heritage. I I don't even want to.
[1:36:30] Womanizers and we could go on, but
[1:36:34] that's not our true identity anymore.
[1:36:37] There was once a man connected to all of
[1:36:39] that. And guess what happened to him? He
[1:36:41] died. and a new man took his place who
[1:36:45] has an identity and a citizenship that
[1:36:48] is beyond this world. But how would you
[1:36:51] like to know that your heritage has come
[1:36:53] from from a from an incestuous
[1:36:56] relationship between Lot and his
[1:36:58] daughter? In fact, two of the major
[1:37:00] nations of the Old Testament are
[1:37:02] products of this vile sin that took
[1:37:06] place by getting their father drunk. And
[1:37:09] uh I don't want to speak about it
[1:37:10] anymore, but I wanted you to understand
[1:37:13] that when God is speaking through the
[1:37:15] prophet Jeremiah to the Mo to the Moab
[1:37:19] to Moab, he's speaking to the
[1:37:20] descendants of Moab who are still alive
[1:37:24] and who continue to be alive even to
[1:37:26] this day. Genesis 19:36-37
[1:37:31] is there. Though they were blood
[1:37:33] relatives to Israel, they often stood in
[1:37:36] opposition to God's people, refusing to
[1:37:40] help them in the wilderness and enticing
[1:37:43] them into sin. Here in Deuteronomy 23:3
[1:37:48] and 4, an Ammonite or Moabitete shall
[1:37:50] not enter into the congregation of the
[1:37:52] Lord. An Ammonite, that's the other
[1:37:54] nation, that's the other nation that
[1:37:58] came from this incestuous relationship.
[1:38:00] And here God is giving in the
[1:38:02] instructions. Neither an Ammonite or a
[1:38:05] Moabitete shall enter into the
[1:38:07] congregation of the Lord forever.
[1:38:10] Because they met you not with bread and
[1:38:12] with water in the way when you came
[1:38:15] forth out of Egypt and because they
[1:38:17] hired Balam the son of Bor of Por of
[1:38:21] Mesopotamia to curse thee. And God
[1:38:24] didn't forget it. He's got a better
[1:38:27] memory sometime than than most of any of
[1:38:30] us. Is that right? So Moab as a people,
[1:38:33] not as one man, represents a people who
[1:38:36] had proximity to the covenant, but no
[1:38:40] part in the power. They were cousins to
[1:38:44] the nation of Israel. They knew the
[1:38:47] covenant. In fact, they celebrated
[1:38:49] certain portions of the covenant, but
[1:38:52] they didn't understand the power of
[1:38:55] being in covenant with God. Is there
[1:38:58] anybody in this house that understands
[1:39:00] the power, the authority, the great
[1:39:04] grace that is ours because we have
[1:39:07] accepted this covenant.
[1:39:10] It It was a proposal in the wilderness.
[1:39:13] It was it was God from Mount Si saying
[1:39:16] to a nation of people, will you take me
[1:39:18] as your husband? And when that third
[1:39:22] Exodus took place and God sent a message
[1:39:24] to call us out, there was a similar
[1:39:28] invitation made.
[1:39:30] It's like in that uh Hebrew wedding
[1:39:33] ritual where the the young man will
[1:39:36] slide a glass of wine across the table
[1:39:40] and he will uh ask if she is willing
[1:39:45] and if she is willing to be a spouse to
[1:39:48] him. Now remember her parents have
[1:39:51] already had to approve this whole thing.
[1:39:54] He wouldn't even be sitting at the table
[1:39:55] if they hadn't put their stamp of
[1:39:57] approval on it. mama would have stopped
[1:40:00] him uh uh before he ever stepped across
[1:40:02] the threshold. But they have uh picked
[1:40:05] him and they've chosen him and but yet
[1:40:08] in this culture he had a he had a
[1:40:10] choice. She had a choice. He had a
[1:40:13] choice. They weren't forced even though
[1:40:16] the partner was arranged. He slides that
[1:40:21] cup of wine across the table and if she
[1:40:24] is going to say yes to the proposal, she
[1:40:27] will pick that up and she will take a
[1:40:29] sip of wine, put it down on the table,
[1:40:31] slide it back toward him, and he also
[1:40:33] will take the same cup and uh and and
[1:40:36] take a sip. And that is an ancient
[1:40:40] ceiling of a wedding covenant that says
[1:40:44] we're married. And according to brother
[1:40:46] Brandham, that kind of an agreement, not
[1:40:49] necessarily the wine and but the
[1:40:51] proposal and the acceptance of a
[1:40:53] proposal is is a contract.
[1:40:58] Before the vows are ever exchanged, I
[1:41:01] think the only reason why that should be
[1:41:03] ever emphasized or mentioned in this
[1:41:06] hour is just to again emphasize the
[1:41:10] importance of knowing you've got the
[1:41:11] right person. Now,
[1:41:16] Don't don't don't just ask her because
[1:41:18] you you know this it doesn't seem to be
[1:41:20] going anywhere. If it doesn't seem to be
[1:41:22] going anywhere, run.
[1:41:25] Don't don't you know experiment. I'm
[1:41:28] going to see maybe if we take this to
[1:41:30] the next level, then it'll go somewhere.
[1:41:33] Well, it might, but it might not go
[1:41:35] where it ought to go.
[1:41:37] So you need to know you need to you need
[1:41:40] to pray and you need to know from God
[1:41:43] what the next step is to be because if
[1:41:46] you make that covenant of agreeing uh
[1:41:48] then without without the the breaking of
[1:41:52] that covenant by the father it it
[1:41:54] becomes a complicated mess. I know that
[1:41:57] even in modern times I have dealt with
[1:42:00] the complications of that kind of thing.
[1:42:03] So, so Israel had an invitation for a
[1:42:06] wedding and the the instruction of the
[1:42:09] Torah became the cuba. It became the
[1:42:12] contract and God then has offered us the
[1:42:16] same kind of invitation. Will you come
[1:42:18] and be a covenant people with me?
[1:42:23] Because there is a church
[1:42:26] and there is a bride
[1:42:30] and only the bride will become the wife.
[1:42:34] The church has a role to play. We
[1:42:37] understand from scripture she has a role
[1:42:39] to play even in the millennium.
[1:42:42] And thank God for eternal life. However
[1:42:45] you get it. Of course there's only one
[1:42:47] way to get it. By the grace of God and
[1:42:49] by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:42:52] Not by being good to the bride.
[1:42:58] No. But it is a good thing to be good to
[1:43:00] the bride. Start practicing today.
[1:43:04] Hello. Look, look, look at your neighbor
[1:43:06] there. Be nice to her. Be nice to him.
[1:43:09] Start there.
[1:43:11] But but if we're going to preach it, I
[1:43:13] got to I got to really see it in the
[1:43:15] scripture. and and just saying that that
[1:43:17] you do to the least of my little ones.
[1:43:19] I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not finding uh a
[1:43:22] born again experience in that. Oh my I'm
[1:43:26] telling you, it's not just a belief
[1:43:29] system. You got to be born again.
[1:43:33] If if believing the truth was all it
[1:43:35] took, then the devil's already your
[1:43:37] brother
[1:43:38] because nobody believes this is the
[1:43:40] truth anymore than he does. In fact, the
[1:43:43] prophet told us, didn't he? if he would
[1:43:45] just repent Uhhuh. and be baptized in
[1:43:48] the name of Jesus Christ, he'd no longer
[1:43:50] be the devil. He'd be your brother.
[1:43:52] Somebody said, "I don't understand
[1:43:53] that." Here it is. It's the importance
[1:43:56] of the covenant.
[1:43:58] It's important. And and we are not a
[1:44:01] people uh of of culture. We are not a
[1:44:05] people of of an age. We are a people of
[1:44:09] the book. Yes. Our identity is directly
[1:44:14] linked to the scripture which is the
[1:44:17] written record of who God is. It's the
[1:44:20] Bible is the written record of God's
[1:44:23] word. And what was Jesus to us? He was
[1:44:27] that same word made flesh.
[1:44:31] There no need to argue over did they
[1:44:33] have the Old Testament? Did they have
[1:44:34] the New Testament? What epistle did they
[1:44:36] have? Early Christians, what did they
[1:44:38] get to read? There's no reason for us to
[1:44:41] even concern ourselves overly about
[1:44:43] that. God has given us a Bible. Men have
[1:44:47] died to preserve it, to put it in our
[1:44:49] hands. We have dozens of them. We have
[1:44:52] them in all forms of electronic. We have
[1:44:55] no excuse for not reading that word. And
[1:44:59] then God gave us a prophet messenger who
[1:45:02] who gives us revelation and insight on
[1:45:06] that word while telling us all along.
[1:45:09] Don't take my word for it. He says this
[1:45:12] over and over. Take it back to the
[1:45:15] scripture because he said we can make
[1:45:17] mistakes in this.
[1:45:22] These are the kind of things that happen
[1:45:23] when you're asking a man about a woman
[1:45:26] shaving her legs.
[1:45:29] All kinds of confusions can come.
[1:45:33] Or you're asking someone who's never
[1:45:35] been a Mason,
[1:45:37] doesn't know anything about the lodge
[1:45:39] really, if it's all right to be a a a a
[1:45:43] Mason and be a Christian. Well, if you
[1:45:45] don't know anything about it, you'd say,
[1:45:46] "Well, sure." He said, "Well, you can
[1:45:48] just be anything. You know, it doesn't
[1:45:49] matter. U Baptist, Methodist, or But
[1:45:52] folks, we know Freemasonry is not a
[1:45:55] denomination.
[1:45:58] See, there's a whole lot more to you. I
[1:46:00] don't certain times I need your amen.
[1:46:02] That wasn't one of them. Certain times,
[1:46:05] but not not that. I know that. I know
[1:46:07] that. I know that. I know. We can only
[1:46:09] speak of what we know. Now, Moab
[1:46:12] represented a people who had proximity
[1:46:14] to the covenant, but they had no part in
[1:46:15] its power. They were settled. That's
[1:46:18] exactly the word that Jeremiah used.
[1:46:20] They were settled, proud, and unbroken.
[1:46:24] And according to the analogy of wine
[1:46:27] making, they were never poured out from
[1:46:30] one vessel to another. When wine is
[1:46:32] made, it doesn't remain in the same
[1:46:34] vessel. From the crushing of the grape
[1:46:37] to the service of the table. It's
[1:46:39] actually poured from one vessel to
[1:46:41] another vessel to another vessel to
[1:46:43] another vessel. And each time leaves and
[1:46:47] dregs are left behind. And the wine is
[1:46:50] becoming purer,
[1:46:52] sweeter,
[1:46:54] more mature.
[1:46:56] Hello.
[1:46:57] More more suitable for the table of the
[1:47:00] King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[1:47:03] They they were at ease. Moab was a
[1:47:06] nation that didn't know the kind of
[1:47:08] conflict that Israel knew. Why? Because
[1:47:12] they weren't a people of the covenant.
[1:47:14] They weren't a people of the book in the
[1:47:17] same way that Israel was.
[1:47:20] And so they just had a kind of easy life
[1:47:23] like the modern church.
[1:47:27] Go to church on Sunday, sing till you
[1:47:28] feel good, have a little sermonet for a
[1:47:31] Christian who needs a bassinet.
[1:47:34] And then uh you know, don't forget to
[1:47:36] sing uh one or two things at the end.
[1:47:38] Say amen. Turn off the lights. A and go
[1:47:41] home.
[1:47:43] There's got to be more than that. When
[1:47:45] you wake up on Monday morning, you can't
[1:47:47] wake up a sinner. You've got to wake up
[1:47:50] just as committed to the King of Kings
[1:47:52] on Monday morning as you were to drag
[1:47:54] yourself to church on Sunday morning.
[1:47:56] This is a daybyday. I mean, it's a
[1:47:59] daybyday relationship with him.
[1:48:02] Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] And I want as brother brother Daniel was
[1:48:06] praying, I want that to become even a
[1:48:09] greater reality in my life. And if God
[1:48:12] has spoken, are you listening? If God
[1:48:15] has spoken over this church and said,
[1:48:18] "Some of you have settled,
[1:48:22] there's one thing I don't want to do is
[1:48:24] settle."
[1:48:27] Amen. The word of the Lord strike those
[1:48:31] arrows on the ground.
[1:48:36] He come short.
[1:48:38] He just thought, well, a little bit of
[1:48:40] symbolism is enough.
[1:48:43] Little bit of going through the motion
[1:48:45] is enough. But he got royally rebuked.
[1:48:48] The king did, didn't he? You ought to
[1:48:50] have kept beating them. You ought to
[1:48:52] have kept beating the ground until there
[1:48:54] were no more enemies left for Israel. We
[1:48:57] wouldn't be dealing with what we're
[1:48:59] dealing today if the king would have
[1:49:01] kept beating the ground. But he settled.
[1:49:04] And I cannot afford. I know I'm getting
[1:49:07] emotional. I cannot afford to settle
[1:49:11] now. I've got to go all the way. I've
[1:49:13] got to go all the way until there's no
[1:49:17] more religion hanging on us. But it's
[1:49:19] relationship.
[1:49:22] It's not a formalism. It's not some
[1:49:25] method. It's not three steps and you're
[1:49:27] there. It's giving up all the time.
[1:49:33] It's dead men walking that are going to
[1:49:36] see the kingdom.
[1:49:38] Alive but dead. Dead but alive.
[1:49:42] This ease caused them to lose their
[1:49:46] edge.
[1:49:48] Moab had enjoyed generations of unshaken
[1:49:52] ease, characterized by long periods of
[1:49:56] comfort and political stability, unlike
[1:49:58] Israel in Judah, which experienced war
[1:50:01] and captivity and exile. But it kept the
[1:50:04] people awake.
[1:50:07] Sometime a little pressure will keep you
[1:50:08] awake.
[1:50:10] Sometimes a little pressure will get you
[1:50:12] there. Sometimes a little pressure will
[1:50:14] get you to church on time. Sometime a
[1:50:17] little pressure will cause you to want
[1:50:19] to worship a little bit more than you
[1:50:20] would have worshiped had. Come on. We
[1:50:24] need it sometime. But this lack of
[1:50:27] hardship bred a stagnancy,
[1:50:31] pride, and a souring of spiritual
[1:50:33] flavor. Like unpoured wine, like wine
[1:50:36] that has not been poured from vessel to
[1:50:38] vessel. They settled on their leaves.
[1:50:41] They were undisturbed.
[1:50:44] And therefore,
[1:50:46] disturb us, Lord. Come on.
[1:50:50] Did you hear the prayer that Brother
[1:50:51] Daniel prayed? Shake us. Amen. You're
[1:50:54] you're sitting there. Maybe maybe you
[1:50:56] were maybe your knuckles getting white
[1:51:00] because you're holding on to the the pew
[1:51:02] beside you because you're thinking all
[1:51:05] of all things I'm asking for right now
[1:51:08] being shaken to my core is not one of
[1:51:10] them.
[1:51:14] But you know there was a purpose in the
[1:51:15] shaking. Yes, Hebrews tells us there's a
[1:51:18] purpose in the shaking because it's only
[1:51:21] in the shaking that the revelation comes
[1:51:24] of that which cannot be shaken.
[1:51:27] There is something that cannot be moved.
[1:51:30] This little bride cannot be moved off
[1:51:33] the word.
[1:51:37] This Bible is her uh it is her anchor
[1:51:41] post and this message is the road map.
[1:51:45] No doubt about it. It is a road mapap to
[1:51:48] us to help us understand what we read in
[1:51:52] that word. But we can't go beyond the
[1:51:56] word.
[1:51:58] I know that makes people nervous
[1:52:00] and that's why they make these foolish
[1:52:02] statements that everything a prophet
[1:52:06] said was thus sayaith the Lord. That's
[1:52:08] nowhere in the Bible for any other
[1:52:10] prophet.
[1:52:13] That would throw the whole thing out of
[1:52:15] cater. If you strike it another time
[1:52:18] instead of speaking it to it, speaking
[1:52:20] to it, you miss the whole uh cater or
[1:52:23] the whole continuity of it. It has to
[1:52:26] fit the scripture. It's no more
[1:52:29] scriptural than a return ministry. The
[1:52:32] return ministry is not a single
[1:52:34] resurrected prophet. The return ministry
[1:52:37] is a generation of people who won't
[1:52:40] believe it because they were born to it
[1:52:43] or inherited it from their parents, but
[1:52:46] they have had their own taste, their own
[1:52:51] taste of the original mana.
[1:52:55] If my children have any hope of making
[1:52:58] the rapture, it won't be because they're
[1:53:01] my children. And it won't be because
[1:53:04] they believe what I believe. It'll only
[1:53:06] believe be possible because they have
[1:53:09] tasted the original mana. They have had
[1:53:12] their own experience with the pillar of
[1:53:15] fire. Changed
[1:53:18] feeling won't change you, but a but a
[1:53:21] meeting with God
[1:53:24] will change you. Where do we meet him?
[1:53:27] Well, we meet him in his word, but we
[1:53:30] don't meet him with a carnal amen.
[1:53:33] One that comes as lip service. We only
[1:53:35] encounter him with an eternal amen. One
[1:53:38] that comes from the inner man that says,
[1:53:40] "Oh, God, it ain't always easy, but
[1:53:42] amen. I may miss it sometime, but amen.
[1:53:46] I may stumble along the way, but I'm
[1:53:48] saying amen." So be it anyhow.
[1:53:52] That's the only thing that will keep us
[1:53:54] out of some of this complacency.
[1:53:57] It used to be that I could travel around
[1:53:59] and preach this comfortably other places
[1:54:02] because I was an evangelist.
[1:54:04] It's a little harder to bring such a
[1:54:07] thought to your own church.
[1:54:10] But I didn't say it. I believe he said
[1:54:12] it. Maybe there's only one around here,
[1:54:14] but that's not the way it seemed to be
[1:54:16] expressed. I think in one way or another
[1:54:20] all of us have settled for something and
[1:54:24] you you and I need to know better. We
[1:54:27] don't want to settle for just a piece of
[1:54:31] of bread.
[1:54:33] You know, they're asking about other
[1:54:35] churches and he's saying, "Well, you you
[1:54:38] uh if you can't get a loaf, you get a
[1:54:39] slice." Well, that was another age alto
[1:54:42] together. I I can't survive by just a
[1:54:45] slice. I've got to have it all. I've got
[1:54:48] to be willing to eat it all. What I
[1:54:50] don't understand, I eat it anyway. And I
[1:54:53] believe that God is able to weave it
[1:54:55] through the scripture to us. Has to be
[1:54:57] that way. Has to be written somewhere.
[1:55:00] Has to be represented somewhere in that
[1:55:03] word. If you believe that, not if you
[1:55:05] don't, but if you believe that, say
[1:55:07] amen.
[1:55:13] Well, you don't have to be so negative.
[1:55:17] I'd have to be pretty negative to
[1:55:20] balance out
[1:55:22] some of the ridiculous things
[1:55:25] that are said on social media
[1:55:28] about perfect prophets and perfect
[1:55:30] sermons and perfect messages and perfect
[1:55:33] this and perfect that. Let me tell you
[1:55:35] something. When perfect love comes,
[1:55:41] we won't need a lot of other stuff. and
[1:55:45] without it will not make the rapture. So
[1:55:48] if you can't love the weird one,
[1:55:52] if you can't love the one in the church
[1:55:54] that's a little less in in in social
[1:55:57] skill than you,
[1:56:01] many people are the product of this
[1:56:02] generation.
[1:56:04] Somebody proudly says, "I have ADHD."
[1:56:07] And we could just say to them, "Welcome
[1:56:09] to the club." That's right. Because by
[1:56:11] those definitions, the definitions that
[1:56:13] are given, we all have trouble with our
[1:56:16] attention span.
[1:56:18] The only part I don't seem to struggle
[1:56:20] with is I don't have a whole lot of
[1:56:22] hyperactivity.
[1:56:25] That must only be for children. I wish I
[1:56:28] had a little more. Well, it said you're
[1:56:30] getting kind of carried away this
[1:56:31] morning. Yes, but I I don't I don't have
[1:56:33] that extra energy, but I do struggle
[1:56:35] sometime to focus like we all do. We
[1:56:38] have become products of a generation
[1:56:41] that has exchanged relationship for
[1:56:44] electronics.
[1:56:47] Just a minute. Amen.
[1:56:50] I mean, for crying out loud, we text one
[1:56:53] another in the same house.
[1:56:56] That's all right to do if you need TP.
[1:57:02] If there's no more on the roll
[1:57:07] and you and you can't scream loud
[1:57:09] enough, okay, then text.
[1:57:13] But if you
[1:57:15] if you can crawl to the door, peek out
[1:57:20] and say, "Hey,
[1:57:24] if if there's something you can tell
[1:57:26] somebody faith, go do it." Don't don't
[1:57:29] be totally reshaped and remolded. We get
[1:57:33] to life gets so easy. Lord have mercy.
[1:57:36] I'm so old that I remember preaching
[1:57:39] this about microwave popcorn which
[1:57:41] nobody would eat today.
[1:57:44] We all know better than that junk today.
[1:57:47] But that was a kind of convenient. I
[1:57:49] remember thinking, "Oh yeah, we used to
[1:57:51] have a home-cooked meal. Now we go
[1:57:52] through the drive-thru."
[1:57:54] Well, yeah, but now we go through the
[1:57:56] drive-thru and we don't even get food.
[1:58:00] We we get, you know, so genetically
[1:58:03] modified cardboard or whatever it
[1:58:05] sometimes is that it it'll last on the
[1:58:08] shelf for years.
[1:58:10] Come on. It gets worse and worse. This
[1:58:13] little bride we can't get easy. We can't
[1:58:16] get lazy. We can't settle on our lees.
[1:58:22] Look, folks, we can't do nothing about
[1:58:25] our faith and then uh uh well, I'm
[1:58:28] hoping and believing for my children.
[1:58:33] If you're concerned about your children,
[1:58:35] check up on your relationship
[1:58:39] with a covenantkeeping God.
[1:58:43] Well, I'm really burdened for my
[1:58:44] coworker. How long has it been since
[1:58:46] you've had a little conviction burden
[1:58:48] for yourself?
[1:58:50] Now, that's a strange thing to say
[1:58:52] because we're supposed to carry a burden
[1:58:55] for others. But some people will replace
[1:58:58] concern for others.
[1:59:02] They had rather be concerned about
[1:59:04] somebody else than to see their own
[1:59:07] need. Oh, God, don't ever let us get so
[1:59:11] super spiritual that we can't see our
[1:59:13] own need.
[1:59:16] And the reality is, I'm not talking
[1:59:18] about working more and striving more and
[1:59:22] being more religious. I'm talking about
[1:59:25] being more sincere. I'm talking about
[1:59:28] making up your mind. You're not just
[1:59:30] going to testify about it. You're going
[1:59:33] to do it.
[1:59:36] I'm going to do it. What is it? I'm
[1:59:40] going to push you a little harder. I'm
[1:59:43] going to hear what a prophet said.
[1:59:44] You've gone as far with God as you're
[1:59:46] ever going to go till you pay a greater
[1:59:48] price. You're not paying for salvation.
[1:59:50] It's paid for. You're paying. You're
[1:59:53] giving of yourself. You're reading the
[1:59:56] word every day like he told us. Praying
[1:59:59] every day. And and just asking for your
[2:00:02] Santa Claus list does not qualify as
[2:00:05] praying every day. Amen. Communion is
[2:00:09] what I'm talking about.
[2:00:12] Communion is more than a piece of bread
[2:00:14] and a cup of wine. Communion is a is a
[2:00:18] daily fellowship with him. And here's
[2:00:22] the reality, Sister Flo. He misses
[2:00:24] fellowship with me
[2:00:27] sometimes faster
[2:00:30] than I recognize
[2:00:32] my need to have fellowship with him.
[2:00:35] Can you imagine that?
[2:00:38] He desires, the Lefontines wrote, he
[2:00:42] desires to have fellowship
[2:00:45] with me
[2:00:47] with me. Well, that's good for pastors.
[2:00:49] No,
[2:00:52] it's good for believers.
[2:00:55] It's good for believers.
[2:00:58] It's good for believers.
[2:01:00] Hallelujah.
[2:01:02] You get hungry, a little desperate, a
[2:01:04] little little hungry for him. It'll make
[2:01:05] you want to turn off Netflix.
[2:01:10] Well, I heard a good sermon this week.
[2:01:12] Good. Hear another one.
[2:01:16] Now, you don't do it with this attitude.
[2:01:18] I've got to measure up. I've got to
[2:01:19] measure up. I've got No, no, no. But the
[2:01:22] scripture tells us in Hebrews, we strive
[2:01:25] to enter into rest.
[2:01:27] Once we get a revelation of where our
[2:01:29] rest is found, it's not found in a
[2:01:32] 24-hour day of the week.
[2:01:35] It's not found by not lighting a fire or
[2:01:38] kindling a candle or whatever it is you
[2:01:40] do. That's not how you find the rest.
[2:01:42] You find the rest by taking God at his
[2:01:45] word.
[2:01:46] He's literally crying to his bride in
[2:01:49] this hour. Let me do it. Amen. Get your
[2:01:54] hands off, your mind off your mouth, off
[2:01:59] the situation and surrender your will.
[2:02:04] You don't have to figure it out. You
[2:02:06] don't have to solve the problem. You
[2:02:09] just have to get out of the way.
[2:02:12] Just get out of the way and let him show
[2:02:14] you how much he loves you. Let him show
[2:02:17] you that now is the time to seek him
[2:02:20] because now is the time that he is
[2:02:22] seeking you. He's no longer seeking you
[2:02:25] to win you or to draw you to salvation.
[2:02:29] He's now seeking you for fellowship,
[2:02:33] for intimacy.
[2:02:35] Are you here? It's only in that intimacy
[2:02:39] that that personal relationship with
[2:02:42] Jesus Christ behind the veil The veil
[2:02:46] drops. He said the world is shut out and
[2:02:50] you are shut in. You and him. You're in
[2:02:55] a tent. That's where your your nuptual
[2:02:59] is sealed symbolically. Amen.
[2:03:03] That's where the tokens of virginity are
[2:03:06] produced symbolically.
[2:03:09] Amen. In that place, you can't leave
[2:03:12] that place the same. You may step in as
[2:03:16] bride. You leave as wife.
[2:03:20] Wife carries a different kind of
[2:03:22] authority
[2:03:23] than an espouseed bride. The wife can
[2:03:27] sign her name.
[2:03:31] Ms. Jesus Christ and it has the same
[2:03:35] authority
[2:03:37] that the bridegroom's name has. It is
[2:03:40] his name, but it's yours because you're
[2:03:43] the you're the you're the other part of
[2:03:45] that. This truth is more than some
[2:03:49] colloquialisms or some little little,
[2:03:52] you know, funny little things, little
[2:03:54] catchy phrases and thing. Oh, it's so
[2:03:56] much more. He's looking for so much
[2:03:58] more.
[2:04:00] I don't want to pick on anybody. I don't
[2:04:01] want to I don't want to embarrass
[2:04:03] anybody for the good or the bad, but
[2:04:05] Jubel, I'm going to pick on you a little
[2:04:07] bit and it's going to be good.
[2:04:11] I saw you this morning.
[2:04:14] I saw you. It matters. I noticed. I want
[2:04:18] you to know, son. I noticed.
[2:04:23] That's That's a big deal because I love
[2:04:25] you. But there's a bigger deal.
[2:04:30] Papa saw it. He saw you push a little
[2:04:33] harder. He saw your eyes fill up with
[2:04:36] tears when you were worshiping. Very few
[2:04:39] young men that age want to be seen with
[2:04:41] tears.
[2:04:44] But I'm convinced. I'm convinced that if
[2:04:48] we don't get out from under the image
[2:04:50] that the world is portraying,
[2:04:54] and get tender before God,
[2:04:57] let me tell you something. If you
[2:04:58] sisters have a problem with your husband
[2:05:00] weeping before the Lord, you've got a
[2:05:02] bigger problem than I thought.
[2:05:05] That ought to be your delight. Amen. You
[2:05:07] ought to run up the street telling all
[2:05:09] the neighbors, "I've got a husband that
[2:05:12] is in touch with God." It makes a
[2:05:14] difference. It'll change him from being
[2:05:17] a religious fanatic. It'll change him
[2:05:19] from being a brandite to a follower of
[2:05:22] Jesus Christ.
[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:26] Oh yes.
[2:05:28] It It'll give him what he's been longing
[2:05:30] for. and he and he tries to think that
[2:05:33] uh that what he's had is all that he
[2:05:35] wants, but his complacency is showing.
[2:05:39] My complacency shows sometime. The word
[2:05:43] of the Lord said they're settled on
[2:05:46] their leaves.
[2:05:48] It's going to make the wine bitter
[2:05:52] and it's going to change the scent, the
[2:05:55] aroma. Now, I'm not a wine connoisseur.
[2:06:00] I don't drink a little wine every day
[2:06:02] for the stomach's sake. I don't drink it
[2:06:05] to unwind or relax.
[2:06:08] There are spiritually appropriate times
[2:06:10] to taste wine.
[2:06:13] And I have found uh that I I
[2:06:19] well I don't want to say this but make
[2:06:21] it sound like
[2:06:24] she's a wino or something but my wife
[2:06:28] she likes that taste of of the of the
[2:06:30] wine.
[2:06:32] Boy, that
[2:06:35] I I I thought I could I used to could
[2:06:37] say that and maybe maybe this is a
[2:06:39] different she she she Well, brother
[2:06:42] Brandham said, let let me make her more
[2:06:44] spiritual than you were trying to make
[2:06:46] her in your mind. Brother Brandham said,
[2:06:48] "You ought not." He said, "No, no." He
[2:06:49] said, "I don't eat anything
[2:06:52] after I've taken communion." Because he
[2:06:54] said, "I want the taste of that." And
[2:06:56] he's speaking spiritually, but he said,
[2:06:58] "I want the taste of that to linger on
[2:07:00] my tongue. I have to watch my wife at
[2:07:03] Passover when it comes to her rose. You
[2:07:05] know, she likes that fl doesn't matter.
[2:07:07] We We don't have to like it or not like
[2:07:08] it. That's not what we're talking about.
[2:07:10] The king likes it. The king likes it.
[2:07:13] And Moab was producing some wine that
[2:07:16] stunk
[2:07:18] because it had not been emptied off the
[2:07:21] dregs.
[2:07:23] It had not been poured out from the
[2:07:26] leaves.
[2:07:28] That that is the sediment that is left
[2:07:30] behind.
[2:07:32] It's an interesting thing. I've got to
[2:07:34] go on.
[2:07:37] What do you mean go on? Is it about time
[2:07:38] to stop? It is not.
[2:07:43] Moab typifies carnal religion, untried
[2:07:47] comfort, or passive resistance to
[2:07:49] refinement. God's judgment through
[2:07:52] Babylon would ultimately dismantle this
[2:07:56] illusion of safety that Moab was living
[2:07:58] under. God was giving Moab in Jeremiah
[2:08:02] 48 an opportunity
[2:08:04] to pour to be poured out,
[2:08:08] to separate yourself from that which
[2:08:11] makes you bitter,
[2:08:13] from that which makes you untasty,
[2:08:17] from that which causes you to stink. But
[2:08:20] Moab was stubborn
[2:08:24] and she was not willing to hear the word
[2:08:28] of the Lord. So God always has something
[2:08:32] to come rushing in. This time it was
[2:08:35] Babylon. And Babylon shook Moab to the
[2:08:40] core. And God took responsibility for
[2:08:44] it.
[2:08:45] Babylon was God's judgment on Moab
[2:08:49] because she liked her comfort, her ease.
[2:08:54] She liked her flavor. She was proud of
[2:08:58] her aroma. She was not willing to be
[2:09:00] poured from vessel to vessel.
[2:09:03] This judgment was based on spiritual
[2:09:06] stagnation. And Moab enjoyed ease
[2:09:08] without surrender, ease without
[2:09:11] transformation.
[2:09:13] We must have both.
[2:09:16] Who who who realizes? Anybody recognize
[2:09:20] I've got to make a full surrender. And
[2:09:23] and and I think I have before, but
[2:09:25] somehow I took the reigns. Somehow I
[2:09:28] took the wheel again. And here I am
[2:09:32] trying to co-pilot my life with Jesus.
[2:09:36] I'm trying to ride the horse with Jesus.
[2:09:39] Him holding one reign, I'm holding the
[2:09:41] other. But the reality is we've got to
[2:09:44] get out of the front seat. We we've got
[2:09:46] to get we've got to get up from behind.
[2:09:49] And we're not co-piloting. We're
[2:09:51] surrendering. We're submitting. We're
[2:09:54] letting his life come and drive us, push
[2:09:58] through us and for us. He He wants us.
[2:10:02] He wants fellowship with us that cannot
[2:10:06] take on the richness of his design. If
[2:10:10] there are still dregs
[2:10:13] hanging around in our life, if our
[2:10:16] spirit has become bittered, imbittered
[2:10:20] bitter. If resentment and blame,
[2:10:24] I don't have time for someone who only
[2:10:28] blames someone else in a two-part
[2:10:31] conflict. I'm not that stupid.
[2:10:35] I'm not. I've been in enough conflicts
[2:10:38] myself to know.
[2:10:44] You might have started it,
[2:10:46] but I didn't fix it. I didn't help it.
[2:10:50] Now, that makes me as guilty as you.
[2:10:53] Vice versa. I didn't do the right thing
[2:10:56] about it. You didn't do the right thing
[2:10:58] about it, maybe. And it just hangs
[2:11:00] there. The problem is it doesn't torment
[2:11:03] us or harass us maybe anymore. But it is
[2:11:06] slightly affecting the quality
[2:11:09] of our life, the aroma of our life, the
[2:11:14] taste of our life. When we give
[2:11:16] ourselves to the king, don't you want
[2:11:18] him to say, "That's the best my my my
[2:11:21] that's the best wine I've ever tasted."
[2:11:24] Don't you want him to swirl the bouquet
[2:11:27] and and say that praise that worship
[2:11:30] you're giving me is not it's not will
[2:11:32] worship. It's not it's not conformed
[2:11:35] praise. It's not following the crowd
[2:11:39] praise. It's not taking on the spirit of
[2:11:41] your pastor praise. It's coming from
[2:11:45] your heart and it and it tastes
[2:11:47] delicious and it smells amazing. That's
[2:11:51] the kind of wine we want to become.
[2:11:56] Oh,
[2:11:58] on the table of the Lord. Amen.
[2:12:01] Their taste remained. Their scent was
[2:12:03] unchanged. They were spiritually
[2:12:04] spoiled. Now, I want to quickly just
[2:12:07] make this comparison between Moab and
[2:12:09] another and another name, another
[2:12:11] another people that we're familiar with.
[2:12:14] And I have to do this. I haven't even
[2:12:16] preach. Oh my. Let me just not explain
[2:12:18] but talk, but but preach it. Let me give
[2:12:20] it to you. There's a comparison that we
[2:12:22] can draw uh between Moab and Leodysia.
[2:12:29] Wouldn't this preach if you had the time
[2:12:31] and you could and you were a preacher? I
[2:12:34] might not even be that. But but here
[2:12:36] here is the comparison quickly and it's
[2:12:38] big and I I had more than this and I
[2:12:42] just had to whittle it down. But God was
[2:12:44] not angry over the sins of commission
[2:12:47] for Moab or Leodysia. He was upset about
[2:12:51] what they were leaving undone.
[2:12:53] He was concerned about what they were
[2:12:55] omitting more than what they were
[2:12:58] committing.
[2:13:00] That was the same Moab. both people who
[2:13:03] appear religious but no longer
[2:13:05] passionately seek him. That's the
[2:13:08] Moabites.
[2:13:10] That's the Leodysans. And that's the
[2:13:12] spirit of the age. And if you think it
[2:13:15] won't touch somebody that belongs to
[2:13:16] him, if you think that spirit of
[2:13:19] Leodysia won't try to creep in a church,
[2:13:21] if you think that cold lukewarm, we
[2:13:24] shouldn't even say cold, that lukewarm
[2:13:26] thing, it won't try to get on you as a
[2:13:28] believer, you're terribly wrong. It'll
[2:13:30] try. you know, you're not a real
[2:13:32] candidate for it, but it'll hijack your
[2:13:34] life. It'll get on you and you'll get
[2:13:37] settled in your leaves and you'll become
[2:13:39] lukewarm
[2:13:41] and you'll end up being the puke out of
[2:13:43] his mouth.
[2:13:46] You heard me though, didn't you? He
[2:13:48] said, "I would rather you be hot or
[2:13:50] cold." But the lukewarm I will spew out
[2:13:54] of my mouth. Maybe you're too refined on
[2:13:57] to even understand the analogy. But I
[2:14:00] had some time on the farm with my papa
[2:14:03] and I know what water gets like
[2:14:06] when it sits all day in the sun. Shade.
[2:14:09] What shade? There was no shade. I would
[2:14:11] have had to be the shade. And I
[2:14:13] certainly was going to get to stand in
[2:14:15] one spot all day and keep the water cool
[2:14:18] because we were too busy digging sweet
[2:14:19] potatoes, which we never called a potato
[2:14:22] in my life. We only said sweet taters.
[2:14:25] That's all they were ever called. Then
[2:14:28] you you you're so you you beg you had to
[2:14:30] beg for a for a a break.
[2:14:33] You know, papa only was a a few day a
[2:14:36] week farmer and and he had to come back
[2:14:37] to work his other job and you got to get
[2:14:40] this done and and please let me have
[2:14:43] some water. All right. Go over there and
[2:14:45] you we left it at the end of the row.
[2:14:47] You go get it. You take a big sip sip of
[2:14:49] it. You don't want it. that that
[2:14:51] temperature I don't know if you would
[2:14:54] call it tepid tepid temp I don't know
[2:14:56] what you would say but it not cold not
[2:14:57] hot you get that down and if you drink
[2:15:00] too much he'd scream out don't drink too
[2:15:02] much tater bug I was little I was young
[2:15:06] don't drink too much tater bug you'll be
[2:15:09] be sick
[2:15:11] you drink too much of that lukewarm
[2:15:13] water and it'll go down and it'll start
[2:15:14] churning around Jesus using this same
[2:15:17] analogy I'd rather you be cold I'd
[2:15:20] rather weather, you'll be hot. That's
[2:15:22] right. Here it is. Revelation 3 uh in
[2:15:24] Jeremiah 48:11, we read it. Moabath been
[2:15:27] at ease from his youth. Leodysia.
[2:15:29] Revelation 3:15 through17. I know thy
[2:15:32] works that thou art neither cold nor
[2:15:33] hot. I would thou work cold or hot. So
[2:15:35] then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[2:15:37] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[2:15:39] out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I
[2:15:41] am rich and increased with goods, and
[2:15:43] have need of nothing, and knowest not
[2:15:45] that thou art wretched, and miserable,
[2:15:48] and poor, and blind, and naked. And of
[2:15:51] course, that certainly uh it certainly
[2:15:53] applies to to a church world out there.
[2:15:57] But I'm telling you that same kind of
[2:15:59] spirit,
[2:16:02] you and I have to overcome what? The
[2:16:05] spirit of the agemen.
[2:16:09] That means that spirit will creep in
[2:16:13] and try to make your wine bitter. Come
[2:16:16] on.
[2:16:18] It'll try to make your offering.
[2:16:21] It's not your wine.
[2:16:24] You're in service of the king.
[2:16:27] He'll try to make you stink in his
[2:16:29] nostrils. You've got to beat that
[2:16:31] lukewarm spirit back with all the
[2:16:34] strength you've got left in you. And so
[2:16:36] do I. Both both groups took this
[2:16:40] stillness or or or what looked like
[2:16:43] peace and calmness. They took it as
[2:16:45] spiritual health. Moab thought a lack of
[2:16:48] disruption was favor. Oh, as long as
[2:16:51] everything is all right, I'm I'm a happy
[2:16:53] man. As long as the kids aren't fighting
[2:16:55] and the wife is happy
[2:16:59] and the bills are paid and the truck is
[2:17:01] running, I'm a happy man. Don't you
[2:17:05] misunderstand.
[2:17:06] You'll go through seasons of h of of
[2:17:09] what looks like no troubles and peace
[2:17:12] and so forth. Don't always interpret
[2:17:14] that as as if God were pleased
[2:17:18] with your offering.
[2:17:21] 1 Corinthians chapter 10 talks about the
[2:17:23] wanderings of the children of Israel,
[2:17:24] doesn't it? They all ate the same mana.
[2:17:28] I know you're tired. I understand. Of
[2:17:31] course you are. You should be. You would
[2:17:33] be, but a little more unless you want to
[2:17:36] come back tonight.
[2:17:38] Uh, you all ate the same mana
[2:17:41] and you all drank the same spiritual
[2:17:44] drink. You drank of that rock that
[2:17:46] followed you and that rock was Christ.
[2:17:48] Pretty powerful revelation.
[2:17:51] Verse five, but with many of them
[2:17:55] God was not well pleased.
[2:17:58] Please, we know Nathan is tired. We hear
[2:18:01] him. Uh please don't mistake
[2:18:06] this idea that because your bills are
[2:18:09] paid and you're favored on your job that
[2:18:14] it's necessarily a sign
[2:18:18] that says God is pleased with your
[2:18:21] devotion and with your worship.
[2:18:25] Sometimes we go through seasonings
[2:18:27] seasons of of calmness.
[2:18:32] It's it's it's the eb and the flow of
[2:18:36] life.
[2:18:38] It can also be the eb and the flow of
[2:18:41] Christianity.
[2:18:43] No. No. Discern. Seek the Lord. Pray and
[2:18:48] ask him. Is this because you're favoring
[2:18:52] me in this hour or is this because I'm
[2:18:54] just in one of those seasons? Because if
[2:18:56] I'm just in a season of calmness and my
[2:18:59] life is not bringing you pleasure a and
[2:19:02] honor, then Lord, I I'd rather have a
[2:19:05] little heart. I'd rather have a little
[2:19:06] shaking.
[2:19:08] I'd rather have a little squeeze. I'd
[2:19:10] rather have a little press. If this uh
[2:19:13] overdue rapture is somehow causing any
[2:19:17] of us to get comfortable while Leodysia
[2:19:20] surrounds us, we ought to shake
[2:19:23] ourselves. We don't want to get
[2:19:25] comfortable with the delayed rapture and
[2:19:27] miss and miss our opportunity to be the
[2:19:31] finest wine.
[2:19:37] The wine the king deserves.
[2:19:40] God saw stagnancy
[2:19:43] in both Moab and Leodysia nonstability.
[2:19:46] Both were warned with strong language.
[2:19:48] God said to Moab, "I'll send unto him
[2:19:51] wanderers that shall cause him
[2:19:57] to wander."
[2:19:59] If you don't think the enemy will try to
[2:20:01] send wanderers into your life,
[2:20:09] he will try to send wanderers into your
[2:20:13] life.
[2:20:14] untamed
[2:20:17] wanderers.
[2:20:19] His ultimate goal
[2:20:21] to cause you to wander.
[2:20:24] We have to have patience, folks. We have
[2:20:26] to have patience with one another. It's
[2:20:27] not easy,
[2:20:30] but we do. If someone comes among us,
[2:20:33] you you you and I have no right to
[2:20:37] decide or determine how long we're going
[2:20:40] to give them.
[2:20:44] and need some help to conform.
[2:20:48] That's not our decision.
[2:20:50] Uh what we do want to do is discern if
[2:20:53] God has brought them to truth and is he
[2:20:56] leading them along or have they been
[2:20:58] sent as wanderers
[2:21:01] to influence you to wander?
[2:21:06] Going to be quiet now. Your standard
[2:21:09] doesn't come from the pew beside you.
[2:21:12] Your standard comes from the word.
[2:21:17] Cuz wanderers will come.
[2:21:21] Oh yes.
[2:21:26] Sister Nancy in Jerusalem.
[2:21:29] We introduced the message of the hour to
[2:21:31] her. Baptized her in the name of Jesus.
[2:21:34] She stepped aside from her
[2:21:38] pastoral work and uh
[2:21:42] loved the message, played the tapes, and
[2:21:46] she heard Brother Brandham talking about
[2:21:51] closedin shoes,
[2:21:54] which uh I I kind of like them, you
[2:21:57] know, too. Oldfashioned, I get it.
[2:22:02] And uh one day I was on tour with some
[2:22:05] of the seniors
[2:22:07] and I took off my socks. I you know the
[2:22:11] only appropriate place to wear socks and
[2:22:13] sandals I think is Germany and Israel.
[2:22:16] So I had on I had on hiking socks and
[2:22:20] and uh Israeli sandals. And I took off
[2:22:24] my socks and put my feet in the water.
[2:22:27] And God forbid
[2:22:30] I didn't put my socks back on.
[2:22:34] This is minor, believe me, for for most
[2:22:36] folks. But Sister Nancy is a purist.
[2:22:40] She's just beginning to understand.
[2:22:43] And all she knows is the quote said, you
[2:22:46] know, that was in her heart. She wasn't
[2:22:47] trying to be critical. Uh although she
[2:22:51] got a stern I think she got a stern
[2:22:53] answer. Maybe she shouldn't have had
[2:22:54] such a stern answer. I don't know why
[2:22:56] her pastor would have done that to her,
[2:22:58] but she said, "Uh, uh, Brother Shel, I I
[2:23:01] I'm not meaning to judge or condemn, but
[2:23:04] she said, "I would like to mention the
[2:23:06] fact that I I I I see you didn't put
[2:23:09] your socks back on." She said, "Wouldn't
[2:23:11] that fall under such and such a quote
[2:23:13] and and so forth, and wouldn't that
[2:23:15] really wouldn't that be really like
[2:23:17] going against the word you've heard and
[2:23:19] so forth?" And I said, "Now, just hold
[2:23:21] it right there.
[2:23:23] These are different circumstances than
[2:23:25] the circumstances that I have at home.
[2:23:27] First of all, number one. And number
[2:23:30] two, if I thought
[2:23:33] that going for a little while without my
[2:23:37] socks was going to affect my
[2:23:40] spirituality or my relationship with the
[2:23:44] Lord,
[2:23:46] I wouldn't do it.
[2:23:49] But I have come to understand that life
[2:23:52] happens
[2:23:54] and my satisfaction can no longer be
[2:23:57] found in some rule.
[2:24:01] It must be by conviction.
[2:24:06] Now the next morning I got dressed and
[2:24:08] guess I put my socks back on.
[2:24:12] You see, we can't be so legal
[2:24:16] that we decide someone who has come for
[2:24:19] oh, let's say three years, they ought to
[2:24:21] be towing the line. Would you just hear
[2:24:25] the Lord
[2:24:27] and would you just ask him to show you
[2:24:30] as I am asking him to show me? Are there
[2:24:32] any drags?
[2:24:36] I'm not in any way suggesting
[2:24:38] compromise. Oh, no. I just feel like
[2:24:41] there are bigger things that we could be
[2:24:43] concerned about than a little tower.
[2:24:52] I truly believe that it would be better
[2:24:55] if everybody just looks internal.
[2:25:00] Amen.
[2:25:02] If someone's hair barret is a little
[2:25:04] fancier than you like, don't ever buy
[2:25:07] one like it.
[2:25:11] And don't follow the trend.
[2:25:14] Don't let me see you needing a dozen
[2:25:16] just like it. You don't like them. Leave
[2:25:19] them alone. We must not I'm giving you
[2:25:22] balance. We must not get caught up in
[2:25:27] the logistics
[2:25:29] and miss the fact. I want to tell you
[2:25:32] something. I don't think going without
[2:25:33] your socks is making your wine bitter.
[2:25:36] It's that resentment. It's that
[2:25:38] unforgiveness. It's that envy that we
[2:25:41] still deal with on a regular basis. It's
[2:25:44] that it's that shifting blame. It's it's
[2:25:47] the other things that God is dealing
[2:25:49] with us about through the series of
[2:25:52] offense. It's offense that we carry.
[2:25:56] I it it's judging someone's motive. We
[2:26:00] think we know why they do it. I have
[2:26:03] been shocked at times to find out that
[2:26:06] what I thought was the reason
[2:26:09] that someone did something.
[2:26:12] You know, we get to a place where we
[2:26:14] think everyone thinks like us. Everyone
[2:26:15] processes life like us and we we think
[2:26:18] there's like a conspiracy plot
[2:26:24] why she handed her a piece of graduation
[2:26:28] cake before she handed it to me. And and
[2:26:31] I know what that means. You do.
[2:26:35] And you've got this whole you know thing
[2:26:38] and and uh you know that one got two two
[2:26:41] pieces of chicken and I only got one.
[2:26:46] Well then you might sometime have to do
[2:26:48] like I had to do to sweet sweet Joanna.
[2:26:54] She just was kind of twirling me a
[2:26:56] little cheese. I said I'm going to need
[2:26:58] a little more than that. There's a lot
[2:26:59] there. Just Just
[2:27:02] that was better than going off and
[2:27:04] saying, "Boy, she really gave it to
[2:27:06] Benjamin. He got all the cheese he
[2:27:09] wanted and I just got a little tiny
[2:27:11] thread on mine." You laugh. It's funny,
[2:27:15] but I'm a pastor and I've had people sit
[2:27:18] on my sofa and tell me stories
[2:27:23] more ridiculous than a little cheese
[2:27:27] because it starts amplifying and
[2:27:29] multiplying and screaming in your ear
[2:27:32] and you start connecting the dots
[2:27:37] and the next thing you know you become
[2:27:39] so paranoid.
[2:27:44] Hello.
[2:27:46] Those are the kind of things we hold on
[2:27:48] to and they compound and they piggyback
[2:27:51] with one another and we start getting
[2:27:53] resentment and bitterness and then we
[2:27:55] come and we offer our wine to the Lord.
[2:28:00] And he says, you know, that could smell
[2:28:01] a little better.
[2:28:04] It's settled in the leaves. Are you
[2:28:05] still here? I'm coming to to uh I'm
[2:28:09] coming to uh I'm coming to
[2:28:13] another point.
[2:28:19] To Moab, he said, "I'll send the
[2:28:20] wanderers that'll cause him to wander."
[2:28:22] To Leodysia, he said, "I will spew thee
[2:28:24] out of my mouth." I don't want either
[2:28:26] one of those.
[2:28:28] Uh there there are scriptures that we'll
[2:28:30] talk I I'll I'll make I'll make this
[2:28:32] another series or or a couple other
[2:28:35] messages, but I I'm going to I'm going
[2:28:39] to jump to a few highlights just to
[2:28:41] leave something with you because I often
[2:28:44] never get to the punchline.
[2:28:47] It's one of my problems.
[2:28:51] I want to I want to give you Philippians
[2:28:53] 1:6 real real quickly because I want to
[2:28:55] encourage you.
[2:28:57] I want you to be encouraged, not
[2:29:00] discouraged.
[2:29:02] I want you to know that if if the word
[2:29:05] of the Lord passes by and says to us,
[2:29:08] uh, to some are settled on their leaves,
[2:29:11] it's not because he's about to turn his
[2:29:13] back on you and and leave you to to your
[2:29:15] bitterness or to your or to your or to
[2:29:18] your or to your or to your or to your
[2:29:21] It's simply because he's saying, "It's
[2:29:23] time. It's time. It's time. It's past
[2:29:26] time for you to be poured on
[2:29:31] from one vessel to another because if
[2:29:34] you always do what you've always done,
[2:29:36] you'll always be what you've always
[2:29:38] been. It's time to be poured again. It's
[2:29:41] time to change vessels.
[2:29:44] Leaving behind the dregs
[2:29:49] of the last season, of the last
[2:29:51] experience, of the last battle, of the
[2:29:53] last big event. Yeah. Naturally, in the
[2:29:56] natural, do you ever feel like you just
[2:29:58] go from one event to the next just where
[2:30:00] you're planning something all the time,
[2:30:02] you dread it, you dread that doctor's
[2:30:03] appointment, then it's over and you
[2:30:05] dread the next one. It's just like
[2:30:06] there's always something to dread.
[2:30:08] There's always something to worry you.
[2:30:11] There's always some Look, folks, that's
[2:30:13] life.
[2:30:14] But here is the reality. Being confident
[2:30:16] of this very thing that he Hallelujah.
[2:30:21] Who are you talking to? You. You. You,
[2:30:24] you, you, you, you. Every one of us. And
[2:30:27] you on that stream.
[2:30:30] I know. I'm confident. I've seen what
[2:30:34] God can do.
[2:30:36] He which hath begun a good work in you.
[2:30:47] Your destiny
[2:30:49] is not irreparable.
[2:31:01] He wouldn't call to you if he intended
[2:31:04] to leave you without his help.
[2:31:07] You see, you cannot pour yourself.
[2:31:12] You cannot pour yourself from one vessel
[2:31:15] to another. Only he can.
[2:31:20] So if you could do it, if you could do
[2:31:22] it on your own, let me ask you this
[2:31:23] question. If you're here and if you
[2:31:26] could do it on your own, you would
[2:31:27] already done it. You you you'd have
[2:31:30] already come to that place, perfect
[2:31:31] love, and all the virtues stacked in and
[2:31:34] uh you're just speaking the word. I
[2:31:36] mean, you are doing more than giving
[2:31:39] little fish their their life. You are
[2:31:41] giving people their life, loved ones
[2:31:43] their life. you you are not just uh uh
[2:31:46] concerned about little things but you
[2:31:50] you're really you would be on it. How
[2:31:52] many of you would be just on it if you
[2:31:55] could have done it yourself? You'd have
[2:31:56] already done it. Let me let me see your
[2:31:58] hand. I I would have already done it. I
[2:31:59] I would have already been there. But the
[2:32:01] reality is you you don't get to pour
[2:32:04] from one vessel to another. Only the
[2:32:06] master can.
[2:32:08] But what you have got to do is make sure
[2:32:12] that you don't get comfortable in the
[2:32:14] vessel that you're in now. That you
[2:32:17] don't cry out for more of him. Because
[2:32:20] if the deep is calling to the deep,
[2:32:21] guess what that means? It means that
[2:32:24] there's a deep over there that that is
[2:32:26] waiting to respond
[2:32:28] to the call that's in here. If you quit
[2:32:31] letting the deep cry out to the deep,
[2:32:34] you'll stay in your in your vessel and
[2:32:36] you'll and your wine will become bitter
[2:32:39] and contaminated. So you start crying
[2:32:41] out to the master. I want to be the wine
[2:32:44] in your chalice. I I want to be, oh God,
[2:32:48] like perfume poured on your feet. Amen.
[2:32:53] I I want my eyes to run down with tears
[2:32:57] so that I can worship you the way that I
[2:33:01] desire to worship you. And and the
[2:33:04] master says, "Okay, are are you sure?
[2:33:08] Are you sure that's what you want? Then
[2:33:10] I'm gonna I'm gonna direct the pastor
[2:33:12] and he'll preach us preach something and
[2:33:14] it'll it'll it'll uh it'll offend your
[2:33:18] mind
[2:33:21] because I want to reveal your heart.
[2:33:24] Sometimes God will let things come that
[2:33:26] will offend our mind so that he can
[2:33:28] reveal our heart. You start crying out,
[2:33:30] I want to give you I want I want I want
[2:33:33] to and he'll say okay.
[2:33:37] Are are you are you sure? That's right.
[2:33:40] Because I know exactly how to pour you
[2:33:42] out of one end to the another.
[2:33:44] Oh, I want it. I want it. I want it. In
[2:33:50] ancient wine- making, the process of
[2:33:52] refining wine involved carefully pouring
[2:33:54] from one vessel to another, leaving
[2:33:57] behind the dregs, the leaves,
[2:34:00] the sediment. This process was called
[2:34:03] racking.
[2:34:05] Racking. The process of transferring
[2:34:08] wine from one vessel to another allows
[2:34:10] the wine to clarify.
[2:34:13] Those who know wine can look at the wine
[2:34:16] in the glass and call it clear or
[2:34:19] cloudy.
[2:34:22] Fine wine. I I I mean, thank God for
[2:34:26] Google. I don't want you to think I'm
[2:34:27] some kind of expert and nor my wife. But
[2:34:32] did you know wine like a diamond is
[2:34:34] initially judged by its clarity?
[2:34:39] I mean, it all looks red to me if it's
[2:34:41] red.
[2:34:43] All looks yellow to me if it's white.
[2:34:48] I don't know the difference. But there's
[2:34:51] somebody that knows if your wine is
[2:34:53] cloudy.
[2:34:55] There's somebody who knows if it's
[2:34:57] taking on the flavor of the dreg.
[2:35:00] There's someone who knows if it's taking
[2:35:02] on the aroma
[2:35:04] of your last battle,
[2:35:07] your last event,
[2:35:10] your last skirmish.
[2:35:12] I may not know, but there's somebody
[2:35:14] that does know
[2:35:16] that racking, the process of
[2:35:18] transferring one vessel to another
[2:35:20] allows the wine to clarify and deepen in
[2:35:23] character. The leaves or dregs are that
[2:35:25] thick residue that settles at the bottom
[2:35:28] of a vessel during fermentation. If wine
[2:35:31] is left too long on the leaves, if it's
[2:35:34] left too long with the dregs in the
[2:35:35] bottom, its flavor turns harsh and even
[2:35:38] its aroma becomes corrupted. We will
[2:35:41] journey through the sacred process of
[2:35:44] wine making over over the next few few
[2:35:46] services
[2:35:49] uh perhaps because I can't tell you what
[2:35:51] Tuesday night will be.
[2:35:53] But I want to give you just a few more
[2:35:55] minutes and be done because I know that
[2:35:57] you can only handle so much and and and
[2:36:01] me also.
[2:36:02] I don't know where to go or stop. That's
[2:36:04] the that's my problem. But but let me
[2:36:07] let me just share some thoughts with you
[2:36:09] for just a moment. in Jeremiah 48:11
[2:36:13] that we read in the beginning, the image
[2:36:16] to describe the complacency of Moab.
[2:36:20] Spiritually,
[2:36:22] it was a warning to any life that
[2:36:24] resists the refining pore of God. When
[2:36:28] we refuse to be poured from vessel to
[2:36:31] vessel, when we get comfortable, when we
[2:36:33] settle in comfort or pride or pain, we
[2:36:36] take on the aroma of the flesh.
[2:36:39] We smell like flesh
[2:36:43] instead of smelling like spirit,
[2:36:47] like him, like Christ. We take on the
[2:36:51] aroma of the flesh instead of the
[2:36:54] fragrance of Christ.
[2:36:56] From a final racking vessel, the journey
[2:37:01] starts like this. From vine to vessel.
[2:37:06] From vessel to vessel.
[2:37:10] From
[2:37:12] from a final racking vessel
[2:37:16] to another more honorable vessel. There
[2:37:20] is an end. There is an end.
[2:37:23] And that is the more honorable vessel,
[2:37:25] the chalice of our bridegroom king to
[2:37:29] make it to the king's cup to be a sip in
[2:37:32] his mouth. Do you follow the analogy?
[2:37:36] The call of the message is a clarion
[2:37:39] call. It's not merely to endure our
[2:37:43] trials to get through them, but we need
[2:37:46] to understand them.
[2:37:49] I'm gonna say that again. it didn't have
[2:37:51] much impact.
[2:37:53] Uh we're not just trying to endure them.
[2:37:56] We we want to understand them. Can
[2:37:59] anybody see the wisdom of wanting to
[2:38:00] know why? Now, you don't always get to
[2:38:03] know why. But God is not a he's not
[2:38:06] cruel. No. And the reason why we want to
[2:38:10] understand the process is so that we
[2:38:12] don't have to do it again.
[2:38:14] Amen. Has anybody ever had to take the
[2:38:16] test again? Let me see you wave. If
[2:38:19] you've ever had to go back and take the
[2:38:20] test again, I'm talking about a
[2:38:22] spiritual test now because you didn't
[2:38:24] understand. You didn't understand what
[2:38:26] the test had come to teach you. Oh Lord,
[2:38:29] help us understand. When believers avoid
[2:38:32] discomfort or resist transition
[2:38:35] spiritually, they begin to settle in
[2:38:37] their old attitudes, their old offenses,
[2:38:39] their old compromise.
[2:38:42] Zephaniah 1:12, look. And it shall come
[2:38:45] to pass at that time that I will search
[2:38:47] Jerusalem with candles and punish the
[2:38:50] men that are settled on their leaves.
[2:38:53] Those who say in their heart, "The Lord
[2:38:55] will not do good, neither will he do
[2:38:58] evil." I can't hear from the Lord. Where
[2:39:03] is the Lord? I have felt that way.
[2:39:07] You've just got to be careful about your
[2:39:09] tone
[2:39:11] because he's there.
[2:39:13] He's watching.
[2:39:15] You are fermenting.
[2:39:17] Something is ha is happening. He's not
[2:39:19] playing with you.
[2:39:22] Don't you see God as some uh uh you know
[2:39:26] freakish scientist somewhere and you're
[2:39:28] his experiment? Oh no. He's a loving
[2:39:31] creator. He made you thus. He desires to
[2:39:36] shape you and mold you and make you. He
[2:39:38] wouldn't let anything come into your
[2:39:40] life if there wasn't a lesson to learn
[2:39:42] out of it. And that which he started,
[2:39:44] he's more than able to perfect and
[2:39:46] finish. If you believe that, if you
[2:39:48] believe that, could you squeeze out an
[2:39:50] amen?
[2:39:52] I want to go I want to go with this as
[2:39:54] we as we wind down.
[2:39:57] And this will have to be covered more
[2:39:59] more clearly, but it starts in the in
[2:40:02] the vineyard.
[2:40:04] You know, the the grape doesn't choose
[2:40:07] itself
[2:40:09] and jump in the basket. Ask Nathan a ask
[2:40:13] the shellies. He did a lot more of grape
[2:40:15] harvesting than we did. But two days we
[2:40:18] harvested grapes in Israel and uh so
[2:40:24] close to the ruins of of Shiloh or Shilo
[2:40:27] where the tabernacle set for 300 years
[2:40:30] that we could cut a cluster of grapes
[2:40:32] and turn our head and see the ruins see
[2:40:35] it sitting on the other side of the
[2:40:36] highway. Now, if that won't kind of give
[2:40:38] you some kind of
[2:40:41] something
[2:40:43] powerful,
[2:40:45] it's a reset for sure. To say the least,
[2:40:48] it's a reset.
[2:40:50] Those grapes are so juicy.
[2:40:53] They're wine grapes.
[2:40:55] And you cut them and bump them against
[2:40:58] one another and the juice runs down your
[2:41:02] arm.
[2:41:04] your your genes
[2:41:07] get coded. Ask Ask Nathan again. Uh
[2:41:11] because we were down in Jerusalem. He
[2:41:14] was up in in in that area and um we got
[2:41:18] to help my wife got to help him on
[2:41:20] occasion with laundry and we laughed
[2:41:23] about the fact that we could stand his
[2:41:24] jeans up in the laundry room before we
[2:41:26] washed them because they're so stiff
[2:41:29] with sweat and grape juice. It's a messy
[2:41:33] process. They had to teach us what
[2:41:36] clusters, what a what a real cluster
[2:41:38] looks like, what what the right thing
[2:41:40] looks like. And and because the the
[2:41:42] grape doesn't choose itself. It doesn't
[2:41:44] jump off the vine into the basket and
[2:41:46] say, "I'm going to be wine." Aren't you
[2:41:49] glad? That's what you've got to
[2:41:50] remember. I wouldn't have chose me.
[2:41:56] You wouldn't have chose you in your
[2:41:58] lowest point in your lowest point. When
[2:42:02] you see yourself, you'd say, "I would
[2:42:03] have never chosen." Aren't you glad that
[2:42:07] you didn't do the choosing?
[2:42:10] Hallelujah. You have not. John 15:16,
[2:42:14] which by the way is the chapter about
[2:42:17] the vine.
[2:42:18] John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but
[2:42:21] I have chosen you and ordained you that
[2:42:26] ye should go and bring forth fruit and
[2:42:29] that your fruit should remain that
[2:42:32] whatsoever you shall ask of the Father
[2:42:34] in my name, he may give it to you. But
[2:42:40] you can't get to John 15:16 without
[2:42:42] passing through John 15:2. Every branch
[2:42:45] in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh
[2:42:48] away. And every branch that beareth
[2:42:49] fruit, he purgeth it.
[2:42:52] Come on.
[2:42:54] He could have separated us from the vine
[2:42:57] and tossed us in the heap, but instead
[2:43:00] he just pruned us a little. And you know
[2:43:02] what happens when you prune? Yes, sir.
[2:43:05] You just start uh uh you just start
[2:43:07] shooting off in other directions.
[2:43:10] You just start getting bushier,
[2:43:12] branchier. you you just start
[2:43:14] flourishing. How many of you know the
[2:43:16] more the more little whatever
[2:43:21] I don't I don't guess they really have
[2:43:22] branches, but let's call them that for
[2:43:24] the sake of the analogy. You know, the
[2:43:26] more little branches you have because
[2:43:28] you've been pruned enough, the more
[2:43:31] potential you have for clustered grapes.
[2:43:34] Amen. He knows. He knows what he's
[2:43:36] doing. He knows what he's doing. And it
[2:43:39] has to happen at the right time. Yes,
[2:43:41] sir. Can't preach that now and they have
[2:43:44] to be washed.
[2:43:46] Grapes before they're crushed. You You
[2:43:48] don't throw the dirty grapes in. Not in
[2:43:49] Bible times. You don't throw the grapes
[2:43:52] in before they're clean because then you
[2:43:54] put more impurities in, make it harder
[2:43:56] to clean. They're cr before they're
[2:43:58] before they're put in the baskets to be
[2:44:00] carried to the to the press. Uh they are
[2:44:04] washed. And we can we'll talk about it.
[2:44:07] We'll show you this is not optional.
[2:44:09] Amen. Washing is preparation.
[2:44:12] And then they're crushed. Oh, goody.
[2:44:17] Oh, yay.
[2:44:21] What we all look forward to?
[2:44:24] My grace.
[2:44:27] Didn't he tell the apostle,
[2:44:29] "My grace is sufficient."
[2:44:32] How many of you found it thus far? His
[2:44:35] grace is sufficient.
[2:44:38] So, the crushing has to come. Can you
[2:44:40] show us just one of those pictures? Uh,
[2:44:43] this is a kind of dark, but this is a
[2:44:46] this is a a wine press
[2:44:49] in a cave in Israel. I'll show you some
[2:44:53] more later. Show us one uh show us the
[2:44:56] other picture I gave you. This is what
[2:44:57] it would have looked like.
[2:45:00] There are archaeological ruins of wine
[2:45:02] presses and olive presses from the north
[2:45:05] all the way to the south. It's
[2:45:07] incredible. Did you ever get tired of
[2:45:09] looking? Never.
[2:45:11] Never. Did you ever sit in the van
[2:45:13] because you just didn't want to look at
[2:45:14] another olive press? Never. I wanted to
[2:45:16] see them all. They were all unique. They
[2:45:19] all serve served a purpose and they all
[2:45:21] told my own story.
[2:45:25] It's necessary.
[2:45:28] Notice that they're not they're not
[2:45:30] crushing them in a machine.
[2:45:34] They're crushing them with their feet.
[2:45:37] And quite literally, it feels that way
[2:45:39] sometime when you're going through that
[2:45:42] process.
[2:45:44] Everybody's stepping on me. God has a
[2:45:48] plan. Say amen. I want I want to give
[2:45:51] you the four vessels without any much
[2:45:54] explanation. I I can't I can't go very
[2:45:58] far into it, but I want to give you the
[2:45:59] four that we will talk about. A vessel
[2:46:01] of misunderstanding,
[2:46:03] a vessel of public gaze,
[2:46:06] a vessel of long dark trials, a vessel
[2:46:10] of strange guidance.
[2:46:13] No wine that sits on the master's table
[2:46:16] fills the king's chalice that doesn't go
[2:46:19] have to go through every one of those
[2:46:20] processes and probably half a dozen
[2:46:23] more. But we're going to narrow it down
[2:46:26] to these because our goal is not to stay
[2:46:28] too long in the dregs of
[2:46:30] misunderstanding
[2:46:33] or to stay in the dregs too long in the
[2:46:35] vessel of public gaze or in the vessel
[2:46:37] of long dark trials or the vessel of
[2:46:40] strange guidance. Our goal is to get to
[2:46:42] the king's cup.
[2:46:44] Well, well, what's going to happen when
[2:46:46] we get to the king's cup? He's going to
[2:46:48] drink us.
[2:46:51] Well, then what happens?
[2:46:54] Then are we no more?
[2:46:56] That's exactly right.
[2:46:58] That's exactly right. It is an invisible
[2:47:01] union. Yes, sir. It is a mystical union.
[2:47:05] It cannot be described in earthly terms.
[2:47:09] But it it's the reality of being in
[2:47:11] Christ.
[2:47:13] It's more than just meaning I'm in the
[2:47:15] church or I'm in the faith. To be in
[2:47:18] Christ, we are consumed. Everything that
[2:47:22] is left of us, e a everything that is
[2:47:25] refined, the rest is left behind in the
[2:47:28] in the dregs and the vessels of testing.
[2:47:31] All that's left behind of us is what
[2:47:34] smells like him and what tastes like
[2:47:36] him. And when he consumes, when he
[2:47:39] receives your praise, when he receives
[2:47:41] your worship, it is intoxicating.
[2:47:44] It it brings pleasure to the King of
[2:47:48] Kings and to the Lord of Lords. The
[2:47:51] vessel of misunderstanding. I'll
[2:47:53] describe it to you more detail another
[2:47:56] time because it it was actually used.
[2:48:00] It's a season of being misread.
[2:48:04] It's a season of being falsely judged.
[2:48:08] It's a season of being misrepresented.
[2:48:11] It's a season when your motives are
[2:48:14] questioned, your identity is misread,
[2:48:16] and your assignment is dismissed by
[2:48:19] others.
[2:48:21] They think they know where you are.
[2:48:24] Folks, nobody really knows where you are
[2:48:27] but you and him.
[2:48:29] Come on. Maybe in this season you you
[2:48:32] feel you're walking in obedience, but
[2:48:34] others can't see it
[2:48:36] and your motives are questioned. And
[2:48:38] very often the criticisms that come in
[2:48:41] that first this is after you've been
[2:48:43] poured out of the skin, the first vessel
[2:48:46] of fermentation,
[2:48:48] these are these are vessels. Once you've
[2:48:51] been poured into misunderstanding,
[2:48:53] you've already become fermented.
[2:48:56] The fermentation is not mature. But that
[2:48:59] takes place in a in a skin. So you're
[2:49:02] more familiar with the concept of the
[2:49:04] wine skin. But that was only the
[2:49:07] beginning of the process. The initial
[2:49:09] the initial fermentation would take
[2:49:11] place there and sometimes it would
[2:49:13] actually be poured back into a skin to
[2:49:16] then be preserved and carried on a
[2:49:18] journey or so forth. But it's what took
[2:49:20] place in between that is so so
[2:49:22] interesting uh spiritually.
[2:49:25] It's no fun. It's no fun. I'm telling
[2:49:29] you to live in in a cloud of
[2:49:31] misunderstanding is no fun. But I don't
[2:49:34] know if there's anybody in the house
[2:49:35] that hadn't been there,
[2:49:39] misunderstood.
[2:49:42] Now, you can't develop some kind of
[2:49:43] martyr complex
[2:49:46] and decide you're just going to eat
[2:49:47] worms for the rest of your life because
[2:49:49] everybody's so against you. No, no, no,
[2:49:51] you can't. These trials didn't come to
[2:49:54] drive you into that sense of despondency
[2:49:57] and depression.
[2:50:00] They came to let you know that your
[2:50:02] dependency is not on man for your
[2:50:04] approval.
[2:50:07] Hallelujah. You don't have to have
[2:50:09] anybody else's approval. If the king is
[2:50:12] tipping his hat to you, if the king
[2:50:14] says, "I'm on the case." If the
[2:50:16] Hallelujah.
[2:50:18] If the king says, "I know what I'm
[2:50:20] doing, sir." If you can trust him,
[2:50:25] you'll get through it. Amen. I remember
[2:50:28] the time I heard the Lord say, "I'm
[2:50:29] going to make you a gazing stock." Oh,
[2:50:32] boy.
[2:50:37] A gazing stock.
[2:50:40] You see, my God often speaks King James
[2:50:43] English.
[2:50:45] And he does that so that you can go
[2:50:47] figure out what it means. And a gazing
[2:50:50] stock is not the same thing as being a
[2:50:52] star on a pedestal.
[2:50:56] Being a gazing stock doesn't make you
[2:50:59] admired.
[2:51:01] It makes you a mystery.
[2:51:05] It makes you an enigma.
[2:51:09] It puts you in the vessel of
[2:51:11] misunderstanding
[2:51:13] where people can only hear your words
[2:51:17] and and judge your motives because they
[2:51:19] can't see your heart. patiently endure.
[2:51:24] There's something that has more pressure
[2:51:26] coming.
[2:51:28] Amen. If you think that's tough,
[2:51:32] I'll show you before we're through with
[2:51:34] this. I'll show you some biblical
[2:51:35] examples.
[2:51:37] One being Nehemiah.
[2:51:40] If anybody knew what it meant to be
[2:51:42] misunderstood,
[2:51:44] Nehemiah did. He just wanted to see
[2:51:46] restoration. And the people went around
[2:51:48] and said, "He just wants to be the king.
[2:51:52] Nehemiah had no no aspiration of being
[2:51:55] the king. He just wanted to see the
[2:51:57] gates restored.
[2:51:59] He just wept because the walls of the
[2:52:02] city of the city of Jerusalem were
[2:52:03] broken down. Right? He didn't want to be
[2:52:06] king. He didn't want to be the boss.
[2:52:09] He just wanted to see the breach
[2:52:10] restored.
[2:52:12] People are going to misunderstand you.
[2:52:15] If you have a zeal to help,
[2:52:18] if you have a zeal to get something
[2:52:19] done, that's not what people are going
[2:52:22] to see first.
[2:52:24] He's a takeover.
[2:52:27] She just pushes her way in to do it all.
[2:52:33] Brother, sometimes it's just because you
[2:52:35] can't help yourself. You see a need.
[2:52:38] You want to jump up and get it done
[2:52:40] before somebody has a committee meeting
[2:52:42] to decide
[2:52:44] who.
[2:52:46] It don't take a committee meeting to
[2:52:48] figure out who's going to pick up the
[2:52:50] trash.
[2:52:52] Come on. There's another vessel. We'll
[2:52:54] get to it another time.
[2:52:57] In that vessel of misunderstanding, let
[2:52:59] me just tell you, it's a dark vessel.
[2:53:00] And so, you can't really see what's
[2:53:02] going on on the inside. So, a lot of the
[2:53:04] things that are spoken about you and
[2:53:05] over you and to you are are are wrong.
[2:53:10] They're not true. But just wait a
[2:53:12] minute. There's some more criticisms
[2:53:14] coming because the next vessel is is
[2:53:18] shallow and wide and and gray
[2:53:23] and easier to see into.
[2:53:27] You you get the point. So what they told
[2:53:30] about you in this other season was
[2:53:32] speculation and misunderstanding. But
[2:53:34] now
[2:53:37] now what's told
[2:53:40] is the ugly truth.
[2:53:44] Every bubble.
[2:53:49] Did you know that sometimes wine lets
[2:53:51] off a belch?
[2:53:56] Pressure.
[2:53:57] There are certain stages of the
[2:53:59] fermentation
[2:54:00] where the seal has to be broken. It has
[2:54:02] to be because it it it will belch
[2:54:07] and uh it ain't good.
[2:54:11] It's the gases that are forming in the
[2:54:14] fermentation process. And I want you to
[2:54:16] know right away it does not smell like
[2:54:18] wine.
[2:54:20] It smells more like sauerkraut.
[2:54:26] and and and how embarrassing it is
[2:54:29] that in that vessel of public gaze,
[2:54:31] everybody uh se sees you, sees your
[2:54:35] faults
[2:54:37] and smells your burps.
[2:54:41] Boy, that's carnal, but you got it.
[2:54:45] And what they tell about you is
[2:54:47] sometimes the ugly truth.
[2:54:50] And you want out of there as fast as you
[2:54:52] can get. And God says, "There's a time
[2:54:56] you're going to learn to shut your
[2:54:57] mouth.
[2:55:00] You're going to learn not to follow
[2:55:02] every whim, every feeling, every every
[2:55:04] every zeal.
[2:55:07] You're you're going to have a zeal, but
[2:55:09] you're going to have one according to
[2:55:10] knowledge and wisdom.
[2:55:12] You're you're you're not going to uh
[2:55:14] hear what the pastor said and then make
[2:55:16] yourself more of a distraction.
[2:55:21] You're going to try to be less of one.
[2:55:24] See, but when you're in that vessel of
[2:55:27] public gaze, it's all hanging out. And
[2:55:30] it's hard
[2:55:33] because you also see things in you that
[2:55:35] you didn't didn't know were there. Thank
[2:55:37] God. Thank God because you can't pray,
[2:55:39] Lord, reveal my heart and then and then
[2:55:42] uh you know, get mad at what you see.
[2:55:44] But you don't have to stay there. You
[2:55:46] don't have to keep that. Moving on.
[2:55:50] that vessel of public gaze. Let's get
[2:55:51] out of there fast as we can.
[2:55:54] There was one in the Bible, several in
[2:55:56] the Bible who experienced that. One
[2:55:57] being Judah.
[2:56:01] His prostitute, his his uh widow,
[2:56:05] widowed daughter-in-law
[2:56:08] was selling herself
[2:56:10] as a prostitute on the side of the road.
[2:56:13] and holy Judah.
[2:56:16] Holy criticized everybody. Had something
[2:56:20] to say about every other church.
[2:56:22] Judah.
[2:56:25] The next thing he knows, he's he's
[2:56:27] picked up
[2:56:29] his own widowed daughter-in-law under a
[2:56:32] veil
[2:56:34] and has lay with her.
[2:56:37] And when confronted,
[2:56:39] it's true. You just couldn't deny that.
[2:56:44] There's no getting out of that.
[2:56:46] And you know what Judah's response was?
[2:56:48] Not like today. That never happened.
[2:56:50] That's grossly exaggerated.
[2:56:53] There's nothing to I have nothing to say
[2:56:56] about the matter.
[2:57:01] He said, "She is more righteous
[2:57:04] than I am." Amen. You see, when you get
[2:57:07] poured out of that vessel of public
[2:57:09] gaze, pride is left behind and hypocrisy
[2:57:12] is left behind and pretense is left
[2:57:15] behind. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Another
[2:57:18] part of your mask is stripped off. And
[2:57:22] you're getting sweeter. I pray we don't
[2:57:24] have to go through what Judah went
[2:57:26] through. I'm not in any way insinuating.
[2:57:28] Then the vessel of long dark trials.
[2:57:30] You're poured from public gaze to long
[2:57:33] dark trials. And I don't even want to
[2:57:35] talk about it. Job,
[2:57:39] David.
[2:57:40] You reckon David ever said, "How many
[2:57:42] times do I have to be anointed king
[2:57:45] before I actually see a a throne?"
[2:57:49] But God has that place. Oh, he has that
[2:57:52] place. Wiggle just a little bit. Uh so
[2:57:54] that you're not numb.
[2:57:57] God has that place.
[2:57:59] It's long. It's dark. It's a trial, but
[2:58:03] something's going to be left behind.
[2:58:05] Hallelujah.
[2:58:08] A lot of stuff. Entitlement.
[2:58:16] Entitlement.
[2:58:19] Some people strut through life in
[2:58:23] community especially
[2:58:25] as though they have earned some position
[2:58:30] or some place.
[2:58:33] The problem with a sense of entitlement
[2:58:35] is it's often birthed in self-pity.
[2:58:41] It's a charade.
[2:58:43] A person who acts like they deserve more
[2:58:46] than someone else,
[2:58:49] that person has has gone through that
[2:58:52] season of feeling so sorry for
[2:58:55] themselves.
[2:58:57] And when they overcome self-pity, it
[2:59:00] transforms into this sense of spiritual
[2:59:03] pride.
[2:59:05] I sometimes I don't mean to be
[2:59:07] irreverent all the time, but sometimes I
[2:59:10] call it bride pride.
[2:59:13] And I've seen a lot of it in my day. I
[2:59:16] saw him, no one else saw him. I heard
[2:59:18] him, no one else heard him. I believed
[2:59:20] him, no one else believed him. We're
[2:59:23] going and ain't nobody else going.
[2:59:25] Nobody's saved. I hear outlandish,
[2:59:30] unbiblical lies.
[2:59:33] Nobody's saved but the bride. Where did
[2:59:36] the messenger say such? Where did the
[2:59:39] scripture say such? The scripture said,
[2:59:42] "Whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[2:59:44] Lord shall be saved."
[2:59:50] We're not talking about being saved.
[2:59:52] We're talking about overcoming. The
[2:59:54] bride doesn't just find salvation. She
[2:59:56] finds redemption. Redemption takes you
[2:59:58] all the way back to the original
[3:00:00] thoughts of God. Amen.
[3:00:02] The the whole world won't find that
[3:00:04] place. But there's a bride who will. And
[3:00:07] that ought not to make us proud. No,
[3:00:09] sir. It ought to make us thankful.
[3:00:13] It ought to make us crawl instead of
[3:00:15] strut. The last one. Musicians are
[3:00:18] coming. I knew this would
[3:00:22] would drag like this.
[3:00:24] The vessel of strange guidance.
[3:00:28] Oh, it's biblical.
[3:00:31] Why in the world would God pick us up
[3:00:36] from a great revival,
[3:00:40] a move of the spirit,
[3:00:44] and take us to Gaza?
[3:00:49] In a desert
[3:00:51] in Acts,
[3:00:53] Philillip was taken, translated, moved
[3:00:58] by spiritual means from a move of God
[3:01:02] that was going down going on in
[3:01:04] Jerusalem
[3:01:06] to Gaza.
[3:01:08] Are you familiar with the term? Guess
[3:01:10] where it is? Gaza.
[3:01:14] That's what we're talking about when we
[3:01:15] talk about the Gaza Strip. It was the
[3:01:17] land of the Philistines. We're talking
[3:01:19] about the land of the Philistines.
[3:01:24] Why would God give you such strange
[3:01:26] leadership?
[3:01:28] Because
[3:01:30] the queen of Ethiopia, Candace,
[3:01:34] she has a unic
[3:01:36] that she has sent to figure these
[3:01:39] strange tales out.
[3:01:42] And he sits in a chariot reading the
[3:01:44] word of God. And Philillip finds himself
[3:01:48] from revival to desert.
[3:01:52] Where am I? Why is God leading me here?
[3:01:54] Why am I having to leave everything that
[3:01:56] I'm familiar with and everything I love
[3:01:58] and the culture that I have embraced and
[3:02:01] I'm out here in the middle of the desert
[3:02:03] and here comes an Ethiopian unic humming
[3:02:06] to himself riding in a chariot. And
[3:02:08] Philip said, "May maybe that's maybe
[3:02:09] that's it." finds that he's reading a
[3:02:12] scroll. Somebody had a scroll.
[3:02:15] He's reading a scroll. Understand thou
[3:02:17] what thou readest.
[3:02:19] No.
[3:02:22] No. I can't lie. Uh how can I unless
[3:02:25] there's someone to teach me. And Philip
[3:02:27] says, "Oh my,
[3:02:30] this is my cue.
[3:02:33] One, you give up a a Billy Graham
[3:02:37] crusade. You're you're you're you're
[3:02:38] you're winning thousands
[3:02:41] and God puts you out there. You ever had
[3:02:43] God to shift you? Oh yes.
[3:02:49] Listen, folks who who are many folks
[3:02:52] here, I I I'm going to say it anyway,
[3:02:54] even though I know there's others
[3:02:55] hearing it. The reality is you you were
[3:02:59] uh
[3:03:01] you you you you carry a label
[3:03:05] just for being here this morning.
[3:03:10] It's okay. It's hurtful. Do you ever
[3:03:13] take it personal? I do. And I have to
[3:03:16] shake myself out.
[3:03:19] But sure, sure. We're all human. We can
[3:03:21] take things personal. But the reality is
[3:03:24] sometimes God has to give us strange
[3:03:26] guidance,
[3:03:28] put us in strange circumstances because
[3:03:30] there was something in us that cannot
[3:03:32] fall to the bottom
[3:03:36] by just doing what everybody else is
[3:03:37] doing.
[3:03:43] Oh, could I say so much but I have said
[3:03:45] too much.
[3:03:48] We could we can we can now if you're
[3:03:52] more comfortable we could possibly go
[3:03:56] back and sing only songs from the 50s
[3:04:00] if that makes people more comfortable
[3:04:03] because we find that those who criticize
[3:04:05] the worship here are most often the ones
[3:04:08] who stream it
[3:04:13] and who adapt it and use it in their own
[3:04:15] churches
[3:04:17] in moderation because they love it
[3:04:19] because there are because there are
[3:04:20] people there's a generation
[3:04:25] I don't want to miss the hymns in fact
[3:04:28] the hymns are usually sung first and I
[3:04:30] can't always be out here and brother
[3:04:32] Greek can tell you I often say I need to
[3:04:34] get out there
[3:04:36] when you're singing the lamb is the in
[3:04:38] the city where the lamb is the light
[3:04:42] I have visions
[3:04:45] I go back in my mind to precious
[3:04:47] memories of Neil Johnson dancing across
[3:04:50] Sister Isabel. Neil Johnson dancing
[3:04:54] across the back of the Tucson
[3:04:56] tabernacle.
[3:04:58] We were singing Holy Ghost at your feet
[3:05:00] dancing and then he comes to lead the
[3:05:02] worship uh the next service and he's
[3:05:05] singing the city where the lamb is the
[3:05:07] light. It was the first time I'd ever
[3:05:08] heard it in my life and I fell in love
[3:05:11] and I said what a song. What a song. I
[3:05:14] love the old songs. That's what I listen
[3:05:16] to when it's just me.
[3:05:19] Sometimes I force my family to because I
[3:05:21] think it's my responsibility to expand
[3:05:23] their repertoire so they get to spend
[3:05:26] part of their time in heaven on the
[3:05:27] southern gospel side with me. Wouldn't
[3:05:30] it be terrible to be anyway?
[3:05:35] But I don't believe that God quit
[3:05:37] inspiring sir
[3:05:41] when Fanny Crosby died.
[3:05:45] Don't Don't mis don't mistake this. I
[3:05:49] love it.
[3:05:51] I shall know him. I shall know him.
[3:05:57] It means more knowing where it come
[3:05:59] from. Someone who who wouldn't have seen
[3:06:02] him in the natural had she lived in his
[3:06:05] day. But I don't have to worry about
[3:06:07] that because when I get my eyes when I
[3:06:09] see I'm going to know him.
[3:06:13] Nothing more beautiful than that.
[3:06:16] But to but to think it's not inspired or
[3:06:19] it's somehow contaminated because it
[3:06:21] doesn't come out of the only belief book
[3:06:25] is the is is narrowminded
[3:06:29] and and quite stifling
[3:06:32] because sometimes God wants to show up
[3:06:34] and tell you in you brother in you
[3:06:38] brother in you sister is a lion. Right.
[3:06:45] Not a pussycat,
[3:06:48] a lion. And his name is the lion of the
[3:06:50] tribe of Judah.
[3:06:53] And he doesn't want to purr in you.
[3:07:00] He wants to roar sometime.
[3:07:03] He wants his voice to be heard in your
[3:07:07] praise. He wants the sound of eternity
[3:07:10] to reverberate from your lungs as you
[3:07:14] lift up your voices to exalt him.
[3:07:22] The pillar of fire keeps moving. The
[3:07:26] grace of God keeps building.
[3:07:28] He's preparing a bride
[3:07:31] who will fit right in that cup
[3:07:36] with all the dregs left behind. Let's
[3:07:39] stand.
[3:07:41] Wow.
[3:07:51] Don't despair.
[3:07:54] He who started a good work
[3:07:58] Don't get comfortable in your season
[3:08:03] because there's another one with your
[3:08:05] name on it.
[3:08:08] The same God who was with you in the in
[3:08:11] the vessel of misunderstanding
[3:08:13] will be with you in the vessel of public
[3:08:15] gaze. the same God with you in the
[3:08:18] public gaze when you have made a royal
[3:08:22] um
[3:08:24] gesture of yourself.
[3:08:28] That's the same God that will will go
[3:08:30] with you through the vessel of long dark
[3:08:32] trials
[3:08:35] when you're begging to get out.
[3:08:38] You're not going anywhere.
[3:08:40] You and I are not leaving that vessel of
[3:08:42] long dark trials until we learn that
[3:08:45] it's in the midnight. It's in the
[3:08:47] darkest night. It's in the It's in the
[3:08:49] place where where we ought to be asleep
[3:08:53] that a song is being birthed in us. Uh,
[3:08:57] Brother David, excuse me, brother Daniel
[3:08:59] pulled out this old song uh at the
[3:09:02] graduation after was we were just having
[3:09:04] fun. He and he pulled out that old song
[3:09:06] called Out
[3:09:09] and there we were
[3:09:11] we were singing that with everything
[3:09:13] that we had.
[3:09:18] There's some lines in there that I have
[3:09:20] reung over the last few days.
[3:09:24] Look it up.
[3:09:27] See, if it doesn't tell us
[3:09:30] in in in in order to to move up, we have
[3:09:34] to we have to sometimes be called out,
[3:09:38] poured out from one vessel to another.
[3:09:41] In that in that moment of long dark
[3:09:44] trial for Paul and Silas, the verse said
[3:09:47] uh long about midnight, Paul began to
[3:09:50] pray. And Silas started to sing.
[3:09:56] That's got to be you. That's got to be
[3:09:59] me. Even in the long dark trial, you got
[3:10:03] to let the Holy Spirit birth a song in
[3:10:05] your heart. Total praise. The best
[3:10:09] praise is painful praise.
[3:10:12] The most holy worship is the one that
[3:10:15] cost you something.
[3:10:17] You can worship because he brought you
[3:10:20] through
[3:10:22] or because you know he's bringing you
[3:10:24] through. Same God will be with you in
[3:10:28] strange leadership in strange guidance.
[3:10:35] Should the Holy Spirit come by and say,
[3:10:38] "I want you to grow a beard." Now, that
[3:10:39] only applies to a brother
[3:10:42] or the or the Holy Ghost come by and
[3:10:44] say, "Shave it off. I got a purpose in
[3:10:46] it." Or the spirit of the Lord come by
[3:10:49] and I I want you to to go there and do
[3:10:54] that.
[3:10:55] I want you to drive to a certain place
[3:10:57] and pray this prayer.
[3:11:01] Not only, you know, others will think
[3:11:03] you're crazy. You you you think you're
[3:11:06] crazy. You You think you're crazy. you
[3:11:08] better do it anyway.
[3:11:12] I remember the times that God sent me on
[3:11:15] assignment
[3:11:17] that looked stupid to me. I was
[3:11:20] embarrassed to even tell what I was
[3:11:22] doing.
[3:11:25] I remember one night the spirit of God
[3:11:27] said uh these folks are not here
[3:11:31] but God said they're fighting
[3:11:35] and it's bad
[3:11:38] and I want you to go I want you to stand
[3:11:40] on the outside of their home in their
[3:11:42] yard and I want you to not be seen.
[3:11:46] Don't go to the door or the window, but
[3:11:48] I want you to pray what I put in your
[3:11:50] heart.
[3:11:52] And I'm going to protect the life
[3:11:54] because of it.
[3:11:57] What do you do if you know the voice? If
[3:12:00] you know, you better do it.
[3:12:04] You better do it. And you'll get that.
[3:12:05] You'll get these maybe not that extreme,
[3:12:08] but you you'll get it in that in that
[3:12:09] vessel. you you're you'll you'll you'll
[3:12:12] make decisions that are not that that
[3:12:14] don't seem good decisions and long terms
[3:12:17] and
[3:12:18] but you're learning to hear his voice.
[3:12:21] Uh if you want an example in my last uh
[3:12:24] thoughts, Benjamin, be ready.
[3:12:26] I know you've been ready a while.
[3:12:31] God says to a prophet, I'm going to give
[3:12:32] you a caribou. His horns are going to be
[3:12:35] exactly so many. You know,
[3:12:40] I'm going to I'm going to give you this.
[3:12:42] I'm going to give you that.
[3:12:44] Brother Brandham makes this statement
[3:12:45] that God was really teaching him
[3:12:50] to trust.
[3:12:52] You'll learn.
[3:12:54] God gave uh David that kind of
[3:12:56] confidence, didn't he? He let him kill a
[3:12:59] lion and the bear. That wasn't the real
[3:13:01] goal. It wasn't really a caribou.
[3:13:04] There was something bigger. There was a
[3:13:06] giant about to get in his way.
[3:13:09] And he got confidence by letting God
[3:13:11] speak to him in the little things, in
[3:13:14] the small things. He began to know and
[3:13:16] discern the voice of God. How many of
[3:13:18] you want that? I've got to know his
[3:13:21] voice. Porus,
[3:13:23] pour us, Lord. from vessel to vessel,
[3:13:28] leaving behind the bitter drags,
[3:13:32] the stinking rotten flesh.
[3:13:38] Jesus,
[3:13:43] and I don't know how
[3:13:47] to say exactly how I feel. And I can't
[3:13:53] begin
[3:13:55] to tell you what your love has meant.
[3:13:58] I'm lost for words.
[3:14:03] Oh Jesus, thank you.
[3:14:06] Is there a way
[3:14:10] to show the passion in my heart? Can I
[3:14:16] express
[3:14:18] how truly great I think you are my
[3:14:22] dearest
[3:14:24] friend.
[3:14:27] Lord
[3:14:29] Lord, this is my
[3:14:32] desire.
[3:14:37] just to pour my love on you.
[3:14:41] Like oil upon your feet,
[3:14:44] like wine for you to drink,
[3:14:48] like water from my heart.
[3:14:52] I'll pour my love on you.
[3:14:56] And it praises like perfume.
[3:15:00] I'll lish mine on you till every drop is
[3:15:06] gone.
[3:15:08] I'll pour my love
[3:15:12] on
[3:15:13] you.
[3:15:15] Like oil upon your feet,
[3:15:19] like wine for you to drink, Lord. Like
[3:15:23] water from my heart. I just want to pour
[3:15:27] my love on you. And if praise is like
[3:15:32] perfume,
[3:15:34] then I'll lavish mine on you till every
[3:15:39] drop is gone. I'll pour my love
[3:15:45] on
[3:15:47] you.
[3:15:51] And I don't know how
[3:15:55] to say exactly how I feel. And I can't
[3:16:01] begin
[3:16:03] to tell you what your love has meant.
[3:16:06] I'm lost for words.
[3:16:12] [Music]
[3:16:13] And is there a way to show the passion
[3:16:19] in my heart? Can I
[3:16:23] express how truly great I think you are?
[3:16:28] You're my dearest
[3:16:31] friend.
[3:16:34] [Music]
[3:16:36] Oh Lord, this is my
[3:16:39] desire.
[3:16:43] I just want to pour my love on you.
[3:16:47] Like oil upon your feet, like wine for
[3:16:52] you to drink, like water from my heart.
[3:16:58] I'll pour my love on you. Oh, and it
[3:17:02] praises like perfume. Then I'll lish
[3:17:07] mine on you till every drop is gone.
[3:17:13] And I'll pour my love
[3:17:17] on
[3:17:19] you.
[3:17:20] Like oil upon your feet.
[3:17:24] Like wine for you to drink. Like water
[3:17:29] from my heart. Lord, I just want to pour
[3:17:32] my love on you. Oh, and it praises like
[3:17:37] perfume.
[3:17:39] I lish mine on you till every drop is
[3:17:45] gone.
[3:17:46] And I'll pour my love
[3:17:50] on
[3:17:52] you.
[3:17:54] like oil upon your feet and like wine
[3:17:58] for you to drink. Like water from my
[3:18:03] heart. I want to pour my love on you,
[3:18:08] Lord. When it praises like perfume you
[3:18:12] then I'll lish mine on you till every
[3:18:17] drop is gone
[3:18:20] and I'll pour my love
[3:18:24] on
[3:18:26] you.
[3:18:31] I don't know how
[3:18:35] say exactly how I feel. And I can't
[3:18:40] begin
[3:18:42] to tell you what your love has.
[3:18:46] I'm lost for words.
[3:18:53] And is there
[3:18:55] a way to show the passion in my heart?
[3:19:01] Can I
[3:19:03] express
[3:19:04] Lord how truly great I think you are.
[3:19:08] You're my dearest
[3:19:11] friend.
[3:19:16] Oh, this is my
[3:19:19] desire
[3:19:24] just to pour my love on you
[3:19:28] like oil upon your feet.
[3:19:31] And like wine for you to drink, like a
[3:19:36] water from my heart, I just want to pour
[3:19:40] my love on you. And it praisees like
[3:19:45] perfume.
[3:19:47] I lish mine on you till every drop is
[3:19:53] gone. Oh, and I'll pour my love
[3:19:57] [Music]
[3:19:59] on on you and like oil upon your feet
[3:20:06] and like wine for you to drink. Like a
[3:20:10] water from my heart. I will pour my love
[3:20:15] on you. Oh, and it praises like perfume.
[3:20:20] Lord, I'll lish mine on you till every
[3:20:26] drop is gone. Oh, and I'll pour my love
[3:20:32] on
[3:20:34] you. And like upon your feet,
[3:20:39] like wine for you to drink, like a water
[3:20:44] from my heart.
[3:20:47] I'll pour my love on you.
[3:20:50] And if praise is like perfume,
[3:20:54] I'll lish mine on you. you till every
[3:20:59] drop is gone.
[3:21:02] I'll pour my love
[3:21:06] on
[3:21:08] you
[3:21:10] like oil upon your feet.
[3:21:14] Like wine for you to drink,
[3:21:18] like water from my heart.
[3:21:22] I pour my love on you.
[3:21:25] And if praise is like perfume,
[3:21:30] I lish mine on you till every drop is
[3:21:36] gone.
[3:21:38] And I'll pour my love
[3:21:42] on
[3:21:44] him. Don't you want to know and discern
[3:21:47] his voice?
[3:21:49] Don't you want out of this season if
[3:21:51] it's time?
[3:21:54] Only he knows.
[3:21:57] Only he knows.
[3:22:00] We don't want to lodge one extra night
[3:22:02] in the wilderness, do we? We don't want
[3:22:04] to spend one extra
[3:22:06] day of our lives in in a vessel
[3:22:10] that's just settling on the leaves.
[3:22:13] Lord, we're ready to be poured out.
[3:22:14] We're ready to go from vessel to vessel.
[3:22:18] If if you think we're ready, we are
[3:22:21] ready.
[3:22:22] May we know your voice.
[3:22:25] May we discern your heart.
[3:22:29] The spirit of the Lord would say that I
[3:22:31] feel it so strongly that there are
[3:22:35] giftings and callings,
[3:22:39] truths spoken over your life
[3:22:43] that are not operational.
[3:22:45] Some have been operational at other
[3:22:48] times, in other vessels, in other
[3:22:51] seasons and circumstances.
[3:22:54] But what I believe this season,
[3:22:57] the last 10 days or so that we've been
[3:23:01] moving the way we've been moving, I I
[3:23:03] think that the season is simply about
[3:23:06] God desiring to restore,
[3:23:09] to bring restitution in your life, to
[3:23:12] reactivate
[3:23:14] those ways that he has used you before
[3:23:18] in service.
[3:23:21] words of wisdom and words of knowledge,
[3:23:25] understanding
[3:23:28] like you have known before.
[3:23:31] There were some promises that were
[3:23:33] directly connected to Mariah's birth.
[3:23:37] We shared a portion of it the other
[3:23:39] night. It had to do with the with the
[3:23:43] lingering of the birthing process and
[3:23:47] the fact that all of us have have
[3:23:50] something to bring to maturity,
[3:23:54] something to do for him, something to be
[3:23:57] for him.
[3:23:59] And there's been delay and there's been
[3:24:01] struggle in many of our lives.
[3:24:04] And I believe God will loose us if we're
[3:24:06] willing to be loosed. I'm willing. I'm
[3:24:08] I'm past that point. One of those words
[3:24:12] was a restoration
[3:24:14] of of healing gift.
[3:24:18] We're we're we're we're far too sick
[3:24:22] and some of it is our own poor
[3:24:25] decisions.
[3:24:28] But I believe that healing is still the
[3:24:31] children's bread. Anybody believe that?
[3:24:33] Amen. And and I want to I want to be
[3:24:36] able to pray again with with full
[3:24:39] expectation
[3:24:42] instead of sometimes praying and and and
[3:24:44] and thinking we already know the
[3:24:46] outcome, but I'm going to pray anyway
[3:24:47] because that's what a Christian would
[3:24:49] do, but our faith really isn't there.
[3:24:51] We're just sort of go, I've been there.
[3:24:54] I've been there. Somebody asked you to
[3:24:56] pray for them and you're thinking in in
[3:24:59] what for? I know that sounds horrible.
[3:25:03] But you get to that place where you're
[3:25:05] not seeing the result and so you're
[3:25:07] thinking, "What must we do?" I believe
[3:25:09] God wants to restore
[3:25:11] things like that in our lives. Faith
[3:25:14] needs to be anointed and and raise up
[3:25:18] and those those dregs. We've been
[3:25:20] preaching about them really calling them
[3:25:22] offenses for for all of this year. And
[3:25:27] they will rise up to stop the flow. How
[3:25:31] many of you know that you'll flow and
[3:25:34] then the an offense will come back and
[3:25:36] pop up and somebody will, you know, get
[3:25:39] your feathers ruffled and you will just
[3:25:41] let let it I I I I know there's got to
[3:25:44] be a an end in sight
[3:25:48] as we come into maturity.
[3:25:50] I can't ask you or force you. I can only
[3:25:54] I can only mention that I believe God
[3:25:58] will do it if we can yield. Telling
[3:26:01] somebody, teaching someone to yield is
[3:26:03] the hardest thing ever because what it
[3:26:05] really means is you got to let go. And
[3:26:07] no one wants to turn the wheel over to
[3:26:10] someone else. We have to let go. If you
[3:26:13] also feel some shifting in your life and
[3:26:16] some seasons of change and you've been
[3:26:19] also feeling I've had so many people
[3:26:21] say, "Pastor, I'm feeling something too.
[3:26:23] Something is shifting. God is doing
[3:26:25] something and I want to cooperate with
[3:26:28] him." Would you would you just raise up
[3:26:30] both of your hands right now? There's no
[3:26:32] I'm not saying that's some kind of
[3:26:34] miracle connection,
[3:26:36] but it is the international sign of
[3:26:38] surrender.
[3:26:40] Lord, we just surrender.
[3:26:43] This can't come from our lips.
[3:26:46] It has to come from deep within.
[3:26:49] It has to come from a deeper place than
[3:26:51] our mind, our will, and our emotions. It
[3:26:53] has to come from our inner being.
[3:26:56] That uh fallen human spirit now redeemed
[3:27:01] and regenerated by the precious blood of
[3:27:03] Jesus Christ. Spirit crying out to
[3:27:06] spirit. deep crying out to deep. Lord, I
[3:27:10] sense a moving
[3:27:12] that is not emotional.
[3:27:15] It's deeper than that.
[3:27:17] Fill us with a new passion for you. Stir
[3:27:22] us
[3:27:23] out of this season.
[3:27:26] We have grown comfortable at times,
[3:27:30] refusing to move, refusing to bend,
[3:27:33] refusing to change. But today Lord we we
[3:27:36] say uh uh
[3:27:40] not our will
[3:27:43] but rather as it is in heaven
[3:27:48] let it be so in earth.
[3:27:51] We are earthn vessels
[3:27:53] and we're asking that the will of
[3:27:55] heaven, the purposes of heaven, the mind
[3:27:58] of the kingdom of God
[3:28:01] would land in these vessels
[3:28:04] and transform us by your word, not by
[3:28:08] feeling, by word, from glory to glory,
[3:28:12] from faith to faith, from strength to
[3:28:14] strength. Oh yes.
[3:28:16] Oh yes.
[3:28:19] Somebody's waiting on God to take out
[3:28:21] the desire for one thing and give give
[3:28:23] you the desire for another thing. No,
[3:28:26] no, we're past that.
[3:28:30] It's it's what we can do.
[3:28:33] And that's just surrender to his
[3:28:35] sovereign grace and will. And brother,
[3:28:37] he can set you free, sister. He can set
[3:28:40] you free. He is a deliverer.
[3:28:44] If you spend all your time in guilt and
[3:28:46] condemnation, it's nothing but a lie
[3:28:48] from hell. The Holy Spirit is not doing
[3:28:50] that. The Holy Spirit convicts with
[3:28:53] hope. The devil lies with condemnation,
[3:28:58] guilts with condemnation. There is a
[3:29:00] difference. How many of you have
[3:29:02] recognized the difference? If you
[3:29:05] discern the voice of the spirit today,
[3:29:06] you'll hear him calling you higher,
[3:29:09] not whipping you for the last time or
[3:29:12] judging you because you weren't doing
[3:29:13] enough. That's not who he is. That's not
[3:29:16] what he's doing today. He's just
[3:29:18] inviting us.
[3:29:23] Lord, we yield to you.
[3:29:26] We yield to you our will.
[3:29:30] And we may have to do it again tomorrow,
[3:29:31] but we will. We will because we know
[3:29:35] it's the only way. Fill us with who you
[3:29:38] are.
[3:29:39] We no longer chase a feeling.
[3:29:42] We're chasing the reality of
[3:29:44] transformation
[3:29:46] that relationship with you brings.
[3:29:50] Fathers, Lord, chains gone,
[3:29:53] lies overwritten with the truth of God's
[3:29:56] word. to no longer believe accusations
[3:30:00] uh from darkness, but to believe truth
[3:30:05] that says I can be. I am what God says I
[3:30:09] am.
[3:30:11] Are you willing to take God's word for
[3:30:13] who you are?
[3:30:15] That means you have to quit listening to
[3:30:17] the other voices.
[3:30:22] Separate yourself from unbelief.
[3:30:27] Send the moaners and the groaners out of
[3:30:28] the room. Jesus had to separate yourself
[3:30:33] from the moaners and the groaners so
[3:30:36] that you can speak with authority.
[3:30:39] Watch God help you. Watch God rescue
[3:30:41] you. He will. He is our provision. Isn't
[3:30:44] he? He He is this El Shadai,
[3:30:49] this Jehovah Gyra.
[3:30:52] It's more. It's more. It's more than
[3:30:54] just a provider.
[3:30:56] Yes, El Shadai. He's more than just the
[3:30:58] many breasted one. That word El Shadai
[3:31:01] means more than that. It also means I'm
[3:31:04] the God of ultimate ruin.
[3:31:07] And I will do I can do for you what you
[3:31:11] cannot do for yourself. No wonder we
[3:31:14] call him El Shadai.
[3:31:16] Lord, you can do for us right now in
[3:31:19] your presence what we have never been
[3:31:21] able to do for ourselves. We surrender
[3:31:23] to your sovereign grace.
[3:31:25] Woo.
[3:31:28] We're not asking you to take the burden.
[3:31:30] We're asking you to give us strength to
[3:31:33] praise you in the storm.
[3:31:38] Like oil upon your feet. Like wine for
[3:31:44] you to drink. Like water from my heart.
[3:31:48] I pour my love. I pour my love on you.
[3:31:53] If praise is like perfume,
[3:31:58] I'll lish mine on you till every drop is
[3:32:04] gone.
[3:32:06] I'll pour my love
[3:32:09] on
[3:32:11] you.
[3:32:13] Like oil upon your feet.
[3:32:17] Like wine for you to drink.
[3:32:21] Like water from my heart, I pour my love
[3:32:26] on you.
[3:32:28] Give praisees like per you. I'll lish
[3:32:34] mine on you till every drop is gone.
[3:32:40] I'll pour my love
[3:32:44] on
[3:32:46] you
[3:32:47] like oil upon your feet.
[3:32:51] like wine for you to drink,
[3:32:55] like water from my heart. I just want to
[3:32:59] pour my love on you.
[3:33:03] If praise like perume,
[3:33:07] I'll lish mine all you
[3:33:11] drop.
[3:33:14] Ask you to to just touch your neighbor,
[3:33:17] sister to sister, brother to brother. I
[3:33:19] just wanted to ask you to just whisper a
[3:33:21] prayer for one another for just a moment
[3:33:23] or or shout it out. I don't care. I'm
[3:33:26] not telling you how. I shouldn't have
[3:33:27] said it that way. I meant just join
[3:33:29] together for a moment. Lord, this is my
[3:33:32] brother. This is my sister.
[3:33:35] I don't pretend to know what they need.
[3:33:39] I don't pretend to have all the answers,
[3:33:43] but I'm asking you right now, Lord, to
[3:33:47] do what you've promised to do.
[3:33:50] Build his faith.
[3:33:53] Restore
[3:33:55] peace and joy. If it's missing,
[3:34:00] may he have an encounter with you that
[3:34:03] changes so much.
[3:34:06] May there be a a shift, a paradigm shift
[3:34:12] that takes them out of striving
[3:34:15] and interesting.
[3:34:19] Oh, if we could just trust you, Lord.
[3:34:23] There are so many people with trust
[3:34:25] issues.
[3:34:28] And I understand not trusting flesh and
[3:34:31] trusting men,
[3:34:34] but Lord, we we've got to be able to
[3:34:36] trust you.
[3:34:38] You've never had anything but our best
[3:34:40] interest in your heart.
[3:34:43] If you're doing it, you've got a purpose
[3:34:45] and a plan.
[3:34:47] Bless my brother.
[3:34:50] Bless and encourage my sister right now.
[3:34:55] May they may they have grace to birth
[3:34:58] and manifest that that's growing in
[3:35:02] their spirit
[3:35:04] that's like you that's unto you. That's
[3:35:08] for you. That's for your glory.
[3:35:10] Hallelujah.
[3:35:14] Hallelujah.
[3:35:18] Hallelujah.
[3:35:21] Let him move.
[3:35:25] I know the hour. I know how late it is.
[3:35:29] But let him move just a minute.
[3:35:34] Sometimes the Holy Spirit just wants to
[3:35:36] seal in one little tiny portion that was
[3:35:40] for you.
[3:35:42] Let him do that right now. Let him make
[3:35:44] something real to you that you will take
[3:35:46] with you when you leave here.
[3:35:50] Jesus.
[3:35:55] Three steps to overcoming.
[3:35:58] Keep your eyes on Jesus and off of
[3:36:00] people. Number one. Number two, keep
[3:36:02] your eyes on Jesus and off of people.
[3:36:05] That's number two. And then number
[3:36:06] three, keep your eyes on Jesus and off
[3:36:09] of people. If we watch one another,
[3:36:13] we'll stumble.
[3:36:15] There's a king in the house.
[3:36:18] And he tells us just look to me. Look
[3:36:20] away to me. Look away to me. Lord, I
[3:36:22] want to look above my problems, my
[3:36:24] feelings, my emotions, my circumstances.
[3:36:27] And I just want to see your face.
[3:36:30] And that means to just stand in your
[3:36:32] presence and know that it will be all
[3:36:34] right because you said so. You said so.
[3:36:39] The devil howls and says a thousand
[3:36:41] other things, but I'm tuning my my ear.
[3:36:46] Somebody ought to tell the Lord right
[3:36:47] now, I'm tuning my ear to hear your
[3:36:50] voice over my life.
[3:36:57] I'm going to ask the Lord to sanctify
[3:36:59] somebody's imagination.
[3:37:02] It needs to be sanctified.
[3:37:06] We can we can become paranoid
[3:37:09] by an unsanctified imagination. God gave
[3:37:12] you that imagination. It's a gift. is
[3:37:14] not your enemy, but it's got to be
[3:37:16] sanctified or you will create
[3:37:19] thoughts
[3:37:21] and judgments that are not right, that
[3:37:23] are not of God. You even have the
[3:37:26] ability to create memories that are not
[3:37:29] real, that do not exist. If your
[3:37:33] imagination is not sanctified under the
[3:37:35] Lord,
[3:37:39] we ask for that. We ask for our dreams
[3:37:42] to be sanctified. We don't want to be
[3:37:45] tormented in the night.
[3:37:48] You're the God in the night season just
[3:37:50] like you are in the day season.
[3:37:53] We don't want to be tormented in our
[3:37:54] sleep.
[3:37:56] We don't we don't want lustful thoughts
[3:37:59] or images to haunt us in the night or
[3:38:02] violence to haunt us in the night.
[3:38:08] May we release any
[3:38:11] traumatic thought or memory that is
[3:38:14] causing us to be hung in that cycle of
[3:38:18] darkness.
[3:38:21] It's not just light we're looking for.
[3:38:24] It's it's it's Jesus.
[3:38:29] Don't get new age. It's Jesus. He is the
[3:38:32] light. I am the light of the world.
[3:38:36] If there is a light at the end of the
[3:38:38] tunnel, guess who it is? It's Jesus.
[3:38:45] Peace. Peace be upon you.
[3:38:53] Now, love one another for just a moment.
[3:38:55] Sister Shosana wants to take just a
[3:38:58] moment to share a testimony. It has to
[3:39:00] be quick because this service is already
[3:39:02] way way over length.
[3:39:06] But I wanted you just to take a minute
[3:39:07] and hug. I know I've I know you've
[3:39:10] hugged him. You've hugged her maybe this
[3:39:12] morning already when you were getting
[3:39:14] here. But
[3:39:16] there's something something about around
[3:39:19] the altar.
[3:39:24] Wow.
[3:39:40] Thank you, Jesus.
[3:39:43] Thank you, Jesus. I hope you have the
[3:39:44] most wonderful and restful afternoon.
[3:39:48] I hope the peace of God will settle over
[3:39:50] you and when you have to go to work
[3:39:51] tomorrow, you feel renewed and
[3:39:53] strengthened.
[3:39:55] Do you know God can do that for you when
[3:39:57] your pastor takes too much time? He can
[3:40:00] make you make you uh feel rested.
[3:40:05] I believe he will if you let him.
[3:40:12] Isn't he good to us?
[3:40:17] The rest of you can slip back to your
[3:40:19] seats.
[3:40:27] I think it's on now.
[3:40:31] Want to do this for what he preached
[3:40:32] about. Wait just a moment. Make sure we
[3:40:34] can get it on.
[3:40:39] Testing. One, two, three.
[3:40:43] when he said about strange guidance,
[3:40:46] something just was like the Lord
[3:40:48] speaking to me, saying,
[3:40:51] "I need you to open your mouth and not
[3:40:54] just praise me in your home."
[3:40:57] This week, I was at the house by myself
[3:41:01] one day for a few hours and I was really
[3:41:05] struggling emotionally and I was like,
[3:41:08] "Lord, I don't understand. I don't
[3:41:10] really understand what I'm feeling. I
[3:41:12] don't know why this heaviness.
[3:41:14] And I just got thinking about the
[3:41:16] goodness of the Lord in my life and in
[3:41:18] my family. Yes. And there was such a
[3:41:21] lesson that the Lord just pressed back
[3:41:23] into my heart.
[3:41:26] And I feel like this morning, not just
[3:41:28] for me, if we were to go around this
[3:41:30] room, if we had time, each one of us
[3:41:32] could share what the Lord has done,
[3:41:34] miracle after miracle of provision after
[3:41:38] provision. And I was in my early 20s and
[3:41:41] a friend said to me, she said, "How do
[3:41:43] you know God's real?" And I said,
[3:41:45] "Honey,
[3:41:47] I knew God was real before I was 5 years
[3:41:50] old. How do you not know God is real
[3:41:52] when you have a baby sister that doctors
[3:41:54] said should be aborted because your mom
[3:41:56] wouldn't live through the pregnancy and
[3:41:58] she's now got two children of her own?"
[3:42:01] How do you not believe when you've
[3:42:04] watched your dad be struck with
[3:42:05] lightning and live? How do you not
[3:42:07] believe when your sister-in-law was told
[3:42:10] you can't have children and God gave her
[3:42:12] children? How do you not believe
[3:42:16] when your sister was healed by by the
[3:42:19] supernatural divine power of God and
[3:42:21] it's not even in there's no medical cure
[3:42:24] for lupus and there's no trace of it in
[3:42:26] her blood. They said she wouldn't live
[3:42:28] to 21. She had children. She's 50. She's
[3:42:32] alive. How do you not believe
[3:42:35] when your mom had a heart murmur and was
[3:42:39] had it from the time she was 11 12 years
[3:42:42] old and had medical proof
[3:42:45] and when she was 60 she had a heart
[3:42:48] attack and my dad called her back from
[3:42:50] the grave. He said, "I've heard that
[3:42:53] death rattle all through my life in the
[3:42:56] barn." He said, "I knew she was going
[3:42:58] and I called her back."
[3:43:00] And Timothy prayed over her and he said,
[3:43:02] "Dad, you can take her in, but they're
[3:43:04] not going to find anything wrong with
[3:43:06] her heart." He took her in and there was
[3:43:08] nothing wrong with her heart. Not even
[3:43:10] what was already it was healed after
[3:43:12] that many years. And I just kept
[3:43:14] thinking,
[3:43:16] why do I still struggle to trust him
[3:43:19] when he tells me to step out on the
[3:43:21] water? Why do I Why do I still struggle?
[3:43:24] And recently somebody asked me, they
[3:43:26] were like, "What what is, you know, your
[3:43:28] greatest accomplishment in life?" And I
[3:43:30] just got thinking about it this week and
[3:43:31] I thought, I'm just still alive
[3:43:35] by his grace. And I keep saying yes. And
[3:43:39] when I throw in the towel, he throws it
[3:43:41] back at me.
[3:43:44] And there's been so many things this
[3:43:46] past season that keep coming up and it's
[3:43:49] like it's one thing after another after
[3:43:51] another. And I can't explain the peace
[3:43:55] that doesn't come from me. And I'm so
[3:43:58] grateful
[3:43:59] because there are things that normally
[3:44:01] would shake me. And I'm just like, Lord,
[3:44:04] I don't know how you're going to do it.
[3:44:07] I don't know how you're going to
[3:44:09] provide. And then I watch you provide
[3:44:11] over and over. And this morning, I was
[3:44:13] sitting there. It was just struck my
[3:44:15] heart so heavy. You young people who
[3:44:17] aren't married,
[3:44:19] right now is the time to build your
[3:44:23] foundation. Send those taproots deep. My
[3:44:26] sisters and I have have talked about
[3:44:28] this. When we were single, we had the
[3:44:30] chance to have prayer meetings. We had
[3:44:32] the chance to to really get to know
[3:44:35] Jesus.
[3:44:38] And he gave us the strength to walk in
[3:44:41] his will. And and now is the time for
[3:44:43] you to really dig deep. I know the world
[3:44:47] will pull on you. But if you'll just
[3:44:51] if you'll just make him a priority if
[3:44:54] you'll fall in love with Jesus now,
[3:44:57] it'll set you on a secure path for the
[3:44:59] rest of your life. You won't have to
[3:45:00] worry about you missing his voice. Cuz
[3:45:03] you'll know his voice. And when you hit
[3:45:05] the heavy winds, you'll have something
[3:45:08] in your own life to look back at and
[3:45:10] say, "But my God was real then. He was
[3:45:13] real then, so he's going to be real
[3:45:15] again." Exactly. Right. Exactly. Right.
[3:45:20] Amen.
[3:45:23] Peace. Peace. Wonderful peace. Father,
[3:45:26] go with us today. Surround us with your
[3:45:29] perfect peace.
[3:45:31] You are still I am.
[3:45:34] And we bless you. We love you. We thank
[3:45:38] you for healing and ministering to every
[3:45:41] need. As we leave this place, Lord, we
[3:45:44] go with we go with you because we know
[3:45:47] that you're with us. In the name of the
[3:45:49] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Thank
[3:45:53] you. Thank you for uh hearing the Lord
[3:45:57] and thank you for all you've done today
[3:45:59] to make this service what it has been.
[3:46:02] Thank Thank you you that made the effort
[3:46:04] to be earlier. Thank you. You want
[3:46:06] prayer? We're here for that.
[3:46:10] Sure
[3:46:16] he can.
[3:46:18] Sure the Lord can.
[3:46:22] Sure the Lord can heal an abscess. Oh
[3:46:24] yes he can. Sure he can. Lord, you sent
[3:46:28] your word to heal us.
[3:46:32] And and mama's just wanting to take you
[3:46:35] at your word and believe that you'll
[3:46:38] heal. We She hates for him to lose that
[3:46:41] tooth ahead of time.
[3:46:43] Lord, we don't know what you have in
[3:46:45] this, but we do know who you are. In the
[3:46:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we stand
[3:46:52] in faith believing for healing to go
[3:46:55] into that area of his mouth
[3:47:00] and bring restoration and healing. Let
[3:47:03] that infection pass from his mouth.
[3:47:07] leave his body in the name of Jesus.
[3:47:11] Lord, it must warm your heart for
[3:47:15] somebody to step up and say, "We we are
[3:47:18] going to we're going to the dentist.
[3:47:20] They want to we we've got a plan, but
[3:47:22] but I know you can heal him. Lord,
[3:47:26] there are people still on this earth who
[3:47:29] believe that you are Jesus Christ the
[3:47:32] same yesterday and today and forever.
[3:47:36] Won't you manifest yourself in Ezekiel's
[3:47:39] body for the glory of God? Hallelujah.
[3:47:45] You believe with us, Taliana?
[3:47:48] You believe Ezekiel?
[3:47:51] My pleasure. Don't ever hesitate to
[3:47:54] interrupt for that. That's why we're
[3:47:57] here. God bless you. You're dismissed to
[3:48:00] go today in the name of the Lord. Peace.
[3:48:04] Peace bless you. God's wonderful
[3:48:10] peace
[3:48:12] coming down. All this sweet love from
[3:48:16] the father
[3:48:18] above
[3:48:21] now. You all don't be jealous of all
[3:48:23] this love I'm getting. God bless you.
[3:48:26] God bless you. Oh,
[3:48:30] forever no collisions.
[3:48:32] I pray. I love you.
[3:48:35] [Music]
[3:48:39] Oh, sweetie. Love you.
[3:48:42] Oh, I've
[3:48:45] got peace.
[3:48:47] Wonderful peace.
[3:48:51] Wonderful
[3:48:53] peace
[3:48:55] coming down
[3:48:58] from the father. Love you above.
[3:49:03] Take that peace with you. Sweep over
[3:49:08] my spirit
[3:49:11] forever.
[3:49:14] I pray
[3:49:17] in
[3:49:18] the bless
[3:49:22] of love. One more time as you go. Well,
[3:49:26] I've got peace,
[3:49:30] peace,
[3:49:33] wonderful
[3:49:36] peace.
[3:49:37] And it's coming down
[3:49:40] from the father
[3:49:44] above.
[3:49:48] sweep over
[3:49:51] over my spirit
[3:49:54] forever.
[3:49:56] I pray
[3:49:59] in fathomless
[3:50:05] in fathomless
[3:50:08] billows
[3:50:10] in fathomless
[3:50:13] billows
[3:50:15] of love.
