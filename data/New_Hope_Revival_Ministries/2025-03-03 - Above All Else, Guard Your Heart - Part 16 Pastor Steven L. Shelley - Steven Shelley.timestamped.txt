[1:02:41] minute they see my grandparents used to
[1:02:43] do
[1:02:46] this does that
[1:02:49] help isn't the Lord good you'll never
[1:02:53] find another church like this one
[1:03:01] the problem is I get warm
[1:03:05] and I have oils on from the top of my
[1:03:08] head to the SES of my feet and when they
[1:03:10] start sweating down my
[1:03:12] face uh they must get in my glasses and
[1:03:15] it's hard to get it off but we want to
[1:03:17] say that uh we're just thankful for the
[1:03:20] grace of the Lord and my kids have taken
[1:03:23] such good care of my boys and my
[1:03:25] daughter in in law or some people say in
[1:03:29] love or we'll just say bonus daughter
[1:03:32] they've taken such good care of me this
[1:03:34] weekend I did miss my wife and uh Olivia
[1:03:38] and Mariah but I didn't want for
[1:03:40] anything or lack for anything and even
[1:03:43] had a text yesterday that said you want
[1:03:44] me to come down and make you a cup of
[1:03:46] coffee and uh I'm just well taken care
[1:03:49] of spoiled I think is another way of
[1:03:51] putting it but anyway moving right along
[1:03:54] Cade's birthday is today and I'm glad he
[1:03:56] got to see his mom and dad uh for the
[1:03:59] weekend and there were special meetings
[1:04:01] there I streamed last night in a little
[1:04:04] piece of this morning a young brother
[1:04:06] from North Carolina uh was preaching the
[1:04:09] meetings his name is brother Seth coffee
[1:04:12] I don't know him I've never heard him
[1:04:13] Minister before but I sure appreciated
[1:04:17] the the demeanor and and and the
[1:04:19] sweetness and and humility of his
[1:04:23] delivery 30 years ago in the uh circles
[1:04:28] that I used to move in ministers were
[1:04:31] humble and they didn't think that they
[1:04:34] were't much and God used them in Mighty
[1:04:37] ways they didn't have to do a lot of
[1:04:40] disclaimers in those days you know
[1:04:42] apologize for having a dream or
[1:04:44] apologize for having a spiritual vision
[1:04:46] or they just told it and people chose to
[1:04:49] believe or not and I appreciated the
[1:04:52] Young Brother as he ministered last
[1:04:54] night he shared A tes Tony of their
[1:04:57] youngest baby I think maybe just a
[1:04:59] little over six months old little girl I
[1:05:01] believe and um she was uh tested for
[1:05:06] hearing in the hospital and was told
[1:05:09] that she completely failed in one ear
[1:05:12] and uh before they left the hospital
[1:05:15] they did another test and she failed
[1:05:17] again in that one ear and they seemed to
[1:05:21] be quite concerned about it and brother
[1:05:23] Seth was telling this test ony and he
[1:05:26] said I I just took the song I speak the
[1:05:29] name of
[1:05:32] jesuso and I just put that song right up
[1:05:34] to that ear that wasn't come on now boy
[1:05:38] I about jumped out of my chair but I
[1:05:41] might would have hurt myself because
[1:05:43] it's not the kind that you do like this
[1:05:45] any it's all remote control so I had to
[1:05:47] get my but I had to get my remote to get
[1:05:49] up or I might trip getting out of it but
[1:05:52] anyway I wanted to get up so I just kind
[1:05:54] of jumped up and down in the recliner
[1:05:57] you ever never
[1:05:58] mind I got so excited he said I just put
[1:06:02] that song up I just want to speak the
[1:06:05] name of
[1:06:07] Jesus and he said Lord I'm speaking your
[1:06:11] name I'm letting your name be declared
[1:06:13] in that ear I'm believing you are the
[1:06:17] same Jesus what kind of Miracles could
[1:06:20] we see if we believed he was the same we
[1:06:23] say we believe it but if we really
[1:06:25] really believed it I wonder what we
[1:06:27] would see the Lord do and he said I just
[1:06:30] believe that you're the same God today
[1:06:32] that you always were and that you are
[1:06:34] able to heal my daughter and he I don't
[1:06:38] know how many times he did that but the
[1:06:41] the first checkup back uh his wife went
[1:06:44] he wasn't maybe I think it didn't sound
[1:06:46] like he was able to go and they tested
[1:06:49] that ear and it not only passed but
[1:06:52] passed at the highest
[1:06:54] percentage totally well totally
[1:06:59] healed Skeptics might would say well it
[1:07:02] was just a fluke well it could have been
[1:07:04] once but they did it twice and there is
[1:07:07] something in me that chooses to believe
[1:07:10] I would rather
[1:07:12] believe it's easier for me to believe
[1:07:15] that it was a miracle it is it's easier
[1:07:18] for me to believe it was a miracle than
[1:07:20] than a a malfunction of the equipment or
[1:07:24] operator error I believe God did exactly
[1:07:27] what that little brother believed him to
[1:07:30] do and I was happy that our girls could
[1:07:34] sit under that kind of just real humble
[1:07:37] Ministry and he preached on uh an
[1:07:41] opportunity uh not missing your
[1:07:43] opportunity with the Lord and He
[1:07:45] preached about Jesus sitting with dirty
[1:07:48] feet and here come a woman in who didn't
[1:07:51] miss her
[1:07:53] opportunity Jesus spoke to to Simon who
[1:07:56] the the owner of the party the house and
[1:08:00] and he said uh this woman from the time
[1:08:03] I've come in she has not ceased to
[1:08:07] anoint my feet with ointment you didn't
[1:08:11] give me a greeting you didn't welcome me
[1:08:13] you you didn't anoint this was the
[1:08:15] customary way of welcoming an invited
[1:08:18] guest into your home you didn't do that
[1:08:21] but this
[1:08:22] woman someone said well if he was a
[1:08:24] prophet he would have known you know
[1:08:26] what kind of woman that was he
[1:08:28] knew the reality is it didn't matter
[1:08:33] anymore she didn't miss her OPP wasn't
[1:08:36] that great somebody said well that's
[1:08:39] just so simple well that's about what we
[1:08:41] need in the hour we're living in we we
[1:08:44] we really do if if th brother random
[1:08:47] talked about the preacher and he said if
[1:08:49] he to went up like he come down or come
[1:08:51] up like he went up down or however it
[1:08:54] went if he would have been as humble in
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] beginning if we would you and I look
[1:09:01] what God could
[1:09:02] do so we just send out a happy birthday
[1:09:05] to Kate even though he's not here
[1:09:07] tomorrow is Brother David and sister

[1:11:39] verse it says Pride goeth Before
[1:11:45] Destruction and un huy
[1:11:49] spirit
[1:11:51] before uh a
[1:11:53] fall I I would was going to look at that
[1:11:56] verse in other translations I did and I
[1:11:59] was going to mention one or two if I
[1:12:01] needed to this morning but oddly they
[1:12:05] all just about said the same thing which
[1:12:09] is always a good thing because it means
[1:12:12] that it means that the translators of
[1:12:14] the King James were sticking very close
[1:12:17] to the original language in this
[1:12:19] particular case one uh one translation
[1:12:24] might have been uh Dr Stern complete
[1:12:26] Jewish Bible uh he said that the word
[1:12:30] could either mean fall or
[1:12:33] failure I like that because that's what
[1:12:35] a fall is pride goeth Before Destruction
[1:12:39] and an huy spirit before a fall or a
[1:12:44] failure now look at Ezekiel with me just
[1:12:47] a moment chapter 28 we are in a
[1:12:53] series above all all
[1:12:57] else I think
[1:12:59] we're how many in quite a few
[1:13:02] in uh we'd have to look on the app I
[1:13:04] don't remember how many this particular
[1:13:07] part of the series is a comprehensive
[1:13:10] teaching on the spirit of
[1:13:12] offense and another subcategory we are
[1:13:16] talking about the characteristics and
[1:13:18] strongholds of offense and what it can
[1:13:22] do in a believer's life
[1:13:25] now we have finished anger and temper we
[1:13:29] studied both temper and Temperance what
[1:13:32] was Temperance Temperance was
[1:13:34] self-control wasn't it and today we're
[1:13:37] going to begin to look at a deadly
[1:13:40] Trio when pride and haughtiness are
[1:13:44] partnered with
[1:13:46] offense it becomes a road to bondage and
[1:13:49] deception so that is the subtitle of the
[1:13:53] sermon this morning the deadly Trio
[1:13:56] Pride haughtiness partnered with offense
[1:13:59] it becomes the road to bondage and
[1:14:01] deception Ezekiel 28 beginning in verse
[1:14:05] 12 we'll read all the way to verse 19
[1:14:08] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[1:14:12] the king of Ty and say unto him thus
[1:14:16] saith the Lord God thou seest up the sum
[1:14:22] full of wisdom I'm not and Perfect full
[1:14:26] of wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou
[1:14:31] Hast been in Eden the Garden of God
[1:14:35] every precious stone was thy covering
[1:14:38] the sardius topaz the diamond the barrel
[1:14:41] the onx The Jasper the sapphire the
[1:14:45] emerald the carbuncle and gold the
[1:14:48] workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy
[1:14:53] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[1:15:00] that thou was created now let's catch
[1:15:03] just the latter part of that verse
[1:15:05] again the workmanship of thy tabrets and
[1:15:10] of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the
[1:15:15] day that thou
[1:15:18] was created it sounds like Ezekiel is
[1:15:22] prophesying he is to an Earthly King he
[1:15:26] is but he is comparing him to
[1:15:32] another another
[1:15:34] being the king was
[1:15:37] born but this being was
[1:15:42] created and in him in his creation there
[1:15:46] were
[1:15:48] tabrets and
[1:15:50] pipes and they were prepared in him in
[1:15:54] the day
[1:15:55] that he was created Thou Art the
[1:15:59] anointed
[1:16:01] cherub that
[1:16:04] coverthe
[1:16:06] so thou was upon the holy mountain of
[1:16:10] God thou Hast walked up and down in the
[1:16:13] midst of the stones of
[1:16:16] fire thou was perfect
[1:16:21] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[1:16:25] thou was
[1:16:27] created till
[1:16:29] iniquity was found in thee perfect in
[1:16:36] creation
[1:16:38] beautiful
[1:16:40] unique
[1:16:41] unusual I haven't read of any other
[1:16:44] creature being created with
[1:16:47] music in his
[1:16:51] body because of that it is believed that
[1:16:56] Lucifer had something to do with perhaps
[1:17:00] leading the host in worship to the great
[1:17:04] king if you look at this in the Hebrew
[1:17:08] it indicates that as he
[1:17:11] moved there was a
[1:17:13] sound think of this that emitted from
[1:17:16] his body like beautiful music unto the
[1:17:20] Lord I've never seen a creature like
[1:17:23] that he was perfect in all of his ways
[1:17:27] from the day that he was created till
[1:17:32] iniquity was found in thee by the
[1:17:35] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[1:17:38] filled the midst of thee with violence
[1:17:41] and thou Hast sinned therefore I will
[1:17:45] cast thee as a profane out of the
[1:17:48] Mountain of
[1:17:49] God you're out of here and I will
[1:17:53] destroy thee oh whole covering cherub
[1:17:58] now to the commentators who would
[1:18:00] speculate that he is only speaking to an
[1:18:03] Earthly King it just doesn't fit it just
[1:18:07] doesn't
[1:18:08] fit I will cast thee as profane out of
[1:18:13] the Mountain of God and I will destroy
[1:18:16] thee all covering cherub from the midst
[1:18:21] of the stones of fire verse 17 thine
[1:18:24] heart was lifted up hear
[1:18:27] us this is the very definition of pride
[1:18:31] the lifting up of the
[1:18:34] heart when you begin to lift up your own
[1:18:38] mind will and
[1:18:40] emotions that's what it means when when
[1:18:43] you begin to walk a certain way because
[1:18:46] you think you are somebody or you have
[1:18:50] arrived when you begin to uh treat
[1:18:53] others like you're the big eye and
[1:18:57] they're the little
[1:18:58] 's you are mimicking the
[1:19:02] behavior of this
[1:19:05] cherub we are we have some of us have
[1:19:09] been guilty at times in our life maybe
[1:19:12] all of us to a certain extent I know I
[1:19:14] know women who are humble in every way
[1:19:17] except their
[1:19:22] recipes so proud that's my recipe
[1:19:26] well it may be yours now but unless you
[1:19:28] created it from
[1:19:30] scratch somebody else had it too you
[1:19:33] know well I don't want anybody to know
[1:19:35] because what's in it because then
[1:19:37] they'll bring it to the church dinner
[1:19:39] what's wrong with having
[1:19:41] two so so I just want you to know you
[1:19:44] can have pride in the in your in your
[1:19:47] automobile you can have pride in your
[1:19:49] recipe you can have pride in your little
[1:19:52] Instagram world
[1:19:56] you know this beautiful world that you
[1:19:58] pose
[1:19:59] for God sees it and when you get Pride
[1:20:04] mixing together partnering together with
[1:20:07] a wound with an
[1:20:09] offense it becomes a
[1:20:12] stronghold and what the prophet tells us
[1:20:15] then is you will begin to worship the
[1:20:21] spirit remember the man that fell at his
[1:20:24] feet
[1:20:25] he said the the reason why he was in
[1:20:27] that condition is he had worshiped the
[1:20:30] spirit that had possessed him that
[1:20:32] doesn't mean he said oh uh you precious
[1:20:35] wonderful spirit that has possessed me
[1:20:37] it means that he began to take
[1:20:40] pride in his
[1:20:44] opinion in his Outlook in the way he's
[1:20:48] always done it I'm going to
[1:20:51] preach so get in here now while I'm
[1:20:54] you're standing well so am I thine heart
[1:20:57] was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou
[1:21:00] Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of
[1:21:03] thy brightness I will cast thee to the
[1:21:07] ground I will lay thee before kings that
[1:21:12] they may behold thee thou Hast defiled
[1:21:15] thy
[1:21:17] sanctuaries not mine
[1:21:20] thine you have defiled my sanctuaries is
[1:21:23] the Lord talking by the multitude of
[1:21:26] thine
[1:21:28] iniquities created first in
[1:21:31] Perfection and then iniquity was found
[1:21:35] by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[1:21:39] will I bring forth a fire from the midst
[1:21:42] of
[1:21:44] thee right out of the creation itself
[1:21:48] there will come a
[1:21:50] fire and it will I will devour it shall
[1:21:54] devour thee and I will bring thee to
[1:21:57] ashes upon the Earth in the sight of all
[1:22:00] them that behold thee one of these
[1:22:03] days he's he's cast out already but one
[1:22:07] of these
[1:22:09] days you're going to walk by wag your
[1:22:12] head and Mock and you're going to say
[1:22:15] you mean to tell me that's the
[1:22:18] devil that harassed the Bride of Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ and shook the kingdoms and
[1:22:23] nations of the world and they that Know
[1:22:25] Thee among the people shall be
[1:22:27] astonished at thee Thou shalt be a
[1:22:29] terror and never shalt thou be anymore
[1:22:33] does that sound like total Annihilation
[1:22:35] to you you're never going to be anymore
[1:22:39] Lord we need you today we we are
[1:22:43] addressing offense we have all been
[1:22:47] offended we have been wounded the
[1:22:50] deepest wounds that we have received
[1:22:53] have not been from the those that hated
[1:22:55] us they have been from those who loved
[1:22:58] us from those that we loved the deepest
[1:23:02] scars that we carry most of us are
[1:23:06] Church
[1:23:07] scars Church hurts Church
[1:23:10] wounds and it has misaligned and
[1:23:14] misshaped many of us until we cannot be
[1:23:18] guided we cannot be pastored we cannot
[1:23:20] be
[1:23:21] instructed but Lord we have come come to
[1:23:25] the understanding that if we're going to
[1:23:27] win we got to win this last
[1:23:30] battle this last battle and it's fought
[1:23:35] in the
[1:23:36] mind in the mind and so Lord we've come
[1:23:40] back to you to address our hurts our
[1:23:42] wounds those that we have not yet been
[1:23:45] able to turn loose of and we have seen
[1:23:48] that in Anger when anger gets connected
[1:23:51] and now we're going to look at when
[1:23:52] pride gets connected it becomes a
[1:23:56] stronghold and uh we could die this way
[1:24:00] if it were not for your mercy but in
[1:24:02] your mercy you have said I'm going to
[1:24:04] have a people who win the last
[1:24:07] battle the battle that started in heaven
[1:24:10] and is now on Earth you said I'm going
[1:24:13] to have a people that'll win it well in
[1:24:15] order to win that we've got to depend on
[1:24:18] you like never before we want to say
[1:24:21] today we need you
[1:24:24] not ashamed to say we've got to have
[1:24:28] you not just on Sunday and Tuesday but
[1:24:31] on every day and every hour and every
[1:24:34] moment of every day come Lord bring us
[1:24:39] together into a place of Faith pull that
[1:24:42] you can Minister and help us with these
[1:24:46] things and we'll give you glory and
[1:24:48] honor and praise for it's in the name of
[1:24:50] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:24:53] Saints said am amen can you put the
[1:24:56] title up you may be seated can you put
[1:24:59] the title up that that is a when you get
[1:25:02] the when you get the notes and yes
[1:25:05] several have asked yes you can have the
[1:25:08] notes the reason why I haven't given to
[1:25:10] you uh them to you already is because
[1:25:13] I've started more than one set of
[1:25:15] documents and and then I have to go back
[1:25:17] and put them all together so uh when I
[1:25:20] do that you can have them all we can
[1:25:22] have them in an ebook form or however
[1:25:24] you want them and you'll have the
[1:25:26] scriptures and the quotes and and the
[1:25:29] and some of the thoughts and I I pray
[1:25:31] that it will continue to help you in the
[1:25:33] future so we're looking at a a second
[1:25:38] set of spirits and influences that that
[1:25:43] like to operate together we're looking
[1:25:45] at prideful Behavior arrogance
[1:25:49] haughtiness self-centered focus a focus
[1:25:53] on self
[1:25:54] partnering with the spirit of Pride now
[1:25:57] that seems so complicated but we're
[1:25:59] we've lived
[1:26:01] it so so don't get caught up in the
[1:26:03] semantics of what we're trying to
[1:26:06] describe it's a deadly Trio that I want
[1:26:08] you to know when when pride is involved
[1:26:11] offense goes deeper right because when
[1:26:15] you think you're right and everybody
[1:26:17] else is
[1:26:19] wrong not even the Bible can help
[1:26:23] you it it because you're that pride has
[1:26:26] become such a stronghold that that
[1:26:28] you're like the rest who say it don't
[1:26:31] really mean that I know it couldn't
[1:26:33] possibly mean that and and they're worse
[1:26:36] people are worse with the
[1:26:40] quotes than they are with the
[1:26:43] scripture worse they will take a
[1:26:46] paragraph a piece of a paragraph out of
[1:26:48] context that has no root no Foundation
[1:26:53] at all all in the
[1:26:56] scripture and they will say things like
[1:26:58] his opinion means more to me than
[1:27:00] anything
[1:27:01] else well I want you to know something
[1:27:04] you're not going to make it on
[1:27:07] opinion let's be bold you're only going
[1:27:10] to make it by the
[1:27:13] word that's the only way we can make it
[1:27:16] so don't take things out of context
[1:27:18] leave them in there and you'll be able
[1:27:20] to understand what he
[1:27:22] said uh we don't want to do that because
[1:27:24] we want every bit of this I just don't
[1:27:26] believe somebody said to me recently I
[1:27:28] just don't believe we're going to get
[1:27:29] all this sorted out in our life before
[1:27:31] the Rapture well we are because he's not
[1:27:34] coming back for a handicapped bride he's
[1:27:39] not coming back for a people who
[1:27:41] couldn't overcome the spirit of the age
[1:27:43] if there's anything I know about what
[1:27:45] the bride is destined to do the prophet
[1:27:47] said she is destined to overcome the
[1:27:51] spirit of her age and if you don't think
[1:27:55] that offense and
[1:27:56] pride and people's rights my rights and
[1:28:00] your rights if you don't think that's a
[1:28:02] part of the last age you you didn't hear
[1:28:05] the
[1:28:05] sermons he told us that that that spirit
[1:28:09] of leoda it's the age of people's
[1:28:12] rights and and demanding their rights
[1:28:15] and that's where we are uh it's it's one
[1:28:18] thing for that to go on out there it's
[1:28:21] another thing for that to go on in the
[1:28:23] bride amen if you are laboring under
[1:28:28] offense you're not overcoming I'm going
[1:28:30] to be bold this morning if you're
[1:28:32] laboring under anger and temper you are
[1:28:35] not overcoming not now you may overcome
[1:28:40] tomorrow but why don't we start
[1:28:42] practicing today there's no condemnation
[1:28:45] in this this is simply my position what
[1:28:49] I've been called to do and that is show
[1:28:51] the house to the house and whoever
[1:28:54] desires to hear this it's there it's
[1:28:56] available I I get I get shocked every
[1:28:59] week with people who reach out and say
[1:29:02] I've been streaming for three years been
[1:29:05] streaming for two years we've never
[1:29:07] heard from them didn't know they were
[1:29:08] out there and they begin to unfold the
[1:29:10] testimony of what God has been doing in
[1:29:13] their life that's precious but our focus
[1:29:16] is here this is our number one
[1:29:19] responsibility and that is that all of
[1:29:21] us I will will I believe I believe that
[1:29:26] this is to be an overcoming
[1:29:29] people we can't overcome what we don't
[1:29:32] understand we can't overcome what we
[1:29:34] don't
[1:29:35] recognize if we keep putting ourselves
[1:29:38] out and shoveling it like this you know
[1:29:41] we're we're amening but we're dropping
[1:29:43] amen bombs cuz we want somebody else to
[1:29:46] hear it well if you'll hush they'll hear
[1:29:49] it it's not the it's not the verbal amen
[1:29:53] we're running after but I do need them
[1:29:54] by the way it helps me keep moving but
[1:29:57] it's a heart's amen it's the amen that
[1:30:00] says me and Jesus can do this we can get
[1:30:03] out from under the heaviness of offense
[1:30:06] we can get out from under Pride if I
[1:30:09] were to ask around this room who is
[1:30:11] living in a stronghold of Pride very few
[1:30:15] people would be proud enough to say
[1:30:18] me but the reality is pride is so much
[1:30:22] more than what we have thought
[1:30:27] what if I told you that there's a
[1:30:29] portion of
[1:30:33] depression that's directly related to
[1:30:39] Pride I I didn't say all depression but
[1:30:42] there's a portion of depression because
[1:30:45] what the enemy desires to do is have you
[1:30:48] to focus on
[1:30:50] you woe is me
[1:30:54] nobody understands what I'm going
[1:30:56] through and we may think that that is
[1:30:59] pitiful humility but no no no what it
[1:31:01] really is is false
[1:31:03] humility and false humility is pride we
[1:31:07] have not began to overcome these things
[1:31:10] until we can see ourselves as part of a
[1:31:13] body as part of a team if one succeeds
[1:31:16] we all can succeed if one fails we all
[1:31:20] take the failure because it's our it's
[1:31:23] our responsibility to help that one to
[1:31:26] restore that one to get up and go on
[1:31:30] they may never have the
[1:31:33] pulpit but they can have the
[1:31:36] victory the personal victory over
[1:31:39] everything the enemy has used to trip
[1:31:41] and trap them amen so we're going to go
[1:31:44] on now I want to introduce this by just
[1:31:47] telling you a few things about uh about
[1:31:50] pride pride haughtiness
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] arrogance are spiritual
[1:31:58] forces it's not personality
[1:32:02] quirks it's spiritual
[1:32:05] forces that seek to work together
[1:32:09] partner with an offense leading the
[1:32:13] believer into deception and
[1:32:17] bondage I don't know if it's always
[1:32:19] deception and then bondage sometimes
[1:32:21] it's bondage and then deception
[1:32:24] but the enemy wants to
[1:32:27] deceive now ultimately we know that he
[1:32:30] cannot deceive the bride but the
[1:32:33] scripture says that he would deceive the
[1:32:37] elect if it were possible what he can do
[1:32:42] is dissuade us discourage us and cause
[1:32:46] us to believe a lie and whether that lie
[1:32:50] is about the word whether that lie is
[1:32:53] about the church Church whether that lie
[1:32:55] is about the prophet or the or your
[1:32:57] pastor or whether that lie is about
[1:33:01] you a lie is a lie is a lie and a lie is
[1:33:06] deception it might be 99% truth but if
[1:33:10] there's 1% untruth it becomes a
[1:33:14] deception and I would like to say to the
[1:33:16] body that you and I believe things about
[1:33:18] ourselves that is a
[1:33:22] deception we believe things about
[1:33:24] ourselves it's just simply not true and
[1:33:28] uh someone recently uh said you know
[1:33:31] about I I I I need strength over a
[1:33:34] certain thing and I felt the unction of
[1:33:37] the Lord you you you are that you you
[1:33:40] are that listen everything you you want
[1:33:42] to be and need to be you are walking in
[1:33:45] the potential of
[1:33:47] it spiritually now you're walking in the
[1:33:51] potential of it now and there's prob
[1:33:54] only one thing in the
[1:33:55] way of you being able to be that that
[1:34:00] God said you were to
[1:34:03] be not your church your pastor your
[1:34:07] belief system your Pew
[1:34:10] neighor it's
[1:34:11] you it's me I'm in the way of me being
[1:34:17] what God and you in the way of you being
[1:34:20] so as we learn these things and we begin
[1:34:22] to practice the practical ways the Bible
[1:34:25] has told us and the message has told us
[1:34:28] that we can overcome we want everything
[1:34:31] to be
[1:34:33] Supernatural sometimes the word becomes
[1:34:36] a supernatural Revelation to us and then
[1:34:40] we have to be
[1:34:42] practical about applying what God has
[1:34:45] supernaturally made real to our spirit
[1:34:48] so the the application the
[1:34:51] doer the hearer being able to hear the
[1:34:55] word with Revelation with with
[1:34:58] understanding that's a
[1:35:00] blessing but that's actually the easy
[1:35:04] part it's easier to receive a revelation
[1:35:08] than to do
[1:35:11] one than to be one so it's not the
[1:35:15] hearing only it's the
[1:35:18] doing and that's how this little bride
[1:35:20] is going to move we're going to hear it
[1:35:22] and we're going to find his grace and
[1:35:25] strength to do it and there's going to
[1:35:28] be a people right here and all over this
[1:35:32] world in pockets of believers who will
[1:35:36] carry an unoffendable
[1:35:39] nature somebody said where's the Bible
[1:35:41] for that here it is great peace have
[1:35:44] they which love the law of God and
[1:35:48] nothing shall by any means nothing
[1:35:51] nothing shall by any means
[1:35:54] means offend them there it
[1:35:56] is now if that if the Bible says it
[1:35:59] somebody's going to live
[1:36:02] it
[1:36:04] me I'm going to live it and your heart
[1:36:07] ought to be saying
[1:36:09] me I'm going to live it let me be an
[1:36:13] anomaly Let Me Be Misunderstood let me
[1:36:16] be
[1:36:17] whatever but Lord let me be one of those
[1:36:20] who can live an undefendable life
[1:36:24] because if you can live an undefendable
[1:36:26] life you can overcome pride and anger
[1:36:28] and temper and
[1:36:33] rejection that orphan
[1:36:37] Spirit you can get out from under the
[1:36:40] twisting of
[1:36:44] python the
[1:36:46] squeezing of Python and the twisting of
[1:36:50] leviathon in the
[1:36:52] scripture those
[1:36:55] spirits that the Bible gives them
[1:36:58] names simply so that we can see how the
[1:37:02] enemy desires to use something listen
[1:37:04] listen he doesn't have to harass the
[1:37:08] addict with these
[1:37:11] issues he's got them with other
[1:37:14] hooks it's the
[1:37:16] believer it's the
[1:37:18] believer 10,000s times 10,000s of
[1:37:22] spirits l Bo not on the World At
[1:37:26] Large he said on the bride you're
[1:37:30] fighting you're fighting 10 times 10
[1:37:33] thousands of
[1:37:35] thousands multitudes of demonic spirits
[1:37:39] loosed in the last
[1:37:42] age to cause you and I to lose focus on
[1:37:47] Jesus
[1:37:48] Christ to cause us to take on social
[1:37:52] issues that have nothing to do with the
[1:37:56] word that cause us to feel like we're
[1:37:59] called to the defense of a man when
[1:38:02] we're not called to defend a man we're
[1:38:04] called to defend the word men are
[1:38:08] fallible all of
[1:38:11] them but God is Not fallible he is
[1:38:16] infallible he's infallible in creation
[1:38:19] and he is infallible in you The God Who
[1:38:23] lives In You by the Holy Spirit cannot
[1:38:27] fail but the enemy wants you and I to
[1:38:30] fall to
[1:38:32] fail well goody devil we're not going to
[1:38:36] do it we're going to overcome so pride
[1:38:39] and haughtiness and arrogance you can
[1:38:41] leave these things up until we move on
[1:38:43] for for not takers but again you can
[1:38:46] have it later our spiritual forces that
[1:38:48] work together with offense leading the
[1:38:51] believer into deception and bondage
[1:38:53] somebody said well I'm having a little
[1:38:54] problem of you you know putting all I
[1:38:56] thought this was just you know little
[1:38:57] sins or little attitudes or things that
[1:39:00] get on let me tell you something
[1:39:02] anything that promotes unbelief in
[1:39:05] you is a
[1:39:07] force working under the two
[1:39:10] forces one of the two the light the good
[1:39:15] and and the bad the dark brother Bram
[1:39:17] said God and the devil the word and the
[1:39:20] devil and we also know that whichever do
[1:39:23] we feed is the one that's going to bark
[1:39:26] the loudest and it's the one that's
[1:39:28] going to lead our life hello so we can
[1:39:32] have the V I just want you to know when
[1:39:35] you get in the thick of this that you're
[1:39:38] not being condemned from this pull pit
[1:39:41] you are being exposed because that's
[1:39:44] what the word comes to do but the same
[1:39:46] word that exposes that cuts that that
[1:39:50] sharpens is the same word that empowers
[1:39:54] that strengthens that lifts us up into
[1:39:57] the place of an
[1:39:59] overcomer Hallelujah where it just don't
[1:40:03] matter just don't matter I don't I don't
[1:40:06] want you to get so caught up in the in
[1:40:09] the politics of
[1:40:11] America there are things that just don't
[1:40:14] matter they matter in the natural
[1:40:17] perhaps but they matter some of them
[1:40:19] matter very little in the spiritual
[1:40:23] so you pray for for the body you want to
[1:40:26] pray for something pray for the body of
[1:40:28] Christ pray for the believer pray for
[1:40:31] your brothers and sisters your fellow
[1:40:33] pilgrims on this journey that all of us
[1:40:36] can get our head above the fanaticism of
[1:40:38] Leo deia embrace the engrafted
[1:40:44] word if you didn't read the devotional
[1:40:47] this week read it well I started to read
[1:40:49] it but it it seemed like it was just a
[1:40:51] repeat it is based on the sermon that
[1:40:54] you're hearing but what we have come to
[1:40:56] find out is the way to drive truth
[1:40:59] deeper into the recesses of the
[1:41:02] brain is to readdress
[1:41:07] them you know I'm not a marketer but a
[1:41:10] marketer would say
[1:41:12] repackage but readdress them and so
[1:41:15] that's what we're trying to do we're
[1:41:17] doing it in Clips we're doing it in
[1:41:19] memes we're doing it in moments we're
[1:41:22] doing it in devot
[1:41:24] tionals we're doing it by posting the
[1:41:26] entire sermon not because we have a
[1:41:29] something to
[1:41:30] promote what we have to promote is not
[1:41:33] Shelly what we have to promote is the
[1:41:35] word of God and if others don't want to
[1:41:39] do it if they're
[1:41:41] ashamed of what they have to say and
[1:41:44] they're hiding it because they're
[1:41:45] worried about casting Pearl Before Swine
[1:41:48] I want you to know there comes an hour
[1:41:50] that the plum line has to drop
[1:41:54] and people have a choice to make so we
[1:41:58] want to we want to keep coming to you so
[1:42:00] don't think and and by the way if you
[1:42:03] didn't read the devotional it was a
[1:42:05] little longer it took me forever to get
[1:42:07] through it but it was a little longer
[1:42:09] than normal and if you didn't there
[1:42:12] there is material in there that I didn't
[1:42:14] get to in the sermon so you might catch
[1:42:17] something that would be of a blessing to
[1:42:19] you we're
[1:42:21] overcoming minute by minute in
[1:42:24] it Greater is
[1:42:26] he than he that's in the world all right
[1:42:30] so the Bible warns us so please
[1:42:33] understand this isn't just personality
[1:42:35] quirks it's Spirits it's forces of hell
[1:42:39] that want to wrap you up they can't
[1:42:40] change your
[1:42:42] destiny if you ever were you always will
[1:42:44] be if he had you in your mind his mind
[1:42:48] you're still on his
[1:42:50] mind you saw your choice before you ever
[1:42:53] made it I don't believe in extreme
[1:42:56] Calvinism I don't believe God lined us
[1:42:59] up against the wall and said you will
[1:43:00] you won't you will you want I know
[1:43:02] that's how they preach it a lot around
[1:43:04] the message that's not what brother
[1:43:06] Brandon was preaching he said it's got
[1:43:09] to be scriptural and predestination is
[1:43:12] by forn
[1:43:14] knowledge it means by what God knew
[1:43:17] about you before you were ever
[1:43:20] born he knew your choice before you ever
[1:43:23] made it when we say we didn't have a
[1:43:26] choice we lie against the word we did
[1:43:29] have a choice he knew what our choice
[1:43:32] would
[1:43:34] be so he brought us to a place in life
[1:43:38] where we could make it woo Hallelujah so
[1:43:43] if he knew me that way that means he
[1:43:46] didn't just know my
[1:43:49] beginning it means he also knew
[1:43:53] my
[1:43:54] ending he knew my my past before it was
[1:43:58] my past my present before it was my
[1:44:01] present and my future before it was my
[1:44:03] future can you say amen
[1:44:07] amen the Bible warns against these
[1:44:12] attitudes and they're more than
[1:44:18] that as they often blind individuals
[1:44:23] to
[1:44:24] correction and keep them from walking in
[1:44:27] humility before
[1:44:29] God there's no pleasure in having to
[1:44:33] correct
[1:44:37] Believers I'm not just talking about
[1:44:39] what a preacher can do or what a pastor
[1:44:41] can do I'm talking about look folks the
[1:44:44] word corrects
[1:44:46] me every day of my
[1:44:49] life I I had a a message come in on
[1:44:54] messenger at 3 something this morning
[1:44:57] you didn't you didn't get up and read it
[1:44:58] at 3 something this morning no I have
[1:45:01] notifications turned off just like you
[1:45:03] do I hope and I have it set so that if
[1:45:06] it's pardon and it's from a list of of
[1:45:10] church people like a call or a or a te
[1:45:12] it'll come through but otherwise it
[1:45:15] won't but when I woke up at
[1:45:17] 6:30 I ask the Lord Lord I want to get
[1:45:20] up at 6:30
[1:45:23] and it's 6:30 on the dot he woke me up
[1:45:27] he's better than a Time clock or a alarm
[1:45:31] clock woke me up at 6:30 I rolled over
[1:45:35] to check the time yes Lord thank you
[1:45:37] Jesus 6:30 on the dot and I saw a
[1:45:41] notification and someone sent a
[1:45:43] notification and they and they were
[1:45:45] talking about some sermons that they had
[1:45:47] heard uh have you learned to love you
[1:45:50] remember
[1:45:51] those and in the expression of their
[1:45:55] thanks they mentioned a
[1:45:58] quotation and it may have come from
[1:46:01] someone of other Faith or other
[1:46:04] persuasion I don't I don't know I didn't
[1:46:06] look it up and to be honest with you at
[1:46:08] this moment I didn't even really care
[1:46:11] it's it so impacted me it corrected
[1:46:15] me and it impacted me the truth will
[1:46:21] correct us daily
[1:46:23] if we let him it's a person amen do you
[1:46:28] believe that and it talked about the
[1:46:31] highest form of
[1:46:32] love being an understanding trying to
[1:46:37] understand a
[1:46:40] person it hit me so hard I said Lord I
[1:46:43] wish I would have thought of that I wish
[1:46:45] I would have thought of that all through
[1:46:47] my life when I when I struggled to love
[1:46:51] or when I struggled
[1:46:53] to embrace or when I struggled to have
[1:46:56] real Fellowship it's simply because I
[1:46:59] realize now it's because I didn't try
[1:47:02] hard enough to understand what's going
[1:47:04] on in somebody's
[1:47:07] head sometimes we we think that someone
[1:47:10] is arrogant when in all actuality
[1:47:12] they're so
[1:47:14] absolute uh
[1:47:16] inferior they have such inferiority
[1:47:19] complexes and they feel so insecure that
[1:47:23] they put on this air and it looks like
[1:47:26] arrogance when sometimes it is simply
[1:47:29] survival have you ever known a situation
[1:47:31] like that and so I want to understand I
[1:47:34] don't want to
[1:47:36] misjudge I want to understand if you
[1:47:39] love somebody just take this home with
[1:47:41] you if you love somebody you seek to
[1:47:43] understand
[1:47:46] them I spoke to a couple this
[1:47:49] week who are planning their future
[1:47:55] and I think I might have been supposed
[1:47:57] to mention that but I didn't
[1:48:01] yet and one of the things I said to them
[1:48:04] is and you all know this we give and
[1:48:07] receive love
[1:48:10] differently you know uh psychologists
[1:48:14] tell us that men and women aren't even
[1:48:15] from the same
[1:48:17] Planet well we know we didn't come from
[1:48:20] planets but we know that in in in our
[1:48:24] wiring and in our makeup we're not the
[1:48:26] same somebody ought to say thank
[1:48:30] God it's a good thing we're not all
[1:48:33] wired the same and if we don't seek to
[1:48:37] understand the
[1:48:38] other especially the one who lives in
[1:48:40] the house with
[1:48:42] us we will continue to push them in a
[1:48:47] wrong way and and in a negative way and
[1:48:50] in a hateful way I wish you were
[1:48:53] listening instead of in a loving way and
[1:48:56] I receive love a certain way and my wife
[1:48:59] receives love a certain way and she
[1:49:01] gives love a certain way and I give love
[1:49:03] a certain way the problem in a lot of
[1:49:05] homes is that people are if you said
[1:49:08] well do you love her of course I love
[1:49:09] her but she's not getting the
[1:49:13] message you're telling me but she's not
[1:49:15] getting the message because you're not
[1:49:17] trying to understand how she receives
[1:49:20] love and if you think it's because you
[1:49:22] go go to work every day she's just uh
[1:49:24] just sitting there feeling so
[1:49:26] loved that's not the way it works she
[1:49:29] appreciates you going she appreciates
[1:49:32] the money you make she
[1:49:34] better if she's not working she's
[1:49:37] certainly better but but that's not the
[1:49:41] first thing that comes to her
[1:49:44] mind that's not the first thing that
[1:49:46] makes her feel loved it doesn't have to
[1:49:49] be a diamond ring that's Pride
[1:49:55] doesn't have to be a Hut
[1:49:58] Rod but she's got a way that when that
[1:50:03] is said or that happens it registers I'm
[1:50:07] loved the sooner that you can discover
[1:50:10] what gives her that message and send it
[1:50:13] as often as you possibly can the happier
[1:50:16] your life will be and vice versa but
[1:50:19] we've got some mules
[1:50:24] are you going to be offensive well just
[1:50:26] be glad I said a
[1:50:27] mule we've got some mules They Don't
[1:50:30] Really Care well I you know I don't you
[1:50:33] know I I I don't I don't have time for
[1:50:34] all this Hocus Pocus and and I love her
[1:50:37] and if if my paycheck don't let her know
[1:50:40] I love her and I give her a house if
[1:50:42] that don't that don't tell her I love
[1:50:43] her well you know I don't know what to
[1:50:45] do come
[1:50:49] on but don't be surprised when she has a
[1:50:51] headache
[1:50:54] a Perpetual one that never goes
[1:51:03] away Amen
[1:51:06] brother you
[1:51:08] know it it it doesn't always have to be
[1:51:10] a $100
[1:51:13] bouquet a drugstore
[1:51:18] Carnation there there are women I want
[1:51:21] you to know there's some high price
[1:51:23] women in this world few few in the
[1:51:27] church and they may not get excited over
[1:51:30] a
[1:51:32] carnation but there are women here that
[1:51:35] would be so wives here that would be so
[1:51:40] delighted you stop to get
[1:51:43] gas and you just run in I know it's
[1:51:46] extra you pay it to pump you could just
[1:51:49] make it very quick but you run in and
[1:51:51] you get one those flowers sitting at the
[1:51:54] counter just in a bucket sometimes about
[1:51:57] half faded you bought that or a candy
[1:52:00] bar she doesn't really need a candy
[1:52:03] bar but on
[1:52:06] occasion just the thought do you
[1:52:08] understand what I'm saying just the
[1:52:12] thought and people don't want to do the
[1:52:15] work to build
[1:52:18] relationship not only husbands and wives
[1:52:20] but friendships
[1:52:22] the world has cheapened the whole idea
[1:52:25] of friends I've got
[1:52:28] 5,000 plus friends on
[1:52:34] Facebook whoop he
[1:52:36] do how many of them are going to come to
[1:52:39] my
[1:52:41] rescue how many of them are really going
[1:52:43] to pray for me I don't mean just praying
[1:52:46] hands I mean on their face my God I'm
[1:52:50] calling out to you for my brother other
[1:52:53] so don't let friendship be cheapened in
[1:52:56] your mind because of the world we're
[1:52:57] living in right now build
[1:52:59] relationships strong ones that Satan
[1:53:03] can't get between he will if you let
[1:53:06] him if if we seek to understand one
[1:53:09] another and and catch a glimpse of each
[1:53:11] other's heart we would know that as
[1:53:14] brothers and sisters I'm I'm always
[1:53:16] impressed with Nathan when he
[1:53:19] prays I'm always impressed that every
[1:53:21] time he meet mentions this body of
[1:53:23] Believers he chokes
[1:53:25] up this precious family of
[1:53:30] God the Saints of the Lord in this place
[1:53:35] and he chokes up I like
[1:53:38] it it reminds
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:42] me when I have spent 15 hours in
[1:53:46] counselling from Sunday night until I
[1:53:49] see you again on Tuesday night and I'm
[1:53:51] wore out with people problems just be
[1:53:54] honest sometime not all the time but
[1:53:56] sometime and to hear Nathan get up and
[1:53:59] say oh God I just want to thank you for
[1:54:02] this body of Believers and choke up it's
[1:54:05] it's like a good a good
[1:54:08] piercing it strikes my heart and I
[1:54:11] remember who we are and who I am and
[1:54:15] what my responsibility is and I remember
[1:54:17] the reality that you're the most
[1:54:19] valuable I want you to know you're so
[1:54:22] valuable in the economy of God your you
[1:54:25] matter your feelings matter your needs
[1:54:28] matter because you're precious to him
[1:54:31] you you you're precious to us and we
[1:54:35] need to see each other that way seek to
[1:54:37] understand the weirdnesses and the
[1:54:40] wonkiness of of each other's life and
[1:54:44] and be willing to help pray him through
[1:54:46] it or pray her through it to the next
[1:54:49] Victory we're going higher because the
[1:54:52] word is going
[1:54:54] higher
[1:54:57] Hallelujah well that's my story and I'm
[1:54:59] sticking to it this study examines how
[1:55:03] these Spirits operate and how Believers
[1:55:05] can overcome them through biblical truth
[1:55:09] and through spiritual discernment we
[1:55:11] need to we need not just preachers not
[1:55:15] just fivefold ministers we need the
[1:55:18] Discerning of spirits in our individual
[1:55:21] lives
[1:55:23] the Bible tells us I know that many
[1:55:24] people have put the gifts on the shelf
[1:55:27] and out the door in the back room until
[1:55:29] they no longer
[1:55:31] exist but the Bible tells us and if
[1:55:33] brother brandham truly preached what
[1:55:36] Paul
[1:55:38] preached if he truly preached what Paul
[1:55:42] preached and I believe he did then we
[1:55:45] can't make him
[1:55:46] say what Paul didn't say about the same
[1:55:51] subject
[1:55:53] you don't have to say
[1:55:56] Amen you don't have to say Amen there
[1:55:59] are thousands and millions perhaps
[1:56:02] screamed out we're counting on
[1:56:04] that you see we forget that little tiny
[1:56:07] quote where the the prophet reminds us
[1:56:10] that that seventh angel messenger when
[1:56:12] when the messenger of the seventh angel
[1:56:15] uh is on the scene he said he will have
[1:56:18] no message of his own right
[1:56:26] nothing new isin't that
[1:56:29] interesting he is to tie
[1:56:34] together his message is the tying
[1:56:37] together of all the Loose Ends of all
[1:56:40] the other Church ages isn't that
[1:56:43] marvelous that God would send the
[1:56:46] seventh the
[1:56:48] completion the Perfection and it would
[1:56:51] simply be the weaving together of truths
[1:56:56] that weren't fully known fully revealed
[1:56:59] fully explain and and God would use one
[1:57:03] under the spirit of Elijah who was a
[1:57:06] tishbite the tishbites were
[1:57:09] Weavers one who would weave together
[1:57:12] these little uh ends and pieces and make
[1:57:16] us a picture of Jesus Christ like has
[1:57:20] never been seen before
[1:57:22] because each age was just getting a
[1:57:24] piece you come down to the seventh age
[1:57:27] and you've got all the pieces coming
[1:57:29] together and and Jesus is no longer
[1:57:32] behind the
[1:57:33] lattice somebody ought to hear him he's
[1:57:36] no longer behind the lattice he's now
[1:57:38] coming around in plain view who is this
[1:57:43] that I see coming out of the
[1:57:46] Wilderness leaning on his
[1:57:50] beloved her excuse me leaning on her
[1:57:54] beloved it's the bride leaning on the
[1:57:58] groom and you notice the scripture tells
[1:58:01] us she
[1:58:02] smells like
[1:58:10] him you ever hugged a sister hugged a
[1:58:14] sister
[1:58:15] and you could go on out in the toward
[1:58:17] the car and you still smell her perfume
[1:58:25] sometimes I can smell your perfume up
[1:58:28] here and that means you put on too
[1:58:35] much it's just supposed to linger when
[1:58:38] you when you walk away just the just the
[1:58:41] light fragrance of it's supposed to just
[1:58:45] through the air it's so much better than
[1:58:47] some things we can smell she smells like
[1:58:51] him because she's been leaning on him
[1:58:55] because she's been depending on him
[1:58:57] because she's kept her head on his chest
[1:59:01] as often as she possibly can and now she
[1:59:04] carries his fragrance sister Anita wrote
[1:59:07] the song which is a
[1:59:11] mixture it's myrr and alows it's myrr
[1:59:15] and sweet calamus it's it's
[1:59:18] bitter and it's sweet because this life
[1:59:23] is a the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:59:25] your life is is a is a a life of both
[1:59:30] suffering and
[1:59:34] blessing if you didn't suffer and you
[1:59:37] didn't know his Blessing you wouldn't
[1:59:39] smell like him Lord I want to smell like
[1:59:43] you in a in a stinky World in a stinking
[1:59:49] family in a stinking Society
[1:59:53] I want to smell like him are you with me
[1:59:56] the first sin didn't take place in Earth
[2:00:00] the first sin the first Rebellion the
[2:00:02] first failure took place in heaven God
[2:00:07] didn't he wasn't shocked it didn't take
[2:00:11] him by
[2:00:12] surprise he knew when he created that
[2:00:15] creature so beautiful so
[2:00:18] lovely so Deon Aire so so intricately
[2:00:23] designed and made that when he
[2:00:26] moved sound glorious sound emitted from
[2:00:31] his physical anatomy in some way that we
[2:00:34] don't understand like a human music box
[2:00:38] or
[2:00:39] something the the that word there we'll
[2:00:42] look at it in a moment it it helps us to
[2:00:45] see but it was in his heart that
[2:00:49] iniquity that transgression was found
[2:00:52] and uh although we can't particularly
[2:00:55] say that God put it there we know that
[2:00:58] he knew it was
[2:01:05] there and was probably
[2:01:09] there in his
[2:01:13] mind all
[2:01:15] along not yet
[2:01:18] manifesting someone said what how would
[2:01:20] you make such a a statement like that
[2:01:22] because brother brandom connected Judas
[2:01:24] to the
[2:01:27] Antichrist didn't he and when he goes
[2:01:30] back to the Garden he talks about Cain
[2:01:33] who was of the wicked
[2:01:35] one and when he refers back to that
[2:01:39] betrayal he talks about the fact that he
[2:01:42] was a
[2:01:44] devil from the
[2:01:47] beginning that means god knew what he
[2:01:49] was when he made him right you follow
[2:01:52] that in the message that day on Calvary
[2:01:56] let's look at this and sin did not start
[2:01:59] on the earth sin started in heaven
[2:02:04] Lucifer the devil was a condemned
[2:02:06] creature for his
[2:02:08] Disobedience before he ever struck the
[2:02:12] Earth and that would have been in the
[2:02:14] fall sin began in heaven where God put
[2:02:18] the angels and so forth upon the same
[2:02:21] basis that he put human beings on
[2:02:24] knowledge the tree of knowledge that
[2:02:27] means he gave the Angels the ability to
[2:02:31] choose the tree of life and the tree of
[2:02:35] knowledge where man could take his
[2:02:39] choice and when Lucifer was given the
[2:02:42] pinenes to make his choice he wanted
[2:02:47] something better than God had right
[2:02:54] Isaiah tells us Ezekiel tells
[2:02:57] us and when Lucifer was given the
[2:03:00] pinenes to make the choice his choice he
[2:03:04] wanted something better than God had
[2:03:06] that started the trouble are you
[2:03:09] following him he said and there was a
[2:03:12] requirement for sin the requirement
[2:03:15] was death death was the penalty and that
[2:03:18] is we could go into great details of
[2:03:21] this because I do not believe that there
[2:03:23] is but one death there is one
[2:03:26] life are you following and I believe a
[2:03:30] man that has eternal
[2:03:33] life can never die and I believe there
[2:03:36] is a complete annihilation of that
[2:03:39] soul that
[2:03:44] sins we don't have to argue over it
[2:03:46] because the Bible said so doesn't it
[2:03:52] the
[2:03:53] soul that
[2:03:55] sinth shall surely
[2:04:02] die it's good to understand what the
[2:04:05] soul
[2:04:06] is and what the spirit
[2:04:09] is the soul that sinth it shall surely
[2:04:12] die not the man the soul that sinth so
[2:04:16] Satan must surely die to be completely
[2:04:20] destroyed how I dis dis agree with the
[2:04:22] universalists that say that Satan will
[2:04:25] be saved I I'm amazed to know that that
[2:04:28] lie was operating in the 50s and
[2:04:32] 60s sometimes it's called now
[2:04:35] universalism and has some ultimate
[2:04:38] reconciliation and and and it has some
[2:04:40] other uh other words it means that
[2:04:43] everyone will be saved in the end and
[2:04:46] even the devil will repent and and uh
[2:04:48] you know brother Bram said well if he
[2:04:50] would and get baptized in Jesus Jesus
[2:04:51] name he wouldn't be the devil anymore
[2:04:53] he'd be your brother but that's not
[2:04:54] going to happen because he has sined and
[2:04:57] he's judged for it and his death is
[2:05:04] imminent somebody said imminent well we
[2:05:07] know it's not coming for after a
[2:05:08] thousand you you don't understand those
[2:05:11] thousand
[2:05:12] years that's well anyway not now he
[2:05:16] sinned and he's the originator of sin
[2:05:19] and his soul sin and he was a spirit
[2:05:22] that Spirit shall be totally annihilated
[2:05:25] to be nothing left of it and that's only
[2:05:28] how the spirit in Soul are connected if
[2:05:31] indeed in Lucifer they're connected that
[2:05:33] way then they both would cease to exist
[2:05:36] in your life as a Believer your
[2:05:38] regenerated Spirit your spirit that has
[2:05:41] been resurrected into the life of Jesus
[2:05:44] Christ that can never
[2:05:47] die that's what the word said let's go
[2:05:50] on please and I
[2:05:52] I believe a man that has eternal life
[2:05:54] can never die I believe in complete
[2:05:56] annihilation of the soul that sin now
[2:05:58] Satan must surely die to be completely
[2:06:00] destroyed and and his soul sin and he
[2:06:03] was Spirit I'd got to the end already
[2:06:06] that Spirit shall be totally annihilated
[2:06:08] there be nothing left of it now look at
[2:06:10] Ezekiel 28:12 with me just a moment this
[2:06:14] is scripture son of man take up a
[2:06:16] lamentation upon the king of Ty I read
[2:06:18] it all in the beginning now we break it
[2:06:20] down and say unto him thus sayeth the
[2:06:23] Lord God thou sealeste sum full of
[2:06:28] wisdom and perfect in Beauty now let's
[2:06:32] break that down just a moment the phrase
[2:06:36] thou seest up the sum means thou art a
[2:06:41] pattern of
[2:06:43] perfection in thine own conceit for a
[2:06:48] seal hath in it the perfect form of him
[2:06:53] that is thereby
[2:06:56] represented Sealth up the sum literally
[2:07:00] means Thou Art the one sealing the sum
[2:07:07] of perfection a sum is the answer in an
[2:07:13] equation where there are many things
[2:07:16] being added together let's say so we're
[2:07:20] adding and adding and adding adding and
[2:07:21] adding and then we come to the sum and
[2:07:24] the sum is the
[2:07:26] totality of each of those different
[2:07:30] digits that have come together to form
[2:07:32] so the sum is always
[2:07:35] greater than the individual digits right
[2:07:39] so that word translated to sum is
[2:07:41] telling us that Lucifer was the
[2:07:46] sum he was the Seal of the sum which
[2:07:50] means he was the
[2:07:52] completion of
[2:07:54] perfection in a created
[2:07:58] being that's important to know because
[2:08:01] brother vandom says in some ways he was
[2:08:05] co-equal with
[2:08:08] God and the
[2:08:10] critics are taking him to task all over
[2:08:14] the Internet for making such a statement
[2:08:17] he gets the statement from from the very
[2:08:19] meaning of this verse
[2:08:22] you are the Seal of the
[2:08:26] sum sealeste sum literally Thou Art the
[2:08:30] one sealing the sum of perfection a
[2:08:33] thing is sealed when
[2:08:35] completed the sum implies the full
[2:08:38] measure of Beauty from a Hebrew root to
[2:08:42] measure the scripture is saying you were
[2:08:46] the most beautiful
[2:08:49] thing you were the sum of all
[2:08:53] Beauty the sum of all
[2:08:57] intelligence think of this when God was
[2:09:01] creating he placed
[2:09:04] perfection in
[2:09:07] Lucifer I I don't know if there's
[2:09:09] anybody anywhere else other than around
[2:09:12] this message that even takes that verse
[2:09:15] as literal as brother brandham did but
[2:09:18] it's important to look at it that way
[2:09:22] thou art a finished
[2:09:24] pattern thou
[2:09:29] sealeste
[2:09:31] thine own
[2:09:33] likeness thou Forest a portrait of
[2:09:36] thyself and H has represented thyself
[2:09:40] the Perfection of wisdom and Beauty
[2:09:43] that's your
[2:09:46] enemy that's your
[2:09:48] enemy and even though he has now fallen
[2:09:52] from both Beauty and Perfection he's
[2:09:55] still drawing himself the same way God
[2:09:58] Drew him you you understand that he was
[2:10:03] once if you would have seen a picture of
[2:10:05] him you would have said
[2:10:09] oh that's the most beautiful thing I've
[2:10:11] ever
[2:10:13] seen but now he's fallen his Beauty has
[2:10:17] failed him his wisdom has failed him his
[2:10:21] Perfection has failed him and if you
[2:10:23] could see him in his reality In His
[2:10:26] Image now it would be the most
[2:10:29] hideous awful pitiful pathetic creature
[2:10:34] that you ever laid eyes on in your life
[2:10:36] but that's not how he draws
[2:10:38] himself he's still drawing himself you
[2:10:41] know when I when I read the real meaning
[2:10:44] of this verse I could just imagine the
[2:10:46] enemy you know the devil Lucifer uh
[2:10:48] hiring people to draw his part portrait
[2:10:52] he's hanging it in the in the anals of
[2:10:55] hell and yet it's not
[2:10:58] reality it's not what he looks like now
[2:11:01] if somebody would give him a mirror he'd
[2:11:04] know that he doesn't look like Beauty
[2:11:07] anymore he doesn't look like Perfection
[2:11:08] anymore he looks like all that is filthy
[2:11:11] all that is ungodly all that is Unholy
[2:11:15] and he wants to put that image on you
[2:11:18] and he wants to put that image on me but
[2:11:20] we refuse it don't we because we're
[2:11:23] wearing another another measure we're
[2:11:25] wearing another portrait we're wearing
[2:11:27] another image we've been changed by by
[2:11:30] the one we have looked
[2:11:32] upon we've looked upon real Perfection
[2:11:36] yes praise His
[2:11:39] name now in the
[2:11:42] message questions and
[2:11:45] answers one of the questions and answers
[2:11:49] 1959 look at what brother br says
[2:11:51] paragraph 85 he said now watch the evil
[2:11:55] controls of this world now as we read
[2:11:58] from Ezekiel 28:12 that's where we just
[2:12:01] read son of man I'm going to read it
[2:12:03] again in the quote son of man take up a
[2:12:06] lamentation under the king of Tyrus I
[2:12:09] may have it out of order but I thought
[2:12:10] it was right there with it Austin and
[2:12:13] say unto him thus sayith the Lord God
[2:12:16] now watch he's speaking to the spirit of
[2:12:19] the king he said see thus sayith the
[2:12:22] Lord God thou seest up the sun brother
[2:12:24] brandham quoting full of wisdom perfect
[2:12:27] in Beauty and then he says this Satan
[2:12:30] see there how Satan was the most
[2:12:33] beautiful of the
[2:12:37] archangels so he is acknowledging that
[2:12:40] Ezekiel
[2:12:41] 28:12 is describing Lucifer in his
[2:12:46] original creation as an archangel but
[2:12:49] the most beautiful of all the AR AR
[2:12:51] angels and the wisest of all the
[2:12:54] creatures that God had created now look
[2:12:57] at verse 13 Ezekiel 28 just jump over
[2:13:01] here now thou Hast been in
[2:13:05] Eden I'm going to wait on you to pull up
[2:13:07] Ezekiel 28:13 please thou Hast been in
[2:13:11] Eden the Garden of
[2:13:14] God every precious stone was thy
[2:13:19] covering so he is's wearing some sort of
[2:13:24] garment some some kind of outer
[2:13:28] something with precious stones on
[2:13:32] it maybe something like we imagine when
[2:13:35] we think about the breastplate of the
[2:13:38] high
[2:13:39] priest where these beautiful valuable
[2:13:43] stones were placed and in behind the urm
[2:13:47] and the Thim was there glor glorious
[2:13:52] beautiful Stones it seems that Lucifer
[2:13:54] was wearing some outer covering some
[2:13:58] garment that was made of all of these
[2:14:00] beautiful stones that we read to you
[2:14:04] already and
[2:14:06] gold and then he says the
[2:14:10] workmanship of thy say that word tabrets
[2:14:15] and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in
[2:14:21] the day that thou was created there's
[2:14:24] just no way to make that
[2:14:26] symbolic he was somehow made with a
[2:14:31] representation of both tabrets and
[2:14:34] pipes well we've got to know what that
[2:14:37] even
[2:14:38] means so we look at the
[2:14:41] Hebrew maaka is is workmanship
[2:14:45] maaka and it
[2:14:47] means occupation work business could be
[2:14:52] political could be religious it means
[2:14:55] someone having the
[2:14:58] ability to create something or to
[2:15:02] administer something then we look at the
[2:15:06] word
[2:15:07] tabrets which is the word that we get
[2:15:11] timberl tambourine from or pipes
[2:15:16] literally it means tabrets literally
[2:15:20] means
[2:15:21] holes in the musical pipes or
[2:15:26] flutes now if you've ever played a
[2:15:30] woodwind instrument you understand that
[2:15:34] there is a hole for for the re for the
[2:15:38] mouthpiece and there are holes that
[2:15:41] control the note and the tone and there
[2:15:46] is a hole that the sound comes out of so
[2:15:50] look looking at this you I I know this
[2:15:52] in itself may not be that interesting
[2:15:55] but please bear with me looking at that
[2:15:58] in in
[2:15:59] uh the original gives us this
[2:16:04] idea that in
[2:16:07] him there were
[2:16:09] pipes and there was even some sort of
[2:16:13] orifice some sort
[2:16:17] of
[2:16:18] hole that music
[2:16:24] sound float out
[2:16:27] of I want you to know all the other
[2:16:32] Angels they must have marveled they must
[2:16:35] say who is this dude I mean really you
[2:16:38] know he thinks he's something he
[2:16:40] was he was all the other Angels had to
[2:16:44] say holy holy
[2:16:46] holy but it sounds like I'm just telling
[2:16:48] you what the scripture I I don't I don't
[2:16:50] get it all totally I'm not trying to do
[2:16:52] it well brother BR didn't mention why do
[2:16:54] you well he quoted the
[2:16:59] scripture everybody else had to sing
[2:17:02] Holy Holy Holy every other angel had to
[2:17:05] play a harp or whatever else they played
[2:17:08] and yes it does mention that in
[2:17:10] scripture but but not
[2:17:16] Lucy somehow he was created to be an
[2:17:20] expression oh
[2:17:25] my had he remained pure perfect
[2:17:30] beautiful and
[2:17:31] wise just like God made him he would
[2:17:35] have been our
[2:17:38] example in how to glorify the Lord
[2:17:41] because the Bible tells us let
[2:17:43] everything that hath
[2:17:45] breath so everything that you are is
[2:17:48] involved in your worship come on
[2:17:51] that's why sometimes we move our hands
[2:17:53] and people think we've lost our mind I
[2:17:55] can't help
[2:17:56] it when the wind is blowing I'm blowing
[2:17:59] with it that's all I
[2:18:01] know somebody said well I see some of
[2:18:04] those people they're praising the Lord
[2:18:06] they look like they've got a tomahawk
[2:18:07] don't worry about
[2:18:09] it not cause we're Brave
[2:18:13] fans there's just something sometime you
[2:18:16] pick up you catch in a current of the
[2:18:20] spirit you would have to have a glimpse
[2:18:22] of Eternity eternity you'd have to have
[2:18:25] a glimpse of Throne Room worship to even
[2:18:28] be able to understand that even the
[2:18:31] movement of the Heavenly Host shifts and
[2:18:35] changes the atmosphere on planet Earth
[2:18:39] so every time you pray as it is in
[2:18:45] heaven so let it be in Earth you coming
[2:18:49] into agreement with the two worlds with
[2:18:52] the two Dimensions whatever is Heaven's
[2:18:55] mind let it be executed on the earth
[2:18:58] whatever is going on in the throne room
[2:19:00] of our God let us experience a a a piece
[2:19:05] of that when we
[2:19:09] worship may we not come like dead dried
[2:19:15] up
[2:19:18] Methodist who've had no birth Earth may
[2:19:22] we come into His presence like men and
[2:19:25] women and boys and girls who have been
[2:19:28] born
[2:19:30] out of something and born into something
[2:19:35] we've been born out of society we've
[2:19:37] been squeezed out of the system of the
[2:19:40] world we have been pushed out of the
[2:19:43] spirit of the age but we have caught a
[2:19:46] glimpse of who we really are we're
[2:19:49] Heaven's children yes sons of the most
[2:19:52] high God there is no God like unto our
[2:19:57] God there is no God like unto our God
[2:20:02] that David said among the
[2:20:04] gods meaning among the gods that are
[2:20:07] worshiped there's only one true Living
[2:20:09] God but don't tell me there's only one
[2:20:13] God because a God is what you
[2:20:16] make you know all that it takes to be a
[2:20:20] god is to be
[2:20:26] worshiped so football is a
[2:20:29] God to some anybody with me you'd think
[2:20:34] it was
[2:20:35] 3:00 we hadn't even got into Sunday
[2:20:37] night's message
[2:20:39] yet a a car there's nothing wrong with
[2:20:42] you driving a nice
[2:20:46] car I like to drive one new enough that
[2:20:49] I can take it back to to
[2:20:55] him I had one before this one only had
[2:20:59] it a couple years transmission went
[2:21:03] out it was a warranty issue they were
[2:21:06] going to put me a new transmission in
[2:21:09] but I was scheduled to preach in North
[2:21:11] Carolina the next
[2:21:15] day can I have a rental yes but it'll
[2:21:18] have to be a Ford
[2:21:20] well that's what I
[2:21:22] drive but they didn't have any Forge
[2:21:24] like I drive available they had one of
[2:21:27] them little cracker boxes I said oh no
[2:21:30] no no no I can't take my family to North
[2:21:31] Carolina and that my suitcase won't fit
[2:21:33] in the back seat much less my
[2:21:36] family so what will I
[2:21:39] do I reached out to my salesman and and
[2:21:42] he said I have a
[2:21:44] feeling that I can put you on top of
[2:21:47] this and save you money too I said let's
[2:21:51] try it and we did nothing wrong with
[2:21:53] driving a nice vehicle it's nice to be
[2:21:56] able to take it back and have it service
[2:21:58] when it needs to be
[2:22:00] serviced and traded when it needs to be
[2:22:02] traded but if that
[2:22:06] becomes your focus in
[2:22:09] life I've had the new one and I've had
[2:22:12] the jalape I know I
[2:22:16] know if that becomes your focus that
[2:22:18] becomes a god
[2:22:21] among all the gods that are worshiped
[2:22:25] there is no God among the gods like our
[2:22:31] God he
[2:22:33] deserves more than just a Hallelujah
[2:22:38] anyhow he deserves a purpose he deserves
[2:22:43] a an
[2:22:45] intentional
[2:22:47] praise oh I I like I see people doing
[2:22:51] this sometime in
[2:22:56] church you you you've got the hand up
[2:22:59] right you got part of the action right
[2:23:03] what's this going on down
[2:23:05] here you're checking your
[2:23:08] manicure looking where to chew
[2:23:11] next the problem with that is the like I
[2:23:15] said the the you know the position of
[2:23:17] the body is right something's missing
[2:23:20] it's not the fact you don't have to have
[2:23:22] both hands up all the time but whatever
[2:23:25] you're doing with this one it doesn't
[2:23:26] need to be anything that causes you to
[2:23:28] focus
[2:23:30] here instead of to the one you're
[2:23:34] worshiping so I don't believe in that
[2:23:36] kind of you know that praise and worship
[2:23:38] becomes so common to us that we don't
[2:23:40] pay much attention to what we're listen
[2:23:42] he he doesn't want that kind that's will
[2:23:45] worship he's not looking the scripture
[2:23:48] tells us Paul he's not looking for for
[2:23:50] will worship he's looking for sincere
[2:23:54] worship someone who will take a chunk of
[2:23:57] their own life pull aside and give God
[2:24:01] glory and honor and praise because he's
[2:24:05] wonderful and worthy so he makes this
[2:24:08] beautiful creature and all he has to do
[2:24:10] it looks like is just
[2:24:12] move and God is praised and it's amazing
[2:24:17] and he's beautiful and he's perfect
[2:24:19] until
[2:24:21] until he
[2:24:23] wasn't so something about this
[2:24:25] workmanship and these these tabrets
[2:24:29] and you know a tambourine has Little Sim
[2:24:32] little symbols or like little castets
[2:24:35] and I don't know what he sound I can't
[2:24:38] hardly imagine it but I don't think the
[2:24:40] scripture is just speaking uh
[2:24:42] metaphorically here the the Hebrew is
[2:24:47] too straight it's too
[2:24:50] base to be metaphor only in the message
[2:24:55] separation from unbelief brother brandom
[2:24:58] says in paragraph 25 but you take the
[2:25:00] people the whole of America oh my
[2:25:02] they're well fed and purred and they
[2:25:05] don't have to worry about anything they
[2:25:07] got all the money they want thousands
[2:25:09] and millions of dollars making yearly
[2:25:11] and Fine Cars big summer homes and
[2:25:14] places and everything they don't have to
[2:25:17] worry what's religion to them just just
[2:25:20] a place to sit around some place to say
[2:25:24] well I belong to the church I may not
[2:25:26] have given it charity I'm thinking now I
[2:25:27] didn't go back and put some of these
[2:25:29] over forgive
[2:25:31] me I have to make two sets of notes and
[2:25:34] I didn't copy this over I don't thing
[2:25:36] maybe he said they don't have to worry
[2:25:39] what's religion to them anyway just a
[2:25:40] place to sit around some place to say
[2:25:42] well I belong to the church and they'll
[2:25:44] find the highest and most practical
[2:25:46] Church they can go to and did you know
[2:25:49] that's the very sign of
[2:25:52] Satan let me say that again he said and
[2:25:55] did you know that's a very sign of Satan
[2:25:57] if you're Church shopping by what it
[2:25:59] looks like on the
[2:26:01] outside if you're Church shopping by how
[2:26:04] Seeker sensitive it
[2:26:06] is how all tolerant and welcoming it
[2:26:13] is he said Why That's
[2:26:15] Satan very sign of Satan he said I hope
[2:26:18] we don't get rough about it but remember
[2:26:21] in heaven this is paragraph 25 of
[2:26:24] separation from unbelief 1955 0228 if
[2:26:28] you happen to see
[2:26:30] it he goes over in the north he he said
[2:26:34] I hope we don't get rough but remember
[2:26:36] in heaven what made Lucifer jealous he
[2:26:39] goes over in the north and puts him up a
[2:26:40] better Kingdom he wanted a bigger
[2:26:42] Kingdom more brighter better
[2:26:44] prettier the devil he says the devil
[2:26:48] always works in
[2:26:50] say it again say it one more time please
[2:26:54] the devil always works in Beauty now I
[2:26:57] didn't bring the quotations this morning
[2:27:00] but let me just say there are several
[2:27:02] places where brother random said a woman
[2:27:04] wants to be beautiful and there's
[2:27:05] nothing wrong with that he
[2:27:10] said and what he means by that is if
[2:27:13] that becomes her drive if that becomes
[2:27:15] her Focus then he'll tell you right away
[2:27:18] that's pride and there's something wrong
[2:27:21] some people think uh uh something like
[2:27:23] brushing their teeth is
[2:27:29] pride that's called
[2:27:32] hygiene that's called not knocking
[2:27:34] people down when you greet them that's
[2:27:37] called not making people gag when they
[2:27:39] hug
[2:27:40] you it's not Pride to brush your teeth
[2:27:43] if you brush them 50 times a day well
[2:27:45] that's a little
[2:27:48] odd two or three should be all right
[2:27:51] right I know most of you
[2:27:53] don't once a day is good if that
[2:27:57] right we know now that it's not just
[2:28:00] about having pearly whites it's about
[2:28:03] heart
[2:28:04] health we now know that the the the
[2:28:07] health of our
[2:28:09] mouth directly not indirectly directly
[2:28:12] affects the the health of our
[2:28:15] heart plaque and buildup in the gum
[2:28:21] travels through the
[2:28:26] bloodstream the world is talking about
[2:28:29] microplastics microplastics aren't the
[2:28:32] only thing transported through the
[2:28:34] bloodstream even Dental plaque can
[2:28:38] be so it's a good idea to brush your
[2:28:40] teeth some people believe to put on a
[2:28:42] little my my my granny called it mum I
[2:28:45] don't know if they make mum anymore
[2:28:50] some years ago I stopped using antip
[2:28:52] pers Sprint that's why I sweat like a
[2:28:55] mule I use a natural deodorant and and
[2:28:58] when you use a natural deodorant you
[2:29:00] can't put it on once a
[2:29:03] week you have to put it on at least once
[2:29:06] a day and if you're working maybe more
[2:29:08] than once a day is it pride not to want
[2:29:11] to
[2:29:12] stink not
[2:29:16] necessarily some people don't understand
[2:29:19] if a woman want want to to buy a a a
[2:29:22] blouse that that matches her skirt
[2:29:26] that's not necessarily
[2:29:32] Pride if brother Brandon was if he was
[2:29:35] okay with sear sucker jacket and another
[2:29:38] color dungar that's up to
[2:29:41] him I rarely saw a picture of him
[2:29:46] looking like
[2:29:48] that he was making a
[2:29:51] point he wasn't encouraging us to look
[2:29:57] tacky we should take a little bit in
[2:30:00] fact that word pride is one of the words
[2:30:03] in the Bible that can actually be
[2:30:05] applied positively as well it's okay for
[2:30:08] you to to do a good
[2:30:11] job and be
[2:30:13] excited that you did a good
[2:30:16] job it's all right for me to say to you
[2:30:18] I'm proud of work that you've
[2:30:22] done but when we take such pride in how
[2:30:25] we look or what we do that we leave out
[2:30:28] the most important
[2:30:31] part or we become like those Daughters
[2:30:33] of Zion I'm going to I wish I could have
[2:30:35] put them in the not wish i' have got
[2:30:37] them in the notes for today I mean the
[2:30:39] whole but I want everybody here for that
[2:30:44] Sunday because those daughters over
[2:30:46] there in scripture you know uh that that
[2:30:51] spend all their time on their on their
[2:30:55] trinkets on their earbobs and their and
[2:30:59] their bracelets and their anklets and
[2:31:03] their rings on every finger like
[2:31:07] gypsies I see people around this message
[2:31:10] that would fit more in a gypsy Camp than
[2:31:12] they do in a Holiness
[2:31:18] Church I'm I know brother Brandon made
[2:31:20] that little statement you know he said
[2:31:22] your husband give you a
[2:31:24] little chain or something that there's a
[2:31:26] problem with that and the problem is if
[2:31:29] you start appealing to that part of your
[2:31:32] nature
[2:31:35] sister you'll look like they do in some
[2:31:37] of the big churches around this truth it
[2:31:40] won't be just that thin little chain
[2:31:41] that your husband gave you as just a
[2:31:43] little token of his love anymore it'll
[2:31:44] be them big old dim store bobles that
[2:31:47] people wear now
[2:31:50] I could put pictures up from Facebook
[2:31:52] but then I'd have to blot out the
[2:31:56] faces for the brandom described it as
[2:31:59] people looking like they went through a
[2:32:00] dime store with the magnet
[2:32:03] on
[2:32:04] hello set plastic don't stick to a
[2:32:07] magnet and that's what a lot of it is
[2:32:08] you know trying to Bobble themselves out
[2:32:12] so that everybody you know says oh my
[2:32:14] what an outfit that's where pride gets
[2:32:17] involved these women walked a certain
[2:32:19] way you know so that they could attract
[2:32:21] I'm going to try to do
[2:32:24] it I don't have the hips for
[2:32:27] it my belly's too big my hips too narrow
[2:32:30] I I couldn't swing like that I might
[2:32:32] throw something out of place and have to
[2:32:34] see the chiropractor you
[2:32:37] know they put on these big old high heel
[2:32:41] shoes but that didn't I I learned a long
[2:32:44] time ago when when there was a time
[2:32:46] around the part of the message that I
[2:32:48] was around where where all the sisters
[2:32:50] wore you know rather flat
[2:32:52] shoes and I noticed that uh among the
[2:32:55] young people I preached a lot of youth
[2:32:56] camps in those days and I noticed you
[2:32:58] don't have to have high heels to twist
[2:33:00] like that you you you can wear flats or
[2:33:03] Barefoot and twist like a like a hoola
[2:33:05] hoola hula
[2:33:07] hoop it it can be a spirit on you so
[2:33:10] there are some things that we want to
[2:33:12] look at uh when we are talking about
[2:33:15] Pride that are negative but but I just
[2:33:18] want you to understand that he said it's
[2:33:20] a it's in a woman's nature to want to to
[2:33:22] be beautiful and her focus should be to
[2:33:25] be beautiful for her
[2:33:28] husband not for somebody else's
[2:33:34] husband oh there's so much to be said
[2:33:36] here you know in churches where they're
[2:33:38] so
[2:33:39] loose about things like this there's so
[2:33:41] much divorce and
[2:33:45] remarriage have you ever noticed that in
[2:33:48] churches that are loose about these
[2:33:50] things there's so many cases of divorce
[2:33:52] and remarriage right in the
[2:33:55] church have you noticed how they're
[2:33:57] rewriting marriage and divorce to suit
[2:33:59] their
[2:34:02] lust it is
[2:34:05] true if if a woman is is twisting her
[2:34:08] hips for somebody else's companion no
[2:34:11] wonder no wonder no wonder they're
[2:34:14] sneaking out together and no wonder
[2:34:16] these things are happening but but let's
[2:34:18] put all this in perspective uh uh when
[2:34:20] we have an opportunity to do so he said
[2:34:24] the devil always works in Beauty sure he
[2:34:26] does that's the reason Cain offered what
[2:34:27] he did for his offering he said but
[2:34:30] there was no Beauty in Abel bringing a
[2:34:32] lamb but Abel had a spiritual Revelation
[2:34:35] from God I'm hurrying and that's what
[2:34:37] God would be pleased with and as we have
[2:34:39] said only through spiritual Revelation
[2:34:41] can you ever know God don't read that
[2:34:44] too fast let's slow that down he said
[2:34:47] and as we have said only through
[2:34:50] spiritual Revelation can you ever know
[2:34:55] God you'll never know him by reading a
[2:34:59] book you'll never know him just by
[2:35:01] hearing a tape you'll only know him when
[2:35:05] he
[2:35:07] quickens to you by
[2:35:10] Revelation what you're
[2:35:12] hearing it becomes a part of who you are
[2:35:16] it becomes a revelation and that's how
[2:35:18] you know him you don't know him by this
[2:35:20] kind of knowledge you know him by this
[2:35:23] kind of knowledge are you here look at
[2:35:26] Ezekiel 28:14 we're taking this verse by
[2:35:29] verse I'll be done in a minute or two or
[2:35:31] three or
[2:35:32] four verse 14 Thou Art the anointed
[2:35:35] cherub we read it that coverthe have set
[2:35:38] thee so thou was upon the holy mountain
[2:35:40] of God thou Hast walked up and down in
[2:35:43] the midst of the stones of fire that
[2:35:45] word cherub is the word that's used for
[2:35:48] Guardians of Eden
[2:35:50] they're not little babies in diapers
[2:35:53] with wings and harps floating around on
[2:35:56] your
[2:35:57] figurines The cherubs of the Bible are
[2:36:00] Mighty Guardians of the
[2:36:07] glory they don't look like little toilet
[2:36:10] paper
[2:36:15] advertisers rosy cheeks and
[2:36:20] fluffy bottoms and floating on
[2:36:25] clouds people collect those little impy
[2:36:28] looking things if you ever saw real
[2:36:31] cherub beim I promise you you wouldn't
[2:36:34] say
[2:36:35] oh
[2:36:37] oh it would strike Terror in your heart
[2:36:41] you'd say my God look at a warrior a
[2:36:44] guardian of the
[2:36:46] glory I want to be on his good side
[2:36:50] see and Lucifer was considered one of
[2:36:54] those like an
[2:36:57] archangel Guardians Of Eden flanking
[2:37:00] God's Throne as and as an image from
[2:37:03] hovering over the Ark of the Covenant
[2:37:05] remember their wing tips touched as they
[2:37:08] were uh Graven there molded there on the
[2:37:12] mercy seat that was the lid of the Ark
[2:37:15] of the Covenant and then we look at that
[2:37:17] word cover it Thou Art the anointed ch
[2:37:19] that cover it and that means to hedge to
[2:37:22] fence in to shut in to block the screen
[2:37:25] to stop the approach to shut off to
[2:37:29] protect you were the anointed cherub
[2:37:31] that
[2:37:35] coverthe one who guarded the throne and
[2:37:39] one who was there to protect to block to
[2:37:45] shut off he had responsibility didn't he
[2:37:49] yeah and yet he flaunted his beauty
[2:37:53] boasted of his wisdom
[2:37:57] until iniquity was found in his heart
[2:38:00] look at 28:15 thou was
[2:38:05] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[2:38:08] thou was created till iniquity was found
[2:38:11] you say that perfect must not mean
[2:38:13] perfect it does look at it it's tomim it
[2:38:16] means complete whole entire s
[2:38:19] wholesome unimpaired innocent having
[2:38:22] Integrity what is complete entirely in
[2:38:25] accord with truth and fact that's what
[2:38:27] it
[2:38:27] means you are perfect Lucifer you are
[2:38:31] perfect
[2:38:33] whole completely in accord with God's
[2:38:38] truth and
[2:38:40] fact in in the message I got to move in
[2:38:43] the message the Seal of the Antichrist
[2:38:46] paragraph 17 and we'll nearly be through
[2:38:48] here
[2:38:52] my family was gone so I spent extra
[2:38:57] time if you'll notice I mean study and
[2:39:00] and now my my Fork is full and I and my
[2:39:04] time is gone if you'll notice just about
[2:39:07] the same time about the time that Jesus
[2:39:09] came on the scene Judas came on the
[2:39:11] scene the Antichrist the one was against
[2:39:13] Christ look at what he says Judas is one
[2:39:16] of the disciples here the prophet calls
[2:39:18] him an antichrist
[2:39:21] he said I want you to notice the nature
[2:39:23] of these Spirits now Judas was a
[2:39:24] religious man he was not an Infidel and
[2:39:27] all of us know that he was
[2:39:29] Antichrist now he's talking about an
[2:39:31] antitype of the
[2:39:33] Antichrist there is yet an antichrist to
[2:39:36] come but remember the scripture tells us
[2:39:39] the mystery of iniquity doth already
[2:39:41] work and so Judas was forerunning the
[2:39:44] one who would come we understand
[2:39:47] forerunners don't we he said uh if
[2:39:51] you'll
[2:39:52] notice he was not an Infidel all of us
[2:39:55] know that he was Antichrist he worked
[2:39:57] the very closest hand to Christ here
[2:40:00] brother brandham is calling Lucifer the
[2:40:03] right-hand
[2:40:05] man he's referring to Judas the
[2:40:09] right-hand man did you know that in
[2:40:11] heaven the devil was God's right-hand
[2:40:13] man in the beginning that Lucifer the
[2:40:15] son of the morning was given power and
[2:40:17] the reason that he brought sin into the
[2:40:18] world he was was able to take something
[2:40:20] listen he was able to take something
[2:40:22] that God had created and pervert it back
[2:40:26] into an evil thing which started all
[2:40:30] this
[2:40:32] trouble I thought women started it
[2:40:37] all isn't that what they like to preach
[2:40:39] around the message don't they like to
[2:40:42] pick those little quotes and blame the
[2:40:44] women for every problem in the world
[2:40:55] but brother Ram said it started before
[2:40:56] that oh yeah he said that he said those
[2:40:59] things he said some things about
[2:41:02] women he wasn't talking about my
[2:41:05] wife he might have been talking about
[2:41:08] somebody's wife he wasn't talking about
[2:41:09] my wife my wife is a Blood Bought
[2:41:12] believer Sanctified by the washing of
[2:41:14] the water of the word and filled with
[2:41:16] the Holy Ghost I'm sure brother Brandon
[2:41:18] wasn't talking about her when he said
[2:41:19] those things about a woman being lower
[2:41:21] down than a
[2:41:26] dog he could have only been talking
[2:41:29] about a fallen woman and we were all
[2:41:31] fallen and rotten and low down like dogs
[2:41:33] until we found Christ but there should
[2:41:36] be no sister in this house that feels
[2:41:40] like that is her or that he was
[2:41:42] describing you you are a prized listen
[2:41:47] when these things begin to come out
[2:41:50] and uh if you take these things out of
[2:41:52] context put them all in one document
[2:41:55] it's hurtful things I I've read them and
[2:41:58] even though the prophet said them they
[2:41:59] hurt hurt my own feelings reading them
[2:42:02] out of context will do
[2:42:05] that and when these things first started
[2:42:07] coming out and articles were being
[2:42:09] spread and so forth I sat at my dinner
[2:42:12] table on a Friday night weeping and I
[2:42:14] apologize to my daughters and to my wife
[2:42:18] for having to hear hear these
[2:42:20] things and in any way applying them to
[2:42:24] themselves because a sister in Christ is
[2:42:28] none of
[2:42:29] that and you are so far removed from
[2:42:32] that nature that that should never even
[2:42:35] cross your mind and if you're hearing a
[2:42:37] tape and that you hear that you should
[2:42:40] just let that go as though he was
[2:42:42] talking about somebody else because he
[2:42:45] is don't ever live under that kind of a
[2:42:48] burden that's
[2:42:51] right it is right and it should have
[2:42:54] been said a long long time ago in our
[2:43:04] churches he took that and that devil and
[2:43:08] he corrupted and perverted it back to an
[2:43:11] evil thing which started all this
[2:43:14] trouble in the
[2:43:17] beginning then God back before the
[2:43:20] foundation of the world was ever laid
[2:43:21] when he seen what Satan done in his
[2:43:24] pride went over in the north and set up
[2:43:25] a kingdom and fought against Michael and
[2:43:27] his angels remember the Great War that
[2:43:29] happened in eternity he said the
[2:43:32] right-and man of almighty God was
[2:43:34] Lucifer the son of the morning the first
[2:43:37] God granted him almost co-workers with
[2:43:40] him he was a coworker partly equal with
[2:43:44] him only Satan could not you you need to
[2:43:49] remember that he never was a Creator he
[2:43:52] will never be a Creator all he can do is
[2:43:54] pervert what God created that's all he
[2:43:57] can do he can't create he's not all
[2:44:00] knowing he's not all powerful come
[2:44:06] on God is the only Creator but Satan
[2:44:09] took something that God created and
[2:44:10] perverted it back into something else he
[2:44:12] said notice when Cain and Abel very
[2:44:14] beautiful picture Cain and Abel was
[2:44:16] nothing more than a prefigure of Judas
[2:44:18] and Jesus now being uneducated like my
[2:44:20] brethren are educated he said I teach
[2:44:22] the scriptures from types and shadows
[2:44:24] and if I know what the shadow of
[2:44:26] anything is I'll have some understanding
[2:44:27] of it if I see what the shadow looks
[2:44:29] like I can pretty well tell what it's
[2:44:31] going to look like that's pretty good
[2:44:33] that's pretty good interpretation pretty
[2:44:35] good I like that a
[2:44:37] lot it's it's not a it's not an ignorant
[2:44:41] statement don't be fooled by somebody's
[2:44:45] lack of of Education because educated
[2:44:47] fools have made a hideous mess of God's
[2:44:51] word but a little Kentucky
[2:44:58] hillbilly if we could foresee by the
[2:45:01] shadow what these Evils are then we can
[2:45:04] pretty well tell what they're going to
[2:45:06] be when we look at them and without
[2:45:07] education then I have to teach it from
[2:45:09] typology Paul did a lot of that too did
[2:45:11] you know it in the book of Hebrews he
[2:45:13] absolutely did let's catch one more
[2:45:15] verse verse 12 how art thou fallen from
[2:45:18] heaven musicians are coming how art thou
[2:45:21] fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer so if you
[2:45:26] thought in any way that this was talking
[2:45:28] about an Earthly King before please
[2:45:32] understand that it was much more than
[2:45:34] that how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[2:45:37] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[2:45:40] cut down to the ground which didst
[2:45:44] weaken the
[2:45:46] Nations I want you to look at the name
[2:45:48] Lucifer
[2:45:50] Lucifer is Hal it means
[2:45:54] lightbearer shining one morning
[2:45:58] star Lucifer Means Day
[2:46:01] star halil is from
[2:46:04] Halal which is
[2:46:07] halelu
[2:46:10] yah light unto God shine unto God if we
[2:46:14] would added the yah to his name he would
[2:46:19] have been God you would have been
[2:46:21] describing God calling him Lucifer but
[2:46:24] describing God bright One Shining one
[2:46:29] day star that was the meaning of his
[2:46:31] name in questions and answers final
[2:46:34] quotation for
[2:46:35] today paragraph 69 see Satan was the
[2:46:39] original Archangel of God he once dwelt
[2:46:41] in the heaven he once was the greatest
[2:46:43] person in the heavens outside of God he
[2:46:46] was God's right-hand man to Fellowship
[2:46:49] and he got puffed up in his
[2:46:54] heart now here's probably what
[2:46:56] happened he saw the
[2:47:00] look on some Angel's
[2:47:02] face when he
[2:47:04] was doing his
[2:47:09] doings he saw somebody looking at
[2:47:13] him and then he liked to
[2:47:17] perform hello
[2:47:20] so then he started doing what he was
[2:47:22] doing with mindfulness that he was being
[2:47:27] watched that's not what worship
[2:47:30] is when you start looking around to see
[2:47:32] who's watching you you might as well sit
[2:47:36] down this ain't no dance hall this is
[2:47:40] God's
[2:47:42] house you don't need to see who's
[2:47:44] watching you you better hope nobody's
[2:47:46] watching you because if they are you're
[2:47:48] a distraction
[2:47:49] ction hello it's just real isn't it but
[2:47:54] but somehow he he caught some some
[2:47:56] Angel's eye you know some some other
[2:47:59] created being is seeing him and boy then
[2:48:01] it got real serious then he really got
[2:48:07] dramatic fixing himself you
[2:48:10] know and then no doubt the Angels began
[2:48:13] to notice that he was getting too puffed
[2:48:15] up in his in his demonstration
[2:48:18] and they began to look
[2:48:24] away he was not the center of attention
[2:48:27] anymore and it hurt his little old
[2:48:32] feelings he was lifted up in his own
[2:48:36] pride and offense became a
[2:48:40] partner no doubt about it and he began
[2:48:43] to pervert what God had given him
[2:48:49] twisting it and making it some
[2:48:52] performance something that it was never
[2:48:53] to be God wanted him to be who he
[2:48:56] created him to
[2:48:58] be but he didn't want him to become a
[2:49:01] distraction to
[2:49:06] others God's right-hand
[2:49:08] man he got puffed up in his heart isn't
[2:49:11] that the way people get today let God
[2:49:13] just bless a fellow listen
[2:49:16] carefully put a little confidence in him
[2:49:19] and he gets to be a know--it
[2:49:22] all it's like some of these TSA
[2:49:31] agents some of them were Uber
[2:49:34] drivers last
[2:49:36] month and now they think they are FBI
[2:49:41] agents got a little badge in a name tag
[2:49:44] gone to their
[2:49:47] head always Cho a man when you're going
[2:49:49] through a
[2:49:54] line I
[2:49:57] do older the
[2:50:00] better look at him if he never Smiles
[2:50:02] get out of his
[2:50:05] line they get a little
[2:50:07] authority sometime and they really think
[2:50:10] that they are Secret Service agents
[2:50:13] protecting the life of the
[2:50:16] president party talk to people like
[2:50:19] they're just
[2:50:21] idiots huffed up that's how the enemy
[2:50:24] that they're just following along the
[2:50:26] line this is what happened to the enemy
[2:50:28] he wasn't always proud he was created to
[2:50:32] give praise to something else to someone
[2:50:34] else but but he got to thinking mama I
[2:50:37] wonder what it'd look like if I was
[2:50:38] sitting up
[2:50:41] there and because Angels had a choice
[2:50:44] too he began to persuade to dissuade and
[2:50:47] persuade
[2:50:50] let God just bless a fellow and put a
[2:50:51] little confidence in him he gets to be
[2:50:52] Anno all he he he got he's got to start
[2:50:55] an
[2:50:58] organization he's got to start an
[2:51:01] organization or he's got to do something
[2:51:03] that's different why art thou fallen
[2:51:05] from Heaven oh Lucifer God has a hard
[2:51:08] time trying to get somebody that he can
[2:51:09] deal
[2:51:11] with that'll stay humble and meek and
[2:51:13] stay in the place until God calls him to
[2:51:15] do something you believe that
[2:51:18] my granny knew it she wasn't a Believer
[2:51:21] for too long but message believer for
[2:51:22] too long but she knew it she said some
[2:51:24] are called and some are sent and some
[2:51:26] just got up and
[2:51:27] went that's
[2:51:29] it stay in the place until God calls him
[2:51:32] to do something you believe that see a
[2:51:34] man that God can bless and he'll still
[2:51:36] keep himself a man not be an angel or a
[2:51:41] God as soon as a man gets blessed and
[2:51:43] has a little something given to him he
[2:51:45] wants to become a God he wants to become
[2:51:46] an angel he wants to become some great
[2:51:48] person list what I do what me and me and
[2:51:51] mine and all that come on he said that's
[2:51:54] the wrong attitude God's hunting for
[2:51:56] somebody who he could bless and pour out
[2:51:59] the blessings and the more he blessed
[2:52:02] the little the man would
[2:52:07] become he said you'll never get more of
[2:52:10] God until you
[2:52:13] become nothing you've got to belittle
[2:52:17] yourself
[2:52:20] that doesn't mean be overly critical of
[2:52:22] yourself it means humble
[2:52:26] yourself God will bring a base he that
[2:52:29] will humble himself God will exalt
[2:52:31] you've got to get little before you can
[2:52:33] get big ain't that good and you'll never
[2:52:36] be big in your own self you'll only be
[2:52:39] as big as God will be
[2:52:41] big let's read that again you'll never
[2:52:44] be big in your own self you'll only be
[2:52:46] as big as God will be big in you woo
[2:52:49] that's good see he said so Lucifer watch
[2:52:53] this so Lucifer is on Earth today trying
[2:52:56] to
[2:52:58] work is everybody looking at the screen
[2:53:01] Lucifer is on the Earth today trying to
[2:53:03] work in the church to do what to
[2:53:05] accomplish the same purpose that he
[2:53:07] started before the foundation of the
[2:53:09] world Lucifer
[2:53:14] was there's some around this truth that
[2:53:16] preach that he's not been kicked out
[2:53:25] yet they get that from from looking at
[2:53:29] at
[2:53:33] job and so there are people who believe
[2:53:36] that Lucifer can just you know uh strut
[2:53:39] in to the throne room anytime he so
[2:53:42] desires I want you to know that's not
[2:53:45] the
[2:53:45] truth if he ever is there it's because
[2:53:48] he was invited there or allowed there
[2:53:52] the Bible says there was a time that he
[2:53:55] was in the heavens
[2:53:57] only but now he is loosed on Earth he's
[2:54:02] no longer accusing you before the throne
[2:54:05] he once was there to accuse you before
[2:54:08] the throne to accuse job before the
[2:54:10] throne but the scripture said now he's
[2:54:11] loosed on Earth and what is he
[2:54:14] doing he's accusing brother to brother
[2:54:18] sister to sister church member to church
[2:54:22] member he doesn't have to do it from
[2:54:24] there anymore he does it from
[2:54:30] here offending and hurting feelings and
[2:54:33] making envy and jealousy destroy
[2:54:37] churches and marriages and relationships
[2:54:40] he's busy in the believer's
[2:54:45] business but I want to remind him you
[2:54:48] are kicked
[2:54:50] out your day is almost
[2:54:54] over it's up to you and I
[2:54:57] to make sure that we're not swallowing
[2:55:01] his lie we're not buying his swamp
[2:55:05] land it's up to you and I to make sure
[2:55:08] that we don't ever take on the
[2:55:11] characteristic of of Pride especially if
[2:55:14] it becomes a driving force in our
[2:55:17] life look nice and be clean and and do
[2:55:21] the best in life that you can but know
[2:55:24] this anything you have was a gift from
[2:55:29] the Father of
[2:55:33] Lights I worked hard for it you did
[2:55:36] because he gave you the strength to do
[2:55:38] it and the knowledge to be able to do it
[2:55:40] not because you just came here uh so
[2:55:43] amazing
[2:55:44] amen that's true for all of us if you
[2:55:48] are offended and you're nursing hurt and
[2:55:52] wounds that you've received in the
[2:55:54] household of your friends your brothers
[2:55:56] and sisters in Christ make sure that you
[2:55:59] immediately seek healing from the Lord
[2:56:01] he has a bomb of Gilead he has a healing
[2:56:04] portion and he wants to pour that don't
[2:56:07] don't let anger become a part of who you
[2:56:09] are uh there is a word pride in the
[2:56:12] Bible that we'll get to perhaps Tuesday
[2:56:14] night there's a word uh that's
[2:56:16] translated Pride that's just like a word
[2:56:19] that's translated anger it gives the
[2:56:21] sense of that bubbling up remember the
[2:56:23] foaming
[2:56:26] up there is a there is a pride that
[2:56:29] likes to foam Up Bubble Up in
[2:56:32] us and we have the responsibility to
[2:56:36] make sure that we keep pulling oursel
[2:56:40] back and uh I I
[2:56:44] don't I don't mean to be critical not at
[2:56:47] all but I don't perhaps like the
[2:56:49] language of of saying you need to
[2:56:51] belittle
[2:56:52] yourself I I I feel
[2:56:55] sure that he is telling us to Humble
[2:56:58] ourselves to make ourselves small I I
[2:57:01] think the word belittle in in in our
[2:57:05] society means
[2:57:07] demeaning to demean yourself if you do
[2:57:10] that brother sister if you keep
[2:57:12] disqualifying yourself and and and and
[2:57:15] taking yourself out of the promise
[2:57:17] you'll never get the victory over these
[2:57:19] things I I want you to know that he's
[2:57:21] already seen you in your
[2:57:24] worst before you showed
[2:57:27] up nothing you've
[2:57:30] done has surprised him he knew that I
[2:57:34] was rotten in my flesh before I ever was
[2:57:37] born in the earth and he saw me in my
[2:57:40] weakness in my
[2:57:42] rotness in my struggle with pride in my
[2:57:46] struggle with hurt in my struggle with
[2:57:48] anger and he loved me
[2:57:50] anyway and he has no intention of
[2:57:52] leaving me there he saw me in my
[2:57:55] fullness in my completion in my
[2:57:58] overcoming he saw that he saw that about
[2:58:01] you and he's determined he's
[2:58:04] committed stand would you stand with me
[2:58:06] he's
[2:58:09] committed he's committed to your success
[2:58:13] he's
[2:58:15] committed to you overcoming
[2:58:18] if you lean on
[2:58:23] him how many of you have served the Lord
[2:58:25] over over 30 years let me see your
[2:58:30] hand how many of you have served the
[2:58:32] Lord over 50 years let me see your hand

[2:59:00] lean can you imagine 50 years of serving
[2:59:02] the lord and you're still learning to

[2:59:10] I've learned something I hope I have I
[2:59:12] hope I have learned something in 50
[2:59:14] years but what I've learned is not

[3:04:01] lean I'd like to get it
[3:04:04] right I'd like to pass the
[3:04:07] test but sometimes in
[3:04:10] the split of a moment
[3:04:13] I try to figure it out myself or I try
[3:04:17] to do it on my
[3:04:19] own instead of
[3:04:22] waiting even though we know that you
[3:04:25] promis if we would wait on you our
[3:04:28] strength would be renewed like the
[3:04:30] eagles sometimes we just jump in it's
[3:04:34] some of our nature some of our
[3:04:36] personality to just jump in and get her
[3:04:39] done like the world says but it's
[3:04:43] always a painful
[3:04:46] reality when what we try to do just
[3:04:48] flops and
[3:04:50] fails would you remind us holy spirit of
[3:04:53] God would you remind us press Us in the
[3:04:58] moment to get out of your
[3:05:01] way Lord on occasion I have thought
[3:05:05] about what could have been if I would
[3:05:09] have been more yielded and would have
[3:05:11] waited
[3:05:12] more on you instead of trying to take
[3:05:15] the bull by the horns today Lord we
[3:05:17] stand in the house that we meet you in
[3:05:21] so often but we're so grateful that you
[3:05:23] live in us we don't have to leave you
[3:05:26] here when we go home would you come to
[3:05:29] us today
[3:05:31] Lord give us a peace that passes all
[3:05:34] understanding
[3:05:35] and would you let that buzzer go off
[3:05:40] when we start to do
[3:05:42] it we answer too
[3:05:44] quickly or we start to feel a little
[3:05:48] little proud of how we've handled
[3:05:52] it remind us to wait on you
[3:05:56] Lord oh I've seen what can happen when
[3:05:59] we
[3:06:00] yield when we lay down our
[3:06:04] lives we thank you for another
[3:06:06] opportunity to worship you now before we
[3:06:08] go and we ask that your peace would just

[3:12:59] so today we stand here without any doubt

[3:13:06] reasoning we know you're able we know
[3:13:08] you are more than able yes because you
[3:13:12] conquered we are more than conquerors so
[3:13:15] we pull right now in in faith upon your
[3:13:24] inexhaustible we pull upon your
[3:13:26] inexhaustible
[3:13:30] Supply don't come to us Lord because
[3:13:33] we're good or because we've done
[3:13:35] anything come to us Lord because we
[3:13:38] recognize we're nothing and it's not us
[3:13:42] that pulls it's our faith and we
[3:13:44] recognize that even that we didn't do
[3:13:46] ourselves
[3:13:47] you you gave us that kind of
[3:13:50] Faith you gave us the kind of faith that
[3:13:53] pulls you in our Direction that's
[3:13:56] right like our Master said I must needs
[3:14:00] go through
[3:14:03] Samaria somebody needs me in
[3:14:06] Samaria Lord somebody needs you today in
[3:14:10] Smith
[3:14:12] Station instead of asking you to pass by
[3:14:16] we're thanking you right now that you've
[3:14:18] been with us thank you for being with us
[3:14:21] thank you for standing with us in this
[3:14:24] hour and we agree with the faith of
[3:14:27] every person who raised their hand a
[3:14:29] moment ago that whatever the need is
[3:14:32] physical emotional spiritual if it's
[3:14:37] Financial if it's for advice and wisdom
[3:14:40] and counil it's all in you Lord and
[3:14:44] right now we agree with their faith
[3:14:48] ah that something will
[3:14:50] awaken on the inside of the inside of
[3:14:53] the
[3:14:54] inside that would cause us to start
[3:14:57] possessing what we confess it's that
[3:14:59] easy it's that easy to take it to accept
[3:15:02] it to believe it Lord I believe right
[3:15:05] now there's so many good things
[3:15:07] happening among us some of which we
[3:15:09] can't even tell just yet but we praise
[3:15:11] you for them anyhow we praise you Lord
[3:15:15] even though they can't be testified
[3:15:17] about just yet we praise you for them we
[3:15:19] know you're a good God we know know Lord
[3:15:22] that you've got good intentions towards
[3:15:25] your little children and we want to
[3:15:27] thank you for it we want to thank you
[3:15:30] for it uh you don't have to unless you
[3:15:32] feel to but I'd like to invite somebody
[3:15:34] just to put your hand right right here
[3:15:37] on your own
[3:15:39] body because I had this sense that
[3:15:42] something needed to awaken and this is
[3:15:45] what the scripture said spring up o well
[3:15:48] therefore with joy shall you draw Waters
[3:15:51] out of the wells of Salvation and then
[3:15:54] Jesus came along and he said out of
[3:15:56] men's
[3:15:59] bellies he didn't mean your stomach he
[3:16:02] meant your spiritual belly your
[3:16:04] spiritual womb he said out of men's
[3:16:06] bellies shall flow what not not not
[3:16:10] little trickles rivers of Living Water
[3:16:14] sometimes it gets stagnant sometimes the
[3:16:16] water gets damned up if you feel like
[3:16:19] you need a uh something to wake up and
[3:16:21] be loosed in you just put your hand
[3:16:24] right there that's what I felt so I just
[3:16:26] let it come out Lord in the name of
[3:16:29] Jesus somebody there's some maybe
[3:16:31] somebody here wouldn't know what to do
[3:16:32] with it if it did but that don't matter
[3:16:35] what matters is that you are a god of
[3:16:37] Resurrection
[3:16:39] Life and and the reality is Elizabeth
[3:16:42] thought her little baby was dead she
[3:16:45] wasn't even sure he was still
[3:16:47] alive but when when when she came into
[3:16:51] the presence of the one who is carrying
[3:16:54] our Lord the Holy Ghost fell on her and
[3:16:58] Resurrection Life was in her womb and
[3:17:01] John the Baptist
[3:17:05] leapt something in her woke up and
[3:17:10] quickened and she received the Holy
[3:17:12] Ghost Lord right now whatever it is
[3:17:15] whatever promise whatever
[3:17:19] promise that has died in US
[3:17:22] somehow whatever flow has been damned up
[3:17:25] whatever River has been stopped up in US
[3:17:28] Lord we believe that we're coming into a
[3:17:31] season of
[3:17:33] movement into a season of of
[3:17:36] fluid that flows something flowing not
[3:17:40] something damned up so we speak
[3:17:43] life over our own inner being right now
[3:17:46] now that Rivers will come spring
[3:17:51] up spring up oh
[3:17:54] well with joy we're drawing
[3:17:58] water living water from the wells of
[3:18:02] Yeshua from the wells of
[3:18:04] Salvation we rebuke the Devourer I take
[3:18:08] authority over the enemy that wants you
[3:18:10] to give up somebody there's an enemy
[3:18:13] that wants you to give up on what you
[3:18:15] have carried in the past don't dare do
[3:18:18] it don't dare give up on that hold on
[3:18:22] right now may New Life new
[3:18:25] encouragement fresh Joy fresh hope let
[3:18:31] it rise up in you now in the name of
[3:18:35] Jesus healing your
[3:18:37] body comforting your
[3:18:40] heart speaking peace to the storm of
[3:18:42] your mind
[3:18:47] than
[3:18:49] you there are times that waiting means
[3:18:52] nothing doing nothing standing and doing
[3:18:54] nothing but there are times that waiting
[3:18:57] means serving in
[3:19:00] scripture when Peter's mother-in-law is
[3:19:02] that right am I right had a fever yes
[3:19:06] Peter's mother-in-law had a fever and
[3:19:08] the Lord came to capernium where she
[3:19:10] where she
[3:19:11] lived archaeologists have they believe
[3:19:14] they've discovered the house of of
[3:19:16] Peter's family in capernium we've been
[3:19:20] there many times when Jesus came to
[3:19:22] Capernaum and uh walked in and and
[3:19:25] prayed the prayer the Bible said she
[3:19:27] arose and she began to wait on
[3:19:30] them now if the only concept of waiting
[3:19:33] you have is doing nothing that's what
[3:19:35] she was doing when she was sick doing
[3:19:37] nothing she wasn't able but when
[3:19:39] strength came to her she got up and
[3:19:41] started serving her company see what I
[3:19:43] mean SO waiting can be just doing
[3:19:46] nothing just Standing on the Promises of
[3:19:47] God but sometimes waiting on the Lord
[3:19:50] the kind that renews your strength and
[3:19:52] gives you your wings back is when you
[3:19:55] just start doing little things that you
[3:19:57] know to
[3:20:00] do and that would be to read the word to
[3:20:05] pray to hear the
[3:20:07] tape to
[3:20:09] worship Worship in the shower Worship in
[3:20:13] the
[3:20:13] pantry Worship in the yard Worship in
[3:20:16] the
[3:20:17] car give him
[3:20:19] praise stay as connected to him as often
[3:20:23] and as tight as you possibly
[3:20:26] can those who abide in the vine those
[3:20:29] are the ones who are going to find
[3:20:31] strength to heal from their hurts and to
[3:20:35] overcome anger and pride I'm going to I
[3:20:38] have to it's life or death for me is it
[3:20:41] life or death for you it's life or death
[3:20:44] father one more time as we come to a a
[3:20:46] close the these
[3:20:51] needs they
[3:20:53] matter we carry them we're going to

[3:21:17] never told anybody he knows it yes he
[3:21:19] does and he has no stone to throw he
