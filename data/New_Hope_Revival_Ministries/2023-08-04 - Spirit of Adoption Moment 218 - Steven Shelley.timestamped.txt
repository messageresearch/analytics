[0:02] foreign
[0:08] a Son of God I have not received the
[0:12] spirit of bondage again to fear but I
[0:14] have received the spirit of adoption now
[0:18] don't misunderstand this doesn't mean
[0:20] that he has brought someone in who
[0:22] didn't belong to him this is our concept
[0:25] of adoption
[0:27] our concept of adoption is when we bring
[0:29] someone into our family who is not blood
[0:32] of our blood flesh of our flesh born of
[0:34] our bone and we make them
[0:38] ours so the adoption that we're talking
[0:41] about here is not an adoption like
[0:43] America or like Europe but it is the
[0:46] adoption from the middle or Far East and
[0:49] that is where even a son
[0:54] even a blood full bona fide son
[1:00] could not carry the authority of his
[1:04] father
[1:05] until he had sat under tutors and been
[1:10] trained and taught and finally the tutor
[1:14] would say Hey you have reached the place
[1:18] where you can receive the full authority
[1:22] of the father's adoption
[1:25] and we understand that they were brought
[1:28] to the gate of the city and friends and
[1:31] neighbors were called and a proclamation
[1:34] was made and usually read by a father or
[1:38] a a one who was appointed
[1:41] sometimes the tutor and before the whole
[1:45] group of people that were gathered there
[1:47] the announcement was made this is my
[1:51] beloved Son
[1:56] in whom I am well pleased
[2:00] hear ye him
[2:04] the exact language that was you hello
[2:08] the exact language that was used at the
[2:11] baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17] the same adoption
[2:20] fully adopted
[2:23] bringing you into a relationship with
[2:27] God
[2:28] where you no longer have to approach him
[2:31] who most holy
[2:35] Reverend
[2:37] hallowed father God Supreme
[2:43] no
[2:45] that's not the believer
[2:47] the believer says Papa
[2:54] we always approach God in reverential
[2:56] fear but we do not of human the kind of
[2:59] fear that brings us into bondage
[3:05] bondage too many people around the
[3:09] message are under a spirit of bondage
[3:12] and they're afraid to step out
[3:16] to be led by the spirit to encounter the
[3:20] reality of a living God causes them
[3:24] anxiety the very thing that God has said
[3:27] to Deliver Us from anxiety
[3:30] causes them anxiety come on
[3:35] when life overwhelms you this week and
[3:39] you don't know what to do next
[3:41] don't melt down
[3:44] don't take another pill
[3:47] say papa
[3:53] oh
[3:56] this scripture is telling us the spirit
[3:59] of adoption brings you into a unique
[4:02] fellowship and relationship with your
[4:06] God
[4:07] that should cause you not to move in the
[4:10] bondage of fear but cause you to move in
[4:12] the liberty of the spirit that has come
[4:15] to set you free if you know what I'm
[4:18] preaching this morning say something
[4:21] laughs
