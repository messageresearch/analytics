TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] one of my very favorite scriptures in the Bible is Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever it reminds us that everything that our Lord Jesus was able to accomplish in his earthly ministry he can still perform for us and even through us today when we look at the four Gospels and we read the beautiful words of truth the the unbelievable expressions of love the great miracles that took place in the very short period of his earthly ministry the Bible tells us that the world could not contain the volumes the books that could have been written about his earthly ministry when we look at that there's so much that can help us even in our lives today one of those places in Scripture that has inspired me recently is in mark chapter 5 where there are two outstanding miracles recorded in the Ministry of Jesus Christ one is we read of one whose name was gyrus he was a leader a ruler in the synagogue he had great religious position and even Authority he came to Jesus to tell him that his daughter was very ill and at the point of death and he was imploring the Lord please come and pray for my daughter she is even right now at the point of death and Jesus agrees to go with gyruss but I don't think they had gone very far before the scripture tells us that his journey was interrupted by a very desperate woman a woman that we all have heard about many times a woman with an issue of blood the Bible tells us that she had spent everything that she had to the physicians trying to get better hoping for a change but the Bible specifically tells us she rather grew worse when she heard of the Ministry of Jesus she said I've got to get to him if I can just touch the hem of His garment I know that I will be made whole there was a great crowd following Jesus everywhere he went and the crowd was thronging him and bumping him and brushing against him but all of a sudden Jesus stopped he knew that someone had touched him he perceived that virtue life had gone out of him and he turned to find out who it was it's almost like the disciples were a little bit making fun or laughing a little bit they said how is it that you would ask who touched you every one is touching you in the crowd but he explained there was something different about that touch it was a touch of faith it was a touch of desperation and I want you to know that Jesus responds to faith and he meets us at the point of our desperation that woman from that moment on was made completely whole I'm trying to imagine in my mind how gyruss was feeling I know that gyruss must have been concerned about this woman and her need and all of the others that were reaching out to Jesus but I think we're safe to assume that his daughter was foremost on his heart and in his mind I've got a feeling that in some way he was wishing that the Lord would hurry but he would rush because he knew that his daughter was just a few breaths away from death in fact the Bible tells us that as soon as Jesus spoke to this woman in mark 534 and he said under daughter by faith hath made thee whole going peace and be whole of thy plague the Bible tells us in the next verse while Jesus was yet speaking a messenger from the house of Jairus came and said I'm here to tell you your daughter has died and there's no need to trouble the master any longer I want you to know that must have been very difficult news for gyruss to hear but I want you to listen at how this story plays out Jesus as soon as he heard the word that was spoken by the ruler of the synagogue he looks at gyruss and he says be not afraid only believe what powerful words be not afraid only believe that that's so powerful because we understand that fear is a hindrance to belief to faith if we can allow the Lord to calm our fears then our faith can rise above the circumstances and we can reach out like the little woman with the issue of blood or gyruss whose heart was greatly grieved by the news that he had just received and Jesus didn't want fear to stand in the way of faith so he spoke to his fear first and then he spoke of his faith don't be afraid only believe I wonder how many hundreds of times we have son that song only believe all things are possible and indeed that they are so Jesus and gyruss they continue on their journey to his home Jesus asked the crowd you remain here he takes with him his inner circle Peter James and John and when they get to the home they find a confusion and noise weeping and wailing going on you see if you look at the words of the servant your daughter is dead if you look at that in the original it could have said dead is your daughter which is very strong language and what that actually means is the funeral is already beginning that means as it was the custom in that time and still today among the Jewish people to bury a body almost immediately after death usually at least within 24 hours so what happened was as soon as the little girl had been examined there is no heartbeat there is no breath the mourners were already hired this was the custom to bring in mourners to weep and to cry and a wail so that everyone in the neighborhood would know there had been a death it means that the body of that precious little girl would have already been what we would probably call today embalmed meaning in that period her body was anointed with spices and precious oils and was wrapped in strips of cloth I guess that would sort of be like what we would think a mummy would look like so the funeral was already in progression when Jesus gets to the house and he said why are you carrying on and making such a big Adu what is going on here this little girl this daughter is not dead she's just asleep no wonder they laughed him to scorn how could he say that she had been thoroughly examined her body oiled and spiced and now wrapped with grave clothes they were just waiting on gyrus to come home so that they could take her out to the graveyard and bury her and Jesus calls it sleeping why because he saw through the confusion he saw through the noise he wasn't listening to the other voices this is a lesson for you and I we have to shut out all the other voices that tell us it's too late there's no hope death is sure to come they'll never come back to the Lord there's no healing available for you today I don't know what the voices are in your life but I know that the weeping and the mourning and the carrying on was certainly saying it's finished it's done it's over and Jesus sends them out got to get doubt out of the way got to get unbelief out of the room and he goes over and perhaps he has to unravel the grave clothes a little bit because the Bible said he reaches in and takes her hand and he raises her up and he says to her being interpreted the Bible said he said damsel I say unto thee arise and straightway the Bible said she not only arose but she got up and walked around she was twelve years old again the Bible tells us there and they were all astonished with a great astonishment I imagine they were a funeral already in procession and Jesus comes in and makes the difference I want to tell you today that we have to take heart take courage take strength when we read something like this this isn't a fairy tale or just a story this is a heard of the power that Jesus has not had he's the same I don't know what your hopeless situation is and I I say that like this in quotations I don't believe it's hopeless but whatever that situation is it's left you feeling powerless gyrus can you imagine a father powerless he felt like there's nothing I can do Jesus was indeed his only hope we have to forget about the voices of doubt we have to forget about the fear that tries to paralyze us and we have to hear the words of truth from Scripture don't be afraid only believe we know then all things are possible maybe you have had a bad report from the doctor maybe your children are backslidden away from God maybe your spouse is not serving the Lord maybe your marriage is breaking apart you feel like there is no way out and no hope I want to tell you today that indeed he is Jesus Christ ha the same yesterday today and forever and he speaks to you from his word today don't be afraid only believe it's never too late to cry out to God I want to encourage you to do that right now cry out to him he still hears an answers prayer he's still able to turn your situation around he loves you so much god bless you only believe you
