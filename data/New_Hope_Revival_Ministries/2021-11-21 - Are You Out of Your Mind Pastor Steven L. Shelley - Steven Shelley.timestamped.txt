[39:24] worthy worthy lamb
[39:28] hallelujah we're going to go to the lord
[39:29] in prayer this morning
[39:32] i know i need a touch of my body this
[39:33] morning my voice is a little scratchy
[39:36] i know there are many sick fighting
[39:38] this morning so let's
[39:40] lift them up to the lord this morning do
[39:42] you have a unspoken prayer request by
[39:44] the lifting of your hand i know there
[39:45] are many
[39:47] would you ask the lord to give wisdom
[39:49] and strengthen brother greeley who's
[39:52] trying to repair a water leak out in the
[39:54] main parking lot or just in beside the
[39:57] parking lot we came in this morning it
[39:59] was flooded and we need to get that is
[40:02] this the main part of the main line so
[40:03] we need to get that taken care of and
[40:06] i appreciate him doing it so much ask
[40:08] the lord to help him
[40:09] continue to remember brother steve curry
[40:11] i spoke with sister anita just a few
[40:13] minutes ago and there are things in his
[40:16] body that we need the lord to do
[40:18] and there are still miracles yet to take
[40:21] place
[40:22] so we're asking the lord for that one
[40:24] thing that you could pray very targeted
[40:26] is
[40:27] that his body would multiply the
[40:29] moisture that it gets the fluids that
[40:31] it's able to take he's drinking but it's
[40:33] still not enough
[40:35] because of the hospice care he's not
[40:38] getting any fluids through the veins
[40:40] right now and uh he
[40:43] is not able to get enough to meet every
[40:46] need of every cell of his body so we're
[40:49] asking the lord to flood him and with
[40:52] what he gets to drink let it just
[40:53] multiply and you know god can do things
[40:56] we don't have to tell him how to do it
[40:58] but that was the only thing that came to
[40:59] me
[41:00] when i was praying before i came out
[41:02] here the lord would just multiply that
[41:05] and uh there are folks traveling some
[41:07] are not here today because of travel
[41:09] some are traveling this week believing
[41:11] us
[41:12] and some coming this way we want the
[41:14] lord to watch over them and keep each
[41:16] one of them safe
[41:17] in his tender care
[41:19] and some are grieving the loss of loved
[41:21] ones we have friends around
[41:24] the states that have lost loved ones
[41:26] this week to covet and they're dealing
[41:28] with it and fighting through it let's
[41:29] ask the lord to help them amen
[41:32] amen let's go to the lord and pray this
[41:33] morning
[41:37] [Music]
[41:38] babbling and
[41:40] so many others i don't need to call them
[41:42] all but god knows somehow he sees them
[41:45] sing this with me this morning

[51:14] he's so worthy
[51:20] you may be seated this morning i want to
[51:22] brag just a little bit on
[51:24] the musicians
[51:26] that we have i want to brag on the
[51:29] worship leading this morning
[51:31] and one of the reasons why is there ben
[51:33] sent a text early this morning
[51:36] this morning ben this morning
[51:39] he sent a text
[51:41] and
[51:42] he said we ought to try to sing the song
[51:44] i raise a hallelujah
[51:46] and
[51:48] so a new song is at the last minute is
[51:51] not always a good thing
[51:53] but they just determined to get in here
[51:55] and they only had a short time we had a
[51:57] few few little obstacles a flooded uh
[52:01] field out there and several things going
[52:04] on but they came in here and they uh
[52:06] went over it i don't know not many times
[52:09] two or three times
[52:11] and presented it this morning without
[52:12] flaw
[52:14] and i'm touched i really am i appreciate
[52:16] it so much the song is special
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:22] and what was so wonderful is most of you
[52:24] knew it i heard so many people singing
[52:26] it
[52:27] and so it was just meant to be
[52:30] but it couldn't be if we didn't have
[52:33] musicians who were willing to just jump
[52:35] in here and say well what we can do is
[52:37] try
[52:39] the worst thing that can happen is it
[52:41] don't go over all that well and we
[52:43] but we prayed in the back that god would
[52:45] anoint their hands to move and
[52:48] and find the right chord change and
[52:50] everything they needed to do and i
[52:51] thought it was
[52:52] beautiful enough that we should mention
[52:54] it
[52:55] and you know
[52:56] the words are just right
[52:59] they're just right i i raise a
[53:01] hallelujah
[53:02] right in the middle of the storm
[53:04] you know what else is there to do but
[53:06] give god praise because he deserves it
[53:09] he deserves the praise
[53:11] and some of you are being tested in your
[53:13] praise but thank god you're praising him
[53:15] anyway amen giving him praise anyway
[53:18] he's worthy
[53:22] sister evelyn why don't you come and
[53:24] sing and just shock us all and shock you
[53:26] even more
[53:28] would you
[53:30] we don't have a singer this morning so
[53:36] i don't know what she'll sing but since
[53:38] i just bragged on these musicians the
[53:40] pressure is on isn't it
[53:43] but i know they'll do fine sister evelyn

[53:48] and uh be glad to hear from her this

[59:07] praise god
[59:10] [Applause]
[59:11] how many of you believe the battle
[59:13] belongs to the lord
[59:15] it certainly does
[59:17] i'm so thankful that we know that this
[59:19] morning
[59:21] tuesday night of this week at seven
[59:23] o'clock we'll have our regular tuesday
[59:25] night service and we will
[59:27] do as we have done for many years now
[59:29] dedicate that service to testimonies
[59:32] of our thanksgiving to god
[59:34] it's not that we can only be thankful
[59:36] one time a year
[59:38] but it's a time that we set aside to
[59:40] remember what god has done for us so you
[59:42] that have not had an opportunity and you
[59:45] that have to testify lately then you can
[59:48] prepare you've got two days to work on
[59:50] your testimony and we're going to look
[59:53] forward to hearing from you on tuesday
[59:54] night and then next sunday morning at 11
[59:57] o'clock there's a service here and then
[59:59] sunday afternoon at five o'clock there's
[1:00:03] going to be a gathering for hanukkah
[1:00:05] time
[1:00:06] and uh for those of you who are visiting
[1:00:09] or those of you who are streaming you
[1:00:11] may find it strange that we uh celebrate
[1:00:15] hanukkah but we do it because jesus did
[1:00:18] it's in the book of john that he was
[1:00:20] there in the temple at the feast of
[1:00:22] dedication
[1:00:23] i didn't find any scriptures there where
[1:00:26] he went to a christmas party
[1:00:28] or where he went to an easter cantata
[1:00:31] but i do find a scripture where he was
[1:00:33] at the temple on the feast of dedication
[1:00:36] so it's a time for us to gather together
[1:00:38] as families and all are welcome to come
[1:00:40] and bring something to eat and we'll
[1:00:43] have fellowship and the kids will have
[1:00:45] games and if there's anyone who doesn't
[1:00:47] know how to get there we'll explain that
[1:00:49] to you next sunday but we're looking
[1:00:51] forward to a good time in the lord and
[1:00:53] that is the first night of hanukkah and
[1:00:56] so that would be the night the first
[1:00:57] candle is lit
[1:00:59] and uh it also happens to be our wedding
[1:01:01] anniversary but that's for next week to
[1:01:03] talk about
[1:01:05] today is zach and liz's
[1:01:09] wedding anniversary how many years
[1:01:12] seven years that's a good number
[1:01:14] great number
[1:01:16] i think you all can make it
[1:01:18] seven years happy anniversary
[1:01:21] [Applause]
[1:01:25] to those of you who ask from time to
[1:01:28] time about ma
[1:01:29] uh
[1:01:31] maybe ashley would be a better person to
[1:01:33] tell to ask about her day today
[1:01:36] because when we saw her yesterday i
[1:01:39] would have to tell you that she's
[1:01:40] exactly the same as she was the last
[1:01:42] time i saw her
[1:01:44] and so there are not any any uh
[1:01:47] positive changes so much but there are
[1:01:49] not any really negative changes as well
[1:01:52] she is at peace
[1:01:54] she had had lunch
[1:01:56] they had just put her back in the bed
[1:01:58] she was getting ready for her afternoon
[1:02:00] nap
[1:02:01] and uh she was sleepy that's for sure
[1:02:04] but we had a little while with her talk
[1:02:06] to her a little bit and uh it will never
[1:02:09] be easy for those of you who have been
[1:02:11] there it will never be easy for somebody
[1:02:13] that you have loved so dearly to just
[1:02:15] look through you
[1:02:16] and you realize that they really have no
[1:02:19] idea who who you are that's a very hard
[1:02:21] thing as so many of you know but i'm
[1:02:23] thankful that she
[1:02:25] uh is not suffering and i'm thankful
[1:02:28] that i don't know why as we sung in some
[1:02:31] of the songs this morning i don't
[1:02:32] understand the reasons why she is still
[1:02:34] here but there has to be a reason
[1:02:36] because god never makes a mistake
[1:02:39] and she could go tomorrow or she may be
[1:02:42] here years from now because
[1:02:45] she just seems quite
[1:02:47] happy and sassy
[1:02:49] none of that has changed
[1:02:52] and uh she did give me a couple real
[1:02:54] sweet winks
[1:02:56] and i appreciated them um but the best
[1:02:59] that you can do is to pray for her and i
[1:03:01] think that the nursing home is open a
[1:03:03] little bit more now and
[1:03:04] and if you wanted to go in you probably
[1:03:06] could arrange to do that with a mask and
[1:03:09] and all the other things that they uh
[1:03:11] have you to go through but i feel
[1:03:13] blessed that she's in a good place and
[1:03:15] is well taken care of and i thank you
[1:03:17] for praying for her and i'm mentioning
[1:03:19] her because today is her 76th birthday
[1:03:23] and so when you think of her pray for
[1:03:25] her that god's perfect will will be done
[1:03:27] in her body and in her life and then
[1:03:30] tuesday of this week is another big
[1:03:33] anniversary that would be josh and
[1:03:36] charity's anniversary is that right on
[1:03:38] tuesday how many years
[1:03:40] five boy these good numbers let's say
[1:03:43] happy anniversary to them
[1:03:46] five years
[1:03:49] i think you're going to make it
[1:03:52] i just i didn't want to say that about
[1:03:53] one and not say it about the other in
[1:03:55] case anybody was listening
[1:03:57] uh i believe they're gonna make it and
[1:03:59] then the next day is josh's birthday how
[1:04:02] old do you turn the next day 29
[1:04:05] 28. oh i was going to say your last year
[1:04:07] in the 20s but 28 so happy birthday to
[1:04:10] josh god bless you
[1:04:16] why don't we stand together and go to
[1:04:18] the word of god and i appreciate your
[1:04:20] pull this morning i hope you'll
[1:04:22] recognize that we are missing some
[1:04:25] and we need your help
[1:04:27] and uh
[1:04:28] well i've just gotta
[1:04:30] and and we bragged on the musicians but
[1:04:33] we didn't maybe really give them let's
[1:04:34] let's really thank god for them thank
[1:04:36] you so much
[1:04:38] appreciate what you've done the backup
[1:04:40] singers and
[1:04:42] all these folks in the sound booth too
[1:04:46] sometimes they don't get to enjoy it as
[1:04:47] much as others because they're busy
[1:04:49] working but may god bless them what is
[1:04:51] it
[1:04:53] my cord is hanging out all right
[1:04:55] well i want to
[1:05:00] is it in now
[1:05:02] uh it must have all must have all been
[1:05:04] hanging out
[1:05:06] john chapter eight this is a little bit
[1:05:09] of a
[1:05:11] hodgepodge this morning you know what
[1:05:13] that means
[1:05:14] it's a little bit of this and a little
[1:05:15] bit of that kind of like granny's
[1:05:17] goulash or something
[1:05:22] but we're going back to where we were
[1:05:26] and uh
[1:05:28] the second part of this
[1:05:30] i'm going to call are you out of your
[1:05:31] mind
[1:05:33] but the first part i'm going to continue
[1:05:36] with where i was john chapter 8
[1:05:40] verse 31-37
[1:05:42] then said jesus
[1:05:44] to those jews which believed on him
[1:05:48] if ye continue in my word then are ye my
[1:05:51] disciples indeed
[1:05:53] and ye shall know the truth
[1:05:56] and the truth shall make you free
[1:05:59] they answered him we be abraham's seed
[1:06:02] and we're never in bondage to any man
[1:06:05] how sayest thou
[1:06:08] that uh how sayest thou you shall be
[1:06:11] made free
[1:06:12] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[1:06:15] unto you whosoever committeth sin is the
[1:06:19] servant of sin
[1:06:20] and the servant abideth not in the house
[1:06:23] forever but the son s o n abideth ever
[1:06:28] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:06:31] i'm asking is there anyone here this
[1:06:33] morning that's been made free by the son
[1:06:37] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:06:40] you shall be
[1:06:43] free indeed that's not a little bit of
[1:06:44] free that's an abundance of free
[1:06:48] free indeed i know that you are
[1:06:50] abraham's seed but you seek to kill me
[1:06:54] and he explains very carefully why
[1:06:57] because my word hath no place
[1:07:00] in you
[1:07:01] god doesn't have any grandchildren
[1:07:04] so we can't claim our family line when
[1:07:06] we stand in the presence of the lord
[1:07:09] it's only if there is a place in you for
[1:07:13] god's seed to lay
[1:07:15] and if that is the case
[1:07:17] you have made a manger for the word of
[1:07:20] god the lion then you are a blessed and
[1:07:22] chosen vessel today
[1:07:24] because there's a world around us and a
[1:07:26] church around us that cannot make room
[1:07:29] for him no matter how hard they've tried
[1:07:31] they have failed in making room for him
[1:07:33] there is a people prepared before the
[1:07:36] foundation of the world to carry the
[1:07:38] seed of god in the earth particularly in
[1:07:41] the last days i counted an honor
[1:07:44] and a privilege to be one of those
[1:07:47] it doesn't give me bride pride it makes
[1:07:49] me sometimes want to lay on my face in
[1:07:52] the carpet and say lord i don't know why
[1:07:55] you would have chosen me but i'm
[1:07:57] thankful that you did let's pray a
[1:07:59] minute father we love you today
[1:08:03] our hearts have overflowed as we
[1:08:05] worshiped you
[1:08:07] and sung praises to your name now i'm so
[1:08:10] thankful lord that we can call on you
[1:08:13] anytime anywhere under any circumstances
[1:08:17] and you are always awake
[1:08:20] always alert
[1:08:22] always ready to hear from your children
[1:08:25] and so lord today we approach your word
[1:08:28] it is the word of life
[1:08:30] i am thankful for every person here each
[1:08:34] visitor each one who is a part of the
[1:08:37] home congregation and also those who are
[1:08:40] streaming around the world i'm grateful
[1:08:43] today that we could be gathered together
[1:08:45] this way and i ask oh lord above all
[1:08:48] that your word may find a lodging place
[1:08:51] into every one of our lives for your
[1:08:54] glory we don't want to just be carriers
[1:08:57] of the word but we want to be doers also
[1:09:00] we understand lord that there's a
[1:09:03] difference between the seed and the
[1:09:05] shock and we ask o god that you would
[1:09:08] help us to manifest who we are as your
[1:09:12] sons and as your seed we rebuke and defy
[1:09:17] every force of the enemy because we are
[1:09:21] covered by the blood of the spotless
[1:09:24] lamb we ask that every opposing spirit
[1:09:28] be driven from our midst today that
[1:09:31] heaven might break through
[1:09:33] in your holy word and you might equip us
[1:09:36] and help us to press in to everything
[1:09:39] you have prepared for us and we will
[1:09:42] give you glory and honor and praise for
[1:09:45] it's in the name of the lord jesus
[1:09:47] christ we pray and the saints said
[1:09:50] amen you may be seated
[1:09:52] i want to go to the message the choosing
[1:09:55] of a bride
[1:09:57] it is a message that we read from on
[1:10:00] tuesday evening and there were many of
[1:10:03] you who who did not have the privilege
[1:10:05] of being here and i don't know if you
[1:10:08] streamed or if you caught the the
[1:10:10] archive already or not but i have been
[1:10:13] captured by these three paragraphs i
[1:10:16] want to read them again as though i
[1:10:18] never read them to you and i want you to
[1:10:20] let them sink down into your heart i
[1:10:22] want you to understand you cannot choose
[1:10:25] the day
[1:10:26] of your deliverance
[1:10:28] you can choose freedom but you cannot
[1:10:32] choose the day of your deliverance god
[1:10:34] chooses that
[1:10:35] if he comes to help you it's at his
[1:10:38] choice you call
[1:10:40] but if he comes to break through in your
[1:10:42] life it's because of his sovereign will
[1:10:46] and so if you sense the holy spirit
[1:10:48] wooing you at any time
[1:10:51] any time you feel his presence
[1:10:54] it doesn't matter if you're riding down
[1:10:55] the road and there's a uh somebody in
[1:10:58] the vehicle with you that doesn't know
[1:11:00] anything about the things of god and you
[1:11:02] can't help it the peace of the lord
[1:11:04] overwhelms you and a tear kind of comes
[1:11:07] up in the corner of your eye don't ever
[1:11:09] be ashamed that you're sensitive to the
[1:11:12] holy spirit of god there's a people
[1:11:14] around us that don't even know he exists
[1:11:17] and so to know that he's real is a gift
[1:11:21] it's a blessing help me it's a privilege
[1:11:23] to be able to even know that he's real
[1:11:26] to even know that he exists you may be
[1:11:28] on the job or you may be in a public
[1:11:31] place or something may catch your
[1:11:33] attention and it may draw the presence
[1:11:35] of the lord he may be moving around you
[1:11:38] and wooing over your heart
[1:11:40] that's the minute to say amen
[1:11:43] that's the moment to respond to him if
[1:11:46] you sense that he has come to heal you
[1:11:48] that's the moment to stand up and say i
[1:11:51] take my healing in the name of the lord
[1:11:53] jesus christ nobody's going to be
[1:11:56] disturbed with you if you do that in the
[1:11:58] right atmosphere in a service
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:01] when some of you move like that when
[1:12:03] faith arises in the building and we've
[1:12:06] mentioned several weeks about people
[1:12:08] just coming to worship or maybe there's
[1:12:11] a high moment in a sermon a message and
[1:12:14] god is moving in here and somebody
[1:12:16] stands up and claps their hands it's not
[1:12:18] going to offend us it's not going to
[1:12:21] disturb us what you may be doing i don't
[1:12:25] know what your motive is but what you
[1:12:27] may be doing is personally claiming
[1:12:30] something that you sense happening
[1:12:32] around you and if you're doing that it's
[1:12:35] in that moment that you need to put all
[1:12:38] your attention on the lord and exercise
[1:12:41] all the faith that you have don't let
[1:12:44] any god-ordained moment pass you by
[1:12:48] it is possible even in predestination to
[1:12:52] miss
[1:12:53] the moment
[1:12:54] of your deliverance to miss the chosen
[1:12:57] and perfect moment that god would break
[1:12:59] through in your life he has a permissive
[1:13:02] will
[1:13:03] and so if you should recognize i didn't
[1:13:06] get in when i should have got in we know
[1:13:08] his mercy is extended to us and we just
[1:13:12] have to say lord forgive me that i miss
[1:13:15] an opportunity to receive something that
[1:13:17] you had prepared for me i'm so sorry and
[1:13:21] now i'm ready lord when you're ready
[1:13:24] will you pass my way again
[1:13:26] will you step up into my life again and
[1:13:29] accomplish what your desires are for me
[1:13:32] and i believe i've watched god's mercy
[1:13:34] do that i've seen the grace of god
[1:13:36] extended again to those who missed him
[1:13:39] in their stubbornness
[1:13:41] who missed him in their busyness
[1:13:44] that's his grace
[1:13:46] that's his love
[1:13:48] so to miss it forever i don't believe
[1:13:51] but can you miss an appointment you can
[1:13:54] but you need to remember he never misses
[1:13:56] one
[1:13:57] if you believe that same man
[1:13:59] the choosing of a bride
[1:14:01] and it's a dangerous thing this is
[1:14:04] paragraph 41.
[1:14:06] it's a dangerous thing
[1:14:10] to wait till that last hour
[1:14:12] too because you might take on something
[1:14:16] that you could never shake out of it
[1:14:20] how many of you know when a wrong spirit
[1:14:22] is taking a hold of a life
[1:14:25] the the problem is if that is a vessel
[1:14:29] that has once been cleaned
[1:14:32] now that life has taken on the influence
[1:14:35] of a foul spirit that enemy is never
[1:14:38] satisfied
[1:14:39] to stay at the level of his entry
[1:14:42] he always wants to magnify and multiply
[1:14:45] and intensify
[1:14:47] and if he can't take more control of
[1:14:50] your life how many of you know what
[1:14:51] jesus said he does he just calls out to
[1:14:54] others
[1:14:55] we mentioned that a couple of weeks ago
[1:14:57] that demon will just call out to other
[1:15:00] similar demons
[1:15:03] you know i was studying even this
[1:15:05] morning
[1:15:06] maybe i'll just i don't know if i want
[1:15:07] to
[1:15:08] pause to do this right now or not
[1:15:11] let me see if i do
[1:15:13] maybe i do
[1:15:15] because it's at the very last speck of
[1:15:18] my notes
[1:15:20] and i may never get there
[1:15:21] how many of you would like to take a
[1:15:23] list
[1:15:24] of some of the spirits that brother
[1:15:26] branham refers to specifically
[1:15:29] when he's teaching on demonology i'm
[1:15:31] going to give you a list whether you
[1:15:33] want them or not
[1:15:34] i'm going to give you a list
[1:15:36] and i'm going to categorize those into
[1:15:39] the three realms
[1:15:41] that brother branham talks about these
[1:15:43] demon spirits operating in number one
[1:15:46] and you can find the basis of this
[1:15:48] message
[1:15:50] uh
[1:15:50] in the demonology series but there are
[1:15:54] many other places where brother branham
[1:15:56] is speaking particularly in prayer lines
[1:15:59] where he's talking about how these
[1:16:01] spirits operate how they strengthen one
[1:16:04] another how they call to one another to
[1:16:06] attract one another so that they might
[1:16:08] be strengthened in taking a hold of
[1:16:11] somebody's life or building a stronghold
[1:16:14] in a community of faith in the spirit
[1:16:17] realm
[1:16:18] and we'll go back we're not going to
[1:16:19] teach on this this morning but i've been
[1:16:21] wanting to give you this list now for a
[1:16:23] couple services
[1:16:25] in the spirit realm he said there's
[1:16:27] nervousness
[1:16:30] depression now remember
[1:16:33] i i don't want to leave that hanging
[1:16:35] remember brother branham talks about a
[1:16:37] spiritual man or person or woman being
[1:16:40] nervous
[1:16:42] now that is
[1:16:43] a a condition that is necessary
[1:16:47] for that individual to be sensitive
[1:16:51] to both and foremost god the holy spirit
[1:16:54] the leadership of the holy spirit but he
[1:16:57] may also need to be sensitive to that
[1:17:00] other side so that he can recognize in
[1:17:02] discernment what's going on what kind of
[1:17:05] a spirit is trying to operate
[1:17:07] that's not particularly the kind of
[1:17:09] nervousness brother branham is talking
[1:17:11] about in a prayer line when he would
[1:17:13] speak to someone and he'd say now lady
[1:17:16] your problem is you're just so nervous
[1:17:20] you just get so nervous and it's
[1:17:23] affecting your physical body maybe
[1:17:26] causing an ulcer or some other physical
[1:17:29] condition
[1:17:30] so brother branham is kind of explaining
[1:17:33] to us that a spirit that manifests from
[1:17:37] the spiritual realm can cause a physical
[1:17:41] malady
[1:17:42] now that's interesting to note so when
[1:17:44] brother branham is talking about
[1:17:46] nervousness it's probably closer here to
[1:17:50] anxiety
[1:17:52] and how many of you know anxiety you
[1:17:54] don't have to be anxious to be spiritual
[1:17:58] so you understand
[1:18:00] you can be nervous you may have to be
[1:18:01] nervous to pick up on spirits
[1:18:04] sensitive we will say
[1:18:06] but anxiety and anxiousness will cause
[1:18:09] fear
[1:18:10] and fear doesn't bring us into the
[1:18:12] realms of the spirit fear brings us
[1:18:16] into death
[1:18:17] fear brings us into doubt so he mentions
[1:18:20] number one nervousness
[1:18:23] depression
[1:18:25] arrogance
[1:18:26] he speaks specifically
[1:18:29] about demons manifesting themselves in a
[1:18:32] religious realm
[1:18:34] with a with a demeanor of arrogance
[1:18:38] maybe you've seen that
[1:18:41] see if you recognize this one this is
[1:18:43] the one that really sort of got in my
[1:18:46] mind this morning as i was looking at
[1:18:48] this
[1:18:49] he calls it a sullen
[1:18:52] sullen
[1:18:53] sullen ungodly spirit
[1:18:57] sullen
[1:18:59] well i thought in my mind i knew what
[1:19:01] sullen meant but i thought i better
[1:19:04] check it out so i looked it up before i
[1:19:06] came over here this morning it means
[1:19:08] sulky
[1:19:13] sulky
[1:19:14] gloomy
[1:19:16] and can mean
[1:19:18] bad tempered
[1:19:22] you ever seen that kind of a spirit
[1:19:24] manifesting in somebody where they were
[1:19:26] sulky
[1:19:28] sullen
[1:19:30] gloomy
[1:19:31] you know that's brother branham said
[1:19:33] that's not of god
[1:19:35] wait just a moment
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:38] he said that is a demon spirit
[1:19:41] manifesting
[1:19:43] in the spiritual realm
[1:19:45] that means that spirit's got to be dealt
[1:19:47] with
[1:19:48] god does not want his children to be
[1:19:51] sulky
[1:19:52] pouty
[1:19:54] you know that's what it means
[1:19:56] he doesn't want us to pout with one
[1:19:58] another
[1:19:59] i felt that thing take a hold of me
[1:20:01] i know what a pouty thing can do
[1:20:06] the best way for you to see yourself is
[1:20:08] for me to be transparent
[1:20:10] and tell you i have recognized a pouty
[1:20:13] spirit trying to get on me
[1:20:15] that's not of god
[1:20:17] and brother branham said that has to be
[1:20:19] addressed just like any other demonic
[1:20:22] spirit a sullen ungodly spirit
[1:20:26] insanity
[1:20:28] worldly spirits
[1:20:31] all of this
[1:20:32] he said are demons that manifest in the
[1:20:35] spirit world in the spirit realm
[1:20:38] worldly spirits
[1:20:40] spirit of darkness
[1:20:43] drinking
[1:20:44] smoking bad habits
[1:20:48] now in the physical realm
[1:20:50] these are the ones that brother branham
[1:20:52] mentioned there's hundreds more
[1:20:56] but these are the ones that he
[1:20:58] specifically mentions a tumor
[1:21:01] cancer
[1:21:03] pneumonia
[1:21:05] arthritis
[1:21:07] cataracts
[1:21:08] rheumatism
[1:21:10] tuberculosis
[1:21:12] epilepsy
[1:21:14] asthmatic conditions
[1:21:17] germ diseases
[1:21:19] ulcer
[1:21:21] deafness
[1:21:22] blindness
[1:21:24] etc
[1:21:26] of all the listing there
[1:21:28] the one that shocked me the most was a
[1:21:30] cataract
[1:21:33] brother branham said that is a demon
[1:21:36] expressing himself
[1:21:38] in the physical realm
[1:21:41] now somebody said oh no i've had a
[1:21:43] cataract i don't want to have a demon
[1:21:46] please understand it doesn't mean
[1:21:48] somebody has a demon
[1:21:50] it means that a demon is projecting
[1:21:53] itself in the physical realm
[1:21:55] did anybody notice how many of those
[1:21:58] things are related to breathing
[1:22:02] tuberculosis
[1:22:04] asthmatic condition
[1:22:07] pneumonia
[1:22:09] that got me to thinking
[1:22:12] more than any other part of the body
[1:22:15] what has been attacked across the world
[1:22:17] in the last couple of years the lungs
[1:22:20] pneumonia oh and let's not mention germ
[1:22:23] diseases
[1:22:25] because a germ disease brother branham
[1:22:27] talks one time and he says something
[1:22:29] about it being viral we know it can be
[1:22:32] viral or bacterial
[1:22:34] viral disease and bacterial disease are
[1:22:37] both considered germ diseases and they
[1:22:40] have their their origin in a germ and
[1:22:43] the prophet said these are demon spirits
[1:22:46] that like to manifest themselves in the
[1:22:49] physical realm
[1:22:50] against people
[1:22:52] i want to say particularly against god's
[1:22:55] people
[1:22:56] now you know what that tells me it tells
[1:22:58] me that you and i have power and
[1:23:00] authority over tumors and cancer and
[1:23:03] pneumonia and arthritis and cataracts
[1:23:05] and rheumatism and tuberculosis and
[1:23:08] empath on and on
[1:23:10] it also shows me that as believers we
[1:23:12] have authority over worldly spirits and
[1:23:15] spirits of darkness and drinking and
[1:23:17] smoking and habits and even sullen
[1:23:20] ungodly spirits
[1:23:22] you have authority even over pouty
[1:23:24] devils
[1:23:28] why would the enemy want you to be
[1:23:30] sullen
[1:23:32] why would he want you to be pouty
[1:23:34] well first of all you can't be grateful
[1:23:39] and thankful
[1:23:40] and pouty at the same time
[1:23:43] that old sullen spirit will rob us of
[1:23:45] our joy
[1:23:47] it'll take away our very thro
[1:23:50] zest i'm gonna use the word zest for
[1:23:52] life
[1:23:53] it'll suck us like a leech
[1:23:56] until there's nothing left in us and
[1:23:58] i'll tell you that ought to make you mad
[1:24:01] how many of you have ever had a loved
[1:24:03] one
[1:24:04] that was fighting cancer and you and it
[1:24:06] made you mad when you thought about what
[1:24:08] cancer was doing to their body
[1:24:11] it makes me mad when i think about how
[1:24:14] those cells eat up a body
[1:24:17] and sometimes it takes a little bit of
[1:24:19] that of that stirring up and a righteous
[1:24:21] indignation to get on us so that we
[1:24:24] begin to realize that god has given us
[1:24:27] authority over those things that are
[1:24:30] manifestations of the demonic
[1:24:32] now mind you brother branham did say
[1:24:35] that every person who was sick in this
[1:24:37] manner did not all receive it because of
[1:24:40] a demon attack
[1:24:41] there are things that we eat and brother
[1:24:43] branham brought that out
[1:24:45] there are things that we eat with our
[1:24:47] hybrid food that cause changes on a
[1:24:50] cellular and molecular level in our body
[1:24:53] and so there are times that we will
[1:24:55] we'll find disease and develop disease
[1:24:58] and it may or may not be related to the
[1:25:01] demonic but i want to tell you something
[1:25:03] if it touches a child of god i don't
[1:25:06] believe god's doing it
[1:25:08] if it's touching a child of god i
[1:25:10] believe there's a spirit life behind it
[1:25:12] and we can learn by the word of god how
[1:25:14] to deal with that thing anybody with me
[1:25:18] now then he said those demons will
[1:25:20] sometimes manifest in the religious
[1:25:22] realm
[1:25:24] spirit realm was the nervousness and the
[1:25:27] depression and the arrogance
[1:25:30] the physical realm was the tumor and the
[1:25:33] cancer and the arthritis
[1:25:35] and others
[1:25:37] the religious realm he said spirit of
[1:25:39] doubt
[1:25:40] you ever dealt with that spirit
[1:25:44] unclean spirit anybody ever dealt with
[1:25:46] an unclean spirit
[1:25:48] superstition
[1:25:56] i have to tell people around me all the
[1:25:57] time there's no such thing as a pair of
[1:25:59] lucky underwear
[1:26:02] there's no such thing about hitting more
[1:26:04] home runs when you got on your lucky
[1:26:06] socks
[1:26:09] that is superstitious
[1:26:11] i don't believe in such as that
[1:26:14] but demon spirits are limited at how
[1:26:16] they can manifest in the life of a
[1:26:18] believer
[1:26:19] and so they like to do it sometime in a
[1:26:22] religious realm
[1:26:23] and tie them up with superstition
[1:26:27] even unbelief and brother branham even
[1:26:29] said sin
[1:26:30] the manifestation of unbelief and sin
[1:26:34] that sometimes comes out of the life of
[1:26:36] a believer is a product of a demon
[1:26:39] operating in the religious realm
[1:26:42] now i don't want you to get bogged down
[1:26:44] in those things i want you to always
[1:26:46] remember that jesus said behold i have
[1:26:49] given you
[1:26:51] power
[1:26:53] help me now
[1:26:54] i have given you power over all
[1:26:58] the powers of the enemy
[1:27:01] then why would we even emphasize or
[1:27:04] bring some of this out because i am
[1:27:06] thoroughly convinced that we as
[1:27:08] believers are living way below our
[1:27:12] authority level
[1:27:14] and when we begin to recognize that
[1:27:17] satan desires to eat us
[1:27:21] from the inside out
[1:27:24] and if he can't do it with cancer he'll
[1:27:26] do it with depression
[1:27:28] he'll make you such a nervous wreck and
[1:27:31] fill you with so much anxiety that you
[1:27:34] can't hardly breathe
[1:27:36] and he will do anything and everything
[1:27:39] because his ultimate goal is not just to
[1:27:41] distract you i want to tell you he came
[1:27:44] to destroy
[1:27:46] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[1:27:50] to kill
[1:27:52] and to destroy
[1:27:54] and that's what he wants to do in your
[1:27:56] life but if brother branham tells us so
[1:27:58] many times if that bride when she begins
[1:28:01] to recognize
[1:28:05] who she is
[1:28:07] why is that so powerful because then she
[1:28:10] understands the authority that she
[1:28:12] carries
[1:28:13] i'll read that to you in a little while
[1:28:15] now let's go back to the choosing of a
[1:28:17] bride i'm glad i got that out
[1:28:20] i've been moving that to the end of the
[1:28:21] notes
[1:28:22] and i'll do some more you'll see some
[1:28:25] more interesting things
[1:28:27] at another time
[1:28:28] let's go back to paragraph 41.
[1:28:33] it's a dangerous thing to wait till that
[1:28:35] last hour
[1:28:36] to
[1:28:37] because you might take on something that
[1:28:40] you could never shake out of
[1:28:42] out of it
[1:28:44] you know there's a time when you can be
[1:28:46] warned then if you step across that line
[1:28:49] of warning then you're already marked on
[1:28:52] the other side
[1:28:54] branded now this is look this is the
[1:28:57] master this this prophet of god
[1:29:00] taught election
[1:29:03] and
[1:29:03] predestination
[1:29:05] like no other
[1:29:07] he brought the perfect balance
[1:29:10] between armenianism and calvinism
[1:29:14] because he brought it from the
[1:29:16] perspective of the word
[1:29:19] he believed in the sovereignty of god
[1:29:21] like no other
[1:29:23] but i want you to listen to his words to
[1:29:26] us here it's a dangerous thing to wait
[1:29:28] till the last hour or two because you
[1:29:29] might take on something you could never
[1:29:31] shake out of it
[1:29:33] you know there's a time when you can be
[1:29:35] warned then if you step across that line
[1:29:37] of warning then you're already marked on
[1:29:40] the other side branded
[1:29:42] remember when the jubilee year come and
[1:29:45] the priests rode with this trumpet
[1:29:47] sounding that every slave could go free
[1:29:50] listen now but if they refuse oh brother
[1:29:54] sister
[1:29:57] don't refuse
[1:29:59] to be a part of what god is desiring to
[1:30:02] do for you
[1:30:05] for you
[1:30:07] in this hour
[1:30:09] don't miss out on your chance
[1:30:13] to bust out look you may not have a
[1:30:16] demon spirit holding you back you may be
[1:30:18] living in a comfort zone
[1:30:20] that's holding you back
[1:30:23] i'll tell you that's part of the devil's
[1:30:24] doings too
[1:30:26] he likes to lull us to sleep
[1:30:28] doesn't he he likes to put us in a place
[1:30:31] where we're so comfortable that we don't
[1:30:33] do anything anymore pull anymore push
[1:30:35] anymore pray anymore read the bible
[1:30:38] anymore pray fast and pray anymore
[1:30:41] that's why brother branham said you've
[1:30:42] gone as far as you're going to go we
[1:30:45] have gone as far as we're ever going to
[1:30:47] go until we
[1:30:50] pay a greater price
[1:30:52] and so you can get love into a place of
[1:30:56] of spiritual lukewarmness that may be
[1:30:59] the only spirit you need to bust out of
[1:31:02] but that in itself is enough that you
[1:31:05] can cry out for for deliverance from
[1:31:08] your comfort zone
[1:31:10] he said remember if they refuse to
[1:31:13] accept their freedom
[1:31:15] then he had to be taken to the temple to
[1:31:18] a post and an awl bore him through the
[1:31:22] ear and then he served his master always
[1:31:27] i'm going to say something here and i
[1:31:29] know there's no holiness people here but
[1:31:31] i'm going to say this anyway
[1:31:33] that is one of the reasons why it
[1:31:36] troubles me to see a woman put a hole in
[1:31:39] her ear
[1:31:41] because i know what it represents
[1:31:46] you say that's easy for you to say look
[1:31:49] my mother
[1:31:51] she had holes
[1:31:53] in her ear
[1:31:54] one in each ear and that wasn't enough
[1:31:58] because the spirit of the world was
[1:32:00] working on her
[1:32:02] and she just got an idea one day oh i'll
[1:32:05] tell you her own her own baptist granny
[1:32:08] my granny her baptist mother who wore
[1:32:10] clip-ons
[1:32:12] once a week
[1:32:17] you know she wouldn't wear a pierced
[1:32:19] wouldn't have pierced her ear she was a
[1:32:20] little baptist granny but she wear her
[1:32:22] clip-ons to church on sunday ironically
[1:32:25] when my mother come home from work one
[1:32:27] day late
[1:32:28] and she had three or four holes in her
[1:32:31] ear
[1:32:32] my mama her little baptist mama i'm
[1:32:34] telling you
[1:32:35] you you would have thought that she just
[1:32:38] really sold her soul
[1:32:41] she said oh
[1:32:43] jane why
[1:32:46] would you do that
[1:32:49] it looks ridiculous
[1:32:55] and mama said my mother said to her
[1:32:57] mother said well well mama i just got to
[1:33:00] looking at everybody else and i thought
[1:33:01] it looked nice on so and so she called
[1:33:03] her name and the next thing i thought it
[1:33:06] might look nice on me you don't think it
[1:33:07] does
[1:33:09] and i'll never forget as long as i live
[1:33:11] her mother said you'll look like a freak
[1:33:16] but i'm going to love you anyway
[1:33:20] when i see a woman with her ear a hole
[1:33:23] in her ear and these ear bobs that they
[1:33:25] wear and listen here
[1:33:27] now you see women claiming christianity
[1:33:30] with them in their
[1:33:34] noses not just them fly specs
[1:33:38] that they wear sometimes but bull rings
[1:33:44] they open their mouth and some old stud
[1:33:46] it comes out on the tongue
[1:33:49] i said to a girl not too long ago at
[1:33:51] culver's i said what in the world would
[1:33:54] make you want to have that thing like
[1:33:56] that in your lip don't that bump your
[1:33:58] teeth
[1:33:59] and she looked at me and she said you
[1:34:01] know what it does
[1:34:04] it about drives me crazy i didn't say it
[1:34:07] in a hateful way my family if they see
[1:34:09] me stewing or thinking they just leave
[1:34:11] me
[1:34:13] they just go sit down
[1:34:15] i didn't say that in a hateful way she
[1:34:17] didn't respond in a hateful way
[1:34:19] i'm curious that's what possesses
[1:34:22] somebody to want to identify as a slave
[1:34:26] do you understand this is a symbol of
[1:34:29] slavery it always has been and it always
[1:34:32] will be god's people we don't want to be
[1:34:35] identified with slavery
[1:34:38] we don't want to be identified with
[1:34:39] those that have no will of their own we
[1:34:42] want to be identified with those who
[1:34:44] have given everything to jesus christ if
[1:34:47] you're going to wear a hole in your ear
[1:34:48] let it be your spiritual here brother
[1:34:50] branham said and be sold out to him and
[1:34:54] no one else
[1:34:55] to hear his voice and no other voice
[1:34:59] he said if they refused to accept their
[1:35:01] freedom then he had to be taken to the
[1:35:03] temple to a post and an all bore him
[1:35:06] through the ear and then he served his
[1:35:09] master always in that culture he could
[1:35:11] never be free
[1:35:14] it was a perpetual covenant
[1:35:17] with a physical sign
[1:35:20] that he would serve that master the rest
[1:35:23] of the days of his life let me tell you
[1:35:25] something you don't want that in the
[1:35:27] natural
[1:35:28] and you don't want that in the spiritual
[1:35:31] let me say to all you young girls you
[1:35:33] may see it out there on instagram
[1:35:35] you may see it in the world you may see
[1:35:38] others that you love of doing things
[1:35:40] like that and you may think it looks
[1:35:42] pretty but i want you to know there are
[1:35:44] spirits behind that
[1:35:48] there's a bondage that goes along with
[1:35:50] that and you don't want no part of it
[1:35:54] come on now
[1:35:55] and now men who would have ever thought
[1:35:57] but here we are
[1:35:58] and it gets worse as the days go by i
[1:36:00] know it's quiet i know that people are
[1:36:02] turning me off
[1:36:04] i'm just been canceled on youtube some
[1:36:07] folks was watching now they're not
[1:36:09] probably in facebook i want to tell you
[1:36:11] something here it's still the truth
[1:36:13] he said in many times men and women hear
[1:36:15] god's truth and see it vindicated and
[1:36:18] proven truth but yet they don't want to
[1:36:21] hear it
[1:36:22] there's some other reason there's some
[1:36:24] other choosing that they have than to
[1:36:26] face up to truth and facts therefore
[1:36:29] their ears can be close to the gospel
[1:36:32] let me tell you something don't turn a
[1:36:33] deaf ear and turn a deaf ear and turn a
[1:36:36] deaf ear and turn a deaf ear until your
[1:36:39] ears become hardened and you can hear
[1:36:41] the truth that god sends to set you free
[1:36:44] sometimes you have to look above the
[1:36:46] messenger you have to look above the
[1:36:48] vessel and you have to recognize that
[1:36:51] god will use anybody to speak to us
[1:36:53] because he loves us
[1:36:56] so sometimes you've got to look beyond
[1:36:57] the package
[1:37:01] some of the truest words of prophecy
[1:37:03] that have ever been spoken over my life
[1:37:05] were spoken over me by people that do
[1:37:08] not have this message as their standard
[1:37:12] but i knew that god was using them
[1:37:14] somehow to speak to me
[1:37:17] and i had to get me and my opinion out
[1:37:19] of the way to be able to recognize that
[1:37:22] god will use anybody that says yes
[1:37:24] in fact brother sister he'll use you
[1:37:27] if you'll say yes more
[1:37:29] he'll use us more if we surrender more
[1:37:33] if we volunteer more
[1:37:35] if we're willing more how many of you
[1:37:37] believe he will he will so he goes on
[1:37:42] therefore their ears can be close to the
[1:37:43] gospel they'll never hear it again
[1:37:46] my advice to you
[1:37:50] oh wear this on a t-shirt
[1:37:52] put this on your bumper sticker
[1:37:55] keep this in front of you write yourself
[1:37:57] a note like this and put it on your
[1:37:59] computer i have notes on my computer i
[1:38:02] took some down when i changed my office
[1:38:04] around i want to get some out and put
[1:38:06] them back up one that i have that i
[1:38:08] don't always obey
[1:38:10] but i have it there to condemn me when i
[1:38:12] don't
[1:38:13] eat the frog early
[1:38:18] brother robert you ought to put that one
[1:38:19] on yours
[1:38:21] eat the frog early
[1:38:23] he ain't going nowhere
[1:38:25] that thing that you do not enjoy doing
[1:38:28] in the course of your day
[1:38:31] i'll do that after lunch i'll do that
[1:38:33] after snack i'll do that after coffee
[1:38:35] time i'll do that after come on now
[1:38:38] so i have tried and i have succeeded
[1:38:43] two out of five days
[1:38:45] to get in there and eat the frog early
[1:38:48] so that it don't hang over you how many
[1:38:50] of you ever have something hanging over
[1:38:51] you oh i don't want to do that i don't
[1:38:53] want to do that i don't want to do that
[1:38:55] put you one on your computer that says
[1:38:58] my advice to you when god speaks to your
[1:39:02] heart
[1:39:03] you act
[1:39:07] next service
[1:39:12] after thanksgiving
[1:39:14] when god speaks to your heart you act
[1:39:17] right then
[1:39:20] because god is looking for obedience
[1:39:24] if you believe that same amen
[1:39:26] now ii corinthians chapter 10 we've read
[1:39:29] this recently
[1:39:31] i want to read it again this is part of
[1:39:33] the hodgepodge
[1:39:35] i want to ask you this morning are you
[1:39:37] out of your mind
[1:39:38] and i want to tell you that if you're
[1:39:40] not out of your mind you're no good to
[1:39:42] the kingdom of god until you're out of
[1:39:44] your mind
[1:39:47] they say we're crazy
[1:39:49] they say we've lost our mind but they
[1:39:51] really falsely accuse us
[1:39:53] because too many of us are still in our
[1:39:56] mind
[1:39:58] i want to be in a place where when they
[1:40:00] say it it's really true
[1:40:02] that i'm out of my mind and i'm
[1:40:05] operating in another mind in another
[1:40:08] will
[1:40:09] in another way all together
[1:40:11] second corinthians 10
[1:40:13] verse four through six are you with me
[1:40:15] this morning for the weapons of our
[1:40:18] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:40:22] through god to the pulling down of
[1:40:25] strongholds
[1:40:27] what are you reading right now
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:29] what are you talking about you called it
[1:40:31] a hodgepodge what is this this is
[1:40:33] spiritual warfare
[1:40:36] you don't see any black clothed figures
[1:40:39] in this verse
[1:40:41] you don't see any demons with pitchforks
[1:40:44] in this verse
[1:40:46] but this is spiritual
[1:40:48] warfare this is the battle
[1:40:52] that is raging
[1:40:54] this describes what we're facing what
[1:40:57] we're fighting what we're struggling to
[1:40:59] overcome in this hour for the weapons of
[1:41:01] our warfare not carnal but mighty
[1:41:04] through god
[1:41:06] to the
[1:41:09] to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:41:11] demons spirits
[1:41:13] love to build paradigms and
[1:41:17] holes in our life
[1:41:21] because once we have a paradigm or a
[1:41:24] stronghold in our life it takes great
[1:41:29] conscious effort to see that thing
[1:41:32] brought down
[1:41:33] it doesn't just fall because you have
[1:41:36] wished it to be so there's only one way
[1:41:39] to get it down and that is for you
[1:41:42] to take a hold of the power of god and
[1:41:45] use his grace to pull that thing down
[1:41:49] nobody can pull down your strongholds
[1:41:51] but you nobody can change your paradigms
[1:41:55] but you nobody can kill death structures
[1:41:58] in your life but you
[1:42:01] you're the one that has the authority to
[1:42:03] do that
[1:42:04] if anybody tries to do that for you it's
[1:42:06] witchcraft
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:09] it's manipulation and control
[1:42:12] so for me to try to pull that down in
[1:42:14] your life would be illegal spiritually
[1:42:17] you are the only one a parent can't do
[1:42:19] it for their child they can certainly
[1:42:21] teach them the truth and show them the
[1:42:24] truth and pray for them in the truth
[1:42:27] but they cannot control the mind of a
[1:42:29] child
[1:42:31] or a teenager
[1:42:33] or an early tween
[1:42:36] they cannot control their mind
[1:42:39] but we can teach them how and set an
[1:42:41] example in front of them of how we
[1:42:44] destroy strongholds
[1:42:47] how we re redo recreate renew
[1:42:51] every thought in our mind until our
[1:42:54] paradigms are changed i want you to know
[1:42:56] that jesus wants to change every
[1:42:59] negative paradigm in your mind he wants
[1:43:02] to give you strength to pull down every
[1:43:04] stronghold and to destroy every death
[1:43:07] structure that the enemy tries to build
[1:43:09] up in our thoughts
[1:43:11] because that's where the battle is
[1:43:13] didn't we cover this yes for two years
[1:43:16] we covered it and guess what this
[1:43:18] morning we're back there
[1:43:20] we're back there why because we're still
[1:43:22] in the war because we're still in the
[1:43:25] battle
[1:43:26] casting down
[1:43:28] imaginations every one of these phrases
[1:43:31] speaks of effort
[1:43:34] and energy spent
[1:43:37] down imaginations and every high thing
[1:43:42] that exalteth itself against the
[1:43:44] knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:43:47] captivity
[1:43:49] taking
[1:43:50] prisoner every thought
[1:43:53] to thee
[1:43:55] read it for me
[1:43:56] to the obedience of christ
[1:43:59] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[1:44:02] disobedience when your obedience is
[1:44:07] fulfilled
[1:44:09] now that word warfare there as we have
[1:44:11] taught before it means campaign
[1:44:15] in the greek it's the word for campaign
[1:44:19] and we don't mean i don't think this
[1:44:21] means a political campaign this means a
[1:44:24] a military campaign
[1:44:26] so the scripture that the apostle the
[1:44:29] the word excuse me that the apostle is
[1:44:32] using here in verse 4 to describe the
[1:44:36] battle he calls it a warfare 10 and 4.
[1:44:40] this warfare means a campaign
[1:44:43] paul was not simply talking about a
[1:44:45] little skirmish that was going on at the
[1:44:48] church in corinth
[1:44:50] but he was talking about the attack of
[1:44:52] the enemy and how it was part of a much
[1:44:55] larger
[1:44:56] attack or campaign of satan against that
[1:45:00] little church in corinth and i want you
[1:45:03] to know the powers of hell are still
[1:45:05] trying to destroy the work of god
[1:45:09] i want to hear hear you
[1:45:11] the same devils that tried to destroy
[1:45:14] the work of god in corinth are alive and
[1:45:17] well today and they would like to
[1:45:19] destroy the work of god in this place
[1:45:21] and in every other place where the truth
[1:45:24] is upheld
[1:45:26] we're not giving any space to the enemy
[1:45:28] in this hour it's important that we
[1:45:29] don't yield any ground to him
[1:45:32] so he said the weapons of our warfare
[1:45:35] are not carnal they're not fleshy but
[1:45:38] they are mighty through god to the
[1:45:39] pulling down of strongholds that word
[1:45:42] strong means of arguments
[1:45:49] it doesn't mean this
[1:45:52] it doesn't mean the physical muscle and
[1:45:54] strength of the body
[1:45:56] it means arguments and reasonings
[1:45:59] by which a disputant endeavors to
[1:46:03] fortify his opinion
[1:46:05] and defend it against his opponent
[1:46:08] it is the same word that's used for a
[1:46:11] castle
[1:46:12] or a stronghold or a fortress how many
[1:46:15] of you know we can use words
[1:46:19] we can use thoughts
[1:46:22] phrases and feelings
[1:46:25] to build a castle a fortress
[1:46:28] in our mind
[1:46:30] that defends us
[1:46:32] in such a manner
[1:46:34] that we hide behind the castle of our
[1:46:37] own thoughts
[1:46:38] we hide behind the fortress of our own
[1:46:41] imaginations
[1:46:42] the problem is it neither
[1:46:45] protects us from the enemy
[1:46:48] what it actually does is it keeps us
[1:46:51] from yielding ourselves to the holy
[1:46:54] spirit
[1:46:55] so it not only fails in its ability to
[1:46:58] keep us from the hand of the enemy it
[1:47:00] actually strengthens his ability to keep
[1:47:02] putting his finger on things in our life
[1:47:05] but it also blocks us from following the
[1:47:08] general leadership of the holy spirit so
[1:47:10] every one of those strongholds arguments
[1:47:13] and reasonings by which a disputant
[1:47:15] endeavors to fortify his opinion and
[1:47:18] defend it against his opponent every one
[1:47:20] of those things has to be dealt with
[1:47:22] individually and it has to be done by
[1:47:25] the spirit because it's not a physical
[1:47:27] battle if you understand that say amen
[1:47:30] what's the weapon you know what the
[1:47:31] weapon is it's the word
[1:47:33] what is the weapon we used to to win
[1:47:35] every time the word
[1:47:38] and how many of you know we're not just
[1:47:39] talking about the quoting of words
[1:47:42] we're talking about a life connected to
[1:47:44] that word in faith you connect yourself
[1:47:46] to the word of god with your faith then
[1:47:48] you use that word and when you use that
[1:47:51] word because you are connected to that
[1:47:53] word in faith the enemy has no choice
[1:47:58] he has no choice but to obey that word
[1:48:02] did you know he has to obey the word
[1:48:04] he has to
[1:48:07] and so we could go through some of these
[1:48:08] words but i don't want to do that now
[1:48:10] because i've done that many times before
[1:48:12] but those were the ones i wanted to get
[1:48:14] in stay with me
[1:48:15] i want to read these verses in the
[1:48:17] amplified just a moment
[1:48:19] and i've given them to them so i think
[1:48:21] we can do it i want you to look at them
[1:48:22] carefully just a moment three through
[1:48:24] five in the amplified
[1:48:26] for though we walk live in the flesh
[1:48:30] we are not carrying on our warfare
[1:48:32] according to the flesh
[1:48:34] and using mere human weapons if you know
[1:48:37] that's the truth say amen
[1:48:39] i'm i'm having to pull for my amens
[1:48:42] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:48:44] physical weapons of flesh and blood but
[1:48:48] they are mighty before god for the
[1:48:51] overthrow
[1:48:53] and destruction
[1:48:58] the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:49:01] physical weapons of flesh and blood but
[1:49:02] mighty before god for the overthrow and
[1:49:05] destruction of strongholds that's
[1:49:07] powerful
[1:49:09] inasmuch
[1:49:11] as we refute
[1:49:14] some translations say destroy
[1:49:18] arguments
[1:49:19] and theories
[1:49:21] and reasonings
[1:49:23] some translations say lofty
[1:49:26] opinions and every proud and lofty thing
[1:49:30] that sets up
[1:49:32] that sets itself up against the true
[1:49:34] knowledge of god
[1:49:36] and we lead every thought
[1:49:38] and purpose away
[1:49:40] captive into the obedience of christ the
[1:49:44] messiah the anointed one how many of you
[1:49:46] get a picture when i read that i get a
[1:49:49] picture of what's going on now i want to
[1:49:52] read it in the complete jewish bible
[1:49:55] for although we do live
[1:49:57] in the world
[1:50:00] we do not wage war in a worldly way
[1:50:04] because the weapons we use to wage war
[1:50:08] are not worldly on the contrary
[1:50:11] i like this
[1:50:13] they have god's power
[1:50:15] for demolishing strongholds
[1:50:19] we
[1:50:20] demolish
[1:50:21] arguments
[1:50:23] and every arrogance
[1:50:26] that raises itself up against the
[1:50:30] knowledge of god
[1:50:32] we take every thought captive and make
[1:50:36] it obey the messiah
[1:50:39] how many of you believe if the bible
[1:50:41] said it we can do it
[1:50:43] not in our own strength not with our own
[1:50:46] wit but by the help and the grace of god
[1:50:51] and if we don't do it the alternative is
[1:50:54] we are bound
[1:50:56] we are bound we have not chosen freedom
[1:51:00] we have chosen to remain within a
[1:51:02] fortress of our own building i'm so
[1:51:06] thankful i'm so thankful
[1:51:08] now i want to just go back to verse 4
[1:51:10] for just a moment i wanted to get these
[1:51:13] other uh translations in
[1:51:16] i want to go back to verse 4 for just a
[1:51:18] moment and i want to read it in the new
[1:51:20] american standard and i don't usually go
[1:51:22] to all the different ones i love the
[1:51:24] amplified i enjoy the complete jewish
[1:51:27] bible but sometimes there are certain
[1:51:29] verses that the new american standard
[1:51:31] actually does a very good job some few
[1:51:34] verses
[1:51:35] does a very good job in pulling from the
[1:51:37] original and this is one of those one of
[1:51:39] those verses
[1:51:40] the new american standard says for the
[1:51:43] weapons
[1:51:44] of our warfare are not of the flesh but
[1:51:48] divinely powerful for the destruction of
[1:51:52] fortresses
[1:51:53] hallelujah
[1:51:55] every castle
[1:51:57] every fortress
[1:51:59] that the enemy desires to build in our
[1:52:02] mind through thoughts and lies
[1:52:05] we have been given power
[1:52:07] we have been given authority
[1:52:10] and yet if i were to ask you in this
[1:52:12] room how many of us are winning the
[1:52:14] battle of the vine i want you to know
[1:52:16] there'd be very few of us that would
[1:52:18] would boldly say i am winning the battle
[1:52:20] of the mine
[1:52:22] and that is because we think that
[1:52:24] winning is never having to fight again
[1:52:31] that's not winning
[1:52:33] winning is getting the victory and
[1:52:35] maintaining
[1:52:37] the victory until the very end
[1:52:40] so you're going to deal with those
[1:52:42] thoughts
[1:52:43] and you're going to deal with the
[1:52:45] attacks of the enemy and you're going to
[1:52:47] take god at his word pull down castles
[1:52:50] and fortresses and strongholds and
[1:52:53] paradigms and death structures you're
[1:52:56] going to pull them down each and every
[1:52:58] time and the enemy is going to come in
[1:53:01] and he's going to try to put it back
[1:53:02] together
[1:53:04] and what are you going to do you're
[1:53:06] going to say hey
[1:53:09] i recognize
[1:53:10] that i've already dealt with that by the
[1:53:13] word
[1:53:15] now i'm not going to wait till you get
[1:53:17] so high
[1:53:18] i'm going when you start laying one
[1:53:20] brick on another in the foundation of
[1:53:23] building that thing up in me again i'm
[1:53:25] going after that
[1:53:27] somebody said you know when you preach
[1:53:28] this every time
[1:53:30] there's no way possibly that anybody
[1:53:33] could have the time
[1:53:35] to do that on a regular basis
[1:53:38] well let me tell you something i have
[1:53:40] discovered it this is powerful
[1:53:47] the less you live
[1:53:49] in social media
[1:53:57] the less battles
[1:54:00] you'll fight in the mind
[1:54:02] you can say amen oh me
[1:54:05] you can say you ha you love social media
[1:54:08] you have church website we do we do all
[1:54:10] that we have church yes absolutely we're
[1:54:12] in touch with people all over the world
[1:54:15] i find that that keeps me more and more
[1:54:17] busy
[1:54:18] i'm more and more busy with inboxes and
[1:54:20] answering emails especially since we've
[1:54:22] opened the streaming of our services it
[1:54:24] keeps me very very busy and a lot less
[1:54:26] time to read what other people are
[1:54:28] posting and see what other people are
[1:54:30] eating and what other people are doing
[1:54:32] come on now
[1:54:33] and what i find by that is i have
[1:54:35] nothing to compare my life to
[1:54:40] i don't have to i don't have to worry
[1:54:42] about what somebody it doesn't bother me
[1:54:44] i don't have to worry when people are
[1:54:45] posting about me and won't call my name
[1:54:50] because they may or may not be
[1:54:52] their world may be a whole lot bigger
[1:54:54] than mine and i may think they're
[1:54:55] talking about me and they may not even
[1:54:57] have me in their mind when they post it
[1:54:59] but guess what if i don't see it i won't
[1:55:01] have to fight that battle
[1:55:02] or help me now
[1:55:04] help me now
[1:55:05] all things in moderation all things must
[1:55:08] have a balance i understand that we are
[1:55:11] not living like nuns sequestered
[1:55:13] somewhere hiding somewhere from the rest
[1:55:15] of the world i understand that there's a
[1:55:18] ministry in being connected i understand
[1:55:21] that very well but i'm telling you that
[1:55:24] if you find that a lot of your battle is
[1:55:28] because of what you're reading
[1:55:33] there's so much confusion
[1:55:36] in social media
[1:55:38] anybody going to help me i'm nearly done
[1:55:41] with this part
[1:55:43] there's a lot of confusion in social
[1:55:45] media
[1:55:47] there's a lot of stirring
[1:55:49] that goes on in social media
[1:55:53] unfortunately it's not just turning
[1:55:55] people against people
[1:55:57] it's even turning believers against
[1:55:58] believers
[1:56:00] i've seen believers fighting all week
[1:56:04] i mean really having it out
[1:56:06] over the verdict in the written house
[1:56:10] trial
[1:56:13] it's dividing
[1:56:14] it's causing there to be more issues of
[1:56:16] race than there has to be
[1:56:18] doesn't have to be everything everything
[1:56:20] in life does not have to be about race
[1:56:23] it is because people make it that
[1:56:25] it doesn't have to be that way they read
[1:56:27] it that way so that's what it's about
[1:56:28] but it doesn't have to be that way
[1:56:30] and now we have i mean message believers
[1:56:33] ministers all kinds of wonderful people
[1:56:35] who love the truth who believe the truth
[1:56:37] who are so angry at the verdict who who
[1:56:39] believe that the justice system has been
[1:56:41] hijacked and this was nothing in the
[1:56:43] world but the but the works of the enemy
[1:56:45] being vindicated and exalted and
[1:56:48] venerated and i don't know what all the
[1:56:49] word to use then you've got believers on
[1:56:51] the other side saying
[1:56:53] i've got a little hope left in the
[1:56:54] justice system and i'm so thankful that
[1:56:57] a message has been sent that a man can
[1:56:59] defend himself and blah blah blah and on
[1:57:02] and on and on and i have my opinion too
[1:57:06] i do
[1:57:09] i doubt i don't know why but it just so
[1:57:11] happened that i was able to watch a lot
[1:57:13] of the trial
[1:57:16] and i i actually enjoyed it enjoyed the
[1:57:19] trial i like the way that the law works
[1:57:22] if it works and so instead of instead of
[1:57:26] you know playing a crossword puzzle or
[1:57:28] something in the time that i had off
[1:57:30] then i i really enjoyed watching and i
[1:57:33] heard enough of it to
[1:57:34] to feel like i had a pretty good idea of
[1:57:36] what really went on and what really
[1:57:37] happened so i have my opinion too but do
[1:57:40] you know what
[1:57:42] if if my opinion is only put out there
[1:57:45] to divide people more
[1:57:48] i said what does it really matter
[1:57:53] what does it really matter
[1:57:55] you say it doesn't matter these things
[1:57:56] matter because they get in us
[1:57:59] we get all stirred up
[1:58:02] just like people who are just still so
[1:58:04] convinced that the election is going to
[1:58:07] be overturned
[1:58:11] maybe some believers here
[1:58:13] who have that kind of an idea
[1:58:16] you're going to be sadly mistaken and
[1:58:18] disappointed if that's what you're
[1:58:20] holding on to
[1:58:22] that america does not exist
[1:58:26] i need you to know i heard brother
[1:58:28] branham say this week do not expect it
[1:58:31] to get better
[1:58:34] we are nearing the end time
[1:58:36] it's only going to be worse
[1:58:39] come on now if you could really see if i
[1:58:43] could really see what went on behind the
[1:58:46] scenes
[1:58:48] we would have no faith in politics
[1:58:54] if we could see what the old indians saw
[1:58:59] that the left wing and the right wing
[1:59:03] are on the same bird
[1:59:07] he's got a right wing he's got a left
[1:59:09] it's the same way in our nation
[1:59:11] there there's no purity
[1:59:14] there's no godliness
[1:59:16] in politics
[1:59:18] god gave us a reprieve
[1:59:21] we're praying that it could be somehow
[1:59:24] revived and resurrected
[1:59:26] in the next election term
[1:59:29] but for those of people who are wasting
[1:59:31] their energy
[1:59:33] on something
[1:59:34] that they can't see the whole picture
[1:59:38] and understand that there are times
[1:59:40] that there are agreements made
[1:59:43] underneath the table
[1:59:45] behind the scenes behind the curtain
[1:59:48] there are agreements that are made in
[1:59:50] that dark world that we are not privy to
[1:59:55] come on now and let me just say this
[1:59:57] this is political i didn't i was
[1:59:58] certainly trying to pull you away from
[2:00:00] that not jump right in the middle of it
[2:00:02] but let me just say this did you ever
[2:00:04] wonder why your own party you that are
[2:00:06] republican did you ever wonder why your
[2:00:08] own party did so very little
[2:00:13] it was a few attorneys
[2:00:16] and some high-profile people
[2:00:18] but did you ever ever wonder why your
[2:00:20] own party did very little to try to
[2:00:22] overturn
[2:00:24] the election
[2:00:29] i'll tell you the answer
[2:00:31] because they weren't nearly as
[2:00:32] disappointed as they wanted you to think
[2:00:34] they were
[2:00:37] that's the sad state of affairs
[2:00:39] there's only one hope and that's for the
[2:00:41] righteous bride of jesus christ to stand
[2:00:44] up in this hour push back the darkness
[2:00:46] to the best of our ability until the
[2:00:48] last harvest of souls can come in and
[2:00:51] then brother they can have it
[2:00:54] they can have it
[2:00:55] hallelujah because we're looking for
[2:00:57] something higher than this
[2:01:00] our hope is not in man our faith is not
[2:01:03] in politics our hope is in jesus christ
[2:01:06] our future is in his hands it doesn't
[2:01:09] matter how wicked they get
[2:01:13] how did you feel during that
[2:01:14] 80-something minutes that for the first
[2:01:17] time in american history we had a woman
[2:01:19] president this week
[2:01:23] a lot of people didn't even know it
[2:01:25] but for the first time in history we had
[2:01:28] a woman president for 85 minutes or
[2:01:30] something like that
[2:01:32] because the authority was signed over to
[2:01:34] her while our
[2:01:36] president was having a colonoscopy and
[2:01:38] was under anesthesia do you know how
[2:01:41] serious it is for people
[2:01:43] that already have dementia issues do you
[2:01:45] know how serious it is for them to go
[2:01:46] under anesthesia in the first place
[2:01:49] so for the first time a woman and a
[2:01:51] woman of color
[2:01:54] had
[2:01:54] full presidential authority
[2:01:57] for a few moments of time
[2:02:00] including access to the nuclear codes
[2:02:04] that was reported out of washington
[2:02:06] aren't you glad god's bigger than
[2:02:07] politics
[2:02:10] aren't you glad that if she'd have been
[2:02:11] what some people thought she was in the
[2:02:13] beginning she there's no telling what
[2:02:14] she could have tried to do or what folks
[2:02:16] would have tried to do but aren't you
[2:02:18] glad that god's bigger than all of that
[2:02:20] and we're not putting our hope and trust
[2:02:22] in any of those things we're just
[2:02:24] pressing into the kingdom of god
[2:02:26] believing that god has an answer for
[2:02:28] this and he's about to call his bride
[2:02:31] out of here
[2:02:33] and i'm going in the first load
[2:02:35] are you still with me
[2:02:37] so we are destroying the speculations
[2:02:41] this is new american standard verse 5.
[2:02:44] we are destroying speculations
[2:02:47] and every lofty thing raised up against
[2:02:50] the knowledge of god
[2:02:52] and we are taking every thought captive
[2:02:55] to the obedience of christ because we
[2:02:57] don't have time to get involved with
[2:03:00] everything that's going on out there
[2:03:03] it eats us up
[2:03:06] it consumes our thoughts
[2:03:08] we have to pull away in him
[2:03:11] how many of you know you've got to pull
[2:03:12] aside in christ when the storm is raging
[2:03:15] around you
[2:03:17] if you find that you can't keep the
[2:03:18] victory and be on social media get off
[2:03:21] of it
[2:03:22] if you can't buy if you find that you
[2:03:24] can't
[2:03:25] have the victory and and float around on
[2:03:27] youtube get rid of it
[2:03:29] if you find that you've got a tv
[2:03:31] somewhere and you can't keep the victory
[2:03:33] get rid of it
[2:03:36] don't just don't just get rid of the
[2:03:38] machine and keep all the filth that
[2:03:40] comes into your phone
[2:03:42] understand that the enemy has more than
[2:03:44] one way to get to our mind
[2:03:47] and we somehow have to take authority
[2:03:49] over whatever we discover is stealing
[2:03:52] our victory
[2:03:53] i know some of you aren't with me i'm
[2:03:55] used to that by now
[2:03:57] but it's still the truth
[2:03:59] so this is the biggest
[2:04:02] portion of spiritual warfare that we are
[2:04:06] engaged in right now number one
[2:04:08] write it down
[2:04:10] to pull down
[2:04:12] all strong holes
[2:04:15] in our own
[2:04:17] mind
[2:04:21] number two to cast down imaginations
[2:04:27] number three you're recognizing it
[2:04:29] already
[2:04:30] to cast down every high
[2:04:33] thing that exalteth itself against the
[2:04:36] knowledge of christ
[2:04:39] number four to bring every thought into
[2:04:42] captivity and forcing it to obey christ
[2:04:46] the truth is
[2:04:47] that will keep most of us so
[2:04:50] busy
[2:04:52] that we will not have time to look for
[2:04:54] demons under rocks
[2:04:56] [Music]
[2:04:58] this kind of spiritual warfare is as
[2:05:01] vital
[2:05:02] as any form of spiritual warfare could
[2:05:05] ever be because this is winning the
[2:05:07] personal battle
[2:05:09] against every thought every imagination
[2:05:12] every stronghold every speculation every
[2:05:16] accusation that the enemy would raise up
[2:05:19] against us in this hour
[2:05:21] now i want to read to you before we
[2:05:23] close
[2:05:24] it's early still
[2:05:26] i want to read to you some notes that
[2:05:28] i've shared with you in the past that i
[2:05:30] pulled up today i didn't know i was
[2:05:32] going to do it when i woke up this
[2:05:33] morning
[2:05:35] so i had to pull some up
[2:05:38] and i want to read you a few notes that
[2:05:40] we have talked about from
[2:05:42] the subject of paradigms and a paradigm
[2:05:45] is like a stronghold
[2:05:47] it's a thought that you you have over
[2:05:50] and over and over and over again you
[2:05:52] entertain it over and over and over
[2:05:53] again you rehearse it and repeat it in
[2:05:55] your mind over and over again until it
[2:05:58] becomes your truth
[2:06:03] and every time i say it i think about
[2:06:05] papa paul kane
[2:06:07] his example
[2:06:09] and talked about his own insecurities
[2:06:11] and his own inferiorities
[2:06:15] and he said i'm so bad that if i go to a
[2:06:18] football game and they call a huddle
[2:06:20] he said i'm just sure they're all
[2:06:22] talking about me
[2:06:23] it's funny
[2:06:25] it's a joke
[2:06:27] but it was his reality
[2:06:32] i was involved with him closely enough
[2:06:35] for a short period of time
[2:06:37] to know that it was a joke that he told
[2:06:41] to make himself feel better but it was
[2:06:44] his own reality he really believed
[2:06:49] if if
[2:06:51] a day went by
[2:06:53] that he would send me an email and i
[2:06:55] wouldn't answer that email the next day
[2:06:58] i would get an email that would say are
[2:07:00] you mad with me
[2:07:02] are you hurt with me are you upset with
[2:07:04] me have you believed some lie about me
[2:07:09] i would say no papa paul
[2:07:11] i don't believe any of that
[2:07:13] i'm just busy
[2:07:16] i'll never forget the paranoid that
[2:07:17] struck me in ghana when the internet
[2:07:19] went down
[2:07:21] and i realized that when the internet
[2:07:23] went back up
[2:07:24] several days later my inbox would be
[2:07:26] full of emails from papa paul saying are
[2:07:28] you all right are you okay are we still
[2:07:30] friends
[2:07:32] this was his reality
[2:07:35] and i don't say that to expose him i say
[2:07:38] that to let you know that it's the
[2:07:40] enemy's job
[2:07:42] to build a paradigm in your mind
[2:07:46] that will cause you to feel like nobody
[2:07:49] loves you
[2:07:50] and everybody is against you and
[2:07:53] everybody wants to destroy you and
[2:07:56] everybody talks about you behind your
[2:07:58] back and they're all having a party and
[2:08:01] you're not invited
[2:08:04] he will pull that and pull that and pull
[2:08:07] that until it becomes your truth
[2:08:11] and you will be victim
[2:08:14] you are the victim brother
[2:08:16] i become the victim to that if i allow
[2:08:19] the enemy to build it in my head
[2:08:22] but i become the prisoner
[2:08:25] so i want to read you a few things i
[2:08:27] want you to i want to read them slowly
[2:08:29] you couldn't possibly write them all
[2:08:30] down
[2:08:31] but i can get them to you
[2:08:35] once you accept a thought most of this
[2:08:38] comes
[2:08:41] from
[2:08:42] dr caroline leaf
[2:08:46] once you accept a thought
[2:08:49] that thought is placed
[2:08:51] into your subconscious
[2:08:54] mind
[2:08:57] you have only a few seconds
[2:09:01] when you hear something
[2:09:03] to make a decision
[2:09:05] whether you accept that or not
[2:09:10] if you refuse it
[2:09:12] if in your mind you say i know that's
[2:09:14] not the truth
[2:09:15] and you don't entertain it again within
[2:09:17] a few seconds
[2:09:19] that energy
[2:09:22] represented by that thought
[2:09:25] literally
[2:09:27] leaves
[2:09:29] you have no recording of it
[2:09:32] it's god's gift
[2:09:35] it's how god
[2:09:36] built our brain
[2:09:38] because he loves us so much
[2:09:41] if
[2:09:42] we
[2:09:43] accept that thought
[2:09:45] it's placed in our subconscious mind
[2:09:49] whatever thoughts you choose to accept
[2:09:52] in your conscious mind
[2:09:55] must also be accepted in your
[2:09:58] subconscious mind
[2:10:01] it has no ability to reject
[2:10:04] any thoughts we continuously think
[2:10:08] are planted firmly in the subconscious
[2:10:11] part of the mind
[2:10:13] this repetition of thought is called
[2:10:16] habits
[2:10:17] or paradigms
[2:10:20] thoughts we choose with our conscious
[2:10:23] mind
[2:10:24] are impressed upon our subconscious mind
[2:10:28] it moves our body into a state of
[2:10:31] vibration
[2:10:33] which creates an action
[2:10:35] let me read it again
[2:10:37] thoughts we choose with our conscious
[2:10:39] mind are impressed upon our subconscious
[2:10:42] mind
[2:10:43] moving our body
[2:10:44] into a state of vibration which creates
[2:10:48] an action
[2:10:49] your conscious mind moves through your
[2:10:52] subconscious mind
[2:10:54] to cause you to carry out an action
[2:10:57] as we get older
[2:10:59] we find ourselves doing things
[2:11:01] automatically like we always did
[2:11:04] but not always in the right order
[2:11:10] only two or three people get it
[2:11:15] things get a little out of whack
[2:11:18] and that's why
[2:11:20] we uh
[2:11:23] can find our keys
[2:11:27] in various places i'm afraid to tell you
[2:11:30] some examples because
[2:11:32] you all want me to be evaluated you know
[2:11:36] you you just don't ever know where
[2:11:38] you're going to find something
[2:11:41] because you're going through the house
[2:11:42] to do something you always do
[2:11:45] something else strikes your mind that
[2:11:46] you need to do
[2:11:50] you go do that and then you see see what
[2:11:53] you what's that there for
[2:11:55] oh
[2:11:58] now i'm not saying this is any way
[2:11:59] connected i'm giving god the glory but i
[2:12:03] wanted to report that sister megan found
[2:12:05] her keys this week right let's praise
[2:12:07] god for that i'm not saying any of that
[2:12:10] is connected to her i'm just
[2:12:12] it just came to my mind
[2:12:15] listen to this
[2:12:17] that's how we do what we do that's how
[2:12:19] our body carries out it's through
[2:12:20] vibration
[2:12:22] thoughts we choose with our conscious
[2:12:23] mind are impressed upon our subconscious
[2:12:26] mind moving our body into a state of
[2:12:29] vibration which creates an action the
[2:12:32] actions that are produced create the
[2:12:34] results that you are getting in your
[2:12:36] life
[2:12:37] the important fact is that the belief
[2:12:41] entered your mind's paradigm
[2:12:44] it was put into your mind just like data
[2:12:47] is put into a computer and just like a
[2:12:50] computer when data is put into our
[2:12:53] subconscious mind the subconscious takes
[2:12:56] it as it is
[2:13:00] it does not have the ability to accept
[2:13:02] or reject
[2:13:04] the subconscious part of the mind does
[2:13:07] not analyze if it's true or not
[2:13:12] all of that takes place in the conscious
[2:13:14] mind
[2:13:15] so if you've got something new
[2:13:18] you receive it in your subconscious
[2:13:21] if you don't do something with it
[2:13:26] if you don't pull it down
[2:13:29] if you don't submit it to god's word
[2:13:32] it has the ability of being added to
[2:13:34] your paradigm as truth
[2:13:37] never being checked
[2:13:40] as truth or fiction
[2:13:44] have you ever wondered how people could
[2:13:45] believe what they believe
[2:13:47] have you ever believed have you ever
[2:13:48] wondered in the last two and a half
[2:13:50] years
[2:13:51] how people can believe what they believe
[2:13:56] did anybody get shocked when you saw how
[2:13:58] many billions of dollars was given by
[2:14:01] our government
[2:14:02] this
[2:14:03] week
[2:14:05] to pfizer
[2:14:08] and will be given also to the
[2:14:10] rest so that the government can buy
[2:14:13] hundreds of thousands of doses of the
[2:14:15] coveted pill now
[2:14:19] over 30 billion wasn't it over 30 maybe
[2:14:22] 38 billion dollars
[2:14:24] in the new
[2:14:26] bills and whatever else they're passing
[2:14:29] to buy so many doses of a covered pill
[2:14:33] does it blow your mind a little bit that
[2:14:35] now
[2:14:36] they're going to start distributing a
[2:14:37] pill
[2:14:39] that can do what
[2:14:42] a shot was supposed to be able to do for
[2:14:45] you
[2:14:48] are some of you joining the masses of
[2:14:50] people
[2:14:52] who say oh now i don't have to have it
[2:14:55] well i already took it to keep my job
[2:14:58] how can you get this out of me
[2:15:00] there's so much confusion around this
[2:15:02] world and that is because people have
[2:15:05] gotten to a place where they receive
[2:15:07] something into the subconscious mind
[2:15:10] without ever having the ability there to
[2:15:13] evaluate whether it's truth or not
[2:15:15] but they keep hearing it
[2:15:17] it's not that they believed it initially
[2:15:19] but they read it and they read it and
[2:15:21] they read it and they see it and they
[2:15:23] read it and they see it and they hear it
[2:15:25] and they get threatened
[2:15:27] and they get fearful
[2:15:29] and they get told they can't eat at a
[2:15:31] table
[2:15:32] they got to sit on the floor and they
[2:15:33] got to do this and that and the next
[2:15:35] thing you know
[2:15:36] they have accepted something that is not
[2:15:38] necessarily the truth because they kept
[2:15:41] seeing it
[2:15:42] the enemy works the same way
[2:15:45] he keeps flashing a lie about you
[2:15:48] over and over and over and over again
[2:15:52] you may know that it's not the truth but
[2:15:54] if you don't put that thought in its
[2:15:57] place
[2:15:59] and you allow the enemy to keep flashing
[2:16:02] that in front of you it will become your
[2:16:04] truth
[2:16:05] it will become a part of your conscious
[2:16:07] mind it will become a part of your
[2:16:10] stronghold and your paradigm and it will
[2:16:13] cheat you out of everything that god has
[2:16:15] for you in this hour including your
[2:16:18] overcoming victory
[2:16:20] and it's just a lie
[2:16:22] that's been told over and over and over
[2:16:25] and over and over again until the person
[2:16:28] begins to believe it
[2:16:30] everything you see hear smell touch and
[2:16:32] taste
[2:16:34] is either accepted or rejected by the
[2:16:36] conscious mind
[2:16:38] all the analysis takes place in the
[2:16:41] conscious mind well it has to get there
[2:16:44] and if you don't revisit it again it it
[2:16:47] floats away it goes away so really you
[2:16:50] have to somehow accept that
[2:16:52] for it ever to get deep enough
[2:16:55] for your brain to analyze it and that's
[2:16:58] why people are so mentally ill
[2:17:00] in this hour they're absolutely
[2:17:02] overloaded and burnt out with
[2:17:04] information without the holy ghost
[2:17:06] whatever is accepted i'm nearly done
[2:17:09] with this part
[2:17:10] whatever is accepted is then turned over
[2:17:13] to the subconscious mind which is then
[2:17:16] turned into action through the physical
[2:17:18] body so it works its way in and it works
[2:17:21] its way out
[2:17:22] you have a thought
[2:17:24] and along with the thought you have some
[2:17:25] kind of feeling or an emotion about it
[2:17:28] that thought gets planted into your
[2:17:30] subconscious along with that feeling
[2:17:33] which causes your body to feel a certain
[2:17:35] way resulting in a behavior that is in
[2:17:38] alignment with whatever you choose for
[2:17:40] your thoughts we keep thinking these
[2:17:42] same thoughts and keep getting the same
[2:17:44] results we end up going around and
[2:17:46] around and around and around instead of
[2:17:49] going ahead
[2:17:51] this is part of that great battlefield
[2:17:54] that's going on that great battle going
[2:17:56] on on the battlefield of the mind be
[2:17:58] careful what you think about
[2:18:00] because you become what you think about
[2:18:03] that's what the bible tells us
[2:18:05] we find that in the scripture
[2:18:07] i was amazed several years ago when we
[2:18:09] started studying all the things that
[2:18:11] brother branham said about the mind and
[2:18:13] we realized he was trying then to help
[2:18:15] us not to have to go through some of the
[2:18:17] things we go through in this hour are
[2:18:19] you good for a few more paragraphs
[2:18:21] your programming started before your
[2:18:23] birth
[2:18:25] and all of your behaviors are an
[2:18:27] expression of what's going on inside of
[2:18:28] you becoming aware is the key to
[2:18:31] changing your paradigm
[2:18:33] begin to relate to yourself as a
[2:18:35] conscious mind a subconscious mind and a
[2:18:37] body
[2:18:38] the next time you have a thought pay
[2:18:40] attention to the feeling that comes with
[2:18:42] it and the action that you take
[2:18:44] you will begin to notice things that you
[2:18:46] hadn't before and it will inspire you to
[2:18:49] start changing your paradigms
[2:18:54] one example is you can't eat just one
[2:18:56] laze
[2:19:03] that is a
[2:19:04] truth do you know anybody that goes and
[2:19:07] takes one laced potato chip out of the
[2:19:09] bag and then puts the bag away
[2:19:13] if you want to change the kind of
[2:19:14] results you have been getting so far
[2:19:16] throughout your life
[2:19:18] that stronghold that paradigm has to
[2:19:21] change
[2:19:23] repetition
[2:19:25] will input habits in the nerve cells in
[2:19:28] your brain this consequently governs
[2:19:31] your thoughts and behavior repetition
[2:19:34] now isn't it amazing that we stand back
[2:19:36] and allow the enemy to utilize
[2:19:39] the process of repetition
[2:19:41] to strengthen his hold in our mind
[2:19:44] and we fail to use the same process to
[2:19:48] deprogram
[2:19:50] what he tells us about ourselves
[2:19:53] it's repetition
[2:19:55] every time it is written
[2:19:57] it is written
[2:19:58] it is written it is written are you with
[2:20:01] me we have a few more minutes
[2:20:03] good i know this isn't fiery but it's
[2:20:05] all i had to bring
[2:20:06] it's what he led me to
[2:20:08] the petition of a believer in christ
[2:20:11] a paragraph 25
[2:20:15] this is an interesting place
[2:20:17] i was going to trim it down and i just
[2:20:18] couldn't
[2:20:19] he said i've seen people come to the
[2:20:22] platform
[2:20:23] and i'd say do you believe
[2:20:27] oh i've got all the faith brother
[2:20:29] branham
[2:20:35] now i don't mean to be belittling them
[2:20:38] i respect that
[2:20:40] but they're supposed to be up here
[2:20:42] and here they are way down here so we
[2:20:45] must be must be doing something with his
[2:20:46] hands
[2:20:48] but do you know what it is
[2:20:52] it's hope
[2:20:54] instead of
[2:20:56] faith here's somebody comes to be prayed
[2:20:59] for and you say do you have the faith to
[2:21:01] believe oh yes i've got the faith to
[2:21:03] believe
[2:21:04] brother braham said they're supposed to
[2:21:05] be up here but they're down here why
[2:21:07] because he said it's hope instead of
[2:21:09] faith let's read on
[2:21:12] faith does the job
[2:21:14] win
[2:21:16] right now
[2:21:17] hope hopes for it
[2:21:19] but faith is the product
[2:21:22] hallelujah
[2:21:23] anybody get it
[2:21:25] faith really does it see
[2:21:28] we have lots of hope
[2:21:30] but not much faith
[2:21:32] so we want to change from hope today
[2:21:36] to positive
[2:21:38] faith
[2:21:39] we're moving out of hope so
[2:21:42] to know so
[2:21:45] and we do that by moving into positive
[2:21:48] faith he tells us how to do it there's
[2:21:50] only one way we can get positive faith
[2:21:54] that's why you read it
[2:22:05] it matters what you think
[2:22:09] i'm not trying to be
[2:22:11] a mind over matter
[2:22:13] because that's actually a very strange
[2:22:15] concept
[2:22:17] and that's not what we're talking about
[2:22:19] today
[2:22:21] we're talking about faith
[2:22:23] over circumstances
[2:22:25] we're talking about moving from i hope
[2:22:28] so
[2:22:29] to a positive faith that says i know so
[2:22:33] and brother adam tells us we make that
[2:22:35] transition by positive thinking on
[2:22:37] positive things
[2:22:39] and i would say repeatedly
[2:22:41] because repetition as we have said many
[2:22:44] times is part of the key he said now for
[2:22:46] instance
[2:22:47] i was going to trim some of this out but
[2:22:49] i i couldn't i just couldn't
[2:22:51] he said now for instance what if some of
[2:22:53] you women today went home or tomorrow i
[2:22:56] wouldn't think you'd want to do it today
[2:22:58] but tomorrow you go out you go and plug
[2:23:01] up your device your electric iron
[2:23:04] to do your ironing and there's no
[2:23:07] current
[2:23:08] so let everybody know that brother
[2:23:10] bradham is giving you permission not to
[2:23:12] iron on sunday
[2:23:15] that would cause a major catastrophe at
[2:23:17] our house on sunday morning
[2:23:19] but he'd say i wouldn't think you'd want
[2:23:20] to go home today and
[2:23:22] and plug it but tomorrow you go and plug
[2:23:24] in your electric iron to do your ironing
[2:23:27] and there's no current what does it mean
[2:23:29] by current
[2:23:31] there's no electricity
[2:23:33] there's no power so he goes on
[2:23:37] now let's read on
[2:23:40] why would you throw why
[2:23:43] he's saying why why would you why would
[2:23:45] you throw your why would you throw up
[2:23:47] your hands and say alas and to lack
[2:23:52] there's no such thing as electricity
[2:23:56] well certainly not
[2:23:58] he said you've got your wires crossed up
[2:24:00] somewhere
[2:24:02] there's plenty of electricity
[2:24:05] you just haven't got it connected right
[2:24:09] i want you to hear that it's so simple
[2:24:15] you can't miss it unless you just choose
[2:24:18] to miss it
[2:24:20] you've got your wires crossed up
[2:24:21] somewhere it's not that you don't have
[2:24:23] electricity you just don't have it
[2:24:26] connected you haven't got it connected
[2:24:28] right is that right he said
[2:24:31] and we go on
[2:24:33] when this one was prayed and why why
[2:24:36] didn't you get healed and there's no
[2:24:38] such a thing as divine healing
[2:24:40] that's just as senseless as the other is
[2:24:43] surely others are getting healed why
[2:24:46] can't you see
[2:24:48] it's the wires breaks down
[2:24:52] it's not the fact that there's not power
[2:24:54] to heal there's plenty of power to heal
[2:24:58] something is not working right in the
[2:25:01] connection
[2:25:03] so he goes on let's read
[2:25:05] look
[2:25:06] that electricity
[2:25:09] the whole world is full of electricity
[2:25:11] did you know that
[2:25:12] you could go to new york city and pick
[2:25:14] up a copper wire and go to los angeles
[2:25:16] with a copper wire
[2:25:18] take a helicopter and fly it five miles
[2:25:20] high in the air and drop that copper
[2:25:22] wire and pick up enough electricity set
[2:25:24] the earth of fire with the current
[2:25:26] that's how much electricity there is in
[2:25:29] the earth sure
[2:25:31] now he goes on now if only the whole
[2:25:34] world was full of electricity and you're
[2:25:36] setting out in the middle of a big dark
[2:25:38] field at night time and you can't see
[2:25:41] where you're going and you're hollering
[2:25:43] oh
[2:25:44] electricity oh electricity come make a
[2:25:48] light for me
[2:25:51] is that too silly for you can you get it
[2:25:54] come make a light for me
[2:25:56] i know you can light but come make a
[2:25:59] light for me electricity
[2:26:01] i know you can get out of this dark
[2:26:03] place
[2:26:04] i know that you're here
[2:26:07] electricity
[2:26:09] science proves that you're here
[2:26:11] come make a light
[2:26:14] now you're just wasting your breath
[2:26:17] that's all
[2:26:18] now i know it's silly
[2:26:20] but see yourself sitting out in the
[2:26:22] middle of a field
[2:26:23] the air the atmosphere charged with
[2:26:25] electrical current
[2:26:26] and you're sitting there thinking now
[2:26:29] come electricity and make me a light
[2:26:32] you don't have the copper wire you don't
[2:26:34] have the lamp you don't have the light
[2:26:36] bulb you don't have the plug but you
[2:26:38] know electricity is real so you're
[2:26:40] sitting science has proven it and so
[2:26:42] forth and etc you're just wasting your
[2:26:45] breath that's all now let's read on he
[2:26:47] said now if that electricity will light
[2:26:49] up
[2:26:50] if you will get the electricity in the
[2:26:53] right flow of its category it'll light
[2:26:56] up if you put it in its right position
[2:27:00] there are some other things needed to be
[2:27:02] able to make connection with that
[2:27:04] electricity
[2:27:06] all right he goes on now the whole room
[2:27:08] here the whole earth the whole room here
[2:27:10] is full of the power of god
[2:27:12] same way
[2:27:14] enough to make this voice sitting here
[2:27:16] in the wheelchair walk
[2:27:17] make this woman walk make this lady in
[2:27:20] the stretcher walk make all these people
[2:27:22] along here walk make the blind see
[2:27:26] but the first thing you have to do is
[2:27:28] get that holy spirit flowing in the
[2:27:31] right category
[2:27:33] do you believe it's here
[2:27:36] isn't that powerful
[2:27:39] it's the same way you've got to make the
[2:27:41] connection
[2:27:43] the power of god can be flowing through
[2:27:45] this room as he has been in such a
[2:27:47] special way lately and you can sit there
[2:27:51] without any touch at all
[2:27:54] it doesn't mean that he's not here
[2:27:57] i know people that go out of a service
[2:27:59] like that where they have made no effort
[2:28:03] and they say oh just a bunch of just a
[2:28:05] bunch of emotion just a bunch of hocus
[2:28:06] pocus just a bunch of oh no
[2:28:09] no the room was full of electricity and
[2:28:12] you were thinking that maybe it would
[2:28:13] just come and make you a light but it
[2:28:15] didn't just come and make you a light
[2:28:17] because there's a way to make connection
[2:28:19] with electricity you didn't have the
[2:28:21] copper wire you didn't have the plug you
[2:28:24] didn't have what was necessary you
[2:28:25] didn't utilize what you know so the
[2:28:27] power of god can fill this room but in
[2:28:30] order for you to be a partaker and a
[2:28:32] participant and a recipient of that
[2:28:35] power you've got to get it flowing in
[2:28:37] the right category which means you've
[2:28:40] got to take it as it is and understand
[2:28:42] that faith is what makes the connection
[2:28:45] and he said well how do we get that
[2:28:47] faith by by by moving from hope
[2:28:51] to positive faith
[2:28:53] how do we move from hope to positive
[2:28:55] faith by by thinking positive thoughts
[2:29:01] it's a choice
[2:29:02] are you here
[2:29:04] in a message jesus christ the same
[2:29:06] yesterday today and forever paragraph 34
[2:29:13] lay your hands on the baby
[2:29:16] some christian believer come lay your
[2:29:18] hands on the young man sitting there
[2:29:20] that's crippled will you all right now
[2:29:22] let's everyone bow our heads reverently
[2:29:24] real reverent
[2:29:26] i want you to repeat this prayer
[2:29:29] now you heard what brother branham just
[2:29:30] did he's setting setting something up
[2:29:33] he said i want you to think this in your
[2:29:35] mind now real reverend is that mind
[2:29:38] control
[2:29:41] is brother branham trying to use mind
[2:29:43] control
[2:29:45] neither is the preacher when he's
[2:29:46] telling you to only believe
[2:29:49] he said i want you to think this in your
[2:29:50] mind now real reverent i want you to
[2:29:52] repeat this in prayer you pray it now
[2:29:55] watch this he said i'll repeat it you
[2:29:58] pray it
[2:30:00] i'll just transfer the words
[2:30:05] i'll just transfer the words that it
[2:30:07] takes to defeat satan right to your lips
[2:30:14] it's powerful
[2:30:16] i know what you're thinking you're
[2:30:17] thinking that
[2:30:18] the most glorious
[2:30:22] powerful prayer you have ever heard in
[2:30:24] your life is about to follow
[2:30:28] and it is so powerful
[2:30:31] that every person in the room is healed
[2:30:32] and every demon has to go and so forth
[2:30:35] and it's going to be so beautiful that
[2:30:37] it could almost be included in a book of
[2:30:39] poetry
[2:30:41] but none of that is what this is about
[2:30:46] he said i'll just transfer the words
[2:30:48] that it takes to defeat satan right to
[2:30:50] your lips and then you believe your
[2:30:52] confession
[2:30:54] i'm just going to teach you how to pray
[2:30:56] and then you believe what you've what
[2:30:58] you've confessed you believe what you
[2:31:00] prayed
[2:31:01] not mind control not trying to put words
[2:31:04] in people's mouth he's trying to show
[2:31:05] you the simplicity
[2:31:07] it's not the words you say it's whether
[2:31:09] you believe them or not
[2:31:11] he said now now now you that's sick
[2:31:14] repeat this with me
[2:31:18] almighty god
[2:31:21] creator of heavens and earth
[2:31:24] author of everlasting life
[2:31:27] giver of all good gifts i your servant
[2:31:30] confess my sins
[2:31:33] and i believe that through the merits of
[2:31:36] thy son jesus i am forgiven of my sins
[2:31:40] i am sick in body
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:44] i need your help
[2:31:46] give me faith just now to believe your
[2:31:49] word and to believe these things which i
[2:31:52] have never seen tonight that reproduces
[2:31:54] your life again as it was yesterday and
[2:31:58] so is it today
[2:32:02] and now lord
[2:32:05] upon this confession
[2:32:08] i accept my healing
[2:32:10] and i believe from this night henceforth
[2:32:13] i shall be well
[2:32:15] i commit myself to you
[2:32:17] in the name of jesus christ
[2:32:20] period
[2:32:28] it's not how grandiose the words are
[2:32:32] how beautiful the structure is
[2:32:34] it's whether or not you can believe what
[2:32:36] you say it's whether you can really
[2:32:39] believe what you confess
[2:32:41] and brother branham said i know there
[2:32:43] are people here in his mind he's
[2:32:44] thinking i know there are people here
[2:32:45] that don't even know how to put a little
[2:32:47] prayer together like that so i'm going
[2:32:48] to give them just a little example he
[2:32:50] was doing that under inspiration wasn't
[2:32:52] premeditated i'm going to give them a
[2:32:54] little example of what to say in fact
[2:32:56] i'm going to transfer to them the words
[2:32:58] they need to defeat satan well i don't
[2:33:00] hear him say anything in there now satan
[2:33:04] come out
[2:33:06] now satan you go to town
[2:33:09] you go back to hell where you come from
[2:33:11] he doesn't even address satan
[2:33:15] he didn't find it necessary to teach the
[2:33:17] people how to talk to the devil
[2:33:21] he found out if i can just teach them
[2:33:23] how to talk to god and how to believe
[2:33:25] what they say
[2:33:27] [Music]
[2:33:28] then satan has no choice
[2:33:32] but to go
[2:33:34] you didn't even have to tell him to go
[2:33:37] he'll never hang around where somebody
[2:33:40] is believing and confessing and
[2:33:43] utilizing god's word like that from this
[2:33:46] day forward i'm committing myself now
[2:33:49] brother shelley it couldn't possibly be
[2:33:51] that simple
[2:33:55] he thought it was
[2:33:59] paragraph 19 of jesus christ the same
[2:34:01] yesterday today and forever but this
[2:34:03] time in tucson
[2:34:05] that was in tallahassee
[2:34:08] we're nearly done
[2:34:11] he said did you ever see people you love
[2:34:13] to be around just love to be around them
[2:34:16] because they create an atmosphere
[2:34:18] because they uh a heavenly
[2:34:20] and you like to be around them others
[2:34:22] seem to be good people
[2:34:24] but you just i i have to get away once
[2:34:26] in a while
[2:34:27] that
[2:34:28] you know what i mean
[2:34:30] it's very quiet in here
[2:34:32] but you know what he means
[2:34:35] and yet they seem to be good people
[2:34:38] it's not creative
[2:34:45] i could try to replace that word
[2:34:50] he could have meant conducive
[2:34:55] he could have meant a lot of things
[2:35:00] but he chose the word
[2:35:02] creative
[2:35:03] was it a mistake
[2:35:11] i don't think so
[2:35:14] because when i look at this paragraph
[2:35:16] carefully
[2:35:18] it's all about atmosphere
[2:35:21] an atmosphere can be destructive
[2:35:25] there can be an there can be an
[2:35:26] atmosphere conducive
[2:35:28] to tear down and destroy
[2:35:30] there can be an atmosphere that's
[2:35:32] conducive for building up and being and
[2:35:33] creating
[2:35:35] we know that the power of the spoken
[2:35:37] word when you can speak it and believe
[2:35:39] what you say
[2:35:40] it is creative isn't it
[2:35:42] so i don't think brother branham was
[2:35:44] using the wrong word he's just
[2:35:46] explaining that you can be with certain
[2:35:48] people and there's a creative atmosphere
[2:35:50] that can be that can be developed in
[2:35:52] being with them all good people there
[2:35:54] are other people good people
[2:35:57] but when you're with them you just
[2:35:58] really would like to be away from them
[2:36:01] because they put off now today we might
[2:36:03] call it a vibe
[2:36:06] we might call it all kinds of things but
[2:36:08] the truth is the atmosphere is not right
[2:36:11] because the focus is not right
[2:36:15] and because sometimes as i have said
[2:36:17] many times before people find their
[2:36:20] identity in their suffering
[2:36:22] so if they can't explain their suffering
[2:36:24] to you
[2:36:26] if they can't talk all the time about
[2:36:29] what they're going through
[2:36:31] they have nothing to say
[2:36:34] and there's not a lot of faith that is
[2:36:36] produced in that kind of an atmosphere
[2:36:39] so i had almost rather be with people
[2:36:42] sometime who speak nothing about the
[2:36:44] lord
[2:36:48] than to be around people who speak of
[2:36:51] the lord
[2:36:53] but in such a negative way
[2:36:55] there is no created faith
[2:36:58] come on
[2:37:01] i'm just
[2:37:02] telling you like it like it is
[2:37:05] it's not creative
[2:37:07] now watch what he says next
[2:37:09] and man
[2:37:10] was made to be a god
[2:37:14] he said we know that genesis 1 26 he had
[2:37:17] dominion over the whole earth and he was
[2:37:19] made to be an amateur god
[2:37:23] and now when he receives god
[2:37:25] he becomes
[2:37:28] a son of god
[2:37:30] again now listen before we go on just a
[2:37:32] minute
[2:37:33] god is a creator
[2:37:35] so he goes from speaking about creative
[2:37:38] to immediately speaking about how man
[2:37:41] was created to be a lesser
[2:37:44] or an amateur god
[2:37:46] in other places brother branham said and
[2:37:49] therefore a creator
[2:37:52] we are
[2:37:53] creators
[2:37:55] we do have some power
[2:37:57] to create
[2:37:59] because we're in him
[2:38:01] all right let's
[2:38:02] let's read on
[2:38:05] he was made man in the image of god god
[2:38:08] had hands god had feet
[2:38:10] and so therefore a man was made like him
[2:38:13] so he is an amateur god but sin has
[2:38:17] blinded every fiber in his body in his
[2:38:21] mind in his heart but now don't never
[2:38:24] try to study it out you cannot figure it
[2:38:29] out
[2:38:31] powerful isn't it
[2:38:32] you cannot figure it out in the garden
[2:38:36] of eden
[2:38:39] satan chose his part of the man
[2:38:42] his head
[2:38:43] his intellectuals
[2:38:45] god took his heart
[2:38:53] satan has access
[2:38:55] as long as you are in your head
[2:39:00] as long as you are in your head as long
[2:39:04] as you are in your mind
[2:39:06] satan has chosen your mind he has chosen
[2:39:10] your heart as his part god has allowed
[2:39:14] the enemy to have access
[2:39:18] to that part of who you are
[2:39:20] that's why the battle is raging
[2:39:23] what i just said was clearly outlined in
[2:39:25] the greatest battle ever fought just go
[2:39:27] hear it again it's there that's exactly
[2:39:29] what he was telling us
[2:39:32] god has allowed the enemy to have access
[2:39:36] to man
[2:39:37] and it is through his head it is through
[2:39:39] his mind
[2:39:41] god chose his heart
[2:39:43] the intellectuals will reason
[2:39:47] he said well well i'm this way i'm that
[2:39:49] way you'll never get anywhere
[2:39:52] with god
[2:39:53] there
[2:39:55] let's read on just a bit but your heart
[2:39:57] your faith will make you believe things
[2:40:03] your faith will make you believe things
[2:40:05] at your heart excuse me
[2:40:07] your faith will make you believe things
[2:40:09] that your mind knows nothing about
[2:40:14] that's why you've got to think with your
[2:40:16] heart
[2:40:18] which is his mind
[2:40:20] [Applause]
[2:40:21] and not your head
[2:40:23] which is satan's access
[2:40:25] you you your your faith will make you
[2:40:28] believe things that your mind knows
[2:40:30] nothing about you cast down reasoning
[2:40:32] see you must be positive and you stay
[2:40:35] there until you are positive then when
[2:40:38] you're positive there's nothing can turn
[2:40:42] you does anybody believe that to be the
[2:40:44] truth and and get what's the title of
[2:40:46] the message jesus christ the same
[2:40:48] yesterday today and forever
[2:40:50] his favorite scripture a message that he
[2:40:52] preaches over and over again just about
[2:40:53] everywhere he goes he uses that theme
[2:40:56] because this is one of the ways that we
[2:40:57] can understand that jesus remains the
[2:41:00] same the enemy has access to our
[2:41:02] thoughts as long as we stay in our head
[2:41:05] but when we take on another head when we
[2:41:07] take on another mind
[2:41:10] when we take on the mind of christ the
[2:41:12] access that the enemy has is to be
[2:41:16] closed
[2:41:18] so if he continues to access our mind
[2:41:21] it's because we are vacillating
[2:41:26] between heart and head
[2:41:30] we are going back and forth
[2:41:33] between
[2:41:34] my head his head
[2:41:36] my mind his mind
[2:41:39] my head
[2:41:41] his heart
[2:41:42] back and forth moving back and forth
[2:41:46] we have we've got to get victory over
[2:41:47] that i'm getting victory i'm going to
[2:41:49] have victory over that i see victory as
[2:41:51] promised to me
[2:41:53] in this and i'm going to take a hold of
[2:41:54] him you'll never get anywhere now he
[2:41:57] goes on
[2:41:58] bless your heart
[2:42:00] your faith will make you believe things
[2:42:01] your mind knows nothing about you cast
[2:42:03] down reasoning see you must be positive
[2:42:05] you stay there until you're positive
[2:42:07] then when you're positive there's
[2:42:09] nothing can turn you
[2:42:12] give me this verse of scripture
[2:42:14] musicians are coming
[2:42:16] first corinthians 2 16.
[2:42:20] ah
[2:42:23] for who
[2:42:24] hath known
[2:42:26] the mind of the lord
[2:42:29] that he may
[2:42:30] instruct him
[2:42:33] but we
[2:42:34] have i gave you this from this morning
[2:42:36] this was there we go that was from this
[2:42:38] morning
[2:42:39] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[2:42:42] that he may instruct him but we
[2:42:47] have
[2:42:50] the mind
[2:42:51] of christ
[2:42:54] me philippians 2 5 let
[2:42:56] this
[2:42:57] mind
[2:42:59] be
[2:43:00] in you
[2:43:01] which was also
[2:43:04] in
[2:43:05] christ
[2:43:06] jesus philippians 2 5
[2:43:09] and now give me god commissioning moses
[2:43:12] paragraph 6
[2:43:14] and i'm done
[2:43:16] i don't know why i wore myself out i
[2:43:18] haven't preached very hard
[2:43:20] but i've been pulling
[2:43:22] me and you both
[2:43:24] and when a man becomes born again of the
[2:43:28] spirit of god
[2:43:30] let me ask you again how many of you are
[2:43:32] born again how many of you on the stream
[2:43:34] are born again if you're born again put
[2:43:36] your hand up
[2:43:37] i'm born again i'm born from above i'm
[2:43:40] born of the spirit
[2:43:41] i didn't ask you how you feel i ask you
[2:43:43] where your faith is have you asked him
[2:43:46] have you repented have you been baptized
[2:43:48] in his name have you received the holy
[2:43:50] spirit of god
[2:43:52] then you're born again
[2:43:54] he said
[2:43:55] when a man becomes born again of the
[2:43:57] spirit of god he becomes an offspring or
[2:43:59] a son of god
[2:44:01] and then he has the same type of mind
[2:44:05] that god does
[2:44:11] don't you dare tell me that satan has
[2:44:14] access
[2:44:15] to the mind of god
[2:44:19] only a prophet
[2:44:21] had access
[2:44:23] to the mind of god
[2:44:25] now a generation of believers
[2:44:29] have access to the mind of god how is
[2:44:32] that so because somebody went before us
[2:44:36] because we had a forerunner
[2:44:39] don't tell me that satan has access to
[2:44:43] the mind of god
[2:44:45] he may have access to my head
[2:44:48] to my mind but he doesn't have access to
[2:44:51] his mind so have you lost your mind
[2:44:57] because if he's still accessing your
[2:44:59] mind you are not out of your mind
[2:45:04] you're living in your mind
[2:45:06] true scripture says we have the mind of
[2:45:09] christ let this mind be in you
[2:45:12] that was also in christ jesus
[2:45:14] he said now and then he has the same
[2:45:17] type of mind that god does the mind that
[2:45:19] was in christ
[2:45:22] is in us
[2:45:24] and we believe are you going to let me
[2:45:25] read the rest thank you and we believe
[2:45:28] for the unseen for the miraculous in
[2:45:30] just anything and then we have the holy
[2:45:33] spirit who bring comes to us and speaks
[2:45:35] to us concerning these things and the
[2:45:36] whole purpose of these meetings listen
[2:45:38] to what the purpose of these meetings
[2:45:39] are the whole purpose of these meetings
[2:45:41] dear christian friend it's for no other
[2:45:43] purpose before god but that your faith
[2:45:45] in god might be stimulated to a place
[2:45:48] that you believe him for the salvation
[2:45:50] of your soul and for the healing of your
[2:45:52] body all of this all of this you see he
[2:45:55] said is to get you to put your faith in
[2:45:57] the right place so your soul can be
[2:45:59] saved and your body can be healed my
[2:46:01] that's a that's a great summary of a
[2:46:03] powerful ministry isn't it good i'm
[2:46:05] going to read one more i wasn't but i am
[2:46:08] fundamental foundation of faith
[2:46:10] paragraph 14.
[2:46:12] now if we could throw ourselves
[2:46:14] completely to god and to his will and be
[2:46:17] lost to our own thoughts
[2:46:20] and just let the mind of christ being us
[2:46:23] the one that satan has no access to
[2:46:30] when we see him coming
[2:46:32] when we hear his thoughts
[2:46:35] when we realize he's trying to get in
[2:46:37] our head we have to make a conscious
[2:46:39] decision and we have to do it
[2:46:40] immediately we have to put him in his
[2:46:42] place we have to flip the switch we have
[2:46:45] to say oh no
[2:46:47] i can't stay in my head
[2:46:49] i got to move up into his isn't that
[2:46:52] what brother branham said just a moment
[2:46:53] ago when he said
[2:46:54] you're here
[2:46:56] you need to be up here
[2:46:57] there it is that's it
[2:47:00] you're down here just thinking like an
[2:47:02] ordinary human being
[2:47:04] you're going to have to come up here and
[2:47:05] think like who you were created to be
[2:47:07] which is an amateur god
[2:47:09] let me tell you something an amateur god
[2:47:12] is not somebody that sits down and rings
[2:47:15] their hands and says i'm stuck with my
[2:47:18] life
[2:47:20] this is all i have i i
[2:47:22] this is terrible this is awful this is
[2:47:25] painful and it may be but an amateur god
[2:47:28] cannot waste any time
[2:47:32] anybody with me
[2:47:33] in that kind of desperation and
[2:47:35] despondency
[2:47:36] you got to get up above that
[2:47:38] now what would an amateur god do
[2:47:40] an amateur god would create
[2:47:48] i don't know why everybody's so quiet
[2:47:53] i mean i'm doing all the things you're
[2:47:55] supposed to do when you preach a message
[2:47:56] i'm putting the word amateur in there so
[2:47:58] everybody can hear it
[2:48:02] because
[2:48:03] sometimes he didn't sometimes he didn't
[2:48:07] but i'm trying to do all that so nobody
[2:48:10] gets throwed off
[2:48:12] but if you were created to be an amateur
[2:48:14] god it means you have been given some
[2:48:17] authority and power to create
[2:48:20] that's why you've got to be around
[2:48:22] people
[2:48:25] who can help you
[2:48:27] have an atmosphere
[2:48:29] to create
[2:48:31] to be creative
[2:48:33] you can't live your life around
[2:48:37] negative nancy
[2:48:42] pulled down constantly all the time
[2:48:44] somebody said you want us just to
[2:48:46] forsake people like that no we want you
[2:48:48] to pull away get filled with the holy
[2:48:51] ghost and then go back and try to rescue
[2:48:54] them
[2:48:56] we want you to get so full of god
[2:48:59] get out from under that influence
[2:49:02] get so full of god get so much power get
[2:49:05] so much authority and then go back into
[2:49:08] the house of hell
[2:49:11] go back into those bars
[2:49:14] you ought to listen to your pastor
[2:49:17] then go do something with those bars
[2:49:20] brother david gossman
[2:49:22] then we have to do something with those
[2:49:23] bars
[2:49:28] brother branham was told something had
[2:49:30] to be done
[2:49:31] he sees these people being held captive
[2:49:34] good people that he knew he looks down
[2:49:36] at his little scrawny arms
[2:49:39] am i going to do anything
[2:49:41] how am i going to do anything
[2:49:44] that's how we get sometime
[2:49:46] oh but it wasn't those little arms that
[2:49:48] was going to pull those bars out of the
[2:49:49] way and set somebody free it was going
[2:49:52] to be it was going to be someone who
[2:49:54] learned to exercise the authority that
[2:49:56] was given to him by god
[2:49:58] once you learn how to experience that
[2:50:01] authority and how to manifest what god
[2:50:04] is calling you to do don't you forget
[2:50:07] those people
[2:50:10] that are still caught behind those bars
[2:50:13] you go take some authority to them and
[2:50:16] help create an atmosphere around them so
[2:50:18] that they can pull themselves up just
[2:50:20] like you had to pull yourself up but
[2:50:23] don't sacrifice your soul
[2:50:26] hear what i'm saying today don't you
[2:50:29] allow that spirit to be strengthened on
[2:50:32] you until you can't get it off of
[2:50:35] yourself
[2:50:37] come and see what god will do
[2:50:47] i hope your silence means you're
[2:50:48] listening
[2:50:55] we could just throw ourselves completely
[2:50:57] to god into his will and be lost to our
[2:50:59] own thoughts and just let the mind of
[2:51:01] christ be in us them same operations of
[2:51:04] the spirit would work through us just as
[2:51:07] the natural things does just the same
[2:51:09] thing because we were created
[2:51:12] we were first created for that purpose
[2:51:16] we were first created for that purpose
[2:51:20] to control to rule to praise god and to
[2:51:25] live for
[2:51:27] god
[2:51:27] [Music]
[2:51:29] now jesus said if you abide in me and my
[2:51:31] words abide in you you can ask what you
[2:51:33] will and shall be given unto you if you
[2:51:35] abide in me and my word about in you he
[2:51:37] said now the father in his word is
[2:51:38] inseparable because the word is his son
[2:51:41] in the beginning was the word the word
[2:51:43] was with god the word was god the word
[2:51:45] was made flesh and dwelt among us god
[2:51:47] and his word is inseparable
[2:51:50] you cannot have god without having his
[2:51:52] word and when you have his word
[2:52:00] you have god
[2:52:03] paragraph 19
[2:52:05] same message jesus christ the same
[2:52:06] yesterday today and forever but this
[2:52:08] time campbellsville kentucky i'm
[2:52:10] skipping all the way down to the last
[2:52:11] paragraph the one that would be in

[2:52:15] the mind that was in christ jesus be in
[2:52:18] you
[2:52:20] and then when you begin to think his
[2:52:22] thoughts you'll begin to live his life
[2:52:25] and do the things that he did see what i
[2:52:27] mean now because it's not you
