means salvation and I said that all May be true but I guarantee you he answers it it's not how you pronounce it it's not how you put the syllables together it's your heart that that he he responds to

[Music] sweet oh [Applause] [Music] woo I believe I don't worship Angels but I believe in angels I'll tell you brother Brandon believed in angels He did I I think that we we printed one time we printed I think there were over 1100 100 pages of quotations where brother brandom talked about angels and you know one of the things he said about him he said you don't you don't have them you don't see them you don't sense them because you don't believe in them well I thought I'm going to just start believing in them and see if I can sense them coming in sometime you'll be surprised what'll happen to you if you'll start out walking on a supernatural Highway God is a supernatural God if you believe that say Amen amen I want us to thank the Lord for these musicians tonight the leading of the [Applause] worship Benjamin is my oldest son and he gets the same criticism that I used to get 30 years ago 30 years ago when I would sing they'd always asked me to sing wherever I went and and there would always be some in the crowd where he's just kind of putting on a show well I want to tell you something how that started I started singing in the church when my grandmother was still a pastor and she had a big old Gibson guitar with a long neck on it and she played the guitar and sung and one time she asked me to come and sing a song and I was just about that tall and I got up to sing and I wasn't putting enough in it she said you were just singing the words you didn't feel that you weren't trying to even identify with the words that's what she told me later there was no explanation at the time she just dipped the neck of that guitar back like that and whopped me right on the back of the head right in the service and I looked at her like big mama what in what is going on she said if you're going to do it for Jesus do every do it with everything you got or don't do it at all so sometimes people misunderstand and they think we're doing it for a show no we're doing it and putting everything we've got into it Hallelujah I'm not a sports fan but if I was I'd be one of the best I'm not a big football fan baseball basketball but if I was I'd be a fanatic yes sir because I wouldn't do anything I would go put my whole heart into it my whole energy into it we should serve God with all the strength that we have we should worship him we should praise him with all the strength that we have if you believe that say amen amen well God is good remain standing I want to take a text this evening I am a poor substitute for brother Dwayne Jackson he wanted to be here he was scheduled to be here this evening along with sister Heather and family and while we were away for Thanksgiving they had a little complication with sister Heather's pregnancy and the doctors felt like it was a good idea to stay in close proximity of the hospital and so while we were out one night uh on our holiday brother Dwayne called he said it's a hard call to make brother Shelly I I've only been preaching now for certain amount of time but he said I've I've never had to call a preacher and tell him couldn't come but it just don't look like it's going to work out we've already heard from them today their hearts are with us they would love to be here I'm believing that the Lord will make a way and he can come to our first uh weekend of February meetings it's in the Lord's hands and maybe bring baby girl with them you know and and we'll get to meet her quick I'm looking forward to that but uh it it it's my responsibility tonight to give you something and I believe I've I have something for you may be a little different but it's okay we had wonderful Fellowship today we're so thankful for the facility that we were able to get Philadelphia Baptist Church we have a different facility tomorrow for Fellowship but we're just thankful that that churches are willing to help us out and let us come in with just a a minimal amount of rent just for little expense utility or something they're willing and we need it today and we we had a great crowd today and we're going to have a wonderful time of of Fellowship this evening and a meal and come back tomorrow and do it all over again so I need you to pull on the word tonight so that we can get her done and not have to take all night to get her done you know brother Smith they didn't mention uh he he just I started to yell it out but I I'm bad to do that but that man's a miracle he's a walking Miracle you all were praying for him you all prayed for him and God heard everybody they were probably praying lots of places but God heard the prayer and raised him up nearly from the dead in the hospital give up and you know he's here tonight to praise God I saw him out in the aisle I'd be out in the aisle too I'd be thanking God for a few extra days on this planet with my family God is good he's the same yesterday today and forever Luke chapter 19 let's go there uh we want to welcome all of you what a host of people are streaming tonight we want to welcome every one of you who are watching us on Facebook YouTube uh revival. org website and also the app God bless you you are not here with us in body but you're here with us in spirit your amens may not be heard in this house but they reverberate through their atmosphere I believe that with all my heart and and you're not saying amen for the preacher to hear you only you're saying amen because you're saying so be it to the word of God claiming and believing every promise for yourself Luke chapter 19 and verse 28 and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to Jerusalem and it came to pass when he was come nigh to Beth and Beth at the mount called the Mount of Olives he sent two of his disciples saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering you shall find a Colt tied whereon yet never manat loose him and bring him hither and if any man ask you why do you loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the Lord hath need of him and they that that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them and as they were loosing the colat the owners thereof said unto them why loose she the colt and they said the Lord adoni hath need of him and they brought him to Jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set Jesus thereon and as he went they spread their clothes in the way they took off their outer garments they took off their rain slickers they took off their their their overcoats whatever they had those outer tunics and they began to lay it in the path for the Lord's donkey to walk on and when he was come nigh even now at The Descent of the Mount of Olives and you know I stood stood right in the very area where this took place the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God it's getting too loud in here tonight they praise God with a loud voice a and what provoked them to do such a thing for all the mighty works you know why I'm going to praise him with a loud voice because these 48 years I've served him and taken his gospel around the world I've seen Mighty Works done in his name and if anybody ever had a right to praise God the Bride of Jesus Christ ought to step up and take our rights to praise him it's we're not after leodan rights we're not after the people's rights we're after the rights that are given to the children of God I heard brother Brandon say today that the first church was a church full of Power full of Holy Ghost and he said the last church is going to be exactly like the first church I know it I don't just believe it I know it for they uh all began with a loud voice some to praise God for the mighty works that they had seen let's get the rest of these verses in saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord baruk bashem bar bashem blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven Shalom and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisee oh yes oh yes I know you're standing some of the Pharisees I got up today and explained excuse me just a moment I'm about to choke to death uh I got up and explained today that that in in the in the effort of getting everything over to the church Hall we didn't get the gloves well in in my day nobody use gloves that's just some carryover from covid everybody just washed their hands with soap and water and picked up the chicken and put it on my plate yeah I guarantee you Granny didn't wear gloves when she throwed the biscuits around the table but my wife said you tell everybody that they're going to serve they don't have gloves they washed their hands and clean real good and I said if there are any Pharisees here we'll talk after it's over and we'll explain to you and and there's always going to be a Pharisee around somebody's going to say oh the the tongues was longer than the interpretation come on there's always going to be a Pharisee around to say that was too loud that was too much that was over the top come on now there always going to be a Pharisee around you can just you know you can just count on it religious Spirits are abounding everywhere uh uh even more so I think around the message than anywhere I've ever had any fellowship with and some of the Pharisees there among the multitude said unto him Pastor rebuke thy disciples call them back into church order make sure they hear that tape again and he answered and said unto them I tell you that go ahead if these should hold their peace the stones the very rocks on the ground would rise up and begin to cry out blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord I don't want no stone taking my place I don't want no Rock crying out for me as long as I've got breath I'm going to cry out as long as I've got life I'm going to give God praise in the good times I'm going to praise him in the bad times I'm going to praise him and it doesn't matter if it hair lips the devil or bankrupts hell I'm going to praise the Lord anyhow I'm not performing for the devil I'm going to lift up the name above every name and I adure you to do the same father bless now the reading of your word and help us as we study tonight uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray bash Adonai Yeshua hamashiach amen and the Saints said you may be seated oh don't get quiet yet in a message thirst I'm I'm a I I don't want to disappoint anybody so I threw in i a couple of quotations some of you are familiar with these I use quotes almost every service but there are some services that I don't and I don't think it's always necessary what gets on my nerves is when I hear preachers say uh something like this brother brandham said for God so love the world or or or they'll say brother Brandon and they'll quote another scripture how many of you know that you don't have to give brother brandom credit for what the Bible says you see there seems to be some confusion Among Us of what the absolute is but he had no confusion he held up the Bible he said it's got to line up with this if it doesn't line up with this you got to leave it alone don't try to figure it out am just put it on a shelf and let God interpret you know what God interprets his word by bringing it to pass to pass he doesn't need you and I to interpret he knows how to perform it he knows how to do it anybody with me tonight good he said wait till that satisfaction comes some people are restless they don't ever seem to be satisfied but the prophet said wait till that satisfaction comes the satisfaction portion yeah of the fullness somebody Say fullness fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in wait till the fullness comes in amen and then [Music] these we better check the dat 65 seals are open come on mystery revealed and brother brandom is still telling us when the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in then then somebody say then then these Joy bells of shouting I thought that was all just Pentecostal F but not according to brother random here he said when the real fullness of the Holy Spirit the satisfying portion is anybody got a satisfying portion that doesn't mean you won't ever hunger anymore it means once you get the real nothing but the real will ever satisfy you stay with me now he said then these Joy bells of shouting and speak speak amen I need water speaking in tongues hallu I thought all that was finished I I I I thought that once the revelation of the word came all these gifts were done away with then why is brother brandham telling us in in September of 1965 that we still have to have the satisfying portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit and when it comes in it'll bring the joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and [Applause] and I hope you that are checking me out I hope you'll find that it says the same thing on your phone that it says up here amen dancing in the spirit dancing in the spirit I thought that was Pentecostal F I thought that was for babes I thought we are beyond that isn't that what I've heard for about 30 years now we're beyond that we now have the word then why do we hear Brother brandom telling us in 65 we've got to have the reality of the satisfying portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit and when he comes there will be Joy bells of shouting and speaking in tongues and dancing in the spirit [Applause] will come Benny says you won't have to do it by the music and that is absolutely 100% correct you won't have to have the music playing to dance there's nothing wrong with dancing in the spirit while the music is playing but if that's the inspiration if the beat of the drum or the trill of the piano it's your inspiration for dancing you're just putting on a show but if the holy spirit is moving over you and you don't yield to the Holy Spirit you're in Rebellion against God to sit there on the Pew and not yield yourself to the Holy Spirit you're worse than a disobedient child we're operating in witchcraft around this message sometime come on come on why because the Bible said stubborn spirit stubborn Spirit I'm not going to be mov and then sometimes they get this attitude I'm not going to get happy cuz they do we're not your enemy we're your [Music] brother don't don't resist because we go overboard you keep it right between the you keep it right between the ditches is walk in the middle of the road if you see some excess if you see somebody getting a little carried away don't you get distracted by that don't you get your eyes on somebody else and whatever you do don't judge nobody else's praise cuz brother brandom said gone he said done gone you blasphemed the Holy Ghost now that's dangerous business so if somebody comes twisting by you and you don't think that it's just right close your eyes turn your head the other way don't you let a thought come to your mind against that because you first of all you don't know what that brother's been through I don't want to bring any attention to this but I saw a brother back there praising the Lord with his hands up when just a few weeks ago he laid his wife to rest he is raising nine children and I want you to know he didn't come today to Fellowship all broken down he didn't come with a sad sour look on his face he come in smiling when I greeted him he greeted me with the biggest smile you've just about ever seen and when I look back he was praising the Lord let me tell you something we're not praising God because everything always goes just right or we feel good or we don't have an ache or we don't have a we're praising him because he's worthy somebody ought to help me he's worthy well it makes me nervous when everybody starts doing that you're in bad shape amen you either need a pill or a prayer line if you're so nervous at somebody getting a little excited in the spirit is going to throw you into the despairs of anxiety something's terribly wrong with with your your Revelation something is terribly wrong with your experience get your eyes off of one another get your eyes on Jesus worship is not a performance praise is not a performance it's a sincere relationship between you and God and and don't you find yourself moving because the music is moving you find yourself moving because the spirit is moving 30 years ago they blackballed this ministry because we had drums on now and guess what about 65 70% of them now have drums I'm waiting on a phone call I'm waiting on somebody to say I'm sorry brother Steve that we ran you down all over the world because you had drums we have now decided that it's okay to have drums come on you know why they don't call because in the same con convers Sation they would have to say and uh I'm sorry I'm sorry I left you out there alone all alone sometime you feel because we took the Christmas tree back in and you wouldn't do it and I left you out there by yourself somebody said aren't you getting a little carried away tonight I'm going to I'm going to you people are the responsible for it it's your fault because you came in here tonight and you wasn't worried about Pharisees I didn't see nobody watching the camera to make sure they weren't on stream I saw you with the sincerest praise you were creating an atmosphere Hallelujah that's good enough to make an Amish man [Applause] jump they're trying to figure out all over over social media they're trying to figure this bunch out said they all had buns I noticed they all had buns but some of them are dressed like menites and some of them are dressed like Amish and some of them are dressed like English and and and and I don't know in fact I got a an inbox today they said I I'm I can't eat I can't sleep said I've got to know what denomination you are you see what people got to put in a box got to find a box to stuff it in let me tell you the Holy Ghost will outgrow your box he'll break out of your box Hallelujah he'll show up and he'll show out when there's a people that want to praise him and you came in here tonight to praise him and you brought an atmosphere that's made it easy to operate in the spirit because you wanted to praise God joy unspeakable come on he goes on to say uh what's the next part you you will do it when you're going down the road nobody to criticize you then somebody say well I don't want to get too excited while I'm driving going down the road I don't want to get to shouting and praising the Lord too much let me tell you something if they can drive on the phone you can drive talking in tongues and shouting a little bit in the vehicle everything will be all right I pass people all the time that have been swerving and you used to think they're drunk now you don't think that anymore you know they're texting you know they're checking their social media account we ought to have you need I tell you you need a little of the joy of the Lord to drive you need a little of the Holy Ghost on you to drive these dangerous highways of Life come on now it's a holy ghost in Fire and it's keeping me alive keeping me alive keeping me alive it's the Holy Ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive Jesus is keeping me alive that Old Devil he don't like it but it's keeping me alive keeping alive oh it's keeping me alive that Old Devil he don't like it oh Jesus now Pharisees they don't like it but it's keeping me alive keeping me alive keeping alive those Pharisees don't like it but it's oh Jesus Keep you'll do it when you're driving down the road you'll do it when you're sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving nails in the wall with your carpenter work wherever you are that Joy woo that joy unspeakable and full of Glory one more one more maybe two more and then I'm going to preach perfect strength by Perfect weakness this backs all the way up to 61 but I'd say it's still inspired it's a good one paragraph 27 God he that comes to you empty that was my prayer for this service tonight and tomorrow that every person who comes may feel a little drained physically emotionally spiritually your troubles your trials your problems may have drained your tank but I have prayed and others have prayed that before you leave these grounds your tank is filled up your strength is renewed your faith is inspired and your ready to go fight the last battle because we're getting close to the last one you know he said God he that comes to you empty will go away fool you promised it and I pray that you will fill their hearts and their baskets of their souls so full of the good things of God that they'll go away just bubbling over with joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah he goes on to say just may the cups of these precious people run over with spiritual and good things from God let the Saints say Amen one more seven Church ages the original preaching of these Church ages not Dr Vil's book paragraph 73 now as God poured out the Mana there in the natural and it lasted as long as they were in the journey a beautiful type and the day they entered the promised land the Mana ceased and on the day of Pentecost the same thing look at Pentecost to Moses they look back and they seen the enemy was dead and I want you to look what happened Miriam grabbed are you still here Miry grabbed a tambourine Hallelujah a woman a woman a woman come on Miriam grabbed a tambourine and began to beat it and scam scream and dance I was down there at Shel and they ran around the pews if you you'd have been there on the Red Sea Shore you'd have seen some of the same kind of behavior Hallelujah and for the same reason our Pharaoh is behind us our slavery is done we are no longer slaves we are Sons we are stepping into the full adoption of sons we've got a reason to beat a tambourine to scream a little to dance and run down the bank the women followed her doing the same thing and Moses the pastor threw up his hands and rebuked them didn't Moses call the deacons sir you ever been in a meeting where they I have I have and you know how I feel when I'm in an atmosphere like that if if the Holy Ghost didn't welcome here that's right don't invite me because if the Holy Ghost didn't welcome to run the church if the Holy Ghost didn't welcome to come and move Among Us I don't I'm not welcome either I have no desire to be where the Holy Ghost doesn't want to go because people haven't made him welcome they began to Moses Moses threw up his hands but he didn't rebuke them he didn't call for the deacons to remove them guess what Moses did Holy Ghost wasn't even poured out yet and Moses began to sing and prophesy in the spirit oh my sing a song uh a beautiful song let's let's finish that one at Pentecost the women came out but I thought it was just men that got touched by Pentecost evidently not because brother brandom tells us here the women come out staggering and jumping and dancing and and don't you Brothers think that this let you off the hook because you get a little Holy Ghost stirring in you and you respond as well you can't grab a hold of a live wire and not be moved that's right jumping and dancing and carrying on Peter stood up in the midst of them and said you men of Judea and you that dwell in Jerusalem let this be known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose so so some people begin to write on social media they say oh do you really think the disciples worship like that well I don't know what they did before the day of pentec but on the day of Pentecost I know exactly how they worship they staggered around like drunk men speaking in other tongues and they behaved in such a way that the naysayers said these men have been dipping in the wine and it's just early in the morning and they're already intoxicated so somebody was under the influence of something and let me tell you something if only the music stimulates us then something's wrong but if you get a stimulation from the word you see every now and again somebody jumps up in here under the inspiration of the word and and ever now and again somebody throws up their hand and ever now and again somebody squeezes out an amen because they're being stimulated by the word and they're saying so be it so let the main source of your of your stimulation be from the word from the revelation of the word from the message that you have heard from the truth that has already been revealed to you amen don't let it come from the song and they said well message Believers didn't write all these songs so we might not ought to be singing are you kidding me message Believers didn't write Amazing Grace but that'll work for you won't it let me tell you something do you know how the traditional Church felt when when the zeusa street came and and people began to sing these little choruses under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and they repeated the line over and over again he's alive he's alive the Holy Ghost is alive he's alive he's alive Holy Ghost is alive and they begin to sing it over and over again and the traditional Christians begin to call them African dides and they said these are little African diddies that they've picked up from the tribes of the of the Dark Continent and this is not how worship ought to be and this is not how because it wasn't something written by Wesley and we've got a lot of folks even around the message today if a song is written after 1965 live they don't think it could possibly have any inspiration on it at all or because somebody sung it listen maybe somebody wrote it that's got lips [Music] painted and you don't understand do you don't you understand what he taught us about how the how the anointing Falls it falls on the just and the unjust you just let me take somebody who's got an inspiration and written a song I'm not interested in how they've got their lips done I'm not interested in whether they've been to the beauty part or not if that word that's in that song speaks to my heart and stirs me up I'm not going to follow their lifestyle if Billy Graham preaches the truth I'm going to amen what Billy Graham said if it's the truth somebody said I can't go to these places and hear these singers sing because they don't live like we live let me tell you something that doesn't mean you can't be blessed by the gift that's been placed in their life folks are becoming Pharisees and missing out on a blessing the song many of the songs that you heard tonight have been written since 1965 I love the hymns my children will tell you I'm more comfortable with with a southern gospel sound that's what I grew up on that's what they're going to play in heaven I'll come over ever now and again and visit you over in contemporary music heaven but I'm going to hang out over on the stormy Banks of God's Deliverance I'm going to hang out over there where I can relate to it the most but you know what the Holy Ghost taught me about it it's not whether it suits you or not praise is not about you praise is not about me worship is not about the church somebody help me worship is about him if it exalts him if it lifts him up if it blesses the Lord if it gives his name [Applause] glory amen and even if it's a little more modern oh I hear them raging I'm just going to keep on praising I can't get caught up I can't get distracted I got to just keep on praising you men of Judea and you'll dwell in Jerusalem let it be known unto you hearken my words these are not drunk as you suppos sing is the third hour of the day come on this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel it shall come to pass the last day sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaids w that's the women and made servants will I pour out my spirit come [Music] on Miriam wasn't the only one what's the rest say is that all give me the rest of it it'll show and I'll show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth below pillars of fire and vapor and smoke and it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come that whosoever should call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved on and on he went preaching under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost come on now now I want to do a little teaching tonight are you ready there are nine Hebrew words write it down you that are note takers there are nine Hebrew words that I want to talk about tonight and what I don't finish tonight I'll talk about in the morning there are nine Hebrew words that are translated it's I know it says seven there uh I forgot to correct it thank you uh I I I I found a couple more got brave enough to slip them in there are nine Hebrew words translated at praise in the Old Testament and analyzing these seven words broadens our understanding of the full meaning of Praise how many of you'd like to have a full meaning amen praise is not what we create and what we make it there is a Bible precedent for praise if it's not Bible praise I don't know anything about it we're looking for Bible praise is that right so number one you that are keeping notes number one the word is Hal now sometimes we say Halal but the word is halal Halal or L it's the most common Hebrew word in the Bible for praise and it appears 165 times in the Old Testament and in most cases it is translated as praise it's the most common of all the words and Halal means to flash it means to radiate or shine I don't have that on a slide it means to flash it means to radiate or shine it means to flash forth light to shine like the new moon did you know there were some new moon shining in here tonight and you don't have to worry about them because they have no light of their own the only light they can Flash forth is the light of the Sun the moon reflects the light of the s o n when we're talking about the bride so you can flash your light just shine children of God shine sister April shine when you get under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Austin ha just shine shine flash that light you know what it means to make a show you're making that up it means it not making it up it means to make a show or boasting you know what's all right to boast if you're boasting on the Lord to glory in to be CL oh this is going to get you I don't want to lose all all h similitude of order but but this is what it means halel means to uh clam to to be to be clamorously clamorously foolish some of you is doing [Music] good it means to go about in a raging or raving way somebody said that that that that brother there was just like a bull in a China closet then he has embraced the base root meaning of the word halel it doesn't mean he knocks everybody over it doesn't mean that he acts so crazy that all the attention is drawn on him but it means that when he Praises he is more concerned about letting God be glorified than how he looks the example I want to give you is there's a lot of me I'm waiting on the amen there's a lot of me I got a lot of pounds here and if I had much pride I would be very concerned about what I look like when I praise the [Music] Lord but when I surrender to praise him sometimes it may be a little CL ously foolish it might look like a lot of meat in motion to some people but I'm not doing it for you to look at me if you're looking at me you're looking at the wrong thing I'm not going to let anything hold me back from giving God Hal to go about in a raging or raving way let me read the rest to act mad ly you ever seen anybody get that serious about praise somebody said someone sent a note and said I was streaming one of your services and I caught a hold of somebody a glance of somebody and they look like they were mad they were praising the Lord but they look militant they look like they were going at it almost in a mad way that's Hal some of you will never see that in your lifetime some of you watching this service will never see somebody get to that place where praise becomes so serious for them that it's a war raging but I have and I'm comfortable in that realm it means to to uh act madly it means to dance it means to celebrate it speaks of Jubilation halel 165 times translated praise halel is a primary root word for praise our word [Music] halah halel is hallelujah so our word hallelujah comes from the Hebrew word praise Hal are you with me yes sir it means to be clear to praise to shine to boast to show to Rave to celebrate and as mentioned a moment ago to sometimes make a fool of oneself halel is often used in the plural carrying the implication of a group of people coming together to praise God's greatness as one unit does that sound good to you now let's flash these scriptures up just as fast as we can I ought to get some help there's so many of them to read Psalms 56:4 in God I will will praise halel in God I will praise halel His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh what man can do unto me I'm going to praise if it cost me something I'm going to praise if it makes me an enemy I will not fear what man what flesh can do unto me because when I come to praise I come to halel Psalm 1493 let them praise halel His name in the in the dance let them sing praises with the timberl and harp Psalm 15012 praise halel ye the Lord praise halel God in his sanctuary Praise halel Him in the firmament of his power praise halel him for his mighty acts Praise halel Him according to his excellent greatness Psalm 113 1-3 praise halel ye the Lord Praise halel oh ye Servants of the Lord praise halel the name of the Lord now what did that mean it meant to shine it meant to radiate it meant to Rave or to rage it meant to exuberantly with Jubilation anybody with me I'm not feeling it just now praise the Lord that's what it means now are you going to choose the Bible Way on are you going to let the Bible be your inspiration yes are you going to let somebody talk you out of Praise because the church has found a a a a more dignified way when I was in the filled with the Holy Ghost and birthed out of Pentecost the people lifted their hands like this they knew what lifting the hands means it means a full surrender but I want you to know as the word went out the door and the Holy Ghost begin to leave the Pentecostal movement come on that's right I started seeing the worship hands get a little lower and lower lower until now you go to Charismatic Church they look like they're trying to live something up you are your burden you're supposed to be lifting up the Lord you don't need him down here you need him up there are you really telling brother Shel are you really telling me how to raise my hands H I'm just telling you what the Bible said he didn't say raise your hands Any Way You Want To Praise any way you want to the Bible doesn't say any old praise will do the Bible doesn't say praise him the way you feel comfortable Praise Him according to your color type or your personality type praise him this way if you're an introvert and that way if you're an extrovert the Bible said praise Hal exuberantly Jubilation flash radiate shine are you with me praise Hal ye the Lord Praise halel oh ye Servants of the Lord Praise Hal the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forever more from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised to be praised now a good a good reference for what this kind of Praise looks like is found in 2 Samuel we're not going there but in 2 Samuel chapter 6 the word halel is not used there because the word praise is not the emphasis but it described the definition of halel is a perfect description of how David was when he began to praise the Lord he took off his Royal garment I don't want to just Praise Him in my in my position I want to praise him because of his position position so he took off his Royal garment if you study that in the Hebrew it looks like that he went all the way down to to what would be considered today an undercloak it is certainly not something you would go out in public with it was not indecent it did not expose the the the the private parts of his body but it was not what you would go to the restaurant in it was not what you would go to town in but David got so carried away don't you do this you know you got always got to do the disclaimers for some folks I don't want you praising him in your undershirt not in here Praise Him in your undershirt at home come on Praise Him in your undershirt at home praise him on the bed Praise Him in the car amen but David just guy he got under such an inspiration he just wanted to give lay everything out of the way I just want to lay everything out of the way to magnify the name of the Lord somebody say halel Hal I want to hear you say halel Hal it's praise it's a beautiful form of Praise number two yada in English or Y in Hebrew it's used 114 times in the Old Testament 114 times although it is not always translated in English as praise it means to throw to thrust to cast away from it means hands outward it means to throw out of the hand on can you see the picture should I throw something to show the kids are growing up you know and they're always walking around the room throwing a football when they don't even have a football in their hand boys well there's a Hebrew word for that y used 114 times in the Old Testament not always translated as praise to throw to thrust to Cast Away hands outward to throw out the hand to throw hands into the air therefore to worship with an extension of the hand the opposite of the word Y is a word that means to ring the hands in anxiety and worry have you ever done it I'm preaching to you I'm asking you a question has anybody ever rung their hands maybe not even physically but just emotionally you you just carried about as much as you can and you're under such a load and you're so worried there's a remedy for that there's a remedy for your anxiety there's a remedy for your nervous condition there's a remedy for your panic attacks there's a remedy for your worry spells Kell come on now y do to thrust the hands toward the maker of heaven and Earth that's right like I told you here Tuesday 9 and I'll soon be off of this praise I was going to stop in no just do it all November but I'm carrying over just a little bit you don't even have to say anything when you throw your hands in the air you're a child of God you're a holy ghost filled believer you're a son of the most high God you may not even have words to say you may be under such a pressure and such a load that you can't even articulate words and he knows your do say it your do he knows it he knows what it's about did you notice it it's like it's the same word that's used for throwing a stone away I've got these crazy tennis shoes they are so uh they don't call them tennis shoes anymore what do they call them now sneakers who would call a PA parir of Sho sneakers that is so odd Yankees that's right there you go spoken right out of the mouth of of an next one sneakers we we called them tennis shoes never played tennis what else do they call them sometime kicks you all are trying to make me cool you come way too late but I got a parent they're so comfortable they bounce they make you feel so good when you put them on but they've got such big grooves in the hill that I I get rocks in them the rocks stick up in there and then I go walk on the wood floor and I can feel it in the wood floor and so I just all these aggravating things and I reach down and I pick that rock out and I go to the door and I throw it on the gravel that is the same kind of of interpretation of this word it's the same demonstration of this word if you've got a burden if you're carrying something that displeases you if you're carrying a weight or a load or a heaviness that you don't want to carry anymore throw up your hands sling away your burden come on sling away that which is getting on your nerve throw it away and give God praise that's what y do means 2 Chronicles 20:21 uh charity and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord do you remember this that they should praise I mean appointed praisers on I I I mean licensed praisers we need some of them in our churches cuz it's just a fact that everybody is not going to praise the Lord so maybe we need to appoint some praiser we we appoint we appoint Prayer Warriors and and and alter teams and and deacons and trustees and whatever maybe we just should do what David did and just appoint some folks to sing praises to the Lord and this is such a beautiful expression here it says that uh appointed singers unto the Lord and that should Hal and that should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise y the Lord for his mercy endureth forever now you've got a verse here with two Hebrew words going on you've got Hal shine radiate part of the meaning act madly appear foolishly and then you've got your doll thrust your hands get rid of your burden get rid of your shackles get rid of your chains and give God praise so these singers were going to be those who would Inspire the people to enter into praise thank God for worship leaders thank God for anointed worship leaders thank God for worship leaders that'll sweat if you're going to lead worship you ought to you ought to work up a sweat you ought to put everything you've got at it you ought to sing loud enough to be heard and you ought to have the slight look of somebody who knows what they're singing about leaders leaders worship leaders you see we've called them because some of us are stuck in the 50s and 60s so we call them song leaders well anybody can lead a song if they can carry a tune in a bucket but we're not just trying to encourage people to sing we're trying to encourage people to what praise praise and worship the Lord so you've got to get somebody up there that will praise and worship the Lord not just sing a pretty song do you know I stream Services sometime where people are praising the Lord and leading in praise and worship and this and the leader never one time never one time raises his hands so he really is a song leader from the 50s and 60s he's just leading songs he's just singing songs and hoping that everybody will sing along you need somebody up here that'll throw up their hands sometime you need somebody up here that will Hal a little bit and yah a little bit who might shed a tear who might jump a little bit there are some more words coming because we need somebody to go before us into the darkness into the heaviness and start breaking open that realm that's created anybody listening I'm nearly done no when people praise Psalm 63:4 thus will I bless thee while I live I will y I will yadada lift up my hands in thy name Psalm 673 3 3 and four let the people praise y oh God praise thee Oh God let all the people praise yah thee oh let the Nations be glad and sing for Joy for Thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the Nations upon the Earth ceaw why are you doing this why are you doing this brother sh why are you taking time tonight to break down all those boring and difficult Hebrew words because every time you read praise I want you to know there's a meaning behind it and the Bible has prescribed yes a protocol for praise and that's not half-hearted praise that's not just following the crowd because everybody else is doing it that is sincerely with dedication and sincerity making up your mind that if you're going to praise God Almighty the Creator of Heaven and Earth you're going to give him everything you've got to give him with you're not going to whisper your song you're going to sing it out even some of you would don't carry tune in a bucket some of us have to sing three times as loud to cover you up and God still wants to hear your voice when I hear that I might say oo that was Sour oh that was off key but when God hears that he said that's my young that's my child that's one who's determined they're not concerned about the the skill they're concerned about me they're Lifting me up they're giving me something more than just a little bit of a a of lip service Psalm 1078 I can't read all these oh that men would yadah the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works of the Children of Men Psalm 10715 oh that men would yada the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works for the children of man Psalm 10721 oh that men would yadah the Lord for the goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men which means to thrust forth the hand as though you were throwing something away you are Pride starch stuffiness Psalm 10731 oh that men would yah somebody praise the Lord go ahead [Applause] y Psalm 118 verse 15- 21 the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly has anybody experienced that the right hand of the Lord is exalted the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly hallelujah I shall not die I shall not die I shall not die somebody ought to say that I shall not die but [Music] live oh I saw a drop of blood oh I got a pain over here Dr Google says come on now Dr Google says it's cancer Dr Google says it's heart disease Dr you need to quit listening to Dr Google and you need to start I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord but somebody I loved died yes and if they were children of God they're still praising him you and I one day will follow on that Journey if we don't go by Rapture first but until that day we ought to have this attitude I shall not die brother Brandon said the bride didn't die sons of God don't die they live and why do they live to declare to declare that's that's speak it out isn't it not keep it locked inside to declare the works of the Lord the Lord hath chasen me sore any anybody ever had a whooping from the King and he ha not given me over to unto death whip me but stop short to killing me there we go let's go on next verse open me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will yadah the Lord now there's only one way to yah the Lord and that's with your hands it's what the word means so when you're just reading praise you're thinking well there's many ways we can praise the Lord that's right but there's only one way to yadah him I don't care how fast they go I'm I'm not talking about speed I'm talking about getting them up there and I told you Tuesday night no preacher should ever have to tell you to raise your hands no song leader should ever have to tell you to raise your hands nobody no preacher should ever have to say come on folks say Amen you ought to be so inspired by the word of God regardless of the preacher skill or anointing we ought to be so inspired by the word that it's like fire shut up in our bones and when we hear the truth you amen there's one good way to stay awake let me give you the remedy for sleeping in church Praise Him participate help the preacher Lord knows he needs help open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will yadah the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will yadah thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my Yeshua my salvation the next one we just covered recently for Thanksgiving it's toada write it down toada it appears 32 times in the in the Bible and it means confession toada literally means an extension of the hand in adoration an avow an open statement of affirmation Frank acknowledgment or admission or acceptance It's serious toah comes from the same root word as yada but is used more specifically to da as you know is the modern Hebrew word for what thank you you want to say thank you in Hebrew you say toada if you want to say thank you very much you say toar Raba and you don't answer like you would think to answer you're welcome remember you answer please like in other European cultures and please in Hebrew is is what Raba and you answer bakas bakas which means I I I'm pleased to offer thanks toada comes from that same principle word but is used more specifically as an extension of the hand in adoration by way of application it is apparent in the Psalms and elsewhere that it is used for thanking God for things not yet received do you remember that it's transl ated sometimes as praise other times it's translated as Thanksgiving and it is a word that is reserved for the kind of thanks that says I thank you because you have been faithful yesterday I thank you because you are faithful today and I thank you because you will be faithful tomorrow is anybody confident of that are you sure that he's going to be I am toai is a praised filled confession that God's word is infallible and that it is working in your circumstances I want to tell you something God's word is infallible it cannot fail pastors are not infallible churches are not infallible prophets are not infallible tapes are not infallible but God's word is in infallible it cannot fail it cannot it cannot it cannot fail it is infallible I want you to look at Psalms 42 1-5 as the heart remember that's a little deer as the heart panteth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is th my god when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I had gone with the multitude I went with them to the house of God with the voice of Joy how how is it possible you've been weeping day and night you've been bowed down psalmist you've been bowed down by the load of your life by the worries of your life and yet he said when I went with them to the house of God I went with the voice of Joy yes yeah and the voice of toah the voice of praise the voice of Thanksgiving with a multitude that kept the holy day why art thou cast down oh my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance Psalm 514 offer unto God Thanksgiving toada and pay thy vows to the most high Psalm 5023 who so offereth praise toah glorify me and to him that orderthe will I show the salvation of God Psalms 100 1-4 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that ha made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his Gates somebody said I I I know this kind of Praise is good at home and with the family and and and but but should we really come with such exuberant praise when we come to the house of God there it is enter into its gates with Toda with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good come on for the Lord is good his mercy endureth forever Hallelujah for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations Psalm 5014 offer unto God Thanksgiving toada and pay thy vows unto the most high Psalm 56:12 thy vows are upon me oh God I will render Praises toada unto thee Jeremiah 1725 and 26 are you really reading these I am then shall there enter into the gates of the city Kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David riding in chariots and on horses is they and their princes the men of Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem and this city shall remain forever and they shall come from the cities of Judah and from the places about Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the plain and from the mountain and from the south bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense and bringing sacrifices of toada of Thanksgiving praising God for what has not even happened yet anybody got a l loved one anybody got a neighbor you're trying to see saved anybody got friends that you know need breakthrough in their life anybody need a healing in your body to to praise Him in Advance praise him before the answer comes come on to don't wait until the victory comes Jeremiah uh 30 excuse me Jeremiah 33:11 the voice of joy and the voice of glad is the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts y That's yada there that praise yada the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of toada the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord for I will cause to return the Captivity of the land oh my as at the first sayith the Lord do you know what that means I will restore the prisoners I will bring the hostages home I will bring the prisoners back hello you got loved ones that Satan took off have you got friends that Satan drug away you know I keep hearing this phrase so and so left the message so and so left I I I don't know what that means I I don't even know how it's possible if it means you no longer fellowship with people who Fellowship around the ministry of brother brandham I get it but the message was never William brandham it was never him he tells us that the message was the revelation of Jesus Christ how do you change churches and leave the revelation of Jesus Christ that's true and then I hear other people saying things like well they're just shook well I want you to know maybe some of them are I would you know maybe some of them are shook maybe some of them were not seed in the beginning maybe some of them were never bride but I just can't accept that every person who stumbles out from Among Us that's I I just can't believe they're all of the devil you you may find that easy to believe but I just can't believe that they're all of the devil I want you to know we've all been through some tough times we we've all had some disillusionments in our life we've all had questions arise we've all had doubts arise it drove some of us out of the Fellowship of the faith but that doesn't mean that God doesn't know where to get us it doesn't mean that he don't know how to find us in Satan's captivity I'm not just going to say because they left a message Church they've left Jesus Christ I'm going to believe that some of them are being held captive in the hands of the enemy and when a little bride begins to get stirred up and we get filled with the Holy Ghost and fire the fullness of God in our midst I'm going to believe that that God knows how to go get them and bring them out of captivity for I will cause to return the Captivity of the land and at the first as the first sayeth the Lord number four I'm not getting to all of them but I'm going to get this one in number four is Barack Barak it means blessing baruk is bless or blessing Barack is a significant word that appears 330 times in the Old Testament are you give out yet however this word is only translated to praise once in English and even then only in the King James version or the new King James it means to bless it means to give thanks and praises to God because he has given to us out of his abundance to bless is an act of of adoration and it means specifically to kneel to kneel down to bless God as an act of adoration to salute now I I'm not I'm not calling anyone out but I noticed that when we were up here praising the Lord I won't even say the name but one of our brothers he knelt down here and he began to to Worship the Lord I'm not even going to tell you that it was in tongues but it was and had it been a message had it captured all of our attention it would have required an interpretation but it didn't and I'm going to tell you something if you try to make that Prophet say something more than what Paul [Music] said sir he said don't you do that to me he said I can't preach anything other than what Paul preached I think a lot of people have forgotten how he described the ministry of the seventh angel I I don't want to get in this heavy I know so of you aren't with us in that but I like how he described it he said in fact that that that minister of the seventh angel that Ministry of the seventh angel he has no message that messenger he has no message of his own I know what you've read in the church age book but I know what he said sir he said he has no message of his own it's his job to tie together all the lucans so all you people that get so carried away with reading between the lines and telling me that brother brandom said that to throw us off and all kinds of crazy things that people have come up with through the years why don't you just let this message be based on the absolute why don't you just let it fit the word why don't you just let it dovetail with the Bible and if it don't we don't know how to Pro we do not know how to handle it if it doesn't it's not up to you to figure it out it's our it's our place to trust God stay on the word stay in the word don't don't make him say something more than Paul somebody said what about church order well let me tell you this he also said in more than one place that the pastor is the highest Spiritual Authority in the church he said our churches are sovereign you know what that means Sovereign it means we're not depending on one another for how to do we're not asking our sister churches for money they're not asking us for money we're not trying to make them worship like us I'm GNA stop with that because sometimes I feel pressured to worship as they do but I'm not going to but don't you know there's to be three songs let me tell you something there comes a time when we've got to let the Holy Ghost move if you if it's too much for you you go home we don't lock the doors here there's a church in Tucson locks the doors they they don't let the people leave I don't lock the doors you can leave when you need to leave but I tell you what you're not going to do you're not going to stifle my praise and you're not going to rush me either I'm not even going to let my wife rush me well why would you say that because she comes through the house today and I'm sitting at the dining room table working she said' honey aren't you about done she's got a real sweet Spirit most of the time she said honey aren't you about done I said I'm not uh studying she said you've been studying I mean you've studied before we went you've been stud you're studying a lot I said honey I'm not studying anymore I'm formatting I'm making everything look good so I can see it when I'm preaching uh I might have added a few things after that but at the time that she asked me I was formatting and as she walks down the hall she said uh if you keep on study you're never going to get it never going to have time to get all that out tonight never go I know she I know he's never going to get to that all that tonight you'll never get to that tonight the time you got not but she did in a nice way I didn't get upset with her I didn't call her job's wife or nothing like that I know she loves the Lord you see if I don't ever get a Chipotle Bowl if I don't ever get a corn chip after this service tonight if I don't ever get a Dr Pepper what I am going to do when I leave here is know that I have delivered you see I didn't sit up here and rest while you praised not going to do that folks I needed as much as you do I'm going to enter in Hallelujah I have to I'm not bragging on no no no no no I'm rotten esar I'm rotting in every way there's nothing good in me except him but I tell you when I get in this presence I cannot lock myself in a room I've got to come out here and praise because you're praising and the atmosphere that you create makes me want to get in the middle of it I want to be a part of of it I want to be part of it now this Barack means to bow down to kneel down it means to come in as a salute or an act of adoration it's usually used in a time of prayer or meditation but it's a form of Praise that means a humble position before God so I saw our brother kneel down there and and I don't think there was anybody here but maybe there was some that said that that saw that and thought Oh what is he doing there there comes a time it wasn't an altar call but there Comes A Time you just want to get low brother I've been in that Holy presence where I wanted to put my face under the carpet I didn't want to lay my head on the on the carpet I want to get under the floorboards there's something about his Holiness his awesomeness his righteousness oh the Majesty of the key and you just want to bless you just want to bow now if you're not physically able to Bow this is not not only talking about a position of the body I can't be on my knees for an extremely long amount of time without a cushion or something like that but it's not just about the physical Barack it's not just about the physical bowing it's bowing low it's getting your emotions bowed down it's getting your mind and your will bowed down and surrendered and submitted to him it's approaching him in a lowly place instead of instead of an exalted Place how many of you think you understand the word Barack and in 1st Chronicles 29:20 hurry we're nearly done it's 8:30 yes I know 1 Chronicles 29:20 and David said to all the congregation now bless the Lord Barack bless Barack bow before the Lord your God and all the congregation bless the Lord God of their fathers there it is again Barack the Lord God of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshiped the Lord and the King Psalm 31:21 blessed Barack be the Lord for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong City Psalm 34:1 I Will Bless Barack the Lord at all times I will bow before the Lord my maker at all times his praise shall continually do do you think you're over focusing praise I do not I do not think it's being overemphasized in this hour I think we're busting out amen of years of molds and boxes and I think we're learning what it's like to be free his praise shall continually be in my mouth Psalm 63:4 thus will I bless Barack thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name Psalm 7215 and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall he be praised Barack that's the one time it's translated praise Psalm 956 oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel Barack before the Lord our maker one more Psalm 1031 and two bless Barack the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless Barack the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits number five zamar it's sometimes pronounced in Hebrew zamar used 45 times in the Bible It's A Primitive root word through the idea of striking with the fingers properly to touch the strings or parts of a musical instruments play upon it to make music sometimes accompanied by The Voice hence to celebrate in song and music to give praise to sing forth Praises zamar uh uh means to pluck the strings of an instrument to sing along to praise it's a musical word which is largely involved with joy joyful expressions of music with musical instruments to celebrate with instruments to praise the Lord skillfully on an instrument to touch strings with the fingers when David established the Tabernacle in Zion he set singers before the Lord and commanded them to continuously praise zamar him to continually play on strings a that would accompany their voices as they worshiped him now I know that the the Church of Christ and other other groups believe that musical instruments should not be played in church because they're not mentioned in the New Testament I need you to understand once again that there's a reason for them not being mentioned in the New Testament and that is simply it was the common practice of worship yes every group that got together sung they brought these instruments with them even into the synagogues of Judea and the surrounding areas they sang they played on the instruments what we would call guitars today or Harps and they worship so no no one had to say don't forget to bring your guitar don't forget to bring it didn't have to be mentioned in the New Testament because it was something that everyone knew was already established in the Bible as a part of worship Zar Zar the fingers zamar and it goes through the scripture and I don't want to take the time but 1st Chronicles 16810 give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing Psalms the word Psalms here is the words themar unto him talk ye of all his wondrous Works Glory ye in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord Psalm 21:13 be thou exalted oh Lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise Zar thy power Psalm 33:20 excuse me 332 praise the Lord with harp sing zamar unto him with saltry and an instrument of 10 strings now it there there are some people who say there were no instruments of 10 strings in the Old Testament there are those who say there were instrument instruments of of nine and 11 and 12 and sometimes 10 but here's what I like to say if you don't play an instrument here's you a 10 string instrument to play praise with look at that sweet little angel girl right there with blonde hair using her hands go ahead honey zamar there's another one come on

brought us out of man-made religion he brought us out of denomination and gave us freedom we ought to praise him it's good to be free Hallelujah you ask look look this is what has brought us together the way we are tonight that's why we're here we are those who know what it means to be bound not just in sin that was way back there for some of us but we know what it means to be in the clutches of religion there's people here that know what it means to to have to make sure sure you've got the right kind of window shade yes most of the New Hope folks You' have never lasted there you you not even a button because that was prideful man's ideas they'll just they'll weigh you down with all kinds of regulations and rules to try to bind you and keep you you they don't want you to go anywhere we got SE some of us got separated from our mothers at Birth and we spent some time in the barnyard of denominationalism and we grew among the chickens Hallelujah we knew we didn't look like them we didn't act like them and we didn't even like to eat what they ate but all we could do was eat what we had and then one day Jehovah Eagle Jehovah Eagle he comes flying over that Barnard with a and when we heard it we recognized who we were and we knew we didn't belong to the chickens we didn't Belong To The Barnyard we weren't called to Peck around in the yard we were called to take up our wings Hallelujah and sore through the revelation of his word and through freedom but slowly many of us slowly allowed men to tame us we said we'd never do it again but even around this great truth many of us got tamed again that's finished that's done away with that's not for today and the next thing you know that Spirit has so morphed itself until now it's no longer just no gifts and no freedom to worship and no emotion involved now it's no preachers come on it's the same devil it's just morphed itself in De press play and Obey you see the enemy wasn't satisfied just taking the gifts of the Spirit he wasn't satisfied just taking tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healing he wanted the five-fold ministry he wanted to steal he wanted to steal the five-fold ministry from the bride of Christ yes and make her believe her only hope was to gather preacher sit down and press play and Obey listen I love those tapes I listen to the message every day or or every other day of my life because it's food for me but I know God has a five-fold Ministry in the earth amen I hear the prophet telling us that she would that five-fold Ministry would be on the scene for the perfecting of the bride and we need it but they didn't take the five-fold ministry away first they just started at the apostles and Prophets yeah right for years it was okay to be a pastor a teacher or an evangelist but not to be a five-fold prophet or a five-fold apostle and now now look what the spirit's done they say the fivefold ministry is over with and all we can do is listen to tapes come on now on some of us you've just come too late you've just come too late to tell us because we've had once you get a taste of freedom I don't mean freedom to sin I mean freedom to soar there's nothing out there in the world I want but I want everything that the Holy Ghost has for me now one last thing in closing and that is this the spirit of God doesn't have to move on you to raise your hands that's not what praise is praise is not always a response to the moment praise is sometimes a a Thanksgiving offering a sacrifice of praise so if you're sitting in a service and you don't feel like rais you raise them anyway and this whole idea that nobody can dance or jump or move around unless the Holy Ghost gets on them that's just not what I see in the in the Book of Psalms it say it doesn't say say wait on the spirit wait on you wait on the Holy Ghost to come take over run you out of your own thinking capacity he didn't say that said praise the Lord in the dance praise the Lord clap your hands he said shout unto God you don't have to wait on an inspiration to do what the Bible has told you to do sometimes it's a sacrifice how many there's only two times to praise the Lord right when you feel like it when you don't you're a marvelous group of people all of you I I I don't want to be weird here strange but I believe every one of you were supposed to be here tonight you have added something to this service you've brought something with you you didn't just come here to get you brought some Faith here you brought some strength here and you're ministering to one another as you praise the good Lord we're going to close we will be back to tomorrow at 11:00 Eastern Time To Worship the Lord only one service tomorrow we're going to let God have his way we'll pray maybe pray for some who
