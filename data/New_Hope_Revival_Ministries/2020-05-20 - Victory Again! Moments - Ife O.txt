TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can have victory again [Music] we need to be like Samson and say Oh Lord one more time one more time I am throwing myself on the rock one more time I am coming to the rock of my salvation one more time I am saying I had victory then and I'm going to have victory now victory belongs to me it is what you paid for at Calvary and I am standing here today saying victory belongs to me and I don't care what happened in that span of five years ten years twenty years it doesn't matter to me what happened in that span it doesn't even matter what look like defeat time or on a one time or another it doesn't matter there has been a time where God has given me a victory over whatever I may be facing today I can't get into your head and find out what that problem is what that that you're feeling defeated from today that you felt like you had victory over some time ago but I am here to tell you as I proclaim the Gospel message today that that was a victory it was a victory and what you need to do is take that victory and put it right in the face of the devil and say see the rock of my salvation gave me victory over you once already he gave me victory over you twice three times four times and I'm coming back to my rock the Lord Jesus Christ again to tell you Satan that I still have the victory because the victory lives in side of me we have allowed the enemy to poke our eyes out we have allowed him to steal our vision we have allowed him to steal our spiritual vision then and make us think that we have never had a victory but I'm decreed the word of the Lord to you today you had a victory or two or three or four and no matter how you feel today and no matter how much lack of vision you feel like you have this moment I am here to tell you today the word of the Lord to you today is you can have victory again same enemy another victory
