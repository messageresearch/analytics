Description:
In the Old Testament God was very specific on how He wanted His dwelling place built and gave detailed instructions on how everything was to be structured. We believe that He no longer dwells in tents and temples but His desire is to inhabit a people, the Bride of Christ, and that she follow His divine pattern for how He wants His “temple” built today!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor step Shelly and I'm coming to you today from the New Hope Revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama I want to thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity to bring a teaching maybe mixed with a little preaching of God's pure word I pray it will be a blessing to you I want to thank you for contacting us for sending in your prayer requests and your comments and even your questions and if you haven't taken an opportunity to do that already why don't you visit our ministry website at revival. G all the contact information will be given to you on the screen in case you didn't get it down in time we'd love to hear from you we're a small Congregation of Bible believing people in uh Central East Central Alabama and uh we have a heart for the nations of the world I have traveled in over 60 Nations preaching the gospel in person and now God has given us this great opportunity for the past few years to be able to identify and be associated with These Fine Christian networks that are taking the gospel seriously this commission they're taking it seriously and they're helping to get the good news all over the world even by internet so let's be faithful to support these Christian networks that you're watching this program on with our faithful prayers and if at all possible even with your financial support be a blessing to these networks they're doing a lot lot for the kingdom of God we want to get right back into our study we've been studying on God's pattern for mankind how we can discover what God desires for us in our lives and how we can measure up uh to to the absolute word of God so that we can be used for the sake of the Kingdom in this last hour so let's get right back to the word again shall we do that in Revelation chapter 11 last week we were reading in verse one and there was given me this is John and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God number one and the altar number two and them that worship therein number three the reason why I read that on the broadcast last week is to uh remind us as Believers to remind us that there is a measuring device whereby we are measured not just the the Tabernacle the sanctuary of God in the wilderness was to be certain Dimensions not just the Ark of the Covenant or even Noah's Ark uh we had very specific dimensions given for that uh the room of the altar the holy Place uh all of these instruments of of the Tabernacle and the temple there were meticulous details given color design Dimensions but but even us as worshippers God told John that even the worshippers should be measured now remember that John wasn't allowed to just use any measuring device he had to use the one that God gave him and the measuring device that God uses in this hour to measure those that worship Him is his holy word his unadulterated word of God the pure word of God not not man's watered down interpretations like we have today but the pure word of God and and I know that everyone doesn't have the privilege of being able to study the ancient languages of scripture but if you had that opportunity you would discover a new world when you look at God's word when we start looking at it in the original languages that it was first written in it gives us tremendous insight and when I run across something like that I I'm not a scholar by any means but when I run across something of Interest like that I enjoy sharing it with my congregation and I enjoy sharing it with my television congregation as well because I don't know how you feel but when I fell in love with the Lord I fell in love with his word his word is life to me and I need it every day of my life also on the broadcast last week we talked about the very definition of measurement it means to ascertain the size the amount or the degree of something by using an instrument or device marked in standard units or by comparing it with an agreed standard and again that agreed standard must be the word of God we talked about uh how that that uh great Det details were given concerning every choice that was to be made in the Tabernacle in the temple and it causes us to believe that if God's first Dwelling Place the Tabernacle was to be according to a certain measurement pattern and design if if the temple was also to be according to a certain pattern measurement and design that also God's final Dwelling Place the place that he wanted to dwell all along that it would also o be uh according to God's pattern his measurement and his design and I'd like to read to you a scripture found in the book of Acts the acts of the Holy Spirit by the apostles in Acts chap 7 beginning in verse 45 we find out it's revealed to us where that final Dwelling Place of God is not the Tabernacle not the temple but that final place the place that God longs to dwell with all all of his being so let's look at it verse 45 of chapter 7 of the book of Acts why which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David verse 46 who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob verse 47 but Solomon built him a house that's first we have the Tabernacle now we have Solomon building him a house what was that called that was the Holy Temple verse 48 how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet verse 49 Heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol what house will ye build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things God is saying that there is no place big enough to contain his fullness but he asked the people what house will you build me and of course man has tried to do that he has tried to build great Cathedrals beautiful Church buildings with Steeples high and lofty stained glass windows padded pews the finest that the world has to offer but we found out in the scripture that none of that is good enough to be a dwelling place for God not even the mega church the multi uh multi-million dollar facilities of this world it's still not fine enough it's not sufficient enough because it's not where God's looking to dwell he's looking to dwell in a house that only you can build him a house that only I can build him and what what house is that well the scripture tells us in the newer Covenant know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit God is not looking for a tabernacle to dwell in any longer or a temple made with men's hands he is looking to dwell inside of this Temple of your temple our our mortal body he wants to come in uh in the older Covenant we had God above us in the newer Covenant through Emmanuel the Lord Jesus our Messiah we had god with us but in this age and in this dispensation we not only have god with us but we have God in us God by the Holy Ghost by the spirit of God lives inside of the believer quickening us making us alive and revealing the heartbeat of God to men I don't know about you but I want to know what God is after in my life uh on the first uh broadcast of this series a couple weeks ago I made the analogy of of uh someone I know this is kind of hard for you to get your brain around maybe I hope it'll be something you can relate to but it would be like somebody baking God a lemon pie or every time they came to worship they make this beautiful lemon mering pie and they bring it to God and and um and give it to him as an offering and then one day uh when they stand in God's presence in heaven they find out that God didn't care anything about lemon pie his favorite pie was strawberry now that may sound a little bit silly to you but what I'm trying to say in that is I think a lot of times we do the same things over and over and over again because that's what we've been taught in Creeds and dogmas of men and we have come to think that that's what God is interested in uh maybe it's in you know statues or in sense or some of the other strange things that we have borrowed from Pagan religions and uh place them front and center in Christianity and and we haven't stopped to ask God God what do you think about us praying to statues God what do you think about us you know burning incense in your house and what do you think about us uh confessing our sins to to a priest and what what do you think about all of these things I'm not trying to be offensive to anybody's faith I'm just telling you God may not be interested in your lemon pie he may have a partiality to strawberry pie and we want to when we stand before him we want to know that we have been giving him what he likes what he desires out of us so what are we supposed to do are we supposed to find out what the Pope says that God likes or our pastor says that God likes or do we have something even uh more pure than that I think we do although I I appreciate our Godly leaders in the faith but I think God has given us the recipe for the pie that God likes the best he's given us his word and he not only gives us this word and leaves us alone to figure it out but he gives us the precious Holy Spirit the holy ghost that that breaks the word down that helps us to digest the word of God we always use that analogy of food because the word of God becomes like food to us it doesn't feed our flesh it feeds our Inner Man it gives us strength it gives us sustenance it gives us refreshment that we need to live in this wicked world that we're living in and so the recipe for God's favorite dinner it's right here in the book and we've got the Holy Spirit to help us work through it to discern to find out how we can best apply it because some people say well that's a antique book that book was written thousands of years ago how could it possibly have any re relevance for today I beg your pardon this book is as update as any book that was written yesterday because it wasn't written by men uh out of their own intellect it was written by men who were moved upon by the holy spirit of God and I'll tell you the Holy Spirit doesn't get stale there is no expiration date to the Holy Spirit he is just as present and real and relevant today as he was 2,000 years ago so the Holy Spirit can take this word of God and show us how to apply it to Modern Life and uh sure technology has rocked on and we're living in a different kind of culture today than what they were living in then but this word of God is still very relevant and it is still very applicable to our life and whether we like it or not this book is still the measuring device for the worshippers we're being measured right now whether we realize it or not and I'll tell you I'm going to be a little bold here it's time to quit playing church it's time to quit being Hypocrites I know that all of you are not able to relate to what I'm saying because you're not guilty but the spirit of God is reaching out to those of us who may be who have who have uh been doing the same old thing for so long that we've just never stopped and asked God is that really what you want me to be doing anyway we've grown cold and stagnant in our faith we need a Revival a Revival that doesn't start in the church house a Revival that starts in this house what house will you build me says the Lord what kind of Temple will you give me to dwell in well you can't make the choice of the colors and you can't make the choice of the material you can't make the choice of the dimensions and standards of that of that house even though you say well it's mine well it is no longer yours this body is no longer your body this body is now his body we are bought with the price we now belong to the Lord I tell you that doesn't make me feel angry it makes me feel relieved I'm his and he's mine and listen whatever he has started in my life whatever he has started in your life I assure you he is faithful and he is able to perfect to complete to finish everything that he has started just let him just let him have his complete sway in your life one of the ways that you and I can discover what God's pattern is what his uh standard of measurement is for our life is to not only look to the word of God but we need to find the place of getting in the spirit and you know to get in the spirit means to to cut off your uh your uh um the Consciousness I'm going to word it uh carefully here the Consciousness the connection that you have to your environment a and that usually comes first by the five senses what you see what you hear smell taste and so forth um we need to quiet that down we need to quieten that we need to to to uh find a place that secret place with God where we are not distracted by what we see and what we hear and what we smell what we taste and what we touch the the inner chamber the secret place the place of the stairs The Hidden Garden of the Lord the closet that Jesus spoke about in the newer Covenant that place where we steal away and pray where we pull ourselves into the into the closet get on our knees and we just make a tabernacle before God we're too busy folks we're too busy in our life life we're too busy at work we're too busy with our family we're too busy in in entertaining ourselves we need to find the time to be alone with the Lord and it's in that place where we are not being stimulated by our environment we're being stimulated by the spirit of God we're actually being transformed From the Inside Out uh in order for Moses to get above his circumstances what were his circumstances he was leading two million grumbling griping complaining murmuring hard-headed stubborn people he was trying to lead them and pastored them and Shepherd them right after they had come out of Egyptian slavery so he's not only dealing with two million hard-headed people he's do dealing with two million people who have a slave mentality a people who haven't yet learned what it means to be free in in in God to be free in the spirit so he's trying to lead them and direct them and he's hearing they're groaning and they're moaning and they're complaining he must have been crazy he must have felt like he he needed a nerve pill or something but instead he heeded the wooing of the spirit of God in Exodus 24 verse 16 and 18 and the glory of the Lord Abode upon Mount SII and the cloud over uh the cloud covered it for six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him up into the mount and Moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights I'm not suggesting that all of you can spend 40 days and 40 nights with the Lord but I am suggesting that if you want to discover uh the Heavenly pattern for how things ought to be conducted here on the earth you're going to have to get in the glory Cloud you're going to have to get in the spirit you're going to have to go up you're going to have to move up and Revelation chapter 4 gives us that great invitation that was given to John as he was in the spirit on the Lord's day and he heard this voice that said come up higher I want to show you something oh listen to me people of God friend hear me now we need to find that invitation we need to hear it and we need to obey it come up forget about your circumstances right now forget about your debt forget about your marriage woes forget about the the struggles of your family set a moment aside right now to come up with me into the spirit of the Lord let the anointing of God come down over you in your home right now let the presence of the Lord begin to move over you as you worship him as you give him praise as you give him glory as you give him honor shut off that that uh ever constant grinding mind you know the that where thoughts are just dashing and dashing and dashing sometimes we get wore out by our own thoughts see if you can find a place of Praise see if you can find a place of prayer where all of that becomes quiet and you you listen to hear the still small voice of God because it's in that moment that he wants to reveal to you his pattern for your life his pattern his his idea his desire for how he wants to work in you when he met with Moses he told him see that you make all things according to the pattern his pattern God's pattern God had a lot of ideas about a lot of things he had an idea about how long the tent pegs were supposed to be in the Tabernacle he gave them dimensions for the very pegs that you hold the tent down in the wind and in the wilderness Moses could not have built the Tabernacle uh the way he wanted to or even the easiest way he thought that it could be built and then asked God to come down and approve it it had to be built God's way by his design and by his measurements I hope you can hear me that's what's happened in the church World we've built a church we've made a structure we've done it the way we thought it ought to be or the way that was easiest to do and then we're saying Lord come bless us oh come down and be with us come down and be among us and you know what God is saying he's saying I can't bless your mess I can't bless it because I didn't Inspire it I can't bless it because it didn't originate in my plan it didn't originate with me it's like it's like uh uh the the the Apostle Paul speaking to the Galatians oh foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you you you started off in the spirit and now you think you can finish in the flesh what was started in the spirit oh friend this is what the church has done we have gotten so far away from God's holy book from living a Sanctified and separate life we have lived the way we wanted to live and we've asked God to come and smile to approve it and we think somehow in fact I hate to say it but we deceived ourselves at times to think that God is pleased with us when we're doing the very opposite of what he has revealed to us that he wants us to do in his word I don't mean to condemn I don't mean to I don't mean to preach down at you I just tell you it's so late I'm not talking about uh the the time of the broad it's getting late too it'll soon be time to pray for you I'm talking about out there I'm talking about in the world it's getting very very late it's getting very nigh time for the remnant bride to rise and shine for our light has come and if we're going to rise and shine and we're going to to step up or grow up into the stature of the perfect man we're going to have to do it quickly because time is running out for for us to be formed into His Image God's meticulous I think I've established that in three broadcasts now that God has a pattern Moses had to go up into the glory Cloud into the divine presence to be able to see the pattern even today it has to come by Revelation it's not by following rules it's not by following Church orders what it's about is letting the holy spirit of God break this word down we could say I mentioned that we often use the analogy of food when we're talking about the word because it's nourishment to us uh then we could call it the digestive process the process by which the holy spirit of God breaks the word down for us and shows us how to apply it in our own individual lives because we are being measured I want you to just picture me with a measuring stick over my head or a measure over my head because God is measuring his people and in our strength in our power we could never measure up with our good works we could never measure up but as we surrender to the Holy Spirit as we surrender to the work of God in our lives then we come to a place where where where when he looks at us he sees a finished work in us if we could only begin to understand what was accomplished on our behalf if we can yield to it so that we can appropriate it when he died on Calvary when he paid that price with his own life's blood everything I need to be perfect in God's sight was made available to me by the blood everything I need to be righteous to be holy to be set apart in God's sight was made available to me by the finished work of the Cross but if I keep trying to do it on my own by my own standard by my own opinions I will never fully access the finished work I will never fully be able to appropriate the power of the blood of the crucified lamb in my own life it's a perfect balance again I've said on three of these sessions that it is not uh we are not saved by works we are saved unto Works The Works follow when our lives have truly Been Changed by the power of God the good works will follow because we want to be obedient to him in all things I want to pray for you right now that the struggling in your soul will cease and that you will come to perfect peace of what he has done in your life and you'll begin to let the spirit of God live through you father I thank you for this opportunity that you have given me to teach today and I thank you that I can join my faith with the faith of the individuals who are watching this program right now and I ask you Lord to bring peace to the troubling Soul all of the Roaring and the voices and the turmoil of this life I pray that you will bring peace and quiet to it right now and that my friends wherever they may be would begin to hear your still Small Voice in their lives and that you would come and live through them that your anointing Ing and your power and your character would begin to flow through them so that they could be at peace so they could be quiet Lord teach us how to fully appropriate the precious blood that you shed on our behalf and while I'm praying I'm going to ask that you release healing to the sick and the affirmed you are still a god of Miracles and I ask you right now to send your healing virtue into the nations of the world right now and break the power of sickness and disease and we will give you praise and honor and Glory we ask this in the name of our Messiah Yeshua
