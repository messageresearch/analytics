[1:01:23] now but
[1:01:25] you might as well take a break here for
[1:01:27] just a moment
[1:01:28] we welcome you into the house of the
[1:01:30] lord this morning
[1:01:31] we welcome all of you who are streaming
[1:01:34] this service
[1:01:36] on various platforms in fact our website
[1:01:39] is open today
[1:01:41] so that anyone who goes to the website
[1:01:44] and logs on
[1:01:46] they will be bypassing the login system
[1:01:48] and they will come straight into the
[1:01:50] service
[1:01:50] which is a great blessing to many people
[1:01:53] and
[1:01:54] we are streaming also on youtube live
[1:01:57] and also on facebook live and the people
[1:02:01] are appreciating it so
[1:02:03] that makes us feel good and we're
[1:02:05] getting greetings
[1:02:07] i think one of the things i miss the
[1:02:09] most about
[1:02:10] uh using the login system uh
[1:02:13] and not having it this morning is not
[1:02:16] being able to see
[1:02:17] where people are streaming in from so if
[1:02:21] you are
[1:02:22] watching the service on youtube or
[1:02:24] facebook would you just
[1:02:25] type your country in there so that we
[1:02:27] will know where you are and i saw
[1:02:29] someone just a moment ago said i'm
[1:02:31] watching in cameroon
[1:02:32] so we want to say god bless you i'm
[1:02:35] going to have to say it in english
[1:02:37] because i can't say it in french but god
[1:02:39] bless you
[1:02:40] in cameroon and i saw where one person
[1:02:44] posted a moment ago and said what a
[1:02:47] sweet atmosphere i can
[1:02:49] feel it even online
[1:02:52] that's an answer to our prayer that's
[1:02:54] what we pray
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:58] when we prepare for the service that's
[1:03:00] what we're praying
[1:03:02] is that somehow the presence of the lord
[1:03:04] will reach
[1:03:05] through the technology otherwise it
[1:03:08] would just be a dry
[1:03:10] viewing experience but we want you to be
[1:03:12] able to sense the presence of the lord
[1:03:14] how many of you know he's been here this
[1:03:16] morning already
[1:03:18] and we know that he's not going to leave
[1:03:20] us now we want to just keep our minds
[1:03:22] focused on him for another moment
[1:03:25] so i've never really asked for
[1:03:27] permission
[1:03:28] to call brother richard paw paul but i
[1:03:31] called him that all day long yesterday
[1:03:33] and i don't know what he thinks about a
[1:03:35] 53 year old man calling him papa he
[1:03:38] couldn't possibly be my papaw
[1:03:40] but i hear it a lot i hear pawpaw and
[1:03:43] mimi
[1:03:44] and so now we know why we call her mimi
[1:03:47] i didn't realize that it was one of the
[1:03:49] pain girls who named her mimi
[1:03:50] zoe was it zoe and so she's just me me
[1:03:54] well today is
[1:03:55] paw paw brother richard me me
[1:03:58] sister elita's wedding anniversary i
[1:04:01] believe it's 41 years
[1:04:02] is that right could we just all say
[1:04:05] happy anniversary to them
[1:04:07] god bless you 41 years
[1:04:15] that's a lot i mean that's a lot 41
[1:04:18] years
[1:04:19] and i understand that today would also
[1:04:22] be
[1:04:23] maw's wedding anniversary is that right
[1:04:26] and so we just want to say
[1:04:28] someone remembered enough to pass the
[1:04:30] word to us
[1:04:31] of course they called you by your first
[1:04:32] name and i didn't know who they're
[1:04:34] talking about i do know your first name
[1:04:36] but i said well who is that so we want
[1:04:39] to say happy
[1:04:40] anniversary to you too it was a special
[1:04:42] day for you
[1:04:43] and i know you remember it so god bless
[1:04:45] you god bless you
[1:04:50] as far as buddy the dog goes
[1:04:53] i i don't know that i've ever had three
[1:04:56] people
[1:04:56] three separate people text me
[1:04:59] uh in one single morning
[1:05:03] about a dog that was sick but that will
[1:05:06] show you how much that dog
[1:05:08] means to ian and how concerned those who
[1:05:11] love him so much
[1:05:12] were and i said well if maul would have
[1:05:14] had my number she might have been number
[1:05:16] four to text me
[1:05:17] because buddy is a part of their lives
[1:05:20] and we all choked up a little bit this
[1:05:22] morning when we were praying for him and
[1:05:24] we
[1:05:25] we pray that god will help ian now i
[1:05:28] i uh quietly called the dog the horse
[1:05:31] because it's one of the biggest dogs
[1:05:33] i've ever seen but ian has kind of grown
[1:05:35] into him
[1:05:36] but when he when he first got him it
[1:05:38] looked a little overwhelming it looked
[1:05:40] like ian could have
[1:05:41] could have ridden him to church if he
[1:05:43] didn't need it away but may the lord
[1:05:45] help them this morning
[1:05:47] uh we we think of it we can't help but
[1:05:50] but to think that they're
[1:05:51] hurting and we'd like for the lord to
[1:05:53] make a way to heal the dog
[1:05:56] he's a healer
[1:05:59] we were praying for sister megan's
[1:06:01] automobile
[1:06:02] have you ever prayed for yours oh
[1:06:07] you're too spiritual to pray for your
[1:06:09] vehicle
[1:06:11] well you better have a good mechanic
[1:06:12] then cause you're gonna need it
[1:06:16] boy i lay my hands i've laid my hands on
[1:06:18] a vehicle
[1:06:19] many many many times and if i had time
[1:06:22] this morning i'd go back there in my
[1:06:24] file
[1:06:25] cabinet and i'd pull out an old copy of
[1:06:28] only believe magazine
[1:06:30] and i would read you the story of how a
[1:06:32] dear dear friend of mine brother gerald
[1:06:34] cleveland
[1:06:36] met brother branham in the restaurant
[1:06:37] one night coming back from
[1:06:39] jeffersonville
[1:06:40] and met him there in the restaurant and
[1:06:43] he said to him brother branham
[1:06:45] we're having a lot of trouble here with
[1:06:47] the studebaker
[1:06:48] and he said we got a long way to go on
[1:06:51] some very bad roads
[1:06:53] and he said we need you to pray and
[1:06:55] brother branham told him it'll be all
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:58] just kind of bowed his head with a
[1:06:59] little little prayer it'll be all right
[1:07:02] and i want you to know the lord did
[1:07:04] miraculous things i've heard brother
[1:07:06] cleveland tell it many times
[1:07:08] it got him all the way from
[1:07:09] jeffersonville indiana to anderson south
[1:07:12] carolina
[1:07:13] and pulled in the driveway before they
[1:07:15] ever had another problem with it
[1:07:17] that was late at night they drove all
[1:07:20] night had to go to work the next morning
[1:07:22] that was the goodness of god if god can
[1:07:24] do that for a studebaker
[1:07:27] oh that although that's a pretty nice
[1:07:29] looking vehicle
[1:07:30] when you look back at them now not to
[1:07:32] say anything about your sister megan
[1:07:35] it looks like a little bug you know that
[1:07:37] just like you like it
[1:07:39] but if god can heal the studebaker he
[1:07:41] can heal little sister
[1:07:43] megan when i see her drive up in that
[1:07:45] vehicle it reminds me of those little
[1:07:47] children's books that we used to have
[1:07:49] where the little where the little bugs
[1:07:51] and insects were driving around in these
[1:07:53] tiny little

[1:14:50] again
[1:14:51] those of you who are joining us from
[1:14:53] many different places
[1:14:55] god bless you last sunday our service
[1:14:59] was
[1:14:59] viewed in 20 different nations
[1:15:03] and what a blessing it is to a little
[1:15:05] congregation like this
[1:15:07] to know that we've been given an
[1:15:08] opportunity to be able to reach out in
[1:15:11] that manner and we give the glory and
[1:15:13] the honor
[1:15:14] to the lord jesus christ may i say as
[1:15:16] you're pulling the scripture and getting
[1:15:18] ready to put it up for us
[1:15:20] revelation 12 verse 9 and 10 and then
[1:15:22] i'm going to read romans 8
[1:15:24] 33 and 34 that we had our second
[1:15:29] graduation service here on friday night
[1:15:33] and it was a very special evening all
[1:15:35] together
[1:15:37] brother carrie i've gone back now three
[1:15:39] times
[1:15:40] and watched the girl's song on on stream
[1:15:44] and it was a blessing to me every one of
[1:15:47] those times
[1:15:48] there was an anointing there was an
[1:15:51] anointing on on it and i enjoyed it so
[1:15:55] very much and you know
[1:15:58] sometimes you can take a song and it can
[1:16:00] be a good song
[1:16:02] but you can make it like drag you know
[1:16:04] it just kind of drags
[1:16:06] there was such a an uplift in that
[1:16:09] song and the harmony was so sweet
[1:16:13] and i appreciated it so much and i was
[1:16:16] so thankful that i
[1:16:17] uh could go back and watch it over and
[1:16:19] over and i thought zion
[1:16:22] and solomon sang so wonderful together
[1:16:25] and with i don't know if i've ever heard
[1:16:27] zion sing out like that
[1:16:30] and uh so good i wasn't the only one
[1:16:32] that noticed that so so
[1:16:34] i just would like to say there's no
[1:16:36] excuse
[1:16:37] for us not to have one special song
[1:16:39] every service
[1:16:40] there's plenty of singers here if you're
[1:16:43] waiting on us to ask you to sing you may
[1:16:46] never sing again because sometimes we're
[1:16:49] just focused on everything else what
[1:16:51] we've
[1:16:51] the song leaders trying to get his songs
[1:16:54] together and i'm trying to get birthdays
[1:16:56] together and sermon together
[1:16:58] and we may not just do it but i believe
[1:17:00] if you've got a gift
[1:17:02] you don't have to think you're a good
[1:17:03] singer but if you know you've got a gift
[1:17:05] to bless people
[1:17:06] you ought to step right up and say i've
[1:17:09] got a song
[1:17:10] whenever you can use me i'm talking to
[1:17:12] somebody
[1:17:14] whenever you can use me i've got a song
[1:17:17] and
[1:17:17] brother greeley will make a note of it
[1:17:19] if you go to him he will he'll make a
[1:17:21] note of it
[1:17:22] and we can have it i wouldn't if i
[1:17:24] actually sat here and thought
[1:17:26] if it wasn't running a little bit late
[1:17:28] and i wouldn't just scare them clean to
[1:17:30] death
[1:17:32] on a spur of a moment i'd ask them to
[1:17:34] come and sing both of those songs
[1:17:36] but i hope you all will run through it
[1:17:38] again and be ready because i sure would
[1:17:40] like to hear
[1:17:41] both of you sing it again you're still
[1:17:43] going to be here a little while
[1:17:44] and so maybe you'll do that for us in
[1:17:46] another service
[1:17:48] verse 9 of revelation 12 and i heard a
[1:17:50] loud voice
[1:17:53] excuse me you're right
[1:17:56] as usual girls you're right and the
[1:17:59] great dragon was cast
[1:18:01] out that old serpent called the devil
[1:18:05] and satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:18:08] world
[1:18:09] he was cast out into the earth
[1:18:13] and his angels were cast out
[1:18:16] with him and i heard a loud
[1:18:20] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:18:24] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:18:27] of
[1:18:28] our god and the power
[1:18:31] of his christ for the accuser
[1:18:34] of our brethren is cast down
[1:18:38] which accused them before our
[1:18:42] god day and
[1:18:45] night he is a faithful adversary
[1:18:50] he has been a consistent accuser
[1:18:54] of the brethren so you don't ever have
[1:18:56] to worry about him getting slack
[1:18:59] he is always on the job
[1:19:02] now if you'll give me romans 8 verse
[1:19:06] 33 and 34
[1:19:09] and then we'll read that together
[1:19:13] and then move on in this service this
[1:19:15] morning
[1:19:16] who shall lay anything
[1:19:20] anything to the charge of god's
[1:19:24] elect it is god
[1:19:28] that justify it it's between
[1:19:31] you and your god
[1:19:34] come on now you go to him and he
[1:19:38] is the justifier who shall lay anything
[1:19:43] to the charge of god's elect it is
[1:19:46] god that justifieth and now the next
[1:19:50] verse who is he that condemneth
[1:19:54] it is christ that died yea
[1:19:57] rather that is risen again
[1:20:00] who is even at the right hand of god and
[1:20:03] we know
[1:20:04] that is the right hand of power and
[1:20:06] authority
[1:20:07] who also maketh
[1:20:10] intercession for us
[1:20:13] i want to read it again who is he that
[1:20:15] condemneth
[1:20:16] it is christ that died yea rather that
[1:20:19] is risen again
[1:20:21] who is even at the right hand of god
[1:20:24] who also maketh intercession
[1:20:28] for us now i want to speak to you today
[1:20:32] on the accuser versus the advocate
[1:20:36] we have an accuser i told you he was
[1:20:39] consistent and
[1:20:41] on the job but thanks be to god
[1:20:44] we also have an advocate and he is
[1:20:48] faithful and always on the job
[1:20:52] hallelujah and the accuser he can only
[1:20:55] play make-believe with you
[1:20:57] he can only bother you
[1:21:00] if you allow him to that's right but i
[1:21:04] want you to know what
[1:21:05] the advocate has done on our behalf is
[1:21:08] more than we can express when we get in
[1:21:12] his presence if we start reflecting
[1:21:14] on what he has done for us it will
[1:21:17] absolutely overwhelm who we are
[1:21:19] and we will just spend i don't know how
[1:21:22] much time sometimes the time
[1:21:24] slips away so fast when you get in that
[1:21:26] place of worship
[1:21:28] may god add his blessing to the reading
[1:21:30] of his word
[1:21:31] you may be seated
[1:21:35] the accuser versus the advocate
[1:21:41] satan is relentless in his
[1:21:44] accusations against the body of christ
[1:21:48] he has particularly turned his target
[1:21:51] his attention on the bride the prophet
[1:21:55] of god has told
[1:21:56] us about thousands times
[1:21:59] ten thousands of demonic spirits that
[1:22:02] have been
[1:22:03] loosed they've not been loosed against
[1:22:06] the nations of the earth
[1:22:08] they've not been loosed against an
[1:22:10] apostate church
[1:22:11] but they have been turned on the bride
[1:22:14] of jesus christ sometimes you feel the
[1:22:18] swirl
[1:22:19] sometimes you feel the repercussions of
[1:22:22] the attacks
[1:22:23] of the enemy in the bride of christ
[1:22:26] we may have it pretty good here in the
[1:22:29] united states of america
[1:22:31] where it comes to our freedom where it
[1:22:34] comes to our ability to
[1:22:36] be in church and to worship god
[1:22:39] according to
[1:22:39] to the dictates of our heart we know
[1:22:42] many of our brethren
[1:22:44] we're particularly thinking this morning
[1:22:46] about the saints of god in nigeria
[1:22:49] who are being murdered by the thousands
[1:22:52] even as we speak nigerian christians
[1:22:56] are being slaughtered as they gather
[1:23:00] to the house of god on sunday
[1:23:03] then they are mowed down and
[1:23:06] we have such a freedom such a privilege
[1:23:10] nobody tried to stop you physically
[1:23:14] coming in except that old dragon he'd be
[1:23:17] the only one
[1:23:18] thank god the government wasn't standing
[1:23:20] out there in the driveway
[1:23:22] when you arrived the doors had been
[1:23:24] unlocked for you to come in
[1:23:26] there was no big padlock on the door
[1:23:28] like there
[1:23:29] is in churches in ontario ontario canada
[1:23:33] even right now as we speak but
[1:23:37] you know we are still under a great
[1:23:39] assault
[1:23:41] and we are still under a great attack
[1:23:44] it's that
[1:23:44] greatest battle ever fought that brother
[1:23:47] branham preached about
[1:23:49] it's the assault of the mind it is the
[1:23:52] warfare
[1:23:54] of the mind it may not have the same
[1:23:57] physical
[1:23:58] ramifications or repercussions but i
[1:24:00] want you to know it'll wear you out
[1:24:03] it will weary your flesh it will
[1:24:06] discourage your soul
[1:24:08] it will even pull your spirit into a
[1:24:10] bent
[1:24:11] place and so you cannot
[1:24:14] you cannot get slack you cannot get lazy
[1:24:19] in this warfare against that lying
[1:24:22] accuser
[1:24:23] the devil you have to know who you
[1:24:26] are you have to know whose
[1:24:30] you are you have to value the price
[1:24:34] that has been paid on your behalf i was
[1:24:37] reading this morning about seven o'clock
[1:24:39] in a message book where brother branham
[1:24:42] was talking about
[1:24:43] god's blood i want you to know
[1:24:47] i don't ever get tired of hearing about
[1:24:50] that blood
[1:24:51] it wasn't the chemistry it wasn't the
[1:24:54] color
[1:24:55] it wasn't the in the natural makeup of
[1:24:57] that blood
[1:24:58] it was the life cell of god that was in
[1:25:01] that blood
[1:25:03] i tuned in just a moment last night
[1:25:06] was by myself a little while while they
[1:25:09] were volleyballing
[1:25:10] i can only take so much of the heat like
[1:25:12] that and uh
[1:25:14] i'd had it i just had had enough
[1:25:17] and so i was at home by myself and i
[1:25:19] just tuned in to a little
[1:25:21] uh archive of a service that was in
[1:25:24] virginia
[1:25:25] a week or two ago and brother joe green
[1:25:28] was
[1:25:29] preaching and uh his dad
[1:25:32] brother henry greene was a dear friend
[1:25:34] of mine and a great encouragement to me
[1:25:37] in the early days of beginning to preach
[1:25:39] this truth
[1:25:40] and brother joe is i don't mean now
[1:25:43] anything negative
[1:25:45] but he is bald-headed he
[1:25:48] i guess he shaves what little bit of
[1:25:50] hair he has off i don't really know
[1:25:52] but it is a polished head he has
[1:25:55] and his son nate is a friend of mine
[1:25:59] and he's just as just as polished as his
[1:26:02] dad
[1:26:03] and nate was a i guess kind of a
[1:26:07] seemingly a little bit late baby i may
[1:26:09] be wrong about that
[1:26:10] but i remember when he was just a little
[1:26:12] boy how much energy he had
[1:26:14] well now he's married and he has a
[1:26:17] little
[1:26:17] son whose name is charlie and charlie
[1:26:21] was i think premature and he went
[1:26:23] through a lot
[1:26:24] we followed it in prayer he went through
[1:26:26] a lot he spent a long time
[1:26:29] in the in the intensive care and god
[1:26:32] just brought him through it was just
[1:26:33] wonderful how the lord brought him
[1:26:35] through and he's loved i want you to
[1:26:37] know that little fellows loved
[1:26:39] and charlie happened to be in that
[1:26:41] service too
[1:26:42] and so did nate and brother uh
[1:26:45] green he said come up here nate and
[1:26:48] they're both large men now they didn't
[1:26:50] used to be but they're both large men
[1:26:51] now
[1:26:52] both shiny bald head dressed
[1:26:55] kind of similar and here come charlie
[1:26:58] they handed him up there
[1:26:59] and i want you to know he don't have
[1:27:01] much hair on his head either
[1:27:03] and and it's a sight to see it it's like
[1:27:06] an older and then a younger and then a
[1:27:09] younger
[1:27:10] and they all look alike there'd be no
[1:27:12] way in the world that
[1:27:13] any of the three of them could deny each
[1:27:15] other
[1:27:16] i loved what brother joe said after that
[1:27:19] he said it you see it's my genes
[1:27:25] that are expressed in nate
[1:27:30] and in charlie that's how it works
[1:27:33] he said you know nate is built a little
[1:27:36] bit more like my dad he said than i am
[1:27:39] but he said i'm working on that i'm ex
[1:27:41] i'm expanding too
[1:27:43] and it was it's genes its
[1:27:46] dna that causes there to be such a
[1:27:49] strong
[1:27:50] family resemblance in the green family
[1:27:54] i got excited before the punchline
[1:27:58] i was already shouting hallelujah before
[1:28:00] the punchline came
[1:28:02] because this is what the bride has been
[1:28:04] called to do
[1:28:06] we are to be the expression of the very
[1:28:09] dna
[1:28:10] of the very genes of a living god
[1:28:13] that was the life that was in that blood
[1:28:16] and that
[1:28:17] life is now in you it has fallen on you
[1:28:21] you approached him in faith
[1:28:25] you obeyed him in repentance he
[1:28:28] sanctified you by the washing of the
[1:28:30] water of the word
[1:28:32] to follow your justification and then
[1:28:35] baptized you with that zoy
[1:28:39] life god's own
[1:28:42] life if you remember that
[1:28:45] you have all the ammunition you need
[1:28:49] to shut down the accuser
[1:28:52] amen but in a weak moment
[1:28:56] when you don't feel the strength maybe
[1:28:59] you don't
[1:28:59] feel like you carry the gene of god
[1:29:02] maybe you're not feeling like a glorious
[1:29:05] overcomer
[1:29:06] we get that way sometime then you still
[1:29:10] have no excuse to lose
[1:29:13] because we have an advocate
[1:29:18] hallelujah we have one to
[1:29:22] stand up on our behalf even when we
[1:29:25] cannot stand up
[1:29:27] for ourselves he's always there
[1:29:30] to stand up on our behalf my what a
[1:29:33] blessed people we are
[1:29:35] so i can't spend all my time focusing on
[1:29:38] my accuser
[1:29:42] i've got to focus on the advocate
[1:29:45] the one who's stepping up for me
[1:29:48] hallelujah
[1:29:49] you know that old accuser he's like a
[1:29:51] prosecutor
[1:29:52] always easy very easy to find fault
[1:29:56] points the finger of blame accuses us
[1:30:00] with guilt
[1:30:01] and he's going for the death penalty i
[1:30:04] want you to know
[1:30:05] if satan could kill you
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:11] you'd already be dead
[1:30:14] you've been on his radar since way
[1:30:16] before you had a new birth
[1:30:20] he was standing around in the heavenly
[1:30:23] places
[1:30:24] when you were a thought in the mind of
[1:30:27] god
[1:30:29] he heard some of the discussions that
[1:30:32] went on
[1:30:32] among the heavenly hosts and you might
[1:30:35] have even been
[1:30:36] in the conversation so you've been on
[1:30:39] his radar
[1:30:40] way before you had a new birth before
[1:30:44] you were ever expressed
[1:30:45] in the spirit of christ in this hour he
[1:30:48] already knew
[1:30:49] your choice he already knew your
[1:30:52] destination
[1:30:53] he already knew your struggles because
[1:30:55] he was there feeding
[1:30:57] he was there doing everything that he
[1:30:58] possibly could all along the way
[1:31:01] to intensify those things that you were
[1:31:03] vulnerable to
[1:31:05] he magnifies constantly our
[1:31:08] vulnerabilities
[1:31:10] we all have them help me preach we all
[1:31:12] have those
[1:31:13] tender spots
[1:31:17] and the enemy's always there he's he's
[1:31:19] just really
[1:31:20] something i hope i'm not smiling
[1:31:25] i don't want to smile when i say he's
[1:31:27] something because you can't
[1:31:29] express that meaning great really
[1:31:32] something he's not something
[1:31:35] he's something he really is
[1:31:38] he is twisted
[1:31:42] he's twisted and uh he is the father
[1:31:45] of lies john chapter 8
[1:31:49] verse 40 44 excuse me let's read that
[1:31:52] ye are of your father the devil
[1:31:56] who he's not talking to the rank sinners
[1:32:00] here
[1:32:01] he's talking to the religious here
[1:32:05] you're of your father the devil
[1:32:08] and the lusts of your father ye will do
[1:32:12] he was a murderer from the beginning
[1:32:20] oh we're not going to break that down
[1:32:23] and cause a disturbance this morning but
[1:32:25] he was a
[1:32:26] this is jesus talking he was a murderer
[1:32:29] from the beginning
[1:32:31] it was already in him when he was
[1:32:34] created
[1:32:38] it was already in judas
[1:32:41] when judas was created it was already in
[1:32:44] the devil
[1:32:46] when he was created as lucifer
[1:32:51] certainly was jesus said he was a
[1:32:53] murderer from the
[1:32:54] beginning and abode not in the truth
[1:32:57] because there is
[1:32:58] no truth no
[1:33:01] truth in him any truth
[1:33:05] that he ever peddles and he will
[1:33:08] occasionally pedal a little bit of truth
[1:33:11] he has to borrow it
[1:33:13] how do we know that because he when he
[1:33:16] tells lies
[1:33:17] he hooks he places him those lies
[1:33:20] hooks elements of truth
[1:33:26] you know the garden of eden you know he
[1:33:29] didn't come in there
[1:33:30] and tell her everything opposite of what
[1:33:32] she had been told
[1:33:34] he just put a little hook in there that
[1:33:37] would that would be enough
[1:33:38] truth that she would consider it
[1:33:42] but a big enough lie to cause her
[1:33:45] to give everything to yield everything
[1:33:49] to a diabolical a plot or plan
[1:33:52] that was about to make a lot of death
[1:33:54] and a lot of destruction
[1:33:56] but yet was a very part a big part a
[1:33:59] huge part
[1:34:00] of the plan of god for my redemption for
[1:34:04] your redemption
[1:34:06] he said you you were of your of your
[1:34:08] father the devil a murderer from the
[1:34:09] beginning and he abode not in the truth
[1:34:12] because there is no truth in him when he
[1:34:14] speaketh a lie
[1:34:16] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[1:34:19] and the father of it how many of you
[1:34:21] have ever told him when he was praying
[1:34:24] when you were rebuking or resisting
[1:34:26] somebody said i get confused with them
[1:34:28] pentecostals
[1:34:29] because sometimes they're praying to
[1:34:31] jesus and sometimes they're talking to
[1:34:33] the devil
[1:34:33] at the same time
[1:34:37] we do it i know i'm not the only one
[1:34:41] that'll pray a while and rebuke the
[1:34:43] devil a while i guess you need to be a
[1:34:45] little more
[1:34:46] uh careful about the salutation and and
[1:34:49] make sure you're changing gears and
[1:34:51] okay now i'm talking to you devil and
[1:34:53] all that but i got a feeling he knows
[1:34:56] he knows he knows what you're doing
[1:35:01] you're telling him you're of the father
[1:35:04] of all
[1:35:05] you're a filthy liar i've told him that
[1:35:07] recently
[1:35:08] you're a filthy liar and the father of
[1:35:11] all eyes
[1:35:12] he'll tell you it'll never change he'll
[1:35:14] tell you it'll never be any different
[1:35:16] than it is right now
[1:35:17] he'll tell you she'll never be any
[1:35:19] different he'll tell you he'll never be
[1:35:22] any different
[1:35:23] he doesn't get to make that choice
[1:35:26] the devil doesn't decide who changes and
[1:35:28] who doesn't change
[1:35:30] it's a holy ghost that changes men's
[1:35:33] lives
[1:35:34] and women's lives for the glory of god
[1:35:39] he'll tell you that situation you're in
[1:35:41] he'll depress you in your marriage
[1:35:44] because everything is not just like you
[1:35:46] would like for it to be
[1:35:48] and he will depress you he'll make you
[1:35:51] think you're the only one struggling
[1:35:53] he'll make you think he'll he'll make
[1:35:55] ever you'll look around in everybody's
[1:35:57] marriage oh
[1:35:57] my they just look so purty
[1:36:04] they're just kissing each other good
[1:36:06] morning and kissing each other good
[1:36:08] night and
[1:36:09] kissing each other at breakfast kissing
[1:36:11] each other
[1:36:12] lunch never have a crossword
[1:36:17] he'll make you think you're the only one
[1:36:24] that huffs and puffs stomps her foot
[1:36:28] shuts the door vehemently you know
[1:36:35] it's been a long time
[1:36:39] and i hope it will be but you all laugh
[1:36:42] because i've told you the story
[1:36:44] when when my wife and i first got
[1:36:45] married she'd just tell me sometime when
[1:36:47] i was
[1:36:48] really putting it right she would just
[1:36:51] say
[1:36:52] she would just say talk to the hand
[1:36:57] i'd say come here and bring me that hand
[1:37:03] but thanks be to god we didn't kill each
[1:37:05] other
[1:37:09] you know we realized that the enemy is
[1:37:12] not happy
[1:37:13] if you have one healthy relationship
[1:37:17] in your life the devil is not happy
[1:37:22] he wants all of them to be messed up
[1:37:26] he wants all of them to be out of whack
[1:37:29] come on because he wants to turn around
[1:37:31] and tell you what are the benefits of
[1:37:33] serving god your marriage is no happier
[1:37:35] than somebody else is out there in the
[1:37:36] world
[1:37:37] that's a dirty lie because the only way
[1:37:40] a marriage can be successful
[1:37:42] is to be with jesus to do it with him
[1:37:45] if you try to do it without him it'll be
[1:37:47] a mess
[1:37:50] i'm thinking about these working on
[1:37:51] their second and getting ready to
[1:37:53] put that one's already put away working
[1:37:55] on the third and some are already
[1:37:57] already got their eyes on the fourth
[1:37:58] i'm going to tell you something you
[1:38:00] better get your eyes in the mirror
[1:38:05] you better find out what's wrong with
[1:38:07] you
[1:38:11] you know we think it's got to be the
[1:38:12] other one all the time all the time it's
[1:38:14] got to be the other one
[1:38:15] and when you're working on a trophy
[1:38:17] collection like that
[1:38:19] and stacking them side by side you
[1:38:22] better make sure you got some of your uh
[1:38:24] you know stuff arranged
[1:38:29] even a godly marriage with jesus christ
[1:38:32] between the husband
[1:38:33] and the wife it can be rough it can be
[1:38:37] rocky at times you know when you're
[1:38:40] in the in a little bit of a strife or
[1:38:42] there's a little something going on like
[1:38:44] that
[1:38:45] you would almost advise some young
[1:38:47] couple not to do it
[1:38:51] but once uh once that little yes i said
[1:38:54] it
[1:38:55] look at me like that
[1:39:00] but when everything's settled you want
[1:39:02] everybody to have that bliss
[1:39:05] when everything's good between you and
[1:39:07] your wife you want the whole world to
[1:39:08] feel that
[1:39:10] so just don't give advice when you're
[1:39:12] having troubles at home
[1:39:14] because listen god can rescue all of
[1:39:16] that
[1:39:17] it's the accuser that gets in the middle
[1:39:20] it's the enemy that try he does
[1:39:22] listen i told you a moment ago and i got
[1:39:25] to move on he would kill you
[1:39:26] if he could i don't buy that doctrine
[1:39:29] i'm sorry
[1:39:30] that's not a doctrine i believe i do not
[1:39:33] believe that the
[1:39:34] enemy has power to kill me whenever he
[1:39:36] gets ready to kill me
[1:39:38] when you find out if you do if
[1:39:41] if i'm if i leave before you do and you
[1:39:44] found out i'm dead don't you let
[1:39:45] nobody say if it was this afternoon and
[1:39:49] i'm gone
[1:39:50] don't you let anybody say the devil did
[1:39:52] it i don't belong
[1:39:54] to him i belong to the advocate
[1:39:57] i belong to the savior i belong to the
[1:40:00] messiah
[1:40:01] i don't serve a god whose enemy is
[1:40:03] stronger than he
[1:40:04] is i serve a god that knows how
[1:40:08] to deal with the enemy the only reason
[1:40:11] why we struggle the way we
[1:40:12] we do is because we forget who's
[1:40:14] standing up for us
[1:40:16] when you can stand up for yourself in
[1:40:18] the power of his might do it
[1:40:20] when you can stand up and quote
[1:40:22] scripture to the enemy
[1:40:23] and tell him it's written and tell him
[1:40:25] who your god is
[1:40:27] and tell him who you are do it
[1:40:30] but in that weak moment when you don't
[1:40:32] even feel like a christian
[1:40:34] if perhaps you don't even feel like
[1:40:36] you're a part of god's economy
[1:40:38] don't you you still have no excuse to
[1:40:40] lose
[1:40:41] it's in that moment that you have to say
[1:40:43] holy ghost
[1:40:45] holy ghost are you listening holy ghost
[1:40:49] i need you to stand up jesus my advocate
[1:40:54] i need you to stand up brother shelly
[1:40:56] are you going to mismix the two
[1:40:59] are you going to call both jesus and the
[1:41:00] holy ghost the advocate i am
[1:41:03] are you going to call both jesus and the
[1:41:05] holy ghost the comforter i am
[1:41:08] do you know why because the word is the
[1:41:10] same
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:13] the greek word is parakletos it's the
[1:41:16] same word
[1:41:17] the same word that calls jesus your
[1:41:20] advocate is the same word that calls the
[1:41:22] holy ghost
[1:41:23] your comforter it's not two different
[1:41:26] words
[1:41:26] because it's not two different spirits
[1:41:30] it's the same manifest it's a different
[1:41:32] manifestation of the same spirit
[1:41:35] anybody with me now that's you ought to
[1:41:38] get settled on that that's something to
[1:41:39] help us
[1:41:40] that's something to help us now his old
[1:41:42] sly tactic
[1:41:44] boy this makes me i hate to say it in
[1:41:46] the pulpit
[1:41:47] this makes me mad enough to spit when i
[1:41:50] think about this
[1:41:51] was that offensive
[1:41:54] he first he entices us
[1:42:01] to sin to think to choose
[1:42:05] to move forward based on our unbelief
[1:42:09] if he can get you in a moment of doubt
[1:42:13] if he can get you in a place where
[1:42:15] unbelief is screaming at you
[1:42:16] then he is there just like this
[1:42:20] to entice you as long as you're standing
[1:42:22] still
[1:42:24] even when there's a little unbelief
[1:42:26] creeping in you may still
[1:42:28] be all right because you may recognize
[1:42:31] it by the help of the helper
[1:42:33] same word by the way advocate comforter
[1:42:37] helper
[1:42:39] you may recognize it by his help and you
[1:42:41] may be able to do something on your own
[1:42:44] but if you don't then his purpose
[1:42:47] in this
[1:42:50] enticement is to get you to make a move
[1:42:55] out of your unbelief you see we spoke
[1:42:58] last sunday
[1:42:59] and we talked about the fact that
[1:43:01] brother branham had a revelation of sin
[1:43:03] that the pentecostals didn't have in his
[1:43:05] day
[1:43:06] he saw that you're not going to get
[1:43:09] anywhere
[1:43:10] if all you're doing is preaching on
[1:43:11] drinking and smoking and cussing and
[1:43:13] running with those who do and all this
[1:43:15] kind of stuff you're never going to get
[1:43:17] to the root
[1:43:19] of where the problem lies he said these
[1:43:22] are the attributes of sin
[1:43:24] these are the outworkings of sin but the
[1:43:27] root
[1:43:29] are you with me the foundation of all
[1:43:32] sin is unbelief
[1:43:34] and if you can deal with the unbelief
[1:43:37] you have power
[1:43:39] to pull down the attributes of sin to
[1:43:42] say i will
[1:43:43] not smoke my life away i will
[1:43:47] not drink my life away i will
[1:43:50] not be impure sexually but i will stand
[1:43:54] before god
[1:43:55] with both clean hands and a pure heart
[1:43:57] you can do that
[1:43:58] when you start dealing with the root of
[1:44:01] the behaviors
[1:44:03] these are the behaviors that go with sin
[1:44:05] but it's the unbelief
[1:44:06] and if the enemy can get you to make a
[1:44:08] move
[1:44:09] if you can he can get you to make a
[1:44:11] choice
[1:44:13] if he can get you to make a decision
[1:44:15] that comes out of unbelief
[1:44:18] he is setting up a paradigm wake up
[1:44:20] folks
[1:44:22] you sleep this afternoon get a good nap
[1:44:24] don't get it now
[1:44:26] if he can get you to to move to step
[1:44:30] forward with that unbelief in your heart
[1:44:34] then everything you do will be cursed
[1:44:38] if you're building on a foundation of
[1:44:40] unbelief you're going to build a house
[1:44:43] that the enemy can huff and puff
[1:44:47] and blow it right over but if you're
[1:44:50] building on the foundation of faith
[1:44:53] the solid rock the lord jesus christ
[1:44:57] you're going to build a house for god
[1:45:00] that
[1:45:00] no weapon formed against it
[1:45:03] will be able to prosper no floods will
[1:45:07] be able to drown it no fire will be able
[1:45:09] to burn it
[1:45:10] no tornado would be able to blow it away
[1:45:13] it's built on the foundation of faith
[1:45:16] it's on the solid rock of jesus christ
[1:45:18] but if you start building on unbelief
[1:45:22] i don't care how pretty it looks i don't
[1:45:24] care how successful you look i don't
[1:45:25] care how many raises you get
[1:45:28] that's not favor one little blow
[1:45:32] and it's all gone but you build your
[1:45:35] life on solid rock
[1:45:36] faith in jesus christ and i want you to
[1:45:39] know
[1:45:40] you may you may bend a little
[1:45:44] but every time you do your roots will go
[1:45:45] down
[1:45:47] deeper and deeper and deeper on that
[1:45:49] rock so whatever you do don't move
[1:45:52] out of your unbelief don't make a
[1:45:54] decision
[1:45:55] don't choose a job please don't choose a
[1:45:59] companion
[1:46:01] don't choose a vacation plan on your
[1:46:04] unbelief
[1:46:06] because if you do you'll bring yourself
[1:46:08] into a very vulnerable position
[1:46:10] and god doesn't want us living in that
[1:46:12] kind of a place he wants us to be solid
[1:46:14] in him
[1:46:15] so every time we move out of unbelief or
[1:46:18] choose out of unbelief
[1:46:19] we're going to get in trouble then if
[1:46:22] and when
[1:46:22] we do if we do and we do some time we do
[1:46:25] make
[1:46:26] decisions based on our little feelings
[1:46:31] and any feeling that will take you away
[1:46:33] from christ is unbelief
[1:46:35] it's based on unbelief in fact any
[1:46:37] emotion
[1:46:38] that will take you away from christ it's
[1:46:40] based on unbelief you've got to dig that
[1:46:42] out by the root
[1:46:43] somebody said you can't tell me how to
[1:46:45] feel i tell you what i can tell you by
[1:46:46] the word
[1:46:47] you can tear down those thoughts
[1:46:54] i want you to know you can't be hurt
[1:46:55] unless you choose to be
[1:46:57] i'm not trying to be ugly i've been hurt
[1:46:59] i know what it feels like but you may
[1:47:01] you have to make a choice
[1:47:04] and you can also choose the duration
[1:47:08] you can choose how long it lasts you can
[1:47:11] just say i'm gonna wait on nobody i'm
[1:47:12] gonna wait on nobody ain't gonna wait on
[1:47:14] nobody
[1:47:15] i'm getting out of there i'm pulling
[1:47:16] myself up i've got the advocate
[1:47:20] i've got the holy ghost on board i got
[1:47:22] the comforter on board
[1:47:23] i got the advocate on board i got the
[1:47:26] helper on board
[1:47:28] got the savior on board i'm coming up
[1:47:31] out of this
[1:47:32] i'll give you a quote in a minute i'll
[1:47:35] show you what he said in a minute
[1:47:37] you got to get out of the cellar you got
[1:47:40] to get out of the basement
[1:47:42] you've got to make a choice to get up
[1:47:44] and if you can't get up by yourself let
[1:47:46] me tell you the good news
[1:47:49] he lives in you hallelujah
[1:47:53] he knows how to fly you up the stairs
[1:47:55] that you can't climb
[1:47:56] he knows how to soar you to the top of
[1:47:58] the mountain that you can crawl up on
[1:48:00] your own
[1:48:02] he's for us hallelujah
[1:48:06] and you don't have to get in his good
[1:48:08] graces
[1:48:10] by holding your mouth just right
[1:48:13] come on you're his you're bought with a
[1:48:16] price his word has said it
[1:48:19] but if he can get you to make a decision
[1:48:22] based on your unbelief
[1:48:23] and choose the attributes of sin
[1:48:26] whatever they look like in your life
[1:48:29] guess what he does then
[1:48:31] somebody said well i guess he just rolls
[1:48:32] over and leaves you alone or he just
[1:48:34] runs off like a dog with us
[1:48:35] are you listening maybe he just tucks
[1:48:38] his tail between his legs and runs off
[1:48:40] ah you think that's what he does no
[1:48:44] he jumps on your back
[1:48:51] he led you he deceived you
[1:48:56] he he magnified your vulnerability
[1:49:00] until you made a choice to cooperate
[1:49:03] with unbelief and it took an attribute
[1:49:07] it took an
[1:49:08] overflow whatever it was
[1:49:13] because lying find out that there's a
[1:49:15] great temptation these days for even
[1:49:17] christian people to lie
[1:49:20] you've got to fight that devil you've
[1:49:23] got to win
[1:49:24] because there's not supposed to be a lie
[1:49:26] in you he's the father
[1:49:28] of all lies the truth will hurt sometime
[1:49:31] but i tell you what it better come out
[1:49:32] of your mouth
[1:49:34] or you better be quiet because if the
[1:49:37] enemy can get a hook in you like that
[1:49:40] you will live in an augmented reality
[1:49:42] the holy ghost spoke to me just recently
[1:49:45] driving alone in my automobile when i
[1:49:47] was in prayer
[1:49:48] and he showed me that in this hour there
[1:49:51] are those who step
[1:49:52] out of reality into an augmented
[1:49:55] reality into a place of cr
[1:49:58] of their own creation they didn't have
[1:50:01] to do it by their self
[1:50:03] totally because they've got a devil
[1:50:06] and they start living in an alternate
[1:50:08] reality
[1:50:11] they tell every story out of that
[1:50:13] alternate reality
[1:50:15] they they face every situation in that
[1:50:18] place of reality
[1:50:19] and when you boil it all down it's not
[1:50:21] about anybody else it's about themselves
[1:50:26] and when somebody is like that it is a
[1:50:28] deception
[1:50:30] and you will not get help until you
[1:50:33] recognize that you are addicted
[1:50:36] to that deception i tell you it hit me
[1:50:39] so
[1:50:40] hard we become addicted
[1:50:44] to our version of what's happening to
[1:50:48] us and you know we become dependent
[1:50:53] on that kind of aversion of what's
[1:50:56] happening to us
[1:50:57] there's a there's a truth speaker who
[1:51:00] lives in you
[1:51:02] by the power of the holy ghost in every
[1:51:05] way the devil is a liar and the father
[1:51:07] of all
[1:51:08] eyes the holy ghost in you is truth
[1:51:11] and he is a truth speaker and if you
[1:51:14] will listen to him
[1:51:16] instead of your accuser if you will
[1:51:18] cooperate with your advocate
[1:51:21] instead of with your accuser the holy
[1:51:24] ghost will provide you with the weapons
[1:51:26] you need
[1:51:28] to defeat the enemy it's
[1:51:31] in our power because he's placed it
[1:51:34] there
[1:51:35] brother branham said the enemy has no
[1:51:37] power
[1:51:41] the only thing he has is what we release
[1:51:45] if you've been given authority and you
[1:51:47] release that authority the enemy's there
[1:51:50] and he will operate illegitimately
[1:51:54] in a stolen authority
[1:51:58] come on now he will
[1:52:01] he always wants to hijack god's great
[1:52:04] purpose and plan
[1:52:05] in your life and you can lay down and
[1:52:07] let him if you want to
[1:52:09] or you can make a decision today today
[1:52:13] that you have the advocate on board
[1:52:15] that's why you need to know you've got
[1:52:16] the holy ghost
[1:52:17] not so you can talk in tongues
[1:52:22] not so you can have a feeling
[1:52:25] a feeling they're cheap i love to feel
[1:52:29] the presence of god
[1:52:30] don't you misunderstand me but feelings
[1:52:32] are cheap
[1:52:33] i could get a pretty good feeling with a
[1:52:35] pretty good bowl of ice cream
[1:52:39] but that don't give me the power i need
[1:52:41] to whoop the devil
[1:52:42] come on now maybe yours is cake
[1:52:46] brother carries his pastry we had that
[1:52:48] little little conversation yesterday in
[1:52:51] the ice cream line
[1:52:52] he's kind of fond of that more than a
[1:52:54] cookie
[1:52:55] i i like a cookie with my ice cream
[1:52:58] [Laughter]
[1:53:00] let me tell you something the enemy
[1:53:03] knows exactly
[1:53:05] how to push you
[1:53:09] to prod you into an entirely dif listen
[1:53:13] hollywood knows hollywood knows about
[1:53:17] alternative reality
[1:53:18] they know about augmented reality they
[1:53:21] know how
[1:53:23] they know how to create things to keep
[1:53:25] you wondering
[1:53:27] about which reality you're watching
[1:53:32] which version you're watching
[1:53:36] because it just repeats and repeats and
[1:53:38] repeats and you don't know how to follow
[1:53:40] it
[1:53:40] you don't even know what what what realm
[1:53:43] it's in
[1:53:44] or what kind of reality is being played
[1:53:46] i see it as another way
[1:53:48] that the enemy wants to bog you down he
[1:53:51] has no power over you
[1:53:52] if you don't release it to him he has no
[1:53:54] authority over you
[1:53:56] unless you release it to him now what
[1:53:58] that means is you got to gather your
[1:53:59] stuff
[1:54:01] your weapons that are given to you you
[1:54:02] got to gather them up you've got to
[1:54:04] listen
[1:54:06] you've got to take care of your tools
[1:54:08] [Applause]
[1:54:12] i was thinking about brother richard
[1:54:15] when i said that
[1:54:17] because we've had conversations in the
[1:54:19] past i'm glad ben's nodding
[1:54:24] we've had a conversation in the past
[1:54:27] about how frustrating it is
[1:54:30] to miss your tools
[1:54:36] because somebody borrowed them and i
[1:54:37] want you to know that when they borrowed
[1:54:39] them
[1:54:41] david i believe it was david david let's
[1:54:43] preach on david
[1:54:46] you got to borrow something ben's glad
[1:54:48] i'm off to be in a minute
[1:54:50] david got to borrow something to brother
[1:54:52] greeley's because he's so good to return
[1:54:54] it until he didn't
[1:55:01] epic fail on that brother you better get
[1:55:04] that back
[1:55:07] brother richard used to say i i know i
[1:55:09] had it i saw it
[1:55:11] and then i didn't
[1:55:14] he said well they'll just come they'll
[1:55:16] just come it's been a long time since we
[1:55:18] had this conversation
[1:55:19] zach is guilty too wherever he is
[1:55:22] he said they'll just come get it
[1:55:26] and then i'll look for it i won't be
[1:55:28] able to find it i'll tell you what's
[1:55:29] worse than that
[1:55:31] it's when you're up in the woods
[1:55:32] somewhere and find it
[1:55:39] that'll really get you you know you
[1:55:41] ain't been up there nailing
[1:55:43] nails in a tree
[1:55:46] 75 nails in a tree you know you had
[1:55:49] better things to do with your time than
[1:55:50] that
[1:55:52] but one of them youngins you were so
[1:55:53] proud of
[1:55:57] borrowed your beautiful shiny craftsman
[1:56:00] hammer
[1:56:02] and left it up in the woods to rust
[1:56:06] you better take care of your tools
[1:56:10] you better take care of your power
[1:56:14] you better take care of the authority
[1:56:16] that god's given you
[1:56:18] you better sharpen your sword
[1:56:23] you better watch your confession
[1:56:26] because every bit of this are tools that
[1:56:28] we've been given
[1:56:30] to defeat the enemy are you with me
[1:56:33] so that old devil i gotta hurry
[1:56:37] that old devil he'll entice you he'll
[1:56:39] get you to move and make a decision
[1:56:41] based on your unbelief
[1:56:43] and then instead of leaving you alone
[1:56:44] and say hey i got one more in my column
[1:56:47] he will jump on your back that
[1:56:50] slimy slow-footed imp
[1:56:53] he will climb on your back and hold on
[1:56:58] your your neck becomes his harness his
[1:57:00] reigns
[1:57:02] and he will hold on to you with
[1:57:04] everything that he has
[1:57:07] to weigh you down to shame you
[1:57:11] to guilt you to condemn
[1:57:15] you and he will even confuse
[1:57:19] you so that you think it's the spirit of
[1:57:23] god
[1:57:24] dealing with you and you will
[1:57:27] sometimes misunderstand the condemnation
[1:57:31] of the enemy
[1:57:32] for the convicting of the holy spirit
[1:57:34] you got to get your voices
[1:57:36] distinguished you and i have got to know
[1:57:39] who's talking to us
[1:57:42] and quite often both are
[1:57:46] if you think the devil talks in your ear
[1:57:55] well i can do a lot better than that i
[1:57:58] wasn't practicing
[1:58:01] if you think that's how he comes i used
[1:58:03] to say it like this one i've
[1:58:05] preached back in the 10 days i used to
[1:58:07] say if you think the devil will come to
[1:58:09] you like he does on the can of deviled
[1:58:11] ham
[1:58:14] with horns and a pitchfork and that's
[1:58:16] what you're looking for to know who he
[1:58:18] is
[1:58:19] you're never going to recognize the
[1:58:20] devil he transforms himself
[1:58:23] into an angel of light he has even been
[1:58:27] known to appear
[1:58:28] in a form that looked like the lord
[1:58:31] jesus christ
[1:58:35] several of our early apostolic fathers
[1:58:38] had visitations from a christ-like
[1:58:41] being who was not jesus christ
[1:58:45] but but uh none other than the devil
[1:58:49] who had transformed himself into an
[1:58:51] angel of life to deceive you've got to
[1:58:53] not
[1:58:53] just know the sound of his voice
[1:58:57] so i tell you he can throw his voice how
[1:59:00] many of you believe he's the best
[1:59:02] ventriloquist that's ever lived
[1:59:06] you just believe if you don't believe
[1:59:07] that just go out in the world and hear
[1:59:09] him talk
[1:59:11] he'll talk to you in a v in a in a body
[1:59:14] of a waitress
[1:59:16] he'll talk to you in the body of a
[1:59:17] cashier
[1:59:20] he'll talk to you by someone pushing a
[1:59:22] cart next to yours
[1:59:24] in walmart i'm going to tell you
[1:59:26] something you better be careful the way
[1:59:27] you drive
[1:59:29] i've been telling my sons and i hope
[1:59:31] you'll pray for them both of them are
[1:59:34] are driving today and
[1:59:37] joshua would have been driving at three
[1:59:39] o'clock this morning
[1:59:41] and his mother and i just felt like that
[1:59:42] wasn't going to work him by itself
[1:59:44] and so we we said don't you just stay
[1:59:48] right there
[1:59:49] and you come home later today benjamin
[1:59:51] is in salt lake city
[1:59:53] are gone already now driving to
[1:59:55] washington
[1:59:57] estate and then they will be driving
[2:00:00] from washington state to texas this week
[2:00:02] to be home for next weekend i want you
[2:00:04] to pray for them if you think of it
[2:00:06] please
[2:00:06] while they're on the road i've told them
[2:00:09] both be careful how you treat other
[2:00:11] drivers
[2:00:13] be as courteous as you can even if they
[2:00:17] make you mad
[2:00:18] and i don't get mad often just every
[2:00:20] time i get in the car
[2:00:23] i see the way people do and i'm just
[2:00:25] wondering who gave them their license i
[2:00:27] think they got it in a crackerjack box
[2:00:30] they surely didn't get it at the
[2:00:31] department of motor vehicle
[2:00:33] but you react just right and you get a
[2:00:36] bullet
[2:00:39] you read of a precious child killed in a
[2:00:41] road rage accident
[2:00:42] because somebody shot into the vehicle
[2:00:45] and you say
[2:00:46] uh that is you know that happens out
[2:00:48] there i guess some people that
[2:00:50] i guess that man in the in the marriott
[2:00:52] parking lot wouldn't have thought it
[2:00:54] would have happened to him i guess those
[2:00:55] people across the river in downtown
[2:00:56] columbus this weekend they wouldn't have
[2:00:58] thought somebody would have come along
[2:00:59] and shot them
[2:01:00] the one that he shot saturday in
[2:01:02] columbus downtown
[2:01:03] i don't think he probably was expecting
[2:01:05] to get shot they caught him
[2:01:06] finally after shooting people on both
[2:01:10] sides of the river
[2:01:11] none of them have passed away but all of
[2:01:14] them were shot
[2:01:15] the motive hasn't come out i don't know
[2:01:17] what it will be
[2:01:18] they're just calling him a serial
[2:01:20] shooter but i want you to know
[2:01:22] there are people around you all the time
[2:01:24] in this world
[2:01:25] that are on the last millimeter
[2:01:29] of their fuse
[2:01:33] i tell them i tell them please be
[2:01:34] careful i don't care if they cut you off
[2:01:36] and run you in the ditch
[2:01:38] you do the best you can to pull yourself
[2:01:40] out of the ditch and go on to the best
[2:01:41] of your ability
[2:01:42] unless you're in my vehicle during my
[2:01:44] vehicle stay out of the ditch at all
[2:01:46] possible stab the ditch
[2:01:50] that's the world that we live in
[2:01:53] and the enemy is always looking for ways
[2:01:56] to get over on you after he has enticed
[2:02:00] us and he
[2:02:01] flops on our back weighing us down
[2:02:04] to condemn us he will
[2:02:08] encourage us to do it and then we do it
[2:02:11] and he calls us a loser
[2:02:13] because we yielded to his voice did what
[2:02:17] he said you know i'm telling you the
[2:02:18] truth
[2:02:19] i want you to know the health department
[2:02:22] will come along every now and again
[2:02:24] and they will condemn a dilapidated
[2:02:27] house
[2:02:28] they stamp a mark they put a put a sign
[2:02:31] on it with a
[2:02:32] nail it on the door hang it on the fence
[2:02:35] and
[2:02:35] they say this is this is dilapidated
[2:02:39] and we are declaring this unfit
[2:02:42] for occupancy that's the enemy's goal
[2:02:48] if that is condemning a house that's
[2:02:50] exactly what the enemy wants to do
[2:02:52] he wants to cause you to feel like
[2:02:56] that you are unfit for occupancy but he
[2:03:00] doesn't get to choose who lives in your
[2:03:02] house
[2:03:05] you get to choose now if you're on your
[2:03:08] phone instead of listening to me put it
[2:03:10] down before i come and get it
[2:03:17] if i need help beth will come with me
[2:03:22] he will absolutely try
[2:03:26] to decide who lives in your house
[2:03:31] condemn you and say you're not even fit
[2:03:36] for jesus to come in hell you're not fit
[2:03:39] for the holy ghost
[2:03:40] look what you thought look what you did
[2:03:43] look what you chose yeah you chose
[2:03:46] exactly
[2:03:46] what he talked you into choosing
[2:03:50] i'm not making an excuse for you you've
[2:03:53] got to discern
[2:03:55] oh i'm so confused brother shelly i'm so
[2:03:57] confused i don't know who's talking to
[2:03:59] me i
[2:04:00] i don't recognize let me tell you
[2:04:01] something you will not be confused
[2:04:03] if you fill your life with the word of
[2:04:05] god you will recognize what god says
[2:04:08] you will recognize what god thinks you
[2:04:10] will recognize how god moves
[2:04:13] because he reveals himself
[2:04:16] he reveals himself in his word
[2:04:19] you don't ever have to be deceived by
[2:04:22] any other voice
[2:04:23] if you are familiar with what he thinks
[2:04:26] what he says how he operates it's
[2:04:29] revealed to us in the word
[2:04:31] it's revealed to us in the message of
[2:04:33] the hour you can say amen
[2:04:35] his goal is to condemn you to declare
[2:04:37] you unfit for use
[2:04:41] god can't even use you he'll whisper in
[2:04:43] your ears you've failed too many times
[2:04:45] god won't forgive you you're unworthy
[2:04:47] he'll never use you again
[2:04:50] but i'm telling you again john 8 44 he's
[2:04:53] the liar
[2:04:54] and the father of it could i have the
[2:04:57] quote how can i overcome i got to hurry
[2:05:00] how can i overcome good good question
[2:05:02] isn't it
[2:05:03] good good sermon how can i overcome 1963
[2:05:06] paragraph 104
[2:05:08] he said look temptation
[2:05:12] was for him you know that
[2:05:18] 1963
[2:05:24] paragraph 104 it should be there
[2:05:27] i see you're looking hard for it
[2:05:31] i'll just i'll just take a water break
[2:05:32] and if we don't find it that's all right
[2:05:34] we'll just read on for years we just had
[2:05:36] to read them with no
[2:05:37] no way for you to read them
[2:05:43] i like to put them there because i've
[2:05:45] had many people say it helps them
[2:05:48] especially if there's any stumbling in
[2:05:50] the in the expression at all
[2:05:52] then it's kind of if there's an extra uh
[2:05:55] or a pause or something then sometimes
[2:05:58] it helps us a lot to be able to see it
[2:06:00] in print
[2:06:01] but i'm going to read on look temptation
[2:06:04] was for him you know what
[2:06:06] excuse me you know that the bible said
[2:06:09] he was tempted
[2:06:11] in all points like we are
[2:06:14] yet without sin if you want that
[2:06:16] scripture reference you can jot this
[2:06:17] down it's hebrews 4 15
[2:06:19] for we have not an high priest which
[2:06:22] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[2:06:23] our infirmities
[2:06:24] but was in all points tempted like as we
[2:06:26] are yet without sin
[2:06:28] oh my what a high priest what an
[2:06:30] advocate
[2:06:32] what a comforter what a helper
[2:06:34] hallelujah
[2:06:35] all point tempted as we are yet without
[2:06:38] sin
[2:06:39] he was tempted by drinking oh my i don't
[2:06:44] know if there's any pentecostal ears
[2:06:45] here but
[2:06:46] by denomination but if there is you're
[2:06:48] gonna you're gonna choke
[2:06:53] i just know what the bible said i may
[2:06:55] not be all that smart but i know what
[2:06:57] all means
[2:07:00] there may be some words i have to look
[2:07:02] up but all ain't one of them
[2:07:03] i know what all means all means all
[2:07:06] right but the band said by drinking he
[2:07:08] was tempted by women he was tempted by
[2:07:09] everything
[2:07:10] i just kind of cause
[2:07:17] i just i just cannot stand for someone
[2:07:19] to to to pull down the lord
[2:07:22] or to or to bring him down and make him
[2:07:24] look carnal well i want you to know
[2:07:26] your religious spirit
[2:07:29] is blinding you from seeing what has
[2:07:32] been accomplished in your life
[2:07:34] because that's exactly what the father
[2:07:36] did
[2:07:38] came all the way down
[2:07:42] not to live like a superhero not to live
[2:07:45] in the body of an angel
[2:07:47] not to live in a theophany body he came
[2:07:50] all the way down bless his holy name
[2:07:52] to live in a physical earthly body
[2:07:55] tempted
[2:07:56] in all manner as we are yet
[2:07:59] without sin so that you and i can
[2:08:03] understand
[2:08:04] that it is not uncommon to man to be
[2:08:06] tempted by
[2:08:07] all of these things but you don't have
[2:08:10] to yield to unbelief
[2:08:14] he was tempted by everything that could
[2:08:16] be tempted by
[2:08:17] he was tempted by everything that we are
[2:08:20] he was a man
[2:08:21] and yet you couldn't put a mark on him
[2:08:24] yes sir
[2:08:25] paragraph 105 overcome
[2:08:28] means to recognize listen to what
[2:08:31] overcome means
[2:08:32] overcome means
[2:08:37] is it straight
[2:08:40] overcome you always might as well help
[2:08:42] me one way if you're not going to help
[2:08:43] me another right
[2:08:45] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[2:08:48] every one of his tricks
[2:08:50] how are you going to overcome the enemy
[2:08:51] if you can't recognize him when he comes
[2:08:54] huh we've got to recognize him
[2:08:57] he said a lot of people said there's no
[2:08:59] devil it's just a thought
[2:09:01] don't you believe that i'm hurrying this
[2:09:04] is me and fast forward
[2:09:06] don't you believe that that's a there is
[2:09:08] a real devil he's just as real as you
[2:09:10] are
[2:09:10] or anybody else a real devil and you
[2:09:12] must recognize him real
[2:09:14] you must know he's the devil then the
[2:09:16] same time you recognize him
[2:09:18] you know that he's the devil he's
[2:09:19] against you then to overcome
[2:09:22] you must recognize whoop you must
[2:09:26] recognize that the god
[2:09:28] in you hello i wish you all could see
[2:09:32] this somehow i
[2:09:33] missed it you must recognize
[2:09:36] that the god in you is greater
[2:09:41] and mightier than he is
[2:09:45] that the one that's already in you the
[2:09:48] one that's in you
[2:09:49] that the one that's in you has already
[2:09:52] overcome him
[2:09:54] watch this and by his grace
[2:09:58] you are more than a match
[2:10:01] for him somebody say by his grace
[2:10:08] without it he'll clobber you
[2:10:13] without it the devil will tie you in a
[2:10:14] knot like a pretzel
[2:10:17] without it he'll defeat you eleven dozen
[2:10:19] different ways
[2:10:21] but with the grace of god you are more
[2:10:23] than a match
[2:10:27] that's just what the bible said this
[2:10:29] isn't brother brandon i'm just thinking
[2:10:30] of something to say
[2:10:31] the bible said greater
[2:10:34] greater
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:39] is he that is in you
[2:10:43] than he that is in the world
[2:10:46] oh thank you jesus thank you jesus

[2:12:07] we have an advocate we have an accuser
[2:12:12] we have an adversary but we have an
[2:12:14] advocate
[2:12:16] in a message called what is the holy
[2:12:18] ghost paragraph 134
[2:12:23] we have this and it's powerful to hear
[2:12:28] he said the body of christ
[2:12:32] is one spirit
[2:12:35] where every member from
[2:12:38] pentecost to this time
[2:12:42] drinks of the same new wine
[2:12:47] the same holy ghost
[2:12:50] bringing forth the same
[2:12:54] results how do we do it
[2:12:58] by one spirit
[2:13:03] let me ask you all the question do you
[2:13:04] see the document there with the
[2:13:06] with today's date or you don't you don't
[2:13:08] have it at all
[2:13:10] all right it's
[2:13:13] god's open door
[2:13:17] the holy spirit he said
[2:13:20] what is it it's god's open door
[2:13:24] he said it's a sign it's a seal it's a
[2:13:26] comforter
[2:13:28] it's an advocate it's an assurance
[2:13:32] it's rest it's peace
[2:13:36] it's goodness it's healing
[2:13:39] it's life he's talking about the holy
[2:13:42] ghost
[2:13:45] he's talking about the holy ghost
[2:13:49] it's god's open door the holy spirit
[2:13:53] what is it it's god's open door it's a
[2:13:56] sign it's a seal
[2:13:57] it's a comforter it's an advocate it's

[2:14:07] it's healing it's life it's god's open
[2:14:10] door
[2:14:11] it's god's open door to christ
[2:14:14] he said god provided that he raised
[2:14:17] jesus up from the dead and those that
[2:14:20] are dead in christ
[2:14:21] will god bring with him at the
[2:14:24] resurrection
[2:14:25] grieve not the holy spirit whereby you
[2:14:27] were sealed into christ
[2:14:29] until the day of your redemption phew
[2:14:31] how many believes it
[2:14:33] i believe it how many of you believe
[2:14:35] he's a sign he's a seal he's a comforter
[2:14:37] he's an advocate he's assurance he's
[2:14:39] rest he's peace he's goodness
[2:14:41] he's healing he's life whoa
[2:14:45] he is hallelujah
[2:14:48] we're nearly done let me read hebrews
[2:14:51] chapter two number two
[2:14:53] this is the hebrew series paragraph 172
[2:14:57] through 174 man always
[2:15:01] feared death christ
[2:15:05] became sin made low to take death
[2:15:08] upon himself and he's not ashamed to be
[2:15:11] called our brother
[2:15:13] for he was tempted just like we are
[2:15:15] tempted and he can be
[2:15:17] the right kind of intercessor
[2:15:26] we have an adversary we have
[2:15:29] an accuser but we have an intercessor
[2:15:34] we have an advocate hallelujah
[2:15:38] whoa you just have to forgive me if you
[2:15:41] need to
[2:15:43] because he stood the same kind of
[2:15:45] temptation
[2:15:46] that you stand he took your place
[2:15:50] knowing that you couldn't take it
[2:15:51] yourself i want you to know
[2:15:53] that the devil would not succeed in
[2:15:56] anything
[2:15:57] if he killed you your
[2:16:00] death would make only a difference
[2:16:04] to those who loved you to those who
[2:16:07] cared for you
[2:16:08] and most of us face the reality it's a
[2:16:12] harsh reality
[2:16:13] but most of us have faced the reality
[2:16:15] that if we died tonight the sun would
[2:16:18] come up in the morning
[2:16:20] just like it did this morning it would
[2:16:22] set
[2:16:23] tomorrow evening just like it was set
[2:16:25] this evening
[2:16:27] and in the great scheme of things you
[2:16:29] and i are passing on
[2:16:31] wouldn't make much of a difference so
[2:16:33] the devil rather than to just kill you
[2:16:36] he'd like to if he could but he knows
[2:16:38] that he's a little bit limited in his
[2:16:39] power to do that
[2:16:40] so what he really wants to do is torment
[2:16:42] your mind
[2:16:46] i wish you'd help me so that you live
[2:16:50] way down here below who you are in
[2:16:54] christ
[2:16:55] i'm not stopping until i get to that
[2:16:56] quote so you might as well just hold on
[2:16:58] another minute or two
[2:17:00] he said he took your place knowing that
[2:17:02] you can
[2:17:03] couldn't take it yourself he said so
[2:17:06] don't you see brother sister
[2:17:08] the whole thing is grace whoa
[2:17:12] hallelujah oh some people say well when
[2:17:15] i listen to that brother branham you
[2:17:16] know it just seemed like he's all about
[2:17:18] works
[2:17:21] seem like he's always telling the women
[2:17:23] how to dress somebody
[2:17:26] ought to tell them how
[2:17:30] it is a fact that most of
[2:17:33] them around us are insane
[2:17:38] because they'll go right to town in
[2:17:40] their underwear
[2:17:42] now if that's not insanity i don't know
[2:17:44] what it is
[2:17:45] go right in the public in their
[2:17:47] underwear and you know it's true so if
[2:17:49] he did spend a little bit of time
[2:17:50] telling people then god bless him
[2:17:54] but he wasn't hanging anybody's
[2:17:56] salvation
[2:17:58] on that he knew that it was not our
[2:18:02] works that saves
[2:18:04] us but our works do demonstrate our
[2:18:08] faith
[2:18:11] this is how we show faith by how we work
[2:18:15] by how we live by how we behave
[2:18:19] you know it's right but he's clear here
[2:18:22] so don't misunderstand
[2:18:24] he said the whole thing is grace all of
[2:18:26] its grace
[2:18:27] it's not what you do anyhow it's what
[2:18:30] he's already done for you does that
[2:18:31] sound
[2:18:32] does that sound like a legalistic
[2:18:33] preacher to you not to me
[2:18:36] not to be it's what he's already done
[2:18:39] for you
[2:18:40] he said now you can't do one thing to
[2:18:42] merit your salvation
[2:18:43] lord have mercy i wish you tell somebody
[2:18:46] you can't do one thing
[2:18:47] to deserve it
[2:18:52] on my best day i've never deserved him
[2:18:55] whoa on the day i slept maybe i was sick
[2:18:58] somewhere
[2:18:58] years ago somewhere along the way and
[2:19:00] slept all day
[2:19:01] didn't have time to be bad but even on
[2:19:05] that day
[2:19:06] i didn't deserve him no
[2:19:09] siree you can't do one thing to merit
[2:19:11] your salvation your salvation is a gift
[2:19:13] christ became sin that you might become
[2:19:16] righteous
[2:19:17] and he's the right kind of a chief
[2:19:19] captain of our salvation
[2:19:21] because he suffered just like we
[2:19:22] suffered he's been tempted just like
[2:19:24] we're tempted and he's not ashamed
[2:19:26] to be called our brother hallelujah
[2:19:32] because
[2:19:34] because he knows what we go through
[2:19:39] he knows what we go through with old
[2:19:41] blessed be his name
[2:19:42] for verily he took not on him the form
[2:19:44] of angels but he took on the seed of
[2:19:46] abraham oh
[2:19:48] i'm i've got to hurry here he said oh my
[2:19:52] he didn't become an angel he become the
[2:19:56] seed of abraham
[2:19:58] and we being dead in christ take on
[2:20:02] abraham's seed and her heirs
[2:20:05] oh i guess i'm yelling or not we are
[2:20:08] heirs according
[2:20:09] to the promise see he never took on the
[2:20:12] form of an angel never become an angel
[2:20:14] he become a man
[2:20:15] he become the seed of abraham he took
[2:20:16] the sting of death in his own flesh
[2:20:22] so that when you die you don't have to
[2:20:24] feel
[2:20:25] the sting of death
[2:20:28] he took it in his own flesh to reconcile
[2:20:32] us
[2:20:34] back to god whoo
[2:20:37] and now sets there that's what i want
[2:20:39] you to hear again
[2:20:40] sets there for an intercessor
[2:20:44] my how could we reject you don't you
[2:20:45] tell me you've got two intercessors
[2:20:48] you've got jesus the advocate and the
[2:20:50] holy ghost
[2:20:51] no no no no same spirit
[2:20:56] oh what jesus accomplished for you
[2:21:00] uh with you and uh outside of you
[2:21:04] is glorious but that same jesus
[2:21:08] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[2:21:11] come to you
[2:21:12] same jesus same spirit same spirit same
[2:21:14] spirit
[2:21:15] whoa what he's doing on in on the inside
[2:21:18] of you
[2:21:19] is so great he's the right kind of
[2:21:21] intercessor
[2:21:22] now let me do this quickly oh 119. i've
[2:21:25] got a few minutes thank you
[2:21:27] the greek word paracletos is translated
[2:21:30] advocate here
[2:21:31] in 1st john the scripture we read that
[2:21:33] jesus is our advocate let me give you
[2:21:35] the reference again
[2:21:36] first john 2 1. i'm leaning a little bit
[2:21:38] i'm sorry i'm leaning i
[2:21:40] do that sometime toward the end not
[2:21:42] because i'm about to pass out or
[2:21:44] anything like that
[2:21:45] but i strain my sciatica
[2:21:48] and uh friday night i i strained it
[2:21:51] somehow i don't know what i did exactly
[2:21:52] i certainly wasn't preaching hard
[2:21:54] but somehow i strained it and i was
[2:21:56] having a real struggle
[2:21:57] and in worship i could feel it so i just
[2:21:59] sat down just a minute not to sit down
[2:22:00] on worship but to just rest because i
[2:22:02] knew i had to stand here
[2:22:04] so please forgive me if i lean just a
[2:22:06] little bit it's not because i want to be
[2:22:08] casual
[2:22:09] about this this is serious business this
[2:22:11] morning isn't it it's not some sloppy
[2:22:13] business so forgive me please
[2:22:15] he said now he's not ashamed to be
[2:22:17] called our brother hallelujah
[2:22:19] he took on abraham no excuse me the
[2:22:22] greek word parakletos
[2:22:24] translated advocate here in 1st john
[2:22:28] the address one more time 2-1
[2:22:32] is also same word paraquatos
[2:22:35] translated comforter same word four
[2:22:38] times
[2:22:39] in reference to the holy ghost the same
[2:22:41] word is used to describe
[2:22:43] jesus the advocate and the holy ghost
[2:22:47] our comforter i don't know if that helps
[2:22:49] you at all
[2:22:50] but that helped me i thought here's
[2:22:52] another proof
[2:22:55] there's another it's not another spirit
[2:22:57] it's not a counterfeit it's not a it's
[2:22:59] not a duplicate of
[2:23:00] it's the same spirit the same spirit
[2:23:02] that was in christ
[2:23:03] the very same spirit that was in christ
[2:23:05] is now in you
[2:23:07] he did say that didn't he somebody ought
[2:23:09] to read the book of john
[2:23:11] somebody ought to read the book of john
[2:23:13] it's there for you
[2:23:14] let me give you an example john 14 16 he
[2:23:17] said and i will pray the father and he
[2:23:19] shall give you
[2:23:20] another comforter that he may abide with
[2:23:22] you forever
[2:23:23] that word comforter is the exact same
[2:23:25] word for advocate
[2:23:27] it's paraquitos it's the same word
[2:23:30] used to describe the work that jesus
[2:23:32] does in our life
[2:23:34] that was john 14 16.
[2:23:37] in john 14 26 which one of the girls was
[2:23:41] it that
[2:23:42] was weeping because they couldn't write
[2:23:44] it all down abby
[2:23:51] i would i tell you that's a treasure
[2:23:54] that's a real moment
[2:23:55] to remember we heard that at the
[2:23:56] graduation she just crawled up in her
[2:23:59] daddy's arms
[2:24:00] very sad you could hardly understand her
[2:24:02] she was so broken and
[2:24:04] she just finally got it out what was
[2:24:06] wrong with her she just couldn't write
[2:24:07] it all down in church
[2:24:09] she was making notes like she'd been
[2:24:11] encouraged to do
[2:24:12] but she just couldn't write it all down
[2:24:15] i don't know anybody that could honey
[2:24:16] i'll be honest
[2:24:18] although i see some of these notebooks
[2:24:20] and and see people writing the whole
[2:24:22] time
[2:24:22] but i don't believe they get it all to
[2:24:24] you if they just ask me i'd give them a
[2:24:26] copy this is not copyrighted material
[2:24:28] i'd be glad to share it john 14 26 is
[2:24:31] the next one
[2:24:32] write that down abby you got a pen
[2:24:35] but the covener which is the holy ghost
[2:24:40] whom the father will send in my name
[2:24:44] wow now we're getting another office
[2:24:47] of god involved here same spirit he
[2:24:50] shall teach you
[2:24:51] all things here is another identifying
[2:24:54] ministry of the holy ghost
[2:24:57] he's a teacher aren't you glad
[2:25:02] oh i really appreciate this
[2:25:05] you that are maybe less than 50 you
[2:25:07] don't know how to appreciate this
[2:25:09] but i do and bring all things to your
[2:25:13] remembrance
[2:25:14] i know this is about promises and and so
[2:25:17] forth but i need that i
[2:25:18] need to remember who i am
[2:25:21] and what has been said about me because
[2:25:24] of whose i
[2:25:25] am whatsoever i have said unto you so
[2:25:28] that word comforter there is the same
[2:25:30] paracletos that is translated advocate
[2:25:33] in first john
[2:25:34] and one and two more john 15 26 just go
[2:25:38] home and read
[2:25:39] john 14 john 15 and john 16. read all
[2:25:42] three chapters
[2:25:43] this is powerful powerful truth here
[2:25:46] verse 26 of 15
[2:25:48] but when the comforter is come whom i
[2:25:51] will send
[2:25:52] unto you from the father even the spirit
[2:25:55] of truth
[2:25:56] which proceedeth from the father
[2:26:04] so it must be the father spirit
[2:26:07] i thought it was jesus's spirit i
[2:26:10] thought it was the holy spirit
[2:26:12] hmm you know how you're supposed to
[2:26:16] respond to that the word amen amen amen
[2:26:19] it's all three it is a spirit that
[2:26:21] proceeded from the father it is the
[2:26:23] spirit of jesus christ
[2:26:24] it is the holy spirit working in our
[2:26:26] life there are three very distinct
[2:26:28] operations of god and the god had no
[2:26:29] doubt about it
[2:26:30] but there's only one spirit only one
[2:26:33] holy spirit
[2:26:34] only one eternal spirit thank you jesus
[2:26:38] it helps me a lot and the last one is
[2:26:41] john 16
[2:26:41] 7. nevertheless i tell you the truth
[2:26:45] it is expedient for you necessary that i
[2:26:48] go away
[2:26:48] for if i go not away here's the key
[2:26:53] here's the key jesus is saying there
[2:26:56] can't be two
[2:26:57] permanent demonstrations of god in the
[2:27:00] earth
[2:27:01] at the same time that's not the plan of
[2:27:03] god we're still in
[2:27:04] this and this was the introduction of
[2:27:06] the church ages here they're about to
[2:27:07] enter into the church age period
[2:27:09] and during that church age period god
[2:27:11] was going to operate the same god
[2:27:13] but in very distinct ways and jesus is
[2:27:16] telling you here
[2:27:17] i'd love to stay with you oh my i'm
[2:27:19] enjoying myself here
[2:27:22] and believe me they wanted him to stay
[2:27:25] but i'll tell you the truth it's
[2:27:26] necessary
[2:27:28] it's expedient it's to your benefit
[2:27:32] that i go away for if i go not away the
[2:27:35] comforter will not come
[2:27:37] unto you but if i depart
[2:27:40] i will send him unto you
[2:27:44] don't forget he also says i will come to
[2:27:47] you
[2:27:48] how can that be said because he is the
[2:27:51] same
[2:27:52] are you still with me do we have any of
[2:27:55] the other quotes
[2:27:56] the comforter do we have that one
[2:28:00] i want to read two more and close oh
[2:28:02] that's good
[2:28:03] pastor just do more
[2:28:06] we can give you a few more minutes
[2:28:10] good paragraph 147
[2:28:14] of the comforter what is it
[2:28:18] god's word anchored in your flesh
[2:28:22] that gives you eternal life
[2:28:26] that gives you the resurrection power to
[2:28:29] bring you from the things of the world
[2:28:32] from blind traditions of man to walk i
[2:28:35] like this phrase i wish you wish you
[2:28:36] could see it
[2:28:38] to walk in the sunlight s-o-n
[2:28:41] not s-u-n to walk in the s-o-n light
[2:28:46] of the health of god the sunlight
[2:28:50] of the health of god i don't know about
[2:28:53] you but i want to get in that sunlight
[2:28:56] i'm not a s-u-n worshiper but i am an
[2:28:59] s-o-n worshiper
[2:29:00] and i want to turn my face right toward
[2:29:02] the s-o-n
[2:29:03] and get underneath god's health
[2:29:08] that's wholeness that's completion
[2:29:11] fullness now listen to this
[2:29:15] lord thank you so much to walk in the
[2:29:18] sunlight
[2:29:19] of the health of god and look at this
[2:29:22] next phrase here
[2:29:23] that's what the comforter does
[2:29:27] this is what i wanted to read i can i
[2:29:28] don't have to read two now i can stop a
[2:29:30] one
[2:29:31] because i wanted to get to this one it
[2:29:34] lifts you out of that
[2:29:38] cellared condition is that even a word
[2:29:42] it is now
[2:29:46] because god's kentucky gentleman just
[2:29:48] made it a word
[2:29:51] i love it i know i didn't have to look
[2:29:52] it up i knew exactly what it meant
[2:29:54] that's what's so wonderful about this
[2:29:55] kind of a ministry
[2:29:57] it's not so far above our heads that we
[2:30:00] have to try to figure out what he meant
[2:30:02] oh aren't you glad i know it's beneath
[2:30:05] some of you
[2:30:06] your fine education
[2:30:12] i had a woman throw a book at me one
[2:30:13] time she said i couldn't follow that
[2:30:15] babbling
[2:30:16] she said how in the world would you ever
[2:30:17] expect me to follow that stammering and
[2:30:19] stuttering
[2:30:20] and and i can't even follow his thought
[2:30:22] i said well you really should be careful
[2:30:25] i'm not going to be religious here but
[2:30:27] you really should be careful that's kind
[2:30:28] of an awful thing to say
[2:30:30] and i said but don't worry about it sis
[2:30:32] there's enough of us bumpkins
[2:30:36] that god loved so much to give us a
[2:30:39] truth
[2:30:39] in a language and in a vocabulary that
[2:30:41] we can understand
[2:30:44] hallelujah so he said
[2:30:46] god that comforter listen what the
[2:30:48] comforter does it lifts us
[2:30:50] out of that cellared condition
[2:30:56] you know what that's like hanging around
[2:30:58] in those dank spaces
[2:31:00] you know what it's like to be hanging
[2:31:02] around down in that that uh
[2:31:05] oh i'm gonna i thought come to my mind

[2:31:08] you get out of here
[2:31:14] you know how the spiders creep
[2:31:24] they just build their webs

[2:31:32] one old light bulb hanging down from the
[2:31:34] ceiling
[2:31:36] we used to have to keep all kind of
[2:31:38] flashlights and batteries to get down
[2:31:40] now we just told our phone

[2:31:46] door slams

[2:32:12] living spaces

[2:32:16] their home but i've been in some that
[2:32:18] was not an extension of anybody's home
[2:32:20] it was just a place where all
[2:32:22] gasoline smelled like gasoline because
[2:32:24] the old weed eaters had been
[2:32:26] tucked under there and the old lawn
[2:32:28] mowers tucked under there and
[2:32:30] all had drains in the bottom because the
[2:32:32] water would seep in
[2:32:33] and had to drain out you down there in
[2:32:36] that cellar
[2:32:37] you couldn't live like that long in that
[2:32:39] dark and in that terrible environment
[2:32:42] but oh i have good news for i'm gonna

[2:34:51] he didn't just lead me to the kitchen he
[2:34:54] didn't just lead me to the living room
[2:34:56] or the parlor but he led me all the way
[2:34:59] into the place of intimacy
[2:35:02] that's the message for the bride he took
[2:35:04] you all the way into the bedroom
[2:35:07] because there was a oneness that god
[2:35:09] longed to have let the musicians make
[2:35:12] their way this way please
[2:35:14] he longed to have fellowship with you
[2:35:19] behind that closed door behind the veil
[2:35:22] of his flesh
[2:35:23] oh yes i'm going to do the last one
[2:35:26] because it's short
[2:35:28] hello i've been preaching my battery low
[2:35:30] in my in my pooter here
[2:35:34] questions and answers on the holy ghost
[2:35:37] paragraph 43
[2:35:39] that little that little booklet i don't
[2:35:40] know if you have it or not how many of
[2:35:41] you have the holy ghost booklet
[2:35:43] you ought to read it again you ought to
[2:35:46] read it again i remember reading it one
[2:35:48] time and feeling just just my
[2:35:49] my impression was my that's that's
[2:35:52] really simple i wasn't i wasn't saying
[2:35:54] that in a critical way
[2:35:56] but i just don't mind that you know he's
[2:35:58] just really saying the things that we
[2:35:59] know about the holy ghost
[2:36:01] but boy i've read it recently i went
[2:36:03] through it again recently and i
[2:36:05] i saw layers and it's the sermons uh
[2:36:10] what is the holy ghost what is the holy
[2:36:12] ghost given for
[2:36:15] uh questions and answers on the holy
[2:36:16] ghost what else is in that little
[2:36:18] booklet
[2:36:19] i don't know if we have any extra ones
[2:36:23] here but you could get it online you can
[2:36:26] read this holy ghost series online
[2:36:30] from 59 i think it is yes
[2:36:33] but in the one on questions yeah
[2:36:36] december of 59
[2:36:39] this is from questions and answers on
[2:36:41] the holy ghost
[2:36:43] which is 12 19 december 19th of 59.
[2:36:46] i love this it's short he said and we
[2:36:49] find
[2:36:50] out that the holy ghost is
[2:36:53] god himself in you
[2:37:01] lord of mercy i've heard people try to
[2:37:02] explain it didn't make no sense
[2:37:05] it made no sense at all and when they
[2:37:09] when they had gone on for two hours or
[2:37:12] trying to make it easy it was more
[2:37:15] mysterious
[2:37:17] than it had ever had to be in the
[2:37:19] beginning and i finally told one brother
[2:37:21] i said if you don't quit talking about
[2:37:23] the mystery of the trinity
[2:37:26] nobody's going to even think that they
[2:37:28] can believe god or know god
[2:37:30] there is no scripture that says there's
[2:37:33] a
[2:37:33] deep mystery of the trinity the only
[2:37:36] reason why it's mysterious is it was
[2:37:39] man-made
[2:37:40] it was a roman catholic creed
[2:37:43] it had nothing to do with the scripture
[2:37:46] at all
[2:37:47] if i'm stepping on your toes i'm sorry
[2:37:52] bring your steel boots next time
[2:37:55] because it really gets my goat sometime
[2:37:58] when i think about that when when
[2:38:01] preachers
[2:38:02] are so confused in in trying to explain
[2:38:04] it and then
[2:38:05] the only way they know how to end it is
[2:38:07] just to finally say but
[2:38:09] it's the mystery of the trinity
[2:38:12] so don't expect to ever understand it
[2:38:18] i don't believe that if you do you're
[2:38:20] alone
[2:38:22] i don't believe that here's what i
[2:38:23] believe we find out the holy ghost is
[2:38:26] god himself in you
[2:38:28] god was above you in the pillar of fire
[2:38:30] with moses
[2:38:31] god was with you in jesus christ now god
[2:38:35] is in you
[2:38:36] in the holy ghost no
[2:38:39] three gods no three gods one
[2:38:43] god working in three
[2:38:46] offices no mystery
[2:38:51] no mystery a beautiful
[2:38:55] i want you to know the most amazing
[2:38:59] i don't want to call it a plot because
[2:39:01] sometimes i say that and people think of
[2:39:03] you know like uh plotting wrong but when
[2:39:06] i say it i mean
[2:39:07] like you're watching a film and it has a
[2:39:11] story line
[2:39:13] there is no greater storyline
[2:39:16] than god's redemption plan
[2:39:19] i mean he could have sat on the throne
[2:39:21] for the whole thing
[2:39:22] and watched it all roll away but instead
[2:39:25] he chose
[2:39:26] to come down and actively
[2:39:30] play a role what a role he played help
[2:39:33] me
[2:39:34] what a role he played died on the cross
[2:39:38] suffered oh felt it all
[2:39:41] suffered died shed
[2:39:45] blood for you and i that we wouldn't
[2:39:48] have to live down in the cellar
[2:39:51] sometimes when i hear people talking
[2:39:54] about the struggles of life
[2:39:57] i wonder if people hear them would they
[2:39:59] ever want to be a christian
[2:40:02] i don't mean we should deny the
[2:40:04] realities of of
[2:40:06] depression i've lived it you're gonna
[2:40:09] have a hard time coming talking to me
[2:40:10] about how depression works
[2:40:12] because i've lived it but i've chosen
[2:40:15] and i choose today and by god's grace
[2:40:18] i'll choose tomorrow
[2:40:20] to know that i've got somebody with me
[2:40:24] i've got somebody with me that chose
[2:40:27] to help me get out
[2:40:33] he helped me he helped me how many of
[2:40:35] you has ever helped you
[2:40:37] how many of god ever helped you get out
[2:40:38] of the basement how many of you the
[2:40:40] lord's ever lifted you up out of that
[2:40:42] place of despair
[2:40:43] oh yes oh yeah so yes oh yes oh yes sir
[2:40:46] yes
[2:40:47] oh yes i almost i almost yeah i guess
[2:40:49] you could save this
[2:40:50] i guess i could save it but i'm not
[2:40:51] going to
[2:40:56] i just always say with this this two
[2:40:59] hours with me on sunday morning
[2:41:02] it's a whole lot shorter than an hour
[2:41:04] and a half on sunday morning an hour and
[2:41:05] a half on sunday night that'd be three
[2:41:07] hours
[2:41:08] so three minus two is you're saving a
[2:41:10] whole hour
[2:41:12] i'm giving you this veteran daylight
[2:41:14] savings time to come to church here on
[2:41:15] sunday morning
[2:41:17] huh how many of you have ever read the
[2:41:20] book the pilgrim's progress
[2:41:22] i almost gave this to the girls but i
[2:41:24] didn't because the wording the language
[2:41:26] of it you know
[2:41:27] i thought you might even want to see it
[2:41:30] but in his book
[2:41:32] and and i i was my wife and i were in
[2:41:34] england
[2:41:35] many times and one time we were there
[2:41:37] they took us to the
[2:41:38] is it bedford they took us to the
[2:41:40] village where john bunyan lived
[2:41:43] and they took us to the prison they
[2:41:45] showed us the door
[2:41:47] the door of the prison where john bunyan
[2:41:50] was
[2:41:51] how he was mistreated what he went
[2:41:53] through and how he wrote this amazing
[2:41:56] classic
[2:41:57] that some people still have never taken
[2:41:58] the time to read called the
[2:42:00] pilgrims progress and they've got even
[2:42:04] they've even got uh you know when i say
[2:42:07] more modern they've got easier to read
[2:42:09] versions of it now they've even got
[2:42:10] children's versions don't they
[2:42:12] kids version children that that just
[2:42:14] kind of
[2:42:15] i think maybe this is maybe this is too
[2:42:17] commercial i don't have any for sale so
[2:42:19] i guess i can say it
[2:42:20] they even made it a board game for young
[2:42:23] ones
[2:42:24] to play to show them well oh my goodness
[2:42:27] if you're going to play apples and cart
[2:42:28] apple apples and ladders shoots and
[2:42:31] ladders
[2:42:36] if you're going to play shoots and
[2:42:37] ladders then surely you could play
[2:42:39] this game because this is a real journey
[2:42:41] we're talking about
[2:42:44] he describes in his book
[2:42:47] a battle between the accuser apollon
[2:42:51] and christian the main character
[2:42:55] and it took place in the valley of
[2:42:57] humiliation
[2:42:59] i know that a lot of us would very much
[2:43:02] like to
[2:43:03] fast forward past the valley of
[2:43:07] humiliation
[2:43:09] but there's only one way to get to the
[2:43:11] celestial city
[2:43:12] and that's to follow the path anybody
[2:43:15] want to help me
[2:43:16] one of apollon's ploys is to recite
[2:43:20] a laundry list of christians
[2:43:24] sins i don't know if you remember this
[2:43:27] from the book
[2:43:28] but listen to this thou didst faint
[2:43:31] at first setting out when thou
[2:43:34] wast almost choked in the gulf
[2:43:38] of despond
[2:43:43] anybody ever spent time in the gulf of
[2:43:45] this bond
[2:43:47] or in the valley of despair or in the
[2:43:50] valley of humiliation
[2:43:55] thou didst attempt wrong ways
[2:43:58] to be rid of thy burden whereas thou
[2:44:02] shouldst have stayed till thy prince
[2:44:05] had taken it off thou didst sinfully
[2:44:09] sleep
[2:44:11] and lose thy choice thing
[2:44:14] thou wast also persuaded to go back
[2:44:17] at the sight of the lions and when thou
[2:44:20] talkest on thy
[2:44:21] journey and of what thou hast heard and
[2:44:25] seen thou art inwardly desirous of vain
[2:44:29] glory in all that thou
[2:44:33] sayest or doest
[2:44:36] this was the laundry list of accusations
[2:44:40] against poor old christian
[2:44:43] who had been through a whole lot if
[2:44:44] you've read the book one more time
[2:44:46] who's read read it you think you've read
[2:44:48] it all the way through
[2:44:50] i want you to hear what christian
[2:44:53] responded
[2:44:55] to the accuser it was
[2:44:58] full of humility and faith
[2:45:01] he said all this
[2:45:04] is true if you want a fool with the
[2:45:07] devil
[2:45:08] [Music]
[2:45:11] just be humble he does not know what to
[2:45:15] do
