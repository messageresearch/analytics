Description:
“Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.” Isaiah 54:16–17

set aside to meet together corporately to lift up his name you may be seated wow what a day we had yesterday Josiah and Jennifer we welcome you all to your first service as a newly married couple that must have been the shortest honeymoon in history thank you all for being back already [Applause] takes dedication and the desire to be faithful to the Lord and to his house to choose to be together with Saints the day after your wedding and we appreciate that so much we only call attention to it because we believe it's been marked in heaven I believe God marks things like this the Bible said that there that we know that there's a book of of a record a book of memory written and uh especially he keeps up with those who meet together in his name and I believe it pleases the heart of the Lord when a couple says may not be the easiest thing to do but this is what we're going to do and may God bless your trip that you're about to make your honeymoon may God bless you in a wonderful way and be with you and give you a great time off work and and I wish you could have three months I wish that it was possible that you could do that but may God let the days that you have be a blessing to you what a beautiful wedding if I I could just say if there's one thing New Hope can do right they can do a wedding that that was absolutely outstanding it was put together so beautifully every part of that wedding glorified the Lord and I sat at the reception with some of the best wedding food I have ever eaten in my life and was so blessed and thankful for it and I looked around the room and I thought oh I feel like the proudest Papa in the room to see this great church this great family of God together loving one another and honoring Josiah and Jennifer and their commitment to one another so for everything you did to make yesterday an absolute amazing day I even want to thank the butterflies they cooperated although many of us were prophesying their defeat they took flight and we were thankful for that there wasn't a bit of sun to be had but they they were so glad to be out of that box finally I thought to myself they're either going to all be dead or they're going to fly and they flew and the kids couldn't have been happier about it I mean that was that was very special for them the music was wonderful and the anointing and the presence of the Lord and and I I don't like all those speeches and things that that you all kind of brought that here from Canada but uh uh you know when I was growing up in the South you got a piece of cake you got some pastel colored mints and a bowl of nuts and some punch and that was a reception but we you get you get mixed in with these Canadians and they start bringing influence and then everybody wants to keep up with the next one and before you know it we all got a really nice time out of it and even though I'm not fond of all those speeches I have to say that you all did absolutely outstanding yesterday you captured these two and you glorified the Lord and you kept the jokes to a minimum thank you David and uh we just had a great time and better than that I got home at 8 30 last night that was the only request that I had in the in the discussions that I had with the couple is have the wedding early enough that the reception can be early enough that we can get home and some of these receptions are like eternity they just go on and on and on and on and then I'm the one who pays the price the next day because I've got a sleeping congregation uh but at 10 o'clock last night they were still in here you may not think that that thing is heavy but that that rack on this platform is heavy and they were taking it down putting everything back and you know I never had to worry I didn't drive over here today worried that something wouldn't be back that something wouldn't be done I have that much confidence in this church and these young people who work so hard that I knew that everything would be back everything would be clean and everything would be in order for the service today and I commend all of you for your faithfulness to be here what good would it do us to be gathered together had he not come but he came with his presence there was something moving in a deep deep place in the spirit today and I challenge you not to go home like you came you must go home different than what you came today you must respond if there's a deep calling how many of you know there's a deep that has to respond and I believe you're carrying that today and sister Alfreda maybe you felt a little bit out of place but we didn't think you were we thought you deserved that honor and you looked amazingly beautiful and not for your age for you you looked amazing I'm not going to put a tag on there for your age because she looked as I'm sorry you young ladies she looked as beautiful as any of you and that is because her life has been dedicated for the kingdom of God and to his work and I thought what an honor and Her speech about friend friendship with God it's powerful and that's exactly what we saw we saw that friends of God enjoy being with friends of God and it was just amazing I mean I could talk on all day but I don't think you want me to just chit chat with you but I could because I felt that blessed uh they had a lot of food left over and they have invited us to have lunch here on the campground today and you are welcome to do that different ones took some home with them and we'll we'll uh after the service they will go home and heat it up they live close and we'll bring it back and we will share uh if it would be almost as good as yesterday it will be amazing and worth your worth your stay we may need drinks and may need to some send some of you for ice and drinks and what have you but if you don't want to stay you didn't know about it you don't feel like you can we understand but we heartily invite you to stay and and just spread it out when I heard that they were going to be here the Newlywed couple would be here this morning I said well that's Wonder wonderful it gives us a whole nother day to celebrate them and to let them know what they mean to us and these families I I Jennifer your family were they were a pleasure to be around we enjoyed them so much your dad uh was especially thoughtful he came over to my table and he said brother Shelley I want to thank you that was holy and sacred and you know that's what we wanted it to be I looked sometime I glance up and I see the faces of the visitors and and they're looking like wow this is a big deal you know they're they're they're signing their lives away well they are this is a big deal you you don't get two or three chances you've got to get it right in the beginning and you've got to take it serious and this couple took it very very serious and uh so anyway his presence was with us and I I'm so thankful for that and uh we are looking forward to camp meeting I got the arrival uh itinerary for Brother Juan arnoldus which by the way his birthday is today and uh they were coming from South Africa it was a 20-year dream of theirs to attend our camp meeting and we have no we've been in touch with them for a little over 20 years and never met them face to face and what a joy and and then the Lord began to deal with our heart and we knew that he was to have a part in these meetings I don't know what the Lord is going to do but I sensed all over again this morning when that deep spirit of God was moving oh it's almost so deep in my spiritual belly that the body doesn't have time to react it's like a groaning uh uh a roaring I might get happy now like a roaring and and if you'll ever you really I encourage you not to look at other people when you're in a moment like that but to look to the Lord but I'm a pastor and a papa and I look around at other people sometime and I want you to know you look perfect I forget all of you that I know about all of your Hang-Ups all of your idiosyncrasies and do you ever have a lot of them I forget all of that because when that presence of the Lord comes you're as perfect in his presence in his sight as you're ever going to be when sister Peterson wrote that song so many years ago it has ministered to me countless times through the years oh praise the lord it's Jesus that I see the son of man revealed in you and me I'm so glad that I'm part of the family where the people of God are perfect as can be when you get under that blood filter and you get in the presence of the Lamb you're just as perfect as you are ever going to be in this life if you believe that same man well I'm going to sing a song no one else turned in a song so I'm going to sing a song I didn't know that my little dance with the children was was captured it wasn't pretty but it was sincere I was thankful to be able to have the strength to do it I thought the dancing was beautiful I I there was a lot of a lot of concern about how to pull it off with a mixed crowd and different thought it was it was perfect and and I know there were some of you that got up and celebrated in the in the in the Jewish dance that that's not your cup of tea that's not your thing but you did it anyway to make it special and I believe God was glorified that's why we dance we dance because we have something to dance about amen we weren't doing the Boogie I didn't see any discoing going on we don't do like that I didn't see any slow dances or Waltz either but I tell you I but I will say one carnal thing I believe that Jennifer and Josiah have practiced no response out of either one of them except except big eyes from Josiah uh no you didn't you didn't practice because it sure looked like it I would I hope somebody captured when you all were in the center and the and the folks were dancing around you it was beautiful it was Precision well God is good any good well I had a song in my mind but I forgot what it was not awful why are you folks getting so old oh He Didn't Throw the Clay Away this was Sister Tebow song she loved this song [Music] I came back to him a vessel unworthy I was so scarred by sin but he did not despair he started over again and I bless the day he didn't throw the Clay Away [Music] but over and over emotes me and makes me into his likeness he Fashions the clay have a soul of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away [Music] now he is my Potter and I'm just the clay and molded In His Image he really wants me to stay but when I Stumble when I fall and my vessel breaks he just picks up all the little pieces he does not Throw the Clay Away sing it with me church but over and over he molds me and makes me into [Music] his likeness he Fashions the clay have a soul of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away my Potter and I Am The Clay more Dead In His Image he really wants me to stay but when I Stumble when I fall and when my best super breaks he just picks up all the little pieces thank God he does not Throw the Clay always sing it with me over over and over he really moves me and makes me into his likeness he Fashions the clay oh salt of Honor I am today and it's all cause Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away he welcomes all the backsliders home I was empty and broken when I came back to him a vessel unworthy I was so scarred by sin but he did not not despair he just started over again oh now I've blessed the day he's a skin and Throw the Clay Away over and over he mows me and makes me into thank you Jesus his likeness he Fashions the clay [Music] of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus didn't throw the Clay Away of Honor I am today [Applause] and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away [Music] aren't you glad you didn't do it would you give these musicians and worship leaders been outstanding job what a blessing turn to Isaiah 54 one more service where this is our theme Isaiah 54 and verse 16 and 17 in the Amplified Bible we'll just go right there since we have already read it in the King James but no weapon no weapon now notice he didn't say it wouldn't be formed it it's like that verse that says and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it it didn't say they wouldn't March against it it said they wouldn't win how many of you know the Gates of Hell will never win against your life praise God and the promise is no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong the peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord those in whom this is so important those in whom the ideal servant mashiach that ideal servant of the Lord is reproduced those in whom the ideal servant of the Lord is reproduced This Is the destiny of the bride of Christ we are here in the earth to reproduce the life of Messiah it is our calling and we have everything we need to reproduce Jesus in the Earth because we have the seed of God and the seed of God has come to life as the son not s-u-n that's Catholicism s-o-n has risen in our lives and the son has drawn out the germ that life that is in the seed it has caught there has been some dying of the outer shell there's been some dying off of the outer shell so that the germ of Life the kernel of Life inside the seed could come forth and not only sprout but that it might come into Union with the very nature of God that the very nature of God be duplicated in the life of the believer now that's not Church entity folks that's not denominational Christianity people oh no that is Bridal Paradigm it's the sons of God coming forth in the last day all of creation is groaning the Earth beneath our feet the heavens above our head groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God oh Hallelujah that is the righteousness or the Vindication which they obtain from me this is that this is so wonderful this is that which I impart to them as their justification do you know what your justification is it's imparted righteousness it's the imparted righteous you could not keep the law there is no Temple that means that quite a few of the over 600 Commandments could never be kept in this day because we have no Temple and there's no need to keep all of those Commandments that that apply to sacrificial system that which applies to the offering system because we have no Temple but there is something that we receive that is a gift to us if we abide in the word if we abide in him and he abides in us he imparts he imparts to us a righteousness that says You Are Holy you are acceptable you are redeemed and my Guiltless blameless now I want you to know when you start singing like you sung this morning and you begin to realize that's who you are I will never leave you I will never forsake you I'm right where you are did you hear the words of that I'm right where you are the righteous God is among us today he's here with us and when we leave here we're taking him with us and he's going to meet us tomorrow he'll be with us even to the end so come what may in the streets of this nation Our God will never leave us he will never forsake us now Lord we approach your word with fear and with trembling we didn't just come to hear a lecture we came to hear from you and I pray that your anointing and your glory will fill this place as your word Goes Forth in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said you may be seated turn around and wave at the sound booth and wish charity a happy birthday today happy birthday [Applause] today on Tuesday of this week Wesley Miller has a birthday and we've been remembering him in prayer because of the prayer request that was turned in on the app for him already but let's remember him especially this week and then on Wednesday he's out but on Wednesday Ben Ellsworth has a birthday so let's wish him a happy birthday as well it has been said that you are Your Own Worst Enemy and if that be the case then if God's word says no weapon formed against you shall prosper that means that even you are not going to be successful in forming a weapon against yourself he's going to come to the rescue he's going to correct your thinking he's going to let you come under some teaching he's going to speak to you out of his word so that you will learn strategy to stop being Your Own Worst Enemy you know I could hear the spirit of the Lord saying this morning get out of my way get out of my way get out of my way you're just in my way and I want you just to get out of my way so I can have my way it's a yielding it's a yielding process that we're in we're learning we're learning and we're yearning to yield to the Lord how many of you want him to have the right of way in your life then you're going to have to turn loose so some of your stinking thinking you're going to have to go to what the scripture talks about in Tuesday night we we looked at this verse in Philippians chapter 4 and verse 8 if you'll put it up again we learned last week that that science is currently telling us that there are three T's that cause disease and they're telling us that between 75 and 98 of all current mental physical and emotional even behavioral illnesses today are are a product of your thought life now does anybody stagger at the hugeness of the number 75 to 98 percent of all current mental physical emotional and behavioral illnesses today come from thought life so it seems that we have been quite concerned about toxins and poisons and we should be because our bodies are being bombarded in the world that we live in today with all kinds of chemicals that were never designed to come in contact with the human body and we slather them on our skin which is the largest organ of our body and uh because of the of the miracle of being able to receive something that way subcutaneously we are actually poisoning ourselves with all kinds of if you don't don't read the ingredients if you don't want to know right have you seen that label going around of of the genetic of the genetically modified ingredients in Bluebell isn't that funny you can't even get an amen out of this ice cream eaten bunch I know it's your favorite and I know it's the nectar of the Gods I know I'd lose church members if I started preaching against Bluebell but you'd just be shocked even the Beloved Chick-fil-A I'm thankful that Zaxby's is even worse than that if you start reading the ingredients that they used to season the things to give it flavor but the reality is that only 2 to 25 percent of all diseases whatever mental physical emotional Behavior it's only 2 to 25 percent that actually comes from toxins and Trauma the the three T's thoughts toxins trauma so the biggest part of this ease in the body is because of the way we think I tell you that really is a blessing to know because that means I can improve my physical health my mental health my emotional health and even my behavioral problems and not only children have them adults can have behavioral problems too I can do something about that even if I can't afford the most expensive doctors in the world I get people who write me often who want me to fly to to a doctor in Florida who or who want me to fly to a doctor in New York City because they care about me and they want me to be able to get some of the pain under control and even if I had the kind of money that it would take to do something like that I have the grace of God to know that I can change a lot of things in my body by changing my thought life the scripture said finally Brethren whatsoever Things Are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue power and if there be any praise think amen thank on these things did you know that that the average person has at least 35 000 thoughts a day and for some people it's even higher than that it goes up over a hundred thousand and did you know that of the 35 000 thoughts that you're going to think today around 97 of those thoughts are the same ones you used yesterday so we're not very original thinkers hello we just keep thinking the same negative junk over and over and over and over again now when I say thoughts I don't mean the automatic program behaviors like brushing our teeth you don't have to tell yourself or think about what the next step is when you're brushing your teeth you just grab the toothpaste you you just go about I'm going to brush my and you do those are not the kind of thoughts we're talking about we're talking we're talking about thoughts that we just bring into our mind and most of them are the same thoughts that you thought yesterday and if you're not seeing change in your life you've got to think for change hello what you hear directly affects what you think so you've got to be careful what you're listening to look this way and help me preach somebody said well that's not the scripture what you're preaching now you're just trying to give us some good positive advice I want you to know the Bible is full of this and the message of the hour is full of this I want you to know that brother Branham preached more on the mind and the thought life probably than any other subject we have several hundred pages of notes and quotations of brother Branham talking about the attitude and the mind and the ability that we have to change our circumstances by changing our thinking and he tells us that that there's a great battle and the greatest battle ever fought is fought not on the Battlegrounds of of of world dominions and Powers but he said the greatest battle that a man ever ever fights is the one in his own mind so if you and I could get a hold of these thoughts and we could bring them into subjection to the truth of God's word if we could start wiring out the negativity bias and start wiring in thoughts of faith and virtue and lovely thoughts and Powerful thoughts and true thoughts and honest thoughts we could burn out the rest how many of you want some new dendrites to form in your mind you want some healthy trees you want to get rid of some of those gnarled and twisted thoughts so if you will put some extra effort into thinking right and working on grubbing out and digging out the old paradigms that you keep repeating the behavior that you keep repeating you will absolutely see the scripture come to pass in your life no weapon even my thought life is a weapon that the enemy tries to form against me and as long as I'm cooperating he's going to drag that process out just as long as he absolutely can I want to I want somebody in this church to catch a positivity bias I want you to be biased you know that the world says you shouldn't be biased shouldn't be bigoted the world says you shouldn't you should be tolerant and you should be this another but I want to tell you I want you to have a bias I want my children to have a bias I want it to be to a Prejudice but I want it to be toward the word of God I wanted to be a positivity bias instead of a negativity bias you can do this I'm telling you today you can do this you can win this battle and how do we win it one thought at a time if you sat in that room yesterday and looked around and saw everybody else's faults you've got a negativity bias you need to pull that thing down plunge it under the blood of Jesus Christ and catch a quick glimpse of God's people with imputed righteousness on their head I am not a perfect man but you don't know it think you know it but you don't know it because imputed righteousness is on my head and so a lot of what you think about me is a lie a lot of what we think about each other is a lie because we like to brag I really know I know what she said but I know what she meant I know what he said but I know what he meant you don't know nothing you're in a church this morning with a bunch of people that are walking around with the imputed righteousness of God on their head and when we stray he reminds us come on when we fail he convicts us and we repent and we don't lay all night in the altar to repent because we know who we are [Applause] I'm always with you he said I'm with you to the end of the Earth he always desires to stay close to us and help us with the problems of Life do you believe that nothing is more contagious than negativity I want to I want to read the quote that we had Tuesday night and then we're going on to something else brother banham he said here's an old slogan I want you to remember it it's testimony raising the dead boy it's the name of the sermon he said here's an old slogan I want you to remember do right that's your duty to God think right that's your duty to yourself and you're bound to be right I like to put it in the order that it was spoken think right that's your duty to yourself do right that's your duty to God and you're bound to be right now brother banham is telling us that that our thinking determines our doing that's right that's right because the Bible said as the man thinketh in his heart so he is so is he so you've got to think of yourself as an overcomer and you've got to think of yourself as someone who cannot survive one second without the blood of Jesus Oh The Blood the blood the blood I've got to have the blood I've got to have a life that's in the blood I've got to have it over me I've got to recognize this righteousness that's been put on my head and I've got to do my part in living a life of surrendered obedience in fact we have to do what I heard the spirit of God saying today we've got to get out of his way I want you to look at your neighbor I know how you hate doing that that's why I keep asking you to do it I want to break you out of that old cycle I want you to look at your neighbor and I want you to say get out do it just just do it do it with a little somebody do it with a head shake get out of God's way come on get out of God's way [Music] do what get out of God's way and fast well you fast today [Applause] somebody can have Austin's but oh no you bit speed you met quickly do it as fast as you possibly can get out of God's way I want to tell you something you've only got October November and December to get out of God's way will you take that as a challenge because we're coming to the end of a supernatural year and I know that God has already done some outstanding and Supernatural things I know the camels that we've been praying for for about 10 years finally started showing up amen provision and finance finally started showing up I thought when the projectors were going crazy earlier in the service I thought uh oh we're fixing to have to put in a big screen up there to take care of this problem because these projectors are as old as the church building and they're not going to last forever and they were a pretty penny when we put them in and eventually we're going to have to do something else but you know what we know how to call in the camels you just got to realize they don't always show up when you expect them but they come and I'm telling you there's more on the way because God's going to provide his he's listen he's going to make provision for the vision that's what God does and he's going to do that in your life as an individual if you will keep faithful Covenant with him he's going to show up for you with provision for the vision God is not responsible or obligated to finance my own ideas but he is responsible and obligated to finance and to provide for his own ideas and he will and you're going to see it so utilize October we got a couple more weeks of September utilize October November in December to get rid of whatever it is that keeps you standing in God's way you know it's really a shame that God has to get me out of the way before he can move what a shame that he has to bother with that process of moving me shouldn't I recognize when I'm not in his way when I'm in his way when I'm not in his will should not be able to recognize that on my own and move myself I'm preaching to the church today Hallelujah amen I should be able to recognize it so we think right that's our duty to ourself we do right that's our duty to God and then we're bound to be right everything else about you is bound to turn out right if you think right and do right somebody said that's not easily done no but you have everything you need provided for you to be able to do it by the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ if you believe that same man the enemy is constantly trying to disturb our peace and we close we close with Isaiah 26 3 Tuesday night thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee if you're always looking at your circumstances you'll miss your God if you're looking at the bigness of your problem you'll miss the greatness of your God if you believe that same man now punch your neighbor and tell them sleep later this time doesn't belong to you come on do it this time doesn't belong to you this is God's time so one of the ways that we become a weapon against ourselves is the way we think number two one of the ways that we become a weapon against ourselves is by carrying offense he offended me you know I don't mean to make light but sometimes I just want to say whoopee do I do I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry sometimes I do sometimes I just want to say okay big whoop happens all the time and whether you realize it or not you've offended half the crowd thank you thank you I believe I will then we have a little Jew juice here and see if something a fan I'm offended he hurt my feelings she hurt my feelings oh I'm ready to be paid for my feelings being heard aren't you I've had mine hurt so many times I'm I'm I'm standing in line for the payday If We Hold The Grudge we're holding ourselves in limitation if we're holding a grudge we're in God's way punch your neighbor somebody's trying to sleep Psalm 119 165. great peace great peace say it with me great peace great shalom have they which love thy law and you fall in love with God's word you fall in love with God's word and that's going to matter more than anybody else's opinion more than anybody else's Behavior I had to deal with this last night when I got home and realized that Chad Jernigan had not spoken to me at the wedding yesterday he just strut it in as only he can and strut it out and I was so offended that I realized I was going to lose sleep over that if I didn't let that thing go so I just read his thoughts and he was thinking pastor's busy so I won't go over there and he's he's stalking other I won't I won't say anything and you know what I just let all my offense go until this morning when he strutted in my office and I said hey you come to repent didn't you now I'm being silly and I'm making a joke but don't you act like you don't go home from church sometime thinking some stupid thought like that why she shook everybody's hand in the room but mine now I'm going to tell you she ought not to done that but but do you want to put her in a box so that she can't shake anybody's hand because she's afraid she might miss somebody you don't want to box her in you don't want to try to control somebody's nature in the way they are if I A lot of times when I walk in a room uh I I I feel so listen I told the brothers the other night we went to celebrate Josiah at the restaurant and it was kind of crowded in there and any of you who have this little uh oddness about you when I'm in a crowd I automatically feel like I weigh 500 pounds it's just something that happens to large people I guess a fluffy extra fluffy people and you just all of a sudden feel like you're the fattest biggest largest person in the room and you'll never be you know everybody's going to be looking at you and you're ever always in somebody's way and you're always excuse me I'm sorry excuse me let me sorry sorry so when I am in a situation like that sometimes I just sit down and I'm not particularly choosing who's sitting with me or who I'm sitting with I'm just getting out of people's way now I know that I weigh a few pounds shy of that and I know that I'm not always the largest person in the room but it's a mentality I'm telling you mine don't want to hear yours I'm telling you mine because we can think the dumbest things and and thank God I don't carry it a step further like some people do I won't even go there won't be room for me the chair won't hold me or whatever else will get in your mind you cannot let something like that keep you from fellowshipping with the Saints I I get nervous in a crowd my wife will tell you if I don't have an assigned seat I get very nervous because I don't want to take somebody else's spot I don't need a special spot I just need a place that I know I'm supposed to be so I try to get there as quick as I can and sit down and it's not that I don't want to move around the room and fellowship with people it's just one of my own little careful what you say one of my own little quirks that's the best thing I can think of you are entitled to yours I'm entitled to mine until we let it hinder us from boot doing and being what God has called us to be so if if something happened yesterday that you didn't get recognized enough or or or or I didn't shake your hand or let me ask you a question who who in this room did Chad Jernigan Shake Your Hand hahaha thank you I am devastated great peace I have I love the law of God and nobody is going to offend me nobody wants that you don't want to carry that kind of thing from day to day to day my my wife she's a little bit of an odd creature you can laugh she gets something on her mind oh my goodness you people was I bragging on you all earlier it had to be a man that did that I am so offended by whoever put that backwards [Applause] now we're making light you're at least you're awake now we're making light but you know what the enemy can do with an offense it turns out that you get your feelings hurt and that hurt takes root in you and you start filtering everything out of that hurt and out of that wounded place and therefore people can never win with you because you've already stacked everything against them I got to a place where I was quite tired we had an elderly sister here who was always saying to my wife uh uh well you finally shook my hand and one day I caught her to the side and I said we honor you and respect you as a senior but that's my wife what you need to do is go and shake her hand you need to go greet her instead of getting your feelings hurt if she misses you in the crowd and who in the world would try to mend offense or to make a relationship by looking at somebody in the face and saying oh it's like brother Tremaine meeting people at the door we had to stop him because he would meet people at the door and what he meant to say was we have really missed you that's what he meant but what he ended up saying where have you been and we had to stop him we had to say brother Tremaine you cannot welcome people to church by telling where have you been well we hadn't seen you in the Month of Sundays now you and I knew him and loved him and we could interpret but if someone is already feeling bad about missing some Services the last thing they want is somebody at the front door saying huh you showed up finally did you well even no no no no no no that's not the way to approach somebody if you want a man then you want to heal and you want to make whole how many of you want to fill in the holes may God anoint you to be a whole filler and a gap stander somebody who wants to draw and Pull and this was kind of Jennifer this was kind of the kind of her name this was kind of what her name symbolizes someone who wants to pull things pull people together and this is really our nature otherwise we we get bogged down with with offense with hurt feet or I feel you I won't tell you I feel some of you I feel you right now and some of you are thinking you know I just don't appreciate my feelings not being validated well when I look at my job description I never read the phrase about it being my responsibility to validate your feeling it is my responsibility to warn you that if we don't get rid of offenses and we don't get rid of grudges we're going to stop the flow how many of you want to open up The Floodgate Hebrews 12 15 tells us this looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any read it for me root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled if we allow a root of bitterness to produce a crop it's not just our life are you with me today you see there's women who've had a bad marriage who decide that all men are dogs you're wrong all men are not dogs you see men who have bad experiences with women and they think all women are cheap and can't be trusted you're wrong you're basing life and the opinions of your life on some things that you've been through which proves that there's still a root there's something wrong you you've been mistreated and let down by preachers or other churches so you come here expecting that it's going to happen again the problem with that kind of attitude is you create situations with your bitterness that cause circumstances to align with your expectation because the law of attraction is really something that operates and we not only attract with our personality but sometimes we attract negativity with our distrust we attract other people who have trust issues the next thing you know we form a little league around our root of bitterness shutting other people out while spreading our poison Undercover hello that word bitterness that's in front of you there in Hebrews 12 15 it means harshness did you know that harshness is a personality trait where bitterness Lays it means resentful spirit are there things that you resent me too but I cannot afford resentment to feed a root of bitterness in the message the ten virgins and the 144 000 Jews brother Branham says in paragraph 71 oh not that constant burden for the loss that sweetness don't never let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul notice that's where bitterness lie it doesn't have it doesn't get in your spirit your spirit is regenerated by the Holy Spirit it's not in your spirit it's in your nature it's in your personality which lies in the realm of nephesh which is your soul don't you let bitterness don't let anything rise up and put bitterness in your soul mind will and emotion no matter how bad anyone ever treats you or anything don't ever don't be guilty of letting that thing anchor in your soul it'll grieve the holy spirit away from you can anybody say Amen it'll grieve the holy spirit away from you it certainly will how many of you can agree with that and in the same sermon eight paragraphs later in paragraph 79 he said see always keep all roots of bitterness out of you resentfulness out of you no matter what anyone does to you just have God in there that'll keep all evil away from you did you know a soul that is saturated in God when your mind and your will and your emotions are saturated in God there is no room in your mind or your will or your emotions for bitterness it just gets starved out every time you know when we get bitter we look for somebody to be bitter with us and we test our water like putting a toe in the water to the bath water to see if he's just right we say little things in front of people to see where they stand and if they shut us down instead of entertaining our bitterness you know what we do we cut them off because we're not looking for somebody who'll stand against us we're looking for somebody who we're not looking for conviction or correction we're looking for somebody who'll get in the boat with us hello you can't believe everything you hear you can't believe everything you see come on amen you can see some things and filter them through your own paradigm you can think you're seeing what you're not seeing you can see a situation there and think there's some some kind of wonky going on when actually it's just as innocent as it possibly can be so you've got to be careful what you say and what you do and how you act how you treat one another because you don't want to be a part of the weapon that the enemy is trying to form against your own life no weapon somebody say no weapon now in Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 86 and 87 this is a powerful powerful powerful ver verse or quotation he said if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister Lord don't let me never have that root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him hi not only will it affect me it will affect a multitude and it'll take for Christ right out of my life how many of you know you can't afford for Christ to be removed from your life you have no reason to believe to breathe then you have no reason to live then you can't afford to let that happen he said that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you now listen Folk listen folk don't listen to other people's amends and get offended I know how people use their amends I've been in church a long time did you know this week I'm gonna I'm gonna celebrate 48 years a full-time ministry that's a long time 48 years of solid full-time ministry that's all by the grace of God I've seen most anything anybody can see been through an experience just about anything that anybody can go through and experience and I still don't know near what I believe God has for me to know because he constantly is revealing himself but I have lived long enough in Ministry to know that jealousy and hatred and bitterness will destroy a man it'll destroy a woman he'll take the Holy Spirit right away from you now listen it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that and here's the key here's the key here's the key here's the key come when you don't feel comfortable come anyway go to the baby shower woman go I'm not comfortable go I get nervous in a crowd go I'm preaching to this church go go to the baby shower go well I I'll feel like an odd bird I'm not in the click nobody will talk to me go oh I'm preaching I'm preaching go well where do you base that on here we go right here you just waxed that much closer together when you know the enemy is trying to divide the body when you know the enemy is trying to stir a stink you pouting ain't gonna change anything you lying over yourself and telling everybody I'm an introvert that's a lie I don't believe in introverts see how quiet it gets because people have used that excuse their entire life to withdraw and the only way to defeat the enemy who wants to cause Division and stink among God's people is to wax closer together oh I wished I wasn't on stream now I want to say something but I can't say it on stream because it sounds so ugly no don't try to tempt me to I thought you people was for me not against me let me just see if I can say one thing and you'll get the point without me saying it buttercup you get it now do you know what I wasn't going to say that I wanted to say but I'm not going to say buttercup does Buttercup help you to find it by saying Buttercup do you get the point sometimes you just have to do that buttercup you just have to pull yourself up put your big boy and say I'm gonna do this thing I'm not gonna let the devil cut me off from the life of the body of Christ I need this church I need my brothers and sisters I need the atmosphere here and I need the fellowship you're gonna want us to celebrate you and yours so you don't let the enemy cause you to pull apart wax closer together draw up take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night now this was my friend brother Branham is talking about one of the dearest friends that I've ever had in life brother Gerald Cleveland and brother Gerald Cleveland is the one that had the dream about the belt buckle and the belt buckle appears supernaturally in the film excuse me in the photo where the lilies grow you've seen the supernatural photo brother Branham is behind the pulpit there are lilies on the on the front and the fire comes down and the lilies grow how many of you seen the picture they're over the pulpit and in that in that second shot that was taken and in that it's that that brass or Golden Belt Buckle that brother Cleveland saw in a dream he went to the Tabernacle and he gave that and remember that's what it looked like when it appeared in my hotel room in Tucson when I when I saw it and took a photo of it which some of you have seen when when it showed up I thought I was looking at that that belt buckle in fact I called Brother Cleveland from the hotel room in Tucson to talk to him about his experience because when it first came in the room it appeared on the wall just like a brass or a golden belt buckle and then it started vibrating and moving and and as it continued to move it opened up and I realized that what I was seeing was a window of Heaven Aruba in Hebrew I was seeing what what some people call today a portal but it was an opening into the heavenlies and the blue of truth that beautiful blue color of the tehelid it was it was behind that that that invitation and we have just come in is this 5784 is that where we are right now we've just entered into the Hebrew year of 57 84. today is the second day of the Hebrew year 57-84 which is a which is a a year of the opening of the door and when I think of that open door I go to Revelation chapter 4 and I receive an invitation that says come up here because you can't see what you need to see if you live down there in the lowland I'm preaching now help me a minute if you live down there in the lowland with your feelings heard and your bitterness growing and all that you will never be able to get up above the problems of life and see what God wants you to see if John the Revelator was a type of the bride of Christ then it wasn't just John that was invited to come up and see the Heavenly realm it was the bride it's our invitation get up above the gunk don't you stain your robe with politics in a time like this keep your robe clean if the church should have learned anything in the last election it would be don't dirty your clothes with politics because Prophet after profit after profit prophesied all over the world that Donald Trump will be exonerated and placed back in office before Biden is able to finish his first term now they have have uh you know in politics they use this term walking it back this is a little colored lady that we see all the time who's trying to defend the indefensible and she's constantly making statements that are untrue and the next day she's walking it back she's called a press secretary who in the world would want such a low down job what could be any more low than to have to lie to the American public for the sake of politics and then they back it up and they back it up and they back it up and they try to cover it over don't you get caught up in that in this coming election you vote and you vote your conscience and you vote what God tells you and here's what he has told me there's three things that he cares about more than all the rest when it comes to a leader for this nation that's the sanctity of life the sanctity of human marriage that's between a man and a woman and it's Israel those are the things that are dearest to the heart of God in an hour like this the rest of it let me tell you something I hate to hurt your feelings but he doesn't really care about unemployment rates and inflation rates and Social Securities and these things don't really bother the economy of God because he knows he's going to take care of his folks [Applause] no matter what they do I'm an old man and I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor God's seed begging for bread don't you let this old stuff make you bitter don't let it make you paranoid God is going to take care of his little people amen and we may have to do without some things but God is going to take care of us it will stay right with him if we'll keep the bitterness out and the and turn loose of The Grudge and get filled up then no weapon so that uh that belt buckle brother Cleveland had this dream and there were there were a belt buckles there was an ordinary looking belt buckle laying there and a hand came and picked up that golden belt buckle and placed it over the top of the ordinary belt buckle and it was changed into into a golden belt buckle and brother Branham was not to be in the service that night Brother Cleveland went anyway not knowing until that afternoon that brother Brandon wasn't going to be there he went to the service anyway he had traveled all the way from Anderson South Carolina to Jeffersonville Indiana to be in the service and he said about the time they start taking some testimonies brother Branham opens the door of the study walks out and pulls a folding chair a straight chair Off the Wall there and unfolds it and sits down on the platform and leans back in that chair and is listening to the testimony and brother Cleveland is the one testifying about this dream and now in a in a service or two later brother Brad and brother Branham got up in the service and interpreted what that meant and he talked about it being the the Buckle that buckles on the armor of God and how important that is that Buckle has got to be cinched and it's Gotta it's got to be operational because it's holding on it's holding something in that that belt we need that belt don't we and uh so brother Branham got up and interpreted that dream and now he's referring to it and he's referring to it in the reference of what can happen when we let the enemy divide us and he said you just wax that much closer together take the Buckle the brother testify to minister either not uh seeing it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her own tighten up somebody read that for me move right up close to one another love one another and and this is a huge word there uh oh how huge that word is can somebody tell me that that good old southern word there anyhow talk nice well this can be a challenge we have to be creative sometime to think of something nice to say but we can do this because it brings the holy spirit in in in our presence when we learn to say something edifying say nice things about one another and then somebody read that rest sentence and then God will bless you in the pergamian church age this is not the church age book but the preaching of the church ages paragraph 17 brother Brandon said try to do something good and just keep being good you knew that you could do the smallest gesture and brighten somebody's life wouldn't you want to do it as a servant of Christ Chad if you knew that you were going to cut me like a knife by not saying hello to me wouldn't you want to do it wouldn't you want to stand in line if you had to and say hello oh Lord he's got the slowest head nods in the church he's got a process it all before he knocks and his little wife nervous little Jennifer is looking at him don't let me down don't embarrass me don't Darren play alone play along play along she knows what she lives with play alone Oh No Malice no grudges don't let any bitterness no matter how bad the person is and how bad they talk about you don't you never think evil in your heart against them because right there the devil will set right in and work up something right there just keep it all covered up with Godly love confession and making right and do good to those who do evil to you if you only do good to those who do good to you why Jesus said don't the publicans do the same see the Sinners anybody can be good to those that's good to them hello we're getting to the nitty-gritty but be good to those who are not good to you do something for those that would not do anything who would do nothing for you somebody said I I you know uh someone give me a birthday little birthday I I couldn't I can't afford to give them all something you know you don't want to get caught up in that vicious trap of expectation but but I found out that you can write a note on a plain piece of paper and give it to somebody on their birthday and brighten their life you can pick up a dollar candy bar at the dollar store and pick up somebody's life you don't have to get a bouquet you can get a single flower for just a couple of bucks and brighten somebody's life and be good to somebody and and and do more you you do more to create Unity you do more to get rid of all the stuff by some little act of kindness or gesture of love than what you recognize sometime what you realize you don't realize how effective it is to show just the just a little bit of love and consideration well I know what'll happen if I do he'll just hurt me again I know what'll happen if I do she'll just step all over me again she might she might well she's the one that needs some work it sounds like he he might he might he he's the one that needs a little bit of work but I want you to know that's not what you're not obligated to keep his Spirit right you're not obligated to keep her spirit right what are we obligated to do keep our own Spirits right and I'm preaching to you and if I need to call names I was told recently that if I need to call names I can because I have in the past and it happened to be from someone who's had their name called speak a good word for the man that would speak evil against you and that way you keep all the bitterness out of your heart and you're always in love with everybody then as long as you what stay in love we're not talking about just that that filial love that that human the we're talking about in the love of God oh that's some powerful love that's the changing love brother Branham said in 1957 May every root of bitterness be grubbed out by God's sharp grubbing hole and then closing another way that we can well let me let me do this first concerning grudges Mayo Clinic released an article what are the effects of holding a grudge if you're unforgiving you might pay the price repeatedly by bringing anger and bitterness into every relationship and into every new experience your life might become so wrapped up in the wrong that you can enjoy the present has anybody ever been there holding a grudge you might become depressed or anxious holding a grudge you might feel that your life lacks meaning or purpose or that you're at odds with your own spiritual beliefs you might lose valuable and enriching connectedness with others now I said some things Tuesday night that I want to justify before we before we close because I know what some of you did I know that some of you went to Dr Google you heard me speak about soul ties and I know that some of you went to Dr Google and you were very alarmed because the first 12 or 15 articles about soul ties will tell you about how unbiblical the concept is and how New Age it is and how there's no scriptural truth in it well I want you to know I absolutely emphatically refute all 15 articles and what I would like to tell you is this there is a new age concept of a soul tie that is called the fragmentation of the human psyche or the human soul and that we do not believe we do not believe that a soul tie takes from you a portion of your own soul physically that is the New Age idea it's kind of like the old expression that we say sometime you better be careful how many pieces of your mind you give away you know some people are always saying I gave him a piece of my mind I gave her a piece of my mind and we have to remind people sometime you've about giving it all away and that's kind of what that Soul fragmentation of the human psyche is about it's this this metaphysical and and New Age idea that you're actually losing apart physical part of your of your soul when you create a soul tie which leaves you with some holes in you this has no scriptural uh Foundation whatsoever but the concept of a soul tie is a very spiritual and scriptural concept and I want to take just 10 minutes here maybe and and help you because uh I I had not looked at it in a long time and after I spoke that I went to Dr Google because I woke up just knowing that somebody was checking me out and I want you to do that but I don't want you to refute what you hear simply because you found the negative article has anybody ever Googled brother Branham we don't get our information about brother Branham from Google we get it from what we hear him say out of his own mouth and we get it from those who knew him the best from Witnesses who walked with him and ministered with him we we're not interested in Wikipedia see so if you read something like that and you throw the baby out with the bath water you'll miss the whole truth of the concept and so let me give you a couple of verses of scripture we're going to need somebody up there because I did not uh give them these verses this is a verse that you are familiar with in second Corinthians chapter six and verse 14 in the Amplified Bible second Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14. this is always used concerning marriage but there's actually nothing in it that says that it's a verse exclusively pertaining to marriage I want you to look at how they Amplified takes the word and the phrase and makes it quite interesting do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers now now look at how the Amplified amplifies do not make mismatched alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them inconsistent with your faith when you're looking for a business partner you need a believer when you're looking for a companion in life you need a believer what is wrong with somebody I'd like somebody to help me understand what is wrong with a believer that is so soulishly lonely that they would choose a marriage a covenant with an unbeliever and expect that they're going to have anything in the world other than two ox pulling against each other it's never going to be anything other than that as long as you have a two one a Believer and one a non-believer in the Covenant of marriage together it's never going to be any different than that in a business you you're expecting the scripture to to adapt to your choices you're never going to have a productive business by going into business with an unbeliever you're not going to have the same principles you're going to tithe on half the business you're you're going to make decisions babe some people don't care how they twist arms how they manipulate how they use witchcraft to get sales but a Believer cares a Believer doesn't want to be guilty of using witchcraft to pump up their paycheck and the world out there anybody helping me the world out there is going to expect you to do all those kinds of things all right and so we have to even be careful with our friendships or you're going to have one Ox pulley one way and the other Ox pulling the other way so to say that a non-believer is your best friend is a dangerous statement to me because this scripture is not only referring to marriage it actually says do not make mismatched alliances with them unbelievers or come under a different yoke with them inconsistent with your faith for what partnership have right living and right standing with god with iniquity and lawlessness I'm not really interested in putting beer money I need a little more time here I'm not really interested in putting beer money in somebody else's pocket I'm not really interested in putting drug money in somebody else's pocket I'm not really interested in playing dumb while somebody defrauds the the IRS [Applause] because I've been told to render under Caesar what Caesar and unto God what's God's and you may think people you may think God don't see the money this past the cash that's under the table but God sees that and if you're in that kind of a situation you may have found yourself unequally yoked together with an alliance that is mismatched and in doing so you may have formed a connection with somebody else's Soul life mind will and emotion and if you have created that kind of a connection that person can actually use that to their advantage by manipulation by the spirit of control I want you to know there are some people who are so good at control they can control you and you don't even know you're being controlled and that is not a part of a marriage anybody with me husbands and wives are not entering into that kind of a covenant so they can play mind games with one another have you ever known somebody who has a way of giving you their opinion and the next thing you know five minutes later you've turned loose of everything you thought and you have embraced someone else's contrary opinion before you know it you've been completely swayed to choose something or to make a decision that you have never made before and you don't even know walking away you don't even realize walking away you've been manipulated these are soul ties they need to be broken did you know the scripture said he who joins himself to a harlot has become one bot or a prostitute in King James I mean uh in other versions harlot in King James prostitute in other versions it says he who has joined himself to a prostitute becomes one body with that with that prostitute did you know that if any of you men have had that kind of a relationship with a with a hired woman or or man whatever the situation is do you know that if you've ever entered into that kind of agreement a soul tie an emotional connection could have been I don't know if it always was but it can be formed and if it was formed that in itself can Lodge in your memory until you feel and find yourself being pulled back into that kind of a behavior because you've become one body with a prostitute I'm not getting a whole lot of help but I think you're listening finally now I'm just telling you what the scripture is saying don't tell me there's no such thing as a soul tie because here it is right here unequally yoked together with unbelievers this is a soul tie this is describing what happens when you become emotionally attached to someone that you're not in Covenant with and if they're a non-believer you can't be in a Godly Covenant with them you can't be in a contract with them now I'm thrilled that there's a a thrill that there's a stirring that took place on the campus of Auburn I'm thrilled that 5 000 young people were gathered there in a worship night and many made their way to the water and I'm thankful that they finally have a coach who cares enough about their soul to talk to them about eternal life but I can only measurably Delight when I know that they're being baptized into a system that has no life and who scripturally can easily make them a two-fold child of hell instead of a real son of God so what I do when I read something like that I go wild in prayer instead of blasting it and becoming so critical about it on social media I get on my knees and I say Lord it only takes one all you got to do is talk to one about Jesus name baptism all you got to do is reveal it to one two three four and let them begin to tell their friends [Applause] so we Rejoice anytime darkness is pushed back but we want to get a hold of this thing in the spirit and pray that a shaking will come to that campus and that it will belch out like hell Souls for the kingdom of God because it's a corrupt Institution like all the rest of them very very monetarily driven and corrupt so much so that they can hide from the news there's so much money and power and influence in a university like that that they can hide truth from the news and we never really know the violence that takes place on campus come on now they had a measure a measurable influence over a fight that took place last weekend in Auburn that was absolutely hideous and horrible where someone followed someone else home from a bar and beat them and most of the licks that the person took they took them while they were unconscious who in their right mind that's the thing they weren't in their right mind but immediately the school goes in like every other they go into major protection mode and and won't do favors and do everything they can to keep the truth from coming out so that Justice cannot really be served and the reputation of the school be marred I'm asking God to get in the midst of that and let a breaking forth take place he's given us Authority in the spirit over this region why don't we believe that God will do something I believe he will nothing no extra charge for that I just wanted to get that out so you may Google it and think there's nothing to it but the Bible talks about David and Jonathan and the Bible uses this terminology it says there's though they were knit together in their souls now I've read articles trying to prove that they were homosexual lovers and I want you to know nothing could be any sicker or farther from the truth they weren't knitted together physically they were knitted together in mind will and emotion there was a relationship form that was positive and righteous and Powerful that made them comrades and gave them a brotherly and fraternal affection for one another that's part of the stature of the perfect man did you know it's part of our promise as broad that we will be filled with such brotherly kindness that word is can be translated from the Greek fraternal affection which is like a Band of Brothers and anything Satan can do just a minute anything Satan can do out there in the negative he has to be basing off of something positive in the spirit so if if God tells us that we can be joined in Soul or spirit with a Believer then we know that it's the enemy's desire to join us to something else whether it be a harlot or whether it be an unrighteous unbelieving partner of some kind my bestie really someone who won't serve the Lord really that's really the best you can have for a friendship now you don't want to mistreat anybody you shouldn't mistreat people you should be friendly and you can make friends but these are not people that you deeply confide in every time you lay your deepest confidence in someone it's another way that a connection is formed between the two of you and a lot of manipulation that takes place around the church the church world is because of someone who's spoken to someone else in confidence and that is a vulnerability that is exposed and it's a way that the enemy can often use to manipulate behavior and cause someone to stay locked in a cycle that the holy spirit is coming to break you out of can anybody follow along with what I'm saying and let me give you let me give you this in in First Corinthians charity verse 6 and 15 16 and 17 in the Amplified and then we'll move we'll move back to this and close it's 1 33. I know you're tired see nobody said a word I know you're tired nobody's going to lie and say I'm not I don't want you to but I'm not quite through is that First Corinthians 6 that I say something else what'd I say First Corinthians 6 verse 15 16 and 17. no ye not I want that in the Amplified First Corinthians 6 15 16 and 17. do you not see and know that your bodies are members bodily parts of Christ the Messiah am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute never never or do you not know and realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute he becomes one body with her the two it is written shall become one flesh but the person who is United to the Lord becomes not one soul not one body but we know the other scripture tells us we're members individual members of his body but those who are united to the Lord joined to the Lord to King James says becomes what now that's the Oneness that's the Yoke that's the relationship that we're all looking for what we give ourselves to becomes a vulnerable place where a soul tie can be connected and we renounce that when we recognize did you know there there may be relationships that you have moved on from but the memory of the connection that you had may still be affecting you in your relationships today because the root was never removed God help us God help us we don't want that going on in our life now in in in closing again second or third close this ought to be it Mark chapter 11. verse 25 and 26 King James and this is the third way the last and the third way that you can participate as a weapon formed against yourself number three is to remain in unforgiveness number one is to continue in stinking thinking number two is to not deal with the grudge that you're holding in your life and number three is to remain in unforgiveness and when you stand praying forgive you you're not supposed to pray with unforgiveness toward anyone in your heart hello and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses now does anybody understand from that verse of scripture that your forgiveness is intricately and directly connected to your ability to forgive am I making that up am I stretching that verse it sounds to me like Jesus is saying if you want forgiveness to flow you've got to open up the Flow by forgiving we all know the little catchphrases that are so so used in our generation and and it's so very true that forgiveness is not about the person that wronged you forgiveness is not setting them free in fact they may need to pay before God for their bad decision but it sets you free because you are no longer limited by their behavior towards you hear me you are no longer limited by your their behavior toward you but if you do not forgive verse 26 neither will your father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses Matthew 18 33 should is not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on thee has God ever shown you great grace and pity has God ever filled you with compassion when you didn't deserve it then the least we can do is treat one another with the same respect can the Saints amen Ephesians 4 31 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor when I hear that word clamor it's like I see somebody's false teeth clacking together it's just so much noise just shut it obsessive rattling on about nothing can have an effect on your spiritual life nobody likes picking on people any more than I do but when people keep on and on and on and on it becomes detrimental to the atmosphere it becomes distracting to the atmosphere we wouldn't want our well meaning or well-intended fun to disturb the Peace of the spiritual atmosphere over this place so let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice make sure we get that grubbed out get rid of all of that forgive people in your life even those who are not sorry for their actions you know what I found out if you're waiting on some people to apologize your hair is going to fall out you're going to need some of them false teeth to get through because some folks they don't see they cannot see they're blinded by their own delusions they don't care really they don't really really care how many people they step on as long as they can survive it's that dog eat dog mentality of the world around us and if you're waiting on that kind of a person to come and apologize to you may never happen you've got to do the right thing and let me tell you how important it is in closing what was that four perfect faith paragraph 19. oh you're keeping up with that are you keeping up with my good points or just my closing good thank you praise the Lord Brother Austin's fasting today for for getting out of God's way Hallelujah I love coming to church with you people praise God let me just take my time now Faith this is perfect Faith paragraph 19 faith faith is based on hello forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying oh 57-84 so you're the open door it's just laying where right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we wanted such a flow that it'll be a help to us and what else flow out to others for you date Watchers this is August of 63. the seals have been preached and the prophet is still crying out for more Apostolic times moving Among Us oh God we've got to have it we've got to have it I'm closing fifth time last paragraphs in the message the Great Commission Chattanooga Tennessee I want you to stand with me musicians are coming find the song that Ben is going to lead us in in worship and play that softly if you will research has shown that carrying a grudge or harboring unforgiveness is bad for our physical health and our mental where well-being there's an old saying that holding a grudge is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die holding on to a grudge takes work it's an active process during which we consciously recall the initial insult or replay the event over and over and over again in our mind and allow the anger heard in resentment to control our thoughts and feelings I'm going to read that one more time because some of you have already turned off your brain turn it on I want you to hear this holding a grudge takes work it's not even easy it's an active process during which we consciously recall the initial insult or replay the event over and over again in our mind and we allow the anger the hurt and the resentment to Bubble Up and control our thoughts and feelings all over again how many of you have ever relived these moments I'm not looking you've relived those hurtful moments you've relived those harsh words only Jesus can come and separate you from the memory but he wants to do that he wants to do that long-term effects the Mayo Clinic says that long-term long-term effects of carrying a grudge can range from depression to cardiovascular ailments even diminishing a person's outlook on life and overl Over All well-being paragraph 12 of The Great Commission if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Brethren this is God's servant if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong he's absolutely justly he I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that that's one of the hardest requests that's ever been made of us you take him to prayer before God and may I say God get him is not the kind of prayer you want to bring to God you know you want to say Lord help him and most of all help me because I'm having a struggle toting this thing around I need some help here don't take it in a way of just a selfish well I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder stand in the presence of God our Father way of prayer should be made in the presence of God say father here's my brother he deserves punishment he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through Leviathan the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God I think you're gonna have to read that last sentence I don't know if I can get it out Mercy Lord Mercy Lord you'll be sympathizing with that brother let's go on and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn you can't stand with Immortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he's a rank sinner and what about a brother that's made a mistake folks I'm telling you when it's a believer when it's someone who knows the God you know it puts everything in a different perspective and in a different category we don't choose we cannot choose just to ignore it though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if he'll take if we will take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder to shoulder with our brother knowing he's Immortal and maybe his destination rests it's about to get quiet ER quieter and maybe his destination rests Upon Our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that we're every one guilty that's where I want the amen to be and we all need help one from the other and look at what he closes with and the best way to do is pray we are standing perhaps in the most pregnant moment than we have ever stood in spiritually in this body there are Promises of God in gestation right now forming hoping Josh are carrying a little baby well hope is carrying it might look otherwise but she is the one who's carrying that little life and I have that little note on my desk and the other day I took that note out and I googled I looked at the at the when the due date was and I googled to see what that little sweet baby looks like in her womb and I watched as I looked and read down the list where they have taken natural things that you know of and and you can it from a from a poppy seed to a sesame seed was one of the one of the changes I saw over a week can you imagine that that little baby can go from a poppy seed to a sesame seed poppy seed you can hardly see and the next thing you know it'll be a little butter bean and and you read the little notes Stacy and I had our children in another century and we didn't know a lot of things like that but we had we didn't have apps we had VHS tapes too and we had boomboxes but anyway I had a little flip calendar that somebody gave me she might have given it to me and I got to look and see a little image of what what our babies would look like during that week and it's so precious to think of that so precious to think of the Miracle of Life That's forming in the body and it caused me to think about the spiritual implication of the Season change and a new Hebrew year opening up for us and and I began to feel something in my own spiritual womb that reminded me that the promises of God have gotten little eyelashes on them started off with little Nubs and now fingers and toes and uh are farming and limbs are forming look at it you mamas how many of you mamas have read read something like that or seen the changes that take place in a little bit it'll it'll it'll get you excited because spiritually I I was thinking now my promises has eyelashes what God is doing is farming here and some little legs and arms are uh and and and eye colors being determined different thing I want you to know that oh there's never been a more pregnant moment in the spirit than the moment we're living in right now eternity is unfolding and the invitation is get up here get out of God's way so you can get up here and let me talk to you about your destiny about what Hawk was talking about when he prayed I'm excited about this end time Revival that's breaking forth in the bride of Christ and we don't want any stinking thinking or any grudges or any unforgiveness to disqualify Us in an hour like this I want to invite you to come and worship the Lord with me I want to invite you to come present yourself to the Lord in this new Hebrew year and I want you to believe that God will show you in your life what needs the grubbing hole what root needs to be dug up and cut off so that it can no longer Prosper no weapon no weapon no weapon formed against you shall prosper come on let's come come on and we're we're gonna instead of starting off in the throes of repentance we're going to start off with worship we're going to worship him first we're going to let him know that we don't come here because we're all clear and we don't have any issue and we don't have any grubbing to do but we come here because of imputed righteousness and we can stand here with Clean Hands and a pure heart because his righteousness is over our heads amen and we don't have to feel guilty to worship him in a moment like this don't look at anybody else you give your praise to him he alone is worthy let's do that now for just a moment and light of creation grassy fear fields [Music] a shivering curtain his desired a perfect world I'm Amazed at his talent I stand in all of one so great and now my soul

Lord we want to leave it around this altar today we know the enemy's Wild we know that he rages we know that he's seeking whom he may devour but thank you Father you've given a strategy against the enemy thank you Jesus we take on the Belt of Righteousness we we belt ourselves Lord with your great armor in this hour we tighten up and we draw closer together knowing that the closer we get to one another the least Advantage the enemy will have to be able to take one of us out Lord I ask you right now to surround us with your love and care draw us in draw us in lest there not be one wounded sheep among us that catches the attention of the enemy that he could come and draw that one out and destroy that life draw us together right now pray with me Saints draw us together right now Lord draw us that we might stand as one body before you Lord let our souls be knit together in the ways of righteousness and Truth may we identify any connection spiritual or emotional that has been made with those who are not of precious faith and if so Lord give us the grace to repent for allowing that connection to form and cut it off in the authority of Jesus Christ teach us how to have connection and friendship with those who are not in the faith show us the boundaries Lord that you would have us to walk in help us find the balance of showing them Your Love Without forming Unholy alliances with them Ishmael Ila mahandaya Lord in this new year May each one of us examine our alliances may we examine who we have formed Covenant with and if there are those things that need to be dealt with provide the acts we can sever ourselves from the weight from the millstone that we might be free to move in the Realms of spirit and glory Lord show us your glory in every situation Lord I Thank you that in relationships where the enemy has desired that we walk in unforgiveness I thank you that you will show us your glory in relationships where grudges have formed I ask you to show us your glory as you separate us from our sin and you allow us to be drawn together in the unity of the faith forgiveness is the foundation of Faith Lord help us right now to turn loose of it I agree I agree I agree Lord with your ability and Grace to free us free us Lord if there's any person under the sound of my voice that has become has become one flesh with an unbeliever and never completely repented and cut that out of their life I ask you to provide Grace let it be as simple as possible let it let it let it be as peaceful as possible Lord that it would not have to continue to destroy present relationships but I ask for the grace to settle that thing right now in the name of Jesus if there is any person outside of those that we are in Covenant with that has any hold or connection or influence over us because of Soul tie we ask you right now in the name of Jesus to let that be destroyed if the enemy has found any way of controlling or manipulating us through Unholy intercession or witchcraft I ask you right now to break break Lord we thank you for your precious blood Grace love and righteousness in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus [Music] Lord who Reigns in Beauty bless

Lord who reigns with beauty bless your name bless the Lord who reigns with wisdomen with power bless the Lord who Reigns my life with so much love I want to say something this was not in my mind I didn't have this thought not any time during the preaching but it came to me as I was standing there if you are here and you owe someone something if you've borrowed money or you owe someone money for something let me encourage you to do everything you can to pay that debt because many times that is another way that a soul tie can be formed the Bible said oh no man nothing anything except to love and it's not necessarily that that person would ever use that or take advantage of you it's not that that would necessarily be their desire but the enemy is looking for anything and everything that he can use to put his finger on your life so let me encourage you and let me let me say this if you can't if you're in a position that you can't just touch base with that person if if need be if you haven't done that in a while touch base with that person and say I recognize that I still owe you and by God's grace I have every intention of making that right and maybe even by doing that you'll set something loose that needs to be loosed may God just give us Grace and wisdom to recognize any door or any window that the enemy would have opportunity to hold us in our lives sing it one more time
