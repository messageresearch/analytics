Description:
The Bride of Jesus Christ has authority like no other.  When we worship Him, we must come by divine protocol, not as a servant, but as a son.  Like Esther, we are born ‘For such a time as this!’ in the most wicked age of all.  When we come into His Throne Room, we want Him to extend His scepter and hear Him say, “What is it you need, My Beloved?”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want you to understand what we mean when we sing let the worshipers arise there is an authority in the bride of christ that the church at large does not have she doesn't have that same authority she doesn't have his heart like you do and his ear like you do not in this hour but this is what the prophet said he said now sons and daughters who has the most power before god what is an angel an angel is a servant that's right that right he said they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side the sinner the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven oh hallelujah the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin because he's a son son has more authority than a servant of course so when you come into his presence to praise him you don't come as a beggar you don't come as just a servant you have a special invitation as one of his sons to come before him and worship him this is the week of purim and on wednesday night as the sun goes down we begin to think about purim on thursday until thursday night and we think about a little girl she wasn't much to look at but born for a purpose born for a reason little hadassah we call her esther and she came knowing not in the moment what her purpose was but god revealed it to her and when all the other girls concubines came they were all painted up like the world likes to paint up dolled up like the world and frizzy hair and jewels and all that stuff hanging on her on them and they didn't find favor but esther she asked the servant she asked the chamberlain of the king what must i do what can i do to gain his favor oh let me tell you something little bride god has sent a servant to tell us from the word what we must do to be pleasing in his side let's come like esther today i want to worship him i want to get in here and worship him like esther i want to be able to reach up when he extends his scepter toward us today i want to be able to reach up and touch the tip of his scepter and hear him say my beloved what do you have need of today oh make sure as you're going before the king to worship him you remember who you are you're a son of the most high god you weren't born in the ephesian church age you weren't born in thyatira or smyrna or all the other philadelphia you were born for such a time as this to live in laodicea the most wicked age of all not so that you can be overcome by the lukewarm spirit of the age but so that you can overcome in all things remember your authority as you worship him today i'm surrendering my own i surrender to the king [Music] i'm surrendering i surrender to the keys
