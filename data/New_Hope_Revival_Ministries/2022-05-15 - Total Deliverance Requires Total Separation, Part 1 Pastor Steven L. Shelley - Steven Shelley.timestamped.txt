[1:12:07] and
[1:12:08] not knowing anything i don't know
[1:12:10] anything he knows some things i don't
[1:12:12] know anything about mechanics you're at
[1:12:14] the mercy
[1:12:15] you're at the mercy
[1:12:17] but throw yourself on the mercy of god
[1:12:19] that's what i did and he always made a
[1:12:21] way and i know he'll make a way for them
[1:12:25] we couldn't get to them but i know the
[1:12:26] angels were there
[1:12:28] i know the lord was helping them genesis
[1:12:30] chapter 1
[1:12:32] i'm going to give you
[1:12:34] i'm not preaching a sermon this morning
[1:12:36] i'm going to give you a word from the
[1:12:38] lord if you have an ear to hear it
[1:12:41] it's from him
[1:12:43] to you because he loves you so much
[1:12:46] and you may wonder god bless you brother
[1:12:48] stewart also from the uk
[1:12:51] you may wonder when it's all said and
[1:12:53] done
[1:12:56] because it might get a little
[1:13:00] you know might get a little
[1:13:02] tight
[1:13:03] but i want you to know he loves you
[1:13:07] and he wants to help you
[1:13:09] he's here today to help us
[1:13:11] i'm going to need your amens i'm going
[1:13:13] to do that as you might notice from the
[1:13:15] amplified charity
[1:13:17] verse one through five
[1:13:19] in the beginning god
[1:13:22] oh that's a big one right there isn't it
[1:13:25] prepared formed fashioned
[1:13:28] and created the heavens and the earth
[1:13:33] the earth was without form
[1:13:36] and an empty waist
[1:13:38] and darkness was upon the face
[1:13:41] of the very great deep
[1:13:44] the spirit of god was moving moving
[1:13:47] hovering
[1:13:49] brooding
[1:13:50] over the face of the waters
[1:13:53] brother branham said he was just making
[1:13:55] love over the water
[1:13:57] guarding the seed
[1:13:59] and god said
[1:14:00] let there be
[1:14:02] and there was
[1:14:04] light
[1:14:06] the jews believed that light was already
[1:14:08] present
[1:14:10] it was it had already been created by
[1:14:12] god because of the way the hebrew reads
[1:14:15] in genesis 1
[1:14:17] they believe that it was commingled with
[1:14:19] the darkness
[1:14:21] and that when god called let there be
[1:14:23] light that the light stepped forward at
[1:14:26] his command and separated itself from
[1:14:30] the mixture from the darkness
[1:14:33] god saw that the light was
[1:14:36] i thought you'd say tov
[1:14:38] that word in hebrew is toph and god saw
[1:14:41] that the light was good suitable
[1:14:44] pleasant and he approved it
[1:14:46] and listen at what god did
[1:14:49] god
[1:14:50] separated
[1:14:54] god separated
[1:14:59] the prophet said the world is a mixer
[1:15:03] god and his word is a separator
[1:15:08] we know it's his image we know it's his
[1:15:11] character because he was doing it in the
[1:15:13] beginning
[1:15:14] genesis 1
[1:15:16] and god separated the light
[1:15:20] from
[1:15:21] the darkness
[1:15:23] and god called the light day
[1:15:26] and the darkness he called
[1:15:28] and there was evening
[1:15:30] notice there wasn't morning and evening
[1:15:32] and that called a day
[1:15:35] it was evening and morning
[1:15:38] that was called
[1:15:39] one day are you still with me
[1:15:42] turn to x i want you to if you're able
[1:15:45] to stand if you're not then you have
[1:15:47] your seat always
[1:15:49] because god sees your heart
[1:15:51] and he knows that you're here to pay
[1:15:53] respects to the word that's why you're
[1:15:55] here
[1:15:56] it's because you wanted jesus to have
[1:15:58] preeminence today and his word but if
[1:16:01] you a can i want to read all the text
[1:16:05] while you're standing because i want you
[1:16:07] to be fully engaged acts chapter 13
[1:16:10] beginning in verse 1 we'll read to verse
[1:16:13] 3. we're back to king james now there
[1:16:16] were in the church
[1:16:18] that was at antioch certain prophets
[1:16:22] and teachers imagine that
[1:16:25] as barnabas and simeon that was called
[1:16:28] niger and lucius of sarin and manean
[1:16:33] which had been brought up with herod the
[1:16:35] tetrarch
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:37] saul
[1:16:39] i don't know about you but something
[1:16:40] tells me that was kind of a a motley
[1:16:43] crew it was kind of a ragtag group of
[1:16:46] folks there that god has put his hands
[1:16:49] on
[1:16:50] there sounds like diversity
[1:16:52] not diversity and morality
[1:16:55] but diversity in calling
[1:16:59] and in position
[1:17:01] he goes on in verse 2 and they
[1:17:03] ministered to the lord
[1:17:06] that is a very important part of
[1:17:08] ministry
[1:17:10] we minister first to the lord so that we
[1:17:12] can minister to the people
[1:17:15] if i didn't spend time with god this
[1:17:17] week i'd have nothing worth saying this
[1:17:20] morning
[1:17:21] you can't come in here on a spur of a
[1:17:23] moment and think you're going to have
[1:17:24] something to feed the body of christ
[1:17:27] you've got to spend time you also
[1:17:30] must prepare your heart to be in the
[1:17:33] presence of god corporately
[1:17:35] god is an individual god he's not
[1:17:37] dealing with you like the nation of
[1:17:39] israel he's dealing with you as
[1:17:41] individuals
[1:17:42] you've got to have an experience with
[1:17:44] him you've got to taste the original
[1:17:47] manna the pillar of fire has to strike
[1:17:49] your life
[1:17:51] they minister to the lord and fasted
[1:17:55] there's times that it's necessary to
[1:17:58] separate ourselves from food
[1:18:00] and from comfort
[1:18:04] even chocolate on occasion
[1:18:07] and they minister to the lord and fasted
[1:18:10] the holy ghost said oh i like that
[1:18:14] it didn't say paul said didn't say
[1:18:16] barnabas said didn't say
[1:18:18] said the holy ghost
[1:18:20] said
[1:18:22] we don't even know who god was talking
[1:18:24] through
[1:18:25] all we know is that the holy ghost said
[1:18:29] separate
[1:18:34] god separated the light from the
[1:18:36] darkness
[1:18:38] the holy ghost said in the new testament
[1:18:40] church separate me barnabas
[1:18:43] and saul
[1:18:45] for the work where unto
[1:18:48] i have called them
[1:18:52] it's powerful
[1:18:54] and when they had fasted and prayed
[1:18:57] and laid their hands on them
[1:19:00] they commissioned them
[1:19:03] they anointed them
[1:19:05] they set them apart as servants of the
[1:19:09] lord and then they sent them
[1:19:11] what
[1:19:12] away now turn to genesis 12. i know
[1:19:15] you're still standing but i want to
[1:19:18] catch five verses there
[1:19:20] genesis chapter 12. i'll never preach
[1:19:23] this this morning
[1:19:24] never get to it all
[1:19:26] because i had prepared an entire 12
[1:19:29] pages of notes
[1:19:31] that's at least two services worth maybe
[1:19:34] three
[1:19:35] and this morning
[1:19:37] lord said you can't preach that until
[1:19:39] you preach this this has got to be the
[1:19:42] introduction for that i said all right
[1:19:44] lord but you'll have to help me i spent
[1:19:47] all day preparing the message
[1:19:49] how will i ever get the introduction
[1:19:52] message number one ready to go in front
[1:19:54] of message number two but he said he'd
[1:19:56] help me and he has
[1:20:00] now the lord said unto abram
[1:20:02] get thee out
[1:20:05] of thy country
[1:20:07] and from thy kindred
[1:20:11] and from thy father's house
[1:20:15] brother branham called abraham's father
[1:20:17] a fly in his soup
[1:20:23] he said get he apologized
[1:20:25] for the way it sounded but he said it's
[1:20:27] he said it
[1:20:29] he knew something that the bible didn't
[1:20:31] tell us
[1:20:32] but a lot of careful research will tell
[1:20:34] you that abraham's father was an idol
[1:20:36] maker
[1:20:38] he made idols
[1:20:41] and it was not a place for abram to be
[1:20:43] if he was going to hear from god living
[1:20:46] in the house of an idol maker
[1:20:48] walls and shelves of idols and gods and
[1:20:52] pagan gods and false gods made in images
[1:20:58] god had to get abraham out of there he
[1:20:59] said get me out of thy country from thy
[1:21:02] kindred from thy father's house unto a
[1:21:05] land that i will show thee
[1:21:09] if it had been me and you we'd have said
[1:21:11] now what's the name give me the gps
[1:21:13] coordinates
[1:21:14] tell me how long it'll take to get there
[1:21:16] how many lunches i'll need to pack
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:21] what kind of what kind of
[1:21:23] air-conditioned automobile are you going
[1:21:25] to provide
[1:21:27] he said and i will make
[1:21:29] thee
[1:21:30] of thee a great nation and i will bless
[1:21:33] thee
[1:21:34] and make thy name great
[1:21:36] and thou shalt be a
[1:21:40] blessing
[1:21:41] i want just a little bit more in the
[1:21:43] monitor just a little bit more
[1:21:47] and i will bless them
[1:21:51] that bless thee
[1:21:52] [Music]
[1:21:54] and curse him
[1:21:57] that curseth thee
[1:21:59] and in thee
[1:22:00] shall all families of the earth be
[1:22:02] blessed
[1:22:03] there are so many levels
[1:22:06] of of of
[1:22:07] fulfillment
[1:22:09] that have already taken place in these
[1:22:12] verses of scripture did you know that
[1:22:14] the genius
[1:22:16] of the jewish people living in the land
[1:22:19] of israel touches the whole world
[1:22:22] did you know they are
[1:22:24] leaps and bounds ahead of the health
[1:22:27] industry in our nation
[1:22:30] did you know that they are curing lou
[1:22:33] gehrig's disease
[1:22:35] in
[1:22:36] israel unheard of in this nation
[1:22:40] and that it can be done
[1:22:42] the machines and the things needed can
[1:22:45] be done for just a little bit of money
[1:22:47] and yet it'll be years some of us will
[1:22:49] never live long enough to see it
[1:22:51] available in this nation something's
[1:22:54] very seriously wrong
[1:22:56] did you know they have created robotic
[1:22:58] aid in israel that can take a paraplegic
[1:23:01] or quadriplegic man pick him up out of
[1:23:04] the bed
[1:23:06] without the help of a man
[1:23:09] pick him up out of the bed strap him in
[1:23:13] and allow him to move freely throughout
[1:23:16] the house
[1:23:17] and not only that they have created a
[1:23:20] robotic machine that that you can
[1:23:22] someone can strap you in and it will
[1:23:25] restore your ability to walk and move
[1:23:28] your arms and feed yourself as long as
[1:23:30] you've got that device on and i could go
[1:23:32] on and on and on and on and on and on
[1:23:35] even the even the uh
[1:23:37] what we call what's that stuff we call
[1:23:39] uh when when uh liquid stitches or
[1:23:42] something what do they call that when
[1:23:44] people get cut
[1:23:47] liquid band-aid or something like that
[1:23:49] that that is knock-offs
[1:23:51] of what they've got in israel they can
[1:23:53] go right into a battlefield where a man
[1:23:55] is blown half open
[1:23:56] and they've got they've got bandages
[1:23:58] like no other and they've got liquid
[1:24:01] like that like no other to be able to
[1:24:03] put somebody back together and give them
[1:24:05] a greater chance of life so we can say
[1:24:08] already
[1:24:09] the whole world has been blessed because
[1:24:12] abraham abram heard the word of the lord
[1:24:15] and he got away from his comfort zone
[1:24:18] and that which was familiar and his
[1:24:20] father's house and his kindred and his
[1:24:23] land and he said god just show me where
[1:24:26] to go and i'll go
[1:24:27] he departed as the lord has spoken unto
[1:24:29] him and lot
[1:24:31] went with him his nephew is that right
[1:24:34] and abram was 75
[1:24:37] years old
[1:24:40] when i hear people say i guess i'm too
[1:24:42] old to do that now i guess i'll never
[1:24:44] live long enough to do what i thought i
[1:24:46] wanted to do or what i was supposed to
[1:24:47] do
[1:24:49] don't tell abram that
[1:24:51] what a sad confession you're making
[1:24:53] anyway 75 years old before he ever left
[1:24:56] his father's house
[1:25:00] to go do what he was supposed to do
[1:25:03] and he he he was about to yet father
[1:25:06] children
[1:25:08] abram departed and the lord had spoken
[1:25:10] unto him and lot went with him and abram
[1:25:12] was 75 years old when he departed out of
[1:25:15] haran
[1:25:17] and abram took sarah his wife and lord
[1:25:20] his brother's son and all their
[1:25:22] substance that they had gathered and the
[1:25:24] souls that they had gotten in haran and
[1:25:27] they went forth
[1:25:29] to go into the land of canaan
[1:25:32] the land of canaan
[1:25:34] and into the land of canaan
[1:25:36] they came
[1:25:38] now we want to pray right now father
[1:25:41] we thank you that you are god's
[1:25:43] sovereign
[1:25:44] your your presence has been so real i
[1:25:46] don't want to i don't want to step on it
[1:25:48] i don't want to i don't want to cause it
[1:25:50] to to withdraw
[1:25:52] but i want to step into a channel it
[1:25:55] doesn't have to be loud it doesn't have
[1:25:57] to be fast i'm not asking for any
[1:26:00] particular favorite anointing i'm just
[1:26:03] asking you to come lord and help me
[1:26:06] deliver the word of the lord
[1:26:08] if i believe that this word was only for
[1:26:11] those here this morning we'd shut off
[1:26:13] the cameras and shut off the stream and
[1:26:15] we would close in and just preach to us
[1:26:18] but i believe lord that you may use this
[1:26:20] word beyond this house and i'm asking
[1:26:23] you to anoint our ears wherever we may
[1:26:26] be right now to hear this word and apply
[1:26:29] it to our lives and we will give you
[1:26:31] glory and honor and praise for it's in
[1:26:33] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[1:26:35] pray and the church said
[1:26:37] amen you may be seated don't run
[1:26:40] don't run away just hang out here with
[1:26:42] us and let's see what the lord will do
[1:26:45] we'll have fellowship later and great
[1:26:47] time together
[1:26:49] i want to preach a message that i had to
[1:26:51] re-title
[1:26:55] it was to be called total deliverance
[1:27:00] i believe in it
[1:27:02] i'm not one of those who believes that
[1:27:05] there are just things we're stuck with
[1:27:08] and we can't get help from them
[1:27:10] i believe if it's there and it hinders
[1:27:12] you and bothers you and god didn't put
[1:27:15] it on you
[1:27:19] it can get off of you
[1:27:21] we can pray it off you can pray it off
[1:27:24] you can be delivered from it if anybody
[1:27:26] believes that say amen if god has put it
[1:27:28] on you i don't want to be guilty of
[1:27:30] trying to get it off of you
[1:27:32] and there are times that god puts things
[1:27:35] on people to hold them in a place
[1:27:38] until he's ready to move them beyond
[1:27:41] yes
[1:27:42] i've told you before i believe with all
[1:27:44] my heart that god puts his hand on
[1:27:46] people sometime out in sin and holds
[1:27:49] them there
[1:27:52] because he doesn't want him to have to
[1:27:53] go through the pain of religion
[1:27:56] and the hurt of church
[1:27:58] until they're strong enough
[1:28:00] until things have so shifted that they
[1:28:03] would be able to come in and get the
[1:28:04] help and the deliverance that they need
[1:28:06] church is splitting and shifting and all
[1:28:08] kinds of things going on it's no
[1:28:10] environment sometime for new believers
[1:28:12] to come and find the lord so he just
[1:28:14] holds them there somebody said i just
[1:28:16] can't even i just can't even embrace
[1:28:18] something like that i know i know your
[1:28:20] god's not sovereign mind is sovereign
[1:28:24] mind created the darkness just like he
[1:28:27] created the light
[1:28:29] mind created evil just like he was the
[1:28:31] good
[1:28:33] that's the sovereign god i serve
[1:28:35] my my god allows things to come on us
[1:28:38] sometime to hold us in a position of a
[1:28:42] holding pattern
[1:28:44] before
[1:28:45] while we get honed in and matured and
[1:28:48] knocked around a little bit iron
[1:28:50] sharpening iron for the service of the
[1:28:53] lord i hope you're with me and i was
[1:28:56] going to call this just just simple
[1:28:58] brother branham preached a message like
[1:28:59] that a total deliverance once
[1:29:02] and i love it i love that message i
[1:29:05] could just play it this morning and we'd
[1:29:07] all be blessed by it
[1:29:09] because we all need some of that
[1:29:12] and that's what i was going to preach on
[1:29:13] and then i woke up this morning and the
[1:29:15] lord said no
[1:29:17] no
[1:29:18] you can't have total deliverance
[1:29:21] until you have total separation
[1:29:25] from unbelief
[1:29:28] because unbelief in any form
[1:29:30] will stand between you and a total
[1:29:32] deliverance that makes a lot of sense
[1:29:34] doesn't it it should god said it
[1:29:37] so i want to call this series i i hope
[1:29:39] it's not one of them long ones
[1:29:42] but i want to call because i want to get
[1:29:43] to the punch line
[1:29:45] it grieves me to think i won't get to it
[1:29:47] this morning
[1:29:48] but i want to title this total
[1:29:51] deliverance requires total separation
[1:29:56] the two sermons that brother branham
[1:29:58] preached along those lines i told you
[1:30:00] one was called a total deliverance the
[1:30:02] other one was entitled god's word calls
[1:30:04] for a total separation from unbelief
[1:30:09] so you can just combine those thoughts
[1:30:11] together and we'll see where we will go
[1:30:14] this morning i'd like to read from the
[1:30:16] message the patriarch abraham are you
[1:30:18] with me good good good i'm glad now
[1:30:22] abraham was just an ordinary man
[1:30:25] he wasn't something special
[1:30:28] i'm already having church
[1:30:31] i love this
[1:30:33] i love it because in our mind we think
[1:30:36] there are superheroes born and that's
[1:30:39] the one god uses the ones that have no
[1:30:41] problems
[1:30:43] the ones that have rosy upbringings
[1:30:47] good mamas good daddies
[1:30:50] that's the one god uses ones that have
[1:30:52] no nervous problems
[1:30:54] no threat never had a panic attack
[1:30:57] you know those super people that only
[1:30:59] live in the movies
[1:31:04] i've never been blessed to pastor many
[1:31:06] of those
[1:31:08] the folks i know
[1:31:10] are the ones that have been beat up
[1:31:12] battered and shook up
[1:31:14] the ones that have been through
[1:31:16] suffering and heartache and trial
[1:31:19] that's one of the reasons why they can
[1:31:21] embrace the word for the hour
[1:31:25] because their plow their field got
[1:31:27] plowed up
[1:31:29] the clouds of dirt got broke up
[1:31:32] so that god could sow his seed
[1:31:35] amen it takes that kind of a ragtag like
[1:31:39] david's
[1:31:41] champions
[1:31:42] david's great men those who separated
[1:31:45] themselves unto david
[1:31:47] they they come up there they they look
[1:31:49] like a a craziest looking army you'd
[1:31:53] ever seen
[1:31:54] some big and some little
[1:31:57] here comes some big giant of a man said
[1:32:00] david i'm with you
[1:32:02] here comes some little skinny skinny
[1:32:05] skinny man david i'm with you
[1:32:10] some big tall man damn some little short
[1:32:12] man david
[1:32:14] one here probably comes stuttering
[1:32:16] couldn't even hardly introduce himself
[1:32:19] but he got it now i'm with you
[1:32:21] what an army
[1:32:23] to us it doesn't sound like much of a
[1:32:26] polished army but i want you to notice
[1:32:28] what was needed in the hour
[1:32:30] somebody willing to be separated
[1:32:35] for a purpose
[1:32:37] for a cause
[1:32:38] unto a god
[1:32:40] i'm not just preaching about what we
[1:32:42] need to be separated from i'm also
[1:32:44] preaching about what we need to be
[1:32:46] separated unto
[1:32:48] somebody say unto
[1:32:50] because that's the greatest part of
[1:32:52] sanctification it's not what god has
[1:32:54] called you away from it's what god's
[1:32:56] called you into
[1:32:58] he's called you into christ anybody with
[1:33:00] me
[1:33:01] all right so abraham was just an
[1:33:03] ordinary man
[1:33:05] wasn't something special
[1:33:07] i think the prophet said he had hooked
[1:33:09] nose
[1:33:10] that's a little derogatory in our
[1:33:12] society today but i'm guilty sometime of
[1:33:15] saying i believe that man's jewish i
[1:33:17] believe i believe that man's jewish so
[1:33:18] we do that sometime there's no animosity
[1:33:21] in my heart when i say it
[1:33:23] in fact my thoughts and respect toward
[1:33:26] that person go up they don't go down
[1:33:28] all right now god never called him
[1:33:32] as far as we have a record
[1:33:34] until he was 75 years old
[1:33:37] we don't even know that he was hearing
[1:33:39] the voice of god until he got hard of
[1:33:41] hearing down here
[1:33:44] because sometimes you got to get a
[1:33:46] little hard of hearing
[1:33:49] to be able to hear
[1:33:51] his voice
[1:33:53] because it won't be the loudest
[1:33:54] necessary
[1:33:57] it might be the quietest it might be the
[1:34:00] most mysterious
[1:34:01] but we've got to have an ear that is
[1:34:04] tuned
[1:34:06] to hear the voice of god stay with me
[1:34:09] got a lot of waiting to do to get where
[1:34:11] we're going his wife which was his
[1:34:13] half-sister
[1:34:15] being 65 years old at the time they had
[1:34:18] probably lived together since they were
[1:34:20] very young
[1:34:22] since they were related
[1:34:23] and she was barren
[1:34:25] had no children
[1:34:27] 10 years younger we know
[1:34:29] god called a complete separation
[1:34:35] how many of you know by the time you're
[1:34:37] 75 you say yeah well people live longer
[1:34:39] well
[1:34:40] by the time you're 75
[1:34:43] you've sort of drawn you've sort of
[1:34:44] drawing your circle
[1:34:47] and these are the people you're going to
[1:34:48] settle down with
[1:34:50] you you already picked out your
[1:34:52] your uh retirement life and what it's
[1:34:54] going to look like maybe and
[1:34:56] and and you're just kind of ready to sit
[1:34:58] on the porch and rock
[1:35:02] your wife calls you a
[1:35:04] uh shut-in
[1:35:07] and a recluse and says you just don't
[1:35:10] want to be you just want to be a
[1:35:11] homebody
[1:35:12] but by the time you're 75 you have
[1:35:15] earned the right
[1:35:19] to be a little bit of a homebody
[1:35:21] but god said to abram one day
[1:35:24] you're gonna have to give me a complete
[1:35:26] separation
[1:35:28] to separate himself from the rest of the
[1:35:29] world and from all of his people
[1:35:33] and from all of his kindred
[1:35:36] there was a special thing for him to do
[1:35:40] and when god expects you to do a special
[1:35:43] thing
[1:35:44] he demands a complete separation
[1:35:49] read it
[1:35:51] from any
[1:35:53] doubt
[1:35:54] you've got to come to full obedience
[1:35:58] to obey what he says god does what
[1:36:02] demands it you can't do it no other way
[1:36:05] you can't do it no other way
[1:36:07] total obedience total separation from
[1:36:10] unbelief
[1:36:11] now remember this is not to condemn
[1:36:13] anybody when you get in that place and
[1:36:16] you recognize that unbelief is creeping
[1:36:18] into your life almost every single day
[1:36:20] you live on planet earth
[1:36:24] don't tell me no
[1:36:26] don't tell me no all you have to do is
[1:36:28] record your talk
[1:36:30] just record what you say
[1:36:33] we don't talk like people that have
[1:36:35] separated ourselves from total unbelief
[1:36:38] we talk like people that are in the
[1:36:40] throes of despair
[1:36:42] oh yes i've been there in the valley of
[1:36:45] despair
[1:36:46] where the only way out is up look up and
[1:36:49] live but rise above the desolation joy
[1:36:53] without reservation for the power of god
[1:36:55] the word of god is in the inner man
[1:36:58] remember singing that so we've all been
[1:37:01] in the valley of despair
[1:37:03] we've all been in the hard trial but we
[1:37:06] are to be a people who have the ability
[1:37:09] to touch the grace of god and to speak
[1:37:12] the truth of god's word into every
[1:37:15] situation that we face
[1:37:17] i was reading some transcripts this week
[1:37:20] of some sermons that were preached here
[1:37:22] and one sunday
[1:37:23] the man of god came to the pulpit to
[1:37:26] preach to us and here is what he said
[1:37:30] he said i don't want to offend you but
[1:37:33] god just said this was in the middle of
[1:37:35] a series on the mind
[1:37:37] and he said i don't want to offend you
[1:37:39] but god just said some of you will never
[1:37:41] do this because you're too lazy
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:48] that wasn't very encouraging the word i
[1:37:51] thought who is this man of god
[1:37:53] who does he think he is
[1:37:56] standing in my pulpit saying something
[1:37:58] like that
[1:38:00] you really can't be too harsh on him
[1:38:03] though
[1:38:04] when you look down and recognize you are
[1:38:06] him
[1:38:08] it was me who said it
[1:38:11] i remembered it well when i read it how
[1:38:13] the lord had dealt with me that morning
[1:38:15] and he said the people are getting weary
[1:38:17] of the preaching that you're doing on
[1:38:20] the mind because it looks so
[1:38:22] overwhelming to them
[1:38:24] and said so you tell them that as long
[1:38:27] as they're lazy they'll never be able to
[1:38:29] practice this but when they make up
[1:38:31] their mind that it's life or death to
[1:38:33] think right
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:36] life or death to think right
[1:38:38] it's life or death to think right it's
[1:38:41] life or death to talk right come on now
[1:38:45] then they'll get over some of that
[1:38:46] laziness and they'll say if i have to
[1:38:49] wrestle every thought every single
[1:38:51] thought that comes to exalt itself
[1:38:53] against the knowledge i'll wrestle it
[1:38:55] all down i'll pull it all down i'll
[1:38:58] cancel it all i'll stop mid-sentence if
[1:39:00] that's what i have to do because it's
[1:39:02] worth it
[1:39:04] to think right
[1:39:06] and to talk right
[1:39:07] are you with me
[1:39:09] he demands a complete separation from
[1:39:11] any doubt you've got to come to full
[1:39:13] obedience to obey what he said god
[1:39:16] demands it
[1:39:23] you can't do it any or no other
[1:39:26] way
[1:39:29] and now he always sets an example do you
[1:39:32] believe that
[1:39:33] and that was his example of a complete
[1:39:35] separation
[1:39:44] from all of his family
[1:39:46] from all of his kindreds
[1:39:49] and so forth
[1:39:50] to walk a life
[1:39:53] separated
[1:39:54] to god
[1:39:56] the reality is
[1:39:58] everyone will not pay this price
[1:40:02] the reality is
[1:40:04] if you don't you won't walk in the
[1:40:06] blessed favor of the lord
[1:40:09] amen it's just the reality
[1:40:12] it's just the reality you got to stay
[1:40:14] with the word no matter what happens
[1:40:17] and you've got to be willing at time to
[1:40:19] walk away
[1:40:21] from all that is unlocked the word
[1:40:24] because that stuff will get on you
[1:40:27] it'll get on you it'll get on somebody
[1:40:29] you love
[1:40:31] no words have to be spoken somebody said
[1:40:33] well there you know i was in an
[1:40:35] atmosphere and and nothing negative was
[1:40:37] even said you don't understand do you
[1:40:41] spirits are more contagious than the
[1:40:43] common cold
[1:40:48] now sister andy i i didn't just
[1:40:50] you know let you share what you were
[1:40:52] sharing but
[1:40:53] but i held on to it because i wanted to
[1:40:55] share it for you
[1:40:57] and and i did it because you were
[1:40:59] looking at it one way in the natural and
[1:41:01] spiritual too but i was seeing it as
[1:41:03] something that we had already discussed
[1:41:04] this morning
[1:41:06] when i woke up this morning and god
[1:41:08] began to give me this you're not going
[1:41:10] to have a total deliverance until you
[1:41:13] have a total separation from all
[1:41:15] unbelief when god began to deal with me
[1:41:17] like that i don't know why he did but
[1:41:19] before i ever got out of bed he took me
[1:41:21] to the little children
[1:41:24] and and i began to pray over the little
[1:41:26] children in our church we are so blessed
[1:41:30] i told the musicians when we met in my
[1:41:32] office to pray before the service we are
[1:41:34] so or i told the lord in their presence
[1:41:36] we are so blessed
[1:41:37] we've got some of the most amazing kids
[1:41:39] around here that i've ever come in
[1:41:41] contact with in my whole life
[1:41:44] and even if they get on your nerves
[1:41:45] they're amazing and you realize they're
[1:41:47] they're they're just far above and
[1:41:49] beyond what the world is producing
[1:41:53] you just have to realize the uniqueness
[1:41:55] of them they're they're they're they're
[1:41:57] like a different race altogether than
[1:41:59] normal children
[1:42:01] that you see out there in the world
[1:42:03] they're just special
[1:42:05] all of them no i'm not just talking
[1:42:07] about one
[1:42:08] i'm talking about all of them
[1:42:10] god loves them all boys and girls
[1:42:16] and it makes me mad mad mad
[1:42:20] i guess if my voice breaks like that it
[1:42:21] don't sound very mean does it mad
[1:42:24] it makes me mad
[1:42:26] to think that the enemy
[1:42:28] would try to put something on
[1:42:31] one of them
[1:42:34] you know instead of picking on somebody
[1:42:36] his own size
[1:42:37] somebody that's got the word on him
[1:42:40] somebody that knows what a what a
[1:42:43] you know
[1:42:44] we don't have to start calling him names
[1:42:46] i'm not afraid to
[1:42:47] but we don't have to start calling him
[1:42:48] names he knows exactly what he is
[1:42:51] and and it's one thing for him to pick
[1:42:53] on somebody that's got the word to slap
[1:42:55] him back with it or to give him a good
[1:42:57] boo devil but to try to put something on
[1:43:00] some of these children to affect their
[1:43:02] behavior
[1:43:04] or to touch their little bodies
[1:43:06] or to cause them to to be in such a way
[1:43:08] that it affects their social interaction
[1:43:11] with one another now that makes me mad
[1:43:14] mad
[1:43:17] and i remembered this morning and i hope
[1:43:19] this doesn't get too close to home
[1:43:22] but i
[1:43:23] some times in my in my life in my years
[1:43:26] of ministry here we don't have to go
[1:43:28] back further than here
[1:43:30] where there have been some situations
[1:43:32] where little children
[1:43:34] would come under something their
[1:43:36] behavior changed
[1:43:38] their sleep pattern change
[1:43:41] and their demeanor and their social
[1:43:43] interaction changed with other children
[1:43:46] and parents or grandparents would bring
[1:43:49] them to me to pray for or to talk to and
[1:43:53] at least two times
[1:43:55] in the past 10 years
[1:43:57] we were able by the mind of the spirit
[1:44:00] to discern
[1:44:01] and call it out
[1:44:03] and do something about it
[1:44:05] that it was related to something mama or
[1:44:07] daddy was doing in the home
[1:44:09] now that is not to condemn anybody
[1:44:13] but it's to show you that that even in
[1:44:16] the privacy of your own home you can do
[1:44:19] certain things and it affects your
[1:44:21] children because that's how spirits
[1:44:23] operate this is tough preaching now i
[1:44:25] knew it'd be a little hard at times i'm
[1:44:27] just getting started so help me now
[1:44:29] while you can
[1:44:30] and uh i mean little little little odd
[1:44:33] things i don't want to say them i don't
[1:44:35] want to say them
[1:44:36] but little odd things a child
[1:44:39] at an early age with an unusual
[1:44:41] curiosity about things
[1:44:44] and you find out
[1:44:46] that mom or dad how also had a
[1:44:49] overwhelming curiosity about things
[1:44:52] and they were doing things on the
[1:44:53] computer
[1:44:55] and on their phone that they shouldn't
[1:44:56] be doing and that stuff was being
[1:44:59] channeled into the atmosphere of the
[1:45:02] home
[1:45:03] and all the prayer times and hallelujah
[1:45:05] praise the lord couldn't keep that
[1:45:07] influence out of that home because
[1:45:09] somebody had opened up a door
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:15] the only way to solve that problem is to
[1:45:18] shut that door
[1:45:20] and then to pray that residual off of
[1:45:22] that child
[1:45:24] if you're not going to
[1:45:26] disciple your children
[1:45:28] in the faith if you're not going to be
[1:45:31] on guard for their welfare spiritually
[1:45:34] and naturally i'm going to tell you
[1:45:36] something that will draw criticism for
[1:45:38] myself don't have them
[1:45:46] when my wife and i married we didn't
[1:45:48] practice birth control
[1:45:50] because i came from a group of people
[1:45:52] that didn't practice birth control
[1:45:55] no we were not catholics we were
[1:45:57] pentecostal believers
[1:45:59] and we didn't practice birth control so
[1:46:01] nine months later
[1:46:03] after our honeymoon
[1:46:05] we had our first
[1:46:08] we did that
[1:46:09] it wasn't exactly what we expected
[1:46:12] but we knew the
[1:46:13] the
[1:46:14] risk was certainly there
[1:46:17] there's no way in the world now listen
[1:46:19] carefully this is for you
[1:46:20] i know it won't be popular
[1:46:22] there's no way in the world i was going
[1:46:24] to put my wife on birth control pills
[1:46:30] why because i love her too much
[1:46:35] watch how tight it gets
[1:46:38] there's no way in the world i was going
[1:46:39] to do that i wouldn't do that now if i
[1:46:41] was just starting out like some of you
[1:46:43] are no way in the world
[1:46:45] because you see the message i believe
[1:46:47] god gave a word to a prophet to explain
[1:46:49] to him
[1:46:51] that these kinds of adjustments to
[1:46:54] natural hormones
[1:46:57] can cause
[1:47:00] cancer
[1:47:02] so it was a no-brainer for me
[1:47:05] when the doctor said to my
[1:47:06] daughter who suffers with
[1:47:10] i'm not going to give it a name
[1:47:12] but these cysts and tumors in her ovary
[1:47:16] and and multiple times they have popped
[1:47:19] and she's passed out cold
[1:47:22] we didn't talk about it in church we've
[1:47:24] said very little about it i think we
[1:47:25] asked prayer for her once
[1:47:28] but we knew that it was not something in
[1:47:30] that atmosphere at that time that we
[1:47:32] could talk about because we understood
[1:47:34] that it was also a spiritual attack
[1:47:39] and so we wanted to deal with that and
[1:47:41] so when the doctor said that could be
[1:47:44] almost knocked out
[1:47:46] with a birth control pill
[1:47:48] it was a no-brainer for us
[1:47:50] we had absolutely no intention of doing
[1:47:53] that because we know what that can do
[1:47:56] for a woman and breast cancer
[1:48:01] all you have to do is read
[1:48:05] the warning is right there
[1:48:07] so there had to be other ways
[1:48:09] so i'm not just preaching something from
[1:48:12] my old pentecostal background i'm
[1:48:14] telling you there are natural reasons
[1:48:16] why
[1:48:17] these things should should be done
[1:48:19] carefully
[1:48:21] with all of that being said let me say
[1:48:23] to you if you're not going to stay with
[1:48:25] these children and raise them in the
[1:48:27] fear of god and protect them from the
[1:48:29] things that come to harm them if you're
[1:48:32] going to open up the door by letting the
[1:48:34] world come right in come on now
[1:48:37] and entertain your children instead of
[1:48:39] the bible story
[1:48:44] if you're going to let marvel do it
[1:48:49] amen
[1:48:54] what you can handle and what they can
[1:48:55] handle may be something different
[1:48:57] but you bring that into the in the
[1:48:59] atmosphere of your home you're opening a
[1:49:01] door
[1:49:02] there's some times that we have to say
[1:49:04] hey what i used to do i can't do right
[1:49:06] now
[1:49:07] maybe never do again but right now i've
[1:49:10] got to understand and i want you to know
[1:49:12] something as these things go along
[1:49:14] they're going to get worse and worse
[1:49:17] now brother daniel preached that he was
[1:49:19] being rough
[1:49:20] he was being rough i believe in being
[1:49:22] rough
[1:49:22] i believe there's times to be rough
[1:49:25] and somebody went out there to the to
[1:49:26] the to the fellowship
[1:49:28] place where we were eating and kind of
[1:49:29] mocked it
[1:49:33] said wasn't that a marvelous
[1:49:36] message
[1:49:38] because he was referring to
[1:49:40] the influence of the marvel movies and
[1:49:42] the superhero movies and things like
[1:49:44] that i want you to know something i'd be
[1:49:46] very careful
[1:49:49] if that's not your conviction you have
[1:49:51] your own but i'd be very careful
[1:49:54] how i let my tone be about that when
[1:49:56] someone was bringing a warning and felt
[1:49:58] like there was something that they
[1:49:59] should say and that's what i'm doing
[1:50:01] today i'm telling you these things are
[1:50:04] easily transferred
[1:50:06] so when you start getting to the bottom
[1:50:08] of them you're going to want to make
[1:50:09] sure that every door is closed
[1:50:12] you're going to want to make sure that
[1:50:13] everything is dealt with you need to
[1:50:15] make sure mom and daddy don't have
[1:50:16] pornography problems
[1:50:20] you better you better make sure that
[1:50:22] they're not staying up all night playing
[1:50:24] games and doing things they have no
[1:50:26] business to do while their wife is
[1:50:27] laying in the bed somewhere asleep
[1:50:31] chatting with people on these games and
[1:50:33] doing things like that is a very
[1:50:34] dangerous thing
[1:50:36] it's like snapchats and all the rest i'm
[1:50:38] moving off of this
[1:50:40] i'm moving off of this
[1:50:42] but it makes me so mad sometimes that
[1:50:44] little bit of children innocent children
[1:50:47] have to deal with things
[1:50:49] because we make poor decisions
[1:50:51] for their welfare
[1:50:53] god help us
[1:50:54] i've also had parents to come
[1:50:58] and say to me brother shelly i felt
[1:51:01] something coming against me like i
[1:51:03] hadn't felt in years and i realized that
[1:51:07] a grown child in my home or a teenager
[1:51:09] in my home was doing things and involved
[1:51:11] in things and opening doors into things
[1:51:13] they had no business and here i am
[1:51:15] unaware and all of a sudden that kind of
[1:51:17] thing was coming against me and i had to
[1:51:20] cry out for help and some have even said
[1:51:22] pastor pray for me
[1:51:24] because i've got to overcome that thing
[1:51:27] and i've got to see how to do it
[1:51:29] god's word calls for total separation
[1:51:33] from unbelief a total deliverance can
[1:51:36] only come
[1:51:40] when there has been a total separation
[1:51:43] from unbelief i don't know if i'm
[1:51:44] getting any amens
[1:51:46] virtually here but i'm preaching anyway
[1:51:49] now i want to get off of that but i just
[1:51:50] want to tell you that those things are
[1:51:52] so easily transferred and sometimes what
[1:51:54] we think is very innocent behavior and
[1:51:57] innocent interaction can actually cause
[1:52:00] a child to struggle or cause them to
[1:52:02] come under or an adult
[1:52:05] cause them to struggle and not know why
[1:52:07] i don't want you to have this mindset
[1:52:09] that as long as nothing bad is
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:14] sad that there's nothing involved
[1:52:18] i know people that have had to separate
[1:52:19] themselves from their walking partners
[1:52:22] from their from their teacher companions
[1:52:24] from their
[1:52:27] not because of things that were being
[1:52:29] said but because of influence
[1:52:32] you see you sometimes carry it to church
[1:52:33] with you
[1:52:35] and that's not fair to the rest of us
[1:52:37] anybody with me
[1:52:39] now you can take this as a pastor trying
[1:52:41] to stir the hornet's nest or you can
[1:52:44] take it like god gave it it's a word
[1:52:47] from the lord for this body
[1:52:50] and let me just ask you this way who in
[1:52:52] this house would desire a total
[1:52:55] deliverance in your life just hold up
[1:52:57] your hand
[1:53:00] then there's a price
[1:53:03] abraham had to pay a price
[1:53:07] isaiah brother branham i'll read in a
[1:53:09] minute he said isaiah he said all the
[1:53:11] prophets
[1:53:12] had to pay this prize
[1:53:14] and believers today must pay the same
[1:53:17] price
[1:53:18] and we did some of us have had to do
[1:53:19] that from our many of our denominational
[1:53:22] friends and so forth it's been a it's
[1:53:24] been a tough a tough way to go when the
[1:53:26] truth comes
[1:53:29] they like to mock
[1:53:31] what they don't understand they like
[1:53:33] them all sometimes they do understand it
[1:53:35] because they were in it they were in
[1:53:36] some of it they went through some of it
[1:53:39] some of them came out of pentecost
[1:53:40] stricter than what pentecost is today
[1:53:43] come on now are you still with me
[1:53:45] and when god expects you to do this is
[1:53:48] paragraph five the patriarch abraham and
[1:53:50] when god supper expects you to do a
[1:53:53] special thing we're going backward here
[1:53:55] just a minute he demands a complete
[1:53:57] separation from any doubt you've got to
[1:53:59] come to full obedience to obey what he
[1:54:01] says god demands it you can do it no
[1:54:04] other way
[1:54:06] abraham and his seed after him paragraph
[1:54:08] 86 we started reading that now now and
[1:54:12] then notice
[1:54:13] as soon as abraham believed god by
[1:54:16] justification
[1:54:17] he said believing on the lord were
[1:54:19] justified immediately god called abraham
[1:54:22] to total separation from all unbelief
[1:54:24] before he would give him the holy ghost
[1:54:26] before he had any kind of experience
[1:54:28] uh with a supernatural god
[1:54:32] he just calls him out and abraham
[1:54:34] answers a god that he don't even know
[1:54:36] his name
[1:54:38] who are you
[1:54:40] he just hears a voice abram abram gets
[1:54:43] he out
[1:54:45] you know it takes faith to follow a
[1:54:47] voice
[1:54:49] that you don't know
[1:54:50] to serve a god that you don't know
[1:54:53] but abraham had lived with idols
[1:54:57] he grew up with false gods
[1:55:00] he grew up with imitation
[1:55:02] so somehow in the midst of all of that
[1:55:05] fanaticism and then all of that
[1:55:07] imitation he heard a true voice
[1:55:10] oh it spoke to him and abram was willing
[1:55:12] to obey god
[1:55:14] so just as soon as he was justified
[1:55:16] believing on the lord immediately god
[1:55:18] called abraham to total separation from
[1:55:20] all unbelief he said is that the way he
[1:55:22] did in you
[1:55:24] it's a question
[1:55:26] separate yourself from your kindreds
[1:55:29] from all your associates
[1:55:31] come out of the pool rooms
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:47] i had a pastor tell me in this message
[1:55:53] i got some that go to the pool halls
[1:55:56] they don't gamble anymore and they don't
[1:55:57] drink anymore but they just love the
[1:55:59] game of pool
[1:56:03] i'm not going to say a word against the
[1:56:05] game of pool
[1:56:07] i don't care for it
[1:56:09] it's not something i enjoy
[1:56:12] but i happen to know there are people in
[1:56:13] this room very good at it
[1:56:16] and i wouldn't touch their lives
[1:56:19] with a 10-foot pole
[1:56:20] but i will tell you this they don't go
[1:56:22] to the pool hall to play it
[1:56:26] need some help
[1:56:28] they don't go down with their old
[1:56:29] associates to play it
[1:56:32] oh i'm just going down there to be a
[1:56:33] light
[1:56:34] i just drink my coca-cola while they're
[1:56:37] drinking their rum and coke
[1:56:39] i'm just going down there to be a
[1:56:41] blessing i'm just going down now to be a
[1:56:43] witness let me tell you something if god
[1:56:45] sends you to the pool hall he's probably
[1:56:47] going to send you with your bible under
[1:56:48] your arm and your leather girdle on
[1:56:52] he's probably going to send you in like
[1:56:54] a john the baptist you're probably not
[1:56:56] going to go in making friends
[1:56:59] [Applause]
[1:57:01] now that being said he did send me one
[1:57:04] time
[1:57:06] when i was still in high school
[1:57:08] and no i didn't wear a leather girdle
[1:57:10] but i went with all the mentors in my
[1:57:13] life to guard me and to watch over me
[1:57:15] because i knew the lord has sent me
[1:57:17] there for a specific purpose and that
[1:57:19] was to reach out to the woman who was
[1:57:21] there to entertain some of you have
[1:57:23] heard me tell the story of meeting an
[1:57:25] entertainer by the name of bigfrida
[1:57:27] wallace
[1:57:29] and god sent me to her she's dead
[1:57:32] but god sent me to her
[1:57:34] and when i knew that god was speaking to
[1:57:36] me and giving me a vision and telling me
[1:57:39] where to go and how to find her
[1:57:41] i went to my school teacher at the
[1:57:43] christian school and his brother my
[1:57:45] principal and i said i have found where
[1:57:48] she is i'm going to see her and i want
[1:57:51] you all to go with me as as my
[1:57:54] protectors and as my guards because i
[1:57:57] don't want to be caught up in anything
[1:57:59] that's not for me so there's a right way
[1:58:04] and i'll have to tell that
[1:58:07] that story another time
[1:58:10] no
[1:58:13] it's not in my notes
[1:58:16] when i walk in there this big old woman
[1:58:18] is i mean big folks
[1:58:20] big
[1:58:22] they didn't call her big free to wallace
[1:58:23] for nothing
[1:58:25] big
[1:58:26] and she had a piano bar
[1:58:28] that they brought in a truck a grand
[1:58:30] piano bar with a ledge around it and she
[1:58:33] was singing them all him them old songs
[1:58:35] not hims yet
[1:58:37] the closest she got to him
[1:58:40] i hear him telling that story
[1:58:44] she sung just a bowl of
[1:58:47] collard greens
[1:58:51] i said that ain't gonna get it
[1:58:54] lord you're gonna have to give me an
[1:58:55] opportunity to talk to her
[1:58:59] room full of people at tables and she
[1:59:01] looked right down there at me and winked
[1:59:02] at me and she said what in the world is
[1:59:04] a nice guy like you doing in a place
[1:59:06] like this
[1:59:08] on the microphone
[1:59:10] and she said i got a feeling you could
[1:59:11] sing a song or two for us
[1:59:14] why don't you do it
[1:59:18] hallelujah
[1:59:20] so in my senior year of high school we
[1:59:23] had revival down at the piano bar
[1:59:26] but i knew that i had an appointment to
[1:59:28] go
[1:59:29] and i had guards in place to go
[1:59:32] you don't want to go back to your old
[1:59:34] hates and your old hearts
[1:59:38] and your old bodies
[1:59:41] you want to know that you know that you
[1:59:44] know that you've risen above the pool
[1:59:48] that has once enslaved you
[1:59:50] he said come out of the pool room come
[1:59:52] out of the dance halls
[1:59:54] come away from the things of the world
[1:59:57] god calls for a total separation to
[2:00:00] abraham's seed
[2:00:04] you may not be abraham's natural seed
[2:00:06] but you're a part of the royal seed of
[2:00:09] abraham
[2:00:11] and he said he's called that's what he
[2:00:12] called abraham to and that's what he's
[2:00:14] calling us to now if you'll give me the
[2:00:17] message there's a lot of yawning on
[2:00:18] going on in here i'm so sorry that
[2:00:20] you're feeling sleepy and i'm gonna i'm
[2:00:22] gonna
[2:00:24] for being there i didn't see him
[2:00:25] particularly but we would cut him a
[2:00:27] little slack if he had the yawn because
[2:00:29] he worked all night last night
[2:00:31] and uh but kendra pinch him hard as you
[2:00:33] can
[2:00:34] if he dozes off i mean just
[2:00:37] do like maul used to do me and get under
[2:00:39] there and don't don't stop twisting
[2:00:40] until your arm won't go no further and
[2:00:42] he'll wake right up
[2:00:44] genesis 13
[2:00:47] this is a lot of reading here
[2:00:50] god bless you that you that are joining
[2:00:51] us now from zambia god bless you
[2:00:55] and lord also
[2:00:57] which went with abram had flocks and
[2:00:59] herds and tents
[2:01:01] and the land was not able to bear them
[2:01:04] that they might dwell together for their
[2:01:06] substance was great so that they could
[2:01:08] not dwell together i don't know if you
[2:01:10] remember this or not but years ago i
[2:01:11] preached a message here called anybody
[2:01:13] remember
[2:01:15] the seven separations of abraham
[2:01:17] now i know jennifer stark you weren't
[2:01:19] here when i preached the message seven
[2:01:21] separations of abraham so somebody had
[2:01:23] to share that with you
[2:01:25] seven things
[2:01:28] that god called abram
[2:01:30] to separate himself from
[2:01:32] so that he could do what god called him
[2:01:35] to do and and listen to how it sounds
[2:01:38] god called him out from his kindred in
[2:01:40] his father's house but let him take a
[2:01:42] lot with him
[2:01:47] and the word here says in just a minute
[2:01:49] the prophet said god couldn't bless him
[2:01:53] god couldn't bless him
[2:01:55] because he hadn't paid the full price of
[2:01:56] obedience
[2:01:58] god said get away from your kin folk
[2:02:00] don't drag them all with you
[2:02:04] powerful
[2:02:05] he said the land was not able to bear
[2:02:07] them they might dwell together for their
[2:02:08] substance was great so that they could
[2:02:10] not dwell together read on and there was
[2:02:12] strife between the herdsmen of abram's
[2:02:14] cattle and the herdsmen of lot's cattle
[2:02:16] and the canaanite and the perizzite
[2:02:18] dwelled then in the land and abram said
[2:02:22] in the lot let there be no strife
[2:02:24] i pray thee between me and thee and
[2:02:27] between my herdmen and thy herdmen for
[2:02:29] we be brethren
[2:02:31] it's not the whole land before thee
[2:02:34] separate thyself i pray thee from me
[2:02:41] now the first time god told abraham to
[2:02:43] separate himself
[2:02:44] and to come
[2:02:46] and now with him has come his nephew and
[2:02:49] the time has come now that abraham
[2:02:52] instead of saying i can't carry you any
[2:02:54] longer we can't dwell like this anymore
[2:02:57] he looks at his nephew lot and he says
[2:03:00] separate thyself from me
[2:03:02] there comes a time that separation has
[2:03:04] to look like that
[2:03:06] you go your way
[2:03:08] and i'll go my way
[2:03:11] and we will remember fondly
[2:03:14] the times we had together
[2:03:18] there just won't be no more
[2:03:20] anybody with me
[2:03:21] if i'm making this say something it
[2:03:23] shouldn't say you correct me at the end
[2:03:25] but better hear everything i'm going to
[2:03:27] read before you do
[2:03:29] it's not the whole land so he said if
[2:03:31] thou will take the left hand separate
[2:03:33] thyself i pray thee from me if thou will
[2:03:36] take the left hand then i will go to the
[2:03:38] right or if thou depart to the right
[2:03:40] hand then i will go to the left
[2:03:43] and lot lifted up his eyes and i want
[2:03:45] you to know in this moment of separation
[2:03:50] the decision that he was about to make
[2:03:53] not in separating himself it was the
[2:03:56] will of god that they separate
[2:03:58] themselves
[2:04:00] but he had a decision to make
[2:04:02] he had to choose what to do
[2:04:05] with his inheritance
[2:04:07] [Applause]
[2:04:12] i think it's clear to you and i in this
[2:04:14] hour
[2:04:15] of life when we walk through life that
[2:04:18] decisions we make
[2:04:20] not only affect us
[2:04:22] but they affect our posterity they
[2:04:24] affect our children our inheritance they
[2:04:27] affect those who come
[2:04:28] behind us
[2:04:30] don't you think that god doesn't see
[2:04:31] that don't you think that god doesn't
[2:04:33] know about that don't you think that
[2:04:35] god's not able to break through that
[2:04:37] he can break through that he can redeem
[2:04:40] that
[2:04:41] but you better keep your hands off
[2:04:44] of what god's doing
[2:04:46] you can't pray off what god's putting on
[2:04:49] anybody with me
[2:04:51] okay so he said lot lifted up his eyes
[2:04:53] and he was about to make us
[2:04:55] abraham said i don't care
[2:04:57] you go that way i'll go this way or you
[2:04:59] go that way i'll go that way it doesn't
[2:05:00] matter to me what my inheritance is
[2:05:04] abraham didn't have to worry whoa about
[2:05:06] our abram he didn't have to worry about
[2:05:08] what his inheritance was going to look
[2:05:09] like he had a promise
[2:05:12] but that promise was never going to be
[2:05:14] fulfilled until he had totally separated
[2:05:17] himself from unbelief
[2:05:19] jesus said if you mourners will just get
[2:05:21] out of the room here
[2:05:24] i'll take care of this little girl
[2:05:27] if you all would just get your
[2:05:28] unbelieving your carrions on out of here
[2:05:31] you paid professional mourners
[2:05:34] i think i go to church with some
[2:05:35] sometime
[2:05:38] professional mourners
[2:05:41] carry every burden carry every situation
[2:05:44] you carry only what god lays on you
[2:05:46] don't you go around carrying illegal
[2:05:48] burdens
[2:05:50] if it's not your burden you let somebody
[2:05:52] else carry it
[2:05:53] if you carry everybody's burden you will
[2:05:56] wear yourself down
[2:06:00] only the burden god assigns to you
[2:06:05] [Music]
[2:06:07] boy that's we're getting some practical
[2:06:09] help here for listening
[2:06:11] now he goes on you know
[2:06:13] lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all
[2:06:14] the plains of jordan that it was well
[2:06:17] watered everywhere oh my his eyes are
[2:06:19] getting
[2:06:21] looking beautiful down there before the
[2:06:23] lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even
[2:06:25] as the garden of the lord like the land
[2:06:27] of egypt is thou comest unto zoar
[2:06:30] then lot chose him all the plains of
[2:06:33] jordan why because he looked down so how
[2:06:35] fertile they were
[2:06:37] oh he wasn't a dumb businessman
[2:06:41] he knew exactly what he was doing
[2:06:43] i'm going to secure a good future for my
[2:06:45] folks
[2:06:48] and he chose the plane of jordan
[2:06:50] the worst decision
[2:06:53] of his life
[2:06:56] it cost him his wife
[2:06:59] it cost him the innocency of his
[2:07:01] daughters
[2:07:07] like the man standing on my front porch
[2:07:09] years ago they said don't you worry
[2:07:11] brother shelly
[2:07:12] we're leaving the church because we feel
[2:07:14] like god has called us out but the next
[2:07:16] time you see us you won't see any
[2:07:18] difference in us at all
[2:07:20] my wife will still have long hair she'll
[2:07:22] still wear her skirt my daughters will
[2:07:25] still have long hair and they'll still
[2:07:27] weld their skirt and you'll be proud of
[2:07:29] us
[2:07:30] it wasn't even 30 days
[2:07:33] was that man lying to me no he thought
[2:07:36] that he had his inheritance
[2:07:39] under his protection
[2:07:41] but he didn't understand that he was
[2:07:42] taking them out from under another head
[2:07:45] that god had ordained over them
[2:07:48] for that moment of protection in their
[2:07:50] life and in doing so it threw them to
[2:07:53] the wilds of the enemy
[2:07:55] all we can do is pray for somebody like
[2:07:57] that he really thought i could protect
[2:07:59] them lot probably thought i'm making the
[2:08:02] best choice
[2:08:04] by going
[2:08:05] separation had to happen
[2:08:07] the separation had to happen abraham
[2:08:09] couldn't inherit his promise with lot
[2:08:11] hanging around
[2:08:14] but lot chose the wrong direction to
[2:08:16] pitch his tent to war didn't he
[2:08:18] a lot then lot okay go on
[2:08:21] separated themselves one for another
[2:08:22] abram dwelled in the land of canaan
[2:08:25] and lot dwelled in the cities of the
[2:08:27] plain and look what he did
[2:08:29] now how many homeless preachers ever
[2:08:31] preached this line
[2:08:32] and pitched his tent towards sodom
[2:08:37] toward hollywood
[2:08:39] toward california
[2:08:42] he just pitched his tent in the
[2:08:43] direction of the filth and the smut
[2:08:47] he got his eyes on the on the flashing
[2:08:49] lights of uh of sodom and gomorrah and
[2:08:52] he said my
[2:08:54] my won't my wife love the beauty parlor
[2:08:56] of sodom and want my daughter's love
[2:08:59] all the pampering and and spa treatment
[2:09:02] that they can get down there in sodom
[2:09:04] won't they love the manicures
[2:09:10] i didn't say there's nothing wrong with
[2:09:12] taking care of your fingernails but you
[2:09:14] go in a place like that and they talk
[2:09:15] you into painting them
[2:09:20] and you've got the spirit of the world
[2:09:21] after you
[2:09:23] you're going to have to make up your
[2:09:24] mind that god's word calls for a total
[2:09:26] separation from all unbelief
[2:09:29] you can't look like the world and smell
[2:09:31] like the world and act like the world
[2:09:33] and belong to christ in this last hour i
[2:09:36] know that preaching is too hard for some
[2:09:38] on the internet but i know it's not too
[2:09:40] hard for this house
[2:09:41] come on now
[2:09:43] i'm not trying to be a fanatic i'm just
[2:09:45] trying to tell you it matters
[2:09:49] so we pitched his tent towards sodom and
[2:09:51] he didn't listen he didn't move to sodom
[2:09:53] he just started easing in that
[2:09:56] [Music]
[2:10:00] she just trimmed her bangs
[2:10:04] she just trimmed the length because
[2:10:06] everybody knows the split ends if you
[2:10:08] don't do something about them
[2:10:11] [Music]
[2:10:14] because there are still people in this
[2:10:15] world so dumb they think the hair grows
[2:10:17] from the ends
[2:10:21] and not from the roots
[2:10:27] i've had people in this room some i love
[2:10:29] arguing me over something like that i'm
[2:10:31] not buying
[2:10:33] well i read on google i don't care what
[2:10:35] you read on google
[2:10:40] your hair don't grow down here it grows
[2:10:41] from up here
[2:10:42] if you want to do something to help it
[2:10:44] grow you do something up here
[2:10:49] you get some good vitamins and some good
[2:10:51] treatment or something and you do
[2:10:53] something take care of it that way but
[2:10:55] keep the scissors out of it
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:11:00] they came here the jacksonites came here
[2:11:02] they did they came here
[2:11:04] years ago stood on the porch of the old
[2:11:06] church and told me that they had now a
[2:11:08] revelation that as long as it was an
[2:11:10] inch at a time or a half an inch at a
[2:11:12] time that it would be all right
[2:11:15] and that's why when you see those folks
[2:11:17] today it's up to the shoulder and blue
[2:11:23] because that little bit of compromise
[2:11:26] sets you up
[2:11:29] whoa boy i used to preach that and they
[2:11:32] would shout down the aisle
[2:11:35] they'd think they had reached the sunny
[2:11:38] banks of sweet deliverance
[2:11:40] but now you preach a little like that
[2:11:42] and what happens
[2:11:45] even people that believe it won't aim in
[2:11:46] it
[2:11:47] because you're afraid somebody will hear
[2:11:48] you or somebody will see you on the
[2:11:50] internet
[2:11:51] the truth is the truth is the truth is
[2:11:53] the truth is the truth is the truth
[2:11:55] whoa
[2:11:57] all right let's go on now
[2:12:00] abraham dwelled in the land of canaan
[2:12:01] and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain
[2:12:03] and pitched his tent towards sodom but
[2:12:05] the men of sodom were wicked and sinners
[2:12:08] before the lord exceedingly and the lord
[2:12:10] said unto abram after that lot was
[2:12:12] separated from him lip
[2:12:15] oh
[2:12:16] let's don't miss that
[2:12:18] and the lord said unto abram after that
[2:12:21] lot was separated from him
[2:12:25] now you're about to get the full
[2:12:27] blessing
[2:12:28] lift up now thine eyes and look from the
[2:12:31] place where thou art northward and
[2:12:33] southward and eastward and westward
[2:12:37] for all the land which thou seest
[2:12:40] whoa
[2:12:41] all of it
[2:12:45] for all the land which thou see seest to
[2:12:47] thee will i give it
[2:12:50] and to thy
[2:12:52] seed forever
[2:12:56] don't you tell me that israel is
[2:12:58] occupying the land
[2:13:01] don't tell me that they're squatting on
[2:13:04] the land that belongs to palestinians
[2:13:07] i'll show you right here in the word
[2:13:10] but every bit of it from the land from
[2:13:13] the mountain
[2:13:15] from moray all the way across as far as
[2:13:19] the eye can see
[2:13:21] scripture says clean to the euphrates
[2:13:26] it's theirs
[2:13:27] i'll give it to you and your seed
[2:13:29] forever and you know what they probably
[2:13:31] thought they had it in the bank
[2:13:33] let's put in a pocket
[2:13:35] they didn't know they were gonna have to
[2:13:36] fight for it and fight for it and fight
[2:13:39] for it and fight for it and every year
[2:13:41] we were gonna come to a screeching halt
[2:13:42] in a moment of silence
[2:13:44] to honor the tens of thousands who have
[2:13:46] died
[2:13:48] trying to protect the promise
[2:13:50] that god gave to abraham
[2:13:53] it matters
[2:13:55] and i will make thy seed as the dust of
[2:13:57] the earth so that if a man can number
[2:13:59] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[2:14:00] seed also be numbered
[2:14:02] arise and walk through the land in the
[2:14:04] length of it and the breath of it for i
[2:14:06] will give it unto thee just step on it
[2:14:10] abram
[2:14:12] stab on it let your sandals walk all
[2:14:15] over it
[2:14:17] keep your eyes off sodom and don't cry
[2:14:20] another tear over light
[2:14:26] put your faith in the promise
[2:14:32] and abraham removed his tent and came
[2:14:33] and dwelt in the land of memory which is
[2:14:35] in hebron and built there an altar unto
[2:14:38] the lord
[2:14:38] and if you go to israel and you're able
[2:14:40] to get into hebron you're not always
[2:14:42] able to get in there you weren't always
[2:14:44] able to get in there
[2:14:46] in times past when i was there in 1977
[2:14:51] is that right
[2:14:52] 79 thank you i knew it didn't sound
[2:14:54] right
[2:14:55] when i was there in 1979 they started
[2:14:58] shooting at our bus
[2:15:00] in 79
[2:15:03] and we had to take the curb and the
[2:15:05] sidewalk
[2:15:06] and i was 11 years old and that bus took
[2:15:09] that curb that sidewalk and began to
[2:15:11] knock out orange stands and
[2:15:14] banana stands
[2:15:16] i tell you it was the most exciting
[2:15:17] thing that happened to me in my little
[2:15:18] life
[2:15:20] the bus shaken as them as some bullets
[2:15:23] was hitting the side of the bus but it
[2:15:25] was an armored bus
[2:15:27] we didn't know it until they come on
[2:15:29] them
[2:15:30] said don't worry
[2:15:31] unless something fails
[2:15:36] they got us out of there why because
[2:15:38] it's disputed land today
[2:15:42] right there in
[2:15:43] hebron
[2:15:45] is the tomb of abraham isaac and jacob
[2:15:49] so god allowed his bones to lay there
[2:15:52] where the promise was made to him i
[2:15:55] think that's pretty powerful
[2:15:58] i won't get on that
[2:16:01] if i did i'd have to share the
[2:16:02] experience i i've been putting some
[2:16:04] things together chronologically for
[2:16:06] myself to make my life a little easier
[2:16:09] i've been working on it some this week
[2:16:10] and i've been reading some stuff and i'm
[2:16:12] thinking my what a oh oh my what we have
[2:16:16] to look forward to
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:20] and i read that experience where god
[2:16:22] allowed us to carry the bones of the
[2:16:24] prophet back to the city that he loved
[2:16:26] so dearly and i began to read the
[2:16:28] promises attached to that
[2:16:30] i said lord i want my part of that
[2:16:33] i want my part of that if others decide
[2:16:35] not to have their part i want my part
[2:16:37] and i'll take their part too
[2:16:42] all right we've got some promises here
[2:16:44] now let's go on i i'm i've got to hurry
[2:16:47] it's 1 13.
[2:16:48] where were we charity
[2:16:51] oh that's the end of it isn't it which
[2:16:53] is in heaven and build there an altar
[2:16:55] unto the lord okay that's right we'll go
[2:16:56] right into abraham's seed paragraph 25
[2:16:59] abraham like god
[2:17:03] called those things which were not as
[2:17:05] though they were
[2:17:09] anything contrary to god's promise was a
[2:17:11] lie to abraham
[2:17:18] i remember them sitting in my office and
[2:17:20] telling me now we all have come to
[2:17:21] understand and believe that this place
[2:17:23] will never be filled
[2:17:26] oh no we haven't
[2:17:28] no we haven't
[2:17:30] i haven't come to that place
[2:17:35] that's why we laid that that's why we
[2:17:37] laid that floating floor on the studio
[2:17:39] when god said this is a time that's why
[2:17:40] we laid it right we didn't cut no carpet
[2:17:42] out we laid it right on top of the
[2:17:44] carpet it may not look pretty but if we
[2:17:46] ever need to take them walls out we know
[2:17:48] exactly how to get them out
[2:17:51] we know exactly how
[2:17:53] we know it's not about number and it's
[2:17:55] not about pack-a-pew
[2:17:57] and we're not going to give anybody a
[2:17:59] cable subscription for bringing the most
[2:18:01] people to church
[2:18:02] like some of the denominational churches
[2:18:04] do can you imagine giving somebody a
[2:18:06] year's cable giving somebody a year of
[2:18:08] cable tv because they brought the most
[2:18:10] people to sunday school
[2:18:16] don't folks just surprise you with their
[2:18:18] stupidity
[2:18:20] we're not going to do that but we
[2:18:22] believe that as god begins to fulfill
[2:18:24] his word
[2:18:26] we'll have to make preparation
[2:18:30] i got to hurry abraham like god called
[2:18:32] those things that were not as though
[2:18:34] they were anything contrary to god's
[2:18:36] promise was a lie to abraham if it
[2:18:38] didn't fit the promise abraham said
[2:18:41] that's a lie
[2:18:43] that's a lie
[2:18:44] whoa
[2:18:45] you want to make your family mad that's
[2:18:47] a lie
[2:18:50] that's a lie
[2:18:51] i don't hear that that don't fit the
[2:18:53] promise
[2:18:55] ain't got no time for that up in here
[2:18:57] that don't fit the promise
[2:19:00] i'm hanging my life on the promise
[2:19:04] anything contrary to god's promise was a
[2:19:06] lie to abraham anything contrary so then
[2:19:08] when abraham started out when god called
[2:19:11] him you're still with me
[2:19:13] everybody
[2:19:14] now watch the first thing god did to
[2:19:17] abraham was call an absolute separation
[2:19:20] exactly you've got to separate yourself
[2:19:22] from all unbelief
[2:19:24] get away from it
[2:19:25] that's it
[2:19:26] you've got to get away
[2:19:28] from unbelief
[2:19:30] god called abraham to separate himself
[2:19:32] from his kindred from everything that he
[2:19:34] had that he might walk with him
[2:19:37] give him a strange land
[2:19:43] i'm looking over there dana
[2:19:45] give him a strange land
[2:19:51] that's the way every sinner when he gets
[2:19:53] saved he comes into a strange land or
[2:19:55] when someone's calling some
[2:19:57] body when god's calling somebody to
[2:19:59] another place
[2:20:00] to follow him
[2:20:02] you can follow god wherever god plants
[2:20:04] you i don't mean to say it that way but
[2:20:06] when god calls you to follow you better
[2:20:08] follow
[2:20:09] when he says go you better go and he
[2:20:11] says stay you better stay
[2:20:13] and you better not check with too many
[2:20:20] god's will may not be a consensus
[2:20:24] it may not be a majority
[2:20:28] oh strange land this is what i'm trying
[2:20:31] to get to
[2:20:33] among
[2:20:34] strange
[2:20:36] people
[2:20:39] do i ever feel the need sometime to
[2:20:41] explain us
[2:20:44] i do
[2:20:46] but i don't
[2:20:48] i do but i don't
[2:20:51] i feel sorry for some of the people you
[2:20:53] all invite
[2:20:56] you bring them in here you don't tell
[2:20:58] them anything about us
[2:21:02] they come in blind
[2:21:06] they think they're coming into a
[2:21:07] methodist meeting
[2:21:14] they don't have any idea
[2:21:21] they don't know they're coming a bunch
[2:21:23] of
[2:21:24] tongue talking pew jumping
[2:21:27] i'll running flag waving
[2:21:30] amen screaming
[2:21:33] [Applause]
[2:21:35] word of god living
[2:21:37] [Applause]
[2:21:39] i don't have any idea
[2:21:41] he said that's the way he comes into a
[2:21:43] strange land among strange people god
[2:21:45] calls for a separation
[2:21:50] now move on uh
[2:21:52] jehovah jireh number one in in
[2:21:54] louisville mississippi
[2:21:56] paragraph 42 he said another thing he
[2:21:58] told him to do to separate himself from
[2:22:01] his kindred
[2:22:03] and all of his people
[2:22:07] god in order to get a man or a woman boy
[2:22:09] or girl to obey him you have to separate
[2:22:12] yourself from all unbelief that's right
[2:22:14] until you totally separate yourself from
[2:22:16] anything contrary to that word and
[2:22:18] believe it you
[2:22:20] god calls for a total separation
[2:22:25] are you still with me
[2:22:27] just a minute my page is stuck together
[2:22:30] all right move on now to the faith of
[2:22:33] abraham paragraph 42.
[2:22:35] it's a lot of reading but i want you to
[2:22:36] hear it now god said then abraham
[2:22:39] in order to walk with me you've got to
[2:22:41] separate yourself from the rest of him
[2:22:44] god demands a total separation but you
[2:22:46] want to bring a lot of the world along
[2:22:48] with you
[2:22:50] when you come in and receive the holy
[2:22:52] ghost you say well i was taught to be
[2:22:53] this and i was taught the days of
[2:22:54] miracles past you better leave that
[2:22:56] thing alone you better leave that thing
[2:22:58] alone
[2:22:59] as long as that holds with you
[2:23:01] it'd be like abraham started out with
[2:23:03] lot and his father
[2:23:06] there's trouble in the camp
[2:23:09] and god never did bless abraham until he
[2:23:14] separated himself and done what god told
[2:23:17] him to do
[2:23:18] he couldn't come with his father out
[2:23:22] he couldn't come with his nephew out
[2:23:25] he had to come out
[2:23:28] and he had to leave
[2:23:29] everything else on the other side
[2:23:33] let god deal let me tell you something
[2:23:35] god knows how to deal with our loved
[2:23:38] ones
[2:23:44] now i'm not i want you to know i'm not
[2:23:45] telling you not to have anything to do
[2:23:47] with your family that is not what i'm
[2:23:48] preaching here
[2:23:50] but i'm telling you you should be very
[2:23:53] very very careful
[2:23:55] what kind of a spirit
[2:23:58] you were around
[2:24:01] and if i were you i wouldn't be
[2:24:02] volunteering myself
[2:24:06] and submitting myself to that over and
[2:24:08] over and over again i'd be very wise i'd
[2:24:10] be very careful and i certainly wouldn't
[2:24:13] send my children into that
[2:24:15] amen
[2:24:17] and god never did bless abraham until he
[2:24:19] separated himself and done what god told
[2:24:21] him to do and you'll listen god woke me
[2:24:23] up this morning he said you cannot
[2:24:25] preach a total deliverance
[2:24:27] until you preach
[2:24:30] a total separation
[2:24:32] now this was not i'm telling you this
[2:24:34] was not
[2:24:36] before i was ever out of bed usually i
[2:24:39] get up go to the dining room table i
[2:24:41] usually put my mouse and my pad mouse

[2:25:14] it's always wonderful when we both say
[2:25:16] yes but it's rare
[2:25:18] and i said i don't think so
[2:25:21] uh i know i was sleeping some but i know
[2:25:23] when i wasn't sleeping i was awake
[2:25:33] she knows my language
[2:25:35] i chuckled when i said it but all i
[2:25:38] could what i meant to say was and what i
[2:25:40] could have said was i remember being
[2:25:42] awake a lot
[2:25:44] things were just rolling over
[2:25:47] a couple of people reached out to me
[2:25:48] last night i'm praying for you asking
[2:25:50] god to use you tomorrow and help you and
[2:25:54] last night and i appreciated that
[2:25:55] because i was sensing the pressure of
[2:25:58] preaching on a total deliverance
[2:26:00] i felt like it's necessary and it is
[2:26:03] necessary and we're going to get to it
[2:26:05] but then when i woke up this morning i
[2:26:06] started feeling like
[2:26:09] that there was something else and i
[2:26:10] started just meditating on the lord and
[2:26:12] he started talking to me and my wife
[2:26:14] said well what did you see what did you
[2:26:16] get what did you hear in the night
[2:26:18] what's what what was it and i said i
[2:26:20] can't talk about it right now because
[2:26:23] i'm already trying to pull some things
[2:26:24] together from this morning
[2:26:26] from for the to add to the message for
[2:26:29] this morning and this was that this
[2:26:30] whole section
[2:26:32] because if we are going after a
[2:26:35] total deliverance
[2:26:37] we should not expect it
[2:26:40] without a price
[2:26:42] it's going to cost us something
[2:26:45] it's going to cost us something god
[2:26:48] never did bless abraham until he
[2:26:50] separated himself and done what god told
[2:26:52] him to do
[2:26:53] and you'll never receive the holy ghost
[2:26:55] in the fullness
[2:26:57] you'll never walk in the spirit of god
[2:26:59] until you totally separate your things
[2:27:02] from unbelief get away from the world
[2:27:06] come out of the world
[2:27:09] i know you think i'm crazy but if i am
[2:27:12] just letting me alone
[2:27:14] he said i'm happy this way i'd rather be
[2:27:18] like this than the way i was see
[2:27:21] i looked at my sacrifice one time how
[2:27:24] many of you have ever seen your
[2:27:25] sacrifice thank god i've seen him
[2:27:28] and then separation the world wants
[2:27:31] mixers
[2:27:33] mixers
[2:27:34] ecumenical mixers
[2:27:37] everybody together just pull everybody
[2:27:40] together
[2:27:45] we had somebody here once
[2:27:48] nicest fella
[2:27:50] nicest fella
[2:27:52] some of you really
[2:27:54] enjoyed this company and his fellowship
[2:28:00] some people didn't understand when we
[2:28:02] put the pressure on
[2:28:04] from the pulpit
[2:28:06] while we begin to tell people you can't
[2:28:08] hang out in the
[2:28:10] vestibule if you come to church you need
[2:28:13] to come in here and see it
[2:28:14] you can't hang out there and mix with
[2:28:16] the little ones
[2:28:19] a lot of people didn't understand it
[2:28:21] because they hadn't been spending their
[2:28:23] nights
[2:28:24] on the floor
[2:28:25] seeking the lord
[2:28:28] and when he spoke to me i went to this
[2:28:30] man
[2:28:31] and i confronted him with what god said
[2:28:34] he never denied
[2:28:36] he never denied
[2:28:39] what was said he couldn't deny what was
[2:28:41] said there's no way in the world he
[2:28:42] could
[2:28:44] but he said then i'll just pull myself
[2:28:46] away
[2:28:47] because i don't want to be a danger
[2:28:51] that was a hard thing because my answer
[2:28:55] was
[2:28:56] we can cast this
[2:28:59] thing
[2:29:00] off
[2:29:05] a man lives alone
[2:29:09] has only his music his tv his computer
[2:29:15] it's just like sitting in sodom
[2:29:19] the filth and the smut
[2:29:22] and the vile
[2:29:26] grossness
[2:29:30] my wife said to me
[2:29:32] years later when the man took his life
[2:29:37] why didn't you tell the people
[2:29:40] what you saw and what you what you said
[2:29:43] and what transpired i said he wouldn't
[2:29:45] let me
[2:29:47] he wouldn't let me the lord wouldn't hit
[2:29:49] me i asked him multiple times
[2:29:54] prayer would be requested for the fellow
[2:29:56] and and and with the best of my ability
[2:29:59] i would pray
[2:30:03] a man like that left to his own devices
[2:30:05] you say well wouldn't that be better to
[2:30:07] for a man like that to come and hang out
[2:30:09] in a good atmosphere
[2:30:13] it would be
[2:30:15] if it wasn't for the vileness
[2:30:18] and the danger of the spirit that had
[2:30:20] taken hold
[2:30:27] i want you to understand
[2:30:30] that we all can have discerning of
[2:30:32] spirits
[2:30:34] but we are not all called to be watchmen
[2:30:36] on the wall
[2:30:39] when we have that call and there's more
[2:30:41] than one in this house
[2:30:43] and when we have that call we better do
[2:30:45] what god tells us to do whether it's
[2:30:47] understood or not
[2:30:49] one of these days you're going to
[2:30:50] understand a lot of things you don't
[2:30:52] understand now
[2:30:54] when that veil is lifted and you see
[2:30:56] what how close we have come to missing
[2:30:59] at times
[2:31:02] there's got to be something to take us
[2:31:04] all the way
[2:31:08] he even told us how it would come
[2:31:13] he even told us what it would look like
[2:31:19] how he would carry us
[2:31:21] to the top
[2:31:25] he told us once when we didn't have the
[2:31:27] strength to go he would provide the fire
[2:31:31] that we needed to be strengthened to go
[2:31:33] on
[2:31:35] he said when we were not able to go any
[2:31:37] higher when we couldn't do it by herself
[2:31:39] he would help us didn't he
[2:31:43] anybody with me
[2:31:45] he told us how he would help us
[2:31:47] he told us how an eagle would take us
[2:31:50] spiritually
[2:31:54] the prophet knew it
[2:31:56] he saw it coming
[2:31:58] he was in shreveport
[2:32:01] he saw things were coming to an end
[2:32:04] he's sharing his experience in sabino
[2:32:08] he knew that god was not going to
[2:32:10] forsake his people when he took his
[2:32:12] prophet
[2:32:13] he knew that the spirit of truth would
[2:32:16] remain in the bride
[2:32:19] he knew there would be something to
[2:32:21] catch us up above the mixers
[2:32:27] i got to close
[2:32:29] the world wants mixers oh when you elect
[2:32:32] your new pastor you say we want that
[2:32:34] little curly hair you know
[2:32:41] nothing wrong with curly hair
[2:32:44] but don't you notice sometimes how men
[2:32:46] with curly hair like to show it
[2:32:50] they like to kind of work down
[2:32:53] come on
[2:32:55] you know the prophet talked about these
[2:32:56] beatniks
[2:32:58] and his day
[2:32:59] and how they like to pull their bangs
[2:33:01] down
[2:33:02] on their forehead you know
[2:33:04] sometimes put them in spit curls
[2:33:06] remember
[2:33:07] big curl of hair
[2:33:09] there was a
[2:33:10] pentecostal preacher used to run through
[2:33:12] here
[2:33:13] uh you know you related to some folks
[2:33:16] you know
[2:33:18] he pulled his spit curl down there
[2:33:21] a big curl of hair right down on his
[2:33:25] my granny would say to me i love that
[2:33:27] man
[2:33:28] i love his singing
[2:33:30] i love his preaching but she said i
[2:33:32] cannot trust a man
[2:33:35] that pulls his bangs down in a spit curl
[2:33:38] on his forehead
[2:33:39] she said he thinks too much of himself
[2:33:45] and here brother random come along
[2:33:47] said about the same thing
[2:33:51] whew god didn't didn't decide to deliver
[2:33:54] the message by dobby gillis
[2:33:58] he wasn't looking for a beatnik
[2:34:01] he was looking for a redneck
[2:34:06] he went to kentucky
[2:34:10] he found somebody that had no pretense
[2:34:17] come on now
[2:34:18] wasn't trusting his education
[2:34:22] daddy a bootlegger
[2:34:25] running from the law
[2:34:28] moved every time the bills come due
[2:34:34] god knew what he was doing
[2:34:36] separation the world wants mixers oh
[2:34:38] when you elect your new pastor you say
[2:34:40] we want that little curly hair you know
[2:34:42] and little hollywood perfumed up sort of
[2:34:44] something
[2:34:45] get up on the pulpit and say amen real
[2:34:48] nice you know
[2:34:50] and we'll permit you to look at
[2:34:51] television all night wednesday night too
[2:34:55] let you out early
[2:34:59] oh that i hope that doesn't have around
[2:35:00] here
[2:35:02] don't usually ever let you out early
[2:35:08] but did not the world has not the world
[2:35:10] gone this way
[2:35:12] remember this was in 1959
[2:35:15] los angeles california
[2:35:17] that was before denominational churches
[2:35:19] shut down for super bowl sunday
[2:35:26] or or they have super bowl parties at
[2:35:27] church
[2:35:30] i i sometimes see these announcements on
[2:35:32] facebook in different places for sermon
[2:35:34] series now i love sermon series
[2:35:38] i love getting on something staying on
[2:35:39] it a while
[2:35:40] i love that
[2:35:42] but i think there ought to be something
[2:35:44] more than than than six weeks with andy
[2:35:46] griffith
[2:35:48] i saw it recently
[2:35:53] recently
[2:35:54] i saw it six weeks with andy griffith
[2:35:58] well i had to look that up to see what
[2:35:59] it was and it's clips
[2:36:03] that they play to introduce the message
[2:36:06] for that night
[2:36:07] by teaching the wholesome principles
[2:36:10] of sheriff andy griffith
[2:36:14] they didn't have such thoughts as that
[2:36:16] in 59
[2:36:18] when brother van was talking about
[2:36:19] churches calling themselves off letting
[2:36:22] out early so the people could go home
[2:36:24] and watch the television but they do it
[2:36:26] now
[2:36:28] let you out early so we can get some of
[2:36:30] the television programs you ought not to
[2:36:31] see
[2:36:32] won't say nothing when you're reading
[2:36:34] old true story magazines and filth
[2:36:40] come on you grisham fans and some of you
[2:36:42] folks
[2:36:48] stephen king fans
[2:36:51] in the holy ghost field church
[2:36:56] don't say nothing when you read no true
[2:36:58] story magazine and filth out on the
[2:37:00] street go into your office and pin-ups
[2:37:02] hanging around well he's a good fellow
[2:37:05] anyhow because he pays good
[2:37:07] god wants you to separate
[2:37:10] that's what's the matter with the church
[2:37:12] go into the church and have a little
[2:37:13] flowery sermon about some politician
[2:37:15] that's up to run and i hope you all vote
[2:37:17] for him and afraid if he says anything
[2:37:19] the deacons will throw him out
[2:37:22] how many of you know you can't have a
[2:37:23] pastor if he's afraid of the deacons
[2:37:26] throwing him out
[2:37:30] i tried that 17 years old answered to a
[2:37:34] deacon board at an assembly of god
[2:37:36] church and i got called on the carpet
[2:37:38] every time i turned around
[2:37:42] i had oh dear brother luke who's gone on
[2:37:44] to be with the lord come and preach and
[2:37:46] he had license with the congregational
[2:37:48] holiness and not with the assembly of
[2:37:49] god so the deacons called me in the
[2:37:51] office on that
[2:37:53] the same they forgot they forgot that
[2:37:56] when i came to take the church it was
[2:37:57] falling apart the pastor was suing them
[2:38:00] in court and the denomination wouldn't
[2:38:02] even stand by them
[2:38:06] they forgot
[2:38:07] and now they want to talk about me
[2:38:08] bringing in a pastor season more
[2:38:10] experience than i am
[2:38:14] because he didn't carry license with the
[2:38:16] denomination and then they wanted to
[2:38:18] call me in again how long is long
[2:38:24] how short is short
[2:38:27] i said are you serious
[2:38:29] you brethren are my elders have you
[2:38:32] really called me in here to help you
[2:38:34] define how long is long and how short is
[2:38:38] short a preacher can't obey god
[2:38:42] if he's afraid of the deacon board
[2:38:45] [Music]
[2:38:48] because i believe in pr let me tell you
[2:38:49] something
[2:38:50] the only real deacon that we ever had
[2:38:52] for any amount of time was brother benny
[2:38:54] west
[2:38:55] and he might have he might have
[2:38:56] corrected me from time to time when he
[2:38:58] felt like i needed it but i want you to
[2:39:00] know i never preached it too hard for
[2:39:02] him and if he thought it had been too
[2:39:04] long since i had preached it hard he
[2:39:06] would remind me
[2:39:12] he said i love all these new folks
[2:39:14] coming in here being a part and getting
[2:39:15] to hear the message and the truth i love
[2:39:17] it but he said don't forget
[2:39:20] every now and again
[2:39:22] i didn't resent that
[2:39:25] because i believe in preaching the
[2:39:26] gospel and listen how he ends this he
[2:39:28] said just throw the axe to the root of
[2:39:30] the tree god wants separators the church
[2:39:34] wants
[2:39:39] two more
[2:39:42] from that time paragraph 58 i know i got
[2:39:44] to hurry cause you're tired and i've got
[2:39:46] something i have to do at the end of
[2:39:47] this
[2:39:48] abraham was changed
[2:39:50] and look when a man meets god god called
[2:39:52] abraham and he told him he wanted him to
[2:39:54] separate himself from all of his
[2:39:56] unbelieving kindred
[2:39:58] and when god calls a man to work for him
[2:40:00] he calls you from total annihilation
[2:40:02] from all the things of the world and the
[2:40:03] sins of the earth separation
[2:40:06] god never did bless abraham until he
[2:40:08] fully obeyed him
[2:40:10] he took his father
[2:40:12] the old man was always a hair in his
[2:40:13] soup
[2:40:16] excuse that expression but he was always
[2:40:18] wrong
[2:40:20] he was he was an automaker
[2:40:22] and abraham and when he got lot then he
[2:40:25] finally went down there and after lot
[2:40:27] separated himself then god said to
[2:40:29] abraham rise and walk through the land
[2:40:31] i've give it all to you it's all yours
[2:40:33] see he never fully blessed him till
[2:40:35] abraham fully obeyed you're never going
[2:40:38] to have the blessing of the lord until
[2:40:40] we fully obey him this is all of us this
[2:40:43] is god talking to all of us there's
[2:40:45] nobody in this room that couldn't use a
[2:40:47] little more separating from unbelief
[2:40:51] don't you be a fanatic you just be
[2:40:52] sincere before the lord and let god lead
[2:40:54] you he'll lead you
[2:40:56] and you'll never be able and get your
[2:40:57] mouth over somebody else's mess you
[2:41:00] don't worry about what somebody else is
[2:41:01] doing you worry about you and your house
[2:41:05] you get your eyes off of somebody else
[2:41:07] let god deal with them
[2:41:10] amen
[2:41:11] a preacher will get them like he gets
[2:41:13] you
[2:41:13] and you'll never be able to get anything
[2:41:15] from god and have favor with god my
[2:41:17] brothers and sisters wherever you are
[2:41:18] until we fully obey the word of god
[2:41:21] you make yourself miserable by just
[2:41:23] half-heartedly approaching it how many
[2:41:26] of you have ever been in that place in
[2:41:28] your life were you are so miserable you
[2:41:29] can hardly stand it because you're just
[2:41:31] halfway doing it
[2:41:32] just halfway doing anybody getting this
[2:41:34] today
[2:41:35] the last one jehovah jiren number one
[2:41:37] back to that back to jehovah jair number
[2:41:39] one lewisville
[2:41:41] he said so we find those things go on
[2:41:44] and they finally come to the blossom
[2:41:45] here in the last days
[2:41:47] as jamers and janice
[2:41:49] withstood moses
[2:41:52] so will it be the same thing
[2:41:54] now total separation from all unbelief
[2:41:57] and remember abraham the patriarch was
[2:41:59] never absolutely fully blessed until he
[2:42:02] obeyed exactly what god said do and
[2:42:04] we'll never never never be blessed any
[2:42:06] and have the blessings until we obey
[2:42:09] what god said do
[2:42:13] is anybody with me
[2:42:15] now we need this
[2:42:17] we need it
[2:42:19] now i want you to
[2:42:20] to listen up
[2:42:26] you're going to wonder where in the
[2:42:27] world this is coming from
[2:42:32] this says catriel for anybody who
[2:42:35] wants to know that says catriel that's
[2:42:38] my hebrew name
[2:42:44] i had a dream last night
[2:42:47] and in my dream
[2:42:50] i revisited an experience
[2:42:53] that i had had with the lord
[2:42:55] in jerusalem
[2:42:58] and
[2:43:00] brother austin
[2:43:03] hodges come to say hello this morning
[2:43:08] i was
[2:43:09] so
[2:43:10] focused i could
[2:43:12] i greeted him and i finally even got up
[2:43:14] and hugged him and i said to him
[2:43:16] i'm having a brain freeze
[2:43:20] i can't find it i've been working with
[2:43:22] these things but i can't find it
[2:43:25] i just couldn't get the right title to
[2:43:27] to search it and to get it pulled up on
[2:43:29] the computer
[2:43:31] you have so many files and they've got
[2:43:33] so many names and so many dates and
[2:43:39] in the dream i was standing here just
[2:43:41] like this
[2:43:44] and i was reading
[2:43:47] an experience
[2:43:49] that i had in jerusalem i want to ask
[2:43:51] the musicians to come now
[2:43:54] and uh we're just shifting because this
[2:43:56] is
[2:43:58] you're going to wonder when i'm done how
[2:44:00] it connects
[2:44:02] but it only connects because the lord
[2:44:06] led it
[2:44:07] he connected it
[2:44:09] a few tuesday nights ago i came here and
[2:44:11] i told you that
[2:44:13] the the the word of the lord was guard
[2:44:16] your heart
[2:44:18] against
[2:44:19] any and all offense
[2:44:22] i heard brother greeley come and remind
[2:44:25] us
[2:44:26] of that word
[2:44:28] so many of the young people in their
[2:44:30] communication on their
[2:44:32] on the app that they use
[2:44:35] to communicate over the past few weeks
[2:44:38] many of them have signed on or signed
[2:44:41] off
[2:44:42] by saying i am unoffendable
[2:44:45] it's not a boast
[2:44:47] it's a cry of faith
[2:44:49] it says i gotta get there
[2:44:52] and he give me the scripture psalm 119
[2:44:55] 165 great peace have they which love thy
[2:44:58] law and nothing shall offend them that
[2:45:00] word offend means put a stumbling block
[2:45:02] in their path or make them to stumble
[2:45:06] and he said tell them to stay close to
[2:45:08] one another don't let anything or anyone
[2:45:10] come between you and the rest of the
[2:45:12] body
[2:45:12] stay close to one another don't let
[2:45:15] anything or anyone come between you and
[2:45:17] the rest of the body
[2:45:19] now that is important
[2:45:23] i don't know where you stand
[2:45:33] but i want to share this
[2:45:35] going to be a little bit raw for some
[2:45:39] because it's going to remind you of some
[2:45:41] difficult times but the truth is
[2:45:44] the grace of god
[2:45:48] the grace of god
[2:45:50] has brought us through
[2:45:52] we've come through we're still coming
[2:45:54] through but we've come through
[2:45:57] this is uh from a time
[2:46:00] my family had spent five and a half
[2:46:03] weeks
[2:46:04] in israel
[2:46:08] you feel like a citizen when you stay
[2:46:10] there that long
[2:46:12] i carried
[2:46:14] grocery store cards
[2:46:17] you you feel connected
[2:46:20] they know you
[2:46:22] when you go in the store they know you
[2:46:24] they call you by name
[2:46:26] they'll see you on the street they they
[2:46:29] laugh the locals of jerusalem laugh and
[2:46:31] they say it's a it's the biggest small
[2:46:33] town you'll ever live in
[2:46:37] i tell this sometime i was in a lonely
[2:46:39] little bit of a lonely place we were
[2:46:41] there the family was there my wife was
[2:46:44] expecting either olivia or mariah
[2:46:48] and
[2:46:49] we had
[2:46:50] barely landed and we had to get off
[2:46:53] because we were invited to
[2:46:56] a reception
[2:46:59] at the mayor the mayor was doing a
[2:47:01] reception at the tower of david the
[2:47:03] citadel just inside
[2:47:05] the jaffa gate of the old city
[2:47:07] and we had been invited specially
[2:47:09] invited to be there
[2:47:11] and it was some scene and that old dusty
[2:47:15] wind had blown in that red wind had
[2:47:19] blown in from the desert
[2:47:21] it come all the way from the
[2:47:22] subcontinent of africa all the way up to
[2:47:25] where we were and and uh unusual
[2:47:29] early rain came
[2:47:31] and when that early rain dropped down
[2:47:33] through that
[2:47:34] red mud i was dressed in white and black
[2:47:37] as the orthodox do
[2:47:39] and that red mud it put the biggest old
[2:47:42] mud splotches all over my shirt i said
[2:47:44] here i'm going to see the mayor like
[2:47:46] that i was just in a tither
[2:47:49] my wife was with sister nancy in the van
[2:47:52] and they were trying to find a place to
[2:47:54] park and we didn't know what in the
[2:47:55] world we would do
[2:47:56] because my wife was expecting and she
[2:47:58] was going to have to hike to get up
[2:48:00] there just a lot of things
[2:48:02] and i don't know but i'm standing in the
[2:48:04] in the main gate of the old city and i
[2:48:06] just feel lonely all of a sudden why am
[2:48:08] i here what am i doing here
[2:48:12] there's
[2:48:13] many places i should be
[2:48:16] why am i here
[2:48:18] and all of a sudden
[2:48:20] an orthodox jewish friend
[2:48:23] who runs the
[2:48:24] shoreshim
[2:48:26] gift shop
[2:48:28] near the herva synagogue in the old city
[2:48:31] the jewish quarter of jerusalem he saw
[2:48:33] me
[2:48:34] originally from toronto but had lived in
[2:48:37] israel for many many years two brothers
[2:48:39] moshe and dolph and i don't even
[2:48:41] remember which one of them it was now
[2:48:43] called out to me way across the street
[2:48:45] i'm just standing there just so lonely
[2:48:46] i'm trying to figure out which way will
[2:48:48] my wife and the family come from and
[2:48:50] just i just can't tell you the emotions
[2:48:52] that were going on why am i here
[2:48:54] and who cares about meeting the mayor
[2:48:56] you know all these things
[2:48:58] and i'm a muddy mess
[2:49:00] and he called to my to my name called my
[2:49:03] name across the street he said
[2:49:05] oh pastor shelley welcome home
[2:49:10] i just sobbed i just broke down and
[2:49:12] sobbed
[2:49:14] lord that's why i'm here
[2:49:16] i'm here because it's home
[2:49:20] jerusalem has that feeling
[2:49:23] we were
[2:49:25] getting ready to leave it was we were
[2:49:27] only supposed to be there for a few
[2:49:29] weeks we had extended our stay twice
[2:49:33] i think that was a time that my mother's
[2:49:35] birthday was coming up
[2:49:38] thanksgiving coming up and my mother
[2:49:40] loved thanksgiving
[2:49:42] and she
[2:49:44] was so disappointed when we thought that
[2:49:46] we wouldn't come home for thanksgiving
[2:49:48] that we sent her a ticket and told her
[2:49:50] to join us
[2:49:51] and she joined us in jerusalem for
[2:49:54] thanksgiving i think that was
[2:49:56] no no that wasn't the same time thanks
[2:49:58] honey for helping me that was not not
[2:50:00] the same time but anyway we had been
[2:50:01] there
[2:50:02] it was hanukkah time
[2:50:05] and uh
[2:50:07] five and a half weeks had passed
[2:50:12] i get a phone call
[2:50:14] just
[2:50:15] rocks my world
[2:50:19] without going into the detail of that
[2:50:21] call
[2:50:22] i'm informed of something that i had no
[2:50:24] idea
[2:50:26] did not know did not understand
[2:50:29] what was going on
[2:50:35] and
[2:50:37] the message was basically you're going
[2:50:39] to lose the apartment
[2:50:40] i hear we have just enjoyed it for five
[2:50:43] and a half weeks
[2:50:46] you're gonna lose it
[2:50:48] something has to be done
[2:50:50] and i said to the owner let me get home
[2:50:54] and sort out this situation
[2:50:58] but i hung up the phone and i was gutted
[2:51:02] panicked
[2:51:05] i had never felt more connected to
[2:51:08] jerusalem than i was feeling in that
[2:51:10] moment
[2:51:12] and now to think that we might not even
[2:51:14] have a place
[2:51:16] to go
[2:51:17] just
[2:51:19] it was emotional
[2:51:24] i was
[2:51:25] perplexed didn't understand
[2:51:29] shaken
[2:51:30] my faith shaken
[2:51:33] and we went to bed that night
[2:51:35] i think we were leaving the next day or
[2:51:38] the day after very shortly we were
[2:51:40] leaving to come home
[2:51:44] december of 2011 i've only been once
[2:51:47] since then
[2:51:51] i'm reading this now in the pulpit the
[2:51:53] last the the new year's meeting of 2011.
[2:51:58] i'm reading now the last night that we
[2:52:00] were in jerusalem i walk in the night
[2:52:03] to a light that was moving gently around
[2:52:06] the bedroom
[2:52:08] now there's something about my bedroom i
[2:52:09] don't know if benny's still watching but
[2:52:11] if you are
[2:52:12] there's something special about that
[2:52:14] bedroom
[2:52:16] had many many experiences there
[2:52:21] my first thought as that light just
[2:52:23] began to move around the room my wife
[2:52:25] laying there
[2:52:26] my first thought is that it was a
[2:52:28] flashlight beam
[2:52:32] however
[2:52:34] rather suddenly i was made aware of his
[2:52:36] presence
[2:52:38] filling the room
[2:52:40] for some reason i could not hold back
[2:52:42] the tears i just started crying
[2:52:46] the light that i was watching move
[2:52:48] around the room the light eventually
[2:52:50] settled on my side of the bed
[2:52:53] and then lengthened into a man
[2:52:57] any of you how many of you've ever seen
[2:52:59] that bedroom you've been inside it
[2:53:00] you've seen it quite a few of you
[2:53:04] at home i
[2:53:06] sleep on the other side of the bed but
[2:53:07] in jerusalem i sleep on the window side
[2:53:10] of the bed and that light came
[2:53:12] around there and lengthened into the
[2:53:14] form of a man standing on my side of the
[2:53:16] bed between me and the window i can look
[2:53:19] out that window on a clear day and see
[2:53:21] the judean wilderness
[2:53:24] in fact
[2:53:27] once i've seen a portion of the dead sea
[2:53:33] he was standing there so close to me i
[2:53:35] was able to make out features
[2:53:38] and this was something that had not
[2:53:40] happened to me before any time the angel
[2:53:42] of the lord or the lord himself had
[2:53:45] appeared
[2:53:46] in a experience a dream or vision or
[2:53:49] experience he had always been under such
[2:53:52] a fog a mist
[2:53:54] that i could never really make out
[2:53:55] features but i saw this time facial
[2:53:58] features
[2:54:00] and it shocked me
[2:54:02] shook me
[2:54:04] he was standing so close to me i was
[2:54:06] able to make out his features and
[2:54:09] this was so odd to me and oddly enough
[2:54:13] he was wearing my tallit
[2:54:17] now that's why i have this own i have
[2:54:20] more than one
[2:54:22] but this is one that if you'll just play
[2:54:25] anything softly
[2:54:26] this is one that i had just had made
[2:54:30] i don't know why at the time i didn't
[2:54:32] know why but we are wandering as a
[2:54:35] family in the old city
[2:54:38] and we come to a new place i've never
[2:54:40] seen it open before
[2:54:42] and there was a little orthodox jewish
[2:54:44] young man in there who was weaving on an
[2:54:47] old
[2:54:48] loom
[2:54:50] and i stepped in the door and i said
[2:54:52] hello there
[2:54:54] what are you doing and he said i'm
[2:54:55] weaving hand woven tallits
[2:54:59] and i said well i'd sure like to look at
[2:55:01] some
[2:55:03] and
[2:55:04] in that moment i knew i wanted it i
[2:55:07] wanted one
[2:55:08] now that was something i fought often in
[2:55:10] jerusalem
[2:55:14] there were lots of things i wanted
[2:55:17] we were spent out
[2:55:20] after all that time on mostly our own
[2:55:22] finances we were spent out
[2:55:26] and
[2:55:31] i said do you take
[2:55:32] cards because i
[2:55:34] would like to have one he said oh yes
[2:55:37] you'd look around and you'd think that
[2:55:39] they wouldn't have no set up for that
[2:55:40] but they do
[2:55:42] he said you pick out the colors
[2:55:44] and what you want and i will weave it
[2:55:46] i'll make it you can come back and watch
[2:55:48] me do some of it
[2:55:51] and he said i'll even put the bag and he
[2:55:53] said you give me your hebrew name and
[2:55:55] i'll put it on the
[2:55:59] on the bag
[2:56:00] so it was very special to me
[2:56:03] now i just picked it up and i had it
[2:56:05] laying in the cabinet
[2:56:07] closed the cabinet of the bedroom and
[2:56:10] here stands
[2:56:14] with my talit on
[2:56:17] it it
[2:56:18] just really shook me
[2:56:24] here's the lord standing
[2:56:26] with my prayer shawl on
[2:56:28] the one i just purchased in the old city
[2:56:31] he looked deeply into my eyes
[2:56:34] and asked me a heart-wrenching question
[2:56:38] here's what he asked he said do
[2:56:42] you
[2:56:42] trust
[2:56:44] me
[2:56:49] do
[2:56:50] you
[2:56:51] trust
[2:56:53] me
[2:56:55] what a question
[2:56:58] i couldn't imagine
[2:57:03] being asked such a question
[2:57:07] i said my lord
[2:57:10] you know that i trust you with all my
[2:57:13] heart
[2:57:15] and he smiled at me
[2:57:19] and he said can you trust me with all
[2:57:23] the details
[2:57:25] of your life
[2:57:26] and ministry
[2:57:29] you see only the lord knew
[2:57:34] what was ahead
[2:57:37] will you can you trust me
[2:57:40] with all the details of your life and
[2:57:42] ministry i could tell by the way he
[2:57:44] asked the question
[2:57:46] that he saw something in me
[2:57:50] that did not trust him fully
[2:57:54] even though i said to him
[2:57:57] i trust you with my full heart
[2:58:03] his look
[2:58:05] convicted me
[2:58:07] i felt like i had lied to the lord
[2:58:14] so i answered again
[2:58:16] without being asked again
[2:58:19] and i said i will do my very best
[2:58:23] to trust you in all
[2:58:26] things
[2:58:28] and i emphasize the word all because i
[2:58:31] knew there must be something in my life
[2:58:33] or ministry that i had either not
[2:58:35] trusted him with or would not trust him
[2:58:38] with when i should face it
[2:58:41] and the tears were streaming again and i
[2:58:44] remember weeping
[2:58:49] the lump growing in my throat
[2:58:52] my physical reaction was to melt
[2:58:57] and i slowly got out these words lord
[2:59:02] i am so concerned i'm so worried
[2:59:06] that you will not be able to completely
[2:59:09] trust me
[2:59:14] it's easier
[2:59:16] to trust the lord
[2:59:19] that when you look at yourself and you
[2:59:21] realize in his face
[2:59:24] there's something in you that you're not
[2:59:26] trusting him with
[2:59:34] must have been something small
[2:59:36] some problem some situation
[2:59:40] that i had not trusted or would not
[2:59:43] find easy to trust the lord
[2:59:46] and i said lord i'm the problem
[2:59:50] i am the problem
[2:59:54] and surely it will be easier for me to
[2:59:57] trust you
[2:59:59] than for you to trust me
[3:00:03] i'm so concerned
[3:00:07] and he smiled again gently and said
[3:00:11] oh
[3:00:13] but i do trust you
[3:00:17] there's nothing sweeter
[3:00:20] there's nothing more amazing
[3:00:23] oh
[3:00:25] but i do trust you
[3:00:28] and i've come to tell you
[3:00:34] that it's time
[3:00:37] to gather
[3:00:39] and guard
[3:00:43] gather and guard
[3:00:46] it's really where we've been
[3:00:51] for
[3:00:53] many years now
[3:00:54] gather guard
[3:00:57] sometimes we get a little slack
[3:00:59] gathering
[3:01:01] sometimes we may have got a little slack
[3:01:03] guarding
[3:01:04] but the commission of this house
[3:01:07] is to gather and guard
[3:01:10] that's what jesus said
[3:01:12] i know there'll be some who see this who
[3:01:14] i can't believe you'd get up and i can't
[3:01:16] i can't help it
[3:01:20] it just
[3:01:21] is the truth
[3:01:24] it's my truth it's what happened to me
[3:01:28] it's time to gather and guard
[3:01:31] he said just fully depend
[3:01:35] on me
[3:01:35] [Music]
[3:01:37] he said and i will lead your every step
[3:01:41] walk in repentance
[3:01:43] and humility
[3:01:45] and i will vindicate the truth that you
[3:01:47] have preached
[3:01:49] that's a pretty powerful word
[3:01:53] and i was later told then in this
[3:01:55] conversation that we could not go
[3:01:57] forward
[3:01:58] until we as leaders
[3:02:01] could lead the body
[3:02:03] into a place of repentance
[3:02:06] and when we returned home from jerusalem
[3:02:09] that was the message that was shared
[3:02:12] it was at a new year's meeting and paul
[3:02:15] keith was here
[3:02:17] and he referred to this
[3:02:21] i had already shared it with the body
[3:02:24] but he referred to it again
[3:02:28] because he had a chapter in his book
[3:02:31] called gather in guard
[3:02:33] and you know the funny fella he was
[3:02:37] he didn't have the best sense of humor
[3:02:40] but when he did it was pretty funny
[3:02:43] and he said i just got the best
[3:02:45] endorsement for my book i've ever got
[3:02:48] he said because the lord jesus spoke to
[3:02:50] brother shelly and gave him the name of
[3:02:52] a chapter of my book
[3:02:55] gather
[3:02:56] and guard
[3:02:58] it's a message that is so appropriate
[3:03:02] for the hour we're living in right now
[3:03:05] god's word calls
[3:03:07] for a total separation of unbelief
[3:03:11] and that is required for total
[3:03:14] deliverance
[3:03:15] and here we are as a body
[3:03:18] doing our best to trust the lord
[3:03:22] more concerned about whether or not he
[3:03:24] can trust us
[3:03:27] knowing that he can because he put
[3:03:29] himself in us
[3:03:31] he's seen the end from the beginning
[3:03:34] if he has confidence in us we can make
[3:03:37] it all the way how many of you believe
[3:03:39] that
[3:03:41] you may not trust yourself but i want
[3:03:43] you to know the one who knows you the
[3:03:45] most
[3:03:47] loves you the most
[3:03:49] has put his confidence in you
[3:03:51] he's put his trust in you
[3:03:53] that if you hold on to him
[3:03:56] you'll make it all the way
[3:03:58] [Music]
[3:03:59] that means committing everything
[3:04:03] into his hands
[3:04:05] he went on to speak to us about the
[3:04:07] spirit of truth
[3:04:09] the spirit of truth cannot testify of
[3:04:12] himself he can only speak what he hears
[3:04:14] spoken
[3:04:17] and he referred us to the spirit of
[3:04:20] prophecy and revelation where it talks
[3:04:22] about the testimony of jesus christ
[3:04:25] being the spirit of prophecy
[3:04:28] i want you to know we serve a
[3:04:29] supernatural god
[3:04:31] we're on a supernatural journey
[3:04:34] the bride is a supernatural people
[3:04:37] we can make this separation
[3:04:40] we can make this separation we can deal
[3:04:42] with unbelief
[3:04:44] and on that daily basis when we feel
[3:04:46] things creeping up to taint us
[3:04:49] to worry us beyond
[3:04:51] a normal parameter and start weighing on
[3:04:54] our mind
[3:04:56] we can pull that thing down
[3:04:58] we can say lord i believe help thou
[3:05:01] my unbelief
[3:05:03] it doesn't mean that there won't be a
[3:05:04] thought it doesn't mean
[3:05:06] that there won't be a pull
[3:05:09] what it means is you will be able to
[3:05:11] overcome
[3:05:14] because your trust is in the lord
[3:05:17] and he has put his trust in you
[3:05:20] let's stand
[3:05:22] now why the lord wanted it done that way
[3:05:24] and
[3:05:25] i thought i don't know if i'll have the
[3:05:27] courage to read that this morning
[3:05:30] i found it after austin left me there i
[3:05:33] i i was putting in all kinds of things
[3:05:36] none of them the right word
[3:05:39] i was standing here in worship and
[3:05:42] and i caught a glimpse of my dream again
[3:05:47] [Music]
[3:05:50] and i saw myself standing here
[3:05:54] with this on
[3:05:57] and i slipped over to my reading it and
[3:05:59] i stepped over to my wife and i said
[3:06:01] can you put your hands on that
[3:06:04] and she knew where it was and joshua ran
[3:06:06] right after worship to get it i don't
[3:06:08] know why i don't know why
[3:06:12] but i know this i know there are certain
[3:06:15] times in situations where things can't
[3:06:18] happen the way they're supposed to
[3:06:19] happen until everybody gets in the right
[3:06:20] place
[3:06:23] you come sit here no you sit there
[3:06:27] i just want to i
[3:06:28] if i never know the reason why
[3:06:31] i want to know that i've got enough
[3:06:32] trust
[3:06:34] to believe what he said
[3:06:36] and to do it how many of you feel that
[3:06:38] way
[3:06:39] oh i wouldn't take nothing
[3:06:40] i mean that's a good thing in the south
[3:06:44] when you say i wouldn't take nothing for
[3:06:45] that's good
[3:06:47] you say that anywhere else it sounds
[3:06:48] like it's not worth much
[3:06:50] but when we say that in the south it
[3:06:51] means it's more valuable than anything i
[3:06:54] wouldn't exchange it for anything in the
[3:06:56] world
[3:06:57] the peace that i feel right now
[3:06:59] because i know he's here

[3:12:16] over
[3:12:18] [Music]
[3:12:22] yes just play that a minute
[3:12:24] when sister annie came to talk to me
[3:12:26] earlier today
[3:12:28] she was talking to me about
[3:12:32] coming in contact with students that
[3:12:37] she was involved with
[3:12:39] in health care
[3:12:41] now she's working in the schools
[3:12:45] and some of these students recognizing
[3:12:47] her
[3:12:49] and the thought that was in her mind at
[3:12:51] that moment
[3:12:53] was this therapy
[3:12:56] that they do
[3:12:58] skin to skin how many of you know what
[3:13:00] i'm talking about
[3:13:02] they take that baby and lay it up on the
[3:13:04] bare skin of his mother's chest
[3:13:08] and even now more than than than long
[3:13:11] time ago even now more than then they
[3:13:13] tell the daddy
[3:13:15] take your shirt off
[3:13:17] and hold that baby up
[3:13:19] to your skin we did it with ours even i
[3:13:22] did it with with ours
[3:13:26] there's something that takes place
[3:13:30] in that little baby
[3:13:32] it's a connection
[3:13:34] that's powerful
[3:13:36] powerful
[3:13:39] and
[3:13:41] i took that
[3:13:43] as a confirmation
[3:13:45] of what the lord had dealt with me about
[3:13:47] that morning
[3:13:48] about little children picking up things
[3:13:51] and how easy it is
[3:13:53] for something to be on them like that
[3:13:55] and then we have to spiritually draw
[3:13:56] them
[3:13:57] like the natural mother like the natural
[3:13:59] dad does it in the natural take that
[3:14:02] baby up and pull them up
[3:14:04] spiritually up under us and nourish them
[3:14:06] and connect with them again
[3:14:09] brush them off
[3:14:13] brush them off brush the world off brush
[3:14:15] brush these old bad things that get on
[3:14:17] them brush them off
[3:14:19] and say oh no oh no
[3:14:22] this one is mine there's healing and
[3:14:24] nourishment that come pray over them
[3:14:27] don't just pray on your bed for them in
[3:14:29] their bed
[3:14:30] pray over them
[3:14:32] lay your hands on them and say clean
[3:14:35] them lord
[3:14:37] separate them from any spirit that would
[3:14:40] touch their body
[3:14:42] trouble their mind
[3:14:44] change their behavior
[3:14:46] cause them to struggle
[3:14:50] socially parent desires for their
[3:14:54] children to be able to interact
[3:14:57] with other children
[3:15:00] it's so
[3:15:01] vitally important in life
[3:15:04] that your children are able to have
[3:15:07] interaction with other good godly
[3:15:09] children
[3:15:11] because
[3:15:12] they're growing up and
[3:15:15] we don't want to stunt them we want to
[3:15:17] promote them and bless them and help
[3:15:19] them
[3:15:21] and these are some of the ways that we
[3:15:23] can do it by praying over them i'm
[3:15:25] telling you
[3:15:27] i watched my children at times catch
[3:15:30] spirits off of airplanes
[3:15:32] when we traveled
[3:15:34] i've seen it in hotel rooms
[3:15:37] where they would catch a spirit
[3:15:40] and it would trouble them
[3:15:42] it would change them a little bit and
[3:15:44] sometime it would go on weeks
[3:15:46] before we realized the root of what was
[3:15:48] going on and what had happened what had
[3:15:50] taken place
[3:15:52] and children are more sensitive
[3:15:55] even little babies more sensitive to
[3:15:57] things
[3:15:58] so i i just felt like now she you want
[3:16:01] to talk to her after you can and
[3:16:03] and she might have another take but
[3:16:06] it's so it can really encourage my heart
[3:16:09] i think spiritually this is the hour
[3:16:11] to pull them up
[3:16:13] again
[3:16:15] to guard
[3:16:17] and protect
[3:16:19] to gather
[3:16:21] and guard
[3:16:22] and it may not make you a popular mama
[3:16:26] or a popular daddy
[3:16:28] but i tell you this is not a popularity
[3:16:30] contest
[3:16:31] this is for their soul
[3:16:33] this is for their soul
[3:16:35] and we hear things like children just
[3:16:37] don't understand you know why they don't
[3:16:40] because sometimes we don't
[3:16:43] sometimes we don't understand either
[3:16:45] sometimes we can't tell them because we
[3:16:47] don't understand it either
[3:16:50] but i tell you what we do know we know
[3:16:52] that we have committed it into the hands
[3:16:53] of somebody that we can trust
[3:16:55] he's going to take care of this i feel
[3:16:58] his presence just now
[3:17:00] lord we just pray
[3:17:02] put your hand on your children around
[3:17:04] your little church children around you
[3:17:06] just lay your hand on them right now
[3:17:09] lord we just ask say go out into the
[3:17:11] world and
[3:17:13] they're in school and
[3:17:15] some of them even in in little private
[3:17:17] school situations and whatever
[3:17:19] and we know lord that the enemy would
[3:17:23] surely like
[3:17:25] to put something on them and even
[3:17:28] afflict their bodies
[3:17:30] change their behavior a little bit
[3:17:33] it might be a little cartoon they're
[3:17:35] watching
[3:17:37] might be a little toy they're playing
[3:17:38] with
[3:17:40] it might be some interaction that mom
[3:17:42] and daddy are having with one another or
[3:17:44] with someone else
[3:17:45] but we just thank you for the redeeming
[3:17:47] power of the blood of jesus christ
[3:17:50] i mean put your hand on your grown
[3:17:52] children if you want to
[3:17:54] hey
[3:17:56] lord you've given us these babies
[3:18:00] we're watching them grow up
[3:18:03] we want them guarded and protected as
[3:18:07] much as we possibly can
[3:18:09] we don't want them growing up paranoid
[3:18:11] or afraid of life
[3:18:14] but we want them to know that there's a
[3:18:16] covering
[3:18:18] there's a covering for them
[3:18:20] there's protection for them
[3:18:23] by the precious blood of jesus christ
[3:18:26] now i want you to pray for yourself
[3:18:29] we're going to worship a little bit more
[3:18:31] and i want you to ask the lord for his
[3:18:33] grace
[3:18:34] to help you get to that place
[3:18:36] of total separation from unbelief where
[3:18:40] you are willing to pull yourself into
[3:18:43] his presence
[3:18:44] often more often than before
[3:18:47] pulling yourself out
[3:18:49] of situations
[3:18:52] that
[3:18:53] cause your heart to doubt
[3:18:55] that cause your mind to doubt
[3:18:58] you're pulling into him let's pull into
[3:19:00] christ
[3:19:02] and let's pursue a total deliverance how
[3:19:04] many of you will help me pursue
[3:19:06] i said to brother greeley in my office i
[3:19:08] don't have a total deliverance
[3:19:10] but i know it's mine
[3:19:13] i know it's mine
[3:19:15] i know the promise is there and i'm not
[3:19:18] asking god to look over my weakness i'm
[3:19:21] not asking god to look over my stuff i'm
[3:19:23] asking him to deliver me
[3:19:26] to deliver me
[3:19:28] from the root of it
[3:19:30] and i ask you i encourage you right now
[3:19:32] let's just pray for ourselves
[3:19:34] hallelujah lord here we are
[3:19:38] you gave us a word and
[3:19:40] we're going to have to process it and
[3:19:42] see what to do with it all
[3:19:46] but more than anything else
[3:19:49] we want that deliverance that's promised
[3:19:52] and we realize that there's
[3:19:55] only so much we can do
[3:19:58] to align ourselves
[3:20:01] to get ready to receive the help
[3:20:04] and one of those things is to cut off
[3:20:07] the sources of unbelief
[3:20:10] in our life
