presence I mean he's here let's see what he will do I want got several things on my heart before we look to the word I'm going to need the words to he'll do it again I don't see it here in the book I'm not going to sing it just now but I will in a minute um several things we want to mention today is May the 7th and brother Branham tells us in the message that he was commissioned by an Angel of the Lord on May the 7th the year is a little uncertain he mentioned several different years and he says I think but uh it was somewhere around 1946 May the fourth of May the 7th of 1946 you can find that in the prayer line in 1953 and you can find that in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel in 61. and in 60 he says I think it was around 14 15 years ago in 1937 now that was in 1960 when he said it how many of you know that uh 15 years from 1960 was not 37 so you know it's just good for me to know that God uses humans I get told all the time that I say it wrong or that I that I forget or I call somebody by the wrong name just be glad I'm calling you if you love me you better answer to anything I call you because I may come there's no telling who you might be but I do pretty good I'm thankful for songs I I sing all week long and I I get amazed at how I can remember the words till I get here have you ever had that happen to you but anyway it's a special day uh there there are some unclear things those of you who have studied the message of the hour for many years like we have uh brother Branham sometimes describes it as being in the cabin and other times he describes it as being in the cave and uh there is thought that he might have used the word cabin to throw people off because he did have a hidden cave that he uh met with the Lord in in Green's Mill Indiana and uh there were many people who believed that that should always remain a secret but my good friend brother George Smith was not one of those people he thought that everybody ought to know know it and have a chance to see it so he went and videoed it how many of you have ever seen that video let me see your hand this happened many years ago it's very interesting this cave there was a pyramid-shaped rock that comes down out of the ceiling and there's quite a table there where brother Branham said sometime he laid on that like a bed and God met with him many times he he describes though a light bulb in one of the tellings so it's possible that it took place in the cave I would like to read this I know it's not as interesting to some of you but I'm afraid that if Jesus tarries there will be fewer and fewer people who talk about these outstanding historical things that have taken place in our day so I'd like to read this to you in a paragraph one I don't have they don't have it uh from that message prayer line it took place in West Palm Beach Florida he said thank you good evening friends and you may be seated if you will about seven years ago on May the 7th 1946 Greens Mill Indiana there was an angel came into the room where I was at a man walking he didn't have wings he was just a big man had a white garment down to the feet and he said to me that I was born to pray for sick people and I told him I was uneducated illiterate and I wasn't able to go he said that I would be praying for kings and monarchs sometimes brother Branham used the word potentates uh here I am uh uh uh and a message around the world a message that would bring the second coming of Christ it was near and I told him I couldn't do it and he told me then for me to put my hands on the people and it would be told me what was wrong he said then if you'll be sincere it'll come to pass that you'll even know the secrets of the Heart by this they will believe and I said well that's what I was praying about I didn't understand it remember he was questioning his Pastor concerning this gift and many told him it was of the devil can you imagine many told him said that's of the devil you better not do things like that brother Roy Moore was his pastor and it was a Baptist Church but it had had a lot of Pentecostal flavor in it when you when you think Baptists don't think southern baptist it was never a Southern Baptist Church it was always livelier than that but they didn't understand these gifts and brother Branham didn't understand them and who was he going to talk to about it and so he'd been asking questions about it here stood the angel of the Lord to confirm to him that his ministry was certainly to be used he goes on well that's what I've been praying about I didn't understand it and he referred me the angel of the Lord referred for the Branham to the scriptures about Jesus knowing Philip what he did before he come and got in the prayer line Jesus told him you're a Believer I said how do you know I was a Believer a man in whom there is no Gaul remember he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you he said you're the son of God brother random said you believe he sent me to do that you do you do with all your heart then I'll be able to help you he's about to have a prayer line I'll be able to help you if you'll he told me if you'll get the people to believe you and then be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer that's a powerful promise of that promise as the bride of Christ wasn't just two brother Branham that was part of his commission but it's also for you you can have what you ask how do you know that because Jesus said so how many of you believe what Jesus said and he's asking the people you believe that with all your heart now look this way he said there he here here he is you who seen the picture we when we meet at the day of judgment that angel isn't standing two foot from where I'm standing right now that's right now in the name of Jesus Christ I take jurisdiction over every spirit in this room and may almighty God who raised up the son send back his Spirit into his Prophet to represent him may he see it may he see to it that it is manifested tonight I love the way that brother Branham put the responsibility on him it's up to him and many times he would say well we don't have to keep talking about it he is here he's just stepped in the building that's what you feel sometime when the presence of the Lord is moving you're feeling the convergence everybody look this way you're feeling the convergence of that Heavenly realm coming near to us and uh for the bride that membrane is very thin between this Dimension and the next and we should be expecting we should be expecting to encounter the supernatural amen we should expect angels to show up I'm not charismatic and I don't call and tell Angels what to do I know there are a lot of those especially women speakers and preachers out there that seem to have a special uh way about commanding angels but I don't see that in the word I don't see that it's our responsibility or authority to tell Angels what to do we just talk to him and he sends angels Lord I'm not why in the world would I go down to the try to find a middle man when I can go straight to the dispatcher the Holy Ghost is the dispatcher he just sends them I'm thankful I feel them I feel those angels I know they're here and there's more to the Heavenly Host than just angels there's four living creatures that that operate around the bride of Christ as well and uh things that we just hardly don't know anything about won't you be excited one day to encounter in that eternity all the different hosts of Heaven that God has created and to find out that they were with us to find out that sometime they were sitting on the hood of our automobile and we couldn't see them but they were sitting right on the roof of the car to protect us to keep us safe so many times we could have left here hello we could have left here well let me move on I don't want to bog down just yet uh today is a birthday of a very dear friend of mine a very faithful friend I don't know that he would be watching this service this morning but I I think that if he doesn't he may go back and see it again uh he has was watching Tuesday night but today is brother Wilson hembree's birthday I'm not going to tell how many because he looks a very strong for his age and I'm not going to pull that on him when he's not here to to make a joke because if he was here he'd make it funny but I want to say happy birthday to him today tomorrow is May the 8th I always remember May the 7th as the commissioning date of brother branham's Ministry and uh Paul Keith used to talk about the importance of remembering your commission when you were commissioned when God called you to do what you're doing right now and so I like to remember the commissioning date but also a lot to remember May the 8th the next day that's the day that God took brother Branham beyond the curtain of time and let him see what it's going to be like when we get there those beautiful saints of God come out to greet him our precious brother my my uh there were the Saints gathered with the messengers to the ages and I think that's just a wonderful thing to think about it has encouraged me many times and brother Branham said it encouraged him to press on when he saw that it encouraged him to keep pressing toward eternity and then on May the 10th what day is that is that Wednesday or Thursday on Wednesday is uh sister emiko's birthday so we want to say happy birthday all the way to Japan God bless you Sister emiko and happy birthday to you and we thank God for her faithfulness and it's also Sarah yantis's birthday so it's a day that we can remember her and lift her up to the Lord I like to use people's birthdays as a day I pray for people a lot but I like to specifically if I almost said it like brother Green in all the years I knew him I never heard him say specifically he always said pacifically he thought it had something to do with the Pacific Ocean I think he said pacifically but I like to use their birthday specifically as an opportunity to pray for them I want to tell you something Jesus Christ the same amen I want to tell you that Jesus Christ the saying yesterday and today

sometime to be in one mind in one Accord I want to say that I had an opportunity this week brother Austin to hear your message in Kentucky Arkansas it's coming in Arkansas it was brother Austin Hodges first sermon and he did a very very fine job very fine job I might say to you though brother while we're here you're going to get in trouble quoting me you better just stick with the prophet or quote Matthew Mark Luke and John but I'll tell you when you start saying my pastor Stephen Shelley said you're going to get in trouble in a hurry uh but I smiled a big smile I said he loves me he's proud of me he doesn't know that he's uh biting off his nose biting his face he doesn't know he's getting in trouble but anyway you did an outstanding job I'm not going to say what they said for your first time I'm going to say you did an outstanding job and I believe that the Lord was with you and I believe there's only one way up from I mean only one direction from here and that's up and uh you you just don't ever lose that that uh holy reverence that little bit of nervousness that you get when you know that you have the responsibility to speak to the elect lady what a privilege it is to address the elect lady the Bride of Jesus Christ the wife of the most high God it's a it's a powerful responsibility and I want to say also before we go to first Thessalonians chapter 4 15-17 I want to say also that the second podcast is getting a tremendous amount of traction it went live this week on on Tuesday I believe and uh it's already had uh four or five almost 500 views on YouTube and it's making its rounds on Facebook it is on the app you can find it under podcast it's on Spotify it's on Apple podcast if you have apple podcast on your phone you can subscribe and you can get a notification when a new one comes out I don't know where Joshua is going for number three but he'll be getting that together we'll try to release one a month and uh we already have so many so many messages and inboxes and emails and many people are are asking that he kindly allow me to be a guest from time to time and they somebody said that's here this morning said I see a part three coming right up the road there and uh so there must be some more to tell but you know God's using it in a profound way a young man reached out to me yesterday I haven't heard from him in 25 years and he reached out to say I was so blessed and uh had another another uh dear old friend reach out I might not have seen him in in 25 years and he said it was a blessing because I lived some of those early moments that you were telling about and I saw some of those things and so you know God's just using whatever we give him he'll use whatever we do for him it's not all easy there's work involved I appreciate Joshua I appreciate Hawk all the work that they that they do I appreciate you people for giving us the studio you gave it to us you gave to the Lord and the Lord provided that and we have a host of invitations now in the last month or so I have seven or eight on the list I don't know when we would ever go I like staying there was a time I like to go but now I like staying but I don't want to miss any of the of the appointments that the Lord has for me I'll tell you that right now I want to be where he would have me to be I I heard from an old friend this week sister Rogan Hill she reached out from Norway and she said I am overseeing a guest house in the Negev Desert of Israel and I would like to invite you and your wife to come and stay as our guest as my guest in this home for some days and enjoy the Negev part of Israel well I tell you that's right up my alley it's actually on the caboots where where uh Ben Gurion is buried the first one of the one of the first Prime Ministers not the first but one of the first let's thank God for these musicians praise God and I feel like you're in a hurry and that's not too good what did I call him sister what did I say more well sir for those thank you for for catching that Roy Davis was brother maybe it'd be better that they looked for Roy Moore uh but Roy Davis was the name of the pastor there of that of that Tabernacle where brother Branham was when he was asking those questions what is this that's happening to me thank you for for helping me stay right now you may be in a hurry I feel like taking my time so I don't know how we're going to get along today you feel like hurrying I feel like just relaxing just just really taking my time so I don't know how this is going to turn out I know one thing I'm not gonna drag you all the way you're going to have to work too you're gonna have to work too if you want us to go somewhere this will be very familiar to some of you but I feel like that late fall early winter of this year God is going to speak to us in some profound ways from his word help us to go a little deeper than what we have gone as a congregation and so he commissioned me then to to to go over some of these strong points that have been made in the last few years to get us ready for what we might it's good to have a foundation and for those of you who don't think that well you're just wrong it's very very good to have a foundation in the word in the message of the hour or you you may ask a question you may get more than you bargained for so let's get this Foundation right first Thessalonians chapter 4 God bless all the streamers for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself not another the Lord himself not an angel the Lord himself the angel of the Covenant if you want to say angel but the Lord himself shall descend that's come down from heaven with a Shout with the voice of the archangel and with the Trump of god let's read that again for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a child with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God that's the final Trump and the dead in Christ shall they shall rise first good thank you for helping me then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air we don't meet him on the Earth we meet him in the clouds because he doesn't come and touch the Earth in that moment he does come and touch the Earth his foot his feet will one day stand again on the Mount of Olives physically but that is the second coming this is the rapture resurrection that we're talking about today to meet the Lord in the air and oh my think about this last phrase and so shall we and so shall we with the Lord bow your head father you are so good to us we thank you for your faithfulness to us we thank you for what you did in this earth one generation ago we thank you for what you are doing today we thank you in advance for what you will do in the future because to us you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever Lord I need you today I need you to settle the the the issues at hand I need you to speak to us from your word Lord would you supply the ice have that is necessary to see Lord anoint the note takers that they might be able to take notes and never miss a Beat because it's most important their faith pool so anoint them in their recording Lord let there be no hindrance we come against every Spirit of Witchcraft in the name of Jesus Christ every rebellious Spirit bow you must bow to the authority of Jesus Christ Lord let your people receive what you have laid aside for them this day we ask this in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated is this too loud out there we are now closer to the reality of first Thessalonians chapter 4. the entirety of those verses than we have ever been before some of it is practically behind us we are walking in some of it now and some of it lies just ahead in the future is that right so close that a hand of Faith could reach out and put a finger on it it's that close to us in this hour and we have so much to be thankful for there was once a time that our church taught us that everything happened in the blink of an eye we just took that scripture right out of its context and believed what we were told and we just saw that in a blinking of an eye in the twinkling of an eye it'll all be done but the Apostle Paul remember he was chosen as a mouthpiece for the angel to the first church age to the Ephesian Church age so when we go to the Book of Revelation and we read about the seven churches that were in Asia Minor and we read that each one of them had an angel and that angel had a voice and that voice brought a message to that particular Church they were all contemporaries of one another but something much more prophetic and something much more profound was taking place in that hour because the word of the Lord was not just coming to a local assembly a local church where the local pastor and a local congregation but it was also a word from the Lord for ages to come is that right you can hear that in the revelation of Jesus Christ series if you're ever not sure about something you read in the church age book I suggest you go back to the revelation of Jesus Christ series and get your foundation there because to me if it's not there I I I I have to look at it two or three times and run it through the message before I can swallow it all because I smell quite a bit of Lee veil in the church age book and he was not an angel messenger it's all right you don't have to say anything Amen brother he was not chosen to speak for the angel of the Lord to laodicea a great great Theologian but not the voice of the angel so I I want to be able to take what I read there when I know others have helped to work it out grammarize it it's one thing to add commas and periods and and sputters and things take that out but it's another thing to interpret I don't want to be that person see you understand what I'm trying to say some of you do so get that revelation of Jesus Christ series out sometime and listen to it because it will really bless you uh each of these Church ages each of these churches of Asia Minor they also represented seven periods of time what we call the seven Church ages we are coming to the end and some of us have already transposed uh translated uh into that lap over of the bright age but we would call this church age for the church at large laodicea is that right Paul was not a messenger to laodicea brother Branham was not a messenger to Ephesus each message had a messenger to speak for the angel you see I see these angels as angels chosen even as the seven spirits even as the seven candles even as a seven lamps of Fire standing Before the Throne of the Lord and they had to have an Earthly voice somebody had to be the microphone or Hallelujah your pastor needs to be a microphone sometime your assistant pastor the ministers that you choose to listen to they have to be a microphone sometime to amplify what God would say to the church today I believe in the fifo ministry I want you to know that I believe there are apostles today not just missionaries that's not the biblical definition of an apostle you've got to take what brother random said about an apostle and then you've got to take what the scripture said an apostle was you've got to get it all in there it it yes an apostle is a Setter in order he said it's one who puts things in order and if we ever needed order we needed in this hour are you going to help me today I can tell you this is not to tantalize your flesh but it might help your spirit to grow if you're willing to stick it out if you don't want to hear that then go back and hear what the Lord said to us prophetically today it's time to get our heart pure and to get her hands clear clean before the Lord because one of these days we're going to see that book of Acts like never before operating Among Us that Supernatural power the same power that moved among the apostles it not only gave sight to the blind it not only gave Supernatural power to the ministers to shake off the serpents that bite them in the fire but it also put an ananias in the Sapphira on the ground so it's a serious hour that we're living in I'd be afraid to do what some people do live like they want to live all week and then you know trample right up to the throne and think you know get in on our coattails here and think that they can just go running right up without any consideration for the life you've lived all week I believe in justification I believe in the power of the blood I believe in being covered in his righteousness but when you fall short of the glory of God you've got to repent and you've got to be careful because fools will walk with hob-nailed shoes Where Angels Fear to trod I'd be afraid to carry on like some people carry I'd be afraid to come to the house of God and sit and Grumble and murmur and complain in my seat ah it it would behoove us not to be that kind of a people in the last days we should not be bound by the spirit of laodicea we should be translated into the authority of the bride's day for this is the bride's coming this is the bride coming of the Lord we've had a word coming now this is the bride coming and right around the corner is going to be the bridegroom coming in that wonderful so we we really want the Lord to just have his way I do in this hour I want him to have his way three phases of rapture let's get this in three phases of rapture not just a batting of an eye not just in a in a in a nanosecond they say but a process there is a culmination that will take place in the twinkling of an eye but there's a whole lot that takes place scripturally before the eye twinkles because first the Lord must ascend from heaven with a shout how about you give me Revelation 10 and verse 1. let's look at that you I didn't tell you to get it so this is a labor of love please grab it for us Revelation 10 1 if your Bible is Handy you look it up have it there and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and if you want to know who he is and a rainbow upon his hand this is not an ordinary angel this is not Gabriel come on this is not Michael Raphael or some of the other archangels as their call this is a different kind of Angel altogether he has come clothed with a cloud to identify how he will come in word form with a cloud and he has a rainbow upon his head he is identifying himself as the angel of the Covenant referred to in the Old Testament as the angel of the Lord and in this dispensation of Grace we understand he is the Lord Jesus Christ this is not brother Branham this is not some some angel with wings or something like that some other beautiful this is the Lord another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his head and his face as it were the son and his feet as pillars of Fire is there anybody in here don't raise your hand is there anybody in here that doubts that that was Jesus would you say it if you did if you're going to say it say it to me don't find some weak Church person and question me to them [Music] you come talk to me I'll tell you you don't have to believe me but but I'll tell you in Revelation chapter 1 he's identified like this and in the midst verse 13 you don't have this either and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot gird about the loins or the paps with a golden girdle next verse his head and his hairs were white like wool that's why that's snow he had come Church to represent himself as the faithful judge he came in a manner like Daniel saw him as the Ancient of Days anybody with me his hair white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire when we hear fiery eyes we think about anger flashing his fiery eyes I want you to know that's not the only way he comes and he certainly didn't appear to John as one who was about to consume him that fiery eye that he appeared with to John was the passion it was fiery passion in his eyes for his bride his eyes burn with indignation toward those who reject the word of the Lord but to those who receive him to them he gave power to be the sons of God and he is jealous for you I don't know if anybody's listening I'm going to preach to brother Greely and the streamers then I want you to know that he loves you he is after you he is passionately in love with you I see that the message churches out there are some of them are breaking into a wonderful place of Praise I'm so thankful to see people praising the Lord again I've been waiting on them to praise him because he's worthy you got to get in that praise stage before you can move on because the bride isn't just jumping she's not just dancing I'm on a dance I'm going to jump amen that's praise praise is what we do with what we have to catch the Lord's attention and to love on him and tell him who we are but our ultimate goal is to bring him in the midst we want him to step in here and when he does you won't dance then when he does you won't jump just jump then when he does you want to fall down on his on your face at his feet and you'll want to say Lord like oil upon your feet like wine for you to drink so we praise our way into the holy of holies when we come into the holy of holies the glory of his person the kavod the heavy weighty presence of God begins to move on us and when it does it almost paralyzes us biblically speaking it puts people on their face they can hardly move when I had an experience Before the Throne I remember how heavy my head was my head my neck my head felt like it weighed five tons when it came into my heart to look up I couldn't raise my head high enough to see anything but his feet because his kavod his heavy weighty glory and presence was there and in my in my unworthiness I didn't dare I hear people talk about experiences I used to hear it more than I do now because I spoke in different circles let's pray would you stand and let's pray for sister Royale she's not feeling well sister Weems we want to go to the Lord in prayer for her they're going to just go and see about checking her out I think let's go to the Lord in prayer for her she's already gone I think has already slipped out and and they're going to see about her let's just go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for the confirmation of your word that you are the same yesterday today and forever our hearts look to you in this moment and we know that you are ever more God the same we preach you as the same because we believe you are the same and so Lord right now reach down and touch our sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may it be that when they check her they find no reason that nothing has happened just some little fluke of the enemy to distract may it be that she's whole may it be that she is restored may it be that she is healed today for the glory of God we come against the works of the enemy we stand against the spirit of Darkness we come against the spirit of death in the name of Jesus we stand on the promise of your word and we declare her whole in the presence of God hold in the presence of God in the name of Jesus There's Something About This Moment that feels otherworldly thank you Jesus thank you Jesus let eternity break in on our midst [Music] foreign [Music] thank you Holy Ghost when we know not how to pray for even as we ought that holy spirit of God doth make intercession for us Jesus Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah isn't he good let's give God praise let's praise him for the good report yes Lord [Applause] you may be seated those fiery eyes as a flames of fire I was in a meeting in Nashville Tennessee I haven't wrote here in the margin of my Bible on August the 1st 2006. I was in Nashville I think that was the time that I had an experience with the with the doves I'm pretty sure that was the same time my eyes were open in the meeting while someone else was speaking I only remember that I was sitting next to Ricky Skaggs does anybody know who that is Ricky Skaggs was sitting right next to me and I saw two pillars of light come down on the platform they looked about as big as I could reach around one on one side and one on the other side and and I said Lord what is that and he said you are seeing my fiery eyes of passion for my bride I am in love with my people I tell you it moved me when I was I don't know where I was exactly but I'll just go on in verse 15. and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters you know brother Branham talked about that sound of many Waters Brothers skip you're going to be all right are you all right are you that cold you want us to get you another blanket get him another blanket somebody somebody get him you're all right good good I'm glad to hear it his feet sound of many Waters brother random talks about that voice being as the sound of many Waters he talks about it being the voice of the ministry all those faithful ministers that have declared the truth down Through the Ages their their part can be heard in his voice as it sounds like many Waters I wanted you to see his eyes I wanted you to see his feet were like brass as if they burned in a furnace and I wanted you to see his voice then I want you to go back to Revelation 10 for just a moment read that verse 1 again and see if you can identify that to be the same person and saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his head his face as if it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire I believe that's him if you believe that's him say amen I believe that's the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that he was descending John was letting him see first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven how is he descending the scripture said in a shout what is a shout a shout is a noise it's a voice it comes for a purpose it wakes things up you believe that this is the word coming of Christ this is Christ coming in a message Christ coming in the fullness of his word it's like a shout it wakes up a sleeping bride this is the Awakening of the Bride most of us didn't even know who we were until we heard a shout we just thought we were church members we just thought if we shook the preacher's hand and moved our letter from place to place we were a part of the church but then an eagle screamed then a shout came forth and a message sounded in our ears we realized that we might have been raised in a barnyard with chickens but we weren't chickens we were Eagles after all we weren't called to live in the lower elements of the Earth but to get up to a higher place did you hear the Lord calling us did you hear the Lord calling us to a higher place to ascend the hill of the Lord who'll hear what he has to say I will rearrange your life to get up where he is I will because everything looks different when you get up to where he is and you look back down on your problems what looked like a mountain now looks like a mole hill what looked like an impossibility looks like a great possibility when you get up to where he is the only thing you have to do is make sure you wash your hands and you give him your heart you can't cleanse your heart he can you just gotta give it to him you have to operate that realm in the realm of the soul and you have to say here's my will here's my mind here's my emotion you're not talking about the heart the blood pump he's talking about the seed of the emotions he said I want to cleanse that Lord here we are come on you don't know where you are do you here we are Lord this is that moment the Bible said he would do nothing nothing until he did something what is the something that he will do nothing until he does Amos 3 7 you got it Amos 3 7. surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveileth his secret unto his servants the prophets that sounds familiar to me let's go down just a little bit further in Revelation 10. that sounds familiar to me look at verse 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery I'm sorry Dr Schofield it's singular the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants plural the prophets plural Amos the Lord will do nothing but what he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the purpose of brother branham's Ministry was to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ if you're not fully persuaded of that you'll have a hard time eating some of the meals that I serve or that he serves through me somebody said do I have to believe that to come to this church you do not but don't be surprised if some of it just hangs on the vine because if you don't believe that you won't be able to completely see where we are in this hour so may God open your eyes if you haven't already seen that may you see it quickly his ministry was to forerun the second coming of Christ just like the ministry of John the Baptist was to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ and here's what's so powerful about these two men John the Baptist you know nobody has problem with me saying that about John the Baptist but here's the similarity between these two men they were both full of the spirit and power of Elijah neither of them were Elijah Elisha had a double portion of Elijah's Spirit but he wasn't Elijah John the Baptist had the same spirit and power that Elijah had but he wasn't Elijah brother Branham functioned in the same power and anointing of John the Baptist or of Elijah we can say but he was not Elijah now sometimes around the message you'll hear people say things like the Elijah for our day I have no problem with that be Elijah for our day if you mean by that that he was a man chosen of God to operate in the spirit and power of Elijah now somebody said why does that matter why do we have to speak about the ministry of brother Branham why do we even have to mention it when we come to church I'd rather us not have to even talk about it well look at acts this is skipping ahead forgive me this is Acts chapter 3 and verse 23 this is why come on you cheaters I'm waiting on you to read it to yourself first let me get a breath I didn't write this verse this is not my opinion and it shall come and where was it found in the book of the acts of the Holy Spirit this is in the book of The Acts of the Apostles like the church calls it it's the book of the acts of the holy spirit in the lives of the Apostles and this Acts chapter 3 is a powerful chapter anyway and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people now just reading that I know there's a context there some of your head you can certainly read the whole chapter when you get home we're not putting it up I'm having a hard enough time keeping you with me now but you go home and read every bit of the Hat you will understand as you search Acts 3 23 and you kind of run a chain reference as I was meeting with Elias this week and talking to him about the way I study the scripture you kind of run a chain reference on that verse you'll find out that God's pretty particular about how people respond To His prophets now I always like to distinguish between a messenger prophet and a five-fold prophet but notice the book of Acts does not make that distinction and neither do many other places in the scripture so there's something about those who speak for him and the only way that you will be able to stay clear of faults prophets if you know what the word said you won't understand and discern that you have come in contact with a false prophet by studying false prophets I'm going to say it again you'll not be able to discern the difference between a true prophet and a false prophet by studying false prophets you'll only be able to discern the difference by studying a true prophet [Music] [Applause] you don't learn what is a genuine twenty dollar bill by spending your time examining a counterfeit twenty dollar bill on the w you know it's it's it's it's it's adequately named web well I'm preaching now it is a worldwide web you can get caught up in Google and spend a day I told my wife I'm sorry honey I'm she called me to dinner and I didn't jump up but I come in there pretty quick I said I'm I'm picking out my next getaway spot and I got carried away you follow one link if you think you found a good deal you're looking for another one you're looking for another one you're looking for another one because you can book in advance snag up some pretty good deals Say Amen so you can get in that web and never know how to get out and you know it's it's on the ministry of a profit or uh uh historical figure and they locked a point out all the flaws and all the mistakes it seems they like to talk about the times where he might have said 15 years ago when it was closer to 30. [Music] so what we used to travel with a man in different meetings with him and just about every time he got down from speaking we had to say well that really wasn't just the other day that was closer to about eight years ago you see if you spend any time in that Realm of the spirit there is no time there that was good and things can get a little blurry about when it really happened so if you want to know whether or not brother Branham had a genuine Ministry you don't get online and start trying to find the false prophets and see if he's acted like them or sounded like them why don't you get in the word and find some real ones and just start with Elijah amen so I do not believe that brother Brandon Was Elijah reincarnated or or the Elijah who would come and forerun uh the a Ministry there in uh in Revelation chapter 11 the two witnesses we're talking about a man like John the Baptist John the Baptist had his own Ministry but he was anointed with a spirit and power of Elijah what if I told you that I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ not just brother Adam but what if I told you that I personally believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is to be anointed with the spirit and power of Elijah and somebody said boil that down I'll boil it down in two words no compromise [Applause] there was no compromise in Elijah there was no compromise in John the Baptist he stood on the word and it cost him his head there was no compromise in William Branham and it cost him his affiliations we'll let you come and pray for our sick but we can't Turn You Loose to preacher Doctrine we'll use you to draw a crowd and then we'll sit you down and we'll do the preaching teaching come on now those are the kind of things that went on but nonetheless God was faithful to do exactly what he said he would do I want to show you Matthew excuse me I want to show you Malachi 4. verse 5 and 6. behold I God that's not Malachi the prophet that's God talking behold I God will send you you not just the nation of Israel you not just sister Meda you behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and this is the division of his ministry he will come more than one time the first time he comes he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children those patriarchal fathers of the faith will have their hearts turned toward the Pentecostal Apostolic fathers Sons children the heart of the fathers to the children and that was a turning of the patriarchal hearts the hearts of the old Covenant the Hebrew people the Jewish people who walked in the way looking for the Messiah the first time the Elijah anointing falls on a man who is not Elijah in in New Testament times he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the next time he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers now in this verse we become the children and a word has come to restore us back to our book of Acts fathers our Apostolic fathers our Pentecostal fathers somebody said how can you get that because the scripture said that in New Testament we are to earnestly hello we are to earnestly contend for the faith that was what once delivered to the Saints so it's the same Spirit of Elijah but it comes to do two things it comes to turn the hearts of those who have clung to the old Covenant to the New Covenant somebody said what do you mean well let me give you the example because we're coming up on shovel old are you still here we're coming up on shavot and Shavuot is Pentecost 50 days we're nearly halfway through or more 50 days of the counting of the Omer from Feast of unleavened bread Passover up to Pentecost we call it shavot it celebrates the giving of the law to the old fathers and it celebrates the giving of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost to the children there it is so when we celebrate chevot we're celebrating the giving of the law on Mount Sinai to Moses and the people but God chose it's interesting to know some of you may not know it's interesting to know that on the same day that God gave the law to Moses and the children of Israel many years later at the same time of the year on God's appointed calendar this time he doesn't give the law he gives the Holy Ghost Acts chapter 2 takes place at shavot so it reminds us of both the giving of the law of the word and the giving of the Spirit by the Holy Ghost so the first time that Spirit of Elijah returns in the newer Covenant or the New Testament it falls on a man by the name of John the Baptist and it's his ministry to get a hold of some of them old Pharisees and Sadducees those law keepers those who have put such heavy oppression on the Jewish people that they can't even worship God there was so much corruption in the second temple period among the priests that they had moved out of the common places in the city of Jerusalem and they had moved into the upper city where the aristocrats lived the priest had left the common people and they were living in palaces how do we know because we can go and take you we can take you to the ruins of the Palaces the wall w-o-h-l Museum what we call the burn house is in an area just across from the wall w-o-h-l Museum which is a huge building built on top of the ruins of the Priestly homes in the times of the second temple period and not only can you see the ruins of their of their elegant palaces but you can see the water jugs they drink from the archeology of that place is incredible I believe God preserved it so that people would know that by the time Jesus came on the scene the as you have seen him the chosen as you have seen in many Jewish scenes of films telling the story of Jesus he's always having trouble with her Sanhedrin are you still with me he's always having trouble with the Pharisees he's always having trouble with the scribes why because they had become so corrupt in trying to infringe laws some of which were no longer practical at that time okay like for instance when you put a big Camp of people together who travel from all over Israel to to hear Jesus preach you can't always keep enough separation between a woman who is having her cycle and other worshipers so there was a lot of contamination that was going on in that period of time and nobody took into consideration these are unprecedented times we're here to hear the Messiah and so there would be you know lepers would get too close and and uh there was hardly room to separate people there were all kinds of of laws being broken and sanitation laws being broken and if it was Passover somebody might have eaten out of a dish that had been used for leaven and instead of the religious I hope you're following me instead of the religious recognizing this is a visitation of God in the Earth they were going around like like religious snobs telling the people you've got to keep this you're you're going to hell if you don't keep the if you if you don't put the zitseed on with the right prayer and already in the second temple period they were already going through this big ceremony of washing the hands um Benjamin go out to the cabinet there and see if I have a a two-handled jug it's it'd be about this big and would have two handles on it I think it might be there I told you I felt like taking my time some of you won't show up around here Tuesday night so I might as well take Tuesday night's sermon down preach to you today it's there so this was a you know the Bible tells us if we read the ceremonial laws of the Old Testament it tells us that we should the priest washed his hand in the labor before he would go into the presence of God and so forth the Bible tells us we should wash our hands remember the Pharisees rebuked the disciples because they saw them eating without their hands being washed well honey if it was just going down to the river and washing your hands everybody could have done it but the by the second temple period they already had some kind of ritual and I'll be honest with you I can't remember exactly how it goes if it's left over right or right over left first but so I maybe do it wrong are you going to Stone me see but the water goes in you got two handles because you do like this then you do and then you do like that and then you come back and do it the other way so do you understand that if you're in a situation and you didn't bring your jug you might have been caught eating with dirty hands now don't forget now God's word said to wash your hands before you eat that was God's idea but man wasn't satisfied with God's idea he starts taking it a whole lot further and this is what they were doing the the fathers had no tolerance for anything that wasn't old it sounds like people around this message who think it can't be a true worship song if it was written any later than 1955 couldn't be God and so God sent John the Baptist where the spirit and power of Elijah to try to turn the hearts of those old died in the wool fathers and show them yes but it fell onto a cold Stony heart and that's why you struggle to keep it and that's why you add all these fences around it because you've never received it into a soft heart but today God is saying he was saying then in in the book of Acts I want to send the Holy Spirit among you fill you with the Holy Ghost soften up your heart I want to take the Stony heart from you and I want to give you a heart of Flesh not because I'm changing my mind about my word but because I want you to receive my word in in in the right way in the right perspective and not try to beat people with regulations who have never had a new birth see I'll never have to talk to you about your skirt when you've truly had a new birth you'll know it needs to be big enough for you to get in it you can't make people who have not ever had a true New Birth you can't make them understand holiness but once they have a true New Birth somebody said well how do we know because everything changes when you're truly born again you look for reasons to get together with God's people not get away from them so John the Baptist had this kind of an anointing on him he stirred up he believed the word you'll never make him a compromiser he he believed the word so much that he prophesied and caused his child had to be chopped off he said it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip's wife and they chopped off his head because of it but he represented the hearts of the fathers being turned to the apostolic or Pentecostal fathers God was saying I'm updating myself in the land then after that the church Ages come I'm hurrying after that the church Ages come and the truth is almost completely lost tyrants raise up and neroes come Constantine's common the truth is almost annihilated God begins After the Dark Ages he starts putting it back and he raises up a man named Martin Luther who didn't have it all right but he had a revelation that the just doesn't live by confessions and paying alms and uh you know climbing up the steps on with bloody knees and praying Hail Mary beads and kissing the feet of a crucifix that's how far that's how far the truth had drained from the people the majority of Christians in that period worship the church instead of God indulgences that's the word I was looking for they believed in indulgences that they believed in purgatory and they believed that you could die and go to Purgatory but a loved one could come and light a candle and pay an Indulgence to the priest and he could pray a prayer that would spring your soul from purgatory and cause you to go to heaven that was the doctrine of the day you say I didn't know it better than that I don't know if you would have or not because that was the Church of the day so no wonder Martin Luther caused a stink when he nailed his thesis to the wall and said hey we got to get out of this mess this is taking us farther away from God and then it took a man like John Wesley who came along and said it's not enough to just be justified by faith the scripture said we have to be Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and we've got to put away worldliness and we've got to call men to be men and women to be women we've got to deal with the effeminate Spirit that's trying to take a hold of the church now let's let me just get on this a minute do you realize that we are reaping a harvest that the church sowed did you know there was once a time that it was preached for all Christian ladies Baptist Methodist Full Gospel whatever they were that women wear skirts come on you don't tell me I've been studying church history a long time you you you while the Baptist women had long hair they followed teachings like John rice who wrote that book bobbed hair bossy women and women preachers Southern Baptist famous book it'll shake you up I've read it multiple times I may have got it out of order when I read the title there was once a time when almost all the denominations understood the importance of differentiating between the genders just remember that when somebody digs up your bones one day they're not going to be able to figure out by your casket how you identified they're only going to be able to to determine by your remains because there are not a dozen genders [Music] and God didn't make anybody to be a furry because there's people who identify as furries and dress up in cat costumes and dog costumes and and want to go to school and distract our kids do you know we wouldn't be ripping this mess we wouldn't be trying to figure out 15 different genders if the church would have just stood its ground Ed oh you don't have to say Amen if somebody would have just stayed with the word you let a woman dress like a woman you let a man dress like a man you let a woman have long hair you let a man keep his hair short that's not even self teach you the SE that's what the Bible's saying and when preachers preach that the Assemblies of God preach that how do you know because my grandmother was ordained with the assignments of God in 1950. and that's how they believed I asked the dearest friend of my grandmother a woman another woman preacher she wanted us to go to the State uh District Council of the Assemblies of God this was many many years ago she wanted us to go with her and I said I don't really have any desire to go to be honest with you I said the truth of the matter is you and my grandmother will be the only women in there dressed like Christian women and I don't understand why you still have license this was before I heard the message I don't understand why you would still carry license with a denomination that's so far away from what they used to preach and believe they're corrupt now and she said well Steve I'll tell you she said I didn't change she said they changed and every time they look at me they're going to have to remember what they were before they sold their soul to fill up their pews that's hard I'm not trying to pick on protect I'm just telling you history I've told you before I've got I've got uh membership cards that were still being used in the 80s in the assignments of God still saying we don't go to the movie theater we don't go mix bathing to be a member of our church we are not involved with secret societies like Shriners and Masons come on in fact it used to say we don't belong to labor unions because the Holiness I grew up with preached that that was the beginnings of the mark of the beast and had somebody have kept the word [Music] we wouldn't be in the mess we're in today where people choose their pronouns nobody ever told me I had a choice about my pronouns he him I thought that was some people now choose them I don't know if it's a confession of multiple personality disorder a confession of being demonized I don't know what they're confessing to say that we're they and and we I don't want to be referred to as he somebody said call me we isn't that awkward come on wee-wee let's go to town isn't that awkward there was a time oh he's hot today ah we gotta close it's 1 30. some of you haven't smile the whole time it's a truth we gotta stand we're not out condemning other people but when we get in here we better preach the whole book and live the whole book you don't give a former alcoholic a glass of wine and tell him to unwind that's what the church says now well even even Christians they say Sip and Saints even Christians can can in the cool of the day you'd be surprised how many people on my Facebook from from from my travels will show themselves uh at the end of the day with a glass of wine I'm unwinding I say I have said I've inboxed a couple of them said somebody needs to come and wind you up because you've gotten too far away from your Christian testimony instead of unwinding they need to get you pull you in a little bit closer because you don't do things like that especially for people that have already struggled in those areas you let that little bit open up a door somebody said what about I hear you serve real wine and communion I've never known I've never known in my entire life of somebody going back to being an alcoholic because they took a sip of communion wine because of the purpose it is Sanctified and intended for but I'll tell you I believe it's not for Christians to participate in because it'll take you right back to the places where you used to be hello [Music] well I'll just take a little drag of yours then it's all right it's not really mine so much compromise yeah let me get you this one are y'all helping me let me see how quiet it'll get now I'm too tired to come to church on Tuesday night I've been working all day what about the rest of these folks I won't even say me because I realize there are still people that think that pastors only only work Tuesday night and Sunday noon but what about the rest of the people my baby's got a snotty nose don't you don't think ours ever had a snotty nose you don't think you don't think that these some of these sisters here that raise their children you don't think they ever got worn out and tired you don't think they ever went through something I'm going through something so I ain't going to make it tonight if we only come to church when we were going not not going through something we'd never get together see you next millennium you got to put your foot down sometime you gotta say not because I feel like it but because I know what the book says [Applause] we ought not to have to go back and teach ABCs [Applause] but we do then the second part of that I didn't forget the first part he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers denominationally we read that and we say oh that is a a real a reunion between fathers and children I've heard it preach away nobody recognizes the karma nobody recognizes that it's preaching two different comings you really believe that brother Shelley I do I do and let me tell you what Jesus said about it you with me you're ready to go oh in the word or to lunch I didn't say which are you ready to go I gotta say I can tell I'm funny when when I look I always look to Josh to see if he smiles if I pass the Josh test I Look to David I have to be honest David is the harder of the two he don't smile enough I've told him Matthew said he said I'm listening yeah Matthew I'm just picking what a week I've had I got to go to the hospital Monday and meet that sweet little beautiful baby girl and love love her I got to go Wednesday and meet those two absolutely amazing beautiful little girls that Michael and crystalline have had they let me go anybody know how long three minutes is that's a long time to wash your hands three minutes you think that is a short time uh-uh you ain't got but two hands I can wash them in 10 seconds they put the timer on they give you a special bar of soap to scrub they give you something to clean your fingernails I said oh I wish they had to clean mine before I got here I could have just cleaned them here and took up more of my three minutes so I just pretended that I was because there was nothing under there make you go all the way up to your elbows and put your mask on they didn't make me put on a a head thing and we go in there and I get to hold this the I get the whole Adelaide out in the in the waiting room and and she's so tiny and so beautiful and and it's just hard to imagine something that little is alive and thriving you look you look at her and you think this looks like a doll she hardly looks real and then you go back and you touch that little Lydia and she's so tiny but now as of yesterday she is up to three pounds two ounces isn't that wonderful that's wonderful I look like an elephant in that picture I'm big anyway but holding that little thing on my lap what a wonderful week God is a god of Miracles now I want you to go to Matthew 17 and we'll close I'm on page two verse 9 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead I couldn't make a joke but I won't and his disciple must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things stop there they're asking Jesus why do the Pharisees say that Elijah must come first before these things are fulfilled they have just come down from the Transfiguration this is the first question they start asking he's probably still glowing and their question is why why was it their question because they just seen him he appeared there with our Lord so they said why then and Jesus said it's right Elijah must first come and restore all things stop you can read everything about the ministry of John the Baptist if you put it all together it wouldn't take up a whole page what are the all things that John the Baptist who had the spirit and power of Elijah on him what are the all things that He restored did he restore any truth that had been lost not that we know of there is no mention of John the Baptist doing the work of a restorer except that we know by Malachi's prophecy there would be one to come who would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and we can say John the Baptist had a part in doing that but where is the restoration of all things John the Baptist didn't fulfill all of Malachi's prophecy he didn't now let's look at read on just a moment but I say unto you that Elijah Elias is come already now he just said he is to come go back I'm sorry charity I'm not trying to be bossy he just said he must first come and restore all things now what does that sound like to you he's pointing in the future he shall come didn't say he had come then he said he shall come first come and restore all things and then what does he say but I say unto you that Elijah is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they wished they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist when when he said I tell you indeed he has already come he was not speaking about John the Baptist when he said he must first come and restore all things when he said he must first come and restore all things he is speaking about the Elijah spirit that will forerun the second coming when he said I tell you he has already come and they knew him not and did to him what they wanted to do what did they want to do chopped off his head he was then referring to John the Baptist John the Baptist came to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and God had to have another vessel in the last days another prophet in the last days let me ask you was John the Baptist a prophet he was did he come in the spirit and power of Elijah he did was he Elijah did he restore all things he did not did he forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ he did did he turn the hearts of the old I don't know what to say I say patriarchal so that you'll think of Abraham and and and and and and and and Isaac and Jacob and and the Hebrew men Through the Ages did he try to pull those Pharisees into what God was doing today he did whoo he said you Generation of Vipers you better he's not pointing at the Harlot he was pointing at the preacher he was pointing at the religious leaders of the day you were you're just a den of devils thieves you you're just you've got to get right with God so his ministry was to pull those who were clinging to the older Covenant and and and what they had added to it and how difficult they had made it they wanted to make sure they were always needed so they made it so hard that nobody could feel like they had done any good uh someone dies in the camp and the whole Camp becomes unclean because there's so many people crammed into one little spot to hear Jesus how many of you know the law wasn't saying that there was a separation That was supposed to take place among the priesthood not to be contaminated or come in contact with dead bodies meaning touch them or be that close to them let's go to the scene of the chosen when the little woman with the issue of blood she didn't touch his body he touched the Hem of His Garment she touched his seat didn't she and there were the priest you see him he looked like some of those people yesterday walking around grown men after all these years parading around in dresses coronating the king oh I love it it's beautiful it's beautiful to see but it just Smacks it just stings I thought here is a king who says he's going to narrow down and shrink the royal family and their duties and all the money that's spent on them he didn't he didn't let them spare any expense for his coronation did he the golden Chariot he wrote in has anybody ever ever seen it in person I've seen that golden Chariot my wife and I we went to the Royal Muse in London and we saw all the Chariots and the horses that were being used in that time it was an incredible thing to see but that Chariot could feed all the homeless in the UK unbelievable value I'm not I'm not saying anything about it's a beautiful pageantry no doubt about it but but there's something about the you know the Archbishop and the and the anointing behind the curtain in the stone of scone and all these things that just smack of religion and here is a divorced man marrying a divorced woman and as of yesterday he became the the the the appointee of God to rule a nation and speaks with the authority you do understand that they believe that he speaks like the pope with the authority of God for the nation it's a serious serious thought and his mother fought against it her whole life because she did not believe that that he was qualified because of that sin to be the the vicar of the Church of England the highest Authority in the Church of England it's interesting but I can see it here are the Pharisees they needed a John the Baptist to stir things up they needed somebody to look him in the face and say you become so religious you stink there's no sincerity in your heart you're more concerned about him going into the river and walk then you are the miracle that and wash then the miracle that has just taken place a woman tormented with an issue of blood her whole life and now she's been healed and instead of rejoicing and praising God for the miracle you want to make sure he gets down didn't Jesus turn it upside down in the movie anyway I hope that really happened I hope he really did go down there and splash like a kid if anybody ever deserved to do it he did but John the Baptist fulfilled his part of the Malachi 4 Commission but it was not time for all things to be restored 2 000 years ago it was only in our day when we come all the way to the last Church age laodicea when all things had to be restored I'm sorry to tell you that when it came time to do such God didn't choose a graduate of Asbury Theological Seminary he didn't choose a graduate of uh of the Baptist Dallas Theological Seminary he chose someone with barely an elementary school education who wouldn't mix the word of the Lord with opinion [Applause] who wouldn't entertain who didn't believe in in in selling Bean dinners to pay the pastor when God had already made a way for him to survive come on now God knew all things had to be restored and he also knew that now now the children have to have their hearts turned back to the fathers which are no longer the Old Testament patriarchal fathers our fathers were those on the day of Pentecost so that that was clinging to the old they had to embrace the new that God did on the day of Pentecost and then the church World goes down and the truth goes down and now it's being restored and as I told you a moment ago Luther came and Wesley came and then God sent a message by sending a man with the spirit and power of Elijah who would fulfill the second part of the Elijah commission what John the Baptist could not fulfill or did not fulfill God had someone chosen to fulfill that aren't you adding to the Bible no I'm trying to see the Bible fulfilled in my day I'm telling you the word still lives today how do you know this is it because it has restored all things we now know the godhead by the word not by Brother random he just pointed us to the word and once you take a look at the word you'll never swallow three persons again we now have the right baptism which is not to be in the name of titles it's to be in the name we now know that Sinners are not given eternal life to live for eternity and Punishment the only ones who have eternal life are those who are born again by the blood of the Lamb the Bible said the soul that Sinners shall surely die and one day they will but no soul with eternal life we now know that we now know the Rapture is more than than a blinking of an eye it's a process it's the Lord coming first in a message it's a word coming first it's a shout going forth first we now recognize that why because all things have been restored we now know that communion is not soda crackers and grape juice we now know that it's to be unleavened bread and it's to mean more than just grabbing a bottle of grape juice on the way to church it's to be taken with real wine because it represents the blood of Jesus Christ grape juice spoils wine rarely spoils when it's put up properly in fact it gets sweeter and more valuable the older it gets just like the blood it's sweeter sweeter oh Hallelujah the blood hadn't lost its power somebody say man the blood hasn't lost its power can't smile we now know that we now know you don't get baptized three times in the name of the father in the name of the Son and the Holy Ghost like some denominations do we now know that there was no one in the Bible not one single solitary scripture in the Bible anywhere that ever tells us that anybody was ever taken under the water using those titles father son Holy Ghost nowhere in the Bible every baptism recorded in the scripture was either in the name of Jesus or in the name of Jesus Christ none of them using Father Son and Holy Ghost so either they disobeyed the word of the Lord or they had a revelation of what the Lord was trying to teach them how do we know that because all things have been restored what John the Baptist didn't finish God sent brother Branham in his day you can believe it or not I'm not here to sell you anything but I'm telling you why it matters I'm telling you why I'm going to mention his name I'm telling you why I'm going to quote him when I want to quote him I'm going to tell you that if I want to tell a story about his life I'm going to do it and I recognize that he's just a man that God chose to use he is not invaluable his words are not the absolute amen one time he said he was commissioned in 46 and the other time he said he was commissioned in 37. and I say it doesn't matter what year it doesn't matter to me whether he was born April 6 of 1909 or April 9th of 1906. I'm not looking at that it doesn't matter to me whether he was in the in the in the desert out there on Sunset a mountain when the when the Angels Came Down When the cloud let's just say when the cloud was taken doesn't matter to me if he was there that day or not all these things that matter to so many people doesn't really matter after all because we're not we're not following an info an infallible man we're following a man just like John the Baptist who was a human being but that spirit and power of Elijah fell on him and he was a prophet then I'm telling you come on now and He restored all things anybody with me all right I'm not quite done but I'm almost done all you people I don't know if you're still amen and or not let me see yeah some of you are thank God for you in the message of trial we got a lot to cover but we'll have to do it next time paragraph 145. and he spoke down on the river he said as John the Baptist was sent forth to proclaim the coming of Christ at the end of his ministry Jesus came and as John was sent so will your ministry for run the second coming of Christ sometimes he said your ministry sometimes he said your message sometimes brother Branham said he said you it doesn't matter to me whether it was your ministry your message a message or you doesn't matter to me because I've seen all things restored you understand when you see all things restored you become a believer and it's easier for you to believe than to disbelieve I've seen all things restored he goes on we're waiting for his coming he is vindicating himself showing now this is what I think is important to leave you with in questions and answers on the seals 1963. paragraph 252. and finally one day he said behold there he is who's he talking about tell me John the Baptist John the Baptist is pointing at the lamb Jesus he said and finally one day he said behold there he is there is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he said and my time is up now this is John the Baptist he's quoting I've introduced you to him I must decrease now I must go off the scene he'll take over from here the Millennium will be on right away see and the time at hand then when he come when now is he talking about John the Baptist all the way through no put it back up he's telling you as John the Baptist said I must back further I must decrease he must increase so you're seeing something here you're seeing the other end of that Elijah spirit you're seeing that he came the first time to introduce Jesus Christ in his first coming and he came the second time the spirit and power of John the Baptist a spirit of Elijah excuse me the spirit and power of of Elijah that was on John the Baptist came the first time to introduce Jesus Christ the first time he came in the ministry of William Branham to introduce the second coming of Christ and here brother Branham says I've introduced you to him I must decrease now I must go off the scene let's go on he'll take over from here now where are we we're faced with a musicians are coming we're faced with quite a dilemma in our day we really are challenged are you with me you've done pretty good thank you thank you thank you we're faced with quite a dilemma in our day because here we have heard that John the Baptist wanted to decrease so that Jesus could increase and here we have heard that brother Branham desired to decrease so that Jesus could increase and then you and I are faced with the Dilemma how do we keep the balance listen how do we mention him and quote him and recognize the ministry that he had without getting our eyes off of Jesus how many of you believe it's vitally important that we keep our eyes on Jesus Christ now if you make brother Branham infallible what does that mean what does infallibility mean without wrong without mistake if you make brother Branham infallible as one who never made a mistake you contradict the message he said I make thousands of mistakes every day which I believe was a mistake I don't believe he made a thought I believe he was exaggerating I don't believe he made a thousand mistakes I don't believe I make a thousand mistakes every day maybe a few hundred but I don't believe I make a thousand mistakes every day why do you think he was exaggerating so because he wanted to get the the point across to the people I'm your brother yes I'm not your savior I'm your brother you that are saying funny things about me he said if you're saying that Christ lives in me I pray you are correct but if you're saying that I am he you make me an antichrist how do we keep our balance when we see a Ministry so close to the ministry of Jesus Christ like the world has never seen one greater a minister greater than that of John the Baptist one that restored all things when we see a Ministry like that how do we make sure that we keep Jesus in the right position and we let brother Branham have his right position well for the one thing we don't hang his pictures up on the wall with Jesus on one side and brother Branham on the other and make them look to the people as though they're equal because Jesus was not a sinner saved by grace William Branham was he'll tell you about his birth there was no angel that came and overshadowed his mother he said I'm a product of Charles and Ella Branham they came together in a sexual Union I I had to be saved I he was a a pro you believe John the Baptist had to receive the truth and be washed sure he did you believe all the holy prophets and apostles you believe Peter had to be saved and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and received the Holy Ghost sure do you believe Mary the mother of Jesus had to have the Holy Ghost she did you believe brother Brandon had to do the same so what do I say to the Congress I know it's a little tough in here we're closing what do I say to the I'm not condemning I know you churches decide to do that I decide not to and because I decide not to you say I'm not a message church here now I'm explaining to you why I don't I don't want you to come in here and see Hoffman's head of Christ and brother branham's picture here now when I first came around the message it was Hoffman's head and it was brother Branham in a studio pose as the years went by they took the studio pose down and they put the pillar of fire picture up and I've heard them say it's the same if you're looking at the pillar of fire over his head you could say that but if you're looking at the man William Branham he was not the same sinner saved by grace so how do we keep our balance when you stand up and say this message is my absolute you're not keeping a balance because which one example which May the 7th 1946 or May the 7th 1937. which is the absolute I've asked questions like that of these learned men and they've said to me both and I don't mean to be disrespectful but I say that's good good bologna sandwich how do we keep our balance in the scripture is it when brother Branham said there was an eternal hell or when he said there wasn't there are many many things that we can do to make sure that we keep our Focus not on the Forerunner I've introduced you to him now he's taking over let me give you the ultimate one right here it's not in a picture it's not in the songs we sing it's in a heart that makes a decision I'm going to take everything back to the word if the word is our Focus this is Christ this is Christ in written form oh yes if the word is our Focus if Jesus is our Focus then we take everything we hear on Sunday morning back to the word Sunday evening if we listen to a tape we take everything we hear back to the word so that we always have Jesus here we have brother Branham and and John the Baptist here is or runners and we have a five-fold Ministry come on the voice of many Waters it's vitally important as we begin to go through these end time events again and we begin to look at the seals and and at some point the Thunders it's vitally important that we let our Focus be on Jesus Christ because had there been no Christ had there been no blood had there been no Grace had there not been a savior you and I could be religious and we could know all the Mysteries and be lost it's Jesus I see let's stand oh praise the lord it's Jesus that I see the son of man revealed in you and me I thank God I'm part of the families where the people are perfect as can be don't speak evil of your brother lest you speak evil of the law for we know law is perfect without a single flaw as long as your brothers repented of the wrong that he has done your brother is as perfect as perfect as can be all praise the Lord are it's Jesus that I see yes Lord the son of man revealed in you and me I thank God part of this family [Music] sing again praise the Lord O praise the Lord [Music] thank you [Music] we're the people are perfect as can be listen to this verse let's go on unto Perfection though we are potentially Christ is formed within us and all promises believe that this body [Music] right into the heavenly CE where the people are perfect as can be sing again o praise the Lord [Music] Lord we want to see you [Music] oh [Music] we're the people let me sing this verse we've rarely ever sung it let's go on unto Perfections though we are potentially till Christ is formed within us and all promises believe and this body is translated right into the heavenly where the people of the Lord are perfect as can be oh praise the Lord was that another verse charity do you have the son of man the son of man oh I thank God I'm part of this family we're the people where the people [Music] oh I'm looking through all looking glass I tell you what I see the people of the lord they're as perfect as can be cause I'm looking through the blood of God and this whoa oh let's do that verse again think about what you're singing oh I'm looking through glass I tell you what I see the people of the Lord the people of the lord they're asked perfect as can be cause I'm looking through the blood of God and this is what I the people are as perfect as perfect as can be oh praise the Lord the son of man [Music] where the people you you you you may not feel perfect you may not behave perfect but we're not looking in the natural I'm not looking through these glasses I'm looking through the blood of God hello now I want to I want to just interview the church just a minute brother Billy you think you're something back there don't you holding that new grandbaby what year did you come to New Hope 91 how many years ago was that you mathematicians 32 years ago all right what I preached today about brother branham's place with Jesus is there anything in that that is different than what you have heard me preach through the years does that seem to be where we have stood for those 30 years right I know it's on the spot brother Greeley what year did you come 96 did that seem to be pretty consistent today where I believe brother Brandon belongs in the right place with the great honor and great respect but not the absolute and he wanted us to see Jesus how many years was that Nathan 27 years I tell you what I wonder how many hours you've listened to me preaching 27 years almost 5 000 hours you think that's all no wonder I'm wrinkled I'm tired if you would have breached 4 500 hours you'd be tired too Chad when did you come 90. you mean you was here before brother Billy 1990 that's been 33 years about right part of them times you was a youngin getting whoopings and then and a young adult getting whippings but is that pretty consistent what I've said today is this some new doctrine I'm preaching about brother Branham either way I mean does this feel new to you or something like I I'm saying it different than I believed it or does it seem about what we've stood for all these years thank you my wife has been married to me how 25 26 years going on does that seem pretty consistent with what the balance is sister Beverly what year did you come 90. does that seem about right to you you were an adult with children grown children just about so you you heard a lot of preaching wonder how many years sister wonder how how much how many hours does sister Beverly listen to then yeah yeah if she was hearing them early years I preached four hours and then and then and have church for another four or so which we did then can I just say to you people if you don't make the Rapture it's not my fault I've done my part Lord I'm retiring sister Elita how many years have you been here 95 how many years is that 28 years seemed what I've preached today seemed to be the balance that we've always tried to keep with Jesus in the right spot and brother Branham in the right spot you know I love brother Branham I want you to know I'm so thankful for him I really am I I love it I've slept in his bed I laid my head on his pillow I covered up with his blanket I I love to walk where he walked I like to see what he saw I like to eat in the restaurants he ate in and I've ordered the same meal that he ordered because I love him but I know like you know it's Jesus we've we've been introduced to to the Lord Jesus Christ aren't we blessed uh Benjamin is going to come I could go around the room and some of you less than a year or a little more the sister Weems what year did you come 92. do you what I've heard what I've preached today that you were able to hear about brother Branham and Jesus in the right does that seem to be where we've tried to have it all along all right all right well I'm not trying to say look what I've done I'm just saying I I have a feeling you know some people may think I'm putting too much emphasis on brother bam this morning and there might be some I thought I wasn't putting enough and I just want you to know we're just trying to maintain the balance we've always maintained and uh you know if it come right down to it it it's Jesus it's Jesus can we come worship Jesus I know it's late but can we lift him up in this house before we go today thank you all for being put on the spot and and I didn't mean to embarrass you but you should speak up right Wonderful Merciful Savior Yes precious Redeemer and Friends [Music] oh you rescue rescue The Souls of men yes counselors [Music] you are the one that we praise [Music] oh our hearts always hunger [Music] oh our hearts always hunger for eign [Music] falling before we falling before your throne oh [Music] you can't replace [Applause] [Music] words [Music] increase [Music] history [Music] rescue the swords [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's always let's agree together for your need to be met father we stand here today thanking you that you change not es the power that you had to heal the sick in the New Testament is the same power that you have today there are sick and needy among us there are those who need Restoration in their body we are calling on you right now with your stripes we are healed we claim that promise right now we release the healing virtue of Jesus Christ across this building Lord we take you at your word we lift up Ashley to you right now that you will heal her body she will heal incisions that you will strengthen her and pour into her physical body everything she needs to nourish this child that you have blessed them with what Joy these new babies have brought to our hearts we thank you for the ones that are on the way Hallelujah the pain that we may be walking through today we thank you for Restoration in the precious name of Jesus Christ would you love one another as he sings that chorus again and you start making your way back to your seat but would you love one another [Music] hearts always [Music] hunger for created me sing this prayer with us created me a clean heart [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah oh but restore unto me joy the joy of thy salvation you are right spirit Within Me and renew our right spirit amazing in the Lord good I'm a little tired to try to minister to you in any other way today but God is good and faithful and true all we have to do is trust him and believe he'll bring us through whatever it is that we're facing be seated just a moment I thought we were getting out you are you really are I want to tell you something if you're not fully persuaded of the things that I have spoken of today you pray just pray just pray don't be critical don't be critical just pray you ask the Lord to reveal it to you and if he wants you to know something more than what you know he'll reveal it but don't be critical it's important that you're not critical and here's here is the point if God has sent a prophet to reject him a serious business somebody said well what about those that don't hear we're not talking to them God gave you an opportunity to hear what you do with what you have heard is between you and the Lord I know some of you are going through things in your life and that this is not the kind of a message that could perhaps speak to you in that moment but I've obeyed the Lord today I've done what he told me to do and then I have to trust that he will take care of you in your time of need don't let the enemy cause you to be critical and don't let the enemy exaggerate anything that has been spoken today you watch it carefully it'll be on the app if you would like to go back and hear it again and make sure you heard it right but it's important it's important that you that you know where we stand in these things because we're going to move on now we're going to move on to whatever the Lord is calling us to we want to study some things from the word and the message and we want to get it right and the only way to get the message right is to keep our balance in the scripture if you believe that say Amen why would God why would God want to reveal these things to us because we need to know how to navigate the future I'm not planning to live here that much longer I plan to take a trip don't you amen so I just want you to pray and be very considerate uh uh of of that that you that you don't let the enemy uh cause you to criticize what you don't understand you ask the Lord to show it to you and open it up to you and if it's for you he will he will and don't don't get upset and say I'm going to quit coming to church because I don't understand it you come to church where you belong to be you let God touch you you don't have to believe everything I believe to come to church here but I'm going to tell you what I believe the word said and you just you just hold it like Mary ponder it in your heart and see if it be for you and God's speaking to you amen it's a whole lot more likely that you will change than we it is I I think I've done made my mark now I don't see nothing to go back to I've been out there I've met all the leading Prophets of the Pentecostal charismatic world I've met them all I've been in there in their green rooms I've spoken with them I've met them all and believe me nothing I found in 10 years of travel begins to compare with the integrity of the ministry of brother Branham none of it so if I were to be persuaded this was not the Fulfillment of the power and spirit of Elijah Verde somebody would have to get up mighty early in the morning to show me somebody that could do it it has been done and we are the beneficiaries sister Alfreda I left you out but not on purpose how many years have you been here here in 93 and on the hookup since 92 and when did we meet the first time in in Michigan in April of 92 uh just last week or so what it was the anniversary wasn't it of meeting in 92 and you were in the meetings and you were there at brother branham's memorial service in Phoenix is that right you you were you there sister Alfreda you were there when uh you what was the service you were in this day the scripture is fulfilled yes and as far as you know what I've said today is what we have preached consistently have I introduced something new and out out of the way this morning as far as you know seems to be about the same Zachary came in a carrier was I preaching it back then in the carrier Zachary you as far as you know I was ain't I blessed the babes heard me or they do what was that tally said what was that just recently that tally said about the podcast then somebody just tell me something that Talia said Joshua was it you who told me Talia tell me what did you hear on the podcast can't remember me either we're in the same boat I don't remember either oh the sticky floor she asked who did she ask Joshua she said now how old is she five that she hadn't forgotten and that could be true you could go right around to these little children they might not get it all but but that stayed in her mind several days later that was the podcast one and that stayed in her mind and she I tell you what it's it's good to have your children under the truth you're dismissed to go oh Benjamin said it sure is but get me some children here to get under the truth God bless you you're dismissed to God you had that one coming God bless you you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord love one another I'm I'm glad to hear you so persuaded here you are talking about a song Can't You we won't we won't I don't know I don't say grandma or grandmother what will you be Grammy I want Grammy to be able to have some time with her
