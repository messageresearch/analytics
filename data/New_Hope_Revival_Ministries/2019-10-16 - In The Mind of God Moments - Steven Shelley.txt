Description:
By the baptism of the Holy Ghost, we can say, "God lives within me."
Right now we are working to get the natural life out so that we can walk in the Spirit life.
God became a man that we might become the sons of God. We now have that seed life of God in us & one day soon we will begin to function with that life as the Bride. That will be our finest hour. That is what we are called to & we must call it into existence by faith.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in the mind of God today she operates in the fullness of her adoption Jesus was the fullness of God in a body you and I have a portion of God a portion of the great eternal Spirit of God living inside of us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we can already say that God lives within me right so the work that's going on now is to get man out of me get flesh out of me get so issues there within me so that I can live not from the natural life not from the flesh life not even from the soul life but from the spirit life which is a supernatural life which is a portion of the original pillar of fire that's what's living on the inside of us so God became men that we the fallen men of God men fallen sons of the earth could become the sons of God what does it mean to be a son of God you know it means to have his seed it means to have the seed of your father a sperma life inside of you if you have that sperma life that new birth life living inside of you then one of these days by His grace we will step with that life we will speak with that life we will think with that life we will function with that line that'll be the bride's finest hour I know that the way to get us there is to call it now it is and that's where people have a problem and that's because we've been so disappointed with what we have hoped and believed in thawed and expected and so we're in such a pickle that we we have a hard time declaring it to be as it really is but this is finished in the and of God we are seated today heavenly places in Christ Jesus in the mind of God today the bride has thus saith the Lord in the mind of God today she operates in the fullness of her adoption and the way to be able to demonstrate it and move forward into it is to call it into existence by faith [Music]
