[0:01] [Music]
[0:16] I'm wondering if you've ever done work
[0:19] for someone maybe a job an odd job
[0:23] around their house or property maybe it
[0:25] was painting or even mowing the lawn and
[0:28] the owner of that property hand you a
[0:32] check before you ever started and said
[0:35] I'm gonna sign my name and whenever
[0:38] you're finished you just make out the
[0:40] check for whatever you want and it'll be
[0:42] good I don't think that happens very
[0:45] often but I want you to know that as a
[0:49] believer our Father has given us that
[0:53] blank not only blank check but a blank
[0:57] checkbook the Lord Jesus his name is
[1:00] signed on the bottom of every one of
[1:02] those checks and we are encouraged to
[1:06] ask him for our needs I love John
[1:11] chapter 15 in that chapter in my Bible
[1:16] it's full of red letters and that means
[1:18] it's full of the words of Jesus in John
[1:22] 15:1 jesus said I am the vine and you
[1:25] are the branches he goes on to explain
[1:29] that the branches must remain connected
[1:33] to the vine the branches do not have
[1:36] life of their own but they're grafted
[1:40] into the vine or attached to the vine
[1:42] and their life is really his life and if
[1:47] they remain that way they'll bear fruit
[1:49] and we want to be fruitful for sure in
[1:54] John chapter 15 and verse 7 Jesus said
[1:58] particularly if ye abide in me and my
[2:02] words abide in you you will ask what you
[2:08] will and it shall be done unto you now
[2:13] that's a promise that you can really
[2:16] take to the bank
[2:18] because everything you and I have need
[2:21] of on this journey in life it has
[2:26] already been deposited into our Grace
[2:29] account if we need salvation salvation
[2:34] is in our account divine healing is in
[2:39] our account already paid for by the
[2:42] death of our Lord Jesus Christ by the
[2:45] stripes that he bore on his precious
[2:48] back sometimes you and I as believers we
[2:51] may be afraid to write out the check to
[2:56] make a withdrawal
[2:57] on that account there's one way that we
[3:01] can make sure that fear doesn't keep us
[3:04] from making a withdrawal on what has
[3:08] already been provided for us and that is
[3:12] heed the words of our Lord in verse 7 if
[3:17] you abide in me and my words abide in
[3:21] you you shall ask in the amplified bible
[3:25] it says if you live in me abide vitally
[3:31] united to me and my words remain in you
[3:35] and continue to live in your hearts ask
[3:39] whatever you will and it shall be done
[3:42] for you it says something very similar
[3:45] in the complete Jewish Bible in fact in
[3:49] all of the different translations that I
[3:52] looked in it all says something very
[3:54] similar the truth is that if you and I
[3:58] will hear the word of the Lord if we
[4:03] will surrender our lives to that word
[4:05] and seek to obey the Lord then we have
[4:09] the checkbook in our hands maybe we
[4:14] could look at it this way
[4:16] say for instance daddy says to Johnny
[4:20] his son you go outside and play now
[4:24] and stay out of the street now Johnny
[4:28] you know that the cars come by very fast
[4:31] on our street and if you're playing out
[4:34] in that Street and someone comes along
[4:36] that doesn't see you in time it could
[4:39] take your life and if you'll play in the
[4:43] yard as I've asked you to do when you
[4:45] come in in the afternoon I'll have a
[4:48] popsicle for you Oh Johnny's excited
[4:51] about that it he goes outside and plays
[4:53] in the front yard and for a little while
[4:56] the neighbors come over and play with
[4:57] him and he's very occupied when they
[5:00] have to go home he gets rather bored and
[5:02] he says I really would like to kick a
[5:04] can around in the street the next thing
[5:07] you know Johnny is out in the middle of
[5:09] the street and literally cars are having
[5:12] to dodge Johnny and his kin in a little
[5:17] while even that doesn't occupy him and
[5:19] he comes inside and he says alright dad
[5:21] I'm ready for my popsicle
[5:23] and his dad said but Johnny I can't give
[5:27] you a popsicle I asked you to stay in
[5:30] the yard for your own safety for your
[5:33] own protection
[5:34] and instead you were right out in the
[5:38] middle of the street again it could have
[5:41] been bad Johnny if I give you the
[5:44] popsicle how will you ever learn the
[5:47] importance of doing what daddy asks you
[5:50] to do you know that makes a world of
[5:53] sense to me
[5:53] I was once that boy for one thing it
[5:59] also makes sense because that's really
[6:01] what Jesus is saying in John 15 and
[6:04] verse 7 if you'll keep my word in your
[6:08] heart not just as something beautiful
[6:11] like poetry or something do to memorize
[6:15] but if you will keep it in your heart so
[6:19] that it can guide you and instruct you
[6:23] literally it's for our own safety it's
[6:26] for our own protection that God has
[6:29] given us this precious word he said and
[6:33] if you'll do that
[6:35] and remain in fellowship with me unity
[6:39] with me union with me then you can ask
[6:43] whatever you will and it'll be given to
[6:46] you I tell you that's powerful it's so
[6:50] very powerful it's like having the
[6:53] checkbook
[6:54] the Lord Jesus his signature at the
[6:58] bottom a very special servant of the
[7:01] Lord a man who was a prophet of God
[7:04] brother William Branham was preaching
[7:07] many years ago about God's checkbook and
[7:11] he said everything you need is made
[7:15] available for you just like we said a
[7:17] moment ago but he said all you have to
[7:21] do is put your name right down there
[7:24] co-sign your name with Jesus Christ and
[7:28] then cash that check if it gets to the
[7:33] clearing house and everything is in
[7:36] order then whatever the check has been
[7:40] made for will be yours that is so
[7:43] powerful to me
[7:45] we are co-signing what what part do we
[7:48] have well we have our faith we have to
[7:52] put our faith in there we have to
[7:54] believe that if we ask we know how we've
[7:58] lived we know we have surrendered to the
[8:01] Lord we've repented of our sin we know
[8:04] what the promise is and if we can truly
[8:08] believe only belief then we write our
[8:11] names right beside the Lord the clearing
[8:15] house is just someone checking to make
[8:17] sure that all the funds are in order and
[8:20] the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God I think
[8:24] he acts as that clearing house we know
[8:28] when we're not doing what the Lord has
[8:30] asked us to do
[8:32] we know it s believers we feel that
[8:35] little prick in our heart I just want to
[8:38] encourage you today to do everything you
[8:43] can to stay in Jesus in fellowship and
[8:48] in communion with him what a promise
[8:52] what a gift he's given us if you abide
[8:56] in me and my words abide in you you will
[9:02] have the checkbook and you can write it
[9:06] out for whatever you have need of I
[9:10] believe him with all my heart god bless
[9:14] you
