TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] we used to go to church and feel the spirit of the lord our needs were met when on his name we'd call in his house we'd worship him one mind and one accord and oh how the blessings they would fall well it seems so hard at times to get this whole world on from my eyes even little hills seems so tall but my mind goes back to calvary whereby jesus died for me it's not so hard to praise him after all no it's not so where hard to of all his stuff before he gave this life for all mankind look where he caught me bro when i think of all his suffering my troubles seem so small it's not so hard to praise it after all well we'd all enjoy the blessings when the lord would pour them out songs of praise would seem to be so strong and some brother would testify and he'd make you want to shout about how he'd been with jesus all day long now the singing of the choir seemed usher in the fire you could feel god's spirit wall to all the strength that i acquired though i come to church so tired i found it wasn't hard to praise it after all no no no it's not so hard to praise it where to think of all he's done how he gave this life for all mankind look where he brought me from when i think of all his suffering my troubles seem so small it's not so hard to praise it after all no no no no it's not so hard to praise him when i think of all he's done how he gave this life for all mankind look where he brought me from when i think of all his suffering by trouble seems so small it's not so hard to praise it after all when i think of all his suffering my trouble seems so small it's not so hard to praise it after all
