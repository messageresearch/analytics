[0:00] it's about rights we
[0:03] want our rights
[0:08] [Music]
[0:12] it looks like nobody is in control
[0:15] doesn't it to you
[0:16] it looks like nobody is in control but i
[0:18] have news for you
[0:20] today that in the chaos and in the
[0:23] confusion
[0:24] and in the anarchy of this world there's
[0:27] still a god
[0:28] who sits above it all and when this
[0:31] thing is finished
[0:32] he will have glory for his name
[0:36] we're speaking redemption over
[0:39] situations that look
[0:40] unredeemable but because he is faithful
[0:44] because he never loses a case hallelujah
[0:48] we know that he will step in and he will
[0:51] get
[0:51] glory for his name because
[0:54] in the chaos of the earth above the
[0:57] earth
[0:58] in the other realm in the dimension of
[1:00] the spirit
[1:01] there is an order that we don't always
[1:05] understand on planet earth but i'm
[1:07] telling you
[1:08] in the spirit realm there is an
[1:12] order you see in all of this
[1:15] in all of the chaos and in all of the
[1:17] struggle
[1:18] for authority and to find who's right do
[1:21] you
[1:21] not know do you not remember what this
[1:23] whole war is about
[1:25] it's about rights we want
[1:28] our rights isn't that the church age
[1:32] isn't that what laodicea was all about
[1:35] the age of people's rights
[1:37] everybody wants their rights well i want
[1:40] you to know
[1:40] at the end of getting all your rights
[1:43] you'll
[1:44] still be miserable if you have not
[1:46] surrendered your life
[1:48] to the order of a living god if you've
[1:51] not allowed the word to penetrate the
[1:54] darkness of your heart
[1:55] you'll be miserable if you get all of
[1:58] your rights
[2:00] a woman wants right it's my body
[2:03] i can do whatever i want to and workers
[2:06] want rights and
[2:07] racism is causing all of those problems
[2:10] and and on and on it's about everybody
[2:12] getting their rights but over here in
[2:13] the kingdom of god
[2:16] it's not about getting your rights
[2:20] it's about letting them down
[2:24] it's about saying i've had my rights
[2:27] i've demanded my way
[2:29] and my way whoa my way has led me to
[2:32] depression
[2:35] my my way has put me on drugs
[2:39] my way has caused me to suck a bottle
[2:42] and have a beverage
[2:43] control my life my way has wrapped me up
[2:47] in addiction
[2:48] and in misery and i can't get out of my
[2:51] memories
[2:52] in order to live in the present because
[2:54] i'm i'm arrested hear me now
[2:57] i'm behind the bars of my past and i
[3:00] cannot see my present
[3:02] and i have no hope for my future because
[3:05] i'm in a prison
[3:06] of my past and you always will be
[3:10] as long as you're toning aside i what
[3:12] about
[3:13] me what about my feelings
[3:17] why am i invisible why doesn't my life
[3:20] matter
[3:21] why don't i count i want you to know
[3:24] that is a
[3:25] prison and it is a gerbil wheel
[3:28] that will keep you running running
[3:30] running running running
[3:32] but never changing direction you'll run
[3:35] and you'll have misery
[3:36] you'll run and you'll have heartache and
[3:38] you'll run and you'll have sorrow
[3:40] because until you learn that all that
[3:43] he's after
[3:44] is your heart he just wants your
[3:47] surrender
[3:48] and your surrender says not my way not
[3:52] my will not my rights
[3:55] not what i want lord your will
[4:00] [Music]
