know that these victories are working something in us if we'll let them it is working in me i thank the lord to be able to know that his word is working in me i'm gonna switch things around just a little bit because i don't have a lot of voice don't even have voice to sing today but i pressed my way here today because i want to keep this ball of fire moving do my part to keep this ball of fire

letting him work in us and through us so i'm going to receive the tithing offering today we're going to give as giving unto the lord the tithe belongs to the lord that's his to start with the first fruits belong to him and our offering we give on top of that and in just a few moments we'll receive the offering on the principle of the loan brother david mann brother steve shaw i'm going to ask

on the principle of the loan of this property today i want you to come and give it to the lord we're giving it to him honoring his word believing that he is helping us to take care of this mortgage debt thus far 147 091 dollars has been given toward this and we're believing we're believing by the grace of god that this loan will not have to be renewed that's what i'm asking the lord for that the loan will not have to be renewed next year by the grace of god so if you brought it with you will you come and drop it in this bag over here please sing again benjamin [Music] [Music] are weak but he is strong oh yes jesus loves me oh yes jesus loves me [Music] now father how blessed we are to be able to know that you provided everything that we have and we honor you today for giving us our daily bread you give us lord everything that we have need of as we sang a while ago maybe the clothes that we have on are not new we may not be wealthy people but what we have we know it came from you and we want to thank you for your blessings on us so i pray god that you would pour your blessing back on the giver as they have given their tithe and their offering and they also brought an offering for the principle of the mortgage that we have here on this property lord those that may give online or send something in we're sending blessing to them in the name of jesus christ asking lord that you will let great blessing fall down on each one as we keep covenant with you we give you glory and honor lord and we thank you that you know how to multiply we give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen thank you brothers the lord bless you thank you jesus thank you jesus would you stand with us i'm going to let brother shelley uh speak the uh the needs that we have here and pray over them because i've not got much voice left but we want to invite him to come we've come because we want to hear what the lord would say to us we don't come to see each other although fellowship is a part of coming to the house of the lord but we've come to give our lord praise and honor and to receive from his word and when we come with expectation we know that he's going to pour out his spirit on us be flat please thou art worthy [Music] though art worthy thou art worthy [Music] come on [Music] [Music] all things created [Music] all these [Music] and for thy pleasure and for thy pleasure they are [Music] do you believe jesus is worthy today let's give him a handclap of praise wonderful is our god [Music] bless his holy name praise god you may be seated this morning it is wonderful to see you in the house of the lord we have some missing this morning but you're not and so we want to thank god for you and we're praying for those who are not with us and some have already uh checked in on the stream so that we would know that they are there and we send greetings and love to all of you brother cliff halls especially wanted if it was appropriate he said and i think it is to thank you all for your prayers for him the lord really undertook and he is at home and as many of you know the battle for health is perhaps not over but uh what a major victory he has had so would you give god praise with me let's thank the lord for touching brother cliff halls today uh sister julie his sister and uh also daniel were so good and so faithful and mindful to keep me posted several times a day of his condition and every time we prayed and you know he was really heavy on our hearts and it's very difficult to be so far away and not know anything so they were a real blessing to help us to know what was going on and help us to sort of target our prayers but he has gained the victory by the grace of god now it's been traumatic for that family so we want to lift them all up to the lord benjamin sang this morning thank you lord for your blessings on me the author of that song james madison easter jeff easter if you know the jeff and sherry easter his dad wrote that song with his brothers he is in intensive care uh on a ventilator with uh with kovid and but is gaining some strength and gaining some health i do not remember his age he's in his 80s but he is gaining strength and prayer is making a difference his wife also has covenant and is at home with it and they have been asking people on online to pray uh for them a couple years ago we had an opportunity to visit in his music shop and talk with him for a long time and we have stayed connected through messenger and uh so we're praying for that family and praying that the lord will bring him through he's probably got a song or two yet to sing and so i thought it was appropriate that we sung that song this morning that's gone around the world thank you lord for your blessings on me uh sister rhonda shaw please pray for me i'm still having pain sitting also i'm having a cat scan and on my liver and stomach on tuesday believing for no growths and for continued healing sister ronda so let's believe the lord for her victory and uh brother greeley has said that uh brother nathan and sister shoshanna are not well with sinus infections and whatever or or am i adding to it what did you say and headaches that go with that any most any real sinus problems ghost comes with pressure and and headaches like that and i guess sister sandy are you feeling some better praise god for the victory amen there's a tremendous amount of people i know who are fighting in the sinuses with the infections and so forth and so we're believing god for victory for nathan and shoshanna and for others who are also fighting that sister sharon has asked for prayer for jordan a 21 year old college student diagnosed with breast cancer that god would move and we know that the lord is more than able to heal and to deliver avian is at home today with an ear infection and we want to remember her and her family to the lord in prayer and steve who has come with jeannette quite a few times who really really nearly lost his life he was as close to death just about as close to death as you get with covid and uh he lost uh the the life in several toes during that infection and the battle that that uh went along with it and this week they removed those toes and he is in some pain and but his spirits are good and you know it's it's that's a hard thing to for me my thoughts are that it's a hard thing to go through but but they say he's had just a tremendous uh you know attitude and he said you know i've lost some toes but i got my life i'm living which is a miracle but would you hold him up to the lord in prayer sister pritchner in germany is not doing well at all with some digestive issues and we don't know what all that is but god knows and a lot of times we pray for her rather quietly or privately but she has reached out for prayer and she wants us to know and she wants us all to pray so that tells us that it's of a serious nature we know that god is able to move for her we love her very much and we want to see the lord's help i don't want to say too much about it on the stream today but there has been quite a battle this week in the hospital with brother stephen uh sister anita has really been in the battle and uh it's been ugly it's just been really really ugly and but god is helping them to overcome and you know i mean people don't understand they just don't understand how these things are and so they have been under the microscope and um god is helping them let's just say it that way and that that one of the doctors has kind of spoken for them and it has helped quite a bit his sugar levels unfortunately are are not good at all just really unstable and this can be a sign of different things and they are not sure which they're waiting for cultures to come back and even though he has had tremendous improvement so much so that he will go home under home health care and not under hospice you know that's that's pretty amazing and uh so that he can continue to get fluids and so forth and they're just scratching their heads you know they don't understand we know there's not been a t-total miracle but the improvement yet but there have been so many improvements that they just you know this doesn't fit it doesn't fit any any um textbook uh sent home to crossover situation there's anxiety there that that comes of course with these uh very severe sicknesses and so we want to hold them up to the lord in prayer and i've never mentioned this publicly but there's a lot of things going on in in the lives of those around them including sister anita's dad who she has prayed for for many many many many many years and he is he is responding to this in a very unusual and positive way with a heart turned toward god which has never been for many years and so we give god praise for that he knows what he's doing if you have a need or you know of an urgent need would you hold up your hand this morning let us see that god sees it and he knows what's underneath it and he knows what all is involved and again there are some missing this morning that i don't know why and where they are what's going on in their body but we know that god does and we know he's a healer and we want to believe that god will touch them right where they are would you stand to get today and sister joyce needs a mighty touch from god brother greeley as you could see and here needs a mighty touch from god but god's here and he's more than able to do it amen and i don't know who maybe had a prayer burden to pray for me long about friday but i sure needed it and god has moved for me and i am so thankful for what he did he surely came on the scene so if you happen to be one who had an extra prayer on friday or saturday for me i appreciate it sister tebow is passed she passed her breathing test which was something that was very important for her to pass so we want to thank god for that [Applause] she's going to require some pretty serious surgery where it looks like where they will take a piece of her lung and you know that just sounds awful and not pleasant and and there's a recovery but the problem is if she couldn't have passed that breath test it would have been very serious because they couldn't have done perhaps the surgery that needed to be done and there are some places there that have uh cancer and you nobody wants to think of that nobody wants to say that one form of cancer is better than another form but it really there are some that are a little better than others and if you're going to choose god help us that we never have to choose but if you if you had to have one she has uh the kind that they have found two small places one very small pinpoint size it's the kind that doesn't usually spread fast and so they're hoping and believing that they can go in and get it she's had a lot of peace she has testified of course there are moments of anxiousness when you're sitting there waiting for them to come in the room but she has done amazing and we want to give god praise for that sister flo also has some situations like that that are in god's hands don't know all the details but god knows all the details and i believe these ladies have some more shouting space i just believe god's going to do what he has to do to bring them through so i don't feel now i'm not in their shoes but i don't feel great alarm i don't feel great panic i feel peace i'm so thankful that if it has to be found i would like for it to go and never return and never have been found but i'm so glad that if it was there it needed to be found needed to be dealt with so pray for both of them that god will give them victory let's just bow our heads we don't have to have a song first let's just bow our heads father we thank you lord that in your hands is the best place to put all of our needs and all of our lives we lay that all right down in your hands believing lord that you've already been on the case we're we're behind we're just now letting it out or speaking out the need but you knew the need before it arrived in our lives and you were already working according to your will for your children so we stand near lord realizing and recognizing that in reality some of these needs are very serious and a bit grave but lord we thank you that one is just about the same as the other to you nothing stands before you lord that you can't deal with so we lift up every spoken need and every unspoken need god infection and inflammation and whatever else it's nothing for you sinusitis is nothing for you infections in the bronchial tubes and even covet and even cancer is nothing for you you're bigger than all of that so we look to you today and thank you lord for hearing this prayer let our faith be attached to you and we receive the blessing of your word we say with your stripes we were healed it is a finished work it is behind us today we celebrate the victory and the reality of that thank you for being with sister anita this has been a very difficult week for her she has certainly been under the gun but lord i thank you that you have strengthened her i thank you for helping our brother for how much victory you have given him for how far you have brought him and we give you all the praise and all the glory lord come today in your word and minister to us as only you can and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the church said you may be seated after you've given god praise come on one more valley one more here you know what key that would be hello there we go ogo's starting another key uh one more valley one more hill when i'm tossed on life c i thought that key sounded all right but i never got to when i'm tossed on live sea and the waves cover me and the dark clouds won't let the sun shine through there's a voice that seems to say child they'll be a brighter day don't allow the storm to hide sweet heaven's view cause you've got one more valley one more hill maybe one more trial one more tear one more curve in life's road maybe one more mile to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home listen don't let satan see your tears learn to smile through all your fears just hold your head up high give this world a smile try to be faithful all the way it will be worth it all someday for it's all gonna be over after a while you've got one more valley one more hill you've got one more trial one more tear one more curve in life's road maybe one more mile to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home listen again now don't let satan see your tears learn to smile through all your fears hold your head up high give this whole world to smile try to be faithful all the way it will be worth it all someday for it's all gonna be over after a while help me say cause you've got one more valley one more hill and you've got one more trial one more tear one more curve in life's road maybe one more mile to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home one more time now don't let satan see your tears you gotta learn to smile in all your fears hold your head up high give this whole world a smile [Music] try to be faithful all the way it will be worth it all someday for it's all gonna be over after a while and you've got one more valley one more hill look at it like that maybe one more trial one more tier one more curve in life's row maybe one more mile to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home sing the chorus again oh you've got one more valley one more hill you've got one more trial one more tier one more curve in life's road maybe one more mile to go you can lay down your heavy load when you get home yes you can lay down your heavy load when you get home [Music] it's a good way to look at it one at a time one more valley and if you end up with two you'll be all right because you're just looking at maybe one more tier and it'll all be over maybe one more battle and it'll all be behind us how many of you know it's good to let's live it minute by minute amen thank you for standing i want you to thank god for these musicians including sister wes today wonderful [Music] [Applause] i loved the worship singing today the anointing was here especially on that song that we sung at the end i love that song that was written by uh the crab family's dad gerald crabb and he knew what it meant to be in the fire he was pastoring a little church when he fell into depression and ended up an alcoholic he knew what it meant to fall in the fire he knew what it meant to try to take his own life he knew what it meant to lose his family for quite a bit of time quite a few years and he did lose his marriage through all of it and when he when god reached out to him and began to inspire him to write again he's one of the greatest songwriters of all times and if i started naming the songs that he's written you would know many many many of them that were made famous by other groups he just has a gift for songwriting but i like it when somebody can write from their own pain he never promised victories without fighting here's a man literally on his face at the bottom of the barrel he's so humiliated he said i was so humiliated there was not a person on the earth i wanted to see because i knew i had shamed and disappointed them all and god reached down and said gerald crabbe this was god's voice speaking to him gerald crabb i still love you he said i heard if i've ever heard god's voice i must have because he's given me many songs and sermons and so forth i thought it was all over including my life and i heard a voice say gerald crabbe god's voice say gerald crabb i still love you somebody asked him in an interview said what did you say back he said lord jesus i still love you if you love me i'll i never stop loving you i just got in a lot of trouble but if you'll help me and you know what he helped him through the fire he helped him through the storm he helped him fight until he could win the victory and now he's going and has been for many years again going strong for the lord those kind of songs speak to us how many of you have ever had your frustration get out of hand this was a man that knew what all that was about but god brought him through and i'm i appreciated that and i i enjoyed that song this morning because it was speaking to us at where where we are philippians chapter 2 and verse 5. we love you all we're glad to see you here on tuesday of this week brother donovan has a birthday sister jeanette has a birthday so we want to wel welcome welcome them we want to wish them a happy birthday and send our love to them and then on friday december the 10th is sister pam uh her birthday and we're so thankful to the lord for all of them and we don't get to see brother donovan or sister pam that often but we they're still a part of us they're part of this family and we want to lift them up to the lord not just on their birthday but always so we just send god's great blessings to them philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus that's a good verse first corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 if you'll turn there just one verse for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ and finally while you're still standing first peter chapter four verse one and two first peter chapter four verses one and two for as much then i want you to listen carefully to this one for as much then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he hath suffered in the flesh for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin i want to read it again for as much then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin the next verse that he no longer this is christ this is christ we're reading about christ that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god now i want to read both verses again i want to read them together without a pause for as much then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god we are reading about christ we're not reading as though you and i are the ones who must live the rest of the time in our flesh without or above the lust of men but to the will of god we're reading that christ is our example in this he suffered in the manner that he suffered that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god and because he overcame that's exactly what happened to him he died he suffered in the flesh which by the way doesn't just mean the physical body it also means earthly condition it's the same word so he suffered in earthly condition or in earthly existence and he did that it was necessary because he was god in the body of flesh it was necessary that he suffered the manner in which he did so that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god there was a glorious transformation that took place in the suffering of his flesh so that he would no longer have to live underneath the pressure or the pull of the lust of men but to the will of god and because he did you and i can also live victorious above the lusts of men and to totally surrender to the will of god if you understand that and believe it you can say amen father we thank you this morning that you are god's sovereign you are god's supreme and you are god good what a good god what a good papa what a good father you are you have equipped us by going before us as our example suffering in every way tempted in every way challenged in every way that man those who follow you would also be tested and tempted and in every manner that they would suffer not just the physical beating and crucifixion of your body but all that you experienced in earth's environment you saw jealousy and you saw resentment and you saw strife and you saw men vying for glory and position and you saw a tyrant you saw dictators you saw the occupation of the city that you loved so much you experienced all the pressures of political life you saw it all you experienced it all and you suffered in such a way that you would no longer have to live according to the lust of men but that you could live every day every hour every moment of your life according to the will of your father according to the will of god and you have made it possible today for your children to do the same o lord how we thank you for what you did for us how we thank you for the trail that you blazed for us and we ask that you help us in our time in your word today we give you honor and glory it's in the name above every name the name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah we pray and the church said amen you may be seated don't be too quiet there's enough of you here today that you can you can get something because you can pull you can put forth a little effort and god can speak to you if you have an ear to hear he can speak to your heart is that right so now i want to read first peter chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 in the amplified bible and i want you to see it slightly amplified so since christ suffered in the flesh for us for you arm yourselves i want you to say that with me arm yourselves that's the title of this message today arm yourselves with the same thought and purpose king james says arm yourselves with this likewise with the same mind the mind that christ had when he faced the sufferings of life the mind that christ had when he faced his everyday existence and all of it was not was not full of pleasure and delight there was suffering before gethsemane there was suffering before the cross his heart was crushed before his body was ever crushed he was weeping over jerusalem oh jerusalem jerusalem how oft i would have gathered you as a hen what are brood and you would not oh jerusalem thou that killeth the prophets all you scribes and pharisees who have whitened the outside of the sepulcher but have left the inside just a graveyard full of dead men's bones oh you generation of vipers must i go on his suffering for the righteousness of his father was not just in gethsemane and it was not just in the cross he suffered through his entire life remember we don't have a little miracle-working jesus as a child like the movie studios have portrayed him we have a boy that grew up rather ordinary we believe think about it he grew up rather ordinary we believe and the first time that we have a record of the supernatural breaking forth in his life he was already a grown man he was attending the wedding in cana of galilee and there was a need for more wine and he turned water into wine and blessed the day with his presence and with the supernatural manifestation of who he was even though he had not demonstrated his power before mary knew in her heart all along that one of these days his time was coming and he was going to manifest who he really was and the answer to the question that so many people make fun of the song this time of year i'm not going to make fun of the song mary did you know in its 30th anniversary year a lot of people make fun of it and they say of course she knew don't you know what luke says and how the angel of the lord came and told her who she was and what she was going to carry yes i've read luke haven't you but i can still tell you she didn't know it all oh no god didn't let her know it all there was a lot of it she wasn't going to know until she lived it until she experienced it i don't know if she knew how it was really going to cost her when she said be it unto me according to your word but she said it with all the faith that she had and that faith that caused her to say be it unto me according to thy word that carried her all the way from bethlehem to the foot of the cross when she saw the one she loved so much crushed in her presence she was able to go all the way because her faith said in god's time he's going to do it in god's timing he's going to let this and that in the other but i don't think that she knew exactly who he was i believe she knew that he came from god but i'm not sure she knew that he was god and somebody said how is that even possible i don't know ask your church friends ask the majority of church people today who believe that he came from god but they're not sure whether or not he is god well i want you to know he is god and all that the father was he poured into the sun and all that the son is he has made available and poured into his overcoming bride church if you believe that same man so there was a lot of suffering and a lot of struggle and he grew up with a sort of an ordinary life that's how god wanted it to be he disappointed his parents and he got royally chewed out because god wanted to know he wanted to understand what it feels like for a child to be uh sometimes unfairly accused and dealt with by a parent who didn't fully understand the situation so you could go through his life and there wouldn't be anything that he experienced there wouldn't be anything that he went through that that you wouldn't be able to say i've been through that or i know someone who has experienced something like that if he was going to be a high priest for all he had to be a high priest for all and if he was going to be a high priest for all he had to understand everything that anybody on this earth would ever face in their life and god allowed him to live sort of an ordinary childhood pleasing his parents sometime and disappointing his parents sometime and working around the shop with his uh earthly dad and i don't know what it was all like because the bible doesn't tell us what it was all like but there came a time the fullness of time when not only was he manifested into the earth but now he would rise and demonstrate all that he was sent forth to do and everything that jesus went through all the suffering not just the cross not just the whipping with the catalyned tails not just the vinegar and gall not just the crown of thorns on his head or the sword or spear in his side not just that but every difficulty that he experienced in his earthly life everything he suffered in the flesh because of the flesh because he lived in the environment of the earth everything he went through all of that was for a reason number one that he could be the greatest high priest the world is ever known and number two so that he could overcome first it was necessary that he overcome every temptation and every lust and every testing it was necessary that he overcome first so that he could get to a place where he was no longer vulnerable hear me please where he was no longer vulnerable to the lust of the flesh he was no longer vulnerable to the pools of the earth but he could now be totally completely surrendered to the will of his father this did not happen post-cross this happened pre-cross this didn't just happen in the garden of gethsemane which was before the cross but this happened every time he was tempted every time he was pressured with lusts with thoughts with lies you see if if jesus is going to suffer in all manner as we are and he's going to fight that lust battle and that thought battle that i want you to think about the fact that in him in his mind as he lived here on earth he was fighting a battle oh and and what was that about well for some it was rejection because it broke his heart to see how quickly some could reject what he was offering them just very religiously very arrogantly flippantly they could reject it because it didn't fit their particular thoughts about how messiah would come so they just rejected him very very quickly and mocked him and made fun of him there was a whole lot that went on and we don't know all about it but every time lust pulled every time a thought a negative thought a thought of rejection uh anything that you would go through in all manner all manner remember all manner every time he would deal with something like that he overcame and he overcame not just for himself he overcame for every one of us so that you and i post not post rapture pre-rapture so that you and i could overcome every bit of of lust and every bit of pull of the flesh and every unhealthy negative thought that the enemy would bring to our mind so that we could overcome every bit of that and be totally surrendered and submitted to the to the will of our father it was all for a purpose if jesus won the battle over the flesh he won the mind battle if he went all the way he won the mind battle if he made it through gethsemane he won the mind battle and so the mind that he now has is not a mind that is related to the things of the earth it is not a mind that is connected to the realm of the flesh but the mind that he now has is the mind of his father is that right he now has the mind of god so when he resurrected from the dead he didn't resurrect with the mind of a man he resurrected with the mind of god remember brother greeley sermon to us taking one of these verses and carrying it down who thought it not robbery to be equal to god he raised up not with a mind that had been polluted by the lusts and temptations and lying thoughts of the flesh but he resurrected with a mind that was so pure it was the mind of god undiluted mind of god uncontaminated mind of god he never had to pray another prayer and ask the father what his will was he never would stand again with a mind that was in conflict to the will of the father he won that battle every battle but this is an important battle because it tells us that the scripture says here we are to arm ourselves with the same mind we have been promised a way to overcome every battle every temptation every lust with every temptation he has promised to make a way of escape and the way of escape is a weapon and the weapon is the word but the weapon is not just the word the weapon is also the mind of christ and so the apostle said here arm yourselves likewise with the same mind whose mind the mind that christ had not a mind according to the flesh he won the victory over that mind but the mind of god the one that gave him the ability to totally surrender to the will of god and not any longer to the lust of men by the flesh are you following so since christ suffered in the flesh for us for you arm yourselves with the same thought and purpose patiently to suffer rather than fail to please god i want you to wake up now you don't have to say man but i don't want you sleeping in here this morning i want you to hear this because this is vitally important to overcome the hour we're living in and we've got to overcome we can't afford not to overcome we can't afford not to make it we've got to make it and we've got to make it with the victory that's promised to us because we're going to face some things we're we're facing things now and we're going to face some things don't you think that one or two is the only ones who'll ever get a diagnosis that would strike fear in your heart that you have to deal with listen before this thing is over as we live here many of us are going to face similar battles like this and we've got to know that if jesus christ could take on the will of his father and the mind of his father live with the mind of christ is the mind of god i can show you the the mind of christ is the mind of god and if he did that so that he would no longer be vulnerable to the lust of men but he would only be submitted to the will of god then you and i will find our victory in the same way our victory is the same way his victory has come so we read on for whosoever uh patiently to suffer listen patiently to suffer rather than fail to please god you may not be living the the life you would choose if you could have chosen but you are living a life that has been chosen and the end results of the life that has been chosen for you is that you would learn to patiently endure suffer which is not just having your body crucified it's so much more than that it's the it's the internal suffering it's the internal and emotional wounding that we go through as we fight this good fight it's all of it and every bit of it has a purpose and that is to teach us how to patiently endure suffering no matter how it comes to the flesh and we'd rather do that again and again and again and again and again than fail then are you listening then fail to please god if you fail to please god i'm preaching to you if you fail to please god you've lost it you've just lost it now i don't mean because we fail along the way we fail along the way and we better recognize when we do so that we can repent and come home and renew ourselves to papa we must do that but i want you to know at the end of this you've got to be a winner at the end of this you've got to be an overcomer at the end of this you cannot fail to please god you've got to know you've pleased him because this is the purpose of your birth to please god for whoever has suffered in the flesh having the mind of christ for whoever has suffered in the flesh having the mind of christ is done with intentional sin has stopped pleasing himself and the world and pleases god powerful next verse is that both verses no so that he can no longer spin the rest of his natural life living by his human appetites and desires but he lives for what god wills now the amplified takes what christ has done for us and puts the responsibility back on us as though verse 2 is only referring to you and i and not to christ but i want you to know he is referring first to christ winning the victory over the desires of the flesh and the lust of men and because he did i can and because he has i have in that right we know that by the word now this this thought arm yourself what are you arming yourself with what kind of weapon are we to take up in this hour when we know the battle is raging what kind of weapon will help us to win the victory over the lust and appetites of the flesh the desires of the flesh it is the word but how do we make the word personal we understand that the mind of christ is the word if you need the mind of christ you'll find it in the word if you have the word you have the mind of christ if you ignore the word that you have you'll continue to think with a natural mind but if you receive the word that has come to you particularly the message for your day if you will receive that into your life as an individual you can know by by all means without any shadow of a doubt that you are not warring with a flesh mind you are battling with the mind of christ arm yourselves with the same kind of mind that christ had when he overcome it all arm yourselves with the same kind of mind that christ had when he overcame it all it's a powerful promise now that word arm yourself it means to take up arms in the greek it means to make ready it means to equip it means to take up tools or weapons as in a militia so we're not just talking about hammers and nails arm yourself with hammers and nails we're talking about with the weapons of a militia now the weapons of a militia in the bible would be spears and swords and and catapults and whatever was available to them but in our way of thinking to arm yourself now would be with bullets and it would be as brother branham said atomic bombs and real nuclear warfare we're talking about the the most powerful and potent weapons that man could create and god is saying to us to have the mind of christ to fight with the mind of christ to arm yourselves with the mind of christ is to utilize the greatest weapon that anyone has ever used to overcome any situation including warfare in the natural so this is a real message to you and i take up arms we're not talking about that gun under your your pants or in your bag we're because i want you to know you can win every skirmish in the natural like that and lose the one that matters the most there's one battle that means a whole lot more than that come on now and what i don't understand is somebody who at the drop of a hat would take up a weapon to arm to protect their automobile but they won't use the weapons that have been given to us free you don't have to have a license to carry you don't have to go through a lot of red tape to have god has given us everything we need to win this mind battle he said just take up the same mind that christ took up utilize the mind of christ and you'll be able to deal with every lust of the flesh every lust of men all that comes against us in the flesh realm you'll be able to fight every bit of that it's the exact same word it's it's just one time removed i should say really it's just one time removed because how many of you know in greek like hebrew there's a root word and then you build on that root word and so you can look at the numbers and see the sequence of how they have built on that root word the next number the next greek number arm yourself is greek 3695 the next word that i'm going to mention to you is 3696. so it it's it's almost the same word in fact it's the same root it's not even a different root it's just one one more aspect just take it just a little bit further it's the word in second corinthians 10 4 that we've been reading over and over again for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of stronghold that word weapons is almost the exact same word as arm yourself so we're talking about uh weapons for battle weapons for war that word it means any instrument one uses to prepare to make ready an instrument designed to make ready for a military engagement so when peter says arm yourselves he means take up weapons and the weapon that he suggests is to have the same attitude that christ had to face your problems the same way christ faced his problem by leaning on his papa how are you going to get through what you're going through right now same way christ did by leaning on his daddy come on now how are you going to get through by leaning on your daddy and when you're right in the middle of the battle and you don't know how to win you're going to reach over and take up the arm you're going to take up the weapon you're going to take up whatever god has provided for us and you're going to use that to defeat the enemy and what is that well the amplified tells us that it is it is uh having the same thought and the same purpose that christ had to think like him to have an attitude like he had to have a mindset like he had arm yourself with that now in a message as i thought on my way chicago illinois i'm pushing through this because i want you to have some weapons as i thought on my way paragraph 35 it's wrong god's infinite let's see if we can find it this would be from last week's notes we're not in this week's yet hallelujah there you go it's wrong god's infinite and when he speaks it's got to be perfect he cannot change how many of you believe he cannot change we cannot alter god's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking so we need to discover how christ looked at suffering and we need to make sure that we're looking at suffering the same way he looked at suffering then we have armed ourself with his mind come on now how do you think he looked at suffering he kept his eyes on papa and he kept looking ahead knowing that at the end of this the glory that was going to be yours the glory that you were going to share with him the glory that i was going to share with him would be far more valuable than any few minutes of heartache or suffering or rejection or mental anguish or emotional distress or anxiety he kept his eye on the goal and the goal was many sons the goal was that many sons would come to the same glory that he knew he was coming to this was his desire so we arm ourselves by making sure that we approach our hardship like he did this is what peter's telling us we can't alter god's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking let the mind of christ be in you then you'll think like he thinks that's not just like a desire for the lost a burden for lost souls that's powerful and he loved the lost he gave himself for all mankind but this in context is we're looking at hardship at temptation we're looking at trials the same way he did knowing that these are just temporary bumps in the road i can just get through this hump one more valley one more hill one more heartache and then i got him for all eternity whoo if you're looking at 20 years of valleys ahead of you you're going to get washed out and discouraged but if you were to look at it like hey if i can get through the next valley whoa that might be the last one somebody said joe you're going to trick yourself you're going to try to fool yourself so you can keep the victory that's not it at all that's celebrating what god's doing for you right now so that you'll have strength to celebrate down the road somewhere hallelujah how many of you have ever had your feelings hurt maybe one more time i doubt it maybe one more time is all it'll ever have to happen and it'll never have to happen again the reality is one of these days that'll be it how many of you ever fought hard for your way and then got it and realized you'd been dumb you fought for your way then you got your way then you realized it wasn't worth the fight come on now you made a big mistake anybody ever been guilty you may have only one more of them whatever it is you know after you get a certain age you you kind of make a mental list of your aches and a new one is coming maybe that'll be the last one maybe one more on the list and there'll never be another one because the next body will not be subject to that kind of deterioration the next body is an eternal body that'll never waste or wear out aren't you thankful for that so you can't alter god's word to fit you you've got to alter your thinking to fit god's word let the mind of christ be in you then you'll think like he thinks can you say amen in the message el shaddai in yakima washington paragraph 14 when you come to total obedience then you can have possession period now that's what this scripture was about total obedience to the will of the father no more pulled by the lust of men no more tempted like men are tempted but finally overcoming and arming yourself with the same mind that christ used to defeat his enemy it's a powerful promise when you come to total obedience isn't that what the goal is how many of you would have total obedience as part of what you're pushing toward i want to hear him i want to obey him i want to be so quick to obey him there's no room for the enemy to give me a question come on now i don't even want to have to take time to say how high if he said jump just let me jump if i'm not jumping high enough let him tell me but let me be immediate and so quick and so ready to do what he says and the only way to get to that place is to be in a position that the lust of men are no longer working on us and pulling on us and the only way to get that kind of a victory is to arm ourselves with the thinking of christ and the thinking of christ said these things are just temporary i can get through this and we can get to the physical beating and say this beating will only last so long it has to come to an end but that's not all the suffering that he did that's only a portion of the suffering that he did he said you but but uh excuse me when you come to total obedience then you can have possession but until you totally obey you've got to completely surrender your own thoughts your own will your own mind and let the mind of christ operate in you you've got to face life the way he faced life you've got to look at life the way he looked at life you've got to look at suffering like he looked at suffering you've got to look at victories like he looked at victories it's all just a blip on the on the radar i'm just getting through this so i can get on to the next so that we can ultimately have eternity in his glorious presence all right let the mind of christ operate in you he said now do you think christ the mind of christ and you would say the days of miracles past do you think the mind of christ and you would say the bible is right in some places and not in others you think you wouldn't need to read something like that today but you do the mind of christ would sanction every word that christ ever said it's right so if you don't use your own mind just use his mind i want you to be able to put in their mindset attitude outlook i choose today to look at this like christ would look at it you say well he's never gone through this everything i preached that one time and a brother came up to me after the service i know right where i was preaching he said i know something that i've had to deal with that jesus never had to deal with i said will you please tell me what it is he said my mother-in-law i said well i don't know your mother-in-law he said well if you did you would know she was a strong-willed woman she is a strong-willed woman and i said okay then jesus may have never had a mother-in-law but i guarantee you he dealt with strong-willed women some of them followed him around and he had to deal with them just like you're having to deal with her so the circumstance may not be exactly the same but the battle [Applause] is the same and the way to win it is the same all right so so he goes on so you don't use your own mind just use his mind he said that's how visions at night time if i use my own mind how what could i do i i couldn't do nothing but just yield myself to him and then listen this is powerful oh but this was a prophet but just yield myself to him and then he uses my mind my eyes my mouth he's my all just yield that's the way you do it that's the way these ministers do it when they're preaching the gospel now did that sound like somebody who was putting that all in himself and not leaving it for any of us oh no he knew that every man that takes the gospel up does not see visions does not operate in that kind of a realm he knew that but he knew that in order for god to use them he had to use them the same way he used him they've got to get out of their mind they can't go by what they see lord have mercy is that ever the truth can't go by what they see can't go by what they'd like to say they just have to yield and that's not just for preachers he goes on they get up there and take a text why they just start off to preach yield themselves to god they're ministers the first thing you know the holy spirit maybe take them on another text take them somewhere else see brother branham talked about how we're being led and he he is using the context of ministry here but i want you to know it's the same for you on your job it's whatever in your dealings with your family and your situations to be able to surrender my mind to be able to surrender my eyes to be able to surrender my notes my agenda my plan and let god's plan be lived out in that powerful queen of sheba we're going to move quickly through these best best i can so there is genuine faith but you must come into the real channel of god to have that genuine faith there's human faith then there's faith of god and you must have a godly faith to believe remember we tried to compare faith in god and the faith of god and it's not a discussion that a lot of people want to follow but it's a powerful truth because there's a sixth sense and that sixth sense is not just having faith in god that's receiving a download of god's faith and it's going to be very very powerful and potent in the hour that we're living in i'm just sure of that you must have a godly faith to believe there's human faith and there's faith of god and you must have a godly faith to believe can i go on uh did you that are asleep is it okay if i go on two or just the awake ones let's go on now then to have godly faith you must have the mind of christ in you then that's how god projects to you visions revelations we don't all see visions but we all need revelations is that right and all these things comes by the mind of christ being in you you get it let the mind that was in christ be in you i don't want you to see the mind of christ as something that's sitting out here on the table and you're putting it on like a helmet or a hat i want you to see what it's full of the mind of christ is full of or the right attitude the right spirit the right way to handle problems in life the way to keep the victory when you feel like a cussing but instead you praise all these things that he went through i want you to see it that way then you can arm yourself with it anytime you choose to think like him then you're arming yourself with the mind that's higher than the mind you carry in the natural so you get it let the mind that was in christ be in you now the fundamental foundations for faith 1955 few more and then we're really gonna find find a good one here in just a minute they're all good to me i don't normally choose my quotes until sunday morning i've laid my message out i know the scriptures that i'm going to go to i know if i'm going to pick up something from last week but i make sure on sunday morning to get up early enough to go through and read all the quotes that i've laid aside to try to find the mind of the lord for the ones that we should read in a particular service and i want you to know i'm not sure that's the best policy because when i start going through them i get excited oh my goodness i can't leave that out i can't leave that out and then sometime i think i'm going to trim that down i don't have to have all that paragraph because i'm just wanting to emphasize a couple of sentences there and i thought okay now let me trim that down i'll i'll put the dot dot i'll let everybody know that's not the whole paragraph and i said now let me see where i can trim down and it becomes very very difficult to do that sometime he said now if we could throw ourselves completely to god here i am lord and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of christ be in us i'm going to look at this like christ would look at i'm going to face my suffering like christ faced his knowing that if he held on to papa papa would hold on to him and just let the mind of christ be in us them same operations of the spirit them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as the natural things does just the same thing how many of you like to have the operations of the spirit going on in your life not just the human emotions and the things that come with thinking of the natural mind because we were first created for that purpose here's your first purpose the purpose for which you were first created to control powerful isn't it to rule to praise god and to live for god there you are four of the original purposes that you were created for to control to rule to praise god and to live for god now jesus said if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you if you abide in me and my word abide in you now the father and his word is what you read it inseparable the father and his word is inseparable you can't divide the word from the father the eternal spirit of god because the word listen because the word is his son so you can't really divide the son from the word neither can you really divide the word from the father neither can you really divide the son from the father because father son and word father son word and spirit is the same no i love that now in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we're going on god and his word is inseparable you cannot have god without having his word and when you have his word um i don't know if i have his word or not do you have god if you've got god you've got his word if you've got his word you've got god if you've got the father you've got the son if you've got the son you've got the father come on now and if the son comes to live inside of you he brings the spirit because he is the same that doesn't mean that we don't have to experience him differently as in the baptism of the holy ghost but it is the same god the same word the same spirit is everybody still here oh it's early we might get through early might not now here's the one this morning that i thought oh my goodness i i i don't know where to start i don't know where to stop it's in a message from 1962 called the conflict between god and satan clarksville uh indiana paragraph 58. god look at all the look at all the highlight god knew this great warfare was coming on between right and wrong and he knew what the enemy was going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people let me tell you something this is so stacked there's never been another war quite like this one the your commander-in-chief knows everything there is to know about our enemy why he created him he knows everything there is to know about how he thinks how he moves what he's planned what's coming next and so when god chooses a weapon to give you are you with me when god chooses a weapon to give you to defeat your enemy it is exactly the weapon that you need because he knew what the enemy was going to do he know just exactly how to equip his people so if we notice the very first thing that god equipped his children was then he says being infinite he knowed what it took to defeat satan anytime anyplace anywhere on any conditions that covers it all you've never fought a battle that's not covered in that god knew this great warfare was coming on uh let's go on now he wouldn't say listen now i like this i like this he wouldn't say i'll give them somewhere here something here and then a few years later i may study out something better to give them this is god talking i'm going to give this to them now to fight the enemy with but i almost keep studying this and something better to give them and after a few years later let's go on like like we in military force the old bow and arrow and sledge and rock hammer and then the next after the bow and era come the musket and after the musket come the springfield and now the atomic weapon boy that was a jump but we're there now the atomic weapon weapons and things see we keep growing more we are constantly developing weapons to use against our enemy because we're not really sure who our enemy is going to be we don't know exactly what our enemy has we have intelligence and we have satellites and we have spies and we have information but we don't know exactly who our next battle is going to be against and what kind of weapons they're going to bring to the war so the united states must constantly be developing weapons to keep up with the technology to be able to fight against whatever the enemy uses but oh this is not the battle you and i fight because our god knew from the beginning every trick that the enemy would ever pull out against you and i and he has provided a weapon that we can arm ourselves with that will always be successful that will always be enough under any circumstance any place anytime anywhere isn't that the goodness of god to us it's the goodness of god but god at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon because he's he's the infinite god now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle god equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition didn't he right kind of an attack the right kind of everything that he had need of that would sweep them all the way listen everything you and i needed to be swept all the way from eden to the rapture you've never faced a battle that that weapon wasn't enough you will never face a battle that that weapon will not be enough from eden to the rapture what was it you tell me the word that's what defeats satan is the word it'll defeat him anywhere anyplace now why do we want to substitute something else when we've already got the best thing there is the word let's read on and we find jesus on earth listen just to prove this was the best equipment when satan come in hand-to-hand combat with jesus he never just reached over with his power and tied his hands he could have sure sure he could have he just took the same weapon that god gave in the garden of eden his word and said it's written it's written and he punched him right out of the ring he punched him right out of the ring with it that's right because it's god's best we keep reading and look where it is it's not just for one or two in a church oh yeah we're going to drag this out it's not for just one or two in a church oh that's all right for them that pray all the time oh that's all right for them that's all right for her that's all right for him it's not just for one or two in a church it's for every one of us every believer has a right every believer has a right every believer has a right to take his word and fight the enemy anywhere you meet him anywhere you meet the enemy this word is what you have to use and jesus proved it when he come can you say amen yes he did we're reading on so he equipped his children with the word for their protection against the enemy then when when the all-out warfare comes and the battles and set in array then there's only one thing a real soldier can use a real christian soldier there's only one thing a real christian soldier can use that's thus saith lord that's the mind of christ that's the word of god you believe that let's read on walk right out there and meet the enemy with the assurance that a thousand may fall at your right ten thousand at the left but it won't come nightly just remember that god made this statement and give this to his children and it's the best that's ever been yet now look at the last paragraph that we're going to use in this message in this from this message satan in eden when he first come to these attack to attack a person knowing the children of god was fortified with this word satan attacked the word see what the enemy is it's the word it's not you he's going to disarm us that's what he comes to do he's he's after the word he wants to stop the word he wants to cause you to misbelieve the word because he knows if you misbelieve your weapon if you don't trust your weapon you won't fight the good fight you'll cower in the corner somewhere and be defeated every time satan attacked the word see he never attacked the being he attacked the word first satan didn't come to attack eve he came to attack the word he had to win eve over she was the target but the word is what he attacked because if the enemy could cause her to doubt the word to reason against the word then the enemy knew he already had her in his pocket because she'll never be able to defeat any attack whatever comes against her if she doubts the word if she reasons against the word she'll never have what she needs to face the temptations and pressures and lusts of life the only reason that satan was able to persuade eve to accept his slant and to yield herself even her body to the enemy was that he was attacking the word he came against the word are you listening he came against the word first this is how he works in the message convinced and then concerned 62 paragraph 82 god to his army every nation tries to equip their army with the best they must do it to survive and god equipping his army being infinite know the best armor that there was and what did he do he gave his army we're not fortified behind denomination we're not fortified behind groups we're moving on we're fortified by the word of god and the devil knew that so he tried only now the spy the devil trying to find a way into that wall he might have tried pleasure he might have tried everything but you know where he got eve at tell me on reasonings he didn't just cause her to reason he caused her to reason against the word what man is going to go out into a battle carrying a weapon that he doesn't trust he's not going to risk his life to fight in a war with a weapon that he doesn't trust what the results will be so you've got to have the right weapon and you've got to have full confidence in that weapon if you're going to win against the enemy because it comes to reason against the mind are you still there two two places i want to read from spoken word is the original seed paragraph 3 58 he said notice what harmony if this sounds familiar to you you will find this almost verbatim in the church age book there are a few places in the church age book where you will find this much of a sermon verbatim but but you will find this this stands out pretty strong also in the church age book but here we're taking it right from brother branham's own words notice what harmony jesus never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 19. so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen then i got a great big hallelujah he said here is the secret that's worth listening to the word is in the bride come on come on come on come on the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word you've got the word and you've got the mind of christ to know what to do with the word and that is to use it against your enemy no matter what the battle is no matter what the situation is no matter what the circumstance is no matter how it makes you feel you have received the word the word of god is in the bride and the mind of christ to know how to handle what to do what needs to be done what he wants done with the word isn't that a powerful powerful and she does it we're going on now she does it in his name she has she has she has thus saith the lord this is the first sermon i ever heard brother branham preach spoken word is the original seed i remember hearing these two paragraphs today just like i did back then they caused something on the inside of the inside of me to leave then and it still did this morning when i read it before i brought it over here to you she does it in his name she has the sayeth the lord then it is germatized so the holy spirit waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose hallelujah isn't that good they do only his will amen i believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the lord or they keep still if you don't have the word on something be still if you can't put it in the word be still then they will do the works of god for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill praise god as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet do you understand this is where he leaves room for the bride's ministry don't you understand this is where he leaves room for the bride to move in the powers of god in the last of the last days jesus did not finish everything that he could have finished because some of that was for our time some of that was for our day and so it is for us to take up the word like he took up the word to take to arm ourselves with the mind of christ same sermon but a little bit further back in the sermon paragraph 2 27 so believers of the word and spirit must be won you get it believers the word and the spirit believers the word and the spirit are absolutely one these three are one believers the word and the spirit you hear that don't you are absolutely one you don't do your own thinking you don't do use your own mind isn't that wonderful the mind this mind or the mind was in christ is in you see the mind is in christ and you'll take the word just like he did because he was the word and the mind of christ in you you are the word now this is where brother branham says without a doubt the mind of christ is the word so if you take the word you're taking the mind of christ if you use the word to fight the enemy you're using the mind of christ to fight the enemy here it is in scripture here's what the bible has told us and now brother branham is pulling this together for us in such a way that we can understand they're not one and then the other it's one in the same and the mind of christ in you you are the word you're god's living word you are a word sent from god you're god's living word representatives of him here on earth that's right continuing the work the church should be that way god help us all the church should be that way and when so the bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like the disciple the bible is living again in you the bible is living again in you this is not for the future this is for today the bible is living again in you if you can claim that if you can believe that if you can give god praise then it is a reality okay just a little bit more i know you're tired of reading but it's just a little more paragraph 43 of why i'm against organized religion god has chosen moses and god had chosen aaron and it was the message of the day and no matter how good the other side looked it was contrary to god's thinking and we've got to let god's thinking be our thinking let the mind that was in christ be in you and there's the answer and this bible reveals are you with me and this bible reveals the mind of christ you don't ever have to guess what he's thinking you find the answer in the bible go to the bible first go to your absolute first the bible was brother branham's quote book he didn't get up and say like i said the other days a few times you hear him say like i was telling you the other day but that wasn't the most of his message was it he's just referring back to something he mentioned in a service but he didn't get up and say paragraph 68 uh of such and such a sermon last year i said so and so and so and so he didn't do that did he he took it right back to the word so go to the word don't be afraid to go to the word don't be afraid to go to the bible because the bible reveals the mind of christ now you want to take that to another level you go search that through the message of the hour because that's what god has given us to help us understand how to use the word how to use it effectively and really to tell us what the word is because the denominations never told us that that the believer had the father the word and the spirit living inside of them the denominations never told us that the mind of christ was the word and the word was the mind of christ to have one was to have the other and this is how we would fight in the last days so god sent a message to help us know how to use the word how to place the word that's why i said that in spoken words original seed we just read it and the whole book of revelation called the apocalypse is the revelation of jesus christ and we can see how he condemns the thing how he takes it to one side and we'll get to it after a bit all right and then he moves on thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy paragraph 86 and it'll still do it the word of god listen to this the word of god always attracts that spiritual mind because it is the mind of christ in you that knows that the word is true one last seventh seal this is why this is so important may i just pass this to you when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ you become so far away from your own thinking till in your own mind i this you i don't don't let me try to explain that because i can't see i couldn't do it there is nobody could do it and that's the end that's all he says on the subject when the supernatural comes in that's the mind of christ and it causes you to be so far away from your own thinking in your own mind you have no no doubt you have no room except to reach up and say i'm accepting that as my very own aren't you glad god has equipped us let's stand together musicians are coming aren't you glad you have everything you need to arm you yourself the average person i don't know if you're average or not but the average person has between fifty thousand and seventy 000 thoughts each day 50 000 to 70 000 thoughts each day and most of those thoughts are automatic let me say it again because i want you to hear me the average person has between fifty thousand and seventy thousand thoughts each day most of which are automatic now they're not all negative but they're automatic unfortunately we know the biggest portion of them are often negative these are 50 to 70 000 thoughts the biggest portion of those thoughts automatic meaning we didn't have to dig them up or pull them back from memory they're just there and they come automatically now what we what we do with them once they come to our mind through the forefront of our mind what we do with them is up to you and up to me we have to do something and do you know what you should know about those 50 to 70 000 thoughts most of them you had yesterday and most of the thoughts that you had yesterday you had the day before we're talking about the automatic thoughts i'm telling you those are the ones we have to sometimes go after because those are the ones that become our identity i'm not talking about remembering how to brush your teeth i'm talking about all the thoughts that the enemy just want everybody to be still just a minute i'm not quite through those are the ones that we sometimes have to stop and say whoa the reason why it's sometimes difficult to do that is because we didn't mean to think it we didn't ask to think it we thought it automatically we're never going to get rid of it automatically it's going to repeat itself over and over and over again until you make up your mind to refuse it like sister william's key i'm not going there now that in itself will not keep it from coming back tomorrow but it'll help you not to go down the long slippery slope of all the thoughts that are connected to that one if you'd want to come to a place where you don't have to keep thinking that same one over and over again you must replace it and in order to replace it you have to do that with the mind of christ or with the word of god one that says the very opposite find you a truth that says the very opposite of what you have been thinking about yourself and stand on that as your promise and do it tomorrow and do it the next day and the next day until you have rewired and replaced an automatic negative thought with an automatic positive thought automatic thoughts are not the enemy automatic negative thoughts are how many of you would like to get to a place where you have reworked some of your thinking come on now and instead of automatically thinking i can't you automatically think of course i can do all things through christ's truth of course i can what do you mean i can't do of course i can i can do all things through christ who strengthens me see i i let the enemy defeat me recently over something kind of funny something not vitally important kind of a play thing i let the enemy defeat me and i thought i wished i would have just done what i knew to do i can do all things through christ's strength all things not just important things necessary even fun things i can do all things through christ who strengthens me see you wire that in i want you to know this is the way we're going to overcome in this hour arm yourselves with the same mind that christ was armed with we can overcome we have the victory i heard an old old story how a savior came from glory and i heard about a wretch like me his healing and his cleansing power revealing just follow me then i repented sorry of my sin and one [Music] oh victory in jesus [Music] oh he sought me he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved the air [Music] hallelujah that's good oh it plunged me [Music] just

struggles and trials of lot that you did recognizing that they're just for a moment they've come to serve their purpose and everything we need to carry us from eden all the way to the rapture is in that word lord give us the grace to rise up in that word and with that word to defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime under any circumstance because this is our promise for today lord we

time around the altar where faith has been stirred lord i've seen some even their countenance changed as they reached up and took a hold of a promise and made it personal today and so lord right now we join our faith together and we ask you for the manifestation of every promise that's being claimed around this altar right now across this room and through the stream every person that's saying

hope and even after life we have hope because of your word and so lord we ask right now that you would come to his rescue and complete and finish the work lord whatever it is that you have purposed to do in that body for your glory the testimony that you have desired to have because of how you have touched him lord we want you to have that we want the lamb to receive the full reward for his sufferings and so lord we're asking you right now to let that be manifested in every prayer request that was made to you today lord we believe you we're not just listing them because they're in our minds we're calling them out because we know you alone have the answer now lord we press in and we take ground and we can't afford to lose any now you've been so merciful to us so good to us over this past month or so and we need you lord and we can't afford to lose any ground and so i'm asking o god that you would awaken our hearts that you would strengthen us lord to keep pressing this battle and

remember that you are the light of the world bless each family in each home that takes a moment to remember these things and lord as so many around us begin their christmas rush and hustle and bustle i i pray o god that you would be extra bright in your little bride that we would not get caught up in the uh in the clamor in that great confusion that follows this time of year but that we would stand strong lord against all paganism and that most of all we would utilize this time to be a light of your love and grace strengthen each family i pray lord to be strong in your word we leave here today in wonderful peace that's not afforded to us by our circumstances but it's given to us by our faith in your great name we love you lord touch these that are gathered with all of their needs
