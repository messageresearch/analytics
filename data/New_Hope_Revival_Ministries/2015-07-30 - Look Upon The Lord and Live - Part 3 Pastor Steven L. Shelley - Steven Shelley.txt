TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you foreign hello I'm Pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry and I want to welcome you to the program today and I trust that something will be said that will be a blessing to you in your life that's our reason for being here we're here just to be a blessing and an encouragement and I hope that we can teach you something perhaps even something that you didn't already know and if not then I would like to reinforce what you do know I'd like to help strengthen you in your foundation of faith I believe we're living in the end time and I believe we need the Fellowship of the brethren we need to be together with God's people as often as we possibly can but I recognize that some of you are separated you you don't have a place of fellowship and you need some encouragement and so that's what the Eagle's cry is about we want to give you a clear word a word that you can understand and we want to pray for you and so if you have not yet contacted our ministry please do so we would very much like to pray with you agree with you in prayer over all of your prayer requests and you can feel free to send them our contact information is given to you on the screen and uh write it down and and when you need to send in a prayer request please feel free to do so let's get into our study for this week this will be part three of a study that we have started okay we were in Exodus and we will begin in Exodus today as well in Exodus chapter 34. beginning uh in verse 33 and and 34 it talks about the veil that was over the face of Moses until Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him he took the veil off until he came out there was nothing between Moses and the Lord face to face and he came out and spake unto the children of Israel which he was commanded and so we talked about the veil we talked about the veil that is over the people of Israel even to this day when the Old Testament is read but we talked about the fact that there's coming a Great Awakening according to the scripture and God will reveal himself to his people so we're we're holding on to that promise and believing that it's going to happen and not only is it going to happen but we believe it's going to happen in our lifetime because we're living in the last days and so uh the the Bible also talks about veils in reference to flesh it talks about the veil of his flesh being rent uh speaking about the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and we also want to point out that sometimes our own flesh the desires of the flesh the will of the flesh can become a veil that separates us from our God and we want to come into a place where there is no separation we want to have that kind of communion that Adam had unhindered we sometimes refer to that as naked and not ashamed because Moses excuse me Adam and Eve were only covered by the glory the light of God they did not wear clothing to cover their nakedness but they were not ashamed because they were covered they didn't they didn't understand all of that understanding of of nakedness can came after they had sinned and so Moses walked with God not even thinking about the fact that that he needed to be covered up and of course we're talking about coming before God spiritually naked meaning we're not hiding anything from him he sees us already he already knows everything there is to know about us and so sometimes we come and in prayer even we pretend to be something that we're not and this is this is futile there's no reason to even even try to approach God that way just come as you are he loves you and he's drawing you in because he wants to have communion and fellowship with with him I was thinking about when I married my wife some 15 going on almost 16 years ago and I remember it like it was yesterday when she walked down the aisle the beautiful bride that she was and still is and but her face was veiled and she walked walked all the way down the aisle with a veil over her face until the vows were exchanged and when the vows were exchanged and we became one with one another in the sight of God and those who were there to witness that occasion then her veil was removed and I could see her face to face without anything and and when I when I kissed her there was nothing there was nothing between us and so God wants to remove the veils that are in our life so that we can come to him uh open and honest and with sincerity um and and let's not forget humble we need to approach God in humility because the Bible says he who humbleth himself under the mighty hand of God him will God exalt in due time so the way to to be lifted up the way to be elevated in the thing things of God is to is to Bow old to come before God in humility and and even in Contrition and just uh approach him in that manner and my God is nigh to them who are of a broken and a contrite heart he wants us to come before him sincerely now we think about Mo we think about Adam I keep saying Moses but we think about Adam in Genesis chapter 3 verses 8 through 10 and they heard the voice of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden see that that naked and unashamed sense that they had was gone now because of the sin that had taken place in the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself I wonder how many times Adam had heard the voice of God and instead of being afraid ran to the voice ran to God to have fellowship with him in the cool of the day but brother Sister Sin changes everything when you begin to listen to the lies of the enemy instead of the truth that comes from the word of God from the mouth of God that changes everything and it breaks Fellowship now I want you to know it didn't change who Adam was Adam was still a Son of God it did not change the relationship between he and God God was still the father Adam was still his son his created son but it changed the fellowship it changed the community Union that they had once had and I want you to know that God had a people on his mind before the foundation of the world and what we do now as that people it can change our fellowship it can change our communion but it does not change who we are if God saw us in his great foreknowledge making that great big Eternal yes then it's going to happen if it happened hasn't happened already it will happen because God will continue to draw and woo us until we have that opportunity to make that great big yes and so when one Falls away it doesn't change who they are it just changes the fellowship that they have and we pray for them that God will restore them and bring them back and you know what he will it's the promise of his word all that the father hath given me will come the Lord Jesus said and the prophet of the Old Testament said that God has inscribed us our names are inscribed in his hand he couldn't forget us even if he wanted to somebody said well wasn't that a promise to the nation of Israel yes of course it certainly was in context but we have been grafted in Jew and non-jew alike grafted in to make up the one new man that the newer Covenant has revealed to us that God is making a one new man he is calling a people out from among the Gentiles for his name's sake and bringing us grafting Us in bringing us in to fellowship and right relationship with him now God came down in the garden that day to meet with Adam and God knew what had happened with the serpent he knew the sin that had taken place in the garden but I want you to know that God did not come down to harm Adam he came down to comfort and to help Adam to bring direction to Adam how many of you know that love is corrective sometimes people seem to think that love is passive and and that love knows no correction and that love is tolerance and but I want you to know when you love somebody you want to spare them the heartache uh in fact if you've learned anything in your life and you love somebody you want to teach them what you've learned so that they don't have to go through the same heartbreak and the same grief and the same loss that you've gone through and that's just the that's just the goodness of wanting to help other people around you now the Bible said in Genesis chapter 3 verse 21 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothed them this is a beautiful uh beginning to something that we will come to understand later in scripture concerning the shedding of blood and what did what was required what had to take place in order for God to make clothes of skins to cover the nakedness of Adam and Eve uh well I think it's pretty obvious that animals had to die he couldn't remove coats of skin and the animal remain alive so God himself took these animals and took their lives killed these animals and ripped off their skins and made Adam and Eva covering for their nakedness and blood had to be shed and we see that in in Abel's sacrifice when he offered a lamb Cain brought turnips and potatoes and tomatoes and you can't get blood out of turnips it's only out of something that has life something that's living and has a heart beating and so we find that Abel took that little lamb that he loved so dearly and he slaughtered that lamb and in the process of slaughtering that lamb what happened to Abel he didn't have a sharp knife that we know of he must have picked up a jagged Rock and began to strike at the neck of that little lamb until the jugular vein was pierced and the blood began to spew and so what what happened was able became covered in the blood of the Lamb so we have the blood that was shed when God made the coats of skin for Adam and Eve now we have the blood that was shed when Abel offered the first offering to God covered by the blood and then in the Book of Leviticus we we see God giving us the instructions of how the people were to bring offerings and sacrifices to him and ultimately our Lord became the Passover Lamb the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross shed his blood so right here in the Garden of Eden there is this concept introduced that the shedding of blood is required to provide the covering for sin so God didn't come down to harm Adam and Eve in fact he came down to clothe them he came down to make provision for their need now how is that possible it's possible because God knew what Adam and Eve were going to do he is omniscient he has all knowledge what took place in the Garden of Eden did not catch God by surprise and he did not come down to harm but he came down to clothe and to make provision that's the God we serve now did they pay a price for their sin absolutely and you will too if you continue in sin rejecting the sacrifice rejecting the way of Salvation that has been so clearly made for us you will pay a price for sin remember when Jonah decided that he didn't want to go the way of the Lord he wanted to go in the opposite direction and so when it came time to go in the opposite direction the Bible said he he went down and made arrangements for this ship and there's a few little words in there that always stick with me it says he paid his own fare you may go against what God is calling you to do but it's going to cost you something if you catch a boat in the other direction you see what I'm saying if you don't surrender to God when he calls you uh you may you may get by for a while you may be allowed to continue and sin for a season after God has called you but I tell you right now it's going to cost you you're going to pay a price and it may be a an ultimate price it costs Jonah a pretty a horrific experience didn't it it placed him in the belly of a great fish in the depths of the sea the belly of hell for three days and three nights and when he got out of that belly of hell he was ready to do the will of God he paid a price why don't you if God is calling you if God is drawing you why don't you just go ahead and surrender why don't you just go ahead and say yes to the Lord why don't you quit running so hard in the opposite direction he's going going to find you he you know he's God I think it was David where where can I hide whither shall I go uh to get away from thy presence there is no place even if I made my bed in hell you would come and if if I if I hid in the Heights there is no hiding place and if God is drawing you you should consider yourself blessed you should consider yourself chosen among men because uh you may not understand it this way but you can't come to God when you get ready you know it's not it's not you just making up your mind one day I'm going to call on the Lord listen the reason why you come to the conclusion that you need to call on the Lord is because he's already calling for you you may not realize that until it's uh you know after you may you may come to the revelation after it's already happened but it's God calling you we we hear people say sometime I found the Lord no you didn't find the Lord the Lord was never lost you and I were the ones that were lost so who found who he found me and he didn't have to look very hard because he knew where I was all the time he's God and he loved me so much that he paid such a supreme price for my soul for my salvation now uh there's some interesting things we want to talk about here we talked about our flesh being a veil so we want we need to get that out of the way we need to surrender our mind our will our emotions so that we can come into sweet fellowship with God uh how many of you know when we talk about Canaan the promised land Crossing Chile Jordan uh it is uh perhaps an allegory it is a symbolism of of Crossing into rest Crossing into peace into fullness into completeness into maturity notice in Joshua chapter 3 verse 15 we're still talking about getting this flesh dealt with Joshua chapter 3 verse 15 and as they that bear the ark were come unto Jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overfloweth all his Banks all the time of harvest now I I found some little keys in this verse of scripture that speak to me it's Harvest Time and the children of Israel are about to cross over Jordan and how do they find Jordan at Harvest Time overflowing now Jordan is a spiritual type of death and it also represents the flesh and so uh I find it very interesting that the children of Israel were about to enter into their promised rest the Fulfillment the reality of their promises and what what what did they find they found Jordan overflowed they found the flesh swelling up and this is what's going to happen every time we are about to cross in to the reality and the Fulfillment of our promises when we start positioning ourselves to come into a deeper Revelation or into a deeper relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ the flesh is always going to rise up the Devil Himself is going to anoint our our flesh and it's going to rise up and we're going to have sometimes anger problems or jealousy issues or all kinds of issues that are related to striving and emulations and the works of the flesh that the Bible so clearly defines for us in the New Testament and you're going to find some things coming up and coming out of you that you thought you had long dealt with don't be discouraged the blood of Jesus is against every one of those issues that start coming to the surface and the reason why they're coming to the surface is because God wants to deal with them in your life he doesn't want to leave you bogged down with the works of the flesh no sir he wants to bring them to the surface and cut them off let the ax be laid to the root of the tree let those issues be dealt with once and for all and in order for that to happen they have to rise to the surface it's that Pleasant never is there any pleasure in it not much in fact it's an awful ugly feeling it's a sometimes we it it kind of throws us into a place of condemnation but I want you to know there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus so when that enemy starts trying to Heap the condemnation on again it's the Jordan's Banks overflowing at Harvest Time right before you would move into a place where you could receive your promise the enemy starts stirring up things to discourage you to accuse you the dirty rotten devil he is a liar and the father of all lies he was once before the Throne of God accusing us to God but now the Bible said he is loosed on Earth accusing the brother to the brother he'll stir up relationship issues and conflicts and uh he will do anything and everything he can because if he can start making you feel guilty for for that fleshly stuff that starts rising up you won't position yourself to go forward with God you'll start crawling in under the hole into a hole somewhere under the rug somewhere and feeling like you're lost and there's no hope for you that's a dirty lie you just let God continue to cause Jordan's Banks to overflow you let all of those issues be dealt with by the Holy Spirit put the word of God on them read what the word of God said with every Temptation the Lord will make a way of Escape nothing has touched you but such as is common to man you you are not going to be overcome unless you give up give up or give in and allow the enemy God has made a way you go down like the priest put your feet in the water and say I'm coming over I'm crossing over to the other side let the enemy howl let him lie let him accuse my eyes are not fixed on the water remember Peter remember how the Lord bid him to come to him and as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus friend he was walking on top of the water that's where I want to walk I want to walk on top of my circumstances I want to walk on top of those issues that the enemy tries to bring up in my soul to disqualify and to accuse me but when Peter started listening to the howling of the wind when Peter started looking around at his circumstances at the waves that were dashing up against his legs he began to do what sink he began to be overcome by the issues of his life and you know what Jesus just reached out his hand and Peter began to recognize I wonder how low he got before he began to recognize the key is to put your eyes on Jesus don't look at your circumstances don't look at what the enemy is trying to stir up in your flesh but look upon the Lord and live look to him and find life and find health and find happiness and find Deliverance because there has been a way consecrated on your behalf God has opened up a way what more can he do what more can he do than what he has already done so just remember flesh always swells up when we are approaching our promised rest but God has made a way of Escape I believe that God wants to bring such Revelation to his bride in this hour that every Veil I had a word from the Lord a few years ago where God said I'm about to remove every Veil that stands between my people and what I have promised for them what I have elected it for them to have to walk in you know God wants us walking in the fullness of what his word has promised for us and I had that word that he was going to remove the veils all that separates us from him will be removed and let's believe that that will happen and that it will happen quickly as we begin to just humble ourselves before the Lord let me pray for you I I get a little stirred up and then I I don't stay with my notes and then I look down and I don't know where I'm supposed to be but if that doesn't bother you then I won't let it bother me I want God to use my voice I want God to direct my thoughts and I want him to to inspire me with words for what you need at this present moment even if it doesn't fit an outline and even if it doesn't flow smoothly I want to be a voice he can use let's pray together father thank you for making a way of Escape 8 for each and every one of us first a way of Salvation and then you've made us a way of escape and you have provided the cleansing water of your word to wash us and prepare us for the future so I ask right now that you will touch the life of every person watching this program right now let the Holy Ghost of God course through their body through their life and make an impact on their situation right now God I pray for those who seemingly are almost to be overcome by the waves of the flesh by the howling of the wind I pray that you will send the spirit of an overcomer upon your people in this hour and that they will raise up in the might of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the power of the Holy Ghost bring healing to their sick bodies and draw their loved ones in I pray in the mighty name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen thank you for watching the Eagles cry I hope you'll tune in again I have lots more I want to share with you bye bye for now foreign
