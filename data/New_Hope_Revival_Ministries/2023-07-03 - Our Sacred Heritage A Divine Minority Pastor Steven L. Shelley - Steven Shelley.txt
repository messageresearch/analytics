[Music] going up to the high [Music] we're gonna tell the devil's Kingdom down let's give the Lord a shout of praise yes [Music] all right I think most of you just a minute I think most of you know that I don't have a lot of patience for being late to church I just really don't I've been going to church all my life and I've always found a way to be there on time somebody help me but I knew this morning at 222-2 22 minutes after two and then again at 55 minutes after five that's five five five that somebody was going to face a battle to get here this morning and when I see you dwindling in I realize that some of you not all of you some of you are consistently late you're going to be late for your funeral I hope so but I know there's a Warfare somebody has fought some stuff and uh when we were looking in the Monitor and sister Sharon was in jail or going after it before the service started somebody said they're on the war path that's exactly right that's exactly right the enemy doesn't want you to get anything out of this service today but you can determine what you take with you come on now I want to tell you a couple of things one is the wording of that song's a little strange to me because it's not talking about the city of God when it says going up to the high places it means going up to the land that's dedicated to the devil so if you're going to go into the devil's territory and take back what belongs to you you better be prayed up you better be prayed up you better have the right attitude in the right Spirit brother Branham told us it's better to have the wrong Doctrine and a right spirit than to have the right Doctrine and a wrong spirit so you better know that you've got everything under the blood if you're going to go to the devil's house and take back what belongs to you now that's not to strike fear in your heart because you ought to be able to go you we're going some of you are going just a minute ago but we ought to know who we are I was streaming the service last night from from the dedication Services of Happy Valley uh no longer called Happy Valley but uh you know where I mean and brother Ron we called him ronaldinh when he was growing up but his name now is Ron Spencer and and he's been fighting cancer now for several years and he just stopped writing his message he said do I look like somebody that's dying with cancer do I preach like somebody that's dying with cancer do I praise like somebody that's dying with cancer and he said this and I've heard him say it before and I'm gonna I'm Gonna Leave This with you because we're going right back to where we were just a second ago but he said I am not here to to argue with you about whether Muhammad Ali was the greatest fighter of all times but he said I will tell you something his trainer said his trainer said it is not my job to teach you how to fight he's looking at Muhammad Ali it is not my job it is not my responsibility to teach you how to fight you already know it's my responsibility to remind you who you are the greatest of all time it's my job to remind you that you're the one who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee come on now and so it's it's not our job this morning to teach you how to fight you've been fighting a long time you know how to fight the enemy you know how to come against him using the word but we want to remind you this morning of Who You Are and more importantly than that whose you are and nothing can stand before you if you're coming in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to defeat the enemy nothing can stand before you if you approach the high places with fear you will be defeated momentarily and your Victory flag will be broken handed back to you and you'll be sent back where you come from but if you know who you are and you know whose you are and you want to go today and take back something that belongs to you you can do it if you will [Applause] you can do it if you will so how many of you'll join with us we're going to sing that a little bit more how many of you got something that the enemy has stolen from your life sometimes it's your inheritance it's your heritage it can go either way but if you know the enemy has stolen something and you'd like to get it back today then here's the way to do it you dare dare go to the high places go with the blood of Jesus go with the word of God in your mouth go with the name of Jesus over your heart and you tell that enemy that he is the original kleptomaniac and that he has to give you back what belongs to you and not only does he have to give it back to you what he's stolen but he has to give it back with seven times on top of that because the thief is caught oh because the thief is caught in the act how many of you caught the devil stealing what was [Applause] going up to the high places we're going up to the high places we're going up to the high place keep going up to the high places we're going up to the high places [Music] down where

church now all morning already doesn't it it's his wonderful presence you can get a lot accomplished in a short amount of time if we just open our hearts and let him we're glad to see you in the house of the Lord this morning we have an unusual a number of people missing uh I dread summertime because during summer a lot of folks are moving in and out see Ben and Kendra are away and uh Jennifer Stark is away and brother and sister Greeley are away ministering to our former Amish Believers in Indiana and Ohio and maybe also at the Youth Camp who else who else is missing Benjamin and Jenna are missing RJ Emily and the kids are missing Ashley and David and sweet Annika are missing that's quite a few for one Sunday and look around we have visitors to make up for some of that isn't that wonderful sister Lily is so good to see you I know you came for Rebecca's birthday that is pretty special but I'm glad you got to stay for church too amen [Applause] praise God [Applause] I know Chad is particularly blessed this morning uh not only is it his was it his annual lead worship day he's a little rusty he said but I tell you he did a marvelous job I know he's particularly happy because that young woman sitting back there next to Jennifer is his mother sister Karen we're glad to see her in the house of the Lord this morning [Applause] I believe most everybody is supposed to be here this morning and we're glad you are uh sister uh sister Anita and brother Chris are with us we are very happy to see them haven't seen them since the wedding so we're just glad to see them they look wonderful sister Dorothy is here sister Anita's mother we're glad to see her today as well and they're not visitors but it's good to see nikishia sister nakisha and and Naya in church today and she Naya brought me some candy and a bag of what do you call them Cheetos now I'm telling you she wanted her pastor to have Cheetos and then something for my breath afterwards she just covered me all around and I appreciate that uh good to have you in the house of the Lord we're going to be dedicating those beautiful little twins after a while we trust you're not in a hurry we want the Lord to just come and do what he would do among us and have his way and this has been a week of trying to get back on schedule those three hours time difference this this time of year in Tucson three hours can make a difference when you're 55 and it has really made the difference and then last night was a night of prayer I don't know why Saturday nights have to be that way you know I think I think you ought to stay up on Saturday night and pray and let me be rested for Sunday but but God knows what he's doing he never makes a mistake he's always right on time got some things to mention to you this morning and musicians can just hang for a moment and we'll just see how it goes but sister Jeffrey gets to see her uh little granddaughters little twin granddaughters dedicated on her birthday sister Jeffrey's birthday is today and we want to say happy birthday to her [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and sister Elita is back from her Excursion with Sister Evelyn Fox they're just uh getting around like teenage girls they've been to Amish country and they went to see the ark and is it really as big as they say it is wow and uh today is sister elita's birthday I know how many but you'd never believe it if I told you so I won't even tell you Happy Birthday to Mimi excuse me sister Beverly's birthday is hard to forget it's the birthday of our nation she's not quite as old as our nation but she shares a birthday July the 4th God bless you Sister Beverly happy birthday [Applause] [Music] I don't think people who spend the week in Hawaii ought to even be mentioned over their birthday do you but Kendra has a birthday coming up this week on Wednesday the 5th and uh God really blessed them he did it's an unbelievable uh the turn of events is just God gets in things and gave them a a really an unbelievable 10-year anniversary vacation is that right was it 10 years and most people get that at about 35 or 40 a trip to Hawaii but I'm glad very very glad that they get to enjoy the beauty there and it's also one of our very faithful streamers birthdays on Wednesday the 5th Brother David Gossman so we send our love and greetings and happy birthday to you and Sister nakisha We're depending on you to take our love and birthday greetings home to your mom on Friday sister Audrey Lewis has a birthday so she's probably streaming But be sure to to let her know that we thought about her there will be no service here Tuesday night you're free to spend that time with your family we don't have anything planned here at the church uh on Tuesday but you you spend some time with your family and if you if you will take some time to thank God it's a broken Nation but it's the best Nation to live in with all of her faults and flaws and pimples and and and all the things wrong with her crooked nose and whatever else we're so thankful for the freedom that we have in America and it's because people fought and gave their lives and you know it's hard to believe where we are now when we think about the fact that the reason why we have a nation is because some people wanted freedom to worship God according to the dictates of their heart so you and I should take advantage of that blessing and of living in such a free place and uh and and enjoy and celebrate and be safe and we don't normally do that but I felt to do that this year and we will be back next Sunday if you are hungry for the word just go over to your sweet little phone and open the nhrm app and there are hundreds of hours hundreds of hours of sermons there all you have to do is is pick your pick your pick take your pick the sermon for the week uh coming out of Jeff for this week is the greatest battle ever fought and if you've never heard that sermon I strongly encourage you to hear it because that's where we are right now the greatest battle that's ever been fought is not Democrats and Republicans and Libertarians and uh and independents and all this kind of stuff it's not Putin and and his Antics it's it's if it's up here it's the battle of the mind and we win as the bride of Christ we win and so we want to uh to uh certainly take advantage of of what God is stored up for us would you continue to remember the Green family at the loss of Sister Green it made it all fresh again for us this week when uh July 1st comes it's Canada day so happy Canada Day to all of the Saints who are streaming in Canada but every July the first for a long time now I wake up and the first thing I think about is brother Perry green who was born in 1933 on July the 1st and brother Branham said to him one time he said now brother Perry that one in your name means that's July 1st that one in your name means that you are good at starting things and truly he passed away just short of his 50th year in the church that he started in Tucson and brother Branham was a happy man when brother green accepted the call of the Lord to leave Beaumont Texas he was a Borden milk man he owned a fleet of Borden milk trucks every time I see the cow anybody know Borden if you've if you've never drank board and chocolate milk you've never tasted chocolate milk and I think they've quit selling it around here someone told me around here you found some see brother Daniel after church he'll point you to the cow sometimes we're going down the road and we I we used to snap pictures of board and milk trucks and send them to Sister Green they mentioned at her funeral that when the call of the Lord came to Beaumont Texas to come to Tucson that they came in an old truck pulling an old trailer uh an old milk truck and a cow and I think a horse too and uh sister green said we look like The Beverly Hillbillies coming out of Texas I said was you sitting in a rocking chair and crocheting I was not but anyway we give God thanks for their life and for their Ministry and uh last Sunday just after her funeral the Tucson Tabernacle voted for the first time in seven years to have a pastor but they thought they would put him on a one-year trial basis and uh some of you met Young Daniel Evans and uh his dad uh brother Dan Evans who worked for so many years as Brother Joseph branham's right-hand man that the voice of God he was elected as the pastor of the Tucson Tabernacle and uh we're just happy that they have somebody that they can depend on in times like this I didn't mention Tuesday night but many of you were greeted by Saints in Tucson that know you so many said tell this one and tell that one and tell the other and time wouldn't allow us to do that but I I I've got some things I need to share there let's go ahead and thank God for the musicians uh we're just so appreciative we're so thankful [Applause] my wife and I are going to have a few days this week as empty nesters and uh I love my wife and I love spending time with her we had a wonderful time in Tucson but anybody that knows me knows I do not feel complete or at total peace when my kids are away so I don't mind to ask you again to pray for them that God will watch over them and keep them Benjamin and Jenna were due to be home tomorrow but they have extended until Thursday so that all of Jenna's family could be together and you know I can't I can't begrudge that because God gave us uh Jenna and they live in our yard so I can't really complain if they go home and and uh her precious grandfather brother asyler brother Gilbert jalbert brother jelbert sailor will turn 90 uh just around the corner and they're planning a get-together for him can you imagine 90 years and uh and strong and still still preaching the gospel and witnessing to to whoever will listen um I I I want to share this with you I think I'll do it before I read the scripture we are entering uh I mentioned Warfare this morning I mentioned the battle to get here for some of you I I mentioned uh praying particularly in times and seasons of spiritual transition and War and I know that there are still those that uh don't understand those kinds of things and I always feel bad for those who maybe don't understand but we have learned as a congregation now we've been together over 30 years and we have learned that these things matter and uh we've got to be be on our spiritual toes when we're called to pray we're entering this week a season of time that we have been watching now for for over 20 years um the Jewish people have been watching this period of time since uh about 19 I think it would have been I think it would have been the year 61. uh A.D the Jewish people call it CE Common Era so it goes all the way back to the year of 61 of the Common Era that there has been a unprecedented amount of trouble during a three-week period every year it is called many things it's called the three weeks it's called the Dire Straits it is also referred to as the season of the Basilisk the Basilisk was known in ancient mythologies and uh in ancient writings as the king of serpents and the Jewish people Mark the season of the Basilisk every year uh and they do it according to their calendar which is it begins on the 17th of the Hebrew month tamus and ends on the ninth of of and some of you might know that the temple was destroyed not once but twice on the ninth of of so there is a season of mourning that takes place uh during those three weeks it's crazy if you look at history it's crazy the amount of things that have taken place against Israel against the Jewish people during that three-week period because God has called us to be in alignment with Israel spiritually we have also experienced some pretty uh ugly stuff during that three-week period so we don't dread it in fear we prepare in the spirit hello I I don't know if you're listening or not we prepare in the spirit because we never know what the enemy uh would would plot Israel is in a particularly uh provocative season and she is being threatened as always but there has been a uh a shaking in the Serpent's tail so to speak uh recently with major threats against the nation of Israel so we want to pray for Israel we want to pray for the Jewish people and we want to pray for the bride of Christ for families because families are particularly attacked during this period of time for those of you who are note takers it begins this Thursday July the 6th and that is the 17th of tammuz on the Hebrew calendar and it goes from July the 6th to July the 27th which is a Thursday Thursday to Thursday and that that July the 27th is the ninth of of just let me give you this real quick uh on the 9th of well on the 17th of tammuz the day that the Dire Straits are the season of the Basilisk begins Moses it's recorded in the oral law that Moses smashed the tablets of the Torah uh at Mount Sinai not a very smart move if you know what I mean it was the day that daily sacrifices ceased we lead we read in history that apostomus burned a Torah scroll from the temple on the 17th of tammuz and Idol was erected in the temple that we read about in the Old Testament and it was the day that the Romans breached the city wall and that breaching of the walls of Jerusalem eventually led to the destruction of the temple and the destruction of the city how many of you remember that all right are you with me I'm going to preach in a moment then when we look at the ninth of of which would be uh corresponding with the 27th of July it starts in 1200 BC and it goes all the way up to modern history in 586 BC the Babylonian Army destroyed the Holy Temple in 70 A.D on the very same day Titus and the Roman army destroyed the temple in 1096 on the very same day the first Crusades began and when we say Crusades we don't mean Billy Graham salvation meetings we mean the crucifixion of the Jews the Crusaders marched into to Jerusalem and crucified Jewish people on Stakes leading all the way up to the Holy Hill of God in 1290 on the same day the Jews were expelled from England on 1306 the same day the Jews were expelled from France 1492 on the same day King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella signed the expulsion that would rid Spain of all the Jews in 1914 it was the Declaration of World War One took place on the ninth of off and on in 1942 on the ninth of of plans were signed that would call for the annihilation of Jews during World World War II and it goes on and on and on and on so let us be aware that we're entering a season where the enemy likes to shake his tail that O King of the serpents he likes to show himself but I want you to know there's a bride in this land who has authority over the enemy if you believe that same man I want to only say one more thing concerning this season and that is share with you two paragraphs of a dream that God gave me July the 19th of 2008. I had a dream and it was the first time that I ever saw this creature that has come to symbolize the three weeks or the weeks of dire strait the Basilisk he was slowly moving about as though stalking prey I then realized that he was moving toward a small wooden building and from the noise I heard coming from inside I realized that the building was sort of a chicken coop I then knew that the basket basilisk was going to steal the eggs and I saw that he would specifically suck the egg out of the shell I knew that I could sneak up on it from behind and perhaps deal a fatal blow I asked if this was what I should do but I was told by the spirit that I should not kill it because he listen now because he the Basilisk had not yet accomplished all that he was designed to accomplish but that I should drive the Basilisk away from the chicken coop so that he could not destroy the eggs does that make sense to anyone we have authority over him and every other demonic creature we have authority over the spirit of Sorrow we have authority over the Basilisk we have authority over every every Serpent and snake spiritually that likes to harass the bride of Christ I wish you were with me but I was said I was told don't kill it it hadn't yet finished what it was created for and we we get that don't we we get that because it took both Fishers and Hunters to drive Israel back as a nation to put the Jewish people back in the Homeland and we know that the the enemy is just a tool in the hand of God to perfect the Saints so sometimes we come against the tool when we ought to be praying that God protect us and help us have Grace to get through the trial or the Striking so uh I I should not drive him away from the chicken coop so that he could not destroy I should I should drive him away so that he could not destroy the eggs it is said that the mortal enemy of the Basilisk is a rooster God make me a rooster there's your Watchman God make you a rooster we need spiritual Watchmen Among Us who get the burden of the Lord is that right to help us know how to pray and when to pray I I get I get uh I I I I I I really get agitated sometime when I read the headlines that some Christians create you know it's amazing to me that two people can look at the same event or the same situation and report it so differently so I would say there is a fake news even in the church we need we need spiritual alertness we need some cock-a-doodle-doos I mean Among Us not just a preacher we need some cock-a-doodle-doo so say hey wake up cock-a-doodle-doo the Basilisk is trying to get in here and steal the egg and so I I've read I read that the roosters the mortal enemy thus explaining why he was stalking at night he didn't want to disturb the rooster and why he might be trying to eat the eggs now listen it's strategic if he eats the egg some of those this is what I was told in the dream some of those eggs are roosters some of them are chickens is this too much for you some of them I wonder I'm looking back I'm so glad that Brother David Shirley is here again today we've talked about him at my house almost all week and he didn't even know it and it was all good all good and and I said you think he'll start coming and Joshua said I don't know I think he might well we're very happy you're here again today and if everybody smiled as much as you do we'd have a happier Church I can tell you that right now for old friend of Nathan's and and also of brother Matt uh drost but anyway I can imagine what someone knew here is thinking about the preacher talking about basilisks and roosters and sucking eggs well if you don't get anything out of it get this you've never been to a church like this one good bad or ugly we're unique so I was shown in the dream that that that that basilisk was sneaking in at night and he was going to to suck out the life of the egg because he would be taking out some of his future threats Now isn't that just like the enemy he wanted to silence the roosters so I would say to you that during the season of the Basilisk this year watch and pray Watch and Pray make sure that nothing is able to come and steal your future victory everything comes to our lives in embryonic form everything God does in our family he starts doing it in embryonic form if the enemy can come in hear me if the enemy can come in and Destroy something before it comes to the birth then it's lost and if he can take out some of the roosters before they ever rise up to to sound the alarm then he has gained a victory in the stealth of the night but we say in the name of Jesus that our King is the victor and he's not King of serpents he's king of kings and Lord of the Lords and we decree that every devil every demon power must bow to the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ and we say the bride will thrive in this season of Dire Straits she will recognize who she is and get on the wall and sound the alarm in prayer we decree that in the holy name of our Lord let's stand yes Whoever thought in a church where we talk about eagles we would scream roosters arise Hallelujah oh oh my I can just see I can just see the Spurs just ready to take out the enemy come on whoa whoa Glory turned with me this morning to Joshua chapter this afternoon to Joshua chapter 24. we have 15 pages to cover and that means we have to go like lightning um let's see who can help me where is Joshua River here where is he let me see who can help me I just need somebody to hand some microphones around there he is Joshua uh take two of these microphones down and get ready because I'm going to need some help in a few minutes reading some scripture and I don't want anybody to do it that's not comfortable doing it I want Brothers for this and uh and I gotta go quick because I'll never get 15 pages in an hour if we don't go quick and but I want every one of these scriptures read so uh let's see whoever whoever some people are not comfortable reading out loud that's perfect Divine Elias do you read out loud give Elias a microphone would you no talking in the mic no preaching no testifying just read the scripture when it's time brother Shaw are you ready let him have one and and pass it back uh watch the sound very carefully when they're passing it back and uh and that's good Joshua thank you so much you don't know what's going on this morning do you Joshua chapter 24 beginning in verse one and two I'm going to read a few and then I'm going to ask others to help and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to shechem and called for the Elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God are you with me and Joshua said unto all the people thus saith the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in all time even Kara or Torah the father of Abraham and the father of nehor and they served other gods interesting they served other gods now drop down in Joshua chapter 24 to verse 13 and I'm going to read uh several more verses if you need to be seated you can and I have given you a land for which ye did not labor and cities which ye built not and you dwell in them of The Vineyards and Olive yards which you planted not do ye eat now therefore fear the lord hello and serve him in what sincerity and in truth and listen put away I want to emphasize that put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood you're you're on the other side of the flood now and you've got to live like somebody that survived and in Egypt and do what serve ye the Lord and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve isn't that good choose today whom you are going to serve whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me I can't answer for you hello I can't answer for your Bunch but for my bunch I'm gonna Hallelujah I'm going to answer for mine today for me and my house we will serve the Lord Hallelujah not half-heartedly not haphazardly not with compromise but with fervency and with dedication I want every husband every father in this house to read this with me but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord let's do it again but as for me and my house we will serve what about you mamas let's do it but as for me amen [Music] I had it in my notes here but I took time on the Basilisk but I had in my notes to open this sermon by re-emphasizing to you the importance and the power of the amen you know Sister Hattie right she learned the importance of the amen hers didn't sound like yours she said that ain't nothing but the truth brother Branham Hallelujah I don't care if you say that ain't nothing but the truth it may not be good English but it worked for Hattie right we cannot underestimate the power and the authority that comes when you sincerely say Amen to God's word it locks something you may be seated it locks something I heard brother Ronald Dean again I mentioned him already brother Ron Spencer preaching last night and I heard him retelling the story of the little blind girl that got a hold of brother Branham she got a hold of his tie she got a hold of the lapel and she began to tell what's going on with you and uh he's standing out and she said my my dad I heard this morning on the radio that the Healer was holding meetings here and I came to see the Healer and I've gotten separated from my daddy how many of you remember the story my daddy was here to help me try to get in to see if the Healer would pray for me but I've gotten separated from my daddy and I can't find him could you just help me find my daddy because I know my daddy will help me get to the Healer whoa and brother random said you really believe in that healing stuff she doesn't even know who she's holding on to she doesn't even know what she's got a hold of Hallelujah you really believe about healing stuff and she said sir I've tried everything else the doctors well he said well what about the doctor he said to the little girl they're fine doctors in the land now can't they have oh yes sir she said I've tried them and they can't do nothing for me hope I have is if a Healer will pray for me and brother Brian I'm just talking to her now not even telling her she has no idea she's got old finally finally she keeps saying to him if you'll just please sir help me find my daddy I gotta find my daddy because my daddy said he would do everything within his power to help me get through the Healer and brother random just looks down at the little girl he says I believe I'm the one you're looking for but I'm not the Healer come on I'm just here to cooperate with him I believe I believe I believe I'm the one you're looking for and God healed that little girl come on now he healed her because she got a hold of the Healer she wasn't gonna let him lose he tried to discourage her and she wouldn't turn loose of his clothes he realized if I leave her I'm gonna have to be taking her with me because she wouldn't turn Luke you ought to be just like that you ought to remember who you are today and you ought to get a hold of the Healer you ought to hear that song sung it's already done and your spirit ought to say Amen it's not just the amen that comes out of your mouth it's the one that comes out of the depths of your spirit that God is looking for Soviet [Applause] as for me and my we will serve the Lord whoa and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Eden I want you for a moment to get this sense of of nostalgia I want you to imagine that you are there and that Joshua has just said it's time to make the choice I want you to imagine that you heard the prophet of God say uh choose today whom you'll serve but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and as as the word of the Lord begins to come here out of these scriptures I want you to reminisce I want you to become very nostalgic and I want you to begin to reminisce and I want you to begin to rehearse the faithfulness of God to you in your past I'm not asking you to believe a God you don't know I'm asking you to put your trust in a God who has already proven himself to you time and time and time and time and time again you and I have absolutely nothing to lose somebody said well I got to protect my reputation I hate to tell you you ain't got one [Applause] there's people there are people already think you're crazy [Applause] you don't even have to post on Facebook you just get mixed up with this word you were labeled a cult before you ever started somebody said to me well that sounds like a cult well I don't know the biggest one I know of are the followers of Jesus Christ because they almost beat all the criteria that the world uses so somebody's going to think you're crazy remember in South Carolina when God told us to anoint rocks he said I'm gonna let you use these rocks as a point of contact this is the one I I didn't anoint this one way back then but this one says uh I see on it because this is the one that I anointed for the high season they took it home to Tucson with them and laid it on the front lawn of their property and instantaneously nearly by my Miracle God allowed that property to sell so that they could move here to serve the Lord with us but I just started using this in South Carolina as a point of contact my mother was getting more and more committed to the Lord and she wanted to move to South Carolina where God was moving in the church and her her work didn't want her to transfer and she needed a transfer she she couldn't just quit and start over she needed a transfer so she brought a rock and we anointed it with oil and we went to South Carolina and put it in the branch that told her there were no openings and we went to Columbus and put it at the branch that told her she would not be able to get a transfer and we waited about a week she got a call from Columbus that said I think we might can do a transfer and got a call from South Carolina and said we just had a teller job open would you like to have it see but people don't understand they don't understand per clause are you with me don't forget your amen it's a power of agreement we had gotten a little low because I had been giving out so many prayer cloths lately that brother Branham had prayed over and we had gotten a little bit low and I have a whole sheet and I I really didn't want to to use it just yet and we were out at sister greens look there's some green ones we were out at sister Green's house with Karen and Karen was giving my wife a sweater that sister green wore to every Harmony that I was ever in it with her and Stacy said I probably won't be able to wear that sweater sister green was about a two size two and she said I might not even be able to wear that sweater and I said well you take it and remember Sister Green and just remember I told it it more than she ever wore it because when we were taking care of her she'd say here Steve take my sweater and it was an honor I I loved it I I loved it I'm going to miss toting that black sweater around but my wife has it so if I ever need to tote it I can tote it again because she's got it when we were leaving the house brother Bobby wanted to see the red hat that he had given the family that brother Branham and brother green wore in the hunting trip to up on the Alaskan Highway and he wanted to see it the family wanted to hold on to it and he was okay with that but he wanted to see it and so she got it out for us to look at again and as we were going out the door she said I found some more prayer cloths would you like to have some to take home son if I keep giving them out this way I'm going to have to I'm going to have to go into my very reserved don't judge don't judge I can feel you you judgers don't ask me for one of these prayer clothes why do we have prayer called Miracles wrought by having a piece of the clove that belong to the apostles those prayer cloths that brother green got brother Branham to pray over the night before the morning of the accident it was really the morning of the accident brother green took those prayer calls to South America and remember the man took one and unraveled it and started swallowing it for an inoperable case of stomach cancer and God healed him not because there was healing in the cloth but there was faith that the same God who had moved before wouldn't move again amen and so when when they began to hear that we had anointed a rock they said well that's a cult that's not in the Bible you you can't anoint rocks and give them out and what kind of crazy cult is that and said in fact I heard that they got down on their knees and crawled around with a with rocks on there on their back and chanted the name of a dead man I said I've never heard of such an all my life first of all I've never crawled around on my back with raw my hands and knees with the rocks on my back chanting the name of anybody much less a dead man isn't it crazy how lies can be told there's a God in here who knows the truth there's a God in here who can turn on the lights I tell you I appreciate what Joshua said this morning he said I made up my mind I made a commitment that I was gonna do what God told me to do no matter how it felt no matter who it made in math I wasn't going to miss the Lord again we ought to everybody everyone have that kind of an attitude so I want you to be very variance we go over a few of these things as quickly as possible uh give me my verses back for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up out of our fathers excuse me up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the Lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the Lord this is their answer can I paraphrase that and tell you that they said he's never given us any reason to doubt and so we have no problem brother Joshua just declaring with you that as for us we'll serve the Lord too [Applause] I'm preaching this morning on our sacred heritage I'm subtitling it a Divine minority you didn't know who you were but you are a Divine minority and how many of you know when you are a Divine minority with God you become a majority the Old Church of God used to sing a song in their yearly song book they put out and then they'd have singspirations and people would go to learn the new songs that came out in the new song book every year and I remember that one year the song was one man and God can Triumph for a thousand one man and God put Satan on the run so be careful weary pilgrims stand up for God and see one man and God can win the victory you may feel like a minority but you're a Divine minority when you're holding on to God when he's the one you refuse to let go so he said we will also serve the Lord for he is our god let's move and Joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the Lord for he is Unholy God he is a jealous God somebody said well that's Old Testament so you no longer think he's jealous for you he is ain't no wall he won't climb up or kick down or whatever the words are come on now she's coming after me he's coming after me he's coming after me he's coming after me he's a jealous God he will he said now uh uh ye cannot serve the Lord for he is Unholy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the Lord and serve strange gods it's happening all around us people poking all these holes in their bodies and doing all these crazy things it's insanities loose in the world today it's paying homage to false gods you can't serve the god of Eternity and serve strange Gods at the same time you don't have to say Amen it's the truth anyway then he will turn you better read it or you won't believe it you want to know everything about his nature you got to know everything about his nature he's a jealous God you start out to serve him you better not pick up other gods along the way for if you do the same God who ran after you will run after you the same God that did you right he knows how to bring hurt he knows how to consume you somebody said that's not New Testament it's Bible [Music] and it's not to cause you to fear God it's to cause you to walk in the fear of the Lord which is reverential fear after that he hath done you good are you still with me and the people said unto Joshua and they no but we will serve the Lord so let's do this this morning I want everybody in here to know that if you get off the path you're gonna find some hurt if you get everybody look at me that can you decide that you're going to pick up sin you're going to live your own life instead of The Godly life the way of the Lord you're going to find out that it hurts it may take you years to get to the end of you but if you were ever his in the beginning he'll find you come on now he'll chase after you he will have you and even knowing that about him I want to know is there anybody in here that would answer the same way the children of Israel that day and say no we heard it all but we will serve the Lord can you say you'll serve him even if you know that you may find harm if you Stray From the Path can you trust God that he will not allow more on you will you trust that he is sovereign will you trust him like brother Branham said that God will put a harness and a bit on your trouble [Applause] he will restrain your troubles he will drive them like a man drives a chariot they will not overcome you they will not take you under they'll only bring you again and again and again and again to the foot of the cross can you trust a God Like That [Applause] you see this is where the church world has it so wrong because they're so upset with how God has been presented that they are presenting a God that's not even the god of the Bible when you hear people say God don't care how you dress and God don't care how you live and God don't care how you're baptized I want you to know that is a false god [Applause] that's not the god of the Bible the god of the Bible is very specific about how you conduct yourself how you live your life the god of the Bible is very specific about how you should be baptized in water not in the name of titles but in the Dame and yet knowing all that there is to know have you seen anybody suffer did you know Christians get cancer did you know Christians lose loved ones did you know Christians go through some heartache and high blood pressure and did you know Christians go through some stuff can you still serve a God that would allow that to come on your life knowing that he has not allowed it to destroy you he has allowed it to bring you to the end of you so that you can surrender and let him take over in your life come on now oh I got us I gotta I gotta I gotta go on nay but we will serve the Lord what's the next verse and Joshua said unto the people you're witness is against some light bulbs are going off I'm going to remind you of this when you tell me you can't hold on any longer I'm going to remind you of this day I'm going to tell you the God who brought you this far is the same God that'll take you to rapture [Applause] I'm going to remind you that when it looks like or feels like you're going down the last time there's a God in those waves there's a God that sits on top of the flood there's a God that rides the winds and the waves Hallelujah and he's cut into your rescue because that's who he is so we Are Witnesses against ourselves that we have chosen the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses let's say that we are witnesses that come hell or high water we are going to serve the god of the Bible we'll stand against the oppression of government or whatever we have to say we're going to serve the god of the Bible we're going to serve him according to the dictates of his word not just the feelings or impressions of our hearts now therefore put away the strange gods which are among you you can't sit in front of that idiot box and fill your mind full of the Slime and garbage of the world all week long and expect to step out of that and hear from God you're gonna have to watch what you led in the eye gate you're gonna have to watch what you led in the ear gate come on I believe a holy ghost-filled believer ought to be able to censor himself I believe a Holy Ghost Field believer ought to be able to know when he's when he's overboard when he's gone too far when he's spending more time with the world than he is the kingdom of God I believe we ought to be able to know it I believe we ought to have strength to do something about it I think for most people the best thing you can do is not have a television at all but if you're going to keep one on your phone you see that's what I'm saying you'll never be able to get out from under the influence of that stuff until you make up your mind I'm not going to let that contaminate my spirituality I'm not going to get my imagination so stirred by the world that I can't hear from the spirit I got to have a clear channel here so by the Holy Ghost we ought to be able to discern and know when we're going too far when we're crossing a line when we're meddling with things that that we shouldn't meddle with when we're playing with Strange Fire when we're serving strange gods you see there's a lot of people out there don't know that some of the things they do with their hair and some of the things they do with their bodies is giving homage to strange gods because nobody wants to tell them because most preachers know what will happen when you try to start setting people's lives in order talking to them about their ear Bobs and piercings and all the rest of this stuff you start saying something like that and when you know what will happen they'll be turned off the church you know and they won't come back and you've got to make sure that you're so it's better to ignore the fact that in their ignorance their serving and worshiping strange gods [Music] at some point you're going to have to make up your mind but as for me in my house [Music] is that too rough maybe you shouldn't preach that hard with visitors here I didn't know all of you was coming I wasn't sure who'd be here I didn't choose my message around you now therefore put away said he the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord our God will we serve and his voice will we obey who wants to say that out loud with me let's go back there it is the Lord Our God will we serve and his voice will we obey do you mean it so Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem and Joshua wrote these words in the book of The Law of God and took a great Stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord and Joshua said unto all the people behold this Stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the Lord the stone The Rock heard the words yeah isn't that what he said don't we now know that's the truth don't we now know that anything that had life has recording ability through sound through through light through vibration don't we now know that in fact if a device could be created or invented that we could release the sound out of this pulpit because as long as this wood was alive it was a recording device somebody said well what about the rock there's no life in that rock unless God touches it this is somebody said this is all metaphoric it is to a certain degree metaphoric but it's also a witness to us so that we will know that when we make these glorious confessions of how we're going to serve the Lord that the least we can do is not forget what we promised God for he had heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us this Stone it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god let's go on so Joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance is that what it says and they went and they went now I've got to give you one more judges too 7 through 12 and then I'm going to call on these brothers and the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of noon the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Harris in the Mount of Ephraim on the north side of the Hill gosh and also all their Generations were gathered under their fathers and their arose hello and there arose another generation after them if somebody doesn't preach it if somebody doesn't embrace it if somebody doesn't believe it if somebody doesn't hold on to it there will arise another generation after this one who will forsake the god of their fathers how many of you know it's already happening [Applause] so that should behoove you and I to hold on to God more not less he said and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel and the Elders of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served by El and they forsake the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt and followed other gods of the Gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the Lord to anger now now just real quick here what has happened a generation has passed that saw the works of the Lord that saw the Miracles well I don't like to go to church and hear you always talking about brother Branham let me tell you something the generation that saw that Ministry is leaving us swiftly if somebody doesn't remember who God was they'll never be able to know who God is you don't embrace the Now by rejecting the past you embrace the Now by building a foundation on that which has already happened the god of yesterday is the god of today and he will be the god of tomorrow if you believe that's amen we have a Divine heritage we have a Divine and sacred Heritage as a Divine minority in this hour now what did the generation of Joshua see well we talked about some Miracles we could have said in our day the last generation the generation of the Prophet they saw Miracles like that that little girl who grabbed a hold and said I just want to or the little black lady over there in in in Tennessee Holding On Believing God God would send to Parson to pray for her son who was dying of venereal disease hello so we rehearse of what we know that God has done not because we think that he can't still do but because we want to remember that he's the same yesterday and today and forever are you still with me so I want us to go real quick I want to remind you of what that generation of Joshua saw they were in Goshen first of all uh Elias are you ready Genesis 47 27 Genesis 47 27 brother Shaw Exodus 8 22. they'll put it up I think that's it even though the the site is not there that's that is it they won't have any way of knowing it if we don't remind them that is Genesis 47 27 stand up read it and Israel dwelts in the land of Egypt in the country of Goshen Goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly so the generation of Joshua leave it so the generation of Joshua found God's protective hand even though they were dwelling in the land of Egypt God gave them Grace in Goshen somebody say with me Grace in Goshen and though Egypt was under a terrible time and would eventually lead to all of the plagues God was taking care of his people where in Goshen because there's Grace where in Goshen and guess what they they grew and they multiplied exceedingly be seated Elias brother Shaw stand up if you will and read Exodus 8 22. and I was ever in that day the land of Goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of fly shall be there to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth amen Elias stand and read Exodus 9 26. only in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel were was there no hail no hail no flies plagues all around them but there was Grace in Goshen somebody say grace in Goshen the generation of Joshua saw that there was Grace in Goshen for the shaw read Exodus 10 21 and 20 through 23 21 22 23 Exodus 10. and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may Darkness may be Darkness over the land of Egypt and even darkness which maybe fell yes and Moses and Moses stretch forth his hand towards heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days yes they saw not one another neither Rose from Rose for any from his place for three days but but listen at this but but all all read it the children of Israel had light in their dwellings thank you brother receiving go shouldn't Grace somebody said I'm depending on Grace and Goshen I am I am I'm believing that if God can separate the children of Israel from the plagues he can separate his bride in this hour I won't put anything on you that you can't come on I won't put more on you than you are able to bear does anybody believe that who else wants to read brother Austin Hodges do you want to read Elias swap him brother Daniel Miller would you pass yours back uh I want you to I want you to read for me brother Austin Hodges Exodus 12 12 and 13. I'm doing it just like the Lord instructed me to do it so I thank you for your patience for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and we will and will smile and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both men and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are yes and where and when I see the blood I will pass over you yes and the plague shall not be upon shall not be a upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt thank you brother be seated come on come on [Applause] but we're reading it right out of the book God was taking care of his children even in the plagues didn't God bring you through aren't you here today because he did and then God let me tell you what else the generation of Joshua saw they saw a cloud by day and a fire by night brother Daniel read for us Exodus 13 21 and 22. and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to give them life to go by day and night that's right he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day yes nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people thank you brother that's what the generation of Joshua saw a god who's able to protect them from the heat of the day and guide them through the Darkness at night come on no under the generation of Joshua were believers we could just go back one generation ago and say they saw a man who could tell him the name of their doctors and turn his back and give them the address and tell them what was wrong with them and pronounce them healed that generation that generation saw Supernatural events and and an angel of the Lord writing a a drawing a diagram on the wall of the church and a supernatural Cloud vindicating that he was about to release a message to his bride and come on a pillar of fire hanging over a prophet's head and that's what the generation of William random saw no wonder they believed no wonder so many could Embrace in that hour all right Exodus 14 brother Austin Hodges uh I want you to read 19 through 22. this talks about the crossing of the Red Sea this is what the generation of Joshua saw in the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind now listen to that listen to that and the pillars look at that the angel of God that was leading them he removed from from leading them and look what he did he came right back here behind them then the prophet the Old Testament say he'd be our real word he doesn't just go before us he comes behind us [Applause] right okay brother and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them there it is and then came between the camp of the Egyptians in the kempt of Israel look look it separated them from their enemies yeah The God Who was leading them said wait a minute you've got some enemy here pursuing you so I'm going to come and come behind you and separate you from those who are pursuing you yes you you see there's an old basilisk come on there's no dragon there's no serpent that can cut you off the same Pillar of Fire that's leading you on can come behind you the same Cloud come on go ahead brother and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave life wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute foreign it was Darkness to them come on there he is Elias Darkness to them but what was he to the same cloud yes same Cloud it was Darkness to them go ahead brother but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night they're just chasing each other around yes sir the enemy never got close enough to touch them is that right yes is there more yeah there's more and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind that's right all of the night and made the sea dry land in the water water divided that's it and and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall a wall unto them can you imagine the fish swimming in the wall come on that's right the children of Israel looking in like an aquarium read on brother and the waters were a wall unto them to their right hand and on the left let's give God praise [Applause] brother Daniel no who was supposed to be yeah brother Daniel read Exodus 16 4 and 5 because they got hungry got hungry the generation of Joshua got hungry then saith the Lord unto Moses behold I will reign bread from heaven for you bread from heaven and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day biscuits from the sky that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no yes and it and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which is they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily look at that you're not supposed to gather on the Sabbath so supernaturally miraculously God's gonna come he keeps his own calendar he's going to come in on the sixth day and make sure that he gives enough so they don't have to be gathering on the Sabbath day supernaturally God does that when they tried to get ahead of God you know that didn't work did it they tried to gather more than they were going to need the Bible said it it uh uh it spoiled it stank and bred worms it rotted and created maggots hello now if you just do it God's way he'll give you all you need he'll provide for you if you'll trust him but you get smart and leave God out and leave your tithe out and leave your giving out and save it for yourself you'll never enjoy it the tax man will get it the mechanic will get it somebody will get it you won't have God's money and prosper that's right Austin one more read numbers 11 31 32 because some people get tired of biscuit I don't know what tired a biscuit and there went forth a win from the Lord and brought quails from the sea yeah because they murmured about the manna all the time man the man a man a man a man a man a man a man a man a man a man a man up for breakfast man of her we would sure like to have some meat God can handle that read on brother and let them fall by the camp as it were a Day's Journey on the side and as it were a Day's Journey on the other side around about the camp and as it were two qubits high upon the face of the Earth can you imagine God said you want me I'll give you me how much meat can you handle read on and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered lease gathered ten Hornet homers homers and they spent spread them all aboard for themselves abroad for themselves for themselves round about the king the one who gathered the least gathered ten Homer's fool they ate how many of you know they had them a party didn't they they ate so much they garged themselves on Quail until the Bible said it ran out their nostrils the Bible said it what it's not lunchtime that's a lot of quail that's a lot of sickness you can't use God enjoy the benefits of God and leave him out is that right brother Daniel you'll get one more read for me Exodus 17 and 6. I know it's late 124 by the way you don't have to look I'll look for you 124. behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in horrible and thou shall Smite The Rock and there shall come water out they got thirsty they needed some water and God could have let them down they're in the desert first of all God could have led him to a stream but God had a provided way he led them to a rock they're thirsty so what does God do he leads them to a rock then he gives him strategy sorry brother read on and there shall come water out of the Rock who's ever heard of such water out of the rock read on that the people may drink the people are going to drink the water that comes from the Rock and Moses did so in the sight of the Elder and that's exactly what he did now read for me before you sit down read numbers 20 and 8. I wished I had time to preach on this a little bit but I don't so take the rod take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so Thou shalt give the congregation and their I want you to look at that thank you brother pillar of cloud by day Pillar of Fire by night Passover go shouldn't Grace protecting his people Manna three times a day all the quail they wanted it was all you can eat meat Buffet then they needed water and God said I'll just give you water out of a rock so so God has the prophet to take his staff and smite The Rock which was Christ if you don't understand that you can read First Corinthians chapter 10 where it talks about that rock that followed them that rock was Christ it was out of Christ the symbol of Christ that the water flowed and you know brother Branham tells us something interesting about this we don't have time to preach about it but he said here here God has a a an updated plan they're they're thirsty again and God said this time I don't want you to Smite The Rock I want you to speak to the Rock Moses in his anger because of the people that he had to Pastor not making excuses for Moses but I feel you brother he said I'll show you how to get water out of the he struck it again and brother Branham said he threw the whole thing out of cater because the rock represented Christ and Christ was never to be smitten but once but what did God do God allowed water to flow anyway God did not embarrass the prophet in front of the people but I tell you what he did do he didn't let him have the inheritance he took him up on the top of Mount Nebo and said look at all of it I want you to see it all because this is as close as you're going to get to the promise you don't want to find yourself looking at a promise that you can't take an embrace come on now you don't want to let your anger your frustration your prejudices your bitternesses your jealousies your pettiness you don't want anything to disqualify your promise you don't want to be on the mountain looking at what you could have had anybody with me [Music] all right I can't read these I could read I could have another brother to read Exodus 15 22-26 when the water got bitter God had a way to purify the water generation of Joshua saw they saw the justice of God they saw the Earth open up and swallow the naysayers in Numbers chapter 16 verses 23 through 24. and what does God say to them who else will read for me I'm not quite done who else will read brother Joshua know who else I need one more brother Shirley there will read let's see if he reads as good as he smiles now this is a long one Joshua stand

Egypt to let him die in the wilderness he brought him out of Egypt to take him into the Promised Land God didn't bring you out of dark denominationalism to allow you to form a denomination around the truth he brought us out to take us in Hallelujah the Third Exodus leads us to the promised land if you believe that same man now listen now now we're almost to a place that we can come to an end in a moment but here's the thing you need to understand only one generation passed Joshua's generation so all these things Joshua's generation got all these instructions and the Next Generation arose somebody didn't remember they say remember what God has done remember how I brought you out remember how I fed you with the Manna remember how I gave you water from the rock remember remember remember remember remember remember remember because if we don't remember what do we do we forget and there arose a generation after Joshua who forgot we have a sacred heritage that we cannot forget God's been good to us as a bride people to bring us out of dark denominationalism to bring us to life brother surely psalm 106. 6 through 15 do not forget is the theme of this verse read it for us brother I'll try to show you the kindness of not interrupting you much wait a minute let's see what's going on with his mind there you go we have sinned without our fathers we have committed inequity we have done wickedly come on our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies come on but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea come on nevertheless he saved us he saved him for his name his name sake they should have all been destroyed it wasn't their goodness that got them through the Red Sea it was his goodness it wasn't their ability to obey that got him in good standing it was his Mercy his goodness now everyone should have drowned in the Red Sea if you and I got what we deserved if we got what was coming to us by our sloppy living we would have already been destroyed nevertheless read that one again nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known oh that's good he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the Wilderness same way he brought him through the Wilderness he brought him through the depths of the sea come on and he saved them from the hand of him that hated and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy oh that's good that's good that's good and the waters covered their enemies come on there was not one of them left what enemy what enemy what army what Pharaoh come on then believed they his words they sang his praise sang his praise they soon forget his words okay here we go hmm they're dancing on the red Seashore they're having a Pentecostal Jubilee the Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing they're having a great time wonderful Services wonderful praise when people first come out of denominationalism to follow this message the people were free the people were happy they rejoiced in their Newfound freedom but here's the problem read it brother they soon forget his Works they soon forgot his Works they waited not for his counsel but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert and he gave gave them their request but but sent leanness into their souls thank you brother thank you so much you can read for me anytime your voice is very soothing how many of you think you ought to do an audio book [Applause] they got leanness because they forgot we've got to remember Galatians 5 1 Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where the Christ made us free be not entangled again with the yoka bondage Hebrews 2 1. therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip Satan is after this generation he wants them to accept psychology intellectual conception instead of a living personal relationship with a living God a generation that does not recognize God will be enticed by other gods they become attractive to those who have never encountered God for themselves it is not enough to know the stories of God's past exploits they're carefully and lovingly preserved for us so that we can better recognize the attributes and characteristics of a personal God but we should know how he works and what he desires from his people it is them that we can adjust and make necessary steps to align our lives with his Divine will and purpose we have a generation alive now that have in many cases never had to depend on the Lord for their provision like generations of yesteryear can anybody say Amen to that they've had most things handed to them but the one thing that we as parents cannot just hand over to our children is our born-again experience every man woman boy or girl must come to a real born-again experience for themselves the new birth is as essential to this message as being able to recognize the messenger for this day in the in in the church age book Satan is the greatest sophist a philosopher one who is more concerned with superficial reasoning rather than using a sound argument he has never been overcome in the shrife of words you can't talk the devil you can't of men are usually heard more than the word of God each one Chatters as he pleases or kills Time by learn disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become partakers of the divine nature second Peter 1 4 scarcely anything is said this is more true today than in the years it was written of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding and only the power of losing remains I want to remind you that the church age book says almost lost the power and we're not talking about the church we're talking about the bride's Authority if you're with me say Amen now we're closing boy that was hard to get to this spot we won't be able to finish this I want the musicians to come we have some prayer that we need to offer and some sweet little babies that need to be dedicated I'm just looking for something I want to read you want do you need to stand up and stretch a moment if you do go ahead get any good you need to go to the washroom you can do that as well go right ahead it's not any later than it normally is 101. good charity I want to read what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 101 . now listen to this this is this is the closing as long as God has got a People God has got a church God has got the Holy Ghost marching with it do you believe that he said that's what God gave the Holy Ghost for intellectuals will rise always have but I want you to read that next phrase for me God has a minority God's got a little church that'll move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to claiming the lie and they'll be the ones that through their testimony will judge the world your testimony matters yes come on now we're not done yet your manner of Life matters the words that come out of your mouth matter the way you live your life matters you see God's got a little church that'll move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to claiming the lie and they'll be the ones that through their testimony will do what will judge the world powerful them that are first will be last them that are last will be first paragraph 102. I won't know nothing about sanky and Moody and their Resurrection they'll not know nothing about me and this one but I'll Stand in this one to give testimony so will you and through this that by the scattering of your light and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit and by the lives that you've lived and the things that God has done to prove that he's moving here and with their intellectuals walked away from it they'll be judged who by who then he said they're already judged they've already passed it oh my he said I'm talking on power of prayer power of speed power for a holy life some of you people walking along say well I just can't quit drinking I just can't quit this listen and how he explains what the Holy Ghost has come to do the Holy Ghost comes to live in you now this is going to offend somebody get ready the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these can'ts get away from you see I can't stop that I can't do that I can't live that life I can't make those choices but see when the Holy Ghost comes in he he gets all them cats away from you he said make women stop cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses make them quit tattling oh yes he said that's what it's for see this is what a lot of people misunderstand it's not to make you speak in tongues the Holy Ghost is to give you strength to live a holy life the Holy Ghost comes to live in you no excuses make them quit tally oh yeah it's to make you live a holy life it'll follow the instructions of the Bible anybody with me how many times every time we have a sacred heritage we must not forget what God's word has said we must hold on to the landmark is anybody with me I want you all to start playing something soft I I would like for you to play press on it won't be long if you can I'm going to give these folks time to come on back to their seats when they can because I don't want you to miss this last quotation it's a bit lengthy but it's it's it's the real climax for you if you'll take it we cannot let down now we cannot forget now what God did a generation ago come on now we've got to hold on to this with everything that is within us because the it all hell is against this message of Truth every demon in hell has been loosed against this little bride in these last hours and it is imperative that we stand charity I want to go to the rejected King paragraph 121. and I want you that will to listen carefully as they play something the other morning I was laying in my bed this is Brother Branham and I'd been asleep and I dream that Joseph was sick and I had picked him up to pray for him and when I woke up I was very upset I said well maybe Joseph is going to be sick a little bit louder on the music so I can hear you and I look going before me in a little dark shadow rather of a brownish color it seemed like it was me and I watched it and coming behind it was someone White and it was him I looked over to my wife see he's not asleep anymore he's in Vision now I looked over to my wife to see if she was awake that I could show her if she could see the vision but she was sleeping I said oh I'm sorry Lord but that's been my life you had to drive me to everything that I done can someone help me hear the music can someone Luke can you help me I said oh I'm sorry Lord but that's been my life you've had to drive me to everything that I've done every time anything would happen I'd think it was you doing it and I realized it was Satan trying to keep me away from it I said if you if you could only live me and as I looked I seen the prettiest face I ever saw on a man he was in front of me looking back he raised his hand and got a hold of mine and started moving this away the vision left me last Sunday morning I was had waken up early that was on Saturday this vision I've always worried I've always thought of dying at me being 50. my time is not didn't think was too long and I wondered what I would be in that theophany that Celestial body Stay With Me would it be that I would see my precious friends and say a little white fog going by and say there goes brother Neville or Hell or they or he couldn't say hello brother Branham and when Jesus come then I'd be man again I often thought that he's trying to imagine what eternity would be like I was dreaming that I was out west and was coming down through a little Sagebrush place and my wife was with me and we had been trout fishing and I opened up the gate and the skies were so pretty they didn't look like they do over the valley here they were blue in the pretty white clouds and I said to my wife I said we ought to been out here a long time ago honey for the children's sake we should have been Billy and I woke up this is a little confusing if unless you follow he thought I'm Dreaming so much I wonder why and I looked down down like laying by me and I raised up on my pillow as many of you people have done it put my head on the headboard of the bed and put my hands behind me and I was laying there like this and I said well I just wonder what it will be on the other side I'm already 50 and haven't done nothing yet if I could only do something to help the Lord now listen this is a man who had one of the greatest Ministries the world ever saw he's still feeling like he's accomplished nothing for the Lord and he's still embarrassed by the fact that anything he did ever do for the Lord the Lord had to drive him to do it so he's contemplating eternity here if I could only do something to help the Lord for I know I won't be mortal half of my time is gone at least or more than half if I live to be as old as my people still half my time is gone and I looked around this is powerful I hope you can hear it I was laying there fixing to get up it was about seven o'clock and I said I believe I'll go down to church this morning if I'm hoarse I'd like to hear Brother Neville preach and so I said are you awake honey and she was sleeping very soundly and I don't want you to miss this it has changed me I can't be the same brother Branham that I was and I looked and I heard something kept saying you're just starting press the battle just keep pressing I want to read that one again I heard something kept saying you're just you're just starting press the battle just keep pressing I shook my head a minute I thought well I I probably just me thinking like this you know a person can't get some imagination and I I said I just probably imagine that and it said press the battle keep going keep going I said maybe I said it I put my lips within my teeth and I put my hand over my mouth and there it came again just keep pressing Church I want you to hear this maybe you've been there or you felt like that everything you've ever done for the Lord he had to drive you to do it he had to push you to do it maybe you heard Joshua's testimony where he said I'm just not going to worry about it anymore I'm just going to do what he lays on my heart to do maybe you feel that way but you've been so discouraged some of us have forgotten what God has done for us already he said there it come again just keep pressing if you only knew what was at the end of the road seemed like I could hear Graham Snelling or somebody sang the song they sing it here I'm homesick in blue and I want to see Jesus I'd like to hear those sweet Harbor bells chime it would brighten my path and vanish all fears Lord let me look past the curtain of time you've heard it sang here at the church and I heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain I said it would help me so much just a glimpse just a glimpse beyond the curtain of time I looked in just a moment one breath had come into a little place that slanted I looked back and I was laying there on the bed this is a strange thing I said now I would not want you to repeat this this is before my church or the sheep that I'm pastoring whether it was I was in the body or not whether it was translation it wasn't like any Vision I'd ever had I could look out there and I could look here and when I hit that little place I never seen so many people come running and screaming oh our precious brother and I looked and young women maybe in their early 20s 18 to 20. they were throwing their arms around me and screaming our precious brother Here Comes young men and the Brilliance of Young Manhood their eyes glistening and looking like stars on a darker night their teeth as white as Pearl and they were screaming and grabbing me and screaming oh our precious brother and I stopped and I looked and I was young and I looked back at that old body laying there with my hands behind my head and I said I don't understand this and these young women throwing their arms around me now I do realize this is a mixed audience I say this with the sweetness and the melowness of the spirit man cannot put your arms around women without a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no an oyster day nor tomorrow they didn't get I never see sin all my life they had hair way down to their waistline long skirts to their feet they were just hugging me it wasn't a hug like even my own sister sitting there would hug me they were not kissing me and I was not kissing them I I I I haven't got the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it nowhere it was something that you just have to be there and I look this way in that way and they were coming by the thousands and I said I don't understand this it's gone here come hope that was my first wife remember the one who passed away she run and never said my husband she said my precious brother and when she hugged me there was another woman standing there that had hugged me and then hoped hugged this woman and each one and I thought oh this has to be something different I thought oh I I ever want to go back to that old carcass again I looked around then and I thought what is this and I looked real good and I can't understand this but hope seemed to be like a guest of honor she was no different but just like the guest a guest of honor and I Heard a Voice when they spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can interhear without it are you still listening I know you're tired I know you're tired I am more determined than and ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never end there mortality could never make you old they could not cry it was just one Joy oh my precious brother and they took me up and set me up on a great big high place I thought I'm not dreaming I'm looking back at my body laying there on the bed and they set me up here and I said oh I shouldn't sit up here and here comes women and men from both sides just in their Bloom of Youth screaming one woman was standing there screamed oh my precious brother oh we are so happy to see you here I said I don't understand this and then that voice it was speaking from above me said you know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people and I said yes I remember that well this is when you will gather with your people I said then they'll be real and I can feel them oh yes I said but there's Millions there's not that many branhams and the voice said they're not branhams they're your converts that's the ones you led to the Lord and said some of them women there that you think is so beautiful or better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord no wonder they're screaming our precious brother you see he's looking beyond the curtain of time and they screamed all at once if you hadn't went uh have went we wouldn't be here I looked around I thought well I I don't get it oh where is Jesus I want to see him so bad and they said now he's just a little higher right up that way someday he'll come to you you were sent for a leader and God will come and when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not we'll go in according to your teaching I said oh I'm so glad I did Paul does he have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this the answer was yes I said then then I preached every word that word that I never divided from it one side to the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too where they taught the baptism the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they taught I did too and then people screamed and said we know that and we know we're going with you someday back to the Earth said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached to us and then if you were accepted at that time which you will be then you will present us to him as trophies of your ministry you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever I said do I have to return back now yes read it but keep pressing on I looked and I could see the people as far as I could see still coming waiting wanting to hug me screaming our precious brother sent a voice said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given you here and I looked and here come my old dog you think that's silly come walking up here come a horse laid his head on my shoulder and nickered said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given them into your hand through your ministry and I felt myself move from that beautiful place and I looked around are you awake honey she was still asleep now I know that was extremely long to read this morning I thought oh god oh help me oh God never let me compromise with one word let me stay right

morning and that you will respond accordingly no matter what anyone asks you to do no matter what's going on if the holy spirit says no you have to back down yes you have to follow what he says to you

will serve the Lord oh God I thank you for the angels that have been assigned to guard and protect their Destiny oh [Music] I'm just feeling such a sense of of uh defeat for the enemy and I did not realize until this moment the huge assignment that Satan had against their little lives from the beginning God perhaps kept it from us so that we would move in faith and not fear but in this moment I'm just feeling a sense of overwhelming peace that our God has defeated Satan's uh uh strategy against them [Laughter] how do y'all do this minute minute by minute Grace Grace you people stretch your hand toward this family would you too all of them before Michael dedicates them stretch your hand toward grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins and Lord strengthen this family to serve you May

boy this is wonderful there's so much that could be said let's pray again Heavenly Father and all the times in my life I've thought about being a father I never imagined it'd be the two twin girls but this is your doing and it's marvelous yes and I do Marvel at it yes father you have brought together in these two two Trails of Faith yes one through their grandmother or great-grandmother who is here today one through my my great hand Pearl that I never knew but lived a life of faith but has come down to my grandmother to my mother and to me that's it I'm here today holding these girls because of the life she lived yes thank you Jesus when Jacob in the Bible was at the end of his life he said to his sons you know what I've lived for you know what I've stood for my girls here today are at the beginning of their lives they don't understand those things just yet but you Lord you know in all my faltering ways how I've tried to live and how I've tried to stand believing that you are the same yesterday today and forever yes I asked you write this upon my little girl's Hearts yes Lord let that seat of Faith would go into them and produce a harvest that would produce more than I can imagine so I can't even ask because I don't even want to set that kind of a limit right no limits but no matter how life May be difficult at times for them no matter how the enemy May rage I asked the Lord that they will always know that you are Jesus Christ yes the same yesterday today and forever that's right I dedicate them to you Lord yes Lord as gifts from you yes please father bless them keep them make your face shine upon them and be gracious to them may you always lift up your accountants upon them and give them peace and last of all father for their mother and I Lord we don't ask for riches or worldly things we ask for wisdom and strength from Heaven Jesus Times order we just don't know what to do about what you being Who You Are the same yesterday today and forever we need ever worry about that we live with all of our hearts Lord we thank you for this day amen Lord may they serve you in modesty in Holiness in righteousness that only you can provide we thank you for their lives turn around there Michael and the rest of the family would you turn around and let the congregation see these girls have a great chance don't they because they've got a loving family behind them praise God [Applause] praise the Lord [Applause] of all people [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord praise the Lord great Redemption [Music] Michael didn't really know the closeness of a loving father relationship so he learned to lean on Papa the one who never fails the true Daddy to all of us Michael has served the Lord with great commitment SS crystalline I'm not surprised that God would bless him this way we may look a little solemn but we feel great joy it's just the awesomeness of the moment that causes us just to take this in I I could say some things that you know might even be a little embarrassing but I'll try not to but I remember Michael sitting in my office wondering about his future his Destiny and God had crystalline picked out for Michael all the time I just wish we would have known it could have spared him a lot of hurt a lot of Heartache a lot a lot of waiting wondering and not sure but you know God has perfect impeccable timing just about when you're ready to think you know I've missed my chance God knows exactly what to do we give honor to the family and I didn't mean to not mention that what a blessing to have a great grandmother praying for you what a blessing and we would be amiss not to mention the fact that brother Steve Curry is looking over the balcony of heaven and he is so delighted nobody could be any happier than he he's already pretty happy these days but to know that that he has an inheritance and it's all about Redemption and it's a multiplication may it continue to grow father go with us today once again we thank you for this whole family and we just believe Lord that Mighty things are going to be accomplished through all of them For Your Glory Lord thank you for recommitments made today for those who have said I'll go
