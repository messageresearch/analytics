[0:00] he comes to help us to understand where
[0:02] our hope is
[0:04] where our help comes from where our
[0:06] strength is
[0:07] [Music]
[0:13] how many of you know the holy ghost is
[0:15] not the third member or third person
[0:18] of a godhead but he is another
[0:20] demonstration of the same god
[0:22] the same spirit so you couldn't have
[0:24] jesus the fullness of god in body
[0:27] on the earth and the spirit of god
[0:29] loosened the earth
[0:30] at the same time jesus said i have to go
[0:33] so that he can come
[0:34] but then he said in chapter 14 i will
[0:37] not leave you comfortless
[0:39] i will come to you he was identifying to
[0:42] them by revelation i'm not sending
[0:44] someone
[0:45] else even though he said i'll send you
[0:47] another comforter it was the spirit of
[0:49] the father
[0:50] that was living in him that was going to
[0:53] come back on the believer
[0:54] and be all the comfort that they would
[0:56] ever need i want you to know today
[0:58] jesus is the only comfort
[1:01] that lasts that's enduring
[1:05] that is eternal so the spirit of god in
[1:08] you
[1:08] is not to condemn you and make you feel
[1:10] hopeless
[1:11] the spirit of god in us by the baptism
[1:14] of the holy ghost
[1:15] is there to cause us to be convinced
[1:18] that we can't do it by ourself but if we
[1:21] lean on him and depend on this
[1:24] relationship we have with him
[1:26] we can overcome all things we can't make
[1:29] it without him
[1:31] you say well you know i'm not sure if i
[1:34] have the holy ghost you've got to know
[1:37] you must know i wish you'd help me
[1:39] preach this morning
[1:41] you must know that you have the baptism
[1:43] of the holy ghost
[1:44] hope so is not enough i wished i did i
[1:48] wish that this is not enough
[1:50] you've got to know that you know that
[1:52] you know that you know that you know
[1:54] because we're facing things now and what
[1:57] we're facing now
[1:58] it doesn't even begin to compare with
[2:00] what we will face
[2:02] we need the helper in us we need the
[2:05] advocate in
[2:06] us we need the one who comes to convince
[2:10] us and to convict us we need him living
[2:13] in
[2:13] us the work of the holy ghost is not
[2:15] finished when we come to christ
[2:17] when we come to the new birth and he
[2:19] first deals with our heart
[2:21] and we pray and cry and repent and we
[2:24] come to justification
[2:25] and then the water washes us by the word
[2:28] and we come to sanctification
[2:30] and then we receive the baptism of the
[2:32] holy ghost he feels so good
[2:35] he feels so good in our life he gives us
[2:38] joy he gives us fire he gives us peace
[2:41] but i want you to know his work is not
[2:43] finished he continues to remain in us
[2:46] to convince us to convict us to
[2:50] guide us to lead us to
[2:53] show us the way when he the spirit of
[2:56] truth is come
[2:57] not only into the world but into the
[2:59] bride when he come
[3:00] into us by the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:03] he is there to guide us
[3:05] he is there to lead us he is there to
[3:08] direct us into all truth
[3:09] he's there to nudge us when we look at
[3:12] the wrong thing
[3:14] he's there to nudge us when we say the
[3:16] wrong thing
[3:17] he's there to nudge us when we think the
[3:20] wrong thing
[3:21] and he doesn't do it with condemnation
[3:24] if
[3:24] if it fills you with guilt and
[3:26] condemnation
[3:27] it's a trick of the accuser it's not the
[3:30] work of the holy spirit
[3:31] the trick of the accuser is to condemn
[3:34] us and make us feel like there is no
[3:36] hope
[3:36] the work of the holy spirit in us is to
[3:39] remind
[3:40] us i will give you power over all the
[3:43] powers of the enemy
[3:44] because i overcame the world you can
[3:47] also overcome
[3:48] he comes to help us to understand where
[3:51] our hope is
[3:52] where our help comes from where our
[3:54] strength is i want to tell you today
[3:57] no matter where you are there's nothing
[3:59] that you are struggling with in this
[4:01] hour
[4:01] that the wonderful spirit of god can't
[4:04] give you help and grace to overcome
[4:06] but you've got to lean on the advocate
[4:09] you've got to lean on the comforter
[4:11] and if you don't have him living on the
[4:13] inside of you
[4:14] by the baptism of the holy ghost you're
[4:17] missing out
[4:18] if he's not on board how many of you are
[4:20] glad you know
[4:21] that the holy ghost is on board he's on
[4:26] board
[4:50] you
