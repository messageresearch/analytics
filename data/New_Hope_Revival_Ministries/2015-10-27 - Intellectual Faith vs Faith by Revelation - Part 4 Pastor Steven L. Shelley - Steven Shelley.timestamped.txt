[0:28] oh
[0:37] well praise the Lord you're watching the
[0:40] Eagles cry and I'm Pastor step Shelly I
[0:43] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[0:45] today we are studying the difference
[0:48] between intellectual faith and Faith by
[0:53] Revelation I want you to understand in
[0:55] this study that we are not against an
[0:59] intellectual or a mental concept of
[1:01] Faith because that's where it starts all
[1:04] of our faith starts with something we
[1:06] read something we hear and we just say I
[1:09] believe that we attach ourselves to that
[1:12] I believe that and I that is where we
[1:15] began many of you began that way in your
[1:18] journey because some of you were brought
[1:21] up in homes that were not Christian
[1:23] homes homes where other gods were
[1:26] worshiped and exonerated and yet somehow
[1:30] you read the gospel someone handed you a
[1:32] pamphlet or a track a book you saw
[1:36] Christian television like this great
[1:38] Network that you're watching right now
[1:41] somebody told you witnessed to you about
[1:44] the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:46] you said H that's right I believe that
[1:49] and that is the beginning of our faith
[1:51] so don't you think that I am saying that
[1:54] that mental concept of faith is is bad
[1:58] or wrong what I'm saying is it's not
[2:01] enough it's a good place to start I
[2:04] believe but let me tell you something
[2:06] when when your think so becomes a no so
[2:10] that can only happen by the power of the
[2:13] Holy Spirit the last time we were
[2:15] together we were reading about Peter I
[2:18] mean actually the last couple of times
[2:20] we were together we've been talking
[2:22] about Peter and we were reading the last
[2:25] time we were together in Acts chapter 2
[2:28] even after Peter denied his relationship
[2:31] with the Lord Jesus Christ went out and
[2:34] wept bitterly he never denied who Jesus
[2:37] was only who he was to him or who he was
[2:41] to the Lord Jesus that relationship
[2:44] between the two he denied that but he
[2:47] was there at shavo o in Acts chapter 2
[2:50] on the day of Pentecost and in verse
[2:53] four was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[2:56] then we started reading the verses where
[2:58] he stood up and I want you to know there
[3:00] was no Denial in him there was no shame
[3:02] in him that day he wasn't weeping
[3:04] bitterly with shame or denying that he
[3:07] knew the Lord on that day he was
[3:09] declaring with boldness this is Jesus
[3:13] this is the one that the scriptures have
[3:15] promised and Believe on him and you
[3:17] shall be saved repent acts 238 and be
[3:21] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:23] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[3:26] the Holy Ghost what gave Peter this
[3:29] transition this boldness this courage
[3:32] from being a denier to a testifier to a
[3:36] bold deliverer of the truth well it was
[3:39] the Holy Ghost that's what made the
[3:42] difference and that's what we need in
[3:44] our life we start with intellectual
[3:46] Faith but we need the spirit of God to
[3:49] Quicken it to make that belief Al alive
[3:54] to make it alive in us burning with with
[3:59] fire with passion when truth sets on
[4:03] fire you know it changes things it
[4:05] really does Jeremiah had this experience
[4:08] it's like fire shut up in my bones and
[4:12] in the old days uh of of the Pentecostal
[4:15] church I grew up in the old-timers would
[4:17] stand up and say I know that I know that
[4:20] I know that I know what did they mean
[4:22] they meant this is not just a casual
[4:25] belief system for me I am all in I know
[4:29] this is the truth and I'm willing to
[4:31] live by it and if necessary I'm willing
[4:34] to die by it now that can only come by
[4:36] Revelation not just the mental concept
[4:40] we also talked about the scripture in
[4:42] the Book of James chap 2: 19 that even
[4:45] the Devils even demons believe and
[4:47] tremble they know there's one God but
[4:50] that's just an intellectual kind of
[4:53] belief it's not enough that causes them
[4:55] to go on and do what acts
[4:57] 16331 said believe on the Lord Jesus
[5:01] Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy
[5:03] house so they they believe but not with
[5:07] the kind of faith is going to be
[5:09] necessary to stand the test of time
[5:12] quickly today I want to take you through
[5:14] a little study in the Book of John and
[5:17] show you how many people
[5:21] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ during
[5:24] his Earthly Ministry sometimes the
[5:27] church has slightly twisted the
[5:30] circumstances and made us believe that
[5:33] most Jewish people and the religious
[5:35] people of that day rejected the Lord now
[5:38] it's true that their eyes were veiled
[5:40] were blinded that they couldn't see the
[5:43] fullness that many would not see the
[5:45] fullness of who he was because God had a
[5:48] perfect plan he was to be crucified for
[5:52] the Salvation of not just the Jewish
[5:54] people but also of the Gentile Nations
[5:57] and in order to do so there had to be a
[5:59] partial blinding of their eyes but many
[6:02] were not blinded in the sense that the
[6:05] scripture said they believed and let's
[6:07] look at that quickly to kind of help
[6:09] give us a further understanding of what
[6:12] it means to believe uh and believe
[6:15] because there must be a little
[6:16] difference in there one must be
[6:18] intellectual believing and one must be
[6:21] Faith by Revelation look at John 223 now
[6:24] when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover
[6:27] in the feast day many believed in his
[6:30] name when they saw the Miracles which he
[6:33] did they saw the Miracles and they did
[6:36] what they believed that was John 2 John
[6:41] 7331 then they sought to take him but no
[6:43] man laid hands on him because this hour
[6:47] his hour was not yet come and many of
[6:50] the people believed on him and said when
[6:53] Christ cometh will he do more miracles
[6:56] than these which this man hath done many
[6:58] believed so we've got many believed and
[7:01] then now many many believed John
[7:05] 8331 and he spake these words many
[7:08] believed on him then said Jesus to those
[7:11] Jews which believed on him if you
[7:13] continue in my word then are ye my
[7:17] disciples indeed now the scripture said
[7:20] many of the Jews who heard Jesus
[7:22] speaking in John 8 believed on him but
[7:25] the key Jesus told them right here you
[7:27] need more than just to believe
[7:30] you've got to continue in my word you've
[7:33] got to have a deeper understanding of my
[7:35] word and that only comes by the Holy
[7:38] Spirit but now we've already got three
[7:40] verses in the Book of John many believed
[7:42] many many believed many many many
[7:44] believed John 10:41 and many resorted
[7:48] unto him and said John did no Miracle
[7:52] but all things that John spake of this
[7:54] man were true and many believed on him
[7:57] there look at how many minis we have and
[8:00] John 11 another one for verse 45 then
[8:03] many of the Jews which came to Mary and
[8:05] had seen the things which Jesus did
[8:07] believed on him so here's another many
[8:10] another multitude of people John 12 the
[8:14] next chapter and this talks about
[8:16] Lazarus much people of the Jews
[8:18] therefore knew that he was there and
[8:20] they came not for jesus' sake only but
[8:23] that they might see Lazarus also whom he
[8:25] had raised from the dead there's nothing
[8:27] like a living witness but the chief
[8:30] priests consulted that they might put
[8:32] Lazarus also to death here's some
[8:34] priests that wanted to kill Lazarus
[8:36] because that by reason of him many of
[8:38] the Jews went away and believed on Jesus
[8:41] many of them left and believed on Jesus
[8:45] on the next day much people that were
[8:46] come to the feast when they heard that
[8:48] Jesus was coming to Jerusalem took
[8:50] branches of palm trees and went forth to
[8:53] meet him and cried hosana blessed is the
[8:56] king of Israel that cometh in the name
[8:58] of the Lord
[9:00] multitudes many people John 12: 42
[9:04] further down nevertheless among the
[9:07] chief rulers also many believed on him
[9:10] but because of the Pharisees they did
[9:12] not confess him lest they should be put
[9:14] out of the synagogue for they loved the
[9:16] praise of men more than the praise of
[9:19] God see they had a belief system but it
[9:23] was not as strong as their desire to
[9:26] protect their own reputation now it was
[9:29] one believe right after another many
[9:31] believe many many believe many many it
[9:33] goes on and on and on so I don't want
[9:35] you to have this concept that only a
[9:37] handful of people
[9:39] believed many many believed that Jesus
[9:43] was the Messiah the problem is only as a
[9:48] mental concept it was not a revelation
[9:52] to them it had not been made real to
[9:54] them by the Holy Spirit and when these
[9:57] many people when these multi mudes of
[9:59] people saw him dying on the cross the
[10:03] most shameful and cursed death of all
[10:06] the very Foundation of their mental
[10:08] Faith was shaken and for most it totally
[10:12] eroded away when they saw his swollen
[10:16] lips and head blood either dried and
[10:19] crusted on his body and from a few
[10:22] places still oozing he's hanging there
[10:25] naked stripped of his garments when all
[10:28] of these things were going on on in
[10:29] Jerusalem the denial the Betrayal Faith
[10:33] being shaken questions being formed and
[10:36] uncertainty everywhere all of this going
[10:39] on but remember his resurrection was
[10:42] just a few days away things were about
[10:45] to change he was about to make himself a
[10:49] living reality and so when you look at
[10:53] Luke let's do that really quick I didn't
[10:55] know that I was going to go there but
[10:57] let's go really quick to Luke
[10:59] I want us to look at chapter
[11:04] 23 that's one of the gospels of course
[11:06] we were just reading in John let's go to
[11:10] the book before that and let's see what
[11:14] was happening now at the end of his life
[11:17] all the way through that's chapter 23
[11:20] beginning in verse
[11:26] 18 now this is the same many many many
[11:30] the same multitude of of people the same
[11:33] crowd that believed and now we have come
[11:37] down to the end and pilate has called
[11:40] together the chief priests and the
[11:42] rulers of the people and said to them
[11:45] you brought this man to me as one that
[11:48] perverteth the people and behold I
[11:50] having examined him before you verse 14
[11:54] have found no fault in this man touching
[11:57] those things whereof ye accuse him no
[12:00] nor yet Herod for I sent you to him and
[12:03] lo nothing worthy of death is done unto
[12:05] him I will therefore chastise him and
[12:08] release him for of necessity he must
[12:11] release one unto them at the feast and
[12:14] they cried out all the once saying away
[12:17] with this man and release unto us
[12:21] barabus where were the many many many
[12:23] many where was the multitude where were
[12:27] all of those people who believed D and
[12:30] now they answered away with this man
[12:32] verse 19 who for a certain sedition made
[12:36] in the city and for murderer was cast
[12:39] into prison this is talking about
[12:40] barabus Pilate therefore willing to
[12:43] release Jesus spake again to them but
[12:45] they cried saying crucify him crucify
[12:49] him and he even said unto them the third
[12:51] time why what evil hath he done I have
[12:55] found no cause for death in him I will
[12:57] therefore chastise him and let him go
[12:59] and they were instant with loud voices
[13:02] requiring that he might be crucified and
[13:04] the voices of them and of the chief
[13:06] priests prevailed and pilate gave
[13:09] sentence that it should be as they
[13:11] required and he released unto them him
[13:14] that for sedition and murder was cast
[13:17] into prison whom they had desired but he
[13:19] delivered Jesus to their will to be
[13:22] crucified see how fickle the crowds can
[13:25] be all a minute ago all through the book
[13:28] of John many believed many believe many
[13:31] believe many believe but when it came
[13:33] down to this very important test they
[13:37] responded crucify him because they
[13:40] weren't willing to pay the price of
[13:42] being identified with him in the end
[13:45] they didn't have a holy ghost revelation
[13:48] of who Jesus is was how important he was
[13:53] how he came to be a savior to be a
[13:55] deliverer and that's because many had
[13:58] moved around the crowd that day
[14:00] influencing people to choose barabus to
[14:03] as a substitute as another savior give
[14:06] us barabus we want him and many are
[14:09] making for themselves another Jesus
[14:11] choosing another route one who is more
[14:14] pleasing to the masses one who is not
[14:17] involved in their everyday life one who
[14:19] does not care how one lives their life
[14:22] how one behaves how one dresses in
[14:25] public some call this other Christ a
[14:27] more simpler Jesus
[14:29] they are reshaping and remolding him
[14:32] into a mental concept of what they
[14:35] desire him to be please don't change who
[14:38] Jesus is to suit your compromised life
[14:43] please don't change what the scripture
[14:45] teaches about unbelief and sin so that
[14:48] it fits more appropriately the life that
[14:51] you have chosen to live let God's word
[14:54] stand alone he is not changing himself
[14:58] to fit us we have to make changes in our
[15:01] life so that we can be joined to him in
[15:05] real intimate relationship and many of
[15:08] these things we learn in maturity as we
[15:10] press in as we make mistakes as we fail
[15:13] along the way and we pick ourselves up
[15:16] or he comes by the Holy Spirit and picks
[15:19] us up and we learn and we say I don't
[15:21] want to do that listen this salvation is
[15:24] not is it doesn't come to us in some
[15:26] automatic manner it was paid for with a
[15:29] precious precious Price look at
[15:31] Ephesians 2:8 with me for a moment for
[15:35] by grace are ye saved through faith and
[15:39] that not of ourselves it is the gift of
[15:42] God do you know even the faith that we
[15:46] use to truly believe in him to the place
[15:49] of Salvation is a gift he gave us the
[15:52] ability to believe many believe
[15:56] multitudes believe but not all the way
[15:59] to Salvation it is a gift of God it is
[16:03] by Grace it is through the holy spirit
[16:06] that you can really believe you know
[16:09] some people want to hold on to the
[16:11] option that Jesus may be real while
[16:14] praying to their other gods while
[16:16] following in their old traditions of of
[16:18] pagan and false religion but they're
[16:22] keeping the possibility that Jesus May
[16:24] really be a savior I want you to know
[16:27] that's only mental concept you have if
[16:29] you feel that way you're going to hold
[16:31] on in case there's something to this
[16:33] that's not going to be enough if
[16:35] persecution should ever come your way if
[16:38] you're ever on trial for your faith if
[16:41] you're ever in a place where you would
[16:43] have to deny you'll never have the
[16:45] strength to stand for Jesus unless
[16:48] you've received a revelation of who he
[16:50] really is that comes by the Holy Spirit
[16:53] and I I just encourage you you know to
[16:55] to call out to God for that it's very
[16:58] very important that we just ask the Lord
[17:00] to take our mental Faith what we what we
[17:03] think what we believe and take that to
[17:07] another level drive it down you know a
[17:10] friend of ours talks about when when
[17:12] truth moves from your head to your heart
[17:16] and then it doesn't stop there it goes
[17:18] out into our hands and feet what does
[17:20] that mean it means that when truth
[17:23] starts off as a thought in your mind
[17:25] then the Holy Spirit drives it down into
[17:28] your inner being into your spirit it
[17:30] becomes a revelation and what becomes a
[17:33] revelation becomes a lifestyle it
[17:36] becomes a part of your demonstration of
[17:39] faith and you you're not just telling
[17:41] people I believe you're showing people
[17:43] that you believe because the truth has
[17:47] or a truth has become to you the truth
[17:50] and you're you are uh walking in a
[17:53] revelation by the spirit of God it's
[17:57] it's you know I I often quote the
[17:59] scripture if that same spirit that
[18:02] raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[18:04] it shall also Quicken your mortal body
[18:08] and that's where we are we're in that
[18:10] place where we've got to have that
[18:11] quickening I I want to share with you a
[18:14] few a few things that have really
[18:16] blessed me down through the years I I
[18:19] mean I have really been blessed to
[18:22] understand uh what faith is and I'm
[18:24] going to be quoting from one of the
[18:26] great Giants of the faith and I I've
[18:29] mentioned uh William brandham Brother
[18:31] Branham I've mentioned him on this
[18:33] broadcast before a great man of God one
[18:36] who was used as a prophet of God uh one
[18:39] generation ago and I find so much
[18:42] strength and inspiration in his words
[18:44] even today and he's preaching about
[18:47] faith and he said what is faith faith is
[18:50] something that's revealed to you but it
[18:53] it is not yet but you believe it will be
[18:57] faith is a revel ation of the will of
[19:01] God that's the kind of Faith we're we're
[19:03] we're after the the scriptural Faith the
[19:06] the scriptural definition of faith in
[19:09] Hebrews is that faith is the substance
[19:11] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[19:15] Things Not Seen and that's what brother
[19:17] Brandon was telling the people there in
[19:20] this message he said it is a revelation
[19:23] of things that are not yet but you
[19:25] believe them anyway and then another
[19:28] thing uh from Brother brandom that's
[19:30] been a real blessing to me uh if any of
[19:33] you have heard his life story or read
[19:36] his life story you'll know that in his
[19:39] early days he lost his his first wife to
[19:43] death and his beautiful baby girl Sharon
[19:46] Rose there was a terrible flood in the
[19:49] Ohio river in the city where brother
[19:51] brandham lived near Jeffersonville
[19:53] Indiana and the flood did so much damage
[19:57] and uh lost lot of people died in the
[19:59] flood and lots of people died after the
[20:02] flood by the disease and uh pneumonia
[20:06] and so many other things that happened
[20:07] because of the living conditions that
[20:10] the people were left with in the flood
[20:12] and brother brandom tells this he's very
[20:15] transparent in one of his sermons and he
[20:18] talks about a day that he was standing
[20:20] by the grave of his wife and little
[20:23] Sharon Rose who was buried there with
[20:25] her mother and he's brokenhearted and he
[20:28] he's thinking about the years that he
[20:30] has given to God and the work that he's
[20:33] done for God and yet here lay his wife
[20:37] and beautiful uh baby girl and he's left
[20:41] with a a little baby boy to take care of
[20:43] on his own he's just
[20:45] heartbroken and he's standing there in
[20:47] silence and a man uh stops his car he
[20:51] sees brother brandom standing out in the
[20:53] cemetery and he stops his car and he
[20:56] pulls over and he comes there to where
[20:58] brother brandom is standing and he said
[21:00] Billy I sure feel sorry for you you've
[21:03] been through so much and brother brandom
[21:06] responds well that's all right uh uh you
[21:09] know I appreciate you saying so and he
[21:12] saw that I was weeping and he said I
[21:14] want to ask you something and of course
[21:17] he said go ahead and ask me he said I've
[21:19] seen you stand there in that pool pit
[21:22] giving out working so hard I thought
[21:23] you'd die I've seen you fast and you'd
[21:27] be so pey
[21:29] uh weak I would feel sorry for you in
[21:32] and out day and night constantly serving
[21:35] and now your wife and baby taken from
[21:38] you there what does Christ mean to you
[21:41] now you know that's a awful hard
[21:44] question to ask somebody in that moment
[21:47] what does Christ mean to you now and
[21:48] brother brandom answered thou the stream
[21:52] of all my comfort more than life to me
[21:57] whom have I on Earth beside thee are
[22:00] whom in heaven but thee he quoted the
[22:03] words to that great
[22:05] hymn he said I found the absolute that's
[22:09] something that held me when the storm
[22:12] was on and here's what I wanted to get
[22:14] to I like this very much this man said
[22:17] to him Billy did you keep your religion
[22:21] during that time of trouble you know
[22:24] people ask you sometime when they know
[22:26] you're going through something uh did
[22:28] you hold on to your religion and you
[22:30] know what he said he said
[22:32] no I didn't it kept me I didn't keep my
[22:37] religion My Religion kept me I think we
[22:41] could replace that word religion there
[22:43] because some people have put such a
[22:45] negative uh uh meaning to it by faith no
[22:48] I didn't just keep my faith but my faith
[22:51] kept me I want to ask you what kind of
[22:54] faith is that is that the belief like
[22:56] the Devils believed in tremble is that
[22:59] the belief like the multitudes many
[23:01] believe many believe many believe or is
[23:04] this Faith something stronger something
[23:06] a little deeper something a little more
[23:09] absolute than that I believe it is I
[23:12] believe the faith that brother Brandon
[23:13] was demonstrating in this place where he
[23:16] could stand by that grave losing the
[23:18] most precious thing to him in all the
[23:20] Earth and yet say you're you're the
[23:23] stream of all my comfort more than life
[23:26] to me who do I have on Earth I tell you
[23:29] what a great testimony and to be able to
[23:33] say that in a time like that when you're
[23:35] going through the darkest trial of your
[23:37] life I'm going to hold on to God and
[23:39] he's going to hold on to me it takes
[23:41] more than that mental uh concept of
[23:44] Faith doesn't it it takes Holy Spirit
[23:47] inspired revealed Faith because there
[23:50] are times in our life and here's what I
[23:52] wanted to get to before I leave you
[23:54] today there are times in our life when
[23:56] we are facing those dark dark storms and
[24:01] it seems that God is silent maybe you've
[24:04] never encountered that but I have you
[24:07] know God has spoken to me the Holy
[24:09] Spirit has dealt with me all my life
[24:12] since I was just a small child I had a
[24:15] my first spiritual encounter with the
[24:18] Lord when I was only 18 months old one
[24:21] year and a half and he met me in such a
[24:25] wonderful and profound way and then when
[24:28] I was three years old the Lord came to
[24:30] me in a visitation and called me and
[24:33] told me what my life would be and how I
[24:36] would serve him and of course uh uh then
[24:40] I've served him all my life when I was
[24:42] seven years old he baptized me with the
[24:45] Holy Ghost now I've had some hard times
[24:47] in life my parents divorced when I was 5
[24:50] years old my mother remarried and the
[24:53] man that she remarried beat her time and
[24:57] time and time again I grew up uh in the
[25:00] middle of the night to the sounds of my
[25:02] mother's screams where she was being
[25:04] beating beaten I feared for her life I
[25:08] did what only a little boy could do to
[25:10] try to stop it and these are things that
[25:13] I saw day after day after day so my life
[25:16] wasn't always easy I've not suffered
[25:18] like many of you folk have suffered but
[25:20] I had some difficult times and the Lord
[25:23] kept me in every one of those times but
[25:26] there have been moments in my my life
[25:28] when I needed God to speak to me and he
[25:31] was silent I couldn't hear from God I'd
[25:34] pray till I run out of words have you
[25:37] ever been there run out of words I
[25:39] didn't know anything else to say and I
[25:41] would listen to hear God's voice to feel
[25:44] him I would open up my Bible and expect
[25:47] him to show me something in his word and
[25:50] it looked like dead words on a dead page
[25:54] nothing I could feel no connection if
[25:57] you've ever been there you know like I
[25:59] do when God seems to be silent the devil
[26:03] has plenty to say Oh my he will lie he
[26:06] will accuse he will tell you there's no
[26:09] reason to hold on and that just really
[26:12] almost finishes you up and you have to
[26:15] reach way down inside of you to find
[26:18] some Revelation something that God has
[26:21] made real to you and you pull that up
[26:23] and that's what you use to start
[26:25] swinging at the enemy and so you keep
[26:28] holding on until you can hear God's
[26:30] voice again if you're going through a
[26:32] time like that the devil's talking all
[26:35] the time and God doesn't seem to be
[26:37] speaking reach down and find something
[26:39] in you that God has made real to you
[26:42] hold on to the Rock of Ages hold on to
[26:44] the lifeline let your anchor grip the
[26:48] solid rock don't you dare be moved in
[26:50] this hour I pray right now in the mighty
[26:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that your
[26:56] faith will be anointed that the holy
[26:59] spirit will pour down on your mental
[27:02] concept of belief and change it into a
[27:05] revelation that will stand the storms of
[27:08] life I pray your anchor will hit the
[27:10] solid rock and that you will rise up
[27:13] with courage and strength to believe God
[27:15] and to tell others that Jesus is your
[27:18] lord your master your savior father heal
[27:21] the sick according to the promise of
[27:24] your word in the wonderful name of the
[27:26] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen I
