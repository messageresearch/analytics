[0:00] sovereignty means to
[0:04] exercise Supreme and independent
[0:08] Authority we have a God who is
[0:11] independent of any other Force there's
[0:14] nothing he he doesn't have to confer
[0:18] with anyone or anything he doesn't have
[0:21] to ask anybody's permission to be God
[0:24] he's God and God Alone he once existed
[0:28] alone with his thought
[0:31] there was nothing to worship him so he
[0:34] began to create that which would worship
[0:37] him that which would glorify him and L
[0:42] him as God but he was in essence always
[0:48] God waiting on an opportunity a time a
[0:52] moment in the fullness of his time from
[0:55] eternity he would create first angels
[1:00] and Heavenly hosts that would glorify
[1:03] him and praise him and worship him and
[1:07] eventually Adam who was made both male
[1:10] and female in the beginning and God
[1:13] reached in and pulled the feminis or the
[1:16] female part out of Adam and made for
[1:19] Adam a bride she was found in him and he
[1:23] reached inside and pulled her out even
[1:27] spiritually you and I were created in
[1:31] Christ when he was created somebody said
[1:34] you mean Christ was created the Bible
[1:36] said he was the beginning of the
[1:38] creation of God he was God but in
[1:41] physical form he was a creation of God
[1:46] there is no Eternal sunship there is
[1:48] sunship but not Eternal sunship there
[1:51] had to be a moment of stepping down of
[1:54] condescending to come in the role as a
[1:57] son but don't misunderstand
[2:00] there are not two
[2:03] Gods we are not
[2:05] tuness there's one and he is as much God
[2:09] as the father was everything that was in
[2:13] Jehovah he poured into Jesus Yeshua the
[2:16] Sun and everything that was in the sun
[2:19] has been poured out upon the church the
[2:22] bride Church in these last days so
[2:26] sovereignty means to exercise Supreme
[2:29] and independent Authority we're talking
[2:31] today about a sovereign God for us and
[2:36] through us I can tell you this God
[2:39] doesn't Delight in suffering he doesn't
[2:42] get joy out of pain he doesn't sit there
[2:46] like some crazed lunatic you
[2:51] know I got you I zapped you look what I
[2:54] can do you may have found that kind of a
[2:57] villain in your Disney life
[3:00] but our God is not like that he doesn't
[3:04] find Delight in anyone's suffering
[3:06] although he allows all things
[3:12] yes for his
[3:15] purpose all things listen All Things
[3:18] serve God in order to manifest his
[3:24] sons the goal in this life is that there
[3:27] will be Sons manif ested in the end of
[3:32] this and yes there are pain there's pain
[3:36] and there's loss and there's suffering
[3:37] and there are innocent people caught up
[3:40] in the swell of some of these things but
[3:42] the ultimate goal of our creator is to
[3:45] manifest sons in the end time the Bible
[3:50] tells us watch this even sin evil and
[3:54] the fall will serve God's purposes till
[3:59] the end
[4:00] he is going to have sons to fellowship
[4:02] with throughout all eternity and he's
[4:03] going to bring them forth in this hour
[4:05] and he's going to squeeze them out we're
[4:08] coming out of this thing by being
[4:10] squeezed out of it your Comforts are
[4:14] going to be
[4:15] [Music]
[4:17] challenged and if you if you know that
[4:20] something's coming that's God and you
[4:22] don't like it you're
[4:25] human and so what you say is you come in
[4:27] into prayer and you say Lord I might not
[4:30] necessarily like what's coming down the
[4:32] river now I I I I I may not be real but
[4:36] I want you to help me not to get in your
[4:45] way he's a sovereign God for
[4:49] us and through us oh God I don't want to
[4:54] get in your way so help me I'm going to
[4:57] pray what I know is right I'm going to
[5:00] vote what I know is right I'm going to
[5:03] do what I know is right but in the end
[5:06] I'm going to praise
[5:08] you the Lord gives the Lord takes away
[5:11] blessed be the name of the Lord somebody
[5:13] said I just don't believe this kind of
[5:15] it doesn't matter what you believe what
[5:16] matters is what the word said you can't
[5:19] have it both ways I refuse to call
[5:22] myself a servant of a God who is less
[5:26] powerful than what he created
[5:31] he created the
[5:34] devil the Bible said he created evil for
[5:40] his
[5:42] purpose the Bible said he didn't just
[5:44] make
[5:46] light he made the darkness
[5:50] too and he uses it to turn people toward
[5:53] the light God uses Darkness to turn
[5:57] people toward the
[6:01] light he allows evil to turn people
[6:05] toward that which is right
[6:10] Hees he harnesses your problems your
[6:15] trials and uses them to bring you closer
[6:18] to him yes
