[0:00] if you won't let him be Lord of all he's
[0:02] not interested in being Lord at all he
[0:05] doesn't want half your heart maybe you
[0:08] think that's pickiness but he doesn't
[0:10] want half of you he doesn't want part of
[0:12] you he wants all of you he can't do much
[0:15] with half a head with half a body no no
[0:19] he needs a single-minded man I don't
[0:22] care how many rocks are being hurled
[0:24] your way how many arrows are being
[0:26] thrown at you how many vicious satanic
[0:29] lies are being cast your way you can't
[0:32] live another moment in that kind of
[0:34] place that's what pulls people to the
[0:37] edge you must not be double-minded you
[0:41] must let Jesus have
[0:44] preeminence in every situation look to
[0:49] him he's got it I see people who are
[0:52] under attack praising why because
[0:55] somebody here is winning the greatest
[0:58] battle ever fought
[1:00] minute by minute by minute by
[1:05] [Applause]
[1:08] minute not because we're superheroes or
[1:11] above humans but because we found the
[1:15] key the answer is in the
[1:17] word that he might have
[1:22] preeminence in all
[1:24] [Music]
[1:25] things Jesus was the pattern son
[1:33] somebody said well when they made him
[1:34] they broke the mold no no no no no God
[1:38] made him and recorded the
[1:41] mold because there must be many
[1:44] sons not many
[1:47] jesuses many
[1:49] sons all of creation granth yes
[1:54] sir
[1:55] travaileth for the manifestation of sons
[1:58] of God that's right who will rise up
[2:01] with some creative
[2:02] Authority if you're a true disciple of
[2:04] Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:06] washed and Sanctified by the word you've
[2:08] already been given the full endowment of
[2:10] power but you don't know what to do with
[2:13] it because it's only through sunship
[2:15] it's only through full adoption that we
[2:17] begin to understand the authority that's
[2:19] given to us as Sons to answer with the
[2:23] word instead of our
[2:25] emotion the enemy is asking a bunch of
[2:27] questions and if you answer with your
[2:29] emotion
[2:31] sir he's going to tie you up and Tangle
[2:32] you up in your own thoughts but if you
[2:35] answer with the word he doesn't know
[2:37] what to do with
[2:40] you right here's somebody here's a son
[2:43] that knows what to do with the power as
[2:46] long as the church doesn't know what to
[2:47] do with the power it's like a wasted
[2:51] commodity but when sunship becomes our
[2:54] understanding by Revelation then we know
[2:57] who we are because of whose we are yes
[3:00] and we begin to have confidence in the
[3:02] god who's living inside of us and we
[3:04] begin to understand that the mystery was
[3:08] always to be
[3:10] always to be Christ in you
[3:15] [Music]
[3:17] amen the hope of glory somebody said
[3:19] well if everybody knows that it's not a
[3:21] mystery everybody doesn't know it most
[3:24] people say it but they don't know it
[3:27] it's different it's not just having some
[3:29] little small deposit of a spirit in you
[3:31] and now I'm I'm I it's Christ in me no
[3:34] no no what house will you build me I'm
[3:37] not looking for a tent anymore I'm not
[3:39] looking for a tabernacle anymore I'm not
[3:41] looking for a for a wood and and Stone
[3:44] Temple anymore I'm looking for a
[3:46] tripartate man I'm looking for one who
[3:49] will yield himself Body Soul and
[3:53] Spirit to become an anointed man and an
[3:57] anointed woman and I want you to know
[3:59] that while you are tossing in the sea of
[4:01] Life somebody in the
[4:04] house is winning the
[4:08] battle Pentecost understood the
[4:12] filling but they didn't understand the
[4:16] positioning they didn't understand what
[4:18] full adoption looks like that releases
[4:21] The Authority when a son is properly
[4:26] placed when a son is properly put
[4:29] position you can't be properly placed or
[4:32] positioned if you're floating on a bed
[4:35] of
[4:40] ease cushions cushions and rose
[4:44] petals don't position
[4:47] Sons
[4:49] battles
[4:50] blood
[4:52] bullets sweat
[4:56] spit trenches
[5:00] that's what places and positions
[5:03] Sons it's battle
