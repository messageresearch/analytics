TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I shared with the church last uh week when I got back from Taiwan that I was preaching on Tove how many of you have heard the message that we have done on Tove well I took it a little bit further and and I begin to to really try to express to those folks what to really is and to is a Hebrew word that means in its in its mildest form it means good but in its deepest form it means when the seeds of Destiny and purpose that God has planted begin to sprout and bring forth what they were planted to bring forth that is Tove and when when when the seeds of Destiny and purpose that have been planted in someone are not bringing forth they are not sprouting because they're not leaning into those seeds of Destiny and purpose they're just men and women running from the presence of the Lord have you ever been there uh that is it's really considered in Hebrew Rah R A which is bad or evil did you know that in the in the Old Testament in Hebrew if you're not doing what you're called to do what what you're being pulled to do and it doesn't mean if you're not doing it uh successfully with with baskets full of harvest it it means if you're not moving in that direction God calls that raw he calls that evil he doesn't call call it not good he calls it evil and and I begin to speak about how we should practice seeing Tove in one another husbands should practice seeing Tove in their wives wives should practice looking for Tove you may have to look really hard to find Tove in your husband not my wife Tove just jumps up in her face out of my life every day but she wakes up and says oh you are so Tove you notice I stepped away from the pull pit to say that but anyway I was bringing out this contrast and I had a I had a a female interpreter and she was interpreting in in uh um cantones which is a dialect of Chinese and she was doing an amazing job and she was quite comfortable and I guess I guess she was doing an amazing job she wasn't a hindrance to me that's how I judge an interpreter are they hindering me or helping me I have no clue what they're saying but I've already asked the Holy Ghost to guide their mouth I I tell you I usually lay my hands on them at some point and say Lord don't you let them speak one word that misrepresents what you're trying to say to your people today whether but on purpose or by accident and many of us have had experiences where the Holy Spirit would drop in our heart when we're preaching he didn't say what you said said yeah and I've corrected interpreters and stopped them and said now wait a minute you say what I just said not because my words are important but the message is important to get across to the people I don't want you twisting what I say with your Doctrine unless you're the pastor of the house and if you're not then I've been invited by the pastor Etc but I just turned to this little woman we were sitting on stools because it was a class and we were teaching imagine me teaching but anyway we're sitting on stool and I just turned to her and I just gently laid my hand on her shoulder and I began to speak Tove over her life and I began to tell her that I I saw that she was yielding her life and gift to the Lord you know something along this line and what a blessing she had been to me and how thankful I was that she was willing to do such a thing and she began to weep I mean weep and when she got through she said can I have permission to say something and I thought well I I guess yeah sure' and she began to speak in English and then in Chinese and she said I was going to tell uh Pastor Tam today that I was would never interpret again because I've been under such a an attack and under so much criticism and feeling like I was doing such a lousy job for years until I was ready to give up until you turned to me and and said what you said it Set Me Free from all of that stuff and I'm willing to continue to do what whatever God has called me to do do you know how powerful that was in the meeting do you know I could have I could have just stopped teaching you know I didn't right I could have just stopped teaching because she just we just by the Holy Spirit inter in demonstrated what was being preached and and this is so important for us to be able to look into one another and and instead of seeing all the failures find something there try to see what God sees how is that possible we try to look through the blood and if you want to to to look at someone else in Grace I suggest that you take one big old look at your own life and when you see who you have been and how you've been behaving it'll be much easier for you to see Jesus in somebody else come on now why is that important because it's like fertilizing the seeds of Destiny and purpose in someone else's life when you begin to try to BL bless them for what they've done for what who they've been on a personal level or on a on a general scale and you start speaking over those seeds of Destiny they begin to sprout they begin to stir up the holy spirit of God begins to stir up those seeds and they begin to find potential oh Hallelujah think about the power we have to help someone on their journey to Tove with our words verse 1 through 5 those of you who can remain standing please I want us just to give a little honor to the word of God now Moses this is Exodus 3:1 and uh we've heard from Brother Caleb now three times Paul Keith twice he'll be speaking tonight they're going to share the service in the morning and uh here's my little bit and so ask the Lord to help me I I I want his help to try to deliver this to you um I feel a little sorry for our home folks because mostly it's home folks here and you hear me all the time time but uh God knows so we'll just see what how how it goes verse one now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert you ever been there not a whole lot going on in the natural in the back side of the desert but there's a whole lot that goes on in the spiritual in the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush he appeared to him in a flame of fire we always just say the burning bush but the Bush was not the attraction the fire on the Bush was the attraction ain't that right uh so he appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked I guess he did and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight he already saw it Bible said he saw it now he stops to contemplate what he's seeing and he makes a very important decision Vision I'm going to turn I'm not going to continue going in the way I'm going I'm going to turn because I perceive that this is not just a sign I perceive that there's a message behind this sign this sign is going to speak to me and when he recognized that the Bible said he turned aside to see this great sight why the bush is not burnt or consumed and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see well I'm telling you God was very present he was very present that day on Horeb he was watching Moses Like an Eagle making sure that Moses was going to handle this the right way and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush out of the fire and said Moshe Moshe Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither don't come any closer put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seat you know this you know this event you know this is the calling of Moshe you know that this is the time in the life of Moses where he is about to be begin to fulfill the purpose of his birth amen uh one of the scriptures that we use when we're teaching on Tove is the is the the proclamation that yoked the mother of Moses made over him when she saw him she said this is a what goodly child goodly child and and we always say what mother looks at their child and and and doesn't think that he's good no one says I've got a bad baby well not not the day they're born anyway you know and we we don't have to go down that road where we you know do talk about the fact that all babies aren't beautiful but if you want us not originally not initially sometimes our heads are a little funny and they're little blue and and things happen they've gone through a lot and it sometimes takes a day or two to get everything settled back down to where the average eye would think it's beautiful but I promise you Mama and Daddy they think that baby is beautiful bruises and all cone head everything no stress of birth it's all right but if you should desire to see what a perfect baby looks like we have a brand new baby here this morning that's one of the most handsome boys I've ever seen in my life and and that is uh brother um Luke and sister Megan yich brought their little baby here this morning Caleb what's his middle name Caleb John and I hope you get a chance to see I came out of the washroom uh a few minutes ago uh and my wife was standing there she said there's a visitor to see you and they show me this amazing handsome little boy I didn't see him the day he was born but I saw a picture of him and he was pretty perfect from the beginning but she said goodly a goodly child and when we look at that word in the Hebrew it's Tove and and so we know that she wasn't just saying I've gotten a good child what we what we believe she was saying is I'm not going to just look at him through the natural eyes of a mother I'm going to look at him through spiritual eyes and the reason why I I'm choosing the word goodly or to is because I'm looking ahead to a time when this son is going to bring forth the seeds of his Destiny and purpose and began to be what God has sent him to this world to be there couldn't have been a more inconvenient time to have a baby because the children of Israel were in horrible horrible slavery and now under horrible persecution and threat of death and here's a new little baby and the word is getting around that newborn babes are about to be thrown in the river to the crocodiles and The Midwives have already been given instruction to murder the little Hebrew babies Etc you know what was going on at that time and yet here a mother it's not looking at her circumstances God bless yoked the mother of Moses God bless her because she was able to ignore what it looked like in the natural and look at her child with more than natural mother eyes she saw him with Spirit eyes she said this child is going to live to bring forth the seeds of Destiny and purpose that God has planted in his life he is a Tove child praise God the hope of every mother the hope of every father but she saw it she believed it she knew there was a threat that he would be killed but she was not going to accept the fact that God would let this little boy pass from the scene without doing what he was called to do the mother of Moses saw greatness in her child as he lay there we could go on and talk about the mother of of of the twins Jacob and Esau and we could say we could explain some things about that how the mother gave the prophecy she began to decree the destiny of her two sons there's a lot of powerful examples of that in the Bible but we want to move on because now we are to the time that Moses has left Egypt and he didn't leave on vacation he left fleeing for his life amen and why did he leave fleeing for his life because he was going to take the Deliverance of the Hebrew children into his own hands stay with me just a moment he was going to do what he could to deliver the children of Israel with his own brute power with his own hands with his own strength and he had taken all he could take one day and he's walking through the brickyard and he sees these Egyptian slave drivers whipping a Hebrew and he began he was already beginning to discover his his Heritage his roots he was feeling things that he didn't understand uh he was raised as a as a son to Pharaoh he was schooled in the best schools of Egypt and and and but he began to recognize you know I don't know if it happened like it did in the Ten Commandment movie or not uh where where the little little part of the prayer Shaw was discovered and and so then he he couldn't know who he was but something was happening in him that began to cause him to feel a little different than those around him has anybody ever had that experience or was I the only Chicken in uh only Eagle in the chicken yard see Moses began to feel like an eagle in a chicken yard something was not quite right and so he said I've got a to do something for these people and and he took the Deliverance of the children of Israel into his own hands and slew the Egyptian slew him killed him murdered him and then had no choice but to run for his life and he gets out there on the backside of the desert because God has to separate him from his comfort zone and his dependence on everybody around him so that he will completely depend on the God who called him before he was ever born right you want to talk about separation Abraham had seven of them before he became exactly who God had called him to be if you've only had one or two you ought to thank God that that's all it took if you're where you want to be because there are many separations and cycles of Separation that have to take place in our lives where the sword of the Lord hear me where the sword of God's word has to come and cut and separate us from the things that we have become familiar with so that we can be launched into a a stream that God wants us flowing in just a moment Amen brother I just want to help myself just a little bit cuz I need it I need help all right so here is Moses now and he is stirred up something has happened he's now on the backside of the desert he's he's married a little woman Jethro the midianite priest um who the Samaritans have have descended from the Samaritans of today who live on on top of the mountain there in Northern Samaria in Israel they claim Jethro as their Heritage and so here is this man his father-in-law and and and he's taking Moses in and Moses is caring for the sheep and uh because he's about to be a shepherd of men and so God trains him to be a Shepherd Of Men by giving him sheep to lead amazing isn't it a and so uh he's walking along chasing some of these sheep Lord have mercy you don't want a pastor to start talking about chasing sheep but he is chasing sheep and and it's always the same two or three it's it's not it's not the main herd it's not it's not the whole herd thanks be to God it's always the same two or three and he's chasing them uh because he wants to help them and he's probably struggling in his heart with the fact that sometimes it takes a crack upside the head because that staff that everybody talks about that had a crook on one in that crook wasn't just for pulling them back by the neck off the cliff it was also for cracking them upside the head when they needed to learn a lesson those are the three amens I anticipated but it's the truth and so I'll get off of that and so Moses is you know probably chasing one of these straggling sheep keep them from falling off the cliff telling them how wonderful they are stroking their fur and telling them it's going to you're just amazing your behavior is from hell but you're certainly from Heaven you know whatever he was doing and all of a sudden the fire of God the holy pre presence of God falls on that bush why that Bush was that the only Bush on Mount Horeb no God just chose a bush that's the bush I'm going to put my fire in and do you know that all of a sudden when the fire of God fell on that bush it was no longer an ordinary Bush it was the most spectacular Bush on that mountain and by the very virtue of the presence of God falling on that bush that Bush was made holy because to be made holy means to be separated from that which is not holy wow and so uh it wasn't a holy Bush five minutes before it was just a bush get it but when the fire fell on it it's now a holy bush not because all of a sudden it was following all the rules it's a bush for crying out loud but because God chose that bush and he said I'm going to put my fire in that bush and a message is going to come out of that bush that bush is not any more special than any other bush in fact that bush might have just had a seventh grade education wow but I'm going to put my father fire on that bush not so that people will see the bush I want Moses to see more than the bush I want him to understand how my fire can fall on that bush and it not be burned because don't tell me God's fire is not consuming fire it is consuming fire the fire of God oh will consume everything in its path and that's why I wonder sometime when people are begging for fire if they really know what they're asking for because fire just won't give you the Willy Willies or the Goosebumps or make the hair stand up on on your arm the fire will absolutely consume everything that is not like God so do you really want the fire you see does everything have to be right for the fire to fall it has to be in order but it doesn't have to be perfect but it has to be in order the Bible talks about how the priest laid everything in order wood right you know rocks right everything put just right and then that Perpetual ever burning fire of God fell on the Altar and the priest who were not given the responsibility of recreating that fire the priests were then given the responsibility of protecting that fire guarding that fire so that it didn't go out because if it went out the folk were in trouble when they dab in AB B who they got this idea that that that fire is okay but but we can do that we can we can put some fire together like that and so here they come and they tried to bring a fire that God didn't start that's more dangerous than the Holy Fire when you start trying to bring a fire that you created with your own head ask Abraham what happens you get a little boy that you don't know what to do with you get an Ishmael you don't know what to do with him because he is now old enough that he's mocking your promised child Isaac and he's got to be dealt with and this is what happened when we try to make a Revival out of our own knowledge or Moses trying to deliver the children of Israel by slaying an Egyptian with his own power then he had to forsake them that's right he couldn't even stay around to help them he had to run from his life so what he thought was a good idea at the moment was not particularly a good idea but it drove him to the backside of the de desert where God teaches all of his prophets backside of the desert lonely your companions become scorpions and serpents rocks heila monsters great day in the morning you I'm telling you you anyway that's who your companions are you start talking to Cactus you're on the backside of the desert and so you don't want to produce try to produce something in your own strength in your own power in your own intellect you want to wait on the fire of God the fire of God fell on this bush and Moses turned to see this special Bush it wasn't special five minutes before it's now special because God's fire is on it nothing you can do will make you any more special then God sees you already if you've said yes to him am it is not you who makes yourself special it is the fire of the Lord on your life that makes you special why that bush because God just decided that's the bush I'm going to fall on now people have a problem with the Sovereign choice of God but I tell you you just go through the scripture and he could have chosen Egypt he could have chosen he could have chosen the Philistines he could have chosen the Canaanites he could have chosen Any Nation but he didn't he chose Israel he chose Jacob he chose Abraham he could have chosen others but those are the ones he chose H to put his you know special Covenant with uh special promises activated in their lives it's a powerful thing so Moses sees the fire of God on a bush but it's the bush itself is not being consumed he turns to see this sign he saw God's presence there he knew something was was uh up and the turning point in in the difference between raw and Tove the difference between staying on the gerbal wheel the hamster wheel and finally beginning to accomplish something for God it's always at the turning point now brother brandom was talking about in a message turning the corner there's something powerful about those those Junctions in time where a COR has to be turned Paul Keith ministers about about the fact and and we've heard Caleb say similar things too that it it cannot be church as usual something has to turn and we can't make it turn it's going to take the the the the chyos moment of the lord it's going to take a Divine moed an appointment from God to turn things and we've got to be a people sensitive enough to say wait a minute God's doing something new over here in this bush I better turn aside to to see and to hear what it's all about come on and and as Paul Keith has taught us many many times over the years God did something so profound and so significant and so powerful one generation ago and yet people still refuse to turn aside and see and hear what God did they'll just say God did a amazing thing there were great signs wonders and miracles and powers and he told people their names and read their addresses and and praise God that's so wonderful and we can do that too and the problem is there's a whole lot more to getting us to the place where we can be used in the way that God has called us to be used that's the turning point or the Tipping Point and that's where many of us are in this life and that's why it's been so hard on us the last season is because we're approaching the coming out of a season of of real compression bringing bring us back into the narrow way bringing us back into the narrow entrance back into his side you want to go back into his side do you want to be found in Christ I do and I got to find how to get in there I've got to find out how to be in Christ because to be in Christ means that I am no longer functioning off of my mortal life I am now functioning off of a life that has been given to me and the only way I can receive that life is through a union that must take place now if you think this Union idea is a new idea or or that brother Brandon was the first person to mention this Union you're wrong this Union was something that God spoke to Watchman KN and witness Le about in early China many many many years ago and they wrote Amazing books about the breaking of the soul the releasing of the spirit and about the organic Union of life with Jesus Christ but it was a language that was so foreign to people in the in the teens in the 20s so so so foreign that most people put it aside choked over it and you know a Watchman has been called everything from a prophet to a devil just like brother brandom just like anybody else that God's used some people call them uh uh God and some people call them Satan I mean that's just how it goes It goes that way today uh you ministers know what that's all about don't ever get excited because somebody says something nice about you don't even get excited just graciously say thank you shake your head and keep walking because people are fickle and the tongues that bless you today will curse you tomorrow and God allowed it to be that way because he wants to keep you humble and keep your head leaking so don't get puffed up because somebody says you did good wait a minute Amen brother amen amen amen amen and so it's an amazing thing to turn aside it's more than just you know some people think that's locking yourself in the closet and fasting 40 days and and not having you know I'm going to Fast Facebook you're not fasting Facebook if you check it secretly every day and don't post that's not fasting Facebook you know I'm going to fast TV you'd be better off not to have it in the first place I'm going to fast this I'm going to fast that and and and so many people think that we look we can't all live like the maharaji in a cave somewhere on the other side of the world some of us have to live in a functioning world because we've been called as as paradigms our life have been C our lives have been called as prophetic Parables for people to look at and they can't see us if we're always hidden somewhere so the prophet not only the prophetic people of the Lord not only have to understand what it means to go up on the mountain and into the cave to hear what God has to say they also have to learn what it means to stomp down out of that mountain and give the people thus saith the Lord and thus sayith the Lord means not filtered through man's Doctrine not filtered through man's tradition not filtered through man's opinion thus saith the Lord that little prophetic teacher there Paul Keith Davis nothing little about him but but him there uh here here's what he says I've been in conferences and spoken with him and he' tell the people tonight I am going to give you thus saeth the Lord and that night the crowd would swell the word got out we're going to hear thus sayeth the Lord from the mouth of a prophetic voice voice and he'd get up and preach on the importance of thus sayeth the Lord and then say I'm going to give you thus sayith the Lord here it is thus sayith the Lord you need thus sayith the Lord oh yeah it's true but it's quite a let down because so many people came expecting to hear something new something outstanding because most of our understanding and thoughts toward prophecy are I want to come and join the bless me club and I want a prophet or a prophetic gift to tell me how wonderful I am and how good I'm doing and how much God love the Bible told you how much God loved you the holy spirit in in your life is telling you that believe that because sometimes when we don't believe it God will give us a word through a prophetic voice to confirm it he certainly will but I'm telling you more than confirmation of his love look the biggest confirmation of his love is that love Came Down come on condescended God condescended into the body of a man died on the cross shed perfect blood created for Redemption so that I didn't have to that's right see and the reason why the Apostle Paul Could Die daily is because he died by fellowshipping with God With Jesus in his death when you fellowship with Jesus in his his death when you can identify yourself in his death it causes you to be reminded daily that you're dead and the reason why we need to be reminded daily that we have died in Christ oh this is New Testament this is Galatians this is Colossians this is Romans the reason why it's important for us to be reminded that we have died in Christ is because the old life the old nature likes to rise up at the most inopportune moments to slap us around to remind us of who we used to be not who we are who we used to be the devil that's all he has the only tool he has is to remind you of what you used to be but he makes it feel so real right now and then he reminds you see remember how you acted remember how you spoke remember what you did see that's who you really are it's a lie it's an absolute lie if you've been washed in the blood of the lamb and Born Again by the holy spirit of God that ugly thing that rises up in you is not who you are that's who the enemy would like you to be but there's supposed to be another life in you and this war that we fight you know a lot of people are always talking about well Paul said there's just going to be this war in when I seek to do good Evil's present evil I want to do that which which I would do and could do and shouldn't do what and have do and read it in King James it'll it'll confuse you this struggle that was going on and it was probably left that way for a purpose because in read to read it is a struggle and it reminds you that there was this struggling of natures that goes on in our lives brother vandom taught taught in his in his ministry that the greatest battle ever fought was going to be fought on the Battlefield of the Mind and that's why we often preach it's all in your head and it's literally all in our head it's really a struggle to see who our head will be will you be the head of your life or will you grab a hold of the head of Jesus Christ if you grab a hold of his head it will silence the war if you'll hold on to Jesus Christ as your head never let him go it will silence the war it doesn't work for me you say it will work for you when you approach it with the right attitude instead of approaching it in unbelief the biggest problem we have in the body is the problem of unbelief it's not an uncommon problem ever even we've read in the scripture Lord I believe help thou my unbelief telling us that there is a struggle sometime to believe to not believe to believe to not believe but if you want to access the Tove seeds of Destiny in your life you have to make mama can't make it for you I wish I had some help Mama can't make it for you Daddy can't make this decision for you husband can't make it for wife wife can't make it for husband and dear God your pastor cannot make this decision for you you have to make this decision you have to decide I'm going to approach god with full confidence because I want you to know there is not only a Deliverance promised there is a total Deliverance that is Promised for the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why God sent Moses that's why God sent Moses that's why we read The Exodus that's why the whole story is there it's it's it's a model of another Exodus to the Jewish people that's the most important event in their history the Jewish people believe and teach that the demonstration of God's power in the splitting of the Red Sea was the greatest single display of God's raw power in the earth that's the significance they they give to The Exodus but that Exodus was just a shadow that was just a model for another Exodus Exodus you see that Exodus because of their struggle LED them in a 40-year loop after loop after loop after Loop through the Wilderness but eventually they came to Deliverance right eventually God God along the way took took care of their enemies without and he started taking care of their enemies within well I didn't look around because I thought it was profound I looked around because I knew it was true that's what God does today right he the enemy wants you to focus on your your external enemies right he don't love me she don't like me you see the way they looked at me the enemy wants you to focus on your external enemies so that you won't have time to deal with a monster it's in the realm of the soul that the monster needs to be slain there's a dragon in there that needs his head cut off and needs some mighty Champions to swing him around by the beard that chopped off severed head of the enemy and say no more no more no more will you be able to dictate my life or torment my head because I'm going to win this battle of the mind because Jesus Paid the price not only for me to win the battle over external enemies but he paid the price for me to be able to slay the enemies within and that's why we need the revelation of the word of God we don't need doctrine as Doctrine we need doctrine by revelation we need to know that what we believe is given to us by the revelation of the Holy Ghost that we're not just carrying around the traditional uh uh you know Theology of past Generations but can we see it in the word and when we do how will we respond the modern Church world this is their favorite slogan it doesn't really mean that it doesn't really mean that it doesn't really mean that it didn't really mean that it didn't really mean that so you can't even use the word to help people today but religiously educated stupid you can't help them you can't help them by saying look there was a time in my Ministry in the early days we're talking 30 years ago that you could just tell folks the word said yeah it's right here oh I never knew that was in there but now we have become so educated TBN has made the theologians of all of us The Gospel According to Charisma you don't have to say nothing I get my food on YouTube I'm telling you I thank God for all technology I thank God for Christian television I certainly do because I get I get my chances to preach every week on Christian television through the Nations I really appreciate Christian television I really appreciate Charisma sometime they've really reported some good stuff and I really appreciate YouTube there's some amazing things on YouTube but I want you to know we need the Holy Ghost discernment to be able to judge between to and raw you see that's the that's the wisdom Solomon had two women claimed the same baby and so uh Solomon was looking for something more in those two mothers than the behavior they were displaying that day before his throne he was looking beyond their mouth both of them were were lwd women both of them had not lived very good lives and here they are struggling over the same baby and they they wanted Solomon to make the decision over which one gets to take the living baby home the other baby's gone and he looks and sees how they're both struggling over the baby and he decides I've got to look deeper than what I hear and I've got to look deeper than what I see I've got to see if I can see and identify the seege of purpose in these women's life cuz neither one of them have lived the life of a mother remember what they' just done I mean that's hard that'd be hard that'd be terrible we can't even fathom that neither one of them had displayed the character of a mother so he had to look beyond what he saw what he heard what he knew about them and he had to be able to identify the character of a mother he had to look for the seat of Destiny in one of them though it had not yet manifested which one of these women did God truly call to be a mother because having babies doesn't make you a mother it's like having a church doesn't make you a pastor and having a vision doesn't make you a prophet and being in a garage doesn't make you a car smelling like a rose doesn't make you a flower hey and running fast doesn't make you a horse somebody say Amen it's more than that and he looked into one of these mothers who said let her have him finally the struggle was over I'm I'm tired of this you can have let her have the child I don't want him anymore I I I want her to have him I want her to raise him it's her baby I don't want and oh Solomon said there it is there is the seeds of a mother he was able to forget what they had just done and how they had lived their lives and he was able to identify in that woman that God had truly indeed called her to be a mother and he said no you're here this is your child you're the real mother go and raise this child Lord we need the wisdom of Solomon although it wasn't wisdom he was asking for he was praying for understanding that he might be able to judge between toen raw that's the words toen raw because sometimes oh my my my my my sometimes what we see prospering we want to call it Tove because it's blooming and when we something see something shriveled up we want to call it raw because we don't see it producing any fruit and so we will make our discernment based on what we see with our eyes and hear with our ears how many of you know not in this Supernatural hour not in this hour are you going to be able to judge by what you see in here you're going to have to have the knower you're going to have to have something on the inside of the inside of the inside in the control tower of your spirit I know exactly where the Ark of the Covenant is and I didn't have to ask Indiana Jones I know exactly where the Ark of the Covenant is it is right here in me this is The Mercy Seat this is where the blood lays wow right here this is the house of the shakina sh glory of the Lord here it is I'm not waiting on the Glory I have the glory living inside of me where's the demonstration where's the where's the glitter where's the feathers the internal glory of God does not come to give us more signs although we need more signs when the glory of God moves moves into the life of The Believer by the revelation of the word that's how it gets there and in order for it to be there on The Mercy Seat this great Revelation in order for God to speak out of that place between the Cherry beims in order for God to be able to speak out of that place it's got to be emptied first you got to get all those Devils out come on you've got to slay the Dragon you got to get that attitude under control come on so that it's not you speaking out of your but it's it's the one sitting on the on the Ark of the Covenant here speaking I'll meet you there I'll meet you there isn't it amazing God said I'll meet you there he's still saying today I'll meet you in there the angel of the Lord said to brother random in the tent I'll meet you in there that's where I'll meet you in there there is a secret place where God wants to meet with his bride in intimacy to reveal to us a relationship that produces Authority and not power all of those folk who are telling us that we're powerless and we need more power we absolutely are under a misunderstanding it is not more power that we need because Jesus said said ter in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and that power is the life of Jesus Christ Living inside of the believer because everything the father was he poured into his son Jesus Christ and everything that was in Jesus he poured upon the church the elect by the power of the Holy Ghost so what you have in you is not just a warm and fuzzy feeling if you've received the Holy Ghost the true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire you have the zo life of God living inside of you and you can't have the life of God without having Glory Glory why don't we see this why don't we see that why don't we see the other because we don't know what's in us and we're waiting on it to fall on us if Bobby Connor were here this year he'd say like ripe cherries from a tree we're waiting on something to fall on us that's already in us and we haven't understood it because our minds are still veiled I tell you what we need we need more than fire in a bush on we need the sword of the lord we need the not just the Written Letter when we think about you know brother Caleb was talking about how good his wife an is is at at finding the address in a in what we called in the in the Sunday school class years ago a sword drill and so when we say the word of God is a sword we're not just talking about uh Genesis to Revelation we're not just talking about two books put together the older Covenant and the newer Covenant we're not just talking about the printed page we're not just talking about the living letter of the word I want you to know there's a sword for the bride there is a sword for the bride and it's more than just a Written Letter it's more than just a blackback book is that big enough on I believe in big ones big ones it's more than this it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that gets this on Thy word have I laid out on my coffee table to make everything think I'm religious Thy word have I used to decorate the shelves of my living room so that everyone will come and know that I'm a student of the word no Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee Oh God let me tell you the word that he was talking about was not the written word there was no written word accessible to the Common Man in that hour he wasn't talking about the ri written word alone he was talking about the The Living Word of God the Living Word of God somebody say the Living Word of God what does the Living Word of God look like it looks like the sun if you want to know what the Living Word looks like it looks like the son because in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God John 1:1 John 114 says and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us the Pentecostal charismatic World spend a lot of time being on witch hunts and if they find out that you've baptized someone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they've immediately got to put you in some kind of Oneness category I was raised Assembly of God isn't that a shocker I was never raised United Pentecostal I was never raised in the Oneness church I was in fact we were were we were you know warned against those people but by revelation we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because we got this crazy idea that that's what the Bible said that's right and they say well what about what Peter said that's right that's right that's right what about Matthew 28 listen Peter was standing there when Jesus made that statement baptized if he made it baptized in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost Peter was standing right there and Peter's the one that had this word from the Lord Lord who am I Peter who do men say that I am oh some say you're Elijah reincarnated or Revisited some say you're Isaiah one of the prophets who do you say I am Peter said I know exactly who you are you are the Messiah you are the Messiah you are the manifested Son of God and Jesus turned to him and said blessed are you Simon B born of Jonah blessed are you chosen are you not because you've learned something in seminary not because you're father Earthly father taught you something Jonah had nothing to do with this I want you to know you are blessed today because Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you who I am it was revealed to you of my heavenly father and upon this Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it Revelation 10:7 but the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery singular of God shall be fulfilled as he hath declared to his servants the prophets plural well are there many Mysteries yes but one of the greatest Mysteries of the end time that God has unlocked is to help us to know who Jesus is you say everybody knows who Jes everybody in church knows who Jesus is no they don't because some people think he's just an you know like a Hallmark card God cared enough to send the very best no honey God didn't care enough to send the very best God cared enough to step down off the throne come in a body of Flesh and in that body of Flesh there was not one ounce not one drop of the blood of Joseph his Earthly father and his blood didn't come from his mother Mary where did his blood come from God created this Divine blood this Holy Blood the chemistry of the blood is not what made it so powerful it was the life that was placed in that blood that made it so powerful and to have that blood on the on the mercy seat of your life is to release in you the Zoe eternal life of God it doesn't get any better than that and so one of the greatest mysteries of all time is to understand that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament not a Lesser God not a representative for God but God in flesh not in the same office of the father not in the same office of the Holy Spirit but nonetheless God in flesh so much so I'm hurrying not really so much so that that Jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father when I've spoke to you you've heard the father so much so that the apostles told us that that in him dwelt a piece of the godhead bodily one person of the godhead bodily what did it say were quiet you'd never you'd never know that at least 80% of the people here this morning in streaming believe this you wouldn't believe it would you as quiet as it is why because you're treading on that Dangerous Ground I want you to know that is so simple and yet so confusing to people and it's one of those holy cows you know that people have set up like India where they'll starve to death and worship the cow kill that thing yeah a Hamburg make a hamburger out of him that's right you'd be surprised how many hamburgers you can have out of those sacred cows kill it bleed it out chop it up eat it with onions and when we get to the place where we're willing to slay our sacred cows and take the Revelation that God wants to give his people in this hour and we judge that well that's so simple I don't think that really matters that's just kind of semantics anyway doesn't matter how you're baptized doesn't matter how you see God doesn't matter how you explain Jesus it matter wonder how the father feels when you tell him that his Plan of Salvation was so confusing that it really doesn't even matter how you believe it that's right it matters because it is the mystery of God that was to be finished at the sounding of the voice of the seventh angel because it is the mystery that unlocks all of other Mysteries you cannot understand seven Thunders you cannot understand Seven Seals you cannot understand the original sin you cannot understand the the real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that it's not just speaking in tongues it's releasing the character of Jesus Christ all other Mysteries are released unveiled out of the mystery of God right he said it the mystery of God that he is the same in that sense the Jews are way ahead of the church Amen brother because every day of their lives when they wake up they pray the shma here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one you can't contain him you can't divide him he has many offices he has many demonstrations he has many personalities he has many attributes but you can't divide him the Holy Ghost in you is just as much God as the father above the Holy Ghost in you is just as much God as the son why is that important because it reveals to us where the Ark of the Covenant is it reveals to us that we're not waiting on something else to fall on us we're waiting on something to draw out from within us what God has placed there to bring us to fruitfulness it's in me somebody say it's in me now we have to move on Moses tried rescuing Israel in his own power slayed the Egyptian and failed he had to flee for 4 years which was an entire generation a whole generation of training 40 years yeah only 10 years shy of 50 years think of it I want you to know when we learn that we cannot accomplish Bridal business in our own power in our own strength as long as you're looking at your guns amen as long as you're looking at your own brute force and you think you can do Bridal business or Kingdom Business with your muscles any of them you can't do Bridal business with these muscles you can't do Bridal business with this muscle we can only do Bridal business when we surrender to the one who sits in the control tower of Our Lives if we've allowed him there come on Lighthouse come on control tower Houston we have a problem you're right we do we're losing communication with the control tower wow there's one place you don't want to be and lose communication with the control tower and that's where out there in the far expanses of the universe with your Lifeline cut off when your Lifeline is cut off when your communication with the control tower is cut off what cuts it off sin what is sin unbelief when your communication with the control tower is cut off by unbelief you're on your own and that is not where the bride wants to be that's not where the sons want to be in this hour on our own because all we'll do is slay one Egyptian and have to flee the business it's not enough it's on the back side of the desert I just want to ask you very seriously I know it's time is moving on but if you think I'm I mean I I didn't create time where I'm from there is none where I came from there is no time and bless God I believe that what I have to say this morning you you may take this the wrong way but I believe what I have to say this morning is more important than a football game on the television this afternoon what I think you ought to do just go ahead and subscribe to ESPN alerts right on your phone and you can sit right here and get the score with one side of your brain you can focus that hear that and the other side of your brain assuming that you've wak that part up you can hear what the Lord wants us to know for right now because everything that we have heard this week is building and building and building and we think so then why do we have to come and say something else we've already heard tremendous truth we've already heard such amazing thing it's because there is an ordained truth there is an ordained Truth for Saturday morning there's an ordained Truth for Saturday morning October the 10th 2015 that cannot be released on the morning of October the 9th 2015 or the evening of October the 10th 2015 God keeps appointments with his bride not just one but daily and all through the day and you don't want to be over here if God has an appointment with you over there he tried independently freeing Israel that'll never work that's that whole thing about power and authority that we tried to get to a few minutes ago we didn't make it there we don't need more power to fall on us we need to recognize the power that's already been given to us by the Holy Ghost who lives inside of us what we need a revelation of is not more power we need a revelation of what it means to be Sons what it means to be bride we need a revelation of the authority that comes with the office amen now I may believe this a little different than than than many folks out there and and maybe even our speakers I I I'm just going to say this is coming from me I am not one of those people who teach that you can qualify to be the bride of Christ I am not one of those people who believe that that that uh you'd all you know you can work your way there or get holy enough and be there I truly believe that you are bride because of what God knew about you before the foundation of the world not how good you do while you're here but by election I said it there it is I said it by election and I believe you are elected to that place not because you're better than someone else I believe you are elected to that office because of God knowing you in out up down upside downside there are some that will hear the revelation of the word and respond like a thorough bread there are others who will hear the revelation of the word and respond like a jackass I said it mule religion got your attention now Lord I've lived a long time I've never heard a Pentecostal holess preacher curse mule religion that's what a mule does you tell a mule what to do and he responds he responds all right don't he he'll say Amen a mule will say Amen but he's just a hybrid right he couldn't produce his that old mule couldn't reproduce himself if he wanted to because he is a hybrid when you take truth and mix it with opinion when you take truth and mix it with error when you take truth and mix it with church enity you form a mixture which is a hybrid it may run faster it may smell better it may produce more of a harvest but there's one thing it won't do and that's reproduce the life that's within it I'm telling you there's a bride that God is raising up in this hour in every nation of the world he's raising up a people because of a deep calling to the Deep because of a stirring on the inside of the inside of the inside that they can't calm that they can't quiet because of a voice that just cries out at the noise of thy water spouts the Deep cth to the deep and because there's a deep calling there has to be a deep to respond and in that bride she will be given the blessing of being able to reproduce out of her life the very seed of life that has been planted Within her what do you mean I mean that's where Sons come from Sons don't come out of our our bowels the word the scripture uses Sons real sons are not born through the natural womb of a woman the sons of God don't come forth out of natural wombs they come forth out of spiritual WBS who was it to was that Caleb or Paul Keith Pastor Caleb brother Paul Keith I've never called Paul Keith brother because he's never called me brother but he is my brother so I'll do brother Paul Keith Paul Keith got in trouble one time on a national radio program or off between the sets because he called the host a brother and and the and the host rebuked him and said don't say that if you can help it don't s call me brother because that to some people that sounds religious to me it sounds like the book of Acts yeah you are my brother we don't have the the same Mammy or the same py I am one I'm an only child spoiled rotten brat there's my mama she knows it she did it some of you ladies think that your underarm sag I want you to know mine really sag because my mama when she was getting a hold of me when I was growing up she didn't she be she couldn't always you know whip me she knew how to whip brother sister she didn't you know they weren't teaching affirmation then they weren't teaching timeout stool they were teaching hide under the bed from your mama hey because she is com in and fury is in her eyes and you are going to give up the devil today right now it it it worked she'd grabbed me right under that arm and yes sir and then real nicely out of the side of around she said don't ever make me do that again child abuser I tell you what it made me want to do better it made me want to never face that wrath again how many of you know what I'm talking about you got to move on now okay here's what here is what God was showing Moses he was showing Moses the very opposite of what Moses was Moses had been a man who lived in his own strength and power and God wanted to show Moses what it looks like to surrender to another life and so so what God did is he put his holy fire on that bush and for that moment of time that bush did not live from its natural life if that bush would have been living that day with that fire on it drawing strength from its roots drawing its life from its natural source how many of you know what would have happened in a matter of seconds in that dry Dusty desert there would have been nothing there but but a pile of Ashes God was showing Moses the contrast of who he had been you've been one who has always you have always lived off of your own strength your intellect what you were schooled at what they taught you in Egypt your the the strength of your bare hands that's how you've lived and survived I want to show you what it looks like when something is able to function to survive even to thrive even to be used with a message even given a voice because it surrenders its natural source of life and yields to a higher life how long did that bush burn I don't know 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes maybe still burning maybe it's still burning but what I know is during that amount of time that bush wasn't living natural Bush life you see there's there's carnal life there's Church Life and there's God Life Zoey life you choose natural life is because you have a soul and if you live out of that Soul life the only life you'll ever know is natural life the only strength you'll ever have is natural strength but you're not just a soul you're not just a body it's actually your soul that gives your body natural life that's why your body can Thrive it's because you have a soul without your soul and how did you get that you got that by the release of the Breath of God Adam received the soul because God breathed on him spirit Spirit made Adam a living Soul amazing isn't it so you could be laying there a body and not be alive like ezekiel's Boneyard uh this is quickly I got to hurry this is very very quick quick to find in the scripture if you want to look at it in Isaiah 43:7 put it up please it says even for everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him doesn't that all mean the same thing I have created him I have formed him I have have made him no do you think God thinks you're that dumb that he has to say the same thing three different ways he's not a pastor it's we pastors who think we got to back up and say it again got to back up and say it again we got to back up and say it again any good Jew will tell you that Hebrew was written in in a way that every uh vowel Mark every jot every turt says something when you read words repeated in the Bible it's not because it looks more poetic or it looks nicer on the line when we find a word repeated in the scripture it's repeated because there was a reason for it being repeated if Isaiah said God created you formed you and made you in one sentence he did it because he wanted you to know there was a difference from being created and formed and there was a difference from being formed and made and if you look at it you'll find it's three different Hebrew words and I wished I had time to unpack all of that for you but I don't except to say the word formed is a word yatsar which means to Fashion out of something that already exists when God made Adam we'll use the word made when God formed Adam he formed him out of something that already existed isn't that what the scripture said when God made the universe he formed it out of something that did not exist he stepped out on nothing spoke the word and something appeared powerful isn't it but when God made man he had already made the Earth he had already made creation he'd already made the dust and God for a reason reason why dust why not spit why didn't God make Adam from spit why didn't God make Adam from something else dust for a reason the word Adam means red Earth he made Adam's Body from the Red Dirt Adam Adam red Earth Red Dirt he he he did that out of something that already existed but Adam was not finished he was formed his body was formed out of something that already existed Genesis 3:19 says in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou shalt return this body will return to the elements from when it has come it was dust in the beginning it'll be dust in the end this body cannot inherit the eternal life life of God forever and ever this body cannot exist in its natural form for all eternity it can't stand in the fullness of the glory of God so it has to give way it has to return back at some point either by death or Resurrection either by death or the time when when those who are alive are changed first Thessalonians 5:23 and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy you say why does that matter that we got all that different stuff going on very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul wanted us to know that we are a Triune form formed being we are we are a trunity we are not three separate persons trying to function as one we are three dimensions co-operating coex existing in one identity we're one person I am one person you say yeah but you've got multiple personalities come on don't say some of you've never thought it but I'm one person I'm Body Soul and Spirit my body was formed but the word made in that place in in Isaiah 43:7 the word made is AA and it means a substance required of which the thing made consists meaning it cannot exist until something that was already made what has already been made is needed as an ingredient somebody said is't that isn't that the same meaning of the first no not in its base definition it's so so different that it merited a completely different word in Hebrew that is talking about the soul the soul was made the soul is simply that which gives life to a person how do we know that now there's many more Dimensions to the soul believe me I understand it's the mind the will and the emotions I understand the doorways in I understand uh what brother brandom taught us I understand that there's people who study the message who believe that the spirit is on the inside of the inside there are those who believe the soul is on the inside of the inside and right now just just please let's don't have that argument let's try to see the fact that we are we are three different dimensions functioning in one body god mentioned that each of those were were brought forth in a different way because there's something that he wants to reveal to us and he does this in scripture by telling us things like in the ark there were eight Souls saved what did does that mean does that mean they had a Revival and an altar call and eight Souls came to join the church no it means lives doesn't it eight lives were spared because with a soul you have life now there's another part of you that comes from the word that that means to create and to create is to bring something out of nothing or to bring into existence something which never existed before now this is important to know because in Genesis 1:3 it says God said what let there be light in all the other verses in Genesis 1 it said and God created and God created and God created and God created and God created but in verse three it didn't say he created anything it said he called it forth that didn't it let there be well I think let there be in create means the same thing it doesn't sorry I'm sorry it doesn't because light existed before the Sun and light existed before the moon these great luminaries these great reflections of light were were created by God to to bring forth light but light was already there in the beginning light was already there but light was comingled with Darkness that's right and that is a mixture and the Bible tells us that through the writings of the prophets that's why great mysteries of light are often concealed and hidden in darkness treasures and secrets are often hidden in darkness and it takes a man who can turn on the lights it takes the Holy Ghost Revelation to pull the light out of the darkness to separate the light from the darkness when God said let there be light he was not creating light he was separating light from Darkness that's right powerful so light was not created light sprung forth from the Fountain of the logos light was part of the very essence of who God is Adam and Eve were not naked not originally they didn't have own clothes they had on his light they were dressed in his light think about that wow when Jesus was transfigured on the mount he showed what it looks like hello when Moses came down off of the mountain he showed in measure what it looks like to come into fellowship with that great light your countenance has changed there is a glory there is a type there is a there is a measure of that light that you can have that Fades how many of you have ever tasted a measure of Glory it fades I talk about the time that I encountered the Divine compassion of the Lord and I ashamedly I'm hurrying now 12:20 see we started at 10:30 11:30 oh I have a few more minutes by anybody's clock and if I don't by your clock throw it out there's so much that God wants to say to us listen this book of Genesis is what good does it do you to focus on the Book of Revelation if you can't understand the book of beginnings that's a thing I appreciate about what we call the message of the hour is when God started revealing that word he didn't just go to the end of things to tell us how it's going to be in the end he said you're not going to understand the end if you don't really see the beginning I'm going to take you all the way back to the beginning and that's why when the church cries out back to Pentecost back to Pentecost I say hallelujah praise the Lord but that ain't enough that's right God did not come in this hour to prepare Sons to prepare a bride just to take us back to Pentecost he has come to take us all the way back to where it all began in the book of Beginnings in baret the book of origins The Book of Genesis where it all started why because Authority is not revealed in the Book of Revelation Authority is revealed in the book of Beginnings amen Adam let me tell you something about Adam Adam did not live his live Natural Life as we understand it Adam and Eve were clothed in the light of God and natural life was not their source and they would have lived forever right in that condition because they weren't functioning off of the natural life that we know Adam was made he was formed and he was created in the very image of God that means Body Soul and Spirit it Adam was the perfect Son of God right perfect oh my well that makes me nervous when you say something like that because we know what happened in the garden I hope you do I hope you know what the New Testament says the New Testament says Adam was not deceived he did exactly what he knew that he was supposed to do because he was a model he was a forerunner did he pay the price absolutely was he marred absolutely did he lose his robe of light absolutely how would you like to trade in an Armani suit for a Goodwill suit there nothing wrong with wearing a Goodwill suit but you're not going to go to Goodwill and say hey I've got an Armani suit that fits and I'm going to trade it in because I really want this Goodwill suit that fits do you understand what I'm saying that's what Adam had to do he had to trade in the best clothes the light of God for bloody skins right any way you look at it it was a covering but it was a downgrade not an upgrade right let me tell you what fell in the garden not just did their clothes change their Spirits fell their Spirits fell they begin to operate in a fallen spirit so the church would say Fallen soul I think that would be all right except that it does not quite capture what happens when you quit Living spirit life and start living Soul life or flesh life it's more than just changing coats it's changing the nature of everything you are what happened to Adam and Eve in the garden it changed everything about who they were it's big it's huge that's why it's absolutely ridiculous when it's reduced to a to a picture in a comic book of a of a of a snake curled around a tree and an apple with a bite with a bite took out of it when it's reduced to something like that it certainly does not reflect what really happened when when man's Spirit Falls and he walked out of the garden living an entirely different life than the one he lived lived inside the garden inside the garden he existed by the life of God that's right outside the garden he existed with natural life which is from the soul which means when he died his soul left him which is why the scripture tells us the soul that sinth shall surely die because there's a part of you that cannot live forever separated from the zoy eternal life of God that's right let's think about it a minute more than just a garment change do I have another 10 minutes or so thank you thank you thank you I I I'll try to behave tonight I'll just come in Praise the Lord amen it's wonderful sing it just one more time okay Paul it's your turn Maybe the literal meaning of that word create because it's three different things means to bring something out of nothing and so we know that man was was formed he was made and he was created because he is body he is soul and he is spirit and this is a huge thing that happened and light was called forth out of darkness and the mixture could no longer exist and I want you to know the biggest need in the body of Christ in this hour is for the mixture to be done away with and the only thing that can do away with mixture is the calling forth of the light the main reason why we need the zadok priesthood to arise in this hour is we need the ability to judge and discern between Tove and raah we're living in an hour where men will take darkness and re-identify it and redefine it as light right I'm almost done I'm not going to say that again though we're living in such a messed up mix step confused society that a a hero an Olympic champion butchers his body Alters his chemicals puts on paint and wig walks up the stage twisting with some man how awkward is that to take take him and he walks up and the world bows and redefines this sickness and insanity and sin you don't have to say a word I didn't need anyen there sickness sin the perverting of Truth the twisting of life and the world celebrates it and calls it what Courage The Man of the Year Bruce I I can't say Caitlyn can you Bruce Caitlyn Jenner see I came from a generation where we you know a hero I'm that old Mark Spitz you know who Mark Spitz was great Olympic swimmer people today don't even know who he is it's what's his name what's the swimmer Phelps what a what a what a creature this young man has done amazing things in swimming but we didn't know who he was when I was a child it was Mark Spitz Bruce Jenner what's the skater guy h mark haml or whatever all these things and now here is some man lived his life in Twisted perversion run by a jezebel wife and a house full of Jezebel daughters because Jezebel is not the description of what they look like Jezebel's the description of the way they ruled the roost that's right that same spirit will rule the church I didn't say that John said it I got a problem with this church world I've got a problem Jesus said give this message let them know I've got a problem because you've taken that Spirit of Jezebel and you've exalted her as a propheus and you have allowed her to call the shots that's right that's right you have swallowed a lie and God said I'm not going to look at it that way I'm not going to I'm not going to let that go on I'm going to do something about that we cry out go God send the spirit and power of Elijah you don't want the spirit and power of Elijah to show up in the church world today until we make some preparation because you get the spirit and power of Elijah I know EX exactly what it sounds like it sounds like a John the Baptist that'll stomp right up to Herod and say it is not lawful for you to have your brother Phillip's wife you let the spirit and power of Elijah manifest in the church and they'll call fornication fornication and adultery adultery and homosexuality they'll call it sin they won't call it alternative living no alternative living is whether you decide to live in the mountains or at the beach not it's not describing your plumbing it's describing where you want to live Amen brother you sure you want the spirit and power of Elijah I tell you what a lot of those controlling spirits that fall on intercessors sometime to try to control the prophets do you know why the prophetic movement is in such a terrible shape in this nation and why they're prophesying against one another because they've been castrated by the spirit of Jezebel no I wouldn't preach it it's a white dove SOS no I wouldn't preach this out on the on the conference unless God told me to but the last time I looked around this morning I'm in the house that God gave me a voice in the prophets of today many of them have been castrated by the spirit of Jezebel on intercessors who have no understanding of the words that come out of their mouth and they control the message from the Pew God give us more intercessors who understand who they are and recognize their job is more powerful more potent more hard than controlling the pull pit that's right wow where did that come from we need we need prophetic voices in this hour that will raise up and give us thus sayeth the Lord and it'll actually happen Paul Kei the one who said I've got thus sayith the Lord for you you need thus sayith the lord well is it going to come from out of the mixture never never where's it going to come from those who have not yet had the veil removed by the living sword of the Lord to be able to even know who God is you're going to speak for a God you don't even know Bobby Connor says there they he said I tell you the problem today he said we speak way too much about a God we barely know that's right oh God we want to know you when you put your life in a bush we want to find out not what the bush is about we want to find out what the fire is about we want to stand like Moses and see the contrast of what we are here I stand living and functioning in my own string there is a bush that if it were living off of its own string would fall into ashes but it's not even consumed because for this moment in time that bush is drawing its strength from the life of the fire and not from the Life in The Roots do you understand we're the branches he's the vine amen when Paul Keith says things are these other men we can we can strike that if he's not comfortable with me calling his name but here's the here's the truth when we when we say we are the branches and he's the vine and when we hear things like we heard last night that there are new Revelations and new Mysteries and and and and he brought that back right back to the word not things that can't be lined up with the word but things we've never seen in the fullness not enough eyesa to really see like the blood like the blood for instance like how we died in Christ like how we were raised in Christ things that should have been Christianity 101 but we've missed them and God wants to shed some new light on the truth it's he said new light on Old truth and and when God wants to do that we we can't have a problem with that we cannot have a problem with that we can have a problem with seeing Miracles and healings again many people believe there'll be nothing like that nothing like that no move of God no stirring no Harvest no Revival at all that is totally impossible for you to get a bunch of branches who cease to live on their own life and start drawing life from their root see it's a different analogy it's a different analogy we're the branches now and we're drawing our life from the literal life of Jesus Christ that Bush was drawing its life from the root the Natural Life till the Firefish you and I have been living off of Soul life carnal life natural life until the fire falls until we understand what the sword has come to do not to kill us but to kill us I'm going quote Bobby Connor again there are two great forces in this world who want you dead God and Devil two want to kill you God wants to kill you the devil wants to kill you it's a matter of who's going to win who kills you first let me tell you something there's a part of us that has to die and that's our dependency on our own strength there's a part of us that has to live we've got to start drawing our strength 1:00 got to go from the very powerful precious holy life of Jesus Christ did I leave a lot hanging there I probably did but we can't go back to that now for that moment that Bush was not living on the life that came from within its roots no it was living and being strengthened from the life of God that was now living upon it in the fire this is what you looks like Revelation 1 quickly quickly please please let's move quick I I I'm I I'm I'll hush in a moment one I'll read fast I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day 110 and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou see us right in a book sended under seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and leoda and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man oh praise the lord it's Jesus that I see the son of man revealed in you and me it's one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle notice a lot there's a lot to notice here we can't notice at all notice this John was in the spirit on the Lord's day he was moved forward to our day snatched from patmas to see the end time Army the end time plan of God revealed and he wrote forward and backward what a what an amazing Revelation he received it was the apocalypsis it was the unveiling of Jesus Christ it's not the revelation of St John the Divine it's the revelation of Jesus Christ given to St John or John or whoever johanan John had to turn around and see he had to turn aside and see and he didn't want to see just see he said he wanted to see the voice Moses saw the sign but he had to turn aside to get a better look to get a closer a a a point a vantage point to examine it it's time for a turn it's time to make a turn brother random said if we just keep laying the bricks in a straight row when God turns the corner we're going to miss his appointment we're going to miss his Junction with us in time you hear what I'm saying and he said the problem is it takes a different skill it takes a different level of skill to be able to lay bricks in a straight L row got it understand and to turn the corner you got to know a little bit about cutting the brick and shaping the brick and making sure you don't destroy the brick because a corner has to be turned I'm telling you what a corner is turning it is turning it is turning I believe it'll be wrong I believe it'll be prophetically wrong for us to decree and declare that a turn is coming I believe it's wrong to decree that A change is coming I believe it's absolutely inappropriate to say What will will be I think it is more appropriate and more vital for us in the spirit as forerunners as prophetic people to now decree that it is turning the turning is now there is a turning we are not seeing the fullness but we're seeing things begin to turn change is not coming change is upon us bigger change the unfold oh oh oh oh the unfolding of change is coming more more understanding of change more dramatic change is coming but the change has started the time of the Lord is not next year the day of the Lord is not the end of another cycle don't you get weary of emails I get so weary of emails telling me all the time I can't keep up with it it's so overwhelming that when the Lord speaks like he did last night about a seven-year cycle we shut it off because we have heard so many emails read so many messages so many prophecies so many emails in three days things are turning in seven days there's going to be this change in in in 11 years we're going to see this in 15 years and in in in 18 moments hours seconds we're going to and we get so overwhelmed with the amount of of announcements of seasons and cycles that if we're not careful our heads will spin we'll fall victim to the confusion of the Babylonian Spirit and the next thing you know we will miss the times and seasons of the Lord and if we miss the issachar anointing to discern the times and seasons of the lord we will never operate in the zadok priesthood to be able to judge between row uh top to and raw good and evil never be able to without the issachar anointing the priesthood of zadok can never operate in the last time bride we got to have the ability to truly discern the times and the seasons and we need to know that we're hearing from voices who have been there and done that where are they that you're going to have to find that but we're going to have to be able to find and identify and recognize don't throw the baby out with the bath water just because you get 300 emails a month telling you that you're in this season that cycle this is about to change and that's going to change and this is going to change and I've been in the courtroom of heaven and I saw this and I'm going to go pull money up out of the bottom of the ocean and I'm going all this and I i' i' I've I've already killed the mermaid on your behalf and don't worry cuz I slayed the wear wolf last night and everything's going to be all right and tomorrow the Dollar's going to soore do not be conf confused by the confusion of Babylon the church may never have the grace to escape Babylon but there must be a bride there must be Sons there must be a holy Remnant that will hear the word of the Lord and come out of her and be separate sayeth the Lord and don't just change your location don't partake with her sin that's right what what Paul Keith told us the first night he was here that the pope said I I haven't I haven't I haven't got over it yet my head's still spinning for for for the largest religious organization on the on the face of the world and the Very man that believes and and and his millions of followers believe that he is Jesus Christ on the earth well the Catholic Church doesn't believe that they do they do believe that it's the inscription over his head in the stead of God they believe his words are infallible and he has no accountability to keep his words in line with the Scripture it sounds like the prophets of today very little accountability to keep their message in line with the word aren't you glad when God sends somebody into your life like these two men who are are making sure with the utmost of Integrity that their message is lining up with the word of God that there is a doveet tail there it may not draw the biggest crowd it may not make us all Swoon like women in a Beatles concert but it changes us it empowers us it strengthens us because the remnant bride receives strength when she is hooked up to the life IV when Zoe life is running through the IV brother we get life from a higher source in closing in closing musicians come slowly verse 16 Revelation 1 he had in his right hand Seven Stars out of his mouth one a sharp two-edged sword his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead good move John and he laid right his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last what was in the mouth of Jesus Christ what was in his mouth a sharp two-edged sword double-edged doesn't matter which way you swing it there's a sharp edge to meet the veil what was John's Veil fear what was moses' Veil what was the veil that needed to be removed from Moses that day on the mountain trusting in his own strength God showed up spoke out of that bush with a sword the veil fell off of his face spiritually and he said I can't survive without the strength of God I'm undone John saw Jesus in the fullness of his power standing in front of a bush John a bush absolutely he was standing in front of a seven branch Candlestick that we call the manora that's fashioned after the tree of life so what John saw was a bush not a bush but a bush a manora a holy manora that was fashioned after a tree seven branches how long PO he it been since you taught on the on the seven have you taught it in the last years you should go back and hear the teaching uh I almost called the name of the series you should go back and hear the teaching that he did on the seven spirits of God putting them on the manora putting them there it's powerful what John was seeing was was a similar scene to what what Moses saw he was seeing Jesus standing in the midst of a fiery Candlestick that represented a fiery Bush a fiery tree the tree of life that receives its strength from the life of God representing churches that were star Ed and founded drawing their strength from the life of God oh you foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you you used to draw your strength from the living source of life and now you draw your strength from other sources you think that you can finish in the flesh what was started in the spirit you fall into Jezebel's witchcraft you've been Bewitched by a controlling spirit that desires to keep you away from the IV to keep you away from the oh I guess you put an IV there or somewhere the IV of Life The Sword he came with a two-edged sword why because John had a veil that needed to be cut off Boy The Sword knows how to deal with a veil by the way it's the same sword in the Book of Genesis that turned itself in every direction that means it wasn't a metal sword it was a living sword it might have looked like a sword fashioned out of metal but the sword was alive there was life in it how do you know because it moved in all four directions it was a living sword it represent ented not a Written Letter it represented a Living Word it didn't just represent the Bible as a book it represented the Bible as a record of the Living Word of God turning moving why was it there to guard the way to keep the way to keep anyone from receiving eternal life in an illegitimate manner until the fullness of redemption had been purchased on the cross of Calvary because Adam had once known what it was like to live in the life of God now he was living Fallen Natural Life and God knew he wasn't going to forget what it was like to go to Eden to live in Eden to live in the garden of God there's a people that are being prepared in this hour to live back to the beginning back to that Pentecost you think I want to just go back and talk in tongues and prophesy no that's good I want all that you think I just want to go back to that no if that same life if that same spirit that rais Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will produce the same life in you It produced in him the life of Jesus Christ and when that bride Rises up when the Bride of Jesus Christ Rises up no longer drawing life from her own source from her own Natural Life Soul life but when she begins to draw her strength from the life of the spirit which is his life infused in US Hallelujah there'll be no compromise there'll be no mixture there will be no dueling profits there will be no day old prophets who prophesy after it's already fulfilled then they tell us what the Lord showed them but there will be sons of issachar with the anointing of times and Seasons there'll be a priesthood of zadok that will rise up judging the toen raah there will be the sons manifested with authority and the power of the creative spoken word there will be a people people released from the prison of their own making thinking that they can do anything good enough to be right with God that's the prison that people need to get out of it's the P the prison of religious works why don't you aim in that it's a prison of thinking that your Works will make you holy your Works will make you righteous it's a lie it's a dirty LIE there's only one thing that will make you righteous you've got to be like the bush what did the bush do nothing he just yielded I don't know if I like the sound of that of course not because it's hard for us to get to the place that once we've been saved by the blood of Jesus Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word filled and baptized with the walking talking Holy Ghost now we think we got to keep on working keep on moving keep on finding things that will make us Holier and righteous and so forth and kind of like what brother Caleb was talking to us about yesterday and I believe in Holiness and I believe in righteousness and when you see my wife you know that we are not interested in the fads and Fashions of this world I have no desire when people come here and they see the way these folk look and dress and act their first response is there must be legalism in this house if you think what I'm preaching this morning morning is legalism you don't know the definition of legalism what I'm preaching this morning is that your religious Works will bind you that will bind you but there is freedom and there is Liberty in the sound of the chofar not only is the devil scattered but every slave when he hears the sounding of that trumpet he no longer has to hoe in Pharaoh's Garden I have HED my last row of corn for Pharaoh I have holded my last row of corn for denominational hierarchy and Bishops and Lords over God's flock no more will I hoe another row of corn to please man I have heard the sound of the Jubilee the Lord himself has descended from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and the last Trumpet Of God and he is on his way he's on his way why would I want to spend the next seven years of my life or next 12 months of my life hoing corn to build the church when Jesus is on his way in fact he's here building his bride delivering her from the idea that you can do it on your own power what was the veil that was cut off of John closing what was the veil that was cut off of John's face it's easy very very easy fear fear John was veiled with fear he couldn't see the end time because of fear the word of the Lord is not to bring carnal solish fear that's tied to condemnation the word of God brings conviction the spirit life brings help and hope religion brings condemnation say Amen this is not the reverential fear of the Lord that took John on his face how do you know that how do you know that he didn't fall before this Jesus in the C in reverential fear because Jesus would not have rebuked his fear if it was Godly fear that's right the Bible tells us that the fear of the Lord is a beginning of wisdom you think God Jesus was going to to correct instruct John if he was laying there in Godly fear and in wisdom no the veil of fear was going to keep John from going any farther it's it's nice it's nice that he recognized I'm in the presence of something bigger than I am the problem is if he fell in reverential fear and got up in solish fear fear he wouldn't have been able to go for forward in the Revelation that Jesus had for him so the veil had to come and and God made sure it did cuz in Jesus was a was a sword in his mouth he didn't just see him standing in the Candlestick of fire he saw a sword in his mouth why do you think Jesus showed up with a sword in his mouth to cut the veil away cuz the sword that once guarded the way protected the way to eternal life has now showed up in this hour The Living Word of God is here it's on the earth it's in the bride The Living Word of God is Among Us it's the same sword the sword of the Lord and it is not here to to guard the way so that we don't get in the Living Word of the Lord the sword of the Lord is now in the body of Christ if we yield to it it's it's in us or do we see the full man no but but are we waiting on it no are we going to prophesy that it's coming next year the next the next the next the next the next no we're going to are we going to be thermometers and tell people how dark and evil and ugly it is no we're going to be thermostats we're going to reach in by the word of God we're going to see what God Said is coming and we're going to prophesy it as though it were here because that's what prophets do they don't just foretell what's coming they get a hold of what's coming and they decree it and announce it and and release it on the earth am how do people access it if it hasn't been fully manifested the same way you access everything you've ever gotten from God by what faith you hear the word you hear these men say what God wants to do your faith is what has to reach up and take that word and it and it become a revelation to you let's stand together it's amazing to me Moses turned heard the voice John turned heard the voice what's left what must we do we must turn when we hear the voice that says I want to reveal myself to you I want to show you that there's more to who I am and the only way you're ever going to be able to know who you really are in me is to identify Who I Really Am how do we know what's coming to us how do we know what we have an inheritance to if we don't fully understand what he is who he is if we don't fully understand Christ how can we understand what it means to be in Christ or come from Christ or be a part of Christ how will we ever have Union if we continue to draw our strength from our own natural smarts or our own physical ability or lack thereof the only way we'll ever be able to operate as God has created us to operate in Tove is to let the sword of the Lord come and cut the veil of of trusting in self self you know persever uh uh preservation self-preservation I can do this my strength like Peter sometime who forgot what was in him and tried to trust his own strength to do the work of the Lord like Moses who thought he could deliver the children of Israel by killing one Egyptian none of that is going to operate and work properly in our lives in this hour and there's a sword to deal with it are we going to be able to move forward in fear if we're fear to if we have a fear to hear if we have a fear to see if we have a fear to reexamine what we believe if we have a fear to follow the pillar of fire because it might lead us out of our comfort zone how will we ever go forward in what God has called us to be we won't but that's all right because the the Lord is showed up the word is showed up it's here it's with us the message that you've been hearing this week the truths that have been coming what you've been feeding on for years now many of you has shown up it's here the sword will deal with it if you'll if you'll surrender if you'll yield what did the bush do yield you've got to yield your life to his life you've got to say I can't do it hardest thing for a man to say I can't best thing you could ever say I can't but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world can you say Amen changed his face John's face was changed Moses face was changed there's a whole message there for another time another place did you notice that when Moses came down off the mountain with the fire with the with this countenance changed by the glory of the Lord in Exodus 34:30 it talks about the skin of his face shining and they were afraid to come n to him and Moses never told them any different Moses didn't say don't be afraid he left them right where they were because that was another Covenant he left them in their fear he left them in their reverence he made sure they didn't come any closer but that's not what Jesus said Jesus said to John fear not there's something on the other side of this sphere that I want you to see so get up tune your ear to my voice turn your eyes to what I want to unveil reveal and show you I'm the vine brother brandom said if this Vine ever puts forth another branch of its own which means its own life you can graph branches in that's what people constantly try to do they try to make a Pentecostal experience operate on a Baptist life or a or a or a charismatic experience operate on a Pentecostal life or we get all so confused and and so we've got so many different things Gra it in that's why this religious system is not only something to be concerned about but all those daughters who look just like her you look at the Book of Revelation once you get out of Genesis and you'll see that that great that great religious system that will deceive the nation had daughters and on her were written the names of blasphemy boy that sounds like Doom and Gloom it would only sound like Doom and Gloom if you're identifying on the other side of this thing I'm identifying on the side of this thing that wins come on Blasphemous names were in her because all she wanted to do was model herself after her mother we just want to be like her we just want to do things right and and do it just like no there's got to be a people that say we want to hear the word of the Lord and we want to adjust our lives because we want every Veil removed and the only way every Veil is going to be removed that prevents us is for the sword of the Lord that represents the Living Word of God to be operative in our lives to cut away the fear to cut away all the self-reliance how many of you'd like you're just willing to say Lord I'd like the sword of the Lord the sword of the revealed word of God the revelation of Jesus Christ I don't want to hear a sermon I want a message to come forth into my spirit that activates the seeds of Destiny and purpose I want to move out of the land of raw into the land of Tove I want to come from a Barren Place into a place of fruitfulness and so I yield myself put your hands up if you feel like you can I yield myself to the life of the fire I want the fire to fall and bring with it the life of God I want to survive from the life of God in organic Union with the life of God I want to become one with the Living Word of God I don't want to draw my life from my Christian Roots from my denominational roots from my history I I want to draw my life from the fire of God that brings the life here's the scripture we'll take home with us that the Apostle said it was so beautiful that some of us kind of missed it I know I did I know I missed it let me see if I can can put it here Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life that you now see me living the Apostle said this life which I now live in the flesh is not my natural life I now live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me aren't those beautiful love letters isn't that a beautiful love word I tell you what we're going to do we're going to let you go of course it's so important uh that we go on because we want to be prepared for the meeting tonight but if you're here and you'd say I am willing to submit my life to the sword of the Lord to the burning sword of the Lord which represents the Living Word of God I'm willing to lay all my thoughts my ideas my my I my my my Visions my Revelations my understandings my traditions my my everything I'm willing to lay that on the Altar and let the fire of the Lord and the sword of the Lord remove all the veils remove all the the Flesh and leave on the table for me the truth of who I am and what I am to move forward in in the last days if you feel that call on your life would you just step out of the aisle you don't have to come forward but would you just step out in the aisle to identify yourself as someone who is willing completely to be evaluated by The Living Word of God by the sword of the spirit of the Lord uh that these messages that we heard and have and will hear tonight and tomorrow that they don't just go over us and bless us externally but we want a word my I feel the spirit of God now we want a word that penetrates the flesh life the soul life we want a word that brings Resurrection to the spirit we want our fallen Spirit to to be absolutely resurrected back into its original life amen God has come the word has come the revelation of Jesus Christ has come to restore us to original life how many of you like to have that life that Adam had oh my more than that more than that is available so let's just pray you that are standing in the aisle right now just pray as they as they just Place something to help us with an atmosphere you just talk to the Lord right now and you tell the Lord I'm not putting any more words in your mouth you tell the Lord that you desire for him to evaluate your life and where you stand and your belief system by the revealed word of God let's do that right now as individuals Jesus Jesus here we are here we are Lord you have fed us this week you have fed us through soses through webinars through conferences through CDs through DVDs through cassettes Lord our feeding goes way back your word has been so rich but what we fear is that we might have allowed some of it not to be able to penetrate because of veils of our own belief system and veils of our own fear and veils of our own trusting in our strength and power in flesh to do it and the thoughts that works would work so Lord we come before you today individually individually We Stand ha Glory individually We Stand surrendering to the revealed word of God surrendering to the sword of the Lord the sword that no longer stands in position to guard the way it now stands in position to lead the way for those who have a heart to understand eyes to see ears to hear Mand preaching won't do it teaching won't do it prophecy won't do it it's only by the revelation of the holy spirit that our eyes can be open to see what you want us to see and we desire Lord Revelation that changes us and transforms us from glory to glory from strength to strength from Faith to Faith we're desperate here this morning tell him tell him more of you Lord if we could just walk out the instruction that you've already laid Upon Our Lives we would be so extremely blessed if you just launch us if you just let us take this thing forward and demonstrate it with our lives M it's really more of you we desire we're not looking for another touch we're looking for the transforming power of your word and Revelation to to mold us to make us to shape us to change us we lay our rotten attitudes before you we we lay our opinions before you we lay our desire to control and manipulate with Christian witchcraft we lay that before you we surrender our gifts back to the one who gave them we say Lord if we can't use them in the genuine flow of your spirit without mixture we don't want them if you'll release the the purity of your word and the grace to operate the gifts as you would operate them and not as we would do it in the flesh and if that can't happen we we release them we surrender them we cannot survive in our own strength and power if this Vine ever puts forth another branch of its own life the life of Jesus Christ there would have to be another book of Acts written to record the glory to record the miracle to record the power that the spoken creative word of God would accomplish in the earth one of the greatest if not the greatest Ministries since the days of the Apostles and he stood as a humble servant and said the world is yet to see what God can accomplish in one man who is fully surrendered Lord if brother brandham didn't model what it looks like to be a Son of God manifested I have no idea where to look if his ministry was not an example of what a full adopted son of God looks like I would not even begin to know who to follow who to learn from who to listen to but if he was an example to us then we need a bride to raise up in the same Glory same Authority same power not in the same office office but in the same Authority with the same word in our mouths to bring forth the proof to bring forth a demonstration that we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he appears in his full perusia presence that we will be like him we will know him because we will be like him made fashion and created In His Image Hallelujah not as created sons of God but as Spirit born sons of God we love you Lord we love you Lord we love you Lord we love you Lord I I just release you in a moment too but right now I just release the the Tove word of the Lord over you I want you to know right now that there are things in your life seeds of Destiny and purpose that are in your life that have already began to sprout and bring forth and Satan is trying to talk you out of a Tove existence and into a raw place where you doubt what God has already started in you tell the Devil he's a liar tell him right now if you're struggling in that area tell him you're not going to hold my mind you're not going to hold me captive I may not be in full Harvest mode I may not be bringing forth all the seeds of purpose and Destiny that have been created and planted in me but Lord I want to glory and celebrate what you have started in me I celebrate the fruit that has come forth with anticipation for the fruit that will come forth glory be to God do you want to praise the Lord for what he has already done in your life Jesus let's do that right now quickly hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to the lamb I've had it all but what I've got to have is more of the Lord praise the Lord
