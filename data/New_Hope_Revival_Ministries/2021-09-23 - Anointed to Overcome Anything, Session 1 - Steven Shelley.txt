instructed in our day that if the lord jesus christ was standing right here tonight that he could do no more for you than he has already done it is a matter of our faith reaching up and grabbing a hold of the finished work of calvary hallelujah we're going to take time tonight to hear your requests if you have a spoken need the rest of the week if you have a need that is urgent and you want us

ventilator we've got a lot to be thankful for how wonderful [Music] we sure would like to see more of them and i know that god knows exactly what he's doing we want you to turn in your bibles if you will to first john chapter 2. i'll tell you that i've been brother greeley mentioned i'm fighting a little something in my body but i tell you it's not mine doesn't belong to me it's a trespasser it has to go and uh so you'll just have to forgive me for a dry mouth it's even worse when it's like this but we got lots of water bottles we have spoken to the our former amish saints and they are making their way here starting tomorrow there will be a van of about 15 of them arriving for the service tomorrow night and by the time they all get here on friday brother elam told me there'll be about 35 of them well that means you're going to have to scrunch up maybe wouldn't that be wonderful and uh they are very excited to be here and i'm very excited to have them here and i'm very happy to have the millers here at the same time you all met brother elam and didn't he have lunch with you all in tucson and so they're going to have fellowship well it's just going to be wonderful and but we want to pray for them every mile of the journey that god will bring them safely first john chapter 2 verse 12 and 13 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father the next verse i have written unto you fathers because you have known that is from him you have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because you're strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one that seems to be a repeat there doesn't it love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him can you say amen for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world and the world passeth away and the last the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever do you believe that one more verse little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time i don't have any doubt that the apostle believed that he was living in the very last of the last days how much more can we say about ourselves we are living in the latest hour the last of the last days and the grace that was shown to them that they might overcome is the same grace that god is extending to you and i if you believe that same man bow your head just a moment father how we thank you tonight for this service already for everyone that has gathered here in your name and lord i'm here uh reporting for duty believing that somehow you would help me to get out of the way with all that's going on i don't want to be a hindrance at all to the flow of your word let it come forth tonight let it accomplish that which it is sent forth to do let it break every yoke let it silence every demonic power let your word come and liberate your people that we might know that freedom that we sung about tonight we know it's not an emotion it's not a feeling but freedom is like resurrection it's a person that's the fullness of you lord our lord jesus christ help us tonight bless those who are yet to travel this way let angels line the highways bless these precious ones who'll be going back to lagrange tonight thank you lord for their safety all the way we ask it in the name above every name the name of our lord jesus christ and the saints said you may be seated this evening help me preach would you then i can hurry up i want to speak tonight on how to overcome anything that's a broad subject isn't anything you you say brother shelly anything yes anything i'm going to take god at his word tonight i'm going to believe that if he said i have overcome the world and you can too then i'm going to believe that everything that's in this life that troubles you hinders you impedes your growth in any way that there is an answer there is a remedy there is an anointing there is a deliverance so that you might come over it so that it will no longer be a barrier in your life how many of you have ever had barriers well we all have had barriers and some of us are sitting here this evening and our life is hemmed in it looks like that we are we turn to the left and there is uh all the mountains we turn to the right like the children of israel they're the mountains we look behind us and it's pharaoh's army approaching from the rear we look ahead and we see the red sea in front of us and we say lord i'm hemmed in i'm hindered on every side what will i do but the answer is the same today as it was then moses got a word of unction from the lord help me and he said stand still [Applause] get your eyes off those mountains get your eyes off those boulders get your eyes off of your enemy don't you look at that red sea in front of you stand still and see the salvation of the lord and that great pillar of fire it came swirling down from eternity didn't it and divided the red sea and uh i never talk about that never mention the red sea without thinking about that little granny can i tell it one more time the the you know a new a new graduate of some bible cemetery somewhere was in the pulpit preaching and he felt it necessary to explain away all the supernatural powers of god and if there was a miracle mentioned he had a natural explanation for every miracle and this one old granny i have i have a few grannies around here that be just like this you don't have to call any names but you know i got a few that'd be just like this this little granny heard it till she couldn't take it no more she she knew that you know this is the new way and he's not going nowhere but i don't have to just sit back and be quiet i can say something about it and so he said well don't you all know that this time of the year the red sea said i don't really mean red sea it's the reed see it's a sea of reeds and he said it's only about ankle just a little bit higher than ankle deep and so he said yes it was a wonderful thing that happened but not quite the miracle that we have always perceived it was because basically they walked across in ankle deep water how many of you know better than that and that little granny got so excited she jumped up and she began to shout and praise the lord look what he did look what he did look what he did the pastor he got real agitated with her and he said little sister yes the lord is good but did you hear how i just explained to you that that wasn't quite the supernatural miracle that we'd always thought it was that in fact they were just passing through a little bit of ankle not even to the knees of water and so that millions of people that came through there well that was some she just started shouting again hallelujah yes i heard you praise the lord look what he did look what he did and she said pastor she said i want you to think about this okay maybe it wasn't a great supernatural miracle like we always thought that they crossed in water that was way up over their heads but she said my what kind of a god did it take to drown pharaoh's army all of his soldiers all of his horses turned over all of his chariots she said look what god has done she found a way to give him praise didn't you and that is the truth there are some things you can't explain away i don't care how deep the water was i know the pillar of fire came down and the job was taken care of so it really doesn't matter how deep your stuff is it doesn't really matter how big your obstacle is it doesn't really matter what's standing in your way there is a way to overcome anything and if you want to take it a little further you can say there's a way to overcome everything nothing should stand in our way as children of the most high god i might just pau i might just it is nothing but the truth do we have troubles oh yes i don't think i'm denying that do we have problems sure we do do things hinder us on the way just about every day if you get through a whole day without a hindrance of some kind you must be living under a rock somewhere because if i have to move about where people are if i happen to catch the news if i happen to hear people talking in the store somewhere like sister sharon requested prayer tonight for fear there will be a hindrance on every side and i found out that some of us have gotten so good at it if we don't have enough hindering us today we reach way back and we'll preach a minute we reach way back to something that we dealt with years and years ago and we choose to remain hindered by something that we've already walked through did you make it okay if it was ten years ago did you make it did you press through did you overcome somehow are you still alive have you still been hearing from the lord is the king still talking to you if he is there's no reason to reach back and grab a hold of what god has already given you the victory over somebody said but i don't feel the victory i want to tell you what i what i told the class today was my last uh session i've been doing a class in in england in europe uh every wednesday by zoom at two o'clock uh and it's just been a wonderful experience for me and before we were getting the zoom set up uh the host just said uh stephen i know you sound a little star how are you feeling and and normally i would have probably said well better than i was yesterday or something along that line but i said what does feelings have to do with it and they she just laughed i'm telling you she said that is exactly right and that's why we stay in the stuff that god has already brought us out because we have feelings and memories and affections and reasonings that are attached to it but i want you to know tonight i'm not going to tell you anything you don't already know i'm setting the theme i'm just establishing what we are looking to receive from the lord this week a reminder that there is nothing no nothing that we cannot make our way through or over or under or around or however it is that god wants to get us through it if he brought you to it he's obligated himself to bring you through it can you say amen talk to your stuff talk to it they say you you didn't come to stay nothing in my life come to stay except jesus everything else just passes through but jesus has come to stay hallelujah and we know that there's great victory when we place our faith in god's word are you ready to help me the word overcome i love the way that the apostle was addressing these various uh segments of the believer speaking to the fathers to the elderly to those who who walked so in tune with the law that they were looking for god to show up and do something and while many of their brethren miss the coming of messiah there were some elders in this group that didn't miss his coming they knew who he was from a long way back they'd read every promise they'd heard every prophecy that was made concerning that messiah and though their church couldn't receive him and some of their family couldn't receive him the apostle mentions that there were some who knew him from far off you have known him that is from the beginning i'm telling you they recognized him to be their messiah uh josh i especially like tonight how the apostle addresses the young men i called your name i could have called david or or jesse or or austin or anybody else although austin is moving up a little bit in age you know but everybody is right and so they were addressed in such a in such a special way he said i write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one let me say that again i want you listening to me i write unto you young men because you have you have overcome the wicked one now this was god's apostle and he moved also in in prophetic things because all apostles do gifted by the spirit and so i believe that he could have said well you're doing very well now we're going to see how you do in the future you're you're on top of the mountain uh today but we don't know what might happen in your life you you might throw in the towel and forsake what you stood so strongly on uh some years back but he didn't say any of that church he said i write unto you because you have overcome the wicked one he has already been defeated in your life there's no reason for me to believe that he's going to be able to overtake you now you know i want that confidence in me i want that confidence in myself that because of who i belong to i have overcome the world by him i want to be able to look at my brothers and sisters and say hey i don't care what they face i don't care what may come their way i can say with boldness and confidence they have already overcome the wicked one why because they chose to ignore the lies of the enemy they chose to agree with god's word they chose not to be hindered for for drawn out periods of time but to seek god for a way to get out or a way to get over and so there's so much that we could we could read and i spent some time studying and it would take weeks to go into that and but i want to move on in first john chapter five beginning in verse four i want you to read four and five with me for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world is that right how do you know that we're going to overcome the world because we are born of god maybe we should just establish this tonight is there anybody here that's born of god you are we're born of god it's the born against experience it's the promise it's it's meeting him it's the very thing that nicodemus was missing he wanted to have a personal experience with god he wasn't satisfied with just his religious existence or what he had been familiar with in the past he wanted to know god in a personal way and so he asked the lord how do we do this oh the answer came you must be born again which means born from above born from heaven born of god for whatsoever is born of god does what overcometh the world now listen carefully and this is the victory this is the victory that overcometh the world this is the victory that overcometh the world what even our faith even our faith i'll tell you that's a powerful promise who is he who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god oh hallelujah now i want you to know that's not a head belief that's not just a head knowledge we rub shoulders with people all around us at all times who would tell you right now jesus is the son of god and he died to save the world but that doesn't mean that they've been born again it doesn't mean they've ever had that personal experience with him these apostles are talking to those who have been transformed from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light and they've accomplished that by surrendering and yielding their lives to the lord jesus christ can i share a quotation or two with you this evening i know it's a camp meeting i know there are some of you who don't study the message of brother branham as we do but i want to i want to place these in here as well i can't help it i can't help it because these are the things that inspire me and push me and cause me to keep fighting in this whole world around us in a message called faith is our victory paragraph 59 i want you to listen carefully he said did not i tell you not to doubt he said to jairus that night or that day if you'll only believe only believe you can see the glory of god church i know that you will overcome if you'll just only believe if you'll just keep applying your faith i know not will little children i write unto you because you have overcome the wicked one he said you can see the glory of god if you'll only believe he said then faith overcomes death you believe that oh i do faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness now just put your finger there this isn't faith in faith this isn't saying faith my faith is in my faith now that won't work this is faith in the living god you see faith is not a good luck charm faith doesn't operate superstitiously it's faith that is properly grounded in the word of god and when you have that kind of faith and i perceive that you do tonight faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over is that a word flusterations have you ever been somewhere between a fluster and a frustration that is a flustration when you're between a fluster and a frustration and the prophet is telling us here tonight the answer to overcome that is exactly the same way it is all these other things faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory over the world can you say man now in a message called spiritual amnesia just stay with me in birmingham alabama i like this so much worry has no virtue to it at all we sure do give a whole lot of time to something that has no virtue and no ability to accomplish anything in our life worry has no virtue in it at all just skip worry and accept faith somebody said well you you know to say it like that it makes it so simple brother it is simple it's one decision at a time it's one obstacle at a time it's one trial at a time it's one flusteration at a time each time you meet the enemy in whatever form he shows up you make a decision in that moment i will not waste my life with worry i will not waste my life with anxiety in this moment i choose faith faith is the answer to the to whatever the situation is he said just skip worry and accept faith someone said well now what if you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry you know that that's funny i'm gonna tell you why it's funny not because it's silly it's funny because it's just like us we're crossing bridges we hadn't got to yet we're worrying about situations that we may never face we're blocked and hindered and that we have obstacles that aren't even real they're mirages they're not even real there's something not some i'm not saying that every time the enemy comes he's not laying something real in your path often he is but that's not what i'm talking about with worry worry is most often attached to something that may not even come to pass if you're faced with a situation and you're worrying you're worrying about the outcome don't you know god's got that don't you know he has the answer for whatever's going on he said well what if you knew we're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry i said no don't think so why i said worry couldn't do nothing but make me worse i wish somebody i'm not expecting you all to but i wish somebody look at your neighbor and say worry can't do anything but make you worse it doesn't change a thing it doesn't move one symptom out of the way it doesn't solve one problem and it cheats you out of the victory that your faith can accomplish if you'll invest your faith instead is that right he said well what good is it going to do to have faith i said it might deliver me and that's right see faith might pull me out of the situation altogether i may not even have to face what i'm worried about because faith may move that right out of the way or move me out of the way all right it might deliver me and that's right see so worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue remember in peter it tells us to add to our faith what to add to our faith virtue believe not now worry sometime excuse me now worry sometime cause it and he goes on into another thought we're not going to follow him there let me do another one this is called faith is our victory it's a long one but you're here and we won't have to be late but we're going to take time to get this out because whatever god is giving to brother brooks on our behalf we want to come in here without any hindrances in our spirit at all our mind cleared because we are fully trusting in the lord you leave your problem at the door and you might find when you get back to it it's not even there if you find that it's there you'll meet that challenge like we've met all the other challenges of our life since we were born of the spirit of god we will meet that challenge by faith if you believe that say amen now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer how so uh if we looked at the theme of this meeting how to overcome anything how faith faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it's it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith itself overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world he said what does it do what is faith what is to conquer conquer and victory is the same oh my we can have victory we can have victory this week we can have victory tonight faith can accomplish the victory faith can give us the grace to conquer and to overcome he said to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that the sin that once ruled you come on i want you to read that in every place in your life where unbelief used to reign you have dispossessed that enemy by taking god at his word you have driven that enemy out of the land and where every sin once ruled your life you now rule it somebody said i don't feel like a ruler i don't feel like a conqueror i don't feel like an overcomer that's not what we're here to talk about tonight because feelings can come and feelings can go but truth will always be truth and here's the truth jesus christ the same yesterday help me and today and forever it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it [Music] you've whimped it we know not in our own strength you've whipped it you are greater than it is oh i feel religious right now he said which was first a sinner or a savior the answer a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin no sin no unbelief no attribute of unbelief is greater or bigger than his power to deliver the sinner he is a savior do you believe that he said which was first the healer or a sickness he said it couldn't be a healer unless he was over the sickness it is a healer it can conquer the sickness if the healer came first then we know it conquers sickness every time if the savior came first we know that it conquers sin every time let's read on just a bit and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith is the victory hallelujah faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your creed not faith in some man not even a prophet not even apostle not even your pastor but faith where hallelujah why is that so important because he's the one that made the promise he said that's the victory what is it it is the victory faith in jesus christ is the victory that overcomes the world hallelujah we know that because we see it right here all right it goes on 65 when you can climb into god by prayer until you see the thing conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then i want to just pause a moment because we're always seeing ourselves we see ourselves i'm not just talking about our physical form in the mirror we we are always seeing ourself and we see ourselves in certain ways and that's why people own things that do not belong to them they use it as a crutch sometimes i've used it i've done it there's no condemnation in my voice i've used it too we can use that like a crutch sometime to lean on instead of getting down to where the rubber meets the road your testimony will have far more effectiveness in this world if you will take god at his word and daily allow your faith in god to conquer every situation that's trying to overcome you again you do it one decision at a time and one praise at a time i choose to take god at his word and i praise you lord that you've never failed me yet i choose to take god at his word and i praise you lord that you've never failed me i choose to take god at his word and i praise you lord that as you have brought me through every time before i know that i know that i know in whom i have believed and i know that he's given me power to overcome anything and everything no matter what color it is no matter what it looks like no matter how ugly it is no matter how huge it may be your faith in god will give you the victory if you'll take him at his word every time every time don't we preach this a lot every time we got to we've got to be reminded why because we're in that greatest battle ever fought we're going to get to something in a minute i i know i got to hurry but we're going to get to something in a minute he said until you see the thing conquered under you there's nothing that can hurt you then you've overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room nothing's closing in on you once you have made up your mind you're sailing free then you believe that he said you who have been a drunkard and a slave to whiskey you'll be the master over him then that old devil of alcohol that made you drink he's your master now but when you get faith i don't mean make believe real faith he's your servant then oh i give you power over over some of the powers of evil no he said i give you power over all the power all the power of the enemy over spiritual principalities over spiritual wickedness and high places nothing shall stand in your way is your faith real is your god real are you putting your real faith in the hands of a real god then he is our victory he is our victory he's your servant then i love that stay with me i love that i love the thought of someone being bound for years under some heavy oppression and all of a sudden coming through to victory and saying wait a minute devil you who has held me all these years you're under my foot now you're never getting out from under my foot he said a woman that's sitting present now she has been at this altar time after time after time listen now because you may be like this little woman you might be just like her ah that's not what i have next okay there we go no yeah a little woman that's sorry oh you're so good to help me go back to 67. you can't lay down it's really hard for me when i look up there and then look down here to know where i am forgive me i'm just a flawed vessel you who can't lay down tobacco you women and men when it comes to a place to where you can get to that spot to where you have overcome it by faith you'll master it then you know what i love about that statement there's no condemnation in that here's a man a sinner saved by grace who understands the struggles of life who knows that there are people being held by alcohol their people being held by tobacco or whatever the attribute of sin is because we preach in this church that all these things are attributes of sin they all stem out of the real sin and the real sin is unbelief and when you can conquer unbelief and take god at his word and believe he'll do what he said he'll do there's no room for the attributes of sin to manifest in your life it causes you to want to walk a holy walk it causes you to want to live sanctified and set apart for the use of the master are you with me when it comes to a play all right a little woman that's sitting present now want you to hear it because you may be like this little woman she's been at this altar time after time after time a good woman but she started smoking a long time ago and she just couldn't overcome it and she had come up and i'd pray with her and seemed like she just couldn't overcome it and the first thing you know i told her here i said there will be danger down the road she said brother branham i've cried i have begged you see just emotional i want you to notice this next phrase here doing what fighting the air this shadow boxing is never going to get the job done we are not those who fight against the air we know who our enemy is and we know how to defeat him by the authority of jesus christ but here there's a woman fighting the air that won't do any good and i'd get down and pray with her and lay hands on her and she'd go back a few days i'd meet her again just knock you down the cigarette smoke hand still brown this was a woman really bound and one night down yonder she went to the doctor began to get sick and wither away till just a little spindly thing the doctor looked into her and said cancer smoking cigarettes there she was laying there to die then she got down to business i want you to hear what the prophet's saying all that praying in the altar all those times she went up for the pastor to pray for him and yet the prophet saying now she got down to business what was she doing all the rest of the time he tells us fighting the air [Applause] you you can't just get mad you gotta know where to get mad and who to turn your anger against and it's not god it's not your brother it's not your church it's not your pastor it's the one who wants to bind you until you are overcome instead of you being the overcomer she was laying there about to die she got down to business are you still here good good good good all right see a drowning man will reach for a straw long as you can walk out of the church tonight know you can go join the methodist baptist as long as you can sit here and say i'm a good person there's nothing wrong with me yeah you can't do nothing with you that's right all right it goes on but when you see your sins as god sees them in the light of his bible when you see you'll repent or perish something will take place you'll get to business anybody here he said walk out of here smothering around your heart the doctor back there maybe raise up and come look at it it's a heart attack you'll get to business that's when she had to get to business and the woman sitting looking at me right now and brother roberson back there mr wood and brother wood sitting here and he goes on to talk about some other thing he said and the holy spirit seemed to move us to go way through the knobs to where she was and when i got there she had had a dream he's talking about hunting and getting this leadership of the lord to go and pray and when the holy spirit came into the room she got down to real business she never smoked a cigarette from then on and she has gained many pounds of weight and they can't find a trace of cancer [Music] she didn't have to get good enough to get healed from cancer she just had to apply her faith to the only god to the only force to the only answer for her situation come on she was not laboring to get to rest she was laboring to get rid of cigarettes you'll spin your wheels if you choose something and that's all you you focus on i got to get rid of that i got to overcome that i got to do this i got to bring that down and you focus on one thing let me tell you something you'll beat the air you'll stay in that vicious cycle people come along they say oh i've had so many bad experiences in church i want you to know i understand i have to you know why you've had so many problems in church because people go there you'd had problems with the cotton meal if you spend as much time in the cotton mill as you do church you're going to have problems in the cotton mill if you spend as much time at walmart and some of you do as you do at church you're going to have problems at walmart problems are where people are problems will follow you amen but despising church is not the answer no don't you dare do that don't you put the blame on hypocrites because when people will give the excuse i can't go to church because there's so many hypocrites there the the most tragic reality is you are placing those hypocrites closer to god than you are you're saying i can't get over or around the hypocrites then you're placing him in a closer position to god than you are let me tell you the answer to how to overcome people get your eyes off of people and get your eyes on jesus would somebody help me preach some of you are sitting here tonight some of you are streaming this service tonight struggling in a manner you do not have to struggle until we make up our mind to get down to business and to get our eyes off of one another and get our eyes on jesus we're going to be like a bunch of shadow we're just going to be beating the air and never getting the victory i've got to have the victory i've laid out some things this week folks that i have to have the victory over personal things i like to be transparent but i'll just be real honest with you some of it is so so me and nothing to do with you until i'm just going to be real honest and say it's none of your business but i have laid it before the lord something that i know is controlling me i'll just say it this way i'll get forwards out before it's over i'll spit it out something that i know is controlling me instead of me controlling it that's what it is something personal that i know has more authority at times i give it i yield it i let that determine how things turn out instead of going to him i'm not preaching as someone who's made it all the way and now i can reach back down to you and tell you how oh no i'm preaching to you tonight as somebody that's fighting the same battles that you're fighting living in the same satan's eden that you're living in under the same level to see in church age spirit that you're living under mine may smell different or look different or sound a little bit different than yours but it's the same devil how many of you believe that whatever you just keep the bible tells us that when we focus our attention and our affection because where your attention goes your affection will follow love not the world he said a little while longer love not the world neither the things of the world if you keep your eyes on the world your affection is going to be on the world you're going to love the world if we will choose to look at truth truth is a person truth isn't a book truth is a person truth is on board when we're born of god when we've yielded our lives to jesus christ truth is in us it abides with us and i have laid some things out before the lord this week for this week and i've written them down you don't have to do like me you should you should expose the devil in your own life you don't have to show me i don't have a backwards collar on today i'm not here to take your confession i don't even need to know what you're fighting with you don't have to know what i deal with i'm writing it down so i can't change my mind i'm writing it down so i can keep bringing it before the lord if the if the theme of these meetings no matter what the preacher preaches is how to overcome anything then by sunday afternoon i am fully expecting i'm telling you my testimony i am fully expecting to be a conqueror over everything that has conquered me why because i didn't come up with the theme the holy spirit revealed why i'm calling you together i want you to know how to overcome anything i said to the brothers but that don't i know that don't sound just right that's how it came to me but that don't just sound right i don't want to just say everything i want to say anything because my anything is different than your anything and everything just feels like a catch-all i want you to specifically either share with the lord or as i have write it down and say i have no intention of being under the control of this thing sunday afternoon i don't know what god's going to do i don't know how he's going to do it shackles may fall off on us from us when we're dancing oh yes well i don't believe in behaving like that uh we weren't really making an interview here to find out what you believed i believe in dancing i believe in jumping i believe in clapping my hands i believe in shouting unto the lord with the voice of triumph i'm going to dance i'm going to give god praise it may be in one of those moments when we're worshiping sister beth that we just shake off those shackles or whatever it is whatever your anything looks like it might be like that somebody said well that ain't likely i have a tendency to agree with you because you know right now whether right now you know whether you have any intention [Music] of going all the way with him i'm not saying you have to dance oh no no no no no i'm not saying you have to dance i'm not saying you have to jump i'm not saying you have to speak in tongues but i will say that most of us know right now what's likely and what's not likely it might be for somebody that just breaks out and takes a run a lap around this church well somebody said well they've done that before and it might not have shifted i'm just telling you with a theme like how to overcome anything it may come when brother brooks is up here singing like a i tell you what he blesses me i took a little video there on the front row of him last year beating the tambourine you know paul wes bought him a tambourine and he leaves it here and last year i think it was we asked him to autograph it so we've got his signature on it and he's been beating a tambourine since the late 80s when i met him to worship the lord and i've been in service this where he got a little criticism for that can you imagine [Music] you sitting on your hands oh pious and you're gonna dare criticize somebody for ringing a tambourine my god what kind of religious spirit are you under what in the world has got a hold of you come on like some people will uh view a video or they may come and what's that waving them flags and stringing them banners through the air and doing all that i'd never catch myself doing that just like i said just like i said you pretty well know what you're going to do for this thing's over i want you to know something tonight if i could guarantee you the victory over that thing this that's holding you back by by jumping up here and waving a flag i know you'd be standing in line some of you still wouldn't do it because you're determined not to budge but i know that you'll be standing in line if you thought for one minute that taking a little bit of faith and saying god i need you to know [Music] somebody said well what if it's what if it's blue or purple or i don't care what color it is it can be your flag of surrender and you don't have to have a banner to wave a flag of surrender you may be standing at your seat while brother uh brooks is worshiping the lord and i said a minute ago i took a little video of and tens of thousands of people have watched that video i don't know i don't even remember the number but tens of thousands of people have watched that little video and i read some of the most wonderful it's been a year now i read some of the most wonderful comments from people of all faiths all to have that kind of freedom oh to have that kind of freedom and one little woman wrote this she said i cannot believe that you people are in there without masks [Laughter] i'm not criticizing that i'm not i'm not against that not at all but what i want to know is why in the world that's all you could think see that woman is never likely to dance her way to victory she is never likely to wave her hands and come to victory unless something is able to penetrate her made up mind to find the thumbs down instead of the thumbs up you see i tell you it's not mind over matter not at all it's the mind of christ over the mind of the flesh it's taking his mind and going with that because you have the mind of christ somebody say i have the mind of christ all right we've got to go on where were we cancer was the last what is it it's faith that overcomes i'm nearly done his faith had overcome why didn't it overcome when i was praying for her here good question she was just fluttering around god knows how sincere you are god knows when you say pray for me if you really mean when you go up to someone gifted in the spirit and you say if you see something about me would you please come and tell me and talk to me about it god knows whether you mean that or not maybe you mean if you see something blessing on me that god's going to give me come and tell me but if it's something i need to line up and make a little adjustment on then don't bother you see god sees your heart brother bam said that woman was at the altar all the time and he went down and prayed for her and we know the miracles there's a woman sitting right back here sister west who knows what god could do in a meeting like that because she was healed in a prayer line where brother branham prayed and he said your back trouble has left you and it left her not because brother branham did it because he was in touch with the one who purchased that healing so she knew and that same god that moved for sister west and tens of thousands of others was willing to move for that woman and that same servant of god came and laid hands on her why didn't she overcome what i was praying for she was just fluttering around but when the doctor says you got cancer and gonna die she got to business he said that's the way it has to get oh my i know some of you are uh slowing down but i'm not ready to slow down just yet i want you to hear this he said why not get down to business now why wait that long put your faith in god are you sitting here tonight waiting on somebody to vindicate you or validate you or are you waiting for god to deliver you and if you're willing for god to deliver you he's here he's here he's here to deliver us well i don't want that woman to lay hands on me well i don't want that man to lay hands on me see see how we are i've seen people i didn't particularly want to lay hands on me but i'm not going to make no big fuss distract and destroy a service let me tell you something i know who the overcomer is he's in here he lives in here nobody's going to put something on me because of a situation like that i'm not going to live in that kind of fear do you hear what i'm saying and i want you to know that one that you you're not sure that you want them to pray for you that might be the one that god has ordained whoa i didn't mean to say that i didn't plan that ain't in the notes what if that somebody's a woman a woman is it possible you read the book you read the book i don't believe the bible uh is saying that women should pastor churches i don't believe that and this goes all the way out over the internet and i'm not ashamed i'm going to stay with the word but i want you to know that's not what i'm talking about i'm not calling any sisters in here to pastor a church what i'm calling them to do or what i'm bringing to your attention is that very one that you're so sure you've got more than they do that may be the one that god would send to help you along the way would you want your prejudice toward a particular person to cut you off from receiving what you need to receive from the lord in this meeting there's no room for prejudices racial prejudices gender prejudices religious prejudices amen i've had some of the most tattooed pierced folks you've ever seen in your life say brother i'd like to pray for you and you know what i knew god sent some of them my way and here's the good thing is when you when you're willing like that you can always say now it's my turn let me pray for you don't you decide how it's going to come he sent his word to heal us he said his word to deliver us brother brooks may be preaching up here shouting and carrying on and giving us the word and you may feel those shackles fly off and god give you an overcoming anointing it may happen that way i don't know how it's going to happen but i'm encouraging you put your faith in god and let him give you the victory over anything over anything you're still with me all right but when she changed her faith let me let me finish this he said that's the way it has to get when you get to business why wait that long why not get down to business now put your faith in god what if that woman what if the woman had had her faith in me i'd have failed because i'm a man you reckon that's true yes it is i'm a man amen god doesn't have god serving him he has men that have become sons of god because the son of god became a son of man that we the fallen sons of men may become the sons of god i tell you that's a pretty powerful redemption story isn't it all right so she said uh but then it failed cause i'm a man but when she changed her faith not in the brethren tabernacle or within branham or in anything else but placed our faith in jesus christ not in the upc or the aopc or the assembly of god or none of that she placed her faith in the lord jesus christ look what happened to her look what happened to her she raised up above all the fears and the doubts and god did what he healed her he delivered her from that thing that was trying to overcome her she got the victory oh she overcome faith is the victory that overcome i want you to give god praise i don't know that woman [Applause] but i praise the lord for her journey to get there he said she's sitting right here looking at me you might be the woman [Music] it may not be sick it may be anything i don't know what it is but you may be in the same position that woman was in fighting the air coming for prayer coming for prayer come in for prayer come in for prayer come into prayer i don't want to offend hurt make mad unless it will help you but i can't tell you the times that people will come over and over and over and over and over and over again through the years and it's always about my past and because i have a past did you know you have a past i guess it's like an opinion we all have one we all have a past mine hasn't always been beautiful i know what living in a broken home is about blah blah blah i don't even want to talk about it it's not who i am if this elbow problem's not mine if this sinus infection doesn't belong to me then neither does any of that it's not mine what man are you talking about what little boy are you talking about come on and they come over and over and over again and you realize that the pain of their past has become their identity and if you take that away they'd be faceless they'd be like a ghost floating around they would have no personality you wouldn't even recognize them to be who they were because everything about their life now if we were talking about people still bound in the world if we were talking about people that hadn't met the truth of the gospel and the power of the holy ghost and the sanctifying power of the word you may not help me tonight but just remember you don't have to listen to me for four more services sunday week but i'm telling you the truth some people don't really want the freedom they say they do because they have nothing to talk about need another water somebody please thank you he's going they wouldn't have anything to talk about they wouldn't even know they have nothing to worry about they have no excuse for their awkwardness for who they have become i'm telling you what wouldn't you love to see how many of you would love to see what jesus will make you if you let him give you the power to overcome anything whoa i don't know how many times through the year sister flo i've heard you say i wished i wasn't that way i wished i wasn't this way i wished i wasn't the other way i wished i was more like this and more like that let me tell you something this is a journey if everybody worship the same way if everybody did it all just the same way then we wouldn't get to our places where we need to get in christ wouldn't you love to see what jesus i feel something now wouldn't you love to see what jesus will make you if you'll take your hands off of all those things that have tried to overcome you including the pain of your past well i'm i got i'm wounded uh sunday how long will you need to carry that if you're going to carry that as long as you've carried some of the other you've got 30 more years in the wilderness you think you're the only one that ever gets offended or hurt no sir this is a church full of people that know what it means to be heard and wounded and fitted but they meant to do it maybe they did maybe they did would you be willing to forgive them if they ask did you know you have to forgive them regardless of whether they ask or not don't let those things that you have been through become your identity wouldn't you love to see what jesus can make you look like function like worship like if you'd let that anointing come night after night this week and give you power to overcome anything make up your list and if you feel like you've got over one hurdle say lord don't forget number two i'm bringing number three lord to you you say i've got a list of 50 bring them all at one time god can handle them let me tell you something jesus can handle every obstacle [Music] every hindrance i need another one uh what it takes to overcome all unbelief i want to call the musicians although i'm not quite ready for them but i want to call them anyway it makes me feel better paragraph 73 it makes some of you the rush of me to feel better 73 i know it's late we haven't been here yet the length of an average college football game hello we hadn't been here yet long enough the average braves baseball game hello come on now very few hollywood movies are this short when god speaks to a man he has faith and he has ambition and he has a purpose slow down when god speaks to a man he gives him a purpose that's a woman as well when god speaks to a man he gives him ambition this isn't selfish ambition we all have to work through all that we have to overcome all that i'm talking about what god puts in you a desire to be something for him [Music] you see we we've been hindered along the way because we came out of a background where it was more about doing than being and so now we struggle because our answer our solution is usually i need to do more i hear the same people saying i need to pray more i need to read obama more i need to pray more need to read my bible more need to pray more yeah you do so just do it but don't let the condemnation of your slackness keep you from receiving another way out there's nothing more precious than prayer nothing more precious than the word nothing no more powerful weapon in this whole wide world than prayer nothing nothing can stand before the word you need to read it you need to hear it you need to breathe it you need to eat it you need to sleep it but it may not be reading more or praying more to get you over it certainly wasn't coming to the altar one more time for that woman was it it was getting down to business do you think let me ask you this do you think it takes a cancer diagnosis to make a man get down to business it should not now if we're talking about someone out there hardened by sin and unrepentance that's a category to itself but you people are born again of the spirit of god and your desire is to be if you want to do more let him make you more become more more of what god has for you trade your ambition for his when god speaks to a man watch this when god speaks to a man he gives him faith to do it to accomplish or achieve what his purpose in life is what god called him to do oh the church wouldn't let me be what god called me to be my family wouldn't let me be what god called me to be my boss man wouldn't let me be what god called me to be again that sounds like the message i heard growing up the devil stole his life this is what i heard growing up the devil killed him you better listen some of you won't agree that's your prerogative i grew up under that kind of a doctrine the doctrine that i grew up under was placing the enemy more powerful than his creator i don't believe that gospel let me go on record tonight i don't believe any message that puts the devil in a greater position i recognize that he couldn't even be the prince of the power of the air if god didn't allow him he couldn't be what he is if god didn't allow him to be that he's a tool in the hand of god to perfect the saints if you believe that same man then you quit putting your hindrance above your answer quit putting your obstacle above your ability to let faith be your victory you believe that same man he said if god gives him faith to do it to accomplish or achieve what his purpose in life is what god called him to do he's called us to be in the church of god amen whatever god calls you to he will give you the victory that you need to press through now i have to i have to stop i'm going to find let me find one more thing in these 15 pages of note let me find one thing it's one little section i wanna there's so many things that we have heard about overcoming but there's one little thing lord let me find that oh it spoke to me today yeah it's long it's a little bit long but i got a few more minutes some of my good friends are just getting here so i got another hour right i appreciate the hour brother brent and sister trish god bless you uh this is in a message called questions and answers number four and uh it's 1964. it's gonna be way over in the in the uh document and it's paragraph 66 and there's several questions here we're gonna we're gonna read a little bit slow because i want you to see if you can relate to any of this because this is something that really strengthened me uh question 387 brother branham please explain how a person knows if he is thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially if you know you do not want to think them period now got to pause again you see this is the mentality again that i was raised under that the enemy can just come in and inject our minds against our will he can say whatever he wants to say and he can bypass holy ghost he can by pass the truth of the revelation of his word and put thoughts in my head that i have no power to overcome that's not what i believe and that's not what brother branham believed let's go on he said then if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's with the word it's god thinking if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil if it's good thoughts of the word and of god it's god's thinking now the next question 388 he said if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be overcome or got rid of good question he said take the ver listen to this oh i couldn't be this simple you mean i could drive the devil out of my head you mean i have the power by the holy ghost to cancel his excess access denied may god give us a big old flashing sign that says your access has been denied now watch this he said take the very vice versa from it if the devil makes you think that you are if you know you're a christian and he tries to make you think you're not a christian just take the versa say i am a christian couldn't be that easy it couldn't be that easy couldn't be that easy faith faith is the victory that overcomes the world oh yes he said as long as your experience matches in god's word say i'm a christian have you met the requirement have you repented and been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins have you been have you been filled baptized with the holy ghost and fire i didn't ask you if you spoke in tongues i ask you if you've been filled with the holy ghost is your experience a bible experience if it is then you can absolutely declare without a shadow of a doubt no matter how you feel or how you feel others feel about you access to the devil i'm a christian anything else the same way anything else the same way anything else the same way you win me we're nearly done when you see the musicians are up here when you answer this please pray for me to overcome this as i am not my self before the question was over the person confessed why they're having such a struggle it's the whole process of their thoughts it's the whole paradigm that they have created and he goes on let's keep reading just a moment he said god grant your overcoming ever who you are and here's here's some advice may your thoughts just go right back to the other side and say i am a christian i am a believer satan you have no hold on me i'm not going to embarrass any of you people here but are there any of you people who got sick enough with this devil of covet that you would be honest and say that the devil whispered in your ear this is it i'm go i'm you're going out of here did anybody did anybody have a thought of that hear some i did and i didn't suffer like like folks around me were suffering that thought came and you know what i had to say access denied you didn't call me you didn't send me you you didn't choose me hallelujah i didn't go on the journey to try to figure out who gave it to me i know where it come from it didn't come to me by the saints it came to me by the enemy and god gave us the victory and he did because you must have said i cannot yield if it's my time i'm going out of here let me tell you something when your time comes not when your family gets ready to lose you i'm kind of glad of that because there might be times mine would want to get rid of me and i'm glad they don't get to choose how long i stay here hallelujah praise the lord he said satan you have no hold on me i got to read go on frankly i'm standing right here now saying the same thing keep from fainting right here the pulpit that's right four or five times i've almost pitched over on the pulpit that's the truth god knows that's right listen here how a man of god is struggling whoa one that didn't ever have a trouble one that didn't ever have a sick one that didn't ever have a problem i don't know if he could help me or not but here's one that felt fought the same battles and that's why god came and lived in the body of a man because he was gonna fight and overcome and because he did you did now 389 next one when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex and there's many there's many syndromes and complexes that the enemy will use to try to keep you under his ugly thumb how may he overcome this aren't you glad that somebody asked these questions i am he said so should it be that he was the only child caused this in his early youth oh i was an only child let me read on take here's the advice take exactly the opposite i've been through so much i don't know how i'm ever going to be able to live a normal life i've been so broken so bruised so wounded i don't know how i'm ever going to be able to live normal nobody should have to live and go through the things that i've been through boy that's encouraging isn't it i know you know exactly what i'm saying these are the lies that the enemy tells us because he allowed these things listen he's the one that brought him our way because he thought i'll use this to take you under and god says i'll take the very same thing and cause you to come over the thing that the enemy meant to destroy you can be must be has to be glory be to god the very thing that gives you grace glory to overcome praise god whoa i think that's just a bunch of emotion maybe whoa but it sure does feel good you thought you had me my father rejected me the enemy thought that he would use that to destroy my life dumb devil could it yes i've stood here in this pulpit for many many years now and this week celebrated 46 years of active ministry and i have stood many many times and given my testimony of how a spirit of lust came down through the men in my family and would have destroyed my life as a preteen but god my great grandfather my grandfather my father were womanizers god redeemed and saved and delivered and he is good and he is faithful but that's my family truth that's my family truth and i would have grown up to have the same kind of out of control lust that drove every one of them into somebody else's bedroom while their wives rolled around the town looking for them and that old same thing began to try to talk to me and work on me when i was not even quite a teenager and the demons spirits came and i don't want to go into all that but manifested in my bedroom when i was just a boy and what did you do i did what anybody will do if they get desperate enough i rolled out of the bed on my face and called out to a god to deliver me of something i did not even understand i didn't understand looking back i know what this was it was coming on me generationally i didn't know what these thoughts were where they came from why these feelings were coming over me i didn't understand any of it who was i going to ask my old gray-headed granny was i going to go to my grandmother and say big mama i don't know where these thoughts are coming i don't know why this is coming on me let me tell you something in that moment there was nobody to go to except the one who could do something for me i'm telling you my life and i rolled over and you could stand you could stand you could stand got to go you could stand and give me the same kind of testimony what the enemy meant to destroy you but you've just got to make sure that you don't allow the enemy to hold you in a vicious holding cycle a holding pattern when god's calling you to victory how to overcome anything how to overcome anything how to overcome anything he said take exactly the opposite if you're always wanting your way whoa i was i have i fought that and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you got the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got now if this was a charismatic conference or meeting they they they've got a phrase for it they call it moving in the opposite spirit brother branham had never heard terminology like that and he said it's just vice versa well i know what it means first time i heard somebody moving in opposite spirit i had to figure that out but i knew what it meant when brother renner said just take the vice versa you just turn that thing around if the enemy is trying to bind you with stinginess you just give your way to victory you just say i'm gonna share i'm going to give i'm not going to let if the enemy's trying to make you a powder you make up your mind you're not going to wear your feelings on your sleeves anymore if the enemy is trying to change and and deform your present and your future because of what you walked through in the past why don't you make up your mind faith is the victory that overcomes the world i'm going to show that dirty devil he's a liar he said if you're selfish you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got see do whatever just go to vice versa that's the way to overcome what anything isn't that the theme of this meeting how to overcome anything there it is it's an antidote quit cooperating with a liar help me now quit cooperating with a liar pack up all of his lies but you didn't call me devil whoa you didn't call me he did he's going to be the one to get me through brother branstad that's the way to overcome anything it's an antidote i want you to say it's an antidote it's an antidote let's stand together hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god praise god i don't know what to tell you to sing i don't know what to tell you to sing but sing something in a minute when you can when you think of something you surely you can think of something i believe with all my heart that it is more simple than what our religious mindset likes to make it and i think we choose to stay in holding pattern because we always do listen i'm still preaching you've just changed positions because we choose to always do what we've always done and if you always do what you've always done got good news for you you'll always be what you've always been if you let betrayals cause you from trusting anybody or having any friends and you don't turn loose of that and give that to the redeeming blood of jesus christ you'll never break out of that cycle the cycle that the enemy meant to destroy you god may have a friend for you he may have somebody for your life that you will not let in not because of something he's done or she's done but because of where you've been doesn't that just sound like the devil he gets in families like i just mentioned and he likes to carry a thing all the way through but that gets pretty serious when you start having children that's when you really have to start taking god at his word because you know your struggles you don't want that to go to another generation you hear what i'm saying i don't know what you're struggling with i don't know what you need to overcome but i have confidence that you do i have confidence that if you'll join me this week and make a list of those things that you would like to have the victory over instead of them controlling you you want to put them under your feet i believe the holy ghost is going to meet us here he did he's here tonight i believe he's going to meet us here i don't believe that brother isaiah brooks is going to be able to pack it all up in a suitcase and bring it to us because he forgot his driver's license almost didn't get on the plane he might have forgot to put all we need in a suitcase i'm not making fun of him i've been in that kind of stressful situation but i want you to know it's jesus has got it it's in his suitcase everything we need how many of you are willing to trust him i'm not asking you to trust me i'm asking you to trust him i'm asking you to take him at his word i'm asking that you would be willing to allow him one choice at a time one praise at a time to give you victory over every obstacle if you're a person in here and you've only got one you're blessed because most people i know it's got a collection of hindrances and obstacles but jesus has an answer for every one of them could we worship the lord just a moment i know it's getting late but we want to worship him for just a moment and see what the lord will do before we close hallelujah come on praise god you give a life you are love you bring light to the darkness you give hope this is no more about you you restored him to him every heart that is [Music] and put [Music] [Applause] you're the one that gives me grace [Music] [Music] [Music] and we pour out our praise it's your breath it's your brain in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you [Music] you bring light to the darkness you give hope you give hope you restore every heart that is [Music] so [Music] so we pour out our praise to you [Music] so we pour out our praise lord we pour out our praise it's your bread [Music] [Music] so we pour out our praise lord we pour out our praise it's your bread in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you [Music] it's your bread [Music] yes the earth will shout your praise our hearts will cry these bones will sing oh great [Music] our hearts will for him right now [Music] our hearts will come [Music] it's our lungs so we pour out our praise lord we pour and our praises your breath in our lungs so [Music] we pour out our praise it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you just play now you may not have had time to make your list but i want us to pray we're not going to call you forward i don't want to prolong the evening any longer than i already have but i mean this i'm serious about this i've made my list these are things that i feel like have the ability to control me at times instead of me controlling them and before this meeting is over i've asked the lord to anoint my faith let me lay all of that before him and come out of here overcoming anything having control over every bit of it conquering all of it instead of it conquering me now if i need that i'm just i'm just taking a risk here but i'm pretty sure somebody else needs that too the same old samos you may not have your whole list but i think right now you know of some things that the enemy uses to hold you back i want you to give them to the lord if you're a person that feels like you should kneel or need to kneel kneel if you're a person that feels like you you just about have to come forward come forward but i'm giving you the opportunity right where you are i'm telling you what i'm preaching about tonight it can meet you right where you stand if somebody it's risky the enemy tries to convince us i've tried before i've never been able we never will be able we'll never be able to put it behind us but faith is the victory that overcomes the world jesus in us has power to give us victory over anything that the enemies use so i want you to just stretch your i'm going to do something i never do i'm going to ask you to take your hands down just a moment it seems so crazy because as preachers we're always telling people raise your hands i'm fixing to do that in a minute if you're here and you say i i may not have my list but i got some stuff i know some things that control me sometime instead of me having control over it and i'm willing to give this a try because i read i heard i saw what you presented tonight and i know it i know it i knew it when i come in here but i'm willing to get down to business brother branham said she kept praying i kept praying for it nothing changed but when she got that diagnosis she got down to business wouldn't it be wonderful tonight if you and i just make up her mind i'm getting down to business i don't have to be told i got two weeks to live i don't have to be told this covet i don't have to be told any other i don't have to be tony i'm gonna get down to business and put my faith i feel something it's not about feeling but i feel something i encourage you and and implore you to join me right now if you have those things and you are willing to put your entire trust in god to give you victory over them according to his word i want you to at least lift up one hand you can put up both hands you're not lifting it up to say aye you're lifting it up to give him the acknowledgement to say lord here i am willing one more time to do all that i can to take you at your word but i'm going to need something from you because this is not the power of positive thinking this is deliverance that i need this is not a norman vincent peale moment this is i've got to have the faith to take god in his word and i need some oil poured on my faith so right now while your hands are lifted up to him because you're acknowledging to him you're saying lord i surrender these things to you i can't do it without you can't do it without you got to have your grace i want you to tell him i want you to tell him right now you don't have to be loud but i want you to tell him here they are lord here they are right now here they are i'm tired of them controlling me when your word gives me the promise that they're to be under my feet and so i surrender all i have all i am all i know i surrender that to you and i ask you to come lord tonight and in the remainder of these meetings and pour on me the portion that i need to get up above everything that is trying to take me out lord i'm asking you right now that as we leave here tonight that our faith will position us for whatever you have for us thursday night friday night saturday night and sunday morning when we come together deliverance is ours if we're willing lord to put our faith into this moment it is a moab it is an appointment it is a divine convocation you have called us here for such a time as this and we don't want to walk under the burden of all that has held us we want to move in that faith so lord here we are just tell him yes if you don't want to go into all those and say yes lord yes it's one decision at a time one prays at a time he has power in you to overcome anything here i am lord i believe you let something come out of your spirit right now that acknowledges to god i believe lord i believe you i believe you my confidence is in you my confidence is in your word it's not in my faith it's in you i place my faith in you because you alone are faithful it's your breath so we pour out our praise we [Music] [Music] and surrendered [Music] yes [Music] so we pour out our praise to you [Music] our hearts will cry these bones oh shine your praises our hearts will come these bones will sing oh great [Music] hallelujah [Music] your praise our hearts will cry [Music] in our lungs so we pour out our praise and we pour out our praise into your [Music] lord as we leave this place tonight realize there are those who will work tomorrow there are those who have a drive yet i'm asking you for supernatural strength i'm asking you for anointed rest on the bed tonight some have been traveling all day lord i'm asking you to renew to refresh and to restore i'm asking you lord to give us the grace to come back to these meetings with great expectation and great anticipation for how you're going to move among us for victory over every circumstance now lord we pray one more time for those yet to travel a group coming in tomorrow from indiana and and others coming in from indiana on friday those who are coming from north carolina lord we lift them up to you right now that you will let the angels of the lord line the highways and give them safety to come and be a part of what you're doing in this hour oh god bless these lagrange saints they're dear to our hearts they so bless me to look up and see them here tonight i ask you to strengthen them in every way bless them for their sacrifice [Music] we ask for your help in all these things in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen in the church said amen i want to dismiss you to go in the name of the lord and as you go out i want you to sing victory's mine remember he said if the enemy said you're not a christian you say i am a christian if you feel like tonight you don't have the victory you sing you declare you decree as you go out the door i have the victory victory is mine let's come back tomorrow night the greely slipped out just a moment ago to go and pick up brother isaiah brooks and sister ruby and he'll be preaching the rest of the meetings and i know god's going to do great mighty things if you believe that same man you're dismissed to go tonight god love you everyone victorious victory today is mine i told satan you go

in for them we just want to do that in jesus name hallelujah [Music] you
