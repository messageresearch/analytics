[0:08] sends me a little funny about a boogie
[0:10] or something anyway we have a little fun
[0:12] but okay get ready for the service and
[0:15] he'd flip the switch
[0:17] now the problem was how many of you were
[0:19] a problem was how many of you were ever
[0:21] on the telephone hookup hold your hand
[0:22] look at these folks remember on the
[0:24] telephone hookup hold your hand look at
[0:27] these folks they know what it's like
[0:29] well there was a little bit of a problem
[0:30] because if you know any just just like
[0:33] even in just just like even in modern
[0:35] technology but it just shows you that
[0:37] like the prophet of God told us that
[0:40] technology has invented many times to to
[0:43] make a way for the gospel to be
[0:45] available those magnetic tapes my how
[0:49] thankful we were to have a wall full of
[0:51] the of the message of the hour
[0:53] you couldn't have carried them all with
[0:55] you anywhere you were going and now we
[0:57] can carry the entire Ministry
[1:00] on our little phone I was at the voice
[1:03] of God a few years ago and they were
[1:05] they took us into a private room down
[1:07] there and showed us some of the projects
[1:09] that they were working on and they
[1:11] showed us a little a little chip that
[1:14] the whole message Bible everything was
[1:17] on this I don't mean a microchip
[1:19] no no not this size
[1:22] it was so small that when he held it on
[1:24] his finger I had a hard time seeing it
[1:26] and he dropped it and we never found it
[1:31] that's how small it was and the entire
[1:34] message the Bible all of these other
[1:36] books they're working on the technology
[1:38] is soon to be there and they're doing
[1:39] amazing things with the tablets now

[22:37] wish we would have to put out chairs and

[22:42] to see that and I know that God can help
[22:43] it be possible not so we can brag about
[22:46] the number but so that that many people
[22:48] can get under the wonderful presence of
[22:50] God
[22:51] all right open your Bibles
[22:56] I want you to go with me to revelation
[23:00] chapter 10.
[23:06] we are in a series and I I normally try
[23:10] to do something different in the little
[23:11] fellowship meeting but
[23:14] the Lord wouldn't let me so I'll just go
[23:16] back to this
[23:18] beginning in verse 8 Revelation chapter
[23:21] 10 I love the whole I love the whole
[23:24] book
[23:25] that whole chapter is so powerful
[23:29] because that that book that was sealed
[23:32] up for many many many years
[23:36] carried all the way over to the New
[23:38] Testament
[23:40] John on the Isle of Patmos you know I'm
[23:43] going to the Isle of Patmos one day I
[23:44] want to see it for myself
[23:46] I've had many friends to go there and I
[23:49] want to see it for myself just a little
[23:51] island off of off of the nation of
[23:53] Turkey
[23:54] and I want to see the cave that's there
[23:57] where it is believed that John received
[23:59] so much of this Revelation his physical
[24:01] body was there but but his Spirit man
[24:04] was caught up to the Lord's Day
[24:07] you know in that something to think
[24:09] about John seeing 2023
[24:13] this is part of the Lord's Day
[24:16] and he saw it and I sure would like to
[24:18] be there and see that place for myself
[24:22] what a great Revelation he received now
[24:24] in verse 8 and The Voice
[24:27] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[24:31] again and said go and take the little
[24:34] book
[24:35] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[24:40] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[24:44] Earth
[24:45] now remember in Revelation chapter 5 we
[24:47] read it this morning
[24:49] the lamb
[24:51] the voice said the lion of the tribe of
[24:53] Judah has prevailed they're waiting John
[24:55] braced himself for a lion to come
[24:57] walking out but instead it was a lamb
[25:00] slain it was a bleeding lamb
[25:04] took the book
[25:05] and opened the seals thereof
[25:08] now we're in Revelation chapter 10 and a
[25:11] mighty Angel none other than the Lord
[25:13] Jesus Christ has come down from heaven
[25:16] with an open book in his hand
[25:19] and now the the angel is calling to John
[25:23] the voice that I heard from Heaven spake
[25:26] unto me again and said go take the
[25:28] little book which is open in the hand of
[25:30] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[25:33] and upon the Earth and I went unto the
[25:36] angel and said unto him give me the
[25:38] little book
[25:39] and he said unto me take it
[25:43] and eat it up
[25:46] I want to hear you say eat it up
[25:51] you know what that means it doesn't mean
[25:53] just take a bite
[25:57] it doesn't mean take a few bites
[26:00] and leave some for somebody else
[26:03] no no no he said take it and eat it up
[26:09] totally consume the open book
[26:13] God's looking for a bride in this hour
[26:17] who will take this word and totally eat
[26:21] it up
[26:23] consume it until it becomes a part of
[26:27] Who We Are
[26:29] and it shall make thy belly bitter
[26:35] anybody ever had bitter belly
[26:38] because of this message
[26:42] you're allowed to say that here you're
[26:44] in Alabama
[26:45] you can say that yes
[26:49] but it shall be in thy mouth
[26:53] read it
[26:55] John said and I took the little book out
[26:58] of the Angel's hand guess what he did
[27:02] he ate it up
[27:04] he not only chewed it he swallowed it
[27:07] and it was in my mouth
[27:10] sweet ass honey
[27:14] and as soon as I had eaten it
[27:21] my belly was bitter
[27:25] brother the last time we had a little
[27:27] Fellowship weekend
[27:32] some of us had some bitter bellies
[27:37] I I never had anything hit me like that
[27:40] hit me
[27:42] and no it wasn't the hamburger patties
[27:45] from Sam's
[27:47] it was a virus
[27:49] and it hit so quick and it it covered so
[27:52] much and I called brother Greeley that I
[27:55] know I'm reading the scripture he
[27:56] understands
[27:57] I called brother Greeley I said or text
[27:59] or whatever I don't know what I was able
[28:01] to do will you be able to take the
[28:03] service right then he was feeling okay
[28:06] and a few minutes later
[28:10] he wasn't feeling too Swift either
[28:12] so we didn't have a service that's
[28:14] that's just the first time anything like
[28:15] that it happened but it's okay
[28:17] so nobody has to spend time this morning
[28:20] explaining
[28:21] how it feels when your belly gets bitter
[28:25] you don't want to hold that poison in
[28:29] you got it
[28:31] you got the picture
[28:35] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[28:40] again
[28:43] John your work is not finished
[28:49] you must prophesy again before many
[28:54] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[28:59] kings and we hold that prophecy in our
[29:04] hands
[29:05] and close to our hearts today these
[29:09] years later we are reading the prophecy
[29:13] that was given to John but that is not
[29:17] enough because the prophet tells us that
[29:20] John is a type of the Bride if John had
[29:25] to eat it up
[29:28] you and I are not going to be able to
[29:30] casually snack on it
[29:32] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[29:35] of his word you may be seated no need in
[29:37] both of us standing
[29:44] this is not a charcuterie board
[29:47] [Music]
[29:49] are you impressed that I knew that word
[29:54] I've heard it called all kinds of things
[30:01] that's what we call a picnic
[30:04] some of the Yankees that have been God
[30:07] has added to our fellowship
[30:09] they call it a potluck
[30:12] I said I don't believe in luck
[30:15] I want more than a pot of luck
[30:18] I want something in it
[30:21] and Ben you know he calls me a buffet
[30:27] we we've all gone along and like last
[30:30] night
[30:31] we just go along point to what we want
[30:34] somebody puts it on our plate but I want
[30:36] you to know John couldn't do that
[30:38] and the bride can't do that
[30:41] there are parts of this revelation of
[30:43] Jesus Christ that might be a little
[30:46] tastier to you
[30:49] than others
[30:53] but you don't get to say let me take the
[30:56] good things the things I like the things
[30:59] that settle well because you know we've
[31:01] come from so many denominations in so
[31:04] many different backgrounds and we bring
[31:06] our own Creeds and our own dogmas and
[31:09] our own thoughts and many try to make
[31:12] the message fit their mold but the
[31:15] message is the revelation of Jesus
[31:16] Christ it's a mold all to itself you
[31:20] don't get to bring your junk in here and
[31:22] adjust the word we must adjust
[31:27] help me a little bit
[31:29] we must adjust to the word
[31:33] there's room in here for us not to all
[31:36] look exactly the same
[31:38] I love this
[31:42] I love this
[31:44] I love the fact that we all may have our
[31:47] little bit different way of presenting
[31:50] ourselves
[31:53] we've got all different flavors of
[31:56] things represented here this morning and
[31:59] I love it I wouldn't have I wouldn't
[32:01] have you to do like me
[32:05] but the thought of never having to wear
[32:07] a necktie again is very appealing to me
[32:10] so I might do a little bit more I've
[32:13] been asking them could they make me a
[32:15] pair of them britches like brother
[32:16] elam's as big as as I am
[32:20] well they they it take enough cloth for
[32:23] three Amish men
[32:25] to even make me a pair but imagine never
[32:28] having to be all cinched up in a belt
[32:30] again
[32:32] uh
[32:34] my wife said very politely no
[32:45] well we broke the message mold
[32:50] I broke my own mold
[32:53] I come from holiness
[32:56] where you couldn't even have any facial
[32:59] hair
[33:00] then God sends us to Israel and if you
[33:03] don't have any facial hair there they
[33:06] have no confidence in anything that
[33:08] comes out of your mouth
[33:13] and so we had to make a little
[33:15] adjustment and we got talked about
[33:17] because some people are just blessed
[33:20] that way everything they do draws a lot
[33:24] of attention
[33:25] but you look around this room and you
[33:28] see the variations there's brother Levi
[33:31] Yoder and he has a style of beard that
[33:34] comes from his past with no
[33:37] well really a clean face
[33:40] he would have done well in holiness
[33:42] because his face is clean his beard is
[33:45] here you've got brother brother elim
[33:48] there that has a real one
[33:54] and then some of us more Mennonite folk
[33:57] you know we trim ours up a little bit
[33:59] but it doesn't matter
[34:02] some of you aren't old enough to grow
[34:04] one
[34:07] or could I ever have you to laugh but I
[34:09] won't I'm not going there
[34:11] I'm not going there I love
[34:13] 's word brings us together
[34:18] folks I'm not just saying this to take
[34:20] up your time I love the fact that this
[34:24] word brings people together from all
[34:28] kinds of backgrounds and we learn to get
[34:33] along because the one thing we have in
[34:36] common is this beautiful revelation of
[34:40] Christ of the Lord Jesus not just a
[34:44] historical figure but the Living Word
[34:48] living inside of us revealing himself
[34:54] unfolding himself until the word becomes
[34:58] flesh again in US
[35:02] and every now and again we could get
[35:04] together
[35:05] and we can Worship the Lord
[35:08] in the beauty of Holiness and then be
[35:11] back in our regular places oh what a
[35:15] blessing this is but don't ever think of
[35:18] it as a snack we're not grazing when we
[35:21] approach this word
[35:23] we've got to eat it all
[35:25] anybody want to help me
[35:28] come on it sets an order for the family
[35:33] it's not a wife driven home
[35:37] it's not a home that's governed by the
[35:40] wife
[35:42] God has so blessed that little lady and
[35:45] loved her so much that he has taken all
[35:48] that responsibility and pressure off of
[35:51] her so that she can serve her family
[35:54] it's the highest calling that any woman
[35:56] could ever have to be a real mother
[36:00] to her children it gets looked down on
[36:04] him the brothers work with people who
[36:06] don't understand they say to them you
[36:09] mean your wife doesn't work
[36:11] you know what kind of Life can you have
[36:14] but you know they have found out they
[36:16] can have a pretty good life that way
[36:18] because their house becomes a home
[36:24] when they come home they don't come home
[36:26] to a house they come home to a home
[36:29] that's been taken care of by a woman who
[36:33] loves her family and pours into her
[36:36] children a mother who doesn't send her
[36:39] children down to Egypt to get their
[36:41] education
[36:44] come on
[36:47] she sees that it is her responsibility
[36:51] feels insufficient
[36:54] she doesn't always feel like she has the
[36:57] ability to do it but she yields herself
[37:02] because she understands that the
[37:04] influences of Babylon and the influences
[37:08] of Egypt are so harsh
[37:11] and so controlling
[37:15] that they suck our children in
[37:19] and I have preached for years that when
[37:22] God led the children of Israel out of
[37:24] Egypt and put them out there in the
[37:27] wilderness in their intents they didn't
[37:29] wake up their children every morning and
[37:31] wash their faces off and send them by
[37:34] bus back to Egypt
[37:38] I'd like a little help
[37:41] I'll come down here I'll get my emails
[37:44] because the word says you teach you
[37:47] teach these precepts to your children
[37:49] and to your children's children and bind
[37:53] them
[37:55] like frontlets
[37:58] [Music]
[38:01] you've never been in a room of so many
[38:03] people that understood that
[38:05] as you are today
[38:07] because I've I've driven through Place
[38:09] Amish places where the horses have these
[38:13] frontlets on their eyes
[38:16] so that they can go down the road and
[38:18] hopefully your motor car doesn't disturb
[38:21] them they just quickly
[38:23] clock that's placed there to try to keep
[38:26] them looking ahead you're guiding the
[38:29] head of a horse trying to Blind them a
[38:32] little bit from some of the distractions
[38:34] because your precious family is sitting
[38:36] in that buggy let me tell you the Bible
[38:38] tells us buying these precepts of God's
[38:41] word the Commandments of the Lord bind
[38:45] them like frontlets to our eyes so that
[38:49] we see his word and we steer our
[38:52] children and Lead our families toward
[38:55] truth
[39:00] there is no confusion
[39:02] in that
[39:06] your gender is determined by your
[39:10] plumbing
[39:12] excuse me
[39:13] just a moment Amen brother
[39:17] preach brother Shelley
[39:19] I believe I will
[39:21] it's not what you think
[39:27] I think I'm skinny
[39:32] I identify as a very skinny person
[39:35] that's why I can jump and move around
[39:38] because I identify very fit
[39:42] [Music]
[39:44] it doesn't work that
[39:47] that because every now and again I have
[39:49] to look in the mirror
[39:52] to comb my hair
[39:54] and recognize it doesn't matter how I
[39:57] identify how I think how I feel I'm not
[40:01] a kitty cat I'm not a dog
[40:07] I'm a man
[40:09] God never makes mistakes
[40:12] you be careful how you compromise with
[40:16] that spirit
[40:18] somebody said I got a nephew I have a
[40:20] niece I have a neighbor I have a loved
[40:22] one you show them the love of Christ
[40:26] you accept them as a human being but you
[40:30] never have to accept the choices they
[40:33] make or the lifestyle that they choose
[40:40] somebody told me just recently said my
[40:43] my niece is in that place where she
[40:46] thinks she's a boy and her mother has
[40:48] sent out a note on the birthday
[40:50] invitation to only bring boys clothes
[40:56] what do you think I should do I said I
[40:58] think you should send your regards
[41:02] I think you should let them know you're
[41:04] not coming
[41:09] you can you can take a tub of ice cream
[41:11] over later you can do something for the
[41:14] family you can do something that that's
[41:16] uh gender neutral I guess but I wouldn't
[41:20] ever let myself be pressured into going
[41:24] along with the confusion of Babylon or
[41:27] the influence of Egypt if the church
[41:31] doesn't make a stand
[41:34] do you see where we're headed
[41:37] do you see where our nation is headed
[41:41] we've got to stand on the word and we've
[41:43] got to do it with love
[41:45] we've got to do it with love
[41:47] we've got to be able to accept people as
[41:49] Souls
[41:51] we don't have to like their lifestyle we
[41:53] don't have to celebrate it
[42:00] this is not a snack
[42:03] we take the whole book
[42:05] we eat it up
[42:07] because it changes us forevermore
[42:11] now I want to talk to you I spoke last
[42:13] night for just a moment about the the
[42:15] three phases of the Rapture Shout
[42:19] voice of the Archangel and the last
[42:22] Trump
[42:24] that is the word coming of Christ the
[42:27] bride coming of Christ and the
[42:30] bridegroom coming of Christ
[42:32] but there are also a couple of phases
[42:35] here when this little bride typed by
[42:39] John we take this book we take this
[42:42] message
[42:43] you you see the message of the hour has
[42:47] made the Bible a a fresh book for all of
[42:50] us
[42:52] and uh we read before and didn't always
[42:55] understand what we were reading as I
[42:57] mentioned last night we thought
[42:59] everything was a was a a blink of an eye
[43:02] and we're gone
[43:03] we didn't understand that the Lord is
[43:06] coming first in the fullness of his word
[43:09] with a shout and then a bride is going
[43:12] to be raised up under that message and
[43:14] then the Lord is going to appear in the
[43:16] air to receive his bride brother random
[43:20] said he comes the first time to redeem
[43:22] his bride he comes the next time to
[43:26] receive his bride he comes the third
[43:28] time with his bride
[43:32] he came to Bethlehem to save and redeem
[43:36] his bride at Calvary
[43:39] he comes the next time in the air to
[43:43] receive his bride at the last Trump
[43:47] and then he's coming again and you and I
[43:50] are going to come with him according to
[43:52] Revelation chapter 19. the armies of
[43:55] Heaven coming with him the redeemed of
[43:58] the Lord
[43:59] and I want you to know the devil's days
[44:01] are numbered then aren't they
[44:03] in that great coming with the bride
[44:07] if John is a real type
[44:11] of the of the Bride
[44:14] and John had to eat the book
[44:17] and if the scripture said that in his
[44:20] mouth it was sweet as honey in his belly
[44:23] it was bitter and then number three
[44:26] he had to prophesy again
[44:29] then I want to propose to you today that
[44:31] you and I are going to have to do the
[44:33] very same thing
[44:35] there are three phases of eating the
[44:37] book and the book is the revealed word
[44:39] the seals have been loosed and as I said
[44:43] last night brother Branham didn't loose
[44:45] the seals the lamb loosed the seals the
[44:47] Lord Jesus Christ loosed the seals and
[44:50] God allowed brother Branham to catch the
[44:52] symbols
[44:54] because the book of the Revelation is a
[44:56] book of symbols and God allowed that
[44:58] servant of the Lord to get those symbols
[45:01] and to see past just a symbol and he
[45:05] began to see what was represented under
[45:07] those symbols
[45:09] and God allowed him then to take the
[45:12] church ages and history and lay it over
[45:16] top the word and church history lay that
[45:20] right over and it becomes this beautiful
[45:22] picture of the end time
[45:24] somebody said I don't think we have to
[45:26] know uh what what things are about to
[45:29] transpire I believe that's wrong
[45:32] I believe it matters how you're baptized
[45:34] I believe it matters how you look at God
[45:38] how can you say you know a God that you
[45:40] don't know
[45:41] and I believe it matters how you look at
[45:44] the book of the revelation
[45:46] and you've heard many people even even
[45:48] those who are not full Believers of this
[45:50] message who have come here and spoken as
[45:52] friends of mine
[45:54] and have told you clearly that they
[45:56] understand that God gave brother Branham
[45:59] a perfect interpretation to the book of
[46:01] the revelation
[46:02] and they know that because it fits the
[46:05] scripture and because of its history
[46:08] and you've heard them stand here and say
[46:10] and when I come across someone else
[46:13] another book about the end time or a
[46:15] preacher preaching on the end time I
[46:16] judge everything I read are you with me
[46:19] I judge everything I hear
[46:21] by what I've heard brother Branham say
[46:23] because I don't believe that was a man I
[46:25] believe that was God giving him that I
[46:27] challenge you to do the same
[46:28] I tell you today you'll be in a whole
[46:30] lot less confusion
[46:33] if you'll come back to what God has
[46:35] given us in this day concerning the end
[46:38] time their wonderful fellowships out
[46:40] there I love the Pentecostals I love the
[46:44] charismatics I love some of their
[46:46] passion I love some of the things they
[46:48] teach and some of the things they
[46:50] understand but I don't believe the bride
[46:52] is being perfected by that I believe we
[46:55] can be encouraged sometime by that are
[46:57] you with me
[46:59] yes but I don't believe that there's any
[47:02] other message to perfect the bride of
[47:04] Christ than the revelation of Jesus
[47:07] that that we have received underneath
[47:10] the book that was one sealed the scroll
[47:12] is now re opened up and and we can see
[47:16] into that book
[47:19] I believe that our name is brother
[47:21] Greeley pointed out and in the song it
[47:24] said there's a name written and brother
[47:26] Greeley pointed out that it's not a new
[47:28] name it's been written there this not
[47:31] written there the nights you get saved
[47:33] it was written there since before the
[47:35] foundation of the world
[47:37] but I want you to know I believe the
[47:40] Lamb's roll call is going to be a whole
[47:41] lot shorter than that
[47:44] eyes
[47:46] I don't believe the lamb is going to
[47:49] have to call every name
[47:55] my goodness how many yoders are there in
[47:57] the world
[47:59] how many Millers are there in the world
[48:01] how many Fishers are there in the world
[48:04] why we would be there and take it take
[48:07] ten thousand years or more to get
[48:10] through the alphabet of all the Bride of
[48:11] all the church ages but I have a
[48:14] revelation from the word
[48:16] that you're not going to have to worry
[48:18] about your old name when you get there
[48:21] because to the Overcomer they're going
[48:23] to receive a new name
[48:25] I may not know every detail about it but
[48:28] I know part of it
[48:29] you're going to be standing there
[48:31] waiting on the Shelly to be called or
[48:33] Jesse to be whatever your names are uh
[48:36] uh Alias how do you say your last name
[48:40] well how many last names do you have
[48:43] well give me both of them
[48:45] yeah yeah I can't say either one of them
[48:48] I've been calling him Chaka
[48:53] no no it's not wrong it's not wrong
[48:57] it's it's either that or nothing
[49:01] I I I'll just say brother Elias
[49:04] uh
[49:06] you could never get through the roll
[49:08] call but you know what you'll be
[49:09] standing there waiting on Smith
[49:12] Jones
[49:15] like we did in school here
[49:19] present
[49:20] anybody ever been in an old calling
[49:22] School
[49:25] then there was always a smart alec I
[49:27] believe it was probably some of you
[49:29] president
[49:33] every other
[49:34] sent here and there was always that one
[49:37] usually a boy president
[49:42] you're gonna be way
[49:48] and it's not going to take eternity to
[49:50] call their own the lamb will just say we
[49:54] will now have the wrong call Mrs Jesus
[49:58] Christ
[49:59] [Music]
[49:59] [Applause]
[50:02] your name is there don't you worry your
[50:04] name is there
[50:06] but in eternity you won't have to go buy
[50:09] your own worn out Earthly name you have
[50:12] a new name and you have a new identity
[50:16] you are now the Lamb's wife
[50:19] you are not just as a spouse bride you
[50:23] are his wife and you carry the full
[50:26] authority of Heaven
[50:28] didn't brother Branham tell us we come
[50:30] to that hour before we get there
[50:33] where your name on the check you just
[50:36] signed Mrs
[50:38] Jesus Christ
[50:41] into full authority of the banks an
[50:44] economy of Heaven is at your disposal
[50:47] when you step into that place of full
[50:49] adoption
[50:51] it's the TR are you with me
[50:53] it's the transition from
[50:55] uh
[50:57] this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[51:00] pleased to dwell
[51:01] and over here the transition finishes
[51:04] and the voice says this is my beloved
[51:07] Son hear ye him
[51:13] when you come to Salvation
[51:16] when you come to this message of Truth
[51:18] God is pleased to dwell in you the same
[51:22] thing that was said about our Lord in
[51:24] his Earthly baptism could be said about
[51:26] you this is my beloved Son
[51:29] in whom I am pleased to dwell
[51:32] but you have to go through some stuff
[51:34] you've got to eat it up
[51:38] you know I know people that have been
[51:40] following this Truth for 25 years never
[51:43] made it through the revelation of Jesus
[51:44] Christ series
[51:49] there was something before a church age
[51:51] book
[51:53] the actual sermons that went forth the
[51:55] revelation of Jesus Christ series if
[51:57] there's anybody here and you don't have
[51:58] access to it we have it on MP3 disc you
[52:01] can have we'll give it to you and you
[52:03] can go through those original Church
[52:05] ages but they're also on the app
[52:08] you can go through those original Church
[52:10] ages if you say that this is your
[52:12] message and you are a part of this bride
[52:15] and you don't take the opportunity when
[52:17] you can to eat that
[52:20] then you're no more than a snacker
[52:23] boy I didn't get no help
[52:26] you're no more than a snacker
[52:29] you go ahead I'll tell you there's going
[52:31] to be those who come in in the last hour
[52:33] that eat it all
[52:35] while you're still trying to figure out
[52:37] which tape to listen to
[52:40] while you're still trying to find title
[52:43] that appeals to you there's going to be
[52:45] a people that come in in the 11th Hour
[52:48] that are willing to eat it up
[52:52] because they realize that it changes us
[52:56] out of the vile image of the Flesh and
[52:58] into the new image of Christ
[53:04] he ate it up
[53:06] and in the eating of that book there are
[53:08] three phases that not only apply to John
[53:10] they apply to you it's going to be sweet
[53:13] in your mouth
[53:15] just like when one eats a food in the
[53:17] natural
[53:19] the first stage is putting the piece of
[53:21] food in your mouth and by the way
[53:25] sometimes we take way too much at a time
[53:32] you you can't properly digest what you
[53:34] don't chew properly
[53:36] this is not a an
[53:39] etiquette lesson
[53:41] but nobody is going to take the plate
[53:46] it's going to be there
[53:49] I catch myself sometimes eating in a
[53:51] hurry it's the most dangerous thing you
[53:53] can do for your own digestive system
[53:56] you you take a bite
[53:58] you you chew it up you don't have time
[54:00] to do that while you're in church
[54:06] because I'm giving you a buffet so says
[54:08] brother being
[54:11] you don't have time to chew at all
[54:12] that's why you can go back and catch it
[54:15] again
[54:16] I'm telling you listen to brother
[54:17] Brandon first
[54:19] you that are way behind in listening to
[54:21] The Prophet's message with his own voice
[54:23] you that are way behind you listen to
[54:25] him I don't care whether you ever hear a
[54:28] message that I preach or not I'm not I'm
[54:30] not here promoting what I've said
[54:32] but I'm telling you that just hearing at
[54:34] one time it's not digesting at all it's
[54:37] getting little pieces like brother
[54:39] Greeley was talking about but when we go
[54:41] back we're at a different place in our
[54:42] life
[54:44] we're thinking differently something
[54:45] shifted in our circumstances and
[54:48] sometimes we hear a message and it's
[54:50] entirely different to us
[54:52] and sometimes around here we say well
[54:54] what not sitting in that service
[54:57] how did I miss all of that because you
[55:00] can only choose so much at a time and
[55:02] remember you can't chew at all when
[55:05] you're sleeping
[55:09] preach on brother
[55:12] we need to get us some good Amish
[55:14] deacons in here is what we need
[55:16] with a big stick and a knob on the end
[55:18] like the pilgrims or something to wake
[55:21] some folks up sometime you cannot chew
[55:23] while you're asleep you'll choke
[55:26] but God has let us preserve these truths
[55:29] so that we can go back and we can take a
[55:31] abide and you know what I believe that
[55:34] food is to is to sustain and nourish and
[55:37] strengthen our body but there's nothing
[55:39] wrong with enjoying the taste of food
[55:45] that doesn't mean because the one piece
[55:47] of cake is good you can eat the whole
[55:49] cake
[55:52] but have you ever just had something so
[55:54] nice
[55:56] that you really wanted to slow down and
[55:58] enjoy the flavor
[55:59] and you just chewed it and really really
[56:01] tasted it that's that's required
[56:05] when we're talking about feasting on the
[56:07] word of the hour
[56:08] you just enjoy the flavor and The Taste
[56:11] and just like your natural food the
[56:14] spiritual food can be the same way and
[56:17] this phase in the bride is when the
[56:19] restored word is first partaken of and
[56:23] you first come into the message of the
[56:25] hour or you first start revisiting the
[56:27] the message that you say you believe
[56:29] it's a time of excitement it's a Time of
[56:33] Wonder it's a time of energy it's a time
[56:36] of sweetness the word tastes so good how
[56:40] many of you have ever feasted on a
[56:42] message and you thought that was so good
[56:46] now remember everybody doesn't doesn't
[56:49] feel the way you feel
[56:52] the two men that went into here brother
[56:54] Branham and one come out and said I
[56:55] don't like that man very much he called
[56:58] me a buzzard
[57:00] and the other man come out he said I
[57:02] love that man's preaching he called me
[57:04] an eagle
[57:06] same sermon two men one identified with
[57:10] a buzzard one identified with an eagle
[57:12] there are times that we can identify
[57:15] with a particular message more than
[57:16] others but it's all good for us
[57:19] the Bible said in Psalm 34 8 O taste and
[57:22] see that the Lord is good blessed is the
[57:26] man that trusteth in him
[57:29] the new truths
[57:31] the new doctrines that we begin to hear
[57:34] become so fascinating
[57:37] when you've grown up your whole life
[57:39] believing that that Eve ate a banana
[57:43] or an apple
[57:47] or an apricot
[57:51] I read a whole scientific uh
[57:54] article some years ago that said no no
[57:56] it wasn't an apple it was an apricot and
[57:58] we're going to have to prove it we they
[58:00] go through all these scientific facts
[58:04] to help prove that it was an apricot
[58:07] brother random said if it were apples
[58:12] and eating those apples would help women
[58:14] to know they're naked
[58:16] pass the apples
[58:21] but it was so much more than that it was
[58:23] a seed of discrepancy
[58:27] there was something more vile than the
[58:30] natural Act
[58:32] I don't believe it's healthy for us to
[58:35] focus only on the natural part of the
[58:39] ACT
[58:41] because you didn't received the seed of
[58:43] discrepancy today
[58:45] without a natural Act of intimacy
[58:49] you receive a lie into the womb of your
[58:51] spirit this is what Eve did
[58:54] she received a lie into the womb of her
[58:56] spirit and it was mostly truth
[59:00] just a small portion of lie and that's
[59:03] all it takes to sow a seed of
[59:05] discrepancy into her life that caused
[59:08] her to doubt and to reason about the
[59:11] goodness of God
[59:13] if the enemy can bring you into a dark
[59:16] place and into a trial and you begin to
[59:19] wonder if God is really good
[59:23] you're in the same dangerous place that
[59:26] Eve was in
[59:28] it will be easy for you to receive a
[59:31] seed
[59:32] of discrepancy
[59:34] let me tell you today God is good let me
[59:37] look at you God is good
[59:40] God is all together good he is all
[59:43] together lovely
[59:45] my brother from Ohio said to me last
[59:48] night there are no mistakes God makes no
[59:50] mistakes
[59:51] [Music]
[59:53] that's one thing to say that when
[59:55] everything has always been good and
[59:57] you've been on a bed of ease but when
[59:59] you're standing in a tragedy like he was
[1:00:01] sharing with me and you can say there
[1:00:04] are no accidents in God
[1:00:06] you are shutting off the womb of your
[1:00:09] mind to any lie of reasoning that Satan
[1:00:13] would like to shoot you full of
[1:00:16] every time your answer is praise every
[1:00:19] time your response is hallelujah
[1:00:22] every time you say God is good
[1:00:26] all the time he's all together lovely
[1:00:31] he's sovereign
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:35] every time you praise him and I don't
[1:00:38] like to say praise the Lord anyhow
[1:00:41] I know a lot of people I don't like to
[1:00:43] say
[1:00:44] praise the Lord anyhow
[1:00:47] because praise is not a half-hearted
[1:00:50] expression
[1:00:53] you don't have to say anyhow leave the
[1:00:54] anyhow off of it and when the bill is
[1:00:58] not yet paid you don't have to say
[1:00:59] anyhow you can just say praise the Lord
[1:01:04] my provider
[1:01:07] when the when the when the heart is
[1:01:09] breaking when the loss is great when the
[1:01:12] grief is deep and you can just raise
[1:01:15] your hands and say praise the Lord when
[1:01:18] the wounds are bleeding and the stripes
[1:01:21] are stinging but like Paul and Silas you
[1:01:24] can raise up your hands anyway and say
[1:01:27] praise the Lord every time you focus on
[1:01:31] the goodness of God and refuse to allow
[1:01:33] the enemy to shoot you full of poison
[1:01:37] and reasoning
[1:01:40] every time you do that you're saving
[1:01:42] yourself
[1:01:43] from a whole lot of heartache and
[1:01:45] trouble
[1:01:46] because when this mind starts reasoning
[1:01:49] against the word we'll never win
[1:01:51] somebody say we'll never win
[1:01:54] it's the same kind of thing that keeps
[1:01:55] people out of God's house
[1:01:58] they say well there's too many
[1:02:00] Hypocrites there and everybody talks
[1:02:02] about me
[1:02:03] you know what I would tell you this if
[1:02:06] you let a hypocrite keep you out of
[1:02:07] church the hypocrite stands closer to
[1:02:10] God than you do
[1:02:14] the Bible said forsake not the
[1:02:16] assembling of yourselves together as a
[1:02:17] man or some is and he said we ought to
[1:02:19] be together more as we see the day
[1:02:20] approaching not less come on now me am I
[1:02:24] out of the word you're not here to snack
[1:02:26] you're here to swallow
[1:02:29] all of it's good
[1:02:31] don't you let your excuses get in your
[1:02:34] way because there is an atmosphere where
[1:02:37] we can get and we receive the word and
[1:02:40] the different attitude when we get under
[1:02:42] the atmosphere brother random said it's
[1:02:44] all about atmosphere
[1:02:45] remember I read this last weekend he
[1:02:47] said it's he said I don't like joking in
[1:02:49] the Pulpit but but he said I'm going to
[1:02:51] tell this little thing that brother
[1:02:52] Bosworth used to say he said you can
[1:02:55] take a chicken egg and put it under a
[1:02:56] dog
[1:02:59] and hatch it out
[1:03:01] the egg doesn't know that that's not his
[1:03:03] Mammy
[1:03:05] it doesn't require the mother the DNA to
[1:03:09] hatch the egg it just requires the right
[1:03:12] atmosphere when we come together in
[1:03:14] corporate praise there is an atmosphere
[1:03:18] that is created that causes the word of
[1:03:21] God to go deeper into our inner beings
[1:03:24] am I too loud this morning
[1:03:31] sweet when we first get it
[1:03:34] all these new things Original Sin
[1:03:38] may not be exciting but it explains a
[1:03:41] whole lot
[1:03:42] it explains why it had to be blood
[1:03:45] instead of a fruit salad
[1:03:50] hello
[1:03:51] I used to preach a message under the
[1:03:54] tents when I traveled under the tents
[1:03:55] and I called it you can't get blood out
[1:03:58] of a turnip
[1:04:00] have you ever heard your mama say
[1:04:01] something like that you can't get blood
[1:04:03] out of a turnip well you know what Cain
[1:04:05] found out
[1:04:09] he brought the fruit of the ground I
[1:04:10] wished I had some help this morning
[1:04:13] he brought some fruit of the ground he
[1:04:14] brought beautiful vegetables to before
[1:04:16] the Lord but that wasn't what God was
[1:04:18] after he hadn't have nothing wrong with
[1:04:20] he's not against corn and turnips and
[1:04:23] anything like that pumpkins or whatever
[1:04:25] you have God's not against that but
[1:04:26] that's not what he wants is an offering
[1:04:29] it has to be blood because of original
[1:04:31] sin nobody told Abel that
[1:04:35] the Bible said Abel received that by
[1:04:37] Revelation brother Branham taught us
[1:04:39] that he heard the same stories that Cain
[1:04:41] heard
[1:04:43] but Abel received a revelation
[1:04:46] that it had to be blood
[1:04:51] to me it's kind of like a pounding you
[1:04:54] know we don't call it that anymore
[1:04:55] because it sounds a little violent
[1:04:58] but we used to call it a pounding
[1:05:01] and we would say you know bring
[1:05:03] groceries for a family
[1:05:05] not so that you could pound them with
[1:05:07] them but so you could bless them
[1:05:10] and there are there are all kinds of
[1:05:11] people in a little Church community
[1:05:13] and there are going to be those
[1:05:16] who take the name brand
[1:05:21] right off the front Shelf
[1:05:23] and they're going to be those that reach
[1:05:25] way to the back
[1:05:28] come on
[1:05:32] oh I'm preaching now
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:36] because they're not cheerful givers
[1:05:41] they figure they figure well if they can
[1:05:44] if if if I can eat off-brand
[1:05:49] peas they can eat off brand peas yeah
[1:05:52] but you're you're pulling from the back
[1:05:54] of them off brand peas and missing those
[1:05:57] nice uh well let me just say this you're
[1:06:01] not going to get it
[1:06:04] I I only like one brand of of
[1:06:07] store-bought canned I don't like a lot
[1:06:09] of that stuff we don't eat a lot of
[1:06:10] canned store-bought vegetables
[1:06:13] but I only like one brand of English
[1:06:15] peas
[1:06:20] I hear you saying the brand
[1:06:22] I heard somebody just then whisper the
[1:06:24] brand if they're not fresh there's only
[1:06:27] one brand that I like I don't like those
[1:06:29] big old marbles they call English peas
[1:06:33] they taste green
[1:06:36] if I wanted grass I'd go out in the
[1:06:38] front yard for my lunch
[1:06:41] I like those little
[1:06:44] English peas
[1:06:46] early one that tastes so tender and so
[1:06:49] nice some of you don't like peas I can
[1:06:51] tell
[1:06:51] they taste so nice well now when it
[1:06:53] comes time for me to share peace with
[1:06:56] somebody I'm not going to give them
[1:06:58] anything that I wouldn't want to have
[1:07:00] for myself I'm not going to give them
[1:07:03] the 10 for a dollar can knowing that I
[1:07:06] only like one kind cost a little more I
[1:07:09] want them to have this is the truth and
[1:07:11] you better get this way God help me to
[1:07:13] be this way strengthen me to be this way
[1:07:15] I want to be able to share that
[1:07:20] Cain brought the best vegetables that he
[1:07:23] had
[1:07:24] but God wasn't after turnips
[1:07:27] Abel said the most precious thing to me
[1:07:30] is not a turnip
[1:07:32] but I've got a little pet lamb
[1:07:36] of all my sheep there's one that means
[1:07:38] the most to me
[1:07:41] I think he might have been a little runt
[1:07:43] or something
[1:07:46] Abel treated that little lamb like a
[1:07:48] member of the family almost
[1:07:52] held him in his lap
[1:07:55] it come time to give God an offering
[1:07:58] he didn't take the old mean stubborn
[1:08:00] sheep in his foe he said I've got to
[1:08:03] give God the best
[1:08:06] to me the best is my little lamb here
[1:08:08] that I've loved so much and brother
[1:08:10] Branham said he took some Grapevine
[1:08:12] dried Grapevine down and made him a
[1:08:15] little rope and put it around the Lamb's
[1:08:17] neck and let that lamb over to the altar
[1:08:21] had it been about a piece of fruit
[1:08:24] Cain's offering would have been enough
[1:08:27] but original sin was about blood
[1:08:33] able understood that it has to be a
[1:08:37] living offering
[1:08:39] because the New Testament would teach us
[1:08:41] that your bodies are to be presented as
[1:08:45] a Living Sacrifice a living offering
[1:08:48] unto God
[1:08:50] the prophet said he reached over and
[1:08:51] took a sharp piece of Flintstone and
[1:08:54] drew that little lamb up under his arm
[1:08:57] and he began to strike
[1:09:02] against the jugular vein of that lamb
[1:09:06] and when those main arteries were
[1:09:08] severed that blood began to spurred and
[1:09:12] A Tear began to run down Abel's face
[1:09:15] giving God the most precious thing to
[1:09:19] him
[1:09:25] and not only did The Little Lamb's wool
[1:09:28] become bloody
[1:09:30] so did the worshiper
[1:09:33] every heartbeat of that lamb pumped that
[1:09:35] blood all over Abel's robe
[1:09:39] and he looked like he'd been to war and
[1:09:42] God looked down and said it started this
[1:09:44] way
[1:09:45] and it's going to have to end this way
[1:09:48] because this little lamb
[1:09:50] was was a type
[1:09:53] of another lamb that would come a bloody
[1:09:55] Lamb slain before before Abel ever
[1:09:58] existed
[1:10:01] before there ever was an Abel there was
[1:10:03] a bloody lamb in the mind of God in that
[1:10:05] powerful
[1:10:06] and so he offered the right thing by
[1:10:08] Revelation you start eating on that a
[1:10:10] bit and you get that original sin down
[1:10:12] you start finding out that God is not
[1:10:14] three people
[1:10:16] it's so sweet in your mouth anybody who
[1:10:19] can remember that far back
[1:10:20] let me see your hand if you can remember
[1:10:22] how sweet the godhead was when God began
[1:10:25] to reveal it to you
[1:10:27] water baptism
[1:10:30] when you found out you had never been
[1:10:31] baptized the right way in Christian
[1:10:33] baptism you wanted to get to that water
[1:10:36] and be baptized
[1:10:38] and it was like you've been serving the
[1:10:40] lord all your life but you feel like a
[1:10:41] newborn baby that day because you were
[1:10:44] doing it right because you were doing it
[1:10:46] by Revelation and it is so sweet and so
[1:10:49] easy to enjoy and everything is so
[1:10:53] inspirational
[1:10:57] the Mysteries start being revealed and
[1:11:00] opened up
[1:11:01] in the message the anointed ones at the
[1:11:03] end time paragraph 262.
[1:11:06] brother Brown said notice the very day
[1:11:08] when this messenger when he starts on
[1:11:12] when he begins to declare his message
[1:11:14] see the first pull healing
[1:11:17] the second pull prophesying
[1:11:21] third pool the opening of the word the
[1:11:26] Mysteries revealed no more there's no
[1:11:29] more higher order to reveal the word
[1:11:31] than Prophets
[1:11:34] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:11:36] Vindicated
[1:11:38] it's not by clouds
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:42] I'm going to preach till I'm done
[1:11:45] you might as well help me
[1:11:48] because you're not eating lunch until
[1:11:49] I'm finished
[1:11:53] Uber squeeze out little amen
[1:11:57] it's not because there was a Halo or a
[1:12:00] pillar of fire picture over his head I
[1:12:03] want to be honest with you I know the
[1:12:05] pillar of fire was there
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:08] I know it was there whether he was
[1:12:10] photographed or not I know the pillar of
[1:12:12] fire was there
[1:12:15] I've seen the pillar of fire and I
[1:12:17] believe with all my heart that the
[1:12:19] pillar of fire was there that day
[1:12:21] hanging over by the Bantam
[1:12:22] and so now that they write articles
[1:12:24] about uh fluorescent lights and and all
[1:12:28] kinds of things that could have made it
[1:12:30] look like I don't care I want you to
[1:12:32] know today I don't care
[1:12:35] my soul is not Based On A Photograph
[1:12:39] I don't believe this message because
[1:12:41] there was a cloud
[1:12:46] somebody said what if that was Jesus
[1:12:47] Christ I know I'm not following a cloud
[1:12:53] when brother Perry green got off the
[1:12:55] plane in the Congo
[1:12:58] they came up to him and asked him are
[1:13:00] you one of those cloud worshipers
[1:13:04] because in Congo there are tens of
[1:13:06] thousands of believers who worship that
[1:13:08] picture
[1:13:11] who bow their knee to that picture
[1:13:14] they see that little image of Jesus in
[1:13:17] there and they use that like a Catholic
[1:13:19] icon
[1:13:21] you don't have to say a word
[1:13:23] I'm laying this out for you
[1:13:26] we don't Pastor that all over our walls
[1:13:28] even though we believe it's a
[1:13:29] supernatural sign
[1:13:31] but we're not following a cloud we are
[1:13:34] not worshiping a cloud picture
[1:13:37] it's not the signs and the Wonders and
[1:13:40] the Miracles and the discernment that
[1:13:42] we're after
[1:13:43] we're after the opening of the word
[1:13:47] and we're taking this message and laying
[1:13:49] it in the word
[1:13:52] we're checking it out because that's
[1:13:54] what he told us to do
[1:13:57] how many times did he say don't take my
[1:14:00] word for it
[1:14:03] it has to Dove tail with this word we're
[1:14:06] your amens now
[1:14:09] tale with this word
[1:14:11] so it's not signs and wonders and we
[1:14:14] believe it yes yes yes brother Shelly do
[1:14:17] you believe there's a voice that spoke
[1:14:19] out at the baptism and said as we I
[1:14:20] believe it with all my heart
[1:14:22] but that doesn't make me follow this
[1:14:24] message
[1:14:33] because the Bible doesn't say Believers
[1:14:35] will follow the signs
[1:14:39] the Bible says signs
[1:14:42] thank you sister Anna
[1:14:45] the Bible said signs will follow the
[1:14:47] Believers
[1:14:48] we ought to be so used to signs and
[1:14:50] wonders that we just say praise God
[1:14:52] praise God and keep going
[1:14:54] we ought to be a people but if the
[1:14:55] pillar of fire come and hung in this
[1:14:57] room as it has before and open our eyes
[1:15:00] were opened and people were able to see
[1:15:02] that Pillar of Fire hanging there it's
[1:15:04] only been just a few Services ago that
[1:15:06] someone sent me a clip
[1:15:08] and showed me what looked like a light
[1:15:10] appearing up there when and flashing
[1:15:14] like that we ought to be so so used to
[1:15:17] those things because we're Believers and
[1:15:19] signs follow Believers that we just give
[1:15:21] God praise and keep on going
[1:15:23] come on Church what's wrong with us
[1:15:26] we've gotten used to having no signs and
[1:15:30] no wonders but I want to see whatever
[1:15:32] God wants us to see
[1:15:34] hallelujah it's a supernatural message
[1:15:36] that we believe we're serving a
[1:15:39] supernatural God
[1:15:41] we're Supernatural people
[1:15:45] we don't have to follow visions of
[1:15:47] bridges and
[1:15:54] what if history doesn't bear it out I'm
[1:15:56] not I'm not following the history book
[1:16:03] I've had people challenge me before and
[1:16:05] tell me you're wrong I'm used to it
[1:16:10] and you know what the uses their source
[1:16:13] Wikipedia said
[1:16:18] you couldn't be preaching it right
[1:16:20] Wikipedia said
[1:16:23] and I said let me show you who Wikipedia
[1:16:25] is
[1:16:26] it's all the idiots
[1:16:32] in the world
[1:16:37] a few brainiacs thrown in
[1:16:40] a bunch of doofuses
[1:16:43] anybody can edit Wikipedia
[1:16:47] did you know that
[1:16:48] did you know you can go into Wikipedia
[1:16:51] and change an article
[1:16:55] you know an article can get changed
[1:16:57] multiple times a day
[1:17:00] did you know there are not many fact
[1:17:02] Checkers at work for Wikipedia
[1:17:05] and did you know they're always asking
[1:17:07] for money
[1:17:09] I said I'm not giving you a penny to
[1:17:11] give me bad information
[1:17:14] somebody said I read something negative
[1:17:16] about brother Branham do a search on
[1:17:18] Stephen Shelley
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:29] Elliot sent me a
[1:17:31] article of a vision
[1:17:33] of of
[1:17:34] Patriarchs coming out of a well
[1:17:38] that I was supposed to have my name is
[1:17:40] on it
[1:17:41] it circulated all around the internet
[1:17:44] and I had nothing to do with it
[1:17:48] never saw it it was Neville Johnson a
[1:17:50] friend of mine who's dead
[1:17:52] but it went around with my name on it
[1:17:54] and there were people around the message
[1:17:56] that said he's lost it now finally he's
[1:17:58] lost it
[1:18:00] and I've had very unusual visions and
[1:18:03] I've seen the Patriarchs in the spirit
[1:18:05] and I'm telling you that out of my mouth
[1:18:06] now you don't have to read about it on
[1:18:08] Wikipedia
[1:18:09] and what I believe is the bride ought to
[1:18:12] be seeing Vision we ought to be seeing
[1:18:14] in the spirit
[1:18:16] and we can if we position ourselves to
[1:18:19] do so hello
[1:18:21] but you can't trust it because Google
[1:18:24] said it my goodness how many people have
[1:18:27] come through a prayer line asked me to
[1:18:29] pray for them and then told me what
[1:18:30] Google said they had
[1:18:34] are you going to listen to Dr Google are
[1:18:36] you going to come to the throne and
[1:18:38] believe that God can heal you you
[1:18:42] self-diagnosing somebody
[1:18:46] all you do it when you do that is
[1:18:49] looking for a place for fear to Lodge
[1:18:53] shut the door
[1:18:55] somebody said I can pray better when I
[1:18:57] have a name for it call it a devil
[1:19:01] you don't have to call it cancer You
[1:19:03] Don't Have To Call It by its official
[1:19:05] name just call it a devil and let's
[1:19:08] believe God to see the Miracles
[1:19:12] so we love these stories
[1:19:15] I met people who said I can't follow
[1:19:17] this message because there was no Silver
[1:19:19] Tip grizzly
[1:19:22] foreign
[1:19:27] there's been many Silverton Grizzlies
[1:19:31] anytime a Grizzly gets old
[1:19:34] his hair starts to turn gray on the tips
[1:19:37] there's been many they said that brother
[1:19:39] Branham said he was going to kill one
[1:19:40] and and he didn't get to kill that one
[1:19:42] and knowing he explains it
[1:19:47] he got swayed by the weather and the
[1:19:49] brethren
[1:19:51] that's all
[1:19:53] and he said it went right through me
[1:19:58] I wonder how many things have gone right
[1:20:00] through us
[1:20:01] because we said we were waiting on it
[1:20:03] but we never positioned ourselves to
[1:20:05] receive it
[1:20:06] and so somebody said I can't believe the
[1:20:08] message because there was a vision there
[1:20:09] that didn't come to pass like it was
[1:20:11] supposed to come to pass I want you to
[1:20:13] know I'm not following this message
[1:20:15] because brother Branham had a vision
[1:20:18] I saw my first Vision at 18 months old
[1:20:23] I'm not following this message because
[1:20:25] brother random saw a vision
[1:20:29] or because a voice spoke out of heaven
[1:20:31] and said your message is going to
[1:20:33] forerun the second coming Christ I
[1:20:34] believe it I believe it but that's not
[1:20:36] why I'm following this truth I'm
[1:20:38] following this truth because I can take
[1:20:40] this word that that we have on on tape I
[1:20:43] can hear it and I can read it and then I
[1:20:45] can take it over here and lay it in the
[1:20:47] word of God and watch how it dovetails
[1:20:50] and I know how sweet it gets in my mouth
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:56] or taste and see the Lord is good and
[1:20:59] then I have been around long enough
[1:21:01] that it eventually gets down the
[1:21:03] esophagus
[1:21:07] and it gets to the belly
[1:21:10] people say things like you're a brand of
[1:21:12] Mite and
[1:21:13] starts feeling bitter
[1:21:16] and you're following a dead man
[1:21:20] and I'd always tell them everybody is
[1:21:25] he died before he lived
[1:21:29] I said Jesus was dead for three days
[1:21:31] you're going to quit following him
[1:21:35] and then they start saying that old
[1:21:36] serpent Seed doctrine that's of the
[1:21:38] devil
[1:21:40] I can't fellowship with people who don't
[1:21:42] believe hell is eternal
[1:21:44] I don't want anything to do with people
[1:21:46] that and don't they know that brother
[1:21:48] Brandon was the last prophet there will
[1:21:49] never be five-fold prophets anymore and
[1:21:51] they'll never be
[1:21:53] the gifts are done away with because the
[1:21:55] perfect all the stuff we've heard
[1:21:57] through the years and the belly starts
[1:21:59] getting so bitter
[1:22:02] and they put you in and they and they
[1:22:04] put you out and they put you in and they
[1:22:06] put you out and they take you in and
[1:22:08] they put you out it seems so much like a
[1:22:10] denomination
[1:22:13] and you know what the bride does
[1:22:15] she just keeps her eyes on the word
[1:22:20] he puts him front let's on her eyes and
[1:22:23] she keeps following Jesus focusing on
[1:22:25] Jesus Christ she's not following this
[1:22:27] truth because of a Wikipedia article
[1:22:29] she's not following this truth because
[1:22:31] of a vision of a bridge or a picture of
[1:22:33] a cloud
[1:22:36] or somebody got healed or didn't get
[1:22:38] healed
[1:22:41] well I hear people saying that every
[1:22:43] person brother Brandon prayed for got
[1:22:44] healed that's not what brother random
[1:22:46] said
[1:22:49] I can show you an article written by a
[1:22:51] man who claims to have been in the
[1:22:53] meeting and did not receive his healing
[1:22:54] do you think I'm going to let that one
[1:22:57] testimony that one book that will sit
[1:22:59] around among the United Pentecostal
[1:23:01] Church you think I'm going to let that
[1:23:03] one thing dissuade me
[1:23:06] from what my heart is telling me when I
[1:23:09] take this word back to the word
[1:23:15] somebody said did you know he told a
[1:23:17] story one time and put the wrong name
[1:23:18] there
[1:23:21] I'd like for you to find me somebody
[1:23:23] that's been preaching as long as he did
[1:23:25] that hasn't made that mistake
[1:23:30] brother random did not have the gift of
[1:23:32] perfect recall
[1:23:35] many gifts were operating in his life so
[1:23:38] I'm telling you if you get to the place
[1:23:41] that you want to find vault
[1:23:45] there will be fault to find
[1:23:51] if you want to reason you can reason
[1:23:54] and if you're looking for an excuse come
[1:23:57] see me
[1:23:58] because I can give you reasons and
[1:24:00] excuses why you should run the other way
[1:24:06] but if you are willing to stick with the
[1:24:09] word
[1:24:11] that bitter belly is there for a reason
[1:24:16] we are being shaped
[1:24:19] and molded and sculpted
[1:24:23] cracked
[1:24:25] We are Becoming crack pots
[1:24:29] because every vessel of Honor
[1:24:32] has to pass through the testing
[1:24:35] of the bitter belly phase
[1:24:41] those who are of another seed
[1:24:43] will never survive
[1:24:46] the bitter belly phase
[1:24:49] they'll fall by the wayside
[1:24:53] but there's going to be a people who
[1:24:55] finish
[1:24:58] they're not going to be puffed up with
[1:25:00] bride Pride
[1:25:01] they're not going to be puffed up I'm
[1:25:03] predestinated
[1:25:10] they're not going to be like that little
[1:25:12] girl so many years ago at the Ohio camp
[1:25:15] whatever it was 90 something in the
[1:25:17] early 90s who walked up to I said well
[1:25:19] sweetheart where do you go to church
[1:25:23] I think she's the one who told me
[1:25:26] that she couldn't hate the devil
[1:25:30] she said I just can't hate the devil she
[1:25:33] said my preacher's been telling me all
[1:25:34] to just hate the devil and and I just
[1:25:36] don't find it in my heart to hate him I
[1:25:38] said I hate him enough for both of us
[1:25:43] there are some things we ought to hate
[1:25:45] sin is one of them
[1:25:48] unbelief is one of them
[1:25:50] God hates some things
[1:25:52] oh yes he does
[1:25:54] he hates lying tongues
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:57] he hates those who saw Discord among the
[1:26:00] brethren
[1:26:01] there are some things you said to write
[1:26:02] in the book
[1:26:03] I said well honey you can hate the devil
[1:26:06] and be all right
[1:26:07] you can hate him
[1:26:09] and stay away from him
[1:26:11] I said if you don't like something you
[1:26:13] stay away you run as fast you can I said
[1:26:15] by the way who is your pastor she said
[1:26:18] brother Branham
[1:26:24] I said honey whatever do you mean
[1:26:27] she said yes he's my pastor
[1:26:30] you said our our we have a whole group
[1:26:33] and brother Brandon is our pastor I said
[1:26:35] well sweetheart brother Branham is dead
[1:26:40] who kisses the babies
[1:26:43] come on
[1:26:45] who buries the Dead
[1:26:47] who takes the midnight phone calls
[1:26:53] who spends their life on their knees
[1:26:55] praying
[1:26:58] who untangles the messes
[1:27:01] who pulls Brothers off of Brothers and
[1:27:03] Sisters of the sisters of time
[1:27:06] who settles the masses among you oh well
[1:27:09] well we have a minister
[1:27:13] there are people who get so out of
[1:27:15] balance
[1:27:17] and it doesn't make me want to get out
[1:27:19] of balance it makes me want to keep my
[1:27:21] balance in the scripture
[1:27:23] this word is the absolute
[1:27:29] tapes can only be an absolute when they
[1:27:33] line up with the word
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:37] when the prophet preached he didn't
[1:27:40] preach from his own knowledge his own
[1:27:42] quotes his own sermon thoughts
[1:27:45] his favorite quote book
[1:27:50] he didn't go to the next sermon and say
[1:27:52] brother Brandon said
[1:27:54] brother random say it
[1:27:56] if he was going to quote it he said the
[1:27:58] word say it the Bible said
[1:28:01] you're going to have to get through that
[1:28:02] bitter belly stage
[1:28:03] that next state I'm closing in a moment
[1:28:06] that next stage
[1:28:08] wow how did it get to be 142.
[1:28:11] somebody said well it followed 141
[1:28:13] that's how
[1:28:16] the next stage of partaking of the truth
[1:28:18] the food is uh it's so enjoyable and
[1:28:21] tastes so good it gets down in the
[1:28:22] stomach that's where the foods is
[1:28:24] digested and the acids start forming
[1:28:27] it goes through the main process of
[1:28:29] becoming part of you
[1:28:31] something's got to break down the food
[1:28:34] oh we really overwork our bellies don't
[1:28:37] we
[1:28:38] something's got to kick the fillers out
[1:28:41] the dies
[1:28:44] something's got to deal with the
[1:28:45] chemicals
[1:28:47] in the Plastics
[1:28:49] that we're eating
[1:28:51] because your food can't digest all that
[1:28:53] dye and all that stuff
[1:28:55] and so we're working and the acids are
[1:28:57] working and the digestive system is
[1:28:58] working
[1:29:00] and it starts it starts affecting you
[1:29:02] sometimes
[1:29:05] this is a stage that cannot be
[1:29:07] impersonated
[1:29:10] you can't just hang around the message
[1:29:12] and get through this
[1:29:14] you've got to swallow it all
[1:29:16] because when that word gets down in
[1:29:18] there and you start digesting it
[1:29:20] you start having to die out to self
[1:29:23] you have you have to start seeing
[1:29:25] yourself as you really are and your
[1:29:27] character starts developing you start
[1:29:28] ripening and changing and you start
[1:29:30] understanding that the Rapture is only
[1:29:33] for the overcomer
[1:29:37] Revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh
[1:29:40] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:29:41] even as I also overcame it and sat down
[1:29:44] with my father and his throne and you
[1:29:46] start thinking Lord God I've got to
[1:29:47] overcome I've got to overcome I can't
[1:29:50] let any I don't care how bitter this
[1:29:52] gets sometime I don't know how I don't
[1:29:54] care how much against what I've been
[1:29:55] taught this gets sometime I don't care I
[1:29:57] don't care I don't care this is against
[1:29:59] what my daddy taught me
[1:30:02] My mama taught me different my church
[1:30:04] taught me different my pastor taught me
[1:30:06] different My Bishop taught me different
[1:30:08] My denomination taught me different but
[1:30:11] something tells me
[1:30:13] that I'm growing in the word
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:17] so I'm going to keep eating
[1:30:19] now I'm going to keep depending on my
[1:30:21] spirit man to break it down to digest it
[1:30:25] to separate fact from fiction
[1:30:31] and I'm going to overcome and somebody
[1:30:33] said what do I have to overcome well
[1:30:36] it's real simple
[1:30:38] and it's real complicated
[1:30:43] it's not the drinking
[1:30:46] it's not the smoking give me just a
[1:30:48] minute and clean up let me clean up just
[1:30:50] a minute
[1:30:51] and I don't want the microphone to start
[1:30:52] shorting
[1:30:57] it's not the drinking smoking boy I came
[1:31:00] from Holiness and everything with sin
[1:31:06] no watch no ring no short sleeve no
[1:31:17] no sandal no open shoe no
[1:31:26] you that go barefoot you'd have been put
[1:31:28] out
[1:31:29] yeah
[1:31:33] not here
[1:31:38] we need you to help clean the carpet
[1:31:39] sister Jennifer's glad for you to come
[1:31:41] help clean the carpet
[1:31:45] like I told you the one preacher
[1:31:46] preached against Coca-Cola and he wanted
[1:31:48] to Double Cola
[1:31:50] to go with his chocolate cake
[1:31:55] one one church Preach you have to wear a
[1:31:58] hat the Sunday church one said it's a
[1:32:00] sin to wear it one said it's Pride not
[1:32:02] to and one said it was Pride too
[1:32:07] One Church said you can cut your hair as
[1:32:10] a woman as long as you put it under a
[1:32:11] covering
[1:32:13] and the other one said no you've got to
[1:32:15] have it long and the Bible said it's
[1:32:16] given you for recovery
[1:32:18] nobody could agree on anything
[1:32:21] and then I came to this message one day
[1:32:22] brother dawn and I was listening this
[1:32:24] sermon and brother Brandon said there's
[1:32:25] only one
[1:32:30] I laughed out loud I said to all that
[1:32:32] man I'm telling you he's missed it now
[1:32:42] they preached the sisters could only
[1:32:45] wear a round collar no they could wear
[1:32:48] a pointed collar no they couldn't have
[1:32:51] any collar
[1:32:54] the women were so confused they just
[1:32:56] about wore gunny sacks
[1:33:00] I remember
[1:33:03] you can't cut the back but you can cut
[1:33:04] the front that's why they all look like
[1:33:06] they had rooftops built up there on the
[1:33:08] front
[1:33:09] like an awning or something looks
[1:33:10] ridiculous
[1:33:15] you know Pentecostal poofs that were
[1:33:17] were chopped off
[1:33:23] you got even brother Branham can confuse
[1:33:25] you sometimes he's talking about putting
[1:33:27] manicure on your eyes
[1:33:32] and then one day I heard him say
[1:33:38] it's not smoking it's not cheating these
[1:33:41] are the attributes of sin it's
[1:33:44] unbelievable
[1:33:47] I said oh we gotta rewind this
[1:33:51] I've got to check this by the book
[1:33:54] there was no digital rewind it means
[1:33:57] stop rewind stop play
[1:34:01] no matter how many times I did it I
[1:34:04] could never get brother Branham to say
[1:34:06] that all these things were sin
[1:34:08] he kept saying it over and over again as
[1:34:11] I listen it's unbelief the rest are the
[1:34:14] attributes of unbelief you wouldn't
[1:34:16] struggle with what you struggle with if
[1:34:19] you could once and for all deal with the
[1:34:21] unbelief
[1:34:24] oh God help us
[1:34:28] somebody said I'm a Believer there's no
[1:34:30] unbelief in me let me tell you something
[1:34:32] though the man in the Bible said
[1:34:36] Lord I believe
[1:34:42] help thou my unbelief unbelief will
[1:34:45] creepy and help me
[1:34:47] doubts will creep in and you and I have
[1:34:50] to push them down every time
[1:34:53] because if we don't they will lead to
[1:34:55] the attributes of sin
[1:34:58] and we'll be picking up the habits and
[1:34:59] things of this world
[1:35:01] wait till I tell you I'm I'm coming to
[1:35:03] an end
[1:35:07] you that drove a mile to get here
[1:35:11] I'm preaching these that come a long way
[1:35:16] in a message called how can I overcome
[1:35:21] brother random tells you what you've got
[1:35:22] to overcome come on Cheaters read it
[1:35:25] don't wait on me to read it read it
[1:35:30] wish I could overcome that drinking I
[1:35:32] wish I could overcome that that
[1:35:34] wondering eye
[1:35:37] you can't
[1:35:39] you can
[1:35:40] you must
[1:35:43] you quit watching these sisters
[1:35:48] if you're a married man you look at your
[1:35:51] wife you quit looking at other people's
[1:35:55] your sister's mind the way you walk and
[1:35:57] mine the way you dress
[1:35:59] mind the way you carry yourselves and
[1:36:01] you men get you some bigger clothes
[1:36:07] because we don't want to do anything
[1:36:09] that would put a stumbling block in our
[1:36:12] brother's way
[1:36:15] when I preach those youth camps they
[1:36:17] didn't I didn't get to preach them too
[1:36:18] many times
[1:36:20] because I told some of those young girls
[1:36:22] you heard the prophet preach against uh
[1:36:24] high-heeled shoes so you all wear flats
[1:36:28] and I've never seen a more creative
[1:36:31] bunch of swingers and swayers
[1:36:36] it takes some effort
[1:36:38] to sway your hips in a pair of flats
[1:36:41] but I saw that spirit
[1:36:44] you can have the right kind of shoe wear
[1:36:47] preach brother
[1:36:49] and the wrong kind of spirit
[1:36:51] so sometimes we spend more time
[1:36:53] preaching on the kind of shoe to wear
[1:36:55] and we ought to be trying to deal with
[1:36:57] the spirit that causes a young woman to
[1:36:59] think that that's the way to catch a
[1:37:01] man's attention
[1:37:04] it's not all these little things that we
[1:37:07] have to overcome there's one big
[1:37:14] thing you have to overcome
[1:37:18] read it out Nathan is yourself your idea
[1:37:22] your thing
[1:37:24] and surrender yourself to him
[1:37:27] period
[1:37:28] and then watch the next sentence
[1:37:33] you've just got to stay in fellowship
[1:37:36] with the overcomer
[1:37:38] Jesus overcome for you so stay as close
[1:37:43] to him as you possibly can grab a hold
[1:37:46] of him and don't you let anybody talk
[1:37:48] you into letting go
[1:37:50] lay your head on his chest and listen to
[1:37:54] his heartbeat
[1:37:56] All In Love With Jesus Christ and love
[1:38:01] him more than you love yourself
[1:38:03] and you can overcome this wicked world
[1:38:05] and you can settle the indigestion in
[1:38:08] your spirit man
[1:38:11] bitterness speaks of death
[1:38:15] it's a hard stage where we have to die
[1:38:17] to self
[1:38:19] but it's in this stage that the that the
[1:38:22] character of Jesus Christ is in the
[1:38:23] people I'm nearly done how many times
[1:38:25] have I said that if I was telling the
[1:38:28] truth every time nearly nearly is a
[1:38:30] relative word
[1:38:32] I'm nearly done
[1:38:36] God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:38:38] paragraph 14.
[1:38:39] he said now think it I think it's our
[1:38:42] duty to make the inside right
[1:38:44] by the grace of God to be so grateful to
[1:38:46] God this will just not only be a
[1:38:48] beautiful building that will come to
[1:38:50] but may everyone who comes see the
[1:38:53] beautiful characteristic
[1:38:55] of Jesus Christ
[1:38:57] in every person that comes in
[1:39:00] may it be a consecrated place to our
[1:39:02] Lord a consecrated people brother
[1:39:05] brother Levi I know that's what you want
[1:39:07] to build
[1:39:09] is a place that's consecrated to the
[1:39:11] Lord I know that's what you Indiana
[1:39:12] Saints are constructing as a place
[1:39:16] I know that's what you folks there in
[1:39:18] Ohio what what you want is it
[1:39:21] is is is a place dedicated to
[1:39:25] to displaying the character of Jesus
[1:39:27] Christ for no matter how beautiful the
[1:39:30] structure is that we certainly do
[1:39:33] appreciate the beauty of the church
[1:39:36] read it for me
[1:39:43] I trust it'll always be a house of God
[1:39:46] of beauty
[1:39:49] in the church age book
[1:39:51] he said unless we suffer
[1:39:54] with him we cannot reign with him
[1:39:57] you have to suffer to Reign that's part
[1:39:59] of this oh
[1:40:01] that preacher got me that preacher knows
[1:40:04] something about me somebody told him
[1:40:05] what I was saying out there before
[1:40:07] service
[1:40:08] it makes our Billy our bit our billies
[1:40:14] makes our goats so much better
[1:40:17] makes our belly so bitter when we I get
[1:40:19] texts all the time did he tell you
[1:40:23] did she say something to you
[1:40:27] someone said just a couple weeks ago and
[1:40:28] said three things that were talked about
[1:40:30] in our home last night you preached all
[1:40:32] three of them
[1:40:33] were you listening in on us
[1:40:35] this is how God works
[1:40:38] would you want to come to a service and
[1:40:40] be so disconnected from all of it that
[1:40:42] you've got nothing at all out of it no
[1:40:44] you won't God have you ever asked Jesus
[1:40:47] to come to your house that's what he's
[1:40:49] doing when the word comes nigh you
[1:40:54] the reason he said unless we suffer with
[1:40:56] him we cannot reign with him you have to
[1:40:57] suffer to Reign the reason for this is
[1:40:59] the character simply musicians are
[1:41:01] coming I'm just speeding now
[1:41:04] the reason for this is that character
[1:41:06] simply is never made without suffering
[1:41:10] character is
[1:41:12] it's not a gift
[1:41:15] you're not going to just have character
[1:41:17] granted to you because you believe a
[1:41:19] message of truth you're gonna have to go
[1:41:21] through the fire
[1:41:23] you're going to have to go through the
[1:41:24] bitter belly you're going to have to go
[1:41:25] through spiritual indigestion sometime
[1:41:27] while you're trying to break this word
[1:41:29] down and live it on an everyday basis
[1:41:32] character is a victory not a gift
[1:41:34] a man without character can't drain
[1:41:37] because power apart from character
[1:41:43] is satanic but Power with character
[1:41:47] is fit to rule
[1:41:50] are you willing to go through some more
[1:41:52] times of bitter belly syndrome
[1:41:55] if it'll bring you out on the other side
[1:41:57] with a character that's fit to rule with
[1:41:59] power and authority
[1:42:04] now I'm going to read this because this
[1:42:06] is what I wanted to get to it took me
[1:42:07] all this two hours to get here
[1:42:11] we need a Zeal in the land we need a
[1:42:13] Zeal in the church
[1:42:15] let me tell you what kind of zeal
[1:42:18] it comes from the laodicean church age
[1:42:20] the church age book be zealous and
[1:42:22] repent
[1:42:24] he said now this false church has zeal
[1:42:28] can you give me your undivided attention
[1:42:30] for just a few more minutes
[1:42:32] now this false church has zealed make no
[1:42:35] mistake about that her Zeal has
[1:42:37] literally been that of the Jews John 2
[1:42:39] 17 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me
[1:42:42] up
[1:42:43] but it is a wrong zeal
[1:42:46] it is for the house of their own
[1:42:48] building
[1:42:50] it is for their own Creeds dogmas
[1:42:53] organizations their own righteousness
[1:42:56] they're building something for
[1:42:57] themselves he said they have put the
[1:42:59] word out
[1:43:01] for their own ideas
[1:43:04] they deposed the Holy Ghost and made men
[1:43:07] into leaders
[1:43:09] they have put aside eternal life as a
[1:43:11] person
[1:43:14] Jesus
[1:43:15] and make it about good works or even
[1:43:17] Church Conformity rather than good works
[1:43:22] but here's the Zeal the bride's got to
[1:43:24] have right now right now right now
[1:43:26] but God is calling for another zeal
[1:43:29] it is the Zeal to cry
[1:43:35] you whispered it
[1:43:38] I am wrong
[1:43:41] and God Is Right
[1:43:44] and I need to meet him
[1:43:47] [Applause]
[1:43:50] my ways are wrong
[1:43:54] my ideas are wrong
[1:43:57] my church entity is wrong
[1:44:01] but God's word is right
[1:44:09] I look out across this congregation and
[1:44:11] I see
[1:44:12] some who need to be delivered
[1:44:19] and we have prayed for you and prayed
[1:44:21] for you and prayed for you and prayed
[1:44:23] for you as a body we've laid hands on
[1:44:26] you we've tried to cast The Devil out of
[1:44:28] you
[1:44:31] we've done everything we know to do to
[1:44:33] see you free and you are not free
[1:44:38] what you need to catch this morning as I
[1:44:41] close
[1:44:42] is you are constantly to this day making
[1:44:45] excuses for your wrong Behavior
[1:44:48] and you are blaming other people
[1:44:51] including your pastor you say
[1:44:55] for your sin
[1:44:59] there are things on that are a water
[1:45:02] under the bridge
[1:45:07] you cannot undo the mess you made
[1:45:13] there's one thing I've learned about
[1:45:15] eggs you better get your order right
[1:45:17] when Mama's at the stove
[1:45:21] because once you say scrambled
[1:45:24] there ain't no sunny side up
[1:45:30] fried eggs mama can adjust it if you
[1:45:33] catch her in time if you need a little
[1:45:35] lighter or a little sunnier or a little
[1:45:37] done I don't know why anybody would want
[1:45:40] to eat a fried egg well done
[1:45:43] because you like rubber
[1:45:46] but I like mine with some juice
[1:45:51] and if you really want to talk lunch
[1:45:54] you put that on a burger
[1:45:59] and you let that golden beautiful stuff
[1:46:02] run down over that oh my
[1:46:07] god let's close
[1:46:12] but once they're scrambled
[1:46:19] sometimes my wife will say honey uh
[1:46:21] fried or scrambled and I'll say
[1:46:23] whichever is easier
[1:46:25] and she said well it really doesn't
[1:46:27] matter but she knows I'd rather have
[1:46:29] fried sometimes I insist on Scrambled to
[1:46:32] make it a little little because you can
[1:46:34] cook for everybody at one one time
[1:46:35] instead of making everybody individual
[1:46:37] ones
[1:46:39] but once those eggs are scrambled you
[1:46:41] can't come back and say no I believe I
[1:46:43] won't mind pull to the side and fried
[1:46:44] sunny side up
[1:46:46] and sometimes we scramble Our Lives by
[1:46:50] our own foolish decisions and then we
[1:46:52] expect other people to unscramble the
[1:46:54] eggs that we scrambled and it makes us
[1:46:56] somehow feel closer to God by making
[1:46:58] excuses
[1:47:00] for who made us do what we did but I'm
[1:47:02] telling you you do not I've asked God
[1:47:05] many times why some of you can't be free
[1:47:09] and I realize you're missing the right
[1:47:11] kind of zeal you can Praise Him you've
[1:47:13] got passion you you Faithful you come
[1:47:18] but you're missing something vital this
[1:47:20] morning and I'm telling you because I
[1:47:22] love you
[1:47:25] you are missing the grace
[1:47:31] I am wrong
[1:47:38] my religion has failed me
[1:47:42] I am wrong and God Is Right
[1:47:47] and I'm tired of blaming my my mama my
[1:47:51] daddy my brother my sister my old church
[1:47:54] my old Pastor my old Bishop my wife
[1:48:00] I'm tired of blaming my children
[1:48:04] for the life I'm living
[1:48:07] I am wrong
[1:48:11] now brother Brandon said now who's going
[1:48:13] to say that he is wrong
[1:48:17] what is it that all these denominations
[1:48:19] are based upon they claim to originality
[1:48:21] and that of God the the claim that
[1:48:23] they're right
[1:48:25] now they all cannot be right in fact not
[1:48:27] one of them is right
[1:48:29] they're white it's sepulchers full of
[1:48:30] dead men's bones they have no life they
[1:48:33] have no Vindication God never made
[1:48:34] himself known in any organization
[1:48:38] let's keep it loose
[1:48:41] let's don't organize it so God goes out
[1:48:44] he'll move out he'll move right out be
[1:48:46] very careful
[1:48:49] you can Church order
[1:48:51] God right out of the building
[1:48:54] I know message people that'll click to
[1:48:56] every claim and cling to every paragraph
[1:49:00] and every comma in church order
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:04] and they will ignore all 500 quotes
[1:49:09] that tell us we need tongues and
[1:49:11] interpretation and Gifts in the church
[1:49:12] but they'll hang to one paragraph one
[1:49:15] quote because it suits their lifestyle
[1:49:18] and they they know that a church where
[1:49:20] the gifts operate is a cleaner Church
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:26] just a minute
[1:49:27] Amen brother Shelley amen amen amen
[1:49:32] they need the Vindicated thus saith the
[1:49:34] Lord of God and they don't have it
[1:49:37] is that it
[1:49:38] he goes on but I don't think we have to
[1:49:40] go on with every bit of that God is
[1:49:43] calling in this hour for even you and I
[1:49:47] who follow the word to have another zeal
[1:49:52] not a Zeal to pray more we need to pray
[1:49:54] more not a Zeal to dance more we need to
[1:49:57] dance more
[1:49:59] but a Zeal to scream in his presence
[1:50:02] get on your knees before this day is
[1:50:05] over in the privacy of your home go find
[1:50:08] you there's 60 Acres of woods here
[1:50:11] it's not all Woods
[1:50:14] you go find you a spot
[1:50:16] you go find you a pine tree
[1:50:19] and you get down by that pine tree and
[1:50:21] you scream at the top of your lungs
[1:50:23] until you interrupt the volleyball game
[1:50:27] I
[1:50:30] am
[1:50:31] but God
[1:50:36] I Surrender
[1:50:43] yeah and he'll hear you
[1:50:45] you get up from that spot where the
[1:50:47] determination never to blame anybody
[1:50:49] else
[1:50:50] for the life you're living today
[1:50:53] we are not puppets
[1:50:57] you know what one of the precious little
[1:50:59] children in this church asked their
[1:51:01] parent
[1:51:03] this week
[1:51:05] are we like toys
[1:51:07] to God
[1:51:13] I can tell some of you aren't
[1:51:14] grandparents
[1:51:21] I'm just an adopted grandparent
[1:51:24] but I thought that was the most
[1:51:26] wonderful thing I'd ever heard
[1:51:28] we're not puppets this would be my
[1:51:31] answer
[1:51:32] no darling we're not like puppets
[1:51:35] where God is pulling the string
[1:51:38] but yes
[1:51:40] we are like toys to God
[1:51:44] in many ways
[1:51:47] because when we're children
[1:51:49] and we get a new little Purdy to play
[1:51:51] with
[1:51:53] we're not old enough to know that you
[1:51:55] don't love things you love people and we
[1:51:58] get those little pets or we get those
[1:51:59] little toys and we love them so much and
[1:52:02] we're so proud to have them and to hold
[1:52:04] them and to cherish them and I in in
[1:52:07] that way we're just like that to God
[1:52:10] the word in the scripture says we are A
[1:52:13] peculiar people
[1:52:16] that word peculiar is a word that comes
[1:52:20] from segula and the word secular is the
[1:52:24] most
[1:52:26] prized possession
[1:52:29] King
[1:52:31] we are his secular
[1:52:37] his most prized possession
[1:52:41] he loves us he wants to help us could we
[1:52:47] stand
[1:52:49] Benjamin come lead us in worship
[1:52:54] if I had a trophy
[1:52:57] I would hand them out
[1:53:00] and thank you for all your help today
[1:53:07] before

[2:00:04] on the Lord's beloved
[2:00:07] he loves you
[2:00:10] he loves you with an unconditional love
[2:00:15] he doesn't love you because you obey him
[2:00:17] he loved you before you were ever born
[2:00:21] he loved you when you were just a
[2:00:23] thought in his mind
[2:00:25] and he is for you and not against you he
[2:00:29] wants to call you into closer fellowship
[2:00:32] with him Lord we have spread our arms
[2:00:35] before you today to say we are wrong

[2:03:57] in the name of Jesus
[2:04:00] in the name of Jesus
[2:04:07] brother Levi Yoder
[2:04:09] while there's a spirit of prayer here
[2:04:11] would you come and tell us about this
[2:04:14] prayer request that you presented to
[2:04:16] brother Greeley or I could read it but
[2:04:18] why don't you just tell it
[2:04:20] this is something we want to pray for as
[2:04:22] a body yes this morning as I felt that
[2:04:25] the Lord is here I just was reminded
[2:04:28] there's a lady in Amish lady in savemore
[2:04:31] Missouri who started reading about the
[2:04:33] life of William Branham she told me when
[2:04:35] I saw the song only believe for the
[2:04:37] first time in my life it just started
[2:04:40] ringing in my mind as I was about work
[2:04:42] she wrote me this letter
[2:04:44] and she said that after a while the lord
[2:04:47] gave me a tune for this song and I began
[2:04:49] to sing it and then I wondered is there
[2:04:52] anywhere attuned to this song and she
[2:04:54] looks through a himmel until she found
[2:04:56] the chorus and she said that the tune
[2:04:59] was almost exactly like she was singing
[2:05:02] and then her grandson was born I think
[2:05:05] an eighth child to her daughter and he
[2:05:09] was born with deformity on his head and
[2:05:13] the chiropractor said it's a very bad
[2:05:15] case he does not know whether it can be
[2:05:17] fixed it can be fixed or not but it's
[2:05:19] going to be very bad if it does not
[2:05:22] straighten out so she said that she just
[2:05:25] she was not planning on continuing to
[2:05:28] write me letters but she wrote me saying
[2:05:30] that the Lord put it on her heart that
[2:05:32] we can just believe for this healing and
[2:05:35] I just need to write you and ask you to
[2:05:37] ask all your friends such as pray and
[2:05:39] pray and pray for her grandchild and she
[2:05:43] said that he his name is Baby Petey
[2:05:47] which is Peter maybe Peter so she just
[2:05:51] asked for all my friends to pray and
[2:05:54] this morning that got on my heart and I
[2:05:56] just asked you all your own
[2:06:01] with this
[2:06:03] oh Jesus you
[2:06:04] just use precious Heavenly Father this
[2:06:06] this uh grandmother's heart was moved by
[2:06:10] you
[2:06:11] and Lord the deep is calling to the Deep
[2:06:15] Lord you revealed to me that it's not
[2:06:18] because that she wants that baby to be
[2:06:20] healed but it's because she wants you to
[2:06:22] be Vindicated in her family yes Lord
[2:06:25] Lord manifest yourself you said these
[2:06:28] signs shall follow them to believe and
[2:06:30] she believes and she believes that we

[2:07:15] Christ's name we pray
[2:07:16] amen let's go hold it one one moment
[2:07:23] brother
[2:07:24] deodorant
[2:07:27] these other brothers brother Elam
[2:07:30] they're humble brothers who don't brag
[2:07:34] and
[2:07:36] they're doing some things these These
[2:07:38] are precious people who are doing a work
[2:07:41] I I would like for him to lead us in
[2:07:43] prayer for the Amish communities
[2:07:50] I want to mention again the Millers who
[2:07:52] are here from Missouri
[2:07:54] the first time that they ever came they
[2:07:57] were
[2:07:58] they checked into a motel here at for
[2:08:01] camp meeting and they were treated
[2:08:02] terribly
[2:08:05] they were carrying in some of their food
[2:08:07] or something in the and the motel was
[2:08:10] offended by that and they were they
[2:08:12] thought it was something it wasn't and
[2:08:14] they treated them so bad and it it upset
[2:08:17] me so bad I wouldn't have had that to
[2:08:20] happen to them for nothing I fell in
[2:08:22] love with them and we talked for hours I
[2:08:25] sat in wet clothes after baptizing them
[2:08:28] and God gave them to this ministry as a
[2:08:32] seed of what he wanted to do and it gave
[2:08:35] me so much encouragement to keep praying
[2:08:37] for the Amish people and now we've met
[2:08:39] so many precious people that God has
[2:08:41] brought out and and I'll be honest with
[2:08:44] you Brethren I've told you I don't want
[2:08:46] people to leave the Amish faith and end
[2:08:49] up in another backslid denomination
[2:08:52] I don't want them to look like the
[2:08:54] modern Pentecostal world I want them to
[2:08:57] come to the message of the hour the
[2:09:00] truth for them and I believe there's a
[2:09:02] big bride I believe there is a many
[2:09:05] membered bride in the Amish and the
[2:09:07] Mennonite World among our anabaptist
[2:09:10] brethren
[2:09:11] and I felt led brother Elam you come
[2:09:13] over here all of you brothers that have
[2:09:16] come all of you that have come out of
[2:09:18] the Amish community some of them you'd
[2:09:21] never know you you you're looking at
[2:09:23] them you'd never know where they come
[2:09:24] from
[2:09:26] but I want these brothers to agree
[2:09:28] brother
[2:09:29] the older has the mic and then let
[2:09:31] brother elim pray too but would you all
[2:09:33] just do this for me you know some of you
[2:09:36] know how dear these people have been to
[2:09:39] me and I want us to ask the Lord
[2:09:43] to bring more out and in we don't want
[2:09:47] them just out we want them in to reveal
[2:09:50] the message and they're giving the the
[2:09:52] church in Ohio as has provided I think
[2:09:56] some Supernatural books brother Chad
[2:09:58] Lamb and the people there are providing
[2:10:00] they're the ones who reprinted the
[2:10:02] supernatural books and they're they're
[2:10:04] giving them to be given and there are
[2:10:08] Brethren here today that are believing
[2:10:11] the truth because brother Levi took him
[2:10:14] the supernatural books
[2:10:16] there's a sister here whose dad he
[2:10:19] didn't read this that's what we give
[2:10:21] people we want to break them in gentle
[2:10:23] we give them the supernatural books but
[2:10:26] somebody but you he took the church age
[2:10:28] book
[2:10:29] and he and there's a lot in the church
[2:10:31] age book that's a lot different than
[2:10:33] than most churches and he grabbed a hold
[2:10:36] of that and it spoke to him and it
[2:10:39] ministered to him and helped him so much
[2:10:41] so we just need to leave this up to God
[2:10:44] don't we how it gets witnessed pray
[2:10:47] brother
[2:10:48] like you actually share with us a little
[2:10:50] bit about sharing of the supernatural
[2:10:52] books
[2:10:54] I had this on my heart for over a year
[2:10:57] that I would like to advertise these
[2:10:59] books in a Amish newspaper oh I didn't
[2:11:03] know and and I was I was wanting to do
[2:11:06] it and I didn't quite understand why I
[2:11:08] don't just do it but I didn't just do it
[2:11:10] until one morning as I woke up this was
[2:11:14] just on my heart like you need to do it
[2:11:16] now and I said okay Lord now you asked
[2:11:19] me to do it when I really don't have the
[2:11:21] finances to do it but you said do it so
[2:11:23] we'll do it and that day brother Chad
[2:11:26] Lamb came to our house was a brother
[2:11:28] from Poland I can't quite say his I
[2:11:30] can't either but I know who you're
[2:11:31] talking about uh and and he and and I
[2:11:35] told them about that that I woke up the
[2:11:37] morning lord said do it and I didn't
[2:11:38] tell them that I was lacking Finance I
[2:11:40] said I'm just gonna do it I knew I could
[2:11:41] at least do a little bit right so
[2:11:44] um
[2:11:47] these brothers brother Jan and brother
[2:11:51] yasick brother yasik from Poland uh
[2:11:56] we're getting ready to leave and brother
[2:11:57] Yazi pulled some cash out and puts it in
[2:11:59] my hand and I don't look at he says this
[2:12:01] is for advertising those about these
[2:12:03] Supernatural books I put it in my pocket
[2:12:05] after he leaves it's 300 cash from
[2:12:08] Poland praise God
[2:12:10] and so I I go into the paper that
[2:12:14] afternoon I get these advertised and
[2:12:19] because of that advertisement they're

[2:12:59] send them out when I asked them to

[2:25:55] let me see
[2:26:02] will you come in will you come and tell
[2:26:05] it can you tell the story
[2:26:09] this is what kept me up a little last
[2:26:11] night
[2:26:19] we were grinding meat
[2:26:23] um
[2:26:25] with the second time through
[2:26:28] hammered for a neighbor and
[2:26:33] usually I don't let the children help me
[2:26:35] with that except I I would like we have
[2:26:38] this grinder that has a six inch neck
[2:26:42] and anyway
[2:26:44] she helped me
[2:26:46] I I said all along one child to help me
[2:26:49] but just put it up here on the tree and
[2:26:51] uh
[2:26:52] anyway she ended up
[2:26:54] I I was turning to empty the bull and uh
[2:27:01] out of the corner of my eye I see her
[2:27:03] reach down into the hole and
[2:27:11] foreign
[2:27:19] ER I mean really I mean it isn't minor
[2:27:23] but it is I mean it's not a life but
[2:27:28] it's hard
[2:27:45] yes he's good he's good that song this
[2:27:48] morning exactly I mean I couldn't have
[2:27:50] said it better
[2:28:03] it's amazing it's harder now than it was
[2:28:06] to start with that doesn't really make
[2:28:08] sense but
[2:28:10] it was like God was there in every step
[2:28:13] of the way
[2:28:15] um
[2:28:16] I just grabbed the hand made so she
[2:28:18] couldn't see it and I told her I said
[2:28:22] um her brother screamed when he heard
[2:28:24] heard it or heard I I grabbed I lunged
[2:28:29] over and shut off the switch I mean it
[2:28:31] was just a second or two but
[2:28:34] um
[2:28:35] so
[2:28:38] thankfully I just grabbed the arm put my
[2:28:41] hand across the end of her hand so she
[2:28:44] couldn't see it because that was the
[2:28:46] first thought it was I don't want her to
[2:28:47] see it
[2:28:48] and I just grabbed her and I grabbed it
[2:28:51] hard enough I must have had a death grip
[2:28:53] on it it never bled
[2:28:54] and actually later that the doctor told
[2:28:57] me she said everything was so clean and
[2:28:59] so
[2:29:01] everything she said that just really
[2:29:03] helped to start with they said we're
[2:29:04] gonna have to do two surgeries and and
[2:29:06] do all
[2:29:07] so uh but anyway after we had the
[2:29:10] ambulance there and I was they life
[2:29:12] flighted her
[2:29:14] just they wouldn't have really had to
[2:29:15] but
[2:29:16] but uh they said they said it's not
[2:29:20] urgent since it's a clean cut off it's
[2:29:22] not like
[2:29:24] they're going to be able to put him back
[2:29:25] on so it's not like time is but they
[2:29:29] they ordered the Life Flight anyway but
[2:29:32] uh
[2:29:33] anyway so I'm going for the hospital and
[2:29:35] I'm I'm
[2:29:48] just being tempted to go
[2:29:52] back into my old rut of thinking
[2:29:58] of of just blaming myself and and just
[2:30:03] not getting over it
[2:30:05] then it was like God told me he said
[2:30:14] thank you Jesus he said it's you can
[2:30:19] stand in the way of
[2:30:24] oh
[2:30:28] yes
[2:30:30] yes it is all right
[2:30:35] he said you can stand in the way of my
[2:30:37] getting Glory or help me get the Gloria
[2:30:41] hear it and it was like all of a sudden
[2:30:45] that mind shift I mean that
[2:30:49] when God came it all of a sudden it
[2:30:52] turned around and it was like
[2:30:55] I was like she's going to get her
[2:30:57] fingers back
[2:30:58] not only am I going to do everything I
[2:31:01] can to make the devil pay he's gonna
[2:31:03] give back what he's stolen yes
[2:31:07] because that I I suddenly I realized
[2:31:10] Satan comes to kill steal and destroy
[2:31:12] and that was this was part of that
[2:31:15] process
[2:31:16] and that evening I texted Levi and I I
[2:31:19] text a different Brethren and said would
[2:31:21] you pray and uh
[2:31:25] it was funny because or God ordained
[2:31:28] there was three or four that sent texts
[2:31:31] back that said God can restore Limbs and
[2:31:34] and I and that was going through my mind
[2:31:36] before they texted me that and I said
[2:31:40] the devil's gonna pay and I'm going to I
[2:31:44] don't care if she doesn't get her
[2:31:45] fingers back on this side of Eternity I
[2:31:47] want her to get the fingers back and I'm
[2:31:49] I have faith in that I am trusting in
[2:31:51] that but if she doesn't I know she's
[2:31:54] going to have him on the other side yes
[2:31:56] but the other thing is
[2:31:59] God I mean it was just so plain like I
[2:32:02] have the choice to either stand in the
[2:32:04] way and block the glory of God that's it
[2:32:06] should get or or or or help and and
[2:32:10] anyway I just uh so I'm standing in
[2:32:13] faith that she will received her her
[2:32:15] limbs totally at um
[2:32:19] the hand is cut
[2:32:21] she's still got the little finger but
[2:32:23] it's cut like across here so so she
[2:32:25] doesn't have a thumb or the three longer
[2:32:28] fingers she's just got the pinky and
[2:32:32] but I I the thing that touched me later
[2:32:35] I mean it was like everything happened
[2:32:36] in the blink of the eye but
[2:32:38] she said am I going to die I said no I
[2:32:41] said Jesus can heal you and so
[2:32:44] she just
[2:32:50] [Laughter]
[2:32:53] cried out to God she said
[2:32:58] I need you now please heal me I need you
[2:33:01] now
[2:33:04] later when she had the cast
[2:33:07] she would say I think my fingers are
[2:33:09] starting to grow back listen listen
[2:33:12] um
[2:33:13] it's hard to
[2:33:15] so I didn't want to take that Faith away
[2:33:18] but I also wanted her to face reality
[2:33:21] but I was like I said
[2:33:24] you know you might not have those right
[2:33:26] away but I said
[2:33:28] I think you will have and I said
[2:33:32] you know God in other words I I don't
[2:33:36] remember all what I said but uh she's
[2:33:38] still she is still like we'll pray and
[2:33:40] we'll say you know God whenever you want
[2:33:42] to give her her fingers back and uh and
[2:33:46] she's she's still planning on that I
[2:33:49] believe it absolutely so isn't that
[2:33:51] wonderful anyway but I yeah I'd like to
[2:33:54] before you all go down listen at this I
[2:33:56] know you've already it's already been
[2:33:58] shared with you but maybe someone here
[2:34:00] would like to hear it
[2:34:02] in the message the fifth seal
[2:34:04] brother Branham said I believe
[2:34:07] I'm not going to speak in his name I'm
[2:34:09] going to speak in the revelation of my
[2:34:12] faith what happened in Sabino Canyon the
[2:34:15] other day
[2:34:16] I believe that the hour is approaching
[2:34:18] when missing limbs will be restored
[2:34:22] and the glorious power of the creator
[2:34:26] I believe if he can make a squirrel
[2:34:28] appear here is a man or woman just got a
[2:34:32] part missing and that's complete in it
[2:34:34] in itself he is God I love him
[2:34:39] I believe that
[2:34:41] when sister Flo lost a little tip of her
[2:34:44] finger and I was torn to pieces and she
[2:34:46] was as calm as a cucumber she said
[2:34:49] pastor somebody had to be missing a limb
[2:34:52] before God could restore a limb so don't
[2:34:54] you worry about that let's agree did you
[2:34:57] want to say something else I just I
[2:35:00] just Revelation when I was driving for
[2:35:02] the hospital that
[2:35:06] if
[2:35:16] they're always really stuck oh if if God
[2:35:19] would have wanted her without those
[2:35:22] three fingers in the thumb he would have
[2:35:24] made her that yes that was the thing
[2:35:26] when I just all of a sudden realized
[2:35:27] whoa this this was yeah yeah
[2:35:30] yes yes that's the restoration part
[2:35:33] reach your hand toward Mom and Dad they
[2:35:36] have five children at home by the way
[2:35:38] reach your hand toward them and let's
[2:35:40] just believe for their faith to remain
[2:35:42] strong and let's begin to speak those
[2:35:45] fingers back
[2:35:47] father in the name of Jesus we stand in
[2:35:51] agreement with this beautiful family
[2:35:53] that your word is yea and amen the world
[2:35:57] might mock us and they might laugh at us
[2:36:00] and they might think that we've taken
[2:36:02] leave of our senses but here we are Lord
[2:36:05] standing on the promise of your word
[2:36:08] that you are a creator
[2:36:10] if you can create around me in a bush to
[2:36:15] type the coming Christ you are more than
[2:36:19] able if you can do it in the ocean every
[2:36:22] day of the year causing that starfish to
[2:36:25] grow back his arm or leg or whatever
[2:36:28] it's called surely Lord you know how and
[2:36:32] your power is more than able to restore
[2:36:36] fingers on little Mariah's hand may they
[2:36:40] have great grace to keep the faith
[2:36:43] strong may she not grow discouraged in
[2:36:48] waiting for that moment for that hour
[2:36:50] and even now we begin to speak it with
[2:36:54] the authority of Jesus Christ and we
[2:36:58] call those fingers in the name of Jesus
[2:37:02] in the name of Jesus we call for
[2:37:07] restoration of her fingers on her hand
[2:37:10] in the lovely name
[2:37:14] Christ we pray amen
[2:37:17] and amen God bless you brother God bless
[2:37:21] you thank you for sharing with the whole
[2:37:23] body
[2:37:24] amen
[2:37:29] my brother that I could receive that for
[2:37:31] advertising without saying oh all right
[2:37:33] do it thank you thank you everybody
[2:37:40] when we advertised we put them down at a
[2:37:43] price including shipping or if you do
[2:37:47] not have to funds ask for a free book
[2:37:49] most of them have been given out as free
[2:37:50] books so it's all right swear to church
[2:37:52] and Lima comes in they're giving them
[2:37:54] all for free they're buying them by the
[2:37:55] cases having them printed and buying
[2:37:57] them in and getting them out
[2:37:59] all right God bless you
[2:38:03] be seated a moment this is what you
[2:38:05] should know
[2:38:07] because they don't often tell this part
[2:38:09] of the story
[2:38:10] but God placed it on brother Perry
[2:38:12] Green's heart
[2:38:14] for the supernatural books to be printed
[2:38:17] he found out that brother Owen Jorgensen
[2:38:20] was working on the books brother
[2:38:23] Jorgensen was not a rider
[2:38:26] he had made a little written a little
[2:38:27] pamphlet one time in a little booklet
[2:38:29] one time but he was not a writer
[2:38:32] and he decided that God was leading him
[2:38:34] to write brother branham's life story in
[2:38:36] a way that it could be presented to the
[2:38:39] world not in a religious way but in a
[2:38:42] way that you could just read it and
[2:38:45] enjoy the story he actually saw it and
[2:38:48] believed that it would be on bookstore
[2:38:50] shelves
[2:38:51] and brother green went to Brother
[2:38:54] Jorgensen and asked him
[2:38:57] what his salary would be for a year
[2:39:01] and he paid him a salary
[2:39:03] to finish writing the supernatural books
[2:39:07] so had it not been for brother green and
[2:39:10] brother Jorgensen working together in
[2:39:12] the beginning we wouldn't have those
[2:39:14] books and then the Lima Church took the
[2:39:17] burden and they packaged him so much
[2:39:19] nicer as they begin to come out
[2:39:22] and I took those books all over the
[2:39:24] world to charismatics and Pentecostals
[2:39:26] when I was preaching in their
[2:39:27] conferences and I met a woman in
[2:39:30] Jerusalem Chad you might have been
[2:39:31] sitting at the table with me I think you
[2:39:33] were we were having dinner in the hotel
[2:39:35] in Jerusalem and a woman walks over and
[2:39:38] said I want to thank you for those
[2:39:39] Supernatural books I hated William
