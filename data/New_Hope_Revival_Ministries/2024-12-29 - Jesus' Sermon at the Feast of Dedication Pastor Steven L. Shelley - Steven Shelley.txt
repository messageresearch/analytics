Lord Lord Brother Daniel will you come and pray please yes he is [Music] Lord he is Lord he has risen from the dead and he is Lord [Music] L every every knee shall bow every Tong [Music] confess I'm so sorry I didn't write one down that's very important to me today today and that is sister Shirley y brother Bill y's wife pastor of the lighthouse for Jesus in elizabethon Tennessee friends of mine for over 30 years sister Shirley has been suffering with pancreatis and uh other issues and the pain got so bad the other night that they rushed her to the hospital and they have found some spots and blockages and they believe that it's ugly stuff but they don't have the final analysis yet it's very it's very serious it's very very urgent it's blocking it's there's a blockage there and they're not sure if it's a tumor or malignancy or what it is and then they found some other spots the doctor used the word aggressive without telling them for sure without the Bible biopsy that the family is is really shattered and they are believing God for a miracle well he is a miracal working God and they did have a specialist come in yesterday and offer them a little bit of Hope still without a full uh diagnosis would you lift them up to the Lord I cannot tell you what they have meant to me through the years they have been uh real true blue friends and if I've ever known anybody to suffer we all have suffered in our way but that woman has been through more emotionally than most people I know would you ask the Lord to give her complete and total victory over whatever it is if that is his will she would only want his perfect will I know that forgive me for interrupting brother I I'm going to interrupt myself this morning I the heavenly father just so precious to meet with us this morning yes few weeks ago in our darkest hour I caught someone praying in a specific way and I kind of watched God adjust his train because the way this person was praying and I want to challenge you like Ruth of old like her mother-in-law told her now Ruth when you go into Boaz you pull that skirt down you get in there have the courage this morning as we ask in faith grab hold of his train this morning and allow the word of God what did he say he healed us with his word do you want his word this morning there's nothing else that we desire this morning but the word of God it's the same yesterday today and forever it cannot fail us [Music] Church cannot fail this morning Oh Lord You're Lord this morning morning there's no God like our God this morning why the world worships in some false Pagan form today we come to the Christ of Calvary that did not just die but he rose again and that life he sent back on his Saints and he said if your heart condemns you not ask what you will here we are today Lord we pour out our petitions there are many oh God we're asking you to perform your word once again as we lay under the train of your glory today Lord would you cover us and allow us to become the manifested word of God for the day an hour we live in today oh you're Lord You're Lord in our heart we want you Lord in our life we want you Lord in our mind we want you Lord everywhere no locked doors Lord no hidden places no secret sins oh God we're nothing without you we don't look at oursel this morning we don't come into your glory as if we were Sanctified enough we don't come into your presence as if we were glorified oh God the glory that we are is you it's just you will you wash over us will you put a glow in our heart will you put a spring in our step a smile on our face that the world would desire to know what we've come in contact with oh so many things to distract so many things to dissuade but oh God I am persuaded that you are all we need today your train is the word your voice is the word your life is the word give us your word today Chang us forever we'll praise you we'll honor you as Only You Deserve we ask it all in the name above all names Yeshua hamashiach Jesus the Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh we worship you Lord we worship you Lord for you are good and you're merciful hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord you may have your seats today thinking a few minutes ago when we were singing the second verse from Isaiah 6 Isaiah begin to say woe is me for I'm a man of unclean lips I'm undone but when he got in the presence of the Lord his terminology changed his voice his his words changed after he got in the presence of the Lord he heard the voice of the Lord said who will go for me but because he'd been in the presence of the Lord it was no longer woe is me here am I Lord send me we have had the opportunity today to be in his presence get everything under the blood know that because he is Holy that's TR brother we're not presenting ourselves we're presenting the perfect sacrifice and we can say Here I Am Lord send me praise the lord it's good to see you in the house house of the Lord Joyce and I are

you and I would fail we would fall here we are standing by the grace of God pressing on into the Lord Jes Jesus Christ to the fullness of who he is not just in somebody else but the fullness of who he is in me I'm thankful for that I'm glad to be pressing on today and so as we come to the end of 2024 we're going to receive the tithe and offering today if you have tithe and offering that you want credit for or if perhaps you need to catch up with your tithing uh just to keep Covenant with the Lord then you need to do that to before the end of 24 which means the last day you can get credit for

desire to see him in the fullness of his reality can we give the Lord [Applause] another hand clap of Praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated a moment there is an unusual atmosphere on the platform today I don't know if you're feeling it or not but there's something unusual that's happening on the platform I feel it in a in a I know that I don't have to run all these disclaimers but we don't we don't live by feeling I know all of that this isn't my first service but I know when there is something shifting so I wasn't surprised at what brother Daniel was sharing and he couldn't have helped himself just this is what I want you to understand there was such an inspiration that was flowing on the platform during worship that I I was preaching the entire time there were just there was an inspiration that came on every line that that that God connected it in my heart in my mind to something that is real and Rich and and I've learned that when that happens just speak it you you don't have to you don't have to do it loudly to disturb any but speak it out get it out of your mouth because there's such power uh he told us that there's power in the words the words that come out of our mouth they're they're both death and life that's in the tongue and I'm so thankful for for that inspiration I I feel it here and I don't know what will happen next but thank you for being along for the ride I appreciate it I I was standing there first giving thanks to God for a people like you who do not have to be prompted who do not have to be led by a cheerleader a praise leader saying won't you praise the Lord won't you lift your hand won't you say Amen won't you glorify the Lord why don't you get in here because you understand you understand what happens when we step from our comfort zone you know I I I you're quiet that's okay but but I don't accept all those excuses that we can make when we get in our flesh and our carnality we start saying things like well I'm an introvert you know you've been filling out too many questions questiones to figure out who you are you need to take a look in the book this will take you don't have to know what color you are on somebody's scale or what your letter is or what your personality type is we're not looking for our horoscopes you want to know who you are take a look just take a little trip through this book and let God Quicken to your heart the reality that this is you this is your story this isn't just his story this is your story and and I'm just so thankful for uh you this morning very very thankful for every one of you I can also feel the streamers and I know that there are some on the other end of this connection who are not sitting there with hands folded uh in some kind of sacred hush but I know that on the other end there are hands lifted up there are uh shouts of Praise there are tears there is joy and I can feel it when when uh you can too if you if you would think about it we can feel when people are connecting uh on a level of Faith it's important to put your faith in if you want something out you want something out of the service then you put something in I don't mean the offering place I mean your praise I mean your effort well I I I'm just bashful well I'm just shy look folks I don't see how you could possibly be so bashful that you could lift your hand you know we'll even let you do it Methodist style you know I think at times that's all right I'm just so I'll be honest with you one time my shoulder started freezing up and I'm so thankful that mine will still go over my head till I like to put it there as often as I can I would that men everywhere would lift up holy hands without wrath and without doubt there's there's not hatred in my heart toward anybody this morning and I don't doubt that he's exactly who he says he is so it doesn't mean that I am perfect it doesn't mean that I've got it all figured out it means that under those two circumstances I am invited by the New Testament to lift my hands and pray praise the Lord if you're mad at somebody repent I led a repentance prayer in my office this morning you you repent say Lord forgive me I don't want to be mad at anybody I don't want to have one scratch of ought against anybody you can get that taken care of in less than 30 seconds because you're not an orphan you're a Son of God and so all you have to do is say father I I am so sorry I really have let something enter into my heart and it started as a grain of sand and now I feel that it is becoming a a larger more like a cocko bur and it's it's agitating me and it's affecting my worship so Lord would you help me to get my eyes off of whatever this is that has been sent my way as a distraction and let me look to you Lord and see you in in Who You Are and remind me of who I am and and that took more than 30 seconds but you don't have to do all that you just say Lord help me forgive me have mercy on me well well I don't want to raise my hands because I I uh my wife you know I raised my voice you shouldn't do that but you just repent to God to her and lift up your hands well well I I just sass my husband or I did this or my kids or all you have to do is say Lord please have mercy I don't want this to be a repeated Behavior I don't want to keep losing it I don't want to keep losing my cool have mercy on me but I am here today to come into that presence and the only way to do it is to make my way in so I've got to move these things out of the way I want to say one more thing before we before we move on and I was just blessed by what brother gley shared about Isaiah and God showed me something along those lines many many years ago when you you look at Isaiah 6 where brother gley was talking under the inspiration from that song If if you will look at uh Isaiah 4 I'm not going to give a reference for her to to to particularly pull up but if you would look at Isaiah 4 and excuse me Isaiah 5 uh I don't know how many times I've underlined it uh in verse 8 in verse 11 in verse 18 in verse 20 in verse 21 in verse 22 I have underline this prophet Isaiah prophesying and each one of those times he says woe unto them now that's what a prophet's called to do to prophesy a warning woe unto them woe unto them woe unto them woe unto them you can't be offended in him he was doing his job he was doing what God had birthed him to do and and he was saying woe to you if you if you in fact in verse 20 he said woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put Darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter 21 woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight they think a little more themselves than they ought and verse 22 wo unto them that are Mighty to drink wine and Men of strength to mingle strong drink it it that's just three of the instances but I want you to know in uh chapter 6 as brother gy called it out and as we sung it in Isaiah 61 it says in the year that King oziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and his response now he was doing his job in chapter five woe unto them he was warning them giving them the counsel of the Lord amen are you listening but once he encountered this tangible glory of the Lord that shook the pillars of the house and shook him out of this tremendous grief of losing his mentor now there were a lot of things about Uzziah that that couldn't be admired but there were some things that he could be respected for and we learned that Isaiah had great respect for King Uzziah and he had he had his countenance had fallen because a friend or a mentor had died he's just prophesied woe unto them what and now the Lord comes it's powerful I I I don't want you e it when you get home but these seraphim begin to come in crying one to another holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory verse four and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with that's not cigarette smoke that that's not smoke from the forest fire that's holy smoke that's the glory of the Lord in a tangible way can do that now he can and he doesn't need the smoke machine he can do it a and the post of the door move and then listen look at verse five he spent the whole chapter uh five woe unto them but look at five of of chapter six then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts one Glimpse through the revelation of his word one glimpse of his Beauty his majesty his Holiness his authority and you will recognize that you don't have much time unless it's your assignment as a prophet you don't have much time to Woe anybody else you don't have much time to critique anybody else whoo under the he was doing his job folks I'm not I'm not criticizing him he was doing what God called him to do but when he saw the Lord ride in on pillars of smoke and shake the very Foundation post of the of the house of the Lord and his train is filling the temple and the Lord is sitting on the throne he he then said the next thing out of his lips was not of this filthy people that you've called me to it was my own lips are filthy my own lips are unclean and I've been sent

but uh we're doing that because for some the younger ones are going to stay till after the Midnight Hour they tell me they're going to uh we're going to have a time of worship at some point and they're going to play some games and that's perfectly all right it's our Hanukkah Fellowship for this year happens to be on the on the last day of the year and uh we're going to have a meal as you know and we will be uh we will be Gathering between 6:00 and 6:30 we say that because there will be setup involved and it would be wonderful if we could start the meal at 6:30 but if that doesn't happen uh it's important that you get here as close to 6:30 as possible so that we can can start eating and getting that out of the way and uh we're going to have a wonderful time it seems like it's been so long since we've even had a meal together it hasn't been but it feels that way and so let's look forward to that and let's uh let's make it a wonderful evening this coming Tuesday night no service in the sanctuary if that sounds unspiritual to you you you'll you'll manage somehow um I'm going to preach long enough today that you'll have both services covered and you'll be fine and um the other thing I want to mention is next weekend January the 3rd 4th and 5th Brother David Templeton uh is having some special meetings at his church yes and that's that's exactly right I had it wrote down Ben and I missed it today is brother Brent and sister Trisha's anniversary today how many years is it nine years is that right sister Trish we we'll we'll verify that nine years I think you all will make it happy [Music] anniversary praise the Lord um I just wanted to to tell you the name of their church is Word of Life Tabernacle and uh Friday evening is 6:00 Saturday evening is 6 o'clock and as I understand it brother Andrew Glover will be preaching Friday night I'm I'm going the Lord willing with my family Friday night and Brother David gadman is scheduled to preach uh on Saturday evening note that it's at 6:00 p.m. and not 700 p.m. um the name of the church is Word of Life Tabernacle and it's in the valley and you can ask Jonathan or others if you need or brother gy who have been uh it's real easy the address is 105 range Street Valley Alabama 36854 and it's a small uh building but brother uh David has told me brother Templeton that they have done some remodeling in the bottom and they have made an overflow room if necessary and with a with a HDMI uh stream in there they're just excited to fill it up I understand what that feels like the they they did he did text me this morning and asked that I would only mention one thing and that is they're more concerned about lack of parking than they are Pew space and so if you could uh carpool and make arrangements to go along together if you plan to be there uh Friday night or Saturday night we'd like to see you at your church on Sunday morning but Friday night or Saturday night at 6 if you uh plan to be there maybe you could uh you know pull together and you might even find someplace to leave a car or something and go over we don't want to overwhelm them but we want to support them uh we've been blessed by their Fellowship amen he was a blessing to us at camp meeting so I wanted to mention that to you let's stand it's 12:16 and I'm already taking time I won't greet the visitors again but I'm very blessed to have all of you here what a wonderful number we've had so much sickness until it's real encouraging to see the house nearly full today I I want us to just sing that little chorus he's the light we've been singing it every night this week I want us to sing that as we get ready to turn our hearts to the word is everybody well anybody need emergency prayer you're well all right let's get to it amen sing this with me he's the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he's the light of the world oh Yeshua is the light of the world sing Jesus he the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he's the light of the world oh Jesus is the light of the world one more time he the of the world and he shines his light upon us he's the light of the world oh Jesus is the light of the world I want to sing it one last time he the light of the world and he shines his light upon us he the light of the world oh Jesus is the light of the world I said my Jesus is the light of the world he is you believe that amen praise God praise the Lord he's the light would you just give God praise there was a little misunderstanding or miscommunication this morning about music and uh Benjamin then reached out and and some of you people had no power how many of you were without power in the night wow the campground was without power several hours and so it just didn't work out and and uh Benjamin just turned to Kate and said well you you're on and I'm so thankful that he was both willing and anointed to do so let's thank God for all the musicians they're just givers they just give and give and give and give and they're talented and blessed and we pray for their uh gifts that they will increase and be magnified and anointed because the anointing is what makes the difference do you believe that this morning would you turn in your Bibles I I've I've got so many notes here um would you turn in in fact I don't even have exactly everything I thought I had but would you turn to John you're going to have to forgive me because I really had a time this morning I just um I knew what the Lord had laid on my heart for this service but then I almost second guessed myself and and I was almost running well I was running a little bit late to even get here um because of that but it's all is good and we're here and we're here for a reason you believe that let's let's just go to John chap 10 beginning in verse one I I want to I want to call this message today Jesus's sermon at the Feast of dedication it is such a powerful chapter a and it would take us more than one service to break down this sermon you know I was reading this week where brother brandham and maybe might even be in one of the quotes I share with you this morning he's talking about the ministry of Our Lord only being three and a half years right I'm telling you that's a successful Ministry isn't it we've got so much that has been recorded about his Earthly Ministry and in the realm of time it only lasted three and a half years the Bible also tells us that that the world the world could not contain the Scrolls if everything that he did in his ministry was recorded now I mean to tell you what that says to me is his ministry was not only shifting things on the Earth but also all the way to the third heaven things were being moved around there's no telling what kind of confusion was caused in the second heaven where the enemy puts his throne and where his imps like us to dwell the prince of the power of the air the scripture tells us and so in order to record everything that was happening in Earth in second heaven third heaven all the way into the throne room of God the the the world wouldn't be big enough the LI there wouldn't be a library big enough to contain uh we're blessed to have four gospels aren't we we're blessed to have them and when we look at John chapter 10 it's so rich that we could never get to it all this morning but I want to focus on the fact that it took place during a very special time in Israel I know you're standing but let me just give you the context here for just a moment and that is there are approximately 400 years between the Old Testament the older Covenant and the New Testament what we would call the newer Covenant which is not a repl replacement of the old it is a fulfillment it's a fulfillment of the old and we're thankful for that he didn't come to destroy the instruction he came to fill it up I want you to know he did and more he filled it up everything the prophets of the old Covenant wrote about him he was that he did that he manifested that can you say Amen am so we're blessed by that but there was a 400e period of History uh between the Testaments and it was during that time uh that the the Army uh that we read about not in scripture but in history because again it was between the Testaments we read if you have ever looked at the book of mccabes let me say quickly to all critics I'm not in any way saying that it's inspired but brother brandham also quoted at times from Josephus who was a Jewish historian considered to be a traitor by the Jews because he reported some things concerning the ministry of Jesus and the early Apostles in a positive way so the Jews called him a traitor but we quote him because he wrote some things from a historical standpoint not inspired brother green one of my mentors that God used used in my life he enjoyed reading also for pleasure for for instruction some of those discarded uh books not giving them inspiration to the same level in any way of the scripture but but feeling like that there was perhaps something to glean that would help perhaps even make the scripture richer because it comes from a different perspective but lines up with the book did you follow that explanation so if you're looking at the book of mccabes or others they cover this period of time between the two Testaments and they tell us of what what we understand this great occupation of the Greek armies and uh the seusd armies and the destruction that They carried out in in Israel and the Jews were forbidden to circumcise their own babies I I'm going to tell you something when the government moves in and tells you you can't circumcise your own children you can't read your own scripture you can't worship the way that the the your your scripture tells you to worship uh I I've got a little bit of a problem with that we come to the New Testament where the apostles said we ought to obey God rather than man amen he tells us Render unto Caesar all that is Caesar's and unto God all that is God's and as much as lith possible with all of us we want to we want to we want to live in Holiness and we want to treat every body just as good as we can but sometimes we must stand for the word and so this family of the of the macbes we call them uh they they were just sick and tired of being sick and tired they wanted to worship God the god of Israel the way that they were commanded to worship Him and they were sick and tired of these generals coming one Army after another taking their freedom away from them and they said die if we must but we're going to stand up and God stood with them history records that God stood with them in such a profound way that they were able to drive back this whole Army the sald Army was turned backwards under its great General and they even as you hear me say often they even used elephants in Warfare but God let this little family and some rag tag uh tag along to push back the darkness for a period of time to to tear down the idols that had been built in the Holy Temple uh the the the uh statue that had been raised to Zeus or Jupiter depending on whether you're looking at Roman or Greek history tear it down and cleanse the altar that had been desecrated with with a hog a pig had been killed on the holy Altar and uh they scrubed that away and they rededicated the temple and it became a minor Feast not one of the Feast of Jehovah of the older Covenant but it became a minor Feast among the Jewish people the only reason why it means so much to me two reasons one is that in John 10 we find Our Lord in the temple during that time and we learn that if the scripture mentions the time he was there because all Jews were commanded to be there at least three times a year if the scripture mentions said he was there at a time other than the than the festivals that were commanded that a Hebrew man present himself there's a reason for it being mentioned we find that all the way through both covenants uh I love that because we weren't there and we don't know what time it was and most of the time we're reading the gospels we don't know what time of the year it was but if it tells us it tells us for a reason and I want to stand against paganism and and I want to stand against defilement and the mixture that comes with with that with that stuff can you imagine putting an idol right up in the house of God it's it's a serious crime a and so I think it will help us to see the the setting the time frame and what was being commemorated when Jesus preached one of the greatest sermon some people debate and they say the Beatitudes was the greatest sermon or The Sermon on the Mount but I think John 10 is one of the greatest sermons that he preached because this was the day that he decided by inspiration to tell the world who he really was he'd been hiding his true identity until this moment and In This Moment he wanted to let all all the truth out there and it really cost him something didn't it it did so John 10 verse one verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber and that's that's just really good instruction would I ever like to preach about that but but he that enter entereth in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth this is red letter and he calleth his own Sheep by name he knows my name I want you to look at somebody and say He Knows My Name he knows my name and he leadth them out praise God and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them if he's sending them out of the fold he goes before them leading them Hallelujah and the Sheep do what for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow there's something about that stranger's voice but they will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word I see that you need your seat and you may have it God bless you thank you thank you for your patience to stand for my introductory sermonette verse 6 this Parable spake Jesus unto them uh but this is commonly the case they understood not come with me they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them so he's talking and they're hearing or they're listening but they're not understanding they're not Discerning it's like talking to a brick wall anybody ever experience that in your family life or your work life or your you realize that they're hearing the audible sound of your voice but there is no discernment no understanding in what you are saying to them and Jesus found this to be the case often in his three and a half years of Earthly Ministry and it's very sad because even today it's that way a bit then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them if you understand anything about the second temple period you will know that many Heroes were rising up among the rebels the zealots and were declaring themselves to be the Messiah one by the name of Barba and there were many others who who uh wanted to draw a following and they wanted to lead the the people in a revolution that would have most likely ended in their in their Annihilation so God wouldn't let that happen do you understand uh the real Messiah was on his way and the scripture tells us that that something is going to be done the prophet of the Old Testament something is going to be done that's never been done before I'm going to do something that's never happened in the earth before a virgin not just a young Maiden but a young untouched Maiden is going to Bear a child think of this and he's going to be called Yeshua Jesus for for he will bring Salvation to his people it will be misunderstood but it will come it will happen at the right time at the right moment under the right conditions and the New Testament tells us in the fullness of times when time had filled up and the Earth could not go on any longer without a messiah without a savior showing up he was not going to allow the city of Jerusalem to continuously be trampled underfoot by its enemies uh keeping back the Messiah if you study a little bit about history here you'll find out that many of those who came and occupied the land of Israel did it because they had been warned that a messiah was going to come and set the Jewish people free and they thought if we go and occupy the land and persecute the Jews uh then we will keep the Messiah from coming it's much like today when you go to Israel and you you see the Eastern Gate how many of you know what I'm talking about the Eastern Gate of the Temple Mount and the Bible said that Messiah will come through that gate and so the Palestinian people the Muslims particularly they said well we know that a Jew will not pass a especially a A levite or a rabbi a holy man will not pass through a graveyard it's forbidden in their law the law of scripture so what we'll do is we'll bury our dead right in front of of the mountain so that he will not come through that I want you to know folks there has been no military General alive there has been no no people no religious people of any kind kind that have the power to keep Messiah back when the times are full and it it was so then and it's so now when Rapture time is here it'll be here whether you're ready or not it's here now we're in the process of rapture now we're already experiencing a portion of that Rapture now and and when that final culmination comes in a in a twinkle of an eye you won't be able to hold it back and he's not going to wait on you to be ready amen you understand he's just coming and you you better be ready and then when the second coming comes and he puts his foot on the Mount of Olives not one person or some uh campaign or whatever else is going to move that out of the timing of the lord I want you to know it is imperative I wish you'd help me it's imper erative for us to know not only the truth for the bride but to know the season the timing of the Bride the timing of the promises of God and we as a people have often missed our season the Bible talks about how they missed their day of what their day of visitation I have preached to you that if you plant the wrong seed the right seed excuse me you plant the right seed in the wrong season you won't get the right Harvest certain things you plan in the cold weather Fall going into winter certain things you plan after the Tha right it's not only important to have the right seed of truth it's important what you do with it and in what season there's a season to sew there's a season to reap there's a season to grieve there's a season to dance Ecclesiastes tells us for everything there is a season I want to be one of those who moves in the discernment of the Lord to know what season we're in and what we must do about the season that we're in there's a time to be passive hello there's a time to be active time to be quiet and wait and rest and there's a time to war that's right amen sir there's a few Hills that I'm willing to die on for truth amen there's a few things that are you know they don't really matter here or there it's uh uh it it's uh up for you know personal conviction or interpretation but there are a few Hills that I'm willing to give my life for I didn't just get in this yesterday and I certainly didn't get in it for a paycheck I want you to understand that because I did it when there was very little of that so it has nothing to do with the compensation that comes with it I was marked to do what I'm doing amen I have failed many many times at it but I'm thankful for as brother gy said the endurance you're still here here we are 2024 still going on started this ministry in 1975 and still going on by the grace of God not because of man's favor but because of the favor of the Lord and you have fought your battles because you also have a Ministry whether it's pull pit or not and you have fought your battles to get to where you are don't give up now don't compromise now don't look for loopholes now don't look for a way to get out now stand your ground is anybody here stand your ground so Jesus is talking about uh you better hear my voice I'm The Shepherd of the sheep I'm the Good Shepherd and remember in The Sermon on the Mount I believe it is he says some are going to tell you that the Lord is coming over here and some are going to say he's coming over there go out to meet him he said don't listen to what they say there they're they're here to deceive you you listen for the voice of the Good Shepherd listen to his voice it's his voice pastors and other uh officers of the fivefold ministry they're under underlings they are subservient they must be submitted to the great Shepherd we we like to call a pastor a shepherd because the scripture indicates that that's part of his role but remember he's just serving under the great Shepherd you need to listen for the great Shepherd's voice in the voice of your Shepherd you need to listen to the pastor of pastors see if you can hear his voice in what you're hearing this morning if you can't then I I I I I pray for us both we both need to be remembered this morning then he goes on therefore doth my father verse 17 love me because I laid down my life that I may take it again 10:17 that's right no man taketh it from me so don't you be guilty of saying that Jesus was murdered it would be impossible to murder the Creator he died because he surrendered to death nobody took his life he laid it down as an offering for Jason for an April that's right right brother for a Rebecca for an elas he laid it down as an offering as a sacrifice he said I have power to lay it down and I have power as we learn I have power to take it up again and he did on the third day this commandment have I received of my father verse 19 uh there was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings they're already finding fault with what he's saying and many of them said he hath a devil wow and is mad why hear ye him now let me just stay right there just a moment please this was their discernment these are religious men these aren't just Devils these are religious men men who knew the law men who knew the quotes and this was their discernment not just some Fly by Night opinion they got together they put their thinking caps on and they put their heads together and they came up with this corporate discernment this is a devil here he's here to cause trouble in the temple he's mad which means out of his head with a mental illness why do you even listen to him now they are saying this not on Facebook not on Instagram like this week they're saying that in the temple you're going to find out in a minute they're in the temple saying this and it'd be like you jumping up and interrupting the preacher I don't advise it and and and pulling a service uh distractingly on away from Brother bam tells us that even the gifts shouldn't interrupt the preaching right right he said the spirit of the Prophet is subject unto the prophet if you've got a word from the Lord you can hold it just as good as you can give it and sometimes it really is the best way you'd be surprised how many words I have heard from him that I just took right back to him and I said Lord this is what you showed me for so and so I'm bringing this back to you because I'm not sure how to deliver this so I will lay it at your feet and if I know anything about you I know you know how to get this message across I'm trusting you you've let me have this assignment to pray it through maybe not to deliver it but to pray it through many times intercessors receive assignments for prayer and we're accomplishing more in prayer sometime than we are putting ourselves out there can anybody understand what I'm saying this was their discernment this man has a devil he's out of his head he needs a psychiatrist this was their religious spiritual discernment they couldn't be any further from the truth could they why are you listening to him they said others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil Open the Eyes eyes of the blind so theirs was not the only discernment there were others in the crowd that said wait a minute there's something here I know his words feel a little uh divisive they don't seem like the the Orthodox opinion they seem a little edgy but then he turns and gives sight to the blind so we should at least hear him out and then we read uh sister charity in vers 22 and it was at Jerusalem let's pause there a moment we know where we know where it happened in the city unlike any other city on the face of the Earth the only city that God's word has said is an eternal City and many have tested that by trying to destroy it to the ground in fact the old city is higher than the valleys around it simply because civilization after civilization has has destroy been destroyed there and they just keep building and building and building and building on top on top on top and so many have tried to annihilate it to utterly wipe it out but God has not allowed it because it is a type of the bridal City it's a type of you and I spiritually it sits on Zion's Hill are you listening to me it sits on Zion's seel of which you and I are a type we're a partial fulfillment of God's word to Zion and he tells us prophetically that out of Zion not just a city but a people will come a final word of Deliverance that will break every Yol and every Fetter that stands in its way how many of you want to get under a Word of Deliverance like that you want to be free from everything that binds you impedes you slows you down hinders you in any way at all amen don't let it get cold too cold in here for the folks I sweat regardless so adjust for them if you need to so we know know that it was at Jerusalem when brother brandham is preaching the the crucifixion he talks about uh and I I might not get this just right brother gy or brother Daniel you could help me but he's talking about yes there they crucified there in a city the most holy city they the most religious men so it matters where these things happen so we are told that this sermon took place in the city of Jerusalem in the Feast of the dedication we don't find that when we look at the Old Testament because as I've told you before it happened in the middle period intertestamental period it's called 400 years between and when these Jews decided we're going to take back what is ours and they tore down that Pagan Idol I cannot imagine raising up this Jupiter this Zeus in the Holy Temple if you were here Tuesday night you learned from the scripture that God doesn't like mixture in worship I I mentioned to the church here many things are pagan in the sense that they had an origin in some other Society or civilization one that did not recognize Jehovah as God it doesn't mean particularly that everything like that is evil because as I told you I've been told multiple times that even the neck tie and the suit is from a pagan uh time period did and that we should you know I said oh brother if you really want to push that one I'm ready to believe that Doctrine who wants to put this harness on your neck anyway to present yourself it's just a uh it's not comfortable most of the time for me but we do it it's not that we must refrain from everything that may have its origin somewhere in a society or civilization that didn't honor God as God but we're not to take those things and make them a part of our worship of our religious faith our true faith God doesn't want us mixing things that are used to worship false gods in our worship of the one true Living God the thing you need to know about what we call Hanukkah or the Feast of dedication is they were worshiping the only true Living God whether you call him Jehovah or Yahweh or yah or Y or whatever God right whether you spell it G O D or gyen D because the religious Jews believe that it's not even proper to put to put God on paper that's right because he's too holy that's right and his name should be reverenced and Sanctified and revered whatever you call him you need to know that they were worshiping that one true Living God and they were so angry at what the woke Society of the intertestamental period had accomplished that they said we're not only going to whip you and defeat you on the hills of Judea but we're going to go back to our Temple fight our way back Wade through hell blood whatever comes against us elepants arrows catapults Spears but we're going all the way to the Holy Hill we're going in the temple and we're going to set things back in order and we're going to cleanse the the altar of God because you pagans have offered pigs blood and uncer animal one of the filthiest animals there are according to scripture you've offered his blood on the altar of Jehovah God the one true Living God we're going to scrub it up we're going to get it out we're going to get the stench on of swine out and the armies of swine we're taking down that big statue that you've erected in the Holy place we're going to turn the manora up right we're going to light it again we're going to let the light of the truth Shine from the Holy Hill of Zion again come on and we don't care what you think about it so get out of our way these are champions they're Patriots like many Pat rots raised up in this nation recently to say enough is enough we're done with W Society we're done with all of this tolerance we're done with a dozen genders on we're we're tired of this mess we're going to stand up for what's right many said we're going to cross political lines we're going to offend our family amilies we're going to stand against popular current we're going to be called ignorant Hillbillies but we're tired of this compromise let me tell you something it's like when Jesus a few weeks ago the lord gave me that word how he turned over the temple he turned over the tables in the temple and he did it because the scripture said he was consumed with a zeal of the Lord's House I believe that's some of what the macbes got under a Zeal to see something clean something holy something pure without a compromise and they fought for it and Jesus could have been anywhere this is the point I want you to hear he could have been anywhere he could have been in the gal the Galilee he could have been in Nazareth visiting his family he could have been out on the beach near cesaria or modern natana or Tel or Jaffa on the coast he could have been in the sand he he could have been in the Dead Sea closer to Jericho he could have even branched all the way down into the netive there are many places in Israel that he could have been rightfully so during the Feast of the dedication because it was not a commanded Festival it was not a time that the male Jewish men were were commanded to appear in Jerusalem at the temple but the Bible tells us specifically that this was a particular time that he chose to be there to say that he that it had nothing to do with what we now call Hanukkah in the Feast of dedication is is absolutely ignorance of course it had something to do with it at least he knew there would be somebody there to preach to because many had come to the city to celebrate this cleansing and rededication of the temple he also knew that he was going to present himself as the light of the world and one of the themes of the Feast of dedication was and is light Let it shine let your little light shine we've been lighting the candles this week and singing to Elana he's the light of the world she likes singing and but she really prefers over he's a lot of the world she really prefers This Little Light of Mine I'm going to let it shine it will take on a new meaning to you when you see your little grandbaby or your child eyes light up when you're singing not only is he the light of the world Jesus gave me this light and I'm going to let It Shine Jesus gave me this light and I'm going to let it shine folks that's the reason reason you were born you were born to get the light from him and to reflect it brother bam said the world wants mixers the church is looking for mixers for blenders the modern church is looking for chameleons who will land on a brown Limb and turn brown or a red brick and turn red but God is looking for a people who will stand on the word with a backbone like a solog with a determination of a salmon not to go with the flow like a jellyfish I'm going to stand on the word now to all of these people who say it didn't matter Christmas doesn't matter and it didn't the celebration of it doesn't matter would you also say that the godhead doesn't matter because many people say that right in fact in this modern Church World many have gone as far as to say Doctrine doesn't matter can you imagine saying in church anity truth yeah I feel passion sure I do truth doesn't matter somebody let me to matters I hear them say I read their articles sometime it doesn't matter how many persons you see in the godhead it can be however you see it well that doesn't make much sense to me you don't create the reality of God you may be duplicating a god you may be producing a God who fits your church doctrine but you're not changing the unchangeable god come on he is one am he always was one he will always he's one today he'll always be one amen somebody said you don't believe in the three I actually do I believe in three and more that's right I believe there are more offices and manifestations and administrations of who God is he's not just father Son and Holy Ghost he's a lawyer he's a counselor he's a great physician he's my best friend he's lily of the valley he's bright and Morning Star he's wonderful he's the Mighty God and yes he is the Everlasting father he's all of that and so much more and yet he humbled himself a God so big that planet Earth could not contain him and yet he humbled himself to come in flesh the Flesh of one man my my my and now he's humbled himself to come and live in you and in me somebody ought to squeeze an amen well I've got to hurry I I mean this my notes aren't helping me too much that's good because they they just seemed to confuse me this morning I didn't know how I would get to all of it so let me just do this is under inspiration so it was at Jerusalem it was during the Feast of the dedication and it was now listen anybody living in the Earth at that time would have known that the Feast of dedication took place in winter so this was not recorded for only those who were there right it was recorded for you and I because there are those who say well uh how do I know that Hanukkah wasn't adjusted and the Feast of dedication wasn't adjusted uh until uh close to the winter uh Equinox just like Christmas which would make it as Pagan as Christmas we know that because the [Music] scripture the scripture is silent about what month he was born but the scripture is clear here in John 10 we know that it was the Feast of dedication he was in the temple we know because it tells us he was at Solomon's colonade and we know that it was in the season of winter now I don't know about you but I learned a little bit in high school starting about the ninth grade in literature uh about a setting a setting is important in a book it's important in a play it's important even in a poem and the author if he cares enough to tell you where it took place who was there what it looked like how it went down what happened for this is important stuff so if the Bible recorded that he was there in winter in Jerusalem at the temple for the Feast of dedication it must mean that he did not believe that this was a pagan uh event if you're trying to tell me that you believe that he would have been there to celebrate something Pagan and that the Holy Spirit would have preserved this verse for you and I to know where it was and what season so that we could remember a pagan event I'm so sorry you'll never be able to convince me of that he knew exactly what it was commemorating it was in fact commemorating everything that he was most passionate about light life amen the destruction of evil he came he came to destroy the works of the Dark of the devil didn't the scripture say he came to destroy destroy those Works he came to raise up something higher he came to tear down the error and the LIE oh there's so many principles just do a little search just do a little search what are the Christian principles represented in the in the in the Festival of Hanukkah or the Feast of dedication and and and you will find a list that go all the way through the scripture of the themes that speak to us to our hearts as modern Believers though we are not Jews We are following a book of the Jews a book that was given to them first the Bible doesn't say that Jews are grafted into the Gentile Vine Romans 11 tells us that the Gentiles are the branches that are grafted in that's to the root that's of the Jews it doesn't mean everything modern Jews do today is right or everything that they celebrate or everything that they work with because they've got their own little sex and things out there too doesn't mean that but what it means is the the Hebrew scripture we are grafted in oh you want to make people mad they've mentioned my teeth they've mentioned my ti they've mentioned gravy on my tie which was not the case I think that was to say I was fat what was the other one Zach what was the one you sent teeth someone sent something else they've mentioned everything that could be me what a sad old man I'm I he must be the life of the party what we need to do is get him a Christmas present it'll fix everything I I I'll do what I did Tuesday night I'll refuse it I'll say no no no give that to someone who would appreciate it I don't celebrate Christmas so I'm not I'm I just wouldn't feel right I know brother brandom I know that he received it in in a in a sweet spirit and he should have and I and I get that and most of the time I might would do the same but there are just certain times that you you feel tested right brother Daniel it reminded me when I left here it reminded me of the time I don't know who of you were with us but it reminded me of the time I was in England preaching and a a a woman possessed of a demon Spirit tore up the service she'd come flying over the the the heads of the people it seemed to Lunge for the Altar for me had they told me that she had just tried to stab the pastor recently I I probably would have stood on the other side of the pool pit but nobody told me that we prayed for that little woman and wrestled with that thing until the Lord finally released authority over it I happened to remember that sister yordis was there brother Eric Norman was there uh brother Frank Christensen was there and others and the Lord delivered that woman that night and I appreciated what God did and she praised the Lord she rejoiced she had the most wonderful time she knew more about the message than most folks did too much it's dangerous to know too much without the holy spirit amen and so we just had a a wonderful meeting and as we went to leave that evening she was standing on the doorsteps at the church telling everyone goodbye and she had what they call in England a suite in her mouth it was a piece of hard candy and she was familiar with the statement that brother Bram made when that perfect love you know when that's demonstrated Among Us that it make you want to chew one another's chewing gum what he means is all that yuckiness don't laugh too hard I mean it's kind of funny but but it's kind of true to too because we got so many iys I I don't mean germs I mean these icky things you know that kind of make us uh uh you know repel Us in some way he said by that he didn't tell us to do it they told one time that I had preached that and that I had suggested that perhaps we make it a third ordinance of the church chewing one another's chewing gun I I never said anything like that you don't have to say it for someone to say you said it are you with me but I like the principle because I'd like to be to a place where I could love you in spite of all the ickiness that might be between us when my little granddaughter has a little snot on her no I don't run for a hanky I don't like Snot do you you're looking at me funny like you just deal with snot all the time I don't like it mucus does that sound better for you that are a little mucus that sounds horrible sometime the the scientific term is worse than the nickname many examples uh I don't go grab a handkerchief if I don't have time or a Kleenex I just use my finger many times I've just used my finger I did it for my own children you have too some of you then I go wipe it off wash it off but you don't think to that's so disgusting that I because you I love her amen the few times I changed her diaper I did it with joy even though I think I got one of the first colossal ones I did it with joy because I loved her and did you get it on your hands I did I can't believe you're telling that in the pull pit I am it's more interesting than some things I hear on streams I'll tell you that right now amen you just go wash it off of course you may say oh I don't you know I don't like that I'm not going to wear it all day but you love that one so much this is what he was saying uh when love when that perfect love strikes us we we could be in the trenches together working through one another's sweat one another's blood and we're so in this thing that we don't get dis gusted by that I get it don't you this little woman knew that quote very well and I don't know why I think I know it must have been a test I felt tested and I knew in that moment that I had to pass the test she said brother Shelly would you like to have my sweet and she took it out of her mouth it was like someone paused the movie of my life while I considered this she would say no I I I don't need a site I'm thinking no and if I needed one I would take one out of the wrapper for myself but something said you've got to do it so I just her eyes got about that big and she turned and mumbled off I didn't think you would do it I don't know why the test was necessary I don't even remember if I finished it all but in that moment I did something that I thought was pretty disgusting because I felt tested so if I feel tested I felt a little tested if you think that people get bent out of shape like that what if you were to tell them not only do you have things like that wrong you've got the godhead wrong and if the godhead is wrong in your theology nearly the whole thing is out of cater amen it matters the baptism it matters who you marry come on it matters if you're married to the name or married to the titles it matters and look folks these mcab said this matters to us we can go worship somewhere else but God said this is the hill where we are to worship Our God and this is the place that he has chosen to put his name and you have put Zeus and Jupiter in his place so today we risk our lives and they did and when it came time to turn the manora upright no didn't have nine branches and someone many times people have questioned well why in the world would you use a perverted manora because the god ordained manora has seven branches well first of all it's forbidden it's forbidden for you to make a copy or a duplicate of that manora of seven branches and we have them as Christian Believers we're not living under that kind of of a law but it's forbidden to do that it was to be made only by those who were chosen to make them for the Holy Temple and the the pattern was to never be copied the reason why the the Ancients decided to make one here with these nine was to commemorate these eight days because and someone said that's not recorded in the scripture in fact some people believe it's not even in history well just let me tell you that in the talmud it is recorded 600 years after it happened it may not have happened exactly like this there are many things that we recite and use that may not have happened exactly is there anybody in here that celebrates 4th of July have you ever found that in the Bible no sir did you ever read in the scripture where fireworks are pagan did you know that if you trace the roots of those fireworks you would find that they were also used like that by pagans then what's the difference in the Fourth of July we're celebrating America freedom and the country that we live in and some people have a problem with that then go live somewhere else and we're not making it a religious Festival so we're not mixing that in our worship we do it as families or Community as a as a church family we might have a picnic or something like that but we're not doing that for worship it's when we put worship we combine our worship with these Pagan elements that God says I don't want any part of that and if you don't believe it just go back to Tuesday night's sermon I showed you right in the word he said I don't want any I don't want anything to do with that very clear very very clear now so this uh monora was turned over they put it up it wasn't candles it was oil right and they only found we want to we want to finish off this rededication and reconsecration of the of the temple and we want to light the manora and they could only find one little pot of oil and it would take days some people believe approximately seven to eight days to to make more consecrated oil from the first press because as Jonathan could tell you living in the land at some point the the oil for the temple couldn't be the cooking oil all from the olive but they didn't use the cooking oil in the temple they didn't use the burning oil same Olive but a different press you press the olives once and that first press is the purest oil not much meat in it not much pop in it no chance of pit in it do you understand holy then prayed over consecrated dedicated and only that oil could be used to light the temple they would take those same olives and press them again are you here you listen press them again and use them for other things cooking and then eventually burning in little lamps you'll find one of those out in the in the cabinet there on the right as you go out you'll find an original lamp from the second temple period just this little clay little clay vessel that they would pour oil in and lay a wick in it and light it that's not the same oil that would burn so they had to have a particular kind of of consecrated oil and it would have taken days to get that through and find the priesthood and get all of this in order these men didn't didn't even think they they were just trying to remember all they could remember they weren't priests they were trying to remember everything they could remember about how it ought to be done they were so passionate maybe they weren't even supposed to be doing it but they did it with such a passion that it's recorded and became something to commemorate year after year after year interesting so they take this oil as the talmud records you can read it it's in certain track date I can give you the track date the paragraph and the verse and one little pot somebody said well I Google that and Google says it didn't even happen well folks it's just like this Google will tell you that brother Brandon was a false prophet if you choose to believe that you'll miss the truth if you do a lot of digging on Google you'll find out that we used to have a a place a a time here on the campground uh where we all were forced to wear uh sackcloth and Ashes and we passed them out and we threw them over people's faces and we and uh we called the road uh uh the whole Campground was called ezekiel's wheel and we did this and we did that and we did the other which is some false report that someone made up along the way made a podcast and posted it many many years ago and nothing could be any further from the reality the campground has always been called from the first day Eagle's refuge and I have only said in in reference when we made that loop I said why that reminds me of ezekiel's wheel but someone who passed through here remembers because they were a little child now they're grown and have denied and left the faith and now that's their memory that's their memory so they post it it's out there you can find anything you want to find you can't believe everything you hear there's a couple preachers calling themselves apolog apologists and they are working hard to prove that there's that Christmas has absolutely nothing to do with any Pagan history whatsoever and so people quote them as though they're they're experts and the people there are people there who tell you that Hislop who wrote Two Babylons was an outstanding man and there will be others who tell you he made up history as he went along you can read anything you want or you need the Holy Ghost you can't believe everything you read or hear you need the Holy Ghost you've got to have him I choose to believe because it's easier for me to believe the supernatural than to discount it that's where my faith lies I really believe that they lit the manora I've got a clo 120 oh no I've got a l time they lit that manura with one little pot of oil that wouldn't have even burned through a whole day probably and they believe they teach they said it's recorded in in the written history of the oral law that it burned miraculously for eight nights the one thing that they have maintained about that that particular style of the hukum the manora is we want you to put the ninth candle higher than the others because this represents the shamash the servant and if you read Isaiah 535 you'll find that he is prophetic Ally the suffering servant and it's one of the reasons why the Jews Brother David man missed them missed him in the beginning because they had this mentality from the rabbis that he was going to come as conquering King first but the scriptures are clear he comes first as a suffering servant wasn't he one didn't he suffer didn't he serve didn't he stoop down and wash the disciples feet and then he's coming both are right go tell somebody both are right he is the suffering servant and he is the king of kings the lion of the tribe of Judah he is the reigning Lord hallelujah bless his name they would have missed him and they did and their eyes were blinded and we know the story and we know God's promise and Covenant but they they record that miraculously it burns so we commemorate not just the rededication of the temple but we are commemorating what it represents to us in this world when the governments can come and say you can't gather you might have the The Big C or CV the big virus and you can't gather and worship and only 10 at a time can come and this was just a trial run the random talks about a real squeeze coming come on and all of us most all of us if we live very long we're going to be faced at some point in our life with the decision whether we can stand and some won't even worship with us now because we didn't bow to every mandate what will it be the next time there's got to be some people somewhere who say I'm going to give Caesar everything that is his until he keeps me from giving God what is God's and then I'm going to listen to God oh I Think Jesus knew exactly what he was doing being there in the scripture recording it I think he's actually talking to us about the last day there's so much there's so much here but I have to get to this before I close and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ the Messiah the anointed one tell us do you ever just want to say go ahead and tell me you got anybody in your life that'll just talk to you in riddles and you just want to scream goe head and suck it to me tell me like it is let's don't Tiptoe Through the Tulips they said we want you to tell us plainly and Jesus answered them verse 25 I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me that's right he insulted them properly and he said and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand did I just yell I did my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand so you'll never be able to get them out of mine either he's telling us and then verse 30 read it for me would you again I and my father are I and my father are one and he moves on there's more we we could we could read it all there's more but he moves on because he's finally given them what they were after if you're him tell us and he said I and my father are one and what did the Catholic church do they read that and they said we've got to make three out of one Jesus said two make one in this verse so three must surely make one and the nyine Creed was born the Apostles Creed was born and the trinitarian doctrine was born and the false baptism was born come on yes and all he said was I and my father are not three not four not five not a dozen not half a dozen one this rededication of the temple symbolized restoring God's rightful worship Jesus claims aligns with this by presenting himself as the ultimate revelation of God he's telling them God's with you the father's with you his Unity with the father underscores the enduring presence of God which is celebrated in the Feast of dedication Colossians 1:15 17 let me read this quickly I'll take another 10 15 minutes and we'll go who is the image who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and what and he is before all things and by him well I thought that was the father that said let there be light all things all things he is before all things and by him Jesus Messiah all things consist Hebrews 1 1-3 God who at suy times and in diverse manner spake in time pass under the fathers by the prophets uh hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds through the son he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins by himself purged our sins what did he do he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high he didn't sit down by another person he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high there's so much here we can't get it all but in John 14 he goes back to to refer to take this a little bit further in verse 10 and 11 and he said believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake now again we're preaching to the choir because this is the Revelation that most of you have received please understand that the average Joe Christian doesn't see what you see and that's why they sing the doxology praise God from whom all blessings flow Praise Him All Creatures here below Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host praise father son and and you can do that very quickly by praising Jesus because he said I'm in the father and the father's in me folks that's a reation and that's a big enough Revelation that you ought to be able to whip a bunch of devils with that one alone and when did Jesus choose to identify himself now I want to say this again I've told you this many times as we come to an end here for a moment in the Time of Our Lord the second temple period the rabbis were not teaching the people that Messiah would be God they were teaching them that he would represent God as a mighty General that's why some even initially thought that Titus the general who came to destroy the city might possibly be the Messiah because he came with a Greek I mean a a gentile because they were looking for one who would boast of his strength his military might and power they weren't looking for one who would so humble himself that he would come as a little baby I don't know if you're catching these things in this season or not but the church at large and citizens at large would rather keep him for ever a baby it's a principle that brother brandom outlined for a very clearly he said they've got him back in the manger that statement alone ruffled many feathers as that went out of this place last week they've got him back in the manger they they see him as a little baby somebody said what what are you denying the Incarnation of of God in in oh no no one teaches God in flesh any stronger than we do by this revelation of the message but what we really really Pine over and weep over is the fact that people are more comfortable with a little baby innocent who needs his diaper changed than a than a Jesus who can judge the nations with a rod of iron the scripture said he's commanding every man everywhere to repent now he's not crying there with a little sniffle like a baby he he's he's he's about to Roar from the Holy Hill the lion of the tribe of Judah does anybody see this and when Jesus Jesus again a few more moments here when Jesus was ready to reveal who he really was and answered this probing question he did it teaching from Solomon's colonate porch Portico in the temple at the Feast of dedication there's a reason who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person brother brandom tells us in the message why it had to be shepherd shepherd is plural he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God powerful God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt does anybody believe that here wave your hand if you see that he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that wow you know what God is to me this is one of the most profound statements brother bandham actually calls it one of the greatest Mysteries revealed that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new we take it for granted every one of us in this room who believe that we take that for granted because we hear it 11 dozen different ways every month right we hear it when we listen to brother we hear it when we listen to our pastor we hear when we listen to Brother G we hear it and hear it and hear it and we take it for granted but I don't ever want to lose the value of such a revelation because it places the scripture properly it's in its right place we know who he is you can't worship Him in spirit and in truth if you don't know who he is so brother makes this statement at the end of this quote it's so so simple so profound yet so powerful that the leading theologians of our day miss it he said you know what God is when you see Christ we wouldn't have known that had Jesus not answered the question by saying I and my father are one in the message the unveiling of God let me give you one more maybe two more and close the word manifested or revealed in that Revelation in there then what does that put me oh this is good I nearly nearly shouted when I read this if he is that at shakina or Shak glory and he is isn't he the cavod the heavy presence of God if he is that if Jesus is the personification of the pillar of fire if he is the fleshed out body that the pillar of fire dwells in that's what he said by the way then he is that because he referred to that Pillar of Fire as a manifestation of the shakina that unveiling of God 64 they do you real good to listen to that one again it's powerful it's a good one many of them all of them are good all of them are good many of them do well with this subject but this is one of one of the one of the best of the best if that Pillar of Fire was another dimension or another manifestation of the shika Glory that dwelt in the holy of holies in the Tabernacle and then the temple and now brother brandham said where does that put me if he is that shik Glory if he's that glory in a body of Flesh he said I'm part of it woo where are we looking for the shika Glory well I'll tell you where showing up it's going to show up in the bride it's showing up in the body it is he said I'm part of it amen oh amen that's right the word it self revealed it reveals itself think he said the mysteries of God made known to us in this day by the same Heavenly messenger that was made known to them in them days notice and he's calling the pillar of fire the Heavenly messenger the same Pillar of Fire that sent Moses the same Pillar of Fire that was on Moses that wrote the Bible the same Pillar of Fire that Paul met on his road down to Damascus and now we hear in our day that we are a part of that fire we are a part of that she that shikina well I'll have to skip a lot or I will lose you all but I'll do one more calling Jesus on the scene I I I could go on 3 hours and never hit these notes no no I won't I could feel you 10 I should I just should to see who I ought to just sometimes see who the last man standing would be just preach till the last one's here you may think I'm being prideful but I want you to know they might take a nap every now and again but I know there's some that would never never leave they'd sit right here to the last again they might doze in and out out as they sometimes can remember in flesh oh people have such a struggle with this in flesh he was just a man but in spirit he was God but a man in flesh therefore his body was a human being that was subject to Temptations think about it subject to sickness just read it just the same as ours as he had to put on be a man a human brother brandom tells us in many sermons it's enor it's it's the changing of a mask same God same actor but he's changing scenes and as he changes scenes he changes his mask and then he was God in the spirit watch this one he said I am my father are one my father dwelleth in me we mentioned this on on in one of the last two Services when John baptized him on the River Jordan we see God descending from heaven like a dove and the voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell he God dwelt in Christ and in him was the fullness of the godhead John 1 bodily God expressing himself through Jesus and Jesus was the Vindication of God God the Father listen God the Father this is so good God the father in the form of the Holy Spirit was in a pillar of fire so what was the pillar of fire God the father in the form of Holy Spirit and that no one could touch around him he was holy no sin offering was made just a potential offering now that same Pillar of Fire the fatherhood came down and was made God oh in sunship why do I even need to know this because you are called to be an Express image of what he was came down was made God in sunship he dwelt in a pillar of fire here in the shakina glory here he dwelt in a body which was his son that he created and made in the form of man so that made him the Son of God second Adam the scripture identifies him as the last Adam now now he had to come through the womb of a woman not like Adam a woman had to be involved in this birthing process it was ordained it was God's Will and way Adam didn't come from the womb of a woman but Jesus our Messiah had to come from the womb of a woman because that's what he had to condemn the birth of a human being by a woman that's what had to be judged he said see so he had to come that way now that's God the son the same God and now he through the offering that body without sin he made a human offering I tell you that is so rich we will stop once I read two verses Isaiah 9 6 and 7 this is where we'll pick up Tuesday night for unto us aren't you excited that he came as a I am oh I am meek and Mild he wasn't born in a in a pink sterilized well decorated designed maternity ward in the finest hospital but in the elements Mighty God almighty God Everlasting father unto us a child is born come on musicians please thank you for your patience unto us this is this is Doctrine here it's Doctrine that'll set you free for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called who is the son Jesus Yeshua our Messiah what is his name to be called wonderful counselor what's the next Mighty the Mighty God is Jesus the Mighty God is Jesus the Mighty God is he the Mighty God the listen to what else he is he's not only the son he is the Everlasting father SAR Shalom the prince prin of Peace of the increase of his government in peace there shall be no end this is prophetic upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord man won't have to make this happen The Passion of The Lord of hosts will perform this how many of you know he did it was fulfilled he fulfilled fed the prophecies aren't you glad so it's all right if you pause every now and then to remember that God Almighty crawled into the womb of a virgin Maiden whose name was Miriam we call her in English Mary that little baby didn't have two fathers and the Bible clearly tells tells us that she conceived when she was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost so we know that his conception was by the Holy Ghost which helps us to understand the Father the Holy Ghost and the son Are The Same Spirit different offices he was God 100 100% the prophet told us there are some church advancements out there and some will call him God and some will go as far as to say he was 50% God and 50% man if that were the case he would only be half good to us because we needed both parts yes we needed a man who could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities who could be tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin and we needed a God who could create perfect blood not provided by Mary nor Joseph but provided by the eternal spirit of God oh how precious that blood is come on so if you pause every now and again to remember that beautiful Incarnation how how God became man 100% of each living in one little body it's a powerful and beautiful thing to remember but it can't stand alone and if you can only recognize him as a baby in a manger and not recognize him as the Fulfillment of the suffering servant who was crucified who suffered who shed his blood and when you who know to do good and you do it not the scripture said you're operating in sin or unbelief and once you have come hear me now if you didn't hear anything else hear this once you have come to the knowledge of the truth to continue or to go back to your unbelief the scripture said you trample list the blood does anybody know how holy that blood is there there is everything in it everything is in it and yet if you were to go to Jerusalem and go underneath the Temple Mount and scrape a a a remnant of that blood that dry chemistry could do nothing for you it's the life the blood cell had to Die the blood cell had to break open so that the life that was in the blood cell could fall on your head now tell me that's not precious it's the most valuable commodity in the entire history of all mankind and and and Beyond it's the most valuable thing and then for you to know to do good and do it not once you've come to the knowledge of the truth you're stepping on that precious blood that valuable and costly blood and you trample it and continue on choosing your own way there comes an end there comes a time when as part of him you can go no farther and I need to tell you that we're reaching that that period very very quickly I believe all that the father has given him will come I don't care how many times you've had a false start how many times you've backslid how many times you've changed your mind how many times you've Fallen back into your habits and vices there will come a time if you're a part of him that you'll turn your back on that go that junk for the last time and you'll only be able to do that you will only be able to do that by a re re ation of who he is so if we studied 11 dozen different ways that's all right because it's by that Revelation the brother Ram the greatest Revel Jehovah of the old Jesus of the new the value of that blood the price of redemption paid for you and I and for us to to decide that we're going to we're going to fall into a lifestyle of cheating and lying and uh drinking and sneaking around and lying to our parents and whatever else young people do these days and go back to the vice of the internet and get get swallowed up by all the offerings and and and the and the the Glitters the shiny shinies to do that when you've known the truth is dangerous it's a dangerous game to play and the only hope that you have is knowing that if you were ever in him he can't be complete without you so he's going to as Benjamin sings leads us sometime he's going to tear down what he's going to kick down every he's coming after you what's it say sh every shadow he will light up every Mountain he will climb up coming after you there's not a chain that he won't break there's not an ocean he wouldn't swim though you'd make your bed in hell itself though you took the wings of a dove the morning and and tried to fly away he'd find you amen because he can't be complete without you now why don't you settle it today amen why don't you end this Rat Race today you streaming this service uh along with you sitting here today why don't you end this Rat Race why don't you make up your mind today he's not going to have to chase me anywhere cuz I'm about to turn and run toward him I've spent long time running away from him but today I'm making up my mind that if he loved me that much to go to that great extent suffer the way he did for me the least that I can do is an about face and instead of running from him run to him how many of you believe there are great benefits let's stand by running to him instead of away from him so whether you choose in your devotional life or in your home or family to celebrate the Feast of dedication in Hanukkah is 100% as it always has been totally up to you but it is not up to you what to do with this truth it's not a a cafeteria style Arrangement you can't pick and choose this Revelation is transformative and once it strikes your heart you can never be satisfied in the conf confinements of denominational system again and I have to be honest with you everything loses its shine but him the whiskey the nicotine the immodest dress the lewd living once you come to that place frivolous sexuality without commitment even that loses its Shimmer come on once you've really feasted on the revelation of who he is we're humans and we have these Temptations and we have these things that come against us but the scripture said with every Temptation he will make a way of Escape doesn't he do it he will if you let him if you have to reduce yourself to this simple simple little exercise that brother brandham talked about in his day can you imagine in his day he was talking about the the loudness and immodesty of women in the 50s and 60s he was standing on his head over Lucille Ball he was she was wearing hot pants and and he absolutely couldn't take it and a cigarette in her mouth he absolutely could not take it what would he think about the hour we're living in now come on and he said when I am going down the road a child of God a servant of God a prophet of God and and I see these kind of things these women dress the way they dress he said I I've got this little cross hanging here on my rearview mirror and he said I make sure that instead of gazing another time or taking extra I turn my eyes to the cross it seems to me like a man filled with the Holy Ghost in This Hour with the revelation of the word we have should be able to do that without without a little cross hanging there but if you if you find that that becomes a help to you get you one and if that one that big don't get the job done get you a big one let everybody think what a fanatic you are but make up your mind I'm not taking a second look I'm going to see the beauty of Calvary I'm going to see the beauty in Christ in Christ alone his Beauty his value nothing is more valuable than a real relationship with him God help us today we stand in your house as we do week after week oh Jesus I I repent for the times that I would let this truth become common I I uh I want to be moved by it I want to be led by it I want to be corrected by it I want to be transformed by it I don't want to have only once a week or twice a week an encounter with it I I want to eat it and sleep it and breathe it and drink it lay down with it and get up with it stand with it and sit with it I want to digest it until all of who I I am bows I want you sitting on the throne of my life as we prepare to enter into another year on the Gregorian calendar I I desire today Lord in your presence to tear down every Jupiter every Zeus yes I desire to take a toothbrush if that's what it takes and scrub the altar of my heart until there's nothing defiling and nothing like this world and no gray no compromise on my hands and knees if that's what it takes and I not alone in this house Lord your bride is here today and across the world tuning in and we we say to you oh God we want every Idol torn down yes and we want to cleanse and rededicate because now it's not a house of Cedar that you're looking for but it's a many membered House of Flesh we want you to shine in us and through US Lord as we enter now into a moment of worship let it be that we ascend if the words are common to us that Benjamin chooses to sing may we may we force ourselves to make them uncommon may we make up our mind today I'm going to sing it as though I've never sung it before and I'm going to mean it
