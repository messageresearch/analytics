TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of the New Hope Revival ministries right here in Smith Station Alabama I count it a privilege to be able to come to you today in this video blog and share with you a few of the things that the Lord has placed on my heart during this past season when we look at some of the things that are happening in our nation right now we can't help but be disturbed in fact sometimes we get hindered by the news but I truly believe that if we will keep our eyes focused on the Lord Jesus Christ that he will help us face the uncertainty of today and of tomorrow we've just had a shaking on the east coast in fact even the National Cathedral in Washington DC received some structural damage and as I'm speaking to you right now we've spent the morning in prayer because a hurricane is headed toward the east coast of our nation by the time you watch this video blog the damage that's going to be done will already be done people will be putting their lives back together I trust and pray that we as a nation will do everything that we can to lift up Jesus in this hour not only with our words but with our lives the one thing I've learned about following the Lord is our problems look so big so huge like a mountain before us when we're looking and focusing on our problems but when we learn to look to Jesus and put our hope and trust in the Lord It's amazing how our problems shrink in his presence it's like the words of the old song that we've sung for so many years turn your your eyes on Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this Earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace problems heartaches adverse circumstances and situations just somehow shrink when we put our focus and our attention on the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm encouraging you to do that today what I really want to share with you is my heart for Israel and I know sometimes it's hard to focus on another Nation when we're facing such uncertain times in our own Nation but I truly believe that the Church of Jesus Christ has a very serious responsibility to pray daily for the Peace of Jerusalem to pray for the nation of Israel and the Jewish people who are still many of them scattered all over the world we need to specifically pray that God will gain victory over all all of the enemies of Israel and the nation and the people I love Israel I visited it the first time in 1979 when I was 11 years old and it changed my life I was standing with my dear grandmother who has been with the Lord over 20 years now uh in the in the Museum of the Holocaust we call it yadvashem it was in the old Museum now there's a beautiful beautiful Memorial Museum in Jerusalem uh much more advanced than the one that I was standing in in 1979 I was standing in a room where all the walls were covered with a mural mural of bodies those who had been killed massacred in the Holocaust for an 11-year-old child to stand in a room a surrounded on the Walls by the naked bodies of the Jewish people was a moment that I'll never forget as long as I live but as I was standing there I had a spiritual vision and in that Vision I was caught away into a place it was very similar to what we read about in The Book of Ezekiel in fact I heard the voice of the spirit saying son of man what do you see I heard the whole chapter uh unfolding as I was in in e as Ezekiel it was as though I was Ezekiel in this experience I knew then from that moment on when I heard the spirit of the Lord speaking out of me that there would be a mighty Army raised up I knew that my life was somehow marked to pray for the Jewish people and for Israel it was not until 2002 that I was blessed to visit that Nation again and since 2002 I've been over 20 times by myself with other members of our church and on several occasions I've been able to take my entire family I want you to know that one of the best things that we can do for Israel right now is pray pray for her protection pray for her safety pray for her Prosperity we need to be Watchmen on the walls we need to remember that the LIE of replacement theology has done tremendous damage to the relationship between the church Israel and the Jewish people we need to continue to repent for the lie of replacement Theology and we need to join ourselves in Covenant to pray to believe that God will have his way with his people I want to share with you for just a moment a portion of scripture from Romans chapter 11 verse one said I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I am also an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham and of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his people which he fornew and then it goes on to talk about this time in the life of the prophet Elijah when he also believed that he was the only one that all others had forsaken God he said they have killed your prophets and they have tore down your altars and I am left alone to seek and they seek my life but the answer comes in verse four God said unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the KNE to the image of Baal even so then at this present time the Apostle said also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace I love this chapter I read it often let me skip down a few verses it speaks about the Gentiles I say then have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid but rather through their fall salvation is coming to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy you see we have a responsibility to Israel and to the Jewish people now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness for I speak to you as Gentiles in as much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles if by any means I may provoke you to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them he goes on to talk about the branches that are being broken off he talks about the Wild Olive Branch he talks about the Nations being grafted in he also speaks about the fact that we should should not boast against the root and we know that Israel and the Jewish people represents that root God has a covenant with Israel and he still cares about even the land of Israel I understand that so many of the prophetic promises in the Bible we can apply them to our life but we also need to understand the context of scripture and we need to remember that the greatest portion of the Old Testament was prophetic promises concerning the future of Israel and the Jewish people I was recently reading in Jeremiah chapter 31 and I was reading about the promise of prosperity and what God's going to do specifically it speaks about a time when grapes would be planted again in Samaria and I want you to know that I'm personally aware and perhaps some of you are of Ministries who are standing alongside the Jewish people at this very moment just planting grape vines in The Vineyards and there will be several hundred people in just a few days that will start bringing in the Harvest I'm talking about gentile people who have no agenda who only want to go and love the Jewish people and stand with them and support them and let them know that we understand that we are blessed when we bless Israel remember the scripture said I will bless them who bless you and curse them who curse you you in fact I believe the only hope for the United States of America is to keep ourselves aligned with the nation of Israel I believe our future and our prosperity depends on our attitude toward Israel and the Jewish people so I'm calling you to pray you who love Israel let's get on the wa on the watch let's climb up on the walls again and let's pray not selfish prayers of what we would like to see God do let's pray the scripture read what God has promised in his word and pray that back to him and let him know I'm coming alongside the Jewish people believing that you will keep your word and your promise to them recently the Lord has been calling us back to spend some time in Israel my wife and my four children and I will leave in about a month from now and we'll be spending five weeks in our apartment in Jerusalem we Have No Agenda we just know the Lord is calling us we feel like that perhaps maybe the majority of our time is going to be spent in intercession just walking in Zion just loving the people and identifying ourselves with the promises that God has made in that Nation let me tell you the enemies of Israel are real and their agendas against her Annihilation are real and we as the Church of Jesus Christ we must stand in agreement pray for the Peace of Jerusalem if you want to know what time you're living in you can watch Jerusalem you can compare what you see going on right now in Israel with the scriptures and find exactly where we are in God's calendar in fact we're about to enter the holiest time on the Hebrew calendar the high holy days the Feast of trumpets we're going to to enter into that time of rosashana rashash Shana we often say the Jewish New Year and sakote and simota a very special time where we are reminded of the promises that God has made to Israel the Jewish people and also to the Gentiles to the Nations to those of us who love Israel I I just had to share it I've recently heard people making statements uh something like you know God no longer cares about the land of Israel it's now his people that he cares about and so forth but I want you to know I started searching the scripture and I found numerous scriptures where God says I love even the land even the dirt why does God love the land of Israel the dirt because he made a covenant agreement with that piece of land he gave that to his people and that promise is an eternal promise and though the enemy rages and though we see Division and though we see threats and we don't know exactly what things are going to look like between now and then we know how things are going to turn out in the end because God is faithful a great friend of mine a great man of God who's lived his entire life to preach the gospel in the nations of the world often makes this statement the greatest proof that there is a God is the nation of Israel because we see that God has been so faithful to keep his word to Israel and the Jewish people you know what that tells us it reminds Rems us that if God has been that faithful to his promise to the Jewish people he will be faithful to every promise that he has made to you and I so that's where we are right now we're Standing on the Promises of God we're believing for a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives we want to see the bride of Christ raised up to do what she's been called to do and during this time of of waiting and an interim period believing that God is going to keep his promise to the sons of the Kingdom we can be on the watch and we can pray for Israel and the Jewish people like never before father we thank you right now that you have awakened our hearts to love the Jewish Nation we Have No Agenda except your agenda to love them to serve them to show them our love for you by loving and serving them we pray for the Peace of Jerusalem we pray oh God that you will deal with the enemies of Israel while bringing salvation to both Jew Gentile Arab it doesn't matter Lord you care about souls I ask you to bring Revival in the Muslim nations of this world Lord do what only you can do and we'll give you praise and honor and glory for we know the set time to favor Zion has come amen and amen bashem Adonai Yeshua hamashiach in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for hearing my heart I know it's nothing that you haven't already heard before but let's enter into this very sacred season of high holy days really keeping Israel and Jew the Jewish people in our hearts may the Lord bless you shalom shalom bye-bye [Music] [Music]
