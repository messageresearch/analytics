[0:00] So this last supper was really a
[0:02] prophetic act. It was really a prophecy.
[0:06] He is prophesying that what you have
[0:09] been doing year after year after year
[0:12] following in the feast of the Lord, the
[0:14] feast of Yahweh, you have been doing
[0:17] this dress rehearsal. You've been you've
[0:20] been remembering the lamb that was slain
[0:22] and the blood that went on the doorpost.
[0:25] You've been remembering the bread of
[0:28] haste that you had to make and you
[0:30] weren't allowed to have time for it to
[0:32] to leaven, to rise. You're remembering
[0:36] the bitter herbs. You're remembering all
[0:38] of these elements and you've been doing
[0:40] it year after year after year. But I'm
[0:42] going to add a little something here
[0:44] that's going to give you a prophetic
[0:46] glimpse of what's about to happen in the
[0:48] earth. The spotless lamb is about to
[0:51] take his place.
[0:55] The one that Abraham saw when he lifted
[0:57] up his eyes and looked ahead. He's about
[1:00] to take his place. His body is about to
[1:02] be broken and twisted and hang before
[1:04] all of you.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. And his blood is going to be
[1:08] shed. It's not spilt. It was shed for
[1:13] mankind.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; And so when you eat this bread, you are
[1:18] partaking of the body of the Lord
[1:20] because that's who you are as well. He
[1:22] had a physical body. He has a spiritual
[1:25] mystical body. That's his bride.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; You understand that? It's New Testament.
[1:30] Apostle Paul, first church age
[1:31] messenger, explained to us about the
[1:34] mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37] He wanted them to know there's something
[1:39] about to shift here. And you're not
[1:41] going to stop remembering what I did in
[1:44] the Exodus. But now when you come
[1:46] together and you eat these things,
[1:48] you're going to remember my death.
[1:51] You're going to remember that a price
[1:53] has been paid for you. It was not based
[1:56] on your worthiness.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; It was based on fornowledge
[2:01] &gt;&gt; and predetermined destiny.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; And it means something today. And he
[2:06] said it's going to mean something all
[2:08] the way in
[2:10] &gt;&gt; to the millennial kingdom. Somebody
[2:12] said, "What do you mean communion is
[2:14] going to mean something all the way into
[2:15] the millennial kingdom?" Well, Jesus
[2:17] told us that night. He said, "I'll drink
[2:19] no more
[2:20] of the fruit of the vine
[2:23] &gt;&gt; until I drink it with you
[2:25] &gt;&gt; in the kingdom." Paraphrase in the
[2:27] kingdom.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; So, I tell you, that's going to carry
[2:31] all the way through. I I believe he'll
[2:33] hand you a cup
[2:35] &gt;&gt; in the millennium.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Then he does something that's not a part
[2:39] of the seder at all. He There is a
[2:42] handwashing ritual that takes place. It
[2:44] it's to remind us you can't wash sin
[2:47] away. Just ask Pilate. You You can't
[2:50] wash away blood guiltiness with water
[2:52] and soap.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; But Jesus did a little bit different
[2:55] than what it had been done for a long
[2:57] time. Maybe 4,000 years. Long time. Some
[3:01] people say two, some people say four,
[3:02] but anyway, a long time. And uh he did
[3:06] something a little different. He didn't
[3:07] just put the basin out for their hands
[3:09] to be washed and passed the basin. But
[3:11] the Bible said he took off his outer
[3:12] coat and he and he gerted himself around
[3:14] with a towel and he knelt down and he
[3:17] began to wash the disciples feet. Were
[3:20] their feet dirty? Probably.
[3:23] But they could have washed their own
[3:25] feet. He wasn't washing them out of
[3:27] necessity that day. He was washing them
[3:30] as a prophecy. He began to wash the
[3:33] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[3:35] towel wherewith he was girded. Son of
[3:38] God, word in flesh, stripped his
[3:42] garment, girded himself, washed his
[3:45] disciples feet in view of all the other
[3:48] disciples.
[3:50] Humility was exposed.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; The servantthood nature of the new
[3:57] creation was exposed.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; You've got to understand that if there's
[4:01] a prophecy, there's a fulfillment and
[4:04] there's a message. If there's a sign,
[4:06] there's a voice.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; If God has us today following the
[4:10] example of the Lord Jesus, taking the
[4:13] little elements, washing one another's
[4:15] feet, it's saying something to us that
[4:18] must not be lost.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the reality needs to be this
[4:22] church. There ought not to be a brother,
[4:25] if I'm a brother, not ought not to be
[4:27] one brother in this church that I
[4:30] couldn't wash his feet
[4:32] &gt;&gt; and be glad to do it. Amen.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; But he don't need his feet washed,
[4:39] particularly in the natural. I hope.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; I hope he's not saving it up.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; But by doing that, it's a demonstration.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; It's it's me reminding myself I'm no
[4:53] higher, no more important than any of
[4:57] the brothers around me.
[5:00] We've got to learn to serve one another
[5:02] in all manner, always,
[5:04] &gt;&gt; even when it's inconvenient,
[5:07] &gt;&gt; which would be quite often because we
[5:09] all have busy lives. The very fact that
[5:11] our Lord was willing
[5:15] &gt;&gt; to use these prophetic demonstrations.
[5:18] He was pointing to something greater
[5:21] than just washing feet and eating soda
[5:24] crackers and some juice.
[5:27] He was pointing to what the apostle
[5:30] would say so eloquently here in
[5:32] Philippians. It was part of this
[5:35] condescension.
[5:36] It was part of this submitting himself
[5:39] as a servant to the father's will and as
[5:42] a servant to us.
[5:45] I tell you, he comes when I call.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever found out he
[5:51] comes
[5:52] &gt;&gt; when we call?
[5:54] &gt;&gt; He does.
