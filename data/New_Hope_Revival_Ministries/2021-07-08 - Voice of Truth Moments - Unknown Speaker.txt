Bride of Christ, choose which Voice you listen to in this hour. The devil will lie and distract us, but Jesus promised that once He would leave,  He would send the Comforter, that the ‘Spirit of Truth’ would live inside of us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, to lead and guide us.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he comes not just to reveal the future but he comes to speak in us what the father's saying jesus had said many things to his disciples already but he was finding out that they couldn't really bear them well they were not in the right mentality they were not in the right place in their mind in their in their soul to be able to receive what he had to say and i'll tell you that's a bad place and jesus knew there was a way he knew there was a way that that was going to be changed because he realized that it was easier for them to be in that place as long as he was just with them but he knew that if i can get out of here then he who lives in me can come back and live inside of them and when he comes back to live inside of them they'll find the strength they need to choose what to listen to he comes not just to reveal the future but he comes to speak in us what the father's saying you want to know the father's heart the holy ghost is here to tell you you want to know how the father feels about you and your life the holy ghost is here to talk for me bride of christ today choose which voice you'll listen to in this hour the enemy will tell you you'll never get over what you're going through right now but i'm asking you to make a better choice you don't have to listen to that devil you don't have to listen to his lies there's a voice of truth in you the spirit of truth lives in the believer by the baptism of the holy ghost and he wants to lead you hallelujah god doesn't put his holy ghost in junk he doesn't put it in a trash can he puts it in the life of someone that he saw making the right choice before they were ever born yes i'm not just trying to pip you up i'm trying to tell you the truth having anybody in this house ever ever receive something from the lord that became so invigorating and so stimulating that you no longer saw how high the wall was or how wide the troops were and you just said wow through the lord i can run over whew i can get over the wall i can run through the troop it didn't change how high the wall was didn't change how mighty the troop was it changed how you felt about your walls [Music]
