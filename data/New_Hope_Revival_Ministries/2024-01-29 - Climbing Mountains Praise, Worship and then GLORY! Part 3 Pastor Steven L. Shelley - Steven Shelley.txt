today for the way maker you have a need in your life the Lord knows what it is by the lifting of the hand you just tell him what it is out of across the stream my Lord knows what your need is and he knows how to meet that need you got we have several requests this morning sister Sharon's mom has been moved from the hospital at St Francis to rehab and is doing well she even had a little fall after having hip surgery she was disoriented and had a little bit of a fall but no damage so they're thanking God for that and of course sister Sharon is with her mother today so we like to hold them up to the Lord in prayer I've never felt anything quite like it or or saw such a scenario Benjamin and I went to the hospital rushed to the hospital to get there because sister Sharon's mother wanted us to come and pray for her before surgery and and by the time we got there the the looked like the anesthesiologist and a whole crew of people were waiting in the hall and they just parted to let us go through and pray and and I appreciated that because you don't want to hold up the hospital but brother Ron Spencer I told you last week uh Pastors in Virginia and uh he has been fighting cancer for five years now it's appeared in his eyes he's leaving today on on a a little holiday cruise which is just kind of unbelievable to me that that he's even able to go he's probably not I watched him preaching streamed his preaching last night and he just gets a little disoriented loses his place and has to be helped we really need a miracle for him uh sister Anna Christine needs a touch from the Lord uh with with with her pregnancy uh Trey and Autumn were on their way here this morning and had gotten close and she fell very ill and had to go home we want to remember her to the Lord and they really wanted to be in service with us this morning sister Claudia is sick again and doesn't know what's going on but she needs a touch from the Lord and let's pray for our fellowship weekend next weekend God will move crystalin is at home today with a with an urgent need she's got to have a miracle for for the condition that she's battling with God's able to give it to her but I want to just commend Michael uh you know that's super dad right there he came to church this morning and brought baby twins with him course he knew once he got here they'd have plenty of help but how many people would have used that as an excuse to stay home ah come on come on right that's all I have sing this course as we're ready to [Music] pray none like [Music] you no one else can touch my heart like you do I could search for all eternity long and find there isone like you thank you Jesus there isone like you no one else can touch my heart like you I could search for all eternity and there isone sing

there's none like you oh no else can tou our hearts like you do we can serve for all eternity long and find there's none like you oh God we know there's none like you this morning Lord you've never missed an appointment that you were supposed to be at prise God you've never broken a promise Lord you've never broken your word you've always done everything you said you were going to do Lord and we find in our lives that you don't want to just bless us but but that you want to abundantly bless us and Lord that you're ready to do more than we could ask or even think so this morning we bring our offering of Praise which has brought us into this place of worship today we humbly yet proudly approach you and say oh God will you move once again like you have so many times before will you manifest yourself once again like you have so many times before Lord will you touch every request that was spoken this morning will you do Miracles oh God once again for you haven't changed and that price you paid meditating on your word this week and remembering that as you hung there on that cross you said it was finished finished and we believe that this morning Lord we believe you don't ever have to die again that once was enough Lord you don't ever have to take Stripes again for our healing but that was enough Lord you fulfilled the prophecy of the word word of God and it is finished this morning and we lay hold of the word of God and we say that's mine it's mine this morning I take hold of the word of God and I say thank you Lord for what you've done for me thank you for what you did for me it's mine this morning lord it's your childrens this morning for our family that's unable to be here with their family we bless them in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that the angels that surround us Lord may you send Heavenly hosts to them may they feel the presence of that Supernatural host around them Lord God may they be comforted and encouraged and as we turn our hearts towards the word of God today Lord there's nothing that's going to transform us greater than a revelation of your word so we desire Lord that the work that you started by the spoken word may it be finished in us may it be finished in us today Lord that you can say it's done make us what you want us to be we give ourselves fully and completely to you for your glory and honor so we pray in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord oh we give you praise Lord for you're worthy to be praised hallelujah amen may the Lord bless you as you have your seat today it's wonderful to be in his presence yes sir it's so wonderful to see you in the house of the Lord gathered in his presence with us we have come to worship and to lift up his name amen we want to welcome Warren and Phyllis Perry we're glad that they have come to be in the service with us today brother Ellas was in their home this week I believe and invited them and so we're so glad that you came the Lord bless you may he speak to you while you're here and minister to your needs we're glad to have brother Cade again with us from North Carolina I think that's where he I guess that's where you we're glad that he's here and he's going to he's going to uh continue to worship with us and we invite him I think he's going to the piano we'll invite him and while he's getting ready we want to just receive the tithe and the offering we want to give as giving unto the Lord the Lord is merciful and faithful to us and he is just blessed us when he gave us salvation that's a blessing that is above every other blessing that he would uh give us of his salvation that we did not have to be lost but he didn't leave us in that place he Sanctified us and then he gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and he didn't stop there but he gives us refilling after refilling after refilling because he wants us to keep pressing on because there's so much of him that we don't yet know and he continues to unfold himself I'm thankful for that what does that have to do with with tithe and offering it's part of the Covenant he said he would pour us out a blessing if we would keep Covenant he would pour out a blessing that there wouldn't be room enough to receive and so we honor that Covenant by the giving of our tithe and offering we bless you as the people of God you that are here you that are out over the stream that continue to give so that the message of the Lord Jesus Christ can continue to go to the world that he has given us a Pulpit to we're thankful for that and as you continue to give the work of the Lord continues to go on here on the campground and we are seeing the vision unfold here on this ground that the Lord has given to us that we now own the bank does not own it we own it and we give the Lord praise for that with that being said to you brothers that are here we are not sure in our fellowship meeting next weekend we're not sure who all is coming it appears that our uh our delegation from Indiana may be much much smaller than it normally is but I would like to invite the brothers that are willing and not afraid of heights to to help us on Saturday for a few hours on top of the Tabernacle we've got to get that roof fixed and so any of you brothers that would be willing to help us for a few hours again we're going to be on top of the roof so if you're afraid of heights or if you're unsteady on your feet we don't want you up there because we don't need any accidents we want to pray the angels of the Lord around us that that he will protect us and then we'll be done early enough to be able to get home and get some rest because more than anything we want to come together next weekend when brother Dwayne sister Heather are here we want to come together and have the presence of the Lord Usher in in a powerful way brother ellias brother Steven will you two brothers go to the people today to receive of the tithe and offering may

so glad that you're here very very happy that you're here we don't have a Sunday night service so I preach Sunday morning sermon and Sunday night sermon all at one time so if you have to slip out any of you for some reason we're not going to talk about you when you go we're going to understand that the service has run long what I'm not going to do is cut it short I'm going to obey the Lord that's why we're here and uh let's see what God has for us in verse 12 2 Chronicles CH 5 also the Levites which were the singers all of them of Asaf of himon of yuun with their sons and their Brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and salry and harps stood at the East End Of The Altar and with them an 120 priests sounding with trumpets I don't know if you can hear the noise I can almost hear the noise people say sometime I I'd come more often to your church but it's just too loud well I want you to know it's never as loud as 120 trumpets at one time the God is Not nervous come on there was a lot of noise going on here sues were being played symbols were being played Harps were being played and 120 priests sounding trumpets all at the same time that sounds like church to me I like it let's go on it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers let's not forget the voices were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house come on the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord father thank you for your word it is both an example and instruction to us in this hour Lord let us digest today let your word settle down into the inner recesses of the Inner Man may we be transformed from the inside out oh God teach us the ways of praise the ways of worship and how to stand in the glory of the Lord beholding your power your attribute your character and being changed by what we behold father your word is already anointed but today we ask you to anoint the hearer and to anoint the one that would be here to deliver and we'll give you praise honor and Glory it's in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah that we pray and the Saints said you may be seated on December the 22nd of last year I had an experience with the Lord in the night and in that experience I was told that this was a year 2024 on the Gregorian calendar a year for mountain climbing well I like that it's not always positive what we hear sometimes it's a little bit you know brace yourself but but I think mountain climbing sounds good are you with me and then the voice spoke and said be very sure footed you got to know where you're standing somebody help me you've got to know what you're standing on ever now and again you better check the foundation make sure you're still standing on the word it's not OP pinion that we're going to stand on in this hour come on it's not the doctrines of men but we're going to stand on the whole revelation of Jesus Christ did you know that Genesis to Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ he's revealed in in Genesis just like he is in the book of the Revelation he is there and he's not just a historical god of the book but he's a living reality in the heart of the believer in this hour I ask a question in this experience how will we remain surefooted I need some help how do we do that and I heard five statements being made and in those statements I heard them in the voice of the person who had spoke these things into my life the first voice I heard was a mentor of mine a man that I respected very much who has gone to be with the Lord so many years ago now and he was speaking back something that had been poured into his life and the phrase was whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures I don't know any better advice than that we can't get off on some tangent somewhere we've got to bring the balance amen and and if it's in the book it's true are you with me if it's in the Bible is true but you don't want to build a big Doctrine on an isolated few words you want to run it through the continuity of the Bible come on now you want to run it all the way through as the old preacher said from kiver to kiver that's from cover to cover and when you do that you've got a Doctrine to stand on Amen and and sometimes we make too many assumptions by what we read you don't have to make any assumptions from scripture when he the spirit has come he will lead you and guide you when the spirit of Truth has showed up in your life he will help you to make your way through traditions on he'll help you to wage your way through what granny thought and find your balance in the scripture my precious granny I tell you I love her and I love the stand that she made on the word but I want you to know there were things that were emphasized in that hour that I can't run through the continuity of the scripture so I don't spend my time criticizing those who plowed the way but I have a mandate and you have a mandate in this hour keep your balance in the word in the scriptures then the second thing I heard was a from a great man of God who had one of the most impactful Ministries that this nation and around the world really has ever seen and that was a a healing evangelist I believe more than a healing evangelist but a prophet and uh his name was brother brandham and I heard the voice of brother brandham because his ministry has spoken to me so much through the years I heard his voice very clearly saying whatever you do stay in the mid middle of the of the road stay in the middle of the road that's the highest point if the road is made properly it's higher in the middle and it it it Slants slightly toward the edges so that all the debris Will Will just sort of come floating down when a good rain like we've had lately just washes not I tell you it'll wash a gully right down your driveway won't it the kind of rain that we've been having and then the third voice happened to be a woman that had some influence in my life and and as I've told you before God sent me many years ago and said I will give you a word for her and I will give her a word for you you do believe in Prophecy don't you we are still living in the New Testament right somebody said well that was all in the New Testament you know that was in the early church and I know that's kind of what the Church of Christ likes to emphasize that some of these things ceased with the apostles I'm having a hard time finding that in my Bible and I don't know who ever told you that the New Testament ended but mine didn't end I'm still living in Bible days come on now in fact that promise of the Holy Ghost wasn't just for that generation it's for your children and your children's children come on and I'm some of them children's Children's children's Children's so there's no backing up and uh so her name was Ruth Hein some of you may have heard of sister Ruth I've quoted her many times and uh she she was a missionary and uh she did a tremendous work in the nations of the world and she was probably a prophetess in the sense that that God would speak to her and and he would not only speak on her end he would prepare the way on the other end and two times she flew into Ethiopia and was given an audience by the wonderful working of the Lord with h salasi the Emperor of Ethiopia the second time she was not expected and it would it took a miracle to put things together but God did it supernaturally and uh and because of that he was given proper warning and proper instruction for what was about to take place in the Revolt of Ethiopia if you know anything about the history sister Ruth was also in Jerusalem one day and God began to speak to her heart and told her that he was going to give her an audience in the Palace of catmandu in Nepal and God did exactly that she flew to catmandu not knowing anybody in Nepal she was told what hotel to check in she checked into a fancy hotel and uh and and begin to do a little research and and try to find out for sure who the who the Ministers of the government were and guess what God sent the brother-in-law of the of the emperor of the leader of Nepal sent the brother-in-law through the lobby you and I would maybe go the other way you know a little embarrassed but she didn't do it she walked right up to him stuck out her hand told her who she was and I'm here with the word of the Lord for the emperor come on now so you can say what you want to say it doesn't bother me I know how I know how we stand on the word and so forth and we don't have women pastors and I get all that but I can't help that God knows who to use I can't help that and all I know is god I didn't even know who she was but saw her face I've told you the story many times and God gave me a word for her and her a word for me she's gone she's in the presence of the Lord I have no doubt that I'm going to see her on the other side she was the third voice that I heard in this experience and if you've ever heard her voice you'll never forget it she had one of the most unique voices that I've ever heard in my life and uh she she spoke in this in this experience something that I had actually heard her say and had read in a book uh the first book I ever read that that she wrote and and it's part of how God is helping us to remain surefooted in this area praise and worship is a very important part of keeping our balance of staying in the middle of the road and of keeping the channel of Revelation open between Papa and our hearts do you understand uh so she simply said praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes and then do what stand GL stand in the glory and so maybe next Sunday we'll get to the fourth thing that was spoken and eventually the fifth thing but I want to spend a little time on this in the scripture that we just read Heaven invaded the Earth and when I read 2 Chronicles chapter 5 this account I can easily see the progression from praise to worship and from worship to the glory Cloud so I really believe that this is an example for for us when we come to the house of God when we choose to have time with him at home you don't have to wait until you come here to praise you don't have to wait till you come here to worship come on you can stand in the glory in your living room are you awake you can in fact you should in fact we need to come on so somebody wants to know what do you have to have the Holy Ghost to go in the Rapture I I don't understand why why you'd want to go to Walmart without the Holy Ghost so much less trying to make a Rapture you need everything that God has got for you and you need it yesterday come on so if you're here and you don't know whether or not you've received the baptism of the holy ghost chase it run after him it is not an it come on it's the spirit the eternal spirit of God and we need him in our Liv sister Ruth said as air is the atmosphere of the earth glory is the atmosphere of Heaven it lifts us up above the Earthly into the very presence of God we gave you the definition of Praise can you put that back up for us before we get to where we're starting today praise means to speak well of to compliment to commend to applaud to ex stole I I believe that this is a praising Church doesn't happen automatic we we have to push to get there we have to fight to get there sometime we have to push Darkness back before we can ever really move into those places of Praise but how many of you found out it's worth every effort that you put forward but praise is not worship it's a part of worship but there there are elements of worship that are different than the elements of Praise so when we look at the very meaning of the word worship we get a different definition Al together although very very similar will you put that up worship is to express reverence to have a sense of awe to Bow Low before really to humble yourself the Hebrew word speaks about bowing as a bull rush you are bowing down like a created being to esteem the worth of to give place to or yield so what we find is sometime praise can be rather noisy and praise can be a little bit of an extension of who you are come on you don't have to wait until you feel something to praise you just come with a sacrifice of praise you don't praise him because you feel like it you praise him because you know it's the right thing to do and what we find is when we praise him the anointing starts increasing the higher the praise goes the higher the anointing goes somebody help me and the higher we go in praise the easier it is to start making that transition to Worship in Praise we're thanking him for what he does we're seeking after and giving him thanks for what he accomplishes with his hand with the power of His might but in worship we start focusing not on what he can do but we focus on who he is let me tell you something if he never moved for me again he's still God oh yeah and he's still worthy of Praise if he never saved another Soul or healed another sick body he's still worthy of our praise and so we transition from focusing on what he can do what he does do what he has done and we start seeing him his character his attributes come on who he really is and when we begin to move into a focus change really you know I mean there are similarities in the sense that that sometimes you can still be very demonstrative in your worship I saw that today I saw us as we begin to transition into to way maker that's when I saw the transition and we start singing I worship I'm worshiping and yet we were still at a high place from praise and you would expect things to start getting more quiet and a little more reverent and a little more holy but instead the songwriter said way maker Lal worker so it doesn't change always the volume or the style it changes the focus I worship you you're the way maker now that focus is on him making a way but the emphasis is not on the way that's being made the emphasis on who's doing the way making who's doing the way making it's God Almighty and his worthy to be praised praise can sort of be worked up in the sense that you start climbing in Praise but worship is something you just can't duplicate on your own you can't work yourself up into a worship it's a transition that only God can help you with you see real worship Demands a real relationship I think I should say that again real worship let me say it louder for the sleepers real worship requires a real relationship you can go through the motions of Praise without connection but you can't really move into worship without being connected to the one that you're focusing on so worship is not always evident to The Observer you can't always tell when someone is moving into another place of worship but what we find is that worship is one of the mo most important things that we do in response to the goodness of God are you with me and we know that Satan has been against it from the from the fall his fall his ambition is We Know by the scripture that he was created to participate perhaps even like a praise and worship leader or or a band director or something in heaven we we don't understand the descriptions are that when he was created there were even tabrets and pipes somehow placed in his body I don't understand that but I don't have to understand that but it sounds as though as he moved before the throne that even his body even even his creation the image that God had given him was releasing a sound of praise and worship but it also brought him into Pride hello and pride brought him in ambition that said I'm going to sit above I'm going to put my throne above God's Throne I'm going to exalt myself I'm the beautiful one here come on and so you may not understand this but I'm telling you that people that are gifted in music and in leading of praise and worship have particular vulnerabilities that have to be covered in prayer the enemy is just as much after praise leaders and worship leaders and musicians as he is preachers you hear what I'm saying yes sir and and if you've been around as long as I have around Pentecost you know that there has been a a a a strange amount of perversion right I'm saying this delicately there's been this unusual amount of perversion that runs through talented men and women who lead and praise and worship and play music in the house of God I I got really quiet I think I'll take some water here you you don't need examples because they're even out there in the public church World rather than condemning we ought to cover I mean cover in prayer not sin we don't cover sin but cover in prayer those who place themselves in that position every time they come to lead us I mean the body at large the church at large so that the enemy is not able to pull them out of the reason of their creation the reason why they were born the reason why they were created and so Satan was banished and he was able to persuade a portion of the angels to come with him and we don't read anything about this kind of contention in Heaven until something had first been created to worship God you see there was a time there was nothing to worship him he was still the eternal spirit he was still ABA our father but there was nothing made to worship him but as soon as he began to make something create something to worship him it wasn't long but but contention began to rise in the heavenlies and pride be so no wonder the enemy hates real praise and real worship it reminds him of his defeat it reminds him he didn't reach his goal it reminds him he wasn't successful in building his throne above heaven it reminds him that just Fallen Humanity of Adam's Fallen race like you and I can actually stand where he used to stand when we enter into praise and genuine worship it is as though we have been transported amen Before the Throne of I am I tell you there are moments that you wonder and even can sometimes have a sensation of being pulled has anybody ever experienced that when you enter into praise and worship it's almost as though something that magnet that great magnet of Eternity it's is just pulling us upward hallelujah oh somebody said I don't believe in that I didn't ask anybody what you believed in you don't have to experience God like I experience him but I am not ashamed I am not ashamed to know I feel him I'm not going to base my faith on a feeling I'm not going to change my Doctrine for a feeling but I'm glad there's a God that you can feel I'm glad that you can experience the spirit of almighty God in a personal relationship and not just a corporate one are you with me John chap 4 let's go there I got to hurry John 4: 21 Jesus saith unto her woman believest me believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain which was in Samaria nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when true worshippers shall worship the father would you finish that for me in spirit and trth in spirit and in truth so remember you got to have both sir for true worship to be present come on you can't believe anything you want to believe and enter into true worship it's got to stay in the word God it's got to stay in the absolute of the scripture are you with me I'm sorry to keep asking but I need to know there's coming a day Jesus said when true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him I love this because it reminds me that God is Not Looking for worship God God is looking for worshippers he wants to have a relationship with you it's not just the fruit of your lips he's interested in it's the Bowing of your heart it it's the laying down of your self-will It's Your Surrender that he's after come on it's not just your sacrifice that he's looking for he's looking for your obedience isn't that what the Bible said a and so we can attend what is called a worship service Serv on Sunday we can participate in whatever kind of liturgy or order the church has adopted but that doesn't mean we've ever moved into worship we can have good singing and never really find the place of worship worship is the Bowing of the heart worship is the surrendering of the will it comes as an overflow of adoration and Thanksgiving to the god that we have come to know worship is a Time Of Love he pours out his love on us hallelujah and he gives us an opportunity this is The Wonder of Wonders he gives us an opportunity to pour out our love for him now that's what worship does praise celebrates what God has done worship reflects on who God is the waiting Bride of the song of songs does not say I love him because he has healed me because he has saved me because he delivered me because he set me free because he brought me a long way because he guides me and leads me every day but rather the bride says to the bridegroom you are my beloved you're my leaning post come on you're the one I'm holding on to you're my friend we read in the song of songs that the bride is looking for a friend let me remind you today there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother if you were to interview people in this house and ask them do you have good friends do you have a real good friend that you can confide in and you can trust in and most people would tell us I could count them on my on my one hand and I want to tell you it may not feel like the same thing but if you've got Jesus I mean you've really got him and he's really got you you've got the best friend you could ever have you can tell him everything you want to tell him and it never changes his mind about you you can tell him how rotten you really are sometime he already knows you can tell him how vile your thoughts get sometime he already knows and instead of condemning you he brings a little conviction to your heart and then offers you hope to get out of that mess how many of you thank ful that instead of getting beat upside the head he offers you a way to get out of the problem he offers you a way to come higher the Lord wants us to know him so intimately that we can present him to others and can describe him not from someone else's experience with him but from our own personal experience from having seen him with our eyes of Faith from having heard his voice you believe you can hear God's voice not just through your preacher how many of you believe if the Holy Ghost is living inside of you you ought to be able to discern and hear the voice of God for your own life we must come to that place we must fall in love with him we find that the more we worship Him the more intimately we begin to know him if you really know the Lord there's no room in your life for indifference if you're still tained by indifference you're living too close to the world you need to draw up a little bit closer to him are you with me one of the first things we find uh concerning the difference between praise and worship is when I praise the Lord I will to praise but when I come into the house of the Lord I offer my lips and I will to praise but you do not will to worship you can't really worship until the spirit of worship the anointing for worship comes into the meeting and when it comes upon you then you begin to worship without anybody telling you to it just shifts your focus the ministry of Praise increases the anointing in the service it increases the anointing in the individual but the ministry of worship is what brings the glory praise brings the anointing to worship and and worship brings the anointing to glory in worship we're focusing on the person of God when we begin worshiping him sometimes even images will form in our Mind's Eye in the eye of our spirit in the eye of our heart am I am I bothering your theology you you you you may not be really seeing but uh in the natural but you're catching a glimpse in your spiritual vision has anybody ever had that I believe you probably have and and and sometimes you just sort of begin to see his feet you you you you you you you just can't you know all of a sudden look up and try to try to stare at his face you just feel feel pressed to get his low have you ever been in the presence of the Lord and felt like the floor wasn't low enough you weren't it wasn't shame you were feeling it was awe it was his awesomeness It Was reverential Fear it probably wasn't fear that he was going to crush you but it was fear uh a reverential fear an awe you had touched the awesomeness of God and when you touch the awesomeness of God it actually begins to a it begins to actuate change in your life and it introduces the glory realm to you do you believe there's a spirit realm a glory realm beyond what we are right now and where we are right now I believe it's more real than the one we're living in and the one we're walking in right now I really do in 1 Chronicles chapter 28:2 the Bible said then David the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and for the foot stol of our God maybe you've never heard the temple God's dwelling place we're not looking for a physical Temple we are the temple the New Testament says know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit you're the house that he desires to dwell in but but David desired to be build this house of Cedar unto the Lord God put it in his heart and he particularly calls it a house so that the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord has a place to rest but he specifically calls it the foot stol of our God so it's no wonder that we can get an image of his feet because when we begin to worship him our worship forms a foot stol this what David was praying I believe it it's as though the god of Eternity comes by and props his feet it's all right I may not like your feet you may not like my feet but I want you to know his feet are beautiful I don't mind him propping his feet on me if I could offer a worship that would be pleasing enough in his sight that he could come by this morning and say I'm going to make your worship my my foot stol because listen brother where his feet are he is so I want God to come down on our worship I want him to be brought real into the house when we worship the Lord in that moment I believe you can ask him anything that you have need of and he's ready to meet that need so praise and worship is not a chore it's preparing you it's preparing you for him to come in in and even place his feet up upon your worship he said and had made ready for the building and then in Psalm 1327 here's another one he said we will go into his Tabernacles we will worship at his foot stol are you saying pastor that that every service should have both praise and worship that's exactly what I'm saying we should have some time to praise him for what he has done what he is doing what we know that he will do and we should also have some time to just say Lord just come and prop your feet up on me let me live as long as I can live right here in your presence until your glory I'm getting something now woo until your glory comes Sweeping in and changes me you see that's what's supposed to happen when we sit under the revealed word when the word is being revealed that's him sir that's him he is his word remember John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God and then he goes on to say and the word became flesh so Jesus is the word and when that word begins to go forth It's drawing him into our house it's drawing him into our midst and in that presence we're changed in the glory I want to hear you say glory glory in the [Music] glory in the glory which is the Manifest presence of God it's more than the atmosphere of Heaven it's the Manifest presence of almighty God come on come on no wonder it brings you to reverence are you telling me that you believe that God Almighty would send his presence into a little country church out here on leer Road 379 I do believe that and the reason why I believe that is because I'm here [Music] because you're here come on he he comes because you're his house you brought him here he doesn't just live in this building when we're not here that's Old Testament in New Testament he lives in The Believer that's why we've got to be careful how we treat one another because more than just my personality lives in this house am almighty God by the power of the Holy Spirit has chosen to come to in remember in one place Jesus said I will I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter in another place he said I yes sir I will come to you because that's exactly what the Holy Ghost is the very same presence the very same deity the very same spirit of God that was bed in Jesus Christ it's what was poured out on the day of Pentecost and you've got to have it to complete the new birth yes sir we receive a portion of his Spirit when we repent of our sins but I don't want just a drop in the bucket I don't want just an Earnest I want as brother gley said today to be filled with the Holy Ghost and not only to be filled but to keep presenting myself under the spout for for another refilling and another refilling and another refilling fill us Lord come on slip your hand up with me fill us fill us with who you are fill us with who you are teach us how to praise until the spirit of worship comes and then worship until your glory fills the house I don't need to see a cloud but I don't mind to see a cloud when I was a boy in our little home church it was very common it was out on on uh I started to say Highway 10 that was the first church uh in down country La low Alabama what they used to call Hamilton Road is that what they call it now Highway 27 my granny you know I don't want to bore you with my stories my granny was at that time ordained in the Assemblies of God and she later came to understand that that it wasn't her place to Pastor a church but she pastored one for for many years no offense I'm just telling you her testimony and uh she believed that there should be a church in North Columbus and so she wanted to do it right she was ordained Assembly of God and she wanted to do it right she wanted to be obedient to the denomination that had been good to her she received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1950 4950 over in Columbus at Bellwood which is now Trinity Temple I think and she felt like God was calling her to North Columbus so she went to the board whom we all knew I knew later when I come along and she knew them well and if I called names some of you would know who they were good men good men but not perfect men because there are very few of those I'm preaching about one today right but uh no no sister we we we really appreciate the burden you've got and we know God deals with you and but we don't believe that there is a need for a of God Church in North Columbus and uh let let me give you a little insight North Columbus was not uh well a lot of it was owned by Mr Box and Mr Box is the one who owned boxwood and that was a a slum neighborhood so to speak and he owned the sold the land that Columbus Square Mall used to sit on which I think now is the public library Mogi County library and he owned so much land out in North Columbus and to be honest with you people were living in squalor really substandard housing very poor people uh very you know uneducated people living in North Columbus and my granny said I believe that's where God needs a church she said I believe God needs a church there and uh they said well now now we can't stop you from from building a church but you'll do it on your own and she said oh I get it excuse me Brothers you all thought I was coming here to ask for help she said I wasn't asking for your help I was just asking for your knot of approval she said because the Holy Ghost has already told me that there's to be a church in North Columbus and if the Holy Ghost said it he's the one that'll have to bring it to pass she said I just didn't want to be moving against my elders but she said no problem Brothers I'll let you know when it's done and you can come help me dedicate it well for years all she could find was an old I got picture in my office and and some of you saw it before it burned down an old former hunky Tonk called Mary's place if you ask some of the old-timers in Columbus and Phoenix city did you ever hear of Mary's place oh yes we heard of Mary's place all right it was a shotgun kind of kind of honky tonk and Mary I understand had a leg amputated and Mary I understand sat behind a little desk like a pull pit as you went in the door of her Honky Tonk with a shotgun propped up against the little thing and you paid a little cover charge to get in and if you got Rowdy she held up the shotgun I don't know she ever shot anybody body I never looked that up but I know she shot holes in the ceiling to let people know you're going to be when my granny found that building and reached out to Mr Box about renting that building he wanted to charge her an exorb amount of money and she said I'm sorry Mr Box we won't be able to do that she said I don't know if you've been in there lately but she said the windows are burst out of it and she said there's human blood on the floor and she said the the the the folks who's been living up in the woods there in the cabins have been using it for a bathroom and she said the whole back of the building is full of human waste and she said so there's no way in the world I'd be able to give you that kind of money to rent that that building he said oh Michelle I didn't know it had fallen into that kind of repair I'll half the price well even half the price was way more than it was worth but she had some praying people working with her and they went in and they replaced the windows and they scrubbed the blood off the floor and they patched the bullet holes and they shoveled the human waste into garbage cans and and hauled them off and what they couldn't haul off they buried in the dirt to open a little place on the side of the road where people could come and meet God and they had Church Saturday night Sunday morning and Tuesday night and I lived along I come along about the year the church was started about 1968 and so my my experience in that building was a little bit profound what I saw God do I've told you that the pillar of fire has shown up in that building to such a measure that every eye every person there was interviewed and questioned and not one person said I didn't see it but instead every everybody said I saw it I don't have to see a pillar of fire I don't have to see a cloud to know that the presence of God has come but it would be all right with me there's people in this room right now that have come in contact with the glory Cloud I grew up in that little church filled with the Holy Ghost there at the age of seven I've stood on what granny called the rostrom that's what we call a platform I stood on the rostrom and looked out across that you know it wasn't much slat fuse that pinched you every time you shifted you people would be in constant pain here as long as I preach you'd be hurting the whole service cuz anytime you moved you got pinched and when you heard people holler you didn't know if it was the spirit or the or the bench but I've stood on the rostom of that church and seen not only felt the presence of of God but seen that milky blue presence come on come into that house where the people's faces would blur because the cloud of God's glory had manifested itself in a physical visible way somebody said were there any fruit was there any fruit produced oh yes the got up and walked and the blind could see and the deaf were were hearing and the demon possessed were set free I told you about the sisters who would go into labor in a service and in those in in that period of time it was as though God created a time capsule around our little church because the things that we saw happening in the 70s were things that the Pentecostal Church hadn't seen since the 6s so somehow God created a little time capsule and sisters would go into labor they didn't call the ambulance they took them into the Sunday School room where they had their babies right I can't tell you the times that I've seen women hour later what the church do they kept on praising they were still shouting I was there when when daddies were dancing instead of taking care of Mama husbands dancing across the floor worshiping God while the baby was coming and more than once I saw mam walk out of the back room with a baby in their arms before we' ever got closed in the service and ready to go home that's the kind of move of God it was people didn't want to miss you didn't have to beg people to come to church and people from all the other Pentecostal churches couldn't come on Sunday but I want you to know they could come on Saturday night night and they could come on Tuesday night and I've told you before that there were many Saturday nights that we would be worshiping and praising God and we would hear the the brakes on an 18wheeler lock up on the road on Highway 27 we'd hear it come scrubbing in to the back lot which would have been behind the old building to the side in the behind the old building and here come a big old you know I don't mean that all truck drivers you know have big bellies but here'd come an here'd come a big bellied rough looking fellow in the door pale as a ghost look like he had seen a ghost run to the altar the Saints would get around him and pray until they prayed him through and he would get up and say can I say something they weren't afraid of somebody saying something then they said go ahead brother he said I want you to know that I had no intention of stopping in here I may lose my job because I did but he said I looked as I come down Highway 27 tonight I saw Great Big Balls of Fire about that big around rolling up and down the highway and God got a hold of my heart and I knew that I had to surrender my life to him come on can I tell you one more I've told you many times yes sir uh some of you may know Glen Ray I don't know uh I think he and his wife Margaret may have a church or something in Phoenix City sometimes I hear people talking like maybe they have a church somewhere Glenn Ray was my grandmother's nephew he was raised sort of in a Baptist way nothing wrong with that but he didn't know what to think about all these signs and wonders and Supernatural experiences you know he thought it had to just you know Holy Rollers were looked down on and so he wasn't sure he come one night and we had a pretty ordinary service I mean it was good by today's standards it was really good but but it wasn't you know profound and we're leaving I'm standing on the concrete steps with my grandmother's Gibson guitar case in my hand and Glenn Ray says to my grandmother Aunt Mildred he said I just don't believe in them foreign lights she said you don't Glen Ray just like that he said no ma'am he said I I just don't believe in I just don't believe God has to to do things like that anymore so she said if somebody were to tell you they'd seen one you wouldn't know whether to believe or not no no I'm I don't I I I I don't believe I just can't hardly believe that that's God I heard her look back she cocked her head like that she said you don't believe in the foreign lights that's what people called them I'm sorry it was a pillar of fire but we didn't know what to call it they might have called it you UFOs in some places I don't know you you say you don't believe in the forign Lots again R said no I don't believe and she just looked at me and kind of noded her head and winked and about that time I heard a noise building nobody told us to look but everybody just and coming down the middle of Highway 27 was not one but three big Balls of Fire R floating down the highway and as they got close Glenn Ray sat right down he didn't help himself down he went right down on his tailbone sitting on those steps and drops of perspiration had broke out on his forehead my granny looked at me and laughed she stepped on down the step where Glen Ray was sitting and she said Glen Ray do you believe in them now you know that silly almost to us but it's how God was manifesting himself in that is he not the same God I don't need a fire to believe I don't need to see a cloud to believe but I want the glory to come I want our doubt to be pushed aside I want our lives to be transformed from glory to glory from what we are now to what he wants us to be and if God wants you to see I believe Chad was in the service I don't know how many others were in the service one night at the church in Columbus 8100 Cooper Creek Road that's where Cal calary Assembly of God meets now in that building uh in Columbus I guess they still have church there but when we were there before we moved out here the pillar of fire came one night and hung in the in the church on about the second what would have been about the second row same pews that you're sitting on right now about where brother Shaw or where brother Miller and his wife would be sitting it hung there and every young person who came and stood under that pill of fire received the baptism of the Holy Ghost one right after another I don't know how many saw it but I know the whole church experienced the fruit of the presence of God hanging in the house how many of you were there let me see your hand 1 2 3 4 five six at least seven say it again honey maybe I don't know what year it was brother I can't remember Chad do you remember you know what year this is this is 2024 I I know it's just an old testimony but let me tell the whole world he's still God let me tell you your streamers he's still God we're not asking for signs we we believe the bride is the sign and the Wonder we believe what God is doing in our lives is doing it like signs and wonders to show people the transformation of his glory presence and what happens when we get under that anointing is anybody with me Hallelujah when we worship we pour out where where am I what was I doing I talked to about the foot stols what did I do after that I don't know song or songs I can't get on rabbit Trails Song of Songs chapter 1 verse 2 and 3 I'll close in a little while change from Glory yes but let me go into this let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth that's where the Lord children would normally say yuck let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than Wine this isn't just talking about Solomon and a shulamite woman this is this is an an it's it's I don't want to call it an allegory it's more than that this is a type of the bridegroom the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride it it it's speaking about a real relationship with him we're not talking about physical kisses but I want you to know Heaven has kissed me more than one time we're not talking about the physical sensation of a kiss we're talking about the blessing the the the heaviness of the presence of God come down as I told you last Sunday the old-timers used to say it's like heaven came down and I was caught in the middle of a smack Heaven came down and kissed the Earth and I was in the middle of the smack th this is talking about a relationship we want to fall so much in love with Jesus that when we speak his name we're even careful about how we speak it we want to always say it with love and and and fullness of expression sometimes the greatest worship that you can accomplish is just Whispering the name Jesus if you like to say his Hebrew name you can say Yeshua there's something about just speaking his name reverently just Whispering his name as you bow your heart before him that can be so impactful and be so helpful in a message called what house will you build me brother brandham said and I I want you if you will to to skip to the to the highlighted part for me it's all good he said here we must Worship in the spirit not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts see he said it's got to be next place it's got to be in our hearts we can't rightly present it to the people unless it's in our hearts the spirit has to pack the message itself and I'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real Christian we're talking about having a real relationship with Jesus Christ how many of you know God doesn't have any grandchildren I Can't Get To Heaven on my grandmother's experience or my dad's or my mom's experience I've got to have my own so so praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory let me read about standing in the glory Isaiah 6 1-4 I'll take a few more minutes and close in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord this is in the new notes sitting upon a throne I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne High and lifted up Benjamin will you take these glasses to Mama ask her to wash them I'm sweat till it's run down the my lens and I can't see through them anymore thank you son except I'm going to have to read from my notes because I can't see that now in the year that King uzai died I saw also the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his trained filled the temple I thought it was the bride that had a train I thought the bride had a veil and sometime that Veil runs long down the aisle the bride comes down the aisle in that long train but here Isaiah saw the bridegroom King and his train filled the temple above it stood the sarapes and these sarapes were were the angels of Fire the word sarap speaks about fire thank you that will help temporarily oh yes it is there above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face with with Twain which is two he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly they not only had the ability to fly they had the ability to communicate to one another and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy huh is the Lord of hosts somebody said I don't like this the some of these modern worship zones they just say the same thing over and over again so did the seraphim holy the old old days we sung Glory Glory Hallelujah for an hour holy holy holy woo I can hardly say it without feeling something you're you're connecting to God when you say holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the God of Angel Armies we sing about here sometime SE adoni seot the Lord of hosts the one who commands Angel armies they said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts adonit of the oat the whole earth is full of his glory yes and the post listened the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried can you imagine this P pit just beginning to shake as the voice of worship began to be lifted up in this house and the house was filled with with smoke that blue haze that I've seen so many times in my spiritual life it's like a smoke but has a has a bluish tint grayish bluish tent and it's a manifestation of the sh or the Shaka glory of the Lord and it was so manifested that even the door began to tremble at the voice of Praise of him that cried holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy in a message Revelation chapter 4 number three he said let's see Isaiah the 6th chapter this young Prophet had been leaning on the arms of the Good King and he had brought him all kinds of nice clothes he was a prophet he was going along but one day the king died so he had to shift for himself so he went down to the temple to pray here brother brandom is indicating that Isaiah had been clinging to to the the coattail of his mentor the king he loved the king he lived his life in service to the king but God was about to show Isaiah something that he could have never showed him as long as Uzziah was his Focus you've got to get your eyes off of your past sometime you got to get your eyes off of your boss man sometime to be able to put your eyes on the one who can change you he said he had to shift for himself so we went down to the temple to pray let's go on because he began to get out from amongst where the king's place was good old King was a good holy man but he got out and seen how the people was living so he got down to the temple now listen in that year that King he's quoting in the year that King oziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple he goes on Glory now listen to this what's his train he said there it is Angels beings his train that followed him the trains what comes behind him he is telling us from his Revelation that when Isaiah saw the Lord and his train was behind him and it filled the whole Temple that it was the created beings perhaps it was cherub beams and sarapes maybe even four living creatures showed up and courses of angels and filled the house of the Lord filled the Temple of the Lord the glory f build the temple in such a way that it looked like a a a king with a train coming behind him but it was the it was perhaps the created beings the created worshippers that had come to blend listen that had come to blend their worship with the worship of of he Heavenly Heavenly Creatures coming to blend their worship with Earth dwellers can you imagine a moment that we get caught up into a place of Glory where Heaven comes and living creatures and seraphim and cherubims join in our worship come on and our voices and the sound and the sound of our worship is joined with the worship of the [Music] woo and you think you're going to strut out of here the same if you were to come into that kind of an atmosphere somebody said when's that going to happen it's going to happen when we begin to position ourselves and get ready sir we've got to give the glory a landing Place hello I'm getting ahead of myself let me give you one more place like that in in Ezekiel 10 3-5 now the Cherry beam stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the Cloud filled the inner Court then the glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with a cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's Glory Hallelujah and the sound of the cherubim's Wings Was Heard even to the outer Court as the voice of the almighty God when he speaketh the sound of the Wings and the praise of the Cherub beams thundered in the house of the Lord like it was the Lord Almighty speaking for himself who'd like to be caught up into a worship meeting like that somebody said that's all Old Testament because Jesus is the manifestation of God's glory that is absolutely right but we have no reason to believe believe that we can't Worship in the fullness of his glory the word Glory Appears 402 times in the Bible in 372 excuse me 371 different verses 402 times in 371 verses in the Bible both Old Testament and New Testament the word glory is used to describe the Splendor and Majesty of God's presence it comes from the Hebrew word cabode or cavod which means weighty for the glory to be manifested in a house in a people there must be a place for the glory to dwell he doesn't want to just land he wants to saturate us the word shakina or sh in Hebrew which is used to refer to the glory of God it literally means a Dwelling Place of God so the sh or the shakina really means a a a place where God dwells if we want the glory to appear we have to create a Dwelling Place a temple a tabernacle a house for God to live in that means we can't fill it with all the garbage of the world and the trash of 2024 it means we might need a little Nest netflex time and a little more Bible time if we're wanting to build a place a house for God to dwell in for the glory to come and not only minister to you but Minister through you it changes everything God is looking for a place to put his presence when Abraham brought Isaac to Mount Moriah to sacrifice him he was creating an opportunity for God's glory to be revealed through his obedience when Moses stretched his Rod across the Red Sea he was created an opportunity for God to come and show his glory and salvation when Joshua marched around Jericho for seven days he was creating a place for God's power to fall and His glory to be revealed every one of those places was an act of obedience Abraham was obeying the voice of God Moses was obeying the voice of God Joshua was obeying the voice of God so if we want to create in us a place for the glory to dwell we do it with our obedience yes sir much more than our sacrifice when Solomon built a temple in obedience the glory of God came I read it as we opened the service when Moses built the Tabernacle before that it gave God a Dwelling Place let's look at it quickly Exodus 40 33-35 and he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the Altar and set up the hanging of the Court gate so Moses finished the work then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled filled the Tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the glory Abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle Moses obeyed God and built him a place for the glory to come will you obey God come on Church we're coming to an end will you obey God in your own life are you willing are you willing to be a [Music] place where the cavod the shech of God can sit down in your life and settled down in your life if you become a Dwelling Place For the Glory it's not going to be just praise the Lord anyhow you're going to see praise as a Priestly Ministry anybody who teaches that the priesthood is over has missed the whole purpose of the priesthood the priesthood of the Old Testament was to reveal to you the priesthood of the New Testament and every person in this room that's a Believer if you're washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and you're believing the spirit of God has Sanctified you and washed you clean filled you with the Holy Ghost you are a priest unto the Lord you know everybody likes to look at a Pastor is a priest the problem with that is the pastor is often ministering to the people that's not what a priest did a priest ministered to God your first Duty as a priest in this spiritual priesthood is to minister to God first because if we don't minister to God we have nothing to minister to one another you cannot release what you don't possess you cannot impart what you haven't experienced help me and the devil wants to disqualify you musicians are coming the devil wants to disqualify you he wants to talk you out of of being a candidate yes sir to receive a real encounter with God you need to tell I can't tell him for you you need to tell the Devil he's a liar you need to tell him the token is applied to your life you need to tell him that the Holy Ghost lives in you and that makes you a candidate as a priest unto the Lord to minister to the Lord first and how do we do that in Praise In Worship in adoration in obedience it's true that Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God's glory in the earth Isaiah 40 and verse 5 and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it this scripture is fulfilled in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ he was the glory of the Lord revealed in flesh to flesh but when we receive the Holy Ghost we receive the very same spirit that lived in Jesus Christ as I said a moment ago that's why he said you know the church has got him so chopped up until really modern Doctrine has got God so chopped up into so many pieces they talk more about how he operates separate than they do how he operates together that's why Jesus we have to keep going back and reading the red letters Jesus must have known what the church was going to do to the Bible when he kept telling them over go when you've seen me you've seen the father goes I my father one what I carry the essence of what's inside of me is my father this is the spirit of the father that's in me come on and therefore if you're baptized with the Holy Ghost that same spirit that was in Jesus Christ is in you and that's why we hear him telling us over and over again that all the father was he poured into the son and all that the son was he poured where into his church amen to empower you as priests unto the most high god oh I want to worship him oh I want to worship Him in spirit and in truth and then in closing really honestly really truly 2 Corinthians 3:17 and 18 we'll pick this up Tuesday night I just want to read the verse now the Lord is that Spirit we're in the New Testament now now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of of the Lord is 2 Corinthians 3:17 and where the spirit of the Lord is there is there is freedom is a little different than Liberty Liberty is something that's been paid for Liberty is free Freedom that's been paid for I want you to know our lord Jesus Yeshua the Messiah he paid for our freedom oh yes he gave us Liberty the Liberties that we enjoy as an American citizen wasn't free a price had to be paid for it come on little little patriotic when you begin to think about it well it's the same thing spiritually the freedom that you and I have as New Testament Believers full of the Holy Ghost it's it's not something that Just Came Upon Us free it's something that Jesus had to pay a great price come on and and I want you to know if you walk in Liberty today you're going to have to pay a price to hold on to it because the enemy wants to put you in a box he wants to depress you and deflate you he wants to suck the life out of you come on he wants you shuffling around like a like someone who only knows defeat hello he wants you to look like you've lost your best friend I wonder how we look as we go about the the the town and we do the things we have to do I wonder sometimes if people look at us oh there goes that bound up bunch of people you know they act a little different dress a little different you know behave oh they're just in so much bondage they're just all beat down they have no joy you ought to show them you ought to go out you ought to smile the biggest smile because he who whom the sun sets free is not just free hello he whom the sun sets free is what remember the Bible said You shall know the truth make come on and the truth shall what make you free read it not just set you free make you free there's a transformation that takes place in the Spirit you are reshaped and refashioned and remolded when you come out of bondage woo you've got to learn to live like a free person how many of you know someone who spent years in prison has to make that adjustment once they realize they're free My grandmother used to talk about a stall fed calf a calf that didn't run out and feed uh feed in the field but was fed maybe the mother rejected it or something and and it had to be fed in the stall and so it had spent the early days of his life locked up in a little stall so he could be fed because you know you have to feed him very very often when their mama has rejected them if you don't have another heer to put them with and my granny used to say living on the farm and heard daddy would lock up a a a a calf like that and feed it in the stall and when it come time she said my favorite time was the day that we let set the little calf out and let it let it join the let it join the rest oh she said you ought to see it said all that's ever known is just standing up laying down standing up laying down just a little bit of room to turn around and you have to do that just for the convenience of having it handy every time you needed to feed it all through the day and night in the early days of his life day and night oh but she said at breakfast when Dad would say today I'm going to set the little calf free she said we all would go out to see it and when they slid those Boards out of the way she said you'd think that little calf wouldn't know what to do itd start making its way out you know looking around all of a sudden it'd go out about six feet out of that stall and you've never seen anything like when it discovered what grass felt like she say Throw itself down and roll in the grass then it' jump up and she said it would touch his his Hooves together like that front front Hooves would touch the back Hooves as he would just spring like that all over the yard she said that's how I felt when Jesus Set Me Free I felt like a staff fed cow stall fed cast we had to learn to enjoy our freedom we had to learn to enjoy our Liberty because he whom the sun sets free is free indeed let's stand I won't finish reading the verse Oh I'm so glad I'm free I'm so glad I'm free let me sing A Chorus with you before Benjamin comes to worship with us before we go let me sing I'm free from the fear of tomorrow no no no no no I want to sing the little course I wrote I feel

knees I'd been worshipping and praying a little bit and I began to sing this song it just began to come out of me and my wife she had the door closed to the bathroom and she opened the door she said honey come here just a minute I want to see if you can see this and I walked in there and she said I keep seeing what looks like bubbles she said it's just it's just like little lights or little round orb looking things that just keep floating down here and I said well all I know it's got to be the glory cuz that's what I'm singing about and God just letting you see that and experience it I feel

into those who have given of the gift and themselves for the work of the Lord we'll give you praise and honor and Glory when you prayed this week would you also remember brother Steve and sister Beth Pok son Josh who was in a terrible car accident this week who was burned all down the left side I think it was left side of his body is in the in the Grady hospital they took him there and downtown Atlanta and I was sitting in the parking lot of home Depot last night waiting on my family I wasn't in a shopping mood and was listening to worship and all of a sudden I heard the spirit of the Lord say call them right now I had been wondering what would be a good time to call them because they've been driving back and forth they won't let them stay at night and they've been driving back and forth from here all the way to Atlanta every day and when I called it was a perfect time they were driving home last night and the wonderful presence of the Lord just even as we talked and he's got to have a real Awakening in his life and he's got to see his value is found in Christ so would you ask the Lord you know the times that they've requested prayer for him Lord Jesus you see that little brother Lord you know his life and you know where he stands right now and you know how the enemy tried to take him out toled out the vehicle and it caught on fire and Lord uh you spared his life and I don't believe you did that for him to serve sin I believe you did that for him to serve you so Lord I'm asking you to break through in his life break through God in his life reveal your love for him he's got to see and only you can cause him to see your love for him Lord touch his body and he's going to require us at least one skin graph be with him Lord during this difficult time and be with Brother Steve sister Beth is they're making so much so many miles back and forth may they have safety thank you for the Angels lining the highways to keep them and Lord would you touch sister Sharon's mother today Lord and with special strength 91 years old and you have brought her through something I ask you Lord to give her a a quick recovery and would you touch Sarah today who's given birth to a beautiful baby boy this week and Lord would you just surround her and and Thomas and that little baby with your precious love and draw them draw them Lord to you bless the time of Fellowship they have
