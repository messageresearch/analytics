TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's not just for women to be lovers it's not just for women to lay at the feet of Jesus it's not just for women to want to know his heartbeat it's not just for women to put their head on his chest so they can hear his heartbeat John was our example you sit wherever you want to sit you sit at the back door if you want to you sit on the back row if you want to but John said you don't have to like me you don't have to like it you don't have to like my position I'm not sitting there for you I want to be as close to him as I can John said uh I I know I know they're going to call me I know what they're going to say I know they're going to say I want the attention I know they're going to say I think I'm better than they are but I cannot afford for his heart to beat and me not know what he's beating to woo there is no sensation in this world there is no sensation in this world there is nothing in this life there is no feeling in this life that can compare to when God Almighty by the Holy Ghost comes and makes love over the promise of his word in you come on now you're not going to have power to change your life to set yourself free to deliver yourself to be more like him by looking at how how what reality says about your image but if you look at his image if you'll see the stature of the perfect man in the mirror if you'll see the perfect reflection of the perfect word looking back at you if when you look in the mirror you see Jesus instead of yourself you've got something to to to pull up to you've got something to to to reach a hold of he's the man in the mirror if you're still the man in your mirror you're going to miss this thing how do you become the apple of his eye he's got to be looking at you and he said if they touch you they have touched the apple of my eye let me tell you what God's saying they he's saying they take you apart they're touching the apple of his eye they didn't put you in God's eye he chose what to look at he chose you he'll look at you if he wants to don't matter what anybody else says if he's looking at you and you're the little man in his eye if you're the little reflection in his eye don't matter what anybody else thinks about you when they touch you they're touching him when they're condemning you they're condemning him when they're judging you they're judging [Music] him
