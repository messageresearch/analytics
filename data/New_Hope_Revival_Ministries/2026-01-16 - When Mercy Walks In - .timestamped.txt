[0:00] when all hell had charged you
[0:04] &gt;&gt; AND HAD PLACED YOU AND I BOTH before the
[0:06] courtroom of the king
[0:08] &gt;&gt; rightfully so
[0:10] &gt;&gt; not wrongfully charged rightfully
[0:13] charged guilty of everything the devil
[0:16] said
[0:17] &gt;&gt; you did yeah I did you did yeah I did I
[0:20] did I did and I want you to know in that
[0:24] moment it could have been death
[0:26] &gt;&gt; in that moment it could have been
[0:28] destruction
[0:30] In that moment, it could have been uh
[0:32] leaving you as a pile of dust, but he
[0:35] rendered on your behalf a RIGHTEOUS
[0:37] JUDGMENT. HE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE you
[0:39] were covered by the blood
[0:43] &gt;&gt; of an innocent lamb.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; YOU WEREN'T JUST SAVED. DOES ANYBODY
[0:47] HEAR ME?
[0:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; YOU WEREN'T JUST SAVED.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; You were redeemed.
[0:55] AND BECAUSE OF YOUR REDEMPTION, it
[0:58] covered
[0:59] what you had done
[1:05] &gt;&gt; IT COVERED WHAT YOU WERE DOING
[1:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GOT CALLED UP TO THE court
[1:11] &gt;&gt; and IT COVERED ANYTHING THAT YOU MIGHT
[1:13] EVER do
[1:15] &gt;&gt; as an infraction
[1:17] &gt;&gt; of his righteous instruction.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, REDEMPTION DOESN'T just cover
[1:21] us from the behind. IT COVERS US ALL
[1:25] AROUND.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; It's the present. It's the past. It's
[1:28] the future.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; God has a way of bringing us back TO HIS
[1:33] ORIGINAL THOUGHTS ABOUT US IN THE
[1:36] BEGINNING. HOW CAN HE DO IT? BECAUSE OF
[1:39] GRACE. BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD,
[1:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. HE SAID,
[1:46] "I WANT TO DRESS YOU
[1:50] &gt;&gt; in my righteousness
[1:53] &gt;&gt; because hell is marching hounds of hell
[1:56] and onslaught of darkness,
[1:58] &gt;&gt; WICKED. THAT'S IT.
[2:01] CONSTANTLY, constantly howling,
[2:04] constantly barking, constantly waring
[2:08] against the saints.
[2:10] 10 thousands of ten thousands of demon
[2:13] spirits lid, ripped off, loosed
[2:18] not on
[2:20] the institutional church,
[2:23] &gt;&gt; the bride
[2:25] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THOSE SPIRITS ARE HONED in
[2:30] &gt;&gt; on you.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; They can't change who you are. They
[2:34] can't change your election. They can't
[2:36] change your prefix destiny. They But
[2:38] what they'll do is they will harass you
[2:41] &gt;&gt; until they cause you to let go of the
[2:43] very thing
[2:45] &gt;&gt; that gives you life.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET GO.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET GO.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET GO. ABIDE in
[2:54] the vine.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Don't let go of the vine. THE VINE IS
[2:58] THE LIFE SUPPORT.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; THE VINE IS THE LIFE SOURCE. DON'T LET
[3:02] GO OF THE VINE. NO MATTER WHAT THE ENEMY
[3:05] SAYS. YOU CAN GET MAD AT THE PREACHER,
[3:07] BUT DON'T GET MAD AT THE VINE. DON'T GET
[3:09] MAD AT JESUS. DON'T GET MAD AT THE WORD.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; That's life to us. That's all the enemy
[3:17] can do. He'll lie. He'll bring you to
[3:19] court. He'll make you think you're going
[3:20] to have to face it all on your own.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; You know, then you start thinking of the
[3:25] song. Then mercy walks in.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Sure enough,
[3:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ACCUSER does stand in the
[3:32] courtroom. ACCUSING YOU AND AND OH,
[3:35] WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?
[3:39] &gt;&gt; WHERE IS YOUR JESUS NOW?
[3:43] &gt;&gt; And you're this and you're that and you
[3:45] did and you did and you did that and you
[3:47] did the other and you said that and you
[3:50] said the other. AND THERE YOU STAND
[3:52] DEFENSELESS WITH NO ONE TO PLEAD YOUR
[3:54] CASE. AND THE door swings open
[3:58] &gt;&gt; AND MERCY WALKS IN
[4:02] &gt;&gt; AND PLEADS YOUR CASE AND THE ACCUSER IS
[4:06] SILENCED.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; He has nothing else to say.
