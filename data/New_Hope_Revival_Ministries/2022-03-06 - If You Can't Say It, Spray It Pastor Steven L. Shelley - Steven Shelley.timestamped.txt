[49:47] we use through the years
[49:49] of those things that we know god does
[49:51] that are not coincidences you know
[49:54] sometimes we say it's his signature is
[49:56] on it and
[49:57] and uh sometimes we say it's a kiss of
[50:00] heaven or a divine connection or a god
[50:03] wink that's one that an author wrote
[50:05] about some years ago when god winks and
[50:07] when they came and told me that those
[50:10] boys were jesse's brothers i i felt like
[50:12] god was winking

[54:17] bank bags and bring it back so we have
[54:19] both of them here please
[54:23] i want to take a moment this morning
[54:25] because
[54:26] we're at the one year anniversary of
[54:28] when
[54:30] the lord dealt with us about
[54:32] getting the debt to this property paid
[54:34] off and so i want to just take a couple
[54:36] of moments to give you some information
[54:40] giving god all of the praise because he
[54:43] is the one who has helped us in this
[54:45] endeavor
[54:46] and
[54:48] he has i'm going to say he has put his
[54:50] kiss upon it uh because
[54:54] he has supplied
[54:56] this
[54:57] to be able to get rid of this debt
[55:00] when we started a year ago march the 7th
[55:03] of
[55:04] 2021 the mortgage on this property was
[55:07] standing at four hundred and seventy
[55:09] nine thousand two hundred and seventy
[55:11] nine dollars and thirty seven cents
[55:14] at that time every payment had two
[55:17] thousand forty seven dollars of interest
[55:20] and of course that fluctuates from month
[55:22] to month
[55:23] who wants to give away
[55:25] two thousand dollars to a bank
[55:28] nobody does
[55:30] but it was our mortgage
[55:32] and we had to pay it
[55:35] on tuesday night i gave a number
[55:38] somewhere around 299 000
[55:41] because the interest had just hit
[55:44] the balance on the mortgage
[55:46] as of this uh as of three days ago the
[55:49] balance stood at two hundred and ninety
[55:51] four thousand
[55:53] seven hundred and sixty one dollars and
[55:55] forty cents because another forty five
[55:58] hundred dollar payment had been made on
[56:00] the balance of that loan and so i say
[56:03] god be praised
[56:06] hallelujah
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:14] the total that has been given uh
[56:16] designated as principal offering has
[56:19] been 180
[56:22] 696 dollars and 24 cents
[56:27] 180
[56:31] 696
[56:32] 24
[56:34] and that is the goodness and the grace
[56:36] of god
[56:45] that is your faithfulness to give
[56:48] god has
[56:49] let it touch the hearts of those that
[56:52] are not able to be here on a regular
[56:54] basis to send in money to help us with
[56:58] this and we bless them and we bless you
[57:01] in the name of the lord
[57:03] now i told you that a year ago the
[57:06] interest on each payment was at two
[57:08] thousand forty seven dollars today the
[57:11] interest on the statement is one
[57:13] thousand four hundred and forty dollars
[57:16] so that is nearly six hundred dollars
[57:19] less per month
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:27] now i'm going to give a little bit more
[57:29] information than maybe some of you care
[57:30] about but i want you i want to be
[57:33] forthright with everything that we do
[57:37] because when we started this we stated
[57:40] yeah we stated specifically
[57:43] that
[57:44] the bills would have to be taken care of
[57:47] first
[57:49] we have kept our word that every dollar
[57:53] that you have designated to go to the
[57:55] principal
[57:57] has gone to the principle
[57:59] because
[58:01] that
[58:04] things are the way they are
[58:07] not every month
[58:10] was a full payment plus
[58:13] the
[58:16] more on top i might say
[58:18] let me let me restate this every month
[58:21] the interest has been paid
[58:24] and every dime that was given every
[58:27] penny went to the principle that you
[58:30] asked to go to the principal
[58:33] now the way that this ministry works is
[58:36] when you pay your tithe
[58:38] half of it goes to our pastor that is
[58:41] the way that he makes his living the
[58:44] other half of it is to pay the bills
[58:46] that are in this church
[58:49] i think i'd be safe to say it's near 25
[58:52] 000 a year that we are paying in israel
[58:57] between 23 and 25 000.
[59:03] all right
[59:09] okay
[59:10] and the dollar has gone down we know
[59:12] that
[59:14] and so
[59:15] that
[59:16] has to be taken care of
[59:19] the light bill has to be paid the water
[59:21] bill has to be paid the employees have
[59:23] to be paid all of this stuff is
[59:25] necessary so all of these bills have to
[59:29] be paid so if if the tithe goes down the
[59:33] offering goes down
[59:34] then
[59:35] we have to make sure all of the bills
[59:37] are paid first
[59:39] and then anything
[59:41] extra goes toward this principal payment
[59:44] but again as of this very moment every
[59:48] penny that you have given
[59:51] to and designated as to go on the
[59:54] principle it has gone to the principle
[59:56] let me put that in a little bit
[59:58] different terminology the payment is
[1:00:00] forty five hundred dollars that includes
[1:00:03] the principal and interest every month
[1:00:05] you pay
[1:00:06] 41. all right
[1:00:18] all right so
[1:00:20] that being said
[1:00:22] approximately 29 000
[1:00:27] would be what is needed to pay the
[1:00:29] mortgage on this property per year
[1:00:33] that being said
[1:00:36] that means that somewhere around 155
[1:00:40] 000
[1:00:41] extra
[1:00:43] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:00:45] the forty one hundred dollars is
[1:00:48] expedient that it is paid every month
[1:00:51] some of that is is is interest some of
[1:00:54] that is principle
[1:00:57] what you have given
[1:01:00] above and beyond the payment
[1:01:03] would be approximately a hundred and
[1:01:05] fifty five thousand dollars
[1:01:08] extra that has been given on the
[1:01:11] principle of the mortgage
[1:01:16] you understand that
[1:01:18] this is such a blessing this is such a
[1:01:21] blessing to me personally
[1:01:24] we're still stating that a hundred and
[1:01:26] eighty thousand dollars went to the
[1:01:29] principle of the mortgage
[1:01:33] there were times
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:36] out of that other half
[1:01:39] the interest had to be paid
[1:01:42] because there was a little bit lacking
[1:01:44] but every penny went to the principle
[1:01:47] that you designated i don't want to
[1:01:49] confuse you of what i'm trying to say
[1:01:52] but i want you to understand the payment
[1:01:55] has to be made first
[1:02:00] and so
[1:02:01] 155 000 extra dollars
[1:02:16] we want you to understand
[1:02:26] is that every penny
[1:02:29] given for the principle
[1:02:31] bond to the principle
[1:02:39] in addition to what everyone else has
[1:02:42] given we've not always been able to make
[1:02:44] a whole payment
[1:02:46] extra which would have meant if the if
[1:02:49] the interest is 1400 then the rest of
[1:02:52] that would have been the regular payment
[1:02:53] we've not always been able to do that
[1:02:56] from the church resources right
[1:03:00] okay
[1:03:04] standing here today
[1:03:07] the balance 294
[1:03:09] 761 000
[1:03:13] 294
[1:03:14] 761 dollars and 40 cents
[1:03:17] the interest has come down nearly 600
[1:03:19] dollars per month this is a blessing
[1:03:23] this is wonderful this is the grace of
[1:03:25] god
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] now standing here today i understand
[1:03:42] that there's inflation
[1:03:45] gasoline prices are going up
[1:03:48] grocery prices are going up
[1:03:51] electricity bills are going up i
[1:03:53] understand all of this i'm very aware of
[1:03:56] it
[1:03:57] i see it month by month as i purchase
[1:04:00] materials for my business
[1:04:02] any of you other men that have
[1:04:04] businesses know exactly what is
[1:04:06] happening the prices of everything is
[1:04:08] going up
[1:04:10] but my god is still the provider
[1:04:12] he is still the one who gives me what i
[1:04:15] have
[1:04:20] god is my provider
[1:04:22] not my gutter business
[1:04:25] god is my provider whatever your job is
[1:04:28] that is not your provider god is your
[1:04:31] provider
[1:04:36] i'm saying all of this because i don't
[1:04:38] want you
[1:04:40] to end up not being able to pay your
[1:04:42] light bill
[1:04:44] your electricity your water whatever
[1:04:46] other bills that you have
[1:04:48] and so we continue this endeavor to pay
[1:04:51] off this mortgage
[1:04:53] but we want you to make sure that your
[1:04:56] family is taken care of and we want you
[1:04:59] to give with a cheerful heart to the
[1:05:03] lord we're not dragging it out of you
[1:05:05] we're not coercing you to give we're
[1:05:08] just simply saying
[1:05:10] god is faithful
[1:05:12] always
[1:05:13] faithful
[1:05:14] so austin and stephen i would like for
[1:05:16] both of you brothers to stand at the end
[1:05:18] of these aisles each with a offering bag
[1:05:20] please and i'm going to let the saints
[1:05:23] come
[1:05:24] of course so sorry but i don't want to
[1:05:27] have to get up there and bring the word
[1:05:29] and say it i'm going to say it now
[1:05:32] two mer two miraculous things
[1:05:35] with many miraculous things two come to
[1:05:37] mind
[1:05:38] every bit of that extra money was given
[1:05:41] during covet yeah
[1:05:43] when churches were closing yeah
[1:05:46] i i have people writing me right now
[1:05:49] saying
[1:05:50] the church that i attended for 30 years
[1:05:54] is no more
[1:05:56] our pastor doesn't even do a stream
[1:05:59] we have nothing
[1:06:01] after 30 years
[1:06:03] and i'm not talking about one church i'm
[1:06:05] talking about at least a dozen that i
[1:06:08] know of some of them are hoping to be
[1:06:11] able to open up but they had no money
[1:06:14] they had no reserve they had nothing
[1:06:17] and they're not most of those little
[1:06:19] churches are not sitting on 60 acres
[1:06:21] we're sitting on that god has given us
[1:06:24] something here
[1:06:25] and for those of you who don't know the
[1:06:27] the appraisal is a million dollars on
[1:06:29] this property so god has been very good
[1:06:32] to us and in better times it appraised
[1:06:34] for more than that
[1:06:36] but the the miracle is that when other
[1:06:39] many many places were not able to pay
[1:06:41] the light bill our light bill is from
[1:06:43] anywhere from a thousand dollars to in
[1:06:46] the summer sixteen hundred dollars a
[1:06:48] month for all the light bills that we're
[1:06:50] responsible to pay
[1:06:52] and when uh many other places were not
[1:06:54] able to pay the light bill god was
[1:06:56] letting us pay the light bill and
[1:06:59] this extra money was given
[1:07:01] so that to me is so miraculous and i
[1:07:04] feel so humbled and i know it was god
[1:07:07] and the faithfulness of his people and
[1:07:09] the other thing is not one car wash
[1:07:14] not one yard sale
[1:07:16] not one barbecue dinner plate sold
[1:07:20] and no coercion no
[1:07:22] it's mentioned once a month
[1:07:25] and we report regularly on what has come
[1:07:28] in during the week that is the grace of
[1:07:30] god
[1:07:31] nobody had to buy a broken down radio
[1:07:36] it's his grace
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:41] [Laughter]

[1:13:24] amen let's get our bibles this morning
[1:13:27] we uh
[1:13:29] appreciate brother greeley so much
[1:13:31] he is the one who the lord spoke to
[1:13:34] there were others in the church that god
[1:13:36] was speaking to but god spoke to brother
[1:13:38] greeley so profoundly
[1:13:40] he took the burden
[1:13:42] he took the initiative and he started it
[1:13:44] and so we
[1:13:46] feel like that he deserved to have all
[1:13:48] the time he needed this morning to give
[1:13:50] us the update
[1:13:52] and what an anniversary it is
[1:13:55] hallelujah god has really done some
[1:13:57] amazing things
[1:13:59] and we're so thankful that we have not
[1:14:01] had to come and talk about jerusalem
[1:14:03] because the lord is meeting that need
[1:14:05] and taking care of that because of your
[1:14:07] faithfulness
[1:14:08] he's just a good god
[1:14:10] and i feel a little embarrassed just a
[1:14:12] little bit you know how you feel because
[1:14:14] our business is streamed now all over
[1:14:17] the world
[1:14:18] and so everybody knows us now and what
[1:14:21] we're involved in but it's okay it's all
[1:14:23] right because god is doing a wonderful
[1:14:25] thing
[1:14:26] he's taking care of it and we're so
[1:14:28] thankful for it maybe it will also give
[1:14:31] our brethren around the world the the
[1:14:33] understanding that that every church in
[1:14:35] america is not rich and paid for
[1:14:38] you know sometimes other places get that
[1:14:41] impression and so now they will
[1:14:43] certainly know that we have also had our
[1:14:45] struggles but god has been so so good
[1:14:50] the future looks bright because jesus is
[1:14:52] the light
[1:14:53] he is the light
[1:14:55] i want you to thank god for these
[1:14:57] musicians and everything that they do
[1:14:59] the
[1:15:00] they're just faithful to us
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:04] benjamin
[1:15:06] pulling double duty this morning on the
[1:15:09] on the drums and leading the worship but
[1:15:11] he does a fine job
[1:15:13] we get comments sometimes people write
[1:15:15] in and say i'm a drummer i could never
[1:15:17] lead a service from the drums
[1:15:20] so we thank god giving him the grace and
[1:15:22] the ability to do that when it's
[1:15:24] necessary
[1:15:25] and uh it would be i i so desired that
[1:15:28] he would play the piano and lead worship
[1:15:31] i thought it's a wonderful thing when
[1:15:33] you're able to do that but he would not
[1:15:35] do it he would not stick to lessons but
[1:15:38] from the time he was able to pick up two
[1:15:40] pencils he drummed
[1:15:43] so that kind of came natural we
[1:15:45] appreciate the musicians they come early
[1:15:47] one hour before the service and they
[1:15:50] give everything that god has sown into
[1:15:52] them they give it so faithfully and so
[1:15:54] readily for the service of the lord and
[1:15:56] they've got a great reward coming do you

[1:23:37] archive
[1:23:38] and so we're just thankful that we have
[1:23:41] the technology to be able to do that
[1:23:44] i'm going to bring this morning the last
[1:23:46] message i think in the series on joy
[1:23:51] i might can squeeze a little tuesday
[1:23:52] night out but probably this is going to
[1:23:55] be it
[1:23:56] and i want to call it something it's
[1:23:58] it's it's corny a little bit
[1:24:01] i i'm sorry i apologize in advance
[1:24:06] it's a little bit on the corny side
[1:24:08] thank you sister beverly it's a little
[1:24:09] on the corny side
[1:24:11] but it came to me this way this morning
[1:24:13] i'd worked on it during the week and and
[1:24:16] i didn't know what to call it i just
[1:24:17] gonna call it joy unspeakable
[1:24:20] but i i was sitting at the dining room
[1:24:22] table this morning working on my notes
[1:24:26] and making a copy for those
[1:24:28] amazing girls
[1:24:30] young ladies who have such a job keeping
[1:24:34] up with the scriptures and the quotes
[1:24:35] for the sermon so i'm making a copy for
[1:24:38] them getting it ready pulling it out and
[1:24:40] i don't give them my
[1:24:42] sermon notes i just give them the
[1:24:44] scriptures and the quotes
[1:24:45] and i was doing that and all of a sudden
[1:24:49] um a thought came to my mind
[1:24:52] now i know you don't believe this about
[1:24:54] me
[1:24:54] but i have always had very big teeth i
[1:24:57] guess you've seen that
[1:24:59] very big teeth and so i went through
[1:25:02] school being called a lot of different
[1:25:03] things oh don't did you
[1:25:06] well
[1:25:07] we're family
[1:25:09] i i was called a lot of different names
[1:25:11] beaver was one of them you know because
[1:25:13] i have big front teeth don't feel sorry
[1:25:15] for me i made it
[1:25:19] i made it
[1:25:20] and when i was having dental work done
[1:25:22] some years ago he said you know we could
[1:25:25] change this i said oh no
[1:25:27] god give me big teeth
[1:25:29] let's make them big fix it big i don't i
[1:25:31] don't care
[1:25:32] and and he said we can make them as wide
[1:25:35] as driven snow i said they won't stay
[1:25:37] that way so i'm not going to take that
[1:25:39] i'm not gonna take that white color when
[1:25:41] they were working on them i i just it's
[1:25:44] just i had big teeth my daddy had big
[1:25:46] teeth
[1:25:47] and thank you sister beverly i
[1:25:49] appreciate that so they called me beaver
[1:25:52] and i was a little pudgy
[1:25:56] a little more sensitive about that and
[1:25:58] so i had friends that call me pillsbury
[1:26:00] doughboy
[1:26:05] yeah they were
[1:26:06] friends just think of what they could
[1:26:09] have said
[1:26:10] well i just played along with that
[1:26:13] and they'd come up in the hall and
[1:26:15] and put their finger right there and i
[1:26:17] just i'd give them a little pillsbury
[1:26:19] doughboy laugh
[1:26:21] it is what it is
[1:26:23] but because
[1:26:24] and then some would call me preacher and
[1:26:27] holy roller and all kinds of other
[1:26:29] things too
[1:26:30] but anyway
[1:26:31] uh because of those big teeth
[1:26:35] and and really a rather small mouth for
[1:26:38] quite large teeth i don't mean talking
[1:26:40] i'm a big mouth when i talk i'm talking
[1:26:42] about the physical structure of my mouth
[1:26:45] um i have a tendency to spray
[1:26:52] anybody else have that problem
[1:26:54] you can just see it going well that is a
[1:26:57] very a hard thing to deal with during
[1:27:00] covid
[1:27:03] so you're always trying
[1:27:05] to make sure and when i preach i'm just
[1:27:08] being honest when i preach i'll uh when
[1:27:10] i go home today i'll have little white
[1:27:12] spots on my black
[1:27:14] vest
[1:27:15] my computer will have to be clean my
[1:27:17] notes will have to be wiped off
[1:27:20] the pulpit has to be sanitized
[1:27:22] because i have a tendency to spray when
[1:27:25] i say
[1:27:28] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[1:27:30] everybody's feeling sorry for me i'm i'm
[1:27:32] just being who i am
[1:27:35] so i haven't thought of that in years
[1:27:37] but people used to always say to me
[1:27:40] when i was talking
[1:27:42] say it
[1:27:46] don't spray it
[1:27:50] has anybody ever had that said to you
[1:27:52] only me and brother that brother a few
[1:27:54] of us
[1:27:55] they'd say say it don't spray it
[1:27:58] and i just said i'm doing the best i can
[1:28:00] just wipe it off
[1:28:03] this morning i hadn't thought of that in
[1:28:05] years i've never said that to my wife
[1:28:09] told her what people would say
[1:28:11] i sat down this morning and all of a
[1:28:13] sudden
[1:28:15] i'm thinking well what would i call this
[1:28:17] i'll just call it joy unspeakable and
[1:28:19] full of glory
[1:28:20] and all of a sudden it came to me
[1:28:23] to use that and turn it around and so
[1:28:26] i'm going to call this for the record
[1:28:27] this morning if you can't say it spread
[1:28:30] it
[1:28:34] if you can't say it spread it
[1:28:37] and you won't forget this
[1:28:41] say it with me if you can't say it
[1:28:43] spread it
[1:28:44] it's joy unspeakable
[1:28:48] there is a joy that you can't describe
[1:28:53] there's a joy that you can't explain
[1:28:56] it's not based on our circumstances
[1:28:59] it is the gift of god
[1:29:01] it is the joy of the lord so i want to
[1:29:04] say to you church of the living god
[1:29:06] today if you can't say it
[1:29:08] don't be ashamed to spray it
[1:29:11] now i don't mean spit
[1:29:14] i'm not encouraging anybody to spit when
[1:29:16] they get happy that's not what i'm
[1:29:18] saying at all i'm basically saying let
[1:29:21] it out
[1:29:24] if you can't explain it
[1:29:27] don't try to contain it
[1:29:31] you will explode
[1:29:34] there is a joy that bubbles
[1:29:37] are any of you old enough to have sung
[1:29:40] the little pentecostal song we sang when
[1:29:42] we were young it's bubbling
[1:29:44] it's bubbling it's bubbling in my soul
[1:29:48] they're singing and laughing since jesus
[1:29:51] made me whole some folks don't
[1:29:54] understand it but i can't keep it quiet
[1:29:58] it's bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
[1:30:01] bubbling day and
[1:30:05] it really is like an artesian well at
[1:30:09] times
[1:30:10] my little great-aunt used to sing a song
[1:30:13] that said i can't be still
[1:30:15] my heart would chill
[1:30:18] since i have found the blessed lord and
[1:30:21] he changed my stubborn will
[1:30:24] can anybody relate to that
[1:30:27] there is a joy
[1:30:29] that cannot be told
[1:30:32] it is a joy that cannot always be
[1:30:35] explained
[1:30:37] you can't even sometimes testify and
[1:30:40] make any sense
[1:30:41] because there's no explanation for it it
[1:30:44] seems in the natural no natural reason
[1:30:48] to feel the way you do but on the inside
[1:30:51] of the inside of the inside of the
[1:30:54] inside of the inside there's a little
[1:30:57] squirting spring
[1:31:00] that just keeps bubbling
[1:31:02] and you know what i want to thank god
[1:31:04] for that
[1:31:05] it may not be the most theological
[1:31:07] thought the most amazing theological
[1:31:10] thought that could be expressed today
[1:31:12] but i want to thank god for that little
[1:31:15] spurting of joy that bubbles up in my
[1:31:19] inner man when i'm sitting underneath
[1:31:22] the word of god
[1:31:24] there's something in that word that
[1:31:26] touches me in a place that nothing else
[1:31:30] can touch me
[1:31:32] it finds that sweet spot on the inside
[1:31:36] of my spirit man and it causes something
[1:31:39] to come rushing sometimes it's like a
[1:31:43] bubble sometimes it's like a squirt
[1:31:46] sometimes it's like a geyser but here is
[1:31:49] the point god wants you and i to live in
[1:31:52] this hour with a joy that is unspeakable
[1:31:57] and full of glory
[1:32:00] it is our strategy for overcoming it
[1:32:04] if you can't explain it find a way
[1:32:07] to give it an expression
[1:32:11] joshua i need a water if you'll get one
[1:32:13] for me i have finished mine up here
[1:32:16] and my lips are sticking together
[1:32:20] he's out i think he's doing something
[1:32:21] for me will you get it luke
[1:32:23] thank you so much
[1:32:25] i want us to look at the greek word just
[1:32:27] a moment
[1:32:28] for unspeakable
[1:32:30] you see it says whom having not seen
[1:32:34] ye love
[1:32:36] in whom though now ye see him not yet
[1:32:40] believing
[1:32:42] he rejoice
[1:32:44] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:32:48] now we can't mourn until the bridegroom
[1:32:51] comes
[1:32:53] we weep
[1:32:55] because we long to be with him
[1:32:57] but we're not left here in this earth to
[1:33:00] mourn and groan and carry on all the
[1:33:04] time because we can't see him in
[1:33:06] physical form thank you so much
[1:33:09] and i appreciate you opening it so it's
[1:33:11] ready for me
[1:33:16] he's just fulfilled the scripture
[1:33:20] may god give him his blessing
[1:33:23] now that word unspeakable
[1:33:27] is a
[1:33:28] it's an unusual greek word
[1:33:30] and
[1:33:31] there are places
[1:33:33] in the bible
[1:33:35] that are translated in english
[1:33:37] unspeakable
[1:33:39] but they do not use the same greek word
[1:33:43] this particular
[1:33:45] well let me give you an example
[1:33:47] in second corinthians chapter 9
[1:33:50] and verse 15 just stay with me a moment
[1:33:54] there is one little verse of scripture
[1:33:56] there that says thanks be to god
[1:34:00] our thanks be unto god
[1:34:03] for his unspeakable
[1:34:06] gift
[1:34:07] that is a beautiful greek word
[1:34:09] and it means almost the same thing
[1:34:12] it means to to commemorate
[1:34:16] when words fail
[1:34:19] but in the scripture first peter 1 8
[1:34:23] when it says joy unspeakable and full of
[1:34:26] glory the greek word is anakilitos
[1:34:30] and it means inexpressible
[1:34:35] indescribable
[1:34:38] to describe
[1:34:40] to commemorate
[1:34:42] words
[1:34:43] would fail
[1:34:46] this is a beautiful greek word
[1:34:49] which basically means unable to find
[1:34:52] expression
[1:34:54] in words
[1:34:56] it's not that it can't be expressed
[1:34:58] it just can't be expressed
[1:35:01] in words
[1:35:05] are you with me
[1:35:07] you ever been in a service where they
[1:35:08] said let's let's have a wave offering
[1:35:12] oh you don't have to tell them when
[1:35:14] we're in africa to wave have a wave
[1:35:16] offering
[1:35:17] because there's a joy that gets in them
[1:35:20] and there's a joy that gets on them and
[1:35:23] you don't have to tell them to take
[1:35:24] their handkerchiefs out or their scarves
[1:35:27] out when they begin to praise the lord
[1:35:30] they just automatically begin to give
[1:35:32] him a wave offering you know what i say
[1:35:34] that is i say when god begins to bless
[1:35:37] them that is joy unspeakable
[1:35:40] it can't be testified it can't be
[1:35:43] explained with mortal lips but it has
[1:35:46] found an expression
[1:35:50] now i know that there are we have had a
[1:35:52] variety of expressions around here
[1:35:54] through the years
[1:35:58] we have had people to get excited and
[1:36:01] get under the anointing and get under
[1:36:03] this uh the flow of god's glory and you
[1:36:07] might hear somebody say oh
[1:36:12] there's no words to define whoa
[1:36:18] it's a joy bubble
[1:36:20] come on now
[1:36:21] help me just a minute
[1:36:23] it's just a joy bubble
[1:36:25] it's letting out something that god is
[1:36:28] stirring on the inside of you
[1:36:31] that you just don't have language for
[1:36:34] and then when we were having so many
[1:36:37] visitors
[1:36:38] from among the charismatic circles we
[1:36:40] began to hear some other expressions as
[1:36:43] people would praise the lord and
[1:36:44] somebody would say show
[1:36:48] or somebody might say show
[1:36:51] and we might have a tendency if that's
[1:36:53] not our thing
[1:36:57] we may have a tendency to be a little
[1:36:58] critical of that
[1:37:00] well what does that mean it doesn't mean
[1:37:02] anything
[1:37:03] not in the natural
[1:37:05] you can't you cannot interpret that with
[1:37:09] english
[1:37:11] it's just a joy bubble
[1:37:13] it's just a gushing of joy unspeakable
[1:37:17] and full of glory it is your body your
[1:37:20] your spirit man and with your physical
[1:37:23] body reacting to what god is letting you
[1:37:27] experience on the inside of the inside
[1:37:30] don't you despise
[1:37:32] that don't you criticize that
[1:37:36] because if you don't find a way to let
[1:37:39] joy and praise express itself you will
[1:37:44] either explode
[1:37:48] you will dry up
[1:37:52] and blow away
[1:37:54] now i'm going to tell you something if
[1:37:56] if somebody told me to let out a little
[1:37:58] show or a little bit of whoa would help
[1:38:01] me from drying up
[1:38:04] i'd be finding me one
[1:38:07] how many of you remember jill marie
[1:38:09] evans
[1:38:10] anybody remember when aaron evans was
[1:38:12] here visiting us
[1:38:14] black brother came here during a new
[1:38:17] year's meeting
[1:38:18] it was part of stream's international
[1:38:21] great man wonderful friend
[1:38:23] in prison
[1:38:25] for for for
[1:38:27] taking a life
[1:38:30] he was in terrible shape
[1:38:32] a ruffian a hoodlum
[1:38:35] a murderer if you don't mind me saying
[1:38:37] something so plain
[1:38:39] and jesus showed up
[1:38:42] in his prison cell
[1:38:44] and he said i'm not a black man
[1:38:48] and i'm not a white man
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:51] i'm the right man
[1:38:54] my name is jesus and you need to serve
[1:38:56] me
[1:38:57] and he said right there in that cell he
[1:39:00] gave god everything
[1:39:03] well we had the opportunity to travel
[1:39:05] with him some and we were doing a
[1:39:07] conference in
[1:39:08] in the tri-city washington
[1:39:11] and god was really blessing in those
[1:39:13] meetings and jill marie she could be so
[1:39:16] calm
[1:39:19] she could be so calm
[1:39:21] and then all of a sudden she would get
[1:39:23] one of those joy bubbles and she didn't
[1:39:26] say show
[1:39:31] hers could be a little more dangerous
[1:39:32] than that
[1:39:34] she'd say oh
[1:39:44] you might be preaching and she'd say how
[1:39:46] you ever heard that around here i have
[1:39:49] what does that mean well in the bible it
[1:39:52] says ho everyone that thirsteth
[1:39:55] it's a call to get somebody's attention
[1:39:58] but how many of you know in the urban
[1:40:00] dictionary
[1:40:06] how ho doesn't mean
[1:40:09] get everybody's attention
[1:40:11] so i happened to be there one night when
[1:40:13] she kind of got a rebuke
[1:40:16] for using that expression
[1:40:18] and i'm the only one that could step to
[1:40:20] her defense and remind her that her word
[1:40:24] was in the king james version of the
[1:40:26] bible
[1:40:27] i don't understand
[1:40:29] i can uh why can't you say hallelujah
[1:40:33] why can't you just say praise the lord
[1:40:36] why can't you just say amen
[1:40:39] people sometimes don't understand those
[1:40:42] expressions that we might make
[1:40:45] i've been in service one time when
[1:40:47] somebody went
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:54] you thought a bunch of comanches had
[1:40:55] come through the place
[1:40:57] but i don't have a criticism
[1:41:02] because david found a joy
[1:41:06] that was so real
[1:41:08] that he began to take off his outer
[1:41:11] garments
[1:41:13] and dance before the lord in his inner
[1:41:17] tunic which we might call his underwear
[1:41:20] [Applause]
[1:41:22] i wouldn't encourage you to dance before
[1:41:25] the lord in here
[1:41:27] in your underwear
[1:41:29] but i'm not going to criticize somebody
[1:41:32] who has tasted a water from a well that
[1:41:36] they don't know how to contain
[1:41:39] i don't want to contain it
[1:41:42] i don't want to cap it up
[1:41:46] i don't want to silence my praise
[1:41:49] come on now
[1:41:52] i've got to let it out i got to praise
[1:41:55] god and praise god to praise and i got
[1:41:57] to let it out
[1:41:59] why wouldn't you want to praise him
[1:42:05] why wouldn't you want to do what the
[1:42:07] prophet said
[1:42:08] get in the spirit
[1:42:10] of what you're doing
[1:42:15] come on
[1:42:16] i mentioned the other day the preachers
[1:42:19] who can't get excited
[1:42:22] unless they're preaching
[1:42:29] something's a little out of balance
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:33] if praise and worship
[1:42:35] it's not something that speaks to you as
[1:42:37] a minister
[1:42:39] and you only get happy
[1:42:41] when your gift is being used
[1:42:44] something's a little out
[1:42:46] i'm not i'm not
[1:42:47] i'm not trying to judge
[1:42:49] but something's a little bit out of
[1:42:51] whack
[1:42:52] i don't care who's preaching
[1:42:54] i i don't care who's preaching i can't
[1:42:56] help myself
[1:42:58] when that word begins to go forth and
[1:43:01] dots begin to connect and piece pieces
[1:43:05] pieces of the puzzle start falling into
[1:43:08] place i cannot help myself
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:15] can't do it
[1:43:17] i find out when we have preachers here i
[1:43:20] have a hard time
[1:43:22] not distracting because i like to stand
[1:43:26] i do i like to get up sometime and let
[1:43:28] that man know i'm behind him and i
[1:43:31] appreciate but i'm not doing it for you
[1:43:33] to see me
[1:43:34] i'm not even necessarily doing it for
[1:43:37] him to see me
[1:43:38] although i believe it's a good idea to
[1:43:41] encourage the servant of the lord but i
[1:43:43] just can't help myself sometime
[1:43:46] there's something about truth i
[1:43:48] love
[1:43:49] truth
[1:43:50] jesus is truth
[1:43:53] truth is a person and i love
[1:43:57] truth
[1:43:58] i don't just carry on like this when
[1:44:00] you're with me
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:04] i was listening to the word yesterday
[1:44:07] sitting in my chair my house empty
[1:44:09] nobody there but me and i tell you what
[1:44:12] i got so happy listening to the
[1:44:14] preaching of the word that i jumped up
[1:44:17] out of my chair and i spun around in my
[1:44:20] living room and i said god i want to
[1:44:23] thank you that there's something in me
[1:44:26] lord jesus
[1:44:28] i want to thank you that through all the
[1:44:30] trials of life i have not lost
[1:44:36] that place in me where you can put your
[1:44:39] finger
[1:44:40] and bring me to life
[1:44:42] it's like resurrection life
[1:44:45] surging through us
[1:44:47] i think you're preaching this morning
[1:44:48] about getting out of order i am no such
[1:44:50] of a thing
[1:44:51] i'm preaching about a joy that you can't
[1:44:54] theologically explain you can't always
[1:44:57] put the words together to tell somebody
[1:45:00] what it is all you know how to do is
[1:45:02] somehow let it out
[1:45:07] and we preached a series here
[1:45:09] some many years ago now on nine davidic
[1:45:13] forms of praise
[1:45:16] and god is honored by all of it
[1:45:19] any mind with me
[1:45:20] he receives glory
[1:45:22] from all of those different expressions
[1:45:25] of praise
[1:45:26] just don't find your favorite and get
[1:45:28] stuck there
[1:45:31] because god is a god that likes praise
[1:45:34] anybody with me isn't that what he said
[1:45:37] he said i'm a jealous god
[1:45:40] he doesn't want you to be more excited
[1:45:43] over football
[1:45:46] or your favorite singer at a concert
[1:45:48] somewhere
[1:45:49] or your favorite sport whatever it is
[1:45:52] you travel around the world in soccer
[1:45:54] which they call football outside of this
[1:45:56] country
[1:45:57] you can be walking down the street in
[1:45:59] london not even knowing that there's a
[1:46:01] game going on and you can begin to hear
[1:46:03] a roar coming out of those pubs
[1:46:07] as those men don't seem to be able to
[1:46:09] help themselves because something that
[1:46:11] they care about something that they're
[1:46:13] passionate about is on and they're glued
[1:46:18] and when the other team scores
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:23] like purim
[1:46:27] like purim
[1:46:28] when we mention haman
[1:46:33] when we mention mordecai or esther yay
[1:46:39] when something that you're passionate
[1:46:41] about is mentioned when something you're
[1:46:43] in love with is being edified
[1:46:46] or magnified or mentioned there should
[1:46:49] be a connection
[1:46:50] i'll tell you now i'm not saying
[1:46:52] anything deep right now but i'm feeling
[1:46:54] something as i talk
[1:46:56] there should be something that quickens
[1:46:58] that comes alive
[1:47:00] hallelujah and don't you be like they
[1:47:02] used to tell me i'm not emotional you
[1:47:05] can't expect me to jump you can't expect
[1:47:08] me to shout you can't expect me to say
[1:47:10] amen i'm not an emotional person
[1:47:13] then you're dead
[1:47:16] you're not even alive
[1:47:18] you're worse than a zombie
[1:47:20] say amen because we are all emotional
[1:47:24] creatures
[1:47:25] you just let somebody take your parking
[1:47:27] place
[1:47:30] and you see how emotional you really are
[1:47:37] so joshua wanted to
[1:47:39] run
[1:47:40] on friday
[1:47:42] to play uh nine holes of golf
[1:47:45] and he said dad you want to go with me
[1:47:47] and ride in the cart
[1:47:49] and i do that on occasion
[1:47:51] i've never hit a golf ball except a
[1:47:53] putt-putt ball
[1:47:56] i wouldn't know what to do i'd be
[1:47:57] embarrassed i think now to try
[1:47:59] because i see how serious they get
[1:48:02] and all i know is you've got to have
[1:48:04] some some loose hips to be able to play
[1:48:07] golf evidently
[1:48:11] because as i watched out over that
[1:48:14] it wasn't just joshua wiggling his you
[1:48:16] know
[1:48:21] i'm wondering if you got to hold your
[1:48:23] mouth a certain way
[1:48:26] there seems to be so much involved in it
[1:48:29] and then you take a few
[1:48:31] swings and miss the ball on purpose
[1:48:34] to practice
[1:48:39] there's a lot involved in that
[1:48:42] and so i was riding out there with him
[1:48:45] somebody said brother they heard i was
[1:48:47] with joshua goblin and said i just can't
[1:48:49] see you golfing no you can't cause i

[1:49:10] good ears i didn't even have to try i

[1:50:16] was very passionate about his golf game
[1:50:20] and he was very upset that it took a
[1:50:24] slice off in the other direction from
[1:50:26] the one it was so important to him that
[1:50:29] he just used god's name in vain
[1:50:32] and it's foul
[1:50:35] and it's dangerous
[1:50:40] and you know what i made sure it was
[1:50:42] dangerous
[1:50:45] i said lord you see that man
[1:50:47] i don't believe he don't know better i
[1:50:49] don't believe he doesn't know better i
[1:50:50] believe he knows better i believe his
[1:50:52] mom and daddy taught him not to use that
[1:50:54] name like that
[1:50:56] so lord i'm just asking you stay on his
[1:50:58] shoulder today
[1:51:02] i'm raising my hand over there
[1:51:06] on his shoulder today
[1:51:08] lord i pray that he will use all of his
[1:51:10] might to hit those balls and they'll
[1:51:12] fall at his feet
[1:51:15] i want you to show him the penalty
[1:51:19] of using your name in vain over
[1:51:21] something as stupid as a golf game well
[1:51:23] brother shelley you cursed him he better
[1:51:25] be glad i didn't pray his hair would
[1:51:27] fall out
[1:51:30] all i prayed was lord show this man that
[1:51:34] this is not worth cussing over
[1:51:37] but this shows you how people get so
[1:51:39] wrapped up in what they're doing but
[1:51:42] then they come to church
[1:51:46] [Applause]
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:50] they're afraid to make any noise
[1:51:52] come on now and if they get a little
[1:51:54] squeezed out during worship when the
[1:51:57] word goes forth
[1:52:02] they're not only quiet they're asleep
[1:52:07] say amen
[1:52:08] who are you preaching at anybody that's
[1:52:10] guilty
[1:52:12] now listen
[1:52:13] here's what brother branham said in the
[1:52:14] laodicean church age
[1:52:17] if you'll just let me share that with
[1:52:19] these people here this morning
[1:52:22] it starts off it reminds me of those
[1:52:24] beautiful words first quote from this
[1:52:26] from this morning sheep
[1:52:28] he said it reminds me of those beautiful
[1:52:30] words of first peter 1 8
[1:52:33] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[1:52:37] though now you see him not yet believing
[1:52:40] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:52:43] full of glory
[1:52:45] with them we rejoice also we haven't
[1:52:47] seen him
[1:52:49] but we have felt him
[1:52:51] how many of you can say you felt this
[1:52:53] presence you know he's real
[1:52:55] we know him not as much as our limiting
[1:52:59] uh we know him now as much as our
[1:53:03] limiting senses can let us
[1:53:07] interesting isn't it but one day
[1:53:12] oh
[1:53:14] i feel a show coming out or a hulk
[1:53:16] coming out or oh whoa coming out
[1:53:20] he said but one day it will be
[1:53:23] face
[1:53:25] to face
[1:53:26] he said that is for this age
[1:53:29] he is coming at the end of this age
[1:53:33] i want you to listen to these words he
[1:53:35] said partial realization will be made
[1:53:39] perfect
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:42] hallelujah aren't you looking for that
[1:53:44] day
[1:53:46] when your partial realization of who he
[1:53:49] is will be completed
[1:53:52] and it will be perfect realization
[1:53:55] completed realization hallelujah
[1:54:00] he said we have been looking through a
[1:54:01] glass darkly
[1:54:03] but soon it will be
[1:54:07] face
[1:54:08] to face
[1:54:10] hallelujah he said we have been going
[1:54:13] from glory to glory but soon
[1:54:17] it will be right in the glory
[1:54:19] and in his glory will shine
[1:54:24] we shall be like him
[1:54:26] wondrously
[1:54:28] like him
[1:54:29] jesus our savior divine
[1:54:33] he said isn't that wonderful
[1:54:35] we are
[1:54:36] complete
[1:54:38] in him
[1:54:40] that is true he would not lie to us
[1:54:44] about that
[1:54:46] but one day we will be changed in the
[1:54:49] atoms
[1:54:50] we will put on immortality
[1:54:54] we will be all swallowed up in life
[1:54:58] then we will realize
[1:55:01] realization
[1:55:03] let me tell you something brother
[1:55:04] branham told us that this life is just
[1:55:07] the negative
[1:55:09] he said this isn't the positive this is
[1:55:12] the negative from which the positive
[1:55:14] strikes
[1:55:15] and one of these days we will have more
[1:55:18] than just the the negative we'll have
[1:55:20] more than just the burnt image of the
[1:55:23] real we will have complete realization
[1:55:27] and perfect realization of who he is
[1:55:30] because we will know him and we will see
[1:55:32] him what face to face but until then
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:38] my heart will go on singing
[1:55:43] but until then with joy i'll carry on
[1:55:50] until the day
[1:55:53] my eyes behold that city
[1:55:58] until the day
[1:56:01] he calls
[1:56:03] me home sing again but until then
[1:56:08] my heart will go
[1:56:11] on singing
[1:56:15] and until then
[1:56:18] with joy i'll carry on
[1:56:23] until the day
[1:56:26] my eyes behold
[1:56:29] that city
[1:56:33] until the day
[1:56:36] god calls me
[1:56:40] home the things of earth
[1:56:44] will dim and lose their value
[1:56:48] as we recall
[1:56:49] they're borrowed for a while
[1:56:52] and things of earth that caused the
[1:56:55] heart to tremble
[1:56:57] remembered there
[1:57:01] you remember that trial
[1:57:04] do you remember that heartache that
[1:57:07] burden that unending valley had seen
[1:57:10] that caused your heart to tremble and
[1:57:13] almost caused you to lose your way if
[1:57:15] that should ever come to your mind
[1:57:19] on the other side of eternity give me
[1:57:22] the words back thank you it will only
[1:57:24] bring a smile
[1:57:27] no more trembling
[1:57:29] no more sorrow
[1:57:32] but only bring a smile but until then
[1:57:36] my heart will go on singing
[1:57:40] and until then
[1:57:43] with joy i'll carry on
[1:57:48] until the day
[1:57:50] my eyes behold
[1:57:53] that city
[1:57:56] until the day
[1:57:59] god calls me home
[1:58:03] give us the other verse and let's read
[1:58:04] it this weary world

[1:58:32] waving eagle
[1:58:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:58:38] when it's released it's destined

[1:58:58] to get us dressed up and ready for the
[1:59:00] real life
[1:59:01] the real life is waiting on us over
[1:59:03] there
[1:59:04] oh the soul of man is like a waving
[1:59:06] eagle when it's released it's destined
[1:59:08] for the sky but until then

[1:59:15] on singing
[1:59:18] and until then
[1:59:21] with joy i'll
[1:59:23] carry on
[1:59:27] until the day
[1:59:30] my eyes behold
[1:59:33] that city
[1:59:36] until the day
[1:59:39] god calls
[1:59:41] me
[1:59:42] home
[1:59:44] would you give god praise before you
[1:59:46] seed it
[1:59:49] hallelujah
[1:59:51] [Applause]
[1:59:56] hallelujah
[1:59:58] give me patmos vision would you
[2:00:01] he said have you ever noticed how the
[2:00:03] world yes i read this recently
[2:00:06] guess what i'm going to read it again
[2:00:08] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[2:00:11] into the spirit of things that are in
[2:00:13] the world
[2:00:15] they go to their ball games their
[2:00:16] sporting events their dances
[2:00:19] mm-hmm
[2:00:21] and they enter into the spirit of it
[2:00:23] they don't sit there like wallflowers
[2:00:32] i only square danced once
[2:00:36] and i never did it again you know why
[2:00:38] because i was too good at it
[2:00:43] i enjoyed it too much
[2:00:48] only once
[2:00:49] and then i went and had to go to my
[2:00:50] teacher it was a unit it was a unit in
[2:00:53] physical ed
[2:00:54] only did it once i wasn't prepared to do
[2:00:57] it didn't know we were going to do it
[2:00:58] didn't know it's going to be a whole
[2:00:59] unit
[2:01:00] i got up there and had such a good time
[2:01:03] why because the last saturday night i'd
[2:01:04] been at the church
[2:01:06] the only dancing i'd ever done in my
[2:01:08] life was in pentecostal church
[2:01:10] so when i got up that music got to go
[2:01:12] and i just realized i was having too
[2:01:14] good of a time so the next day i had to
[2:01:16] go early and say to the coach i'm so
[2:01:18] sorry
[2:01:20] i'm not going to be able to take this
[2:01:21] unit can you give me something else to
[2:01:22] do to get my grade he said no way
[2:01:26] he said no way i can i said you have to
[2:01:28] he said absolutely not he said you
[2:01:31] outdanced everybody in the class
[2:01:36] i said i know that's why i can't do it
[2:01:39] he said i don't get you i don't know
[2:01:41] what you mean i said you know that i'm
[2:01:42] pentecostal you know where i come from
[2:01:45] and you know that that we worship god in
[2:01:47] dance
[2:01:49] and i just cannot use what little bit i
[2:01:51] know about groove
[2:01:55] over here
[2:01:57] for some song katie's get the gun
[2:02:01] i just can't do it i just cannot do it
[2:02:03] and he give me a hard time but he gave
[2:02:06] me another assignment
[2:02:08] and when he signed my
[2:02:11] annual that year
[2:02:13] he signed it
[2:02:14] to the best dancer
[2:02:18] i've ever known in my life
[2:02:22] and to a young man that has my respect
[2:02:26] more than any that i've ever known
[2:02:28] for standing for his
[2:02:30] convictions he said go for god that's
[2:02:33] the way he signed it
[2:02:35] i jo i enjoyed it
[2:02:38] and i knew that that was not something
[2:02:40] that i needed to be doing so i didn't do
[2:02:42] it because it was easy for me to get in
[2:02:44] the spirit of it
[2:02:53] when i was pastoring the assembly of god
[2:02:55] church
[2:02:56] over here in phoenix city they took me
[2:02:57] to a braves game
[2:03:01] and they walked up and down the aisles
[2:03:03] of that
[2:03:05] uh
[2:03:07] stadium
[2:03:10] selling beer
[2:03:13] and screaming at the top of them get
[2:03:15] your alcohol
[2:03:20] i i remember it very well
[2:03:22] ice cold alcohol
[2:03:28] and they lined up
[2:03:31] to get them a cold beer
[2:03:33] i said this is not the atmosphere i need
[2:03:35] to be in
[2:03:36] now i went many years later and they
[2:03:38] weren't walking up down the aisles
[2:03:40] saying get your alcohol get your alcohol
[2:03:42] get you but in those days they were
[2:03:43] walking them down the aisle
[2:03:45] saying come get your ice cold alcohol
[2:03:49] well i knew that was no environment for
[2:03:50] me to be in
[2:03:52] i saw people pounding people's heads
[2:03:54] because they got excited
[2:03:56] come on now
[2:03:58] abusing their families
[2:04:00] because they got excited over some you
[2:04:03] can't criticize them
[2:04:05] they're getting in the spirit of what
[2:04:07] they like
[2:04:10] but brother branham said here they enter
[2:04:12] into the spirit of it they don't they
[2:04:13] don't sit there like wall flowers old
[2:04:15] dried up sticks
[2:04:19] i'm sorry for you if you have to sit on
[2:04:21] the road with a dried up stick
[2:04:24] but don't you let that keep you from
[2:04:25] praising the lord
[2:04:28] you take your liberty when you get an
[2:04:29] opportunity to do it
[2:04:31] don't let somebody get your shout out
[2:04:34] if you do they'll never give it back
[2:04:37] come on now let's read on
[2:04:41] he said they enter right into the field
[2:04:42] of things and become a part of things
[2:04:44] but oh how they hate christians
[2:04:47] for getting into the spirit of god's
[2:04:49] word he said they call us fanatics and
[2:04:52] holy rollers
[2:04:54] he said there's nothing they won't do to
[2:04:56] show their hatred and approval
[2:04:58] remember i told you in high school i'd
[2:05:00] walk out onto the pe field and the
[2:05:02] football players would drop and roll
[2:05:04] around on the ground singing holy roller
[2:05:06] holy roller holy roller but you know
[2:05:08] what i loved it
[2:05:11] i loved it
[2:05:13] i loved the idea that every one of them
[2:05:15] knew who i was
[2:05:17] and i didn't have to talk to none of
[2:05:19] them because they'd already heard and
[2:05:20] they all knew and as i've told you many
[2:05:22] many times they pulled me behind the
[2:05:24] locker and said my grandmother's in the
[2:05:26] hospital with a heart attack preacher
[2:05:28] will you pray
[2:05:29] very same ones
[2:05:32] how many of you know the name frank
[2:05:33] thomas
[2:05:34] anybody from sports know the name frank
[2:05:36] thomas
[2:05:38] i went to high school went to went to
[2:05:40] elementary school and junior high school
[2:05:42] with frank thomas
[2:05:44] and i remember the times that he would
[2:05:46] pull me behind the locker and say
[2:05:48] preacher will you pray for my family
[2:05:51] some of the same ones it would be holy
[2:05:53] roller holy roller holy roar in front of
[2:05:55] everybody
[2:05:57] but when they had a need my mom and dad
[2:05:59] are about to get a divorce preacher
[2:06:00] would you pray that god will do
[2:06:02] something i don't want my mom and daddy
[2:06:04] to be split up i don't want to finish
[2:06:05] growing up in a split home in a divorce
[2:06:08] how was that possible
[2:06:10] because i wasn't ashamed
[2:06:13] i was not ashamed of who i was don't you
[2:06:16] ever ever ever be ashamed of who you are
[2:06:19] in christ
[2:06:21] come on now
[2:06:22] and i wonder about people that can't
[2:06:24] have a praise when they get to god's
[2:06:25] house i wonder about how they shine when
[2:06:27] they're out of god's house because
[2:06:30] whatever holds you back from praising
[2:06:32] him in here is likely to try to hold you
[2:06:34] back when you're out there in the world
[2:06:36] and if the world ever needed a shine
[2:06:38] if they ever needed to see the light of
[2:06:40] the glorious gospel of jesus christ it's
[2:06:44] in this dark hour don't you ever be
[2:06:46] ashamed
[2:06:47] he said there's nothing they won't do to
[2:06:48] show their hatred and disapproval but
[2:06:50] here's what brother and told you to do
[2:06:52] about it
[2:06:53] but ignore that
[2:06:54] just ignore that
[2:06:57] you can't expect it knowing where it's
[2:06:59] coming from just go on just go on he
[2:07:01] said just go on he said and do what read
[2:07:04] it for me would you we're hurrying
[2:07:12] and if he didn't mean with all you got
[2:07:15] why in the world that he included here
[2:07:17] with the sports and the dance and the
[2:07:19] things of the world he meant with
[2:07:20] everything you've got let everything
[2:07:23] that hath breath praise the lord praise
[2:07:25] him praise him all ye people praise him
[2:07:28] with a shout out
[2:07:30] come on now praise him with the ten
[2:07:32] stringed instruments psalmist said
[2:07:34] hallelujah praise him with a loud noise
[2:07:39] make a joyful noise unto the lord
[2:07:42] and you know what else he said he also
[2:07:44] said praise him in
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:54] him in the dance
[2:07:56] the dance was not listen dance was not
[2:07:59] for the devil
[2:08:01] it wasn't created for hell
[2:08:04] it wasn't created for the secular life
[2:08:07] dance was originated it originated in
[2:08:10] heaven before the throne of god
[2:08:13] the angels and the living creatures and
[2:08:16] those 24 elders and those who worshipped
[2:08:19] the lord they knew the atmosphere of
[2:08:22] worship
[2:08:24] and dance was included
[2:08:28] hell tried to hijack it
[2:08:31] to make it something lewd
[2:08:34] to make it something vulgar
[2:08:37] to make it something that edifies sin
[2:08:40] and sensuality
[2:08:43] and the charismatic church is doing a
[2:08:45] lot to promote that kind of thing
[2:08:47] sometime with their dance
[2:08:51] because they'll get up and dance in
[2:08:53] their services half-dressed
[2:08:59] and i'm telling you you may think i'm
[2:09:01] just a real
[2:09:02] fanatic but god is not honored
[2:09:07] when we can't use a little modesty
[2:09:10] when we come into the house of god you
[2:09:12] don't have to say amen
[2:09:14] you can call me legalistic you can say
[2:09:16] you're just one of them clothesline pre
[2:09:18] you can say whatever you want to say but
[2:09:20] once you discover what pleases god
[2:09:23] that's what you want to bring him when
[2:09:24] you praise him
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:27] you don't want to show your underneath
[2:09:29] garments when you come to praise the
[2:09:30] lord
[2:09:31] hello
[2:09:33] you want to come holy before him
[2:09:36] it's a worship is sacred
[2:09:39] dancing before the lord is sacred
[2:09:43] even running the aisle is sacred
[2:09:46] come on now
[2:09:48] he said they come in church they sit
[2:09:50] like dried sticks like wall flowers
[2:09:53] he said our spirit is clean
[2:09:56] it is fresh
[2:09:58] it's 107. it's real
[2:10:00] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[2:10:05] full
[2:10:07] full
[2:10:09] whoop
[2:10:10] full of the joy of the lord
[2:10:12] if you're tanking full you can get it
[2:10:14] full this morning
[2:10:15] you can how do i fill my joy tank by
[2:10:18] praising him by lifting him up by
[2:10:21] honoring him hallelujah by singing for
[2:10:23] him
[2:10:24] by worshiping him he said the christian
[2:10:27] the christian ought to be just as
[2:10:38] i'm not saying anything other than that
[2:10:42] i want that to sink in
[2:10:44] the christian ought to be just as
[2:10:45] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[2:10:48] the lord as the world is
[2:10:51] when it savors and delights
[2:10:53] in its pleasures
[2:10:55] anybody believe that am i the only one
[2:10:57] that believes that
[2:10:58] if you're not going to give god all
[2:10:59] you've got just just hold on to it till
[2:11:01] you can do it till you can give god
[2:11:03] everything just hold on to it come on
[2:11:05] you mean you really i really do i really
[2:11:07] do i really really really do i believe
[2:11:09] god deserves everything
[2:11:11] everything we have
[2:11:13] everything we can use to praise him i
[2:11:15] still marvel at the at the at the crazy
[2:11:18] idea of forgive me for sounding so wild
[2:11:20] but i marvel at the crazy idea that i
[2:11:23] can do anything that blesses him
[2:11:27] even though i know who i am from the
[2:11:29] word and from the message i still marvel
[2:11:31] that god would be honored by my by my
[2:11:34] heart
[2:11:41] jump for joy
[2:11:43] and the fact that god would be honored
[2:11:46] by me jumping for joy
[2:11:50] by me clapping my hands
[2:11:53] by me raising my hands the god of all
[2:11:56] eternity receives
[2:12:00] from me
[2:12:01] when i worship him and bless it and i
[2:12:03] get so marveled in that i stand in awe
[2:12:07] of all of that and it makes me want to
[2:12:09] give him all i can and more
[2:12:12] he said full of the joy of the lord the
[2:12:14] christian ought to be just as exuberant
[2:12:16] and full of pleasure full of his
[2:12:18] pleasure in the lord as the world is
[2:12:20] when it savors and delights in its
[2:12:22] pleasures both christians and the world
[2:12:25] are human
[2:12:26] both have emotions
[2:12:30] that i did i didn't finish telling you
[2:12:32] about those people that used to tell me
[2:12:33] i don't you don't never expect that out
[2:12:35] of me because i'm not an emotional
[2:12:37] person
[2:12:40] mama died
[2:12:43] and they asked me to preach the funeral
[2:12:49] i didn't know mama like they did but i
[2:12:50] went
[2:12:53] we're not emotional pastor
[2:12:55] we're not emotional we want you to know
[2:12:56] we're not emotional oh my
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:00] goodness i'm not making fun of anybody's
[2:13:03] hurt
[2:13:05] it's a horrible thing to lose your loved
[2:13:07] one
[2:13:08] but don't come around tell me you're not
[2:13:09] emotional
[2:13:11] i've been in more than one where the
[2:13:13] people's emotion turned the casket over
[2:13:16] i was trying to think but i know at
[2:13:18] least three times
[2:13:20] twice or three i think three times
[2:13:23] i've seen them throw themselves over in
[2:13:25] the box like they were going to go with
[2:13:26] her
[2:13:28] until it just you know what a mess that
[2:13:30] is can you imagine how how you how you
[2:13:32] have to rush to try to put things back
[2:13:36] but then they say i'm not emotional
[2:13:37] don't say you're not emotional
[2:13:39] it just happens something that's that
[2:13:41] precious to you just hadn't struck you
[2:13:43] just yet because when you when you get
[2:13:45] in a precious place like that you'll
[2:13:47] find out who you really are and you may
[2:13:49] be emotional although you've called
[2:13:50] yourself all these years non-emotional
[2:13:52] you get in the real flow of the holy
[2:13:53] spirit
[2:13:56] you get where the power of god really is
[2:13:58] moving and you might find something
[2:13:59] coming out of you that you didn't even
[2:14:01] realize was inside of you
[2:14:03] because there is a joy unspeakable
[2:14:09] he said both christians and the world
[2:14:11] are human both have emotions he said the
[2:14:13] difference is the christians hearts and
[2:14:16] emotions are purely on the lord of glory
[2:14:19] and his love while the world satisfies
[2:14:22] the flesh
[2:14:23] isn't that the truth
[2:14:25] now i looked up that word exuberant
[2:14:26] because this was a this was a a pretty
[2:14:28] big word hearing an important word and i
[2:14:30] looked it up because brother branham
[2:14:32] said that the christian ought to be just
[2:14:34] as exuberant
[2:14:36] and full of his pleasure in the lord as
[2:14:38] the world is when it savors and delights
[2:14:40] in its pleasures so i looked it up for
[2:14:42] you so you can know what the prophet was
[2:14:44] talking about here
[2:14:45] in the book
[2:14:47] joyously unrestrained
[2:14:50] and enthusiastic
[2:14:57] that ain't it
[2:15:07] that ain't it
[2:15:11] it means unrestrained
[2:15:13] that means not held back
[2:15:16] enthusiastic how many of you know
[2:15:18] enthusiastic means enthusiastic with
[2:15:21] enthusiasm
[2:15:25] extreme i'm gonna finish i'm still on
[2:15:27] the definition extreme
[2:15:32] you all see how that brother daniel
[2:15:34] miller acted when he was here
[2:15:41] his eyes got big
[2:15:48] one minute i looked across here and he'd
[2:15:50] done bent over
[2:15:52] up one minute and bent over the next
[2:15:55] nearly down to the ground
[2:16:00] really just a carrying on up here
[2:16:02] in this pulpit
[2:16:08] and you know what i say go get it
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:15] go get it
[2:16:16] [Music]
[2:16:17] give everything you got
[2:16:21] somebody said well i don't know if
[2:16:22] that's just right in the order of things
[2:16:24] or not let me tell you something there
[2:16:26] is a river
[2:16:31] streams thereof glad
[2:16:34] [Music]
[2:16:37] you get in that flow
[2:16:39] harabo
[2:16:43] you get in that flow of anointing in
[2:16:46] spirit life and you are no longer
[2:16:49] satisfied to stand there with it rushing
[2:16:51] across your feet and ankles
[2:16:56] no no no no no no
[2:17:02] one january i was in the in israel with
[2:17:04] my mother
[2:17:07] we were showing her
[2:17:09] around that was the first time she came
[2:17:11] the second time she came was when we
[2:17:14] were all there with as a family the last
[2:17:16] time
[2:17:17] but this was just for her
[2:17:20] and uh i we had
[2:17:22] gotten there with some cold weather
[2:17:25] it was snowing in jerusalem
[2:17:27] i've been there three times when it
[2:17:29] snows it is a sight to see
[2:17:32] it had been snowing in jerusalem and i
[2:17:35] have been in the dead sea
[2:17:37] when the water felt as hot
[2:17:40] as the air around it
[2:17:44] and so i thought i'm getting in the dead
[2:17:46] sea
[2:17:48] mother said well i'll put my feet in i
[2:17:49] said i'll i'm i'll never be satisfied
[2:17:52] just putting my feet in i want to get
[2:17:54] out there until i can feel that that
[2:17:56] salinity of that water just take over
[2:17:58] and start lifting me up i love that
[2:18:00] feeling it's quite a feeling you know
[2:18:03] they tell me they've got a place there
[2:18:05] in columbus where you can go for a salt
[2:18:08] salt experience like that
[2:18:10] when i'm not in the pulpit if you ask me
[2:18:12] i'll tell you something about the owners
[2:18:14] and how i know them
[2:18:16] but i won't tell it here it's too
[2:18:18] strange
[2:18:20] but i love that feeling well i did not
[2:18:22] expect the water to be cold
[2:18:25] it was cool outside i had on a jacket
[2:18:27] but i wasn't expecting the water to be
[2:18:29] that cold and i want you to know
[2:18:31] something
[2:18:32] it was cold now when we got down there
[2:18:34] to that beach where i've been with a lot
[2:18:36] of you nathan i remember being there
[2:18:37] with you
[2:18:38] and you get to that beach and there's
[2:18:40] usually quite a few people out there
[2:18:42] and secular israelis
[2:18:45] don't cover up
[2:18:48] religious ones do
[2:18:50] secular ones don't and them old grandpa
[2:18:53] hairy men
[2:18:57] like gorillas
[2:19:00] so you always tried to find a place
[2:19:01] where you could get where there wouldn't
[2:19:02] be a lot of people and of course we went
[2:19:04] in dressed
[2:19:06] in the orthodox and the religious jews
[2:19:08] they'll go in with their clothes on
[2:19:10] well we went in
[2:19:12] i mean i when we got down there i
[2:19:13] noticed there's nobody there not one i'd
[2:19:16] never been there before without one
[2:19:19] single
[2:19:20] person on the beach
[2:19:22] not
[2:19:23] one
[2:19:26] and i said we hit the jackpot i can't
[2:19:29] hardly wait to get in the water
[2:19:31] mother said well i might get in i'm not
[2:19:32] going out then if nobody's there
[2:19:35] and we went and
[2:19:37] she had her had her jean skirt on and i
[2:19:39] had my sweat pants on and we get in and
[2:19:42] i want you to know when i put my foot in
[2:19:44] that was the coldest water i had ever
[2:19:46] felt i don't know how in the world it
[2:19:50] was that cold i'd never felt that and i
[2:19:52] said oh no no no no no no
[2:19:55] i'll get my feet wet but that's all but
[2:19:57] you know what the longer i stood there
[2:20:00] the more i begin to remember what it
[2:20:02] feels like
[2:20:04] when you wait out you just start walking
[2:20:07] you can do it you just start walking
[2:20:09] and after a while you can't walk anymore
[2:20:12] cause your feet start lifting up
[2:20:14] and you better close your mouth
[2:20:17] and you better close your eyes because
[2:20:19] that's the worst tasting stuff you've
[2:20:20] ever tasted and it'll sting your eye you
[2:20:23] don't even have to relax and let
[2:20:24] yourself go you can just walk just keep
[2:20:26] walking out and all of a sudden your
[2:20:28] feet will not hit the bottom anymore and
[2:20:30] it's like you're walking on air i begin
[2:20:32] to remember what wonderful feeling
[2:20:34] weightlessness how wonderful that feels
[2:20:37] and all of a sudden my desire to
[2:20:40] experience that again was was more
[2:20:43] strong it was stronger than the fact
[2:20:46] that the water was so cold i could
[2:20:48] hardly stand there so i just kept
[2:20:50] walking with my teeth chattering in my
[2:20:52] mouth until my feet just lifted up and
[2:20:55] the next thing you know i am the only
[2:20:57] one as far as the eye can see enjoying
[2:21:00] the dead sea when the water was as
[2:21:03] frigid i cannot tell you how cold it was
[2:21:06] but this is how it is sometime i could
[2:21:08] not stand to just let that water run
[2:21:11] over my ankles i had there was something
[2:21:14] pulling me
[2:21:15] to experience again
[2:21:18] what i had experienced before
[2:21:22] don't you be satisfied ezekiel in the
[2:21:25] ankle deep water
[2:21:28] you get on out there and let it run up
[2:21:31] to your knees and when that is not deep
[2:21:33] enough let it rise to your thighs
[2:21:37] and before you know it you will find a
[2:21:40] river
[2:21:42] that cannot be crossed over
[2:21:44] you will find a river that is so
[2:21:47] powerful that all you can do is find
[2:21:50] these waters to swim in
[2:21:52] how many of you have ever experienced
[2:21:53] something like that in the spirit where
[2:21:55] you felt like you found waters to swim
[2:21:57] in let it be so i pray right now i'm not
[2:22:01] asking you lord to make fanatics out of
[2:22:03] these church people i'm not asking you
[2:22:05] to cause them to be out of order i'm not
[2:22:08] asking you to make them wild without any
[2:22:10] sense at all of what they're doing but
[2:22:12] i'm asking you lord to let every one of
[2:22:15] us who have such a desire to find that
[2:22:17] place in you where our desire to be lost
[2:22:21] in that presence of god is stronger than
[2:22:24] any reluctance that we might have and
[2:22:26] god give us the faith we need to keep
[2:22:29] wading in
[2:22:34] wait out a little deeper
[2:22:38] you stood and waited on the shoreline
[2:22:40] much too long
[2:22:42] wait out in the water
[2:22:45] be filled with the spirit
[2:22:48] wait out in the water with god's happy
[2:22:50] shouting throng
[2:22:52] wait out in the water
[2:22:55] just a little bit deeper
[2:22:57] you've stood and waited on the shoreline
[2:22:59] much too long
[2:23:01] wait out in the water
[2:23:03] be filled with the spirit
[2:23:06] wait out in the water with god's happy
[2:23:08] shouting throng
[2:23:10] we'll hurt you
[2:23:12] there's nothing in that river of spirit
[2:23:15] that will harm you in any way
[2:23:18] it'll give you life
[2:23:20] now i'm nearly closing
[2:23:22] i hadn't preached
[2:23:23] but whatever i've done i've enjoyed it
[2:23:27] be not afraid let me give them this one
[2:23:30] i'm going to skip these verses here
[2:23:31] we'll come back to them i guess i did
[2:23:33] squeeze the tuesday night i sang so much
[2:23:36] i sang so much while i'm preaching i
[2:23:37] squeezed a tuesday night out of these
[2:23:39] notes
[2:23:40] 1 162. he said that's what the church
[2:23:43] needs to diet
[2:23:46] needs the holy ghost and fire
[2:23:48] to get a church to move for the kingdom
[2:23:50] of god
[2:23:52] he said it'll walk then
[2:23:57] it won't stand still then
[2:23:59] he said a revival except christ the word
[2:24:03] believe it
[2:24:05] let it sink down below the fifth rib on
[2:24:08] the left side
[2:24:11] till it anchors down to the bottom of
[2:24:13] the heart hallelujah
[2:24:16] then
[2:24:17] floods of joy
[2:24:21] will spring up
[2:24:23] and joy unspeakable and full of glory
[2:24:26] don't you know brother shelly how
[2:24:29] expensive gas is
[2:24:33] don't you know what a political mess our
[2:24:36] country did don't you know there's poor
[2:24:39] ukrainian people under the bomb
[2:24:43] don't you know the political power of
[2:24:45] the world is nearly shifting in this
[2:24:47] hour don't you know people are still
[2:24:50] suffering with covet etc etc don't you
[2:24:53] know cancer rates are higher than ever
[2:24:55] before don't you know abortion is out of
[2:24:57] sight again
[2:24:59] i know all those things
[2:25:01] i know all those things but i will be no
[2:25:03] good
[2:25:05] to any of those perils
[2:25:08] unless i pray through
[2:25:10] to the power of the holy ghost
[2:25:13] which brings joy unspeakable and full of
[2:25:16] glory
[2:25:17] somebody's got to give them something
[2:25:19] more than what they get on the news
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:23] somebody's got to carry jesus to them
[2:25:27] and this world is too smart for a dead
[2:25:30] dry religion
[2:25:31] [Applause]
[2:25:33] she will never satisfy with that anymore
[2:25:37] it'll have to be something that works
[2:25:40] it'll have to be something that can
[2:25:42] actually be felt
[2:25:44] because we're living in a sensory world
[2:25:46] now
[2:25:47] where people only react to something
[2:25:49] they can feel
[2:25:50] somebody said well that just leaves us
[2:25:52] out oh don't leave me out
[2:25:54] because when i found god i found
[2:25:55] something i can feel
[2:25:58] yes i had another song but i'll skip it
[2:26:06] he said and the holy spirit will make
[2:26:08] you sing
[2:26:11] fill my way every day with love as i
[2:26:13] walk with the heavenly dove
[2:26:16] it'll do something to you when we need
[2:26:17] it it'll just put energy puts energy in
[2:26:19] there it'll do something for you how
[2:26:21] many of you believe it will
[2:26:23] it'll do something for you uh planting
[2:26:25] the vine and where to plant it
[2:26:27] people don't believe in shouting
[2:26:30] the thing of it is they haven't got a
[2:26:31] spiritual joy
[2:26:33] and the joys of the waters of life can
[2:26:35] fall through there's a whole lot is the
[2:26:37] matter with the branham tabernacle
[2:26:39] because that unbelief the cares of the
[2:26:41] world had bound the people until it
[2:26:43] cannot produce spiritual growth
[2:26:49] he said that's what's the matter with
[2:26:50] our nation that's what's the matter with
[2:26:51] our churches they have no joy and the
[2:26:53] joy of the lord has departed as it was
[2:26:55] written one time in the scripture the
[2:26:56] hebrew word of ichabod which means the
[2:26:58] presence of the lord
[2:27:00] the presence of the lord hath departed
[2:27:03] how many of you know that's an awful
[2:27:05] thing
[2:27:06] the presence of the lord hath departed
[2:27:11] he said uh give me the rest
[2:27:14] he said that's over our churches because
[2:27:16] that we left off the original foundation
[2:27:18] and placed ourselves into creeds and
[2:27:20] denomination and permitted the things of
[2:27:22] the world to dry up our experience with
[2:27:24] god let me tell you about the modern
[2:27:25] church while the musicians are coming
[2:27:27] let me tell you what's happened
[2:27:29] the fire has gone out
[2:27:31] the joy of the lord is left
[2:27:34] and they have replaced it with a form of
[2:27:36] entertainment
[2:27:40] i'm sorry
[2:27:42] if i've upset anybody i'm sorry
[2:27:44] there is something wrong when a church
[2:27:46] has to have a smoke machine
[2:27:52] you see i'm old enough brother skip to
[2:27:55] remember
[2:27:56] when i was a boy and the glory of god
[2:28:00] would come down out there on highway 27
[2:28:05] the building is gone but i can show you
[2:28:07] the spot
[2:28:09] there's a seven-day adventist church
[2:28:11] that sits across the road and just a
[2:28:13] little bit beyond that spot on highway
[2:28:15] 27 old hamilton road is where the old
[2:28:18] church and i can show it to you
[2:28:23] don't go nowhere yet we're nearly done
[2:28:42] wasn't much to look at
[2:28:49] this on the left is the church in south
[2:28:51] carolina i was pastoring when i heard
[2:28:53] the message but but this over here see
[2:28:55] this old
[2:28:58] when we left it it become a
[2:29:00] a place where they had jamborees and
[2:29:02] things again
[2:29:04] cloggers
[2:29:05] that little place all it ever knew was
[2:29:07] dancing
[2:29:10] it was a bar it was a
[2:29:11] it was a honky tonk
[2:29:14] before we had it
[2:29:16] it was called mary's place
[2:29:19] i know i've met people not too long ago
[2:29:22] i met a couple
[2:29:23] who said i remember when your granny
[2:29:24] used to have church out at mary's old
[2:29:27] place
[2:29:28] mary was a big old woman
[2:29:31] nothing wrong with that
[2:29:33] she was a big old woman and she sat on a
[2:29:34] stool with a shotgun
[2:29:39] and she ran a honky tonk
[2:29:42] you weren't never there brother shaw
[2:29:43] were you but you did hear stories about
[2:29:46] mary she was wild
[2:29:50] she wouldn't let no caring zone go on
[2:29:55] if there was any shooting done she did
[2:29:56] it first
[2:29:59] it's true
[2:30:02] and they would go out there and get
[2:30:03] drunk and dance all night and carry on
[2:30:06] in mary's old place
[2:30:09] the lord spoke to my grandmother and
[2:30:11] said there needs to be a pentecostal
[2:30:12] church out in that in that area
[2:30:14] and this was before she heard the
[2:30:16] message of truth
[2:30:17] and she had a desire to make sure there
[2:30:19] was and she didn't call it a church
[2:30:21] it never was called a church it was
[2:30:23] called a prayer center
[2:30:26] so when you look us up on the amazon
[2:30:29] smile
[2:30:30] and someone just asked us recently
[2:30:32] texted my wife and asked
[2:30:34] how to find us on amazon smile if you
[2:30:37] if you uh purchase something from amazon
[2:30:39] and most everybody does if you find us
[2:30:42] on amazon smile then the church gets a
[2:30:44] small portion of everything you purchase
[2:30:47] and we do not get to see what you
[2:30:49] purchase
[2:30:50] they don't show us what you purchase we
[2:30:52] have no access to your purchases
[2:30:55] but but ever every month or so we'll we
[2:30:57] might get 9 or dollars twelve dollars or
[2:31:00] something like that from an amazon
[2:31:02] a smile donation it goes right into the
[2:31:05] account sometimes it's a little more
[2:31:06] than that i don't even think it would be
[2:31:07] two hundred dollars a year
[2:31:09] but every penny helps
[2:31:11] and if you looked us up you would find
[2:31:13] us not under new hope revival ministries
[2:31:15] that's how we do business but you'd find
[2:31:17] us under the original charter
[2:31:19] and the original charter is new hope
[2:31:21] assembly prayer center
[2:31:26] and
[2:31:26] it never was really called a church
[2:31:29] my granny wanted a place where people
[2:31:31] could pray and where they could
[2:31:32] experience god
[2:31:35] and the other churches this is a truth
[2:31:37] you got a few more minutes thank you
[2:31:39] the other churches would would bring
[2:31:41] their demon possessed
[2:31:45] for us to pray for
[2:31:48] so they would get the deliverance that
[2:31:49] they needed
[2:31:51] and i've told you the stories of how we
[2:31:53] stood right on those steps
[2:31:56] i've got the bricks
[2:31:58] of some of those steps on my front porch
[2:32:01] i've got one brick sitting there and
[2:32:03] several in another place in my yard from
[2:32:05] those steps
[2:32:07] because the building is no longer there
[2:32:10] and we stood right on those steps
[2:32:13] and my grandmother's nephew
[2:32:16] said
[2:32:18] aunt mildred
[2:32:19] i don't believe in those foreign lights
[2:32:23] and what he meant by that is the balls
[2:32:25] of fire and pillar of fire was showing
[2:32:27] up in those days
[2:32:28] and hanging visibly over the building
[2:32:32] more than one time in my life i heard
[2:32:34] the
[2:32:34] the sound of a of a 18-weeter locking
[2:32:38] his brakes
[2:32:40] and skidding into the back parking lot
[2:32:42] behind the behind the church just as you
[2:32:44] passed the church there was another
[2:32:46] place that you could pull in and park if
[2:32:48] the front was full
[2:32:51] and the door would open up
[2:32:53] and some old
[2:32:55] truck driver rough looking
[2:32:57] truck driver would come in stumbling
[2:32:59] down to the altar
[2:33:02] throw itself on the altar and say
[2:33:04] somebody pray for me
[2:33:06] and those folks we would get down and
[2:33:08] pray for them just like we knew who they
[2:33:10] were we would get down and pray for them
[2:33:11] and god would touch them and save them
[2:33:13] and sometimes fill them with the holy
[2:33:15] ghost
[2:33:16] and when it was over they would stand
[2:33:18] and say do you know why i'm here
[2:33:22] we'd say no why because a fireball was
[2:33:25] hanging over this church as i was coming
[2:33:28] down highway 27. i remember one man's
[2:33:31] name his name was wayne and i remember
[2:33:33] him very very well
[2:33:36] and he came in like that that night and
[2:33:38] he said there was a ball of fire hanging
[2:33:41] over the church and i said my i wonder
[2:33:43] what that is about and all of a sudden
[2:33:45] an angel appeared in the middle of the
[2:33:48] highway with a sword over his head and
[2:33:51] said this is for you
[2:33:56] he said i don't know if you heard it
[2:33:57] over the music but i locked my brakes
[2:34:01] and slid into your gravel parking lot
[2:34:03] out there because i knew this was for me
[2:34:07] and the presence of god would become so
[2:34:09] real in that place at night when we
[2:34:12] would be having service and sometime on
[2:34:14] a sunday morning too we had saturday
[2:34:16] night sunday morning sunday night and
[2:34:18] tuesday night
[2:34:21] the glory of god
[2:34:23] would become so real in there that it
[2:34:25] would fill the house like a smoke
[2:34:28] and i've been standing on the pulpit
[2:34:31] looking back at the congregation and
[2:34:33] their faces disappear
[2:34:36] because the smoke of god's presence that
[2:34:38] holy holy holy holy presence that smokey
[2:34:41] cloud of god's glory
[2:34:45] just like the cloud that came down there
[2:34:48] in uh apostolic ark when vicky tidwell
[2:34:51] got the holy ghost
[2:34:53] i have a picture that was snapped
[2:34:56] and the holy ghost she said i've been in
[2:34:58] church all my life but i don't know
[2:34:59] whether or not i've got the holy ghost
[2:35:01] and we prayed over her that day and god
[2:35:03] filled her refilled her or filled her
[2:35:05] whichever it really was
[2:35:06] someone snapped a picture and she's
[2:35:08] standing in a smoke cloud you can't see
[2:35:10] anything but a long black hair hanging
[2:35:13] down the back some of you have seen it
[2:35:14] in my office same cloud same smoky
[2:35:17] presence of god do you have to see that
[2:35:19] no
[2:35:20] if you never see it again let me be a
[2:35:22] witness to you and tell you it's real
[2:35:24] but something is very wrong with the
[2:35:25] modern church when they have to pay
[2:35:29] to put in a smoke machine
[2:35:31] to set an ambiance
[2:35:33] to set an atmosphere
[2:35:36] when it used to be the spirit of god
[2:35:38] setting the atmosphere
[2:35:41] and they've got to put different colored
[2:35:42] lights on everything and make it look
[2:35:44] like some kind of a concert or some kind
[2:35:47] of production or some kind of
[2:35:48] entertainment light shining up on this
[2:35:50] and that the other let me tell you what
[2:35:52] god used to do for us
[2:35:55] nothing but but naked light bulbs
[2:35:57] hanging down
[2:35:58] not even a globe on them sometime
[2:36:02] but you've never been to a place more
[2:36:04] colorful than that
[2:36:06] because when the presence of god would
[2:36:08] flow and the power of god would move in
[2:36:10] that church colored lights would flash
[2:36:12] all over the building
[2:36:16] and people would say i saw flashes of
[2:36:19] amber i saw flashes of red i saw flashes
[2:36:22] of silver
[2:36:24] why because the presence of god somebody
[2:36:27] said i don't believe in that then don't
[2:36:28] read the book of revelation
[2:36:30] because there's a rainbow about his
[2:36:31] throne
[2:36:32] [Applause]
[2:36:34] you don't believe in that doesn't matter
[2:36:35] whether you do or not that's that's
[2:36:37] that's some of the things that we saw in
[2:36:39] that hour but the modern church has
[2:36:42] found a way to create an ambiance
[2:36:46] and an atmosphere for people to find
[2:36:48] some kind of a feeling
[2:36:51] that helps to satisfy them i'm not
[2:36:53] looking for that
[2:36:55] you can say amen or on me i'm not here
[2:36:56] to be critical not trying to be critical
[2:36:58] i'm just telling you what a substitute
[2:37:00] what a poor poor substitute for what we
[2:37:04] have seen
[2:37:06] and you say well some of us some of us
[2:37:08] would love to see that get your heart
[2:37:09] right let's get right let's let's get
[2:37:12] some of the world kicked out of our
[2:37:13] lives let's come back to him in holy
[2:37:16] consecration
[2:37:18] there's married people in this room that
[2:37:20] were filled with the holy ghost standing
[2:37:22] under right now this here today standing
[2:37:24] under a pillar of fire that hung visibly
[2:37:27] over the church in columbus
[2:37:30] we've seen the glory of god
[2:37:33] we've seen angels lined up and down the
[2:37:35] the walls but that's not why we come
[2:37:39] if we never saw anything like that again
[2:37:41] that's not the reason why we come
[2:37:44] we come because he's worthy
[2:37:47] we come because we want to praise him
[2:37:50] help me just a little bit
[2:37:52] but i will tell you this in closing
[2:37:55] i will give you this testimony
[2:37:57] he filled me with the holy ghost when i
[2:37:59] was seven years old i'm going to turn 54
[2:38:02] next month
[2:38:07] i read it on my hospital bracelet last
[2:38:09] week 53 and it felt like a lie
[2:38:14] when i first looked at it i thought it
[2:38:16] could not be so
[2:38:18] sister alfreda's got a birthday coming
[2:38:20] up bigger than that
[2:38:22] a real milestone
[2:38:25] and she's the one that i saw her face it
[2:38:27] reacted like how can this be how did
[2:38:29] this happen
[2:38:30] how did these years come by the way they
[2:38:32] did
[2:38:34] well i'm so glad brother shelley you no
[2:38:35] longer believe the best is yet to but i
[2:38:37] do
[2:38:38] but i do
[2:38:40] i still believe nathan the best is yet
[2:38:42] to come
[2:38:44] i still believe it is yet to be seen
[2:38:46] around here what god wants to do with
[2:38:48] the people that are fully dedicated and
[2:38:50] fully consecrated to him i don't care if
[2:38:53] he comes in a pillar of light i don't
[2:38:54] care if it comes into smoke i don't care
[2:38:57] i don't care if any of those things
[2:38:58] happen but what i want to see happen is
[2:39:00] lives laid down at the feet of a living
[2:39:02] god
[2:39:03] i want to see people that god can use
[2:39:05] and step into you and use you for his
[2:39:08] glory and until we get to that place i
[2:39:11] want to see you experiencing a joy that
[2:39:14] is unspeakable and full of glory
[2:39:18] so within reason you don't have to worry
[2:39:20] about me stopping your praise in fact
[2:39:22] i'm going to be the one up here with as
[2:39:24] a cheerleader trying to get you to
[2:39:25] praise him more
[2:39:31] because that is how you find a place
[2:39:35] of
[2:39:37] and confidence in him play something
[2:39:42] there is a joy
[2:39:45] that can't be told
[2:39:48] it can't be explained
[2:39:50] it can only be experienced
[2:39:53] it finds a way of expression
[2:39:56] you may not understand somebody waving a
[2:39:58] flag
[2:40:00] you may not understand somebody waving
[2:40:02] their arms like a like waving an
[2:40:04] airplane into its slot
[2:40:07] you you may not understand somebody
[2:40:09] trembling like this in the presence of
[2:40:11] the lord
[2:40:12] you may be like those who come and said
[2:40:15] i don't know why they're all crying
[2:40:18] you may wonder why somebody's laughing
[2:40:20] right in church
[2:40:23] all these things may feel foreign to you
[2:40:26] but i want to tell you there's a joy
[2:40:27] that's unspeakable
[2:40:30] but full of glory
[2:40:32] you know what glory is it's the
[2:40:33] atmosphere of heaven
