Description:
The covenant God made with us through the blood of Jesus Christ will always be binding.  He wrote a fixed contract. Should we fail and stumble and not choose His righteousness, our contract could be considered null and void. But God’s contract is higher.  His contract says, “Both He who sanctifies, and he who is sanctified is one.”  When we have become one with Him, even breaking our vow cannot ‘null and void’ that contract, because we have become one with the Testator.  We have become one with Him.  That makes me run to Jesus and completely love and trust Him.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because you have become one with the testator he will be true to this Covenant that he made with us through the blood of the body of the Lord Jesus a covenant is a legal binding contract for either of the parties involved to fail to carry out their contracted details and requirements as outlined in the legal agreement it can render the remainder of the agreed terms both null and void I'll talk to you about that just a moment have you ever broke your Covenant with the Lord let me see you let me see you let me see you have you ever broke your Covenant with the Lord sure we have if you chose anything but his righteousness now doesn't it seem like them that the whole thing would be null and void legally it would be but God couldn't allow that to happen he wrote a fixed contract he rigged a contract he didn't write a contract that can be held to the standards of American law he wrote one bigger than that he said both he who sanctifies and he who is Sanctified is one and even your breaking your vow cannot know and void the contract because you have become one with the testator you have become one with him now if that makes you want to be spiritually lazy you're not hearing this with a revelation you're hearing it with a head knowledge when I hear this it doesn't make me want to see what I can do to be more like the world and make me want to pursue the things of life in the world anymore it makes me want to run to Jesus with everything I've got and say Lord oh papa look what you did you required so much of me and then you stepped out and became all that was required of me he who is joined in the Lord to the Lord is one spirit with him you ever read this Bible it's a book full of crack pots it's a book full of murderers adulterers all all believers cheaters gamblers usurpers and yet God used every one of them he had a plan he had a purpose he did not look for Perfect People he needed the people that were not perfect so that he could send the Holy Ghost into their lives and make them perfect I loved him enough to come from the balconies of heaven and walk among them and bleed and be tempted first and then bleed and die and resurrect on their behalf but I'll go one more than that because when I leave this world I know they're going to be tempted to trust me one minute and doubt me the next I know life is going to squeeze them here and shove them there and place them over Yonder so what I will do is I won't just be a God above them and I won't just be a god with them but I'll come right down and be a god living in them
