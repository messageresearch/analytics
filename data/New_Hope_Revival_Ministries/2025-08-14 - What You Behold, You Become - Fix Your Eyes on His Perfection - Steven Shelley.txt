Description:
We become what we behold.
Focus on your flaws,
and you’ll keep stumbling over the same things.
But fix your eyes on His perfection,
and everything changes.

He chose you before you could choose yourself.
He’s calling you to a higher place of devotion—
the tent, the pavilion, the place of rest.
There is a rest for the people of God.
It’s found when faith takes hold
and won’t let go.

I will linger in the tent.
I will dwell in His presence.
I will stand in the glory
of the fullness of the Seventh Seal.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And you know, we become like what we focus on. &gt;&gt; That's New Testament. Paul said it. &gt;&gt; The more we gaze on uh our unworthiness, &gt;&gt; the more we produce unworthy behavior, we keep getting tripped up in the same old stuff because our uh shortcoming is what we focus on. But when we start focusing on his perfection, his beauty, his he has elected us. He has called us. The reality is we wouldn't have perhaps chosen ourselves. But we didn't have to. I wish somebody would help me. &gt;&gt; We didn't have to choose ourselves because he chose us. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it, you just go to the book. The book said, "You have not chosen me." &gt;&gt; Amen. But I have chosen you, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm telling you, if he chooses you, it's because he knows that you have a heart to serve him. It's because he knows that when you say yes, it will be an eternal yes. If he chose you, it's because he saw your end. Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw your end and he knew that you in the end was worth &gt;&gt; whatever it took &gt;&gt; to get you to that end. &gt;&gt; You, my friend, as a born again believer of an end time truth, you have a fixed end. &gt;&gt; Your end is determined. You can play around sometime with your present because too many believers oscillate between the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God. It's a very serious hour that we're living in right now. It may not be your priority, but it's his priority for us &gt;&gt; that we catch a glimpse and an understanding of this place that the bride must walk in, live in, minister in, worship in before we leave here in rapture. Do you believe in rapture? I do. &gt;&gt; Have you had one this week? I have. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there will be there will be a culmination. &gt;&gt; There will be an hour where all the dead in Christ &gt;&gt; in Christ shall rise first. They which are alive and remain will be caught up. There is an event that will culminate and bring to climax the rapture. But as I told you last week, rapture is being caught up out of your mundane. grit and grind, pedal to the metal Monday, &gt;&gt; and and coming up into a higher place of devotion, consecration, and worship. &gt;&gt; And it's in that place that we find the tabernacle, the pavilion, we also find the rest. &gt;&gt; How many of you like the idea of rest? Well, there is a rest promised to the people of God. &gt;&gt; And it's a spiritual rest, but it refreshes even the natural part of who we are. &gt;&gt; That's what the tabernacle of David represents. That's what the rest that the children of Israel could not find. &gt;&gt; They heard the word. They heard everything necessary to find that place. But it benefited them nothing. Is that what he said? Very little. Because they didn't mix it with faith. They didn't say that's me. So when somebody rediscovers what God has promised to be doing for us in the end time, then you have an opportunity to find something in that that calls to your destiny. And when you hear that call to your destiny and your inner man begins to quiver and vibrate because of a truth that you have heard, then you allow faith to come rushing in. And faith takes a bulldog grip &gt;&gt; on the promise and it says, "I don't care if anybody else takes a hold of this or not. I'm going to take a hold of this and it's not just going to be a memory. For me, it will be a reality &gt;&gt; because I'll spend enough time in the tent. &gt;&gt; I'll spend enough time in the pavilion. I'll spend enough time in the sanctuary. I'll spend enough time in the shecka. &gt;&gt; I'll spend enough time in the glory. &gt;&gt; I'll get under the inspiration of the fullness of the seventh seal.
