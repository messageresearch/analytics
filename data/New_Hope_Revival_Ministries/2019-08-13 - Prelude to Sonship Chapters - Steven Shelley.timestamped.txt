[0:13] [Music]
[0:17] it was just after my fifth birthday that
[0:20] my parents divorced and it seemed like
[0:24] overnight my mom became both mother to
[0:27] me and father she was my comforter my
[0:32] nurturer and she also had to be the
[0:35] chief disciplinarian and she was good at
[0:39] both I think that mother realized that
[0:44] me being an only child raised in a
[0:47] single-parent home that things would be
[0:50] a little different
[0:51] for me I believe that by the age of five
[0:56] my mother already knew that there was a
[0:59] call of God on my life she didn't
[1:01] understand it but I think she wanted to
[1:04] do anything that she could to help
[1:06] prepare me for whatever my life would
[1:09] hold there were times that I felt like
[1:13] she was a bit rough but when I look back
[1:18] over my life I realize that she was
[1:21] training me she was in her way helping
[1:26] to prepare me for my future and she was
[1:30] doing it because she loved me now I have
[1:34] to be honest in the heat of the moment I
[1:38] didn't always feel loved the Bible tells
[1:42] us that in Hebrews chapter 12 and verse
[1:45] 11 it says all discipline for the moment
[1:48] seems not to be joyful but sorrowful yet
[1:52] to those who have been trained by it
[1:54] afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit
[1:59] of righteousness you see we have a
[2:04] Heavenly Father who loves us so very
[2:08] much it is his desire to bring us to
[2:13] that place where we can perfectly
[2:16] reflect to a lost world
[2:20] his character his divine nature for some
[2:26] of us our training looks different I
[2:28] feel like that we go through different
[2:31] circumstances and different trials
[2:33] because we have a father who has seen
[2:36] all of our days he has them recorded in
[2:40] his book he knows exactly how we're
[2:44] going to be used for the sake of his
[2:47] kingdom and when and he knows exactly
[2:50] what it will take to get us to the place
[2:54] that he can really use us for his glory
[3:00] Spurgeon said that trials teach us what
[3:05] we are they dig up the soil and let us
[3:09] see what we are made of the Bible tells
[3:14] us that when the children of Israel were
[3:18] wandering in the wilderness in
[3:20] Deuteronomy 8 that God led them for
[3:24] those 40 years in the wilderness to
[3:28] prove them to Humble them and to know
[3:34] what was in their heart you know God
[3:38] already knows what's in our heart he
[3:41] knows what's there but I believe that he
[3:45] allows us to walk through places in life
[3:48] that bring to the surface
[3:52] what is on the inside of our heart God
[3:57] giving us a chance to make it right
[4:00] and to correct it but our father is
[4:05] doing what he does and allowing what he
[4:08] allows for our profit for our good it
[4:15] may be hard to rejoice in the moment but
[4:18] we need to remember that there's great
[4:21] value great benefit and blessing when we
[4:26] pass
[4:27] faithfully through the trials and
[4:30] testings of life the Bible is filled
[4:33] with examples of those who went through
[4:36] the fire went through great hardship and
[4:40] through it all glorified the God of
[4:44] heaven gave God praise in all things he
[4:50] tells us in the last part of verse 10 he
[4:56] does these things for our prophet that
[5:00] we might be partakers of his holiness
[5:05] all of our good beads all of our
[5:08] righteousness our separated way of
[5:11] living none of that could attain or
[5:16] bring us to that place of his holiness
[5:20] and yet he said you are being trained
[5:25] instructed so that you might be
[5:29] partakers of my holiness that's how much
[5:36] he loves us brother Branham said that
[5:41] God allows certain things to happen in
[5:47] our life just to see what we will do
[5:50] about it he said every son that cometh
[5:53] to God must be tried and chastened and
[5:56] proved and then he said Satan will make
[6:00] you prove every inch of ground that you
[6:03] claim he certainly will so sometimes God
[6:08] lets these things happen not because he
[6:12] doesn't love us but because he does he
[6:17] went on to say he does these things
[6:19] sometime to see what kind of attitude
[6:21] you take so it's important that we
[6:24] maintain the right spirit that we keep
[6:27] the right attitude no matter what we're
[6:29] walking through in life and then I like
[6:33] what he said
[6:34] God trains his men then anoints them
[6:38] gives them experience takes them through
[6:41] the rigid training down through the
[6:44] sands of burning punishment trying and
[6:46] testing not only does he do that for his
[6:49] prophets he does it for his children
[6:51] because every son that cometh to God
[6:54] must be chasing tried tested by the word
[6:59] he talks about in the days before the
[7:03] smelter when they were looking for gold
[7:05] and they would get that gold ore out of
[7:09] the ground and they would pound it and
[7:11] pounded and pounded until it became so
[7:15] pure all the dross fell off just gold
[7:20] left and so shiny that the prospector
[7:24] could see his reflection in the gold
[7:27] what you're going through right now you
[7:31] may feel like you're under the hammer it
[7:34] certainly does not feel good in the heat
[7:39] of the trial in the midst of the battle
[7:42] but I believe that God's children our
[7:45] ultimate desire is to be totally
[7:49] surrendered to him we must not despise
[7:53] the correction the chastening of the
[7:56] Lord but we must allow him even invite
[8:00] him to do whatever is necessary to allow
[8:07] whatever is necessary so that we can
[8:11] become like that gold a real reflection
[8:15] when he looks into our life he sees
[8:19] himself looking back I don't know what
[8:24] you're going through today you may be in
[8:27] the greatest trial of your life you may
[8:32] feel rejected alone forsaken forgotten
[8:37] but I want you to know that your father
[8:40] loves you he is right there with you in
[8:46] the midst of what you're walking through
[8:48] and if you can look above the
[8:53] circumstance give God all the praise he
[8:58] deserves he will grant you the grace to
[9:02] get through to endure the Bible says
[9:07] those who endure to the end they're the
[9:11] ones delivered they're the ones saved I
[9:14] want you to know that we're praying for
[9:18] you that you will press the battle that
[9:23] you will worship the king and that you
[9:29] will begin to recognize that there is
[9:33] great value and profit in the training
[9:37] of the Lord god bless you
