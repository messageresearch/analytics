[0:00] the Bible literally says he became
[0:04] sin it it it means what it
[0:08] says he not only took on our sin but he
[0:11] was
[0:12] transfigured
[0:14] transformed into our sin it's powerful
[0:18] it's
[0:19] huge if I could think of how that Jesus
[0:22] when he died he went and preached to the
[0:24] souls that were in prison he died a
[0:27] sinner knowing no sin
[0:31] amazing because the sin wasn't in the
[0:34] Inner Man the sin was on his
[0:36] flesh and God for his sins sent him to
[0:42] hell
[0:44] oh he couldn't bypass
[0:47] it he died a sinner his
[0:52] flesh but I want you to know that it was
[0:55] a big
[0:57] mistake if the enemy thought he had won
[1:01] it was a huge mistake cuz what did Jesus
[1:03] do the Bible said he descended Into the
[1:07] Heart of the Earth or to the lower parts
[1:10] a and what did he do he led captivity
[1:13] captive talk about messing up a prison
[1:16] he took the prison as a
[1:21] prison he took a prison as a prisoner
[1:24] you're now under my control for a few
[1:28] moments the Bible said as he descended
[1:30] Into the Heart of the earth he led
[1:32] captivity captive and what else did he
[1:35] do he gave gifts unto men now that's a
[1:39] powerful transaction that took place in
[1:41] the Realms of Darkness now we have come
[1:44] to understand because we see Jesus in
[1:47] Revelation chapter 19 as a Victorious
[1:50] conquering Lord riding a what a white
[1:54] horse on on the on the girdle The
[1:57] Binding of His Garment he's wearing keys
[2:01] and what were they the keys of death
[2:05] hell and the grave
[2:08] powerful now how in the world did he get
[2:11] the keys of death hell and the grave
[2:15] they didn't fall out of out of the sky
[2:17] he had to go get them imagine that he
[2:21] took the very prison of hell as a
[2:24] prisoner and he took from Satan the keys
[2:28] of death hell and the grave our enemy
[2:32] doesn't even hold the keys to his own
[2:35] front
[2:37] door powerful now he not only did that
[2:41] he made a whistle
[2:43] stop because there was a time under the
[2:46] old Covenant that the that the righteous
[2:48] dead those who died in the instruction
[2:50] those who died in the
[2:52] Torah they were held in A Place Called
[2:56] Paradise because the blood of Jesus had
[2:58] not been shed well now he shed his blood
[3:02] his body is laying in a grave the inner
[3:05] man has descended the body still laying
[3:07] there
[3:08] lifeless the real Jesus the Inner Man
[3:11] the word has now descended Into the
[3:14] Heart of the earth he has not only taken
[3:18] the keys of death hell and the
[3:20] grave and so what this says to us is the
[3:25] devil can't take you to
[3:28] hell if if any body under the sound of
[3:30] my voice goes to hell it's not because
[3:33] Satan took you prisoner and drugg you
[3:35] there he doesn't even have the
[3:37] key he has no Authority in his own
[3:40] house so if you go it's because you made
[3:43] a willful decision to get there Jesus
[3:47] made a way to get you out
