[1:07:10] whatever else your job is your help to
[1:07:14] us well we just appreciate it so much
[1:07:17] and we're just thankful for all that God
[1:07:20] is doing and we don't want to take time
[1:07:22] for a lot you may be seated just a
[1:07:24] moment but prepare to get right back up
[1:07:28] but I feel for you you've been standing
[1:07:30] a lot
[1:07:31] and we'll just uh mention that
[1:07:35] we are very very thankful for God's
[1:07:39] protection just a few days ago
[1:07:43] the Lord was so good to us
[1:07:46] I don't know about you but I like to be
[1:07:48] home when it's storming
[1:07:51] and but the Lord just spoke so sweetly
[1:07:53] to my heart and he said I want you to be
[1:07:55] at the campground during the time of the
[1:07:58] storms and I want you to be praying and
[1:08:00] so that's what I was doing I wanted to
[1:08:04] be at home I really did I I believe that
[1:08:06] this is a very safe place but I wanted
[1:08:08] to be where my family was but his
[1:08:11] presence was so real here
[1:08:13] and the rain came in sheets and waves
[1:08:17] and the winds were blowing and Howling
[1:08:20] and you know really God was so good to
[1:08:22] us because the the worst of the storm
[1:08:24] just stepped over us it just went right
[1:08:27] over us
[1:08:28] hitting Selma and Montgomery and places
[1:08:31] up up Interstate 85 and then right over
[1:08:34] us started at LaGrange 85 Interstate
[1:08:38] went right all the way up to Griffin and
[1:08:41] I don't know did you see the Hobby Lobby
[1:08:43] pictures and Griffin took a wall out
[1:08:46] and uh a big brick building where poor
[1:08:50] children were gathered people are
[1:08:51] gathered for safety took the building
[1:08:53] down not one loss of life there
[1:08:57] and trucks uh just as close to us as the
[1:09:00] Grange 18-wheeler truck turned over on
[1:09:02] the side of the road by the wind and God
[1:09:05] was so good
[1:09:07] he was so good and some loss of lives
[1:09:10] I've heard different numbers I'm not
[1:09:12] sure exactly what the total was and
[1:09:15] those lives are precious
[1:09:17] and uh they they weren't taken by
[1:09:20] accident
[1:09:22] no they their their number the days the
[1:09:25] number of their days had come to an end
[1:09:27] and it was ordained
[1:09:30] oh yes you can have predestination one
[1:09:34] way in sovereignty one way and not have
[1:09:36] it another way it goes all the way
[1:09:38] across the board and you know what I
[1:09:41] appreciate about God's sovereignty so
[1:09:43] much is that uh we don't have to live in
[1:09:47] this cycle of if if he would have had a
[1:09:50] better doctor
[1:09:54] if they'd put him in a different
[1:09:56] hospital
[1:09:58] it just takes all the responsibility All
[1:10:00] For You and I
[1:10:02] and I was just listening this week to
[1:10:04] just a little clip of a service from
[1:10:06] here
[1:10:07] and uh we were talking about that
[1:10:10] terrible tragedy
[1:10:12] that happened when that uh
[1:10:14] was it what was the little girl's name
[1:10:17] Chloe no no it was her sister
[1:10:20] the Reynolds girl Charity Reynolds
[1:10:23] cherish cherish your cherith
[1:10:27] cherish I just happened to to click on a
[1:10:31] service and that I was talking about
[1:10:33] that event when her life was taken so
[1:10:36] quickly
[1:10:37] I heard dad a preacher
[1:10:40] and we were talking about the
[1:10:43] the reality that he had met those girls
[1:10:46] just a few minutes before the accident
[1:10:48] at Walmart
[1:10:51] and the thought comes to our minds I
[1:10:55] know it would any human being you have
[1:10:57] to resist that and push that down what
[1:11:00] if I would have talked to my girls
[1:11:01] another 10 minutes
[1:11:05] what if I would have bought him a
[1:11:06] Coca-Cola
[1:11:09] what if we would have lingered in the
[1:11:10] parking lot but you know what when we
[1:11:13] trust in the sovereignty of God we
[1:11:15] realize that nothing he could have done
[1:11:18] would have changed that event
[1:11:21] now it's hard to think of that when
[1:11:24] you're in the fire
[1:11:26] so embrace it now
[1:11:28] get that in your spirit now so that when
[1:11:32] tragedy comes you can continue in your
[1:11:35] steadfastness that all things work to
[1:11:38] the good of them who love the Lord the
[1:11:42] called according to his purpose so I
[1:11:44] wanted to take a moment and just say
[1:11:45] thank you Lord for watching over our
[1:11:48] homes and our families and and this
[1:11:51] Campground during these storms and you
[1:11:54] know my grandmother was she believed in
[1:11:57] the sovereignty of God I told the kids
[1:12:00] this and they came down there just to oh
[1:12:03] it seemed like a week before was it the
[1:12:06] week before that the sirens were going
[1:12:08] off in the middle of the night
[1:12:10] we had the kids to come down just
[1:12:12] because they're up on a hill uh and we
[1:12:15] didn't want them to be concerned about
[1:12:17] being in a mobile home but I remember as
[1:12:20] a little boy my granddaddy was a worry
[1:12:22] wart and he'd get up in the middle of
[1:12:23] the night and he'd Go Turn All the
[1:12:25] Lights On and he'd get try to get my
[1:12:27] grandmother up and uh he'd say Mildred
[1:12:30] they're going it's going to blow us away
[1:12:33] it's gonna it's gonna blow us away and
[1:12:35] she'd say honey
[1:12:37] uh we're gonna go she said it don't
[1:12:39] matter whether you're laying in the bed
[1:12:41] or under the bed
[1:12:45] oh
[1:12:48] she said if it's our time to go it's not
[1:12:51] going to matter whether you're in a room
[1:12:53] with no windows or you're standing on
[1:12:55] the glass porch
[1:12:57] she said none of that is going to matter
[1:12:59] we trust in a great big God now if you
[1:13:01] don't mind I'm gonna roll over and go
[1:13:03] back to sleep
[1:13:05] and I can hear my granddaddy now he come
[1:13:07] come out of the room and he'd say you
[1:13:09] can't do nothing well holy rollers
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:14] you can because we believe we we believe
[1:13:18] what we believe
[1:13:20] amen tomorrow is sister Anna Christine's
[1:13:23] birthday is that right

[1:14:02] his birthday is on Thursday and he's
[1:14:05] having some physical pain the last bit
[1:14:09] more than than usual and so I would like
[1:14:12] if he should cross your mind especially
[1:14:15] those of you who know him I would very
[1:14:17] much like for you to ask the Lord he is
[1:14:20] he's really the Thomas in the chosen
[1:14:24] he's the one that didn't get the miracle
[1:14:29] they call him big Thomas or little Tom
[1:14:31] not Thomas
[1:14:33] James
[1:14:34] I knew you folks would know
[1:14:38] that's a little extra biblical the story
[1:14:40] but I I really appreciate it because
[1:14:43] there are a lot of those little James's
[1:14:45] out there
[1:14:46] who didn't get can you imagine riding in
[1:14:48] a vehicle with God's Prophet who had
[1:14:51] prayed for hundreds of thousands of
[1:14:53] people who had been healed and brother
[1:14:56] Bobby's brother saying to to Bobby Bobby
[1:14:59] why don't you ask brother Brandon why
[1:15:00] don't you ask brother Branham
[1:15:03] brother Branham asked him what it was
[1:15:05] and he talked about his leg that was
[1:15:07] crippled with polio
[1:15:09] and uh brother Branham said if you had
[1:15:13] two good legs you you'd go you'd never
[1:15:15] would stop
[1:15:17] you'd go all the time
[1:15:19] all things happen for a reason
[1:15:25] he didn't lose his faith in God or the
[1:15:28] truth or the prophet or or the ministry
[1:15:31] because he saw people healed himself
[1:15:34] before that and after that he just
[1:15:37] accepted it for a reason
[1:15:39] and I've heard him say recently even if
[1:15:43] I would have had good legs and no pain
[1:15:45] and complete health I might not would be
[1:15:47] here today
[1:15:48] I might would be living a different life
[1:15:51] not even serving God
[1:15:54] but I'm where I am today by The
[1:15:56] Sovereign Grace of God folks we've got a
[1:16:00] lot to be thankful for
[1:16:02] amen would you stand if I missed your
[1:16:05] event it wasn't on purpose
[1:16:07] all of you who are streaming the service
[1:16:11] I just want to say that we are thankful
[1:16:14] for every person who comes and visits us
[1:16:16] but our brother here who has come all
[1:16:19] the way from Kentucky to be with us
[1:16:20] today and how many of you like a visitor
[1:16:23] that comes and sits on the front row
[1:16:26] I like that
[1:16:29] he's not scared of us
[1:16:31] and I appreciate that brother God bless
[1:16:33] you for being here today second
[1:16:35] Corinthians chapter 10
[1:16:38] I want to read some verses to you there
[1:16:41] and we are taking just a slight step
[1:16:44] away from where we have been preaching a
[1:16:48] series that we've been preaching on the
[1:16:50] throne of grace
[1:16:52] we'll come back to that
[1:16:55] but the Lord is spoken to us here
[1:16:59] prophetically that we are to expect
[1:17:02] Supernatural this year 2023
[1:17:06] and so we want to get a good
[1:17:08] understanding of what Supernatural is
[1:17:11] and when I was here in the service last
[1:17:14] Sunday I knew how the Lord was already
[1:17:16] directing my thoughts and I want to just
[1:17:19] bring a lesson or two on this subject
[1:17:22] beginning this morning second
[1:17:24] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 through 5
[1:17:27] says for though we walk in the flesh
[1:17:31] we do not war after the flesh for the
[1:17:36] weapons of our Warfare are
[1:17:39] not carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:17:44] pulling down of strong holes
[1:17:49] nothing could be more Supernatural than
[1:17:53] seeing strongholds
[1:17:55] brought down
[1:17:58] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:18:04] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:18:08] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:18:11] captivity
[1:18:16] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:18:21] the original Greek
[1:18:24] would read like this taking prisoner
[1:18:28] every thought
[1:18:30] and you and I must do that this morning
[1:18:32] and again this afternoon and tomorrow
[1:18:35] and the next day
[1:18:37] now could we look at Hebrews 11 verse 1
[1:18:40] and 2.
[1:18:43] it says now Faith is the substance of
[1:18:47] things hoped for
[1:18:49] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:18:54] and for by it the elders
[1:18:57] obtained a good report
[1:19:00] what an introduction to the chapter of
[1:19:05] Faith the Hall of Faith Hebrews chapter
[1:19:08] 11.
[1:19:10] and then I would like to go to Second
[1:19:12] Corinthians I know you're standing
[1:19:15] chapter 12 verse 5 verses
[1:19:20] it is not expedient for me doubtless to
[1:19:23] Glory
[1:19:24] I will come to visions and Revelations
[1:19:28] of the Lord let me remind you that these
[1:19:33] are the words of the first church age
[1:19:35] messenger the Apostle Paul
[1:19:38] he goes on in verse two I knew a man in
[1:19:42] Christ above 14 years ago whether in the
[1:19:47] body I cannot tell or whether out of the
[1:19:49] body I cannot tell God knoweth such and
[1:19:53] one caught up
[1:19:55] to the third heaven
[1:19:58] and I knew such a man whether in body or
[1:20:01] out of the body I cannot tell God
[1:20:03] knoweth
[1:20:04] how that he was caught up into Paradise
[1:20:09] and heard unspeakable Words which it is
[1:20:13] not lawful for a man to utter
[1:20:18] of such and one will I Glory yet of
[1:20:21] myself I will not Glory but in mine
[1:20:25] infirmities
[1:20:27] the apostle was taking himself out of
[1:20:30] the scenario
[1:20:32] and he was speaking of his own
[1:20:34] experience but he was doing it in a way
[1:20:38] that would not bring Glory or attention
[1:20:40] to himself it's not us running around I
[1:20:44] had a dream I had a vision I had an
[1:20:47] experience
[1:20:48] it's what God is doing and what he is
[1:20:51] accomplishing for his glory if God gives
[1:20:55] you that don't deny it
[1:20:57] if he gives you a vision you own it
[1:21:00] don't you be ashamed of it it should be
[1:21:04] happening in our lives can anybody say
[1:21:06] Amen now let's finish our reading today
[1:21:10] in mark 16.
[1:21:12] verses 17 through 20. and these signs
[1:21:17] shall follow them that believe
[1:21:21] in my name
[1:21:24] shall they cast out devils
[1:21:28] they shall
[1:21:30] speak with new tongues
[1:21:33] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:21:37] drink any
[1:21:42] hurt them
[1:21:44] they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:21:48] and they shall recover
[1:21:52] so then after the Lord had spoken unto
[1:21:55] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:21:57] sat on the right hand of God which is
[1:22:00] the right hand of power and authority
[1:22:03] now listen to what they did and they
[1:22:06] went forth and preached everywhere the
[1:22:10] Lord working with them and confirming
[1:22:13] the word with signs following
[1:22:17] notice God is Not confirming the
[1:22:20] apostles he's not confirming the
[1:22:23] preachers he's not even confirming the
[1:22:26] prophets he is confirming his word and
[1:22:32] when his word is confirmed it is
[1:22:35] confirmed with signs following now that
[1:22:39] is Supernatural and we've got something
[1:22:42] to thank God for father thank you this
[1:22:45] morning for your great grace among us
[1:22:48] thank you for the living reality of your
[1:22:52] word thank you that we're not just
[1:22:54] reading about what you what you could do
[1:22:57] or what you might have done but we're
[1:23:00] reading about a God who is Ever present
[1:23:03] and ever more able to meet our needs
[1:23:06] today you are truly without a doubt
[1:23:09] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:23:12] today and forever you change not if you
[1:23:16] ever were Supernatural God you are a
[1:23:20] supernatural God today and we are
[1:23:22] submitting Our Lives to you to your
[1:23:26] sovereignty we are thanking you for your
[1:23:29] faithfulness to the children of men we
[1:23:32] take authority over every spirit and
[1:23:35] every principality that opposes the
[1:23:38] supernatural Gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:41] Christ and we rebuke and resist their
[1:23:44] influence and we ask that by the power
[1:23:47] of the Holy Spirit you would come today
[1:23:50] and you would confirm your word even
[1:23:53] Among Us with signs following and we
[1:23:57] will give you praise and honor and glory
[1:24:00] for it's in the lovely name of the Lord
[1:24:02] Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said
[1:24:06] amen you may be seated
[1:24:10] we are serving a supernatural God
[1:24:16] he is a supernatural God I want to read
[1:24:21] to you this morning just a little
[1:24:24] sentence from the message God
[1:24:27] identifying himself by his
[1:24:30] characteristics I think the title is
[1:24:33] powerful I think the title is Anointed
[1:24:36] but in this little message brother
[1:24:38] Branham said now again God's
[1:24:41] characteristic is always
[1:24:45] Supernatural why because he is
[1:24:50] Supernatural God is Supernatural now I
[1:24:55] want to Define supernatural the word
[1:24:58] Supernatural means it is above
[1:25:02] above and beyond the natural so anything
[1:25:08] that God does above the natural
[1:25:12] anything that God does beyond the
[1:25:15] natural is Supernatural I want you to
[1:25:19] know there is there is a vast universe
[1:25:24] of what God can do out there that we
[1:25:27] don't fully understand in our little in
[1:25:30] our little world where we're living I
[1:25:33] want you to know God is not limited by
[1:25:35] anything but truth
[1:25:38] and and he is able to do whatever he
[1:25:42] needs to do he can defy even the laws
[1:25:46] that he set in place in nature
[1:25:50] how many of you believe that
[1:25:52] gravity is in God's control
[1:25:55] and the rotation of the earth and all
[1:25:58] that we understand in the universe is
[1:26:00] all in God's control if he wants to make
[1:26:03] iron swim
[1:26:06] he doesn't have to grunt to do it
[1:26:09] he doesn't have to strain to make iron
[1:26:12] swim if he wants the dead to live he
[1:26:15] doesn't have to work up the faith
[1:26:19] if he wants the blind to see and the
[1:26:21] death to hear and the dumb to talk
[1:26:25] if he wants the dumb to shut up
[1:26:30] he doesn't have to work hard to make it
[1:26:33] happen
[1:26:34] he's God he's God Supernatural he's
[1:26:37] God's Sovereign he's God's Supreme now I
[1:26:41] want you to know right now from the
[1:26:43] get-go he's called you a supernatural
[1:26:46] people
[1:26:48] and that means that you and I are also
[1:26:51] to be able to do above
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:56] and Beyond what looks like natural
[1:27:00] the church at large has settled for
[1:27:05] natural
[1:27:06] many around the message of the hour have
[1:27:10] settled for natural but you must
[1:27:13] understand that God he's not going to
[1:27:16] have he has a supernatural people he has
[1:27:21] he always has he always will because
[1:27:25] he's a supernatural God
[1:27:27] nothing limits him
[1:27:30] nothing constrains him someone said well
[1:27:34] well doubt can certainly do that in your
[1:27:37] situation
[1:27:38] in your circumstance you can limit God
[1:27:42] in how he effectively moves for you but
[1:27:46] you can't limit how he moves for me
[1:27:49] come on I'm putting my faith in there
[1:27:51] and recognizing who he is and what he
[1:27:54] does in the next little sentence here in
[1:27:58] a message called a greater than Solomon
[1:28:01] is here brother Branham said in
[1:28:03] paragraph 46 God always in every age
[1:28:08] in every age
[1:28:10] dealt with man
[1:28:12] how
[1:28:14] through signs
[1:28:17] you know I love the way they quote this
[1:28:19] I love the way they say oh yeah they're
[1:28:22] just like the Jews
[1:28:24] they finally know a scripture
[1:28:28] they say oh they're just like Jews down
[1:28:30] there always looking for a sign
[1:28:34] you've got to understand I'm not looking
[1:28:36] for a sign
[1:28:38] I'm not following a sign I'm not chasing
[1:28:42] after a sign I read what the book said
[1:28:45] these signs shall follow them that
[1:28:49] believe
[1:28:50] my belief
[1:28:52] my belief my faith is tested by the
[1:28:57] supernatural
[1:29:00] that's how I know I have a supernatural
[1:29:03] Faith because I see God moving
[1:29:06] in a supernatural way
[1:29:08] come on now
[1:29:10] oh we could stand here all day all night
[1:29:14] and two or three more days reading the
[1:29:16] things that brother Branham has said
[1:29:18] about how the Supernatural is to be
[1:29:20] present in our everyday life I have to
[1:29:24] believe it's there I believe that
[1:29:26] sometimes we step over it we look over
[1:29:29] it we don't see it but he's there
[1:29:33] times that we come along on a car
[1:29:36] accident and we say all those poor
[1:29:39] people never realizing that you spilled
[1:29:43] your coffee
[1:29:45] you had to go back and clean off your
[1:29:47] clothes or change your shirt or do
[1:29:49] something like that and and if not you
[1:29:52] would have been right there in the
[1:29:53] middle of that that's a supernatural God
[1:29:56] looking out for a supernatural people
[1:29:59] so if you look at it that way you'll
[1:30:01] never run out of things to praise him
[1:30:03] for you'll never run out of things to
[1:30:06] glorify God for or shout about
[1:30:10] because he's always moving around us in
[1:30:14] a supernatural way
[1:30:16] I believe that uh Wednesday evening of
[1:30:20] this week we were streaming in our home
[1:30:24] the first night of Harmony in the desert
[1:30:28] the first year in six years not counting
[1:30:33] coveted year that we have not been there
[1:30:37] as a family together and we were
[1:30:40] streaming it there and they were they
[1:30:43] always hear a tape on the first night
[1:30:46] bringing people together by the word
[1:30:48] which is a very good idea because you're
[1:30:51] going to sing several spend several days
[1:30:53] singing and that's a wonderful thing to
[1:30:56] do but it's always good to bring the
[1:30:58] people's attention to what brings us
[1:31:01] together when we're there it's the word
[1:31:03] that's what brings you and I together
[1:31:05] that's what makes us a family it's the
[1:31:09] word among us that's the attraction
[1:31:12] it must be
[1:31:14] and we were not only listening to the
[1:31:18] comments and the announcements and the
[1:31:20] introductions but we stayed I stayed and
[1:31:23] listened to the tape it was the tape
[1:31:26] expectations it was preached in that
[1:31:30] very church the church that is now
[1:31:33] Tucson Tabernacle was Once Upon a Time
[1:31:36] Grant Avenue Assembly of God brother
[1:31:39] Branham was invited it was his first
[1:31:42] sermon in Tucson he was invited to
[1:31:46] preach there and one of the brothers had
[1:31:50] actually laid the foundation step for
[1:31:53] that church there were several families
[1:31:56] that were living in Tucson attending the
[1:31:59] Assembly of God Church while following
[1:32:02] the ministry of brother Branham they had
[1:32:04] no church to fellowship with so in that
[1:32:07] hour it was safe for them to Fellowship
[1:32:09] there and as they're nailing the step
[1:32:12] and working on it the brother was
[1:32:14] praying Lord I want you to make a way
[1:32:16] for that prophet of God to step across
[1:32:19] this threshold and preach in this church
[1:32:22] and I'm sitting there knowing that and
[1:32:25] I'm sitting there listening to this tape
[1:32:27] and what was the message
[1:32:29] expectations if God is saying to us you
[1:32:34] should watch and recognize the
[1:32:37] supernatural among you I'm going to move
[1:32:39] among you in Supernatural ways in 2023
[1:32:44] then you and I have to work today on our
[1:32:47] expectation
[1:32:49] we have to raise the level of our
[1:32:52] expectation and we must recognize that
[1:32:55] anything is possible when God is moving
[1:32:59] in our lives
[1:33:01] what makes a service a powerful service
[1:33:03] is when you and I come together with our
[1:33:06] licks of fire and we're not rubbing our
[1:33:09] wounds and licking our wounds for all
[1:33:11] that we've been through this week we're
[1:33:14] laying all of our troubles down we're
[1:33:16] putting our problems aside and we're
[1:33:19] lifting up a praise to a faithful God
[1:33:22] that creates an atmosphere where Faith
[1:33:25] begins to boil
[1:33:29] and you don't even have to have hands
[1:33:31] laid on you all you have to do is say
[1:33:35] it's mine healing is mine Deliverance is
[1:33:39] mine the victory is mine
[1:33:42] [Applause]
[1:33:44] I don't know how many songs we sung this
[1:33:48] morning with the word victory in it but
[1:33:51] there were several of them he is our
[1:33:54] Victory the Victory Is Ours somebody
[1:33:57] said well I don't feel very Victorious
[1:34:01] uh
[1:34:03] what's feelings Got to Do with It
[1:34:06] I don't want to hurt your feelings but
[1:34:08] nobody cares what you're feeling
[1:34:15] let me tell you what sister Megan Kino
[1:34:17] said she said I'm not going to be able
[1:34:19] to be there today brother Shelley
[1:34:21] she needs prayer and she said this
[1:34:24] probably twofold she said it's all in my
[1:34:27] head
[1:34:30] you remember a sermon I preached one
[1:34:32] time it's all in your head
[1:34:34] you want to make people mad
[1:34:37] when they have spent 30 minutes telling
[1:34:39] you how rough and terrible and awful
[1:34:41] their life is and you just look at them
[1:34:43] this is my style
[1:34:45] and you just look at them and say well
[1:34:46] it's all in your head
[1:34:50] you talk about church folks wanting to
[1:34:52] cuss they'll have that
[1:34:55] look at your man that's all in my head
[1:34:58] the truth is
[1:35:00] a whole lot of it if not all of it it's
[1:35:04] what we worked ourselves up into
[1:35:08] people will come to me and ask me to
[1:35:11] pray and then tell me after I'm praying
[1:35:13] how worried they are
[1:35:17] well why don't you just go worry and
[1:35:19] don't bother me to pray you just go
[1:35:22] worry a solution see if worrying is
[1:35:24] going to make a difference but if you
[1:35:26] decide to pray you've got to stop that
[1:35:29] worrying you've got to make up your mind
[1:35:33] whatever comes
[1:35:36] life or death God is good
[1:35:41] whatever happens on my job God is good
[1:35:47] Hallelujah
[1:35:50] I was listening to the testimony
[1:35:53] service that took place on Thursday
[1:35:55] morning during Harmony
[1:35:58] brother
[1:36:00] sister Anna Miller's dad brother Forrest
[1:36:02] farmer was giving his testimony of how
[1:36:06] his dad
[1:36:08] went there with this attitude here
[1:36:11] brother Forrest had his crippled feet
[1:36:13] and his dad went there with attitude I'm
[1:36:16] going to see if this is real I'm going
[1:36:18] to see if he's shotgunning because there
[1:36:21] were a lot of men on the scene you know
[1:36:23] when you shoot if when you fire a
[1:36:25] shotgun it spreads those little pellets
[1:36:28] in all directions
[1:36:29] and there were preachers in those days
[1:36:31] just speaking very general words that
[1:36:34] could apply to anybody and I don't want
[1:36:36] to criticize that because God heals
[1:36:38] people under those kinds of things
[1:36:41] but if a man is going to be a prophet
[1:36:43] then brother Forrest Farmer's Daddy he
[1:36:46] had the attitude he's going to have to
[1:36:48] be a little more than just
[1:36:51] so wonder what he thought we know what
[1:36:53] he thought we've heard the testimony
[1:36:55] when brother Branham looked right up in
[1:36:57] the crowd
[1:36:58] and called his name Mr farmer
[1:37:00] told him about the little boy that was
[1:37:02] down behind in front of him there with
[1:37:04] crippled feet now I'm telling you you
[1:37:07] you can't call that a shotgun that was
[1:37:10] gun barrel sniper straight wasn't it
[1:37:13] that was Supernatural
[1:37:15] God's a supernatural God and then
[1:37:18] brother minnow Friesen who has turned 80
[1:37:20] years old and has finally retired as the
[1:37:23] pastor and his son-in-law is pastoring
[1:37:25] the church he give a little testimony
[1:37:27] and they were in brother branham's
[1:37:29] meetings and particularly there for the
[1:37:32] series on marriage and divorce and and
[1:37:34] he quoted a scripture that we all know
[1:37:37] but it is nothing but the truth he said
[1:37:40] like David I am an old man
[1:37:44] and I have never seen
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:37:49] I have never seen the righteous
[1:37:54] see no 13 year old boy up there telling
[1:37:57] us that here's a man 80 years old lived
[1:38:01] his life for the truth I tell you it
[1:38:04] means something when he quotes a
[1:38:05] scripture like that I'm an old man he
[1:38:08] said and I have never seen the righteous
[1:38:11] forsaken nor God's seed beckoned for
[1:38:15] bread brother sister there's nothing
[1:38:18] that's nothing but the truth
[1:38:20] so you ask God to deliver you from that
[1:38:23] Spirit of a worry wart and you
[1:38:26] understand that God is a supernatural
[1:38:30] God he's going to provide a pillow for
[1:38:33] your head he's going to provide a meal
[1:38:36] for your body and for your family there
[1:38:39] are going to be shoes on your children's
[1:38:41] feet
[1:38:43] I don't care what the doctor says
[1:38:47] I want to confess something
[1:38:50] I got the same
[1:38:52] text that brother Greeley got this
[1:38:54] morning about praying for crystalline
[1:38:57] and her babies Michael sent us a text
[1:39:00] and
[1:39:01] it's already started it always does it
[1:39:04] always will
[1:39:06] the doctors are always covering
[1:39:08] theirselves
[1:39:09] [Music]
[1:39:13] they tried that on us
[1:39:15] they're just trying to I don't I'm not
[1:39:17] against it
[1:39:18] they don't want to be sued
[1:39:21] they they want to cover all their bases
[1:39:23] and so someday I'll start telling you
[1:39:26] all the things that can be wrong
[1:39:29] well I got the devil for that
[1:39:32] I don't have to pay somebody to tell me
[1:39:34] all them things
[1:39:35] you better let it go in one ear and out
[1:39:38] the other here
[1:39:39] I said to brother Greeley when you
[1:39:41] request prayer would you don't mention
[1:39:43] that
[1:39:45] don't mention that because we don't need
[1:39:47] to strike fear in anybody's heart
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:53] I'm going to be honest with you this
[1:39:54] morning I can't tell you how many babies
[1:39:56] are going to be born at the end of this
[1:39:58] I don't have that answer from the Lord
[1:40:00] but here's what I know the devil won't
[1:40:03] take any of them
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:07] foreign
[1:40:09] he cannot
[1:40:11] he cannot he only has the power that you
[1:40:15] allow him to have he only has the power
[1:40:18] that God grants him as permission
[1:40:22] and so I'm going to use my faith in an
[1:40:24] entirely different way and I'm going to
[1:40:27] decree and declare what I believe to be
[1:40:30] the truth
[1:40:32] that God will give them health
[1:40:35] that they will be exactly the size
[1:40:38] they're supposed to be
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:42] fully functional
[1:40:45] I'm going to speak what I believe is
[1:40:47] right
[1:40:48] and I'm going to put my trust in the
[1:40:50] Lord
[1:40:52] he took our
[1:40:54] little Benjamin
[1:40:56] over to the pediatrician
[1:40:59] and they had told us you know we're
[1:41:00] going to have to turn you in we're going
[1:41:03] to have to report you because
[1:41:05] pretty much you don't do everything we
[1:41:07] tell you to do and believe everything
[1:41:08] that we tell you to believe
[1:41:11] and our insurance won't cover us
[1:41:13] so you're we're going to have to turn
[1:41:15] you in and tell you we
[1:41:17] went home a few hours early from the
[1:41:20] hospital they said we're going to turn
[1:41:21] you into Family Services
[1:41:27] you can't get worked up
[1:41:29] you just have to roll
[1:41:32] we took him over there to my wife is
[1:41:34] Canadian so I'm not against Canadians
[1:41:37] but we took him over there to a Canadian
[1:41:39] pediatrician
[1:41:41] Dr so and so
[1:41:43] and he say look down he's done treated
[1:41:46] him and he's seen him a couple times he
[1:41:47] looks down at him and he says hmm
[1:41:51] his eye whites are kind of Gray
[1:41:57] we're just young parents
[1:42:00] we're just sitting there all relaxed
[1:42:01] until he says that and then we go
[1:42:06] we've seen him every day we never knew
[1:42:09] he had gray eyes
[1:42:12] we feel like rotten sorry parents I
[1:42:16] didn't know I had great did you know he
[1:42:17] had gray eye did you no I didn't know
[1:42:21] and we said to the doctor well what does
[1:42:23] that mean
[1:42:25] and he had no no tact he had no bedside
[1:42:28] manner at all
[1:42:31] should have started off with a little
[1:42:33] stuff
[1:42:35] no he looked right at me and he said
[1:42:36] well it could mean that he has brittle
[1:42:39] bone disease
[1:42:44] foreign
[1:42:50] we go out of there and I'm praying Lord
[1:42:53] I pay my tithes oh God I tried to do
[1:42:57] what's right I live good to the best of
[1:43:00] oh forgive me Lord I did say so and so
[1:43:04] I'm trying to get everything right
[1:43:06] because I don't want my bored child to
[1:43:09] have brittle bone disease
[1:43:13] so my wife said we've got to take him
[1:43:15] back in a few weeks so I said well I'm
[1:43:17] going with you you're not going by
[1:43:18] yourself
[1:43:19] bracing ourselves
[1:43:33] I said what about the gray of his eyes
[1:43:35] he said oh I said you said that it might
[1:43:39] mean that he has are we going to do some
[1:43:41] tests he said no it it could mean that
[1:43:44] he has brittle bone disease or it could
[1:43:46] mean nothing at all
[1:43:55] so he said I think it this probably
[1:43:56] means nothing at all
[1:44:01] now you know what I tell you what I'd
[1:44:03] like to go
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:10] it's of our ability
[1:44:12] because he tried to aided me no harm but
[1:44:15] the enemy tried to use him to strike a
[1:44:18] fear
[1:44:19] and you may not believe what I'm telling
[1:44:21] you but I know what fear can do it
[1:44:23] becomes a magnet
[1:44:26] fear draws disease fear draws problems
[1:44:32] to your life
[1:44:34] the little booklet that they handed out
[1:44:37] in the Branham campaigns do you fear
[1:44:42] cancer
[1:44:45] if you let fear take a hold of your life
[1:44:50] every symptom you have you will run to
[1:44:54] Dr Google
[1:44:56] [Music]
[1:44:58] how many have been there this week to Dr
[1:45:01] Google
[1:45:09] you don't know he is not reputable
[1:45:13] Dr Google works for the drug companies
[1:45:17] [Applause]
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] Dr Google was for the devil
[1:45:25] devil you want to about anybody on Dr
[1:45:28] Google
[1:45:29] you can have a little slight problem and
[1:45:33] go look and the next thing you know
[1:45:35] you're sure you have stomach cancer
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:42] may I just be very plain I'm going to
[1:45:44] step over here just because you're
[1:45:46] constipated doesn't mean you have
[1:45:48] stomach cancer
[1:45:50] you cannot believe everything you read
[1:45:53] your trust has to be in the Lord
[1:45:56] [Applause]
[1:45:59] someone called and said did you know
[1:46:02] that that there might have not been as
[1:46:04] many as brother Branham said that fell
[1:46:07] off the bridge
[1:46:09] I said well how did you know that were
[1:46:12] you there
[1:46:14] no I wasn't there I Googled it
[1:46:20] I said sin that's right Google wasn't
[1:46:22] there I said send me the article and
[1:46:26] they sent me a Wikipedia article
[1:46:30] did you know people
[1:46:32] Wikipedia
[1:46:35] competed on there anything I want to put
[1:46:37] on there
[1:46:39] and even the person themselves has a
[1:46:42] hard time getting it off of there once
[1:46:44] it's approved
[1:46:45] so you can read anything you want to out
[1:46:48] there you will be a nervous wreck you
[1:46:51] will plan your children's funeral
[1:46:55] you'll see an attorney
[1:46:57] you'll take everything the doctor gives
[1:46:59] you to take if your source of Truth
[1:47:03] is the World Wide Web but you get an
[1:47:07] anchor in the word of God and you begin
[1:47:10] to realize that we serve a supernatural
[1:47:14] God who is bigger
[1:47:17] he's bigger than gray eyes
[1:47:24] you've seen you see him up there jumping
[1:47:27] around bouncing around I've seen him on
[1:47:30] the softball field I've seen him doing
[1:47:32] all kinds of things doing this and that
[1:47:34] and the other the gym he don't have any
[1:47:36] brittle bone disease
[1:47:39] thank you
[1:47:42] this is just how the enemy works
[1:47:48] he'll tell you you're going to lose your
[1:47:50] children he'll tell you you're going to
[1:47:52] this that and the other
[1:47:55] come on
[1:47:56] we serve a supernatural God
[1:48:00] I want to read Ephesians 3. we're not
[1:48:04] getting very far
[1:48:05] 19 and 20 but maybe God will speak to us
[1:48:08] in the simple
[1:48:11] and to know the love of Christ
[1:48:14] which passeth the knowledge
[1:48:16] that you might be filled with all the
[1:48:21] fullness of God does that sound good to
[1:48:23] anybody
[1:48:24] to be filled with all the fullness of
[1:48:27] God and to know the love of Christ
[1:48:30] which passeth knowledge that you might
[1:48:33] be filled with all the fullness of God
[1:48:36] verse 20. now unto him that is able
[1:48:41] now unto him that is able
[1:48:44] to do exceeding
[1:48:49] I know I always put a a a exceedingly on
[1:48:54] there but but we've just quoted the way
[1:48:57] we heard it
[1:48:58] I don't think exceeding and exceedingly
[1:49:01] is going to going to throw us off here
[1:49:02] but let's say it just like the word said
[1:49:04] it now unto him that is able to do
[1:49:06] exceeding
[1:49:07] abundantly above
[1:49:11] oh
[1:49:13] that's a supernatural God
[1:49:16] that's a God that can make the iron
[1:49:18] float that's a God that could cause the
[1:49:21] sun to stand still
[1:49:22] that's a God that can create today just
[1:49:26] like he created in the beginning by the
[1:49:29] power of the spoken word he's still a
[1:49:31] creator
[1:49:33] I received a promise from the Lord some
[1:49:35] years ago that he was going to give new
[1:49:38] organs
[1:49:41] that people weren't just going to have
[1:49:43] healed Hearts they would have new Hearts
[1:49:45] they weren't just going to have better
[1:49:47] livers they were going to have new
[1:49:48] livers
[1:49:50] somebody said I don't know about that it
[1:49:52] doesn't matter whether you know about it
[1:49:54] or not the God who made the first liver
[1:49:56] knows how to give you another liver The
[1:50:00] God Who made the first heart is able to
[1:50:03] give you another heart
[1:50:05] according to your faith be it done unto
[1:50:08] you
[1:50:09] don't you let the enemy sign your death
[1:50:11] certificate prematurely
[1:50:14] you stand on the promise of God he who
[1:50:17] is able to do exceeding abundantly above
[1:50:20] that
[1:50:22] we ask all above all that we ask
[1:50:30] what I asked for may be differently than
[1:50:33] what I think I need
[1:50:35] you know sometimes we think big and we
[1:50:38] ask small
[1:50:40] that's why brother Branham taught us you
[1:50:42] should ask abundantly
[1:50:44] remember he said you ask abundantly you
[1:50:47] think abundantly well ask abundantly
[1:50:49] he's able to give us a exceeding
[1:50:53] abundant above all that we ask or think
[1:50:55] according
[1:50:56] to the power
[1:51:01] that does what brother Holston that
[1:51:04] worketh in US
[1:51:06] that Supernatural power of the
[1:51:09] supernatural God working inside of us
[1:51:15] now we've been blessed
[1:51:18] we've been blessed in our day
[1:51:20] I want to read two paragraphs from the
[1:51:22] message the voice of God in this last
[1:51:24] days
[1:51:25] and I want to I want to say before I
[1:51:28] read them I do not believe that God has
[1:51:31] lost his voice I do not believe that he
[1:51:34] has laryngitis
[1:51:37] I don't believe that brother Branham
[1:51:39] quits that God quit speaking when
[1:51:41] brother Branham passed away
[1:51:43] he'll speak to you if you'll shut up and
[1:51:46] listen
[1:51:48] he'll speak to your heart he won't tell
[1:51:51] you anything contrary to his word but
[1:51:55] he'll talk to you how many of you
[1:51:56] believe he's still a walking talking God
[1:52:00] but I want you to know that one of the
[1:52:02] ways he vindicates that it's his voice
[1:52:04] talking is with Supernatural
[1:52:08] and this is explained for us in this
[1:52:10] message the voice of God in this last
[1:52:12] days paragraph 31. he said there are so
[1:52:14] many voices in the Earth today
[1:52:17] and how many of you know if that was
[1:52:19] true in 63 it's even more true in 2023
[1:52:24] because of Dr Google
[1:52:27] there is so many voices in the Earth
[1:52:29] today that it is absolutely a hard thing
[1:52:32] because it deadens
[1:52:35] The Voice
[1:52:37] of the supernatural there are so many
[1:52:41] natural voices
[1:52:43] that we become deafened at times
[1:52:47] to the supernatural voice
[1:52:50] he said there is so many intellectual
[1:52:52] voices great voices of mighty men who
[1:52:57] are intellectual that in their
[1:52:59] intellectual conditions even shake the
[1:53:02] Nations
[1:53:04] he goes on
[1:53:06] they're just one they're they're just
[1:53:08] not overnight people but they Shake
[1:53:11] Nations bringing great organizations
[1:53:13] together great campaigns flowerly and a
[1:53:18] person would be a bit confused it's
[1:53:21] enough to confuse them of how that these
[1:53:23] things go on and prosper and they do
[1:53:27] even today
[1:53:29] and there's voices that raise up and do
[1:53:32] all these things and it causes the voice
[1:53:35] of God to be placed way back somewhere
[1:53:40] the true voice of God
[1:53:45] are you with me
[1:53:46] and then he goes on and the voice of God
[1:53:50] they say how will we know it's the voice
[1:53:53] of God
[1:53:54] because for today then it was in a
[1:53:57] Vindicated Prophet now today how we know
[1:54:01] it's the voice of God because it's the
[1:54:04] manifestation oh
[1:54:08] oh Hallelujah because it's the
[1:54:11] manifestation of the prophet's word
[1:54:18] I don't know if you're catching that or
[1:54:20] not
[1:54:21] go back and let's look at that again
[1:54:25] he said now today how do we know how we
[1:54:28] know it's the voice of God because it's
[1:54:30] the manifestation of the prophet's word
[1:54:33] I think people have forgotten what
[1:54:35] brother random said was going to be
[1:54:37] going on in the last day bride
[1:54:39] I think they got so excited about their
[1:54:42] little stirrings that they had in the
[1:54:44] 60s
[1:54:47] when they started declaring this is the
[1:54:50] bride's Revival this is the bride's
[1:54:52] Revival they got so excited about it
[1:54:54] back then as they began to identify what
[1:54:57] they thought the Thunders were they got
[1:54:59] so excited about what was going on it's
[1:55:02] almost as though they believe that it's
[1:55:04] finished but I want you to know it's not
[1:55:07] finished at all it's gaining momentum
[1:55:10] because the prophet tells us it will and
[1:55:13] just before the Rapture he tells us
[1:55:15] there will be a mighty moving of the
[1:55:19] holy ghost power of God in the last day
[1:55:22] bride of Jesus Christ a quick short work
[1:55:26] he calls it he calls it the
[1:55:29] manifestation of the sons of God he
[1:55:32] calls it the full adoption of the sons
[1:55:35] of God he calls him the fullness of the
[1:55:39] third pole he calls it the bride's
[1:55:42] Revival
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:45] he described how it would look
[1:55:49] he said there will be ananiases and
[1:55:52] sapphiras
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:55:56] and a few of them
[1:55:58] now you that have been around this thing
[1:56:00] since the 50s and 60s have you seen very
[1:56:03] many
[1:56:07] have you been in Services where someone
[1:56:10] had lied to the Holy Ghost and they felt
[1:56:12] dead in the church not very often
[1:56:18] we saw brother way
[1:56:20] I wasn't there but I know many people
[1:56:23] that were there
[1:56:24] and he had a little attitude in his
[1:56:26] heart toward brother Branham when
[1:56:27] brother Brandon was preaching
[1:56:30] he spoke about brother way having a
[1:56:32] complex which it's obvious that he did
[1:56:37] because he turns to his wife and he says
[1:56:40] I resent that
[1:56:47] and it wasn't long and let me tell you
[1:56:49] something brother Edmund way was a
[1:56:51] believer
[1:56:52] and they can say anything they want to
[1:56:55] him want to about him but I'm in Israel
[1:56:58] in 2003.
[1:57:01] and I'm preaching Jesus name baptism in
[1:57:05] Jerusalem in 2003 and a woman a little
[1:57:09] woman sister
[1:57:10] Emmy
[1:57:13] walks up to me and she said brother
[1:57:16] Shelley I've been baptized in the name
[1:57:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:21] and I know who brother Branham is
[1:57:25] and I said you do she said I do because
[1:57:28] a man named Edmund way and his wife came
[1:57:32] here and told us
[1:57:36] and I've followed them down to the river
[1:57:38] and was baptized
[1:57:40] so he was a believer
[1:57:43] but he didn't appreciate his
[1:57:45] complex being spoken about
[1:57:48] remember brother Brandon preaches and he
[1:57:51] says to the people I have developed a
[1:57:53] bit of a complex
[1:57:57] you didn't know he said it
[1:57:59] shall I pull out the 17 quotes where he
[1:58:02] talks about his complex
[1:58:05] it's very very common that you and I can
[1:58:09] pick up a complex
[1:58:11] and when we do it will hinder us
[1:58:14] from being who God called us to be but
[1:58:17] he identified that for brother away and
[1:58:19] by the way he said I resent that and it
[1:58:21] wasn't long before brother Wade has a
[1:58:23] heart attack and is on the floor
[1:58:25] and his wife a registered nurse reaches
[1:58:28] down for a pulse and pronounces him dead
[1:58:31] here's one of the most powerful things
[1:58:33] of the whole event brother Branham never
[1:58:36] got excited
[1:58:43] if it would have been us somebody would
[1:58:46] have been screaming call 911
[1:58:52] service canceled and the whole thing
[1:58:55] shifted in chained but brother random
[1:58:57] just when did exactly what needed to be
[1:58:59] done walks right back up to the pulpit
[1:59:01] and takes the service and goes on
[1:59:04] uh
[1:59:05] he goes on finishes his sermon
[1:59:08] he goes and finishes his preaching why
[1:59:10] because he knew that God was a
[1:59:12] supernatural God
[1:59:14] his confidence wasn't in his gift his
[1:59:17] confidence was in his God
[1:59:19] he had no reason to allow the devil to
[1:59:22] interrupt or disturb a service let's
[1:59:24] just get to manage life back and go on
[1:59:27] we're a supernatural people following a
[1:59:30] supernatural God has anybody got a
[1:59:32] problem with that
[1:59:34] isn't that what we want
[1:59:36] isn't that what you want to see
[1:59:38] manifested Among Us don't you want to
[1:59:42] see the prophet's word manifesting among
[1:59:45] us
[1:59:46] even if it means ananiasis and it's a
[1:59:49] virus
[1:59:50] I'm quoting he said there will be and a
[1:59:52] few of them
[1:59:55] you you got to make up your mind do you
[1:59:57] really want a supernatural move of God
[2:00:01] because if you do you you run the risk
[2:00:04] of having to be careful about your
[2:00:06] complexes
[2:00:10] don't you talk to me I know I'm on
[2:00:12] somebody's toes right now
[2:00:14] don't you talk to me about a book of
[2:00:16] Acts Church if you don't want all of it
[2:00:20] if you don't want to get free from your
[2:00:22] witchcraft
[2:00:25] if you won't have to bring in some of
[2:00:26] your curious arts and burn them in a
[2:00:28] pile out there don't talk about the book
[2:00:30] of Acts
[2:00:31] because when the move of God begins and
[2:00:33] you have a ax move of God acts of the
[2:00:36] Holy Spirit moving among you everybody
[2:00:38] goes to house cleaning
[2:00:41] sure come on everybody starts going
[2:00:44] through their movie collection
[2:00:47] but he starts going through their true
[2:00:49] romance and true crime books and
[2:00:51] whatever else they might have they start
[2:00:53] searching to make sure that it's
[2:00:55] edifying
[2:00:56] that it's creating the right atmosphere
[2:00:58] in your home you can bring one thing in
[2:01:01] your home and shift the atmosphere and
[2:01:03] not even know what did it
[2:01:05] it sometimes takes the Holy Ghost to
[2:01:07] reveal what it was that shifted the
[2:01:10] atmosphere of your home you sure you
[2:01:12] want a book of Acts move a supernatural
[2:01:13] move of God I do
[2:01:16] I do
[2:01:18] even if it's your cherished items
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:26] you really want to see you know what
[2:01:27] else a manifestation of the prophet's
[2:01:29] words you know what else he said he said
[2:01:31] missing limbs
[2:01:35] will be restored
[2:01:40] I've I've asked a few Through The Years
[2:01:43] what was he talking about and you know
[2:01:45] what the answer has been by so many he
[2:01:47] was describing his own Ministry he's
[2:01:49] gone
[2:01:51] he said this was what would be going on
[2:01:54] just at Rapture time
[2:02:00] if brother Branham had not finished the
[2:02:02] commission I want to make sure you
[2:02:03] understand this morning the devil didn't
[2:02:05] kill William Branham
[2:02:08] a drunk driver didn't take brother
[2:02:10] branham's life and the Jews didn't
[2:02:12] crucify Jesus Christ and the Romans
[2:02:15] aren't why he died
[2:02:18] and a wreck on the Amarillo highway is
[2:02:20] not what took a profit from the scene
[2:02:22] the one who called The Prophet said
[2:02:24] you've done your work
[2:02:26] it's time for you to decrease
[2:02:29] so that I can increase in the hearts of
[2:02:31] the people
[2:02:34] when we begin to deal with those demonic
[2:02:37] Powers we're not going to be able to
[2:02:39] have time to figure it out and do it in
[2:02:41] the in the name of William Branham I
[2:02:44] cast you out
[2:02:46] you try something like that you may get
[2:02:48] the devil out all right he may strip you
[2:02:51] of your clothes and you run naked
[2:02:53] through the streets like the sons of
[2:02:55] skiva
[2:02:57] the devil may say Paul I know William
[2:03:00] Branham I know
[2:03:01] but who Do You Think You Are
[2:03:06] there's going to be a people
[2:03:08] she's in preparation now she's being
[2:03:11] worked on now
[2:03:13] he's having religion trimmed off of her
[2:03:16] now
[2:03:17] she's getting her legalism out of the
[2:03:20] way now now she's running to the
[2:03:24] absolute of the word
[2:03:26] building a people God is building a
[2:03:29] people
[2:03:30] that will take God at his word
[2:03:34] they won't try to explain it away and
[2:03:36] why it hadn't already happened
[2:03:39] they'll understand that God has a timing
[2:03:42] for all things if God can cause a
[2:03:46] starfish out there in the ocean to grow
[2:03:50] another arm or leg or whatever starfish
[2:03:52] have
[2:03:54] don't you know he can put a finger on
[2:03:56] sister Flo's hand don't you know he can
[2:03:58] put an arm on somebody's elbow don't you
[2:04:01] know he can put a leg on somebody's
[2:04:03] knees somebody said I
[2:04:06] I don't know
[2:04:09] clucking chickens has stood in the way
[2:04:11] long enough
[2:04:18] it's not what he was it's Jesus Christ
[2:04:21] the same yesterday and today and forever
[2:04:27] it's not always pointing the people
[2:04:29] backward it's helping them to understand
[2:04:31] that we are to be the manifestation of
[2:04:34] the prophet's word
[2:04:37] we're supposed to be the Fulfillment of
[2:04:41] what the little bride looks like
[2:04:43] acts like
[2:04:49] in order to do that we need to hear his
[2:04:51] voice we need to hear the prophet's
[2:04:53] voice
[2:04:54] there's two things brother Branham said
[2:04:56] that we we must not forget any of it but
[2:04:58] there's two things we better not forget
[2:04:59] one is come out of her my people
[2:05:03] we better stay out of Babylon we better
[2:05:05] stay out of paganism
[2:05:09] so you can save your money on my
[2:05:11] heart-shaped box of chocolates
[2:05:14] because I'm not going to need it
[2:05:17] come on come out of her my people
[2:05:19] be separate saith the Lord
[2:05:22] and the other thing I don't ever want
[2:05:23] you to forget is he said stay in line
[2:05:27] dance
[2:05:28] [Applause]
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:30] so once you come you cloud of Babylon
[2:05:32] that's not all there is to him now that
[2:05:35] you're out of those systems you've got
[2:05:38] to stay in step with the master
[2:05:43] when he rises you rise when he fall when
[2:05:46] his foot falls your foot falls when his
[2:05:48] leg Rises your eyes what
[2:05:56] we often say this we don't know what
[2:05:58] it's going to look like well we we do
[2:06:01] we do know what it's going to look like
[2:06:03] it's going to look just like the book of
[2:06:05] Acts looked that's what he's saying
[2:06:10] somebody said well what did the book of
[2:06:12] Acts look like it looked just like
[2:06:13] Matthew 16 said
[2:06:15] excuse me Mark 16.
[2:06:18] these signs shall follow them that
[2:06:20] believe in my name they shall cast out
[2:06:21] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[2:06:23] they shall take up serpents if they
[2:06:24] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[2:06:26] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[2:06:27] and they shall recover does anybody
[2:06:29] still believe that's the Mandate for
[2:06:31] this hour
[2:06:32] it has not changed
[2:06:34] somebody said well we're just uh well
[2:06:36] you know we're just uh ripening in the
[2:06:39] Sun
[2:06:41] the churches so many times have been
[2:06:43] rottening and you're not supposed to rot
[2:06:45] in the shade you're supposed to ripen in
[2:06:47] the Sun so keep putting yourself under
[2:06:49] the ministry of the son
[2:06:53] keep getting under the ministry of the
[2:06:55] son
[2:06:56] and you'll ripen and not rot you pull
[2:06:59] out over there into the shade somewhere
[2:07:02] and you'll turn to rot how many of you
[2:07:04] know it'll happen you've got to stay
[2:07:06] under the voice
[2:07:08] all right he goes on I didn't mean to
[2:07:09] get on that I think it sounded a little
[2:07:11] angry and I'm not angry you forgive me
[2:07:13] if it sounded angry
[2:07:15] it's the manifestation of the prophet's
[2:07:17] word that's exactly what we're looking
[2:07:18] for let's go on he said this is God's
[2:07:21] prophet and the true voice of God
[2:07:24] only brings back
[2:07:26] that real living Supernatural god with
[2:07:32] this Supernatural word with the
[2:07:35] supernatural manifestation of the true
[2:07:38] word
[2:07:45] you want a definition
[2:07:47] of a true voice of God
[2:07:49] there it is
[2:07:51] a true voice of God only brings back
[2:07:53] that real living Supernatural god with
[2:07:56] this Supernatural word with the
[2:07:58] supernatural manifestation of the true
[2:08:00] word then we know that it's the voice of
[2:08:03] God
[2:08:04] you better know that for this hour
[2:08:06] you better know that for this day
[2:08:09] come on now we need to understand where
[2:08:11] we are sitting where we're sitting right
[2:08:13] now and what we're sitting under right
[2:08:15] now we need to get an understanding of
[2:08:17] that
[2:08:18] because we want to see the manifestation
[2:08:20] of this Supernatural word
[2:08:23] you've got to be in a place listen
[2:08:26] if you're in a place where the people
[2:08:27] don't praise
[2:08:30] it'll be harder for you to be a praiser
[2:08:36] these precious men I love these
[2:08:38] preachers
[2:08:39] as much as possible
[2:08:44] but sometimes they come out
[2:08:49] like a good amen or a good praise O Lord
[2:08:52] or a good Hallelujah would shatter their
[2:08:55] reverence or something I I I don't get
[2:08:58] it
[2:09:00] if we preachers are afraid for the
[2:09:02] people to see us in the spirit
[2:09:06] what will be the attraction for them to
[2:09:09] get also in the spirit
[2:09:14] if I come out here and look like some
[2:09:17] solemn somebody never raise my hand
[2:09:20] never praise the Lord what would be the
[2:09:24] motivation of the people to try to enter
[2:09:26] in and praise the Lord
[2:09:31] it's very rare that it would continue
[2:09:33] for any amount of time because the
[2:09:36] prophet told us that no people are going
[2:09:38] to get above there
[2:09:43] you know I don't post these things on
[2:09:45] Facebook all the time pray for your
[2:09:47] pastor but I ought to
[2:09:50] you don't know how many times I delete
[2:09:52] them
[2:09:54] just before I post them
[2:09:56] because the enemy says yeah well they'll
[2:09:59] just think you're trying to get
[2:10:00] attention for yourself I I am
[2:10:02] brother Greely needs it and brother
[2:10:05] Shelley needs it when you pray
[2:10:11] I need it he need we need your attention
[2:10:14] when you pray
[2:10:17] because every devil in hell would like
[2:10:19] to stop all of God's men around the
[2:10:22] world from doing what they do
[2:10:25] and I tell you if it and somebody said
[2:10:27] well why should we well you know all the
[2:10:29] reasons why preachers need prayer but
[2:10:30] let me give you a new one because it's
[2:10:33] not likely that you're going to get
[2:10:34] above us in this thing
[2:10:36] and so the only hope you've got to go
[2:10:38] higher
[2:10:40] is to send us ahead of you
[2:10:42] does that make sense to anybody oh God
[2:10:45] raise up my preacher
[2:10:49] is that my pastor feeling so full of the
[2:10:52] Holy Ghost
[2:10:53] [Applause]
[2:10:56] brother Greeley so full of the Holy
[2:10:58] Ghost
[2:10:58] [Applause]
[2:11:00] Hallelujah
[2:11:04] when he walks down the aisle let the
[2:11:07] Devils of Hell tremble
[2:11:10] because if you can get your leaders up
[2:11:13] you get to fly right along
[2:11:24] all of that
[2:11:32] this is going to sound self-serving
[2:11:35] come on I'm gonna say it anyway
[2:11:42] I want to give you another reason
[2:11:44] for making sure you're where God wants
[2:11:46] you to be
[2:11:49] you know people gravitate toward the
[2:11:51] quotes they like
[2:11:55] it's very rare when a man will get up
[2:11:57] and read
[2:11:58] enough
[2:12:00] that you get all sides
[2:12:05] well we printed out for you today
[2:12:06] brother that's that's all sides
[2:12:10] positive negative in between that's all
[2:12:13] of what he said about that subject
[2:12:15] that's what we need to be after if we're
[2:12:19] trying to find the balance you've got to
[2:12:21] read it all
[2:12:24] you line that up with the word and then
[2:12:26] you find where your balance is you don't
[2:12:28] just depend on a few quotations that
[2:12:30] your preacher likes and I have my
[2:12:33] favorites just like you have your
[2:12:34] favorites
[2:12:36] but we pastors tend to like those quotes
[2:12:38] that say things like you get a
[2:12:41] revelation of who your pastor is and
[2:12:43] stay with him he's ordained to take you
[2:12:45] to the Rapture I actually believe that
[2:12:46] with all my heart
[2:12:48] he also said stay with that man as long
[2:12:50] as he's with the word
[2:12:52] if he leaves the word so a lot of people
[2:12:55] will think well if he Don't Preach
[2:12:56] something off the word then I have to be
[2:12:58] there forever and ever and ever and ever
[2:13:00] because that's what the prophet's saying
[2:13:03] well just add this to the list
[2:13:05] add the one where he said you're not
[2:13:07] going any higher than your pastor
[2:13:12] then you make your decision
[2:13:15] you ought not to run off just because
[2:13:17] something goes along that you don't like
[2:13:19] nobody ought to leave a man standing
[2:13:21] there with no help that's wrong no one
[2:13:25] should treat anybody like that the first
[2:13:27] thing you ought to do is fast and pray
[2:13:29] for your pastor that God will raise him
[2:13:31] up
[2:13:33] get him to a higher place so that you
[2:13:35] can follow
[2:13:36] but whatever you do
[2:13:45] don't let Granny's grave
[2:13:50] don't let the fact that Uncle Leroy
[2:13:52] bought the piano
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:13:59] he's moving
[2:14:01] the pillar of fire the supernatural God
[2:14:03] is moving and he's going to have a
[2:14:06] people that follow him it's not to a
[2:14:08] place it's not to a place it's not to
[2:14:11] Alabama
[2:14:12] or to Georgia or to Texas or to
[2:14:15] Louisiana or
[2:14:19] it's not a geographical the Revival for
[2:14:21] the bride the stirring for the bride the
[2:14:24] supernatural happenings and
[2:14:25] manifestations for the bride are not for
[2:14:27] geographical locations they're for
[2:14:30] anywhere the people of God are meeting
[2:14:32] together expecting
[2:14:36] Hallelujah I came today with expectation
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:42] [Applause]
[2:14:44] and a true voice of God only brings back
[2:14:46] the real I gotta hurry
[2:14:48] only brings back that real living
[2:14:50] Supernatural god with his Supernatural
[2:14:52] word with the supernatural manifestation
[2:14:54] of the true word then we know that it's
[2:14:56] the voice of God because of that that's
[2:14:58] there's so much other there's so much
[2:15:01] other in the other Realms that just
[2:15:03] almost deadened that out but remember it
[2:15:06] will glisten
[2:15:08] it'll come forth it'll do it and how
[2:15:12] many of you believe it will and that
[2:15:14] little message have not I sent thee
[2:15:16] Phoenix Arizona brother random said
[2:15:18] where God Appears

[2:15:47] said I'm going to show you the
[2:15:48] supernatural in 2023 I wanted you to
[2:15:52] just get a little bit of expectation

[2:15:57] bit oh Hallelujah because there's
[2:16:00] nothing like a Supernatural season to
[2:16:02] bring forth the suddenlies of God and
[2:16:05] you know what I like about the
[2:16:06] suddenlies they happen suddenly
[2:16:10] after all the years of waiting and
[2:16:12] fasting and logging and praying and all
[2:16:15] of a sudden the season changes and God

[2:17:30] boil
[2:17:32] let me tell you how demons will operate
[2:17:35] brother Branham taught us
[2:17:38] he taught us in prayer lines how demons
[2:17:41] operate he said wait a minute
[2:17:43] Spirit that's on that one the spirited
[2:17:45] on they're calling out to one another
[2:17:50] he said they know their time has come I
[2:17:52] feel that
[2:17:53] he said they know their time has come
[2:17:56] and they're calling in support for one
[2:17:59] another I'm paraphrasing it they're
[2:18:02] trying to join up forces did you know
[2:18:05] Faith Works the same way
[2:18:07] did you know that Dark Realm is just a
[2:18:10] counterfeit
[2:18:11] [Applause]
[2:18:12] it's it strikes right off the original
[2:18:20] it has to
[2:18:22] if there's a false Pentecost there has
[2:18:25] to be a real Pentecost
[2:18:27] if there's a false healing there has to
[2:18:29] be a real healing if there are false
[2:18:32] tongues there has to be a genuine Holy
[2:18:35] Ghost tongue come on
[2:18:39] they love that Mark 16 cast out devils
[2:18:43] but they don't know what to do about
[2:18:44] that speak with new tongues
[2:18:50] we need it
[2:18:52] your old tongue keeps getting you in
[2:18:54] trouble

[2:19:02] Hallelujah
[2:19:04] oh
[2:19:06] let me read you some notes here about
[2:19:08] the supernatural the realm of the
[2:19:11] supernatural it's a realm of Faith let
[2:19:13] me just say this before I do that it's a
[2:19:15] realm of faith
[2:19:19] we we saw how God taught brother Brandon
[2:19:22] to believe
[2:19:23] he he started dealing with him in the
[2:19:25] natural I mean in a very Supernatural
[2:19:28] way about very natural things
[2:19:31] he he let him see a caribou
[2:19:34] up
[2:19:36] and God give him the caribou
[2:19:40] that's how God dealt with David
[2:19:43] God gave him a lion
[2:19:45] God gave him a bear
[2:19:48] and then God gave him a giant
[2:19:51] delivered the people
[2:19:53] that's how God was working with brother
[2:19:55] Branham if he could help him to have the
[2:19:57] faith to believe for these little
[2:19:59] visions that would come and then he
[2:20:01] would see them come to pass
[2:20:05] it built his faith
[2:20:08] and he started getting Bolder in his
[2:20:10] faith
[2:20:12] now somebody told me he said well
[2:20:13] brother Brandon he just stepped out on
[2:20:15] the scene he never had to learn a thing
[2:20:16] he just did it well I'll tell you what
[2:20:18] if that's the case he was he came here
[2:20:20] higher than Jesus Christ
[2:20:23] because the Bible said though he were a
[2:20:25] son
[2:20:26] yet he learned by the things he suffered
[2:20:28] I want you to know brother Branham had
[2:20:30] some learning to do because he was a man
[2:20:33] and he learned in front of the people
[2:20:36] he didn't have a choice his ministry was
[2:20:39] so in demand he had to learn as he went
[2:20:42] and God honored and blessed him for it
[2:20:44] you let one little thing happen like
[2:20:46] that and he saw that little vision come
[2:20:48] to pass
[2:20:50] and that gave him Faith to believe for
[2:20:52] the next
[2:20:53] then a son came in his hand and that
[2:20:55] gave him the faith that he needed to
[2:20:57] call that out and
[2:20:59] brother brother uh FF Bosworth brother
[2:21:02] Ern Baxter excuse me
[2:21:04] brother Aaron Baxter saw that operate
[2:21:06] several times and he began to describe
[2:21:09] that it was a physical thing that he
[2:21:11] could see with his own eye when that
[2:21:12] when that hand that sign would come in
[2:21:15] brother branham's hand in the very skin
[2:21:17] of his hand would change sometimes it
[2:21:20] would bump up and sometimes it would
[2:21:22] turn color and sometimes it would do
[2:21:24] different things and brother Brandon was
[2:21:26] able then to look at his hand and the
[2:21:28] response of that gift to the vibration
[2:21:31] of the disease and he began to learn
[2:21:33] what to call the disease
[2:21:36] but that wasn't the highest part of the
[2:21:38] ministry that was getting him ready for
[2:21:39] what was coming
[2:21:42] and then there came a time that he was
[2:21:43] able just to say uh and yes Mr farmer
[2:21:51] and Faith Works that way
[2:21:53] you just let God deal with you and some
[2:21:55] of you know what someone sees an eagle
[2:21:59] and they get excited about it
[2:22:01] and I think you should
[2:22:03] because I think it builds your faith
[2:22:07] amen I try to celebrate I get you you'd
[2:22:11] be surprised how many Eagle pictures I
[2:22:12] get people send me Eagle pictures from
[2:22:14] all over the world of all kinds of
[2:22:16] eagles that they've seen and they say
[2:22:17] look what God did for me brother Shelley
[2:22:19] and you know what I try to celebrate
[2:22:21] with every last one of them because if
[2:22:25] they can come to believe
[2:22:28] that God has sent that eagle by to
[2:22:31] encourage them
[2:22:33] you ought to see us out here sometime
[2:22:35] when they come
[2:22:38] Benjamin came to me just last week and
[2:22:41] he said come out here Daddy it's so far
[2:22:42] I can't hardly see it but see if it
[2:22:44] sounds sounds like an eagle to you I
[2:22:46] believe it's one of the Eagles but he
[2:22:47] was by himself
[2:22:48] and I went out and I heard it and I tell
[2:22:51] you what it was too almost so far away I
[2:22:53] couldn't see it with my glasses but I
[2:22:55] could hear him
[2:22:57] and I come walking down that aisle that
[2:22:59] hallway a little higher than I was
[2:23:01] walking before
[2:23:05] well God made Eagles and you can always
[2:23:07] see an eel and you don't uh yeah but you
[2:23:09] know what I see a buzzard it don't build
[2:23:11] my faith
[2:23:15] I saw a headless deer out there on the
[2:23:17] highway today it didn't build my faith I
[2:23:19] saw them circling around getting ready
[2:23:21] to make dinner
[2:23:23] that didn't build my faith but you let
[2:23:24] me see an eagle oh yes Lord
[2:23:27] why because I can identify myself
[2:23:32] my faith allows me to identify myself
[2:23:35] with that eagle
[2:23:37] you see I too like you I'm a special
[2:23:39] built bird
[2:23:43] though an eagle from the start
[2:23:47] had to have a change of heart
[2:23:49] I was living by the nature of Earth's
[2:23:53] sway
[2:23:54] but that nature burned and died when
[2:23:57] Jehovah Eagle cried and I recognized my
[2:24:01] papa on that day
[2:24:04] spread your wings come and fly
[2:24:10] a little Eagle rise to meet our blessed
[2:24:13] Lord on the wings of great Jehovah
[2:24:17] through the witness of his word beat
[2:24:20] your wings and rise to meet him in the
[2:24:24] sky
[2:24:28] I hope Jonathan Hollis is
[2:24:31] singing that with me on the Stream
[2:24:34] because it was his little short Daddy
[2:24:38] and I heard sing it the first time
[2:24:41] he sung two songs I loved and that's
[2:24:44] that your friend's cousin your what's
[2:24:47] your name I forget her name Debbie
[2:24:49] sister Debbie's
[2:24:50] cousin
[2:24:52] I'm talking about
[2:24:54] and he he was about that tall
[2:24:58] in his country
[2:25:00] as grits
[2:25:04] just country just real
[2:25:09] and he heard a rumor
[2:25:11] he heard that
[2:25:13] sister Shelley's grandson
[2:25:16] had received the message
[2:25:19] because he his mom and daddy
[2:25:22] were great friends
[2:25:24] to my grandparents
[2:25:27] and he'd heard a rumor and he got Steve
[2:25:30] Knoll
[2:25:34] he got uh
[2:25:37] Jimmy Beach's brother
[2:25:40] can't think of his name was his name
[2:25:42] Steve Beach big
[2:25:44] to drive him because brother Hollis
[2:25:46] didn't drive
[2:25:47] and drove him I was off doing something
[2:25:49] for my granny she was sick she was low
[2:25:52] and I came home there to bring whatever
[2:25:55] it was she sent me for and there was
[2:25:57] this great old big man
[2:25:59] and and little short tiny man
[2:26:02] and I didn't know them I'd met them seen
[2:26:05] them seen brother Hollis but didn't know
[2:26:07] him
[2:26:07] and they had brought me
[2:26:09] this is what what we've had to do for
[2:26:12] each other then
[2:26:15] he had brought me a pasteboard box of
[2:26:17] every VCR testimony
[2:26:20] ever good service he'd ever been in that
[2:26:22] he could share
[2:26:23] a stack of spoken word books and
[2:26:26] articles and papers and mimeographs
[2:26:30] anything he thought would encourage me
[2:26:33] on my new Journey
[2:26:35] he brought me that box I said brother
[2:26:37] I'll pay you for this oh he said you
[2:26:39] couldn't afford
[2:26:43] you couldn't afford to pay me for what I
[2:26:46] brought you
[2:26:47] he said this is a feast for Eagles right
[2:26:50] here you can't put a price
[2:26:55] [Applause]
[2:26:58] granny said Marin there's a an old
[2:27:01] Gibson guitar behind the couch Steve get
[2:27:03] the guitar
[2:27:05] and sing us a song and he's about this
[2:27:07] tall
[2:27:09] and the guitar is bigger than he is
[2:27:13] and he sings if you'll move over just a
[2:27:16] little bit I'll help you carry your load
[2:27:20] and I thought little man I don't know
[2:27:22] who you are but you ain't big enough to
[2:27:24] carry nothing
[2:27:27] you can't hardly carry that guitar but
[2:27:29] something tells me you're a giant
[2:27:34] you don't look like you can carry a sack
[2:27:37] of potatoes but what you carry something
[2:27:40] tells me is a far greater value than
[2:27:44] being able to win a a schoolyard fight
[2:27:48] and then he sung that song Sitting on
[2:27:50] Granny's old brown couch though an eagle
[2:27:53] from the start God that will let you see
[2:27:56] that eagle and it it just does something
[2:27:58] for you it builds your faith
[2:28:03] sister Jeffrey's having an experience
[2:28:06] like that I'm not going to tell what it
[2:28:09] is
[2:28:11] but something's bringing her a little
[2:28:12] gift
[2:28:16] why say it again
[2:28:19] two times yesterday
[2:28:22] bringing her little gift just putting it
[2:28:24] on the railover I'm gonna tell it
[2:28:28] it don't look like nothing to nobody
[2:28:30] else she's sitting wrapped it up in the
[2:28:32] kleenex and sent it to me Tuesday night
[2:28:33] because we'd already seen it and talked
[2:28:35] about it
[2:28:37] why would God bother
[2:28:39] to send a little animal with someone why
[2:28:42] would God bother to do something like
[2:28:43] that because the right kind of a person
[2:28:46] sees that
[2:28:49] and they say who am I
[2:28:53] who am I that God would love me enough
[2:28:57] to send me a bird
[2:29:00] it's not who I am it's whose I am
[2:29:03] [Applause]
[2:29:05] that starts building your faith and you
[2:29:07] bring that to church with you when you
[2:29:09] come and your faith is lifted up
[2:29:13] and you hear a Tiffany
[2:29:16] [Applause]
[2:29:18] [Music]
[2:29:21] who had an issue
[2:29:26] [Applause]
[2:29:30] I'm okay
[2:29:33] don't call the police
[2:29:38] I haven't fallen and I can't get up at
[2:29:40] any of it that's not the problem
[2:29:42] I sold
[2:29:44] Charisma magazine where one of the big
[2:29:46] preachers I can't think was named his
[2:29:48] iPhone his iWatch or whatever you call
[2:29:50] these things tries to keep calling the
[2:29:53] one Sunday they're trying to call and
[2:29:55] said it fallen and do you need us to
[2:29:58] send help and they made a big article
[2:29:59] about it and sent it all around on the
[2:30:01] internet and I I I wanted to comment and
[2:30:04] say it happens to me every Sunday
[2:30:07] he just needs to get a little more
[2:30:08] stirred up sometime wouldn't shock
[2:30:10] everybody if he got a little happier
[2:30:12] every now and then
[2:30:13] it happens to me two or three times in
[2:30:15] the service
[2:30:16] I can't help it
[2:30:18] it's whose I am I'm not even preaching
[2:30:21] I'm not even I'm so sorry to you
[2:30:23] visitors that I'm not even preaching uh
[2:30:26] this morning I don't know I think I'm
[2:30:28] just testifying or something I don't
[2:30:30] know what I'm doing
[2:30:31] but I want you to know he's a
[2:30:33] supernatural God
[2:30:35] I want you to know we limit him with our
[2:30:39] own our own uh uh
[2:30:41] non-expectation law low expectation
[2:30:47] if you if you watch start watching for
[2:30:49] God's Supernatural in your life and
[2:30:52] embracing it it will only increase
[2:30:55] if you'll thank him for every Eagle's
[2:30:58] siding and everything
[2:31:00] Lily are you listening to me
[2:31:04] if you're streaming this service
[2:31:07] what impresses me sister Rebecca about
[2:31:11] your sister Lily
[2:31:13] is every little thing that's what I I
[2:31:17] encouraged her in the beginning
[2:31:20] every little thing that God is doing for
[2:31:23] her she's sending a text
[2:31:29] I know she don't sin for everything but
[2:31:31] when she recognizes it
[2:31:34] she sins and yours your sister Hannah
[2:31:38] the same way
[2:31:40] the dog got lost
[2:31:43] she was concerned about that dog pray
[2:31:45] for my dog to come home and the next
[2:31:47] thing you know heard the texts come
[2:31:52] I said well that ain't cancer being here
[2:31:54] let me tell you something if you can
[2:31:56] trust God for the puppy to come home
[2:32:01] [Applause]
[2:32:03] if you can let that build your faith
[2:32:06] [Music]
[2:32:07] if you can be facing what Lily is facing
[2:32:10] right now and and some little shift
[2:32:12] happened and you you send your long
[2:32:15] distance Pastor a text and said look
[2:32:17] here what the Lord is doing I Want To
[2:32:20] Praise Him for every little thing he
[2:32:21] does
[2:32:23] I'll just give one example that came to
[2:32:25] my mind she needed something done to her
[2:32:27] home and nobody to do it and somebody
[2:32:30] found out what needed to be done and
[2:32:31] drove a distance to do it
[2:32:36] how much do I owe you let me get my
[2:32:38] money you don't owe me a thing
[2:32:41] and he told a story about a time that he
[2:32:44] was he needed help and he didn't know
[2:32:46] how to fix it
[2:32:48] and somebody came and helped him and he
[2:32:51] passed it on and she became the
[2:32:53] beneficiary of that
[2:32:56] you might be like Benjamin and Jenna
[2:32:59] you just need somebody to come and tell
[2:33:01] you what the switch is for
[2:33:06] but God will send somebody
[2:33:13] I want to praise him for that
[2:33:17] simple
[2:33:19] we were up there the other day and
[2:33:22] they had gotten some beautiful wedding
[2:33:24] pictures
[2:33:26] framed I said that's the right thing to
[2:33:28] do
[2:33:29] some people come in and say oh they got
[2:33:31] a lot of pictures of themselves in their
[2:33:32] wedding and whatever else up I said
[2:33:35] that's not the thing to think about a
[2:33:37] lot of us bought albums had it all put
[2:33:39] in albums and we get them out every five
[2:33:41] years and look at them they don't do us
[2:33:43] a bit of good if you're going to spend
[2:33:45] that money you might as well have them
[2:33:46] to enjoy yourself remember your good day
[2:33:50] and have somebody else come in and
[2:33:52] remember it
[2:33:53] and so they there was one that there was
[2:33:55] kind of a different shape
[2:33:57] and they decided Jenna I think had the
[2:34:00] idea of hanging it there on the over the
[2:34:03] panel and they no that wouldn't hurt
[2:34:04] nothing to hang that there
[2:34:06] and there's a light switch up above up
[2:34:08] above their light switch way up there
[2:34:10] and said what's that last one I don't
[2:34:12] know
[2:34:14] light switch I don't know what that's
[2:34:15] for switch it nothing happens
[2:34:19] yes it does
[2:34:24] you just gotta know what it is so she's
[2:34:26] showing her mom and them and their
[2:34:27] sister Joy showing them about the
[2:34:30] pictures she takes off and she flips
[2:34:31] that switch
[2:34:33] with the picture I think
[2:34:35] and they go to get hot water
[2:34:41] they had to call the repairman
[2:34:43] we was all saying oh I hope it's just an
[2:34:46] element oh I hope it's just the element
[2:34:47] won't be one I hope they don't have to
[2:34:49] replace oh Lord I hope they don't have
[2:34:52] to replace that hot water heater they
[2:34:54] didn't have to replace that hot water
[2:34:55] heater they didn't have to put in a new
[2:34:57] element they just needed a man to come
[2:34:59] and tell him what the switch was for
[2:35:02] eign
[2:35:07] I took up your time just to tell you
[2:35:10] that if you don't know if you're like me
[2:35:12] and you don't know how to fix things and
[2:35:15] God blesses you that way
[2:35:19] you can help but praise him
[2:35:22] [Applause]
[2:35:27] you've got to learn to see him and then
[2:35:28] you stop and give him praise and then
[2:35:30] you bring that Faith with you when you
[2:35:32] come come on
[2:35:35] here is uh Luke and Megan and they
[2:35:38] they're they're gone forever
[2:35:42] over the holidays
[2:35:45] and I had a little something come on me
[2:35:48] Thursday
[2:35:50] of that last weekend they were gone
[2:35:53] something come on me
[2:35:55] and I did not obey the Lord
[2:35:58] and the only person that knows anything
[2:36:00] about what I'm going to say is Benjamin
[2:36:02] and I'm not going to say it
[2:36:05] but
[2:36:07] I told him later something came on me
[2:36:11] and I I felt like I was supposed to do
[2:36:14] something
[2:36:15] and I said I can't do that I I can't
[2:36:19] inconvenience people that way I can't
[2:36:22] expect or ask or
[2:36:25] or or even think
[2:36:28] that somebody would change their plans
[2:36:31] for me
[2:36:33] and I wouldn't want to try to have to
[2:36:36] convince somebody that it was the Lord
[2:36:38] because sometimes when you do that you
[2:36:40] start defending and the Lord doesn't
[2:36:42] want you defending
[2:36:45] so I I didn't obey the Lord
[2:36:48] and and some of you be Mighty glad I
[2:36:51] didn't because you would have been put
[2:36:52] in a position more than one would have
[2:36:54] been put into the position whether you
[2:36:56] trusted me or not
[2:36:57] so I didn't obey the Lord
[2:37:00] and then I got a text from them that
[2:37:02] says we're coming home early we want to
[2:37:04] be in church on Sunday
[2:37:08] thank you Lord
[2:37:10] it was confirmation
[2:37:12] and I praise the Lord for it
[2:37:15] and then they get up here and
[2:37:17] something goes amiss
[2:37:20] and they're stranded there
[2:37:22] and they can't make it back the weekend
[2:37:25] after all
[2:37:27] and there's nothing like being with all
[2:37:29] them babies and being stranded like that
[2:37:31] and depending on whoever will come along
[2:37:33] and help you that would stress you like
[2:37:35] that and and I have to say I I did say
[2:37:38] Lord I don't understand because I truly
[2:37:41] believe
[2:37:42] that that was you moving on them whether
[2:37:44] they know it or not
[2:37:46] I believe that was you stirring them to
[2:37:48] be here and then look how circumstances
[2:37:50] happen but I couldn't blame the devil
[2:37:54] I'm not a Pentecostal from denomination
[2:37:57] I couldn't blame the devil that they
[2:37:59] didn't make it I had to say God you have
[2:38:01] a sovereign plan I don't know why you
[2:38:03] didn't bring them all the way
[2:38:05] but you brought him part of the way and
[2:38:07] I don't know what you spared them from
[2:38:09] but you did something
[2:38:12] Supernatural
[2:38:14] now I'm saying all that to say this and
[2:38:16] here they come in this morning and
[2:38:18] Luke's not a big singer he's not sung
[2:38:21] any kind of lead like that more than a a
[2:38:24] half a dozen times or a dozen at the
[2:38:26] most
[2:38:27] and he gets up here and they sing that
[2:38:30] song to us
[2:38:33] that built up my faith
[2:38:36] now I said Lord it didn't come like it's
[2:38:39] just like I thought it would come but it
[2:38:41] came
[2:38:42] it didn't turn out just the way I
[2:38:44] thought but it just began to work on my
[2:38:46] faith a little more and let me know that
[2:38:49] if we are listening
[2:38:52] a supernatural God is talking
[2:38:56] if we have an ear to hear him
[2:39:01] I want you musicians to come I'm almost
[2:39:03] apologizing for this sermon but uh
[2:39:07] let me read a few things here to you as
[2:39:09] they're coming the realm of the
[2:39:11] Supernatural is the realm beyond the
[2:39:14] reach of science
[2:39:16] it's the realm Beyond human explanation
[2:39:21] and here's where we get in big trouble
[2:39:24] even the angel of the Lord rebuked
[2:39:27] Brother Branham
[2:39:29] for trying to explain
[2:39:32] the supernatural
[2:39:34] to people who don't have ears to hear
[2:39:38] Jesus talked about casting pearls
[2:39:42] Before Swine
[2:39:45] brother Branham was told not to try to
[2:39:47] explain that but in his
[2:39:50] in his effort to want people to get on
[2:39:53] board and get behind what God was doing
[2:39:56] he spent a little extra time explaining
[2:39:59] the way the Lord worked with him and he
[2:40:02] got royally rebuked for it which
[2:40:05] encourages me
[2:40:09] it encourages me that God was watching
[2:40:12] after him
[2:40:14] it doesn't make me lose confidence it
[2:40:17] causes me to have more confidence
[2:40:21] that God knows how to correct us when we
[2:40:24] get out of line even with the best of
[2:40:26] intention
[2:40:28] there are some things that will never be
[2:40:31] explained I cannot explain
[2:40:37] people have said I don't know what
[2:40:39] you're doing brother Shelley when you
[2:40:40] are worshiping you're moving your hands
[2:40:43] and you're making motions and you're
[2:40:50] I can't explain
[2:40:55] I don't understand all of the ways that
[2:40:59] shift that realm I don't understand all
[2:41:03] the things but I'm not going to
[2:41:04] criticize others that I don't understand
[2:41:07] and I'm not going to spend all my time
[2:41:09] trying to figure out the ways of God I
[2:41:12] know that one motion one act of
[2:41:16] obedience
[2:41:18] yes
[2:41:19] one song
[2:41:25] one flag
[2:41:29] can shift the atmosphere of a room it
[2:41:33] can usher in a Heavenly Host
[2:41:35] it can send demon spirits of light
[2:41:39] that's all I know folks I don't know how
[2:41:41] to tell you why
[2:41:42] all I know is I have watched it happen
[2:41:45] again and again and again and again
[2:41:49] I don't know why sister Anna Christine
[2:41:52] pressed in so close
[2:41:58] she doesn't normally come and stand up
[2:42:01] close
[2:42:03] but when I looked down at her and I saw
[2:42:07] her standing up close like that I knew
[2:42:13] I cannot explain it
[2:42:16] but I knew that the Lord had her in that
[2:42:20] place for a reason
[2:42:23] I saw sister hope come down the aisle at
[2:42:26] a particular time and stand right there
[2:42:28] in the aisle with the little miles I
[2:42:31] think in her arm but it was at that
[2:42:33] moment it was the moment she came it was
[2:42:36] it was at the at the right timing that
[2:42:39] she came and it struck my heart again
[2:42:41] that's exactly what she should be doing
[2:42:44] in this moment
[2:42:46] don't you come running up here so I'll
[2:42:48] say that about you
[2:42:50] that is not what this is about
[2:42:53] don't you sit there and say I'm up there
[2:42:55] every service and he don't mention that
[2:42:58] that's not what I mean to do I wouldn't
[2:43:00] discourage you or hurt your feelings for
[2:43:02] nothing in the world I'm just telling
[2:43:04] you you may be sitting there and you
[2:43:06] keep feeling that urge to do something
[2:43:08] and you don't know why you're supposed
[2:43:10] to do it you can spend the rest of the
[2:43:12] service trying to figure it out
[2:43:15] or you can just be like brother Shaw and
[2:43:18] say hey
[2:43:25] if he were to sit there and figure out
[2:43:26] now what does that mean and why why am I
[2:43:28] going to enter why am I going to say hey
[2:43:31] if he were to figure that out the urge
[2:43:33] would leave him in the purpose gone
[2:43:36] but there are some times when he says
[2:43:38] that I tell you I feel something riding
[2:43:40] in on it
[2:43:43] there are times that someone can say
[2:43:46] just the right thing in this service and
[2:43:48] you feel things riding out on it you
[2:43:50] obey the Lord we're serving a
[2:43:53] supernatural God we're a supernatural
[2:43:56] people we're living in a supernatural
[2:43:58] hour
[2:44:00] we don't want church as usual
[2:44:05] I want it to be as unpredictable as
[2:44:07] possible
[2:44:08] and still glorify the Lord
[2:44:11] Hallelujah
[2:44:12] because we don't ever know what moment
[2:44:15] he's going to break out
[2:44:17] and nagging infirmity or whatever it is
[2:44:20] that has troubled you so long absolutely
[2:44:23] leave you because your faith has reached
[2:44:26] a level
[2:44:28] the realm of the Supernatural is beyond
[2:44:30] the reach of science it's beyond human
[2:44:32] explanation it means above and beyond
[2:44:34] the natural that Supernatural realm is
[2:44:37] the realm where God operates
[2:44:39] it is the realm where Heaven and Earth
[2:44:42] intermingle
[2:44:44] it is the realm of intersection
[2:44:46] intersection between God and man when
[2:44:50] God and man intercept
[2:44:53] when they have a meeting
[2:44:56] that meeting is in the realm of the
[2:44:59] supernatural when you say he touched me
[2:45:03] he did it by reaching from The Unseen
[2:45:06] Realm
[2:45:08] and impacting you
[2:45:10] in the realm of the natural
[2:45:14] God wants his children he wants his
[2:45:16] bride to live and operate from the realm
[2:45:21] of the supernatural
[2:45:23] and if we explain ourselves all the time
[2:45:26] we'll lose the edge
[2:45:29] of instant obedience
[2:45:32] I want to be that one that God says jump
[2:45:34] and I jump
[2:45:36] somebody said I want to be the one who
[2:45:37] screams how high I don't
[2:45:40] if he'd wanted to say JUMP three feet he
[2:45:43] said jump three feet if the Holy Ghost
[2:45:45] said jump I just want to jump
[2:45:47] you understand what I'm saying I'm not
[2:45:50] trying to make it a gymnastics class
[2:45:51] here
[2:45:52] I'm just telling you we want to be that
[2:45:55] fluid
[2:45:56] I don't wanna I don't want to disappoint
[2:45:58] the Lord like I felt like I did that
[2:46:01] weekend
[2:46:04] I don't want to miss I'm I'm selfish
[2:46:07] when it comes to these things
[2:46:10] I don't want to miss what God has for us
[2:46:14] and because I love you I don't want you
[2:46:16] to miss what God has for you
[2:46:19] and so I'm willing
[2:46:23] we have to be what he said
[2:46:25] he met me down at Fort Morgan
[2:46:29] he said I'm going to make you a
[2:46:31] a gazing stock
[2:46:34] I thought well if the Lord said it that
[2:46:37] sounds good but something about gazing
[2:46:39] stock don't sound too good
[2:46:43] looks to me like something people stare
[2:46:45] at and scratch their head and try to
[2:46:46] figure out that is not what I'm after
[2:46:49] Lord
[2:46:50] and guess what I looked it up and that's
[2:46:52] pretty much much what it means people
[2:46:54] will look at you and scratch their head
[2:46:56] and try to figure out what in the world
[2:46:57] you are
[2:47:00] but that's what he came and said well if
[2:47:02] if I'm if I'm to be that I want to be
[2:47:04] the best one
[2:47:07] I don't want them to scratch for a half
[2:47:09] a minute I want them to keep on trying
[2:47:10] to figure it out
[2:47:13] come on now
[2:47:14] I'm not trying to be silly
[2:47:17] he wants you and I operating from that
[2:47:19] realm he wants us to be more familiar
[2:47:24] with Spirit Realm
[2:47:27] we got natural round down pat we know
[2:47:30] how to live in the Physical Realm
[2:47:33] we need to learn how to exercise the
[2:47:37] grace and the authority to operate in
[2:47:39] that Supernatural realm I've done some
[2:47:41] teaching on that you can find it maybe
[2:47:43] under exercising your spiritual senses
[2:47:47] because just like you have natural
[2:47:49] senses to connect you with your your
[2:47:52] external environment you've been given
[2:47:55] internal senses that help you connect to
[2:47:59] Spirit realm him
[2:48:02] sounds a little strange to some
[2:48:05] but it's there
[2:48:07] and we have to be able to control the
[2:48:09] mind the will and the emotions
[2:48:13] to be able to get out of the way enough
[2:48:15] to let Spirit move
[2:48:17] as many as are LED are you ready for
[2:48:20] your song Get Ready be ready as many as
[2:48:23] are led by the spirit of God
[2:48:26] they are
[2:48:28] the sons of God
[2:48:35] I don't know who you are friend
[2:48:38] but you've posted to come in here and I
[2:48:41] like it
[2:48:45] I believe that's a brother
[2:48:48] stellen
[2:48:50] I don't know where you're from but he
[2:48:52] said the message of the hour is
[2:48:54] Supernatural from the supernatural to
[2:48:56] the supernatural citizens of the
[2:48:59] supernatural promise new city I'm with
[2:49:03] you
[2:49:04] you can say Supernatural a few more
[2:49:06] times and I'll still be with you
[2:49:09] let me close with this Revelation 4 1
[2:49:12] says come up hither
[2:49:16] and I will show you what must take place
[2:49:18] after now
[2:49:19] or what must take place after this or
[2:49:22] what must come here after as the King
[2:49:24] James says it
[2:49:26] this was an invitation
[2:49:28] to the realm of the supernatural
[2:49:31] brother Branham says this is where we
[2:49:33] trace the rapture
[2:49:35] this was this was him coming for his
[2:49:38] bride John a type of the Bride caught up
[2:49:41] into a higher place but in context John
[2:49:45] was caught up into higher place so that
[2:49:48] he could come and begin to share and
[2:49:51] spread what he saw what he learned in
[2:49:54] that Supernatural realm he could bring
[2:49:56] it to us and we are the beneficiaries of
[2:49:58] the fact that John got in the spirit
[2:50:01] we are benefiting because John got in
[2:50:04] the spirit
[2:50:05] wives your husband will benefit
[2:50:09] if you learn how to get in the spirit
[2:50:13] husbands your wives will benefit if you
[2:50:16] learn how to move in the realm of the
[2:50:18] spirit
[2:50:19] children your parents
[2:50:22] will benefit if you learn how to yield
[2:50:24] yourself your life to the spirit of God
[2:50:27] and children will benefit in the home of
[2:50:30] parents
[2:50:32] your relationships will shift as you
[2:50:36] learn to operate in that realm the
[2:50:39] supernatural realm is a realm of
[2:50:41] Consciousness it's a realm of reality
[2:50:43] it's a realm of power it's a realm of
[2:50:46] Holiness and Purity it's a realm of
[2:50:50] beauty and it's a realm where God speaks
[2:50:53] to us
[2:50:54] and where we hear him and we depend on
[2:50:57] him for Grace to be obedient anybody
[2:51:01] with me let's stand I
[2:51:06] I would have desired to do better for
[2:51:08] you
[2:51:09] but I'm trusting him
[2:51:14] the old timers used to sing that song
[2:51:16] when the Lord gets ready you better move
[2:51:19] I just want to tell you church folks
[2:51:21] when the Lord gets ready
[2:51:28] I want to just look at you a minute
[2:51:30] when the Lord gets ready
[2:51:38] I was sure glad to have these older
[2:51:40] children of sister minkels and
[2:51:42] back here they were gone a long time
[2:51:48] and uh
[2:51:50] I might say
[2:51:52] their presence was missed
[2:51:56] and I even looked back there today right
[2:51:58] back in that crowd when worship was
[2:52:00] going on and Carter was singing
[2:52:05] he wasn't up here but he was back there
[2:52:07] and he was singing
[2:52:09] and I thought you know what
[2:52:11] that little fellow makes a difference
[2:52:17] [Music]
[2:52:19] all right

[2:52:27] when you're where you're supposed to be

[2:52:47] anointing on your faith why don't you
[2:52:50] just reach your hand up right now and
[2:52:52] see if the Lord would so anoint your
[2:52:56] faith that you could just reach up and
[2:52:58] take it as your own whatever it is that

[3:07:16] the very Rapture the very Resurrection
[3:07:18] the final change
[3:07:21] for the bride

[3:07:27] qualifying ourselves
[3:07:30] constantly trying to take ourselves out
[3:07:32] of your economy
[3:07:34] and would you drop a revelation down
[3:07:36] into our hearts today
[3:07:39] that this is our destiny that's being
[3:07:41] preached this is our destiny that's
[3:07:44] being witnessed
[3:07:46] to be a supernatural demonstration of a

[3:15:20] amen
[3:15:22] thank you
[3:15:23] [Music]
[3:15:27] she just wrote that little song and uh
[3:15:29] was going to sing it this morning and
[3:15:31] there was no time to for the musicians
[3:15:34] to run over it but something she said in
[3:15:36] her text touched me she said I I feel it
[3:15:39] strong and she said I'll just I would
[3:15:41] sing it without music if I had to do it
[3:15:43] and I didn't want us to miss that chance
[3:15:46] sister shoshana feels that she has a
[3:15:49] testimony that she should share with us
[3:15:51] so let's just stay put if you need to
[3:15:53] sit you can but if not just stay right
[3:15:55] here
[3:15:57] brother Shelley has been really strong
[3:16:00] about not taking up time talking about
[3:16:02] how that you don't public speak
[3:16:05] and the Lord's really been using that
[3:16:07] for me because there was a point in my
[3:16:10] life where I was absolutely Fearless I'd
[3:16:13] talk about the Lord to anybody anywhere
[3:16:15] the Lord had done such a supernatural
[3:16:18] change in my life when I was 16.
[3:16:22] and then the Lord allowed me to go
[3:16:24] through a church situation where a
[3:16:26] pastor
[3:16:27] basically any time that I would even
[3:16:29] share a scripture with him privately he
[3:16:31] just told me that I was wrong and that I
[3:16:33] couldn't testify him because I was a
[3:16:35] woman and it really put a complex on me
[3:16:38] I guess
[3:16:40] and I had a friend when the Lord was
[3:16:42] beginning the process of healing I had a
[3:16:44] friend look at me and say shashana do
[3:16:46] you really think the devil would tell
[3:16:47] you to share scripture yeah or talk
[3:16:49] about the Lord he said it comes from one
[3:16:51] of two places he said if you ever feel
[3:16:54] like you need to come share something
[3:16:55] with me from the Lord he said you just
[3:16:56] come share it with me and that really
[3:16:58] helped
[3:16:59] in the years that I've spent here have
[3:17:01] really helped
[3:17:05] and the Lord's been doing so much for me
[3:17:07] just privately praise somebody and you'd
[3:17:10] say that you felt like apologizing for
[3:17:12] the service this morning brother Shelly
[3:17:13] you literally said word for a word I was
[3:17:16] alone in the house yesterday for a while
[3:17:18] Edith was sleeping and he was outside
[3:17:20] and I the Lord's just been doing
[3:17:23] deep and I picked up my phone and I
[3:17:24] started voice texting my sisters I
[3:17:26] didn't even share this with Nathan
[3:17:28] they're the only ones you know
[3:17:31] either I trust God or I don't yes yes
[3:17:35] he's either Sovereign or he's not
[3:17:39] there's no accidents there's not a storm
[3:17:43] that can touch my life either I keep
[3:17:45] Covenant with the Lord or I don't I have
[3:17:48] Bridal Authority or I don't you can't
[3:17:51] have it two ways
[3:17:54] and I have the right in my tongue to
[3:17:56] speak to a storm and say stop and it has
[3:17:59] to stop and when the enemy is attacking
[3:18:02] my family I can say stop and he has to
[3:18:05] stop
[3:18:06] and it's just been so strong on my heart
[3:18:10] and then you get up this morning and you
[3:18:12] just said everything and I just felt
[3:18:14] such a bubbling up inside of me and I
[3:18:17] couldn't keep it still I had to share
[3:18:20] what the Lord has been doing for me for
[3:18:23] two weeks I couldn't hear out of my left
[3:18:26] ear and I knew I needed to go get it
[3:18:28] checked out and I just said Lord I don't
[3:18:30] want to see a doctor I believe I know
[3:18:32] what this is about and tonight I want
[3:18:35] you to open my ear and that night the
[3:18:37] Lord began to open my ears and while I
[3:18:40] was standing in church this morning it
[3:18:42] finished opening and I can hear just
[3:18:44] fine
[3:18:45] [Applause]
[3:18:48] and I just gotta give him praise
[3:18:53] Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory
[3:18:58] Hallelujah
[3:19:01] thank you that you give the victory
[3:19:08] [Applause]
[3:19:10] in the early 90s it went around the
[3:19:13] movement
[3:19:14] I mean it really went around the
[3:19:16] movement you you that couldn't be a true
[3:19:18] message church because they let the
[3:19:20] ladies testify
[3:19:24] I appreciate a good testimony
[3:19:26] David your mother
[3:19:29] what has a something of scripture I
[3:19:31] believe they said that she felt the Lord
[3:19:33] had laid on her heart and I'm I don't
[3:19:35] mind that either
[3:19:38] um yesterday God was really dealing with
[3:19:40] me in my own personal life too and I was
[3:19:43] taking back ground that the enemy's
[3:19:45] trying to steal from me for years and so
[3:19:49] I had even testified to a couple of my
[3:19:52] sons you know I'm taken back
[3:19:56] being the Lord
[3:19:58] I read scripture and it was in the cjb
[3:20:01] so I have to read it from there because
[3:20:03] there are some you said in your prayer a
[3:20:05] little bit ago sparked that and it is so
[3:20:08] true it was like stop dwelling on past
[3:20:11] events and brooding over time's gone by
[3:20:15] I am doing something new
[3:20:19] it's springing up
[3:20:23] can't you see it and that was a question
[3:20:26] can you see it and I could see it just
[3:20:30] that day
[3:20:33] I am making a road in the desert rivers
[3:20:38] in the Wasteland
[3:20:41] Hallelujah
[3:20:45] [Applause]
[3:20:55] I failed to read it in this scripture in
[3:20:57] the verse that I heard it in the cjb I
[3:21:00] read the other versions and it just
[3:21:03] didn't make like this one did for that
[3:21:05] scripture it just didn't for me
[3:21:09] I I praise the Lord is that the complete
[3:21:12] Jewish Bible you're reading your brother
[3:21:13] Dr Stern oh that's wonderful wonderful
[3:21:17] wonderful wonderful wonderful
[3:21:21] it's Isaiah 43 18-19 wonderful wonderful
[3:21:27] wonderful God used him God used him he
[3:21:31] was in our meetings in Jerusalem God
[3:21:33] used him for that complete Jewish Bible
[3:21:35] he just went home to be with the Lord
[3:21:37] just a few months ago now about two
[3:21:39] months ago but but God really used him
[3:21:42] he was a Hebrew scholar and he makes
[3:21:44] that live there are certain places that
[3:21:46] really that that's so beautiful I don't
[3:21:49] why don't you read it again yes sir

[3:21:56] brooding over time's gone by yes to all
[3:21:58] of us
