Description:
You were born with a divine purpose connected to God's kingdom. Even if you're running from it, God knows exactly where to find you—and He can outrun anyone.
Knowing who God is changes everything. It reveals who you serve and what He's capable of. You weren't born to be your own person—you're here to glorify your Creator.
Following Jesus means laying down your will for His. When you do, He fills you with the Holy Spirit and fire in your heart. The end times are here, and what God does in our hearts must impact a desperate world that needs what we carry.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But I want you to know there's a power that's bigger, that's more potent than anything that we could experience in our everyday life. &gt;&gt; And we need him. It's not an it. We need him. &gt;&gt; We need to know that he's there. And we need to know that we've surrendered &gt;&gt; to our purpose. You were born for a reason. &gt;&gt; You were born with a why. I would guess that your why has something to do with the kingdom of God. And you may be running in another direction today, but I want you to know God can run faster than anybody. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IF YOU WERE TO MAKE YOUR BED in hell, I know where to find you. &gt;&gt; If you were TO TAKE THE WINGS OF A DOVE AND TRY TO FLY away from my presence, I know exactly how to bring you right down when I'm ready to do something for you." Brother Shelley, is it important to know who God is? You're mighty right. It's important to know who he is. And if you don't know who he is, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU SERVE. &gt;&gt; And you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE of doing. And you don't understand what he requires out of you. I PROMISE YOU THIS MORNING, you're not here to be your own man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not here to be your own woman. You're here at this time for a purpose and for a reason, and that is to glorify God, your creator. SO WHY DON'T WE SURRENDER? WHY DON'T WE SURRENDER TODAY? Why don't we make UP OUR MIND? I'M NOT going to live another ordinary day on planet Earth serving sin and self, BUT I'M GOING TO SERVE the living God, the creator of all mankind, the only one that promises something beyond the grave. To feel his heart, to feel his heartbeat, TO KNOW THAT HE HAS A MIND, to know that he has a will, TO KNOW THAT HE HAS A PURPOSE for us in these last days. Brother, that's why I get out of bed every morning is to give him everything I have. He's worthy of it. In order to do so, Jesus said, "If you're going to come after me, you're going to have to deny yourself. You're going to have to be delivered from your own selfishness, and you're going to have to follow me." Now, when we were not serving the Lord, we were selfish. And some of us, even though we uh, you know, play serving the Lord, we're still selfish. And God said through Jesus in this scripture, if you're going to follow me, you're going to have to deny yourself. And nobody really likes the concept. But I want you to know, if you're willing to lay down your will and take his will, he'll fill you with his love divine. &gt;&gt; He'll fill you with the Holy Spirit. He'll put a fire down in your heart and he'll lead your footsteps and direct your life and you can live in his favor and in his pleasure. &gt;&gt; It's not about living to the church. It's about living unto him. &gt;&gt; But the end is UPON US. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE AGES is breaking forth in this hour. &gt;&gt; And the world is more insane and matter and wilder than it's ever been. And the heathen will continue to rage. And what happens out there, IT MUST NOT AFFECT WHAT happens in here. But what God does for us in here, IT MUST CERTAINLY AFFECT WHAT'S HAPPENING out there. And the ONLY WAY IT CAN IS for us to take this with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not our for and no more. And it's not the boundaries of the four walls of this church that we're concerned about. It's getting this life outside this building. &gt;&gt; Amen.
