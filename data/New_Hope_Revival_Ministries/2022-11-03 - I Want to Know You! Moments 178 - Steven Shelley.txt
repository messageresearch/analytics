Description:
The Bride of Christ is entering an unprecedented spiritual season of change.  No longer will she just know His way, but she will know Him in His beauty, love Him because of who He is; God Sovereign and Supreme.  
“Who will ascend the hill of the Lord?”  None other than those who have a pure heart and clean hands.”  Our hearts become pure by the washing of the Water of His Word.  It is about understanding what He has done on our behalf and keep ourselves spotless.  He will come to save us, but we must come up to where He is, and become one with Him in spiritual union.
