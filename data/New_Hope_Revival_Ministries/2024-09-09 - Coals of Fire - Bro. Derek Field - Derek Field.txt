connection to to this family and I'm so appreciative of that we wanted try to get it in before camp meeting and and and the Lord knew exactly what it was going to take brother Derek field you will know right away that he's not originally from Minnesota now the people in Minnesota they talk funny enough but his accent is it's further away farther away than Minnesota uh he's lived in this country long enough to talk like a hillbilly but he doesn't he visited us 12 weeks ago when his son graduated from the first part of his training and my family has reminded me multiple times since then that I harassed him from the pull pit a firsttime visitor they insisted that I apologize and I have profusely there was something happening that morning and we had a connection and he and his lovely daughter came for the for the last part of the graduation his son has gone home to be with the rest of the family and our brother decided that they would linger a couple of days in the planning and be with us this morning I had great fellowship with him yesterday and uh later in the evening that that sweet amen of the Lord came and we knew that he was supposed to minister to us today so we prepare our hearts right now to hear the word of the Lord and he's going to sing for us but I want you to just join in agreement with me in prayer for our brother right now father we thank you for the servant of the Lord who has many years of faithful service to you and a Godly Heritage Lord behind him you have it's not by accident or by coincidence that you brought him here and with his family to visit us and we are grateful that once again he is able to be with us today Lord we honor the gift of God in his life we know it is you that has called him and it is you that has equipped him and we pray for him right now that that he would feel strong in every way and that he would feel Liberty to minister to us according to what you have placed in his heart Lord anoint our faith to pull on him and that we would get the most out of our limited time together we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask this amen amen amen amen aren't you

something that would draw us one step closer to you yes that would strengthen us for one step more of your journey that you've got us on that we could encourage each other in love and peace amen we ask in Jesus name yes amen amen and feel free to take your seats so I I told the brother I'd sing a song so we got a guitar we're going to find out some things this morning brother yeah just the microphone will be fine um brother Shel told me that he gets inspired to sing what when he hears bad singing and when he hears good singing that's right so I'm hoping between one of the two you'll find a little inspiration in this so amen how far will the cable take me okay prise the Lord no I'll just do this praise the Lorden ah well you know the right balance in anything that you do in life is you got to you got to trust in God Amen that he's going to cover your weaknesses but you you've also got to be aware of your weaknesses so if you're overconfident and you're like you go out you're going to fail and if you're not confident enough you know but I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength so um yeah hopefully this will be a blessing this world is so it just makes me cry Lord God do you see all this sin it's opposed to each word that you wrote in your book no faith only filth deep with it I'm longing today for Jesus to come replace peace with in everywhere but before he returns oh my heart justs for I've got a brother out there while he may be the drunk at the bar or the businessman tied to his Des this brother of mine his Soul's like Divine but Satan's not giving him rest oh Lord give me strength show me the way to bring him your true love and care The Cry of my heart before iart is to find my lost brother out there that woman you see lying drunk on the street she looks like a mar disgrace is tormented Now by The Devils of hell and desperately needing God's grace he said he would come for those who were sick to bring them the physician care The Cry of my heart before iart is to find my lost sister out there while she made be the drunk at the bar or the businessman tied to her Des this sister of mine her Soul's like Divine but Satan's not giving her rest oh Lord give me strength oh show me the way to bring me her true love and care The Cry of my heart before I depart is to find my lost sister out [Music] there I've forgotten the last verse but I'm going to leave it there okay because here we are we're here for a purpose and the purpose is to shed God's love listen the reason you experience things the reason you go through trials is to learn something about God that's right and you're learning something about God not so that you can learn something about God you're learning something about God so you can share something about God that's right and uh I have this little thought on my heart that that I'm going to share feel encouraged about it because when uh when I was in the back room listening there though the one thing that I heard was the brother say uh May the coal of fire touch him you said that and I'm going to minister on coals of fire this morning so uh so we're going to start in Hebrews chapter 9 from verse 1 and we're going to trust that the Lord will be with us yes praise the Lord says then verily the first Covenant also had ordinance of of design service and a worldly Sanctuary right for there was was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick the table and the showbread which is called The Sanctuary yes and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had Manor yes sir and Aaron's Rod that budded in the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubims of Glory G shadowing The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God yes but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself yes and for the errors of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not not yet manifest while as the first Tabernacle was standing which was a figure for the time then present which in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse ordinances diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of the Reformation yes let's pray Heavenly Father we ask you to be with us bless your word yes sir you speak yes in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated so I know uh don't ever change unless God tells you to change okay as God puts it on your heart you're about the loudest noisiest church I've been in as far as your worship service goes that's fine don't ever change unless God puts it on your heart okay one thing you have to be is you have to be true to yourself amen and then let God change you into the image of Christ because otherwise you're changing yourself into an image that you have in your mind not the image that God has of you okay that's very important and so as we look at this we're going to see uh well I did a Bible study one time and I know you folks like uh Bible studies I know you like the uh Old Testament uh I know you've got in trouble apparently according to the pastor here for uh being too Jewish or looking at the Old Testament uh and that's fine with me you know like May May the worst of my enemies have that accusation against me that oh boy he's he likes the Bible too much especially that old Testament but we we're going to look in uh Exodus 25 because I started a Bible study years ago on uh the Tabernacle because every symbol in that every unveiling in that is something that is pertinent to us because a tabernacle is a dwelling place and we are the dwelling place of God okay and there's so much amazing things it's like for example this is amazing where was the Ark of the Covenant when Jesus was crucified it was not in the holiest place of all that's right it was lost what does that mean for us really interesting okay but we're not going to look at the Ark of the Covenant too much we're going to look at the cherubs because that's where I entered into this so in Exodus 25 it talks about uh the cherubims on the ark and that's um verse uh 18 and thou shalt make two cherubims of gold of beating work shal th make them in the two ends of The Mercy Seat thou shall make the Cherub on one end and on the and the other cherub on the other end even of The Mercy Seat shall you make the cherubs on the two ends thereof and the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall be one towards the other and towards The Mercy Seat shall the faces of the Char been be thou shalt put upon The Mercy Seat above upon the Ark in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give you amen and now and there will I meet with thee yes and I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat which are between the two cherubims which are upon the ark there shall I meet with thee and wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if we could say let me order my heart in such a way yeah let me have those things in my life in such a way that in the center of my life in that Holy Place dedicated to God those cherubims or their spiritual representation is there in such a way that God is pleased to say and I'm going to come and I'm going to meet with you there in your private time of prayer when you're out on the road when you're traveling that cloud that Pillar of Fire is going with you and God says I will meet with you there you know right and that's what we're aiming for amen okay but as I studied that we were looking at the chims and I'm like let's turn to uh Ezekiel and uh chapter one so as I was doing the study we started looking at the cherubims and this is really interesting okay how many wings did the cherubims have in Revelations six but in Ezekiel how many do they have four in the Tabernacle how many do they have two is it different creatures or is it an unfolding of a revelation where God says when I give you the law you can only fly as high as two Wings will take you [Music] when I bring you into the spirit and we bring into the realm of Prophecy now you can fly as high as six uh four wings can take you yeah and then when we end up we end up six wings and we're flying as high as we can in the spirit into the Realms of the Heavenly you see little things like that just fascinate me the unfolding mysteries of God and we can learn something in that in our lives and say Lord you know there's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and those things where we climb higher and higher into the realm can we recognize in our heart where we're at with our relationship with God and say is there a higher place for me that I can attain to Lord how can I live my life in a way come on that will allow your grace to come down to lift me into that higher place okay now a lot of that is not about how can I live my life in a way that will lift me no that's right it's about how can I live my life in a way that when God comes I'm prepared for him to lift me you see CU otherwise we're trying to force and push ourselves into the kingdom and that's not what it is sir it's waiting for God to lift us to a new place but let's let's look at this okay um verse five and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the soes of their feet was like the sole of a cast foot and that sparkled like the color of burnished brass and they had on the hands they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces in their wings and their wings were joined one to another you know and we could just drop down in depth on any one of these uh we're not going to cuz we're going to get to coals of fire okay and they went everyone straight forward they turned not as they went okay but let's let's read verse 13 as for the likeness of the living creature their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps and it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out out of the fire went forth Lightnings so I I got stuck on that word what is the appearance of burning coals now you all americ well are you all Americans most of you Americans yeah as American I'm actually American you know I took the oath of Legion summoned American citizen so when I grew up in England in the 1980s I remember I our house had a coal Burning uh furnace who else had a coal burning furnace who okay who else had coal deliveries a guy come around with a truck with a big coal bag of coal on his back you ever okay so all right so when I thought of coals I always thought coal you know guy you you throw it in the fire it burns all right it's coal but that's not the kind of Co we're talking about all right what's the kind of Co we're talking about wood who said wood 10 points okay it's wood coal all right but what does wood CO mean so I started looking into that how many people like to uh to grill to cook meat on Grill yeah any brother not waving his hand okay how many use gas grill how many use charcoal grill gas girls charcoal girls both yeah okay so the kind of coal that we're talking about that's actually charcoal the coal of fire it's wood that's turned into a coal and so I started talking uh looking into that and we can see its word because there's there's scriptures like uh Abraham when he said go and sacrifice your son make a burnt offering okay take and he took his son and he took the donkey and he took the wood car tied on the donkey and so the idea was you kill the sacrifice you put the wood under it you burn the wood okay and then watch charcoal and this this is a real blessing okay charcoal is wood you like this with all of the volatility and wetness burned out of it okay so when you've got wood it's got oils from the tree it's got moisture from the tree you put it on the fire and if it's a really wet piece of wood it smokes like anything okay you see yellow flames popping up what's that that's all of the oil that's all of the water being burnt out of the volatile stuff being burned out of and when all that's burned out you're left with a coals of fire that's it you're left with charcoal okay and I just H that really excited me because you know wood represents Humanity right okay and so if you're in service for God if you need to be that coal of fire like you need to be a piece of wood with all the volatility burnt out of it all right because charcoal Burns hotter than wood okay it's only got the carbon in it all right charcoal also Burns with no visible flame it just kind of glows that's right charal Burns consistently calls a fire you know if if you're um you you you can take charcoal you can spray water on it and it will just you know it'll hiss and then the it'll come back and it'll start burning again Burns consistently and charcoal burns with no smoke no pollution in that okay charos is one of the most historically valuable pieces of uh human civilization you know why anyone charcoal is the only thing until the discovery of coal and oil and electricity but charcoal is the only thing that burns hot enough to melt metal you can't forge and shape metal wow without charcoal well until you know modern times the invention of coal and so on so when we're talking about a sword being made when we're talking about a plow the tools that you need to to maintain to to bring life charcoal is is vital to that because nothing else Burns hot enough in fact there there was a really interesting uh true story I read about uh World War II and a Russian uh tanker unit in World War II that was uh they had us Sherman tanks and uh they were out uh you know fighting the war against the Germans and one of the pieces on the tank broke and one of the tankers was a blacksmith or had some metal working he went they got wood they put it into the blacksmith shop in the local Village and they got the Bellows they got it hot enough that they could Forge weld this piece of metal that had broken on the tank and put it back on the tank and keep going and he could do that with wood but not with wood just wood but you've got to reduce it down to those burning coals then put air on it now it's hot enough that you can actually melt and work metal okay so now we want to think that's quite something even says it in the scripture let's look in Isaiah uh chapter um 54 verse 16 all right it says behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fool for thy sake behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waster to destroy no weapon that is formed against the shall prosper you see amen and so you can see now that putting air on that heats the metal up hot enough that you can actually work him and that that's has has a really in okay let's turn to Proverbs chapter 25 verse 21 it says If thy enemy be hungry give him bread to eat eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink for Thou shalt heat coals of fire upon his head and the Lord shall reward thee what is a strange scripture if you think about it it's like I've got an enemy I'm going to be nice to him to Heap coals of fire on his head watch him Sizzle but it's not that it's not that it's I shall Heap those coals of fire upon his head watch him melt watch him become off so the Lord can change him and this is what we want to be we want to be the vehicles of God's change to others we want to be those people that you know how you you've got charcoal in the grill and you blow on it and and it heats up we want to be those people that God can blow on and just heats up and those that we come in contact with will be softened by that experience we'll be lit on fire by that experience you know that's what we want to be and how do we do that by becoming coals of fire not just dry pieces of wood but you need a dry piece of wood to create a coal of fire okay but the first thing you're going to get is a lot of that volatility coming out that yellow flame and I thought oh my goodness look at me when I get under a little pressure and I it's like what's that that's the vol ility coming out that's a sign that God is saying there's something in you I need to work on because that particular place I can't turn into a coal of fire that's useful because it's too volatile all right so we want to be useful for God so yes sir how many people know how charcoal is made anyone I looked you okay how's it made it's exactly right okay did did you all hear him okay so there used to be people whose job it was to make charcoal and and in England there's the charcoal burner pits in and so what you do is you take the wood you you stack it up and then you cover it completely in the dark you make sure there's just a little bit of uh ventilation you light fire to it and it burns and it smolders for days and days and days and you got to watch that fire because if too much air gets in it it catches fire and it will actually Destro so you're trying to burn off the volatility without burning out the carbon the charcoal it was a skill okay that died out probably 2300 years ago when um you know coal other sources of power were discovered so we make charcoal twice burnt in the dark with no air if you ever felt like you've been in the dark with no air everything everything's just burning up there's no light anywhere that you can see and you're just there suffering and you're like God I don't know why am I going through this what are you doing in me you have no idea all right maybe you get angry oh this is unfair I believed in you God and this is unfair and it's like okay that's fine God is like yeah that's just the volatility coming out needs to bake for a few more days okay because God has a purpose for you he has an end in mind for you and he has a process by which he is going to shape you into what you need to be it's not necessarily going to be nice and easy you might have to be in the dark burning with no air for quite a while but if you want to be a coal of fire you need to be twice burned twice burned all right twice burn burn once in preparation and once in service all right let's have a look in uh Exodus again chapter 2 we'll look at some of these people that have been twice burned you know the story of Moses but let's have a look at verse 11 I'm not going to do the whole thing it says but it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out to his Brethren and he looked on their burdens and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one of his Brethren oh and he was on fire for God okay he knew his mission how could he not he'd been brought up by his mother Moses you're here for a very special purpose Moses the deliver is coming Moses God has protected you Moses God has put you in the house of pharaoh Moses yeah yeah and Moses was like Now's the Time he Now's the Time I can build I'm 40 years old I've got the wisdom I've got the experience I've built everything that I need to do and we're going to start ourselves a nice little slave rebellion here okay we're going to find a way to do this the first thing I'm going to need to do is I'm going to need to win those hearts and Minds I'm no need so he goes out and he slay slays the Egyptian kills him hides him in the sand and it's like step one completed and nobody noticed all right and what was it it was Moses volatility coming out in that burning he was trying to do God's will yes on he had the right goal the right purpose in mind but he hadn't been twice burnt yet and so as he did this the fire that came out of him it was full of noxious fumes you know uh the charcoal burners people would die if you went over that pit because of all the impurities being burned out of the ground it was a dangerous unhealthy job like most jobs were back then okay and you could die from those fumes because it would burn out all the bad stuff just leave the carbon behind all right yeah and so here's Moses and he's burning and he's on fire and he's trying to do something for God and he's all all heated up and on fire and he goes out and and what comes out his fleshly volatility wow and because it came out in his flesh he said okay this thing is come known and he runs away and God leaves him baking in the wilderness till he's baked out all of the impurities and then he says to Moses Now's the Time to go now I baked out all of your volatility now you don't even want to go Now's the Time all right and so so let's let's turn over a few pages we won't do the whole story but let's turn over a few pages to Exodus 14 brother all right so lots of things happened to Moses I love the the phrase Moses was Meek above every man in the world you know what that means to be meek isn't to be like timid and shy to be is to be dependent on God yes to know that my strength is in God that's right okay and so here we are oh I love this you know um do you guys sing that song God any rivers you think are uncrossable okay I love that song all right uh there's a phrase there um God is the same his word is Dependable he'll make a way through the waters for you life situations by him are remendable right mountains and Hills he will part for you too okay life situations by him are amendable you know and that made me think of the Constitution of the United States of America and it was written and it was a good document but they got there and they're like hm that's a good document is a good foundation but there are some changes we want to make to that document and so we're going to get together and we're going to we're going to propose an amendment all right what situation do you have in your life where you would like to propose an amendment you know Lord I've read the terms and conditions of my life at the moment and I can see I'm suffering a little more than I'd like to I would like to propose an amendment okay all right the devil is going to vote nay we do not want that Amendment you're going to vote Yes I want that Amendment the deciding vote is God Amen he may say no at this time we're going to table that Amendment for a later date because I'm bringing you through something or you may say yes I will I that's a good Amendment let's do it okay and vote for the amendment but brother and sisters if you look at your life and you don't propose any amendments no one's ever going to vote on them on and if no one ever votes on them your life isn't going to change so here's Moses and the children of Israel God you know God loves The Impossible okay oh I love this God loves The Impossible all right so the first thing he says is okay how can I make this how can I make this impossible it's like I take a bunch of slaves out and I will lead them down into the desert where they're trapped by the hills that's pretty hard how will they get out I put the Egyptians behind them the most fearsome army in the world at that time I'll put the Egyptians behind them what else can I do to them I'll make them wait you know and I'll give Pharaoh blood lust for them and the Sea will be behind them the mountains will be in front of them the Chariots will be up there and there'll just be this cloud in the way like yeah now I like the odds because you know if I'd given them all swords and Spears and I I wouldn't like those odds yeah so verse 9 of Exodus 14 but the Egyptians pursued after them and all the horses and Chariots of pharaoh and his Horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the Sea beside pyro before bezon and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord they said unto Moses okay now look at this this is really interesting because this has applications for our situation as well okay the Lord did not choose a people that that were full of Faith all right he chose a people that were a people that had a few faithful people in it the Lord didn't choose disciples that were full of Faith okay you you want to know how to be in the Rapture just be close to God all right if you're a good friend of gods you could to be totally oblivious to anything going on like the disciples were oh Jesus told them I'm going to go to Jerusalem I'm going to die they're going to kill me but I'll rise again they're like yeah yeah that's good and the Bible says they were afraid to ask him what he meant it sounds really simple what did you mean why because God hid it from them why did God hide it from him to show us listen you don't have to understand it in order to get there you just have to be close to Jesus and so he rises from the dead and he appears to the women and they go down they tell the disciples we've seen Jesus and they're like yeah okay they weren't like wow praise God we've just been having a prayer meeting we know that's look at all the scriptures that have been fulfilled look at what's going on no they were like I don't believe you okay and eventually Jesus comes to them them they're like oh oh now we believe except Thomas and there's Thomas and he's like Thomas look the sisters told you they see Jesus right Peter and John went down they couldn't find his body at the empty tomb okay it's just starting to make sense to you Thomas and we all just saw him yeah he came to us it was amazing Jesus is alive he's risen from don't you remember he said stuff like that thas was like well are you trying to prank me except I put my fingers okay yes all right so how much Faith do you need yeah as much face as Thomas had yeah because Jesus said to him you know Thomas here I am come on fingers he didn't have to but you see that's the kind of Faith you need is just enough Faith as Thomas had because if you are with God he's going to take you through you see you don't need to be like all this mountain of faith and even if you are who was the person with the most faith in Jesus disciples that we would say we would say maybe Peter walking on the water no one else did that the most Faith what happened to Peter is the only one who had the deepest betrayal let's see why that God would stand in his grace and His glory not in your faith okay so just be close to God and love him amen so so that's the children of Israel in verse 13 Moses now he's a burning coal he's had all the volatility burned out of him and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still see the salvation of God which he will show you this day for the Egyptians whom you have seen this day you shall see them forever no more the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace Hallelujah why cuz now he was a burning coal praise God okay those changes didn't make him flare up situations didn't change his temperature he was just on fire for God and had that confidence and was in work for God praise the Lord but he had to be buried for 40 years in the dark with no hardly any air to turn him from the volatile into the burning coal that God can use and you may be on a similar place in your journey okay and we know that it's a continual work because we know when when Moses got to uh got to the rock for the second time oh you Rebels must we bring this water out of the rock for you and he smoked the rock what happened there was a little bit of volatility left in him that it flared up and God said to him for this you can't enter into the promised land which seems like a pretty harsh judgment but to whom much is given much is required okay and Moses was a bit upset about that you can see it in the scriptures cuz every time he talks to them he's like and there God told me I couldn't have entered because of you go read it in the scriptures you'll see him he's [Music] like okay we can talk about Jesus going through those same things going to the darkness of the Wilderness tempted of the devil before being put into service making sure that that volatility was burnt out absolutely but you see with us it's an ongoing process just as it was with Jesus because look before he went to Calvary for that service God said to him I'm going to need to make sure that you're purified again that's why brother randam says he died more in Gethsemane than he did on Calvary okay he went to another dark place he went through another fire he went through oh my brothers and sisters listen No One you don't know what Jesus did for you okay he said I'll never leave you or forsake you all right so your friends can forsake you but you'll have Jesus oh yes your family can forsake you but you'll have Jesus okay your work may go away accidents may happen but you'll have Jesus cuz he'll never leave you or forsake you you will always have that Comfort connection and Jesus was connected to God like no other man has ever been my father and I are one that was as close as he was connected and his friends left it but he was still connected with God his foes attacked him but he was still connected with God that intimate precious connection that said it doesn't matter what they do to me I'm connected with God but what he did for you was he said in this moment I will become disconnected from God yes yes yes you can only be as disconnected from somebody as you are connected to them right all right that's true if brother Shelly said Derek you're a horrible person I wouldn't take him very seriously I barely know him I like him but you know he might say that after this who knows all right but even if he were serious in doing that I it wouldn't hurt me much yeah because I I barely know him but if my wife said to me wow you're a horrible person I want to separate from you and all those years of love and closeness has just come to nothing that that would hurt all right that would hurt so you think about how much Jesus suffered when he said father why has Thou forsaken me the center of his being that relationship with God was taken away from him that he could become sin for you amen and that's that burning coal in action purified a light in service for God yeah but the nice thing about burning coals is they'll put other Co you know if you if you um if you put coals on top of burning coals they'll light the other coals right okay that heat will spread and it will light it in a way that doesn't produce more smoke and doesn't produce more fire because the volatility is been already being burnt out and so that's where we have the Holy Spirit coming well okay let's turn to Psalms 18 this is just wonderful well it's a wonderful I mean prise all right I will this is the kind of Psalm it's like how how do you pick a place to start and how do you pick a place to stop all right so but I'm going to pick a place to start the Lord let I will love the Lord he's my strength I'm in trouble he's coming down to deliver me and here's how he's coming he's not coming timidly into the situation he is coming to amend the situation all right he is coming in agreement with my prayer come on and has said yes to me Hallelujah and here he comes yeah all right in my distress I cried verse six in my distress I cried upon the Lord I Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple My Cry came before him even to his ears then the Earth Shook and trembled listen the foundations also of the hills were moved was shaken because he was the wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostril and a fire out of his mouth and coals were kindled by it what coals okay the coals of the hearts that were prepared for God to be in action yeah here comes his voice and burning coals okay so what are you being set on fire by does the voice of God produce a burning in you and that area that's purified prise okay Lord does the voice of God produce a burning in you that says here am I I'm getting hot yeah I'm getting lit on fire I'm ready to start moving for you I'm ready to be put into your service maybe I need to be put on the head of some hard unbeliever who deep down as a Christian that I need to melt through several layers of rock hard ice to get to that place okay cuz you know what the Lord doesn't care and you shouldn't care either what happens to you right you should care what happens to other people okay so if you're going through suffering you shouldn't be like Lord why am I suffering this is too hard you should be like Lord why am I suffering who is this helping what is this doing in my life okay may maybe you're suffering because your your your volatility is being burnt out but maybe you're suffering because you're on the head of someone hard and who needs to be melted you see and so just ah just keep yourself soft all right just keep yourself looking to Jesus okay the author and finisher of our faith he's going to start it he's going to finish it and he's our example what did he do in those situations where people were against him he continued in the love of God he did okay you don't have a clock in here do you no I got a watch so that's good okay so I'm just checking on the time um all right uh let's have a look at this this is really wonderful cuse of fire in service for God all right um let's turn to Leviticus chapter 16 and it's it's a chapter that talks about the day of atonement that talks about you know Jesus saving us the scapegoat the different symbols that are on it okay and it talks about okay we need to apply this to our lives okay so incense is prayers of the Saints very good okay so intense is are prayers all right let's have a look at incense for a moment verse 11 yes and Aaron shall bring the bulock of the sin offering which is for himself shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the bulock of the sin offering which is for himself okay so this is happening in the outer court right okay the altar of sacrifice then he says and he shall take a sensor full of burning coals from off the altar before the Lord so he's going to take those coals from out of the altar of offering burnt offering and he's going to take them into the inner place right into the place of prayer now and in his hands full of sweet incense being small to bring it within the veil and he shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord and The Cloud of the incense May cover The Mercy Seat that is upon the testimony that he die not right all right so we can talk about the incense and the prayers and we have to cover ourselves with prayers it's still true you know it's still true but this is that new thing that I told you about well I told you I had something new this is really good okay listen when you grill with charcoal which in my opinion is the nicest way you know other people may different that's all right and you you've got let's say a hamburger and it's you know like 80% fat and you put it on there or you got a steak or a sausage or whatever you put on your grill what happens as part of that cooking process is the fat inside turns to oil and then it drips down on the grill and then you get flares up okay and then you take a bottle of water and you spray it or you close the lid and make sure because you don't want that burn flavor on you you know what I'm talking about right okay think of this when you have a coal of fire it doesn't produce that flare of itself you know what is burning is what has been put on it there's nothing of itself being burned because that volatility has already been burnt out so look at this oh we are we are the wood we are the sacrifice we come with the prayers what prayers are we offering we're going to put something and smoke is going to come up if we have been properly purified and we are true calls of fire nothing of ourselves is going to flare up and Flame up and contaminate the incense and get in the way of what God is trying to do he's going to put on our heart here's the prayer that you can pray for somebody and we say let that burning coal let that incense fall on me and just reflect back into heaven nothing of myself is going to flare up and Flame so everything returned to you is just what you gave me there's nothing of myself in there and that's where we need to be in our prayers to say Lord ah there's nothing of myself in here but how often do we pray and there's something of ourselves yes how often do we pray and James says that he says you you you ask and you receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it on your own lusts right right and your own lusts aren't necessarily oh Lord give me a million dollars or oh Lord do this or do that it's just those us come on just those little things that are are missed they're missing from the from the the word of God it's okay you know sin and archery yeah Archer sin is the term for archery that's how I I actually took up archery recently um we went a place I got a bow and I'm died it's kind of fun all right but a sin is I'm aiming at a place right and I didn't hit the place that I aing this is a sin all right um when when we drove home from here uh back 12 weeks ago we went through Chicago area we hit the tollways and they they don't have the gates anymore I've been through them once before and they have the signs up that say go here to pay online I was like okay I got to remember to go and pay online um of course we were traveling 2 3 days I forgot and last week I got a notice Illinois toway please pay the $10 that you owe for no excuse me it was the $18 that you owe for the tollway or whatever it was and the $10 admin fee that it cost you to go you know for us to send you this letter all right now that was a sin if you like I missed I forgot I still had to pay the consequence it wasn't something something I did deliberately it's not an iniquity where you say I am deliberately going to do this all right and so here's what we're looking at when we say consume on our own lust it's not saying I am deliberately going to pray that um you know brother Wesley gets paint on his shoes cuz he got paint on my shoes you know okay that that would that's a bad prayer right that's my own lust Revenge you know what I mean there it is but that's not what we're talking about those things are easy to recognize when you're praying In the Flesh what we're looking at is saying there is a mark of the prize of the high calling that I'm aiming for consistently let the words of my mouth the meditation of my heart be accept I'll give you an example okay this is how easy it is I was talking to a brother one time and he was sharing some problems and I started ministering to him and and as I ministered to him I realized that I was a channel and the words I was saying didn't come from me all right they came from the Holy Spirit to him praise God may we all be I carried on talking and then a few minutes later I realized that the words even though they sounded very much like the words I'd said before the words were coming from me not from the Holy Spirit that's a sin that's my own lust that's my own conceit and it switched from there to there cuz you could bring a problem to me and I'm a fairly smart guy and I'm a fairly experienced guy and I could give you some advice and it could ruin your life even though it sounds good and sounds holy because it's not what God said okay and so what we're looking for is saying when we pray it's got to be what God has given us the words that God has given us not our own and to do that you need to be a coal of burning fire with all that volatility burn out of you that you've spent your time in that dark place okay that you've been purified yeah that the sacrifices that are going up to heaven cuz the same thing happened with the sacrifices you know it's interesting that the um the Lord said give me the sacrifice give me the fat of the sacrifice as well right and you can imagine that burning and the fat dropping down onto that wood and the flaring up to heaven but it's flaring up to heaven with the fat of the sacrifice not with the volatility of the wood okay so what are you you're sacrificing to God how are you offering it is it with that volatility that comes from you or is it just what God has given you to offer these are the things we should consider oh my and say Lord when I look at my life yes when I see these things all right have I been purified when the coal of fire touched the prophet oh yeah yeah took a a living coal aive coal that Amber glowing Cal yes looks like it's not even burning you you know what I mean okay and that's what we should be in our day-to-day lives we shouldn't be jumping up and down screaming shouting praise the Lord hallelujah there's a time for that I'm not saying that's wrong but most of the time what happens I remember lovely well so there was a brother he just got saved he was sitting in the church and I was sitting in the church and someone was preaching and I noticed every time the Pastor said amen this brother said amen okay cuz he didn't want to say Amen to anything that the pastor didn't say Amen to what's that he's learning in baby steps okay he's in the early stages of that that his s being brought out there nothing wrong with that but what we're looking at saying is this okay okay what I say what I do is it God flowing through me have I been purified amen am I on fire to God when I explode in Praise is it something coming from inside me that's of my own lusts yeah or is it something coming from the Holy Spirit dropping that down and I'm returning it without anything of self inside okay and you know these things listen the Seal of God has this the Lord knows who are who are his right okay there's no way you can good yourself into the kingdom of God there's no way you can bad yourself out of the kingdom of God that's right okay all you're looking at saying is can I be a servant a coal of fire that's bringing warmth to others that's lighting the life of others that's melting others that's just returning to God what he drops down on me whether it's a sacrifice whether it's a prayer I'm not I'm not returning to him from my own volatility but just from that purified whatever he drops on me I can return to him in praise and glory in prayer in Thanksgiving in a way that says I am the kind of piece of wood that can bend metal and shape it into shapes tools that God needs Mount the heart of the cold Stony hearted people Jesus yes so I'd like to encourage you today whatever you're going through yeah whether it's dark and and no air whether you can't see a way out stay faithful the Lord is purifying you for a purpose he has for you l amen okay don't get discouraged well if you do get discouraged don't worry about it okay there are times when you know Christians aren't always happy all right but Christians always have that connection with Jesus Christ the center of your life amen and he's the one that will Purge you and burn out all those impurities that you can be a coal of fire that God can use in his service amen let's pray praise the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and we thank you for your word thank you for the things that you show us out of there Lord if I've said anything of my own vanity and my own lusts Lord let it come to your light but Lord the truth that you've spoken let it sink down into our hearts Hallelujah bring forth the thing that you would ordained for it to bring forth in this day may we be bright burning coals just quietly glowing for you yes sir just burning with the fire when you breathe on us heating up as you need us to not being hot when you don't need us to always ready to return the sacrifice that you give to us to you without any of ourselves Purge us Lord burn on in our hearts we thank you for your goodness and your blessings ask these things in Jesus name amen yes God bless you amen amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus [Applause] [Music]
