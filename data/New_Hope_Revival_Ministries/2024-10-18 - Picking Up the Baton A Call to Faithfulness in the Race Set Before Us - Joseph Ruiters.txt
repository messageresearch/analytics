In this powerful message, Bro. Joseph Ruiters is challenging us to recognize the vital role of the Holy Ghost baptism as our key to victory in the Christian walk. He urges us to reflect on how we may have dropped the baton of our spiritual heritage, losing sight of our foundation and compromising on the truth of God's Word. Using the metaphor of a relay race, Bro. Ruiters calls us to go back to where we stumbled, pick up the baton, and remain faithful to the original message. He challenges us to stand firm in our faith, without compromise, and stay true to the fullness of God's Word. It's a call to realign ourselves with His purpose and run the race set before us.
