would you give the Lord another handcraft of praise [Applause] isn't he wonderful aren't you glad you're here on a Saturday night I mean honestly when I was a boy in the Holiness Church they used to say well wouldn't you rather be here than the finest Hospital well that's a that's a crazy question I don't believe there's anybody here would rather be in a hospital uh or what you know they say things like that I never did quite understand that but if they would ever say or is there anywhere else you'd rather be than where you are right now I I can relate to that there's nowhere I'd rather be than with you gather together with him on a Saturday night I'm old enough to remember when they called Saturday night the devil's night that's what the old-timers used to say because people would get into trouble how many of you believe it's Jesus is not tonight and tomorrow night and the next night every day is it belongs to him well I'm a little prejudiced but I think we have the finest music the finest musicians the most dedicated uh group that you'll find anywhere in the world would you thank God for them tonight [Applause] God bless you all thank you turn in your bibles if you will to Mark chapter 7. I want to read tonight beginning in verse 24. and I know that technically we could leave here tonight and say we have been in the presence of the Lord and wasn't it good and and we could go home early and rest be ready for tomorrow but God's not finished so so we better stick this out now some of you visitors you may think I just have to have my part well you don't know me very well because I would much rather just worship like we have worshiped tonight but I believe that we have a responsibility for the word to take preeminence Among Us and I don't mean the page I mean the Living Word he lives in you and I as a part of the bride of Christ so thank you for standing while we're reading the scripture you're going to be sitting a while I would assume and so thank you if you're able Mark chapter 7 and verse 24 and from then she arose and went into the borders of tire and sidon and he entered into a house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid can anybody relate to those words this evening and he just a tad in the monitor he could not be hid the next verse for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet I want you to notice something about this woman the woman was a Greek she was a syrophoenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter her daughter wasn't necessarily present but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs I want you to know that was a pretty tough answer she was Greek she was cyrophoenician she lived she hailed from phenicia meaning she was a gentile she was of the nation she was not a Jew she had no right none and she knew that and even when the Lord insulted her she answered and said unto him yes Lord I don't have any power to argue with you for everything you say is the truth I'm just a dog but the dogs under the table in the Master's crumbs [Applause] how many of you like her faith come on let's finish it and he said unto her for this saying because you said the right thing go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter [Music] I want you to look at verse 30 and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed I know you've been standing a while but would you go with me to Matthew quickly chapter 15. verse 21 through 28 this is Matthew's telling Matthew is the detailed one and I want to get him in here too then Jesus went thence verse 21 and departed into the coast of tire and sadon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil she used a Messianic term something that a gentile had no rights two let's go on but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said I am not sins but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she foreign he insults her he tells her she's the wrong race she basically is told your skin is a little dark you're not a part of this Covenant I am sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and she comes without an argument and she begins to worship him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table and then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is my faith Mark Mark said he said because you say the right thing Matthew said because you have great faith be it under thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole when did it start from that very hour let's pray together again father we are not gathered here tonight to see one another as wonderful as that is we are not here to Fellowship in the natural as wonderful as that is but we are here tonight to sit in your presence to tell you that you are God's Sovereign and supreme that you are a faithful Lord and that you hear all of our cries and you see all of our needs we have come tonight to raise up the truth of your word it is more to us than a printed page it has become a living reality now talk to us talk to us tonight there's probably not a person in this room that hasn't heard this story I preached some of these same things four years ago and others some were here and have heard some of these things deny but it was you by the holy spirit that took me here today when I had prepared something entirely different Lord I trust you even when I don't understand I trust you so I'm asking you to come tonight and say Amen to your word and heal the sick among us deliver the oppressed among us as they sit under the Living Word in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we pray and the saint said you may be seated tonight The Book of Mark identifies this woman is the syrophoenician meaning from phenicia a nation Northwest of the borders of Israel she was a Greek in religious practice and probably she spoke the broken Greek language she was most certainly a gentile Matthew tell this tells us that she was a descendant of Canaan and Canaan was a cursed race so we know that she was living under the stigma of being a descendant of the son of Noah that was cursed however she was a woman with a desperate need the burden of her pain was not for herself but for her daughter what which the scripture identifies the Affliction as being vexed with the devil in other words this daughter was under the power of Satan are you with me Mark 7 25 said when she heard of him you see the Miracles were were being spread around and the testimonies were getting around and and people were beginning to hear that everywhere he went Miracles were following and noise was accompanying The Gatherings and things that had never been seen before were being seen before and Jesus had made up his mind he was going on a little holiday the Bible if you read the detail of all the tellings of this story you will find that he needed to pull away from the pressing crowd and from the constant pool of the people he desired not to retire but to retire to get his strength renewed to be ready to finish the commission that his father had sent him to complete and so he finds a place that he can go just outside the border of the land of Israel he goes just upside just just to the north of the border of his where he can find some rest but the news had already begin to spread that the master the Healer the one that's causing all the disturbances in Israel has come to the coast of our town he is staying in a house just down the street and this woman says oh now it's my chance now it's my opportunity I didn't know how I would ever get way down to Jerusalem I didn't even know how I would be able to travel as far down as the Galilee but all he has come to my town he didn't know why he was there she didn't know come [Applause] know that he had come for a holiday I don't think it would have mattered very much all she knew is that for some reason the one that could help her had come to visit her town oh and she said I gotta go I gotta go and find out what all this is about she had great faith that God was going to do something for her are you with me tonight her daughter was vexed with the devil and yet she never said have mercy on my daughter she said have mercy on me any parent understands that pain when our children suffer we suffer with them there's nothing any more debilitating than to see your child in a problem or in a need and even when they get old enough to leave the house and you see them in such turmoil and such anguish and you feel so hopeless and so helpless and you can't do like you used to do and pick them up and kiss their boo-boo and tell them it's going to be all right all you can do is go to the Lord and so she made up her mind I'm not going to miss my opportunity I'm not going to let this chance Pass Me By he's in my neighborhood for a reason and I'm going to find him Mark said when she got there she fell down at his feet in the message perseverant paragraph 79 brother random said this woman that we are talking of this syrophoenician woman she was a Greek she had heard about Jesus now Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God and she had heard that's all it took just the the power the prophetic power of a testimony hear me now the prophetic power of a testimony somebody told somebody who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody what the Lord had been doing now where do you fit in that because there's nobody can tell your story [Music] everybody wants to tell their story to the preacher let me tell you something there's a world that's dying yeah and like granny used to say going to hell in a handbasket and they need somebody to tell their testimony they need to hear what Jesus is doing I know some of you saw that little post that that Jonathan made in our private uh Facebook and he mentioned the fact that we're what what is the anniversary 62 years tonight 62 years tomorrow brother random preached for the first time in Tucson at the Grant Avenue Assembly of God Church that later became the Tucson Tabernacle a brother who was going to that church who had heard of the ministry of brother Branham and what God was doing in his ministry he was building the stairs there's a roar up here he was building the stairs and working on the threshold of of the building the Assembly of God Church where he attended waiting on someone where's all my sound folks so he was down there with a nail and a hammer and he was working on the threshold of the Assembly of God Church and he laid his hand and he said Lord I just asked one thing of you this is where I go to church I love these people I'm learning more than they have learned and I'm asking you for one favor I'm asking you to bring the prophet of God across this threshold and let him preach in that pulpit and bring that message to my church foreign had not ever been invited to Tucson and it looked like that the churches had kind of made an alliance among themselves and they were going to do what they could to keep him out of town just like you saw in the chosen there were towns that wanted what he had and there were towns that would rather be left alone anybody following what I'm saying but this brother said this is what we need and because of that man's prayer God heard that prayer and the invitation was given and and brother Branham went and guess what the first message he preached was expectations I think it was on a Sunday morning and guess what he preached Sunday night Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever I have come tonight to tell you that if you have come with expectation Jesus Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he's always the same what he did then he can do today what he did in Galilee he can do right here tonight what he did in the 50s he can do that tonight because he's the same God if you believe that I want you to squeeze out a little help oh yes she came to acknowledge to the master that she believed the report that she was hearing 15 22 of Matthew said she Cried unto him saying now that word cried in the Greek does not mean she said master listen master help me please sir if you don't mind all reverently you know oh I've got a need do you think you could help me no no that word means scream cry out exclaim shout and even flail I'm right here yeah that's it that's it that's it the disciples are walking along behind him they know he's nervous they know he needs a rest and they've got him like bodyguards do you have an appointment they're ready to protect him and keep him somebody's got to somebody had to keep him because remember God became man God was living in a body of Flesh 100 God 100 man anybody following me he got wore out his nerves got bad he got tired he had aches and pains someone said I can't believe that then you don't believe what the book said the book said he was in all manner tempted as we are yet without sin the Bible said though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered you do believe the book don't you and so the disciples were and and they were telling everybody that would they would hear people say that's him that's him that's him and the disciples were like this But Here Come a woman who didn't know the protocol she didn't know anything about church order she was a gentile one of them all dirty Gentiles that don't know anything about the way to Worship in the temple she knew it's her daughter was grievously mixed with the devil and she needed some help so she just threw herself down at his feet and she began to scream out have mercy on me oh Lord oh Adonai thy son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil she said have pity have mercy on me she didn't care who was listening she didn't care about the disciples going shh the Master's resting the Master's weary oh she didn't care about all that all she could see was that daughter at home frailing around rolling around on the floor pulling her hair out by the handful vexed by a devil tormented by demons no Freedom no liberty no resemblance of a normal life that's all she could think about it didn't matter to her how it was supposed to be done all she needed all she knew was I need to get his attention I've got to let him know that among this community one at least one who believes the testimony that I've been hearing and I believe he is who they say he is and I want him to help me I love that kind of Faith don't you she was interceding for her daughter and she must have loved that daughter very much she had no claim on Jesus as the son of David it was very offensive to the Jews for a gentile to use the Messianic term thou son of David who are you to David what claim do you have you talk about Prejudice in this day I want you to know in that hour there was great prejudice maybe you've caught a glimpse of that if you've seen the chosen series maybe you've caught a little glimpse of the Prejudice the religious you have no right to be here and this is how this woman had been treated and how many people were being treated in that day because many of the Jews had lost their real connection with their faith and they were just going through the motions just doing what they had been taught to do with no real sincerity of Faith you know what it took some Gentiles getting in there turning Church order upside down you know what we need in our churches we need a few that don't know nothing about church order [Applause] we need some that haven't been reading their whole life in the Cod book we need some who just say I only know one thing I need help and you're the one you're the one who can help me we need some of that we need some of that but this proves that she had some perception of who he really was or she would have never used this exclusive Messianic title this was never to be used about the king it was never to be used about the priest it was never to be used about any of the other Faith leaders or spiritual leaders it was only to be a term used to describe and to address the Messiah when he came here was a gentile who knew very little about the Jewish faith yet she borrowed the title that she had heard because something resonated in her heart I believe he is I believe he is I believe he is who he says I do too brother and even if it was only based on stories and testimonies that she had heard she came with all the faith that she could muster she cried out to him she began to talk to him and the Bible said in Matthew 15 verse 23 he answered her not a word I hope you're listening somebody said what are you preaching tonight I'm preaching insulted and tested but been delivered insulted and then test it but delivered you want me to give you a subtitle there's no room for your feelings [Music] the prophet of God said what do feelings have to do with him don't you come telling somebody what you feel your feelings are no no more no more important than my feelings somebody said you're giving bad marital advice I'm not talking about husbands and wives you better respect one another's feelings I'm talking about when you approach the law when you come when you come and ask for prayer nobody wants to hear your feelings they want to hear your faith my feelings say I have no hope my feelings say oh every time that the angel comes and troubles the water I don't have anybody to put me in that's what your feelings will say but faith says but I Don't Need No Angel troubling the water because I see who I see [Applause] I Know Who You Are you've got more to give me than the angel that come and travel the water if he only knew if he only realized if you only could recognize who was standing before him how many of you are following me now good very glad in fact she calls out she throws herself on the ground she screams she flails she says Thou son of David have mercy on me and he just keeps walking what do you think she did I wasn't there I don't want to add to the word but I think she got louder and you know what she did it all without without so much offense that she didn't pick her things up pick her purse back up that she'd throw it on the ground and said I'm going home because the preacher won't speak to me they've got all the Time in the World to listen to her prayer request but have you noticed when I go to get mine they cut me off [Music] I bet if it was him texting he'd get an answer in the next few minutes I may not hear nothing at all come on all the things that get in our way did you notice when brother Shelley was calling out the prayer warriors names he left mine out it's so easy to get offended it's so easy to carry a fence it's so easy and let me tell you something the only hope she had ignored her he just just kept walking that was the best thing he did that was the nicest thing he did because he was going to talk to her he was going to offend her may I suggest to you that sometimes the only way that the true issues of the heart can be revealed is for the mind to be offended can I maybe say to you that the only way sometime our faith can be placed in the right thing it's when we're offended in our feelings and we quit looking to people to meet our need [Applause] well I went to the counselor and he said I was the problem come on bend it I'm never going back I took him over there took my wife over there because I thought for sure he was going to tell her she was the problem he looked right at me and told me I was a problem and I'm not going back to him because he don't have enough sense to counsel if he was a real counselor he'd know she's the problem you see how people get so quickly offended oh have mercy on me thou son of David for my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil and he just kept walking and she kept crying after them how do we know because the disciples said Lord would you just tell her to go home we need you to help us out send her away because she keeps on crying after us their sympathies were exhausted their sensibilities were exhausted their kindness had been exhausted the truth is the disciples were tired of people and I don't see a whole lot of compassion in what they said can't you just tell her to go home she won't leave us alone she cries after us Jesus didn't give that woman one little Reason for Hope but she would not settle for discouraging silence she would not settle for being ignored she would not take no for an answer she refused to let her only hope just keep walking up the hill anybody with me in the message perseverance paragraph 154 and 155 you don't have to stop and do that read that do you know but I want to oh yeah he just ignored her he looked at her and he walked on I just want you to know I'm not taking too much license in adding to the story he just looked at her and he walked on oh my he was a little more than our modern Pentecost my turned up there there's and walked back and said I don't have to do that I want you all to read the next sentence it's in it's in white read the next sentence for me I want to be that woman I want to be that man I want to be that person that refuses to allow my feelings to keep me from putting my faith where my faith belongs my faith is not in preacher my faith is not in men my faith is not in brother Branham my faith is in the Lord Jesus Christ and I refuse to be so offended that I let my faith be misplaced I refuse to sit in the corner and lick my wounds and feel sorry for myself and let my only hope walk away I cannot let him walk away amen she didn't say how dare he ignore me she just kept crying Jesus Yeshua thou sudden David have mercy on but not that woman she had faith she stayed right there paragraph 155 now she went after him again be in my neighborhood today may be my only chance I can't go home and come back in the morning and hope that it'll be any different oh Lord can I just have and she wasn't thinking about what she had come through this is so important all right she wasn't thinking about how hard it had been she wasn't thinking about what she would have to go through the only thing we're reading on now the only thing she knowed she believed if she could get him to say so oh folks I don't want to get ahead of myself but it wasn't what he said the Bible said it was what she said [Applause] I'll read that again to you in just a moment the only thing she knows she believed that she could just get him to say so that's all she needed to know if he would say so she knowed it wasn't working on others why wouldn't it work on hers now this was her faith she needed to get his attention the disciples wanted to send her away they were looking for some peace and quiet and when he finally answered her she would not hush Matthew had a headache Peter he was ready to body slam her they had had enough of this silly woman yes I'm not trying to over exaggerate I'm just trying to tell you it takes somebody like that do you know it takes an irritant to produce a pearl [Music] did you know it takes somebody sometime to keep knocking one of the most famous sermons Jack Cole ever preached was keep knocking but he won't answer keep knocking but either he didn't come when I wanted him to keep knocking I know he's in there I can hear the music but he refuses to come to the keep knocking [Music] when he does finally talk he offends her again by saying I am not sent but to the Lost house Matthew 15 24. I am not sent but under the lost lost sheep of the House of Israel this woman had to Cast Away her Pride she had to remain humble she couldn't care what other people thought about her but she had to make her need known Matthew 15 25 said then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me to worship means to bow down kneeling before or prostrate oneself in adoration she called him Lord which is the word Master which is a title of respect and honor one who is in supreme authority when she addressed him as Lord she was saying to him I know that you have all authority if I go back like this I will find my daughter exactly as I left her but if I can get you to hear me speak to my need Everything Will Change in the message perseverance Dallas paragraph 105 he said now at first she called him son of David she as a gentile had no claims on him as the son of David that would not have moved him it further irritated and agitated the disciples but when she said Lord my Lord my Lord Lord of all Lord of all circumstances Master over all diseases Master over all my problems Master over all my fears Master over all my worries when he when she called him Lord he was her Lord she acknowledged him as her master and I want you to know something changed but you wouldn't know it by what he said in Mark 7 27 about that time he said let the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs in her mind she must have been thinking but I saw something in his eye when I called him Lord I saw something in his face when I called him Lord I thought he was about to minister to my knee when I called him Lord but now he tells me that healing belongs only to the children and that it is not in order for the healing for the for the bread to be thrown to the Gentile dogs a Canaanite a woman of a cursed race it was not meat it was not proper it was not in order to do such a thing as that it wasn't proper and dogs unlike today where they're nearly worshiped in our society people who can't pay their own bills will spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on their animals I know how attached we can get I know how wonderful they can be and how they can Comfort us but there comes a time that we realize we can't afford to keep doing what we're doing in the Bible No Such Thing took place they were unclean animals they were not to be eaten they were unclean animals and they were not treated in the same especially among the Israelites they were not treated as they are today in the message respects 1961 brother Branham said not only turned her down on her request but called her a dog and a dog is one of the lowest names the Bible has you know in that culture Jesus didn't use the kind of term for dog that means of Royal lineage or a bloodline of Fame he used the common diminutive form of the term dogs and that's why in the Amplified it uses the phrase little dogs a great Bible a theologian or or a linguist one who studies the original language of the Bible he said Jesus softened the force of the expression with his use of the word that would be translated little dog clearly his reference was to a household pet which while not children in the house yet they did had a have a place as an affair of the house so we didn't call her a stray hound dog foreign sorry Mimi he called her a Fufu you know there are certain breeds of animals that are that are I always laugh and I say well that's not a dog that's a furry mouse when I think of dog I think of a pit bull I think of a rottweiler I think of I think of something with some strength I I don't usually think of a teacup poodle and I sure don't think of those obnoxious chihuahuas but Jesus is not calling her a hound dog a boutique is that right he's not calling her a basset hound he's calling her one of those little dogs that sit at the table and yep slowly you think that was softening the blow I don't how many of you have have had inside dogs and you know that when you sit down to eat they think they just think it's dinner time for them and that dog food you put in the bowl means nothing to them anymore they got real food on the table and they'll just come sit right in the table so Jesus is calling her one of those little Annoying dogs that won't let you eat your supper in peace [Music] until you give them something under the table and then they're quiet as long as it takes them to chew anybody know dogs like that and when they finish nobody wants to admit it some of you has got 10 or 15 around your table maybe I don't know so he wasn't calling her a greyhound a noble Royal looking dog but he'd use the word that means annoying Littles yipping little Chihuahua and even that could not offend her if you were to come for prayer tonight and I were to tell you you're worse than a chihuahua come on every time I turn around I see you you must have no faith why do you keep coming time and time again and if I ask you you probably want me to pray for the same thing that you asked me to pray for the last time how would you act I want to know I want to know would you go home would you stomp on the way out would you call me names I can pretty well guess that you wouldn't be happy with me I'm not saying I should say that or that I'm going to say that because if you all will let me take this next vacation I am not likely to say that but if you fuss about me being gone for a while I might say that because we all have a limit come on now and I'm preaching on me and I'm just saying he's exhausted the disciples and nerves are afraid and the yapping dog keeps saying oh that's son of David have mercy on me now son of David have mercy on me thou son of David and what started off sounding like worship and what started off sounding like like praise and adoration it began to sound like howling animal just I'm gonna I'm gonna compare it to Charlie Brown's parents if anybody ever saw Charlie Brown you know the parents never get language and after a while it must have began to sound like that to the master so he turns to her and he says don't you know it's not lawful for me it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and cast it to the chihuahuas come on to the yelping dogs if you've got another example of a breed you can kick it out I don't know dogs that well huh no you wouldn't dare some of you wouldn't dare because you don't want to offend somebody here I see people stomping out now because we're talking about their dogs you'll never say that about sister Kathy's dog because that dog is too big to be a it's a dog she has a dog like a small horse so then he says to her uh you know I I I I I I can't I can't count it's not lawful for me to cast this food like this a healing belongs to the children brother random said he turned her down bitterly basically called her a little pet dog and she did not argue with the statement oh I must sound like that I I must sound annoying I can only imagine what I must look like rolling around here on the floor all these thoughts going through her mind he had every right to say that to me she's thinking and her answer is yes Lord truth Lord you speak the truth are you still with me you speak the truth Lord I want you to look at what Jesus said in Mark 7 29 Jesus responded for this saying for this saying go thy way what saying truth Lord you speak the truth let me tell you something if Jesus says it your smartest move is to say yes Lord if Jesus says I uh if the word says such and such and such our best response is to say Amen which means so be it so be it so be it if Jesus calls us through his word to dress a little different than the society around us our response should not be but this is not biblical times our response should be yes Lord if the word calls a sister to have long hair as a covering for her head then her answer shouldn't be but that's not modern and I'll look too old and my husband won't love me anymore and I'll be made fun of and nobody thinks gray hair long gray hair is attractive her answer will be yes Lord if the word calls us away from from from from some of the habits that we develop and I woke up this morning and the Lord was talking to me about people becoming dependent even on on on pot I'm not talking about a medical help I'm talking about to chill I don't know who would hear this that would find that as a part of your life but very strange for me to wake up in the morning but that being in my heart if the Lord would call us not to depend on on pill or plant or or whatever we may become too dependent on so dependent on that we forget his ability to heal us and if he should call us wouldn't our answer wouldn't our our only answer be yes Lord truth Lord and Jesus said for this saying go thy way Matthew records the assessment of Our Lord in 1528 he said woman great is thy faith because of her faith expressed in her thoughtful exchange with Jesus the Lord granted her request for a miracle and the verb tense of is gone out is in the perfect tense reflecting the Lord's control and power and that means the demon left while they were still speaking and would remain out because the perfect tense of the word speaks of a completed action so not only is the devil leaving the daughter right now because you have said the right thing but he will find no place to return can anybody give God some praise I'm nearly done in questions and answers paragraph 229 he said oh God seemingly a flat refusal and not only that but to call her a dog but instead of being arrogant about it very sweetly and humbly she said that is true Lord because it was truth she said it is true Lord but the dogs will eat the scraps that fall from their master's table so even though I am looked upon as a dog I'm not asking to get up on top of the table and have what the family's having all I'm asking Lord is that you hear me when I ask for the crumbs how many of your glad for Grace how many of you are glad for a newer Testament how many of your dad you're no longer a dog sitting around the master's table oh but you are mephibosheth you're sitting at the table every handicap is hidden beneath the table and you're eating what the king eats you are no longer a beggar around the table of the master you now have a place at the table and God that's what that's what done the work she was willing just to take the scraps that come from the from the children's table and God that's our attitude just now we're willing to anything that you want to do with us father we're in your hands can anybody say man we're in your hands and then the message questions and answers on the Holy Ghost paragraph 19 he goes on to say she said that's true Lord but the dog under the table eats the children's crumbs he said for this saying remember he is the high priest of our confession so it matters what we're saying it's what she said that caused the Lord to identify her faith she talked like faith she spoke like Faith she even behaved like Faith she rattled the cage like Faith wow I'm not giving up I'm not slacking up I'm not laying down no no no no no no for this saying the devil's left your daughter say good things then you want God to feed you at his table say good things say faith-filled things say something good about somebody matters what you say talk about Jesus say something loyal something real that's a way to get rid of devils [Music] all right notice he never prayed for the girl oh isn't that good he never prayed for the girl he never said one thing about her being healed he just said for this saying for this saying now I want you to look at this story sister weem sitting there and Royale streaming tonight perhaps they knew a modern cyrophoenician woman they knew a little woman by the name of Hattie Wright Mosier brother Branham refers to this incredible story in speaking about the syrophoenician woman he said how do you write the other day she didn't ask for nothing she was just sitting there but she said the right thing yeah which pleased the Holy Spirit you know the story brother Branham is sitting at her kitchen table she has prepared a meal they've been squirrel hunting she has prepared a meal her two young boys preteen boys could care less about church and the things of God they thought all this was silly brother Branham is telling sister Hattie and the family there the story of how God had created by the power of the spoken word you better understand that you better come to understand that the spoken word is a real thing and that it is creative and that it's going to be a part of this last great move of the Holy Ghost when the full manifestation of the sons of God has come into full fruition when that fully adopted group of Believers rise up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the word in their mouth will be his word brother random said in the quote I read you recently they will have the bride they will have the saith the Lord or they will keep still that's what we're pushing forward we get often accused of looking back the only reason why we're looking back is to see who God was so that we can bring him forward to this hour and say he is many didn't see the things that we have been privileged to know about I have probably interviewed more living Witnesses of the ministry of brother Branham than anybody in this room and I couldn't stand here all night long and relate the stories that I have heard with my own ears I ministered in Chautauqua just outside of Chautauqua Ohio for brother Ledford and heard him tell the story of how they took the little girl the little neighbor girl dying of leukemia her parents were not Believers but they convinced and the parents didn't attend the ledford's church but they convinced the neighbors to let them take their daughter from Ohio from Middletown Ohio all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana to be prayed for and they were able to get a private interview with brother Branham and he prayed for the little girl and the Lord healed her she hadn't eaten in days the doctors had given her up and it wasn't treatable in those days like it is treatable now and in fact it was a it was a type of leukemia that's not considered a part of the childhood leukemia family or lack of a better word and so there was no no what they had done to treat her wasn't doing any good she had lost her appetite her belly had swelled and she was really at the point of death and I have to be honest when when sister Ledford was was helping brother Ledford they were going back and forth telling me this story did anybody ever know brother and sister Ledford who pastored in Middletown Ohio anyway precious people precious wonderful people as they were telling it back and forth she said I I I said to them I'm having a hard time imagining parents letting the neighbor take their dying child she said I know brother Shelley it's crazy she said but I ask and they said yes they had given up all hope they had nothing much to lose they were both working every day to pay for what she had received in medical treatment they could not take time off we had to take a day off to go and they drove all the way home that night didn't get home to the wee hours of the morning God so instantly healed that girl that by the time the service was this was before the service by the time the service was over the swelling had gone down in her belly she slept through the preaching they got in the vehicle and brother Ledford looked at I almost called her first name I'm sorry I can't think of it I can see her I can see her hair I can see her he's kind of a large lady I can see her very well he looked brother Ledford looked at sister Ledford and she looked at him and he said honey are you thinking what I'm thinking and she said yes husband are you thinking what I'm thinking they were passing the Burger Joint but the Ledford said going all the way up we wouldn't eat a bite of food because we knew she couldn't tolerate food and we wouldn't eat it in front of her and she said he said now we were getting hungry now she's been healed her stomach has gone down and and said are you think of what I'm thinking yeah I'm thinking what aren't you what will they do if we offer the little girl some food they there's no telling what they may say to us or do do to us and about that time the little girl woke up and they said sweetheart are you hungry I sure am except for for what would you like she said I could sure eat a burger and fries so they they they they shot right into one of those burger joints where they where they come out and serve you at the little speaker they all had a big burger she had a big burger fries we were getting ready to pay and she said the little girl said Mr Ledford do you think I could have another Burger he said honey maybe you shouldn't have two burgers cause said you have not eaten in days and she said that he said I don't know how this is going to affect you your digestion since you have any she said but I sure believe I could eat another Burger he said then another Burger you'll have God moved so much for that child I want you to know God healed her sister Ledford said maybe this is too much information brother Shelley but she said she never even had to go to the bathroom we drove all the way home we didn't dare tell the mother what had happened about the burger we told her what brother Randleman said and how God had healed and the and the stomach had gone down and they could see how strong she looked her color was back and the mama said the mama said honey are you hungry that lady then I didn't get to meet her but that lady then was was a a supervisor of nurses at the hospital with children grown children now of Our Own that is what God did that's who he was we reminisce on what he did so that we can say he's the same today if we forget who he was and what he did yesterday we have no real perception of what he can do today I feel Faith now I feel Faith now I feel Faith now and then how will we have faith for the future yesterday and today oh sister Hattie Wright is hearing the story of how God we got to close of how God had healed I mean had created by the spoken word just like he did for Abraham when he put that Ram in the thicket God has provided himself that's a spoken word Ram God put it there by his creative word just like God and you know what sister Hattie she said brother Branham that ain't nothing but the truth what the Salvation woman said truth Lord she said my brother random that ain't nothing but the truth and the anointing of the Lord fell on him that same presence of God that met him out there in that boat when he gave Resurrection Life to the little fish that same presence of God that spoke the word and said at some point that when before the doctor's hand touches that tumor in in me decide that tumor will disappear and it dead the same God who said speak to the storm and the storm ceased same God who said put the squirrels where you want them and they'll be there all right the same God moved on brother Branham he stood up from that table the spirit of the Lord fell on him and he said had he right sister Hattie you can have anything you asked for he said you just asking I'll give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ I'll give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ you just ask and I'll give it to you now here's what brother Brandon said you can choose to believe it or not he said that if she would have asked for a million dollars it would have fell in her lap oh I don't believe then don't you come up here asking for prayer because if you can't believe that God can do that you probably don't have the faith for your own need anybody I don't mean to be rude I'm just telling you how I feel even your mind even my mind says well how would that happen well I don't know I don't uh maybe some some thieves hit it in the ceiling she says the right thing and God opens up the ceiling and dumps it right down out of the rafters you know I don't know how brother Branham said Hattie was so poor and so so unlearned that she didn't even know what to ask for sister Weems matter sister Royale Ada spent the night in her house and ate at her table knew her these are people that knew this woman brother Brandon said she could have asked for anything Edith and her sister was a crippled needed to be healed her mother and dad were old Indigent people who had no money no Health Care no way to take care of themselves they lived in a shotgun house with no indoor plumbing until the deacons of the Tabernacle went and put him some indoor plumbing they had nothing and she didn't know what to ask for so she asked brother Branham for some help this is no Genie in a Bottle this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever this is a little woman who who was insulted by these words but refused to allow that to move her faith she was insulted and then tested and then she saw the Deliverance are you willing what if life insults you what if not enough people cater to your problem and you get old been out of shape will you be able to push past the insult push Pat the hurt feelings and allow God to give the Deliverance that's needed I must I must I can't afford to miss my blessing now and about that time Orville and what was the other one's name koi I always like to say Orville and Wilbur that was the Flying Brothers what was their names right brother isn't that unusual Orville and Wilbur Wright well this was Coy and Orville right they were standing there there's teenagers in the door brother Brandon called him a bunch of Snicker Snicker Fritz I even forget that sometime when I'm telling it and I say snickerdoodle by the way that's an amazing cookie but he said they're standing there like a bunch of sugar friends laughing they thought the story was funny and they're studying they're snickering and all of a sudden sister Hattie didn't have to decide anymore what she wanted her I want you to put yourself in the in a genie movie I want you to realize you got one wish now you better wish for the right thing that's how we think this was this was Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever but in this moment had he Wright had said the right thing and God was going to give her whatever her heart desired and she turned and saw those two boys over there carrying on like a bunch of Snicker Fritz and she said brother Brandon I want the salvation of my two boys [Music] oh it don't happen that way it can't happen that way don't tell me you've never seemed in what the spirit of conviction can do we need it in the church we got everything else out there we need some of that come on sad stories and church joinings and all the things they do in the name of religion when all we really need is for the spirit of conviction to come into this room and that day the spirit of conviction fell in that dining room in that kitchen of old sister Hattie right and brother random looked over and he said I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ the spirit of conviction fell on those boys who were laughing just two seconds ten seconds before and now they run across the kitchen floor and throw themselves in their mother's lap calling on the name of God for their salvation [Music] show me the picture Nathan is there in the projector folder I believe we've showed it before of these two boys getting baptized they got serious about the Lord there they are that sister had it right in the middle and the two boys that was the day of their baptism this is what I believe I believe that the spirit of conviction is going to operate that way in the last days I do I actually believe that there are people that the Lord has held right where they are I believe I know people that haven't come to Faith because of what was going on in particular churches in their area and God allowed them protected them and held them with his hand right where they were for the right time very bad had the spirit of conviction hit them and they ran to the church as an early believer God sees all and knows all he's sovereign and I believe I know of situations where God saw that that would have been too much it's not like you and I veterans who have been through just about anything you can go through in the church and Like Comics we just keep on ticking but everybody's not like the Energizer Bunny and I've watched God hold people right where they are until the right hour send the spirit of conviction for them them cursing religion and Faith one moment one day and the next day falling in the altars giving their hearts to God baptized in the name of Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost serving the lord today don't you give up on your loved ones I don't care how mean they are I don't care how there are no hard cases you may be listening to me tonight and you may think you're a hard case Jesus doesn't know what a hard case is you're just a case you're just the case that's what you are is just the case there are no hard cases all you've got to do is make up your mind like that little syrup Phoenician woman I'm not listening to anybody's insults nobody's going to keep me from the master wow my faith is going to push me forward let anybody musicians are coming let anybody try to hold me back but they're not going to be successful because I've just got to get to the master you saw the little woman we showed you the little clip the little woman with the issue of blood what about what we saw the other night what about Peter I will forever remember in the episode of The Chosen there were 60 of us and I understand some of you all went the night after there were 60 of us there and in that scene yes I'm going to give it away you ought to been there you ought to been there I've never seen a more real and less cheesy thank God thank God thank God somebody has finally made something that's not cheesy and cheap looking when Jesus comes walking on the water in that camera that camera of you from beneath the water shows his feet there and Peter who's been struggling with his faith Cries Out just bid me come to you just bid me come to you and I'll come to you that's that's right there that's all we needed it moved me so deeply and then the the scene and Peter gets out there and he's walking on the water and the other disciples you know they were jealous don't you forget that's that same bunch of disciples that was aggravated with that poor woman but they were human they were human are you human but you're Supernatural and they're probably wondering wonder why he got to walk on the water you know he's been all been out of shape now for weeks he's been the least fate-filled of all of us we've all been more faithful why'd he get to walk on the water look at that look at what a show-off I'm sure some of them had that in their mind but Peter could I want you to know even care and when you got arms like that you don't care what people say anyway he got out a little short thing a little short thing but great arms and he gets out and he starts doing good and then that first moment yeah first moment I saw the first moment that he caught the wind in the wave and he looked away and he starts going and in that scene where that hand comes down underneath that water I could almost feel myself being pulled up out of the depth come on but that wasn't the greatest part the greatest part is when he gets in the boat and he has wrapped his arms around the Lord and he's saying don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go come on somebody don't let me go let me go it's not kind of like this woman who said oh thou son of David have mercy on me because you said the right thing that that left that demon left that Devil's gone it's gone when she got home she found her daughter he may not come when you want him his timing may not be your timing but he's the same we may not see the scale the the number of Miracles in this day that we saw in the last generation but remember these things are prophesied we are told that it would be this way but that should never become an excuse for us not to believe that he is able to do today what he's always done he is faithful I want you to lift your hands right now I want you all to find a song to lead us in worship and we're just for a moment we're just going to stand where we are and we're just going to raise up our hands and we're just going to begin to Worship the Lord one more time because I don't know what your need is but the Lord knows your need he sees your need right where you are and he wants to help you right you don't need a preacher you need a master you need a master you need a lord it doesn't matter what you're going through right now what you've been walking through Jesus is able he's able to heal he's able to deliver he's able to set free lead us in something he became [Music] that we might become his righteousness his righteousness [Music] the cross [Music] yes yes yes love so amazing yes yes Jesus my son

would you all disagree that the Lord would touch Our Sister Barbara she's come here in faith knowing that he's the same yesterday today and forever we don't know what God's mind is for right now but we know this she has faith you may not hear her crying out but she's got faith she's crying out from the inside yes sir most importantly for salvation for salvation as a vindication that's the most important to know we're saved father this is our dear sister we call her that because we know she is yes she has we know Lord that you saw her before the foundation of the world you made a way of salvation for her and Lord I know that yes there there is always that resistance through the years because of religion to even accept with full Assurance what you have done for us and I'm asking you right now in the name of Jesus that this dear one would be able to receive what you have done at Calvary it's a finished work Lord and she would ask you for the full forgiveness of her sin I know that your bloody is would you come in Lord would you come in Lord now father you see the circumstances of her life [Music] see the unforgiveness that has harbored in her life it is not what she would want to carry oh no she would never want to carry that it's too heavy of a bird but Lord she's not somehow been able to roll that over on you so tonight I'm asking you right now to give her the grace to turn loose of the very root of unforgiveness for the things that she has suffered in life not related to her condition not not things not because she has fallen into this way that's not where the unforgiveness lies but Lord I ask you right now you see the wrongs that have been done to her you see o God how the enemy has tried even to raise up a root of bitterness because of it but our sister has come to you tonight believing that whatever stands between her and you we decree and declare that the blood of Jesus is more powerful than any roots that would try to take a hold of this Precious Child of God [Music] Lord you see the anger that generational that has really been like a cloak around her shoulders but tonight she would desire to be free from that and I don't mean frustration we all get frustrated we all get disappointed but oh God you see the route foreign Lord you see the untimely deaths around her family [Music] yes Lord Hallelujah Lord I see one two three Lord I'm asking you right now to walk her through yes Lord thank you we cut the root of it in the name of Jesus in the authority of Jesus Christ I loose you from the very root of those things yeah lift it off Lord even now yes lift it off even now you are indeed the same you see that which has been stolen from her you see those who have enjoyed lived off of the things that were stolen from her life May forgiveness flow out of her tonight may she be able to turn that loose Lord you see the loss you see the grief and the loss you see the time that she cried let's go over an empty little cradle her heart broken for what had been stolen from her but God I thank you that you're the God yeah Lord I ask you to let her be the solitaire in her family because there are many many many relatives who need salvation who need difference preserved her life and she's here Lord in this life for a reason yet today it's even been a mystery to some how she has still lived in spite of what the enemy would have desired to do so I'm asking you Lord to redeem her testimony among all those who love her and who care for her whose lives are a monk and a mess and I'm asking you to use her life Lord For Your Glory may she be a doorway of salvation for others may they see what you're doing in her life does any of that make sense to you sister it does hallelujah Hallelujah help me up now brother I want to pray

was helped to her and it was strength to her Lord I'm asking you for a touch in her body I'm asking you Lord to loose her from each and everything the enemy would try to use to bind her and to hold
