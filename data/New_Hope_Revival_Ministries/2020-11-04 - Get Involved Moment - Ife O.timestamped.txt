[0:00] i choose to overcome bad politics
[0:03] [Music]
[0:10] we're talking about god establishing
[0:13] an order of requirements and then
[0:16] stepping up to meet those requirements
[0:20] on our behalf we are a bystander
[0:24] in the initial work of redemption he is
[0:28] the active
[0:28] part and we are the bystander
[0:32] but we cannot remain a bystander we have
[0:35] to be a co-participant with him
[0:38] and in order to do that we must invest
[0:40] our faith
[0:41] and we must continue to confess lord
[0:45] i believe that what you have done on my
[0:48] behalf
[0:48] is a finished work and that i am indeed
[0:53] a recipient by faith of what you've done
[0:57] the bible said out of the abundance of
[0:59] the heart
[1:01] the mouth speaks whatever is
[1:03] predominantly represented in your heart
[1:06] is going to form your thoughts and what
[1:09] forms your thoughts
[1:10] is going to create your words
[1:14] your words are going to be created
[1:17] by your thoughts i'm telling you it's a
[1:20] battle that can be
[1:21] won there is a way to win the victory
[1:24] there's a way to maintain the victory
[1:27] there's a way to walk
[1:28] in the glory of the christ life but
[1:31] not automatically it comes
[1:35] by active involvement it's really
[1:38] life or death it's really will you
[1:40] barely get
[1:41] by or will you overcome i choose to be
[1:45] an overcomer
[1:46] i choose to overcome coronavirus
[1:50] i choose to overcome bad politics
[1:53] i choose to overcome the lethargy and
[1:56] laziness of the church age
[1:58] i choose to overcome the spirit of
[2:02] laodicea
[2:03] where everybody fights for their rights
[2:05] and very few stand up for god's truth
[2:08] i cannot be pulled down by the spirit of
[2:11] the age
[2:12] because i was created and born to be an
[2:15] overcomer
[2:16] and you were too as a part of the bride
[2:19] of christ
[2:24] you
